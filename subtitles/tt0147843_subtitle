1
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:31,904
Watchman! Where are you going
with so much luggage?

2
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,420
Are there more guests
in the bungalow?

3
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,649
There are no masters. This is
the luggage of my own people.

4
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:39,705
I will give them on my way.

5
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:42,361
He is so silly.

6
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,754
Carries other people's burden
without any reason.

7
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,362
Naubat, when did you arrive?

8
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:55,085
Silly Baldev, I've been
waiting here for 2 hours.

9
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,471
Where had you been?

10
00:00:56,963 --> 00:01:00,348
Come in first; I'll make you a
cigarette. We'll talk later.

11
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,364
No! First tell me
where had you gone.

12
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,798
I was cooking when I realized
there were no vegetables.

13
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:10,282
So I thought I'd get
some potatoes.

14
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:15,420
And I got late there.
- Baldev, is some ghost after you?

15
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:16,450
Ghost??

16
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,700
What are you saying?

17
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:20,359
So how come your bag is filled..

18
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,834
..with this coal instead
of potatoes?

19
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,815
What did you say?
- See this. - O God!

20
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:27,760
What happened? - The bag is
exchanged. - With whom?

21
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:32,630
How would I know with whom? There
were around 10 - 12 bags.

22
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:37,736
Yes, you know Nandu who
works in railway? - Yes.

23
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,919
He gave me this bag
to give to his wife.

24
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:42,286
How will she light the stove now?

25
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,185
But my dear, how will you
cook the potatoes now?

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,585
That's also right.

27
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:51,727
Yes! My bag must be
at Nandu's place.

28
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:59,628
Baldev, shall I tell you some
thing? - Yes. - You are silly.

29
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,296
You can say anything;
you are my buddy.

30
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:06,239
My dear friend, why do you take..

31
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,237
..other people's troubles
on yourself?

32
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,297
These are not troubles.
They are my own people.

33
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:15,058
And what will I lose if I
do small tasks for them?

34
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:20,563
These own people, all of them
consider you the ox of zoo.

35
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:23,482
Zoo?!
- Baldev! Hey Baldev!

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,759
Here comes your granny.
Deal with her now.

37
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,307
What did I ask you
to bring for me?

38
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:34,759
Bananas, peaches, apples..
and oranges.

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,324
Open this bag and see whether
there are any oranges in it.

40
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,029
Why don't you answer? Speak!

41
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:47,304
See, Naubat, what tragedy he has
done on this auspicious day.

42
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,350
Shall we have to cook..

43
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:52,395
..non-vegetarian food
and be sinners?

44
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:57,360
Lord Ram! You won't even get
the water of Ganga here.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,004
I made a mistake, granny. This
is brother Kadar's bag.

46
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,275
My bag must be somewhere, too.

47
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:07,802
You bag, granny..
must be with him.

48
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:09,597
Wait here; I'll go and find out.

49
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:14,944
Forget it. Just give me back
my penny and I'll go home.

50
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:27,611
Naubat, can I..
- May God bless you!

51
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,064
Here, granny. - Don't know whose
face I saw this morning.

52
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:39,456
I made a mistake.
- A mistake?

53
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:50,601
Do you agree now?
- Agree to what?

54
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,282
That you are silly?

55
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,942
Do people call a man who
helps others a silly?

56
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:02,917
These days they call him
a leader of sillies.

57
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:06,671
Now Mr. Kadar will come
in a while to thrash you.

58
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:09,297
And Nandu will come to smash you.

59
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:13,999
Baldev!
- Here comes your uncle.

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,539
Go and handle him.

61
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:21,777
Greetings, uncle.
- You idiot! My guests are hungry.

62
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,736
And you are chattering
here with this silly?

63
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:25,457
Oh uncle.

64
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:26,664
lf you did not want to bring..

65
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,211
..non-vegetarian food,
you could have told us.

66
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:31,197
I ask you to do some tasks as
I consider you a family man.

67
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,404
But listen.. - You've defamed
me in front of my guests.

68
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,035
Here's your bag.

69
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,863
My dear, would it have
been a trouble..

70
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,268
..if you had given me the
bag on your way home?

71
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,541
This is the result of the
company of these vagabonds.

72
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:50,197
That's ok, but he must have
given you some other bag.

73
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:53,804
Who are you to ask that?
- Yes, uncle, that bag of fruits?

74
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,905
Not fruits; there were
vegetables. We cooked them.

75
00:04:57,278 --> 00:05:00,296
But, uncle, it was someone's bag.
- So what can I do?

76
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,905
At least give him the money
of the vegetables..

77
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,053
Don't interfere, Naubat.

78
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:07,088
Had I asked for the vegetables
that I should pay for it?

79
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,458
Uncle, the money for this food..

80
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,891
Am I doing some charity?

81
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:13,298
Uncle.

82
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:20,473
Naubat, I will go and
check everyone's bags.

83
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,545
Are you fasting today? When
will you cook for yourself?

84
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:26,850
Yes, let's cook first.

85
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,686
But what will you eat? The
potatoes have turned to coal.

86
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:34,609
Will you listen to my request?
- Yes.

87
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:37,375
Will you really listen?
- Yes, dear, tell me.

88
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:41,664
lf you eat only Rotis everyday,
you will have acidity.

89
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:43,604
Listen to me and get married.

90
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:48,698
You'll get someone to cook, and
will also have some sense.

91
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:51,191
And you will get out this
habit of helping others.

92
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:57,067
You feel shy, watchman?
Just agree and..

93
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,190
..I'll find out a girl for you.

94
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:03,051
A very pretty girl.
- I will do this task myself.

95
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:07,067
You won't be able to do it.
This is a delicate matter.

96
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:12,467
Naubat, I've already found a girl.

97
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,123
Have you? In reality or in dreams?

98
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:21,959
She is my dream girl. And I
know she also dreams of me.

99
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,463
Have you ever talked to her?

100
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:29,511
So how did you know that?
- From her eyes.

101
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,784
You don't understand
a 6 feet man..

102
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:34,855
..and you can read the
eyes of a woman?

103
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,605
I understand her eyes.
- I see.

104
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:40,789
So the matter is fixed?
Who is she?

105
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:44,625
Some one. Why should I tell you?

106
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:49,863
Look, when I can't trust your
brains, how can I trust your eyes?

107
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:52,132
It is better to take
the advice of..

108
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:54,565
..intelligent people in
the matter of women.

109
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,563
Just show me her once.

110
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,562
Will you see her?
- Yes, I will.

111
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,228
Now?
- Yes, right now. - Ok.

112
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,496
Look there.

113
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,826
O God! I should hide somewhere.

114
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,816
What happened, Naubat? Look
at her with my sight once.

115
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:25,499
Idiot, look at that fat
buffalo with my sight.

116
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,234
What did you say? Fat buffalo?

117
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:30,230
Wait! I'll thrash you!
- What are you doing?

118
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,500
Baldev, my pal, my friend,
my father, my brother..

119
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:53,167
You are silly. You are stupid.

120
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:56,396
You are the ox of a zoo.

121
00:07:56,438 --> 00:07:59,702
You are out of your senses.
You've gone mad!

122
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:06,798
Press slowly. That fat
woman broke my bones.

123
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,681
Baldev, please don't marry her.

124
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,795
For God's sake don't marry her.

125
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:15,121
Naubat, you've misunderstood.

126
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,361
She wasn't that one.
- Who then?

127
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:21,598
She was the one standing behind
her. - Who? - Gopa!

128
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,329
Why didn't you tell me
that before, silly?

129
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,702
At least I could have
seen her well.

130
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:28,929
See her now.
- No, I don't want to.

131
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,290
Take my advice and marry her soon.

132
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:35,360
Then I'll see her and also eat
the hot food she'll cook.

133
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:40,665
But.. - No ifs and buts. Marry
her soon or someone else will.

134
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:43,705
But how do I marry her?
Tell me some solution.

135
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:47,635
This is the only solution. Talk
to her tomorrow morning.

136
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,971
What do I talk to her?
- I'll explain you. Come now.

137
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,632
Gopa!
- What?

138
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,566
Gopa!
- What?

139
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:19,701
Gopa!
- Gopa, Gopa, Gopa!

140
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,238
I've been hearing only this.

141
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,295
Don't you know how to
speak anything else?

142
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,395
Gopa, I will marry you.

143
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:38,573
"You will meet the bride.
O heart, have patience"

144
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:43,570
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

145
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,762
"O heart, have patience"

146
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:54,836
"You will meet the bride.
O heart, have patience"

147
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:02,739
"She's a fairy, she's playful,
she's stolen your heart"

148
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:09,173
"She's a fairy, she's playful,
she's stolen your heart"

149
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:13,863
"I will see her face
till the morning"

150
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:18,765
"You will get to see
a pretty woman"

151
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:22,336
"O heart, have patience"

152
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,674
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

153
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,674
"O heart, have patience"

154
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:37,697
"She is your queen, and you
are a handsome Rajput"

155
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:44,173
"She is your queen, and you
are a handsome Rajput"

156
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,697
"You are gutsy, so also
have a strong heart"

157
00:11:49,238 --> 00:11:53,674
"Our eyes will meet"

158
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:57,172
"O heart, have patience"

159
00:11:57,595 --> 00:12:02,473
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

160
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,608
"O heart, have patience"

161
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:14,512
"You will meet the bride.
O heart, have patience"

162
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:33,012
Ramdas! - Yes, child.
- Shall this also be sold?

163
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:38,345
No, child. Just as a
child is not sold.

164
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:40,413
A mother is not sold either.

165
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,370
I've never seen my mother.

166
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,018
But whenever I see this statue,
I remember her.

167
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,588
My mother was just like this,
wasn't she, Ramdas?

168
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:54,686
Yes, child, madam looked
just the same.

169
00:16:56,511 --> 00:17:00,376
Have faith. Ramdas
will sell himself..

170
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:02,728
..but not let the statue
of your mother be sold.

171
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:49,286
Will this property
you've gathered..

172
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,785
..after years of hard work
be ruined today, sir?

173
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:59,401
Don't know why God writes such
fortune for good people.

174
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:04,549
This is life, Ramdas. It
is the law of nature..

175
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,548
..that the life goes on.

176
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:12,720
The man dies and the wealth
meets calamity.

177
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:19,712
lf it weren't so, wealth would
have been a trouble to people.

178
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,216
What I fear, sir, is that..

179
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:28,813
..when this house will
be auctioned forcibly..

180
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,378
..how will you save your
precious dignity.

181
00:18:33,752 --> 00:18:37,209
I am not worried about
my prestige or dignity.

182
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:45,554
The dear sign of my son
will become homeless.

183
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,204
What will happen to my
granddaughter, Ram?

184
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:51,548
I've served you all my life, sir.

185
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:54,243
Now without repaying..

186
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:58,011
Honest tears are more expensive
than service, Ramdas.

187
00:18:58,998 --> 00:19:03,889
You've repaid more than you
should by crying on my sorrow.

188
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,701
This means that I won't
be able to do anything..

189
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,453
..except crying to save the
prestige of my master.

190
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,769
What else will I be able
to do, Ramdas? - Master!

191
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:19,111
When my son died an early death..

192
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:24,076
..worrying about how to repay
the debt of Madanlal..

193
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:27,849
..I had explained
his daughter that..

194
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:34,444
..child, I have heaps of
wealth for your needs.

195
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:39,038
But I won't be able to
save anything today.

196
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,223
God helps those who want to save.

197
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,703
You are worried about your
grandchild unnecessarily.

198
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:46,852
Am I right, Mr. Madan?
- Yes.

199
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,469
What do you mean?

200
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,865
Mr. Madan is ready to
stop this auction.

201
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:54,783
Am I right, Mr. Madan?
- Yes.

202
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,276
What's the reason for this favor?

203
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:59,717
There's no favor. It's a
matter of give and take.

204
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,301
You marry your granddaughter
to Mr. Madan..

205
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:05,436
..and he is ready to stop
the auction immediately.

206
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,035
Right, Mr. Madan?
- Yes.

207
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,184
Do you expect me to marry
my granddaughter..

208
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,452
..to this scoundrel
and dishonest father?

209
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:18,748
Look, mister, I am a lawyer.
I wish well for everyone.

210
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:23,700
I think Mr. Madan's request
is quite reasonable.

211
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:29,460
And in this situation
no one.. am I right?

212
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,355
I will call this Mr.
Madan's kindness..

213
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:37,385
..that he is ready to let go of
1 lakh 20 thousand rupees..

214
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:40,414
..despite getting tied in
a trouble like marriage.

215
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:44,878
Shall I ask you something?
- Sure. Ask two questions.

216
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,992
Are you a lawyer or
a marriage broker?

217
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:53,459
This house and all the furniture
are lying before you.

218
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:58,927
Just do your work quietly. I
don't need anyone's favor.

219
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,104
Mr. Madan, I want to tell you
something. - Yes, tell me.

220
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,318
Please, come.

221
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:49,500
What did you gain by hurting
my poor grandpa..

222
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,718
..who is already helpless
due to his circumstances?

223
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,658
I am hurting no one's feelings.

224
00:21:57,213 --> 00:22:00,830
It is your misunderstanding that
you find my favor hurting.

225
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:02,847
Is taking advantage..

226
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,879
..of someone's helplessness
called favor?

227
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,037
I am ready to let
go of my credit..

228
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,239
..worth lakhs of rupees
for your dignity.

229
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,638
I want to give you a better
status by marrying you.

230
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,690
Do you call it taking advantage
of your helplessness?

231
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:20,262
Mr. Madan, we are in trouble
at the moment.

232
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,859
We need sympathy;
don't aggrieve us.

233
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:26,918
I have nothing to do with
anyone's joys or sorrows.

234
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:29,718
I just want myself to be happy.

235
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,317
I also want happiness,
for my grandfather.

236
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,129
lf you want an expensive
thing like happiness..

237
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:39,589
..you will have to
accept my offer.

238
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,684
What if I don't?
- So?

239
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,623
I will ruin you.

240
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:50,708
I will auction these symbols
of your prestige.

241
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:53,585
I will make you beg for a bite.

242
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:57,044
I will ruin your family's
prestige..

243
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,318
Enough! Don't say a word more.

244
00:23:01,065 --> 00:23:02,588
So, do you agree to my offer?

245
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,544
Give me the token then.
Come close to me. Come.

246
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,006
Such token must be the tradition
of your family, not mine.

247
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:19,334
I will deal with your
family's prestige.

248
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:33,098
What's the reason to cancel
this auction? - God's wish.

249
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:35,188
This is strange! You were
auctioning yesterday.

250
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:38,788
And today it's canceled?
- It's God's wish.

251
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:42,196
So why did you call the
buyers over here..

252
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:45,494
I told you it's God's wish.

253
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:48,131
And who'll pay for our
transport fares..

254
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:52,827
That's also God's wish.
- Good!

255
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,755
Grandpa, how come you're up here?

256
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,344
It's a market down there.

257
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:11,796
I want to talk to you
privately, child.

258
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,448
What's the matter, grandpa?

259
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,523
The matter is very embarrassing
for me.

260
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:26,531
My son, daughter-in-law,
and other relatives..

261
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,488
..handed you over to
me before they died.

262
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,641
I thought I had more
than enough wealth.

263
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,205
I would not act miser..

264
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:40,959
..when using money for
your needs and joys.

265
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:46,355
But today when this house and
other things will be auctioned..

266
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,962
..and we will have nothing
left to us..

267
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:54,450
Granpa! Hasn't Ramdas told you?
- Told what?

268
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,686
The disagreement is over.

269
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:01,689
Now we won't have to leave our
house or other belongings.

270
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:04,201
All obstacles are out of our way.

271
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:07,243
How? How did this impossible
task take place?

272
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:14,623
When luck favors you, the killer
himself comes to save you.

273
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:18,690
Madan.. Mr. Madan..
- What about Madan?

274
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,560
He wants to marry me.

275
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,688
lf my marriage to him solves
this problem, why not do so?

276
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,316
What?
- I will marry him.

277
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:35,454
It's not a marriage. That devil
wants to buy you in auction.

278
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,621
Marriages take place with
some give and take.

279
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,261
There's no buying
or selling in that.

280
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:44,717
It is a give and take
of friendship..

281
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,621
..to strengthen the ties
of relationships.

282
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:48,291
This is buying and selling.

283
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:51,621
Mr. Madan is a very rich and
kind man, grandfather.

284
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:57,272
I am lucky that I
got this chance..

285
00:25:58,137 --> 00:25:59,622
..of saving our family's prestige.

286
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,620
I am very happy today.

287
00:26:03,132 --> 00:26:09,196
So happy that I feel like singing.

288
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:11,554
I am very helpless, child.

289
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,554
Don't make me hear your sobs
in the name of singing.

290
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:25,272
"She got the king of palaces"

291
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:31,050
"Your dear daughter will
rule over there"

292
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:40,180
"Bid her farewell with a smile.
Your daughter will rule"

293
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,289
"She got the king of palaces"

294
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,769
"Your dear daughter will
rule over there"

295
00:26:57,313 --> 00:27:02,842
"There will be an uproar
in all the streets"

296
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:09,537
"There will be an uproar
in all the streets"

297
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:15,274
"All shoulders will carry
the bride's carriage"

298
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:19,713
"Her heart will dance
in that carriage"

299
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,448
"Her heart will dance
in that carriage"

300
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,738
'Your dear daughter will
rule over there"

301
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:40,214
"Bid her farewell with a smile.
Your daughter will rule"

302
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:54,531
"The family she will go to,
will become a heaven"

303
00:27:54,612 --> 00:28:00,598
"The family she will go to,
will become a heaven"

304
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,139
"She will maintain the prestige
of both the families"

305
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:11,148
"That is what her parents
will bless her with"

306
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,608
"That is what her parents
will bless her with"

307
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:22,477
"Your dear daughter will
rule over there"

308
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:31,812
"Bid her farewell with a smile.
Your daughter will rule"

309
00:28:40,314 --> 00:28:46,232
"Daughter is someone's wealth"

310
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:51,772
"Daughter is someone's wealth"

311
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:57,596
"Who is ever able to keep
her with himself?'

312
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:02,632
"Don't feel sad for that"

313
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:09,192
"Don't feel sad for that"

314
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:13,978
"Your dear daughter will
rule over there"

315
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:18,218
"She got the king of palaces"

316
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:22,582
"Your dear daughter will
rule over there"

317
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:31,575
"Bid her farewell with a smile.
Your daughter will rule"

318
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:37,139
"She got the king of palaces"

319
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:48,624
Mr. Rai has come.

320
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:52,246
Greetings, Mr. Rai.
Come in. Please, come.

321
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,941
Coming, sir.

322
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,465
Please, come.

323
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,064
Forgive us, Mr. Rai; we bothered
you unnecessarily.

324
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:03,840
You mean? - Mr. Rai, the
auction is canceled.

325
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:05,988
The reason?
- The reason is very interesting.

326
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:09,064
Am I right, Mr. Madan?
- Yes.

327
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:13,566
What is the matter after all?
- Come in and I'll make it clear.

328
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:14,879
Come.

329
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:34,906
That means you want
to buy the daughter..

330
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:38,138
..of the debtor in exchange
for the debt. Nice deal.

331
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,406
The pretty girl will remain
indebted to you..

332
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:43,136
..and will also get
all this in dowry.

333
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,403
Mr. Madan, you are
a true businessman.

334
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:48,737
Child, what is this rude behavior?

335
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:52,950
I am not misbehaving. I am just
praising the decent man.

336
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:55,610
This is bad. No matter
what one does..

337
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:57,409
..you have no right to taunt him.

338
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:00,082
The storm is getting stronger.

339
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,406
Excuse me.

340
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:12,543
Rama, come; I'll introduce
you to Mr. Rai.

341
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:15,012
He is a very rich man.

342
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,978
Come on; why do you feel shy now?

343
00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:31,468
He is my dear, elder Mr. Rai.

344
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,053
She is Prema, Mrs. Rai!

345
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,456
You know her; she is my..

346
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:43,993
Glad to meet her. Mr. Madan, I
am impressed with your choice.

347
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,053
Please, be seated. I think you
won't be able to return soon.

348
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:52,744
I will arrange the meal
for you. Ramdas!

349
00:31:53,105 --> 00:31:56,962
Rama, you just spoke
out my thoughts.

350
00:31:57,408 --> 00:32:00,579
What is it, child?
- Get the meal ready for them.

351
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:03,964
Just arrange for the food; I'll
arrange for the drinks myself.

352
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:07,743
Mr. Madan, I've seen your choice.

353
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,255
Now at least show me the things
that I wanted to buy.

354
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,203
Yes, please come.
- Come, Prema.

355
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:30,721
Who are you?
- What?

356
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:33,782
I asked you who you are.

357
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,669
I make pictures; I mean
I am a painter.

358
00:32:37,837 --> 00:32:40,669
Painter? Over here?

359
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:44,377
I was out to look for
a good scenery but..

360
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,710
..that Almighty Painter spread
his colors before I could.

361
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:49,789
Please, come in.
- Thank you.

362
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:00,719
Who are you?
- Well..

363
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:03,330
Who are you? Why don't you answer?

364
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:07,127
I am a painter by profession,
singer by hobby..

365
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:10,445
..and a refugee by
the circumstances.

366
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:12,652
In total you're a vagabond, right?

367
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,252
You can say that.

368
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,311
It can also be said that
in ancient times..

369
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:22,844
..painters and singers used to
be the honor of royal palaces..

370
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:25,285
This is neither a royal palace
nor some refugee camp.

371
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,407
Go away from here.
Get out.

372
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,522
Please, don't get angry.

373
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,758
A person behaves rude
when he is angry.

374
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,315
Will you teach me good behavior?

375
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:36,926
Perhaps I am not capable of that.
- Go away from here then.

376
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,644
You won't go!

377
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:49,620
Mr. Madan, I still full rights
on my house and myself.

378
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,325
You, please, be seated.

379
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:57,650
I regret that I've created
a displeasing situation.

380
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:01,430
It would be better for me to
leave. - Go if the rain stops.

381
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:04,876
I might have to wait
long for that.

382
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:08,653
Doesn't matter; wait a bit more.

383
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,256
Sir!

384
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:15,485
Who else has come?

385
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,311
Some man has come in to
get shelter from rain.

386
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,799
She is talking to him.

387
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,828
Take care of him.
- Why, sir?

388
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:24,463
See that no one returns
without having food..

389
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:27,258
..in this hustle and bustle
of the auction.

390
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:31,498
You are too much, sir. Here,
take the medicine.

391
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:45,167
What are you doing here?
Come and sit in the hall.

392
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,397
I've known that..

393
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,282
..you are a painter by
profession, singer by hobby..

394
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:53,236
..and a refugee by
the circumstances.

395
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,623
But summing up those three,
what is your name?

396
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,739
That mister has already
totaled that; a vagabond.

397
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:05,900
It is also a fondness to
put one's self on target.

398
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:10,515
It is interesting. - Meet her.
She is Mrs. Rai and he is..

399
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:13,194
Vagabond!

400
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,299
Excuse me.

401
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:18,191
I'll be back in a while.

402
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:24,556
Ramdas, we will have to
cook for one more person.

403
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,505
Can that be done?
- Do you need to ask that?

404
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:29,648
lf I'm cooking for 10 people,
I can cook for one more.

405
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,816
That's good.

406
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:34,274
Guests and more guests.

407
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:37,683
They are indebted, but won't
stop inviting guests.

408
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:41,217
Like grandfather,
like granddaughter.

409
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:47,772
Where do you live?
- I live in the city, but..

410
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:51,088
We are also going to leave from
here after having the meal.

411
00:35:51,578 --> 00:35:53,270
We can drop you on the way.

412
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:56,403
It is time for dinner. You can
also have dinner with us.

413
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:00,152
Thank you very much, but I
won't be able to eat here.

414
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:04,666
Why? It's late and also raining..

415
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,491
And he must be hungry, too.

416
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:08,049
Yes, I do get hungry..

417
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,972
..but there's difference
between hungers.

418
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:13,113
And the difference is that a
rich man kills the hunger..

419
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,213
..while a poor man is
killed by the hunger.

420
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:19,960
Perhaps you want the
hunger to kill you.

421
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,060
No, it's not that. Actually,
this..

422
00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:25,005
..invitation will prove
expensive to me.

423
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:27,523
You speak as if you
had come to a hotel..

424
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,287
..and we were going to
take money from you.

425
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,699
You might not, but I don't
eat free of cost.

426
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:37,466
Ok, I'll decide. In return..

427
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,529
In return you make a picture
of the host. Is that ok?

428
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:44,936
You had said that you're
a painter by profession..

429
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:47,452
..and a singer by hobby.

430
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,543
Forget the profession
and fulfill your hobby.

431
00:36:51,562 --> 00:36:54,401
My hobby is going to be fulfilled
in a very strange way.

432
00:37:08,678 --> 00:37:12,123
Listen! Why are there
labels on them?

433
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:19,049
These are to be sold.
- To be sold? Why?

434
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:21,782
It's a play of times.

435
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,948
My sir says this is life.

436
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,746
What are you looking at?

437
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,291
These statues are so beautiful.

438
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,628
Feels like they'd
speak any moment.

439
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:54,630
I don't understand how
anyone can value them.

440
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,300
Are these to be sold?

441
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:01,948
They were to be sold,
but now no more. - Why?

442
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:07,403
A face is sold instead
of these statues now.

443
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,557
Misters! The meal is ready on
the table. Come and eat it.

444
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:16,561
You come, too.

445
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:18,344
Let's go. Come on.

446
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:21,630
Come, Prema.
- Please, come.

447
00:38:22,572 --> 00:38:24,739
Grandpa was talking about
that man from Darjeeling..

448
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,233
Have a seat.

449
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,170
No, no. You sit over here.
You sit there.

450
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:35,231
You sit here.

451
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:51,196
Isn't that painter sitting
here with us?

452
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:55,202
Oh! That prince will
have food alone?

453
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,557
Why are you entertaining
that irritable person?

454
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,496
It is the tradition of this
family to look after the guests.

455
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:09,327
A guest is considered
God in this house.

456
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:23,495
What are you thinking?

457
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,241
I am thinking that..

458
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:28,157
..the price of this food will
be much more than this picture.

459
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,568
Is it because you're drawing it..

460
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:33,498
..or because it will
be my picture? - Yes?

461
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,166
I asked you to sing because
the value of my picture..

462
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:42,005
..won't be enough to get
you a meal for one time.

463
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:46,452
Even my profession and hobby
together cannot value you.

464
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:48,835
Please, eat the food.

465
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,452
Tell me. - What are you doing?
- Drawing a sketch!

466
00:40:13,832 --> 00:40:16,032
You understand sketch, don't you?
- Sketch?

467
00:40:16,424 --> 00:40:19,612
Yes, that means lines.

468
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:25,952
I bring life to lines and guess
the nature of that person.

469
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:27,778
Don't try to trap me.

470
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,629
I know very well the nature
of people like you.

471
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:34,302
Where do you live?

472
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:37,110
Why bother about that, sir?
This is a journey.

473
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,110
When the night falls,
I stay wherever I am.

474
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,515
So do you intend to stay where
you've eaten free meal?

475
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,536
Mr. Madan, I didn't
know a person could..

476
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:51,527
..quarrel so much with
another person.

477
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:55,449
You are our guest.

478
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,780
Please, don't embarrass
my good manners..

479
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,919
..by insulting a guest
in front of me.

480
00:41:16,983 --> 00:41:25,390
"When I didn't get flowers,
I made friends with thorns"

481
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:33,721
"When I didn't get flowers,
I made friends with thorns"

482
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,714
"This is the way."

483
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:46,882
"This is the way I spent life"

484
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,782
"When I didn't get flowers.. '

485
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:09,649
"Come what may; I will
face the situation"

486
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:17,811
"Come what may; I will
face the situation"

487
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:21,715
"I found my God."

488
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:30,483
"I found my God and
have worshipped him"

489
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:38,992
"When I didn't get flowers,
I made friends with thorns"

490
00:42:56,383 --> 00:43:03,652
"Our eyes hadn't met
and yet I saw her"

491
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:12,223
"Our eyes hadn't met
and yet I saw her"

492
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:16,250
"I hadn't said anything."

493
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:24,779
"I hadn't said anything
and yet I talked to her"

494
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,251
"When I didn't get flowers."

495
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:46,586
"The one who loves
silver and gold"

496
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:54,745
"The one who loves
silver and gold"

497
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,752
"They will say someday."

498
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:07,290
"They will say someday that
they committed suicide"

499
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:15,188
"When I didn't get flowers,
I made friends with thorns"

500
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:24,169
"This is the way I spent life"

501
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,184
"When I didn't get flowers."

502
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:36,933
Whom should I praise? The picture
or the one who made it?

503
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:39,849
It would be wrong to
praise the painter..

504
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:43,175
..as he was busy singing, and
this picture is just a copy.

505
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,190
And it is not possible
to praise the picture.

506
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:50,953
You've done much more than
the price of the meal.

507
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:56,203
A beautiful picture
and a lovely song.

508
00:44:56,934 --> 00:45:00,147
We got this deal for low price,
right? - What do I say?

509
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:04,542
One needs a mathematician's
mind to value these things.

510
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:06,556
lf you had not made
a deal with me..

511
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,000
..I would have had to roam out
in that storm all night.

512
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:10,542
lf it is necessary to value,..

513
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:12,707
..it is me who got
the deal for cheap.

514
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:28,569
Mr. Rai, I don't think we will
be able to go back at present.

515
00:45:29,065 --> 00:45:30,794
The storm shows no
sign of stopping.

516
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,419
Why not stay here?

517
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,556
They will make arrangements
for you for tonight.

518
00:45:34,722 --> 00:45:37,005
Am I right, Mr. Madan?
- Yes.

519
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:43,091
All right. Mr. Madan has the
chance of playing host tonight.

520
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:44,556
Yes, sure.

521
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,257
What do you intend? They
are not going now.

522
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,089
So how will you get a free ride?

523
00:45:55,028 --> 00:45:56,299
I want nothing for free, mister.

524
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:59,259
Don't worry; my legs are
not at the mercy of cars.

525
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:01,087
I am used to walking.

526
00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:02,828
lf you are used to that, why
don't you go from here?

527
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:06,022
Don't know how these poor ones
dare to speak such rubbish.

528
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:11,265
Those who are poor with money
are rich with courage, sir.

529
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,753
Are you going?

530
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:36,058
I am supposed to go.

531
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:38,278
How can anyone go out
in such weather?

532
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:40,089
Those who can't, stay back.

533
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:43,976
I can go. I should go.

534
00:46:45,226 --> 00:46:47,216
At least stay back till
the storm recedes.

535
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:51,023
Not only this storm, I can wait
till the pace of life stops.

536
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:54,609
But perhaps my staying here
will increase the storm.

537
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:57,750
Perhaps the world moves
only when I move.

538
00:47:17,603 --> 00:47:20,978
He's come back again! Thinks
he's not at mercy!

539
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,987
He's used to walking!

540
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:21,003
Gopa!

541
00:48:21,423 --> 00:48:25,679
Gopa? Who's Gopa? I am Rama.

542
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:52,523
Greetings! - Who else is in
this house except them?

543
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:57,914
There is a lady cook in the
house, and the sir's driver.

544
00:48:59,045 --> 00:49:01,554
Where are they?
- In the kitchen.

545
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:08,044
Lakhan Singh, find out whether
there's someone else, too.

546
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:14,653
Do you see now what I said?

547
00:49:14,749 --> 00:49:16,729
Now I get why he talked
so arrogantly.

548
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,268
He was the spy of these goons.

549
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:22,185
What rubbish are you talking?
What spy?

550
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:26,136
He was invited to meal,
was asked to sing..

551
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,262
..and was also offered
a lift in the car.

552
00:49:29,163 --> 00:49:32,154
He had come to inspect an
opportunity. Now pay for it.

553
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,230
What are you saying?
- That man was your spy.

554
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,864
This man seems to be
out of his senses.

555
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:40,750
Shall I repair him, chief?

556
00:49:53,101 --> 00:49:56,263
Who's come? - Don't know who
might have come at this hour.

557
00:49:57,169 --> 00:49:58,706
Go and see.

558
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,010
Sit down.

559
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,125
It's so dark and stormy outside..

560
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:10,610
..but still someone
knocks on the door.

561
00:50:10,652 --> 00:50:12,737
I've forgotten my
bag here. My bag.

562
00:50:19,873 --> 00:50:22,136
Wait! Where are you going?

563
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,774
To where I had come from.

564
00:50:26,478 --> 00:50:27,735
Stop!

565
00:50:28,337 --> 00:50:30,787
We are not the people of
this house. Let us go.

566
00:50:30,955 --> 00:50:34,134
Keep quiet! Sit down.

567
00:50:37,347 --> 00:50:38,201
Sit down.

568
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,787
Sir.

569
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:43,340
Chief, let us go. We will
make you happy. - How?

570
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,136
We don't have much as
we are on a trip.

571
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:50,067
But I might get 1000 rupees
in my wallet. - Get it.

572
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:05,443
Keep it! You might need it.

573
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,168
Baldev?!

574
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:17,668
What is in that bag?

575
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:22,368
Whatever I own is in
this bag, mister.

576
00:51:24,437 --> 00:51:29,004
Two vests, a towel, a
shirt and a soap bar.

577
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:37,160
Colors, 6 brushes..
- Move this wreckage! - Wreckage?

578
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:42,173
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
I am a widow with kids.

579
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:46,261
I work hard to bring up
my kids. Don't kill me.

580
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:47,814
Shut up!

581
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:52,670
Don't scream and shout.

582
00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:57,205
We are your guests. We
don't kill our hosts.

583
00:51:58,139 --> 00:51:59,721
You only rob them!

584
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:07,809
lf you talk too much, I will
pull your tongue out.

585
00:52:10,788 --> 00:52:13,476
Go and cook food for us. Quickly!

586
00:52:14,504 --> 00:52:16,165
Right away, sir.

587
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:18,597
Keep an eye on this old woman.

588
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:26,974
And you, driver! Sit facing
that wall over there. Go!

589
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:32,706
You're dictating as if you were
the chief of goons, Baldev.

590
00:52:33,423 --> 00:52:36,939
You got it right; I am Baldev.

591
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:40,943
So you are the chief of
goons, Baldev Singh?

592
00:52:42,732 --> 00:52:45,781
Are you more intelligent
or good hearted?

593
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,809
The government has decided a
prize of 1 .25 lakhs on you.

594
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,640
I know those scoundrels
very well..

595
00:52:55,638 --> 00:53:01,393
..who have raised funds and given
to government to arrest me.

596
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,759
I am very glad to meet you.

597
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:10,611
You shouldn't be glad,
but scared to meet me.

598
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:13,723
I am a very dangerous goon.

599
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:19,663
It's not your fault. I have seen
more dangerous goons than you.

600
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:24,699
Look at him. He is the son
of the king of goons.

601
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:28,071
His father had given my son..

602
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:31,892
..a credit of 20,000 rupees
six years back.

603
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,827
Today this goon has come to ruin
us by making it six times more.

604
00:53:39,693 --> 00:53:42,538
What are you? You
do illegal tasks.

605
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:46,747
What is he? He is a legal robber.

606
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:48,555
He seems to be a son of a fool.

607
00:53:50,008 --> 00:53:53,474
He must know that,
Why the owner give loan.

608
00:53:54,288 --> 00:53:57,596
To collect the entire
property from them.

609
00:53:58,164 --> 00:54:00,521
His son is not satisfied with this..

610
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:04,070
..he want to take all our property.

611
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:07,260
Rather he wants to snatch
away a child..

612
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:10,584
..from her old grandfather
in the form of interest.

613
00:54:10,649 --> 00:54:12,667
Please, grandpa, you keep quiet.

614
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:27,475
What sort of people are
gathered in this house?

615
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:33,843
Ask me; I'll tell you. You've
known him and my grandchild.

616
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:39,772
And I think.. she is this
rich man's daughter.

617
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:42,502
No! She is my wife!

618
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:48,747
Wife?!

619
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:53,081
Rich man!

620
00:54:58,327 --> 00:55:01,278
You've come here to recollect
six times your Rs. 20,000 loan.

621
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,347
You want to buy an innocent
girl's body for your credit?

622
00:55:08,815 --> 00:55:10,748
I am marrying her.

623
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:18,070
And you, Gopa?
- Rama!

624
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:23,434
You want to mortgage your life..

625
00:55:23,813 --> 00:55:25,846
..with this moneylender
for your debt?

626
00:55:26,753 --> 00:55:30,017
Do you really want to marry
this indecent man?

627
00:55:30,098 --> 00:55:31,672
Marriage, marriage, marriage!

628
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:33,782
Leave me on my own for God's sake.

629
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,576
My wedding is my personal matter.

630
00:55:35,753 --> 00:55:37,743
I will do whatever I want.

631
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:32,085
What is it?
- I've found a very good thing.

632
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:34,679
Really? - Yes. - What is it?
- Shall I show you? - Yes.

633
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:40,422
Got scared!

634
00:57:32,524 --> 00:57:33,922
Hungry dogs!

635
00:57:34,977 --> 00:57:39,395
Mind your language, mister.
They've got guns.

636
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:43,410
They're acting brave because
of those guns.

637
00:57:44,284 --> 00:57:46,678
lf they didn't have the guns, I
would have taught them a lesson.

638
00:57:46,898 --> 00:57:49,545
Why? What are you blabbering?

639
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,390
Beware! No one will move!

640
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,863
Mind you! Come this way. Come!

641
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:15,146
Put your guns down, and
turn to the wall. Turn!

642
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:17,933
Where will you escape now?

643
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,322
I will repay for my master's
favors today.

644
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:23,763
And will repay his debt with the
prize being declared on you.

645
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,321
Mind you, Ramdas!

646
00:58:25,363 --> 00:58:28,160
I don't want to pay my debt by
selling the life of my guests.

647
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,939
Put the pistol down.
- Don't stop me today, sir.

648
00:58:31,371 --> 00:58:33,893
I will get the prize declared
on this goon..

649
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:36,599
..and will free our child from
the custody of this man.

650
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:38,538
Ramdas.

651
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:44,163
No, Ramdas, no!
- Rama, move aside!

652
00:58:44,249 --> 00:58:47,421
Put the pistol down.
- No, child, move away.

653
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:50,291
One shouldn't take anyone's
life in return of favors.

654
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:53,216
Put away the pistol.
- No, child, I won't spare him..

655
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:54,796
Move aside..

656
00:58:56,636 --> 00:58:58,297
Ramdas.

657
00:58:59,846 --> 00:59:03,261
Scoundrel! Who told you to fire?

658
00:59:03,364 --> 00:59:05,794
Why did you stop me, child? Why?

659
00:59:05,998 --> 00:59:09,227
I would have freed sir from
his debt today. - Let me see.

660
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,821
Come and tie the bandage.

661
00:59:16,565 --> 00:59:17,816
Come.

662
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:22,121
Come and wash your hands.

663
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,813
Here's the soap and the towel.
Please, wash your hands.

664
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,961
I hope the wound is not deep.
- No, nothing serious.

665
00:59:40,846 --> 00:59:47,114
Go and rest in your room. I'll
look after everything here. - Ok.

666
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:55,149
What wrong did he say?

667
00:59:57,241 --> 00:59:59,087
Why did you stop him?

668
01:00:01,073 --> 01:00:02,266
Listen!

669
01:00:07,097 --> 01:00:09,750
You could have freed
yourself from the..

670
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:13,280
..trap of that businessman by
getting the prize declared on me.

671
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:19,072
Why did you lose this chance?
Why did you act so stupid?

672
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:24,924
What is stupidity to you can be
cleverness to other person.

673
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:29,809
Everyone has different
ideas and principles.

674
01:00:29,866 --> 01:00:31,285
Your principles are wrong.

675
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,572
Such principles are
sold for peanuts..

676
01:00:33,614 --> 01:00:35,021
..in the market of this world.

677
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,777
You are unlucky, Rama..

678
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:45,219
..that you want to give
your life on purpose.

679
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:53,259
Strange! Why are you feeling
bad for someone's injuries?

680
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:57,422
You won't get it.

681
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,875
Only a woman can understand
a woman's sorrow.

682
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:07,693
I wish I could make
her feel the pain..

683
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:12,083
..of being sacrificed
for wrong principles.

684
01:01:27,946 --> 01:01:29,743
It is so surprising.

685
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:33,142
What?

686
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:40,050
What would have Ramdas
gained by what he did?

687
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:44,356
He did that for me, right? He
didn't even care for his life.

688
01:01:46,511 --> 01:01:49,728
I've been traveling through
out the country.

689
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:54,097
And have tried to find loyalty
in people's eyes.

690
01:01:56,328 --> 01:01:59,706
I've seen till now that the
clever people of this country..

691
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:03,007
..prefer to be deceitful rather
than being intelligent.

692
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:07,723
An intellectual wishes to
die with his knowledge..

693
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,960
..rather than sharing
it with others.

694
01:02:12,827 --> 01:02:15,984
The stronger ones are tyrants,
and the rich ones misers.

695
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:20,131
Even the poor ones don't want
to get rid of their poverty.

696
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:24,025
Rather they want to see others
to be poorer than themselves.

697
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:30,078
I've seen duties and ethics being
sold out in this country.

698
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:40,506
But what I've seen
tonight is novel.

699
01:02:41,697 --> 01:02:44,033
I feel like giving
my life for the..

700
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:48,247
..silver lining I've seen
on this stormy night.

701
01:02:48,728 --> 01:02:51,662
Whose turn?
- Your turn. - Is it?

702
01:02:52,575 --> 01:02:57,533
Ok, my horse kills your soldier.
- But this soldier is yours.

703
01:02:59,678 --> 01:03:02,152
Made a mistake. Sorry. My
horse will come back.

704
01:03:04,512 --> 01:03:07,147
Play now.
- It's still your turn. - Really?

705
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:11,748
Here, my horse kills your soldier.

706
01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:14,287
But the horse moves only 2 112
steps. How can you jump here?

707
01:03:14,653 --> 01:03:16,086
It will move that way!

708
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,721
My camel kills your horse.

709
01:03:21,262 --> 01:03:26,114
Your camel killed my horse? Is
my elephant sleeping over here?

710
01:03:26,195 --> 01:03:27,816
My elephant will kill your camel.

711
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:29,974
But how can the elephant
move here?

712
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:33,724
It will walk just this way. It
was bored standing over there.

713
01:03:34,336 --> 01:03:35,609
Play now.

714
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,851
Ok, my horse kills
your elephant, too.

715
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:42,279
Which is the strongest player
of them all? - The minister.

716
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:46,402
Ok, my king will kill
your minister.

717
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:50,767
You're finished then.
- What did you say? I'm finished?

718
01:03:50,778 --> 01:03:53,418
No, no, I mean your king is
finished. - My king finished?

719
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,879
I mean this game is over.

720
01:03:57,573 --> 01:04:00,761
All right, all right. We'll
now start another game.

721
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,181
Second game.

722
01:04:02,661 --> 01:04:05,910
Everyone is sitting over there.
Shall we go and chat there?

723
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:10,830
No, I won't go from here till
I finish your king. Play!

724
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,084
Are you alone?
- Absolutely.

725
01:04:18,857 --> 01:04:20,497
Are you facing much poverty?

726
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:26,475
Have you ever seen an elephant?
- Elephant? Why?

727
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:30,851
A dead elephant values more.
- So?

728
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:36,566
I am poor alive. But when
I'll die, I'll cost more.

729
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,548
You're trying to mock me?

730
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:42,437
I've never mocked anyone
except myself.

731
01:04:54,514 --> 01:04:57,573
What's this? Whose
picture is this?

732
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:00,949
His!

733
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:06,167
His? He can scared away
a buffalo with his stick.

734
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:07,838
Is this his portrait?

735
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:10,174
He can scare away a buffalo,..

736
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:11,800
..but he won't be able
to cut a straw.

737
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:15,326
I think he is very idle.

738
01:05:19,471 --> 01:05:21,080
What is this like a frog?

739
01:05:22,723 --> 01:05:25,270
It's not a frog; it's him.
Your companion.

740
01:05:26,975 --> 01:05:28,305
Are you crazy?

741
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:33,339
He can climb 3 floors in few
jumps, and you find him a frog?

742
01:05:33,803 --> 01:05:35,862
Have you ever seen a frog jumping?

743
01:05:37,789 --> 01:05:39,808
This is too much.

744
01:05:42,385 --> 01:05:45,444
And what is this? A cart
without the oxen?

745
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:57,404
He can pull a heavy cart
himself without the oxen.

746
01:05:58,052 --> 01:05:59,882
And you see him as a cart himself?

747
01:06:00,906 --> 01:06:04,170
Get yourself a pair of glasses.
You suffer from fogginess.

748
01:06:06,143 --> 01:06:09,341
Whose picture is this?
- Hers.

749
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:19,184
You're a crack! Does she look so
sad as you've made her to be?

750
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:22,731
Yes, she is just that.

751
01:06:23,785 --> 01:06:26,036
I don't see anything except..

752
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:29,403
..the pain of a burning
candle on her face.

753
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:32,450
I'm impressed.

754
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:35,140
I agree that this artist has very
penetrating eyes

755
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:38,742
He has known me totally.
- What did you say?

756
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:42,734
Speak! Why are you silent?

757
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,400
I am alive because I am
conditioned to remain silent.

758
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:57,736
I've been dumb from
birth till this day.

759
01:06:59,793 --> 01:07:02,727
The one who loses her father
before being born..

760
01:07:03,275 --> 01:07:07,267
..the one whose mother dies
after giving birth to her..

761
01:07:08,814 --> 01:07:11,083
..the one who learns to
speak in an orphanage..

762
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:15,355
..and who grows up on
the mercy of others..

763
01:07:16,656 --> 01:07:21,232
..only a good hearted person
will understand her sadness.

764
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:24,768
Shall I ask you something?

765
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:31,008
What is the reason for getting
you married to this old, cruel man?

766
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:36,677
For God's sake, don't say
that. He is my husband.

767
01:07:37,742 --> 01:07:40,141
Call him a social worker..

768
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:44,854
..a brother of the poor,
a charitable man.

769
01:07:46,476 --> 01:07:48,372
Don't call him a robber
of the youth.

770
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:54,233
I cannot forget that
day when I was..

771
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:59,944
..rehearsing the dance for the
charity show of my orphanage.

772
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:05,109
And this generous man
had come to give away..

773
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:08,883
..his body, soul and wealth
to better my life.

774
01:08:10,533 --> 01:08:13,113
Prema, are all the girls ready?
- Yes.

775
01:08:13,194 --> 01:08:14,594
Mr. Rai has come over.

776
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:16,938
It should look like a show.
There shouldn't be any flaws.

777
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:20,788
lf he is happy, our orphanage
will get to see good days.

778
01:08:21,783 --> 01:08:24,000
Hurry up! Mr. Rai has come.

779
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:28,534
Don't take it as a rehearsal. It
should look like a real show.

780
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:35,537
"No, no, no! Don't cut off
the plums from the tree"

781
01:09:35,673 --> 01:09:38,278
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

782
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,362
"You might be pricked by a thorn"

783
01:09:43,756 --> 01:09:46,761
"Don't leave the branch
with a jerk"

784
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:49,487
"Don't leave the branch
with a jerk"

785
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:53,464
"You might be pricked by a thorn"

786
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:23,353
"My father planted this tree, and
my brother looked after it"

787
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:26,362
"My brother looked after it"

788
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:32,701
"My mothered watered it like
a gardener waters flowers"

789
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:35,987
"Like a gardener waters flowers"

790
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:40,082
"Where have you come from,
o foreigner?"

791
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:44,314
"Where have you come from,
o foreigner?"

792
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,487
"And how did you catch
the branch?"

793
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:50,039
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

794
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:52,886
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

795
01:10:52,928 --> 01:10:57,024
"You might be pricked by a thorn"

796
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:25,671
"No one casts evil eyes. No
one dares to look at it"

797
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:28,876
"No one dares to look at it"

798
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:34,852
"These are the plums of Shabari;
no one can touch them"

799
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:38,370
"No one can touch them"

800
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:41,911
"Those who want to taste them"

801
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:46,322
"Those who want to taste them"

802
01:11:46,364 --> 01:11:48,537
"They won't be able to get them"

803
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:51,981
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

804
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,858
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

805
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,494
'You might be pricked by a thorn"

806
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:25,220
"She threw away the sour,
and kept the sweet ones"

807
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:27,729
"Shabari was very clever"

808
01:12:28,085 --> 01:12:30,917
"Shabari was very clever"

809
01:12:31,528 --> 01:12:34,540
"Laxman understood how much love..

810
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:37,215
..is filled in those
half eaten plums"

811
01:12:37,282 --> 01:12:40,206
"Laxman understood that"

812
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,158
"Only Ram will recognize me"

813
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:50,678
"Only Ram will recognize me.
I am a devotee of Ram"

814
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:54,059
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

815
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,904
"Don't cut off the plums
from the tree"

816
01:12:56,946 --> 01:13:00,998
"You might be pricked by a thorn"

817
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:04,887
"Don't leave the branch
with a jerk"

818
01:13:05,309 --> 01:13:07,689
"Don't leave the branch
with a jerk"

819
01:13:07,736 --> 01:13:12,299
'You might be pricked by a thorn"

820
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:48,404
So you want to marry
that girl, Prema?

821
01:13:48,885 --> 01:13:51,352
Yes, I want to serve
as much as I can.

822
01:13:52,014 --> 01:13:54,195
For how many days?
- You mean?

823
01:13:54,823 --> 01:13:57,086
I mean you are a very old man.

824
01:13:57,417 --> 01:13:59,816
You're using a very rude language.

825
01:14:00,146 --> 01:14:02,755
I might be, but I am
telling the truth.

826
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,189
I am just a few years
more than 50.

827
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:08,556
That means only a few
years less to 60.

828
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:10,582
Men older than him..

829
01:14:10,586 --> 01:14:12,971
Have been doing this stupidity!
I agree to that.

830
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:14,625
What do you have to
do with this matter?

831
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:19,168
Every living being called a human
is related to this evil.

832
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:21,991
Who are you to decide what
is right and what is wrong?

833
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,430
I will surely marry that
girl; no one can stop me.

834
01:14:26,114 --> 01:14:27,063
What's the matter?

835
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:29,705
The matter is that I don't
change my intentions.

836
01:14:30,358 --> 01:14:33,224
Can money make a person
so arrogant?

837
01:14:33,266 --> 01:14:35,601
I wouldn't want to be
insulted like this.

838
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:38,832
Tell me the way you want;
I will be available!

839
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:42,421
What is this rude behavior? I
cannot tolerate it any more.

840
01:14:42,832 --> 01:14:43,951
I will wait outside.

841
01:14:43,993 --> 01:14:46,392
What is the difference
between in and out?

842
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:51,044
The truth is the same in this
room as it is outside.

843
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:56,305
lf you take my advice, sail
the oceans if you dare.

844
01:14:56,762 --> 01:15:01,027
Lower down the mountains,
ruin the valleys.

845
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:04,859
But for God's sake, don't ruin
the lives of innocent girls.

846
01:15:06,072 --> 01:15:09,306
Had I sent you to arrange
for this piece of advice?

847
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:13,100
Where is that madam?
- She's gone to get your girl.

848
01:15:23,237 --> 01:15:24,634
What happened, Prema?

849
01:15:27,765 --> 01:15:29,935
You behave so strange
sometimes, uncle!

850
01:15:30,832 --> 01:15:34,272
The orphanage is filled with
hungry, poor, half dressed girls.

851
01:15:34,735 --> 01:15:37,760
lf one of them gets the
shelter of a rich man..

852
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:40,079
..wouldn't she be called
a lucky girl?

853
01:15:40,389 --> 01:15:43,282
That person is lucky who gets
love even when he is poor.

854
01:15:44,014 --> 01:15:47,639
And that one is unlucky
who have everything.

855
01:15:48,496 --> 01:15:51,360
This girl is being sold
for money, not love.

856
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:54,114
Poverty is nice to be
sung only in poems.

857
01:15:55,149 --> 01:15:58,727
The ups and downs of life cannot
be passed without money.

858
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:04,319
Prema, you're getting
a rich family.

859
01:16:05,156 --> 01:16:07,331
Good fortune is calling you.

860
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,346
This is not a day to cry,
but be happy.

861
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:13,487
Mr. Rai has given this
cheque of Rs. 1 lakh..

862
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,864
..after being impressed
by your beauty and dance.

863
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:21,902
So what if he is a bit
old? Forget that.

864
01:16:22,723 --> 01:16:25,386
This orphanage will never
forget this favor of yours.

865
01:16:25,907 --> 01:16:27,784
Humanity will always remember you.

866
01:16:29,192 --> 01:16:33,150
Look there. The helpless,
hungry faces.

867
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:36,146
Do you remember what hunger is?

868
01:16:36,517 --> 01:16:38,164
Perhaps you haven't
forgotten that.

869
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:49,087
What is a woman after all?
You tell us, Mr. Madan.

870
01:16:49,657 --> 01:16:53,224
The slave of a man.
- You are absolutely right.

871
01:16:53,252 --> 01:16:55,943
And do you know what her duty is?

872
01:16:56,232 --> 01:16:57,538
How do you know that?

873
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:02,250
It is to serve the man
and entertain him.

874
01:17:02,308 --> 01:17:03,435
Right.

875
01:17:03,606 --> 01:17:07,727
This is the reason why a man
spends lakhs of rupees on her.

876
01:17:08,543 --> 01:17:09,827
Just as I did.

877
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:14,131
But, Mr. Rai, you gave that money
to the orphanage in charity.

878
01:17:14,276 --> 01:17:15,502
And have married that girl.

879
01:17:16,362 --> 01:17:20,726
A rich man never gives money
in charity, he destroys it.

880
01:17:21,479 --> 01:17:23,396
I gave the money, and bought
the goods in exchange.

881
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:27,032
You've married, Mr. Rai.
And marriage is..

882
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,097
Don't you know what a marriage is?

883
01:17:30,154 --> 01:17:32,774
Marriage is a drama invented..

884
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:36,120
..by experienced people
to fool a girl.

885
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:38,872
Whether you marry or not..

886
01:17:38,914 --> 01:17:41,900
..the result will be
the same for a woman.

887
01:17:42,264 --> 01:17:44,094
Mr. Madan has said
a wonderful thing.

888
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:47,495
Whether with marriage
or without it..

889
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:49,686
..what is it that a
man wants after all?

890
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:55,054
Pretty face, nice figure,
and tempting style.

891
01:17:55,058 --> 01:17:59,259
Mr. Rai, I would have to praise
the show of that day.

892
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:03,709
Weren't you present that day?
- Call it my bad luck.

893
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:09,452
Why bad luck, mister? I've got
that thing in my house now.

894
01:18:10,704 --> 01:18:13,149
Prema! Prema!

895
01:18:17,825 --> 01:18:22,399
Didn't you hear?
- Yes, I heard everything.

896
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,727
How dare you behave like
this after hearing?

897
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,205
I am your wife.
- I've bought you!

898
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,013
But I am still your wife.

899
01:18:32,063 --> 01:18:37,724
I am not used to bear rejection,
especially in front of pals.

900
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:44,121
I request you; please,
don't degrade me.

901
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:48,197
To dance openly to gain
charity is good..

902
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,684
..and the same is degradation
in the house?

903
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:57,162
I was an orphan and helpless
then. But today I am your wife.

904
01:18:57,268 --> 01:19:01,697
A wife is a wife only till she
follows the orders of husband.

905
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:03,648
Come with me.

906
01:19:04,712 --> 01:19:09,946
Friends, meet her. She is my wife.

907
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:16,857
Have a look at each of her
styles, and praise my choice.

908
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,893
Show a glimpse of that
day to my friends.

909
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:29,286
Let them know that Mr. Rai
is an expert jeweler.

910
01:19:29,563 --> 01:19:31,076
Forget it, Mr. Rai.

911
01:19:31,403 --> 01:19:32,997
Your choice and expertise..

912
01:19:33,286 --> 01:19:35,772
..is already famous among
prestigious people.

913
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:41,001
No, this wife whom he has bought..

914
01:19:42,766 --> 01:19:44,756
..and your slave..

915
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:48,779
..will surely amuse you today.

916
01:20:00,674 --> 01:20:03,754
So, this is how you
burnt your dreams?

917
01:20:11,275 --> 01:20:16,007
Rama, I am warning you frequently.

918
01:20:17,342 --> 01:20:22,723
Don't sell yourself
for this trouble..

919
01:20:24,163 --> 01:20:27,905
..by calling it your duty.

920
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:39,197
It is easy to advise, but
difficult to follow the same.

921
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:43,352
lf you really sympathize with
her, pay back my money.

922
01:20:45,325 --> 01:20:48,122
I am ready to kill my
desires and love.

923
01:20:48,462 --> 01:20:54,610
You are a wolf greedy of money,
in the guise of a man.

924
01:20:55,538 --> 01:20:58,683
You don't have a heart of a
human, but of a businessman.

925
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:01,318
Why do you call it love?

926
01:21:03,015 --> 01:21:04,977
Will you teach me what love is?

927
01:21:07,076 --> 01:21:08,927
You who has insulted love?

928
01:21:09,737 --> 01:21:11,670
The one who has killed
his own wife..

929
01:21:13,213 --> 01:21:15,446
..will teach me the
secret of love?

930
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:19,501
It's false! This is false!
- No, it is true.

931
01:21:20,286 --> 01:21:23,664
The world and all the government
records prove it..

932
01:21:24,103 --> 01:21:30,532
..that you trapped an innocent
girl in your love..

933
01:21:30,613 --> 01:21:33,130
..married her, and
then you wanted..

934
01:21:33,211 --> 01:21:35,604
..to make money by
selling her body.

935
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:40,781
When she refused, you cut her
body into pieces and threw away.

936
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:43,432
You are talking about love?

937
01:21:44,143 --> 01:21:45,628
It is false!

938
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:50,086
False! False!

939
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:51,599
What is this going on?

940
01:21:51,998 --> 01:21:54,617
This is the house of a decent
man, not some market..

941
01:21:54,836 --> 01:21:59,862
What this man is saying is false.
It's a false accusation.

942
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:04,477
People might call me disloyal
and a murderer,..

943
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,668
..but it is not true.

944
01:22:07,535 --> 01:22:12,536
I haven't killed my wife.
I only loved her.

945
01:22:16,782 --> 01:22:20,196
Gopa! If this is the truth..

946
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:24,905
..if I've really loved you..

947
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,903
..free me of this accusation
of murder.

948
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:38,501
I am telling the truth.
I was not born to be a goon.

949
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,921
Never did I wish to snatch
away anyone's happiness.

950
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:47,878
I always wanted to see
every one happy.

951
01:22:49,817 --> 01:22:52,056
Mine was a simple life.

952
01:22:54,164 --> 01:22:58,286
I had only one dream,
only one song.

953
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:02,984
That dream was realized.

954
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:10,299
That song, I sang it
after I married Gopa.

955
01:23:40,656 --> 01:23:44,719
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

956
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:48,215
"The river unites with the sea"

957
01:23:48,567 --> 01:23:54,257
"No one knows which waters
the sea unites with"

958
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:58,244
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

959
01:23:58,538 --> 01:24:01,712
"The river unites with the sea"

960
01:24:01,942 --> 01:24:07,017
"No one knows which waters
the sea unites with"

961
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:11,510
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

962
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,728
''The earth is thirsty of sun."

963
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:35,346
"And the moon is thirsty of earth"

964
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:38,571
'Moon is thirsty of earth"

965
01:24:38,856 --> 01:24:45,260
"Every soul is thirsty, like
the oyster in the water"

966
01:24:45,391 --> 01:24:48,033
"Every soul is thirsty"

967
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:53,494
"O dear pal."

968
01:24:53,498 --> 01:24:59,977
"Every soul is thirsty, like
the oyster in the water"

969
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:05,363
"No one knows which cloud the
drop of water is hiding in"

970
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:09,904
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

971
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:13,310
"The river unites with the sea"

972
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:18,488
"No one knows which waters
the sea unites with"

973
01:25:18,684 --> 01:25:22,966
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

974
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:46,246
"You recognize the song
on the unfamiliar lips"

975
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:49,413
"You recognize the song"

976
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:55,949
"The one who was stranger till
yesterday is now my soul-mate"

977
01:25:56,348 --> 01:25:59,011
"She is now my soul-mate"

978
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:04,228
"O dear pal."

979
01:26:04,505 --> 01:26:10,605
"The one who was stranger till
yesterday is now my soul-mate"

980
01:26:10,849 --> 01:26:16,173
'No one knows what might
happen at what moment"

981
01:26:16,441 --> 01:26:20,690
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

982
01:26:20,771 --> 01:26:23,761
"The river unites with the sea"

983
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:29,360
"No one knows which waters
the sea unites with"

984
01:26:29,441 --> 01:26:33,620
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

985
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:05,458
I've married you.

986
01:27:08,024 --> 01:27:10,793
How do you feel?
- Nice.

987
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:15,725
Gopa, the place where
I've brought you..

988
01:27:15,767 --> 01:27:16,995
..is the highest in village.

989
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,459
There are rivers on all sides.

990
01:27:23,388 --> 01:27:24,928
What is beyond them?

991
01:27:25,777 --> 01:27:27,397
Gardens, orchards.

992
01:27:29,456 --> 01:27:32,388
And beyond them?
- Mountains.

993
01:27:33,287 --> 01:27:35,277
And beyond them?
- More mountains.

994
01:27:36,271 --> 01:27:38,795
And beyond them?
- Beyond them..

995
01:27:57,025 --> 01:27:58,877
I've spent many nights
in this place.

996
01:28:00,224 --> 01:28:05,183
But the this night is
so intoxicating! Right?

997
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,079
Raindrops are falling.

998
01:28:56,436 --> 01:28:59,110
Looks like it will rain.

999
01:29:27,496 --> 01:29:29,483
I.. I will be right back..

1000
01:29:29,487 --> 01:29:32,413
..after closing the doors and
windows of that bungalow.

1001
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:08,923
Gopa, have you ever
dreamt of anything?

1002
01:31:11,709 --> 01:31:13,072
Yes, I did once.

1003
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:14,569
About what?

1004
01:31:31,014 --> 01:31:35,419
Is anyone in there? Watchman!
Watchman!

1005
01:31:36,304 --> 01:31:38,465
Watchman!

1006
01:31:40,137 --> 01:31:42,244
Who can that wretched
be at this hour?

1007
01:31:53,858 --> 01:31:56,019
Are you the watchman of
that Daak bungalow?

1008
01:31:56,704 --> 01:31:57,118
Yes.

1009
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,119
We called you so many times.
Were you asleep?

1010
01:32:00,567 --> 01:32:04,994
No, sir, I was not asleep. -
Come and open the bungalow then.

1011
01:32:05,431 --> 01:32:06,916
Bungalow?
- Yes.

1012
01:32:07,465 --> 01:32:09,891
But it is booked. Some officers
are going to come.

1013
01:32:09,973 --> 01:32:12,413
When? - Don't know. They might
come in the morning.

1014
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:15,264
Morning, right?
- We can stay here tonight then.

1015
01:32:16,362 --> 01:32:17,417
I don't have the orders, sir.

1016
01:32:18,106 --> 01:32:21,253
You don't have the orders?
But I do.

1017
01:32:24,944 --> 01:32:29,578
lf you have the permission,
who can stop you?

1018
01:32:30,501 --> 01:32:35,930
All right. - Listen! What
is your name? - Baldev.

1019
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:39,179
Baldev, we are very hungry.
Arrange some meal for us.

1020
01:32:39,572 --> 01:32:41,666
But there is no arrangement
for food over here.

1021
01:32:41,934 --> 01:32:44,325
How can that be? How will
we spend the night?

1022
01:32:44,877 --> 01:32:46,431
How would I know that, sir?

1023
01:32:47,072 --> 01:32:49,612
There's a shop down at the
village. You can go there.

1024
01:32:50,253 --> 01:32:51,457
How do you cook?

1025
01:32:53,283 --> 01:32:57,526
What about me? I used to
cook myself till now.

1026
01:32:57,803 --> 01:32:59,702
You won't cook now?
- Now?

1027
01:33:02,024 --> 01:33:03,725
I won't cook at least tonight.

1028
01:33:04,066 --> 01:33:06,402
Why? What's the matter
with tonight?

1029
01:33:15,895 --> 01:33:17,146
Don't know who they are.

1030
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:18,641
Why have they dropped
in at present?

1031
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,585
They might be government
officers, but they are hungry.

1032
01:33:23,032 --> 01:33:26,654
So? - So? If they are hungry,
they should get food.

1033
01:33:26,759 --> 01:33:28,623
Are we doing some charity here?

1034
01:33:29,341 --> 01:33:33,470
We are lucky that
someone has come..

1035
01:33:33,512 --> 01:33:36,985
..to our house on the first
night of our marriage.

1036
01:33:44,052 --> 01:33:45,213
Gopa!

1037
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:31,629
"You will meet the bride.
O heart, have patience"

1038
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:36,595
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

1039
01:34:36,964 --> 01:34:40,026
"O heart, have patience"

1040
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:48,572
"You will meet the bride.
O heart, have patience"

1041
01:35:14,405 --> 01:35:18,975
"She's a fairy, she's playful,
she's stolen your heart"

1042
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:25,887
"She's a fairy, she's playful,
she's stolen your heart"

1043
01:35:26,498 --> 01:35:30,688
"I will see her face
till the morning"

1044
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:35,110
"You will get to see
a pretty woman"

1045
01:35:35,727 --> 01:35:38,501
"O heart, have patience"

1046
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:43,889
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

1047
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:47,161
"O heart, have patience"

1048
01:36:09,758 --> 01:36:14,474
"Why are you restless? You have
the rest of the night"

1049
01:36:16,892 --> 01:36:21,283
"Why are you restless? You have
the rest of the night"

1050
01:36:21,612 --> 01:36:25,692
"Talk to her to your heart's
content then"

1051
01:36:25,881 --> 01:36:30,059
"Her black hair will be
lying on your shoulders"

1052
01:36:30,906 --> 01:36:33,954
"O heart, have patience"

1053
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:38,988
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

1054
01:36:39,219 --> 01:36:42,125
"O heart, have patience"

1055
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:03,040
"She is your queen, and you
are a handsome Rajput"

1056
01:37:05,532 --> 01:37:09,798
"She is your queen, and you
are a handsome Rajput"

1057
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:14,471
"You are gutsy, so also
have a strong heart"

1058
01:37:14,513 --> 01:37:19,472
"Our eyes will meet"

1059
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:22,712
"O heart, have patience"

1060
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,798
"You will be embracing
her silver body"

1061
01:37:27,855 --> 01:37:30,908
"O heart, have patience"

1062
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:39,473
"You will meet the bride.
O heart, have patience"

1063
01:37:44,963 --> 01:37:46,394
I've come, sir.

1064
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:52,067
I got late as I could not
find some vegetables. Here.

1065
01:37:52,295 --> 01:37:53,794
Doesn't matter.

1066
01:37:54,757 --> 01:37:57,107
Keep it with you; it is a tip.
- A tip?

1067
01:37:57,857 --> 01:38:00,368
Yes, it is a prize for you.

1068
01:38:02,988 --> 01:38:04,274
Thank you very much, sir.

1069
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,436
Did you find anything?
- Yes, sir.

1070
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:11,851
There's hen, eggs, onions,
potatoes. I found every thing.

1071
01:38:11,978 --> 01:38:13,126
Very good.

1072
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,283
How do I cook it?

1073
01:38:16,901 --> 01:38:18,359
How do I cook these things?

1074
01:38:18,527 --> 01:38:21,957
Don't worry about that.
Your wife will cook it.

1075
01:38:24,305 --> 01:38:27,207
My wife?
- Yes, your wife had come..

1076
01:38:27,224 --> 01:38:29,412
..to arrange for
water and lights.

1077
01:38:30,171 --> 01:38:31,566
We've explained her everything.

1078
01:38:32,555 --> 01:38:35,919
We will eat whatever she
cooks. You can go.

1079
01:38:37,315 --> 01:38:39,234
Ok, sir.
- Listen!

1080
01:38:40,213 --> 01:38:42,514
Yes, sir.
- Keep this.

1081
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:45,439
Cast evil eyes away from your
wife. This is from me.

1082
01:38:46,803 --> 01:38:49,992
This, sir? But this
is too much, sir.

1083
01:38:50,461 --> 01:38:53,161
Baldev, I am very happy
today. Keep it.

1084
01:38:54,675 --> 01:38:56,917
What was the need for that, sir?

1085
01:38:58,747 --> 01:39:01,924
Take it.
- Thank your very much, sir.

1086
01:39:07,366 --> 01:39:08,448
Gopa!

1087
01:39:10,182 --> 01:39:11,021
Gopa!

1088
01:39:15,164 --> 01:39:16,487
Gopa!

1089
01:39:16,556 --> 01:39:19,757
Don't touch me.
- Gopa?

1090
01:39:21,256 --> 01:39:23,472
Stay away! Stay away!

1091
01:39:25,453 --> 01:39:29,911
What happened, Gopa?
- I.. I am robbed.

1092
01:39:32,838 --> 01:39:34,325
What did you say?

1093
01:39:38,715 --> 01:39:39,840
They robbed me.

1094
01:39:42,492 --> 01:39:44,111
I am robbed.

1095
01:39:45,338 --> 01:39:48,228
Stay away. Don't touch me.

1096
01:39:49,592 --> 01:39:55,860
Now I have nothing to
give you. Nothing.

1097
01:39:57,415 --> 01:40:00,886
No! Gopa! Gopa!

1098
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:17,348
Why are you laughing?
I am very hungry.

1099
01:40:17,946 --> 01:40:21,968
Hungry.. hungry..
take a cigarette..

1100
01:40:22,941 --> 01:40:24,065
Baldev?

1101
01:40:30,433 --> 01:40:31,918
Come, Baldev, come.

1102
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,786
You must have worked very hard.
You must be tired.

1103
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:38,335
Come and drink some liquor.

1104
01:40:44,558 --> 01:40:50,039
Baldev, drink some.. and your
tiredness will be gone.

1105
01:40:54,436 --> 01:40:57,993
Your wife must have been very
happy to receive this big tip.

1106
01:40:58,043 --> 01:40:59,027
Yes..

1107
01:40:59,443 --> 01:41:00,332
Baldev.

1108
01:41:01,335 --> 01:41:06,058
..and she has sent me
to repay for that.

1109
01:42:07,781 --> 01:42:09,673
Perhaps I hurt your feelings.

1110
01:42:13,308 --> 01:42:15,036
Why did you come up like this?

1111
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:18,119
I did not even want
to tell my story.

1112
01:42:20,653 --> 01:42:23,245
No matter how bad people
consider me..

1113
01:42:24,934 --> 01:42:27,781
..I don't want to show
my sorrows to anyone.

1114
01:42:30,209 --> 01:42:31,715
But I could not bear
the harassment..

1115
01:42:31,757 --> 01:42:34,281
..of that man on you and
I poured out my feelings.

1116
01:42:48,743 --> 01:42:52,357
Gopa!
- I am not Gopa.

1117
01:42:55,563 --> 01:43:00,885
I see my Gopa in your face.

1118
01:43:03,655 --> 01:43:07,208
I had understood that.
I knew this.

1119
01:43:08,178 --> 01:43:15,809
I will blind every evil
eye that is cast on you.

1120
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:23,343
I will save my Gopa from the
world and hide her in my arms.

1121
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:27,169
My heart is restless.

1122
01:43:27,325 --> 01:43:29,122
Gopa!

1123
01:43:29,218 --> 01:43:31,822
My brother!
- Don't call me brother.

1124
01:43:32,062 --> 01:43:36,319
Look into my eyes. You will
find that I am not your Gopa.

1125
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:41,641
You're not Gopa?

1126
01:43:44,823 --> 01:43:48,849
Yes, Gopa is dead.

1127
01:43:52,412 --> 01:43:54,033
Gopa is dead.

1128
01:43:55,378 --> 01:43:57,130
Gopa is dead.

1129
01:43:58,044 --> 01:43:59,704
Gopa is dead.

1130
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:10,487
Whose portrait are you making?

1131
01:45:11,664 --> 01:45:13,994
The face is the same, but
the clothes have changed.

1132
01:45:15,173 --> 01:45:16,168
I wanted to see..

1133
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:17,865
..how this face might look
in a villager's outfits.

1134
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:28,680
What happened? Why
are you surprised?

1135
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:49,576
Gopa!

1136
01:45:56,825 --> 01:45:58,758
With the passion
of a sad heart..

1137
01:45:59,574 --> 01:46:04,028
..you killed so many innocents
to revenge for one woman.

1138
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:07,229
So?
- I think you are once again..

1139
01:46:07,271 --> 01:46:10,186
..trapped in such situation
after coming to this house.

1140
01:46:10,767 --> 01:46:13,200
You are no longer able
to bear tyranny.

1141
01:46:14,221 --> 01:46:15,697
Don't know what you might do..

1142
01:46:15,739 --> 01:46:18,142
..by seeing another woman
being tormented.

1143
01:46:18,614 --> 01:46:19,957
Why don't you know that?

1144
01:46:20,923 --> 01:46:25,086
I will fire bullets in that
man's chest and take away his life.

1145
01:46:25,938 --> 01:46:28,929
The quarrel will end then.
- It does not end the quarrel.

1146
01:46:30,574 --> 01:46:32,288
His responsibility will
remain as usual.

1147
01:46:33,117 --> 01:46:35,108
A lawyer is also present here.

1148
01:46:38,284 --> 01:46:41,195
Then I will have to rob
these rich people.

1149
01:46:41,932 --> 01:46:43,571
How will that help either?

1150
01:46:44,247 --> 01:46:46,806
One cannot repay debts
with the robbed money.

1151
01:46:47,521 --> 01:46:49,234
The government will want to
see the account.

1152
01:46:50,673 --> 01:46:52,752
Then? - Then I feel Mr.
Madan will also..

1153
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:57,015
..sacrifice that girl's
life like Mr. Rai did.

1154
01:46:57,057 --> 01:46:58,409
What are you blabbering?

1155
01:46:58,516 --> 01:46:59,986
How can he do that till
Baldev is alive?

1156
01:47:00,028 --> 01:47:03,121
You are stubborn;
you can't think.

1157
01:47:04,915 --> 01:47:08,748
You are clever; you tell me.
Is there some trick?

1158
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:17,444
There is. Kill me.
- Kill you? Why?

1159
01:47:18,738 --> 01:47:22,173
Because my body is useless and
my dead body is valuable.

1160
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:26,391
You have gone crazy. Who will
benefit from your death?

1161
01:47:29,325 --> 01:47:30,567
Baldev..

1162
01:47:32,756 --> 01:47:35,021
..according to my uncle's will..

1163
01:47:35,231 --> 01:47:38,527
..I will get big amount after
one month of my marriage.

1164
01:47:39,502 --> 01:47:41,860
And what if you are not
destined to marry?

1165
01:47:43,135 --> 01:47:45,621
I can still write this wealth
to anyone's name.

1166
01:47:46,362 --> 01:47:48,790
But she will get that amount
only after my death.

1167
01:47:49,904 --> 01:47:51,728
lf I write my wealth
to that girl's name..

1168
01:47:52,051 --> 01:47:53,937
..she will be freed
of this trouble.

1169
01:47:54,644 --> 01:47:57,737
Then write your will, and
fire a bullet on yourself.

1170
01:47:58,256 --> 01:47:59,939
Why do you want me to be
responsible for this murder?

1171
01:48:01,126 --> 01:48:06,996
I fear that my suicide
might blot her name.

1172
01:48:08,033 --> 01:48:09,624
Otherwise I wouldn't
have flattered you.

1173
01:48:11,465 --> 01:48:13,932
Silly, you want to
give your life..

1174
01:48:13,968 --> 01:48:15,938
..for a girl you've met just 3
- 4 hours back?

1175
01:48:17,554 --> 01:48:19,348
Even a meeting of
a few moments..

1176
01:48:19,445 --> 01:48:20,900
..is enough to give one's life.

1177
01:48:21,585 --> 01:48:23,848
Do what you are told,
and go away from here.

1178
01:48:24,772 --> 01:48:25,829
Fire the bullet.

1179
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:30,002
Bullets have become quite
expensive these days.

1180
01:48:32,027 --> 01:48:35,486
Look, Baldev, if you won't
kill me, I will kill you.

1181
01:48:36,876 --> 01:48:39,867
lf I succeed, the prize on
you will save that girl.

1182
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:43,622
lf I die, she will
get my wealth.

1183
01:48:45,485 --> 01:48:47,748
She will get over her
trouble both ways.

1184
01:48:48,444 --> 01:48:49,855
So, what do you say?

1185
01:48:55,204 --> 01:48:56,502
Stupid!

1186
01:48:57,391 --> 01:48:58,822
He is so stupid!

1187
01:49:00,849 --> 01:49:01,907
What's the matter?

1188
01:49:04,845 --> 01:49:06,927
Tonight is a very
peculiar night.

1189
01:49:07,227 --> 01:49:10,133
This painter wants to give
his life in charity.

1190
01:49:10,592 --> 01:49:11,854
For whom?

1191
01:49:14,023 --> 01:49:15,465
For the goddess who has..

1192
01:49:15,661 --> 01:49:18,778
..come down on this earth
in the form of a woman.

1193
01:49:19,727 --> 01:49:23,979
The decency of whom provokes
a man to act pious.

1194
01:49:24,938 --> 01:49:30,995
To save whom a mere servant
pointed a gun at me.

1195
01:49:31,661 --> 01:49:34,476
I am ready myself to kill
that businessman.

1196
01:49:35,531 --> 01:49:39,125
This crazy man is eager to
sacrifice his life for her.

1197
01:49:43,570 --> 01:49:45,419
Chief! Chief!

1198
01:49:47,223 --> 01:49:49,276
Beware! Chief!

1199
01:49:49,577 --> 01:49:52,496
One of the hostages is missing.
- Who?

1200
01:49:52,868 --> 01:49:56,299
That servant, Ramdas.
- Ramdas? - Chief!

1201
01:50:00,807 --> 01:50:02,560
Sir! Sir!

1202
01:50:02,959 --> 01:50:06,148
There's a prize of Rs. 1.25 lakhs
to get Baldev arrested, right?

1203
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,340
Yes. - Come with me quickly,
sir. - Where?

1204
01:50:09,936 --> 01:50:11,843
To the house of Mr.
Dwarkaprasad. - But who are you?

1205
01:50:12,266 --> 01:50:14,130
I am his servant. Please,
come fast.

1206
01:50:14,172 --> 01:50:17,159
Or that goon will escape and
I won't get the prize.

1207
01:50:17,224 --> 01:50:19,684
lf he really is goon Baldev, he
might have already escaped.

1208
01:50:19,804 --> 01:50:21,249
No, sir, he won't. I tell you,..

1209
01:50:21,330 --> 01:50:23,385
..sir, this is the opportunity.
Come fast.

1210
01:50:23,443 --> 01:50:26,007
What proof do you have that the
man in your house is Baldev?

1211
01:50:26,697 --> 01:50:31,182
See this, sir. He
is Baldev, right?

1212
01:50:31,477 --> 01:50:34,471
Yes, but there might be someone
else who looks like him.

1213
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:37,039
We've been misled before
by wrong information.

1214
01:50:37,426 --> 01:50:39,359
It was me who was misled.

1215
01:50:39,778 --> 01:50:41,557
lf I had not been injured
by a bullet..

1216
01:50:41,665 --> 01:50:43,557
..I would have brought
his dead body.

1217
01:50:43,954 --> 01:50:47,315
Many people have dreamt of
killing Baldev for the prize.

1218
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:49,788
Go! Why do you bother yourself?

1219
01:50:51,385 --> 01:50:53,425
Ramdas! Ramdas!

1220
01:50:54,425 --> 01:50:57,300
What happened? What is
going on in this house?

1221
01:50:57,681 --> 01:50:58,796
Someone tell me.

1222
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,073
Ramdas! Ramdas!

1223
01:51:03,026 --> 01:51:05,820
Chief, we should leave before
that servant comes back.

1224
01:51:06,151 --> 01:51:08,366
We are in danger.
- Let's move fast, chief.

1225
01:51:08,844 --> 01:51:10,411
Why should we put ourselves
in danger?

1226
01:51:10,928 --> 01:51:12,687
Ramdas is not in the house.

1227
01:51:13,749 --> 01:51:15,346
Where has he gone?
- Don't know.

1228
01:51:15,544 --> 01:51:17,854
I hope he is not gone
to inform the police.

1229
01:51:19,281 --> 01:51:23,795
Will my loyal people defame
me in this old age?

1230
01:51:23,931 --> 01:51:26,835
Please, go. I request
you to leave.

1231
01:51:34,843 --> 01:51:37,333
I want to settle some
account before I leave.

1232
01:51:38,026 --> 01:51:41,017
No, Ramdas does not
want to kill you.

1233
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:46,119
That good man could not think
of any other way to save me.

1234
01:51:50,191 --> 01:51:51,589
Let that old man come.

1235
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:53,148
In his zeal to save me..

1236
01:51:53,167 --> 01:51:56,906
..he forgot that he is playing
with someone else's life.

1237
01:51:57,469 --> 01:52:00,935
Have mercy on me. Go away from
here before the police come.

1238
01:52:03,474 --> 01:52:05,638
The moment of decision has come.

1239
01:52:07,194 --> 01:52:09,719
I will have to settle
the account today.

1240
01:52:16,714 --> 01:52:18,635
Before some time..

1241
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:22,904
..I wanted to kill you and
settle all your accounts.

1242
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:27,063
But perhaps it is not
in my fate to kill you.

1243
01:52:31,174 --> 01:52:34,501
Give me the car keys. - Why?
- I said give me the keys!

1244
01:52:37,647 --> 01:52:40,740
Here, you all move from here
fast. - But you, chief?

1245
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:43,706
I still have to settle
an account.

1246
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,241
No, chief, we won't leave you..
- Go!

1247
01:52:53,123 --> 01:52:54,611
Why are you getting involved
in this give and take..

1248
01:52:54,653 --> 01:52:58,247
..and putting your life
in danger? Go away.

1249
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:03,354
I request you, I beg of you; you
still have a chance. Run away.

1250
01:53:05,732 --> 01:53:07,028
Wait.

1251
01:53:28,614 --> 01:53:30,722
Inspector, arrest
that wicked man.

1252
01:53:31,877 --> 01:53:33,583
Where is that goon?

1253
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:36,998
Where is Baldev?
- He escaped. - Escaped?

1254
01:53:37,203 --> 01:53:38,822
Where did he run away?

1255
01:53:38,888 --> 01:53:41,822
Don't know. He ran away
in Mr. Rai's car.

1256
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:45,362
Where did he run away?
How did he run away?

1257
01:53:46,133 --> 01:53:47,985
And why did you
let him run away?

1258
01:53:48,732 --> 01:53:53,716
Rama, I risked my life to
save you from trouble.

1259
01:53:54,364 --> 01:53:58,580
And you want to give your
life to that businessman?

1260
01:53:59,121 --> 01:54:00,494
What have you done, child?

1261
01:54:01,379 --> 01:54:06,666
Tell me. Did he cheat or were
you fooled yourself?

1262
01:54:11,475 --> 01:54:14,285
There he is! Inspector,
catch him..

1263
01:54:14,876 --> 01:54:16,108
Catch him!

1264
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:47,218
Baldev, you are being
surrounded from all sides.

1265
01:54:47,684 --> 01:54:50,183
lf you surrender to us..

1266
01:54:50,579 --> 01:54:52,676
..you might be saved
from death sentence.

1267
01:54:53,294 --> 01:54:57,482
It is useless to run away.
You cannot escape now.

1268
01:54:58,219 --> 01:55:02,384
It will be better for you to
surrender than dying a dog's death.

1269
01:55:02,718 --> 01:55:05,771
I tell you again, surrender
yourself to us.

1270
01:55:30,518 --> 01:55:33,717
Please, go. I request
you to leave.

1271
01:55:37,986 --> 01:55:39,976
I will repay for my master's
favors today.

1272
01:55:40,334 --> 01:55:43,656
And will repay his debt with
the prize being declared on you.

1273
01:56:29,561 --> 01:56:32,627
No power on this earth could
have controlled me.

1274
01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:39,844
But it is a coincidence
that my pistol got empty.

1275
01:56:42,051 --> 01:56:43,357
But there are bullets in it.

1276
01:56:45,206 --> 01:56:49,367
Have you settled the account
you wanted to?

1277
01:56:50,718 --> 01:56:55,433
Yes, all of it except one.

1278
01:57:13,626 --> 01:57:18,080
Sir, will Ramdas get the prize
for getting me arrested?

1279
01:57:18,164 --> 01:57:19,555
Yes, he surely will.

1280
01:57:20,544 --> 01:57:22,159
Just a minute, sir.

1281
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:36,191
I see that the one who used
to call everyone stupid..

1282
01:57:36,821 --> 01:57:39,537
..has proved himself to
be the most stupid.

1283
01:57:44,124 --> 01:57:48,544
Can I ask for
something today? Will you?

1284
01:57:48,834 --> 01:57:53,941
Whatever you'll ask today,
Baldev, I will give.

1285
01:57:56,377 --> 01:58:01,080
I want to take one
of those pictures.

1286
01:58:02,608 --> 01:58:06,201
I knew that. Take it.

1287
01:58:32,598 --> 01:58:35,002
Sir, take me from here quickly.

1288
01:59:43,623 --> 01:59:45,195
What did he take from you?

1289
01:59:47,769 --> 01:59:49,093
His Gopa.

1290
01:59:50,277 --> 01:59:54,465
Simple and truthful people have
always been sacrificed.

1291
01:59:55,157 --> 02:00:00,575
"My beats unite with the
waters of the river"

1292
02:00:01,342 --> 02:00:06,702
"The river unites with the sea"

1293
02:00:07,046 --> 02:00:15,478
"No one knows which waters
the sea unites with"
