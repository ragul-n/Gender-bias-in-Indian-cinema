1
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,048
22 years earlier in Bombay...

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,338
'Hyderabad' What is the problem?

3
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,532
Deliver 2 eggs there

4
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,141
I am Basha speaking.

5
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,785
How are you doing Basha?

6
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,127
You don't worry.

7
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,688
I will sacrifice my life to
protect Brother's son.

8
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,799
You come here.

9
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,461
I will come.

10
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,700
Was it a call from Basha?

11
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,305
No, my friend called.

12
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,572
Why are you crying man?
Is your father dead?

13
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,709
Tell me the truth.
Where is the boy?

14
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,252
I am telling you the truth.
Believe me, I don't know.

15
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,580
You lame! Have you also
started acting smart?

16
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,258
Tell me, where's the boy?

17
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,720
Tell me.
- I don't know.

18
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,666
I don't know sir.

19
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,199
Tell me the truth.
Where is the boy?

20
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,929
I don't know, leave me.
- Tell me, where is the boy?

21
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,597
Go to hell, I will not tell,
bloody rogue.

22
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,669
Take reverse...go back.

23
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,918
Did you see a little boy here?

24
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,929
I put him to sleep under the wraps next
to a beggar. - No sir.

25
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,390
Covered in a wrap!
- We didn't see sir.

26
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,409
Tell me, where is the boy?
- I don't know.

27
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,576
Don't act smart.
Look over there.

28
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,683
What are you looking at?
Come on tell me.

29
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,497
Will you push a man
under a speeding lorry?

30
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,933
Catch him...take him.

31
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,302
The accused Anwar Khan pushed
a man, known as Mohammad Ghouse.

32
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,374
...intentionally & killed him which has
been proved beyond doubt,

33
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,776
this court sentences him
to life imprisonment.

34
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,617
He is an orphan child, sir.

35
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,316
He is struggling for existence,
help him sir.

36
00:04:53,993 --> 00:05:02,628
Brother Shankar...

37
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,886
Where is the boy?

38
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,419
I didn't get the boy,
but found these 2 men.

39
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,657
What will I do with them?

40
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,890
Where have you hidden the boy?

41
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,557
Come on tell me, where is the boy?

42
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,826
Tell me, where is the boy?

43
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,102
Before, I...come on, speak up.

44
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,908
Anwar is cooling his
heels in a jail, isn't he?

45
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,372
Come on tell me,
where is the boy?

46
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,913
Where is the boy, tell me?

47
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,785
You owe allegiance to me,
aren't you fool?

48
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,716
You dog! Barking at
the owner himself.

49
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,789
Hold the stone ....
Come on do it.

50
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,016
What are you looking at?

51
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,726
Come on hold it,
do it fast, bloody.

52
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,588
Come on do it...

53
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,861
No...no...Ieave him...
Leave him please.

54
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,127
Don't kill him. I beg of you.
Leave him.

55
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,534
Hey you...

56
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,713
I want the boy.

57
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,155
Why are you feeling sad son?

58
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,150
At this young age, you've become
proud owner of this hut.

59
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,117
Don't worry.

60
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,499
Why are you struggling so much?

61
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,964
Am I not here to take you
as my concubine?

62
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,800
Leave me.

63
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,903
I will rebuild your hut.
- Leave me.

64
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,711
Who is that?

65
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,663
PRESENT...

66
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,534
Listen. Vacate this
place immediately.

67
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,629
This locality belongs to
Muneer Bhai from today.

68
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,912
What do you want to have?
Idly or Vada?

69
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:09,774
We don't want anything.

70
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,109
It's long time since we heard your song.
Sing a song please.

71
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,047
Shall I?

72
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,977
Don't call me, dear.

73
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,984
Don't get angry, dear,

74
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:24,661
before a group of people,
0 my dear!

75
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,262
Why no one is caring
about my threat?

76
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,133
You warned them in Hindi.
They wouldn't have understood.

77
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,327
I am telling you in Telugu.

78
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,132
This locality belongs to
Muneer Bhai from today.

79
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,568
You must vacate this place
by tonight. Got it?

80
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,144
This is Nagarjuna's hair style.

81
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,282
Now you are like Nagarjuna
in film 'Manmadhudu'.

82
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,619
Are these freshly prepared?

83
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,845
Why would I serve you fresh?
They're day before yesterday's.

84
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,250
Don't they understand Telugu also?

85
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,029
Didn't you also get me?

86
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,831
Who is this Munna?

87
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,334
Is it painful brother?

88
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,343
When you are not able
to bear the pain?

89
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,218
He is a little boy.
How painful it must be for him?

90
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,980
Who are you?
- Your boss!

91
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,647
I am the big boss for
you and your ilk.

92
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,880
Leave me, bloody.

93
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,082
I will kill you.

94
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,888
Bloody, I will kill you.

95
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,840
Hey, remember two things clearly.

96
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,440
One, if you or this man
come here again,

97
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,771
you will also become impotents.

98
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,240
Two...

99
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:27,912
I have forgotten it.

100
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,183
I will tell you as soon as
I remember. Go.

101
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,053
Kill him boys.

102
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:59,033
No...no...no...buddy no.

103
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:04,633
I am a man of heart.
I am a man of courage.

104
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,706
My heart is loaded
with gun powder.

105
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,607
When I fire, any one
will bite the dust.

106
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,619
Rip them apart...
Pin them down.

107
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,616
If you get excited & throw challenges...
you are finished.

108
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,321
You all are my people.

109
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,262
I will stand by you
through thick & thin.

110
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:09,607
I will lend personally my hand
as a support to you.

111
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,703
I stubbornly believe,
nothing is impossible.

112
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,138
I am the fear of death
to my detractors.

113
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,474
If they beat you,
scold them.

114
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,116
If they beat again,.
pay in their own coin.

115
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,879
Once you enter the arena,
knock the doors of victory.

116
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,783
See with your heart,
make friends.

117
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,786
Live united.

118
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:41,358
There are only two divisions
in men, good & bad.

119
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:47,299
Come friends.
Let befriend the good.

120
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,437
Don't back off saying it's difficult
or you will lose.

121
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,577
Turn yourself into a raging fire.

122
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,577
Become a thunder and
strike like a lightening.

123
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,444
March forward like a thunderbolt.

124
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,449
Pounce like a leopard and
rip open the enemies.

125
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,452
Show them the power
of a Telugu man.

126
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,870
Study well & grow up to
become a great man.

127
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,005
I am his father to decide
about his education.

128
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,205
Is he going to give deliverance to
any one with his education?

129
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,878
I will study well and
buy a color T.V., father.

130
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,206
Well-said son

131
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,808
Are you paying for his education?
Munna is taking care of everything.

132
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,315
Who is this Munna to decide?

133
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:08,142
Mother, urine

134
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,651
No son, say I want to answer
nature's call.- Go.

135
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,018
If I make him work in a
cycle shop or a Mechanic shed.

136
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,157
They will pay Rs.20 a day.

137
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,215
How much?
- Rs.20...

138
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,325
Here keep this.

139
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,761
Get him ready quickly.

140
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,887
What were you saying about 20?

141
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,034
I was saying he might
stop after 10th class.

142
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,897
Munna will not agree unless he
studies up to 20th class.

143
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,699
You are right. Come on boy,
we will get late to school.

144
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,338
Brother, urine...

145
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,109
No problem, you can
pass it anywhere

146
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,843
Study well son

147
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,171
Run fast, children.

148
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,039
Greetings sir.-
- Greetings sir.

149
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,842
Newly joined?

150
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,713
Already I have admitted
many children.

151
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,387
I don't even know their parents also.

152
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,848
You never pay the fees and
I can't force you.

153
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,184
How am I to maintain the school?
Tell me.

154
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,055
Moreover, not a single child from
your area obeys me.

155
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,697
When a Teacher scolds them,
they are using bad words.

156
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,355
Bad words?

157
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,361
Yes, bad words.
They use it freely.

158
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,364
They are spoiling the entire school,,
lock, stock & barrel.

159
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,400
Fourth class Teacher,
hasn't come today.

160
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,468
Why? What the hell she's doing
sitting at home?

161
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,203
She has joined some ‘nasty' computer
course. So, she hasn't come.

162
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,404
What can I do?
You look after that class too.

163
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,873
Look, I am also
using bad words.

164
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,947
The mistake lies is not your
area's children.

165
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,210
The problem lies in the water
supplied to your area.

166
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,820
They are good children.
Their future is in your hands.

167
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,082
Did you see what he's
doing there?

168
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,761
Let him do it sir.
Please don't stop him.

169
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,953
He has ruined my life.

170
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,965
You must reform him.
I'm ready to fall at your feet also.

171
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,763
What will you hold?
This is the last admission.

172
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,438
If he also becomes one like
the other children.

173
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,740
I will kill everyone
and go to jail.

174
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,908
How am I too thank...
- No more new admissions please

175
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,740
It's enough if you pay the old dues.
- I will try sir.

176
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,819
Beauty of women is
like a candle

177
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,263
Though candles may be of any color.
The light it gives is the same.

178
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,598
It will give light till it dies.

179
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:23,274
I think beauty has meaning when it
is useful to you, parents & country.

180
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:09,923
You were brilliant.

181
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,561
What is there in saying things?
All trash.

182
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,129
Traditions... and the hell...

183
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,893
We will be crowned only
we mouth them.

184
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,461
Get going.

185
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,465
Where is the lighter?

186
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,143
You all know me very well.

187
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,085
Already 28 days, 8 hours and
20 minutes has passed.

188
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,353
Time given to you is over.

189
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,024
You couldn't get just 2 acres
of land in this big city.

190
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,366
...to buy

191
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:58,632
Do you know why Taj Group is
interested in JVC Hotel with me.

192
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,307
They trust me.

193
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:07,513
The same trust with which
I have employed you all.

194
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,978
We are running short of time.

195
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,054
If we don't identify a
site for the hotel.

196
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,189
They will go ahead and finish
the deal with other group.

197
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,123
Sir, getting 2 acres in the
heart of city is difficult.

198
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,728
Ask if they might give
us the Secretariat.

199
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,662
How can they give sir?
- Assembly?

200
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,295
Public grounds?
Did you make a try?

201
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,133
You will get something
if you make a try.

202
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,398
We tried our maximum.
- Maximum?

203
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,636
You mean, you can't do
anything beyond that.

204
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,013
Isn't it?
- Yes sir.

205
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,411
Then, you are fired.
Settle his salary immediately.

206
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,017
Has anyone tried to his
maximum ability?

207
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,690
Sir, I went to Andhra Bank
to close our locker.

208
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,361
I got these documents there.

209
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,159
What are they?
- Land documents.

210
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,667
You've a 5 acre land in
the heart of Hyderabad.

211
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,507
Where?
- In Ameerpet.

212
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,574
A great chic is
passing before me

213
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,143
Drive the car.

214
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,286
My teacher told me not to come
from tomorrow.- Why?

215
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,091
It seems you didn't
pay our fees.

216
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,759
I will pay. Will I run away
without paying?

217
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,426
You don't worry. Tell him,
I will come & talk to him tomorrow.

218
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,620
I am not bothered about that.
- Then?

219
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,828
He asked me all this
before my girl friends.

220
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:03,727
Girl friends?

221
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,505
Yes, you will understand my pain
if you'd 3 girl friends.

222
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:08,730
You come boy.

223
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,259
Are you driving blindly?
Are you blind?

224
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,092
Look, if anything happens to him,
will you answer to his girl friends?

225
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,466
Get down.

226
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,326
Leave it sir.
He is not even hurt.

227
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,528
You are grown up like a bull.

228
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,763
Aren't you ashamed to
make a girl drive?

229
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,334
Is she your sister?

230
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:46,766
Why are you shaking your head?

231
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,144
Do you've a license?
Come on, take out your license.

232
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,209
Please leave her sir.

233
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,780
No way, get down.
Get down.

234
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,347
Can't you understand
if I tell you once?

235
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,113
What is your problem?

236
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,781
What happened now?

237
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,693
You almost run over him
but he is not injured.

238
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,124
I shouted getting tensed up.
Will you brandish a knife for that?

239
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,561
No sir, keep the knife safely.

240
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:32,712
Thank you very much sir.

241
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,721
They tried to rob me when
I came out of the Bank.

242
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,391
Thank god...you saved me.
- Oh god! Is it all money?

243
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,390
How much fees we have
to pay to the school?

244
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,833
This is enough.

245
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,202
Did you see how expensive the
education is? Thank you.

246
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,168
Why are you taking my money?

247
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,842
Till now you were scared of losing life,
scared of losing money now?

248
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,612
Is it a fee to save my life?

249
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,877
This is not for me, for the children.
My service if free.

250
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,544
Instead of taking it yourself,
I would've given if you'd begged.

251
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,278
Remember two things clearly

252
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,889
One, I don't like begging.
I will take it as my right.

253
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:08,952
Second one?

254
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,189
I forgot. I will tell as soon as
I remember it.

255
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,193
Come let's go.

256
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,635
He has taken my money...
Says school fees.

257
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,890
They are measuring the place.
Are they going to play here?

258
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:49,896
This is our site, 5 acres.
- 5 acres?- Yes.

259
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,739
Is it mine?
My own?

260
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,238
That too in the heart of the city.

261
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,804
This is not a site.
- No?

262
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:02,736
My fortune.

263
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,946
I can see it clearly.

264
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,812
Watch avidly.

265
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,478
Why is he spreading a paper
on the car's bonnet?

266
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,484
This is our plan sheet.

267
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,257
Road comes like this & cuts here.
Entire parking is underground.

268
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,826
We can build a
swimming pool here.

269
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,019
It's all confusing.
What are you doing here?

270
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,425
How many huts are in this area?
- Are you from census?

271
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,694
Do I look like one?
- Then, why?

272
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,502
I have seen so many people
coming here for that.

273
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,307
You've come in a suit & car.
Come & have a tea with me.

274
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,842
Look, he's beating me.

275
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,285
Why did you beat him?

276
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,444
How dare he puts his hand
on my shoulders?

277
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,953
Will you beat anyone if he puts
his hand on your shoulder?

278
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,616
Recently our P.M. Vajpayee
went to America

279
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,056
There, American President
George Bush...

280
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,793
...put his hands on his shoulder
and took him in to have tea.

281
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:56,795
Did he beat him?

282
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,061
Recently Bill gates
comes to Hyderabad

283
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,802
Our Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu
welcomed him in

284
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,636
Of course putting his hand on his
shoulder & invited him to tea.

285
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,640
Did he beat him?

286
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,011
Will you beat anyone if they put
their hands on your shoulder?

287
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,077
Look, this place belongs to me.
These are the documents.

288
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,746
You must vacate the place
by tomorrow.

289
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,678
We will not vacate.
- Why not?

290
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,878
This area is mine.

291
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,823
That's what I am also telling you.
What is this non-sense early morning?

292
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:22,685
What?

293
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,091
Look at these documents.
This land is mine.

294
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,691
I don't deny it was yours
before I was born.

295
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,561
After I was born,
this has become mine.

296
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,699
What is the connection
between the two? - There is.

297
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,002
The right with which
you beat him,

298
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,839
with the same right I claim
this land as mine.

299
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,776
Look, don't unnecessarily...

300
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,579
What I mean to say is...

301
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,772
you say you'II not vacate the place,
that's all isn't it?

302
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,444
That's all isn't it?
- Yes...yes...yes.

303
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,589
I know how to clean
the dirt like you.

304
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,056
Remember two things clearly.

305
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,794
One, never make nasty
comments on people

306
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,465
Two, I will not tell you.
Do what so ever you can.

307
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,736
Just now you said to beat if
anyone puts hand on shoulder.

308
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,408
That's it, Munna.
- Please leave the place sir.

309
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,598
We are nasty people.

310
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,763
What's all this?

311
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,891
Photo-session, brother

312
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,827
It's for an article.
A day of Miss India.

313
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,067
I heard you'd faced trouble for
acquiring land. What happened?

314
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,069
Did you tell her everything?

315
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,102
I didn't tell anything.

316
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,639
I just said we had a trouble.
I never said you were beaten up.

317
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,979
Were you beaten up?
Who beat you?

318
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,511
I was insulted badly.
- What nuisance!

319
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,586
Now tell me, what had happened?

320
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,921
It's a labor colony
of 200 huts.- Okay.

321
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,928
If you bring some silly
papers, we don't care.

322
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,660
We had seen many like you.

323
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,927
We will not vacate the place.
Go to hell...so they said.

324
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,196
Who beat you brother?

325
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,931
There is a man known as Munna.

326
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,674
People have become proud
with his tacit support.

327
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,443
Munna? Who is he?
Can't you fire a shot at him?

328
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,136
Keep quiet madam.
It is not so easy.

329
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,879
Tell me if you can't.
I will handle him.

330
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,780
No brother.- You don't get angry.
We will manage him.

331
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,954
Subba Rao, call the
Home Minister.- Okay sir.

332
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,156
You manage it from your side.
I will try it from my side.

333
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,958
Will he dare to beat you?
I will rip him apart.

334
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,223
Get out boys.

335
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,701
Why are you pasting all
nasty posters in my hotel?

336
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,962
Marry at the earliest

337
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,571
Keep quiet, Aunt.
What a great beauty!

338
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,803
Go out, no beauty.- Aunt...

339
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,143
Aunt, one tea please.
- Give him a tea.

340
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,807
Why is her photo here?

341
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,842
She is Miss India!
- Miss India?

342
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:01,711
Do you know her?

343
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,045
Know her? She is very close to me.
- Close?

344
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,717
Then, what?
- How do you know her?

345
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,253
She loves me.

346
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,058
You are cracking jokes.

347
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,656
I never joke about girls.

348
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,667
She will be here at the
snap of my finger.

349
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:27,501
Brother...please snap...
your finger once.- Can't I avoid?

350
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,543
I am snapping my finger.

351
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,005
I am doing it.- Do it brother.

352
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,075
You've done it really.

353
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,549
She has come at the
snap of your finger.

354
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,086
Miss India has really come here.

355
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,287
Oh god! She has come here really.
- You are great!

356
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,862
Munna, she is calling you.
Get up...get up.

357
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:50,762
Me?

358
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,029
Who else will she call?
Come on get going.

359
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,638
Get up my king...

360
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,211
Do you also live in this locality?
- Yes.

361
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,245
It seems there is a thug named
Munna here. Who is he?

362
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,206
Why?

363
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,574
I want his legs.

364
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,884
Will you do it yourself or
some one else will do?

365
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,219
You don't bother about that.

366
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,319
Why not? I am Munna.

367
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:19,252
Are you that thug?
How dare to beat my brother?

368
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,132
Is that fool your brother?

369
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,130
Are you itching for trouble?

370
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,572
If I make a phone call,
hundreds will descend here.

371
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,337
You want 100 people to
beat me. Call them.

372
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,678
I will teach you a lesson.
- Go ahead.

373
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,278
Bhadram, I want to remove a
man's legs immediately.

374
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,808
Come immediately to Ameerpet.

375
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,818
I am in Tirupathi Madam.
- Tirupathi? Why did you go there?

376
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,819
How can he know you'II
be calling him?

377
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,616
He might've gone to offer
prayers in Tirupathi.

378
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,816
Call me immediately on
coming back.- Okay madam.

379
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,825
Tell him to come directly here
after offering prayers.

380
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,165
What man? Do you consider
yourself a hero?

381
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,828
If I think, you'II vanish
from this earth.

382
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,831
Why are you so proud man?

383
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,708
Why are you staring at me?

384
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:07,970
Why are you staring at me?

385
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,845
Do you think girls will fall for
you on staring like this?

386
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,176
What do you eat?

387
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,647
You are strong like a bull.

388
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,184
Don't cross paths with me.
I will run over & crush you.

389
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,062
Say sorry.

390
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,189
Say sorry man.

391
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,864
I want to tell you 2 truths.

392
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,137
It is not good to see a girl
talking to me so closely.

393
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,300
Second one?

394
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,682
I am tensed. Stay little away
from me, I will tell you.

395
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,745
Do you think this is your land?
This is mine.

396
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,355
Someday this will become mine.

397
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,989
Let me see that.
- What you'II see?

398
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:57,887
I will tell you.

399
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,359
I must do something with you.
I will do.

400
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,351
Why did I go there?

401
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:29,124
Look how you are getting tempted...

402
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,933
My sweet heart,
she presides over my heart.

403
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,989
Don't tempt me. I will give
my favorite trademark kiss.

404
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,894
Oh great warrior! Take out your
weapon and create magic.

405
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:45,100
Take away my life with
your sharp looks.

406
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,762
Once I get going I am unstoppable.
I will run over you.

407
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,716
I will look at you and
fall in love with you.

408
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,380
If you give in yourself
I will give myself to you.

409
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,051
And show you the heaven.

410
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:41,380
Oh my dear! Don't raise my tension.

411
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,492
If I get tempted,
I will become a poem.

412
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,394
Wave the green signal,
our love is an epic tale.

413
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,828
Let it become a bible of love.

414
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,831
Have you got so much patience?

415
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,972
Don't worry.
I will come immediately.

416
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,165
Be ready for me.

417
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,776
Let the earth & sky meet.
Let the magic be created.

418
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:53,230
I will give a bit of cheek to you.

419
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,365
If you act smart, I will tie
the auspicious thread to you.

420
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,964
No my dear.
Don't take chances.

421
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,140
If you come on to me,
you will end up as the loser.

422
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:13,140
Oh my king! I am your kingdom,
rule over it.

423
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:17,477
Oh! Train of love,
do you've so much passion?

424
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,585
Do you want an engine to pull you?

425
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:24,050
Don't get angry dear.
Win over me gently.

426
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,254
If you insist, I will do and
put you into a fix.

427
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:05,694
What happened?

428
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,702
I had a dream.

429
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:12,968
Dreams are many like A, U, AU, XX
which one you had?

430
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,503
Something like that only,
Munna came into my dream also.

431
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,648
That rogue?
Why did you meet him?

432
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,974
What did he do in your dream?

433
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,651
He tried to kiss me.

434
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,654
Did he kiss?
- No. I dreamed kissing him.

435
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,721
Wrong! You mustn't get such dreams.
- Yes, he's our enemy.

436
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,832
You must dream of strangling his neck,
stabbing or stamping him.

437
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,864
Why did you go there?
What happened there?

438
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,505
I went there to warn him.

439
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,837
Why is she feeling shy
to say that?

440
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,008
Don't know what he gave.

441
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,540
Come let's talk

442
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,940
I will give you a clear picture.

443
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,746
Sir, I've inquired about him.

444
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,175
Any one eyeing that place
will be crushed by him.

445
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,847
Listen to me and call the
Home Minister, who is your friend.

446
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,216
Send police and teach
them a lesson

447
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,752
Or else he'II take the land
along with your sister.

448
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,292
Send police

449
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,554
I am Dhanraj speaking.
- Tell me sir.

450
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,754
Is Minister there?
- He is there sir.

451
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,024
Give the phone to him.
- One minute.

452
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,759
Give the phone to him.
- Yes, hold on the line sir.

453
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,536
Sir, Dhanraj is on the line

454
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,037
Oh! Our man! My friend.
what is it, Dhanraj?

455
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,039
I want a help.

456
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,202
Won't I do it for our friendship?

457
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,705
I told you about a piece
of land, didn't I?

458
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,314
I want that, get it cleared.
- Oh! That's all.

459
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,215
I will send police & clear it.
They will run for shelter.

460
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,782
I don't know how you do it.
I want my land vacant.

461
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:31,718
Okay bye

462
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,886
You promised to send whisky bottles.
- I will send today evening.

463
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,988
With that...

464
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:40,795
Did he hang the phone?

465
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:42,657
You go.

466
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:51,803
You all are living here
for many years.

467
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:57,679
You stay put here with the
help of rowdyism & vandalism.

468
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,078
Your time has run out.

469
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,614
This is Home Minister's order.

470
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,347
Tomorrow morning, I will come here
with Police force.

471
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:13,586
If you vacate by overnight,
there will be no trouble.

472
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,824
If you rebel,
you will stand to lose.

473
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,701
It may be property loss
or loss of lives.

474
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,703
I will leave it to your better sense.

475
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,110
Think over it, bye.

476
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,039
Just saying yes will not do.

477
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,379
If you don't vacate.
I will rip out your skins.

478
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,783
Munna, you saved us in times
of distress with your courage.

479
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:41,288
You can stop thugs but police?

480
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,386
When every avenue closes,
God is the only savior.

481
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:44,791
We are not going from here.

482
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:45,986
What can we do without moving out?

483
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,063
Which festival is nearing?
- Lord Vinayaka's birthday.

484
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,624
Then, we must celebrate it.
- Celebrate?

485
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,970
We need a temple for
our Lord Vinayaka.

486
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,732
Build a temple.
- Where?- Here.

487
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:19,086
Hail Lord Vinayaka!

488
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,672
An old man was living
here long time back.

489
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,336
Do you know where he is now?
- I don't know.

490
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,239
He had little boy with him.
At least do you know where he is?

491
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,179
I don't know.

492
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,386
Did you find a knife from
my shop to take the coir?

493
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,850
We built the temple
as you ordered us.

494
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,927
Let's celebrate...

495
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,261
We didn't build the temple
to celebrate the festival.

496
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,864
Then why?- For police.

497
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,278
You will not change.
You will never change.

498
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,390
Your skin has grown thick.

499
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,957
A temple?
How did it appear overnight.

500
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,063
No, it was here since
I was a little girl.

501
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,156
In fact, I was born in that temple.
- Really?

502
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:31,900
Really?

503
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,428
I told you to vacate and
you are celebrating.

504
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,068
What is that?

505
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,785
Kill anyone who protests.
Break their limbs.

506
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,423
Will you build a temple?

507
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,749
It seems she was born in
that temple. Beat her.

508
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:44,499
They have damaged our temple...

509
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,811
What happened son?

510
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,040
They have damaged our temple.
- So what?

511
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,842
Don't ask so what?
You must cry, come on cry.

512
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:55,518
Why?

513
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,580
We need the cries now.
Come on start crying.

514
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:02,053
Oh god! What a calamity
has befallen on us.

515
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,495
Oh god, they damaged our temple.
They damaged our temple.

516
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,264
They have damaged
a good temple.

517
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,527
Munna...they've damaged
our temple.

518
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,839
Aunt...aunt..
- Let the sinners be punished.

519
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:24,413
They have unjustly damaged it.
You will be ruined.

520
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,082
Oh god! I am ruined.

521
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:39,858
Down with police atrocities!

522
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,091
They've damaged our temple.

523
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,032
Who is there to protect our Lord?

524
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:52,869
Injustice has been done to us.

525
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,037
They struck a crowbar into the temple.
They should've struck into my heart.

526
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,114
Let the sinner be punished.

527
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,217
They have damaged our temple.

528
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:06,115
Let your mothers be punished.
Let you be poisoned to death.

529
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,121
Injustice has been done to us.

530
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:13,888
Bloody sinners! You've sinned
against our Lord Vinayaka.

531
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,563
Yes, sinned against our Lord.

532
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,936
They've damaged our temple.
- They've damaged.

533
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,408
They've damaged our
Lord Vinayaka's temple.

534
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,603
They've damaged.

535
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,347
Police are not only doing
atrocities on people.

536
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,018
They are not sparing even gods.

537
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,154
Look, how lost our lord is looking.

538
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,586
What did he do?
They've damaged his temple.

539
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:46,161
So, we'II not stop this agitation
till we get justice...No.

540
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,631
Good evening, in a locality of
Ameerpet in Hyderabad,

541
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,267
A temple of Lord Vinayaka
built by people there,

542
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,303
unidentified anti-social elements
have damaged it.

543
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,272
People got shocked and
resorted to agitation.

544
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,172
The message has reached
Halls of Assembly,

545
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,281
most of the political parties have
condemned the incident

546
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:10,976
The incident has lead to
sporadic violence in the city.

547
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,281
City is in chaos.

548
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,956
Curfew has been clamped
in few areas.

549
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,390
Bhajan Lal of Eshwara Sena
has condemned the incident.

550
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,989
A report on the incident
from our correspondent.

551
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,997
Hail Lord Vinayaka...

552
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:30,333
Supporters are coming in two
trains from U.P & Bihar.

553
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,065
In near future, devotees from all
over India will converge here

554
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,210
and join the agitation.

555
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:41,410
Hail Lord Vinayaka!

556
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,485
We will not stop this fast
till we get justice.

557
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:51,993
Hail Lord Vinayaka!

558
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,665
Instead of striking the Lord,
why didn't they strike my heart?

559
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:00,431
What is all this?

560
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,563
Holding a responsible
position in Government

561
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,574
What's all this joining
hands with thugs?

562
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,003
For the sake of friendship.
- What great friendship!

563
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,581
What's the connection between a
private holding & Government?

564
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,778
Can you use police
for personal things?

565
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,585
For the sake of friendship, a little...
- What little?

566
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,521
The Government is on the verge
of falling for your work.

567
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:23,788
It seems people from other
states are descending.

568
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,693
Did you hear me?
I am asking you, did you hear me?

569
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,261
I heard you sir.
- You will hear this.

570
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,699
First go & remove that tent.

571
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,600
I don't know, you beg or
fall at their feet.

572
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,365
If you can't do anything
resign from your post. Go.

573
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,745
How can I resign for friendship?

574
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,376
First clear the place
and do something.

575
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,276
Our temple...

576
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,615
I hid a idly packet here,
who has taken it?

577
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,285
I had kept it here.

578
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,225
Brother, police car is coming.

579
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:07,626
Move...move back...
I say...move...move.

580
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,296
Police have come, start...

581
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:14,443
Down with police atrocities.
We want justice.

582
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:19,308
They've damaged our temple sir...

583
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,783
Come here madam.

584
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,244
If they had stabbed her,
problem would've been solved.

585
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:30,758
We want justice...

586
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,091
Greetings.
- Sir...sir...

587
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,755
Subramaniam! She's very upset.
Take her that side.

588
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,660
Yes sir...come...madam...come

589
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,768
Are you Munna?

590
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,099
I thought you might
be a great leader.

591
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,603
We are not leaders. You are a leader.
We are laborers.

592
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,547
Labor? Labor are not ordinary
people as you think.

593
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,444
They will rip out skins.

594
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,779
Remove the tent.

595
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:03,682
Fasting has made you to belch.

596
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,292
Till now we were rising
slogans against Police.

597
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,629
If you stay here, we will
raise slogans against you.

598
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,701
It will increase your gas trouble.
- Oh my god!

599
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:19,900
Subramaniam! Take care of her.
Clear her and pacify her.

600
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,508
I will take care.
I will spend from my pocket.

601
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,375
I will rebuild the temple
in white marble.

602
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,575
Oh! How niece you are son!

603
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,814
I can understand it
on seeing you, son.

604
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,813
We need land documents
also to build homes.

605
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,519
I will personally see that
you will get it.

606
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,853
I will talk to the government
and get you the land.

607
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,320
What a great heart
you have son!

608
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,327
Can I trust you sir?

609
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,394
I swear on this woman.
- Okay, we will give up the fast.

610
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,537
But, this tent will be here till
you fulfill the promise.

611
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:52,401
Let it be here.
Do as you wish.

612
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,843
Sir...sir! - Subramaniam, bring a
glass of lemon juice.

613
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,167
You didn't inform me to bring.

614
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,548
Do I have to inform you that also?
- Son...son.

615
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,684
Shall I get it now sir.
- No, take care of her.- Okay sir.

616
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,413
You will be hungry.- Yes sir.
- Order something & eat.

617
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,888
I will personally take care of
the things including temple.

618
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,760
Definitely sir.
- Bye.- Bye sir.

619
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,190
If I don't leave quickly,
he will finish me.

620
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,854
My son...my son.

621
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,757
Leave him madam. Don't kill him
with your affection, leave him

622
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,562
Lear him...please leave him.
- Son ....

623
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,568
Son, you also stay with us.

624
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,708
Leave him madam...
- Please stay with us.

625
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,869
What a great man you are son.
Don't leave us & go away.

626
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,706
Son...son...son

627
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:39,218
Take care of her...- Go madam...
That's it.

628
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,550
You come man.
- Okay sir. Move.

629
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,722
Temple...temple.

630
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,558
No one is bothered
about my land site.

631
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,222
Every one is bothered
about the temple only.

632
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,800
Who built the temple overnight?
- They would've built it.

633
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,932
Moreover Lord Vinayaka
is a powerful god

634
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,600
I didn't ask you to tell me
the powers of the lord.

635
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,006
Sir, one idea

636
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,246
We'II offer 50% share in the
proposed 5- Star hotel.

637
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,243
There will be no problem.

638
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,275
If we sacrifice you for the
opening of the Hotel.

639
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,474
Half of our headache
will vanish.

640
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,347
What is it?

641
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,350
No...please...don't tell him.

642
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,951
I have a doubt that
temple is his idea.

643
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,018
Why would I?

644
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,621
I will not tell anyone.
I will do it.

645
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,425
They've done injustice to you.

646
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:29,430
When this is happening to you.
We are just mortals

647
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,369
Where is Munna?- Inside.

648
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,935
Why is she going into
the room directly?

649
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,314
I want to talk to you.

650
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,281
Go ahead.
- Little personal.

651
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,954
Shall I go out?
- No...with you only.

652
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:46,778
Come on tell me.

653
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:52,955
Why are you closing the door?
- Didn't I say personal?

654
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,627
Shall I close the windows also?
- Okay.

655
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,301
They've closed the
door & windows.

656
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,463
No need to remove clothes to talk

657
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,402
I am feeling sultry.
No a/c or fan here.

658
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,867
Come to the point.
- To tell you the point directly.

659
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,477
I have started liking you & it is
growing with every passing day.

660
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,309
Today I've understood,
I am in love with you.

661
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:19,547
What?

662
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,554
I want to marry you.

663
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,351
You are Miss India. Why are you
stooping down to low level?

664
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,893
Take it as you wish.
Will you agree to marry me or not?

665
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,657
Marriage?
Forget about marriage.

666
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,035
I can't maintain you as a concubine
for 4 days also. Please leave me.

667
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,027
Will you marry me or not?
- No.

668
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,030
Don't look at me like that. You spoiled
my intentions with that look

669
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,102
I think it's you not me,
who is trying to spoil.

670
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,008
Listen to me.- I will not.

671
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,580
Even if I think the
answer will be the same.

672
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,016
Can't you talk from little away?

673
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,786
You don't know about me.
- I don't know.

674
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,791
You don't know
what I will do next.

675
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,023
How can I know
what you will do?

676
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,800
Please don't harm...

677
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,628
Please don't harm me.
Leave me, please.

678
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:45,503
Please don't harm me.
Please...Munna.

679
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,419
She's crying.
- What would've happened?

680
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,756
What he would've done?
- Munna would've done something.

681
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:07,752
What happened man?

682
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,793
You shouId've approached gently.

683
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,595
Why did you force her?
Look how she went away crying.

684
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:15,993
What are you looking at?

685
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,800
Police should've come by now
I am waiting for them.

686
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,446
Look, they are here.
Come man. I've something for you.

687
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:30,119
Will you try to rape Miss India?

688
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,114
Do you think you are the law?
I'II kill you. Come.

689
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:37,119
Sir, I want to have a personal
talk with you.- Where?

690
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:37,949
Come inside.

691
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,461
Why?- Little work.
- Go...- Come.

692
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:43,557
Come in...come in sir.

693
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:45,896
Tell me.

694
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,800
One minute sir.
- Tell me sir.

695
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:55,575
Sir stand straight.

696
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,813
Stand straight sir.
- Why?

697
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,976
Will you do anything
on their orders?

698
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:05,987
Will you arrest and release
on their orders?

699
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:08,483
Come.

700
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,488
It's between us only.

701
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,817
Don't tell anyone I slapped you.
- I will not tell.

702
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:13,195
Shall we go now?

703
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,495
Yes...come let's go.
Come...come.

704
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,726
Come...come.

705
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,503
Will you give me behind
the closed door?

706
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,540
It's paining. Will you try
to bribe me? Come.

707
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:29,510
When will you drop him back?

708
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,014
Am I taking him to a movie
to drop him again here?

709
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:44,085
Son...Munna...
He is taking him away.

710
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,029
5 feet and 9 inch tall
with curly hair...

711
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:52,228
the accused who is know as
Munna alias Bhayya and Chinna

712
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,966
arrogant with sexual desires,

713
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:55,703
Mind your language.

714
00:57:56,105 --> 00:58:00,303
Pardon me sir.
The accused tried to rape a girl.

715
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,703
In the interest of society I pray
to punish him severely.

716
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,576
What is your reply to
his accusation?

717
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:14,554
They are falsely implicating me with
5 feet 9 inch height & curly hair,

718
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,722
those particulars are not mine.

719
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:17,919
it's not written that it was me.

720
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,722
If a man with that details
had really attempted it.

721
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:25,561
He must be an Indian.
Why can't it be you?

722
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,135
Definitely it's not me.
Because I am not an Indian.

723
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,138
I am from China.
I am a Chinese.

724
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,241
Why is he saying China?

725
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,736
You were born in this country
and grew up here.

726
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,744
Aren't you ashamed to say
you are not an Indian?

727
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,677
Please listen to me sir.

728
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:44,586
I don't know where I was born.
I don't know who my parents were.

729
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,822
I am a wild bird.
I don't have any siblings.

730
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,749
Someone calls me as Munna,
some one brother.

731
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,253
People call me with different names.
No one knows who I am.

732
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:58,927
But today they've brought to
court with personal details.

733
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,604
How can I claim to be an
Indian without knowing?

734
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,173
You are getting angry for saying.
I am not an Indian.

735
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,109
How much angry I must
be for being an orphan?

736
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,179
Whom am I to take my anger on?

737
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:15,611
Sir, not only me, no one in
my area has any identity.

738
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,314
We were living in Lakdi-ka-pool.

739
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,854
They asked us to leave saying
a building is coming up there.

740
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,616
We came to Punjagutta from there.
They chased us from there also.

741
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:23,952
We came to Ameerpet from there.

742
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,991
Where are we to go from here?
How long do we've to be shunted?

743
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,127
We don't have homes.
- No homes.

744
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:30,959
No lands.- No.

745
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,293
We are not in the voter's list.
- No.

746
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,203
No ration cards.- No.

747
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:39,673
We are Indians without
all these also.- Yes.

748
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,734
Victory to Free India!

749
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,068
But you are surely an Indian, you are
sitting in the seat of power.

750
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,015
Think about us also.

751
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,081
I will tell later about rape
once you recognize me.

752
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,655
First recognize us as people.

753
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,823
Living the heart of the city
for many years,

754
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,897
this court regrets that Govt. has
failed to recognize them,

755
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,432
and orders concerned officers
to recognize their rights,

756
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:11,235
I order release of
accused Munna on bail,

757
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,672
and adjourn the case
to 8th of next month.

758
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,345
Reversal of fortunes.

759
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:20,171
Sign madam.

760
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,443
I will put thumb impression.
- Okay.

761
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,446
What is your name madam?

762
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,195
What is this? What was the case
we registered against him?

763
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:43,804
They are getting door numbers.

764
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,205
Is there any connection
between the two?

765
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,708
Now it's numbers, next it
will be ration cards.

766
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,743
Next they will get voting rights.

767
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,881
After that they will claim
the land as their own.

768
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,879
We can't catch him so easily.

769
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:59,146
What is the solution then?
- I've an idea.

770
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:04,415
For getting door numbers
we must do something for him.

771
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,385
What shall we do?

772
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,492
Shall we do an elicitation?

773
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,397
It is not elicitation.
It is felicitation.

774
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:15,295
That's what I am saying, elicitation.
- Felicitation!

775
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,406
They present a shawl and
shower flowers, elicitation.

776
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,107
It is felicitation
not elicitation.

777
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,837
He's mad. He is not
able to understand it.

778
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,917
Padma tell me,
who is right, he or me?

779
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,245
You are right.

780
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:31,746
Get up.

781
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:37,985
Elicitation.- Felicitation.

782
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,321
It's felicitation.- Yes.

783
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,799
What is this new habit
of drinking?

784
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,992
To celebrate the event
of getting door numbers.

785
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,103
No shut up.
That is not the reason.

786
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:54,209
Some silly girl has accused him falsely.
He is drinking unable to bear it.

787
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:55,342
Is it son?

788
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,947
Then, you didn't do anything
with that Miss India?- No.

789
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:03,142
Oh god, that Miss India had
cheated you.- What's this?

790
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,150
Then, do something to her.

791
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,788
I will do.- Shut up.

792
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,152
She registered a rape
case against me.

793
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,020
I will really rape her.

794
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,461
You know how that
rape will be...

795
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,359
Neither in past nor in future.-
You mean?

796
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,231
No one had done it in past.

797
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,036
No one can do it in
future also.- That is it.

798
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,133
I need all your encouragement.

799
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,905
Lick this.

800
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,312
Is it hot?
- Perfect.

801
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,174
Now, gulp it down.

802
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,245
Put the victory vermilion
mark on his forehead.

803
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:47,529
You are handsome like a king, go.

804
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,419
Here you are.

805
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,291
You?- Yes, it's me.

806
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,863
How dare to enter my home?

807
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,867
Will you charge a rape
case against me?

808
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,540
I will really rape you now.

809
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,536
How sweet she is...

810
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,986
What? What?
- I will kill you.

811
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,889
Will you push me down?
- I will not spare you.

812
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,122
I have done it.

813
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:04,562
I have done it.

814
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,398
I have done it.
- Leave me.

815
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:17,342
Oh god! Leave me.
Wait.

816
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,487
I'II rape you.
Please co-operate with me.

817
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,959
Let's do it happily.
Not like this...please wait.

818
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,292
When I try to rape you
shout, no save me.

819
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,929
I will not shout.
I love you.

820
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,293
What is this?
Leave me please...

821
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,095
No...no.

822
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,940
I don't have parents.
I don't have anyone in this world.

823
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,976
Please don't spoil my life.
Please leave me.

824
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,380
Leave...please leave me,
I will fall at your feet.

825
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,516
You are trapped.
- Oh god!...save me.

826
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,960
Didn't I ask you to leave me?
I beg you, please leave me.

827
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:04,121
Please leave me.

828
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:07,997
No, save me.

829
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,202
Leave me.

830
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,974
Please I beg you.
Leave me ....

831
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,139
What is this, Chithra?

832
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,739
What is he doing here?
What's happening here?

833
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,407
Who is doing it to whom?
Visual confusion.

834
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,085
Sir, she has trapped a single man.
Please save me from her sir.

835
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,557
Chithra...him?

836
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,997
Thanks for leaving me.
I bow to you & leaving.

837
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,037
I like him.
- He is trying to usurp our land.

838
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,104
Anyway you'II give it to me
as dowry, won't you?

839
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,234
I will kill you if you utter his name.
You've ruined our family honor.

840
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,777
Family honor, my foot.
Will you get us married or not?

841
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,188
What's this Munna?
What happened?

842
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:09,695
Oh my god!
- Did she bite you?

843
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:13,024
She didn't bite or pinch me.
She ruined my life.

844
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,062
When we go on such missions,

845
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,401
Our lives also get ruined along
with theirs, what can we do?

846
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,371
But one thing buddies.
First time in life, I was damn scared.

847
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:28,145
Nothing happened there?.
- No

848
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,279
Hey stop...

849
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,424
I've walked out of my
brother's house.- Why?

850
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,386
I am going to stay here only.

851
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:41,618
I will marry only you.

852
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,729
Marriage?

853
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,623
Didn't I say it is impossible?

854
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,501
How can you say that?
I've come here for good.

855
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:48,830
What's all this trouble son?

856
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,637
We had sent you to do something &
you've come back doing something else.

857
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,300
She's talking about marriage.

858
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,644
Can't you understand if I say once?
Get lost from here.

859
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,644
What are you saying?
Do you consider yourself a hero?

860
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,080
You are going overboard.

861
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,246
What are you and
what are we?

862
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,781
Isn't it? So, go away.

863
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,850
Will you marry me or not?

864
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,586
I-w-i-I-1 -n-o-t-m-a-r-r-y.

865
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,758
Where's the well here?
- Go to the right.

866
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,796
Hey, looks like she
might take a leap.

867
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,432
Go...go.
- Come let's go.

868
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,342
What are you looking at?
Jump and save her.

869
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,343
That is it.

870
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,154
You say, you don't love her
- No.

871
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,118
Why did you save her then?

872
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,780
Some bloody rogue pushed
me into the well.

873
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,353
Who pushed me in?

874
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:46,786
Stop that drama.

875
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,460
Is she asking the entire locality?
She is asking just a living space.

876
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:53,361
Aunt, you don't know about her.
- What I don't know.

877
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,636
When a girl is accepting
shamelessly she loves you.

878
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:56,497
Why don't you
understand her?

879
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,366
Look Aunt...- Shut up.

880
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,709
You are staying here only.
Let me see, what he can do?

881
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:05,909
Look, she is winking at me.- Hey

882
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:08,373
She will wink or do anything.
Why are you bothered?

883
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,917
You get...come on.
You come with me.

884
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,722
Push them in & close the door
Put the latch.

885
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:31,021
Oh beauty, don't tease
me with your gait.

886
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:37,033
Oh handsome, steal
my beauty beautifully

887
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,408
How to enjoy the
fun of love then?

888
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,407
I am ready and willingly
accept it happily.

889
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,136
I will give ear rings
if you come in daytime.

890
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:48,378
I will kiss if you at come night.

891
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,722
I will give you many
more things.

892
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:20,081
Mischievous eyes, romantic talk,
your youth full body, is it all for me?

893
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:32,452
Stubbornness, arrogance
Is it all for you?

894
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,594
Come to me as my queen
and my land.

895
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:38,597
I am calling you myself,
don't refuse.

896
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:44,672
Come like a Prince.
Let the music of love flow.

897
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:46,670
If you give your hand

898
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:49,775
I will love you fully.

899
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:57,014
Let's have fun shattering
the world of silence.

900
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:27,815
Oh maiden! Shall I steal
your beauty & your love?

901
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:39,986
Oh handsome, reach the garden of love
like a swashbuckling hero.

902
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:43,164
Oh young fresh girl!
Our union is in the offing.

903
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:46,161
Watch, I will show you the bliss.

904
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:52,199
Come and do it,
my handsome hero.

905
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,269
If you come before,
I will give nose pin.

906
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,509
If you come fast,
I will spread the bed,

907
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,748
It's fun all the way after that.

908
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:36,542
Wait, I will call him.

909
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,016
Munna, phone call for you.
- Me?- Yes, come.

910
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:43,555
Are you planning take
my sister along with the land?

911
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,985
I don't have any such plan.

912
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,091
It's enough if you or
your sister don't harm me.

913
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:53,331
Send back my sister.
If you try to harm her, I'II kill you.

914
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:56,369
Till now, I spared her
though she's tempting me.

915
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:57,900
You've unnecessarily
raked up the issue.

916
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,339
I am fixing a date.
Go to hell.

917
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,004
Who damaged the temple?

918
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:07,779
We will sacrifice
our lives for it.

919
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:09,584
We want the temple
to be rebuilt.

920
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:15,519
Hail Lord Vinayaka!

921
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,022
Who is your leader?- Munna.

922
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:19,350
Where is he?
- He is inside.- Call him.

923
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,521
Go...go.

924
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,698
Cut it properly.

925
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:36,602
Hail Lord Vinayaka.
Hail Lord Vinayaka.

926
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:14,413
Hail Lord Vinayaka.
Come earlier next year.

927
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,761
You didn't expect you'II get hurt
in the shot fired at him.

928
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:19,702
This is the man, arrest him.
- Munna, hasn't done anything.

929
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:27,103
Look at this.

930
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,885
Mumbai!

931
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,986
Dubai

932
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,147
Switch on the T.V. sir.

933
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:10,291
...was attacked.

934
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:13,160
Injured Chithra was taken to
Apollo Hospital immediately.

935
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,091
Her condition is serious.

936
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,696
Munna bas been arrested
for the attack.

937
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:22,165
Sub-Inspector of Ameerpet says
investigation is progressing.

938
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,100
Here is a report from
our correspondent.

939
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,038
Will you explain the details
about the incident?

940
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,063
Look, Munna has come.

941
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,968
What is this?
- How are you son?

942
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:03,868
What is the aunt? Don't cry.
Why are you all also crying?

943
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,347
We are not able to see you
in this condition.

944
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:07,878
You don't cry, aunt.

945
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,308
We spoke to the lawyer.

946
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:11,312
He said we'II move a bail application
in High Court on Monday.

947
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:12,984
He told us to keep
ready Rs.5 lakhs.

948
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:14,687
Is it necessary to
tell him now?

949
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:18,752
What is dear?

950
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:22,361
I've saved money Rs.16 without
the knowledge of my father.

951
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,163
Don't tell anyone.

952
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,362
Shall we give it
to Lawyer uncle?

953
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:39,907
One minute.
Salim Bhai, your phone.

954
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:44,715
It's me.- Pardon Bhai, I thought
some one else.

955
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:53,854
You've visitors.

956
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,267
Who are you?

957
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:14,380
What am I to say?

958
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:19,276
Shall I tell about holding you
in my arms or losing you?

959
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:21,950
I never imagined
of seeing you here

960
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:24,485
I am responsible for
all your difficulties.

961
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,898
You don't worry. Now that I am here.
I will take care of everything.

962
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:31,896
Who are you?

963
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:35,898
You don't worry. I will come back
and get you out of here.

964
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:40,238
He is in jail. To get him out on bail
will cost to Rs.5 lakhs.

965
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:43,070
5 or any amount,
get him out of jail first.

966
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,913
He mustn't be in jail.
- Okay.

967
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:55,755
Your bail order
has come, sign it.

968
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,199
I am searching you for
the past 20 years.

969
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,766
I don't know where and
how you were growing.

970
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:14,933
Who looked after Munna? Who?

971
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,345
I don't know which mother
had looked after him.

972
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:25,349
I bow in her honor.

973
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:28,780
I never hoped to see
you again, Munna.

974
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:31,019
I thought they would've
been killed you.

975
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,119
You don't worry.
We are with you.

976
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:05,315
Where were you all
these years?

977
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:08,487
Where is Munna?

978
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:18,268
Brother Shankar.
- Brother Shankar.

979
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:26,847
I've come all the way from
Katmandu for you.

980
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:29,180
We've not come here
to meet you.

981
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:32,185
We all are living only for you.

982
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,220
Are you staying here?
Are you living here?

983
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,851
You mustn't be living here.

984
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:41,290
Do you know how much
property you have?

985
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:46,095
Your father has left billions
worth property to you.

986
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,194
Oh my god!

987
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,531
We've been looking after
it for years.

988
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:52,967
It's all yours.

989
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:57,376
I shudder at the thought you
grew up in these conditions.

990
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,242
Come, let's go.
You own a house here.

991
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:03,314
Hey Basha, let's go.

992
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,652
Once...

993
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,554
Brother Shankar!

994
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,594
Son Munna

995
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,400
Who are these guys?
Who are these gun wielding guys?

996
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:45,351
One is Anthony Batliwala
another is Mukund Patil.

997
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,286
Both are Bade Mian's men,
very dangerous.

998
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,259
There are cases against them
in Thailand also.

999
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,601
What are these gangsters
doing in Hyderabad?

1000
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,604
What are they doing
in Hyderabad?

1001
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:05,939
Come son...come.

1002
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,274
Come...

1003
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:13,384
This is your home.
Your father's property.

1004
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:16,615
I am protecting this
sitting in Katmandu.

1005
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:21,993
They are my son & daughter.

1006
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:29,128
You complained some one
troubling you for land.

1007
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,205
Was it him?- Yes.

1008
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:34,964
Do you know who he is?

1009
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,403
He is Shankar's son.

1010
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,014
All this property is his.
This is not my property.

1011
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:42,405
I am just a caretaker.

1012
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:45,147
Say sorry to him.

1013
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:47,217
Say sorry.

1014
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:50,089
Fall at his feet and
beg his forgiveness.

1015
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:57,021
Were you fighting all these
days for that locality?

1016
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:58,658
That land is yours.

1017
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:03,094
I bought it with your father's money.
That land is yours.

1018
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:05,436
Who am I?

1019
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,172
I will tell later about
you & your father.

1020
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,045
But this should be a secret.
They will come to know.

1021
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,240
You are not safe here.

1022
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,240
Please come to Katmandu with me.

1023
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:21,021
Yes Munna, don't stay here.
They'II kill you.- Who'II kill me?

1024
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:22,351
Bade Mian!

1025
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,187
Who is Bade Mian?

1026
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:27,688
I will tell you later. First come...

1027
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:31,021
No I will not come.
I will stay here only.

1028
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,263
I will stay with my people
in my locality only.

1029
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,531
I will die for them.

1030
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:38,464
You say the land is mine.

1031
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,537
Give those documents to me.
I will live with my people.

1032
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:45,037
You want the documents.- Yes.
That's all isn't it?- Yes.

1033
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,039
Give those documents.

1034
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:54,549
Give it to them. Tell your
people to live happily.

1035
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:00,294
I feel your father is standing
before us again.

1036
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,826
I don't know what my father
had done for you.

1037
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,559
But I am not able to bear
your profound affection.

1038
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:12,401
Let me live as I was
living all these years.

1039
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,402
Don't tell me any truths,
I don't want any property.

1040
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,303
Don't separate me from
my people with riches.

1041
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:22,078
I will take leave sir.

1042
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,250
Are you going away?

1043
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,655
Don't you have anyone
you love here?

1044
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,247
Munna, please listen to me.

1045
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:32,757
Your father's enemies
will not spare you.

1046
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:34,425
Mafia will not spare anyone.

1047
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,324
Let me see. - We will also
come with you. Come.

1048
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:23,507
Ajasmine twig
is charming my heart

1049
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:28,409
Her thin hips are killing me.

1050
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:33,744
Don't laugh and
give me dreams.

1051
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,783
Don't rise heat in my nerves.

1052
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:44,457
I will hug you and
bring you to my way.

1053
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,993
I will make you elope with me.

1054
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,864
Your lipstick filled lips
are attracting me.

1055
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,212
I am a jasmine twig.

1056
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,010
Don't enchant me like
dreams and vanish.

1057
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:09,016
I am a match stick
don't light me.

1058
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:44,516
Her body is shattering.
Her heart is soft as butter.

1059
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,587
Mother promise,
I can't hold myself anymore.

1060
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:52,196
He is like a lover boy to look but
his eyes are piercing like thorns.

1061
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,163
There is nothing wrong
in to hug him.

1062
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:59,599
If the maiden comes willingly,
shall I have a go to her?

1063
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:04,502
It's fun all the way.

1064
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:07,178
Oh my dear girl,
will you come to me?

1065
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:09,849
Will you kiss me
without any restrictions?

1066
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:14,851
Will you come here at dusk?
I will show you bliss in my arms.

1067
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:27,492
You are a mischievous boy
I am a tender girl.

1068
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,253
Kiss me lip to lip.

1069
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:34,961
I will hold your soft cheeks
and kiss them.

1070
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:36,693
Your cheeks are pink.

1071
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:42,506
My fiancée don't push and make
me jump the fence.

1072
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:47,108
Oh my charming glass of milk
shall we share & drink it?

1073
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:52,448
Don't pinch me with your looks and
kill me with your gestures.

1074
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:57,521
Oh maiden, shall I cross the
limits and steal you?

1075
01:30:59,086 --> 01:30:59,984
Listen everybody.

1076
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:03,454
From today the houses you live
are your own

1077
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:09,462
These are documents.
The locality is ours.

1078
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:16,200
Go & keep it inside.

1079
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:52,901
The city was peaceful till now.

1080
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,567
But in the last 48 hours
everything has changed.

1081
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,506
According to intelligence reports,

1082
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:03,139
around 25 criminals from Mumbai
have entered the city.

1083
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,579
We don't know what
for they were here.

1084
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,987
Now, we know.
For you only.

1085
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,816
Today's bomb blast and
yesterday's attack.

1086
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:12,819
What is in store for future
no body knows?

1087
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,990
These attacks will not stop
till they kill you.

1088
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:17,995
What have I done?
How am I connected to them?

1089
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:20,160
You are Shankar PeheIwan's son.

1090
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:25,872
Where are you going in?
- We will not go till Munna is released.

1091
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:27,005
Do you know Bade Mian?

1092
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,075
There are cases against him
in 18 countries.

1093
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:33,011
City is in danger with
killer gangs coming for you.

1094
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,348
Many innocents may
lose their lives.

1095
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:40,019
So, for safeguarding law & order,
you must leave the city.

1096
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:45,191
You can back after
situation improves.

1097
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:55,026
Okay sir, I will leave.

1098
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:58,428
What have you done with Munna?

1099
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,232
I can go any far for them.

1100
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:04,376
People will create trouble
if you go this side.

1101
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:06,044
Take him from the back side.
- Okay sir.

1102
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:27,257
I suspect something fishy.

1103
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:39,910
Hello...it's me,
I will come tomorrow.

1104
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:41,680
I am going to Nagpur.

1105
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:43,915
What do we get there?

1106
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:45,478
Slippers...I will get you
slippers from there.

1107
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:47,611
Bye, hang the phone.

1108
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:51,587
My daughter, it's her birthday.

1109
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:54,254
She wants me at home.

1110
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:57,255
I am on duty.
Police duty is not time bound.

1111
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:01,930
Don't look there Chotu,
a car is coming. - Yes sir.

1112
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:07,169
Get down and have something.
- I am not hungry.

1113
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:09,104
Today is my daughter's birthday.

1114
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:10,971
Take it as I am giving a
party on that occasion.

1115
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,642
Give me water.

1116
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:18,181
Come sir...sit down sir.
Tell me, what do you want sir?

1117
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:21,120
What do you have?
- Whatever you ask, it is ready.

1118
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:24,517
Any item you order,
it is ready.

1119
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:27,458
Bring everything you just said now.
- Okay sir.

1120
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:28,526
Okay, make it fast.

1121
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:33,299
Where are you going?
- I will freshen up & come.

1122
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:36,201
You sit down. You go.

1123
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:44,072
Why hasn't he come?

1124
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:50,146
Make it fast.

1125
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:04,654
Bloody rat!
Where are you hiding? Come out.

1126
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:21,736
Whatever you order,
it is ready sir.

1127
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:26,834
Today it's my daughter's birthday.

1128
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,799
Take it as I am giving a
party on that occasion.

1129
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:30,366
What happened Munna?

1130
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:31,476
It has turned into
a burial ground.

1131
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:35,913
Look, how many have lost
their lives for me. Look.

1132
01:37:37,718 --> 01:37:40,585
Why are they after my life?

1133
01:37:41,388 --> 01:37:43,151
Why should I kill them?

1134
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,386
Who am I? Who is my father?

1135
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:51,159
Who is this Shankar Pehelwan?

1136
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:55,730
I will tell you. I will tell you
who is Shankar Pehelwan?

1137
01:37:57,404 --> 01:38:00,271
25 years ago we went to Bombay
for our livelihood.

1138
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:02,931
We were coolies there.

1139
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:07,342
Your father was head of coolies
from Andhra Pradesh.

1140
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:09,215
Your mother is Venkata Lakshmi.

1141
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:30,901
71, 72, 73, 74, 75,76,77,
78,79...80.

1142
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:33,767
Sir...what's the matter?

1143
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:35,706
I'II go to home.
- Why?

1144
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:37,571
I've to go to the station.
- Why?

1145
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:39,206
My sister is coming.

1146
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,210
My sister is coming from my village.

1147
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:44,709
She is coming from village.
I've to go to receive her.

1148
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:45,875
Okay, go.

1149
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:47,552
But on one condition.

1150
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:51,447
You prepare a rice...green
and yellow color. What's that?

1151
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:52,387
Pulihora (Tamarind rice).

1152
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:55,788
Come with it tomorrow.
- Definitely sir.- Go.

1153
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:59,227
Go to work. Go...go.

1154
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:01,400
I'II go to station and come.
- Okay.

1155
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:06,903
Crimes also grew with
the growth of Bombay city.

1156
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:13,572
Bade Mian is uncrowned king of
Bombay's criminal world.

1157
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:18,243
Bade Mian was a nightmare
to all businessmen.

1158
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:21,681
You must give a
dinner tonight.- Okay.

1159
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:32,029
Seth, my boss is calling you.
Come here. Come.

1160
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:38,702
Greetings sir.
- Listen my song.

1161
01:39:41,608 --> 01:39:43,439
How is it?
- Song is very good.

1162
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:45,635
How is your business?

1163
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:47,711
Low ebb.- Low?

1164
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:51,714
Tell me why did you change office
and residence phone numbers?

1165
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,719
I was getting lot of
wrong numbers.

1166
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:58,047
No...no.
- Leave him.

1167
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:01,627
Shut up. Thank god,
I have his pistol with me.

1168
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:04,628
He is hot headed.
He eats lots of spicy food.

1169
01:40:04,865 --> 01:40:08,301
I told him not to eat,
but he never cares. Bloody crook.

1170
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:13,531
He will come to you tomorrow.
Keep Rs.25 lakhs ready.

1171
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:15,006
I don't have that much cash.

1172
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:21,473
Rs.25 lakhs will become 28 lakhs.
Go and arrange it.

1173
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:24,640
I will never forget.
I will never forget.

1174
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:48,333
What a delicious smell!

1175
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:51,677
Sir, my sister and brother-in-law.
- Greetings sir.

1176
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:53,903
It means?
- It means brother-in-law sir.

1177
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:56,844
Oh brother-in-law!
What is your name?

1178
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:58,584
He is asking your name.
- Chandra sir.

1179
01:40:58,786 --> 01:40:59,582
Oh Chandra!

1180
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,683
Your brother-in-law is
a good man.

1181
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:03,719
What is he saying?

1182
01:41:03,924 --> 01:41:05,687
He is saying your brother-in-law
is a good man.

1183
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:08,558
Give work to them also.

1184
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:12,529
Okay, it's no big deal.
Okay, join from today.

1185
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:14,462
Thank you sir.- Okay.

1186
01:41:14,802 --> 01:41:18,033
It's very good, father.
Just Rs.40,000 only.

1187
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:23,039
You wait outside, let's discuss later.
Now go to college.

1188
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:26,369
Okay, have you arranged
the money?

1189
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:31,383
There are Rs.5 lakhs in it.
- Bhai wanted Rs.25 lakhs, didn't he?

1190
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:35,046
He did, but I will settle the
balance in a week.

1191
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:39,621
Seth, looks like you've grown
too big for your boots.

1192
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:43,061
No...no...sir, just
give me 5 days time.

1193
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:46,763
Bhai said Rs.25 Iakhs
I will not a penny less.

1194
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:48,730
Or else I will fire a shot
into your head.- Leave me.

1195
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:50,094
Brother Shankar

1196
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:53,629
But...- What but?

1197
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:55,564
Please give me 5 days time.

1198
01:41:55,742 --> 01:41:56,834
Will you pay or not?

1199
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,908
Who are you?
- Shankar sir.

1200
01:42:01,081 --> 01:42:04,073
Madrasi?- I am not Madrasi.
I am from Andhra.

1201
01:42:04,418 --> 01:42:04,816
‘Andhrawala'

1202
01:42:04,985 --> 01:42:06,509
Whoever it may be, get lost
from here. Go away.

1203
01:42:07,087 --> 01:42:10,454
Tell me, money or your life?
...decide.

1204
01:42:10,657 --> 01:42:11,851
Give me little time please.

1205
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:16,421
Didn't I tell you to leave?
Go.

1206
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,094
Who are you man?

1207
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:27,870
Who are these people?

1208
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:30,874
Why have they come here?

1209
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:36,543
What are you they going to do?
Who are you all?

1210
01:42:37,885 --> 01:42:38,681
What's happening here?

1211
01:42:40,454 --> 01:42:48,122
Ask them to leave.
Go away or else I'II fire at him.

1212
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,796
Okay, I'II leave.

1213
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:03,141
Move...move man

1214
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:12,985
Scaring me? I'II take you to task.
Bloody Madrasi.

1215
01:43:13,153 --> 01:43:17,487
We are not Madrasi.
We are from Andhra .... Andhrawala.

1216
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:18,147
Get lost.

1217
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:24,654
Who is he to say? He said & you
came-running tail between legs.

1218
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:26,155
Shut up.

1219
01:43:27,734 --> 01:43:30,498
Go and kill everyone.

1220
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:33,668
What did the bloody say?
- Andhrawala.

1221
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,604
No Andhrawala or any other must
live in Bombay from today.

1222
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:40,510
Ask them to quit Bombay.

1223
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:09,773
What did you say?
Andhrawala, trying to scare me.

1224
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,239
Trying to scare me in Bombay.

1225
01:44:11,645 --> 01:44:14,239
Bloody rogues. No Andhrawala
must reside in Bombay.

1226
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:17,879
I will throw out everyone of them.
Go away.

1227
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:25,251
Didn't you see the Andhrawala
running away lifting his dhoti?- Really!

1228
01:44:32,232 --> 01:44:32,994
What do you say now?

1229
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:46,278
Who are you?

1230
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:51,916
What are you looking at?

1231
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:55,010
Bloody crook

1232
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:00,260
Why did you beat my men?

1233
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:03,688
Do we have to leave Bombay?

1234
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:07,166
Is Bombay your father's
private property? Bloody.

1235
01:45:07,834 --> 01:45:10,098
We are not leaving. Got it?

1236
01:45:10,704 --> 01:45:11,636
We are not leaving.

1237
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:22,045
Hey, listen...listen to me.

1238
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:27,612
If you create any trouble to my men,
I will kill you.

1239
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:30,717
Bloody, I'II cut you down.
Got it.

1240
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:36,122
My men are here. Don't shout.
This country is ours.

1241
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:41,323
Every city, every village is ours.
Your diktats will not work on as...

1242
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:48,240
Can you understand Telugu?
If you can't, learn Telugu.

1243
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:51,742
We will not leave this place.

1244
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:53,304
Bloody

1245
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:55,313
We will not leave.

1246
01:45:56,216 --> 01:45:57,148
‘Andhrawala'

1247
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:05,081
Bhai, what happened to you?
Call the doctor.

1248
01:47:45,926 --> 01:47:49,987
Shankar, I was responsible
for all this mayhem.

1249
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:52,189
Shankar, keep this with you.

1250
01:47:58,205 --> 01:48:02,801
Kill those rowdies,
kill Bade Mian.

1251
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:04,866
Don't think.

1252
01:48:05,278 --> 01:48:07,769
Dear!- Wipe out those rogues.
- No please.

1253
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:13,108
You listen to me.
- No, we'II go back to our native place.

1254
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:49,418
You are a raging fire.
You are a typhoon & an erupting volcano.

1255
01:48:49,956 --> 01:48:56,054
When you fight for justice,
no one can stand before you.

1256
01:48:56,396 --> 01:48:59,422
You were born for us.
You are our companion & shadow.

1257
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:01,733
When you challenge,
enemies shiver.

1258
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:05,904
Any one must bow before you.

1259
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:09,232
Any one going against
you is a dead man.

1260
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:15,846
Your looks are lighting
speed and razor sharp.

1261
01:49:16,082 --> 01:49:19,176
Your word is ultimate.

1262
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,551
You are a man of courage.

1263
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:02,017
You a magnanimous benevolent man.

1264
01:50:02,228 --> 01:50:05,163
People walk behind
you like an army.

1265
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:08,798
They are ready to
sacrifice lives for you.

1266
01:50:09,035 --> 01:50:11,902
Aren't you our strength & power?

1267
01:50:12,138 --> 01:50:14,971
Do what you think is right.

1268
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:18,503
You have a brave heart.

1269
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:31,585
When you live in our hearts,
it's festival for all of us.

1270
01:51:05,025 --> 01:51:11,225
We joined you, chased by
crimes & distance.

1271
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:14,559
When difficulties and
sorrows strike us.

1272
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:17,869
You consoled us with your help.

1273
01:51:18,204 --> 01:51:20,968
If you order, won't the sun
come down to earth?

1274
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:24,208
You are men who can beat
a tide going against it.

1275
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:27,574
When the nation is thrilled
at your arrival.

1276
01:51:27,981 --> 01:51:31,109
Come walking tall like a Prince to
make the country feel proud.

1277
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:37,446
Show the power of
Telugu man to this world.

1278
01:51:37,891 --> 01:51:41,122
Any one contemplating against
us must think twice.

1279
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:39,185
Forgive me son...
Please forgive me.

1280
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:43,220
I thought you'II become
a great cricketer.

1281
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:47,188
But they sent you back
as a corpse.

1282
01:52:49,529 --> 01:52:52,965
Don't worry son.
I will not spare them.

1283
01:52:53,867 --> 01:52:56,631
I will wipe out his
entire family.

1284
01:52:58,638 --> 01:53:01,038
I swear on you.

1285
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:03,865
It is promise.

1286
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,060
Brother.- Suggest a good name to him.
- Me? He will suggest a good name.

1287
01:53:30,336 --> 01:53:31,564
Okay, stand properly.

1288
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:48,746
Oh! Give him to me.
- No, I will change, sister-in-law.

1289
01:54:49,215 --> 01:54:53,982
Bloody, will you kill my son?
Die...die...die.

1290
01:55:27,854 --> 01:55:30,846
That's why, we are worried about
Bade Mian harming you.

1291
01:55:31,691 --> 01:55:34,353
He will kill, if you are here.
You'II be safe there.

1292
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:35,920
Come with me to Katmandu.

1293
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:37,926
Yes Munna, Iet's go
to Katmandu.

1294
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:41,131
We had lost Shankar.
We don't want to lose you also.

1295
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:42,360
Come let's go.

1296
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:44,362
Shall we go away?

1297
01:55:45,138 --> 01:55:47,368
Should I go away to Katmandu
fearing that crook?

1298
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:50,705
You said I am
Shankar PeheIwan's son.

1299
01:55:51,878 --> 01:55:55,041
What would son of Shankar Pehelwan do?
What would he do?

1300
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,075
He will not hide in fear.

1301
01:55:57,283 --> 01:56:01,777
He will face him. He will go & meet
that crook face to face.

1302
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:06,384
He will settle the issue once
for all. He will settle it.

1303
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:09,153
Either he kills him or
dies in the process

1304
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:12,158
Who is ready to die with me?

1305
01:56:12,732 --> 01:56:16,395
I am seeing your father
again in you.

1306
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,966
Shall we go to Bombay?
Shall we settle the issue once for all?

1307
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:23,968
We are going to Bombay.
- Sure.

1308
01:56:24,177 --> 01:56:26,077
Bade Mian is finished...Come.

1309
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:32,308
You are a raging fire.
You are a typhoon & an erupting volcano.

1310
01:56:33,086 --> 01:56:38,991
When you fight for justice,
no one can stand before you.

1311
01:56:39,425 --> 01:56:42,451
You were born for us.
You are our companion & shadow.

1312
01:56:42,862 --> 01:56:44,762
When you challenge,
enemies shiver.

1313
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:48,863
Any one must bow before you.

1314
01:56:49,102 --> 01:56:52,265
Any one going against
you is a dead man.

1315
01:56:56,009 --> 01:56:58,944
Your looks are lighting
speed and razor sharp.

1316
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:02,206
Your word is ultimate.
You are a man of courage.

1317
01:57:34,914 --> 01:57:35,972
It's Basha.

1318
01:57:36,816 --> 01:57:38,306
He's our Shankar's son.
Come.

1319
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:45,482
Basha, is he Shankar's son?

1320
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:48,989
Hey, our Shankar

1321
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:51,162
You are a replica of Shankar.

1322
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:54,390
He is our Shankar's son.

1323
01:57:54,934 --> 01:57:57,334
Munna, come & meet your father.
- Come...come...

1324
01:57:59,005 --> 01:57:59,528
Come, Munna

1325
01:58:02,275 --> 01:58:04,505
Your father lived here.

1326
01:58:38,544 --> 01:58:42,640
Son, these were the clothes your parents
wearing when they were killed.

1327
01:59:04,337 --> 01:59:07,135
After his death our
lives got ruined.

1328
01:59:08,007 --> 01:59:09,599
We are living under
a threat of death.

1329
01:59:10,209 --> 01:59:13,667
Bade Mian & his men are
torturing Telugu speaking people

1330
01:59:14,347 --> 01:59:16,577
It seems we must given them
a cut in our daily wages.

1331
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:19,914
We must bear all
their abuses & beatings.

1332
01:59:20,686 --> 01:59:23,416
We are in a situation not to go
back to Andhra also.

1333
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:26,682
They have forcibly taken
our children also.

1334
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,158
They threaten to kill if we
don't follow their diktats.

1335
01:59:32,365 --> 01:59:37,029
Every boy between 7 to 15 years
is with them

1336
01:59:38,271 --> 01:59:40,296
They've turned them
into drug peddlers.

1337
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:45,039
They give guns & order
them to kill people.

1338
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:48,273
They are asking them to plant
bombs in cars & buses.

1339
01:59:50,716 --> 01:59:53,446
Few children caught are
languishing in jails.

1340
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:57,284
There are many who have lost
limbs in bomb blasts also.

1341
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,058
You've come back after
many years.

1342
02:00:03,062 --> 02:00:04,620
Your father might have
sent you for us.

1343
02:00:05,965 --> 02:00:08,058
Kindly restore our
children back to us

1344
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:12,064
We will leave Bombay
and go away.

1345
02:00:13,406 --> 02:00:14,668
I want to meet the dog.

1346
02:00:15,308 --> 02:00:20,075
He will not meet if you ask.
He must think of meeting you.

1347
02:00:20,646 --> 02:00:21,544
He lives in Dubai.

1348
02:00:23,082 --> 02:00:24,549
Any family members here?

1349
02:00:26,552 --> 02:00:29,214
A concubine lives here
and she has a son.

1350
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:32,422
He has a son, hasn't he?
Will he kidnap our children?

1351
02:00:33,226 --> 02:00:34,090
We will kidnap his son.

1352
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,996
Not only he, all his ancestors
will come down from Dubai.

1353
02:00:46,172 --> 02:00:49,039
Come dear...come.
How was your journey?- Good.

1354
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:50,504
How are you dear?
- Fine, uncle.

1355
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:52,705
We used to live here.

1356
02:00:53,446 --> 02:00:56,506
You, me, your mother
we all lived here once.

1357
02:00:57,783 --> 02:00:59,341
Parvathi, this is my daughter.

1358
02:00:59,685 --> 02:01:02,017
Ramudu, he is my son.
- Greetings.

1359
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:03,717
Did you see Janaki?

1360
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:07,022
She used to wet your
bed as a child.

1361
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:11,529
Your mother also looked
just like you.

1362
02:01:12,865 --> 02:01:13,263
No, she looks like my wife.

1363
02:01:14,367 --> 02:01:16,392
Father, where is Munna?
- Munna is inside.

1364
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:17,591
Take her.

1365
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,602
I am very happy to become
Shankar's kinsman.

1366
02:02:01,781 --> 02:02:06,548
Greek beauty is
pinching me to death

1367
02:02:11,023 --> 02:02:13,457
she is sending a virus
with flowers.

1368
02:02:22,568 --> 02:02:26,834
Receive it you dullard, I am
throwing the net for you only.

1369
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:29,473
She is a shattering beauty.

1370
02:03:13,753 --> 02:03:19,089
Oh dear! Handsome man
of Gudivada I am all yours.

1371
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:26,958
O my dear, give yourself to me.
I will sweep the world under your feet.

1372
02:03:29,635 --> 02:03:33,901
Teach a lesson to my youth.
Take me to the shores of bliss.

1373
02:03:34,106 --> 02:03:38,543
Don't be in a haste dear.
Let's chant the Mantra of love.

1374
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:43,045
A young beauty is insisting you
come on do it man.

1375
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:47,709
A honeybee has struck and
she is falling on me.

1376
02:03:47,887 --> 02:03:50,117
What is the use of the beauty?

1377
02:04:54,053 --> 02:04:59,184
O my dear maiden, come to me.
I will teach you a few tricks.

1378
02:05:02,194 --> 02:05:07,291
Don't worry, I am yours
don't rush in my dear.

1379
02:05:09,869 --> 02:05:14,135
I will create magic and show you
the taste of my manhood.

1380
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:18,868
Let me check your power.
Come let's have a duel.

1381
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:23,310
She is a little girl, but her touch
is like a raging fire.

1382
02:05:23,682 --> 02:05:25,809
I am a girl and I am ready
to jump the fence.

1383
02:05:25,985 --> 02:05:28,010
I can't hold myself any more.

1384
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:30,654
I will show my power.

1385
02:06:05,658 --> 02:06:06,522
Bhai.- Who is that?

1386
02:06:07,426 --> 02:06:07,858
One minute.

1387
02:06:08,527 --> 02:06:10,427
What?- One minute.

1388
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,656
This road...
- Yes, this road...

1389
02:06:23,442 --> 02:06:25,433
Hi, look at me dear.
- Look at him.

1390
02:06:25,878 --> 02:06:28,108
What were you doing?
Giving milk to the child.- Yes.

1391
02:06:28,447 --> 02:06:30,608
I told you many times to look
after your figure.

1392
02:06:30,883 --> 02:06:33,443
But you never bother about it.
Give milk to the child.

1393
02:06:33,686 --> 02:06:35,119
I don't want to talk to you.

1394
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:37,115
Why? Why my darling?

1395
02:06:37,556 --> 02:06:39,023
Are you, still in Dubai?

1396
02:06:39,558 --> 02:06:41,458
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Are you coming here or not?

1397
02:06:43,028 --> 02:06:44,689
There's an important meeting
tomorrow in Dubai.

1398
02:06:44,797 --> 02:06:47,027
A big deal is about to be settled.
We'II be minting money.

1399
02:06:47,232 --> 02:06:50,463
Money...money...money.
What will you do with it?

1400
02:06:50,703 --> 02:06:51,897
For you my dear.

1401
02:06:52,137 --> 02:06:53,161
I want to build a
Taj Mahal for you,

1402
02:06:53,572 --> 02:06:55,972
And I'II not call it
as Taj Mahal.

1403
02:06:56,141 --> 02:06:57,506
I'II call it as Mohini Mahal.

1404
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:00,907
World will watch it awestruck
and we both...

1405
02:07:01,914 --> 02:07:05,179
Hey, look behind you.
- Hey, who is that behind you?

1406
02:07:06,652 --> 02:07:08,847
Look, call the police.

1407
02:07:09,054 --> 02:07:09,713
You?

1408
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:11,812
Are you Bade Mian?

1409
02:07:12,491 --> 02:07:13,822
I want to talk to you.
Where are you?

1410
02:07:14,259 --> 02:07:15,726
In Dubai? Come here.

1411
02:07:18,597 --> 02:07:21,862
Don't touch my son.

1412
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:25,195
Don't shout. I will cut you.

1413
02:07:25,504 --> 02:07:26,528
What do you want?

1414
02:07:26,739 --> 02:07:28,673
You! I want you.

1415
02:07:29,742 --> 02:07:32,677
I mean, you must come here.
I must talk to you.

1416
02:07:32,945 --> 02:07:34,071
Till then, he will
stay with me.

1417
02:07:34,747 --> 02:07:36,009
My son...my son.

1418
02:07:36,215 --> 02:07:41,619
Where are you taking him?

1419
02:08:38,677 --> 02:08:40,144
You go away...go.

1420
02:08:41,013 --> 02:08:43,914
You come here. I've to talk
to you...sit down.

1421
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:45,239
Sit down.

1422
02:08:57,362 --> 02:09:00,024
Tell me. What do you want?

1423
02:09:00,099 --> 02:09:01,828
Do you speak Telugu?

1424
02:09:04,169 --> 02:09:08,299
Can you understand Telugu?
If you can't, learn Telugu.

1425
02:09:09,308 --> 02:09:10,366
I learned.

1426
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:14,777
What is your problem?

1427
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:19,942
Why are you trying to kill me
from my childhood?

1428
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,846
Why are you searching me
for the past 22 years?

1429
02:09:24,056 --> 02:09:27,389
Do you know, if you had spent
the same time in politics.

1430
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,951
You would've been a P.M.
or a C.M. by now.

1431
02:09:30,195 --> 02:09:32,789
Why are you wasting time?
- For this only.

1432
02:09:33,732 --> 02:09:39,329
You've made me come from Dubai
and asking silly questions.

1433
02:09:40,405 --> 02:09:43,863
I searched you all these years
to avoid this day.

1434
02:09:44,209 --> 02:09:45,676
If I had killed you along
with your parents.

1435
02:09:45,878 --> 02:09:47,072
I would've avoided seeing this day.

1436
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:52,314
If I leave an evidence.
I knew it will boomerang on me.

1437
02:09:52,651 --> 02:09:56,212
You might have had
problem with my father.

1438
02:09:56,755 --> 02:09:57,881
I don't have any
problem with you.

1439
02:09:58,657 --> 02:10:01,421
I came to know about my father,
and Shankar from them.

1440
02:10:02,227 --> 02:10:03,990
Why are you killing so many
innocents for me?

1441
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:07,357
What did those little boy do to you?
You killed him.

1442
02:10:07,766 --> 02:10:08,664
You killed the police.

1443
02:10:09,001 --> 02:10:12,095
Poor boy was working in
a roadside eatery. You killed him.

1444
02:10:12,337 --> 02:10:14,999
Why are you killing
so many people for me?

1445
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,902
Your people killed
my brother & my son.

1446
02:10:18,343 --> 02:10:21,176
Will you kidnap my son
born after many years?

1447
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:26,010
Listen, I don't care
what had happened till now.

1448
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:29,843
But if you create only problem to
me or my Telugu people.

1449
02:10:30,122 --> 02:10:32,784
I will kill you.

1450
02:10:33,258 --> 02:10:36,921
By tomorrow morning 9am,
all boys should be in Shankarwadi.

1451
02:10:44,469 --> 02:10:45,367
Kill that bastard!

1452
02:10:50,943 --> 02:10:53,377
Don't unnecessarily trouble me.

1453
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:58,739
You had seen only Shankar Pehelwan.
You haven't seen Munna of 2004.

1454
02:10:59,284 --> 02:11:02,412
Bloody, I will rip you apart.

1455
02:11:02,754 --> 02:11:03,277
Go.

1456
02:11:04,056 --> 02:11:08,891
Munna, don't leave him.
I am telling you.- Go...

1457
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:11,056
Kill him.

1458
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:15,291
Our boys must be in Shankarwadi
by tomorrow.

1459
02:11:19,171 --> 02:11:24,404
I will kill him.
I will kill him.- Go.

1460
02:11:24,743 --> 02:11:26,734
I will kill you...go.

1461
02:11:26,912 --> 02:11:30,404
I will kill him.
I will kill him.

1462
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:52,928
One minute.

1463
02:11:57,876 --> 02:12:00,777
Are you waiting for
my phone call?

1464
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:05,147
You made a mistake
of leaving me yesterday.

1465
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:06,783
I too made a mistake.

1466
02:12:07,019 --> 02:12:09,283
I would've killed you if
I was in your place.

1467
02:12:10,222 --> 02:12:13,214
You left me alive.
But, I will not spare you.

1468
02:12:13,792 --> 02:12:16,124
I will neither spare you
or your people.

1469
02:12:16,495 --> 02:12:18,486
Fool! Where are our boys?

1470
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:22,459
Boys? Didn't see it till now?
Didn't you open the parcel I sent you?

1471
02:12:23,802 --> 02:12:28,034
I've sent a wooden box.
Didn't you see it? Go & see.

1472
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:33,303
Go & find the wooden box.
- Search.

1473
02:12:34,046 --> 02:12:34,910
Munna, wooden box is here.

1474
02:12:46,925 --> 02:12:49,985
Munna, they've killed our boy.

1475
02:12:52,397 --> 02:12:54,160
Look...look.

1476
02:12:56,535 --> 02:12:59,197
Bloody...- Shut up.

1477
02:13:00,605 --> 02:13:02,402
You've grown too big
for your boots.

1478
02:13:03,942 --> 02:13:05,204
You'II see other boys also
meeting the same death.

1479
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:08,402
Remember one thing.

1480
02:13:08,947 --> 02:13:12,405
I am swearing on my dead parents
Every one living in this neighborhood.

1481
02:13:12,851 --> 02:13:15,285
In 2 hours I will kill you.

1482
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:19,185
If I fail, I will never show
my face to you or trouble you.

1483
02:13:19,624 --> 02:13:22,354
Brace yourself to live for 2 hours only.
Wait, I am coming.

1484
02:13:23,195 --> 02:13:23,854
Where's his residence?

1485
02:13:27,299 --> 02:13:28,857
What time the flight is scheduled?
- 1 1 A.M.

1486
02:13:29,201 --> 02:13:33,297
Remember Dubai flight
takes off at 1 1.05 A.M.

1487
02:13:34,106 --> 02:13:37,906
Entire Shankarwadi must go up
in flames at 11.06 A.M.

1488
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:42,444
I must see entire area going up
in flames from above.

1489
02:13:43,982 --> 02:13:46,314
Turn Shankarwadi into
a cremation ground.

1490
02:13:54,893 --> 02:13:56,224
Tell me.
- They have left.

1491
02:13:56,561 --> 02:13:58,119
Where are they heading?
- I don't know sir.

1492
02:13:58,463 --> 02:14:00,055
Check, where are they going?

1493
02:14:00,232 --> 02:14:03,326
What happened?
- They have left the place.

1494
02:14:04,603 --> 02:14:11,406
Come on clear out fast...clear out.
- Get the vehicle quickly.

1495
02:14:37,035 --> 02:14:38,434
He is leaving to Dubai, Munna.

1496
02:15:07,966 --> 02:15:10,457
Is he going there?
Okay, cut the call.

1497
02:15:20,212 --> 02:15:24,046
With the remote not only the boys
but entire area will go up.

1498
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:25,981
Got it?

1499
02:16:06,791 --> 02:16:10,192
I beg you sir, please spare them.
- Go away.

1500
02:16:19,271 --> 02:16:22,707
Are you threatening me?
Bloody Andhrawala!

1501
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:33,708
He has sent the boys
strapped with bombs.

1502
02:16:34,052 --> 02:16:34,746
He's threatening to kill them.

1503
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:37,383
It seems he has sent the boys
strapped with bombs.

1504
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:47,826
Who was on the phone?
What is that?

1505
02:16:53,171 --> 02:16:55,162
You want your children,
bloody old man.

1506
02:16:57,509 --> 02:17:00,069
Will he come & save you?

1507
02:17:03,114 --> 02:17:04,638
I will kill them all.

1508
02:17:07,419 --> 02:17:08,249
Tell me, who is he?

1509
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:40,879
Come on run from the backside.

1510
02:17:44,222 --> 02:17:45,814
Come fast.

1511
02:17:46,157 --> 02:17:46,782
Come...come.

1512
02:17:54,366 --> 02:17:55,128
Come...come.

1513
02:17:58,136 --> 02:18:02,835
Bloody rogues...Come.

1514
02:18:12,851 --> 02:18:13,818
This side...this side.

1515
02:19:09,207 --> 02:19:13,200
Drop the gun.

1516
02:19:19,551 --> 02:19:21,917
Kill him...kill him quickly.

1517
02:19:24,222 --> 02:19:25,917
Fire a shot at him.

1518
02:19:26,324 --> 02:19:32,593
He is arrogant.
Fire a bullet into him.

1519
02:21:25,343 --> 02:21:26,037
No...no..- No.

1520
02:21:39,591 --> 02:21:40,853
Why are you hiding behind
wife & child?

1521
02:21:41,125 --> 02:21:44,356
If I am alive, I can do
anything later.

1522
02:21:46,464 --> 02:21:47,453
Didn't get me?

1523
02:21:48,366 --> 02:21:54,066
If I lose her, I will get another wife.
I can have another son.

1524
02:21:54,939 --> 02:21:56,804
If I die...no way.

1525
02:21:57,075 --> 02:22:00,044
I've seen worst people
but none like you.

1526
02:22:00,712 --> 02:22:02,543
This one reason is
enough to kill you.

1527
02:22:09,821 --> 02:22:13,814
Bloody creep! You want to kill my son.
You want to kill me.

1528
02:22:14,158 --> 02:22:15,955
Brother, kill him.

1529
02:22:18,062 --> 02:22:18,721
Kill him.

1530
02:22:21,833 --> 02:22:24,893
One phone call from me will
make Shankarwadi vanish, can I?

1531
02:22:26,838 --> 02:22:31,104
If you kill them,
will I spare you? Are you acting?

1532
02:22:31,409 --> 02:22:34,071
You needn't do it.
I will make the call.

1533
02:22:41,653 --> 02:22:44,178
Pick the phone.

1534
02:22:49,661 --> 02:22:51,754
Bade Mian is caught.

1535
02:22:52,196 --> 02:22:54,426
He wants me to leave him.
He say he'II kill them.

1536
02:22:54,666 --> 02:22:55,428
What do you want me to do?

1537
02:22:55,667 --> 02:22:58,761
We have been practically
living without them.

1538
02:22:59,203 --> 02:23:01,671
We are ready to die
with our children.

1539
02:23:02,006 --> 02:23:05,772
Don't spare Bade Mian.
Kill him.'

1540
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:10,106
Listen man...- Chop him into
little bits & pieces.

1541
02:23:10,481 --> 02:23:13,211
If I don't kill you;
God will not forgive me.

1542
02:23:14,452 --> 02:23:17,012
When you are not afraid of death,
why are you afraid of those rowdies?

1543
02:23:17,555 --> 02:23:21,787
Rebel against them. Kill them.
Chop them.- Okay, sir.

1544
02:23:23,795 --> 02:23:26,457
We are ready to die
with our children.

1545
02:23:27,031 --> 02:23:29,693
Be ready to die along with us.
Kill them.

1546
02:23:36,474 --> 02:23:38,237
If I don't kill you today,
god will not forgive me.

1547
02:23:38,810 --> 02:23:39,970
My father will not forgive me.

1548
02:23:40,812 --> 02:23:42,643
Kill him...brother kill him.

1549
02:24:13,845 --> 02:24:16,211
Ask the child to stop crying.

1550
02:24:16,614 --> 02:24:19,606
Tell him not to cry for
this rogue's death.

1551
02:24:21,619 --> 02:24:24,087
If he asks about his father,
don't tell about him.

1552
02:24:24,288 --> 02:24:26,188
Don't tell he's the father...

1553
02:24:26,524 --> 02:24:27,855
He is a rogue!

1554
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:29,081
Bloody rogue!

1555
02:24:29,961 --> 02:24:34,955
Go...go away, don't bring him up here.
Go...go far away.
