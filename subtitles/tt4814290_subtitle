1
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,696
What did you steal old man?

2
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,645
Then why are you sitting here?

3
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,078
Madam, I cannot handle
this old man anymore.

4
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,675
He's here again.

5
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,982
You go, I'll take care of it.
- Okay, madam.

6
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,619
Look..the bitch is coming.

7
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,996
Let's go there.

8
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,296
How are you?

9
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,595
Same.

10
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,073
Did you find anything?

11
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:39,013
For the past 8 years..you've
been asking the same question.

12
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,179
I don't haveuanything else to ask.

13
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,189
What's the point of
coming here every day?

14
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,392
I will inform you if I find anything.

15
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,733
Instead of spending your
time with your beautiful wife..

16
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,036
..you're wasting your time here.

17
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,670
I come here for my wife.

18
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:14,041
Unless I visit the police
station once a day"

19
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,346
..she doesn't feel at peace.

20
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,059
Okay, you go home now, John uncle.

21
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,225
I let you know as
soon as I find something.

22
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,531
Okay.

23
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,530
Thank you.
I'll come back tomorrow then.

24
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,056
Oh God!

25
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,408
John, what dish is this?

26
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,413
I don't know what it's called,
saw it on TV.

27
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,175
You remember the recipe.
but you don't remember the name

28
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,474
Really?

29
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,317
There's always another
way to find out.

30
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,120
Looks like you remember
only half the recipe.

31
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,438
It seems I've invented a new dish.

32
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,435
Have you paid the bills, John?

33
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,676
They had sent a message.

34
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,536
No.

35
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,283
lt was too late by the time
I left the Police Station.

36
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,075
I'll do it tomorrow

37
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,255
You remember to go
to the Police Station.

38
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,388
"but not the household chores.

39
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,156
How long will you keep
going to the Police Station?

40
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,627
How long will you keep
sitting there all day?

41
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,266
When will this all end?

42
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,236
Until I get justice.

43
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,410
<i>The sound of your laughter,
like</i> a <i>xyIophone..</i>

44
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,613
<i>I hear it even today“</i>

45
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,151
<i>Your fragrance lingers on..</i>

46
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,990
<i>Though you're long gone..</i>

47
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:57,372
<i>Your place in the house..</i>

48
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,145
<i>Your barren bed..</i>

49
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:14,316
<i>I</i> sense you everywhere,
despite your absence“

50
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:22,092
<i>Why.. o why?</i>

51
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:28,364
<i>Why did you leave me alone?</i>

52
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:35,072
<i>Why.. o why?</i>

53
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:42,346
<i>The shards of memories
are all that remain.</i>

54
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,523
We don't want the police here.
You can go.

55
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,124
Please come..
Please come with me.

56
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,361
All this"

57
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,162
All this is their fault!

58
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,633
It's your fault.

59
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,570
Stop this charade.

60
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,474
If you loved her so much,
then you should've taken care of her.

61
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,213
The reason my daughter is
dead is because of you, John.

62
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,575
Only your fault.

63
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:22,788
<i>I continue to keep your
things in their place"</i>

64
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,792
<i>In silence, I stare at them..</i>

65
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:35,303
<i>I'll wait for your return..</i>

66
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,138
<i>Nothing more that I can do..</i>

67
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:51,645
<i>Let me untangle once again,
your curly locks of hair.</i>

68
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,284
I was going to get this earlier.

69
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:03,225
I troubled your grandma..to
finish this quickly.

70
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,233
Our Angela is growing up pretty fast.

71
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:12,741
<i>Why.. o why?</i>

72
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,039
I'll take the old one back.

73
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:22,383
<i>The shards of memories
are all that remain.</i>

74
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,128
We love you, sweetheart

75
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,292
And we miss you.

76
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,383
Hello.
- Hello.

77
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,356
Can you please call him.
- Who? Martin?

78
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,121
Sure.
- Thank you.

79
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,493
Lord..we expect your blessings.

80
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,655
Father"

81
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,700
One minute.

82
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,399
Lord..we expect your blessings.

83
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,740
And request that the departed soul"

84
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,073
Father, I am getting married.

85
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,509
It's not a funeral.

86
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,074
Doesn't make a difference.

87
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,188
There is not much of a difference.
- What?

88
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,048
Soon you will realize that.

89
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,023
Take a good look at her and imagine..

90
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,460
..how will she look
when she grows old,

91
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,729
Think and decide.

92
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,669
I've decided father.

93
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,800
I do.

94
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,368
It can only warn you.

95
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,597
Ms. Kaveri Paul, you ready.

96
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,769
Yes.

97
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:04,179
John Uncle.. I am sorry,
he can't meet you today.

98
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,622
He had to leave urgently.

99
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,427
Go inside and tell him..

100
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:20,460
"just by changing uniforms
a policeman cannot become a Priest.

101
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:27,644
If he was a real priest he
wouldn't have lied just to avoid me.

102
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,600
"Grandpa..! Grandpa.. !"

103
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,170
"l am sorry, grandpa."

104
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,645
"l made a mistake."

105
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,080
"l should have listened to you.."

106
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:12,522
"l should have listened to you.."
"l should have listened to you.."

107
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,267
"l should have listened to you."

108
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,706
"l shouldn't have
taken the other route."

109
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,272
Last time she was seen
in her school uniform..

110
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,367
..with a cap on her head.

111
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,411
Understand?

112
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,074
During the afternoons
Rippon Street is almost empty.

113
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,479
At around 2pm she
was abducted from there.

114
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,011
There was an eye-witness
who saw that black van.

115
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,999
Who is it?
- Manin.

116
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,546
How are you?

117
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:23,712
Fine.

118
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,683
I hope John is giving you
the medicines on time?

119
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,383
What brings you here today?

120
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,517
Where is that crazy guy.
I don't see him here.

121
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,461
He's gone to the market.

122
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,021
Listen"

123
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,434
Do I look like a fool?

124
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,634
Last week I bought
the same fish from you.

125
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,604
How can it suddenly
become so expensive?

126
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,268
Sir, the elections
are round the corner.

127
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,002
Thats why..

128
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,772
..the party-workers are distributing
fish amongst the people to encash votes.

129
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,537
So the prices have soared.

130
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,607
Last week you had said the
‘prawns’ have became expensive"

131
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,483
..due to the eanhquake in Japan.

132
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,088
What can I do?
I didn't cause the earthquake.

133
00:17:59,145 --> 00:17:59,623
Rubbish!

134
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,022
Listen"

135
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,219
How many kilograms do you want?
- I don't want any.

136
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,262
Now I'll only eat fish
after the elections are over.

137
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,340
Last evening your husband had
come to meet me at the church.

138
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,645
And he left behind half
a kilogram of guilt.

139
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,488
Couldn't sleep all night.
Kept thinking about it...

140
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:33,750
So I came here.

141
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,554
So you managed to dodge
him again?

142
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,653
I had to literally sneak away.

143
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,663
What happened?

144
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,466
Even John makes better tea than this.
- Yes.. but"

145
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,338
Something must be
wrong with the milk.

146
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,410
Who brought it? John?
- Yes.

147
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,578
No wonder.

148
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:10,119
Martin..John needs your help.

149
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,524
He keeps listening to the same tape
every night, over and over again.

150
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,328
He thinks I am asleep,
and I don't know anything.

151
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,603
Please.

152
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,980
"No..no..Angela, you didn't
make any mistake."

153
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,549
"You will be fine..
you will be fine, dear! Don't worry."

154
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,118
"Grandpa! Grandpa!"

155
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,185
"Are you assured novﬂ"

156
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,630
"l will tell you where
to bring the money."

157
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,465
"l will tell you."

158
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,233
"l will tell you."

159
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,208
"l will tell you."

160
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,751
I will talk to him.

161
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,125
Dear, where did you
get this cap from?

162
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,366
This..this cap?

163
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,639
Who gave you?

164
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,105
Who is this?

165
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,744
Excuse me, sir.
I don't want to disturb you.

166
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,440
I just want to know from
where did the girl get the cap?

167
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,812
It belongs to her.
- But...

168
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:56,787
Sir. Sir..that's not her cap.

169
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,256
My wife made that cap for...

170
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,030
This cap..

171
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,004
Isn't it illegal to
make them work like this?

172
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,166
The cap was donated.

173
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,709
Who..who donated it?
- I don't know.

174
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,439
You must have some records.

175
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,071
Maybe, but I don't
have the time for all that.

176
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,742
Please, it's very important.
It's really very important.

177
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,416
Please leave, I've other things to do.

178
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,249
If you want I can make
a donation to the orphanage.

179
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:29,616
Here you go.

180
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,717
<i>We got it from Imambara.
- Huh!</i>

181
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,759
<i>Imambara. Imambara.</i>

182
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,591
The one in Hooghly?

183
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,165
How much are you going to donate?

184
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,997
Where were you, John?

185
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,134
The fan has stopped working again.

186
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,547
Where are the groceries?
- Huh?

187
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,282
Where are the groceries?

188
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,656
I forgot.

189
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,599
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

190
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,505
Oh G0d..

191
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,169
John!
- Huh!

192
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:56,411
Father Manin had come
to see you in the morning.

193
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,043
Yeah..

194
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,515
How are you, John?

195
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,590
Won't you come inside?

196
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:14,387
I seek justice from the Law, not God.

197
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,030
This"

198
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,596
It's the same cap.

199
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,631
She was wearing this
when she was kidnapped.

200
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:23,768
Look..

201
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,365
A.. R..

202
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,036
Angela Roy"

203
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,771
Where did you..

204
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,536
A little girl from the..

205
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,018
..'Little Flowers Deaf'n'Dumb'
Orphanage was wearing it.

206
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,022
<i>You know the Imambara..at Hooghly.</i>

207
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,319
It was donated to the orphanage
by them.

208
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,021
How did it get there?

209
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,626
Who gave it to them?

210
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,286
We must follow this trail?

211
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,428
We can find the kidnapper.

212
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,627
John, it's been 8 years.

213
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,661
Why don't you forget it..

214
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,302
And find another way to attain peace.

215
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,106
Manin. Manin.

216
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,055
I am not going to run away
from the situation like you..

217
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,094
Inspector Manin.

218
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,993
You are trying to shy away
from your responsibilities"

219
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,465
..by becoming a priest now.

220
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,035
You're only trying to hide behind
those white robes.

221
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,104
You had promised me.

222
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,009
You forgot, but I didn't.

223
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,052
You always fail to understand.

224
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,781
That crime was never repeated again.

225
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,214
Criminals are creatures of mind..

226
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,019
..they can change their
location but not their habits.

227
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,718
lam sure he left the city.

228
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,323
It's almost impossible to find him.

229
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,565
My hean says..l'll
surely find something.

230
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,198
"Justice? How will you get justice?"

231
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,742
For that we need
to get to the Imambara.

232
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,978
Your scooter is a piece ofjunk.
How about my bike?

233
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:16,676
<i>Do you know anyone at the Imambara?
- No.</i>

234
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,349
Yes.

235
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:51,485
Little Flowers Orphanage.

236
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,655
Yes, here it is.

237
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,524
We had sent them these items.

238
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,018
In the month of December..

239
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,623
..the graveyard wall was extended.

240
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:07,728
We found an aluminum box,
during the dig that time.

241
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,640
And this cap was one of
the items we found in it.

242
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,269
Was there anything
else in that trunk?

243
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,208
I don't remember clearly.

244
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:20,580
Items that were still usable
were donated to the orphanage..

245
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,745
..and other items were thrown away.

246
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,688
God knows since how long
it was lying there.

247
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,715
Since 8 years!

248
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,393
How do you knovﬂ
- Thanks for your help.

249
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,261
No, no, wait..
we need some more help.

250
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:42,198
Can you show me the exact
spot where you found this trunk?

251
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:46,132
We might find something buried there.

252
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,511
Now there are only graves there.

253
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,208
Only dead bodies buried in.
Nothing more.

254
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,382
<i>Before it became</i>
a <i>part of the Imambara.</i>

255
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,681
..who did this land belong to?

256
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,355
I'll have to check the records.

257
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,474
Uncle John..what are you doing here?

258
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,509
I am looking for..

259
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,675
Still looking for a property
for your son-in-law.

260
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,379
We needed some information
about the Shah family.

261
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:31,986
But they are settled in USA.

262
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,451
It's been more than 25 years.

263
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,991
I handle all their paperwork.

264
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,161
It's not easy to deal with the NRls.

265
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,453
But we had heard that they"

266
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,557
<i>"donated</i> a <i>part of their
property to the Imambara.</i>

267
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,760
Yes, they did.
- So?

268
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,399
That's why Mr.Shah himself had came
here last year.

269
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,096
He donated the land to the Imambara.

270
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,434
..and gave me the job
to find a buyer for the house.

271
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:55,110
8 years ago..in Octoben.

272
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,078
Was anyone from his family here?
- No.

273
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,606
There was no one.

274
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,776
You must stan coming
to the church again.

275
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,041
Instead of clawing at your wounds"

276
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,636
..find a way to heal them.

277
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,249
Did your wounds heal..
Father Martin?

278
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:55,230
<i>It's common belief that life
is nothing but few lines of fate“</i>

279
00:30:55,621 --> 00:31:01,264
<i>Unfortunate I am,
to have witnessed this day.</i>

280
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:07,672
<i>The many dreams I had for you.</i>

281
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,112
<i>How do I let go of them?</i>

282
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:21,421
<i>Gasps of anguish
escape my ageing heart"</i>

283
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:27,756
<i>..for the many unfulﬁlled desires.</i>

284
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,163
<i>Why.. o why?</i>

285
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:39,298
<i>Why did you leave me alone?</i>

286
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,277
<i>Why.. o why?</i>

287
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:54,818
<i>The shards of memories
are all that remain</i>

288
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,263
Mom! Mom!
Open the door, mom!

289
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,738
Mom! Open the door!
- What happened?

290
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,297
He was coming to catch me.

291
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,805
Come on, grandpa, you can do it.

292
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,282
Yes" yes" goal.

293
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,476
Oh no!

294
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,184
Come on, Ronnie. Once again.

295
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,813
No, grandpa.
You don't know how to play.

296
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,581
Can I go play on the ground?

297
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,523
No, play here.
Not on the ground.

298
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:04,993
Okay.

299
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,365
Hello.

300
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,397
Ronnie!

301
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,172
Ronnie!

302
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:57,713
Hello.

303
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:00,607
What?

304
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,707
Who's speaking?

305
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:28,108
I was playing football
with my grandson there"

306
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,736
"right where the car is parked.

307
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,379
Just then my landline
staned ringing.

308
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:35,050
I came upstairs to answer the phone.

309
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:39,253
But..by the time I could answer,
the call got disconnected.

310
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,687
After that when I went down,
I couldn't see Ronnie anywhere.

311
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,693
I called for him, but"

312
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,389
N eeta.

313
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,566
After that, I received
a call on my mobile phone.

314
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,566
I don't know who he was,
but he said"

315
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:57,763
"lf you want Ronnie back,
then do as I say."

316
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,209
Nesta, no..
- Why my son, papa?

317
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,304
No, dear. You will fall sick.

318
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,118
Found anything?

319
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,613
The call was made
from a prepaid number.

320
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,549
Tell the service provider
to track the number.

321
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,490
Sure.

322
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,031
Send it to all the stations?
- Yes.

323
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,191
Excuse me.

324
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,328
Yeah.
- Done.

325
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,065
Mr. Sinha.

326
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,540
He may call again.

327
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,774
We're tapping your calls
on the mobile..even your landline.

328
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,583
Thank you.

329
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,451
But what is your plan?

330
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,313
ls there a threat to
Ronnie's life if you stay here?

331
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,251
What if the kidnapper finds out
that I've informed the police..

332
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,296
"then, he might do something.

333
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,497
If you want to save the child,
then the police are your only hope.

334
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,998
I need details of the
kidnapping reponed last week.

335
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,010
Immediately.
- Okay, madam.

336
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,610
And listen"

337
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,508
I also want the case
files of John Biswas.

338
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,118
The 8 year old kidnapping case.

339
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,746
Okay, madam.

340
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,390
I am deeply shocked about his death.

341
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,423
May the almighty grant him salvation!

342
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,225
That's all I can say.

343
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,629
Good bye.

344
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,227
Sir, if I couldn't remember
anything yesterday.

345
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,295
..how can you expect
a miracle to happen today!

346
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,039
What's the point in
coming here every day?

347
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:45,474
This is the first clue in 8 years.

348
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,276
I can't ignore it so easily.

349
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,346
Yes.

350
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,012
What are you doing here?

351
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:25,553
Getting married.

352
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,247
Soon.

353
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,584
What?

354
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,525
That's bad news" I mean a big news.

355
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,365
Why do you look so surprised?

356
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,370
I am not that bad looking.
- No, I mean..

357
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,541
You are..

358
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,646
I am what, father?

359
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,045
I mean, you are..

360
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,351
Come on, father.

361
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,385
Say what's on your mind.

362
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,319
There's no one here except for you,
me and God.

363
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,332
Are you really getting married?

364
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:17,972
No!

365
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,315
A child has been kidnapped.

366
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,094
What novﬂ

367
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,429
Please get back to your work.

368
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,437
My scooter is giving me some trouble.

369
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,105
Do you have
a spare wire or something?

370
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,475
The spark-plug has got choked,
I'll have to clean it.

371
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,174
Sometimes it gives me trouble.

372
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,086
Otherwise it flies like an airplane.

373
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,289
Wait here, I will check.
- Sure.

374
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,158
I read your case files .. It
looks like the same criminal is back.

375
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,524
What's the connection
with the 8 year old case?

376
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,059
No, no, you're thinking
in the wrong direction.

377
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,635
Both the cases are
completely different.

378
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,059
Think about it.

379
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,163
You couldn't catch him last time.

380
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:26,241
So this time he's giving
you another opportunity.

381
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,404
I don't want a second chance.

382
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,136
Thank you very much.

383
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,742
Even to tell him that,
you've to catch him first.

384
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,613
Please help me.

385
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,691
I've never dealt with
a kidnapping case before.

386
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,258
And you have been an expert on this.

387
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,155
Was that a joke or a taunt?

388
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,531
I am asking for your help?

389
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,728
You can take all the
help from the old case files.

390
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,632
I came here because
I have already read them.

391
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,501
What's your problem, Martin?

392
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,504
Sorry.

393
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,678
Father Martin!

394
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,112
There's no harm if you
read the current case file once.

395
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,481
I've forgotten everything.

396
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,646
That's why..
- Leave everything to God..

397
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:16,188
We try to give ourselves
undue importance.

398
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,665
I see" so now that's
the solution to all your problems.

399
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:29,798
Those who can't help themselves,
can never be of any help to God.

400
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,575
Now it's God's turn.

401
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,543
You've already
disappointed everyone else.

402
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,111
John, the police department"

403
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,483
..and me!

404
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,564
See, maybe you can
find something useful in this.

405
00:40:57,756 --> 00:41:00,100
Thank you. Thank you.

406
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,483
Thank you. It's fixed.

407
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:19,681
Thanks to this
this pen and this wire.

408
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,121
Great.
- My job's done.

409
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,183
Thank you. Thank you.

410
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,231
Sir.

411
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,805
Wait..wait, sir.
Wait.

412
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:40,236
It took two months, but the
finally a miracle has happened.

413
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,604
This incident
reminded me of something else.

414
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,272
I didn't understand.

415
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,740
This pen was in that trunk as well.

416
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,517
It completely slipped out of my mind.

417
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:51,052
Look.

418
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:57,691
Madam.

419
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,193
We can't find her father.

420
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,762
Let him be.

421
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,635
Maybe he doesn't want to talk
to the kidnapper in front of us.

422
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,070
He's concerned about Ronnie's safety.

423
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,073
80..

424
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,207
Father Martin! You?

425
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,250
How did you leave God alone today?

426
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,784
Sisten. What happened?

427
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,753
She had a hean
surgery many years ago.

428
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,055
Her hean is weak.

429
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,355
And she can't handle too much stress.

430
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,363
Call the doctor.
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,188
Careful.

432
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:38,566
Give her some water.

433
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:42,537
Where's her husband?
- In the army.

434
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,164
He's posted in the North East.

435
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:47,743
He's been informed and will
be here by evening.

436
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,109
But madam,
what if the kidnapper calls novﬂ

437
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,139
I'll pretend to be
the mother and talk to him.

438
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,616
Yes, what if..

439
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,516
If he finds out that
I am not the mothen.

440
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:02,489
..then we'll know that
he knows the family really well.

441
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:07,994
But why isn't he calling?

442
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:48,763
Hello.

443
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,098
Grandpa! Help!

444
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,642
Ronnie. How are you son?
- Please save me.

445
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:55,769
Grandpa won't let
anything happen to you.

446
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,035
J ust don't worry.

447
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,409
Grandpa! Help...!

448
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,427
Hello.

449
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,396
Why did you call the police?

450
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,329
Your grandchild is in my custody.

451
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,993
So stop wasting my time.

452
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,164
If you want him back alive then arrange
for two million by tomorrow morning.

453
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,502
I will call again.

454
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,635
Hello, I am his mother speaking.

455
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,337
ls my son alright?

456
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,741
I want evidence that he's alright.

457
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,644
Hello.. Hello..

458
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,611
Find anything?

459
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,786
No, madam..we had very little time.

460
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:55,360
But yes, we have tracked a 2-3
kilometer radius around his location.

461
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,659
Send details to all the police units.
- Yes.

462
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:01,203
Where's Manohar? Call him.

463
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:02,336
Yes, madam.

464
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,140
He left his mobile
here and disappeared.

465
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:16,515
It's okay.

466
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:18,281
Leave a message for him at home.

467
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,611
The other units have already
left for the location..

468
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:23,181
I am going there but you stay here.
- Yes, madam.

469
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:42,040
John. What is this paper?
- Huh!

470
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:46,041
lt's just a logo, that's all.

471
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,574
Seems like a bird.

472
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,078
I've seen it before.

473
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:59,159
John!! When you
were buying the property for Peten.

474
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:03,221
"those documents
had the same symbol..remember..

475
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:23,150
The property papers were right here.

476
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,214
Where are they?
- I don't know.

477
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,480
Maybe Peter took it with him.

478
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,229
Where are you going?

479
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,034
There's something I need to do.
- What?

480
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:51,275
I've finally got my hands
on something concrete, Nancy.

481
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:54,741
Something which the police..
- Enough John.

482
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:58,009
That's enough.

483
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:00,984
When will this end?

484
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:22,237
I couldn't do anything
for my daughter.

485
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:32,043
And after she was gone, I couldn't
take care of our Angela also.

486
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:37,718
I can't sleep at night.

487
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:46,461
I have to find the man
who took Angela away from us.

488
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:57,708
And I promise you.. I will find him.

489
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,409
Tell me John uncle.

490
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,146
Do you want to sell
or buy a property this time?

491
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,443
Well..

492
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,087
When we were buying the
property for Peter..

493
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:20,155
..this logo was on one of the papers.

494
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,029
Which company does it belong to?
- This.

495
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:24,226
It's logo of the government office.

496
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,767
This symbol belongs to the
Land Measurement Office.

497
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:27,559
What happened?

498
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,367
Can you give me the
address of that office?

499
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,138
Tell me what you need uncle.

500
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,436
I can get your job done.

501
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,034
I've many contacts.

502
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,578
But if you want to deal with some
other agent, then that's different.

503
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,343
No, no, just give me the address.

504
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,543
A friend of mine needs it..
he's got some personal work there.

505
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,644
Sure?

506
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,221
Fine!

507
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:50,158
Sarita, there's one
thing that is bothering me.

508
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:53,152
The ransom call that was made...

509
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,322
We found no fingerprints
on the phone.

510
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,694
He cleaned everything.

511
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:59,431
No, no..l am saying
something else here.

512
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,593
The ransom call that we received..

513
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,366
..we could hear traffic at the back.

514
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:09,341
But..there was no traffic around
the PCO from where the call was made.

515
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,482
But the service provider
confirmed the location.

516
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,449
"that's where the call came from.

517
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,453
Let's wait for the lab
reports on the cigarette butt.

518
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,808
This was a corporate gift.

519
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:58,747
Given by a big builder in
the year 2006-2007.

520
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,416
To all the employees.

521
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:05,184
How many people
worked here back then?

522
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,691
Around 2000 people..
- 2000?

523
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,034
That's a rough figure. Could be more.

524
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:16,596
Can I get a list of their names?

525
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,274
Go to the Administrative Department,
and find out yourself.

526
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:21,136
Go on.

527
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,471
This way.
- Yes.

528
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,347
I've come from very far, son.

529
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:29,182
I want to sell my land
before my daughter's marriage.

530
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,477
That's not my problem.

531
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,552
There are so many
old cases still pending.

532
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,690
You will have to wait
for at least a month.

533
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,191
Please go.

534
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,482
Next!

535
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:44,759
What happened, uncle?

536
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,429
He said it will take a month.

537
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,368
One month.. that's nonsense.

538
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,337
Give me your phone number.

539
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,168
The manager is my cousin.

540
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,073
But...
- I'll call him and get your job done.

541
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:58,636
You see, this is not
the way to get things done..

542
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,409
Who is John Biswas?

543
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,609
Please come with me.

544
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,211
Come with me, I'll solve your problem.

545
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:09,081
Look, sir,
I am really surprised by your request.

546
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:14,457
You want our 8-9 year
old employee records

547
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,125
for some
kidnapping investigation.

548
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:21,032
Not only kidnapping.. also murder.

549
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:25,007
The child who was
kidnapped didn't survive.

550
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:30,272
But we didn't received any
such requests from the police.

551
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:35,313
The case isn't closed yet.
It's still being investigated.

552
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,148
And the kidnapper is roaming free.

553
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:39,047
And you know..

554
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,022
Sir, why you don't
understand what I am saying.

555
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,556
Why didn't the police
send us an official request?

556
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:51,364
Well 
..can get a written order
from the police if you want"

557
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:52,693
"but you know,
these things take time.

558
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,293
If you can help me out,
I'll be..

559
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,806
Look sir,
when you have waited for 8-9 years"

560
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,440
"so a few more weeks
shouldn't matter.

561
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,668
I suggest you to get the
police to send us a request"

562
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:05,570
..and we'll do the rest.

563
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:12,987
Sir, maybe you can treat this case
as an exception and help me out.

564
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,316
This list is very important for me.

565
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:17,689
A new lead will really help me a lot.

566
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:21,195
Please..l am busy. You may go now..

567
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,465
Hello sir, am I late?
- No.. no.

568
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,536
Would you like something to eat?
- No, sir. I am fine.

569
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,171
Here you go.

570
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,165
These are the entire
records you had asked for..

571
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,733
..l think this will be useful to you.

572
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:15,746
Sir, is there fuel in the tank?
- Huh?

573
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,618
ls there fuel in the tank? - Yes.

574
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,450
There should
be around 1-2 liters.

575
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:23,651
Okay fine. Thank you, sir.

576
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,555
I came directly from work.

577
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:36,627
Give it to me.

578
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,409
Sir, I always dreamt
of buying a scooter.

579
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:46,011
Sir, the helmet"

580
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,343
Okay, sir. Thank you.

581
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,491
Please stan.

582
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,621
Guess it's out of fuel.

583
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:19,472
You keep it.

584
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,264
I didn't hear your scooter.

585
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,400
It's in the garage.

586
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,482
Leave it on. I haven't finished yet.

587
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:29,347
I'll sleep once I'm done reading this.

588
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,614
Don't stay up too late.

589
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,639
Merry Christmas, John.

590
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:31,413
She turned 16, an hour ago.

591
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,173
She was born on this day"

592
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:36,713
Christmas eve.

593
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:41,146
That's why we named her Angela.

594
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:43,321
Angel..Angela.

595
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,620
I will pray for her..
and for you too.

596
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,059
Let God grant you peace.

597
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,754
I neither want peace
nor your prayers.

598
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:55,559
What's this?
- Some names.

599
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,101
If you've ever heard
about anyone from the list"

600
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:02,234
..maybe with some criminal record.

601
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:08,148
The Land Measurement Office knew that
I was buying a property for Peter.

602
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,643
And I have money.

603
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:15,554
The police never paid
attention to this detail.

604
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,386
Soon after this incident"

605
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,754
..few people quit their job.

606
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,598
This is a list of those people.

607
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:30,728
If you've ever heard about them,
or have any records ..

608
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,235
This isn't the time
to talk about all this.

609
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:39,512
Take a look, maybe..
- Father.

610
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,209
My daughter made
this card for you.

611
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,252
My God!

612
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,751
You made this?

613
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,652
It's really beautiful.

614
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,196
I'll always keep it with me.

615
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,301
Bhaskar.

616
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,436
Hello.

617
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,176
You wanted proof of life, didn't you?

618
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:19,080
A garbage truck will pass by your
house in less than three minutes.

619
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:31,230
Hey stop! Stop!

620
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:31,790
It's the same kidnapper.

621
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,218
He's back.

622
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:40,191
You were right.

623
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,236
So this is exactly how..

624
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,808
..he had sent you evidence
that the child is alive.

625
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,276
Then?

626
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,757
He has asked you to keep
the bag near the pillar.

627
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,995
So keep it there and don't wait.

628
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,730
The police will have covered
the entire railway station by then.

629
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,163
So don't worry about it.

630
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:20,040
I am scared.

631
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:27,079
He kept saying..don't
involve the police.

632
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,173
I hope there won't be a problem.

633
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,116
No, no, there won't be any problem.

634
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,620
We'll arrest him and save Angela.

635
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,220
So don't worry.

636
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,450
Bhaskar, listen"

637
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,261
You should talk to Peter once.

638
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,603
Angela is his daughter.

639
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,141
He has all the right to know.

640
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,279
I'll tell him once
Angela is back home safely.

641
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,438
Or else he'll get
scared and will panic.

642
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,745
John.

643
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:08,651
I must go now.

644
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,555
All units are ready?

645
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,457
Hey, shut the station.

646
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:22,428
Nobody should get out.

647
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:28,035
It was all in vain.

648
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,094
We couldn't catch him.

649
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,332
If it's the same guy..

650
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,669
..do you think he'll
plan something similar?

651
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,305
I can bet on it.

652
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,112
You may have stopped
wearing the uniform, but"

653
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,320
..you still sound like a policeman.

654
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,488
Whom are you trying to deceive ?
Your God ..or your own self..

655
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,151
Father Martin"?

656
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,166
Hello.

657
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:03,463
Did you get proof of life?
- Yes.

658
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,133
But I want to talk to Ronnie.

659
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:07,539
You will get your chance.

660
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:09,669
But right now,
collect your parcel from the entrance.

661
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,304
Parcel?

662
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,142
What happened after
the station incident?

663
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:58,716
I want the file immediately.
- Yes, sir.

664
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,091
Martin!

665
01:07:04,588 --> 01:07:05,965
Have you lost your mind?

666
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,731
You lost 20 lakhs of police money.

667
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:13,496
Sorry sir, but we have the
serial numbers of the notes.

668
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:18,239
Means what? Until he doesn't spend
the money we cannot trace him..

669
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,042
Till then we'll be sitting idle.

670
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,313
With our hands in our pockets.

671
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,517
And now you want the kidnapper to
do your job for you..

672
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:30,251
..he has made a fool
out of all of you.

673
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:31,549
Shame on you.

674
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,287
Extremely sorry, sir, but we..

675
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,658
I am taking over this case!

676
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,224
Put the entire unit
to trace the money back.

677
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:41,298
Raise an alen in the city..sniff
the money out... like dogs.

678
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:45,769
You have made us all
look like a piece of shit.

679
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:49,541
Extremely sorry, sir, but we
should have a unit at John's home.

680
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,738
What if the kidnapper...

681
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,310
Have you lost your mind, Martin?

682
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,342
The kidnapper has the money now.

683
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,018
Will he call back to say thank you?

684
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,211
Idiot!

685
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:08,091
Manin, just do as
you're told. Got it?

686
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,444
What are you guys doing here?

687
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:29,381
Who is at John's home?

688
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:30,645
Chief on the wireless
asked us to come back"

689
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,584
You should have waited for my order.

690
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:33,714
Who's there novﬂ

691
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,453
There's no one,
we just left the recorder at his home.

692
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:36,650
Left the recorder..

693
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:38,348
What happened, sir?

694
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,189
There's a difference between a
recorder and an order, idiots.

695
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,730
What can the recorder do?

696
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,660
What happened?

697
01:08:59,202 --> 01:08:59,771
Hello.

698
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,482
You shouldn't have betrayed me.

699
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:04,314
You shouldn't have called the police.
- I'm sorry!

700
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:06,513
Now I'll do exactly as you say.

701
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:11,386
Please..don't hurt Angela.

702
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:14,156
Fine, I'll give you another chance.

703
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,657
Grandpa.. Grandpa...
- Angela... Angela...

704
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,258
I‘ m sorry Grandpa.

705
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,197
It was my fault.

706
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,603
I should have listened to you.

707
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:29,535
I shouldn't have taken the shoncut.

708
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:34,004
No, Angela.
You didn't make any mistake.

709
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:36,241
You will be fine..you'll be fine.

710
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,548
Grandpa! Grandpa!

711
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,147
Are you assured novﬂ

712
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,215
I will tell you where
to bring the money.

713
01:09:58,161 --> 01:10:00,732
John, this is Peter's money.

714
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,470
We cannot take it.

715
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:04,635
This was meant for
buying that property for him.

716
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:10,652
Peter would've done the
same thing if he was in my place.

717
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:18,492
There's a 12 hour time difference
between here and there.

718
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:21,061
He must be sleeping now.

719
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:25,157
It will take time to
explain everything to him, Nancy.

720
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:29,761
And I don't have time.

721
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:34,507
We should've told him when
this happened in the first place.

722
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,771
It's not right to
keep him in the dark.

723
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,341
It's not right, John.

724
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,645
At least talk to Manin once.

725
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:43,651
Do you see any policeman here?

726
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,783
D0 you?

727
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:50,056
This is their fault.

728
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:52,122
and now they have left us alone.

729
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,721
We must do this on our own, Nancy.

730
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:56,061
On our own.

731
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,269
John.

732
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,402
Where's John?
- Manin, the kidnapper called again.

733
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,269
John went alone.

734
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,514
"Grandpa!"

735
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:17,215
"Are you convinced novﬂ"

736
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,117
"l will tell you where
to bring the money."

737
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,513
As you drive out of the city..

738
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:26,583
..you'
l come across a
dirt track on your right.

739
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,629
Drive down that path,
through the jungle.

740
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:32,760
Then you will find a signboard"

741
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:38,533
"that reads, Kalikapur 5 kms.

742
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,468
J ust wait there.

743
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,676
Hello. Yes, Manin speaking.

744
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,179
I've some new information.

745
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:48,216
Send all teams to Kalikapur.

746
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:52,549
Sir.. we have tracked the marked
notes in a mobile shop at New Market.

747
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:54,589
The kidnapper is misleading you.

748
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,281
The exchange is happening
near Kalikapur, got it?

749
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:01,719
Sir, you please speak to our Chief.
He is leading the units.

750
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:05,358
Wear the garbage bag over your head.

751
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,722
After that?

752
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:17,630
I think we have reached.

753
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,773
We will board the train two
stations ahead of the main station..

754
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:27,207
This time we will have
to catch him inside the train.

755
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:31,352
Last time we didn't focus
on the train.

756
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,316
This time we know.

757
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,346
So that has to be covered.

758
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,580
I am coming with you.

759
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,090
Then who will go with the ransom bag?

760
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,431
The real mother has
to go and deliver the bag.

761
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:47,725
He may not recognize her voice,
but maybe he knows her face.

762
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,797
We can't take that risk.

763
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:26,234
He is in that companment.
Let's go there.

764
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:40,652
Mrs. Nesta, don't be scared.

765
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:42,587
We have placed a
tracker inside the bag.

766
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,623
Leave the bag near the pillar.

767
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:47,694
Tracker is on mark Sir.

768
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,593
The train is reaching
on platform number 1.

769
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:53,667
All teams alen.

770
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,192
The train is approaching
platform no. 1.

771
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:59,300
Platform team, be alert.
and take your positions?

772
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,334
Phone booth unit is ready.

773
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:25,598
Platform is full of army cadets.

774
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:27,396
There are army cadets everywhere.

775
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:29,701
The bag isn't visible!

776
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:35,474
The bag's moving! The bag's moving!

777
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,374
It's heading towards platform no.2.

778
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:39,344
Keep watching. Keep watching.
- Okay, sir.

779
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,416
They can't find the bag.

780
01:15:44,507 --> 01:15:45,542
I should go to my team.

781
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:47,110
I'll look on the other side,
I missed that last time.

782
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:47,654
Yes.

783
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:57,721
Move.

784
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,674
The bag's heading
towards platform no. 3.

785
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,719
The tracker is static.

786
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,554
Madam, signal is lost.

787
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,184
What?
- Signal is lost, madam.

788
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:28,518
Manin.

789
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,191
He's here.

790
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,323
Leave me.

791
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,195
I have already told you..

792
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:44,337
He called me and told me to do this.

793
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:47,166
Why don't you believe me?

794
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:52,208
Actually, I haven't slept
properly since the last few days.

795
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:58,014
So it's hard to put everything
together in my head.

796
01:17:58,608 --> 01:18:00,986
Will you repeat that again, please?

797
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:03,622
You're making me
repeat again and again..

798
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,422
"so that I make a
mistake and you nail me.

799
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,057
But that won't happen, ma'am..
because I am telling the truth.

800
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:15,258
lt won't change no matter
how many times I say it.

801
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:21,168
You seem quite familiar
with interrogation methods.

802
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:22,635
H ovﬂ

803
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,240
By the way, you don't need to worry.

804
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:27,973
This time I will write it down.

805
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,983
Bablu, get me a pen and a paper.

806
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,151
So you received a call from him?

807
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:37,953
Yes.

808
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:41,023
Then?

809
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:43,524
Yeah, okay.

810
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:51,496
Yes, I am here.

811
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,571
I can see the road.

812
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:02,382
Grandpa help!
Grandpa, where are you?

813
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:03,343
Ronnie?

814
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:07,181
Grandpa, where are you?
Grandpa help!

815
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:15,587
Grandpa, where are you?
Grandpa help!

816
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:17,688
Ronnie! Ronnie!

817
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,185
Grandpa helP!

818
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,414
Grandpa, where are you?
Grandpa help!

819
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:43,184
Ronnie
- When will you come, grandpa?

820
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:47,216
Grandpa, come fast.
Grandpa help!

821
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,594
Grandpa help! Please.

822
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:53,190
When will you come, grandpa?

823
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:56,964
Grandpa help! Please!

824
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,582
Hey stop!
Where is Ronnie?

825
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,982
Open the door.

826
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:17,215
I kept yelling for help,
but no one came.

827
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,692
I don't know how long
I was locked up in there.

828
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,392
There was no way to escape.

829
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,197
I kept looking around
in the dark for a while.

830
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:30,628
And then sat down.

831
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,141
The paper had an information for me..

832
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:12,941
It read, wear the uniform..

833
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:15,676
..and go to the place,
programmed in the GPS in 30 minutes

834
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:18,214
Even a delay of one minute,
will cost the child's life.

835
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,158
Am I allowed to smoke in here?

836
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:29,985
No.

837
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:32,321
But there's no one to complain either.

838
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,283
Thank you.

839
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:02,990
Please believe me.

840
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:05,260
He still has Ronnie with him.

841
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:09,264
You're wasting your time.
You can still save Ronnie.

842
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:11,266
Where's your car?

843
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:14,063
Don't know..

844
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:15,631
I left it outside the railway station.

845
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:17,606
And your mobile?

846
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:22,674
When I was crossing the
Hooghly bridge, he called again.

847
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,551
He told me to throw away my phone.

848
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:30,490
I asked him where will I find Ronnie?

849
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,654
And he said there's a
bag in the boot of the car..

850
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:38,091
..which I must exchange
at the railway platform.

851
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:40,396
Later I must run
to the end of the station.

852
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,936
..and throw it across the wall
on the other side.

853
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,101
I was about to throw the bag,
when you caught me.

854
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:51,205
He also said that..if
I succeed in throwing the bag..

855
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:54,381
..l will find Ronnie on
the other side of the wall.

856
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,147
And you believed him.

857
01:23:00,443 --> 01:23:02,582
Did I have a choice?

858
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,187
You can cry later.

859
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:12,126
First finish your cigarette.

860
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:14,025
My officers will be here soon"

861
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,427
..and they are not as generous as me.

862
01:23:24,934 --> 01:23:26,311
Seems like the same brand.

863
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:32,077
You should be happy, Father Manin.

864
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,014
We finally found your kidnapper.

865
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:35,553
I am haPPY-

866
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:38,251
I am quite happy
the way you handled it.

867
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:41,920
But I feel somethings wrong.

868
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:56,565
<i>The shining sun of joy..</i>

869
01:23:56,632 --> 01:24:00,273
<i>The radiant dome of bIiss..</i>

870
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:05,547
<i>It submerged the envious
glances..total eclipse!</i>

871
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:11,152
<i>Effective was his pIoy..</i>

872
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:14,592
<i>..in ill-fated times..</i>

873
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:18,996
<i>..it spread like venom..
total eclipse!</i>

874
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:29,236
<i>The shining sun of joy..</i>

875
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:32,905
<i>The radiant dome of bIiss..</i>

876
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:37,417
<i>It submerged the envious
glances..total eclipse!</i>

877
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,522
<i>A woe unexpected“</i>

878
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,220
<i>Like termite..</i>

879
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:52,288
<i>It gnawed away,
bit by bit..total eclipse!</i>

880
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:59,395
<i>The vision is foggy..</i>

881
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:02,533
<i>All the doors are shut..</i>

882
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:07,604
<i>Every assurance sounds false...</i>

883
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:13,877
<i>The voice quivers..</i>

884
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:17,048
<i>A secret behind the curtain.</i>

885
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:22,619
<i>Why isn't it being revealed?</i>

886
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:26,258
Excuse me. Mister.

887
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:31,335
Manager? Manager?
- Yes, that's me. Tell me.

888
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:34,533
I am a..journalist.

889
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:38,476
I am writing an article"

890
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,413
..on the dying mill industry.

891
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,474
..and the abandoned
ones that are still functioning.

892
01:25:45,074 --> 01:25:49,489
The mill owner, Mr. Hari Prakash.

893
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:51,456
I want to talk to him.
Where is he?

894
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:53,593
He hasn't arrived yet.
- Huh?

895
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,895
He hasn't arrived yet.
- I see.

896
01:25:57,186 --> 01:26:00,463
Where's his office?
- First floor.

897
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,468
Huh?
- First floor.

898
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:04,435
Okay, where is first floor?

899
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,460
Father Manin, we've a warrant.

900
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:36,334
We're going to search Manoher's house.

901
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:38,971
Will you come along?

902
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,438
I don't know.

903
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:51,844
Did you ever feel that
your father could do..

904
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:53,580
He loved Ronnie a lot.

905
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:55,983
I just can't believe this.

906
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:58,347
Why will he do such a thing?

907
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,528
Honestly, I've seen
stranger cases than this in my career.

908
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,895
But are you sure he's the one?

909
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:08,096
Because I just don't get it.

910
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:13,062
Although..since I got here,
everyone pointed out..

911
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:16,234
..that he's been missing
from the moment you came here.

912
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,041
Just a minute.

913
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,352
What is your opinion about him?

914
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:30,884
Honestly, I don't know him too well.

915
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:34,393
All I know is that he worked
somewhere in the Gulf.

916
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:36,997
He didn't attend
our wedding either.

917
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:40,558
But yes, he did come
when Neeta was pregnant.

918
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,566
By then I was already
posted in the North-east"

919
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:45,369
..and I would only
come home during holidays.

920
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:47,565
There was not much interaction.

921
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:52,111
When Neeta told me that
he'll stay with us.

922
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:53,674
I thought it's okay.

923
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:54,607
Because I hardly stay here.

924
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,479
If someone stays with
Neeta in my absence"

925
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:57,573
..it will be good for her.

926
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:04,551
There's one thing though, we didn't
get along on certain issues.

927
01:28:06,148 --> 01:28:07,218
ls this your house?

928
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,619
Yeah, this is a family house.

929
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:12,632
So..where did Neeta and
Manohar live before your wedding?

930
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,626
They had a small house in Barrackpur.

931
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:34,712
Did you check here?

932
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:42,329
Sarita.
- Yeah.

933
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,030
Look.

934
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:50,095
Same wall. Same marks.

935
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:55,032
So this is where
the picture was taken?

936
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:04,645
You mean to say that someone
from the Land Measurement Division"

937
01:29:04,907 --> 01:29:06,045
"was involved in the kidnapping.

938
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:11,182
Because the people
in your office knew..

939
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:16,391
..that I am buying a land,
and the amount of money I had.

940
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:25,994
The police focused on every aspect,
but left this one out.

941
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:32,343
Didn't you ever suspect him?

942
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:34,245
Kumar?

943
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:38,574
He was thrown out for fradulence
and mishandling of money.

944
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:44,048
Kumar?

945
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,259
Sir, Manohar also worked
in a government office.

946
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,928
Back then he had a steady income.
- Yes.

947
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:51,658
Then suddenly one day he quit.

948
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,966
So he never got pension
or retirement benifits.

949
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,666
Before his wife's death, she"

950
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,339
"transferred her village property
in the name of her daughter.

951
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,237
Oh, I see.

952
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:04,140
The same property,
which his son-in-law"

953
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:06,201
..Neeta's husband wanted to sell.

954
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:09,513
Because he couldn't
maintain the place.

955
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:13,109
If he had sold the house, then Manohar
would've been left with nothing.

956
01:30:13,175 --> 01:30:15,314
He would've been dependant
on his son-in-law.

957
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,390
And they don't get along, Sir.

958
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:22,290
So according to me, this kidnapping
was Manohar's retirement plan?

959
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,988
Then, what about the media?

960
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,163
Sir, we have matched his DNA with the
cigarette butt found outside the PCO.

961
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,101
We already have a prime suspect.

962
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,938
But I suggest that we
shouldn't go to the media..

963
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:38,635
..Till we find Ronnie.

964
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:40,539
We're looking for Manohar's car.

965
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:42,273
Okay Sarita,
find it as soon as you can.

966
01:30:42,337 --> 01:30:45,910
Because I don't think I
can hold back the media for long.

967
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:47,317
Understand?
- Yes, sir.

968
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:51,557
So what's the Commissioner saying?

969
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,051
He's asked me to find
Ronnie as soon as possible.

970
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:57,386
But he's also in a hurry to inform
the press about Manohar's arrest.

971
01:30:57,586 --> 01:30:58,462
Oh...

972
01:31:04,059 --> 01:31:04,560
What?

973
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:07,339
What's bothering you?

974
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:11,007
You've seen all the evidence.
Why don't you accept it?

975
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:19,143
You answered his ransom call.

976
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:22,611
Wouldn't he have
recognized your voice?

977
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,690
But he kept
talking to you as Neeta.

978
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:26,684
Why?

979
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:29,494
Maybe I sound like
Neeta over the phone?

980
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,355
Or maybe the line wasn't clear?

981
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:34,965
Bad connection..every time?

982
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:37,334
That's your argument.

983
01:31:55,544 --> 01:31:56,488
Where is Ronnie?

984
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:02,893
I told you I don't know.
I didn't kidnap him?

985
01:32:06,288 --> 01:32:09,929
You know your daughter
has a hean problem. Right.

986
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,198
Do you want to give her more stress?

987
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:15,608
She must be suffering every moment.

988
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:19,270
The longer her son
stays away from her..

989
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,405
"the more she will suffer.

990
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:24,278
What kind of a father are you?

991
01:32:24,406 --> 01:32:25,908
Your own daughter
is suffering and you..

992
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:29,213
Where is Ronnie?

993
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:35,083
I told you,
I didn't kidnap him.

994
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,695
Why will 
..

995
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:50,131
Kumar.

996
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,513
Munna is a
drug-lord of this area.

997
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:44,390
I owe him a lot of money.

998
01:34:46,314 --> 01:34:48,191
They are after me.

999
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:52,158
During the time-period
you're inquiring about"

1000
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:58,497
..l was in prison for drunk-driving.

1001
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:03,066
You can confirm with the police.

1002
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,068
And that black van?

1003
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:06,876
Belongs to me.

1004
01:35:08,303 --> 01:35:10,180
I used to hire it out.

1005
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:12,876
To clients who had to shift furniture,
cupboards etc" while shifting houses.

1006
01:35:13,508 --> 01:35:15,146
Like movers and packers you know..

1007
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:17,145
Mostly to them.

1008
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:41,379
There are pictures of
army personnel in your home.

1009
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:42,312
Where did that come from?

1010
01:35:43,438 --> 01:35:47,113
Someone or the other from my
family has always been in the army.

1011
01:35:48,977 --> 01:35:50,354
There are many institutions"

1012
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:54,292
..who hires ex-army
men for security services.

1013
01:35:57,285 --> 01:36:00,357
Was there anyone else
in the Land Measurement Office..

1014
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:02,902
..who was an ex-army man?

1015
01:36:09,998 --> 01:36:11,500
Anyone from this list?

1016
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:18,478
Did you get it?

1017
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:20,884
No water, no fan, nothing for him..
- Sarita, I want to speak to you.

1018
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:21,943
And..

1019
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,045
Sarita.
- Just a minute.

1020
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:24,654
You stay there.
- Yes.

1021
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:26,253
I want to talk to you.

1022
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:29,123
Sarita.
- Yes.

1023
01:36:29,351 --> 01:36:30,591
We haven't found Ronnie yet..

1024
01:36:31,186 --> 01:36:32,597
We're making a mistake.

1025
01:36:34,256 --> 01:36:35,234
What mistake?

1026
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:36,595
It's an open and shut case.

1027
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,468
After looking at the
wall in his house"

1028
01:36:38,493 --> 01:36:39,904
"there is no room for any doubt.

1029
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:42,033
He's just pretending, we'll break him.

1030
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:43,064
The yellow wall?

1031
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,966
What is so unique about it?

1032
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:47,502
You can paint any wall,
take a picture" that's it.

1033
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:51,073
See, even if we believe
that it is the same house"

1034
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:54,211
"but Manohar is claming that he
was locked up in some other place.

1035
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:56,012
The real kidnapper could
have taken the child there"

1036
01:36:56,077 --> 01:36:57,954
..and clicked his picture.

1037
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:00,483
If Manohar was locked up..

1038
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:03,485
"then, how can he
make the ransom call?

1039
01:37:04,519 --> 01:37:06,089
Only if Manohar is speaking the truth?

1040
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:07,462
What if he's telling the truth?

1041
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:12,370
See, the kidnapper called from a PCO.

1042
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:14,202
Then he wiped his own fingerprints.

1043
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:16,071
But he left behind the cigarette butt.

1044
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:17,901
So under the circumstances
he did two things.

1045
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:19,445
One, he showed his clever side"
and the other, very foolish.

1046
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,912
Isn't that strange?

1047
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:23,447
Now, we must think
from a different angle.

1048
01:37:23,638 --> 01:37:25,447
If he was wearing a pair of gloves"

1049
01:37:26,608 --> 01:37:28,645
"everything would
have changed easily.

1050
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,218
Then he would've
never wiped the phone.

1051
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,622
In that situation,
you would've found..

1052
01:37:36,885 --> 01:37:38,421
..many fingerprints on the phone..

1053
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:41,592
..and you would've wasted precious
time in finding a single match.

1054
01:37:41,957 --> 01:37:43,459
And yet you wouldn't
have found your suspect.

1055
01:37:44,893 --> 01:37:47,669
When we caught him, he was trying to..

1056
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:49,971
..throw the bag of money
on the other side of the wall.

1057
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,275
Why?

1058
01:37:53,435 --> 01:37:55,642
After taking such
a big risk to get this money"

1059
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:59,113
..why would he would throw the bag
on the other side? He would only do it if..

1060
01:37:59,174 --> 01:38:01,916
..he had a partner on the other side"
or if someone had threatened him to do it.

1061
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:07,489
Your theory about
the partner might be right.

1062
01:38:08,116 --> 01:38:13,464
But his story about locking him
up and threatening him..is bullshit.

1063
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:24,475
What are you thinking?

1064
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:30,279
He repeated his
8 years old plan again.

1065
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,718
And this time..to perfection.

1066
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,362
I need you to check a CD.
- Come on.

1067
01:41:40,895 --> 01:41:43,501
Help Grandpa!!
Save me!! Where are you?

1068
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:48,570
Help.. Save me Grandpa..
Where are you? Come and help me.

1069
01:41:48,636 --> 01:41:52,345
Save me.. Come fast Grandpa..

1070
01:41:53,341 --> 01:41:56,914
Please Grandpa!! Help me!!

1071
01:42:00,248 --> 01:42:02,421
This means Manohar
was telling the truth.

1072
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,958
Who?
- No, nothing.

1073
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,664
Was that the only voice on the CD?

1074
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:13,070
That's the main audio.
- Main Audio?

1075
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:14,362
ls there something else?

1076
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:18,236
Look..there's a soft voice here.

1077
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:24,175
Say "Help Grandpa.." Say "Help me.."

1078
01:42:24,272 --> 01:42:26,149
Grandpa help!! Help me..

1079
01:42:26,207 --> 01:42:28,551
Be loud.. Say ‘Help Grandpa.."..

1080
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:31,614
Help Grandpa..Help me!!

1081
01:42:38,019 --> 01:42:41,466
Be loud..
Say ‘Help Grandpa..".. Be loud..

1082
01:42:42,557 --> 01:42:45,163
Help Grandpa..Help me!!

1083
01:42:47,061 --> 01:42:50,099
Help Grandpa..Help me!!

1084
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:08,555
So this is that kidnapper who hasn't
let me sleep for all these years.

1085
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:47,992
I haven't done anything.

1086
01:44:48,049 --> 01:44:49,221
I haven't done anything.

1087
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,126
I am being framed.
- Go inside.

1088
01:44:51,185 --> 01:44:52,528
Believe me.

1089
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:55,022
Move.

1090
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:21,251
You're making a big mistake.

1091
01:45:21,315 --> 01:45:22,259
He didn't commit this crime.

1092
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:23,590
He was locked in the warehouse.

1093
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:25,155
I gave you that CD.

1094
01:45:25,386 --> 01:45:26,330
What do you mean?

1095
01:45:26,554 --> 01:45:28,363
Who said this to you? Manohar?

1096
01:45:28,889 --> 01:45:30,425
He wants this to happen.

1097
01:45:31,192 --> 01:45:33,672
And the other voice on the
CD could be Manohar's as well.

1098
01:45:33,928 --> 01:45:35,134
You're making a mistake.

1099
01:45:35,196 --> 01:45:37,005
He did it.
- So where's Ronnie?

1100
01:45:37,265 --> 01:45:38,608
You looked everywhere.

1101
01:45:38,866 --> 01:45:40,436
He kidnapped the child,
and was apprehended as well..

1102
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:43,038
..yet we have no clue,
this doesn't make any sense?

1103
01:45:43,304 --> 01:45:47,013
I think he's killed
the child and hid the body.

1104
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:48,949
What?

1105
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:52,888
What do you mean?

1106
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,957
If the body isn't found..

1107
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:57,222
..he knows he cannot
be charged with kidnapping.

1108
01:45:57,285 --> 01:45:58,593
And if the body's found..

1109
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:01,094
"then he'll be charged
with kidnapping and murder.

1110
01:46:01,122 --> 01:46:02,499
That's why he isn't confessing.

1111
01:46:03,024 --> 01:46:04,002
You're making a mistake.

1112
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,598
The kidnapper didn't kill Angela.

1113
01:46:08,262 --> 01:46:09,240
Her death"

1114
01:46:11,332 --> 01:46:13,209
Her death..was an accident.

1115
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:27,152
This isn't Angela's
case..nor is it yours.

1116
01:46:28,649 --> 01:46:30,993
Maybe Angela's kidnapper
was someone else.

1117
01:46:31,619 --> 01:46:32,654
Maybe I was wrong.

1118
01:46:34,355 --> 01:46:37,393
He could've gathered these
details from the police files as well.

1119
01:46:38,326 --> 01:46:41,102
Maybe he's trying to confuse us.

1120
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:43,302
Don't try to mix both the cases.

1121
01:46:43,364 --> 01:46:45,344
You are not trying to understand.

1122
01:46:46,901 --> 01:46:49,347
Both the cases are the
same..they are linked.

1123
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:55,148
Manohar isn't your kidnapper,
it's someone else.

1124
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:00,252
Take a look at the
voice analysis report"

1125
01:47:01,115 --> 01:47:03,254
..of the ransom call that
was made to Manohar's home.

1126
01:47:03,951 --> 01:47:05,157
Ronnie's ransom call.

1127
01:47:06,187 --> 01:47:07,257
It's Manohar's voice.

1128
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:09,399
It's a perfect match.

1129
01:47:18,866 --> 01:47:21,574
A voiceprint is as full proof
an evidence, as a fingerprint.

1130
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:31,650
And you know,
it's impossible to fake one's voice.

1131
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:40,396
It's absolutely clear,
Manohar is the kidnapper.

1132
01:47:48,896 --> 01:47:50,375
"Why did you call the police?"

1133
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:52,304
"l have your grandchild."

1134
01:47:52,366 --> 01:47:54,209
"So stop wasting my time."

1135
01:47:54,235 --> 01:47:55,578
"And arrange for two
million by tomorrow morning.."

1136
01:47:55,603 --> 01:47:57,014
"..if you want to see him alive."

1137
01:47:57,071 --> 01:47:58,345
"l will call again."

1138
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,484
"Why did you call the police?"

1139
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:05,921
"l have your grandchild."

1140
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,550
"So stop wasting my time."

1141
01:48:07,615 --> 01:48:09,060
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1142
01:48:09,116 --> 01:48:10,561
"..if you want to see him alive."

1143
01:48:10,618 --> 01:48:11,926
"l will call again."

1144
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:15,065
"Why did you call the police?"

1145
01:48:15,122 --> 01:48:16,931
"l have your grandchild."

1146
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:18,561
"So stop wasting my time."

1147
01:48:18,626 --> 01:48:20,037
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1148
01:48:20,094 --> 01:48:21,266
"..if you want to see him alive."

1149
01:48:21,662 --> 01:48:23,369
"l will call again."

1150
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:33,575
"Why did you call the police?"

1151
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:35,646
"l have your grandchild."

1152
01:48:35,709 --> 01:48:37,484
"So stop wasting my time."

1153
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:38,956
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1154
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,185
"..if you want to see him alive."

1155
01:48:40,414 --> 01:48:41,893
"l will call again."

1156
01:48:47,455 --> 01:48:51,926
Angelina..8 year..

1157
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,598
Angel i na..

1158
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:57,406
Angela..A N G E L A.

1159
01:49:01,235 --> 01:49:02,145
Found it!

1160
01:49:08,142 --> 01:49:11,089
It will take time to digitize
the old tape and listen to it.

1161
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:15,115
But what do you want to prove, Martin?

1162
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:17,361
This CD has the current ransom call.

1163
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:21,223
Match the voice and see"
does it match with my case?

1164
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:23,962
"Why did you call the police?"

1165
01:49:24,091 --> 01:49:25,331
"l have your grandchild."

1166
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:27,168
Why is the voice so muffled?

1167
01:49:28,029 --> 01:49:29,337
Must be the recording.

1168
01:49:29,997 --> 01:49:30,600
No, no..

1169
01:49:35,369 --> 01:49:35,972
Hear this.

1170
01:49:36,037 --> 01:49:37,573
"Why did you call the police?"

1171
01:49:37,638 --> 01:49:39,345
"l have your grandchild."

1172
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,147
"So stop wasting my time."

1173
01:49:41,175 --> 01:49:43,121
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1174
01:49:43,177 --> 01:49:44,383
"..if you want to see him alive."

1175
01:49:44,445 --> 01:49:46,152
The cycle bell is so clear.

1176
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:49,425
How can the voice be so muff
ed..

1177
01:49:50,885 --> 01:49:52,922
..if the mouth-piece
is so close to him?

1178
01:49:53,353 --> 01:49:54,991
Let me just enhance the audio clip..

1179
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:56,466
"Hello, I am his mother speaking?"

1180
01:49:56,524 --> 01:49:58,333
Her voice sounds normal.

1181
01:49:58,392 --> 01:50:02,363
But why isn't both
the voices seem to balance?

1182
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,102
"Hello? Hello?"

1183
01:50:04,165 --> 01:50:05,166
Let's check.

1184
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:08,376
Even if the kidnapper used a filter"

1185
01:50:09,036 --> 01:50:11,380
..his voice quality can't be so bad.

1186
01:50:12,673 --> 01:50:14,380
"Why did you call the police?"

1187
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:17,183
"l have your grandchild."

1188
01:50:26,554 --> 01:50:27,532
Manin.

1189
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,662
Martin!

1190
01:50:31,592 --> 01:50:34,300
I have matched the
old and the new calls.

1191
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:35,305
Find anything?

1192
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:36,500
It's the same call.

1193
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:39,300
What?

1194
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:41,311
Look..

1195
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:43,905
This is the current
kidnapper's waveform.

1196
01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:47,177
And this is the
kidnapper from your case.

1197
01:50:47,241 --> 01:50:48,618
"Why did you call the police?"

1198
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:50,479
I'll play them simultaneously.

1199
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:54,459
"l have your grandchild."

1200
01:50:54,515 --> 01:50:56,324
So it's the same kidnapper
in both cases.

1201
01:50:56,384 --> 01:50:58,386
That I don't know whether
the kidnapper's same or not"

1202
01:50:59,286 --> 01:51:00,959
..but the ransom call is
definitely the same.

1203
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:02,329
Exact same.

1204
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:10,935
How can a man speak in the
same way..choosing the same words"

1205
01:51:11,365 --> 01:51:17,213
"pause in the
same places, even after 8 years?

1206
01:51:20,507 --> 01:51:21,645
That's not possible.

1207
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:28,055
"Hello."

1208
01:51:28,482 --> 01:51:30,519
What's that sound?

1209
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,357
"Why did you call the police?"

1210
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:33,363
I guess it's a switch.

1211
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,161
"Why did you call the police?"

1212
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:41,139
Someone's playing the same
ransom call over the phone.

1213
01:51:42,062 --> 01:51:46,169
Maybe it's the switch
of an old Walkman.

1214
01:51:48,002 --> 01:51:49,572
"l have your grandchild."

1215
01:51:49,637 --> 01:51:51,310
"So stop wasting my time."

1216
01:51:51,372 --> 01:51:53,079
"And arrange for two million
by tomorrow morning.."

1217
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:54,414
"..if you want to see him alive."

1218
01:51:56,076 --> 01:51:58,078
There is a difference
in quality in both the calls.

1219
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,953
ls it because the tape is too old?

1220
01:52:02,149 --> 01:52:06,495
No, no, quality of tapes
do not deteriorate due to storage"

1221
01:52:06,921 --> 01:52:08,491
..but it might if you keep
playing them time and again.

1222
01:52:08,989 --> 01:52:13,529
Someone is constantly telling
the child to say grandpa.

1223
01:52:13,594 --> 01:52:18,043
See if the voice matches
with anyone on the system.

1224
01:53:20,561 --> 01:53:21,505
There's a match.

1225
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:23,105
With what?

1226
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,541
No one on the system.

1227
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:28,337
But with the voice on the old tape.

1228
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:33,677
The kidnapper?

1229
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:34,510
No.

1230
01:53:35,075 --> 01:53:37,885
The person who's asking
the kid to say grandpa.

1231
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:40,390
It's the same guy who..

1232
01:53:40,448 --> 01:53:44,089
..received the ransom call
in the earlier kidnapping case.

1233
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:49,190
Grandpa.

1234
01:53:51,959 --> 01:53:53,495
Grandpa help.

1235
01:53:54,361 --> 01:53:57,274
Grandpa helP!

1236
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:58,867
Loudly.

1237
01:53:59,266 --> 01:54:03,112
‘He keeps hearing the
same old tape every night.‘

1238
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:05,579
"Grandpa..! Grandpa.. !"

1239
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:07,414
"l am sorry, grandpa."

1240
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:09,386
"l made a mistake."

1241
01:54:09,443 --> 01:54:12,583
"l will tell you."

1242
01:54:16,150 --> 01:54:17,288
This is a list of them.

1243
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:24,093
Have you ever heard anything
about them, or any records?

1244
01:54:24,558 --> 01:54:25,969
Father"

1245
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,636
My daughter's made this card for you.

1246
01:54:29,629 --> 01:54:31,199
You made this?

1247
01:54:31,565 --> 01:54:33,169
It's really beautiful.

1248
01:54:33,467 --> 01:54:35,606
I'll always keep it with me.

1249
01:55:41,435 --> 01:55:42,914
Manohar Sinha.

1250
01:56:19,606 --> 01:56:21,415
Hey welcome.
- Hello, papa.

1251
01:56:22,643 --> 01:56:24,145
Hello, Neeta. How are you?
- Hi, grandpa.

1252
01:56:24,378 --> 01:56:26,016
I love you, grandpa.

1253
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,616
How are you, Ronnie?
- I'm fine.

1254
01:56:28,582 --> 01:56:29,652
Good to see you.

1255
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:32,330
Okay, let's play football
- Ready Mom.

1256
01:56:32,386 --> 01:56:34,093
Ronnie, head butt.

1257
01:56:36,890 --> 01:56:38,301
Good one.

1258
01:56:39,393 --> 01:56:41,430
You have become a pro.

1259
01:56:56,910 --> 01:56:57,513
Hello.

1260
01:57:02,049 --> 01:57:02,527
Did you find anything?

1261
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:03,856
We have found the location.

1262
01:57:03,917 --> 01:57:05,123
The phone is not moving.

1263
01:57:16,263 --> 01:57:20,302
Come 0n pass" come 0n, pass me.

1264
01:57:21,468 --> 01:57:24,142
Come 0n pass" come 0n, pass me.

1265
01:57:24,204 --> 01:57:25,615
Kick the ball.

1266
01:57:28,108 --> 01:57:30,987
Come 0n pass" come 0n, pass me.

1267
01:57:31,879 --> 01:57:35,053
Yes" yes" goal!

1268
01:57:36,383 --> 01:57:38,260
Good to see you, Father Manin.

1269
01:57:39,453 --> 01:57:41,490
I knew you would find me.

1270
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:48,300
Ronnie dear..
- Yes.

1271
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:50,673
Go get ready, son.

1272
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:53,336
This uncle will take you home.

1273
01:57:53,634 --> 01:57:55,580
No, I don't want to go home.

1274
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:58,172
I want to stay here
and play football with you.

1275
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:14,292
So you knew that
Manohar had kidnapped Angela.

1276
01:58:15,222 --> 01:58:17,998
And you've been planning
this ever since, right?

1277
01:58:22,162 --> 01:58:25,609
I found the kidnapper, not you.

1278
01:58:27,334 --> 01:58:29,439
<i>That day,
after we visited the Imambara.</i>

1279
01:58:29,503 --> 01:58:31,141
..you deserted me.

1280
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:35,178
But I couldn't desert Angela.

1281
01:58:36,943 --> 01:58:39,082
So I continued my search.

1282
01:59:36,403 --> 01:59:39,009
The day I found him I
could have killed him but"

1283
01:59:39,072 --> 01:59:40,983
"that wouldn't have been justice.

1284
01:59:42,309 --> 01:59:47,054
I would've had my revenge,
but not justice.

1285
01:59:51,518 --> 01:59:54,988
And so I intentionally
started this story.

1286
01:59:56,923 --> 02:00:01,303
Because I always knew that
the police will come to you.

1287
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:09,108
I took special care to make the
kidnapping seem like the earlier one.

1288
02:00:50,343 --> 02:00:52,254
"Why did you call the police?"

1289
02:00:52,312 --> 02:00:54,417
"Your grandchild is in my custody."

1290
02:00:54,481 --> 02:00:59,089
"lf you want him back alive then arrange
for two million by tomorrow morning."

1291
02:01:04,057 --> 02:01:05,058
What do you want?

1292
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:08,038
What are you going to do?

1293
02:01:14,668 --> 02:01:17,410
I want a meeting with Manohar.

1294
02:01:18,438 --> 02:01:21,078
No, I can't do that.

1295
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,148
It's not my call.

1296
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:27,113
Martin"

1297
02:01:29,449 --> 02:01:32,623
No one else can arrange
this meeting other than you..

1298
02:01:34,153 --> 02:01:35,223
Do it..

1299
02:01:36,556 --> 02:01:39,366
..and take Ronnie home.

1300
02:01:40,861 --> 02:01:44,968
John uncle come on,
we'll play football together.

1301
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:14,464
Manohar.

1302
02:02:23,036 --> 02:02:27,644
Except for you,
only one other man knew..

1303
02:02:29,409 --> 02:02:34,518
"that 8 years ago
you kidnapped my Angela.

1304
02:02:36,316 --> 02:02:37,488
And that is me.

1305
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:01,472
So you fled with the money.

1306
02:05:04,464 --> 02:05:08,537
But you weren't sure
whether she's dead or not.

1307
02:05:10,103 --> 02:05:13,084
That's why you erased
all the evidence.

1308
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:18,088
You just removed.. all evidence.

1309
02:05:33,193 --> 02:05:37,005
It was clever of you
to borrow Kumar's black van.

1310
02:05:37,497 --> 02:05:39,204
The van couldn't have
led anyone directly to you..

1311
02:05:39,266 --> 02:05:42,247
"because many
people would hire it.

1312
02:05:43,303 --> 02:05:44,043
But..

1313
02:05:46,105 --> 02:05:47,140
..one day"

1314
02:05:49,843 --> 02:05:51,413
..you ran out of luck

1315
02:05:55,048 --> 02:05:56,356
Your trunk was found.

1316
02:05:57,984 --> 02:05:59,054
Then the pen.

1317
02:06:02,088 --> 02:06:03,863
The.. pen!

1318
02:06:12,966 --> 02:06:14,240
This pen..

1319
02:06:19,138 --> 02:06:22,915
This pen led me to you.

1320
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:26,247
I didn't want to kill her.

1321
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:30,493
I only wanted to
save my daughter Neeta.

1322
02:06:31,318 --> 02:06:33,423
She needed immediate surgery,
and I didn't have the money..

1323
02:06:33,486 --> 02:06:34,965
..and so I did it.

1324
02:06:35,589 --> 02:06:37,865
Back then I was in
a despeane condition.

1325
02:06:38,024 --> 02:06:41,335
..l couldn't decide what's right
or wrong.. Didn't know what to do?

1326
02:06:44,064 --> 02:06:45,338
And even after 8 years"

1327
02:06:45,398 --> 02:06:48,538
..you didn't know what to do?

1328
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:52,839
The police thinks
you have killed Ronnie.

1329
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:59,046
They are never going
to look for him anymore.

1330
02:07:00,613 --> 02:07:05,926
But you want him to return safely,
don't you?

1331
02:07:09,289 --> 02:07:10,165
Fine.

1332
02:07:12,292 --> 02:07:14,533
I admit I wronged you.

1333
02:07:15,862 --> 02:07:20,072
So tell me.. how can
I rectify my mistake?

1334
02:07:22,435 --> 02:07:24,073
What must I do?

1335
02:07:37,417 --> 02:07:38,987
Manoher has confessed.

1336
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:47,394
Sarita. Manoher has confessed
to both the kidnappings"

1337
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:49,940
..and he also gave
us Ronnie's location.

1338
02:07:53,633 --> 02:07:58,633
The stanneither
relented nor feared“

1339
02:08:06,612 --> 02:08:11,612
<i>A ray of light kept
him alive..kept him alive“</i>

1340
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:25,526
<i>Clinging to the few strands of life,
he kept saying“</i>

1341
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:39,987
<i>I have the right to burn..</i>

1342
02:08:40,513 --> 02:08:45,986

02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:06,943

<i>I PFOmise!</i>

1347
02:09:36,636 --> 02:09:39,344
<i>Drops of my bIood..</i>

1348
02:09:41,907 --> 02:09:48,051
<i>"are still warm.</i>

1349
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:55,449
<i>I have an unﬁnished duty.</i>

1350
02:10:03,262 --> 02:10:08,262
<i>I've been counting each passing day,
year after year.</i>

1351
02:10:14,107 --> 02:10:16,644
I've been counting them..

1352
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:22,110
<i>I've been clinging
to twigs of courage"</i>

1353
02:10:27,687 --> 02:10:30,361
<i>"and kept saying“</i>

1354
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:36,397

I'll die"</i>

1361
