1
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,380
Where do you want to go sir?

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,710
RR College Street

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,300
Get in

4
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:25,960
Miss Geetha

5
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,380
I thought time 
is a treacherous one

6
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,340
But it is wrong

7
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,800
Time turns 420 twice a day

8
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,340
But love! 
All time 420

9
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,840
When a girl say yes 
it will end in marriage

10
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,090
If she says no 
it will end in alcoholism

11
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,460
May be that is the reason for 
naming bars after girls name

12
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,380
Lavanya bar and restaurant

13
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,460
Sujatha wines

14
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,710
Lakshkmi wine stores

15
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,920
It is not that guys are bad

16
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,130
The problem is they become bad 
After falling in love

17
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,250
Parents should feel proud 
seeing our love interest

18
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,750
And friends should feel jealous

19
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,590
We do have such kind of small dreams

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,380
You must keep calling 
every now and then and talk

21
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,960
Can't lead life spending 
whole day in WhatsApp

22
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,300
Though you have broken relationships

23
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,050
You want to show off 
’committed' in status

24
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,000
That fancying is called love

25
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,670
You break up when you feel agitated

26
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,460
Do you have any idea how hard it is 
For us to leave our parents house?

27
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,420
We not only wish for 
a good relationship status

28
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,590
But for your good status too

29
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,800
Many billionaires.. 
After getting married

30
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,090
have become millionaires

31
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,710
Perfect! Ask her dude 
I've spent lakhs on her

32
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,590
I have also done many things for him

33
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,550
Not just him 
I've spent money too

34
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,840
What a lier!

35
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,960
I've all the bills of 
the expenses done on her

36
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,920
With GST

37
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,250
I preserved it as sweet memories

38
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,210
You have bills?!

39
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,000
I didn't know you are such a cheap man

40
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,710
We are sound when we spend 
And cheap when we show bills?!

41
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,340
Don't ever show me your face

42
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,170
Well inspite of face, show something else

43
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,380
You don't need such a guy 
Come lets go

44
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,920
See, she just went away

45
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,340
Let her go to hell!

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,590
For men bars are the refuge

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,420
Listen

48
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,210
Friends teach us to drink

49
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
But girls make us drunkards

50
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,750
Don't get tensed

51
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,800
Life is a confusion

52
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,800
The only solution is..

53
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,710
Enjoy the party

54
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,880
Life itself is a bonus

55
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,800
Time pass with it

56
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,670
Upload your status everyday

57
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,590
During night out 
The party starts

58
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,840
We go high! It’s our routine

59
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,670
During night out 
The party starts

60
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,960
We go high! It’s our routine

61
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,130
When a guys fails in love

62
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,840
When a guys fails in love 
Monday will also become a holiday

63
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,920
When a girl fails in love

64
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,630
She gets married very next day

65
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,800
Tongue which tastes alcohol\ slips in the night

66
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,800
We go to bar when single

67
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,800
and to pub when we are engaged

68
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,920
Be drunk, get others drunk 
and be generous

69
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,590
During night out 
The party starts

70
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,840
We go high! It’s our routine

71
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,590
During night out 
The party starts

72
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,840
We go high! It’s our routine

73
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,050
During night out 
The party starts

74
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,300
We go high! It’s our routine

75
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,590
During night out 
The party starts

76
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,840
We go high! It’s our routine

77
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,050
Akash

78
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,710
Come lets wish Prem

79
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Mom, if I come there

80
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,590
I’ll tell them not to get married 
Is it okay for you?

81
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,800
Forget it

82
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,670
Give way

83
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,880
Sir drink?

84
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,960
Sorry

85
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,130
I couldn’t notice

86
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,800
You will be in stress 
while getting engaged

87
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,750
Drink slowly

88
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,300
It is not my engagement

89
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,710
Can’t figure out who is getting engaged 
And who are her friends

90
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,130
Every one comes tiptop 
So I got confused

91
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,460
Its okay

92
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,420
Why are you boozing in stress?

93
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,710
Should not girls drink?

94
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,380
Who is stopping you?

95
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,880
A large on the rocks

96
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,670
Ice or water?

97
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,960
You are a good orator

98
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,460
Are you Prem’s friend?

99
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,420
No

100
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,340
Geetha’s friend

101
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,380
Oh this one?

102
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,550
Prem Geetha are getting engaged 
after falling in love

103
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,250
They are in love since college days

104
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,960
Geetha is very soft and sensitive

105
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,090
Prem knows well of her 
likes and dislikes

106
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,550
Prem supports Geetha’s ambitions

107
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,130
They are my favourite 
among the couples I’ve seen

108
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,090
and the cute

109
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,300
You call couples cute and puppy too

110
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,250
Serve me a large

111
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,210
Come lets go wish them

112
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,170
Hi congratulations 
Thank you

113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,750
Looking very pretty 
Thank you

114
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,590
Congrats Prem 
Congratulations

115
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,960
Many girls etch memories in our lives

116
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,500
But you are the perfect girl 
according to me

117
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,500
May this love and smile be 
with you for the rest of your life

118
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,670
Congratulations 
Congratulations Pem

119
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,000
Hey security!

120
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,550
Sir

121
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,670
Look how it is parked

122
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,670
Take it!

123
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,750
ark my car 
Okay sir

124
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,670
Hi everybody!

125
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,670
I am Akash, your trainer

126
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,380
Sorry for being late

127
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,460
Someone has parked her car weirdly

128
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,250
I noticed make up kit in the car

129
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,750
I realised it is some girl’s car

130
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,340
You can’t make some men quit habits

131
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,300
and can’t teach 
few women how to drive

132
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,460
Let’s proceed

133
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,130
I am the terrorist 
who parked the car weirdly

134
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,460
I am sorry

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For the first time in my life

136
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,170
A girl has confessed her mistake

137
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
and asked for forgiveness

138
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,090
It is very common to err in this age

139
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,710
Pay this bill as 
a punishment for that mistake

140
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,500
What is this?

141
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,880
An offer letter mom 
From Kolkatta

142
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,380
As a new project manager

143
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,840
You didn’t tell me before 
about shifting to Kolkatta

144
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,880
As though you update me everything

145
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,090
I do update you

146
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,550
But

147
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,130
You won’t be having 
enough time to listen

148
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,920
You are always occupied in your work

149
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,880
Since your dad and I got separated

150
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,800
I share everything with you

151
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,800
I have only you in my life

152
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,090
I don’t expect you to 
share everything with me

153
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,630
At least you could have 
informed me about going away

154
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
I’ve not made the confirmation yet

155
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,250
I’ll not go away from you

156
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,250
Having a cup of filter coffee prepared by mom 
during rain will be awesome

157
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,170
Isn’t it so!? And a cigaret

158
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,550
In that case let me know 
I’ll come for sure

159
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,550
Done

160
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,630
I am practicing for last eight years

161
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,710
Muay Thai is the stress buster 
for my stress and frustration

162
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,460
Let me know if I can do anything for you

163
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,000
I’ll be happy to do it

164
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,880
Hello not necessary

165
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,750
Not all girls are dependant on men

166
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,750
I am not even depending on my parents

167
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,210
Actually this job is not my priority

168
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,250
This job s for my daily expenses

169
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,090
My actual plan is to do Masters in US

170
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,630
I’ve applied for it this year 
Once I get it, I’ll….

171
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,090
What is love according to you Akash?!

172
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
Love means..

173
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,340
Going mad by falling behind a school girl

174
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,750
Falling in love with a widow

175
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,500
and then get stuck on a raft

176
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,170
Attending ex girl’s engagement

177
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,300
and click her photo

178
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,590
Falling in love with an engaged girl

179
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,210
Petting a rabbit and getting soaked in rain

180
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,550
Give a piece of advice standing over a water falls

181
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,920
Are these your personal experience?

182
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,500
It is a track record

183
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,880
Akash you know 
that I am in love with Shweta

184
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,420
But her parents are not agreeing

185
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,420
They are threatening me 
that they will give a police complaint

186
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,550
Help me out dude

187
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,920
What is assurance that 
you both will lead life together?

188
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,380
Love is an agreement between 
a girl and a boy across the world

189
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,840
But in our country

190
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,550
boy’s family should accept the girl

191
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,380
and girl’s family should accept the boy

192
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,920
If love successfully 
survives in this struggle

193
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,420
They will tie the knots

194
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,550
Or

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,920
They will tie the knots

196
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,550
But with some other person

197
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,630
You convince her

198
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,920
Not just to the police station

199
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,840
I’ll come to the railway station

200
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,750
and send you both on honeymoon

201
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,210
I am allergic to love and lovers

202
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,170
Hello

203
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,670
Come to Vijay Nagar police station

204
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,050
My dad is proud as if 
he has developed the nation

205
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,840
He is your dad?

206
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,630
Girl’s father has filed a kidnap complaint

207
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,460
Both boy and the girl are major

208
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,590
How could you call this a kidnap case?!

209
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,500
Sign it here

210
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,420
If couple are in agreement

211
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,460
They can convince their parents

212
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,250
Or make them get convinced

213
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,670
If the couple don’t have the clarity

214
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,880
Even if parents make the marriage happen

215
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,170
That marriage won’t lost long

216
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,340
I am the witness to this marriage

217
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,300
Thank you very much uncle

218
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,880
He has no clarity in his 
own relationship

219
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,630
He is assuring 
some other's relationship

220
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,050
He gives free advice to everyone

221
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,750
But he doesn't follow a single one

222
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,420
Drink

223
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,130
Akash where are you?

224
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,050
I am calling since morning

225
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,710
Don't you have sense to call back 
after seeing missed calls?

226
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,250
You are behaving like your dad

227
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,210
Obviously! My son behaves like me

228
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,500
He is with you!

229
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,170
Please try to be away from him

230
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,920
On top of it you make him drink

231
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,300
He is becoming you day by day

232
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,380
He is my son too

233
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,500
What's wrong if my son 
comes to his own home?

234
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,840
I am trying to get away from you

235
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,300
But you are still bothering me 
One way or the other

236
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,090
Arathi I've the same amount of affection 
What you have towards him

237
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,460
Affection is not just giving birth

238
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,210
It is in parenting

239
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,050
Quarrelling is a part of family

240
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,590
My parents fight too

241
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,920
Then mom or dad try to calm each other

242
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,460
They become one again

243
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,670
But my parents are not together 
to calm each other

244
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,500
Dad in his own house

245
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,550
Mom is in her own home

246
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,300
Since my childhood

247
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,550
I am living like an orphan 
though I have parents

248
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,920
Due to their quarrelling 
I got enrolled in a hostel

249
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,750
Every children over there

250
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,880
Were curios to know 
when their parents will come

251
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,210
But I...

252
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,170
But I was wondering who will come 
to see me! Mom or dad?

253
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,380
I don't remember celebrating birthday

254
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,420
Cutting cakes and everything

255
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,500
Even if a family doesn't live together

256
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,250
They will be having a family photo

257
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,300
But I don't have my family with me

258
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,960
And don't have a family photo

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,460
Mom thinks she is right 
Dad thinks he is right

260
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,710
The reason for quarrelling and separation...

261
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,090
is still unknown to me

262
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,630
But I've reckoned one thing

263
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:20,880
No matter how hard I try

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,250
They can't be reunited

265
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,710
Time will heal everything

266
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,500
One fine day your parents will 
Reunite for your sake

267
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,550
Chill

268
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,630
Akash

269
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,800
I have a surprise for you tomorrow

270
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,000
A surprise?

271
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,340
What is it?

272
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,500
Tomorrow

273
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,460
Hey 
Hi!

274
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,630
Hey happy birthday 
Thank you!

275
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,590
Time for the surprise

276
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,960
What's that? 
Come with me

277
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,920
Come

278
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,630
You call this a surprise?!

279
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,000
This is not the surprise

280
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:10,500
Then?

281
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,590
Wait

282
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,090
Mom, she said 
there is one surprise for me

283
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,710
Priya invited me too

284
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,130
Thanks aunty

285
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,550
Priya you did a mistake

286
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,090
Hi uncle

287
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,000
Hello 
Take a seat

288
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,050
Akash, which one is 
your best birth day till now?

289
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,250
I am asking you

290
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,050
That is...

291
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,670
His seventh year's birthday

292
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,210
It was Diwali that day

293
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,090
I prepared a cake myself 
And had a great celebration

294
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,590
No

295
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,920
When he turned 18 
and became a major

296
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,300
I threw a huge party

297
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,250
Akash!

298
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,170
That was the day you had drinks 
for the first time, right?

299
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,500
Is it necessary now?

300
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,800
Never took the responsibility 
of your son

301
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,130
You spoiled him by teaching all this

302
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,170
I never spoiled him in any way

303
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,050
I'm just treating him like a friend

304
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,840
He got spoiled due to your friendship

305
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,340
Otherwise he would have excelled

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,550
When a dad forgets his duties

307
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,460
Mother has to fulfil them

308
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,300
I didn't threw you out of the house

309
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,800
Nor I abandoned my son

310
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,880
I have my own

311
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:30,880
I don't want to talk

312
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,670
It is not that you don't want to

313
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,460
But there is nothing left to talk

314
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,210
You remember his birth date

315
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,090
But you don't remember to give 
a meaning to that birth

316
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,550
Mom enough, stop it

317
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,670
Why should I?

318
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,800
It is him who should stop

319
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,300
Don't talk rubbish

320
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,710
Today is his birthday

321
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,380
Let him be happy. Keep quite

322
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I realised when you came in

323
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,050
That his happiness will be ruined

324
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,630
Enough

325
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,210
You do this all the time

326
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,130
You both are not aware of my existence 
Between your anger and quarrel

327
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,630
It is me who lost in your fight

328
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,710
Priya you asked me

329
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,170
which is my favourite birthday

330
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:07,920
Did you see!?

331
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:08,800
This one

332
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,250
This is my best birthday

333
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,130
Akash!

334
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,710
Akash! I am really sorry

335
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,840
I didn't expect this could happen

336
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,340
Wow! Look at her ass man!

337
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,500
What did you say?

338
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,090
My son hit them for eve-teasing

339
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,500
No need of filing a case

340
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,880
Give him a piece of advice 
and release him

341
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,460
Fine Sir

342
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:47,840
Priya, I'm fine

343
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,880
Don't get panic and 
don't make me panic too

344
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,590
I'll see you tomorrow

345
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,420
Okay

346
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,380
She get's tensed for small things

347
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,920
This what caring is

348
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,380
We can't withstand 
when our beloved one is hurt

349
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,050
By the way, you don't 
give a damn about anyone

350
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,130
How come you are worried about Priya?

351
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,880
How come you are showing 
so much concern about her?

352
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,130
I would have done the same thing even if 
there was some other girl in Priya's place

353
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,130
Your long time buddy Goutam

354
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,000
Pleaded you to help him 
in his love matter

355
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,460
You didn't even give a damn

356
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,300
But in Priya's matter

357
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,800
You went ahead to pick a fight

358
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,250
It means you are fancying her

359
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,170
Nothing like that

360
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,050
She is just my good friend

361
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,130
Love is the most 
sacred friendship in the world

362
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,170
Before love begets on them

363
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,750
A girl and a boy will be good friends

364
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,670
Probably Priya is also in love with you

365
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,840
A guy and a girl can't hang out 
freely in this society

366
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,750
You all think they are lovers

367
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,250
You rushed to unite 
Goutam and his lover

368
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,920
You got love marriage right?

369
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:57,840
Why you are not living together?

370
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,920
It is true that we loved each other 
and got married

371
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,170
And it is also true that it is love 
which made us separate

372
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,300
If you had loved 
then why you both are separate?

373
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,340
Mom feels sad if asked

374
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,170
And you divert the topic

375
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,710
You never told me why 
you both got separated

376
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Don't talk rubbish to hide your faults

377
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,710
As though you are a perfect man

378
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,750
In Shankar's life

379
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
There is one whole different chapter 
Which you are not aware of

380
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,420
Come with me

381
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,170
You have seen Shankar only as father

382
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,590
This man

383
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,050
Had an altogether different personality

384
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,750
In 1981

385
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,920
There was a huge movement 
to save Kannada in Karnataka

386
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,050
Gokak agitation

387
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Most of the people 
don't even remember it

388
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,130
And doesn't know the importance of it

389
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,000
It was not just any other movement

390
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,960
It was a huge movement 
to save Kannada

391
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,210
The luminary of that movement was

392
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,590
Shankar

393
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Mysore was known for the movement

394
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,550
And one name for 
the movement in Mysore was

395
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,960
Shankar

396
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,710
In every moment there 
will be for and against

397
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,840
Few were for the Gokak report

398
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,960
And few were expressing opposition

399
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,920
(Speaking in Hndi) Kaanadigas 
expect us to learn Kannada

400
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,960
Write and speak in Kannada

401
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,460
If that happens what will be 
our children's future

402
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,750
Why should they have to learn Kannada?

403
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,000
Shut up

404
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,550
If you don't want Kannada 
Get the hell out of Karnataka

405
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,800
Otherwise

406
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,050
(Speaking in Tamil) I’ll not go any where

407
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,210
I have a home here and 
I'll continue to live here

408
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,800
If you have any issues 
then you get out from here

409
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,420
What the heck!? 
You have become troublesome

410
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,920
You mess with water distribution

411
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,630
And obsessed with your language

412
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,710
Listen carefully

413
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,050
If you dare to interfere with us then..

414
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,380
Mom..

415
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,340
That is our language

416
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,380
Kannada is our language 
Kannada is our mother

417
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,590
Mother gives birth

418
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,300
But the one who gives us life is

419
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,050
Mother Kannada

420
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,050
You wan't Kaveri water to drink 
which originates in Karnataka

421
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,750
But you don't want Kannada language!

422
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,880
If you use swear words in our own land

423
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Do you think we will spare you?

424
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,960
Every person who holds a rifle 
in the border is a soldier

425
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:48,300
Every man who has 
love for Kannada is a Soldier

426
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,600
He has thrashed Parvasher

427
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,520
As if he is the only one 
who is patriotic about Kannada

428
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,350
Yes I do! That’s why I hit him

429
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,020
Instead of filing defamation lawsuit

430
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,480
It would be better to face police

431
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,600
If it goes on like this

432
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,350
After twenty years

433
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,650
We will have to search Kannadigas 
Among other language people

434
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,520
Why should our children 
learn Hindi, Tami Malayalam?

435
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,980
There will be many successors of mine

436
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,270
Someone else will raise voice 
for Kannada when I am gone

437
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,900
We have law to handle such things

438
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,020
The government is forming a committee

439
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,060
Dear lawyer, you follow your way

440
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,730
I will continue the agitation 
of my self respect

441
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,480
Aarti

442
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,730
Aarti

443
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,560
Aarti

444
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,730
You are always slow

445
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,190
Okay?

446
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,150
Shankar! It doesn’t go with this dress

447
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,310
There are no bolts to 
our college boys toilet door

448
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,100
Don’t know what to hold!? 
The door or ours?

449
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,850
Is there no one to listen to 
our problems in this college?

450
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,400
Yes there is!

451
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,150
He creates revolution wherever he goes

452
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,440
It is Kwatle Ramesh who fights for us 
whenever we get into any trouble

453
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,730
Venkatesh! Ramesh’s cloths

454
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,480
What happened to Ramesh’s cloths?

455
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,020
Have a look at him

456
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,310
Ramesh! What is this new avatar?!

457
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,480
This is not an avatar! This is protest

458
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,400
Protest against gender discrimination

459
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,020
Which one?

460
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,810
Gender discrimination

461
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,600
Tomorrow we are protesting draped in sarees

462
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,100
Look at him!

463
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,190
What’s wrong with you?

464
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Look Shankar!

465
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,980
English men left behind 
‘Sorry’ and ‘Thank you’

466
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,480
along with short dresses

467
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,310
Our girls wear this shorts and show off

468
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,190
I really don’t know what made 
these girls flaunt their knees

469
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,230
Look at this Aarti!

470
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,060
She is dressed like 
my dad flaunts his legs in wrapper

471
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,850
So I am dressed like them 
to protect their honour

472
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,440
You are not protecting their honour

473
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,020
On the contrary you are spoiling 
your own honour

474
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,400
What?

475
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,190
The world is not changed by 
women’s cloths but by women

476
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:45,850
Say it again

477
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:48,600
Hey stop

478
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,480
Where are you going?

479
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,230
Will you recite a Kannada poem or

480
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,690
a kiss to my cheek?

481
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,270
Prakash!

482
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,600
You are making a mistake

483
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,520
You are making a mistake

484
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,810
You all diapers now

485
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,650
What’s wrong!

486
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,100
I am trying to teach them Kannada

487
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,980
You smashed those who 
rejected Kannada

488
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,350
If you hit it will be called as protest

489
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,270
And If I hit it will be hassle?

490
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,310
Prakash!

491
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,560
Protecting Kannada is important

492
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,690
And stopping people who create trouble 
in the name of Kannada is also important

493
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
They are our guests

494
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,150
We must take good care of them

495
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,020
We must welcome them with love

496
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,150
We must not insult our guests

497
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,520
Sorry! It won’t repeat again

498
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,940
Go on! Go to your classes

499
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,730
Shankar!

500
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,900
Geetanjali

501
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,190
Ramesh!

502
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,730
‘Ek Duuje Ke Liye’ is released

503
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,560
Let’s go watch it

504
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,600
kamal hassan’s charm and his style! 
He is a dream boy for every girl

505
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,100
There is only one dream boy 
That is Dr. Rajkumar of Kannada

506
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Hey listen! I’ll not watch movies 
from other languages

507
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,190
You must watch the duet song of Dr Rajkumar and 
Manjula in ’Nee nanna gellalaare’

508
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,100
In red suit, he sings 
the song to cute Manjula

509
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:50,190
That’s the origin of charming style

510
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,900
Kamal Hassan himself stated 
Dr Rajkumar is his inspiration

511
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,230
That’s true but 
I want to see this movie

512
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,020
Shankar, tell him

513
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
What the heck!

514
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,310
Annavru is forever

515
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,940
Shankar

516
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,770
(Speaking in Hindi) 
I got frightened yesterday

517
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,600
I mistook you

518
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,650
That’s why I didn’t speak to you

519
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,020
Yesterday you saved us

520
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,900
Thank you very much

521
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,690
The help you did yesterday

522
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,270
Help!

523
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,900
For the help you did 
She’s is thanking…

524
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,810
I mean she is thanking you

525
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,730
It’s okay

526
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,560
You will be in Shankar’s heart forever

527
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,690
You will learn about 
Kannadigas hospitality love and care

528
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,230
Your complete responsibly 
is mine from now on

529
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,440
Got it Aarti!

530
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,850
They will never learn

531
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,730
Whoever display boards 
in Hindi and English

532
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,150
We must imprint Kannada 
on their foreheads

533
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,900
You just say yes

534
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,560
I’ll bring tattooists tomorrow

535
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,150
and tattoo ‘Kannada’ on their foreheads

536
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,190
(Speaking in Hindi) 
They are troubling us everyday

537
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,020
I’ve changed the board four times

538
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,900
They have painted black again

539
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,650
Ramaiah

540
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,900
Change this board

541
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,310
Geetanjali! Hope you 
have no problems in college!?

542
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,900
There is no problem and 
there won’t be any

543
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,810
Shankar no! Please

544
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,690
Please transfer Aarti to Art department

545
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,400
Aarti likes Arts a lot

546
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,400
I am writing the same now

547
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,900
Why are showing so much 
interest than her?

548
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,480
To get closer to Geetha, why are you 
transferring me to her class?

549
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,100
Aarti you are spellbound 
out of happiness

550
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,600
You need not worry

551
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,900
Shankar will build a bright future for you

552
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,150
Your charm elevated 
as you heard of Art department

553
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,270
She will not do such things! 
Don’t worry

554
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,650
Take it

555
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,310
Give it to me

556
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,190
Thank you dear principal

557
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,600
Hail students friendly Satyamurthy

558
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,350
Hail students friendly 
principal Satyamurthy

559
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,520
Boss went away

560
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,440
To make Kannada primary language

561
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,020
To implement Gokak report completely

562
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,650
To bring pressure on the government

563
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,310
Before Taluk office on coming Sunday 
A rally has been organised

564
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,560
I request Kannadigas to participate in 
the rally and make it successful

565
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,980
What is the use of these protests?

566
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,400
Should not expect profit from everything

567
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,190
if we don’t fight today, our children 
will not be able to learn Kannada

568
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,310
Language means land, water and culture 
Kannada is more than our lives

569
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,020
Your speeches feel like 
you will join politics in future

570
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,400
Protests leads to politics

571
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,650
Brother, I took birth here

572
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,520
I am indebted to 
mother and mother tongue

573
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,270
Mother gives birth

574
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,060
It is Kannada which makes you 
call your mother mom

575
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,100
When that word 
‘mom’ builds a relationship

576
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,270
then the language which gave that word 
is also like mother right?

577
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,730
I am one of her crores of sons

578
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,350
She gave me words

579
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,690
And I’ve given my word to protect her

580
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,400
I’ll protect her

581
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,190
Brother, let there be 
our support in your service

582
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,650
From now on auto and I will be with you

583
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,770
Yes brother, we support you

584
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,980
Shankar! Why guys are 
so addicted to cigaret?

585
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,440
Lips of teenagers are kissed by 
cigarets first before girls

586
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,650
Where is your house?

587
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,650
JC circle

588
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,650
Where exactly?

589
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,020
Fourth cross

590
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,270
Where in Fourth cross

591
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,810
Third house in the Bank quarters

592
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,520
Third house?! 
We painted black mark to that house!

593
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,060
My vehicle got broke down

594
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,520
My friend resides next you

595
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,850
Will you give a lift? 
My house!

596
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
Please come, we will drop you

597
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,150
Shankar no!

598
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,270
She’s alone back there 
Why don’t you give her company

599
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,980
Madam? 
Got it

600
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,190
Take care of my girl

601
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,770
Okay

602
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,980
Place that lamp properly

603
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:57,650
Check if prasad is ready?

604
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,150
Howe are you?

605
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,480
Hey bring those chairs

606
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,980
I am talking to you 
How are you?

607
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,810
Talk to her

608
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,560
Check out those musicians 
Hey Shankar

609
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,020
Geetanjali was speaking to you 
Why didn’t you respond to her?

610
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,770
Poor girl! She felt bad

611
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,400
I heard what she said 
But I didn’t understand

612
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,810
How can I respond to an unknown language?

613
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,770
It is not that I don’t respect her language

614
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,150
She is here since long time

615
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,770
She should have 
learnt Kannada by now

616
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,690
Tell me Aarti

617
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,770
But still

618
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,150
Hey place those flowers here

619
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:48,980
To you Shankar

620
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:50,440
To my friends

621
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,730
Your name? 
Geetanjali

622
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,440
What’s the occasion?

623
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,230
Nothing. Just casually

624
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,060
For you

625
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,650
Anybody home?

626
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,440
No, everyone went to native

627
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,600
To native! That’s why 
the fish has come home

628
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,980
Tell me about Shankar

629
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,230
About Shankar

630
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,190
Who are you? 
What are you doing here?

631
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,480
Officer this is my girl’s house

632
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,810
She’s home alone

633
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,230
I here to safeguard her

634
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,980
We are here for that as Police

635
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,440
Sir children go to school 
but still we send them to tuition

636
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,850
The girl is inside

637
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,560
But why are you standing outside?

638
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,310
You say no one is at home 
why don’t you go inside?

639
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,690
Sir I want to live 
the rest of my life with her

640
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:57,270
I have no intention to use her

641
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:58,900
Even if I go inside

642
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,270
Neighbours will speak ill about her

643
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,350
That’s why I am here

644
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,900
Amidst the guys who 
take advantage of lonely girls

645
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,480
You are safeguarding 
the girl from out side her home

646
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,770
I am really glad

647
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,060
Listening to your words

648
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,850
Fathers who have daughters like me 
feel courageous

649
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,350
Let’s go

650
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:33,190
We are going to play 
Ramayana in Yuva Dasara

651
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,270
Govinda, you are Rama

652
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,230
Prakash, you are Ravana

653
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,520
Geetha, you are Seeta

654
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,350
Look Shankar! 
Ram’s role is given to Govind!

655
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,230
He looks like a patient

656
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,980
No matter what

657
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,020
If Geetha is playing the role of Seetha

658
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,730
Then you must do Ram’s role

659
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,310
Or else, I’ll assemble my monkey troop 
and wage war immediately

660
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,190
Govinda! 
Master?

661
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,060
Ram and Seetha will be in 
solace during exile

662
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,350
Now you deliver this dialogue 
to Seeta with love

663
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,730
Okay master 
Come here

664
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,520
Janaki, my beloved

665
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,600
Hey pronounce it properly

666
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,020
My queen

667
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,060
Hey pronounce it properly

668
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,440
Master, is this a play in Kannada?!

669
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,190
I am not able to understand anything 
How to pronounce it?

670
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,810
It is a Kannada play 
God knows how to teach you!

671
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,100
Janaki

672
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,310
My lord!

673
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,100
You were suppose to be my queen

674
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,850
I couldn’t find enough time 
express my love to you

675
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,650
Now in this exile

676
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,850
We have found solace 
in the middle of this forest

677
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,230
Under the blue umbrella of sky

678
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:07,940
I’ve got an opportunity to pamper 
your moon like face

679
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,100
You were meant to become the queen

680
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,400
You shunned the palace

681
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:23,520
You followed me to the forest to serve me 
I am lucky to have you in my life

682
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,650
I want you to be my wife 
for seven lives to come

683
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,690
Its an honour

684
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,350
If I had got Ram like this 
I would have played Seeta’s role

685
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,480
Take off your hand! You bloody

686
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:54,350
What the hell! 
He is becoming hero everywhere

687
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,150
This is how you should deliver

688
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,730
It is not queen of cities 
It is queen of the throne

689
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,940
You should pronounce Kannada properly

690
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,100
You are doing rowdyism 
in the name of Kannada!

691
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,730
I’ll beat the hell out of you

692
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,020
Hello mister

693
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,940
Why are you beating them? 
What did they do?

694
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:17,980
Extortion

695
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,600
I’ve a complaint that 
they are doing extortion

696
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,100
Foreign language is minting money

697
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,100
You will also be given

698
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,810
Stop these protests

699
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,810
You can buy Karnataka map and flag

700
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,940
But you can’t buy 
Kannadigas self respect

701
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,850
If they get beaten up one more time 
You will all be dead

702
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,020
You give importance to law 
We give importance to our language

703
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,730
Are you not ashamed to do 
such things being a police?

704
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,980
If your hand had moved an inch 
I would have slit you in half

705
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,400
If you raise your hand 
on any Kannada worker

706
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,400
I’ll beat you to hell

707
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,270
Mind it

708
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,430
Mother Seetha!

709
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,800
I’ll immediately go 
in search of brother Ram

710
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,140
Until I return

711
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,350
Don’t cross the line 
drawn by Lakshmana

712
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,180
Mind it

713
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,430
Shankar thrashed me

714
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,850
and portrayed himself 
as a hero in front of Geetha

715
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,260
Wait and watch

716
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:39,800
I’ll hit two birds with one stone

717
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,760
They should not forget Prakash 
for the rest of their lives

718
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,470
What say? 
Right brother

719
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,470
Be careful mother

720
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,390
Oh Mother! Give me some food

721
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,430
Oh Mother! Give me some food

722
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,470
Greetings O wise one

723
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,100
Please come in

724
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,140
I am a saint!

725
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,260
I don’t enter the doors of 
a domestic house

726
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,890
Bring alms to me

727
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,720
Forgive me o wise man

728
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,140
I am not allowed to cross this line

729
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,470
If you are not willing give alms 
You should say no

730
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,600
But you should not insult like this

731
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:28,720
I’ll take a leave

732
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,680
O wise man, stop

733
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,800
Come with me

734
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,100
Geetanjali

735
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,600
I wanted to tell you one thing

736
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,430
Shankar

737
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:20,800
Since you have entered my life 
Everything feels new to me

738
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:25,390
I liked the fighter in you

739
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,800
I felt proud that, Shankar who is 
loved by all is in love with me

740
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,800
Your concern towards your loved ones

741
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,850
Your love towards your language

742
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,050
I like your speech and speed

743
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,220
This angry Ravana 
surrenders to Geetha

744
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,970
If you are in love with me so much

745
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,800
Then I like this Ravan

746
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,050
Shankar, my wish doesn’t end 
in tying knots

747
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,180
Instead

748
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:02,550
I want to stand next to you in 
every odds for the rest of your life

749
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,300
If you say yes

750
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:11,140
This Geetaanjali will be 
with Shankar forever

751
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,600
My heart surrendered to you unknowingly

752
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,300
I am following your footsteps

753
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,100
Two shadows became one

754
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,010
Breath came to life

755
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,510
Your procession in my heart 
is marching ahead

756
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:05,760
A new future has been written 
in my providence

757
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:14,300
My heart surrendered to you unknowingly

758
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:20,010
I am following your footsteps

759
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:17,800
Your arm is my refuge 
shall I live there forever?

760
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:25,350
I am in love with you 
my world is for you

761
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:32,680
My heart is surrendered to you 
without asking my opinion

762
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,930
Your love is my reason to live on

763
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,350
Two shadows became one

764
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,390
Breath came to life

765
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:54,930
Your procession in my heart 
is marching ahead

766
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,260
We are gathered here for

767
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,970
V K Gokak in his Gokak report said

768
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:33,300
Kannada should be the first language 
in every school and

769
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,300
it should be implemented 
immediately last year

770
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,720
The government has not taken 
any actions since then

771
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,640
Condemning this attitude 
by the government

772
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:51,550
P Lankesh, G Shivarudrappa, Rahman Khan 
Chidanand Murthy, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar

773
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,350
Nissar Ahmed and Patil Puttappa

774
00:56:54,470 --> 00:57:01,300
And many poets and Kannada 
organisations had protested

775
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,600
Those who are in 
Vidhanasoudha have not responded yet

776
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,220
If this continues

777
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,260
We are now demanding to use Kannada

778
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:16,010
But after few years we may have to 
beg to save Kannada

779
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,350
Thirty years from now

780
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,300
We will have to work under those people

781
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,930
who are now working under us now

782
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,470
Cut outs of their heroes will be erected

783
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:31,510
If we give directions of 
the asked addressed in their language

784
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,760
We Kannadigas will 
have no existence of our own

785
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,640
It won’t end here

786
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:47,640
We will have to lose thousands of 
year old culture, history and identity

787
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,010
They are using our resources and land 
and behaving as lords

788
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,600
Kannadigas are the lords in Karnataka

789
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,140
Kannadiga is the emperor

790
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,510
We are ready to die for 
our state, culture and heritage

791
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,800
Let any government or law 
try to stop our protest

792
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,220
Our protest will not stop

793
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,100
For some nonsense complaint

794
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,510
You arrested us like some criminals

795
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,680
You are suppose to stand next to us

796
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,010
Inspector, we can’t bear 
with this protestors

797
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,100
Please provide security to our office

798
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,510
Otherwise it will affect 
our work and our customers

799
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,390
Don’t worry sir

800
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,300
We will handle it

801
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,470
( Speaking in Hindi) 
They spoil their lives doing protests

802
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,680
This is the future of our nation

803
00:58:58,850 --> 00:58:59,430
Kannada

804
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:00,680
Have you ever thought about it

805
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,850
Like you throw stones 
at other people houses

806
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:07,050
How will you feel when someone else 
throws stones at your houses?

807
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,140
You felt agitated when we protested 
in front of your house

808
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,550
You come to our cities

809
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,720
You warn us in your mother tongue

810
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,760
Won’t we feel agitated?

811
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:16,680
Shankar

812
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,430
Sir you may go now 
I’ll take care of them please

813
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,800
Bloody rouges

814
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,850
You are talking his side!?

815
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,640
He is a highly influential officer

816
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,050
Don’t go against him

817
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:28,970
He can put you behind bars 
if he wants to

818
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,970
Even I like to help you out

819
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:31,930
But what to do

820
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,850
Except this uniform 
I am a Kannada protestor too

821
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,550
[Reciting Ramayana Darshanam]

822
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:43,350
Shankar

823
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,050
Geetanjali

824
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:49,680
What happened?

825
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,850
Geetha I am alright

826
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:58,680
I am alright

827
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,050
Sit

828
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:12,300
Geetha

829
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,470
Calm down

830
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,760
Getting locked up and released 
is a part of protesting

831
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
You should get panic

832
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:22,390
Shankar

833
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,640
Let’s not indulge in such issues

834
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,220
Come let’s go far away from all this

835
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,510
What if we face problems over there?

836
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:30,600
Where can we go from there?

837
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,800
This is my birth place

838
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,100
My parents and friends live here

839
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:39,720
My life is here

840
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,640
It is my duty to look after your safety

841
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:56,800
We have organised a rally 
for Gokak report implementation

842
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:02,220
We have here to seek permission 
to protest in peace

843
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:06,010
You people approach 
seeking permission to strike

844
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,390
You people have hundred reason 
to create nuisance

845
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:12,430
I can’t support rowdyism in 
the name of language

846
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,140
You misuse language

847
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,680
Nonsense 
You can leave now

848
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,760
Dear friends

849
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,430
No matter how much we raise voice 
It is falling on government’s deaf ears

850
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:39,180
This fight is limited to poets, intellectuals 
protestors and thinkers

851
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,550
If this is the case, thenthe government 
will not even give a damn

852
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,850
Then how to grab 
government’s attention?

853
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,300
We must reach each and every 
Kannadiga with this rally

854
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,680
If students, farmers 
labours and auto drivers

855
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,510
and everyone should stand together 
Only then we can achieve justice

856
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,890
What should be done for that?

857
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,600
We must travel to the nooks and 
corners of Karnataka

858
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:03,850
And flame the fire of Kannada 
in each every person

859
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,010
Who will support us in this?

860
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,890
There are many people

861
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,430
Along with poets, artists 
have expressed their support

862
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,220
Recently Varanata Dr Rajkumar 
has written a letter

863
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,550
expressing his support to Gokak movement

864
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,680
He has also stated that whenever there is 
a threat to Kannada and its people

865
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,640
he will fight till his last breath against it

866
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,050
When Annavru stepped into the arena 
The arena is ours

867
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,970
From where we are starting our journey?

868
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,050
Shankar, what about DC’s permission?

869
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,640
Hey get down

870
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,600
First thing

871
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,640
If you act as per law like a DC 
We will respond the same way

872
01:03:59,220 --> 01:03:59,850
Second thing

873
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,510
We can’t improve a language

874
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,970
But language excels us

875
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,470
Our job is to protect it

876
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,970
If we get provoked

877
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,430
Do you think this is some UP or Bihar?

878
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,600
Give respect and take respect here

879
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,350
Last and final

880
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,680
You can stop us being a DC

881
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,010
You cant stop us as a person

882
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,800
It will be an order if you grant

883
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,300
It will be a war if we snatch it

884
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,640
This is Kannada’s chariot

885
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,760
Come join us

886
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:09,300
As our land, our language and voice

887
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,890
Lets march ahead as one for the language

888
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,680
Demand justice

889
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:21,640
shout that you are Karunada’s warrior

890
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:36,180
O Kannadiga

891
01:05:54,010 --> 01:06:00,800
Learn and teach 
how ancient our language is

892
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:07,890
Kannada language which taught us 
the word 'Mother' is our breath

893
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,100
Let us mediate on it every moment

894
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:19,050
We are indebted to 
mother and mother tongue

895
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:29,800
Let may anyone stand against us 
Our decision will not change

896
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:43,720
O Kannadiga

897
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,720
Self esteem is our bloodline

898
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:26,100
Kannada is our self respect

899
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:29,640
Respect which we are 
enjoying by the language

900
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:33,300
is the gift granted by 
Mother Bhuvaneshwari

901
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,350
Yellow and red flag is 
the foundation to our Kannada

902
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:44,350
Annavru is the leader to our movement

903
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:51,260
People’s affection is our strength

904
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:54,550
This victory will be historical

905
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:10,850
O Kannadiga

906
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,140
Geetanjali

907
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,140
Dad

908
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,600
I didn’t expect this from you

909
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:55,220
Come here

910
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,890
Do you the whereabouts 
of your neighbour?

911
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,600
I’ve not seen them since three days 
Must have vacated the house

912
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:34,970
I don’t know sir 
He hasn’t taken the transfer

913
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,600
He has left the job without 
any intimation

914
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,680
So we don’t where he is

915
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:41,760
Okay sir

916
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,720
At last dreams came true

917
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,220
Shankar

918
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:42,390
since Geetanjali went away 
You are in deep sorrow

919
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:46,260
I am worried about you

920
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,180
You are not the only one 
who is suffering

921
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,260
Your parents are worried about you too

922
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,100
Its been days seeing you normal

923
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:57,720
I know how hard it is for you 
that Geetanjali left you

924
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,100
But there are people 
who are counting on you

925
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,140
At least for us 
you must snap out of this

926
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:10,720
You must become normal again

927
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:27,430
I’ll be with you

928
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:41,680
Geetanjali

929
01:13:59,010 --> 01:13:59,550
Shankar

930
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:02,550
How are you?

931
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,300
Geetanjali

932
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:07,930
where were you all these days?

933
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,760
How are you? 
I tried so much...

934
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,010
It is a long story Shankar

935
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,890
The day you and my father fought 
On that night

936
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,510
Dad took me to our native

937
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:23,510
He boxed me in without letting me 
write a letter to you

938
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,930
He tried a lot to get me married 
to someone else

939
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,800
But I didn’t agree

940
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,510
I told him I’ll not marry 
anyone else than Shankar

941
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:39,220
He tried whatever he could 
Then he stopped

942
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,640
I still long for you

943
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:46,430
No one can separate 
Shankar and Geetanjali

944
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,260
When you went away from me

945
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,550
I was very much depressed

946
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:01,970
The one who supported me 
during that time it was

947
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:04,260
Aarti

948
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:17,640
Shankar

949
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,470
I want to see you happy forever

950
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,270
Your friend was so happy

951
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,680
That smile and celebration

952
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:14,350
Wedding ambience feels superb

953
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,730
This happiness will last only for two days

954
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:19,100
Then the real character will surface

955
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:23,140
Then we start doubting,if are they 
the same person whom we liked

956
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:26,060
Why are you so pessimistic 
about marriage?

957
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,730
Many people are 
successfully leading their married life

958
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:32,520
Falling in love, getting married 
are not a big deal

959
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:36,230
Keeping that love alive for 
years is a big deal

960
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:40,100
When we are in love 
we like the person as they are

961
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:41,850
When it comes to marriage

962
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:45,640
You want the person to be the way you want

963
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,430
After the marriage domination will start

964
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:51,350
Even parents

965
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:54,730
expect their children 
to look after them in old age

966
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,600
That much of 
minor selfishness will be there

967
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:01,640
I agree Prem wanting to change you 
was his selfishness

968
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,600
You wanted to live the way you like 
was also your selfishness, right?

969
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:15,930
If everybody thinks in the same way 
We couldn’t have survived

970
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:20,020
Everything will be alright 
after marriage

971
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,100
Don’t worry

972
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,060
I told you everything will be alright

973
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:37,060
Go answer the call 
Talk to him

974
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,390
Hello

975
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:44,680
Did you make up your mind?

976
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:45,680
Regarding?

977
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:47,730
About our marriage

978
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:49,430
Change your decision

979
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,390
Stop caring NGO’s kids

980
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:53,980
You know about me

981
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:56,270
If I’ve done anything wrong 
I’ll correct myself

982
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:59,180
But I can’t give up on my dreams Prem

983
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:01,270
Is this your final decision?

984
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:03,560
I am sorry Prem

985
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:23,890
Akash

986
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:26,810
I climbed your window putting so much effort

987
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:28,680
If you don’t hold my hand

988
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:30,680
I’ll fall down and break my body parts

989
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:31,230
What?!

990
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:35,480
Akash!

991
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:40,430
Come

992
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:44,890
Careful

993
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:59,680
This is for me

994
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:04,180
This is for you

995
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:07,680
Sorry

996
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,930
This is for you 
Ready to drink

997
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:13,310
This is for me

998
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:14,560
Why did you come here?

999
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,270
Everyone drink 
to overcome loneliness

1000
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,020
So what’s the point in drinking alone?

1001
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,180
So brought it to have a company

1002
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,480
Pickles please

1003
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:30,850
Akash

1004
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,310
Smile Geetha

1005
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:40,930
Please smile once

1006
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:51,230
You have a beautiful smile

1007
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:55,100
God has customised your smile

1008
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,270
Keep smiling

1009
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:00,310
Many girls

1010
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:07,480
think grooming themselves is big task

1011
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:09,980
But you

1012
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:16,680
you are trying to give 
a beautiful life to children

1013
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:26,980
You are the most beautiful girl 
I’ve seen in this world

1014
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:31,730
You are the most beautiful girl in this world

1015
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:55,060
This is the first time I am seeing you 
laugh from the bottom of your heart

1016
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:58,850
These children happiness is your world right?

1017
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:02,020
Happiness of these children 
is everything to me

1018
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,810
They are my world

1019
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,560
My dream is

1020
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:12,640
to build a place where 
these kids can aspire big things

1021
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:17,180
I shared the same with Prem

1022
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:21,730
Love should have 
adjustments not compromises

1023
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:23,520
Sorry

1024
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:24,890
No.. no

1025
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,560
This is what I said

1026
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:29,730
Don’t compromise your nature

1027
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:41,100
Hello this place belong to us

1028
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:43,640
This NGO will be closed

1029
01:47:43,810 --> 01:47:45,060
Withdraw the case

1030
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:46,430
I will not withdraw the case

1031
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,810
Don’t go against us 
for the sake of these children

1032
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,350
Geetha is calling you from long time

1033
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,100
She was here entire night

1034
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:44,560
She was talking about you Akash

1035
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:48,100
Are you both in love?

1036
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:50,230
No nothing like that

1037
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:51,850
She’s engaged to someone

1038
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:54,640
But marriage is on hold due to 
some issues from groom side

1039
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,480
I guess girls named Geetha

1040
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:01,480
don’t get love

1041
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,350
I’ll bring coffee

1042
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:15,480
Apparently Geetha spent 
last night in your home

1043
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:18,680
Only you two were there at home

1044
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:21,140
What kind of a father you are?!

1045
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:24,390
Are you not ashamed to talk 
about your daughter so lightly?

1046
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,230
I want to know what happened

1047
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,140
Akash 
What?

1048
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:53,770
Akash help me

1049
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,890
Help me

1050
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:03,810
Stop over there

1051
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,390
Akash

1052
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:24,390
you are angry on me

1053
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:27,730
I am a loafer

1054
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:37,310
You must be wondering what kind of a father 
to such a good girl like Geetha

1055
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:39,230
Geetha is a very good girl

1056
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:42,600
I am her single parent

1057
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:52,810
I know how hard it is for a girl 
to grow up without her mother

1058
01:52:53,890 --> 01:52:57,730
She said she wants to do MSW 
I said Okay

1059
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:02,480
She said she wants to work in an NGO 
I said okay

1060
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:06,680
She said she will marry Prem

1061
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:08,930
I got her engaged to him

1062
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:12,020
One fine day she said 
she don’t want Prem

1063
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:14,770
I didn’t even ask her why

1064
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:22,520
Agreeing to her every word

1065
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:25,980
I’ve forgotten to question her

1066
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:30,100
She used to be awake whole night 
and cry all alone

1067
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:33,060
If asked, she used to feel sad

1068
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:34,770
During that time

1069
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:39,270
You came into her life

1070
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:53,270
After you came 
she started to smile again

1071
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:56,100
Started to live happily

1072
01:53:57,850 --> 01:54:02,520
I was happy to see you both 
spending time together

1073
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:09,480
I never misunderstood 
when you both spent nights together

1074
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:13,560
Because I trust you both

1075
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:18,560
I can’t be with her for 
the rest for her life

1076
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:24,310
I strongly feel that 
she will be happy with you

1077
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:27,350
Be with her

1078
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:30,980
Be with her Akash

1079
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:47,980
Hello

1080
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,480
What sir!? No calls, no texts these days!

1081
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:52,770
Seems you have forgotten me

1082
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:53,730
Nothing like that

1083
01:55:56,140 --> 01:55:57,430
Someone is knocking the door

1084
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:59,140
Go open the door

1085
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,640
Who is knocking the door?

1086
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:04,100
Surprise

1087
01:56:06,890 --> 01:56:07,850
I wanna be with you

1088
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:09,480
I want to spend time with you

1089
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:10,980
I missed you so much

1090
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,890
No call... nothing

1091
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:14,430
Don’t talk now 
Get ready first

1092
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:42,560
Your touch is an all new experience

1093
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:47,270
Every moment spent with you 
is an never ending joy

1094
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:52,230
You are mine, and we belong to love

1095
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,520
Life is mine now

1096
01:56:57,310 --> 01:57:01,730
I want to express this to you

1097
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:06,600
I’ll be with you forever 
Accept my love

1098
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:15,230
Tell me how can I live without you?

1099
01:57:16,850 --> 01:57:25,390
Tell me how can I 
live without you?

1100
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:30,020
Priya

1101
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,180

1102
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:32,060

01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:33,980
Geetha

1104
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:38,390
Akash told me about Prem 
I felt sad

1105
01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:42,060
Priya come with me 
Help me to get drinks

1106
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,560
What Akash? 
What were you talking?

1107
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:49,350
Don’t talk nonsense with her

1108
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:51,600
Oh sorry! Leave it

1109
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:53,100
I want to say something to you

1110
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:56,230
Akash, you are getting a call

1111
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:57,480
Yes madam, I am coming

1112
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,020
But Akash

1113
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:14,730
Whose call was that?

1114
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:17,020

1115
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:24,770

1119
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:50,270
Madam open the door

1120
01:58:53,390 --> 01:58:55,100
It’s not that I didn’t want to tell you

1121
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:57,430
I couldn't find the right time to tell you

1122
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,730
You were already hurt

1123
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:04,560
So I didn’t want to hurt you more 
by telling this

1124
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,020
Madam please try and understand

1125
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:46,390
I tried to tell you yesterday 
But I could not

1126
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:53,680
I told you many times 
But you ignored

1127
01:59:54,230 --> 01:59:55,430
Priya told us everything

1128
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:57,430
After so many years

1129
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:00,850
It is Priya who 
brought happiness to our home

1130
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:07,810
Priya has understood you well

1131
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,560
She will take very good care of you

1132
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,560
Me and your mom are happy with this

1133
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,430
it is Priya who is responsible 
for us to reunite

1134
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:20,060
We will get you both married

1135
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:21,640
Did I not tell you?

1136
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:24,180
You will have a smiling 
family photo one fine day

1137
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:27,310
And your parents 
will re-unite for your sake

1138
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:13,640
Me and Akash are getting engaged

1139
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,850
I must thank you for that

1140
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:20,230
Because, I and Akash met 
for the first time in your engagement

1141
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:25,140
We are getting engaged in Bengaluru 
You must come one week prior

1142
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,680

1143
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:28,060
I am very happy for you

1144
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:31,350
Your best friend is becoming 
your life partner

1145
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:36,560
It is a fortune to spend life 
with the one we love

1146
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:41,890
Akash makes fun 
to keep his people happy

1147
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,100
He doesn’t intend to hurt anyone

1148
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:48,770
If a man who keeps us happy 
is a special person

1149
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:50,980
Then Akash is very special

1150
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:55,310
Whoever leads life with him 
will be happy all the time

1151
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:57,480
You too

1152
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:01,020
You too must attend uncle

1153
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:06,430
Akash

1154
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,680
Ours is a planned family

1155
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:09,980
Only daughter

1156
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:12,890
We want to have a big fat wedding

1157
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,140
Not only that

1158
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:16,350
we want to capture 
every moment of her wedding

1159
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:21,270
We have a family photographer who has captured 
her every moment since her childhood

1160
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:22,560
He is Photo Raja

1161
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:23,640
Smile

1162
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:25,060
Greetings everybody

1163
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:33,890
He is the king for auto drivers 
I am Photo Raja

1164
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:38,350
Amateurs buy a second hand camera in EMI

1165
02:02:38,730 --> 02:02:41,430
But I’ve started taking photos 
When they were in their childhood

1166
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:46,890
It is me who started Candid photo

1167
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:50,060
I was taking photos seriously

1168
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:52,730
Someone stamped my leg 
So i bent down

1169
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:54,350
It got clicked

1170
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,730
Everyone made it a style

1171
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,980
And star cameramen 
in Kannada film industry

1172
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:04,680
They are all my friends

1173
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:09,930
Satya Hegde, Pataje 
Benki Chandru and Male krishna

1174
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:12,060
I’ve height phobia

1175
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:14,430
I was not able to stand on top of Jog falls

1176
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:16,100
So I gave that chance to Male Krishna

1177
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:17,890
Mungaru Male has become a history now

1178
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,930
Our achievements should not be spoken

1179
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:21,640
But I did

1180
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:25,890
Now whose photo shall I take? 
From where shall I start?

1181
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:27,770
Okay smile

1182
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:34,770
How is it?

1183
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:39,310
Will see more...

1184
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,930

Is it nice?

1185
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:42,680
Yeah nice

1186
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:44,270
Its not good 
Let me check others

1187
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:49,810
How is this?

1188
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:51,060
Very nice

1189
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,140
Everything is nice for you

1190
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:57,730
You are getting confused 
I’ll do one thing

1191
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:58,600
Shall I pick this?

1192
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:02,600
I’ll send pics to Geetha

1193
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:04,930
She will judge properly

1194
02:04:08,730 --> 02:04:09,020
Okay

1195
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,270
Black, this is nice

1196
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:16,810
This is right for me

1197
02:04:17,770 --> 02:04:18,180
Isn’t it nice?

1198
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:19,600
Fine

1199
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:22,390
Isn’t it nice?

1200
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:30,270
Mobile phone distances the near ones

1201
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:31,680
and brings close 
those who are distant

1202
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,550
Do one thing 
Panner in vegetarian

1203
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:39,800
Three items in paneer is mandatory

1204
02:04:40,090 --> 02:04:41,130
And I want Mainstage here

1205
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:43,670
Use lily and satbara flower

1206
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,090
Shorba in mutton and

1207
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:48,800
Ask Akash too

1208
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:50,920
I know Akash’s taste very well

1209
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:52,750
Don’t want much in chicken

1210
02:04:53,090 --> 02:04:53,670
Fish is important

1211
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:56,710
You take a call on 
rest of the dishes, then...

1212
02:05:00,670 --> 02:05:01,170
Akash

1213
02:05:02,590 --> 02:05:05,000
My parents are here 
You are smoking in their presence!

1214
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:06,170
Is this new Priya?

1215
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,000
You are getting married Akash

1216
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:10,710
Avoid this in front of them at least

1217
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,000
Use chewing gum

1218
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:18,380
What has happened to this city?

1219
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:20,630
Smoke every where

1220
02:05:21,710 --> 02:05:23,920
Smoke is injurious to health

1221
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:26,920
Girls are injurious to boys

1222
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:28,380
Smile

1223
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:30,050
Dal is yummy

1224
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:31,670
Is it so? Shall I serve more?

1225
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,590
No enough

1226
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,130
Akash, you look low 
What happened?

1227
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:38,250
Stressed

1228
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,880
Wedding arrangement is stressful

1229
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:42,170
Have food

1230
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:45,920
Arrangements are going good

1231
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,960
Akash waiste is 33

1232
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:51,300
32 will be perfect

1233
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:53,340
Engagement photos 
will be with us for life time

1234
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:56,250
Don’t get lazy, start working out

1235
02:06:01,630 --> 02:06:03,380
Don’t sweat out because she say so

1236
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:06,170
Sweat out on right time

1237
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:17,000
Akash, I’ve been trying to call you

1238
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:18,210
Not Akash, its priya

1239
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:20,840
Is Akash there?

1240
02:06:21,130 --> 02:06:22,170
Akash is busy right now

1241
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:24,210
Its an emergency

1242
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:26,380
Akash is busy Geetha

1243
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:27,590
You know it right?

1244
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:30,550
Got to do shopping and other stuffs 
regarding engagement

1245
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:34,210
He usually gets occupied in 
texting and calling you these days

1246
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,710
Let him spend some time with me

1247
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:38,210
We need some privacy too

1248
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:39,800
I hope you understand

1249
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,090
Cheers 
Cheers

1250
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:07,460
In this digital world

1251
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:10,500
You are still having a Negative studio

1252
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:14,670
Just by having a camera 
can’t become a photographer

1253
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:19,130
We are the one who say ‘smile please’ 
from negative to digital

1254
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:21,710
Without us there won’t be any memory

1255
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:24,130
Look at the photos I have clicked

1256
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:26,920
My photo will be displayed here too right?

1257
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:29,300
Mine should be on top

1258
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:30,630
Look at your photo here

1259
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,630
This is from day before yesterday

1260
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:33,800
This is teeth-rich Smiles

1261
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:34,920
This is a smile

1262
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:36,460
This is flirtatious smile

1263
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
This is fake smile

1264
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:41,960
Everyone like this smile

1265
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:44,420
You are losing your smile

1266
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,550
How dare you address me in singular?

1267
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:53,050
We became friends

1268
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:56,250
A peg can make you a friend, an enemy

1269
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,670
Illusion!

1270
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,500
Cheers to our friendship, dude

1271
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:08,300
Why are you getting married?

1272
02:08:09,170 --> 02:08:12,960
Many people won’t be having any idea 
Why they are getting married

1273
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:15,550
They say I am getting old

1274
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,500
I can manage for ten years

1275
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,380
They get married

1276
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:21,880
Few get married to have children

1277
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:25,460
Few get married because 
they are growing grey hair

1278
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:30,210
Few get married to fulfil 
their bed ridden granny’s wish

1279
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,170
Granny will survive 
But he will be dead

1280
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:38,130
Is your granny bed ridden or 
You want to get onto bed?

1281
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:43,800
You need not answer me 
Its enough if you know it

1282
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,590
Priya is a very good girl 
till you get married

1283
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,090
you can have friendship with anyone 
but can’t marry them

1284
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:56,590
Shouldn’t marry to please someone 
Due to that both lives will be ruined

1285
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:00,050
Marriage should become a holy knot

1286
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:02,170
Not a riddle

1287
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,050
I love you Akash

1288
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:09,210
Everyone is happy here

1289
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:11,460
Except me

1290
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:18,210
I am not happy with my own engagement

1291
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:22,750
Priya, you are my good friend 
But as a life partner?

1292
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:26,800
If we get married 
even after realising this

1293
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:28,550
Not only our married life

1294
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:29,960
even our friendship will be doomed

1295
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:36,880
You liked whatever I did 
when we were friends

1296
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:39,800
But not after becoming your fience

1297
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:44,000
If we get married 
even after realising this

1298
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:46,500
We both will become like them

1299
02:10:47,550 --> 02:10:49,550
I’ll not commit the same mistake 
what my parents had committed

1300
02:10:50,170 --> 02:10:52,380
Akash, what are you talking?

1301
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:54,590
I don’t like Panner

1302
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:57,750
You selected the menu 
without even asking me

1303
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:01,460
Right from water bottle to everything 
You made all the decorations

1304
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:02,670
Good.. Very good

1305
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:06,380
You didn’t ask my opinion for anything

1306
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,630
You can find a guy 
who can obey you in everything

1307
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:12,920
That guy

1308
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,550
Is not me Priya

1309
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:20,710
You may feel sad 
You may think I am a bad man

1310
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:24,340
If I don’t become a bad man now

1311
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:26,920
Both our lives will go bad

1312
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:38,750
You want to capture every 
happy moment of your daughter

1313
02:11:39,250 --> 02:11:42,590
Then you will to weep looking at 
the same photo for the rest of your lives

1314
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,590
The pain of broken marriage 
is nothing compared to

1315
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,550
the pain of your daughter 
getting separated from her husband

1316
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:52,960
Break up is better than divorce

1317
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:06,170
Akash

1318
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:07,420
Don’t be so haste

1319
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:12,800
I agreed to this marriage 
so that you both will get reunited

1320
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,550
Your happiness is my happiness

1321
02:12:16,590 --> 02:12:19,170
You want to get separated 
the very next day of my marriage

1322
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:23,840
Let us be together like this 
till Akash gets married

1323
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:25,130
After the marriage

1324
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:27,460
You go your way 
I go my way

1325
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,840
I made a big mistake by 
trusting you both

1326
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:33,210
If I don’t act now

1327
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:36,340
My child will have to suffer 
what I am suffering

1328
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:39,420
Instead living a fake life

1329
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:42,550
The one who is living in your memory 
from last thirty years

1330
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:46,050
Rather than your 
fake smile and happiness

1331
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:47,800
Her agony is far soothing

1332
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:06,050
Sir where is Geetha?

1333
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:18,210
Prem had come

1334
02:13:19,670 --> 02:13:20,590
My family is pressurising me

1335
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,170
They have found a nice match

1336
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:23,590
She’s pretty

1337
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,050
Getting married to her next month

1338
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:32,090
Don’t leave her if she gets fat 
after the marriage

1339
02:13:33,050 --> 02:13:33,880
Congratulations

1340
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:38,130
You have come late

1341
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:44,170
I couldn’t give her a peaceful life

1342
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:48,210
She went in search of peace

1343
02:13:50,710 --> 02:13:51,630
I didn’t stop her

1344
02:13:56,630 --> 02:13:59,710
You brought confidence in her life again

1345
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:03,880
Only you can convince her

1346
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:09,210
She missed her train of her life

1347
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:13,130
Now stop her from boarding the train

1348
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:43,300
Invitation is mine

1349
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:47,460
attendance is yours

1350
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:54,170
Be with me till the end

1351
02:14:56,210 --> 02:15:03,000
I waiting persistently after inviting you

1352
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:10,670
Without you my life is a song of the mute

1353
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:15,050
Come o my companion

1354
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:19,210
Be my voice o my companion

1355
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Be with me be my life

1356
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:33,800
Geetha o my Geetha

1357
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:40,840
Geetha o my Geetha

1358
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:11,380
There was a time 
when I was waiting for you

1359
02:16:11,710 --> 02:16:19,090
I’ve found a way to wait for you

1360
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:27,090
I was blind to lov 
you opened my eyes and left

1361
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:34,880
I am a child before you 
I saw mother in you

1362
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:39,050
Be my happiness o my companion

1363
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:42,750
be my laughter o my companion

1364
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:49,630
be the life of this poor man

1365
02:16:50,960 --> 02:17:06,380
Geetha o my Geetha

1366
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,960
Akash! How come you are here?

1367
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:30,090
What happened to your engagement?

1368
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:32,000
I cancelled it

1369
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:35,250
I cancelled the engagement Geetha

1370
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:36,710
Why?

1371
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:43,670
Being in love with you 
how can I marry Priya?

1372
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:46,000
So I broke up

1373
02:17:46,590 --> 02:17:47,880
Akash, what are you saying?

1374
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:49,300
Yes Geetha

1375
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,130
I can’t live without you

1376
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:53,670
You are correct

1377
02:17:55,210 --> 02:17:57,170
I felt I was missing something

1378
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:00,710
But I didn’t know what I was missing

1379
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:04,210
The answer to the question was

1380
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:05,880
Geetha

1381
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:07,800
Sorry Akash

1382
02:18:08,550 --> 02:18:11,960
I didn’t know 
you could mistake my closeness

1383
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:15,420
I never thought about you in that way

1384
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:17,630
You are my good friend

1385
02:18:18,710 --> 02:18:19,710
I respect you

1386
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:21,840
But that doesn’t mean I love you

1387
02:18:27,710 --> 02:18:30,880
I took time to realise

1388
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:35,000
You need time 
You need time to realise Geetha

1389
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:38,550
I broke up my engagement for you

1390
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,460
You are prejudiced and 
looking at me in that perspective

1391
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:48,590
thats it 
You take time

1392
02:18:49,210 --> 02:18:52,590
Just because Prem left or 
sympathy over me

1393
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:53,500
is not love Akash

1394
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:54,630
It should be mutual

1395
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:57,920
I don’t have such kind of 
emotions towards you

1396
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:00,300
You are not getting my point

1397
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:06,500
Geetha, I wearing the same dress 
you selected for me

1398
02:19:09,130 --> 02:19:10,050
You like me too

1399
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:13,750
See you are wearing the watch 
which I gifted you

1400
02:19:14,130 --> 02:19:15,130
Akash don’t be silly

1401
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:17,590
Wearing watch or dress 
doesn’t mean love

1402
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:20,670
You broke your 
engagement so easily

1403
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:23,090
You shunned Priya for me

1404
02:19:23,670 --> 02:19:25,500
What guarantee that 
you won’t leave me in the future?

1405
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:29,090
Listen Geetha

1406
02:19:30,090 --> 02:19:31,710
You have committed 
a mistake in your life

1407
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:33,090
Don’t repeat the same again

1408
02:19:35,710 --> 02:19:36,960
Geetha please listen to me

1409
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:41,000
Akash, you are not the right person 
to judge me or my decisions

1410
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,960
Both our lives are different

1411
02:19:43,710 --> 02:19:45,090
I never loved you

1412
02:19:45,630 --> 02:19:47,590
Sorry Geetha, listen to me

1413
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,050
I don’t how to tell you

1414
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:50,710
I am not kidding

1415
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:54,500
I didn’t break my marriage 
to make you believe

1416
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:58,000
but for the love you believe in

1417
02:19:58,460 --> 02:20:00,300
Please listen to me

1418
02:20:01,590 --> 02:20:02,340
Get down please

1419
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:04,840
Get down please

1420
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:07,960
Come lets talk Geetha

1421
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:09,840
Listen to me

1422
02:20:12,550 --> 02:20:15,210
Geetha train is moving 
Get down

1423
02:20:18,130 --> 02:20:21,590
Why don’t you trust me? 
Don’t leave me Geetha

1424
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:25,090
You haven’t understood me properly

1425
02:20:25,710 --> 02:20:27,000
When you realise, you will come 
in search of me

1426
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:29,920
I’ll wait till then

1427
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:32,380
I’ll wait for you Geetha

1428
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:23,340
For how long 
you are going to wait Akash?

1429
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:31,170
This generation is running fast with 
love, marriage, break up and divorce

1430
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:36,500
You are waiting for your loved one 
to come back

1431
02:21:41,130 --> 02:21:43,210
I am scared Akash

1432
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:48,250
Living with your loved one is happiness

1433
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:59,130
Waiting for her return 
has more happiness

1434
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:01,630
On what belief you are waiting for her?

1435
02:22:15,250 --> 02:22:18,340
Sir I am from KM Tv 
I am interviewing achievers

1436
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:22,090
Sir you are well educated and 
a software engineer

1437
02:22:22,630 --> 02:22:26,340
Leaving that job and family behind

1438
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:28,090
You are living with these kids

1439
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:29,880
What inspired you?

1440
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:32,750
Geetha...

1441
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:36,210
and her dream...

1442
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:39,000
are my life...

1443
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:44,670
Geetha’s dream was to find meaning 
in life in others happiness

1444
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:51,550
That dream is this beautiful place

1445
02:22:53,300 --> 02:22:58,420
I felt surprised whenever I saw 
Geetha loving children

1446
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:07,420
Trying to build 
strangers lives is an idea

1447
02:23:08,670 --> 02:23:09,590
It is a big deal

1448
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:17,050
Every moment I spend 
with these children

1449
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:20,090
makes me feel 
I am with Geetha

1450
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:23,000
Geetha has left me

1451
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:29,920
But she has left her love with me

1452
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:29,590
Sorry for misunderstanding

1453
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:31,250
Thank you

1454
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:36,460
For bringing back 
happiness in my life

1455
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:42,710
and for living for me and my dream

1456
02:25:45,170 --> 02:25:48,340
From now on I’ll not look 
at my face in the mirror

1457
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:50,750
I’ll look into your eyes

1458
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:58,090
Me and my life will be safe and 
beautiful in your eyes

1459
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:03,880
This Geetha is yours now

1460
02:28:05,380 --> 02:28:05,420
BEEP
