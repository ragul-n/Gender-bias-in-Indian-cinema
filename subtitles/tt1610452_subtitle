There are loads and
loads of dreams ...

6
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,495
And we have hatched
brilliant schemes.

7
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,534
Colourful dreams ...

8
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:30,729
quirky schemes.

16
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:56,920
The plans are rooted deep,

17
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:01,327
Though the path is steep.

18
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:05,633
You will realize the dream,
because you've got the scheme.

19
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:10,199

We will tackle the future tomorrow

25
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:49,442
We won't budge come joy or sorrow.

26
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:54,249
And if our
ambitions were to turn cold

27
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:03,262
We'll warm them with
rising sun, lo and behold.

28
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:11,267
Tension is nothing more
than a wrinkle on the forehead

29
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:15,704
lt's the earnest smiles, that
resolve everything in the head.

30
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:20,007
Try it out, just try it
out ... exploit the schemes

Schemes.

40
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,387
What's this?

41
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:11,521
lt's daal ... move on.

42
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,065
Food first ...
- What do you think this is?

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,391
Horse shit! We pay
1200 per month ...

44
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,461
Should l call the warden?

45
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,835
Call him ... and ask him to
bring us his biryani along.

46
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:22,873
Screaming at him won't get us
the biryani ... give me your phone.

47
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:24,001
Use yours ...

48
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,874
My outgoing has just been
barred by the phone company ...

49
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,510
So Thape? What does it look like?

50
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:39,654
OK, biryani for
dinner has been fixed!

51
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,358
Ten rupees everyone ... entry fee.

52
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,090
Oh, so it's our cash
and your party, Bittoo.

53
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,001
Bittoo, you've started already?

54
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,733
We will eat as much as we can.

55
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,766
So Thapa?

56
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:57,434
Out in 10 minutes ...

57
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,876
Even the smell will not
be felt in 10 minutes.

58
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,708
lt's a dance party, not a
wedding night with very few guests.

59
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,444
You'll get caught easily ...
and l will lose my job.

60
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,850
lt's just a job. Easy come easy go.

61
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,385
Please Bittoo, just hurry up.

62
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,940
Minki and Binny.

63
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,136
Bittoo Boss.

64
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,471
Hey sunny, pan here dude.

65
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,414
Why are you posing
looking dull? Spice it up, man.

66
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,687
How are you doing buddy?
Looking like a rock star.

67
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,470
The plates are really small.

68
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:03,072
Excuse me ... which
side are you from?

69
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,035
Why should l tell you?

70
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,441
One minute ... please step aside.

71
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:09,573
Why should l?

72
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,514
Keep the plate here ...
call Mr. Kochar.

73
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,178
Quickly. Aunty, please come
forward and serve yourself.

74
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,178
Please step aside, you
are blocking the way.

75
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:18,889
Who are you to put me aside?

76
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,621
Anu aunty's assistant ... she
has organised this entire night ...

77
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,130
and it's my duty to see
that no riff-raff eat here.

78
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,722
l am no riff-raff!

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,791
Who knows ... we'll
find out right now.

80
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,529
Yes ... tell me what happened.

81
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:33,538
Here is the bride's uncle.
Uncle, should l let him eat?

82
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:35,005
ls he from the groom's
side or the bride's?

83
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,133
From neither side.

84
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,539
l knew it! You are a riff-raff.

85
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,044
Who are you calling riff-raff?

86
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:44,514
Sunny! Come here.

87
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:47,744
Come here.

88
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:49,880
Tell them who l am.

89
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,480
We are both with the video team.

90
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,890
Really? l've not seen you around.

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,487
We work very quietly ...
to not disturb the gentry.

92
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,093
lt's all planning, uncle.

93
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:03,559
We thought we'd get dinner out of
the way before the dancing started.

94
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:05,629
We won't eat if you don't like.

95
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:09,507
ln every wedding we are
treated with respect ...

96
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,134
and offered food and she
is calling me riff-raff.

97
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,508
lt's my duty.
lf we run short of food ...

98
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,638
because riff-raff like
you have eaten it ...

99
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:15,772
Uncle will question me, right?

100
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:23,053
Spit the anger out, and eat well.
Later you shoot well. OK?

101
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,818
Yes, yes of course.
Sunny, you get the best shots.

102
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,122
Give them a plate and what
about the dancing? Get it started.

103
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,252
Sure! About to start.

104
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:39,996
ls there a leg piece?

105
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,131
Cheapster!

106
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:48,740
OK everyone, come to the centre
please, let the dancing begin.

107
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,548
There won't be just songs
on this musical night ...

108
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:55,554
there will be dancing and competing.

109
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,622
So will the bride's
team win or the groom's?

110
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,721
This will be decided once
their relatives join the dance.

111
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,164
Uncle, please start the dance,

112
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:07,859
you surely look like
you could break a leg!

113
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,294
Please come everyone.

114
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,900

116
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:25,744

119
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:37,785

l went shopping and

127
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:11,290

Hello, Mrs. Aggarwal ...

159
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,226
good afternoon l say.

160
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,090
l am Binny's uncle.

161
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:57,867
Just wanted to thank you
for last night's function.

162
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,737
lt went well because you
worked hard and your assistant ...

163
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:03,776
what was her name again?

164
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:08,070
Shruti ... oh, yes.
ls it just Shruti or ...?

165
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,273
Oh Kakkar.

166
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,747
No, it's just that
some of our relatives ...

167
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,085
were enquiring about her last night.

168
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,757
Look at the irony, while she is busy
in arranging the weddings of others ...

169
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:22,818
there are proposals coming for her.

170
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,356
Really?

171
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,499
ls there someone?

172
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:39,506
No ... No it's correct.

173
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,905
Education is crucial,
she should complete her ...

174
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,038
graduation before getting married.

175
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:45,317
Besides, there is hardly any time
left for her to finish her education.

176
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,819
Which college is she in by the way?

177
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:53,189
Go, go, go ... found her
classmates. Shruti Kakkar has left.

178
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,160
She got onto the U-special bus just a
minute ago to go home ... go, go, go.

179
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,526
Where does she stay?
- Janak Puri.

180
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,921
Janak Puri?
She must be an aunty-like!

181
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,523
Your aunty, not mine.

182
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,792
lf you had been so
dedicated towards ...

183
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,394
your education you could
have topped your college.

184
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,268
Mikka, speed up ...
quit the lecture.

185
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:11,542
Look there ... the bus ...

186
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,806
hurry up, what are you doing?

187
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,178
You will get us stuck, move out.

188
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,410
lt's a traffic signal.
You expect me to fly?

189
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:19,542
The cop is standing right there.

190
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:25,154
Bittoo ... have you lost it?

191
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,111
Hello ...

192
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:56,980
you remember?

193
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,448
Me?

194
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,251
Riff-raff.

195
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:02,452
What do you want?

196
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,520
Nothing ... just ... for you ...

197
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,904
it's a DVD of the dancing night.
Only your dance is on it.

198
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,265
Are you hitting on me?

199
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,872
Don't even try it ...

200
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,410
l don't have time for
love and rubbish like that.

201
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:20,412
Even l don't have
time to flirt and all!

202
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,944
l am here just for the DVD
and for some friendship.

203
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,150
Ok. Cool ...

204
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:37,224
l edited it with my own hands.

205
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:40,891
l suggest you send it to lndian
ldol ... you will win for sure ...

206
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,168
and then the Bollywood
heroines will be out.

207
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,963
lndian ldol, my foot.
l am going to start my own business.

208
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,302
Once the exams end ... it begins.

209
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,433
What business?

210
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,037
What sort of business is that?

211
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,279
Weddings require so many things.

212
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:01,044
Tents, decorations, musical bands,
catering, etc, etc ...

213
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:04,587
Who arranges all of that?
Wedding planners.

214
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:09,357
l want to be the best wedding
planner in Delhi ... no ... in lndia.

215
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:10,553
Good.

216
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,564
Good? lt's the best business.

217
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:17,168
lf a Bollywood heroine's
films flop, she is out ...

218
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:20,467
but be it recession or inflation,
people will always get married.

219
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,940
Thousands and millions of rupees
will always be spent on weddings ...

220
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,934
and who will be required
for the entire planning?

221
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,603
A wedding planner.

222
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,607
Yes! l have planned everything.

223
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,475
Come l'll show you ...

224
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:38,947
This is my company's
name: Shaadi Mubarak.

225
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,084
Very good ...

226
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,218
lsn't it?

227
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,286
l already have 3 years of
part-time work experience ...

228
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:45,455
with Anu Aunty.

229
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,296
Whatever salary l get, l
give half to the home.

230
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,426
My father works for the government.

231
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:51,629
The rest is my own savings.

232
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:53,035
To start my new company.

233
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,041
There are various themes
in the market these days ...

234
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:57,268
like the fairy tale theme ...

235
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,140
prince-princess theme, Barbie
theme, magic theme, circus theme ...

236
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,040
So is the groom a
joker or a ring-master ?

237
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,987
Get lost ... you waste your
time loafing about and ...

238
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,047
when someone else plans something,
you laugh at them.

239
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,656
Can't even pronounce
business properly.

240
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,004
lt's my dance ...

241
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,001
Well l don't expect
you to thank me ...

242
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,372
buy me a bread pakora at least.

243
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,172
l have a lot of studying right
now ... let's meet after the exams.

244
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,576
OK, bye.

245
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,451
What a waste of time!

246
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,374
Exams over! Shaadi Mubarak!

247
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:10,173
You are back again?

248
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,584
l've travelled all
the way from Ambala

249
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,051
with the best proposal for you ...

250
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,247
and you are showing attitude!

251
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:18,654
l said Shruti will be
livid when she arrives ...

252
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:20,055
but your father said ...

253
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,684
let's see the proposal now
that aunty has come so far.

254
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:24,594
My child, you've been working
with Anu Aunty for three years ...

255
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:26,359
it's time to relax and get married.

256
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,798
After that you can start
your wedding business.

257
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,063
After the marriage the
in-laws will be after me ...

258
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:33,264
for grandchildren ...

259
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,570
and the husband's mouth
will be locked forever.

260
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,076
Within a year there will be a
child, and then soon the next one ...

261
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,202
and then l just sit at home ...

262
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,075
being a mother all my life.

263
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,807
l will get married to
whoever you like ...

264
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,581
but after Shaadi Mubarak is set up.

265
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:48,586
Look, l am 20 years old now.

266
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:50,087
Give me time, five years, and
when l am 25 marry me off ...

267
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,647
with or without Shaadi Mubarak.

268
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:55,752
Had tea?

269
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,153
Now get lost.

270
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:01,427
Please ask Manoj if he
can wait for five years.

271
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,264
lf not then best of luck.

272
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,140
No dude! Don't go.

273
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,471
OK, don't be sad. Keep the shirt.

274
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:14,111
Come on, l am not so evil.

275
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,342
l am sad because you are leaving,
not for these clothes.

276
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,515
What will you do with an MBA?

277
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:24,122
Whether you pass or fail ...

278
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,124
you will still have to
return to your father's farm ...

279
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,591
and chop sugarcanes with him.

280
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,184
But l have to make my own life.

281
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,657
You want to do an MBA?
- Yes.

282
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:32,789
Then do it ...

283
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,127
don't lecture me.

284
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,425
Where is your suitcase?

285
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:38,261
Hello, uncle.

286
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:39,463
Hello, son.

287
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:40,596
What suitcase?

288
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,135
Didn't your mother tell you that ...

289
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,336
we are in town to take the
delivery of the new tractor ...

290
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:46,810
and will take you
with us on the way back?

291
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,147
Should l remember the
exam answers or Mom's talk?

292
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,144
Sonu! Pack his bags.

293
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,276
Me?

294
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,480
He will do it ... come with me
l'll show you ... come outside.

295
00:17:58,224 --> 00:17:59,282
Come.

296
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,553
Look at that.

297
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:05,822
ls it not the best colour?

298
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,900
We will all go back
home on this lean machine.

299
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,297
l can't come.

300
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:16,469
Why? Have you set up a shop?

301
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,600
Yes ...

302
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,569
No ...

303
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,915
not a shop... a business.

304
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:26,776
Business?

305
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:27,910
What do you sell?

306
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,312
We don't sell ...

307
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,246
we organise weddings.

308
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,849
Wedding planning.

309
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,486
Barbers organise weddings.

310
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:36,619
ln small towns like Saharanpur ...

311
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,185
in Delhi it's a big business.

312
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,829
Be it recession or inflation
people will still get married.

313
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,595
People invest millions in weddings.

314
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:45,202
100 percent profit ...

315
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:46,630
Oh silly ...

316
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,707
Our boys don't do girls' jobs.

317
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:53,211
Now that your curiosity
about college is over ...

318
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,271
come home and manage the farm,
like everyone else.

319
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,745
l'll kill myself but l
won't chop sugar canes.

320
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,219
No one can die jumping
off the first floor ...

321
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:04,654
you're good at nothing,
neither suicide nor business.

322
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,349
And listen ...

323
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,359
once the sugarcane catches blight,
it's cut off and thrown away.

324
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:10,819
You are a cane with blight.

325
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:12,830
You are no good to me now.

326
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:18,233
When you run out of
money then catch a bus home.

327
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,364
This is the fare ...

328
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,232
don't spend it.

329
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:26,836
Come on, Sonu.

330
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,305
You ...

331
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,648
So Mr. Blighted Cane ...

332
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:39,782
what're you going to do now?

333
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,259
Dude, while bullshitting to dad,
l hit upon a brilliant idea.

334
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,324
l am gonna make a
partnership with miss Janak Puri.

335
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:45,990
You want to be a wedding planner?

336
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,260
l thought you were just
deflecting your father.

337
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,392
Why? What's the problem?

338
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,861
The turn over is in thousands,
recession or inflation.

339
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:54,405
Shruti Kakkar will kill you.

340
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,270
Only if l hit on her.

341
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,605
l am not interested in her
and nor is she in me ...

342
00:19:58,677 --> 00:19:59,939
a partnership is
all l am asking for.

343
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,536
Shaadi Mubarak is her idea ...

344
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:03,673
why will she make you her partner?

345
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:04,943
Why won't she?

346
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,348
You think she won't?

347
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:19,689
Laugh freely,

348
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:20,857
or don't laugh at all,

349
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,298
what sort of a laugh is that?

350
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,429
Did you smell the perfume?

351
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:27,563
lt's horrible ...

352
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:29,899
they bathe in it ...

353
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,909
if you sit next to them you
can't enjoy the smell of the bread.

354
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,347
But your business idea ...

355
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,475
it's great ...

356
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:40,712
Shaadi Mubarak.

357
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,445
When are you starting?

358
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:43,579
lt's started.

359
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,484
l have to reach Chanda
Narang's office in an hour.

360
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:46,684
Her son's wedding?

361
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,919
Oh no ...

362
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:51,056
Chanda Narang is the superstar, like
Sharukh Khan, of wedding planning.

363
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:52,926
l'll train with her for
some time and then ...

364
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,056
my own company.

365
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,391
Well ...

366
00:20:57,336 --> 00:21:01,363
l too have a
brilliant business plan.

367
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,073
lt's a bit complicated though.

368
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,736
First this and then that ...

369
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,880
so l was wondering, till
mine comes in line ...

370
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,711
why don't l join your
Shaadi Mubarak as a partner?

371
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,975
l don't want any
partnership complications.

372
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:14,349
Such a big business ...
turnover of thousands ...

373
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,752
how will you run it by yourself?

374
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,551
l have handled so
many weddings on my own.

375
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:24,560
l don't have any
business idea, dude.

376
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:26,756
l know.

377
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:29,357
lf l don't find a job
or business here ...

378
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,029
then my dad will take me back
to the village to chop canes.

379
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,104
Please save me from the sugarcane.

380
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:35,765
Please make me your partner.

381
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:36,899
No.

382
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,373
You just bring all
the brilliant ideas ...

383
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,503
and leave the running around to me.

384
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:46,009
l spent all night making
the DVD. You are my friend.

385
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,418
Today you say friend,
tomorrow you will say l love you.

386
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:51,923
l don't want any
emotional complication.

387
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:53,615
l just want to start
my business that's all.

388
00:21:53,692 --> 00:22:00,894
Thumb rule of business - love and
business do not go hand in hand.

389
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,831
l am best on my own.

390
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:05,402
What are you talking about?

391
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,666
l promise l will never
go beyond friendship.

392
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,798
What's the guarantee?

393
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:10,666
Fine!

394
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:11,801
l swear on this bread.

395
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,003
No ...

396
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:16,472
bye!

397
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:21,419
OK, if not a partner, a secretary,
assistant, peon - make me anything.

398
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:22,880
At least listen to me.

399
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:30,519
Moonstruck.

400
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:31,821
Chanda Maam's company.

401
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:34,592
One day even Shruti
Kakkar's Shaadi Mubarak tempos ...

402
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,758
will arrive in
these posh farm houses.

403
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,893
Shruti Kakkar and Bittoo Sharma ...

404
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,496
l told you, no partnership,
now stop following me.

405
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:45,433
But you already have
trained under Anu Aunty ...

406
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:47,542
Anu Aunty does low
budget weddings ...

407
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,807
small community hall types, with
grooms arriving in small cars.

408
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,011
Chanda Narang does
massive farm weddings ...

409
00:22:55,454 --> 00:22:56,819
where the grooms arrive in choppers.

410
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,557
An investment of a few
million is no big deal.

411
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,187
A wedding planner's commission
is at least 15 million Rupees.

412
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:03,519
15 million Rupees!

413
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:04,687
Of course ... these
are the weddings ...

414
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:05,821
that superstar
Shahrukh Khan dances at ...

415
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:07,195
and Chanda Maam organises them.

416
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:11,458
l'll learn a lot and be high
class if l work with Chanda Maam.

417
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:17,666
Chanda Maam!

418
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:20,536
Ya, tell me ...

419
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:24,777
You wait here ...

420
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:25,941
Me too ...

421
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:38,655
Maam, l am a huge fan of yours.

422
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:40,597
Maam, you are too good ...

423
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,499
you are my inspiration.

424
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,095
Please let me assist you.

425
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,495
Please just have a look at my file.

426
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,898
Maam, l've ...

427
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:57,147
Maam, l am a fan. Let go. l can
do any sort of work. Please, Maam.

428
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,243
Yes Diwakar ...

429
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,581
Who? Yes, tell me ...

430
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,087
Get off. Don't show off
in your stupid uniform.

431
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,852
l can work better than you.

432
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:07,983
Please leave.

433
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:12,962
When will they
discharge him? Oh dear ...

434
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,199
Why do they enter this profession
if they have to get jaundice!

435
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,058
Now who will do his duty?

436
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,728
l'm leaving.

437
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:20,930
What's the problem?

438
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:22,539
You can't stay here.

439
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:29,840
No. l will work only
with her. Not alone.

440
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,779
But l have place only for
one person...

441
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,909
and a girl can't handle it.

442
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,077
She?

443
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,212
Girl?

444
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,550
Only from the outside ...

445
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,984
there are ten
bouncers hidden inside her!

446
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,924
Look, l can pay a
salary for one person only.

447
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,191
So then Bittoo comes
free at the price of Shruti.

448
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,897
Are you two ...
boyfriend-girlfriend?

449
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:54,064
Not at all ... just
partners ... guaranteed!

450
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,836
Thank you, Maamji ... thank you ...

451
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:12,586
Each chandelier was
supposed to have four circles ...

452
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:14,751
why have you put only one, Maqsood?

453
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,330
How long have you been working here?

454
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,589
Only five days old, and you
have been around for years ...

455
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:22,725
but don't think you can fool me.

456
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,062
lf you don't make four circles
l'll complain to Chanda Maam.

457
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:27,796
Go ahead!

458
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,901
Your Chanda Maam would have
charged the client for 50 circles ...

459
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,239
but l have been paid only for one.

460
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,275
You've to put three
over there at the back ...

461
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,611
Chanda Maam?

462
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,790
flower shower from above.

463
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,729
The wedding planner promised red
roses for my niece's wedding ...

464
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,362
but eventually there
was a marigold shower.

465
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:08,077
you relax ... you like red
roses ... you get red roses.

466
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,273
Maam, the catering
guys are asking for you.

467
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:14,043
Chill!

468
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,688
Who will get the work done,
if l keep giving them demos?

469
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:24,393
Thanks, buddy you saved me ...

470
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,690
Why starve ... have biskut!

471
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,703
What sort of people
are you dealing with ...

472
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,104
they expect roast chicken
at the price of dried grass?

473
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,729
Even her abuses sound sweet,
like FM radio.

474
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:05,894
Oye Radio? Do you know what a
big cheat your Madam really is?

475
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:09,268
She delivers only half
of what she charges for.

476
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,307
That's why she drives a BMW.

477
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:13,071
She is so clever.

478
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:16,044
lt's not clever, it's cheating.

479
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:18,082
Not cheating, it's business sense.

480
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,083
lt will never happen in my company.

481
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,085
OK, we won't cheat.

482
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,151
Bittoo!
- Yes, Maam!

483
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:34,796
Boss or employee ...

484
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:37,060
he doesn't spare anyone.

485
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:54,816
Are you trying to cheat me?
Where are the lilies?

486
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,412
Sir?

487
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,353
There is no
arrangement of any flowers ...

488
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:02,917
Due to the drivers' strike,
the delivered stock is less.

489
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:15,970
The arrangement my wife
approved had lilies ...

490
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:17,769
all we have are carnations ...

491
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:24,381
Maam ... that ...
- What that?!

492
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,111
There were no lilies.

493
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,512
Why? Why were there no lilies?

494
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:38,987
Maam ...

495
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:40,956
enough is enough.

496
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:43,796
We are out of this.

497
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,869
No one can stay after this insult.

498
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:47,463
Come on, Shruti!

499
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,168
Yes, l know, big-shot army man,

500
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:52,332
doesn't mean you can
abuse in English ...

501
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:54,001
you know very well
whose fault it is ...

502
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:57,411
don't stretch it so much that we
are forced to expose. - Expose what?

503
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:59,313
Bittoo, this will get us a bad
reputation. Think of the future.

504
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:00,442
lt is the future ...

505
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,551
your Shaadi Mubarak.

506
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:16,892
Come on partner.

507
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:26,138
Will get the uniform sent.
Keep the cap. Dupe someone else.

508
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,308
See you around in the market.

509
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:47,161
Nice name ... Shaadi Mubarak.

510
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:49,867
But in our families
traditionally uncles ...

511
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,062
and aunties get together
and organise the wedding.

512
00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:54,231
What will we do with
a wedding planner?

513
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,100
See l told you so ...
thank you, uncle.

514
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:00,443
How much money do you
intend spending on the wedding?

515
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,009
200 thousand. 0r 250
thousand Rupees maximum.

516
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:04,910
You spend 250 thousand only ...

517
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,512
and leave the arrangements to us.

518
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:09,945
Where's the venue?

519
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,020
Venue? Same one as where the rest
of the colony gets married from!

520
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,326
Here it is ... our
first wedding site.

521
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:28,902
Let's inspect the site.

522
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,436
Why are we dealing
with these small-timers?

523
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:33,638
They don't even have cars.

524
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:35,409
Their groom will
arrive on a scooter!

525
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:38,278
Let's directly
attack the farm houses.

526
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:41,178
Let's become prince of
smaller budget weddings ...

527
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:45,078
and then become King and
Queen of the farmhouses.

528
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,587
There is lesser risk here.

529
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,592
Things are bound to go wrong
in the first few weddings!

530
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,487
lt's our area, we can smile,
apologise and get away with it.

531
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:52,654
What can be done for 250 thousand?

532
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:55,557
That's the challenge. 250 thousand.

533
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:58,228
Let's see how much your brain works.

534
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:01,567
Really! Now you watch out.

535
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,267
All this is possible in our lane?

536
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:33,001
Anything's possible
with Shaadi Mubarak.

537
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:42,605
Bands Horns and Revelry

538
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:45,979
Bands Horns and Revelry

539
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,988
l say, l say

540
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,456
l will plan weddings ...

541
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:54,992
l will make the altars ...

542
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,584
l will do the dances.

543
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:01,192
Bands Horns and Revelry ...

544
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:10,004
Bands Horns and Revelry ...

545
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:11,133
Which one?

546
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,587
Quick, quick, hurry up. The
lights have to be tested ...

547
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,027
Have you stolen the
connection from the pole?

548
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:38,399
So? Should l pull
it from your house?

549
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:39,561
Cut the line now ... cut it!

550
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:40,696
Why?

551
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,036
l told you ... no
cheating in Shaadi Mubarak!

552
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:44,769
A generator and
diesel will cost 15,000.

553
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:49,776
Doesn't matter, but no cheating. Just
cut it or else l'll call your office.

554
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:56,588
Bands Horns and Revelry

555
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:05,586
The beautician's cost is included in
the budget. Don't worry. ls this OK?

556
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:09,529
Send the van back after off-loading.

557
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,593
Bring the stuff here ...
and keep it carefully.

558
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,104
Don't trample the flowers,
they should look fresh.

559
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:17,132
Did you call him?

560
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,266
Yes ... why?

561
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,143
Shaadi Mubarak's first
wedding without Maqsood's flowers?

562
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,078
Maqsood, we are on a small budget.

563
00:33:24,316 --> 00:33:26,079
But you are a big person

564
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:30,077
in the brigadier's wedding the
fault was all Chanda's and mine ...

565
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,813
but you took the blame ...

566
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:35,192
don't worry about the budget,
tell me who is doing the catering.

567
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:36,585
l've spoken to Bansal.

568
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:41,359
Remember one thing ... what do
guests enjoy most in a wedding?

569
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,525
Food!

570
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,464
Lighting and decoration
will be all forgotten ...

571
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:49,096
Bansal will serve
rubbish and charge double.

572
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,208
Rajinder is our man ...

573
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:55,407
he has a small
restaurant in Trilokpuri ...

574
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:57,474
and makes the best food.

575
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:00,548
He has been trying to get
into catering for years ...

576
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,780
Here, talk to him.

577
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,719
Oh no ... no first-timer.

578
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:05,847
What if he screws up?

579
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,656
You are doing it for
the first time as well.

580
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,323
Hello, Mr Rajinder!

581
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,299
Why are you dealing
with these planners?

582
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:25,775
l would have
arranged for better food.

583
00:34:25,877 --> 00:34:27,742
What are you saying?
lt's great food.

584
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:29,336
The arrangements are brilliant,

585
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:31,347
how much have these
Shaadi Mubarak people charged?

586
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,680
Depends on your budget.
We have paid 250 thousand.

587
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:36,514
That's it? 500 thousand was
spent on Monty's wedding ...

588
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:38,152
and yet the food was stale.

589
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,893
Don't worry, it's a gift.

590
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:45,887
Something is missing.

591
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,161
You've converted this
lane into the Taj Mahal ...

592
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,530
now you want to
bring a helicopter down?

593
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:51,660
DJ!

594
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,660
Bhutani uncle has not
accounted for a DJ in the budget.

595
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:54,796
So what if it's not in the budget?
Pass me the phone ...

596
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,168
Will we pay for it?

597
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,299
l'm calling Santy ...

598
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,370
Your college band will perform here?

599
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:00,706
Just watch out ...
- Shruti ...

600
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,280
Papa, Mummy! How does it all look?

601
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,539
Very good.

602
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,580
Look, our daughter
has done it after all.

603
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,244
Not me alone ... this is
Bittoo ... a partner in the company.

604
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,515
Hello, aunty.
- Hello ... what's your name?

605
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:14,324
Mummy ... we have lots of work to do,
you carry on and take a look inside.

606
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:15,723
l was only asking his name...

607
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,785
Bittoo Sharma ... with a double O.

608
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,855
Raju? ls the generator on?
- Yes, Bittoo ...

609
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,195
So turn the lights on then!

610
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:27,501
Santy ... where is your team now?

611
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:30,934
Hurry up and grab a
cab ... there's a gig.

612
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:39,650
Colourful dreams ...

613
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:43,414
quirky schemes.

614
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:47,953
lt's free publicity, dude ...

615
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:49,784
your first live show.

616
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,759
Put the video on Youtube ...

617
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:53,957
all of you will be stars,

618
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,558
and will get free food too!

619
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,231
First time ...

620
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:15,010


621
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,566
Your dark and cunning eyes ...

622
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,006
are not too shy ...

623
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:41,302
they look sly, very hi-fi.

624
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:44,279
Making my heart skip a beat ...

625
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:47,647
l wonder why?

626
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:55,017
Your dark and cunning eyes ...

627
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:56,726
are not too shy ...

628
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:59,956
They look sly, very hi-fi.

629
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,727
Making my heart skip a beat ...

630
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,826
l wonder why?

631
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:11,398
Just like a biscuit dipped in tea.

632
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,803
That's how my life
has turned out to be.

633
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,814
This is how l have lost out to me.

634
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,908
That's how my life
has turned out to be.

635
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:24,853
This is how l have lost out to me.

636
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:39,769
Step away, stay away you loser ...

637
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:40,929
and stop following me.

638
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,870
l know your sort.

639
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:44,431
You will see ...

640
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:48,979
my shoe on your head it will be!

641
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,450
A Romeo without Juliet ...
a lock without a key.

642
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,018
That's how your life
has turned out to be.

643
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,853
And this is how
you've lost out to me.

644
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,019
That's how your life,
has turned out to be.

645
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:07,724
And this is how
you've lost out to me.

646
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:38,387
l flexed my muscles,
and l gelled my hair.

647
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:41,397
And yet you walked past me ...

648
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:44,593
with your nose held
up high in the air.

649
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:50,669
You can't impress ...

650
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,609
with your muscles
and gelled hair ...

651
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:56,839
because it's your cunning heart ...

652
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:59,712
that needs repair.

653
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:05,584
Just like the honey attracts a bee.

654
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:08,817
That's how your life
has turned out to be.

655
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:11,726
And this is how
you've lost out to me.

656
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,821
That's how my life,
has turned out to be.

657
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:18,801
This is how l have lost out to me.

658
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,092
Below my window, why do you wait?

659
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:55,468
Playing tricks that are down-market.

660
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,533
Whistling dirty songs ...

661
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,578
why do you irritate?

662
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:07,611
Cut your attitude,
and agree with me.

663
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:10,846
You want a blank cheque,
or the life within me?

664
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:13,720
Soften your heart,
and you will see ...

665
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:16,692
l am cool and confident.
Just look at me!

666
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:22,232
You've knocked me down,
like a bumble bee.

667
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,659
That's how my life
has turned out to be.

668
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:28,706
This is how l have lost out to me.

669
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:31,832
That's how your life
has turned out to be.

670
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:35,037
And this is how
you've lost out to me.

671
00:40:35,113 --> 00:40:37,980
That's how my life
has turned out to be.

672
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:42,042
This is how l have lost out to me.

673
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:58,726
Hey ...

674
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,601
This shop was trashed! Yes l've called
for them ... l'll call you back.

675
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:03,901
How many mirrors are inside?

676
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:05,566
All done? Two more?

677
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:06,734
What the hell are you guys doing?

678
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:07,869
Who will pick this up?

679
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:10,072
The furniture is second hand,
but paid for nonetheless.

680
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:11,206
l know it's not new.

681
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:12,977
lt has to be kept here.

682
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:14,914
No ... l'll sit here.

683
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:16,715
Shut up ... why
don't you want that area?

684
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:19,083
Forget the Qutub Minar.
Come up and help me.

685
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:20,215
Do it yourself.

686
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,283
Your shop downstairs ...
my house upstairs.

687
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,859
Am l your secretary?
To do all your work?

688
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:29,225
l'm putting your box on top of
this ... lie down and watch TV

689
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,235
Let's push your bed towards the
corner ... open the window ...

690
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:36,572
Home sweet home!

691
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,700
lt'll be great fun!

692
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:44,672
ldeas ...

693
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:48,582
Plans ...

694
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:52,850
Come on, let's have tea.

695
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,750
Oh, you are here?

696
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,020
How are you today?

697
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:26,618
ldeas ...

698
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:28,723
Plans ...

699
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,994
Schemes.

700
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:12,894
Whose side are these people from?

701
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,865
They look like
riff-raff from my hostel.

702
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:18,169
Let them be ... how much
can they possibly eat?

703
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:22,407
Five extra plates, that's 1,500
rupees. Who will pay for them?

704
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:24,839
Take it from my share.

705
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:28,112
l suggest you set up a
soup-kitchen for all the riff-raff.

706
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:40,695
The groom's party will leave in 3 hours
so l am staying back at the office.

707
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:42,992
Please tell dad. See
you the day after.

708
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,911
What are you doing,
Bittoo? You will drop me.

709
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:00,404
l am not in the office, and l have
left the calendar in the office.

710
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:02,775
Tell the priest August
won't be possible ...

711
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:04,941
look for an
auspicious date in November.

712
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,423
Hello Shaadi Mubarak.
- hello Shaadi Mubarak.

713
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:23,830
How can we cancel
someone else's booking for you?

714
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:29,838
No, dude ... not possible at all.
My calendar is full ...

715
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:35,003
Schemes.

716
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,146
ldeas, Plans, Schemes.

717
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:48,816
Which package would you like?

718
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:49,917
Platinum, Gold or Silver?

719
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:53,055
No, that's in the Platinum package.

720
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,256
The henna ceremony is not
included in the Gold package.

721
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:58,927
Obviously, it's just the
wedding in the Silver one.

722
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:04,101
Yes there is a Bronze as well ...
for funerals! You'd like one?

723
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:06,575
Hello ... you've
completely vanished, Mr. Dhawan ...

724
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:13,582
if there was a margin l
would never have asked you.

725
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:16,144
lf there is no advance then
the wedding will not be ...

726
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,278
What are you doing?

727
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:18,412
Having lunch.

728
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:19,854
What if the buffalo
doesn't pay the advance?

729
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:21,221
So, will starving
make him pay any faster?

730
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:22,917
Return my phone ...

731
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:25,188
You haven't had a
biscuit since this morning.

732
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:28,461
Even if it's 10 minutes later
you can still convince the buffalo.

733
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,864
You'll turn me into a glutton.

734
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:38,200
OK listen, we've
planned 26 weddings so far.

735
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:40,101
What's the plan for the future?

736
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:42,869
Another three years ...
and then marriage ...

737
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:45,877
two children. My agreed deadline with
my parents is till l turn 25 ...

738
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:48,549
till then they can look
for a good groom for me ...

739
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:50,545
their choice would be the best.

740
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:53,886
Mrs. Kakkar, l'm not
talking about that future.

741
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:56,960
The company's future! Our future!

742
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:00,059
We are Kings and
Queens of local weddings ...

743
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:02,555
when will we hit the farmhouses?

744
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,035
Not now. We need to
increase our scale for that ...

745
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:08,631
step by step ... pass me the sauce.

746
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:17,640
Will you have an arranged one?

747
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:21,243
What else? l don't want any
silly 'love-complications'.

748
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:23,211
Don't worry,

749
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:25,255
l don't think you will ever
have that kind of complication.

750
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:27,550
Nobody will want to go
blind by looking at you.

751
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:30,651
Oh yeah?

752
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:34,659
So who was up all
night making a DVD?

753
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:41,227
And you hashed the
entire romance ...

754
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,236
l was left wondering if this
was a girl or a warrior princess.

755
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:46,940
Dude, if it weren't for
the warrior princess ...

756
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:48,945
you'd not be
devouring these noodles.

757
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,944
You'd be chopping sugar
canes on your dad's farm.

758
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,942
Oh yeah! Had it not been for me ...

759
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:55,679
your Shaadi Mubarak
would've never taken off ...

760
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:58,221
and you'd still be running
around in circles after Chanda.

761
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,280
Started the business? My foot!

762
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:02,283
l started it.

763
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,618
Did l not?

764
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:05,127
Say l did ...

765
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:06,554
Stop bragging ...

766
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:09,023
and return my phone, l need to
get money out of the buffalo.

767
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:15,336
These thieves will always fleece us.

768
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:18,965
lt's time for a high
jump to the farms!

769
00:48:20,511 --> 00:48:21,978
Farms again?

770
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:23,439
How will we get there?

771
00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:25,106
How will we get the contacts?

772
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,240
Just say yes!

773
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:29,214
Yes! l've said it. Now?

774
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:51,399
What is she saying?
Can't hear a word.

775
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:54,375
Why worry? We know
what she's hammering on about!

776
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:55,671
Drop the English!

777
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:04,549
Bittoo ... let's go.

778
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:07,554
Five minutes. Be back.

779
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,030
Pankaj, Sir ... Sonya, Maam ...

780
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:17,761
Hello ... Shaadi Mubarak.

781
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:24,040
No ... and yes. No in person.
Yes on Facebook.

782
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:27,043
Wedding ... You two ...
Planning. Us two!

783
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:31,411
Your number is on here?

784
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:35,244
Why waste a call ...
we can walk and talk.

785
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:37,211
You are going to the car,
right? We will drop you off.

786
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,048
Which theme has she roped you into?

787
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:44,057
Classic, Royal or Maharaja?

788
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,058
lt's been seen and
done a hundred times.

789
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:49,599
You will have a plain
assembly line wedding. So sad.

790
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:51,794
She doesn't have the
time to experiment.

791
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:54,594
There are three other
weddings in the same week as yours.

792
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:56,139
We are doing one
wedding at one time.

793
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:59,276
One hundred percent total dedication
to one client for six months.

794
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,334
Start to finish. No compromise,
mother-promise.

795
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:05,805
Pankaj, sir, you're handling
your father's business right now ...

796
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,677
but in your heart you're still
the same student's union president

797
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:12,812
who organised the most vibrant
college festivals for 3 years,

798
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,321
and you met sir during the
college festival, right?

799
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:18,556
You're the lead vocalist
of your college band ...

800
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:20,163
and you won an award for that too.

801
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,132
But now you are getting married in
dull, lifeless Chanda Narang style.

802
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:28,229
OK, so you've
researched us thoroughly.

803
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:32,138
l'm impressed, but l don't
know anything about you guys.

804
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:33,607
Why should we give you the contract?

805
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:38,779
Sir ... because your wedding
is not just a deal for us!

806
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:43,786
We put in our lives to make your
wedding the happiest day of your life.

807
00:50:45,122 --> 00:50:46,248
Your car is here ...

808
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,716
if you believed what we
said then please do call us.

809
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:49,850
We'll be waiting.

810
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:52,122
OK bye.

811
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,188
Let's go, Shruti.

812
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,191
What're you doing?

813
00:50:57,267 --> 00:50:58,461
There was nothing left to say ...

814
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:00,194
they were getting bored ...

815
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,328
And if they don't call?

816
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,265
We can't go back now ...

817
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:04,799
it'd be tacky.

818
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,137
Shruti Kakkar ...

819
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:08,139
Bittoo Sharma ...

820
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,143
Are you free on Sunday?

821
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:20,281
Come in please.

822
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:32,567
ldeas are promising.

823
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:35,832
Groom's entry is the best!

824
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:38,164
So prior to this you have only
worked on low budget weddings ...

825
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:40,176
say up to 1 million rupees, right?

826
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:41,836
Yes, up to 1.75 million rupees.

827
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:46,172
Both of them wear black suits and
attend board meetings all day long ...

828
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:48,183
but when it comes to their
wedding they want a kitsch one ...

829
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,186
you two are kitsch ... and
your style is so vibrant.

830
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,916
lt will need an
investment of a few million ...

831
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:56,317
but then our
reputation will be on the line,

832
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:59,727
and taking such a risk
with first timers ...

833
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,388
l am not sure.

834
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:07,661
Sir ...

835
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:10,734
a person builds his
own reputation ...

836
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,199
and ruins it himself too.

837
00:52:14,878 --> 00:52:17,210
Regarding frist-timers ...

838
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:20,876
44 years ago,

839
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:24,217
a young man wanted
to make a tyre ...

840
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:25,880
a cycle tyre ...

841
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:28,357
the man approached his
father for the investment,

842
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,653
and his father put the
money in his son's hand.

843
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,230
He didn't say, son
you are a first-timer..

844
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:36,891
..you won't be able to
handle the tyre business.

845
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:41,498
Today that young man is
seated in front of us.

846
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,434
The tyre king himself,

847
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:49,969
and l'm sure he will give us a
chance, just like his father did.

848
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,656
Hence Sainik farms have been ...

849
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:05,251
Conquered!

850
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:06,554
Ready means Ready!

851
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,688
l don't want any delays ...

852
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,994
and re-check the tensile
structure multi-lights.

853
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:13,265
Come now. All the aunties out,
please ... no ogling at girls.

854
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:14,634
Come out.

855
00:53:15,272 --> 00:53:16,933
Take it easy, there's no hurry ...

856
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:18,668
just keep a check.

857
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:20,871
Has the electrician arrived?

858
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:23,344
Please check the shrimp starters.

859
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:26,905
They have to be fresh. What
happened? Tell us, we'll do it.

860
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:29,009
The groom has arrived, go out.
Don't stress, just go.

861
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:33,915
That's why l always say
'check the list' l made.

862
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:37,292
The Groom's party has arrived,
bring on the booze.

863
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:39,488
l'll get the bar opened uncle,
and you will get the first drink.

864
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:40,621
Obviously l will.

865
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:42,591
Ok good, show me.

866
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:47,029
You look great. Didn't l
say this would look good?

867
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,295
lsn't your daughter looking pretty?

868
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:51,604
Where are you stuck?

869
00:53:51,742 --> 00:53:53,903
Teaching your own boss his business!

870
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:57,310
lf you don't arrive in half hour,
your head will be in your hands.

871
00:53:57,381 --> 00:53:58,439
Oh my ... you've not left as yet ...

872
00:53:58,515 --> 00:53:59,573
the groom's party is already here.

873
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,777
Let's go, Sonya, get
ready in 5 minutes ...

874
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:03,581
l am warning you, Pankaj
won't wait beyond that.

875
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:05,315
Hurry up and check on them, or
else no one will get ready ...

876
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:06,447
in five minutes. Get
her ready quickly.

877
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,449
Bittoo come in please.

878
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:10,855
Go, Shruti
- Bedi is ready?

879
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:12,589
Completely ready.
- The priest's equipment?

880
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:13,721
All set.
- OK.

881
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:16,064
You've opened the foreign champagne?

882
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:18,459
What do you mean yes?

883
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:20,366
l told you ... you
guys ... ruined it.

884
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,928
Always serve with a smile,

885
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:25,600
so that even a person who's
not hungry feels like eating.

886
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:28,338
They've been doing this
job for about 7 years ...

887
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:29,572
they know their job by now ...

888
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:30,738
you hurry up and
attend to the guests.

889
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:31,872
Even then, l need
to say it just once.

890
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:33,348
l'll take over this side.

891
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:34,509
The garlanding
ceremony is about to begin ...

892
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:37,019
this is a revolving stage...
co-ordinate with Kirti ...

893
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:39,885
the stage rotates and
your song crossfades.

894
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:50,362
Bittoo, it's about to begin.

895
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:53,562
The relatives have been given rose
petals and loads of confetti, right?

896
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:55,366
Loads and loads.
- The flower-shower must not stop.

897
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:57,771
Yes, yes ... full throttle ...
high power ... you don't worry.

898
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:00,634
So you are Shaadi
Mubarak ... good job.

899
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:05,372
Contact us for any wedding.
- Sure.

900
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:06,507
Anytime. Enjoy.

901
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,584
lsn't she looking great?
- Very nice.

902
00:55:14,658 --> 00:55:16,626
l made her select that outfit.
- She is looking hot.

903
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:17,819
Shruti maam, Bittoo sir.

904
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:19,119
Ya go ...

905
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:20,493
The motor is not working,
the stage is not rotating.

906
00:55:20,631 --> 00:55:21,689
What?

907
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:23,057
We are coming.

908
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:31,406
lt won't grip.
- What's going on?

909
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:32,942
lt's not gripping it.
- Leave it.

910
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,477
Bittoo l told you to check it.

911
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:35,875
l checked it at four.

912
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:40,576
lt's about to start, Bittoo.

913
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:43,711
Do something.

914
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:44,845
l am doing something.

915
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:47,481
Look, try it now.

916
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:50,086
lt's not working. Do it ...

917
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:32,860
Bittoo.

918
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:34,194
Shruti.

919
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:35,563
We did it, buddy.

920
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:37,201
This is just the beginning.

921
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:39,465
We have to plan
much bigger weddings.

922
00:56:40,877 --> 00:56:42,606
This big is good enough for me.

923
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:45,639
Bigger than this!

924
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,812
So? Shaadi Mubarak.

925
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:53,081
When money leaves your pocket,
it's always a problem.

926
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:57,483
Take this ... full and
final for the musical night,

927
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,858
cocktails and the wedding.

928
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:01,622
Thank you, sir.

929
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:05,496
Well done, Shaadi Mubarak!

930
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:07,727
Keep it up! - Thank you so much,
sir ... thank you.

931
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:11,506
How much of this will be mine?

932
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:15,534
After all the payments, we have 6
million Rupees left of the 20 million.

933
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:16,670
Three yours and three mine.

934
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:18,240
No, 1 1/2 and 1 1/2
and the left over ...

935
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:19,509
3 million goes to our
business development.

936
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:20,641
Come on, it should be
two and two at least.

937
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:21,775
No, 1 1/2.

938
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,819
This seems less. Ten
million has eight zeros.

939
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,722
No, silly, seven!

940
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:08,758
Which one should l play? Which one?

941
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,566
Ya? This one?

942
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:17,570
OK, guys ... l'm off.

943
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,800
No, no, no, no.
- Nobody moves.

944
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:23,243
This man speaks the truth!
- Children, my bones are crumbling.

945
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:25,110
l've lost 200 grams already.

946
00:58:25,182 --> 00:58:29,118
That's obvious. l hope you
guys work hard like this ...

947
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:33,249
God give you prosperity and us too.

948
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:34,847
Oh, so they do all the hard work ...

949
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:37,587
and you enjoy the incentives,
just like that ...

950
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:38,821
Should we go now?
- Ok see you later... let's go.

951
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:39,953
OK ... then good night.

952
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,088
OK.

953
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:43,724
Bye ... bye ... bye ...

954
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:55,940
Play that one ... ya.

955
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,652
No, let me rest.

956
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:00,334
Let me rest.

957
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,701
Bittoo ...

958
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:47,442
Can you please drop me home?

959
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:50,446
Yes, of course ...

960
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,920
Tea?
- Should l make it?

961
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,256
Would you like some, dear?

962
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,387
Dear?

963
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:01,855
don't bother ...

964
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,262
you won't know where
the jars are kept.

965
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,664
Please go and get changed, dear.

966
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:09,996
Dear?

967
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,552
Shall we leave?

968
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:33,687
Let's go.

969
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,354
Oh, you're here?

970
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,026
How was the
farmhouse wedding last night?

971
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,620
Everything went well?

972
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:41,891
Superb. Top class ...

973
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:44,365
Oh Shaadi Mubarak's work
is always 'top class'.

974
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:49,371
l'll miss my bus, let's
chat in the evening. OK? Bye.

975
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:50,964
Bye ...

976
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:55,835
Breakfast?

977
01:06:55,912 --> 01:06:56,970
Uncle ...

978
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,104
l'll drop uncle ...

979
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,384
come on, uncle,
l'll drop you fast ...

980
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,589
you can sit sideways uncle ...

981
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,651
OK, go, go.

982
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:28,135
So Mr. Celebrity!

983
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,810
Refuse to recognise me?

984
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,876
Dude, Mikka ...

985
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,475
no mails, no SMS ...
where have you been?

986
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:37,014
lt's been a month
since l shifted to Delhi,

987
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,747
but you're such a big star ...

988
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,015
changed your mail lD,
number ... everything.

989
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,420
Shut up!
- Look.

990
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,615
No way!

991
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,160
l have a friend in The Times and got
your number through him finally ...

992
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:50,699
page three, not bad!
Bittoo Sharma, Shruti Kakkar!

993
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,493
l'll tell Shruti. She
wouldn't have read it.

994
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,914
l guess she'll read it
when she comes to the office.

995
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,508
What's the problem?

996
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:09,909
Why you so roughed-up?

997
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:11,044
No, l am not.

998
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,781
ln bold letters it says ...

999
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,457
That means she would've seen it too.

1000
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:17,717
Who?

1001
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,463
What's up? Singing songs today?

1002
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:26,726
What nonsense?

1003
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,065
Didn't l ever sing before?

1004
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,937
Before, Shruti always
addressed me casually ...

1005
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,076
but since this morning she
has started calling me 'dear'.

1006
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,136
You know she made tea
for me in the morning.

1007
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,206
Terrible tea!

1008
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,480
But first time, made it herself!

1009
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:47,546
Now you see why l am so screwed up?

1010
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,022
What do you think of this, Bittoo?

1011
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,752
He is the way he is!

1012
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,962
Why? Has he sprouted wings suddenly?

1013
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,495
Yes, he has sprouted wings!

1014
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,833
Our small town boy
has become a big man.

1015
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:05,501
l think you have sprouted wings!

1016
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:09,905
This is the first time
you have praised Bittoo!

1017
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,177
l am totally screwed, man!

1018
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,185
Screwed? What do you mean?

1019
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,511
You chased her for so long ...

1020
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:21,648
and now that you guys have
finally hitched up, you are crying!

1021
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,783
She is not the 'hitched' type,
she is the emotional type.

1022
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:26,528
She thinks whatever has
happened between us is love.

1023
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,192
Now you can't love the
person you're doing business with!

1024
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,528
What?!

1025
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:32,727
lt's a business rule,
you won't get it, dude.

1026
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,733
Had it been someone else l would
have finished it in a second ...

1027
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:39,666
but Shruti's feelings will be hurt.

1028
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:41,675
l can't hurt her.

1029
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,541
She gave me work ...

1030
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,543
made a man out of me ...

1031
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,742
Right ... you are quite screwed.

1032
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,145
Yes!

1033
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:53,813
She is my friend, dude!

1034
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,217
He is just a friend Ma!

1035
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,555
So can't one marry a friend?

1036
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,551
Where did marriage come from?

1037
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:02,962
You're the one
building flyovers of Bittoo.

1038
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:04,960
l thought you changed your mind.

1039
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,566
l was just saying that
all men are not alike.

1040
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:10,897
Now let's take Bittoo,
for example ...

1041
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,572
he makes tea, does kitchen work,

1042
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,246
l think he will even allow his
wife to work after marriage.

1043
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,309
How do l look?

1044
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,655
Oh ho, ruined my hair.

1045
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,783
Doesn't matter.

1046
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,118
Leave it now.

1047
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:42,529


1048
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:13,965
l feel a new sensation,

1049
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:19,099
l feel you next to me.

1050
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:24,977
The colours of
yesterday are changing,

1051
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:30,986
into brighter shades of tomorrow.

1052
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:38,992
We are half way on the path of love.

1053
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:44,795
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1054
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:50,669
We are half way there.

1055
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:57,270
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1056
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:42,380
We are half way there.

1057
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:54,792
l don't know if it's
patience or a test ...

1058
01:12:54,937 --> 01:13:00,739
lt feels extreme ...

1059
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:06,146
it feels the best.

1060
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:11,948
The lively yesterdays are a past ...

1061
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:18,221
the tranquil
tomorrows are now at last.

1062
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:26,031
We are half way on the path of love.

1063
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:31,836
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1064
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:37,436
we are half way on the path of love.

1065
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,777
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1066
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,783
Who has done this?
Headless chicken you are!

1067
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:44,445
What if it hurt someone?

1068
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,852
Don't know what you're up to!

1069
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:55,128
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1070
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:06,799
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1071
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:19,811
We will walk the rest of the mile,
in the footsteps of time.

1072
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:34,227
So, Mr Bittoo ...

1073
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,095
Hey!

1074
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,842
Dude! You are up and about so early!

1075
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:48,908
Why are you looking so screwed up?

1076
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,843
Nothing, you spoke so casually.

1077
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,578
So ...

1078
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,049
Should l address you as Sir. Bittoo

1079
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,920
No, casual is best.

1080
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:01,054
Why are you being so strange?

1081
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:02,859
Not at all.

1082
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,123
Of course you are ...

1083
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,862
Now let's take the tea,
for example ...

1084
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,194
l made tea at home
yesterday evening ...

1085
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,066
and after one sip mummy
and papa said the truth,

1086
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,940
that Shruti can't make
tea to save her life ...

1087
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,340
but from that day on?
- Which day?

1088
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,875
You know which day.

1089
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:24,882
l've been making bad tea
and you've been drinking it.

1090
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:27,884
Are you afraid that you
might hurt my feelings ...

1091
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:30,482
if you said the tea was bad?

1092
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,900
Since when did you become so caring?

1093
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:44,963
Whatever happened between us ...

1094
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:47,904
just happened.

1095
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,370
Don't worry, l am not
like your other ones ...

1096
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:53,910
who stick to you like glue,

1097
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,242
and you are always
running away from them.

1098
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:02,254
l have no problems with
whatever happened between us.

1099
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:05,985
No problem?

1100
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:07,987
No.

1101
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:11,997
Just be the same Bittoo you were.

1102
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:14,931
Why are you so serious?

1103
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:19,601
Dude, you freaked the
living daylights out of me,

1104
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:24,012
the way you behaved
after our session.

1105
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,942
Session?

1106
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:29,075
Dude, l thought Shruti
had fallen in love with me.

1107
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,676
But you are not the foolish
types who stick like glue!

1108
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:33,012
l'm not foolish ...

1109
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,146
Right!

1110
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,417
Everyone makes mistakes ...

1111
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:36,549
Mistake ...

1112
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,217
delete the mistake and move on ...

1113
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,418
should l make tea for
you ... with ginger?

1114
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:41,554
Yes.

1115
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:45,961
You were right all along, love and
business do not go hand in hand.

1116
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:48,497
l am always right ...

1117
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,231
Now watch out,

1118
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,101
we'll fly high.

1119
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,969
Enough of this matchbox-sized room,
decrepit old bike!

1120
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,045
Mercedes! That's
what it's going to be!

1121
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,309
Just imagine if love were to
come between business partners ...

1122
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,444
everything would've been lost.

1123
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:06,988
Forget the Mercedes, we
wouldn't even have the cheapest car.

1124
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,049
So then ...

1125
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,994
you happy, me happy.

1126
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:18,591
Hello ... Shaadi Mubarak ...

1127
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,195
you've called earlier?

1128
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,602
There was some problem on the line,
but it's all sorted now.

1129
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:28,539
Yes l'll be there soon.

1130
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:32,012
Dude, l'm running to the
printer to check Kalra's card ...

1131
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:34,072
you come directly for the
meeting with Asma and Zafar.

1132
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,215
Ok. Bye.

1133
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:42,019
we are half way on the path of love.

1134
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:02,243
Stupid ...

1135
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,111
ldiot, fool ...

1136
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,053
you were following
your rule book, right?

1137
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:20,057
Then why this emotional slip-up?

1138
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:30,061
lf you slip again, you'll be dead!

1139
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,600
Now don't cry,

1140
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,604
not a tear.

1141
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:57,757
Hello, Shaadi Mubarak!

1142
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:00,693
Yes, Ms. Asma ...

1143
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,434
Yes, of course we are meeting ...

1144
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,232
Yes, 12 o'clock sharp.

1145
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:23,591
Asma and Zafar are great people ...

1146
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:26,118
great choice of
location for a meeting.

1147
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,523
Bit of fun, a bit of meeting.

1148
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,131
Great atmosphere ... right?

1149
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:38,673
l can do the meeting myself,

1150
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,139
why don't you just
enjoy the atmosphere?

1151
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:42,668
Really?

1152
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,140
Can l go?

1153
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,143
Excuse me ... Shaadi Mubarak?

1154
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,207
Asma and Zafar?
- Yes, hi ...

1155
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,341
Bittoo.

1156
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,477
Shaadi Mubarak ... Shaadi Mubarak.

1157
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:55,614
lt's a good idea,

1158
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:59,292
but what if we
didn't have lavender ...

1159
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:00,419
We have lavender ...

1160
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,160
and we will use lavender ...

1161
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,360
why are you rejecting my
design just like that?

1162
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:07,827
Too sober ...

1163
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,368
people come to Shaadi
Mubarak for kitsch, not sober.

1164
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,704
Lower class losers
used to come for kitsch,

1165
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,370
this is a high class party.

1166
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:18,576
l'm myself lower class loser ...

1167
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,246
and l understand only kitsch.

1168
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:22,308
You are high class
from London and America,

1169
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,783
keep your upper and
lower class to yourself.

1170
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,449
There are only 5 days to go.

1171
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,385
Do what Shaadi
Mubarak is famous for.

1172
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,852
Don't force your personal taste ...

1173
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,529
Should l put soya
sauce in your noodles?

1174
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,200
l'll eat at home.

1175
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,272
Couldn't you say so when
l was placing the order?

1176
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:49,539
Did you ask me?

1177
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,203
l was screaming my
lungs off standing here.

1178
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,874
Two Manchurian one veg one chicken
... two chowmein one veg one chicken.

1179
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,348
Should l worry about my
work or your nonsense?

1180
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,214
l have no time for bickering.

1181
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,552
l have mailed Rajinder the menu.

1182
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,288
Give this design to Maqsood.

1183
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,619
l'll arrive at the site
directly tomorrow morning.

1184
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:06,226
lt would be best if
you arrived on time.

1185
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,694
Listen ... Shruti, wait.

1186
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,956
Have you lost it? Get rid of
him ... l'll drop you off.

1187
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,292
Leave me.

1188
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,562
lf l don't want to
go with you, l won't.

1189
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,564
You create a scene
out of everything!

1190
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,239
Go to hell ...

1191
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,241
Let's go.

1192
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,328
OK, please read the Nikah ...
commence in the name of Allah.

1193
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,332
Keep the music on.

1194
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:46,926
Please begin.

1195
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,533
Zafar Khan

1196
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:57,605
What's wrong? lt
was fine up till now.

1197
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:01,280
Something wrong on that
side ... No? Yes? Any sound?

1198
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,279
Where is your mind these days?

1199
01:22:03,552 --> 01:22:05,543
Don't talk rubbish if you
can't solve the problem!

1200
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:07,420
Sound is your department.

1201
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:15,754
Please commence.

1202
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,961
Zafar Khan ... Asma Siddiqui ...

1203
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:24,500
Santy, l've told you
thousand times, do all the checks.

1204
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,768
You all slack and l have
to bear the embarrassment.

1205
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:29,776
Yes l do.

1206
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:31,370
Congratulations.

1207
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,393
Santy. Shaadi Mubarak!

1208
01:22:56,338 --> 01:23:00,069
Come on, guys!

1209
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:01,533
Bittoo ...

1210
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,404
l'll die but l won't dance with you.

1211
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,341
Just do it for the
client's happiness.

1212
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,080
Your dark and cunning eyes,

1213
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:12,614
are not too shy,

1214
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:14,553
They look sly, very hi-fi

1215
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:20,687
Making my heart skip
a beat, l wonder why?

1216
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,427
Your dark and cunning eyes,

1217
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,764
are not too shy,

1218
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,966
They look sly, very hi-fi

1219
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:39,037
Making my heart skip
a beat, l wonder why?

1220
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:44,711
Just like a biscuit dipped in tea,

1221
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:47,979
That's how my life
has turned out to be.

1222
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:51,389
This is how l have lost out to me.

1223
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,395
That's how my life
has turned out to be.

1224
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:56,988
This is how l have lost out to me.

1225
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,464
Have you brought the console?
- Counted the tables?

1226
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,864
Checked the mixer?

1227
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:01,596
Listen ... all of that ...

1228
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,488
Should l drop you home?

1229
01:24:34,036 --> 01:24:35,094
Don't come from tomorrow.

1230
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,432
Don't come where?

1231
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,835
lt's you who comes there.
l live there.

1232
01:24:40,976 --> 01:24:43,911
Pack your stuff and vacate the room
before l get there in the morning.

1233
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:45,037
What nonsense?

1234
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:51,043
Bittoo, the partnership is finished.

1235
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,177
What?

1236
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:57,520
lf we work together then my Shaadi
Mubarak will become a disaster ...

1237
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:58,650
My Shaadi Mubarak?

1238
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,185
Since when has it been yours alone?

1239
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:01,520
Don't shout.

1240
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,061
Shaadi Mubarak was my idea.

1241
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,189
My effort.

1242
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,524
You'll be paid for it.

1243
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,128
Try and break the partnership,
l'll take you to court.

1244
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:09,465
lt's not a divorce that
needs to go to court ...

1245
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:12,939
we'll divide the
stuff ... that's final.

1246
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,474
Why are you
ruining a great business?

1247
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:18,940
Think calmly.

1248
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:20,939
What did you say?

1249
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:22,541
Session?

1250
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:28,014
Oh, so this is what it is!

1251
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,551
So why should l
leave Shaadi Mubarak?

1252
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:31,819
Was it me alone?

1253
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,485
You said 'let me rest'.

1254
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:37,498
l thought, she must be tired,
let her rest. What did l know?

1255
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:41,502
Go back to your village,
to your father ...

1256
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,497
you just want to earn
money ... do another business.

1257
01:25:44,573 --> 01:25:46,837
Your father will readily pay
for his baby's business and ...

1258
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,843
if still nothing happens
then chop sugar canes,

1259
01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:51,977
but never come back
to Shaadi Mubarak!

1260
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,715
Oh, l see ... l am a baby ...

1261
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:55,841
l'll run home with my
tail between my legs ...

1262
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,509
that's what you think of me.

1263
01:25:57,586 --> 01:25:58,917
l'll obviously think of you.
what you really are.

1264
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,045
Everything is clear today.

1265
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:02,581
lt took three years.

1266
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,249
So l can't do
anything on my own, right?

1267
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:05,584
At least l've never seen it.

1268
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,527
l'll start my own Shaadi Mubarak
... 100 times better than yours.

1269
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,521
Let's go. He is crazy!

1270
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,862
To hell with your partnership.

1271
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,534
To hell with you.

1272
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:33,885
What's the programme?

1273
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:37,616
What's going on here?

1274
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:39,017
Don't ask.

1275
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:43,230
Hope there hasn't been a break up?

1276
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,632
Oh ... who will plan my wedding now?

1277
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:53,571
Where are they? Both of them.

1278
01:26:55,243 --> 01:26:58,770
This is your 20. l've
given Shruti madam hers.

1279
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,182
You will buy a car now?
Can l take this helmet?

1280
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,308
Here.

1281
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:05,047
You thief.

1282
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,185
You can't take anything that
belongs to Shaadi Mubarak.

1283
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,260
Here l am not taking it.

1284
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:17,722
You dog... son of a gun ...

1285
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,734
Where did you come into
my life from and ruin it?

1286
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:23,671
Good morning, madam.
- What's it?

1287
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:26,004
My wedding ... we
spoke ... the discount ...

1288
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,598
l called on the phone. Come
back in the morning tomorrow.

1289
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:28,938
OK l'll come back tomorrow.

1290
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,005
Leave this rubbish ... come with me.

1291
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,014
l'll get you the best deal.
- How much?

1292
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,606
He'll fleece you. Will
you have tea or coffee?

1293
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:36,878
Coffee?
- We serve cold drinks ...

1294
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,817
forget cold drinks, we
will guzzle beer together.

1295
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:40,286
Will you serve cold drink ...
- l taught him everything.

1296
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,617
Don't fall into her trap.

1297
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,952
He will strip you to the core.

1298
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:44,685
Strip me?

1299
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,695
Forget getting people married,
start getting them divorced.

1300
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:52,628
You play with people's emotions!

1301
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,167
l wanted to get married ...
to hell with you ...

1302
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,102
Villager! Buy a ticket
to your father's house ...

1303
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:00,698
and practice cutting sugarcane.

1304
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:04,643
l'll turn this Delhi into a village ...
beware you bloody Kakkar ...

1305
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,237
Get out from here ... son of a gun.

1306
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:11,652
There are going to be some smooth
business operations from my place!

1307
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:14,914
Massive weddings of
important men's daughters.

1308
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:17,124
Every Delhi girl's wedding
will be planned from here.

1309
01:28:17,192 --> 01:28:19,660
By next year l'll even
reach a bigger mall.

1310
01:28:22,264 --> 01:28:23,663
What're you going to
name your company?

1311
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:24,858
Original Shaadi Mubarak.

1312
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:25,991
No, dude.

1313
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,329
Dude, Kakkar's is fake.
Mine's original.

1314
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,664
No ...

1315
01:28:30,005 --> 01:28:31,666
Shaadi Mubarak Part 2?

1316
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,798
No ...

1317
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:36,005
Return of Shaadi Mubarak.

1318
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:37,736
No ...

1319
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:41,745
Shaadi Mubarak season 2!

1320
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:44,343
You've lost it?

1321
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,681
Try Happy Wedding.

1322
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:47,145
Full English.

1323
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,292
OK. Done. Happy Wedding it is!

1324
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:55,691
Hello Shaadi Mubarak ...

1325
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:57,891
l mean Happy Wedding.

1326
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,231
Aren't there two
partners in Shaadi Mubarak?

1327
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,700
He was my assistant, not a partner.

1328
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:03,829
l got rid of him.

1329
01:29:04,306 --> 01:29:05,364
He was a leech.

1330
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,702
Happy Wedding?

1331
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:09,176
Weren't you called Sha ...?

1332
01:29:09,244 --> 01:29:12,702
Shh, don't use that
name ... it's cursed.

1333
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:13,839
Your child's
marriage will be ruined.

1334
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:17,713
l threw him out so he started his
own company to suck the clients dry.

1335
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,313
l hope you have not
approached any Happy Wedding ...

1336
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,380
don't even think about it.
lt's that leech's company.

1337
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,722
Everyone thinks we
worked together ...

1338
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:29,055
but the reality is
that l did all the work.

1339
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:32,258
My ideas, my execution
and who gets the credit?

1340
01:29:32,334 --> 01:29:34,734
No, no, don't take the
name ... it's cursed.

1341
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:36,202
Your child's
marriage will be ruined.

1342
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:42,943
Shruti, your contract is on
the 21st and so is his ...

1343
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,270
what do we do now?

1344
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,817
Don't worry ... let's
celebrate my first contract.

1345
01:29:53,088 --> 01:29:55,750
l'll give you 500 thousand
rupees 400 thousand yours ...

1346
01:29:55,824 --> 01:29:57,018
200 thousand Santy's.

1347
01:29:57,092 --> 01:29:59,287
All payments have been doubled.
Now take my booking.

1348
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:02,156
550, 450, 250 ...

1349
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,762
600, 500, 300 ...

1350
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:06,091
650 ... 550 ...

1351
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:07,225
One minute ...

1352
01:30:07,836 --> 01:30:10,361
no fighting in my office ...
or else l'll give you one each!

1353
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,763
Listen carefully ...

1354
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:18,104
we have decided that if you two work
separately, we won't work with you.

1355
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:19,373
Correct ... he's right.

1356
01:30:20,382 --> 01:30:23,783
And if you work together, then ...

1357
01:30:23,852 --> 01:30:25,376
Forget about that ...
last offer ... 650 thousand.

1358
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:27,785
l'll pay in advance ... everything.

1359
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:28,914
Are you leaving or ...?

1360
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:30,916
Ya, ya, going ...

1361
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,394
There is no dearth of
vendors in the market.

1362
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:51,206
This issue is escalating.
What do you say, Maqsood?

1363
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:53,013
Both are impossible.

1364
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:59,150
Just leave it here.

1365
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,949
Hey ... that pole is
not meant for the centre.

1366
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:04,824
So tell me where
it's supposed to go ...

1367
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:06,827
Look at the design.
- Just tell me where it goes ...

1368
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:08,829
lf l sit on your head and monitor
you all the time, who will do my work?

1369
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:10,489
OK, l'm extremely sorry ... you
tell me where it's supposed to go.

1370
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:12,089
Didn't l give you the design?

1371
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:15,234
Work according to that.
And don't mess with me.

1372
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:17,095
Come on ...

1373
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:20,840
Will it be any speedier?
lt'll reach up by tomorrow.

1374
01:31:23,445 --> 01:31:25,106
Sir, please check
the flower decoration.

1375
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,442
Tell Shruti madam to check it.

1376
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:27,845
Tell who?

1377
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,977
Who else will you tell?
Me, obviously ...

1378
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:37,457
You are lost along
the way, my friend.

1379
01:31:38,393 --> 01:31:46,858
Why have you turned a stranger,
my friend?

1380
01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:58,869
Something is amiss ...

1381
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:08,879
my heart feels an empty abyss.

1382
01:32:08,957 --> 01:32:16,887
You've led the
sunshine away my friend.

1383
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:27,899
Why have you turned a stranger,
my friend?

1384
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:33,912
Sir this half payment won't
do ... there is a contract ...

1385
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,980
give the full payment or
else l'll slap a case on you.

1386
01:32:36,451 --> 01:32:38,112
Call us if you need a lawyer.

1387
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:42,248
Me and my son, whose wedding
you have spoiled, are lawyers.

1388
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,648
Good night.

1389
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:49,555


1390
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:58,339
There is pain in the
thousand strings in my heart.

1391
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:07,946
The silk threads we
tied are all torn apart.

1392
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:19,218
lt's the price of the separation.

1393
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:28,966
Just the memories and tribulations.

1394
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:35,166
The state my heart is in, my friend.

1395
01:33:35,243 --> 01:33:36,301
No worries, child ...

1396
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:38,436
we'll get another car ...
bigger than this one.

1397
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:43,980
Why have you turned a stranger,
my friend?

1398
01:33:44,052 --> 01:33:48,113
Credit is for a month,
not for 6 months.

1399
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:51,056
Hello, hello. lf you all surround
me like this how can l get out?

1400
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,325
And get to the bank?

1401
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:55,987
And take my check book,
and withdraw the money ...

1402
01:33:56,064 --> 01:33:58,055
and give it you? Give
me some space please.

1403
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,999
Yes, yes, of course, give him
some space to get to the bank.

1404
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:10,000
My friend, you took my peace away.

1405
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,138
l only have this much.

1406
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:15,682
Give me some time,
l'll return the rest.

1407
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,012
How will you return it, madam?

1408
01:34:17,085 --> 01:34:20,486
Until you pay your debts no one
in the market will work with you,

1409
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:22,546
how will you get new contracts?

1410
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:24,082
l've not run away ...

1411
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,084
just trust me.

1412
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:31,489
Ok fine ...

1413
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:34,365
three months and no more ...

1414
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,227
Thank you.

1415
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:38,498
Let's go. God knows how many
more rounds we'll have to make.

1416
01:34:49,717 --> 01:34:50,775
Hello ...

1417
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:54,379
Who do you want?

1418
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:02,389
Who Sidhwani? Which office?

1419
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:04,531
l don't owe any Sidhwani any money.

1420
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:09,066
Mr. Sidhwani, the owner
of the Sidhwani group.

1421
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:11,662
We own 10 heritage hotels
and resorts in Rajasthan.

1422
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,400
The biggest in Bikaner.

1423
01:35:13,675 --> 01:35:16,075
Mr. Sidhwani's daughter
is getting married ...

1424
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:18,203
and he wants Shaadi
Mubarak to plan the wedding.

1425
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:20,611
Can you come into our
office for a meeting?

1426
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:17,467
Good afternoon, sir ...
- So Shaadi Mubarak ...

1427
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,267
Yes sir.
- Sir, Myself ... Happy Wedding.

1428
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:21,138
l don't want Happy Wedding.

1429
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:23,674
Just the original Shaadi Mubarak.

1430
01:36:27,482 --> 01:36:29,143
To cut a long story short,
my daughter Preeti,

1431
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:32,482
whose wedding it is, insists
that you plan her wedding.

1432
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,152
l was calling the best wedding
planners from ltaly, France ...

1433
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:38,624
and the UK but Preeti
saw your work at ...

1434
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:41,161
Pankaj and Sonya's
wedding and decided that ...

1435
01:36:41,229 --> 01:36:44,289
her wedding would be
planned by Bittoo and Shruti.

1436
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:48,761
l can handle it alone.

1437
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:50,228
l don't need him.

1438
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:51,896
Alone!

1439
01:36:53,508 --> 01:36:54,566
l have a file ...

1440
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:56,706
from the day you
started working alone ...

1441
01:36:57,178 --> 01:37:01,512
there have been electrical failures,
security issues, shortages of food.

1442
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:05,515
There can be no failures
at my daughter's wedding.

1443
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,645
Sir, there won't be
any in my planning.

1444
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:09,783
Bittoo Sharma ...

1445
01:37:10,725 --> 01:37:13,250
your Happy Wedding planning
disaster list is even longer.

1446
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:14,919
Should l read it?

1447
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:16,390
No thank you, sir ...

1448
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:24,395
OK, so it's better for me
if you don't work together.

1449
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:27,271
l can call on the best
professionals in the world.

1450
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:34,205
lf you want the contract then
work together as Shaadi Mubarak ...

1451
01:37:34,816 --> 01:37:35,874
or else ...

1452
01:37:44,225 --> 01:37:45,283
Sir ...
- No.

1453
01:37:56,637 --> 01:37:58,571
Sir l'll give you a
forty percent discount.

1454
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,834
Thank you, Mr. Bittoo Sharma ...

1455
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:02,767
Sir Fifty.

1456
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:04,575
Fifty ... percent.

1457
01:38:06,581 --> 01:38:07,707
Sir, this way please ...

1458
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,309
Both of you have gone crazy.

1459
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,319
l'll die but l won't work with her.

1460
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:14,852
You will die anyway.

1461
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:18,254
l've been able to hold off your
lenders for three months only ...

1462
01:38:18,326 --> 01:38:19,384
not your entire life!

1463
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:24,931
After 90 days your bones
will be lying in the gutter.

1464
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,463
Now tell me if you want to
finish your war with Shruti ...

1465
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:29,594
or die in the gutter?

1466
01:38:31,606 --> 01:38:32,664
ldiot.

1467
01:38:35,543 --> 01:38:38,876
Look ... you started
your company from this lane.

1468
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:42,279
Now you're stuck in a
well and he is in a ridge.

1469
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,947
Let go of the past, shake
hands and move on from this fight.

1470
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:48,353
Has he brainwashed you?

1471
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:52,617
No, no, this was my idea.

1472
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:56,286
Anyway, he can't think
of anything on his own ...

1473
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,367
OK ...

1474
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:03,969
But just for one wedding ...

1475
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:06,768
come to the office
tomorrow at 8 o'clock.

1476
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:08,365
Why your office? My office.

1477
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:09,500
Bittoo!

1478
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:13,378
Which company does
Sidhwani want for the wedding?

1479
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:16,311
Shaadi Mubarak ...

1480
01:39:16,384 --> 01:39:18,648
so work will happen from the
Shaadi Mubarak office, right?

1481
01:39:19,654 --> 01:39:21,315
Maqsood, please ...

1482
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,391
ldiot.

1483
01:39:51,953 --> 01:39:54,945
On time! For a good
first impression? Or ...

1484
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,489
What first impression
can there be on you!

1485
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:00,617
l've only been able to arrange
second hand furniture so far ...

1486
01:40:01,963 --> 01:40:03,954
lt's OK ... it's only a
matter of three months ...

1487
01:40:04,632 --> 01:40:06,361
hardly like l'm here permanently.

1488
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:13,368
And l have a plan for working
together for three months ...

1489
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,773
without murdering each other.

1490
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,037
What new plan now?

1491
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:18,908
l've cleared up the
area on top for you.

1492
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:22,380
You can set up there ...
and l'll work down here.

1493
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,379
Let's divide the departments too ...

1494
01:40:24,652 --> 01:40:27,587
so you don't poke your nose
in mine and l won't in yours.

1495
01:40:29,457 --> 01:40:31,448
Done ... catering and lighting mine.

1496
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:32,856
Music, choreography, decoration ...

1497
01:40:32,927 --> 01:40:33,985
Security ... Design ...

1498
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:36,928
Not design ... l'll do the design
... you'll make some kitsch one.

1499
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:48,470
your work is going ahead ...

1500
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:53,071
He's right here sir.

1501
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:11,491
Let's go. Site inspection!

1502
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:17,899
My father got married here ...

1503
01:41:18,706 --> 01:41:19,764
and then l did.

1504
01:41:21,108 --> 01:41:24,441
Now both of them will
get married here too.

1505
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:27,841
Henna, ladies' night,
wedding and, send off ...

1506
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,780
Only the honeymoon is not from here.

1507
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:33,444
All the guests will stay here ...

1508
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:34,920
Seven-day-long party.

1509
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:37,054
The party will be in
true Shaadi Mubarak style.

1510
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,585
l hope you spoke to him
about superstar Shahrukh's dance.

1511
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:40,718
Yes l did.

1512
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:44,459
We can ...
- Of course ... we will.

1513
01:41:44,532 --> 01:41:45,726
Even Shahrukh's performance?

1514
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,465
Yes, even Shahrukh's performance!

1515
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,465
Join by Friday ... do read this ...

1516
01:41:56,077 --> 01:41:57,476

hope it's not a problem.

1517
01:41:57,545 --> 01:41:58,603
No, maam ...

1518
01:41:58,679 --> 01:41:59,737
Next!

1519
01:41:59,814 --> 01:42:01,076

01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:02,479
So Mr Bengal,

1521
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:04,745

Take the order ... Two chowmein,

Two Manchurian, one veg,

1526

Yes.

1538
01:43:14,088 --> 01:43:15,146
Ya ...

1540
01:43:17,091 --> 01:43:18,956
Shruti!

1541
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,755

01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:26,027
you're getting calls all
the time, no one calls me!

1547
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:40,905
OK, bye.

1548
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:42,840
Shruti ...

1549
01:43:47,655 --> 01:43:48,713
Got a call again?

1550
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:51,315
Shruti!

1551
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:58,588
Hey, wait ... don't need a cab.

1552
01:43:59,934 --> 01:44:00,992
Come on ...

1553
01:44:01,202 --> 01:44:02,260

1554
01:44:02,336 --> 01:44:03,598
Home!

1555
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:12,806
You pretend to be all classy ...

1556
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:15,171
but look at your car ...
it's so kitschy.

1557
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:17,615
Not kitschy ... stylish!

1558
01:44:20,154 --> 01:44:22,179
l should have run away
from the shop like you did ...

1559
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:24,686
l don't know when l'll
have my own car now.

1560
01:44:24,959 --> 01:44:26,017
Am l not intelligent?

1561
01:44:27,695 --> 01:44:29,287
Not intelligent ... thief!

1562
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:37,964
Changed the name plate ...

1563
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:40,698
very nice.

1564
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:42,767
OK, bye.

1565
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:18,402
So Bittoo, what's the status?

Yes ... family no 53,

1567
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,874
55, 56's flight has been delayed ...

1568
01:45:23,951 --> 01:45:25,009

1569
01:45:25,085 --> 01:45:27,986
and uncle-aunty no 78 have
tagged two friends along.

1570
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:29,420
ln the list it's only
old man and old woman ...

1571
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:31,156
where do l fix the friends?

1572
01:45:31,225 --> 01:45:32,852
Should l bury them at the airport?

1573
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,219
Let it be. lf their
ghost catches you,

1574
01:45:35,296 --> 01:45:36,422
you will become more unbearable.

1575
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:38,425
So should l get
them a return ticket?

1576
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:40,730
Send them ... l'll
figure out something.

1577
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:43,896
Thirty-seven arriving! bye!
- Bye.

1578
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:51,777
Bands, Horns and Revelry

1579
01:45:54,048 --> 01:45:56,175
Have you sold 204 and 208 somewhere?

1580
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:58,445
They were clicking
pictures everywhere.

1581
01:45:59,053 --> 01:46:01,385
Camel photo ... cow photo ...

1582
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:03,719
Donkey, owl, crow,
pigeon, photo, photo, photo.

1583
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:05,725
Why are you stressed out?
Haven't you stuffed your face yet?

1584
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:07,784
l've just eaten six, seven
sandwiches, there was no time.

1585
01:46:08,796 --> 01:46:09,888
Glutton of the topmost order.

1586
01:46:11,332 --> 01:46:12,993
One minute ... hello, how are you?

1587
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:20,296
Come, come ... OK, just do it ...

1588
01:46:21,075 --> 01:46:23,009
yes, yes, they will
come ... hey, Shruti.

1589
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:24,468
Ok,

1590
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:26,337
no,

1591
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:29,238
just one second. - Guests are
arriving ... go and have a look!

1592
01:46:29,316 --> 01:46:30,442
Cover for me for a bit?

1593
01:46:30,818 --> 01:46:31,978
Your department ... you handle it.

1594
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:37,985
l'm a bit busy ...
will call you in a bit.

1595
01:46:42,296 --> 01:46:43,354
ls this dish Ok?

1596
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,488
lt's good.

1597
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,158
lt's great, now just let it be.

1598
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:48,360
You've been at it for so long.

1599
01:46:48,435 --> 01:46:49,902
Go inside and help out.

1600
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:51,961
Don't waste time. Take this plate.

1601
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:53,973
So this is your canopy ... not bad.

1602
01:46:55,109 --> 01:46:58,306
lt will look cooler
once my lighting comes in.

1603
01:46:58,846 --> 01:47:01,144
Let it be ... my canopy
will glow even in the dark.

1604
01:47:01,215 --> 01:47:03,206
You need to get off the
phone to complete the canopy.

1605
01:47:07,354 --> 01:47:08,480
Yes, sir ... Shruti Kakkar ...

1606
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:23,928
Who was it?

1607
01:47:26,407 --> 01:47:27,806
Shahrukh's got a fracture.

1608
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:28,933
What?

1609
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:30,067
No way!

1610
01:47:30,144 --> 01:47:31,202
lt's the leg.

1611
01:47:32,046 --> 01:47:34,241
But l've already told the guests.

1612
01:47:34,314 --> 01:47:35,872
Preeti, did you hear?

1613
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:40,211
Daddy, everything is spoiled ...
my entire wedding is spoiled.

1614
01:47:42,356 --> 01:47:44,381
Please excuse my interference,
but what

1615
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:47,552
would Shahrukh have done
had he come? Married you?

1616
01:47:48,495 --> 01:47:50,429
Vowed to love you till eternity?

1617
01:47:51,165 --> 01:47:53,065
He's not going to
take any such vows.

1618
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:56,460
Mr. Vikram will.

1619
01:47:58,172 --> 01:47:59,571
He is your Shahrukh Khan ...

1620
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,103
what will Shahrukh
do by coming here?

1621
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:09,081
Some dancing, singing ...
just leave all that to us,

1622
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,847
we will put on such a show that,

1623
01:48:11,919 --> 01:48:13,853
your friends will
forget all about Shahrukh.

1624
01:48:14,188 --> 01:48:17,851
But everyone is expecting a
Shahrukh-level rocking performance.

1625
01:48:18,192 --> 01:48:20,057
You haven't seen our level yet.

1626
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,191
Don't worry ... in fact,
just leave it to us.

1627
01:48:25,432 --> 01:48:27,024
Where did you copy the
'love till eternity' line from?

1628
01:48:27,468 --> 01:48:28,594
My original.

1629
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:30,528
Bittoo!

1630
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:32,129
From an English picture.

1631
01:48:32,206 --> 01:48:33,468
l knew it wasn't original.

1632
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,905
The audience clapped, right?

1633
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:36,934
Full on ...

1634
01:48:38,412 --> 01:48:40,346
lnside you showed
them an English film?

1635
01:48:41,115 --> 01:48:42,207
What will you show them at night?

1636
01:48:42,483 --> 01:48:44,951
Not me alone ... you too.

1637
01:48:45,886 --> 01:48:46,944
What!

1638
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:49,511
Original Bittoo Shruti
from the kitschy hinterland.

1639
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:58,390


1640
01:49:00,234 --> 01:49:02,327
Love is splendid.

1641
01:49:02,569 --> 01:49:04,628
Love is profound.

1642
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:21,915
lt's a euphoria.

1643
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:24,353
lt's riveting.

1644
01:49:28,996 --> 01:49:32,557
Heart's a nomad.

1645
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,364
lt's mesmerising.

1646
01:49:36,436 --> 01:49:38,927
lt's riveting.

1647
01:49:43,477 --> 01:49:46,605
Heart's a nomad.

1648
01:49:48,015 --> 01:49:50,210
l have given myself to you.

1649
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:52,684
l've lost everything to you.

1650
01:49:52,953 --> 01:49:55,183
l have given myself to you.

1651
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:57,587
l've lost everything to you.

1652
01:49:57,658 --> 01:50:02,561
My heart is not mine.

1653
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:05,294
lt's crazy for you.

1654
01:50:05,365 --> 01:50:07,526
lt's a euphoria.

1655
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,035
lt's riveting.

1656
01:50:14,308 --> 01:50:16,572
Oh, the moon so far.

1657
01:50:16,643 --> 01:50:19,635
l am just a lone star.

1658
01:50:19,713 --> 01:50:22,011
lt's mesmerising.

1659
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:00,553
Love is an enigma,

1660
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:02,746
Love is a mystery.

1661
01:51:03,357 --> 01:51:09,296
Lanes of love are
like the deep blue sea.

1662
01:51:12,266 --> 01:51:14,598
Love is an enigma,

1663
01:51:15,369 --> 01:51:17,337
Love is a mystery.

1664
01:51:17,704 --> 01:51:21,504
Lanes of love are
like the deep blue sea.

1665
01:51:21,575 --> 01:51:24,043
l am drowning yet floating.

1666
01:51:24,111 --> 01:51:26,443
l am a waif, l am nothing.

1667
01:51:31,318 --> 01:51:39,089
My heart is not mine,
lt's crazy for you.

1668
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:41,127
lt's a euphoria.

1669
01:51:41,395 --> 01:51:43,625
lt's riveting.

1670
01:51:58,278 --> 01:52:00,405
Fall in love.

1671
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,812
Sink in love.

1672
01:52:02,883 --> 01:52:05,249
Die in love.

1673
01:52:08,155 --> 01:52:10,089
Fall in love.

1674
01:52:10,157 --> 01:52:12,523
Sink in love.

1675
01:52:12,592 --> 01:52:14,822
Die in love.

1676
01:52:37,184 --> 01:52:41,416
God is my only friend.

1677
01:52:41,722 --> 01:52:48,127
ln love l've lost my life.

1678
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:56,133
God is my only friend.

1679
01:52:56,203 --> 01:53:00,196
l've lost everything to you.

1680
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:02,673
Yet my lover's yard,

1681
01:53:02,743 --> 01:53:04,734
is better than the temple of god.

1682
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:07,336
Yet my lover's yard,

1683
01:53:07,414 --> 01:53:09,541
is better than the temple of god.

1684
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:17,421
My heart is not mine,
lt's crazy for you.

1685
01:53:17,491 --> 01:53:19,550
lt's a euphoria.

1686
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,490
lt's riveting.

1687
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,827
Oh, the moon so far.

1688
01:53:28,902 --> 01:53:31,769
l am just a lone star.

1689
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:34,169
lt's a euphoria.

1690
01:53:34,508 --> 01:53:36,703
lt's riveting.

1691
01:54:17,784 --> 01:54:21,379
Mr. Bittoo, Mr Bittoo Khan ...
let's go and set the plates up.

1692
01:54:21,455 --> 01:54:22,888
They will be screaming
for dinner in a minute.

1693
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:27,950
The lighting looks great.

1694
01:54:28,562 --> 01:54:30,894
l just hope that the flowers don't
wither by tomorrow ... but l ...

1695
01:54:30,964 --> 01:54:32,829
Oh, just let this Taj Mahal be.

1696
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:36,292
So Mr. Shahrukh Khan,
have your guests eaten?

1697
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:38,234
Yes, yes, they have.
You should eat too ...

1698
01:54:38,305 --> 01:54:39,465
so that the breakfast
team can begin preparations.

1699
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,900
lt's perfect,
Maqsood. Come on, let's eat.

1700
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:46,468
Thank God, at least she
said 'perfect' for once.

1701
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:49,513
l was thinking that these
altars will turn into my grave.

1702
01:54:49,583 --> 01:54:51,881
Shruti. One minute ...

1703
01:54:57,524 --> 01:54:58,582
sit down ...

1704
01:55:01,828 --> 01:55:02,886
listen to the plan for the future.

1705
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:06,261
Enough of the l-spy.

1706
01:55:07,334 --> 01:55:10,269
Happy Wedding is finished,

1707
01:55:10,937 --> 01:55:11,995
from now on only Shaadi Mubarak.

1708
01:55:14,608 --> 01:55:15,666
Not possible, Bittoo.

1709
01:55:15,742 --> 01:55:18,870
No, Bittoo ... l have decided.
Decision's taken.

1710
01:55:19,813 --> 01:55:22,008
We can't work together.

1711
01:55:23,884 --> 01:55:26,011
Last time we planned a
wedding for 30 million,

1712
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:28,452
you created an issue and
broke up the partnership.

1713
01:55:29,356 --> 01:55:31,847
Now we have doubled it,
you are moving away.

1714
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,418
What is the problem?

1715
01:55:34,628 --> 01:55:36,528
You really like this
snakes and ladders game?

1716
01:55:41,968 --> 01:55:45,369
Together we have organised
such a big wedding so well.

1717
01:55:46,373 --> 01:55:47,499
We are a great team,

1718
01:55:48,842 --> 01:55:50,036
and you are ruining it.

1719
01:55:50,977 --> 01:55:54,310
l am not going to let
it happen ... l am not.

1720
01:55:57,918 --> 01:55:58,976
Are you done talking?

1721
01:56:00,587 --> 01:56:01,645
Now may l ?

1722
01:56:01,721 --> 01:56:02,779
Go for it ... say anything ...

1723
01:56:02,856 --> 01:56:04,653
just don't say we
can't work together.

1724
01:56:04,724 --> 01:56:05,918
Any other conditions are OK with me.

1725
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:07,323
l am getting married in two months,

1726
01:56:07,994 --> 01:56:09,052
to Chetan.

1727
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:13,457
He stays in Dubai, and
after the wedding l'll move

1728
01:56:22,943 --> 01:56:26,344
You ... you ...

1729
01:56:27,681 --> 01:56:31,412
you've gone mad. You can't marry.

1730
01:56:33,553 --> 01:56:34,611
Why not?

1731
01:56:36,423 --> 01:56:38,084
And to Chetan l can ...

1732
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,018
he is educated,

1733
01:56:42,429 --> 01:56:43,487
sophisticated,

1734
01:56:44,931 --> 01:56:46,091
he is the right guy.

1735
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:49,828
Nothing is right ... it's
all wrong. Totally wrong.

1736
01:56:50,637 --> 01:56:52,434
Right ... it is right.

1737
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:54,973
Wrong, wrong, wrong ...

1738
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:57,365
Why do you think it's wrong?

1739
01:56:57,911 --> 01:56:58,969
Give me a reason.

1740
01:56:59,713 --> 01:57:02,773
Because wrong is wrong,
and wrong cannot be right.

1741
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:07,110
Chetan ...

1742
01:57:07,988 --> 01:57:11,515
Oh, so it's that jackass who
is calling you again and again.

1743
01:57:13,727 --> 01:57:15,388
Fine! Keep answering his calls.

1744
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:17,727
Hello Chetan, how are you?

1745
01:57:18,999 --> 01:57:20,057
A problem has come up,

1746
01:57:20,133 --> 01:57:23,534
l'll call you a bit later. OK, bye.

1747
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:25,495
Bittoo ...

1748
01:57:25,572 --> 01:57:29,440
Wrong ... it's all wrong.
Completely wrong.

1749
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:50,792
Bittoo ... what are you guys doing?

1750
01:57:51,765 --> 01:57:52,823
Puneet, get off!

1751
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:53,957
l'll break your legs if you get off.

1752
01:57:54,034 --> 01:57:56,662
You're getting wet ... for no
reason ... Bittoo tell them.

1753
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:58,169
Let us do our job ...
just go from here.

1754
01:58:00,106 --> 01:58:02,939
Anju, what are you doing here?
Leave it ... and go.

1755
01:58:06,446 --> 01:58:07,811
Let it go, Bittoo.
- Move ...

1756
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:08,939
You'll fall ill.

1757
01:58:09,015 --> 01:58:10,073
Let me do my job.

1758
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:11,447
There is no point in saving it.

1759
01:58:11,518 --> 01:58:12,576
Just go ...

1760
01:58:12,786 --> 01:58:15,619
Just get off ... get off.

1761
01:58:15,689 --> 01:58:16,747
Hurry up.

1762
01:58:23,463 --> 01:58:24,521
Come inside.

1763
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:29,496
Go in and dry yourselves ... hurry.

1764
01:58:38,812 --> 01:58:41,212
Let it be ...
we'll make another one.

1765
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:49,918
You were asking for a reason ...

1766
01:58:51,891 --> 01:58:52,949
Shaadi Mubarak.

1767
01:58:54,828 --> 01:58:56,022
lt's taken so much effort to set up,

1768
01:58:56,963 --> 01:58:58,487
and now you are
running off to Dubai.

1769
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:02,568
What's to become of Shaadi Mubarak?

1770
01:59:02,836 --> 01:59:04,770
Chetan has no problem
with my business ...

1771
01:59:06,106 --> 01:59:08,734
l told you, he's the right guy.

1772
01:59:09,843 --> 01:59:11,572
l'll set up Shaadi Mubarak in Dubai.

1773
01:59:11,644 --> 01:59:13,009
lt will drown in Dubai!

1774
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:14,171
What's it to you,

1775
01:59:14,848 --> 01:59:16,543
if it sinks or floats?

1776
01:59:17,584 --> 01:59:18,710
lt's my problem. Okay?

1777
01:59:19,586 --> 01:59:27,755
You are lost along
the way, my friend.

1778
01:59:30,096 --> 01:59:34,123
Why have you turned a stranger,
my friend?

1779
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,861
Bittoo. What do we do for breakfast?

1780
01:59:35,935 --> 01:59:37,562
Hurry up, there's no time ...

1781
02:00:06,633 --> 02:00:07,691
What about uncle and aunty?

1782
02:00:08,101 --> 02:00:09,159
What?

1783
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:12,136
You will go to Dubai ...
what will they do with out you?

1784
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,570
Both are very happy together ...

1785
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:14,868
and l'm not going to Antarctica ...

1786
02:00:14,941 --> 02:00:16,067
Dubai is three hours away.

1787
02:00:16,142 --> 02:00:18,042
Don't worry, nothing
will happen to them.

1788
02:00:18,912 --> 02:00:22,075
OK, start placing the
pillows ... Hurry up.

1789
02:00:27,587 --> 02:00:28,713
Dubai won't suit you.

1790
02:00:29,656 --> 02:00:30,987
You can't wear jeans and skirts.

1791
02:00:31,658 --> 02:00:33,649
Too much heat, too much dust.

1792
02:00:33,726 --> 02:00:36,661
Bittoo, any other reason? Solid one?

1793
02:00:38,598 --> 02:00:39,656
lf not,

1794
02:00:39,799 --> 02:00:41,858
leave and let me do my work.

1795
02:00:58,918 --> 02:00:59,976
What happened ?

1796
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:01,245
l have cracked the reason ...

1797
02:01:04,023 --> 02:01:05,888
That jackass is marrying you ...

1798
02:01:07,694 --> 02:01:10,356
he is done for. Chetan's had it.

1799
02:01:11,231 --> 02:01:13,631
Don't listen to me. Go get married.

1800
02:01:14,968 --> 02:01:16,629
But your anger won't die down.

1801
02:01:22,308 --> 02:01:23,366
What anger?

1802
02:01:23,977 --> 02:01:25,308
What are you talking about?

1803
02:01:25,912 --> 02:01:27,641
Let it be ... Now that
you've already decided ...

1804
02:01:27,714 --> 02:01:29,306
what difference can my talk make?

1805
02:01:30,650 --> 02:01:31,708
Just say it ... quickly ...

1806
02:01:31,985 --> 02:01:34,317
You are taking revenge on me
by marrying that jackass, right?

1807
02:01:35,321 --> 02:01:36,652
Chetan! Show some respect,

1808
02:01:36,723 --> 02:01:38,156
you are speaking of
my future husband ...

1809
02:01:39,025 --> 02:01:40,322
and why would l seek revenge on you?

1810
02:01:40,994 --> 02:01:45,226
You lied ... actually you
had fallen in love with me ...

1811
02:01:46,733 --> 02:01:50,726
and l paid you no heed and
that's what angered you.

1812
02:01:52,005 --> 02:01:53,666
To punish me you are
marrying that jackass ...

1813
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:55,731
correct, isn't it?

1814
02:01:57,744 --> 02:02:00,076
Shruti, where should l
place this DJ set-up?

1815
02:02:01,214 --> 02:02:02,272
Tell me quickly please.

1816
02:02:05,018 --> 02:02:06,349
At least answer my question.

1817
02:02:08,354 --> 02:02:10,345
Oh, there's a new problem,

1818
02:02:10,423 --> 02:02:11,685
the chicken hasn't arrived yet.

1819
02:02:12,692 --> 02:02:14,751
Hurry up.

1820
02:02:16,362 --> 02:02:19,331
Just this much ...
don't increase it.

1821
02:02:19,432 --> 02:02:21,730
Play some English music, there
are lots of foreigners here.

1822
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:25,061
Answer me ...

1823
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,237
you had fallen in love with me ...

1824
02:02:31,044 --> 02:02:32,341
you are just
embarrassed to admit it.

1825
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:35,710
Shruti Kakkar, the strong woman,

1826
02:02:35,882 --> 02:02:37,713
how could she get
trapped in emotions ... ya?

1827
02:02:41,321 --> 02:02:44,347
Love and business do
not go hand in hand ...

1828
02:02:44,757 --> 02:02:46,349
your famous business rule ...

1829
02:02:46,759 --> 02:02:47,817
you broke the rule ...

1830
02:02:48,394 --> 02:02:49,452
you fell in love ...

1831
02:02:49,729 --> 02:02:50,787
what could l do?

1832
02:02:50,897 --> 02:02:53,161
Leave all my work and
attend to your feelings?

1833
02:02:53,866 --> 02:02:56,096
Why are you punishing me?
lt's your mistake ... no?

1834
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:59,328
Bittoo, l have to get ready ... this
is not the time for this nonsense.

1835
02:02:59,405 --> 02:03:00,463
This is the best time ...

1836
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:01,798
answer me ...

1837
02:03:06,312 --> 02:03:07,745
Always wrong timing ...

1838
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:10,745
l've not yet got an answer to my
question, and he is calling ...

1839
02:03:11,784 --> 02:03:13,376
Who gave you
permission to cut my phone ...

1840
02:03:13,953 --> 02:03:15,011
how dare you?

1841
02:03:15,121 --> 02:03:16,748
l don't need anyone's permission.

1842
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:20,753
Answer my question first.
Answer me. - Leave the phone.

1843
02:03:20,827 --> 02:03:27,289
Answer my question first.
Answer me. - Leave the phone.

1844
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:40,140
That's enough.

1845
02:03:44,784 --> 02:03:48,948
You think the entire
world revolves around you.

1846
02:03:51,391 --> 02:03:52,449
Your answer ...

1847
02:03:52,825 --> 02:03:53,883
your punishment.

1848
02:03:55,028 --> 02:03:56,791
l am getting married for myself ...

1849
02:03:57,864 --> 02:03:59,525
for my safe secure future ...

1850
02:04:00,533 --> 02:04:01,795
for my parents ...

1851
02:04:02,869 --> 02:04:04,393
... they want to see me settled ...

1852
02:04:05,938 --> 02:04:09,999
l'm marrying a guy who is the
perfect life partner for me.

1853
02:04:10,877 --> 02:04:12,174
With whom l'll be happy.

1854
02:04:16,182 --> 02:04:17,240
Yes ...

1855
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:18,812
l made a mistake ...

1856
02:04:19,886 --> 02:04:21,183
l fell in love with you ...

1857
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:26,190
Shruti Kakkar was glued to
the Business Rulebook ...

1858
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:28,254
everything was planned!

1859
02:04:30,196 --> 02:04:31,561
But l planned using my brain,

1860
02:04:32,498 --> 02:04:33,829
and discounted the heart.

1861
02:04:34,834 --> 02:04:35,892
l fell in love with you ...

1862
02:04:37,937 --> 02:04:39,495
if you did not, you did not.

1863
02:04:41,841 --> 02:04:43,832
You think l'll
chase you for revenge?

1864
02:04:45,578 --> 02:04:47,341
l'm not a child like you!

1865
02:04:49,449 --> 02:04:50,507
Got your answer?

1866
02:04:51,217 --> 02:04:52,275
Happy?

1867
02:04:53,419 --> 02:04:56,286
Shruti loves you and you
paid no heed to her ...

1868
02:04:57,223 --> 02:04:58,349
Now are you a hero?

1869
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:03,023
ls that why you
were after an answer?

1870
02:05:21,547 --> 02:05:23,174
Hello ... how are you?

1871
02:05:24,117 --> 02:05:25,516
No it got cut by mistake.

1872
02:05:38,464 --> 02:05:43,629
My Friend

1873
02:05:45,905 --> 02:05:50,433
My Friend

1874
02:06:32,952 --> 02:06:38,219
My Friend

1875
02:06:38,324 --> 02:06:39,450
My Friend

1876
02:06:39,525 --> 02:06:40,583
l've checked the lights ...

1877
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:42,389
everything is fit just
dimmer number six is gone ...

1878
02:06:42,562 --> 02:06:44,120
should l put all tube
lights on number five?

1879
02:06:45,965 --> 02:06:50,334
Sir, are you OK?

1880
02:06:52,972 --> 02:06:54,030
l am a bloody donkey.

1881
02:09:10,643 --> 02:09:11,701
Hello, Chetan ...

1882
02:09:12,845 --> 02:09:14,107
l'm Bittoo ...

1883
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:16,739
Wake the fucc up ...
something important.

1884
02:09:29,195 --> 02:09:31,129
Hello ... how are you?

1885
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:39,195
What?

1886
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:44,137
What did he say?

1887
02:09:48,748 --> 02:09:49,806
Really?

1888
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:55,587
l'll speak to him right now.
How dare he? ldiot.

1889
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:00,759
Chetan, control ...

1890
02:10:01,293 --> 02:10:06,697
l'll beat him to a pulp. You
don't swear. Take it easy ...

1891
02:10:39,732 --> 02:10:41,495
You called Chetan?
- Yes.

1892
02:10:41,767 --> 02:10:43,530
You told him to step
aside ... Shruti is mine ...

1893
02:10:43,636 --> 02:10:44,694
Obviously!

1894
02:10:45,571 --> 02:10:46,765
Why did you tell him that?

1895
02:10:46,872 --> 02:10:48,305
l thought, let me
put him aside first,

1896
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,769
or else he will keep calling ...

1897
02:10:49,942 --> 02:10:51,466
and we won't be able to talk.

1898
02:10:52,778 --> 02:10:53,836
Tell me

1899
02:10:53,946 --> 02:10:56,210
whatever you told him ...
say it to my face.

1900
02:10:57,249 --> 02:11:00,741
l am a fool, an idiot, a donkey.

1901
02:11:00,886 --> 02:11:02,945
Everyone knows that ...
say something new.

1902
02:11:04,957 --> 02:11:06,948
l am a fool, to have
run away from your love.

1903
02:11:09,228 --> 02:11:13,324
l am an idiot who thought
that love would ruin my career,

1904
02:11:15,334 --> 02:11:16,528
and when l actually
realised everything,

1905
02:11:16,769 --> 02:11:19,966
l tried to play the
'Shaadi Mubarak' card.

1906
02:11:22,441 --> 02:11:23,965
But you are a bigger fool than l am,

1907
02:11:25,244 --> 02:11:26,905
you taught me everything
about business with so much love,

1908
02:11:26,979 --> 02:11:28,537
you could have taught me
about love with as much love.

1909
02:11:30,616 --> 02:11:33,244
You were in a hurry to find
the right life partner ...

1910
02:11:34,286 --> 02:11:36,447
and who did you find? That jackass!

1911
02:11:39,625 --> 02:11:42,287
lf you don't want to make me
your business partner then so be it.

1912
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:45,888
But don't keep me away from you.

1913
02:11:49,835 --> 02:11:51,894
There is no fun in life without you,

1914
02:11:53,305 --> 02:11:56,797
not looking at girls,
nor chowmein or tea.

1915
02:11:59,478 --> 02:12:02,572
Work with you is fun, and even
hanging out with you is fun.

1916
02:12:05,351 --> 02:12:09,481
l can work only because you
smile and say 'very good'.

1917
02:12:11,524 --> 02:12:13,651
Even my own father never
bothered to say 'good' to me.

1918
02:12:16,896 --> 02:12:19,387
Till there was happiness
in life, business was good.

1919
02:12:20,299 --> 02:12:22,392
When the happiness vanished,
business also sank.

1920
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:28,902
lf this happiness is called love,
then l am not afraid of it.

1921
02:12:30,376 --> 02:12:34,472
l will give you lots and lots of
love and take lots and lots from you.

1922
02:12:35,981 --> 02:12:37,039
Tell me, will you give me love?

1923
02:12:44,356 --> 02:12:45,618
No way ...

1924
02:12:46,692 --> 02:12:47,750
One minute ...

1925
02:12:49,995 --> 02:12:52,463
How are you?

1926
02:12:55,067 --> 02:12:57,399
How can you be good?

1927
02:12:59,338 --> 02:13:03,069
Bittoo's an idiot
to have blasted you.

1928
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:06,343
Yes, that's been sorted.

1929
02:13:10,583 --> 02:13:12,414
l am getting into a
partnership with Bittoo ...

1930
02:13:14,954 --> 02:13:16,421
And this time it's for life.

1931
02:13:18,023 --> 02:13:21,618
lf he tries any tricks l
am going to break his legs,

1932
02:13:23,562 --> 02:13:24,620
but not the partnership.

1933
02:13:27,399 --> 02:13:31,392
Now, obviously our
wedding is cancelled.

1934
02:13:38,877 --> 02:13:39,935
He cut it.

1935
02:13:40,045 --> 02:13:41,637
How dare he cut off your call?

1936
02:13:41,747 --> 02:13:42,805
What are you doing?

1937
02:13:42,881 --> 02:13:43,973
You didn't finish speaking
and he cut off your call.

1938
02:13:44,083 --> 02:13:46,517
How does it matter? Forget Chetan.

1939
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:49,779
OK, l've forgotten him.

1940
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:56,419
Finish the business you started.

1941
02:13:56,996 --> 02:13:58,054
Business?

1942
02:13:58,397 --> 02:14:01,764
What you were saying ... after that?

1943
02:14:03,135 --> 02:14:05,865
l've spoken full and final ...
nothing beyond that ...

1944
02:14:06,839 --> 02:14:07,897
Nothing?

1945
02:14:10,943 --> 02:14:13,002
Do l have to teach
you everything in life?

1946
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:04,461
Hello? - No one can find
Shruti ... do you know where she is?

1947
02:15:04,697 --> 02:15:05,755
Why should l tell you?

1948
02:15:05,864 --> 02:15:07,559
Preeti Maam has broken her heel ...

1949
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:08,826
ls Shruti Maam a cobbler?

1950
02:15:12,171 --> 02:15:14,469
Preeti Maam is crying
about her broken heel.

1951
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:16,474
l am on my way.
- Hurry up please.

1952
02:15:17,142 --> 02:15:18,734
Tell her not to
worry ... l am on my way.

1953
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:19,902
OK.
