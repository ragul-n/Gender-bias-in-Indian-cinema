1
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,366
Engaging target.

2
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,696
Firing.

3
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:16,557
We just took down a
Russian MiG, Mr. President.

4
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:20,394
Safe to say we are engaged
in a shooting war with Russia.

5
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:23,730
We're enforcing a no-fly zone.

6
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,218
We just took down

7
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,552
two more MiGs, sir.

8
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:28,554
I think our message is being received.

9
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,022
No doubt.

10
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,928
This is turning into a rout, Mr. President.

11
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:40,932
Shall I

12
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:44,636
reach out to the Russian
foreign minister and

13
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:47,138
see if maybe they're ready to talk it over?

14
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,840
Not yet.

15
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:51,443
We have the Russians'
battle plans. I assume

16
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,578
the Ukrainians have already
been briefed, General Kohl.

17
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,879
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,481
Their forces are spread over Luhansk,

19
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,316
Kharkiv, and Mariupol,

20
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,318
the three Ukrainian cities
listed in the Russian

21
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,354
order of battle as prospective
first-strike targets

22
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,089
- in a ground offensive.
- With American advisors

23
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,058
and equipment embedded in their ranks.

24
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:09,828
If Maria Ostrov wants to escalate,

25
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:11,796
it sounds like we're ready.

27
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:57,850
Hello?

28
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,669
Hello, Mr. Goodwin, this is Arkady

29
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,938
from the Russian Fur Exchange.

30
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,272
Good to hear from you.

31
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,576
We have your second order

32
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,145
shipping in 24 hours.

33
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:10,047
Any special instructions?

34
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:12,581
Monday delivery.

35
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:17,561
Thank you.

36
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,897
You need to get me out of Russia. Please.

37
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:21,165
Please.

38
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,500
I hear you, Arkady. I should go.

39
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,169
Please! Get me out...

40
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,237
Get me out of Russia. Just get me out.

41
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,872
Hey, hey, listen to me.

42
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,374
I'm taking care of it.

43
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,742
Now hang up the damn phone.

44
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,190
So?

45
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,392
Well, just briefed the DNI.

46
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:50,260
Good, now you need to brief the president.

47
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,895
Well, Director Ware's already on his way

48
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:54,097
to the Oval Office. And
Dmitri is an incredible asset.

49
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,365
Yeah, we need to talk about

50
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,701
exfiltrating him, because
once the Russians are ambushed

51
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,803
- I hear you, yeah.
- ...at Mariupol, they will know there's a mole

52
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:01,404
- in their upper ranks, and then...
- Yes.

53
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,807
- It won't be long before they...
- Henry, Henry, I agree with you.

54
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,342
My next stop is CIA.

55
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,943
Director Ware already
approved the exfiltration.

56
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:09,812
I... Clock's ticking, I got to go.

57
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:18,154
What have you got, Ephraim?

58
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,690
HUMINT says the Russians are planning

59
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,259
a massive assault on Mariupol,

60
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,829
one of the three cities on
their list of contingencies.

61
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,297
What exactly is the source

62
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:29,365
of this intelligence, Director Ware?

63
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,968
It's from our asset inside
Maria Ostrov's inner circle.

64
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:35,505
I think at this point we
can share with the secretary

65
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,173
that this asset

66
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:39,841
is being handled by her husband.

67
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,346
Never a dull moment.

68
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:45,915
How confident are Dr.
McCord and DIA in this asset?

69
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,717
- Highly, sir.
- Good.

70
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,819
Recommend moving all nonessential resources

71
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,588
from Kharkiv and Luhansk to
Mariupol as quickly as possible.

72
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:55,024
Yes, sir.

73
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,559
Ephraim, could you wait a minute?

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,894
Of course.

75
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,797
As you'd expect, our NATO
allies are eager for us

76
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:03,332
to end this conflict before it expands.

77
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,935
Yes. Chancellor Schulz is
at the top of my call sheet.

78
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,570
Europe's concern is understandable.

79
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,272
Russia's still withholding oil and gas,

80
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:11,073
wreaking havoc on their infrastructure.

81
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,442
So let's propose a
cease-fire before hundreds

82
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:16,145
of Ukrainian and Russian
soldiers die at Mariupol.

83
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:17,480
That's on Maria Ostrov.

84
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,215
I'm not going to appease her, Bess.

85
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,783
What kind of message would that send?

86
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:23,919
That we want to tamp down hostilities,

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,123
put this genie back in the bottle. I...

88
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:28,424
Let's give Ostrov a way out.

89
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,658
Why should we?

90
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,260
We have the strategic advantage here.

91
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,195
- And we're going to take it.
- But let's not

92
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,464
forget how we got here.

93
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:38,200
- We cyber-attacked Moscow.
- So what would you propose?

94
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,768
- Unprovoked.
- Telling the world that

95
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,570
Bozek duped us into attacking

96
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:42,671
- the Russians...
- I'm just saying it's in the mix.

97
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,006
so we would get behind Ukraine?

98
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,274
It complicates the situation.

99
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,209
I can't live in complications.

100
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,944
The world doesn't know any of that.

101
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,346
All they know is that the U.S.

102
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,481
- is standing up to Russian aggression.
- Which is

103
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:54,550
a righteous cause, no
matter the warped path

104
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,719
- that brought us here.
- Well, righteous that may be, but after Mariupol,

105
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,023
Maria Ostrov may send in a million troops

106
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:03,926
that will overrun
Ukrainian and U.S. forces,

107
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,862
and no amount of Intel will stop her then.

108
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,730
I understand your position, Bess.

109
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,567
But no talk of a cease-fire.

110
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,201
Are we clear?

111
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,002
Yes, sir.

112
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,172
Uh, in the meantime,

113
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,807
I-I would like to see

114
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,009
the profiling that CIA has on Maria Ostrov.

115
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,280
How much have we got, Ephraim?

116
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,048
Mrs. Ostrov's a newbie on the world scene.

117
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,517
Not a whole lot.

118
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:29,851
This is exactly my point.

119
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:33,188
But I was there when she
made a play for power.

120
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,658
She does not strike me as
someone to be trifled with.

121
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,860
Due respect, I saw the video.

122
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,563
So she gave a good speech.

123
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:44,566
Intelligence is of the opinion that

124
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,935
Maria Ostrov is a puppet
of the Russian generals.

125
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,236
A popular prop

126
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:50,105
with the right last name.

127
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,807
With no political or military background

128
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,110
and very little formal education.

129
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,946
As far as we're concerned,
she's a former beauty queen

130
00:09:57,947 --> 00:09:59,914
- who married up.
- That's all right.

131
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,575
I'd still like to get into it.

132
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:07,889
Give the Secretary of State
whatever she wants, Ephraim.

133
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,958
Of course, Mr. President.

134
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,559
Great, thanks.

135
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,562
♪ I feel the night explode ♪

136
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,366
♪ When we're together ♪

137
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:23,338
This is the woman who's
starting World War III?

138
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,606
Looks like she had a little work done

139
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,776
between Teen Miss
Volgograd and Miss Moscow.

140
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:32,513
Nose job. Breast augmentation.

141
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:35,283
You nervous about saying breasts
or just objectifying women?

142
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,018
Hey, she's the one chopping up her body

143
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,986
and putting herself into beauty pageants.

144
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,055
If you're trying to land
a major world leader,

145
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:42,323
you better to work it.

146
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,425
I disagree.

147
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,093
I think Pavel Ostrov would have done

148
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:48,596
anything she told him to. Nose job,

149
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,731
- boob job or not.
- The woman did

150
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,267
seize the throne of one of
the most powerful nations

151
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:54,902
on the planet.

152
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,437
Without breaking a sweat.

153
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,938
♪ Tell it from the stars ♪

154
00:10:57,939 --> 00:10:59,340
♪ Tell it to my heart ♪

155
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,375
So what else do we have on her?

156
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,277
Like Director Ware said, not much.

157
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,778
It really looks like she married up

158
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,180
and never looked back.

159
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,681
That's not helpful.

160
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,984
Her family's working class from Volgograd.

161
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,619
Father worked in a sawmill.

162
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,254
Yet at 19 she moved into

163
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,555
a pretty sweet apartment in Moscow.

164
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:16,156
Yeah, but she was a beauty queen

165
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:18,225
and working as a model. I mean,
what's so strange about that?

166
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,027
Modeling locally in Moscow
couldn't cover her rent,

167
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,195
let alone lifestyle.

168
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:22,496
- Okay?
- Did she have a boyfriend?

169
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:24,443
- Can't find anything.
- She was first lady

170
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:26,233
for six years. If she did,
it would have come out.

171
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,434
Unless she didn't want it to.

172
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,036
Or she had a sugar daddy.

173
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,571
Someone paid for that surgery,

174
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,172
yet there's no record of it.

175
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:34,408
Again, meaning she didn't
want there to be one.

176
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,511
This is all mildly interesting,

177
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,446
but I don't see how it helps our situation.

178
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:40,747
I don't either.

179
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:43,650
But events can easily spin out of control.

180
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:47,321
If there is something that we
can use to leverage this woman,

181
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:49,022
I want it. Short of that,

182
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:50,924
I want to understand her better.

183
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,159
Unfortunately, all her

184
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,593
financial documents going back to that time

185
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:55,429
are through numbered Swiss bank accounts.

186
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,732
Well, that's pretty sophisticated

187
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,934
for a simple girl from Volgograd.

188
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,602
Yeah. But good luck

189
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,938
getting anything out of the Swiss.

190
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,706
That is so weird that
you would just say that.

191
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:13,112
You're making it my job to
get something out of the Swiss?

192
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:16,615
Find a way.

193
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,956
Oh. Did you strain your back?

194
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,290
Ah, of course.

195
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,926
Well, now it is officially
Christmas season.

196
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:29,996
Yeah, if we make it to Christmas.

197
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:31,898
A little dramatic there, dude.

198
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:33,633
There are memes all over
BuzzFeed about Russia

199
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,968
going nuclear over Ukraine.

200
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:36,736
Yeah, I saw one with Maria Ostrov

201
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:38,438
shooting nuclear missiles out of her eyes

202
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,807
- at Mom and President Dalton.
- Well, that's subtle.

203
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,709
They're saying that this our generation's

204
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,644
Cuban Missile Crisis.

205
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,646
Yeah, and that turned out fine.

206
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:52,952
Okay, listen, guys. I know it's scary.

207
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:55,088
But there are a lot of
good people, including Mom,

208
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,824
who are working really hard to
make sure we get to celebrate

209
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,259
plenty more Christmases. That said...

210
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,496
Listen, do not

211
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,798
decorate this tree until Mom gets home.

212
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,400
- Boo!
- If we want to avoid

213
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,869
World War III here.

214
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,304
- Hmm.
- Boo.

215
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,372
- Okay?
- Hmm. Not sure if this

216
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,308
is good or terrifying.

217
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,009
- What?
- It's a news alert.

218
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,612
It's about a battle that happened in some

219
00:13:19,613 --> 00:13:22,715
Ukrainian city... Marr... upol.

220
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,617
- What about it?
- Says

221
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:27,253
"Ukraine, aided by American advisors,

222
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,621
overwhelmed the Russian forces

223
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:32,091
and beat them back in a
decisive blow to Russia."

224
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:33,559
Boom.

225
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,495
Um, oh, you know what?
I have a faculty meeting.

226
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:37,696
I got to go.

227
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,831
- At 9:00 at night?
- See you guys later.

228
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,102
Yeah, we're a freak show.

229
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,871
- Hey, hi.
- Hey, babe.

230
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,274
Hey, have you heard about Mariupol?

231
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:51,977
Yeah. It's a big win for Ukraine. And us.

232
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,513
- Thanks to your asset.
- You...

233
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:56,682
I was finally officially read in.

234
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:58,350
Then you know he's pretty much blown.

235
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,651
You haven't gotten him out?

236
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,053
- No, I...
- Go.

237
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:02,254
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

238
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,822
Oh, wait, take this, take this, take this,

239
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:05,891
- it's freezing out there.
- Good night.

240
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,660
- Hey, gang.
- Hi. - Hey.

241
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:11,296
Wow, look at that.

242
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:13,232
Hey, at least we know
the secretary of state

243
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,067
thinks the world is safe
enough to leave work.

244
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:16,902
Okay.

245
00:14:16,903 --> 00:14:19,871
On that note, I'm gonna
go play Call of Duty.

246
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:20,722
Wha...

247
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:23,298
That's a great way to
take your mind off war.

248
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,878
Mom, Does Dad have a
secret job or something?

249
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,814
What? No.

250
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:31,650
You people are the worst liars.

251
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,051
Oh, I...

252
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:34,619
I-I just...

253
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,722
I just want to decorate the tree.

254
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:40,592
I know. String popcorn?

255
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,127
- Yes.
- Yeah.

256
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,563
So why aren't you running away from me

257
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:47,065
like the rest of the family?

258
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,768
Well, um...

259
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,202
I met a guy.

260
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:53,171
Really?

261
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:54,372
Yes.

262
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:55,774
Do tell.

263
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,475
Just one date, settle down.

264
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:58,777
But we are

265
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,079
in negotiations for the second.

266
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,248
I'm gonna need a little more

267
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,350
- than that.
- Okay. Um...

268
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:07,485
His name is Jareth,

269
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,754
and he's auditing my psych class,

270
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,690
but he is a graduate student
doing applied physics.

271
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:13,691
He's a total brainiac.

272
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,660
He's British.

273
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:19,330
And he's nice. He's got big eyes

274
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:22,466
and a really cute butt. He's tall...

275
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:10,713
DA.

276
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,599
Hey.

277
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,969
I just got off the
phone with Dmitri Petrov.

278
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,205
He'd like to know why we're
hanging him out to dry.

279
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:10,507
- And so would I.
- The situation has changed.

280
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:14,110
You said that the DNI signed
off on the exfiltration

281
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:15,779
and you were coordinating with CIA.

282
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,813
Why would that change?

283
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,114
Things are fluid.

284
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:19,770
In case you haven't
noticed, we're in a war.

285
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,518
I noticed that we crushed
the Russians at Mariupol

286
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,953
based on the intelligence
that Dmitri provided.

287
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:27,190
- I know.
- You know? Do you also know Maria Ostrov

288
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,692
arrested her own assistant for it?

289
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:31,261
Because it's only a matter
of time before they figure out

290
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:33,430
that he's the wrong guy
and they come after Dmitri.

291
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:34,998
So I really don't care what's changed.

292
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:37,167
We need to get him out of there now.

293
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,543
Unfortunately, we don't have the resources

294
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,573
- in place to do that.
- Okay.

295
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:47,810
We are the most powerful nation
this world has ever known.

296
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,646
We can't get this kid on a plane?

297
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,649
The Pentagon has pulled most
of our assets in country.

298
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,884
Until the situation improves,
I'm afraid Dmitri is caught

299
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:55,577
behind enemy lines.

300
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:57,453
Get him to our embassy in
Moscow or to a safe house.

301
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:00,022
We must have someone that can pick him up.

302
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:02,325
Send me in, for God's sake.

303
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:05,061
But don't let this kid
who's done everything

304
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,896
we've asked of him die for no reason.

305
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,531
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,765
Are you?

307
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:12,301
Are you really? Because
it's starting to seem

308
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:14,437
like that was part of the plan all along.

309
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,305
When we first met, I
told you that Intelligence

310
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:17,940
was a vast network.

311
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,076
You're at the bottom of that flowchart.

312
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,410
Now it's your duty to stand down.

313
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,293
Sounds like your boss and President Dalton

314
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:46,029
have gotten themselves into
quite a contretemps with Russia.

315
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,798
That's one way of looking
at it, Mr. Ambassador.

316
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,232
Another is that we're staring

317
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,767
down the barrel of a nuclear war.

318
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:54,804
I speak for all of Switzerland
in saying that I sincerely hope

319
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,139
we can avoid that.

320
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,142
Of course. But, unfortunately,
bare-knuckled diplomacy

321
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,211
and a lot of dead soldiers

322
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,879
are most likely going to decide this one.

323
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:07,183
What do you want?

324
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:08,451
Belrose Banc Suisse

325
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:10,887
has Maria Ostrov's entire financial history

326
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,489
going back 20 years.

327
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,390
In private, numbered accounts.

328
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:15,959
We'd like all of it.

329
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,927
Switzerland has cooperated
with the U.S. when asked

330
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:20,597
about the financial records
of American citizens.

331
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,332
But for a foreign national,

332
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,567
- a head of state, no less?
- I know it's a big ask.

333
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,002
It's impossible.

334
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:28,771
I also know you'd like a
Winter Olympics in Gstaad.

335
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:31,240
My government's support would
go a long way toward sticking

336
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,242
that landing.

337
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:34,911
A lovely offer.

338
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:38,715
But the Federal Council
will laugh in my face.

339
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:42,585
We will not participate
in such improprieties.

340
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:45,488
Impropr... Really?

341
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:46,923
Hey, we're not done.

342
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,625
I know historically your
little mountain fiefdom

343
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:50,960
has managed to stay neutral

344
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,663
in the middle of every European conflict.

345
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:56,632
Two world wars, Fascists, Nazis.

346
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,601
That worked out great for you.

347
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,503
With millions of people
from other countries

348
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:01,804
dying for your freedom.

349
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:04,340
But, see, now, now there are B-2 bombers,

350
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,208
EMP strikes, ICBMs

351
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,244
with nuclear payloads!

352
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:11,113
This time, the chaos
is taking you down, too.

353
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:13,282
So if preventing World War
III doesn't motivate you,

354
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:15,584
how about a little naked self-interest?!

355
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:18,921
Ma'am.

356
00:20:18,922 --> 00:20:21,190
I know. I know. Every NATO ally

357
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:22,725
is gunning for a cease-fire.

358
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:24,226
They're calling me at home.

359
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:25,928
How do they even get that number?

360
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:27,062
This isn't about the cease-fire.

361
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:29,531
Oh, crap. That thing.

362
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:31,634
It's Maria Ostrov. Five minutes ago.

363
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,002
America claims Russia

364
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,971
hacked President Dalton's
Air Force One plane.

365
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,640
But, really, it was the United States

366
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:41,176
and Ukraine colluding together.

367
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:44,880
These devious nations
created a fake hack story

368
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,350
as a pretense for America's
imperialist aggression

369
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,352
and to keep ethnic Russians

370
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:52,721
in Eastern Ukraine imprisoned

371
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:55,290
by the criminal Bozek administration.

372
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,661
I challenge the warmonger
President Dalton to deny it.

373
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,296
Russia will not be intimidated...

374
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,965
That's enough. I get the gist.

375
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,299
How do you want to respond?

376
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,601
By resigning and crawling under a rock.

377
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:07,769
But since that's not an option,

378
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,571
let's do a full staff meeting now.

379
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,407
Before I get summoned by
our warmongering president.

380
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:15,743
Jay's still meeting with
the Swiss ambassador.

381
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,283
Jay. Jay.

382
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,385
- Mr. Ambassador. Bonjour.
- Madam Secretary, your policy man

383
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,853
needs a lesson in diplomacy.

384
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:27,055
Jay's very passionate. If
it makes any difference,

385
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,757
he yells at me, too.

386
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,725
But here's the thing.

387
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,895
Events are unfolding quickly,
and we need every advantage

388
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,998
we can get. Specifically,
Maria Ostrov's bank records.

389
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,534
You might have noticed
we're pretty good at hacking,

390
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:42,003
though I'm not admitting
anything about what happened

391
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:43,905
in Moscow. But we're
gonna get those records

392
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,374
one way or the other. And given

393
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,409
the state of the world right now,

394
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,745
I think you want to stay on our good side.

395
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,281
So you tell that to your Federal Council.

396
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,215
Thanks so much for coming in.

397
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:02,790
- I'd say pardon my French, but...
- Things just got

398
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,759
real complicated, and I have to go listen

399
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,227
to the president freak out right now.

400
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:08,128
So you just keep the
heat on the Swiss, okay?

401
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:08,730
Oui, oui.

402
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:09,831
- Madam Secretary...
- White House.

403
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,866
Now. Way ahead of you.

404
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,602
And I'm obsolete.

405
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:17,638
How the hell did Russia find
out that Ukraine was involved

406
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,140
in the Air Force One hack?

407
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:20,842
Do we have a leaker, Director Ware?

408
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,276
We're investigating, sir,

409
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:24,045
though it could've come
from the Ukrainians.

410
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,280
Well, as much as I would
love to put someone in front

411
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,216
of a firing squad for this,

412
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,451
the real question is,
where do we go from here?

413
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:31,519
Our official response

414
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,487
is to deflect any questions

415
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:36,757
and say that any pertinent information

416
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:38,059
remains classified.

417
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,727
So, basically, an admission
that it's all true.

418
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,365
Thanks, Ephraim.

419
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,399
Thank you, Mr. President.

420
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,667
Madam Secretary.

421
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:54,841
I need some air.

422
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:56,911
I'm guessing

423
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,812
our allies aren't even
pretending to support us

424
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,948
- on this anymore.
- We can't

425
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:03,951
continue fighting if we
look like the aggressor.

426
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:05,986
You want to signal we're
open to peace talks.

427
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:07,221
The French, Germans,

428
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:10,224
the British, and just
about every other NATO ally

429
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:12,693
is pushing hard for a summit in Geneva.

430
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,094
From a position of weakness.

431
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,562
I'm not so sure that's true.

432
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:18,165
My read:

433
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,667
Maria Ostrov got frustrated
on the battlefield,

434
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,169
so she made a lateral move

435
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,738
and she hit us on the diplomatic front.

436
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:26,607
You think she's ready to deal.

437
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:28,275
I think every minute she doesn't

438
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,577
order an all-out assault
and flatten every inch

439
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:33,747
of Eastern and Western Ukraine
is reason for encouragement.

440
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,249
Okay.

441
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,052
If the Russians agree,
we'll go to the table.

442
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:41,755
Drag the Ukrainians with us.

443
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:44,056
Yeah.

444
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,964
- ...chronological order.
- Elizabeth.

445
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:52,365
- That's it. Thanks.
- Okay.

446
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,467
Hey. I was in the middle
of planning a peace summit

447
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,369
- when you called.
- This won't take long.

448
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,038
So much for the victory lap

449
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,073
about getting the Russians to come along.

450
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,542
And if you say that's my job,
I'm gonna punch you in the nose.

451
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:05,812
You get 'em to sign the damn
treaty, I'll do pirouettes.

452
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,380
Madam Secretary, I
believe you're acquainted

453
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:09,349
- with Dr. Henry McCord.
- Hi, babe.

454
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,851
Hi. Yeah, we've met once or twice.

455
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:16,456
And this is Jane Fellows,
his, uh, handler with DIA.

456
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,658
His handler. Of course.

457
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,026
Madam Secretary.

458
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:21,995
I'm glad to see you don't know who I am.

459
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:23,463
We actually prefer it that way.

460
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,699
Oh. Uh...

461
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,702
- so why do I need to know you now?
- I understand

462
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,804
that Mr. Jackson and the
president recently read you

463
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,773
into your husband's work with us

464
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,775
handling Captain Dmitri Petrov.

465
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,010
Hell of an asset.

466
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,745
Whose time is quickly running out.

467
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:41,514
We couldn't exfiltrate him from
Moscow, but we caught a break.

468
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,649
Petrov will be accompanying
General Doroshevich

469
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,385
to your peace talks in Geneva.

470
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:48,221
Sounds like a friendlier
environment to bring him in.

471
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,856
- What do you need from me?
- Just take

472
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,357
your husband to Geneva with you.

473
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,593
He's the only American Petrov trusts.

474
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:59,232
So Henry's cover will be as arm candy?

475
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,366
Well, look at the guy.

476
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:04,236
I can be there to pick
up Petrov personally.

477
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:07,338
Easy as that.

478
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:14,780
You seem pretty comfortable
with all this spy stuff.

479
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,482
I married one.

480
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:19,251
I'm glad you're getting your guy out.

481
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:22,021
Me, too. I-I find the whole

482
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:25,357
"not getting personally
invested" thing challenging.

483
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,759
I know.

484
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,694
It's one of the many
things I love about you,

485
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,630
Dr. Henry McCord.

486
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:35,367
That and your total arm-candy-ness.

487
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,973
Want to make out in the rose garden?

488
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,609
Maybe I can score a key
to the Lincoln Bedroom.

489
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,545
Oh, yeah. Mmm.

490
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,881
- Oh.
- Oh.

491
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,319
Okay.

492
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,488
Rain check?

493
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,789
Rain check.

494
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,829
So, what?

495
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,032
You found corruption in Maria
Ostrov's financial records?

496
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,034
Nope.

497
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,735
Better.

498
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,113
Okay, you guys are kind of freaking me out

499
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:24,848
with the "cat that ate the
canary" looks. What's...

500
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,286
What's better than corruption?

501
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,189
Try murdering Russia's beloved president.

502
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,159
Murder? A-As in...

503
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,328
murder?

504
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,662
Pavel Ostrov

505
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,164
- had an embolism.
- He did.

506
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,536
Okay. Let's hear it, Columbo.

507
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:47,405
Meet Dr. Yakov Maklovsky.

508
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,240
Maria Ostrov's plastic surgeon.

509
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,508
As far as we can tell, he was

510
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,344
her sponsor when she started
out as a beauty queen.

511
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,880
We think that he gave her
the rhinoplasty and the...

512
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,081
boob augmentation.

513
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,850
Which is probably how they met.

514
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,352
He also built his practice on

515
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,322
the open secret that he helped
turn her into Miss Russia.

516
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,591
The trail of wire transfers
that Maria made to the guy

517
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,259
extends over the next 20 years.

518
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,427
For nips, tucks, Botox.

519
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,195
Okay. Get-get to the murder part.

520
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:15,266
Two months ago, Maria makes
a million dollar "donation"

521
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,135
to Maklovsky's clinic. A week later,

522
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,470
Pavel Ostrov goes missing.

523
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,538
But he wasn't really missing.

524
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,306
Right. DIA uncovered that he was getting

525
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,208
a tummy tuck in a Moscow hospital.

526
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,178
That same Intel reveals that his surgeon

527
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,913
was none other than Dr. Maklovsky.

528
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,751
Uh, interesting

529
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,755
- but that's a pretty tenuous connection.
- Well,

530
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,590
does it make it a little less tenuous

531
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,226
if the day after Ostrov died

532
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,062
Maria transferred another million dollars

533
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,198
into Maklovsky's account?

534
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,668
A little. That's a lot of rubles.

535
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,071
Well, it would be very nice to get this...

536
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,307
Maklovsky in a room, huh?

537
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,909
- That's gonna be hard.
- He's dead.

538
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,911
Killed in a violent mugging in Moscow

539
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,980
one week after Pavel Ostrov died.

540
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,748
Okay, but wait a second.

541
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:09,153
We still don't have anything
that directly connects Maria

542
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,855
- or Maklovsky...
- Except this.

543
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,692
DIA's source in the hospital
was able to get us a list

544
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,727
of every prescription
that Maklovsky wrote during

545
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,730
that two-week period,
including one for Progestafil.

546
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,433
A rarely used, injectable, blood coagulant.

547
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,802
NIH said that in extreme doses,

548
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,905
it could cause an embolism

549
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,441
in someone who recently had surgery.

550
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:35,646
Official reports say Mr.
Ostrov died in his sleep.

551
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,948
Meaning, if we're right,

552
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:41,818
it's probable that the
death blow was delivered

553
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:44,086
by Maria Ostrov.

554
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:48,725
So,

555
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:52,362
Maria Ostrov wants to
get rid of her husband

556
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:55,198
so that she can take over
the Russian presidency.

557
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:59,002
And she uses Pavel's
surgery as an opportunity

558
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,839
to enlist her old doctor
friend to set things up

559
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,209
so that her husband appears

560
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,447
to die of post-surgical complications.

561
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,717
And then she pays the good doctor

562
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,319
two million dollars for his troubles.

563
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,388
And Maria could easily

564
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,857
have had her goons take
the good doctor out, leaving

565
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,992
no one left alive who knows what she did.

566
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:26,856
Pavel Ostrov was the Ronald Reagan

567
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:28,364
of recent Russian history.

568
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,134
He was their most popular
leader of the last,

569
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:34,637
oh, 50 years, so...

570
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:37,907
If it ever got out that Maria
killed him, she'd be done.

571
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:40,009
The problem is...

572
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,045
it's all circumstantial.

573
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,647
All right, see if you can get your hands

574
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:45,882
on Pavel Ostrov's autopsy.

575
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:51,020
If we want to stick it
to Maria Ostrov in Geneva,

576
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:53,622
we're gonna need proof.

577
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:10,515
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

578
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:13,590
President Bozek sent
Foreign Minister Melnik

579
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:16,127
to represent Ukraine in his place.

580
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:18,285
At his country's most consequential moment,

581
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:20,134
Bozek bails.

582
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,635
Just like he did from his damn plane.

583
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,904
Maybe he's scared we'll
ship him to The Hague.

584
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,139
Well, he should be.

585
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,407
Let's just hope

586
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,043
that Melnik and the Ukrainians
are ready to play ball.

587
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,544
Don't worry about it.

588
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:33,414
I'll bash a bat over his head if I have to.

589
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,887
You make contact with Dmitri?

590
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:41,889
Yup.

591
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,691
Hell of a lot easier than Moscow.

592
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,726
Called his hotel room.

593
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:47,961
He's waiting for instructions.

594
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,463
Good.

595
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:51,432
We sit tight till the talks are over,

596
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,900
and then, it's a simple extraction.

597
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,002
He reiterated that he wants
me there at the pickup.

598
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,371
Oh, as long as you're still okay with that.

599
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,373
Just tell me where and when.

600
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:03,010
We've chosen the corner of Rue
Agasse and Avenue des Jardins.

601
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,245
It's quiet, residential.

602
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:08,048
Standard procedure is...

603
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,351
There'll be a three-minute window.

604
00:31:11,352 --> 00:31:15,322
If for any reason, he's
not there, we abort.

605
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,457
But I'm not foreseeing any problems.

606
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,593
Good.

607
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:22,762
Listen...

608
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,198
about going over your head.

609
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:28,635
- I-I-I wouldn't...
- Oh, you mean, to the, uh,

610
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,136
president of the United
States, your old friend?

611
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:33,740
Look, if you want to get
into it, that wasn't just

612
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,108
going over my head.

613
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,243
That was pole vaulting the
entire chain of command.

614
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,746
I'm sorry if that made
things difficult for you.

615
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:41,915
Don't expect a Christmas
card from my supervisors,

616
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,284
but... I get it.

617
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,655
Look, just about everyone
in this line of work

618
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,624
is crystal clear about their patriotism.

619
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,960
At the expense of their humanity sometimes.

620
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:56,696
And I'd put myself at
the front of that class.

621
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,865
You're different.

622
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:02,936
I'm not sure if that's a compliment.

623
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:05,638
Your conscience may not make you

624
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,607
the ideal spy,

625
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:10,743
but it certainly makes you a better person.

626
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:13,980
Let's not breathe too easy yet. Uh,

627
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:16,781
I'll let you know when
we have the green light.

628
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,986
I hear our Ukrainian

629
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:22,255
friends needed a little hand holding.

630
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,056
Let's just say we took a stroll

631
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:26,159
through all the possible
outcomes for their country

632
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,027
if they didn't agree to our terms.

633
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,629
Nothing like the threat of annihilation

634
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,397
to make people choose wisely.

635
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:34,200
Unfortunately, CIA and NSA were unable

636
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,235
to find proof that Maria killed Ostrov.

637
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:38,604
It's still a compelling
circumstantial case.

638
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:41,741
Not without the smoking gun.

639
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:44,176
Shame.

640
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:46,112
Foreign Minister Melnik, I'm glad Ukraine

641
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:48,814
and the United States were
able to see eye to eye.

642
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:50,516
I prefer eye for an eye.

643
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:53,018
But, yes, we'll sign away
half our beloved country.

644
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,286
Secretary McCord

645
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,554
was quite persuasive.

646
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,728
Good.

647
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:05,030
Eastern Ukraine will
become an autonomous state

648
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,333
with its borders along
the north of the Black Sea,

649
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:10,035
from Luhansk to Odessa Oblast.

650
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,770
A puppet of Russia.

651
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:14,006
An end to all United
States economic sanctions

652
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,575
on the Russian government as
well as on individual Russians.

653
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:19,244
An end to all travel bans,

654
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:22,247
except those on the United
States Terrorist Watch List.

655
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,550
Russia agrees to restore
gas and oil supplies

656
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:26,552
to all European Union countries,

657
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:28,687
effective immediately
and without interruption

658
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:32,424
for a minimum of 15 years.

659
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:34,059
And that's everything.

660
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,627
President Ostrova, I think it's fair

661
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:37,462
to say that each side has made

662
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:38,897
painful compromises here.

663
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:41,066
Now the United States and Ukraine are ready

664
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,534
to sign this agreement.

665
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:47,104
Russia has one more requirement.

666
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,377
President Ostrova,

667
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:55,480
the United States stands
firmly behind these terms.

668
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:56,781
All I require

669
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:58,717
is truth.

670
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:01,353
President Dalton, you
must admit to the world

671
00:34:01,354 --> 00:34:03,521
that the United States attacked Moscow's

672
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:05,156
power grid without provocation.

673
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:08,325
And apologize.

674
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,063
You know that's never going to happen.

675
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:15,800
The world's only superpower
prostrates itself to no country.

676
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:18,937
Now let's sign this deal,
and end the aggression.

677
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,538
I can get

678
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:22,774
everything I want with aggression,

679
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,676
including all of Ukraine.

680
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:27,712
Or you can apologize.

681
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:29,047
It's up to you.

682
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,481
This is what happens

683
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,478
when you try to make a deal with the devil.

684
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:33,351
Enough.

685
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,852
I'd like the room.

686
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:39,857
So President Ostrova and I can talk.

687
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:42,527
Yes, let's talk, President Dalton.

688
00:34:42,528 --> 00:34:45,295
Elizabeth, please stay.

689
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,605
Might be a long flight home.

690
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:03,481
I think that Afghanistan
and Chechnya are still fresh

691
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:06,017
on the minds of your
people, President Ostrova.

692
00:35:06,018 --> 00:35:07,718
You underestimate their desire for peace.

693
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,822
You underestimate Russian pride.

694
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,892
After what we all know you did to Moscow,

695
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:18,195
my people are not afraid of you.

696
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:20,431
Apologize, or no deal.

697
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,767
I don't take orders from you.

698
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:25,702
Is okay.

699
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:30,007
I can go buy new watch
on Rue Du Rhone today.

700
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,242
Good afternoon.

701
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:33,110
You will sign this deal,

702
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:36,412
or my government will bury
you and your reputation.

703
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:40,584
What is this?

704
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:41,619
A threat?

705
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,187
One you would be wise to heed.

706
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:53,696
We know you murdered your husband.

707
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:06,310
We uncovered your relationship
with Dr. Yakov Maklovsky.

708
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:09,846
We know that he performed
your husband's stomach surgery,

709
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:11,782
and that his embolism was induced

710
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:13,850
by an injection of Progestafil.

711
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:16,286
We know about your
two-million-dollar payments

712
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:17,688
to Maklovsky.

713
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:23,126
And we know that you had him
killed to cover your tracks.

714
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,227
This is ridiculous.

715
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:26,129
And we have proof.

716
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,167
You got where you are by riding
your husband's popularity.

717
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:31,635
What will happen

718
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,770
when the Russian people
find out that you are guilty

719
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,072
- of murdering their hero?
- What will your generals do?

720
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:37,474
Your Chief of the General Staff

721
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:40,910
Doroshevich was your
husband's biggest loyalist.

722
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,946
You'll never survive it politically.

723
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:47,249
Or... you may simply not survive it.

724
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:53,056
Like my friend Anton Gorev.

725
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:55,258
Even if what you say is true,

726
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,560
I cannot go back to my
generals and tell them

727
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,263
I took this deal without
anything in return.

728
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:03,333
They know I am willing to have war.

729
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:05,768
Doroshevich wants war.

730
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:07,237
It is impossible.

731
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:11,341
You need to find a way to make it possible.

732
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:15,345
There may be one.

733
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,347
We know that you have a spy in

734
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:18,948
my inner circle.

735
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,850
If you tell us who that is,

736
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,553
I can take that to the generals,
and we will have a deal.

737
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:25,955
You've got it wrong.

738
00:37:25,956 --> 00:37:28,825
But even if you were right,

739
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:33,095
the United States would never
be seen to give up our own asset.

740
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:34,997
So we would each hold the other's secret.

741
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:37,900
I will never say publicly
that you agreed to it.

742
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:40,770
Just like you will never say
what you think I did to Pavel.

743
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:42,071
Mutually-assured destruction.

744
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:44,206
Yes, like our Cold War.

745
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,841
It will never happen.

746
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:48,511
Then I will send my
entire army into Ukraine.

747
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:52,014
And no matter how many you send
to die, nothing will stop us.

748
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,984
Do you really want to test
the full force of our military?

749
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:57,286
Because it hasn't gone well for you so far.

750
00:37:57,287 --> 00:37:58,888
My generals want this fight.

751
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:01,023
And we do not place the same restrictions

752
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:02,558
on our army as you do.

753
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,361
You mean a nuclear response?

754
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:08,564
Do you really want to test this?

755
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:10,832
Conrad?

756
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:15,137
We can't do this.

757
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:18,173
We can not do this.

758
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:19,808
She could be bluffing?

759
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,444
You want to bet a few hundred
thousand lives on that?

760
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:24,113
- You're right.
- Or millions?

761
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:25,714
Because that's what
we're talking about here.

762
00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:28,717
I think that we should
consider apologizing.

763
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:31,186
Roll over for Maria Ostrov
in front of the world?

764
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,488
I think it's an option.

765
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,123
It would be the single greatest
blow to American prestige

766
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:37,092
since Iraq. It would weaken us,

767
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,061
all while exposing our
classified cyber program.

768
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:42,164
You built your career
operating in the fog of war.

769
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:44,232
At CIA, you made nothing but hard choices

770
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:48,370
about greater good versus individual harm.

771
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:51,873
Obviously, you're thinking of Henry

772
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:55,043
and his relationship with the asset.

773
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,045
I'm sorry about that.

774
00:38:57,046 --> 00:39:01,216
But I have to put national security first,

775
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:04,685
and I need my Secretary
of State in lockstep.

776
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:16,197
30 seconds. Come on, Hank.

777
00:39:16,198 --> 00:39:18,433
We're good. It's just
right around this corner.

778
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,902
Hello?

779
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,078
There he is.

780
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,548
Copy that. Abort.

781
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:34,816
- Abort. Abort.
- What? No.

782
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:37,051
- What? No. Stop the van.
- Can't stop the van.

783
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:39,287
- Stop the damn van!
- Stand down. Stand down.

784
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:41,422
Who the hell are those guys?!

785
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:42,957
I don't know.

786
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,325
- Are they ours?
- I don't know.

787
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:46,661
Who are those guys? Are they Russians?!

788
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:48,429
- Did you just give him up?
- Calm down. You are...

789
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,398
- Did we give him up?! What is going on?
- No idea.

790
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:53,366
I need to know what the hell is going on!

791
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:07,434
Babe? Oh, thank God you're here. Listen,

792
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:10,256
they aborted Dmitri's
extraction at the last second,

793
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:12,224
and I think the Russians got him.

794
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:13,292
Jane won't tell me anything,

795
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:16,362
but I am sure that we
can still bring him in.

796
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:19,765
He's got to be in the city,
so, I need you to call the Swiss

797
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,533
- to ground all Russian planes...
- Henry.

798
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:23,636
...till we can get into it
with the president. Come on.

799
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:25,904
I know there's a call that you can make.

800
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:29,641
He's an American asset,
and he got made somehow.

801
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:33,212
Or we got cold feet. Anyway,
we can't just give up on him.

802
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:35,873
We've got to put up a fight.

803
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:42,788
You know something.

804
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:45,089
What is it?

805
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,261
It was part of the negotiation.

806
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:56,333
What?

807
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:02,407
Dmitri was...?

808
00:41:02,408 --> 00:41:04,242
No, no, no.

809
00:41:04,243 --> 00:41:06,211
That... You...

810
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:09,047
We would never negotiate
away one of our own assets.

811
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:10,782
That's not... that's not possible.

812
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,851
Please tell me that's not possible.

813
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:20,926
Oh, my God.

814
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:22,694
Oh, my God!

815
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:25,063
Did Conrad approve this?

816
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:26,865
Why couldn't you talk him out of it?

817
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:28,867
He's an old spy, for God's sake.

818
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:31,528
Why...? How could he do this?

819
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,675
Please tell me you didn't
agree to this, Elizabeth.

820
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:40,245
We had to think of the greater good.

821
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:42,046
You know

822
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,948
what they'll do to him.

823
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:45,750
I'm sorry.

824
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:47,852
No.

825
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,654
There's got to be another way.

826
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:50,707
I'm gonna go talk

827
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,009
to Conrad myself.

828
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,683
Elizabeth.

829
00:42:07,684 --> 00:42:09,618
Mr. President.

830
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:11,153
How's Henry holding up?

831
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,820
Um, he took a commercial flight back.

832
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:16,823
He made his feelings
known to me last night.

833
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:18,091
I'm sorry, sir.

834
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:20,593
That couldn't have been fun.

835
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:23,328
You will both regret this.

836
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:29,401
Well, at least they're consistent.

837
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:40,080
I do not disagree with a
single thing that Henry said.

838
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:42,182
If you had told me ten years ago

839
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:44,616
that I would have made that call...

840
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:55,795
Some partners in peace.

841
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:59,132
Sir, I just need to make a quick
phone call if that's all right?

842
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:01,433
- I'll catch up.
- Of course.

843
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:07,740
Hi. You've reached Henry McCord.

844
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:09,342
Please leave me a message.

845
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:11,344
Hey, baby. It's me.

846
00:43:11,345 --> 00:43:15,982
Just checking in again.
I left you a message.

847
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:17,950
Call me, please?

848
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:23,288
I love you.
