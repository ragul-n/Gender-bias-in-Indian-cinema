00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,250
One is smart while the other is stupid 

3
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,250
 "Mr. Sharma is careful." 

4
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,500

 I don't know.

 Aunty, what's that on the television?

00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,083
 Aunty, what's that on the television? 

61
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,208
 Look, remember we saw it back there.. 

62
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,916
Sweetheart, may you get a handsome husband 

63
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,291
 Give us some money, come on! 

64
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,958
 Give it. 

65
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,291
 Cheapskate. 

66
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,875
 Blow the horn. 

67
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,125
 Oh, my! I don't believe this. 

68
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,291
 These are the worst kind of people. 

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,083
 Sorry. 

70
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,875
 Come on. 

71
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,250
 Let's go, let's go. 

72
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,166
 What the.. 

73
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,666
Constable. - What is it? 

74
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,833
What is the problem? The traffic is jammed from both the ends. 

75
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,291
Madam, the traffic jam is going to get worse. 

76
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,666
A huge rally is going to pass by. - Rally? 

77
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,958
Yes. - But I am getting late. 

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,333
I am sorry, madam, but everyone will have to take a diversion. 

79
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,583
Okay. - What? 

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,375
 Everyone! Take the lane to your left. 

81
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,416
 Great. 

82
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,208
'Welcome to Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport..' - Your ID, please. 

83
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,083
 Sorry. 

84
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,041
 Excuse me, please. Sorry. 

85
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,791
 Ma'am, please. Do you mind? 

86
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,375
Please. Please. - Are we standing in the line for fun? 

87
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,458
Flight to Delhi. - Ma'am, you have missed your flight. 

88
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,750
 That's not possible, check it. 

89
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,250
Sorry, ma'am, but the gates are closed. 

90
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,541
 I can't help you. 

91
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,750
 You are late. 

92
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,375
 What do you mean by I am late? 

93
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,916
 Sorry, ma'am, airline rules. 

94
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,458
 Airline rules! 

95
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,250
Do you know how much business I give your airline? 

96
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,375
Me alone! - I really can't help you, please. 

97
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,541
When is the next flight? - 11 o'clock at night. 

98
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,791
 What? 

99
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,500
 Listen, I need to go right now. 

100
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,666
 Aren't there any flights before that? 

101
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,000
 Not before 11 o'clock. 

102
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,791
Only if you want to travel by any budget airlines. 

103
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,791
 Budget airlines. 

104
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,041
 One outlook money please 

105
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,541
 Rs.30, madam. 

106
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,583
 No change, madam. 

107
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,500
 You must have. Check again 

108
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,791
 I really don't have change ma'am 

109
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,083
How much? - For 1000. 

110
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,125
 Just a minute. 

111
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,083
 Here is your change, ma'am. 

112
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,791
 Thank you. 

113
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,458
 You are welcome. 

114
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,416
 25. 

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,166
 Do you want a different magazine? 

116
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,833
 Will they get married? 

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,208
 What do you think? 

118
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,541
 Saif-Kareena. 

119
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,541
 How would I know 

120
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,541
Well, If we don't know.. Why waste money on this magazine? 

121
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,375
Sir, you should have checked-in the bags. 

122
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,125
 But why, they're not that large! 

123
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,125
And check-in or cabin, finally all are going to reach Delhi. 

124
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,375
 What's the big deal. Relax. 

125
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,625
 Yes, hello. 

126
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,083
 I have already boarded. 

127
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,583
 No, keep talking. 

128
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,958
I am only traveling by the plane, not flying it. 

129
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,333
 Yes. 

130
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,083
 What? 

131
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,291
 I said 15 and not 12. 

132
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,208
 How much? Yes. 

133
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,458
Tell that boy we are here to do business.. 

134
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,750
 ..and not to waste time. 

135
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,833
 And we are not scared of him. 

136
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,125
 Tell him that's the final rate. 

137
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,833
And also add that 'no room for discussion' clause. 

138
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,291
 Yes. 

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,958
 Useless. 

140
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,208
These Mumbaikars think we Delhilites are fools. 

141
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,666
So? Delhi? - Delhi. 

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 That's a nice shirt. Is it readymade? 

143
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,625
Must be. Who gets clothes tailored nowadays? 

144
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,458
 'Fasten your seat belts.' 

145
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,208
 'And follow our instructions.' 

146
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,625
 Forget it. 

147
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,583
 When our lives are in danger.. 

148
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,750
..she will be the first one to jump out with her tray. 

149
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,083
And we'll be searching for the front door, middle door.. 

150
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:01,041
..and back door and reach the heaven's door 

151
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,791
 Heaven's door. Front door.. Get it? 

152
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,166
'It will come down from the panel above..' - That's okay. 

153
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,833
 '..and the effect of oxygen..' 

154
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,000
 Have you ever tried the oxygen mask? 

155
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,541
 Gives a nice high. 

156
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,500
 The mind feels light. 

157
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,083
 Try it sometime. 

158
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,166
So I explained to my wife, "What are you so concerned about?" 

159
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,041
 "You mind your own business." 

160
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,208
"As far as uncle is concerned, there is nothing to worry about." 

161
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,250
"We will lay a mattress on the terrace next to the parapet." 

162
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,375
Where? - Parapet 

163
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,250
 No, on the terrace. 

164
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,708
 Do you want to get uncle killed.. 

165
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,416
..by hanging him from the 30 feet high parapet? 

166
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,166
 You aren't paying attention 

167
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,625
What do you do? You're in a job or run your own business? 

168
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,833
I am at.. the IIT.. - so you're still studying. 

169
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,875
That's why you're not paying attention. 

170
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,041
Passengers are requested not to open their seat-belts.. 

171
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,458
 .. and stay at their seats.. 

172
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,541
..till the plane comes to a complete halt. - Hold this. 

173
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,833
 See you. 

174
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,041
Yes, hello. - Excuse me, sir, please be seated. 

175
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,791
 What's the big deal. 

176
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,958
We've landed after all. - Yes, Hello. 

177
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,500
 I have just landed. Where are you? 

178
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,375
 'Flight IT8..' 

179
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,625
 Vikram, I can't go on Monday. 

180
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,583
But if it's my birthday and I don't want to do anything.. 

181
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,208
..then I just don't seem to understand.. 

182
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,833
Listen, hold on. That's my bag. I'll call you. 

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,166
 Okay, I have got my bag. 

184
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,750
 Yes, I am coming out. 

185
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,666
 The battery is very low 

186
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,333
 I will see you there. 

187
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,625
 Yes, I am coming out. At exit no.. 

188
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,250
Welcome to Jaipur International airport. 

189
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,958
Welcome to Jaipur International airport. 

190
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,791
 I am in Jaipur! 

191
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,000
 Vikram, I am in Jaipur! 

192
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,291
 I don't know, let me call you back. 

193
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,625
I realized after I landed at the airport here. 

194
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,583
I don't know, there's some major technical problem.. 

195
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,125
..or something like that, at the Delhi airport. 

196
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,000
 All the flights are landing in Jaipur. 

197
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,208
 It's freezing here. 

198
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,541
 They did make the announcement.. 

199
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,875
 ..but I was asleep on the flight. 

200
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,291
 Hang on a minute. 

201
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,625
 It's freezing. 

202
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,291
 Listen, don't worry. 

203
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,333
 I will hire a car and come to Delhi. 

204
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,125
Because there is no other choice, Vikram. 

205
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,958
There are no other flights till morning. 

206
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,208
Vikram, don't get over-protective on me now. 

207
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,500
 I can't handle it. 

208
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,041
I am hanging up now. My battery is down. 

209
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,250
 Okay. 

210
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,041
 What happened? 

211
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,208
 Madam, the machine has broken down. 

212
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,541
 The card isn't working. 

213
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,958
 You will have to pay cash. 

214
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,041
 The plane is not working. 

215
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,708
 Your machine isn't working. 

216
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,250
 Is everyone's mind working? 

217
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,958
 That's working properly. 

218
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,166
How much? - 4000. 

219
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,375
 Here. 

220
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,041
This is three.. - Wait. 

221
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,208
 Will do. 

222
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,541
Here, the receipt to your car. - Thank you. 

223
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,416
You will find it in the parking lot behind the second gate. Yes. 

224
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,041
Okay. - Madam. Greetings. 

225
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,333
 Welcome to my land. 

226
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,583
 Like there was a choice! 

227
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,291
 See you. 

228
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,875
 Excuse me. 

229
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,625
 I have to go to Delhi. 

230
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,541
 How long will it take to reach Delhi? 

231
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,625
Six hours. - What? 

232
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,791
 Six hours. 

233
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,833
 And if you drive faster? 

234
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,708
 This is my speed. 

235
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,583
For the past 11 years. - Very good. 

236
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,333
 Hey, what are you doing? 

237
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,000
I haven't slept for the past 32 hours, madam. 

238
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,958
 I have been driving non-stop. 

239
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,416
 What choices do the poor have? 

240
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,375
 Just keep toiling hard all day long. 

241
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,291
Look, will you be able to drive safely? 

242
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,500
 Or should I hire another car? 

243
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,500
Hire another car. - What? 

244
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,833
 Are you crazy? 

245
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,750
 You cannot do that. 

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,833
 You hire another car.. 

247
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,916
 ..and I will take another fare. 

248
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,583
 Where would you like to go, mister? 

249
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,333
 How dare you speak to me like this! 

250
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
Look, I will file a complain against you, okay? 

251
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,083
 Start the car. 

252
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,291
 You took the money, didn't you? 

253
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,791
 So do I owe you my life! 

254
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,833
Madam, its you! Are you okay? - What okay? 

255
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,750
 I hired this car to go to Delhi. 

256
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:53,958
 And now he's saying he won't go. 

257
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,208
 He's saying, "Hire another car". 

258
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,291
 You said so yourself. 

259
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,583
 Sir, where do you want to go? 

260
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,250
 Are you drunk? 

261
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,166
 Come here. 

262
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,958
 Why don't you take her? 

263
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,500
 You can't force me to. 

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,916
It's my car. I decide who I want to take 

265
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,416
 Or not take. 

266
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,416
It sure is your car, but I've hired it. 

267
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,708
 You talk as if you've bought it. 

268
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,833
 One call can make you rot in jail. 

269
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,916
 Don't you know how to talk to a lady? 

270
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,333
 Go ahead. 

271
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,000
 You too slap me. 

272
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,208
The entire world can do whatever they want with the poor. 

273
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,000
I will crush your jaw with a single punch. 

274
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,625
Then you can drive your car in the reverse gear all your life. 

275
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,916
 No, please, don't.. don't argue. 

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,208
Don't worry, I know how to deal with such rascals. 

277
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,000
 Why won't you go? Start the car. 

278
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,166
 I will come along as well. 

279
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,916
 Don't worry. 

280
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,250
 Let's go. Delhi. 

281
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,833
 Don't worry, I am coming along. 

282
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,458
 Come on. Now just drive the car. 

283
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,541
 And don't even dare to stop the car.. 

284
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,041
..or your breathing till we reach Delhi. 

285
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,208
But.. - Actually the Roadways' bus is running late by two hours. 

286
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,000
 So I thought he will stay in control.. 

287
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,541
 ..if there's a man with you. 

288
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,583
 But you'll have to pay extra fare. 

289
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,458
 There you go again! 

290
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,916
 Should I remove my belt? 

291
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,916
You.. you can just drop me on the way. - Where? 

292
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,250
There.. on the way, near Chandni Chowk. - What? 

293
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,541
 Are you from Delhi? 

294
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,291
 Are you from Delhi? 

295
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,208
 No. 

296
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,750
 Why? 

297
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,875
Does everyone traveling to Delhi have to be from there? 

298
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,041
 You're right. 

299
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,666
 He could be from Kashmir as well. 

300
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,875
My husband is. - From Kashmir? 

301
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,291
Delhi. - I see. Delhi. 

302
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,500
 Where in Delhi? 

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,541
Chanakyapuri. - Chanakyapuri. 

304
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,041
 Where in Chanakyapuri? 

305
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,166
Ninth main. - Ninth main. 

306
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,916
 Where in Ninth main? 

307
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,208
 Bungalow no. 44, have you been there? 

308
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,875
Bungalow no. 44, Ninth main, Chanakyapuri, Delhi. No. 

309
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,625
 I have never been there. 

310
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,416
Do you want to get us killed at this young age? 

311
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,833
 Open your eyes. He was dozing off. 

312
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,583
 Stop the car. Stop the car. 

313
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,041
Don't worry, I have travelled between Delhi and Jaipur many a times. 

314
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,625
I can drive on this road with my eyes shut. 

315
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,625
Even he was driving with his eyes shut. 

316
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,500
 Sit properly. 

317
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,541
 You get worried very easily. 

318
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,291
 It's not your fault. 

319
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,500
Those who belong to New Delhi are the nervous sorts. 

320
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,458
 I am from Old Delhi myself. 

321
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,625
 You must have heard of Chandni Chowk. 

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,375
The 'Gurdwara' (Sikh Temple) there is very famous. 

323
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,958
 That's where my home is. 

324
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,625
 But I work in Karol Baug. 

325
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,791
 It takes me 11 minutes everyday.. 

326
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,375
 ..to reach Karol Baug on my scooter. 

327
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,416
 I have my own shop. 

328
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,375
 Ladies' dress material and saris. 

329
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:10,958
I mean American silk, Indian silk, Dhaka Silk, georgette.. 

330
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,791
 ..poplin, you name it! 

331
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,208
 Retail and wholesale. Both. 

332
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:19,041
It's in the alley in front of Nathuram Confectioners. 

333
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,750
 Incase you want to drop by someday 

334
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,625
Which alley? - Nathuram Confectioners. 

335
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,541
No, the alley in front of it.. - Please look ahead and drive. 

336
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,000
 Only if this guy lets me. 

337
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,208
 Sit properly. 

338
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,750
Madam, I was wondering.. if you don't mind.. 

339
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,166
 What do you do? 

340
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,750
 I'm into banking. 

341
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,791
Bank. Which bank? - What do you mean? 

342
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,375
 I mean the bank that you work in.. 

343
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,708
 ..which bank is it? 

344
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,041
It's not like you think. It's investment banking. 

345
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,750
Securities. - I see. I get it. 

346
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,500
You must be posted in the head office branch. 

347
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,041
 No. 

348
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,583
 You know what? Forget it. 

349
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,458
 I get it. 

350
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,125
 You must be thinking.. 

351
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,916
..that how can this man from Chandni Chowk.. 

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,416
..understand about banking? - I don't mean it like that. 

353
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,000
 No, no, it's okay. 

354
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,208
By the way, madam, I am not like I seem to be. 

355
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,916
 I am more cunning than a 'Lomdi'. 

356
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,833
'Lomdi'. Wolf. - Fox. 

357
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,125
Fox, wolf, same family. They are cousins. 

358
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,541
 Its okay if you don't want to tell me. 

359
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,625
If that's so, then let me tell you in detail what I do. - Okay. 

360
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,791
Basically, we help in the capital formation of businesses. 

361
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:54,708
By the way of outright purchase or security sales.. 

362
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,208
 ..which the issuer offers. 

363
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,000
We do this through standby or separate selling.. 

364
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,833
..to the US market specializing in dollar investments. 

365
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,750
Got it. - I got it. 

366
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,958
 It means our professions are similar. 

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,583
 Investment banking and poplin? 

368
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,208
 Look, you sell American dollars.. 

369
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,000
 ..and I sell American georgette. 

370
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,208
Isn't it? - Now I have heard it all. 

371
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,541
 Music. 

372
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,666
 Which music do you listen to? 

373
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,041
I know, you must listen to English music. 

374
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,791
 I can say that just looking at you. 

375
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:39,416
 "Moments alive just passing you by" 

376
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:43,666
 "And you know that its cupid's time" 

377
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,750
 "Because its never coming back" 

378
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,541
 "Just gone a flight" 

379
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:58,375
"Last time is beating, time is beating, time is beating." 

380
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,583
 How far have we reached? 

381
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,125
 You woke up. 

382
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,541
Seems like you are used to falling asleep on journeys. 

383
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,375
Where are we? - Actually we just crossed Shahpura. 

384
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,750
 We'll soon be reaching Behrol. 

385
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,041
 Then Dharuvera then Gurgaon. 

386
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,916
 Shahpura? 

387
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,416
We are headed to Ajmer! - Ajmer. 

388
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,583
 No chance! Why would we go to Ajmer? 

389
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,750
Please ask someone. - Don't worry. 

390
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,916
 Just relax and sit comfortably. 

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,291
Two hours later you will be comfortably sitting on your bed.. 

392
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,500
 ..and watching television. 

393
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,875
But why haven't we crossed the Behrol bridge yet? 

394
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,875
And where did this rough patch come from 

395
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,166
It says Mumbai 950 kilometers. Where are we going? 

396
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,125
You are driving in the opposite direction. - No chance. 

397
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,375
Why would I drive in the opposite direction? 

398
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,750
 I took a diversion 10 kilometers back. 

399
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,375
I took a big u-turn and then two small u-turns. 

400
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,166
You are heading in the opposite direction. - By God! 

401
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,541
They've changed all the roads in the past two years. 

402
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,708
 Mark my words.. 

403
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,583
..this government won't last for long. - Be quiet. 

404
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,375
 Just shut up. 

405
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,958
 Excuse me. Hey, you. 

406
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,708
 Driver. 

407
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,333
 What is his name? 

408
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,958
 Shivrattan 

409
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,375
 Wake him up. 

410
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,791
Hey, get up. Madam is asking something. 

411
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,875
 Oh honey! why are you getting annoyed? 

412
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,750
What happened? - What are you blabbering? Wake up. 

413
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,916
This man is taking us somewhere else all together! 

414
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,083
Where am I taking you? All of us are going to Delhi. 

415
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,791
 You just stop the car. Stop it. 

416
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:40,000
 What's the big deal. 

417
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:49,125
Where are we? - Just a minute, madam. I will find out. 

418
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,000
This is the worst car I've traveled in. 

419
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:12,958
 What is he doing? 

420
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,041
 Is he serious? 

421
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,875
Seems like he used to drive a steamroller before. 

422
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,500
 You be quiet! 

423
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,625
What? Where are we? - I don't know, madam. 

424
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,041
He said, "I have been driving for 11 years". 

425
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,375
So? You have been driving for the past 11 years, haven't you? 

426
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:44,500
I used to drive on the Shimla-Manali road, madam. 

427
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,291
 Why am I not surprised? 

428
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,000
 Why are you asking this fool? 

429
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,833
 He was sniffing the road. 

430
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,041
 Get in the car 

431
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,125
 Don't worry, madam. 

432
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,000
 We've only lost our way, that's all. 

433
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,333
 What's the big deal. 

434
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,833
 It will start right now. 

435
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,666
 Yes, hello? Vikram, I.. 

436
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,625
 What? 

437
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,500
 No. Not now. 

438
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,500
 God, I can't believe this. 

439
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,750
 What happened? 

440
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,583
 The battery is dead. 

441
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,333
 So what's the big deal! Use my phone. 

442
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,208
 Take it. 

443
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,125
 Talk. Go on. 

444
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,041
 I will go take a look. 

445
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,000
Bablu, I suggest that you check the carburetor. 

446
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,291
 That's where the problem always is. 

447
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:53,541
Your theory would have been helpful in the 1980s 

448
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:57,041
A car with fuel-injection system doesn't have a carburetor. 

449
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,208
 It doesn't! 

450
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:01,708
 That's why it broke down. 

451
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,458
 Our car broke down. 

452
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,666
 Vikram, don't get hyper. 

453
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,875
 No, I will be there. You stay put. 

454
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,083
 I'll call my friend. 

455
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,666
 He will come and fix it. 

456
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,250
He is a mechanic. - When will he come? 

457
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,625
 He will be here in 1-112 hour. 

458
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,750
 Want some? 

459
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,666
 I just called to tell you that.. 

460
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,250
 ..it can take a little longer, okay? 

461
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,500
 Just relax, we are fixing it. 

462
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,333
 Okay, I am hanging up. See you. Bye. 

463
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,083
Thank you. - Welcome. 

464
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,416
Is it fixed? - very soon. I showed the fool how to do it. 

465
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,791
 Don't worry, here, take a bite. 

466
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,333
This snack clubbed with red chilly pickle is my specialty. 

467
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,666
 Ready to eat in two seconds. 

468
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,625
Noodles still take two minutes to prepare. 

469
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,791
 I am not hungry. 

470
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,000
 How much longer will it take? 

471
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,541
Around 1-112 hour. - What? 

472
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,250
 For the mechanic to arrive. 

473
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,250
Mechanic? - What's the big deal. 

474
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,916
 There's a problem with the carburetor. 

475
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,833
 Bablu has called his friend. 

476
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,750
 Bablu, our driver. 

477
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,333
 I named him that. 

478
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,791
What are we going to do for one and a half hours? 

479
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,875
 Great. 

480
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,041
 It's been resolved. 

481
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,041
Now.. we travel by truck to Delhi, is it? 

482
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,458
Not all the way to Delhi, but at least Dharampal will drop us.. 

483
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,833
 ..to an inn ahead. 

484
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,625
 It's the truck driver's name. 

485
00:29:58,416 --> 00:29:59,916
 I don't know. 

486
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,541
 I swear that's his name. 

487
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,208
 I asked him. Dharampal. 

488
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,875
I don't know whether I want to go by a truck or not. 

489
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,208
 I will wait here. 

490
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,083
Here? What will you do here for 112 hour in this cold? 

491
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,291
 And with this fool. 

492
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,041
 I suggest that you come along. 

493
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,958
 We will go there and give him a call. 

494
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,750
 ..and tell him where to get the car. 

495
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,125
 And we can have dinner as well. 

496
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,750
 Come on. Come along. 

497
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:24,416
 Come on, madam. Come. 

498
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:35,458
I've left all my luggage in the car. You think it'll be safe there? 

499
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,458
 You are getting worried unnecessarily. 

500
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,000
 Your luggage will be absolutely safe. 

501
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,875
 Three of my bags are there as well. 

502
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,375
 Bablu will bring them along. 

503
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,208
 Just relax. 

504
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:51,041
First time.. in the truck. - Yes. 

505
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,416
It's quite high. - High and safe. 

506
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,958
 Isn't that so, Dharampal? 

507
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,500
This vehicle has the pride of a king, isn't that true? 

508
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,208
 Rules over the roads 

509
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,750
 There goes a tiny tempo.. 

510
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,000
 And there goes that ant sized scooter 

511
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,875
 It's been ten minutes. 

512
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,583
 You are absolutely quiet. 

513
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,541
 What's wrong? 

514
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,791
Are you feeling shy of the beautiful madam? 

515
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,291
No, no, it's not that. - then what is it? 

516
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,708
Why don't you tell a story of one of your journeys 

517
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,250
 Like the.. Modi's crazy companion. 

518
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,333
 It was a show on the radio. 

519
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,625
 What did it come on? 

520
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,083
Radio. - Yes. 

521
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:41,916
 What story should I tell you, sir? 

522
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,208
Tell me anything. A story will make the time fly by. 

523
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:47,250
Once I was driving on the UP-Patna highway. 

524
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:51,291
And a diesel tanker was lying toppled in the middle of the highway.. 

525
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,583
 ..after ramming into a buffalo. 

526
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,625
 My truck crushed him. 

527
00:31:55,708 --> 00:32:00,000
And his neck came under my truck's tires. 

528
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,500
You mean the entire head. - Oh, no, the head was gone. 

529
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:06,666
 Both his horns sank in his body. 

530
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,625
 And there were streams of blood. 

531
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,208
 Just like that. 

532
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,458
 He died on the spot. 

533
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,291
The veins in the neck must have been severed. 

534
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:21,583
I don't know. - Once I saw an ovine being slaughtered like that. 

535
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,250
You do know what an ovine is, don't you? Sheep. 

536
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,166
Actually the butcher's knife wasn't sharp enough. 

537
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,625
 He gave a single blow. 

538
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,416
 And his head hung like this. 

539
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,500
 It's okay, you can throw it out. 

540
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,333
 You think so. 

541
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,041
 How much? 

542
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,791
 Let it be, madam. 

543
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,458
 Why are you embarrassing me? 

544
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,708
 My wife is pregnant. 

545
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,958
 Just pray that everything goes well. 

546
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,666
 You are giving such big news now. 

547
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,875
 Sly guy. 

548
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,083
 I.. 

549
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,500
Let's.. - Dharampal. 

550
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:17,125
Yes. - Do you always listen to English songs on the radio? 

551
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,375
 No, madam. 

552
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,916
I played it for you. - For me? 

553
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,333
Yes. I thought you must listen to English songs. 

554
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,083
 And she thought you listen to them. 

555
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,666
 Okay, God bless you. 

556
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,375
 Call me and tell me what happened. 

557
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,916
 If it's a girl I'll distribute sweets. 

558
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,916
 Come on, jump. 

559
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,583
You must have never jumped from a truck before today. 

560
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,583
All the best. - Thank you. - Okay, Dharampal, I will call you. 

561
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,625
 That's so sweet. 

562
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,916
 And I was wondering.. 

563
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,416
..since when did truck drivers start listening to English music? 

564
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,041
 Careful. 

565
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,125
Are you okay? - Ya. 

566
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,125
 You're wearing very high heels. 

567
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,500
 I was wondering.. 

568
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,833
 ..why do women wear such high heels? 

569
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,625
But these heels are not meant for walking on these roads. 

570
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,791
Don't mistake this road to be an ordinary one, madam. 

571
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,708
I have heard that people come here in their Mercedes.. 

572
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:14,125
..to eat at this inn. Potatoes with ladyfinger, potatoes with cumin.. 

573
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,291
..potatoes with egg plant, potatoes with fenugreek, potatoes with.. 

574
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,750
..cauliflower, peas and cottage cheese and.. 

575
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,958
 ..they even have cold drinks. 

576
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,833
 So, madam, what will you have? 

577
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,708
Anything. - Anything? 

578
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,666
"Anything" isn't available in this menu. 

579
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,041
 You will have something. 

580
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:33,000
Anything will do as long as its not very oily. 

581
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,250
Which I guess is asking for too much in this place. 

582
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,708
 Lets see.. 

583
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,708
 Son. Yes. Come here quickly. 

584
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,875
Oh, thank you. - Great. 

585
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,041
 He brought a blanket for us. 

586
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,958
What is your name? - Sunny. 

587
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,166
 Sunny. 

588
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:51,916
 Great, Sunny. 

589
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:55,291
Do one thing. Do you eat non-veg? - No, I don't. 

590
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,541
 Oh no! Do one thing. 

591
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,791
We'll have two plates of Dal, Two plates of potato with cumin, 

592
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,041
 Two plates of chick pea curry 

593
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,333
 two plates of yoghurt salad 

594
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,083
 And four flatbreads to start with. 

595
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,791
 Smear the breads with lots of butter. 

596
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,958
 No, do one thing. Butter two nicely, 

597
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,083
And just put a dollop of butter on the other two. Got it? 

598
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,208
That's too much. - But I am so hungry I could eat an elephant! 

599
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,708
 And listen. Sunny, right? 

600
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,291
 Do you see the lady? 

601
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:21,750
 She is from Mumbai. 

602
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,083
 She works in movies, she's an actress. 

603
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,125
You must have seen her on television, haven't you? 

604
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,625
 If she's pleased with your service.. 

605
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,125
 ..she will take you to Mumbai. 

606
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,666
And cast you as a hero in her upcoming film "sky full of stars" 

607
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,333
In which film? - She'll cast me as a hero? 

608
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,125
What hero? I'm saying "sky full of stars" 

609
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,958
 Go, get the food. Yes. 

610
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,125
 Go quickly. 

611
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,416
 What was that stupidity? 

612
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
 You wont understand. 

613
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:50,583
 Just watch how well they serve us now. 

614
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,791
 By God! 

615
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,041
 Next time you want good service.. 

616
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,875
 ..don't use my name, okay? 

617
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,875
 What's the big deal. 

618
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:01,000
Son, turn the fan this way. - Fan? 

619
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,500
 Let it be, it's cold. 

620
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,625
 Wow. 

621
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,541
 It's delicious. 

622
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,666
 What are you doing? 

623
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,333
 Wiping the bread. 

624
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,083
 You must have an oil-remover cream. 

625
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,291
 Apply that on the bread. 

626
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:37,708
 It's great, just great. 

627
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,666
How is the food? - It's okay. 

628
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,750
 Thank God. 

629
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,708
 You didn't taste the Chick pea curry. 

630
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,916
 It's too oily. 

631
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,291
 It's locally made butter. 

632
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,500
 It's very good for health. 

633
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,916
 Try some. 

634
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,791
Eat it. - Why did you serve it on my plate? 

635
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,791
 I hate people touching my plate. 

636
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,250
 Fine, don't eat it. 

637
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,500
 No one's forcing you. 

638
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,125
 What's the big deal 

639
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,541
 Great. 

640
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:15,041
 Great. That was delicious. 

641
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,375
 Why are you laughing? 

642
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,375
 Go get water, chilled water. 

643
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,208
 What happened? 

644
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,000
 My God. 

645
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,333
 Looks like armpit hair 

646
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,791
I can't do this anymore. - It's okay. 

647
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,333
It's clean now after all the steaming and boiling it's gone through. 

648
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,041
 Don't worry, just relax and eat. 

649
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,750
 Please call that driver. 

650
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,125
Bablu. - Yes. 

651
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,750
 He must have fallen asleep by now. 

652
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,041
 Give it to me. 

653
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,750
 Shankar, see if there's a snake. 

654
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,000
 Snake. 

655
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,458
 Cockroach. 

656
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,333
 Cockroach. 

657
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:29,708
 Just a minute. 

658
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:34,041
 There you go. It's dead. 

659
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:35,875
 Stop laughing everyone. 

660
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:37,583
 Madam is scared of cockroaches. 

661
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,250
 I am not used to all this. 

662
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,750
 And cockroaches are the worst things. 

663
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,000
 Shut up, enough of laughing. 

664
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,041
 You call him. 

665
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,166
 Your phone? 

666
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,833
I gave it to you just now. - Yes. 

667
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,166
 It must be right here. 

668
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:04,750
 Where did it go? 

669
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,500
 I am really very sorry. 

670
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,625
I didn't realize how this phone slipped from my hand and.. 

671
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,500
 That's okay, it keeps falling. 

672
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,708
 It's still within the warranty. 

673
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:34,291
Will it get repaired? I will get it repaired once I reach Delhi. 

674
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,041
 Once it fell in the commode. 

675
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,750
 I thought it's gone for good. 

676
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,750
 But those people fixed it in two days. 

677
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,208
 How will we call the driver now? 

678
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,416
 I was thinking about the same thing. 

679
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,708
Jhujhar Singh. - Yes. 

680
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,000
Can we find any transportation here? Some scooter or anything. 

681
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,541
We don't have a scooter, but there is a bicycle. 

682
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,666
 Bicycle. Even that will do. 

683
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,875
Should I ask him to fetch it? - Yes. 

684
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,250
 Go, get the bicycle quickly. 

685
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,458
 Get it quickly. 

686
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,916
 Should I come along? 

687
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,000
Where will you go? You sit here comfortably and relax. 

688
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,250
 I will go find out. 

689
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:18,500
Is it working? - No, there is no sound. 

690
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,166
Uncle. - Yes. 

691
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,083
Should I go along as well? - Go on, son. 

692
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:25,541
 Come, come, climb on. Very good. 

693
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,333
Don't you know how to sit on a bicycle? 

694
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,500
 Yes, that's correct. Bravo. 

695
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,291
 Tell me.. why don't you go to school? 

696
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,333
Do you want to clean utensils all your life? 

697
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,791
Tell your uncle to get you out of this inn.. 

698
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,458
 ..and send you to school. 

699
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,041
Send you where? - To a school. 

700
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,750
 You're a smart kid. 

701
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,875
It's bad manners.. to stare at someone like that. 

702
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,291
Shankar, you were going to the loo, weren't you? 

703
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:24,583
 Go on. Go inside. 

704
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,416
What was that sound? - It's the wolf. 

705
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,458
Wolf? - Yes. 

706
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,041
Wolf. Like a real wolf. - Yes. 

707
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,583
 There's a jungle around. 

708
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,625
 They wander around. 

709
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,833
 Aren't.. aren't you scared? 

710
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,833
There is nothing to be worried about, madam. 

711
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,583
They don't come up unnecessarily like the snakes. 

712
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:12,333
Snakes? - Yes, snakes do come here. 

713
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:14,583
And they come in large numbers in the monsoons. 

714
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,541
 I saw one just the other day. 

715
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,625
 It was this long. it passed from here. 

716
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,208
But those innocent creatures don't hurt us. 

717
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,458
Instead, they eat up the mice in our inn. 

718
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,541
 How was the food madam? 

719
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,125
 Stop, stop. 

720
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,375
I must have lost 10 kilos of weight. I swear. 

721
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:37,000
 Jhujhar Singh. 

722
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,666
 Make some tea. 

723
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,791
Where is the car? - What? 

724
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,500
The car? - The car was towed away. 

725
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,333
There was a leakage in its fuel injection. 

726
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:52,458
So they towed it away. - Now? 

727
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:54,875
 Now what? We will hire another ride. 

728
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:58,291
 But.. how can they do that? 

729
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,208
 They should've sent another car. 

730
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:02,916
 That's right. But this is India. 

731
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,541
You will have to go to Delhi and lodge a complaint. 

732
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,791
 That's why I brought our luggage back. 

733
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,166
Where is my bag? - What? 

734
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:18,166
My bag. - Which bag? 

735
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,041
 My black suitcase. 

736
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,625
Oh! That's what I kept wondering on the way.. 

737
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,416
 ..what have I missed.. 

738
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:30,750
 What? 

739
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,666
 You left my bag in the car. 

740
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,458
What's the big deal, we still have the receipt. 

741
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:39,666
We'll call the car-owners and they will deliver the luggage. 

742
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,333
 Receipt? 

743
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,958
It was in the car. - Really? 

744
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,833
 Did you take it? 

745
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:50,541
But we do know.. the name of the driver. - Bablu. 

746
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,250
Yes. - Wow. 

747
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,208
 What will I do with that name? 

748
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,375
 All my belongings were in that bag. 

749
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:03,166
 My clothes, my files, everything. 

750
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,750
 How can you do this? 

751
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,958
 You have only lost your belongings. 

752
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,708
 So what. 

753
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,291
 Things like these happen sometimes. 

754
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:14,666
You shouldn't let it bother you so much. 

755
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,166
Because I believe that the only thing.. 

756
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,708
.. that matters in life, is life itself! 

757
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,458
 And we're still alive. 

758
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,958
 You are rinsing your mouth.. 

759
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,666
 ..with my French Alps Spring water? 

760
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,000
 So what's the big deal. 

761
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,000
You're arguing with me for a bottle of water. 

762
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,000
I will buy you another one. Jhujhar Singh. 

763
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,583
Give madam two litres of mineral water. 

764
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,250
What's the big deal. - What's the big deal! 

765
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,750
 What's the big deal! 

766
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,916
 What is a big deal for you? 

767
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:46,958
When wolves come in and attack us and eat us.. 

768
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,458
 ..that will be a big deal for you. 

769
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,875
 And you, madam. 

770
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,791
 Everything is bad news for you. 

771
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:56,333
Even your good starts with not too bad, you know. 

772
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,375
 That's it, I have had it. 

773
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,625
You are the worst person I have ever met. - Really? 

774
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,125
 What have I done? 

775
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,041
What did you do? - Yes, tell me, what have I done? 

776
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,791
 I missed my flight because of you. 

777
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,541
Because of me? - Yes. 

778
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:16,791
You stopped your stupid rickshaw at that green signal. 

779
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:19,750
And then I had to forcefully plug my ears on the flight.. 

780
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:21,750
 ..because of your non-stop blabbering. 

781
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:24,791
I never realized when the flight landed in Jaipur. - That's great. 

782
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:27,041
You are accusing me for the problems at Delhi airport. 

783
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,000
And then he forcefully barged in my car. 

784
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,000
I took a lift for you.. - You drove in the opposite direction. 

785
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,708
 I took a lift for you. 

786
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,458
For me? - Yes. 

787
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:37,000
 So that.. That evil Bablu.. 

788
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:40,333
How could I have left a lonely helpless woman with him alone? 

789
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:41,708
 What? 

790
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,333
Lonely helpless woman? - Yes. 

791
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,875
 Do you have any idea who I am? 

792
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,708
 This lonely helpless woman.. 

793
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,083
 heads a company worth 200 crores. 

794
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,958
 635 employees report directly to me. 

795
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:58,916
 I wouldn't let fools like you.. 

796
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,375
..wander anywhere close to my office's building compound. 

797
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:06,750
Who wants to wander in your office's compound? 

798
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,958
 And.. and I don't understand.. 

799
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:11,583
..how can so many men work under a woman. 

800
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,041
 Of course, because for men like you.. 

801
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:15,958
 ..women should stay at home. 

802
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:18,458
So that you can go out and fool around. 

803
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,875
 I am fooling around. 

804
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,666
 Am I fooling around? 

805
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:26,208
By the way, sister, my wife stays at home the entire day as well. 

806
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:28,041
But I didn't chain her down, understand? 

807
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,750
 Do I look like a sister to you? 

808
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,916
Oh! Well, now it seems like it's a crime to call.. 

809
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,833
 ..a woman 'sister' in India ! 

810
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,416
 Forget it. 

811
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,041
You Mumbaikers won't understand a Delhilite's feelings. 

812
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,041
 I know many Delhilites, okay? 

813
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:46,708
But none of them eat with their mouths open. 

814
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,041
 And they don't use abusive language. 

815
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,500
 That, too, in front of women. 

816
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,541
Oh yes, if we say it in Hindi, it's abusive.. 

817
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,625
..and if she says it in English, that's acceptable 

818
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,875
 Just.. shut up. 

819
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:45,416
 I think.. I yelled too much at you. 

820
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,416
 I mean I just.. 

821
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,625
Bablu was saying that Nua station is 25 kilometers from here. 

822
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,583
There's a train that leaves for Delhi everyday from there. 

823
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,833
 We'll catch that in the morning. 

824
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,250
 Okay, thanks. 

825
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:10,375
It's just that my migraine had become severe. 

826
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:12,916
 And.. 

827
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,333
 I just.. I just.. 

828
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:19,333
 Excuse me. 

829
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,166
What's the big deal! It looks like armpit hair. 

830
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,875
You're driving in the opposite direction. 

831
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,041
 Ma'am you've missed your flight. 

832
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:15,791
 I am in jaipur. 

833
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,583
Jhujhar Singh was saying that he has a camel-cart. 

834
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:27,333
It will give us a lift to a jeep. And from there.. 

835
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,333
 What are you looking at? 

836
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,708
 It's so beautiful, right? 

837
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,541
 I've never seen such a sunrise. 

838
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,916
 What is so special about this sunrise? 

839
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,541
 Sunrise happens everyday 

840
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:54,583
But you don't realize how beautiful it is everyday. 

841
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:01,333
 And if I wasn't here with you, then.. 

842
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,708
 ..I would have never seen this. 

843
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,875
 And I am really sorry. 

844
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:13,000
 I yelled at you last night. 

845
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:16,000
 Actually I had got a bad migraine. 

846
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,166
 Its okay. 

847
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,375
Sometimes, when we lose temper, we blow our tops off. 

848
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,250
 Here, toothbrush. 

849
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:29,666
 But I have to confess. 

850
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:32,125
 Seeing you so worried, I was scared.. 

851
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,500
 ..that you might start crying. 

852
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,958
I never cry. - I never cry either. 

853
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,666
I make people cry. - And I make them laugh. 

854
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,958
In fact, you know what you should do when you feel like crying? 

855
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,916
What? - You should laugh out loud. 

856
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,958
What rubbish! - Believe me, it's true. 

857
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,666
 If you laugh at the sorrows.. 

858
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,000
 ..then they never bother you. 

859
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:54,166
That's why whenever I feel like crying, I laugh out loud. 

860
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:56,625
 Interesting. 

861
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,166
Yes. - Thank you. 

862
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,166
If I don't get tea in the morning, then I lose my mind. 

863
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,583
 Yes. 

864
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:20,333
It reminds me, your headache.. - Migraine. 

865
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,041
Yes, that. I have a guaranteed cure for it. 

866
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,541
A saint from the South gave it to me. - I see. 

867
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:29,291
 Look. 

868
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,250
 Wow. What is this? 

869
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:32,750
 It's an ayurvedic ointment. 

870
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:36,208
 Flowers of henna are soaked in vinegar 

871
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,750
And then mixed with elephant's poop.. - Okay, okay 

872
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,958
It's a guaranteed cure. - It might be. 

873
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:46,000
But my head just got better hearing of 'elephant poop'. 

874
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:48,041
Thank you. - As you say. 

875
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:53,666
 I am used to having heavy breakfast. 

876
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:57,000
Will I get something here? - That's more like it. 

877
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,208
 Shankar. 

878
00:52:58,583 --> 00:52:59,791
 What's for breakfast? 

879
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,000
 Fried flatbreads and potatoes. 

880
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,000
 "He dreams with open eyes." 

881
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,125
"our heart - its crazy" 

882
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:33,625
"the entire world has changed, but it refuses to budge" 

883
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:36,500
 "He has gone crazy." 

884
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:41,000
 "He has gone crazy." 

885
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:45,625
 "All day long, he has fun" 

886
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:47,708
 "He has fun." 

887
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,708
 "He has fun." 

888
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,416
 "He has fun." 

889
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,333
There's a "Nua" station, I am taking a train from there. 

890
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,416
 Okay. Yes, I will be there. 

891
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,375
Just meet me at Delhi station at 2 o'clock. 

892
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,375
 Okay, fine. 

893
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:06,291
 It's the.. camel driver's phone. 

894
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,000
 Please, I will tell you later. 

895
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,750
 Okay, bye. 

896
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,791
 "There's restlessness in the heart." 

897
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,083
 "and yet its jumping with joy" 

898
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:19,500
 "sometimes it behaves itself" 

899
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:23,375
 At other times, it becomes naughty" 

900
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,125
 "There's restlessness in the heart." 

901
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,583
 "and yet its jumping with joy" 

902
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,916
 "sometimes it behaves itself" 

903
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,958
 At other times, it becomes naughty" 

904
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,083
 "He plays pranks openly." 

905
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:43,000
 "He has fun." 

906
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:45,416
 "He has fun." 

907
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,291
 "He has fun." 

908
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:51,500
 "He has fun." 

909
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:19,625
 "He wanders around aimlessly." 

910
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:25,916
 "Like a kite on the loose" 

911
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:33,958
 "He wanders around aimlessly." 

912
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:38,583
 "Like a kite on the loose" 

913
00:55:38,666 --> 00:55:43,625
 Only God knows how we'll reach Delhi. 

914
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,916
 "He has fun." 

915
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,750
 "He has fun." 

916
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,708
 "He has fun." 

917
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,500
 "He has fun." 

918
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,541
 "He has fun." 

919
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:58,291
 "He has fun." 

920
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:14,333
We have reached Nua station. - Yes. 

921
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,875
Finally. - Yes. 

922
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:19,041
I get hungry.. whenever I see a station. 

923
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:21,208
I have already digested the morning breakfast. 

924
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,875
I suggest that we first go and eat something. 

925
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:27,458
No.. you go.. I'll take a leave. - you're leaving? 

926
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:30,125
Aren't we are traveling to Delhi together? 

927
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:34,250
No, I will take a first AC.. - First AC. 

928
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,208
 These first AC fares are too high. 

929
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,000
 Why are you going in first AC? 

930
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,000
I suggest that it's a three-four hour journey. 

931
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,750
Let's travel in the general bogie. - I know. 

932
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,916
 That's why I will buy my ticket.. 

933
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,125
 ..and you buy yours. 

934
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:49,583
And anyway, my husband is coming at the Delhi station. - Yes. 

935
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,958
 But how will you travel alone? 

936
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,583
 I can manage that much. 

937
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,166
 Okay. 

938
00:56:56,916 --> 00:57:01,541
And, I am really sorry.. for the phone. - That's okay. 

939
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,000
 What's the big deal. 

940
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:07,041
I should be apologizing for the water and your bag. 

941
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,041
I am very sorry. For all that I may have said or done.. 

942
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,958
 And if you ever come to Karol Baug.. 

943
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,458
 ..then don't forget to drop in. 

944
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:17,083
Do pay me a visit. - Okay. 

945
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:19,125
Yes. - Okay. Goodbye. 

946
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,458
 First AC, Loharu express to Delhi. 

947
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:29,666
 One ticket please. 

948
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,125
 Madam, 324. 

949
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,833
 My money. 

950
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,250
 My.. my money. 

951
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,208
 Where did he go? 

952
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:36,291
 Get something to eat. 

953
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,250
Hey. - You! 

954
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,416
Hey! - Come on. 

955
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,583
 Hey. My money is stolen. 

956
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:17,875
 Come on. Come on, come on. 

957
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,041
 Come on. 

958
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:23,041
Come on. - Hey! 

959
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,291
 Come on, come on. 

960
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,458
 Someone cut my bag. 

961
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,250
 All my money has been stolen. 

962
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,791
 Yes. 

963
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:35,541
 Even yours? 

964
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,500
 Who's the fool? 

965
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,166
 Oh! 

966
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,708
 What job am I stuck in? 

967
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,125
I should've worked in my uncle's tractor agency. 

968
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,208
 I would've done much better with that. 

969
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,958
 Some fool pulled the chain. 

970
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,625
That's only when I get my hands on him. 

971
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:01,250
 See, he delayed the train. 

972
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:09,375
 Someone pulled the chain. 

973
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:12,750
 You did. 

974
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:20,083
 You are a disgusting person. 

975
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:22,958
Don't you know that spitting at public places is a criminal offence? 

976
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:26,666
It's a bigger offence to pull the chain and stop a moving train. 

977
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,416
But if I hadn't done that you wouldn't have boarded the train. 

978
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,958
What if we are caught? - No chance! 

979
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,208
 I pulled the chain from the AC bogie. 

980
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,833
Didn't you notice, the TC is searching for someone else? 

981
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:38,083
 Let's go, let's go. 

982
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:39,541
 Will we get a place to sit? 

983
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,625
Where there is a will, there is a seat. 

984
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,000
 Come, come. 

985
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:45,291
 Here, here, right here. 

986
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:47,333
 It's a window seat, 56, sit, sit. 

987
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,041
 Sit down. 

988
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:04,625
I don't have a ticket. - What? 

989
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,750
I don't have a ticket. - What? 

990
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:11,000
 You don't have a ticket? 

991
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:18,083
 I was just joking. 

992
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:20,166
 That's alright. 

993
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,958
I have been traveling in trains since I was 20 years old.. 

994
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,291
 ..and I never bought a ticket. 

995
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,958
 Never made any reservations. 

996
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,000
 Direct setting with the TC. 

997
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,291
 Don't worry, enjoy the view. 

998
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,625
 But what if we have to pay a fine? 

999
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,041
You won't have to pay any fine, I am there. 

1000
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,833
 Don't worry. 

1001
01:02:41,416 --> 01:02:42,708
 Are you Bengali? 

1002
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,916
 How did you know? 

1003
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:49,083
Looking at your wife's dangling earrings. 

1004
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,250
 How else? 

1005
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:52,958
Only Bengali ladies wear such dangling earrings. 

1006
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:56,166
Am I correct, sister? - Yes, absolutely correct. 

1007
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,666
 What a beautiful sari! 

1008
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,250
Is this a 'Tanth' sari? - Yes, it's a 'Tanth' sari. 

1009
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,250
 They did the right thing. 

1010
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,125
 Changed Calcutta to Kolkata. 

1011
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,125
You don't get the same taste in 'Rasgulla'.. 

1012
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,583
..that you get in 'Rosogulla' (Bengali sweets). 

1013
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,250
Isn't it? - Yes. 

1014
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:12,000
 Now whenever we say Kolkata.. 

1015
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:14,041
..it feels like someone's saying Calcutta.. 

1016
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,250
 ..with hot 'Rasgulla' in his mouth. 

1017
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,750
 Try it. Kol-kata. 

1018
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:21,375
 Why don't you try it? 

1019
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,958
 Hello, are you married? 

1020
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:29,500
Do you.. have children? - No kids. 

1021
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:33,625
 Oh, God, it's important to have kids. 

1022
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:36,166
You must have kids. - Yes, soon. 

1023
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,541
 Soon will make your life lonesome. 

1024
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,791
 She has been married for five years. 

1025
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,000
 I advise you that.. 

1026
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:44,250
..don't miss the happiness of kids for your career. 

1027
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:48,291
 Because life may not always be kind, 

1028
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:50,333
..but everything good happens for a child. 

1029
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,708
 Who told you that I am career-minded? 

1030
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,875
Just because I look like this and I dress like this. 

1031
01:03:57,833 --> 01:03:59,291
 You are arguing again. 

1032
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:03,125
All okay? - Yes, everything is okay. 

1033
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:05,833
It's just that children are a big responsibility. 

1034
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,458
 And I am not ready for it. 

1035
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:11,166
 And can I live my life on my terms? 

1036
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,125
If you don't mind? - I was talking about myself. 

1037
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,000
I had two children in two years of marriage. 

1038
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,083
And I had planned for four. - Four children? 

1039
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,875
 Oh, God. Your poor wife. 

1040
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,250
 She isn't poor. 

1041
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:23,875
Vibha could make the witches look kind! 

1042
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,125
 you don't know her. 

1043
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,708
 Aren't you ashamed? 

1044
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,833
 You are mocking your wife publicly. 

1045
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,541
 I am mocking my own wife and not his. 

1046
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,125
 Sister, you have two kids. 

1047
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,625
 Two sons. 'Rosogullas'. Very sweet. 

1048
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:46,791
But don't mind me saying, the joy of having a daughter is unique. 

1049
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,125
 Like the saying goes.. 

1050
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:52,166
I believe that a son is a son till he gets a wife. 

1051
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,750
But daughter is a daughter till the end of life, right? 

1052
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,666
 By the way. 

1053
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:08,083
Your pocket was picked as well, isn't it? - Yes. 

1054
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:10,125
 Then how did you buy the ticket? 

1055
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:12,625
 You forgot the secret pocket. 

1056
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,583
 No thief can get there. 

1057
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:17,208
I have stashed Rs.800 in there. - What? 

1058
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,083
 I have stashed Rs.800 in there. 

1059
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,333
 Rs.800 in your secret pocket. 

1060
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:32,000
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1061
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:36,541
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1062
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,166
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1063
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:49,125
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1064
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,791
"Life's so short, wonder what will happen next moment." 

1065
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
 "Your journey is calling out to you." 

1066
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,500
 "Stop grieving." 

1067
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,875
 "Let's learn to be happy." 

1068
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:11,000
 "Catch this train that's departing." 

1069
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:18,041
"Life's so short, wonder what will happen next moment." 

1070
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:20,375
 "Your journey is calling out to you." 

1071
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,750
 "Stop grieving." 

1072
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,166
 "Let's learn to be happy." 

1073
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:29,375
 "Catch this train that's departing." 

1074
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:34,250
"This is your world, no matter how it is." 

1075
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,458
 "Why curse it?" 

1076
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,000
 "Let's live these golden moments." 

1077
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:44,166
 "The dawn has arisen." 

1078
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:48,083
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1079
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,250
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1080
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:53,458
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1081
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:59,041
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1082
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:08,000
 "Let's go to Dilli." 

1083
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,375
 Water. Water. Cold water. 

1084
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,791
Which station is this? - It's Jhunjunu. 

1085
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,166
The 'Ghewars' (sweets) from here are very famous. 

1086
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,583
You must have certainly eaten 'Ghewar'. 

1087
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,708
 How would you have eaten 'Ghewar'? 

1088
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:38,875
This must be your life's first train journey. - Of course not. 

1089
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,625
 I have traveled by train.. 

1090
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,208
 ..when I was nine years old. 

1091
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:46,291
From Mumbai to Allahabad. - I see. 

1092
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:48,208
 It was my uncle's wedding. 

1093
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:51,500
 We had a.. What do you call it? 

1094
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,000
 An entire coupe to ourselves. 

1095
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,791
 Fun and mischief all along the way. 

1096
01:07:57,416 --> 01:07:59,041
Eating something or the other all the way. 

1097
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,958
Then you will surely like the 'Ghewars'. 

1098
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,708
I will get it, do taste it. - No, thanks. 

1099
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:06,125
 Goldie, you will eat it, won't you? 

1100
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,333
 Sister 

1101
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
You will taste it, won't you? - Yes, I will. 

1102
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,041
 I will be back soon. 

1103
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:13,625
You taste it, too. - No thanks. 

1104
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:15,666
Papdi. Kachauri (snacks). - Tea. Tea. 

1105
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,916
 Vada. Hot vadas (snacks). 

1106
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:20,958
 So.. how many did you sell today? 

1107
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,750
 Ticket. Ticket. 

1108
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:26,500
 Your Ticket. 

1109
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,625
 Ticket. 

1110
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,625
 Are the Jhunjhunwala's from your town? 

1111
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:35,666
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 

1112
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,375
 Madam is calling you. 

1113
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:39,958
 Come here. Come on. 

1114
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:42,791
A while ago, when I was praising your 'Ghewars'.. 

1115
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,041
 ..she was getting furious. 

1116
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:45,333
 Madam, your ticket. 

1117
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:47,000
 Now she wants them too. 

1118
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,291
I suggest that you pack two kilos. - Listen. 

1119
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,125
 Your ticket. 

1120
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:55,541
 Madam, your ticket. 

1121
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,083
 56 is yours? 

1122
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:02,041
No.. - Actually, madam.. 

1123
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,333
 Sir.. 

1124
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,708
Is she with you? - No. 

1125
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:08,875
No, he has gone out? - Husband. 

1126
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,000
 No, colleague. 

1127
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:13,916
He has the ticket? - No, he doesn't have the ticket. 

1128
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,291
 That means you don't have a ticket, 

1129
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,875
 I suggest that you get down here, 

1130
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,583
Come.. - Panth, sir. 

1131
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:21,250
 I was looking for you in S5. 

1132
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,750
 Would you like to have 'Ghewars'? 

1133
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,875
Come on. Come on. - Madam.. 

1134
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,791
 She is with me. Come on. 

1135
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,416
 Papdi. Kachauri. 

1136
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,041
Mr. Panth. - No. 

1137
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,375
What's the big deal. - No. 

1138
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,708
Hold this box. - No. - Hold the box. 

1139
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:39,416
Mr. Panth, can we travel by train taking up enmities with you? 

1140
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,083
You don't understand. - We can never do it, Mr. Panth. 

1141
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,791
You are our benefactor. - Okay. 

1142
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:46,625
 Take.. the 'Ghewars'. 

1143
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,333
 Taste it. 

1144
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,083
 But I am diabetic. 

1145
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,541
 I can't eat too many sweets. 

1146
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,916
It's done? - Of course. 

1147
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:58,000
He wasn't listening, he was showing attitude. 

1148
01:09:58,333 --> 01:09:59,833
 Later he took Rs.400. 

1149
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,750
I will surely return this money in Delhi.. - What are you saying? 

1150
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,250
Can't I do this much for my special customer? 

1151
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,041
Customer? - Remember ! 

1152
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,000
 My sari shop at Karol Baug. 

1153
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,083
Now wont you be buying saris from my shop on birthdays, marriages.. 

1154
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,625
 ..and every special function. 

1155
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,875
 It's all marketing. Marketing. 

1156
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:21,833
This is the level of this corruption in this country. - Yes. 

1157
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:24,333
 Anyone can do anything with money. 

1158
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:26,583
 Nothing good can happen to India. 

1159
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:28,041
 How can it? 

1160
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,708
 When the train left from Nua station.. 

1161
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:32,083
 ..I boldly pulled the chain. 

1162
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:34,000
But did anything happen? Did anyone catch me? 

1163
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,750
 Did anyone harm me in anyway? No. 

1164
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:37,416
I bought 'Ghewar' at Jhunjhunu station.. 

1165
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,625
..and now I am distributing it to everyone. 

1166
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,625
 The system, my friend. The system. 

1167
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,208
 The problem is with the entire system. 

1168
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:44,791
That's why no one is afraid of doing anything wrong. 

1169
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,416
Look, just because they get a uniform.. 

1170
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,333
..they think they have got the license. 

1171
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:52,041
From the police officials to the TC, all of them corrupt. 

1172
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,208
 They have a rate card. 

1173
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,083
They won't think twice before selling their fathers for a bribe. 

1174
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,250
 Rascals. 

1175
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,791
 Inspector. Mr. Mishra. 

1176
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:19,375
I was saying that we only just pulled the train's chain.. 

1177
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,791
 ..and not a chain from a woman's neck. 

1178
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,958
Don't you agree? - Just a minute. 

1179
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:28,000
 What do you mean by that? 

1180
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,291
Sir, I have the right to make one phone call. 

1181
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:35,333
You too will get a chance to make a call. 

1182
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,250
Seems like you watch a lot of English movies. 

1183
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:43,208
 How.. is she related to you? 

1184
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,875
 She.. is a friend. Co-passenger. 

1185
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,708
We boarded from Nua station.. - Yes. 

1186
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:50,750
And.. - I see. Co-passengers. 

1187
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:51,916
 Yes. 

1188
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,458
Look, you will have to pay a hefty penalty. 

1189
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,125
Uncle. - Uncle? 

1190
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,416
 I only have Rs.500 left. 

1191
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,833
If you could settle the case with this.. 

1192
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,500
 Rs.500 is no good. 

1193
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,666
 I have to maintain the entire office. 

1194
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:22,291
Actually.. - This is no good. Listen, listen to me. 

1195
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,500
Someone picked my pocket and hers, too. 

1196
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,208
 This won't do any good. 

1197
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,208
 You will have to pay Rs.5000. 

1198
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:32,000
 See, when I offered him he refused. 

1199
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,500
 Hey, shut up. 

1200
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:35,583
 There's a huge difference in.. 

1201
01:12:35,666 --> 01:12:38,041
..pulling the chain and stealing the tracks from the yard. 

1202
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:39,666
 Characterless. 

1203
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,916
 Sit there quietly. Look, actually.. 

1204
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,416
Release Pappu or else I will shoot you right here. 

1205
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
 Billu. Billu. Are you here to free us? 

1206
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,458
Shut up. Otherwise we'll be in trouble. 

1207
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,583
 Look, you can't do this. 

1208
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:55,041
 How dare you arrest my friend? 

1209
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,500
 Hey. Shut up. 

1210
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:01,708
 Sit down. 

1211
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:06,708
 Release me. 

1212
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:09,291
 It's office time. 

1213
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,583
 Excuse me. 

1214
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:18,541
 Actually.. can we.. get a lift? 

1215
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,875
 Thank you, brother. 

1216
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:35,166
 Come on, let's go. Come on. 

1217
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:39,541
No one in my family robbed anything smaller than a goods train. 

1218
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,375
And you got arrested for stealing tracks. 

1219
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,000
 If you wanted to get arrested.. 

1220
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,625
..then you should have atleast done something big. 

1221
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:49,750
 Pappu. Pappu. 

1222
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:51,833
 You are like the innocent girl.. 

1223
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,958
..that every man in the village takes advantage of. 

1224
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,375
 Useless. 

1225
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,333
 It's not my fault, brother. 

1226
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:01,208
It's that rascal Shusheel Kumar's fault. 

1227
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,041
His men must have given my information. 

1228
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,000
 Who is Shusheel Kumar? 

1229
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:10,083
That tailor's son. - Yes. 

1230
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:11,958
 See that. 

1231
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:15,416
 That scoundrel, the son of a tailor. 

1232
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,041
He has become so bold that he is trying to challenge me. 

1233
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:21,291
Brother, these days he runs his own gang. 

1234
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,458
Rascal. - Listen to that. 

1235
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,708
Just out of the womb, and already making gangs. 

1236
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:30,708
 He will learn his lesson.. 

1237
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:33,291
..when I get my hands on him and wring his neck. 

1238
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:34,750
 Sit in the car. 

1239
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:37,708
Bhanwar Lal, take the car to his village. 

1240
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,416
 Are you okay? 

1241
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,000
Let's go there. We will knock him there itself. 

1242
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:55,916
Brother, Asangarh is on the way to Delhi, isn't it? 

1243
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,416
 I will shoot that rascal first. 

1244
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,125
 Here, in his chest. 

1245
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:04,583
He dared to lock horns with Bhairon Singh Gujjar, that rascal. 

1246
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,583
We will skin him alive. - Two pieces. 

1247
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:11,666
And that, too, diagonally. - Great. 

1248
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,375
Brother, where are you going to drop us? 

1249
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:16,791
 Who is he? 

1250
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,208
 Brother, he is.. 

1251
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:19,708
 Brother, look. 

1252
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:21,500
 Shusheel Kumar's uncle's car. 

1253
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:24,083
 Bhanwar Lal, follow him. 

1254
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,541
 Turn, turn, take a u-turn. 

1255
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,833
 Don't let him go. 

1256
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,375
 Drive faster. 

1257
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,333
 I was locked in jail because of him. 

1258
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,541
 Drive faster, Bhanwar Lal. Faster. 

1259
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:58,791
 Bhanwar Lal, drive carefully. 

1260
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,666
Brother, is it important to go to Asangarh? 

1261
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,958
 Stop the car. 

1262
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:17,375
I was just saying it's very important to go to Asangarh.. 

1263
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:19,958
..otherwise how will Shusheel Kumar learn his lesson? 

1264
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:22,791
 Where did such a big car disappear? 

1265
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,000
 It was right here. 

1266
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,666
 Why don't you keep track? 

1267
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,833
Brother, there it is. There goes the car. 

1268
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:32,333
 Turn, turn, turn the car, reverse. 

1269
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:33,625
 Yes, there it is. 

1270
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:37,166
 Hey, it's torn. 

1271
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:40,500
That's okay, it can be stitched easily. 

1272
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,416
 First we will thrash the tailor. 

1273
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,250
 Then we will make him stitch it. 

1274
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:50,083
Bhanwar Lal, tail him, tail him. - Yes, bravo. 

1275
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,500
 Bhanwar Lal, don't let him go. 

1276
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,250
 Even if you have to fly this car. 

1277
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,083
 Oh, no. 

1278
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,916
That isn't Shusheel Kumar's uncle's car. 

1279
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,500
That car belongs to Lallan from Teragarh. 

1280
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,458
 Stop. 

1281
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,125
 Sometimes, the car disappears.. 

1282
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,250
..at other times, we follow the wrong car. 

1283
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,333
 You wasted so much of my time. 

1284
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,125
 Take it in reverse. 

1285
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:26,875
 Take it straight to the local bar. 

1286
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:30,583
 Hey, tailor, I am going to.. 

1287
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:33,833
 Ok, let's have one strong beer. 

1288
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:41,166
 Brother. 

1289
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:46,625
I was saying if you could drop us here.. 

1290
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,541
And anyway, there isn't much space in the jeep. - Yes. 

1291
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,333
 Please drop us here. 

1292
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:53,750
 Throw them out. 

1293
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:54,958
 Get out. 

1294
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,208
 Thank you, brother. 

1295
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:00,875
 Okay, it's alright. Mention not. 

1296
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,500
 Thank you. 

1297
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,000
 Come on. 

1298
01:18:06,083 --> 01:18:07,416
 Here's your bag. 

1299
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,375
 Carefully, brother. 

1300
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,916
Do teach a lesson to that Shusheel Kumar. 

1301
01:18:19,666 --> 01:18:22,166
 Come, let's go. 

1302
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,125
 You are just.. 

1303
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:25,958
You take a lift from just about anyone. 

1304
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:28,041
 I wonder where they left us. 

1305
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,125
 Keep walking, keep walking. 

1306
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,041
 Faster. Faster. Don't look that way. 

1307
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:39,000
"my heart beats like the train's engine" 

1308
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:43,166
 Madam, stop, stop. 

1309
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,541
 You don't have to catch a flight. 

1310
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:54,625
 Relax. 

1311
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,541
 Look, brother, you.. 

1312
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:02,375
Are you madam? - Look, this doesn't suit you. 

1313
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:06,833
 Foreign stuff is really great. 

1314
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,541
 Please.. don't trouble her.. Leave it. 

1315
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,125
I have contacts in police station. You don't get it? 

1316
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,333
 You lost your laptop as well. 

1317
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,250
 Thank God, they only took my laptop. 

1318
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:23,166
 Are you okay? 

1319
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:28,375
What okay? My shoes are broken, my clothes are torn. 

1320
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,083
 I am carrying an empty bag. 

1321
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,333
And I haven't been to the bathroom for the past two days. 

1322
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:37,250
 So.. what's the big deal 

1323
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:42,458
This is a open jungle. You can.. - Really? 

1324
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:50,208
 We will find a small hotel there. 

1325
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,500
 I was thinking that.. what if they.. 

1326
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:02,791
..steal your bank's information from your laptop? 

1327
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:04,875
 They cannot do anything. 

1328
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:07,708
 Laptop's specialty. 

1329
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:11,666
 Face recognition, password protection. 

1330
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,958
 That's good. 

1331
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:17,791
Then they won't be able to sell it either. 

1332
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:23,916
 You really think I care. 

1333
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,625
 Yes, let's go. 

1334
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,125
 Just a little further. 

1335
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,708
 Come on. 

1336
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,166
 We have arrived. 

1337
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,875
 It's a long story, Vikram. 

1338
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:12,541
 I will tell you when we meet. 

1339
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,958
 Just get me out of here. 

1340
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,625
 Vikram, don't shout.. 

1341
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,250
I am tired, I am fed up and I just want to go home. 

1342
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:29,500
 It's some Red Tomato.. Palace. 

1343
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:32,541
 Jhunjhunu junction. Gol Chowk market. 

1344
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:34,833
 Okay. 

1345
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,583
Just please come soon, I can't take it anymore. 

1346
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:39,166
 Okay. Okay. 

1347
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,041
 Okay, love you. Bye. 

1348
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:46,125
 Here, yours is 301. 

1349
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:49,166
 I will go find out the menu. 

1350
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,125
It's been so long since I ate the 'Ghewar'. 

1351
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,083
 hungry? Eat this. 

1352
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,416
 Would you like anything? 

1353
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,625
 See, she's hungry. 

1354
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,375
So tell me what today's special menu is. 

1355
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:11,166
Chilly fritters, onion fritters, snacks, potato with ladyfinger. 

1356
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:14,625
Barbecued chicken. And sweets. Sweets with cream. 

1357
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:16,916
And there is a special arrangement in the basement. 

1358
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,916
You mean there's a buffet in the basement 

1359
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:21,833
 Sir.. 

1360
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:27,208
 Today there is a special program.. 

1361
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,541
..in our honeymoon hall in the basement. 

1362
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,541
 Only for gents. 

1363
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:34,958
 I see. 

1364
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,125
 Greetings, Sir! 

1365
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,000
 Hello. 

1366
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,125
This looks like pure 'Pashmina' (Cashmere Wool). 

1367
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,750
 It must be expensive. 

1368
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:15,166
 Chew it. 

1369
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,375
 Chew it. 

1370
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,625
It's brother's paan (betel leaf with tobacco and betel nuts). 

1371
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,125
 Chew it. 

1372
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,791
 Great. The betel-leaf is really nice. 

1373
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,083
 Come, I will show you some real fun. 

1374
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,500
 Send the bags to the room. 

1375
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,458
Let's go. - Come, come, come. 

1376
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:04,333
 You are our guest. 

1377
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:16,125
 "Love is my spell." 

1378
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,666
 O enchantress! 

1379
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,000
 "Love is my spell." 

1380
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:35,166
 "It will knock you out." 

1381
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:42,416
 "No one can escape.. 

1382
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:52,250
 ..my charming eyes." 

1383
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:57,416
"Laila, I am Laila." - Brother, greetings. 

1384
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:03,333
 "I am such a seductress." 

1385
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:16,625
 "Everyone wishes to meet me alone." 

1386
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:21,583
Wow! - Great. 

1387
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:38,375
"Take care, Laila is here to knock you off your senses." 

1388
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:42,083
"Just my glimpse can give you sleepless nights." 

1389
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:45,541
 "My attitude is mesmerizing." 

1390
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:48,875
 "My name has created uproar around." 

1391
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:52,458
"My gait is alluring, everyone's crazy about it." 

1392
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:57,000
"Only the Lord knows who will dwell in my heart." 

1393
01:25:57,041 --> 01:26:00,791
 "Laila, I am Laila." 

1394
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:04,291
 "I am such a seductress." 

1395
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:11,250
 "Everyone wishes to meet me alone." 

1396
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:15,125
 "Laila, I am Laila." 

1397
01:26:15,208 --> 01:26:18,875
 "I am such a seductress." 

1398
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:26,958
 "Everyone wishes to meet me alone." 

1399
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:46,958
"I am captivating. Whoever gets a taste of me.." 

1400
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,125
"..falls head over heels for me, brings the world at my feet." 

1401
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:54,666
"Whoever watches my enchantment, says.." 

1402
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:56,000
 "You're charming, Laila." 

1403
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:58,041
 "You're charming, Laila." 

1404
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:01,500
"I am captivating. Whoever gets a taste of me.." 

1405
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:05,666
"..falls head over heels for me, brings the world at my feet." 

1406
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:09,083
"Whoever watches my enchantment, says.." 

1407
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:10,416
 "You're charming, Laila." 

1408
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,583
 "You're charming, Laila." 

1409
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:00,916
 The programs in these small cities.. 

1410
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,333
 ..are so unique. 

1411
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:06,041
Just play a Hindi movie song, dance around. 

1412
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:07,666
 And it's a full house. 

1413
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:12,041
 It was fun. 

1414
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:20,333
 You freshen up. I will wait outside. 

1415
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:22,000
 I already freshened up. 

1416
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,333
 Please sit. 

1417
01:28:24,083 --> 01:28:25,583
Your husband was supposed to be here, wasn't he? 

1418
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:26,791
 I will go take a look. 

1419
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:28,708
Vikram will be arriving two hours later. 

1420
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:31,166
Then I will take a look two hours later. 

1421
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,708
Shall I order food? - How much are you going to eat? 

1422
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:37,458
 I was talking about you. 

1423
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,041
 For me. 

1424
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:44,750
 No, thank you. 

1425
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:52,666
 Just imagine, if your wife.. 

1426
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:58,083
..finds you in a strange hotel, in a strange place.. 

1427
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:03,375
..with an unknown girl, what will she say? 

1428
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:06,833
 'She won't say anything. 

1429
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:10,250
 Really? 

1430
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:14,166
 Yes, my wife is beyond these problems. 

1431
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:15,625
 It doesn't make a difference to her. 

1432
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,875
 Okay. 

1433
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:27,333
What is your residence number? - 6283314. 

1434
01:29:27,958 --> 01:29:30,000
 What.. what are you doing? 

1435
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,458
Calling your home to tell her you are fine. 

1436
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:33,750
 It's not a problem, right? 

1437
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:35,833
 No, no, there is no need for that. 

1438
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:38,333
 Yes. Hello, am I speaking with Mrs.. 

1439
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,791
Actually.. - I told you there is no need for that. 

1440
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:45,958
Actually we aren't talking to each other these days. 

1441
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,541
If I make the call it would mean my defeat. 

1442
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:52,875
 She should apologize. 

1443
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:57,958
 Your phone 

1444
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,708
 Yes, Gopi. 

1445
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,291
 What? 

1446
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,375
 This matter will go on for long. 

1447
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:18,458
Mr. Pandey and Mr. Bhaiyya won't spare each other. 

1448
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,083
 But what happened here? 

1449
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,083
And so suddenly? - Yes. 

1450
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,625
 Madam, it's a long story. 

1451
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:26,375
 It's a political matter. 

1452
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:30,708
Mr. Pandey's brother-in-law, Mr. Bhaiyya. 

1453
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,458
 They both are from rival parties. 

1454
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,083
They have been looking for an opportunity for a clash. 

1455
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,916
 Today, they got the opportunity. 

1456
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:40,541
 That too, in my Red Tomato. 

1457
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:43,333
Here, in this hotel. What are you saying? 

1458
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,166
In the honeymoon hall in the basement, during the program. 

1459
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,458
Someone spat betel-leaf residue on Mr. Bhaiyya's kurta. 

1460
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:52,416
 Oh, no. Then? 

1461
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,083
"My gait is alluring, everyone's crazy about it." 

1462
01:30:56,333 --> 01:31:00,666
"Only the Lord knows who will dwell in my heart." 

1463
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:03,916
 "Laila, I am Laila." 

1464
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,458
 Laila's darling. 

1465
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,083
 What's this! Spit. 

1466
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:10,166
 Hey, someone spat on you? 

1467
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,500
 Who could it be! 

1468
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:13,166
 There he is. Chewing like a cow. 

1469
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,833
 It must be him. Stop him. 

1470
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:20,333
 After that, Mr. Bhaiyya thought that.. 

1471
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:22,250
 ..Mr. Pandey's men must have done it. 

1472
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:24,291
 He slapped him hard. 

1473
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:26,833
And after that, it erupted into a quarrel.. 

1474
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:30,333
..and from here, it reached all the way to Gol Chowk. 

1475
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:31,666
 There is complete chaos. 

1476
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:35,416
What now? - What can happen? 

1477
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:38,083
It has engulfed the whole of Jhunjhunu. 

1478
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,166
 Gangs are coming from outside. 

1479
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,458
And there's a curfew in the entire city. 

1480
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:44,041
 Curfew. 

1481
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,333
 How will Vikram come here now? 

1482
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:48,166
 That's great. 

1483
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:50,375
When people don't know how to eat betel-leaf.. 

1484
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:51,958
 ..why do they eat it? Isn't it? 

1485
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:57,833
Sajjan Singh will come there with the money. 

1486
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:00,708
Keep it in the blue drawer without letting mother see it. 

1487
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:03,041
Don't start counting it in front of everyone. 

1488
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:05,625
 Understood? I will talk to you later. 

1489
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:07,708
 Stop. Stop. 

1490
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:09,541
 Are you in a hurry? 

1491
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,500
 Take a u-turn, sir. 

1492
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:16,875
 It's closed ahead. 

1493
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,375
There's a gang-war going on between Pandey's gang.. 

1494
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:20,958
 ..and Shrivastav's gang in Jhunjhunu. 

1495
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,916
 That's why. Understand? 

1496
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,166
Now leave. You can't go any further than this. 

1497
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:26,750
 Move. 

1498
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:32,625
O God! Why did it all have to happen today? 

1499
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:36,583
I am sure you must have spat that betel-leaf residue. 

1500
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:40,750
Am I the only one who chews betel-leaf in the whole of Jhunjhunu? 

1501
01:32:40,916 --> 01:32:42,916
Tomorrow, if the government collapses.. 

1502
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,083
 ..she will blame me for that as well. 

1503
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:47,916
 Sit down, don't worry, 

1504
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Why shouldn't I be worried? There's a riot outside. 

1505
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,791
 What's the big deal. 

1506
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:54,708
 What's the big deal. 

1507
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:58,125
 What's the big deal. 

1508
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:02,083
 You know, ever since I met you.. 

1509
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,708
..I am trying to figure out what would be a big deal for you. 

1510
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:08,250
 When they come in and attack us.. 

1511
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:09,833
 ..will that be a big deal for you? 

1512
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:17,666
 Vikram. 

1513
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,750
 Thank God. 

1514
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:22,000
Boyfriend. - Husband. 

1515
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:25,708
Are you okay? - I am now. 

1516
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:28,333
Let's go. - Sir, there is a riot outside. 

1517
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,500
 How can you go? 

1518
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:31,166
 The riots have ended a long time ago. 

1519
01:33:31,416 --> 01:33:32,583
 You civilians really are.. 

1520
01:33:32,666 --> 01:33:34,208
 We fight the enemies at the border.. 

1521
01:33:34,291 --> 01:33:36,041
 ..and you fight amongst yourselves. 

1522
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,708
 You civilians should be ashamed. 

1523
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:39,541
 You don't have any sense. Let's go. 

1524
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:41,875
 This is my husband. 

1525
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:43,791
 Lt. Colonel Vikram Singh Rana. 

1526
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:46,250
 And he is the one who brought me here. 

1527
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:50,083
Hello. - Not him. Him. 

1528
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,875
 Hello. 

1529
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:53,875
 'Hail the youth, hail the farmers.' 

1530
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:56,208
Don't fight amongst yourselves, understand? 

1531
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,000
 Let's go, the riots are over. Come. 

1532
01:33:58,041 --> 01:33:59,791
 Mr. Pandey, Mr. Bhaiyya.. it's okay. 

1533
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:03,375
And you know, he fed the TC Ghevar (a sweet snack). 

1534
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:06,000
Hey, you don't know, he was asking for Gulabjamun (a sweetmeat). 

1535
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,541
 You went through all that. 

1536
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,916
Oh, God. - That was great, nice meeting you. 

1537
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,083
Thank you, nice meeting you too. - Well done, well done. 

1538
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:22,458
Let me tell you one thing. I wonder what would have happened.. 

1539
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:23,875
 ..to my wife if it wasn't for you. 

1540
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,541
What would have happened? I would have reached Delhi.. 

1541
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,166
 ..on time yesterday. 

1542
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,375
Isn't that right? - You are just.. 

1543
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:31,791
 Later. 

1544
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:35,791
 Well, at least call home now. 

1545
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,458
 They must be so worried. 

1546
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,375
 There is no need for that. 

1547
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:40,833
 We are almost home. 

1548
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:42,458
 What kind of a person are you? 

1549
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:44,125
 Such an ego. And that too, male ego. 

1550
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:46,208
It's just not done. - It's not like that.. 

1551
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:49,000
She is right. Why don't you just call home. 

1552
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:50,666
 I insist. Give him the phone. 

1553
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:56,916
What happened? - My phone. 

1554
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:58,708
 I can't find my phone. 

1555
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:01,750
 Did you leave it back at the hotel? 

1556
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:03,333
 Yes, that's right. 

1557
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,875
Should I take a u-turn? - No big deal. 

1558
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,750
 That's a nice attitude. 

1559
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:12,375
 You have developed a great attitude. 

1560
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:16,875
Here. - No, no, really.. 

1561
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:18,125
 Call her, that's okay. 

1562
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:21,375
I insist, call her. - Okay, if you insist. 

1563
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:27,208
 Hello. 

1564
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:28,625
 Yes, it's me. 

1565
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:32,916
The flight was diverted from Delhi to Jaipur.. 

1566
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,625
 You won't understand. 

1567
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,125
 I am coming. 

1568
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:38,791
 I am not making any excuses. 

1569
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,500
 You are just.. Listen. 

1570
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:41,875
 This is not my phone. 

1571
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:43,083
 I can't talk to you for too long. 

1572
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:44,833
That's okay, you can talk to her. - That's okay. - Yes. 

1573
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:46,875
No, no, I am almost there. I will come see you. 

1574
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:50,250
You don't know, once Vibha starts, she doesn't stop. 

1575
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,125
 Thank you. 

1576
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:58,458
 Stop on the left. 

1577
01:35:58,625 --> 01:36:00,708
Your home is here. - No, it's in the alley inside. 

1578
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,625
Then I will take it inside. - No, no.. 

1579
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:04,916
The car won't go inside. I will walk on foot. 

1580
01:36:05,083 --> 01:36:06,958
 By God, let it be. I mean it. 

1581
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,166
 It's very far inside. 

1582
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,041
 Very far for you, but near for me. 

1583
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,875
Sure? - Yes. 100 percent. 

1584
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Shall I stop here? - Yes. 

1585
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:21,041
 Go ahead and take right. That's it. 

1586
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:23,375
 Stop here, here. 

1587
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:26,041
Okay. - We've reached Delhi, thank you. 

1588
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:28,791
Nice meeting you. - Thanks, sir. Salutations, sir. 

1589
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:30,708
 Okay. 

1590
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,041
 I.. 

1591
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,708
Okay, colonel. See you. - Look after yourself. 

1592
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:42,083
 Thanks for the lift. 

1593
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:48,916
Why is she getting down? What happened? 

1594
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,750
 So I guess this is it. 

1595
01:36:53,833 --> 01:36:56,375
 Yes, this is my Chandni Chowk. 

1596
01:36:57,916 --> 01:37:02,750
 No, I mean.. the end of our journey. 

1597
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,333
 Yes, the journey has ended. 

1598
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:07,833
We have reached Delhi. Who knew.. - Yes. 

1599
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:11,166
 I was saying.. 

1600
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:16,708
 ..I apologize for any.. 

1601
01:37:16,916 --> 01:37:18,208
 No, please. 

1602
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:23,625
Whatever it was I have to say.. it was very interesting. 

1603
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,500
 Mr.. 

1604
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:29,625
 Brother. 

1605
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:32,583
I think you didn't read my name on the card. 

1606
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:36,208
 It's okay. My name is Manu Gupta. 

1607
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,708
 Mihika Banerjee. 

1608
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:44,000
 Nice to meet you. 

1609
01:37:45,208 --> 01:37:46,458
 Very nice to meet you. 

1610
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:47,958
 Goodbye. 

1611
01:38:13,041 --> 01:38:15,375
 Oh! I am so tired. 

1612
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,083
 What is that? 

1613
01:38:23,375 --> 01:38:27,458
 Flowers of henna are soaked in vinegar 

1614
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:31,000
 and then mixed with elephants poop.. 

1615
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:33,083
Headache formula. - Are you serious? 

1616
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:37,958
Yes, A-one formula for Head aches and body aches. 

1617
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,166
 It belongs to him. 

1618
01:38:39,708 --> 01:38:42,250
And I am going to use it. - Please use it. 

1619
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:47,791
 Listen, your ad office had called. 

1620
01:38:48,583 --> 01:38:51,458
 Oh, no, I forgot to call them. 

1621
01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:53,166
 Vikram, where is your phone? 

1622
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,916
There it is. - That's it. 

1623
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:02,500
 Hi, Vineet. 

1624
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:04,791
 Sorry, I couldn't call you back. 

1625
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:07,208
 No, I was tied up in something. 

1626
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:10,708
Listen, I have figured out what is missing in that ad. 

1627
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:14,666
Whether it's Mr. Sharma or Mr. Verma, it doesn't make a difference. 

1628
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:16,291
 I think that should be the end. 

1629
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:19,208
 Yes, okay. 

1630
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:20,875
 And listen. 

1631
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:22,416
 I am in Delhi on Monday.. 

1632
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,458
..so if you want to drop by, you can come at anytime, okay? 

1633
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,291
 Okay. Bye. 

1634
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:32,916
You were supposed to go to the US on Monday. 

1635
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,833
What happened? - I am not going. 

1636
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:36,833
Are you sure? - Yes. 

1637
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:40,083
Why? - Because you are going to.. 

1638
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:42,791
 ..throw my birthday party on Sunday. 

1639
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,833
 And the next day, I will be hung over. 

1640
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:46,958
 So I will go after that. 

1641
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,291
 You have changed. 

1642
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:54,791
 Listen.. 

1643
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:58,833
 Look there in the pocket. 

1644
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:00,583
 I brought something for you. 

1645
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:03,125
Take a look, it's in my jacket. - Really? - Your birthday gift. 

1646
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,500
 Yes. Found it. 

1647
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,083
 Oh, my, God. Vikram, it's beautiful, 

1648
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:13,833
 You like it? 

1649
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:22,666
 I am so lucky. 

1650
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:25,458
I have the most wonderful husband in the world. 

1651
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:29,291
 And I want to celebrate my birthday.. 

1652
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:32,333
..with my friends and family at my home. 

1653
01:40:33,375 --> 01:40:36,208
There's still time before we reach home. - Yes. 

1654
01:40:36,291 --> 01:40:38,291
Let's make a list. - Yes. Great. 

1655
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:40,333
 Tell me, who do you want to invite? 

1656
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,000
The usual suspects. - Okay. 

1657
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,458
Sangeeta. - Sangeeta. 

1658
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:45,500
Kunal. - Kunal. - Jeet. - Jeet. 

1659
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,041
Why don't we call him.. Your friend from this journey? 

1660
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:50,541
 Why not invite him? 

1661
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:52,291
 You have the best ideas. 

1662
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:57,750
Where is my phone? - Yes. 

1663
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,833
 It must be the last dialed number.. 

1664
01:40:59,916 --> 01:41:01,125
Call him back. - Of course. 

1665
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:09,041
 The number you have dialed is invalid. 

1666
01:41:10,291 --> 01:41:11,458
 What happened? 

1667
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:13,833
They are saying it's an invalid number. 

1668
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:15,041
 Show me. 

1669
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:20,000
You seem to have dialed a wrong number. 

1670
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,625
Please check the number.. - Yes, its an invalid number.. 

1671
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:22,791
 ..you have dialed. 

1672
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:24,541
 Why would he do that? 

1673
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:27,958
 Why would he? 

1674
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,041
 Vikram, turn the car around please. 

1675
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:36,250
Are you sure? - Please. - Yes, just.. just turn the car around. 

1676
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,916
Where are you going? - I want to find out something. 

1677
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,416
Should I come along? - No. I am fine. 

1678
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,166
Are you sure? - Yes. - Just two minutes. 

1679
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:12,958
Excuse me, do you know where Manu Gupta lives? 

1680
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:14,125
 I don't know that. 

1681
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:15,750
 But please taste these kebabs. 

1682
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,250
 No, thank you. 

1683
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,291
Excuse me, do you know where Manu Gupta.. 

1684
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:35,666
 ..who has a shop in Karol Baug, lives? 

1685
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:37,166
Mr. Gupta. - Yes. 

1686
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,458
Go into the alley right in front. - Yes. 

1687
01:42:39,541 --> 01:42:42,333
It's the first house on the left. - Okay. 

1688
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:44,000
Thank you. - Okay. 

1689
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:49,583
Manu uncle's home. - Yes. 

1690
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:52,083
It's the last house. - Okay, thank you. 

1691
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,083
 Hello, does Manu Gupta stay here? 

1692
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:13,041
 Someone's at the door for you. 

1693
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,958
 Just coming 

1694
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:21,750
 Its you! 

1695
01:44:24,708 --> 01:44:26,500
 Your wife. 

1696
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:30,750
 She's still angry? 

1697
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,791
 No, she wasn't my wife. 

1698
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:34,625
 She is the nurse. 

1699
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:37,375
 My wife.. 

1700
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:41,708
 Come in. Come on. 

1701
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,250
 Come in. 

1702
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:51,708
 She is my wife, Vibha. 

1703
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,916
 Vibha, look who is here. 

1704
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:06,625
 Mihika. 

1705
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:09,708
 The one I was telling you about. 

1706
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:15,125
Two years ago, she got high fever and.. 

1707
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:17,791
 ..it went up here. 

1708
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:23,708
 To her brain. 

1709
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:27,541
 And since then, she is in coma. 

1710
01:45:29,541 --> 01:45:30,625
 Why.. 

1711
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:34,708
 Why didn't you tell me? 

1712
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:38,708
 I never told anyone anything. 

1713
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,708
 Why are you standing? Sit down. 

1714
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,500
 What's the point in telling anyone? 

1715
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:53,166
The more I tell people, the more they'll sympathize. 

1716
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,416
And the more they sympathize, The more it'll hurt me. 

1717
01:45:57,083 --> 01:46:00,166
 And I don't want to live like that. 

1718
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:05,250
The truth is that when something is not in our control.. 

1719
01:46:06,125 --> 01:46:07,916
 ..its foolish to let it affect you. 

1720
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:14,250
I believe.. change what you can and accept what you cant. 

1721
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:17,583
 What? I said, accept it. 

1722
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,583
 But your children. 

1723
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:23,250
 I have two daughters. 

1724
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,708
 Shraddha and Archana. 

1725
01:46:24,916 --> 01:46:27,125
They live in Meerut with my elder sister. 

1726
01:46:27,916 --> 01:46:31,708
I stay out of the house half the time for work. 

1727
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:34,000
 So they are better off with her. 

1728
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:35,416
They do come here sometimes on Sundays. 

1729
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:38,791
 This is my family. 

1730
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:42,333
 Wife's here, children are there. 

1731
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,500
 And I, from here to there. 

1732
01:46:46,083 --> 01:46:47,708
 A wandering traveler, 

1733
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:50,875
 And what do the doctors say? 

1734
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:52,666
 What would the doctors say? 

1735
01:46:56,208 --> 01:46:57,583
 The doctors have.. 

1736
01:47:00,041 --> 01:47:02,083
.. stopped saying anything, just like her. 

1737
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:03,625
 All of them are quiet. 

1738
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:13,916
But I am sure that one day my Vibha will be cured 100 percent? 

1739
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:17,416
 How sure? 

1740
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:21,000
 100 percent. 

1741
01:47:23,083 --> 01:47:25,125
 You are a shameless woman. 

1742
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:27,166
There's a guest at Home who has come for the first time.. 

1743
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:28,625
..and you didn't even ask her for water. 

1744
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,583
 She has grown lazy. 

1745
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:33,291
 I will get water for you. 

1746
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:40,000
 Now I understand.. 

1747
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:44,458
 What the big deal was. 

1748
01:47:47,416 --> 01:47:48,708
 What did you say? 

1749
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:51,916
 Just that.. 

1750
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:56,875
..when something so devastating has happened in someone's life.. 

1751
01:47:58,625 --> 01:48:01,833
..then nothing else seems like a big deal.. 

1752
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:03,666
 It's just a point of view. 

1753
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,333
 See.. 

1754
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:08,666
No matter in what condition my wife is in.. 

1755
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:11,625
 ..at least she is with me. 

1756
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:14,125
 And you know. 

1757
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:17,000
 Vibha isn't an ordinary wife. 

1758
01:48:17,708 --> 01:48:19,916
 She's the only wife in the world.. 

1759
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:22,291
 ..who doesn't argue with her husband. 

1760
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,458
So you too learnt to laugh at your sorrows. 

1761
01:48:28,666 --> 01:48:30,083
Here. - Thank you. 

1762
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:37,166
But there is one thing I still didn't quite get.. 

1763
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:41,125
 Why did you suddenly.. return 

1764
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:46,000
 Actually tomorrow, which is a Sunday 

1765
01:48:46,083 --> 01:48:47,791
 There is a party at my home. 

1766
01:48:48,083 --> 01:48:52,208
And Vikram and I wanted to invite you for it. 

1767
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:58,333
Me? - Look, you tried to avoid us even earlier. 

1768
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:03,375
But I found your home. - No, I.. 

1769
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,500
 No excuses this time. 

1770
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:07,541
 Do come. 

1771
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:09,541
You do remember the address, don't you? 

1772
01:49:09,958 --> 01:49:13,416
Chanakyapuri, Ninth main, bungalow no. 44. 

1773
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,666
Yes, I do. - Exactly. 

1774
01:49:15,041 --> 01:49:19,083
No, actually you.. It's such a big party. 

1775
01:49:19,166 --> 01:49:23,166
And I will look out of place amongst your friends. 

1776
01:49:23,666 --> 01:49:26,916
 There are very few places.. 

1777
01:49:27,166 --> 01:49:29,125
 ..where you will be out of place. 

1778
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:33,916
And many places where I will be out of place. 

1779
01:49:34,666 --> 01:49:36,833
 So, do come. 

1780
01:49:37,125 --> 01:49:40,375
 Actually, it's my birthday. 

1781
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:45,583
Happy birthday to you. In advance. - No. 

1782
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,875
 I will shake hands with you tomorrow.. 

1783
01:49:48,083 --> 01:49:50,125
 ..when you come home and wish me. 

1784
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:54,291
And.. you've already given me my birthday gift. 

1785
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:55,791
 Birthday gift. 

1786
01:49:56,416 --> 01:49:57,916
 Your favorite ointment, 

1787
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,583
I see. Yes, you can keep that. For your migraine. 

1788
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,083
 So.. I will see you tomorrow. 

1789
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,541
 Please, do come. 

1790
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:08,833
 Okay, I will take your leave. 

1791
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:11,958
But how did you come here? - Oh, I walked. 

1792
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:13,500
 But the car is on the road. 

1793
01:50:13,708 --> 01:50:16,583
They won't let Vikram park on the road. 

1794
01:50:16,916 --> 01:50:18,791
 He will have to go ahead and park. 

1795
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Let me drop you. - No, no. No problem. 

1796
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:24,291
I'll go on my own. - No big deal. 

1797
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:26,500
 I'll drop you on my scooter 

1798
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:30,916
Okay. - And it will be faster for you as well. - Yes. 

1799
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:37,625
Vibha, I will be right back after I drop her. 

1800
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:39,000
 Don't get up. 

1801
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:41,083
 Can she hear us? 

1802
01:50:43,375 --> 01:50:45,791
 No, she can't.. hear. 

1803
01:50:47,083 --> 01:50:48,791
 But I can talk. 

1804
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:51,916
Right? - Yes. - Come on. 

1805
01:50:59,791 --> 01:51:00,958
 Let's go. 

1806
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:03,791
 I hope you can get on it. 

1807
01:51:04,375 --> 01:51:05,958
By the way, Happy Diwali (festival of lights). 

1808
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,583
Sit tight. - Yes. 

1809
01:51:08,833 --> 01:51:12,208
You must not have sat on a scooter before, have you? - No. 

1810
01:51:14,708 --> 01:51:17,541
What happened? - Nothing, it just stopped. 

1811
01:51:18,041 --> 01:51:19,416
 It will just start. 

1812
01:51:21,583 --> 01:51:23,541
Are you serious? - Yes, it's just.. 

1813
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:25,041
 It happens sometimes during winters. 

1814
01:51:26,791 --> 01:51:30,833
 Its okay, what's the big deal! 

1815
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:34,208
 Well said. 

1816
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:38,666
It started. - Look, its started. I told you. 

1817
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:41,458
 Now let's go to New Delhi. 

1818
01:51:41,875 --> 01:51:44,375
 But seriously, I must admit, guys. 

1819
01:51:44,583 --> 01:51:46,041
 My meeting with Manu Gupta.. 

1820
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:48,375
..was nothing short of a big deal for me. 

1821
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:52,791
Meanwhile, a small thing happened at our Dharampal's house. 

1822
01:51:52,875 --> 01:51:54,083
 A sweet daughter. 

1823
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:56,000
Meaning, a daughter stays a daughter, till the end of life. 

1824
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:59,625
Maybe Pappu and gang are searching for Shusheel Kumar.. 

1825
01:51:59,708 --> 01:52:01,458
 ..on Google search now. 

1826
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:05,375
Provided, they can crack my laptop's password. 

1827
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,708
Shivratan, who couldn't blame the rich enough.. 

1828
01:52:07,791 --> 01:52:12,583
 ..finally found a shoulder to rest on. 

1829
01:52:14,458 --> 01:52:18,625
And back at the inn, Jhujhar Singh began Sunny's lessons. 

1830
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:20,208
 What did he start? 

1831
01:52:21,458 --> 01:52:22,583
 Lessons. 

1832
01:52:23,166 --> 01:52:24,583
 Speaking about lessons.. 

1833
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:28,125
If you are traveling by train without a ticket due to any reason.. 

1834
01:52:28,625 --> 01:52:29,791
 ..then don't panic. 

1835
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,791
 Talk to the TC traveling on the train. 

1836
01:52:32,208 --> 01:52:35,250
He has the right to issue a fresh ticket to you. 

1837
01:52:35,708 --> 01:52:38,333
 Spitting around is a bad habit. 

1838
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:42,291
Meanwhile, Gujjar was fed up of running around.. 

1839
01:52:42,375 --> 01:52:46,791
..and now he is thinking of finding a nice girl and settling down. 

1840
01:52:47,208 --> 01:52:52,958
Uncle.. Mishra is still quite tied up in managing the station. 

1841
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:55,125
 Mr. Bhaiyya, Laila and Mr. Pandey.. 

1842
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:57,166
 ..have literally spit out their enmity 

1843
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:59,791
..become friends and have come to Mumbai. 

1844
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:02,583
 To take part in a reality dance show. 

1845
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,875
Goldie is still happily.. blaming the system. 

1846
01:53:07,875 --> 01:53:12,291
And Manu.. is still laughing at his sorrows.. 

1847
01:53:12,583 --> 01:53:14,250
 ..and celebrating happiness. 

1848
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:19,833
And me.. Well, Vikram and I have decided to start a family. 

1849
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:23,333
And the best thing is that Vikram has been transferred to Mumbai. 

1850
01:53:23,583 --> 01:53:26,791
So I guess now it's 'Chalo Mumbai' (Let's go to Mumbai). 

1851
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,750
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1852
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:37,291
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1853
01:53:37,375 --> 01:53:40,333
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1854
01:53:40,416 --> 01:53:43,500
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1855
01:53:55,958 --> 01:53:58,916
 "Life is short, why criticize?" 

1856
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:02,083
 "Have fun if you are right." 

1857
01:54:02,291 --> 01:54:05,125
 "Stop thinking so much." 

1858
01:54:05,208 --> 01:54:08,083
 "Loosen up a bit." 

1859
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:11,375
 "Life is short." 

1860
01:54:11,625 --> 01:54:14,500
"Don't waste it worrying about problems." 

1861
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:17,541
 "Stop thinking so much." 

1862
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:20,291
 "Loosen up a bit." 

1863
01:54:20,375 --> 01:54:23,625
"Give me a high-five if you want to rise." 

1864
01:54:23,708 --> 01:54:26,625
 "Because life short." 

1865
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:29,833
"Give me a high-five if you want to rise." 

1866
01:54:29,916 --> 01:54:33,041
 "Because life short." 

1867
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:36,041
 "Stop worrying too much." 

1868
01:54:36,208 --> 01:54:38,708
 "Stop worrying too much." 

1869
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:42,333
 "Stop worrying too much." 

1870
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:45,791
 "Stop worrying too much." 

1871
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:49,125
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1872
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:52,166
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1873
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:57,708
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1874
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,541
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1875
01:54:59,625 --> 01:55:01,000
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1876
01:55:01,083 --> 01:55:04,208
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1877
01:55:04,291 --> 01:55:05,708
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1878
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:07,291
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1879
01:55:07,375 --> 01:55:10,625
 "Let's go Delhi." 

1880
01:55:10,875 --> 01:55:13,583
 "Live life to the fullest." 

1881
01:55:13,666 --> 01:55:17,041
 "Today will be gone forever." 

1882
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:19,750
 "Why do you worry so much.." 

1883
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:23,125
"..when all of us have to leave one day?" 

1884
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,166
 "Live life to the fullest." 

1885
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:35,833
 "Today will be gone forever." 

1886
01:55:35,916 --> 01:55:38,458
 "Why do you worry so much.." 

1887
01:55:38,541 --> 01:55:41,791
"..when all of us have to leave one day?" 

1888
01:55:41,875 --> 01:55:45,041
 "Stop crying and be cool." 

1889
01:55:45,125 --> 01:55:48,041
"Handle yourself or you may make a mistake." 

1890
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:51,333
 "Stop crying and be cool." 

1891
01:55:51,416 --> 01:55:53,916
"Handle yourself or you may make a mistake." 

1892
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,958
 "Stop worrying too much."
