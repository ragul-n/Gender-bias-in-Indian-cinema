00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:28,177

the philosophy he believes.

00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:38,201
Greetings sir.

00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:47,537
Our CM Chandrasekhar Reddy is on live
show here to know your problems.

6
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,576
Where are you calling from?

7
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:53,218
Greetings Chief Minister!

00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:56,549

00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:58,554
Sir, you came to my place
during elections.

10
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,215
lts 2 years 6 months
since elections.

11
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,384
You haven't yet come to our place.

12
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,062
Does your place have current?
- We do sir.

13
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,058
Any water problem?
- No sir.

14
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:10,896
Have new roads been laid?
- Yes sir.

15
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:15,064
There was a big ditch near old
post office, is it still there?

16
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,402
Has it been covered?
- Covered sir.

17
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:21,570
Earlier only one bus plied there.
Now four buses are plying.

18
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:23,409
Yes or no?
- Yes sir.

19
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,416
What if l come to your place or not?

20
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,577
l'll come again to seek your votes.

21
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:31,588
lf this continues, even if you don't
come, l'll vote for you, sir.- Good!

22
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:34,420
How do you remember the
old post office in his place?

23
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:39,088
l've walked all over the state,
who else would know other than me?

24
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,429
What next? lf this goes on,
he'd be the next CM again.

25
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:51,771
Brother-in-law, do something
and become CM again.

26
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,442
Look at his face! His smile!

27
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:59,107
As if nobody is as good as him!

28
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:02,277
Even our faces would look like
that before media.

29
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:03,945
Please do something, brother-in-law!

30
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,789
l can't stand his smile!

31
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:13,129
From tomorrow he'll not smile.

32
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:17,296
A clash would happen tonight
between two castes.

33
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,133
l know how long l should stretch it

34
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:24,970
Let's see!
Which caste he would support?

35
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:30,977
Brother-in-law, our country
has so many castes, religions,

36
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,643
we're able to survive
by creating trouble,

37
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:38,484
what if there's one caste,
one religion and one nation!

38
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:40,319
What would happen to our
lives, brother-in-law?

39
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,985
Call those boys in hostel!
- Okay!

40
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,823
Boys! Some guys are beating up
our hostel inmates.

41
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:51,994
Come...come...
- Let's go...

42
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:16,018
What's the problem there?
- Nothing, nephew.

43
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:23,589
Who are you?
Why are you beating us?

44
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:24,752
Why are you beating them?

45
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,597
Do you know who beat them?
- l don't know.

46
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,758
Do you know why they had a fight?
- l don't know.

47
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:33,428
Do you know you were fighting
without any reason, you know that?

48
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,266
Who are you?
Which hostel do you belong to?

49
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:38,941
Which hostel are you from?

50
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,443
What are you doing in this hostel?

51
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,946
What are you doing here?

52
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,447
Who are you?

53
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:57,456
A viewer who watches your TV!

54
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,291
Why are you beating them?

55
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,456
l'm beating him in suspicion.
- What's the doubt?

56
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:06,469
My doubt is, Govt. has given
hostel facility to this caste,

57
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,302
the same govt. has given hostel
facility to this caste also,

58
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,637
govt. is spending on both of them,

59
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:16,476
govt. which teaches all the
students in one class,

60
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,140
why is it running 2 separate hostels?

61
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,645
Since it is there,
they're fighting it out.

62
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:29,321
l don't know the philosophy of the
leaders to split the society.

63
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,486
l want to hear it from
anyone of them.

64
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,325
Nobody would come and
never say anything.

65
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:39,832
Till my doubt is cleared, l'll keep
in touch with both hostels.

66
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:44,340
l'll not go from here till
my doubt is cleared.

67
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,840
l want it cleared now.
Will you clear it?

68
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:49,512
Will you?

69
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,514
Who would clear it?
Who would clear my doubt?

70
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:57,349
Will you do it? Come on, do it.

71
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:01,521
Who? You...you...

72
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:05,695
Who is this man?
He has spoiled our plan.

73
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,196
Look now, the topic
has been diverted.

74
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,528
He's asking questions without
answers, who is he?

75
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:12,102
Who is he?
He did make a valid point.

76
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:15,697
Where is he from?
He has guts!

77
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:30,378
Why is he so dynamic?

78
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:33,457
l'll not go from here till
my doubt is cleared.

79
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,385
Won't you go until you
get the answer?

80
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:39,122
Who would answer you at midnight?

81
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:42,466
He has courage to ask
what nobody would dare ask!

82
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:46,065
No way sir!
Look at his face!

83
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:47,395
He's a stubborn man!

84
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:50,906
Who would clear my doubt?
Come on, do it.

85
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:54,403
l feel like meeting him.

86
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,743
Would you like to meet?
Okay, meet him.

87
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:16,429
Last a boy created a scene,
it seems he's a mechanic here.

88
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,261
What's his name?

89
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:19,268
Rambabu.
- Where's he?

90
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:21,433
He's not there.

91
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,268
l want information about the boy.

92
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:24,933
Who are you?

93
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:29,945
What's the connection between
last night's trouble and Rambabu?

94
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:31,606
No connection.

95
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:32,773
Why did he react so much then?

96
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:34,112
That is his character.

97
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:36,778
Please tell me in detail.

98
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,618
He's a man who reacts to the news.

99
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,623
Gets up early morning and
reads newspaper.

100
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:43,625
There will be some news
which moves him.

101
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:46,287
A rogue son who throws
out his mother.

102
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,195
He'll go to Malakpet on his bike.

103
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,462
He'll repair the son!

104
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,466
Please don't beat me, brother!

105
00:10:57,643 --> 00:10:59,634
He comes back and
carries on with his work.

106
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:00,801
While having lunch he watches TV.

107
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,972
He goes to BHEL for a case!

108
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:09,482
A fake Swami threatens with
black magic! He goes there!

109
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,821
Spurious medicines rock Kukatpally,
he goes there too.

110
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:19,556
Bandits attack the city,
elderly couple killed! He goes there!

111
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:24,829
His itch has gone to the extent of...

112
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,494
recently he took a train to Guntur,

113
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:28,333
goons threatening youth,

114
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:32,672
police had already arrested them,
but our man isn't satisfied,

115
00:11:32,845 --> 00:11:34,836
he entered the cell and
bashed them all.

116
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:39,678
Police arrested our man too!
He came out after 4 days.

117
00:11:39,852 --> 00:11:42,184
He's ordinary normally.

118
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:45,017
He respects people
and behaves well.

119
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:46,180
But something somewhere goes wrong.

120
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,857
Then, his eyes turn red.

121
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:54,026
His hand reaches the neck.

122
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:00,032
After that neither he nor we
know what he would do!

123
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,704
What about his family?
l mean parents, sisters...

124
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:07,709
He doesn't have anyone
except his mother.

125
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,713
She's mad and in mental hospital.

126
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:13,044
Poor woman!
So, you've given him shelter.

127
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,208
You'd feel like that.

128
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:17,720
Though l look like the owner,
actually, l work for him.

129
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,553
He owns this shed and supports
25 people along with me.

130
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:22,557
Where has he gone?

131
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,389
lt seems some lady gave birth
to a child and left it.

132
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:27,055
lt was shown on TV9 news channel.
He has gone to adopt the child.

133
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,894
He would be returning by now.

134
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:31,396
Here he comes!

135
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:43,905
Take the child!

136
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,243
Feed it with milk.
- Okay brother.

137
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:50,753
Uncle, pay the auto.
- Okay.

138
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,089
Who are you?

139
00:12:57,263 --> 00:13:00,426
You hear on TV, right?
Cameraman Ganga!

140
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,266
l thought Cameraman Ganga
is a man! But...

141
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:07,429
l'm no less to any man,
that's why...

142
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:10,939
l like you.

143
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,269
Girl?

144
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,281
Yes.
- What would you do?

145
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,950
l'll raise her.

146
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,612
Looks like you'll marry her off!

147
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,453
l'll try my best.
- l like you very much!

148
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:36,628
Please don't go behind me,
l'm scared.

149
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:39,293
You're funny too!
- Didn't l tell you?

150
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:40,632
You didn't tell about this.

151
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:45,634
Tell me.
- l'll use you!

152
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:49,141
Use?
How would you use?

153
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:52,978
The fire in you...l'll use that!

154
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,320
Madam is little dominating!

155
00:14:05,498 --> 00:14:07,489
Not dominating but Dalmatian!

156
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,500
You mean?
- l mean talkative girl!

157
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,676
l'm there says Rambabu!

158
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:25,510
People ignore seeing
injustice happening!

159
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,676
But this young man isn't like that.

160
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:31,186
He reacts to injustice!
He helps hungry people.

161
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,349
He questions the society!
He stops hooliganism.

162
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:36,358
His name is Rambabu!

163
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:40,855
He's just an ordinary mechanic.

164
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:44,696
But he repairs humans too
along with bikes.

165
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,034
He won't forget like others
who watch news or read it.

166
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,869
He goes to question them!

167
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,534
He slaps them!

168
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,371
lf necessary he feeds them.

169
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,382
He helps people beyond his economy.

170
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:02,544
Till now he has given work to many.

171
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:06,055
l ran away from home,
brother got me an auto.

172
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,056
My husband died 2 years ago.

173
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,559
Rambabu helped to start
this juice shop.

174
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,891
My two children are going
to school now.

175
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:15,556
Rambabu is God!

176
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:17,896
My family is living
by his grace.

177
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,561
lf he comes to know l'm drunk,
he'll beat me.

178
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,903
Please don't tell him about this.

179
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,741
Rambabu is God!

180
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:29,078
l'm earning Rs.500 every day,
it is Rambabu's grace.

181
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,739
Do you know the real aim of Rambabu?

182
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,407
Everybody must work!

183
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,076
lf you don't work,
l'll beat you.

184
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:37,919
lf l get any doubt, l'll stop
anyone on road and ask him,

185
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,421
l'll ask what he does.

186
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:45,258
lf he says l'm doing nothing,
l'll beat him severely.

187
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,762
Very severely!

188
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,772
How is my program?

189
00:15:56,942 --> 00:16:01,936
You would be shocked
if it was me who did this!

190
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,449
These are just the titles!

191
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,112

to your life.

192
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:17,285
Your life will change
forever from today.- Will it?

193
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:22,298
Your shed is shaken up for coming
on TV news forjust once!

194
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,629
What if you become news reporter?

195
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,801
Come...come...
let's go to news channel.

196
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:30,635
Come, let's rock the state!

197
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,802
Go nephew, rock the state.

198
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,312
Go nephew...please listen to me.

199
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,644
You must go, that's it.
You must go.- You mean it?

200
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:51,318
Where's MD?
- MD? Upstairs.

201
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,328
Upstairs?
- Yes.

202
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,501
Good, l like you.

203
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,663
My channel needs people like you.

204
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:04,833
Boss, l want freedom and
l don't work for salary.

205
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,671
l don't do mistakes and
will not allow others do it.

206
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:07,835
l'm little short tempered.

207
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:10,345
l can't control myself if any
injustice happens before my eyes.

208
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,006
Even if girls do it,
l'll take them to task.

209
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:16,678
Even if she commits any mistake,
l'll slap her too.

210
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:18,346
That's why she has brought you here.

211
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:20,856
Do whatever you wish to do.

212
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:27,355
Why did you go overboard inside?

213
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,524
Will you slap me?
Will you?

214
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:30,930
Did l say like that?

215
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,701
Keep quiet, Ganga.

216
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:35,033
Don't act before a cameraman.

217
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:39,871
l've realised l'm extraordinary
and not an ordinary girl.

218
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,378
Have you realised it?
- No, l'm not sharp.

219
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,540
l'm little slow to grasp things.

220
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,553
Everyday observe me for
a couple of hours.

221
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:54,390
Try to catch up!
- Okay.

222
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,049
As you say!

223
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:57,718
Do one thing.
- Tell me.

224
00:17:57,897 --> 00:17:59,387
Go home for today.
- l will.

225
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:00,896
Do you've bike?
- l do.

226
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,557
Come to my home by morning.

227
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:07,900
Your boys had planned a thanks giving
party, tell them l'll not come.

228
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,405
Better, if you're there
we can't enjoy it freely.

229
00:18:12,077 --> 00:18:13,908
Do you need money for party?
- No need.

230
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,570
Can l lend you Rs.500?
- Oh God! Rs.500?!

231
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,740
We can't afford to spend so much!

232
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:24,746
You're acting too smart off late.
- Thanks.

233
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,596
Drink but don't blabber!

234
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,429
lnfact we drink to go overboard.

235
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:40,265
To remain same before and after drinks,
why should we drink anyway?

236
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:43,431
We're not drinking for fun
but unable to bear tension.

237
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:45,099
What's the tension?

238
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,939
The girl who sells sweetmeats
in the street corner,

239
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:52,277
she stares at you desirously.
- l know that!

240
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,282
She has shifted next to our shed.

241
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,284
We're tensed about what she
do with you!

242
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,284
Where?
- She's there!

243
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:12,798
Why are you overacting?

244
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,628
What happened to you?

245
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,479
Got fever...sweated profusely...

246
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,641
Got shivers...yearning...

247
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:29,811
Boiled...burned...
churned vapors...

248
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,981
Woke up midnight...
felt like crying...

249
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:45,332
Something is happening to me, Rambabu,
what do you this it is?

250
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:48,337
How would l know if you
ask me, O lady?

251
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:51,169
Ask RMP doctor!

252
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:16,198
My body is getting heated up...
- lnstall air cooler in home...

253
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:22,364
l'm thirsty all the day...
- Lick an ice cream...

254
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:28,537
Worry hit me...l'm hot...

255
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:31,547
From this side and that side
and since yesterday...

256
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:35,380
Sari is troubling me and
my birth mark is rattled...

257
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:59,743
How would l know if you ask me?
Go home and ask your sister...

258
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:39,782
l'm in pain always and
there's no relief...

259
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:42,944
May be a muscle pull somewhere...

260
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:49,118
Whatever l eat but no use...
- May be that's why you're slim...

261
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:55,290
l'm scared...l'm in trouble...
l'm trembling...l'm shocked...

262
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:58,300
lt came from all sides and
more over youthful zest...

263
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,462
l got tired with a bout
of unknown uneasiness...

264
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,636
My jacket buttons are giving in,
why do you think so, Rambabu?

265
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:13,809
l'm asking you shamelessly,
what could be the reason, Rambabu?

266
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:26,831
My fans will not like it,
please leave me alone...

267
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:51,512
Everyone in this channel is one...

268
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:55,015
Who is SRK?

269
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:59,524
l'm going to introduce
you to him. Come...

270
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:16,879
Ordinary name.
l'll make you extraordinary.

271
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:19,882
Little polishing would make
the boy reach top!

272
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:22,384
Sir, that's why
l've brought him to you

273
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,717
Just for 2 days, if you take
him under your wings.

274
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:28,052
l'll use him freely.
- Use him...use him...

275
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:31,893
Do you know what does it mean?
- l don't know.

276
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:33,395
lt means taking all
social issues on to your head.

277
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:36,557
lf there are no issues,
you've to create new ones.

278
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:38,293
Create new issues?

279
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:50,404
We're blind, sir!
Please give us alms, sir.

280
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:53,415
Please don't ignore us, sir.

281
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:56,247
Don't have any doubt to give
alms or not, sir.

282
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:58,753
Madam...madam...

283
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:02,758

- Okay sir.

284
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,922
Please give me alms, sir.
- l will but...

285
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,762
Did you see a recent release
film 'Love is Blind'?

286
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,597
We're blind,
how can we watch films, sir?

287
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,932
You can't see, right?
But you can hear, right?

288
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,439
Exceptionally!
- One minute.

289
00:24:18,777 --> 00:24:19,607
Learn this dialogue.

290
00:24:19,778 --> 00:24:22,110
Get lost blind man!

291
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,944
Repeating the dialogue, sir.
- Won't it if l record?

292
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:28,780
What's your feeling on
hearing this dialogue?- Feel, sir?

293
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:32,117
Get lost, blind man!
Won't you feel hurt on hearing it?

294
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,122
Anyway it wasn't for us, right sir?

295
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:35,783
lf it was told about blind man,
isn't it for you too?

296
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:36,620
lndeed, sir.

297
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:37,784
Won't you feel?
- We do, sir.

298
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:40,625
Won't you react?
- We will, why not sir?

299
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,788
Can you come to my studio
and feel it?

300
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,127
We will sir.
- Get up sir.

301
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:44,633
Say clap, sir.

302
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,303
Awakening

303
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:51,306
A film 'Love is blind'
that was released recently,

304
00:24:51,476 --> 00:24:54,138
it had dialogues to hurt the
sentiments of visually impaired.

305
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:56,804
Get lost, blind man!

306
00:24:56,982 --> 00:24:58,813
How could censor allow this dialogue?

307
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,975
l'm asking, has censor board
gone blind?

308
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:03,314
What do you say about it, Dhanraj?

309
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:05,987
ls it our sin to be born
as blind, sir?

310
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:09,821
Don't know in which life we committed
sins to get punished like this!

311
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,397
Why are you also torturing us, sir?

312
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:20,669
Not only that we've information that
they're planning to burn the reels

313
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,500
ls it true?
Are you going to burn the reels?

314
00:25:22,674 --> 00:25:25,006
Yes sir, give me the reel,
l'll burn it.

315
00:25:25,177 --> 00:25:31,173
Where are the reels?
Give me the reels, sir.

316
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:37,185
Why are you beating me?

317
00:25:38,857 --> 00:25:41,018
Would anyone bring garbage
into home?

318
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:42,683
But you brought it on TV.

319
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:44,692
lt means you've taken it
into every home.

320
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:49,027
Do any program like this again,
l'll stab you with tripod to death.

321
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,866
ln an emotional outburst,
l'm little short tempered.

322
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:00,204
l lost my cool.

323
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:03,537
l'm sorry for what has happened,
please delete the records.

324
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:06,047
Do you've this talent too?
- A little bit.

325
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,222
Your training is over,
you can join duty today.

326
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:16,224
What sir?
Not even a day is over!

327
00:26:16,395 --> 00:26:20,388
No, the boy is very sharp.
Put him on track and give him a push!

328
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:22,727
Please don't praise him like that.

329
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:24,061
Please train the kids.

330
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:27,228
No need to train him,
he's well trained.

331
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:33,738
lf you want to talk,
let it be personal like this.

332
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:35,743
Not in public, right?
- No sir.

333
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:40,248
Take him...take him.

334
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,086
Sister, TV media people are here.

335
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:52,093
Let them in.

336
00:26:58,603 --> 00:27:00,093
Are you going to interview me?

337
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:01,933
Yes madam.
- Do it.

338
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:06,934
Sister Gundakka! My good wishes
for world women's day.

339
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,272
What was your aim to enter politics?

340
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:17,778
Since time immemorial men
are denigrating women.

341
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:20,117
l'm fighting against that.

342
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:23,625
But people criticize that you're using
women as plank to get MLA seat.

343
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:25,786
Criticism can't stop revolution!

344
00:27:25,964 --> 00:27:29,798
Women will break free and
would rule the world.

345
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,960
But history says kingdoms were
lost because of women.

346
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:33,968
What do you say about it?

347
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:37,472
lt was a history written by men
in their favour.

348
00:27:37,642 --> 00:27:40,304
But sections are favourable
to women now, right?

349
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:44,813
lt is not enough to
humiliate men.

350
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:46,974
Why all this trouble?
Why don't you give up marriage?

351
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:50,986
lf we do, who would bear children?

352
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:53,818
Who would take them to school?
Who would earn for the family?

353
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:57,155
lf we do all that then
who would cook food in home?

354
00:27:58,663 --> 00:28:01,996
So, you need man!
- We do!

355
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:06,331
But he must do as we say!

356
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:11,173
Every man who is not in
our control is an enemy.

357
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:15,006
History says women are
enemies of women. What do you say?

358
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,343
You always rake up history.

359
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:20,849
A woman like me wasn't there then.

360
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,182
Men went overboard and
wrote all that nonsense.

361
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:27,018
Had l been there,
l would've burnt them all alive!

362
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:33,691
Since God has given you a mouth,
you blabber too much,

363
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:36,356
people say that about you.
What do you say?

364
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:40,027
Bring the idiot who said
that l'll take him to task.

365
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,037
Women must arise!

366
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,541
After divorce women
must pay alimony to men,

367
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:49,874
wishing it happens,
Rambabu from News channel.

368
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:52,043
Why are you telling just your name?

369
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:52,876
Won't you tell my name?

370
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:55,042
Won't you?- l will.
- Tell again.- Okay.

371
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:58,549
This is Rambabu with
cameraman Ganga.

372
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:02,724
Your student is marvelous, sir.
He's very fast!

373
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:06,728
Your training rocks!

374
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:13,398
But don't know why l wish to meet you
personally at least once a day.

375
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,572
You be busy with your work
and me with mine.

376
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:21,405
Let's keep the eagerness
to meet as it is.

377
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:25,410
l think MD is calling you,
please take him.

378
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:32,082
Go!...

379
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:34,247
lt seems he wants to meet.

380
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:38,590
Atrocities by Jawahar Naidu for
seat of power is crossing limits

381
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:45,100
Jawahar Naidu has connection to
12 unsolved murders in this city.

382
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,329
l've the evidence to prove it.

383
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,930
Though l've given it police,
they don't care it.

384
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,769
Jawahar Naidu is behind it.

385
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:57,279
Last week's caste clash between
hostels was a scheme of Naidu.

386
00:29:57,449 --> 00:29:59,610
This phone conversation
is the evidence.

387
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:03,615
There must be a clash
between the two hostels.

388
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:07,451
Send our men, at least
50 students must get hurt.

389
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:08,786
Murthy will pay you for it.

390
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:12,294
Create some trouble,
if not this, then that.

391
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:15,627
Political murders or caste clashes
or fake corruption charges,

392
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,134
he wants to bring down the
present CM and take his place.

393
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:22,136
My investigation will not here...

394
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,136
Do you know who he is?

395
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,972
l know sir, he's Dasarada Ram.
l met him once.

396
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:32,310
He started his career by
distributing pamphlets.

397
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:37,148
l know journalism is still
alive seeing him.

398
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:42,487
Watching his fearlessness,
l fear danger to his life.

399
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:47,821
Did you speak on road or
from telephone exchange?

400
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:49,830
Why didn't you go to
his home and speak?

401
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:52,330
Would Murthy come to pay them?

402
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:53,831
Why not mention my name too?

403
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:56,166
l don't know how recorded my
conversation, brother-in-law.

404
00:30:56,341 --> 00:31:00,505
Media people don't have any otherjob,
recording or telephone tapping,

405
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:01,839
or do sting video operations.

406
00:31:02,013 --> 00:31:06,677
They're not letting politicians to
peacefully enjoy company of women.

407
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,184
We're not afraid of Govt.,
police or people,

408
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,016
but really scared of media people.

409
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,354
No use! We have to start
a TV channel of our own.

410
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:19,190
Why should we invest so much
when not in power? lt's drain!

411
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:21,521
Then, kill him!

412
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,361
He's accusing us from every platform.

413
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:26,197
lf we do now, it'll get us
into trouble.- lt should!

414
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:30,535
Every journalist must know we'd kill
if anyone points fingers at us.

415
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:33,371
Where's my son? Tell him,
he'll take care of him.

416
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:34,375
Okay, brother-in-law.

417
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:36,207
Are you speaking to him on phone?

418
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:40,875
Your father ordered his kill, kill him,
you want the media to know it?

419
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:44,544
Have grown old without getting wise,
tell him personally.

420
00:31:44,723 --> 00:31:45,553
Right, brother-in-law.

421
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,891
ls Rambabu there?
- He's inside.

422
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,391
Why are you all here?
Won't you go to home?

423
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,730
Where would we go?

424
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:04,568
What are you doing?

425
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:07,234
Making an omelette.
How come you're here, Ganga?

426
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:09,903
Nothing, l came out feeling hungry.

427
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:14,578
Do you know to cook?
- A little bit. l live alone, right?

428
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:20,413
No Beers in your fridge, Rambabu?

429
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:23,083
l don't drink, Ganga.
So l don't keep stock.

430
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:26,094
Won't it be difficult for guests?
Get me one.

431
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:30,257
For whom? You?
- Who else? Myself!

432
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,259
Small or large?

433
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,438
lf it is small l would've
told you specifically.

434
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:41,272
Large one!
- Okay.

435
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:42,272
Arrange to get it.

436
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:44,278
Uncle...
- l've sent boy.

437
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:48,947
You're on the job already?
Okay, get it fast.

438
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:59,124
lt's plus for you to spend evenings
with seniors like me.

439
00:33:01,466 --> 00:33:07,302
l'm proud of you Rambabu.
You're my product.

440
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:14,634
Today is off duty,
no need of respect or tension.

441
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:19,814
Let the omelette be spicy!

442
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,976
Do you love spicy food?
Okay.

443
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:30,658
How many would you've loved till now?

444
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:32,319
lt never happened even once.

445
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,661
Do you think how would've
fallen in love with me?

446
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:40,327
Who would dare love you?
Don't talk nonsense.

447
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:45,336
Why did you say like that?
Am l not beautiful?

448
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:51,176
Beauty is not the issue,
there's little manliness in you.

449
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:56,013
Manliness is in foreground
and womanliness is in background.

450
00:33:56,187 --> 00:33:59,020
The fact is whether you've it
in you or not is suspect.

451
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,023
Who would dare come forward
for you in this confusion?

452
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:07,858
Your omelette.
l'll take it.

453
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:12,192
But many ha approached me.

454
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:14,865
Did they approach or you think so?
- Why?

455
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,237
Did anyone gave you
love letter by mistake?- No.

456
00:34:20,378 --> 00:34:24,872
Did anyone dare say l love you?
- Never.

457
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:29,717
Did anyone give you flowers or fruits?
- Never.

458
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:35,557
Did anyone ever wink at you?
- No!

459
00:34:36,394 --> 00:34:37,884
Who would want to invite trouble?

460
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:40,561
Please tell me, Ganga.

461
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,563
Are you scolding or praising me?

462
00:34:42,734 --> 00:34:44,224
l'm praising you.

463
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:48,570
You're cameraman Ganga
not camerawoman.

464
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,731
Who would dare come near you?

465
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,401
l took little liberty because
its off duty and you said so,

466
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,410
please don't take it
to your heart.

467
00:34:57,415 --> 00:34:59,406
But l do get an idea
when you say this.

468
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:00,744
My foot!

469
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,752
Who would dare marry you
if you drink Beers like this!

470
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:06,083
lt came in flow...

471
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:08,088
No problem if it is in flow.

472
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:13,223
l feel shy when you say this.

473
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:18,926
We too ask for the same! Feel shy!
lncrease your traffic.

474
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:23,437
lf not in this age, when?
We're asking the same!

475
00:35:26,444 --> 00:35:27,934
Who is inside?

476
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:30,444
Rambabu with cameraman Ganga!

477
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:52,459
Do you know who ajournalist is?

478
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:56,463
A bridge between politicians
and public.

479
00:35:57,642 --> 00:36:03,808
But like one way traffic you tell people
about our corruption and scams,

480
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:06,974
did you ever tell about
what injustice people do?

481
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:10,481
Do you know how dangerous people are?

482
00:36:10,655 --> 00:36:13,988
Do you've any idea how they
play with politicians like me?

483
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:19,725
There's no mad man than him in the world
who wishes to become their leader.

484
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:22,993
Do you know how we've to serve
people forjust a 5 year rule?

485
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:26,500
They take money for votes,
they take saris, cricket kits,

486
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:29,333
biryani packets, arrack sachets,

487
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:31,998
just to hear our speeches,

488
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:34,007
they don't come unless we pay them,

489
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,511
moreover we've to arrange
lorries to carry them,

490
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:40,344
they take bath on roads,
they eat in everyone's home on the way,

491
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,509
bloody life!

492
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:45,345
They welcome us in every home,

493
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:47,514
brother, you must come to power,
you're God!

494
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:49,523
they cry,
they tell their difficulties,

495
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:52,185
trusting this we go to
every home and pay them,

496
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:53,853
but there's no guaranty
that he would vote for us.

497
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:57,524
While counting votes,
tension almost takes our lives.

498
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:02,529
Do you know the problems faced
by politicians because of people?

499
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,702
Unable to bear the tension,
we do few murders,

500
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:08,038
and get involved in scams.
What else would we do?

501
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:14,879
Why do you write about it
and show on TVto kill us?

502
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:18,215
Let you may shout for rooftops,

503
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:22,723
but people remember only leaders
not the names ofjournalists.

504
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:26,227
People remember lessons in text books,
who's bothered about the writers?

505
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:28,555
lf they remember what we wrote before
casting their votes, that's enough.

506
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:31,065
No need remember us!
- That's for people!

507
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:33,226
But few people must remember
your name!

508
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:35,065
They must remember your death!

509
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,143
Every journalist must shiver on
seeing your post mortem report.

510
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:43,403
My death may scare few millions,

511
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:45,742
but ifjust one man gets angry,
that's enough,

512
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:46,747
you'll be finished!

513
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:52,413
Let me see it!
Let me see who would get angry!

514
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:56,450
Let me see what he would do
if he gets angry!

515
00:38:57,822 --> 00:39:01,155
Many stab injuries.
They've stabbed him repeatedly.

516
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:03,892
Drained out the blood completely.

517
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:05,993
Very painful death!

518
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:11,494
Who did this, sir?

519
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:16,166
We're investigating.
- Who did this, sir?

520
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,175
l know it is Jawahar Naidu's son!
Everyone here know that!

521
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,836
Media people also know that!
Can we do anything?

522
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:26,677
We know where he is!
But can't go to him!

523
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:29,342
We've to follow bloody rules!

524
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,512
You file the case against him,
l'll get him!

525
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,520
Where is he?

526
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:39,188
Come.

527
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,201
lt's not safe to go there now,
please listen to me.

528
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:49,361
Get on the bike.

529
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:06,549
Who is he?

530
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:15,558
Who is he?

531
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,904
Boys! Stop him!
Don't let him in, stop him!

532
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:26,240
Go away!

533
00:40:28,246 --> 00:40:30,407
People say you killed Dasarada Ram,
what do you say?

534
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:31,570
Who are you?

535
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:33,910
When did you kill him?
Where did you kill him?

536
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:35,313
To hell with your interview!

537
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,751
Did you kill him or not?

538
00:40:41,425 --> 00:40:42,255
No!

539
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:44,917
Okay, you didn't kill him, right?
Let's go to police station. Come!

540
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:47,587
Why should l come to station?

541
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,096
Throw him our boys!

542
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:05,609
What the hell...
- Will you come or tell me?

543
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:08,775
Hey you! Switch off the camera!

544
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,284
lf camera is switched off,
l'm uncontrollable.

545
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:11,785
Do you want me to stop it?

Ganga, stop the camera.

Angry?
What would you do if you get angry?

551
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,165
What would you do?...

552
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:02,662
Hey you stop!
You switch on the camera.

553
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,172
What do you want?
Please switch it on!

554
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:08,167
You want me to come to
the station, right?

555
00:42:08,346 --> 00:42:10,837
Come, let's go.
Let's go!

556
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:14,845
Uncle, is elderly man near you?

557
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,351
He's watching TV.
- Switch it off immedaitely.

558
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,021
Switch off the TV immedaitely.

559
00:42:24,195 --> 00:42:25,685
Some man came here and
taking away Rana.

560
00:42:25,863 --> 00:42:28,423
lf leader comes to know, it's trouble.
- Okay.

561
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:34,531
What happened?

562
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:38,205
Nothing, Rana has gone to station
regarding Dasarada Ram murder case.

563
00:42:38,376 --> 00:42:39,365
Taken to station?

564
00:42:39,543 --> 00:42:42,876
Some media reporter came for
interview and took him to station.

565
00:42:43,047 --> 00:42:45,379
l've spoken to Ramam,
Murthy has gone to the station.

566
00:42:46,884 --> 00:42:48,715
Give me the remote.
- Nothing..- Give!

567
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:50,547
There's nothing, brother-in-law!
- Give l say!

568
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:58,058
Rambabu took Rana the accused by
his collar in full public glare.

569
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:00,720
Who the hell is he to take my son?

570
00:43:00,898 --> 00:43:02,729
He's a media reporter, brother-in-law!

571
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,891
Why did you switch off TVthen?

572
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,900
Are you planning to ruin
my son's career?

573
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:08,561
Don't worry, Rana will be out.

574
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:14,405
Not about Rana, who the hell is he?

575
00:43:17,581 --> 00:43:20,072
He's Rambabu...
- Bloody Rambabu!

576
00:43:25,923 --> 00:43:29,586
Who is Rambabu here?
- Please listen to me.

577
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,923
Who is he?
Where are you, Rambabu?

578
00:43:33,097 --> 00:43:35,588
What? Are you taking video?

579
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:40,601
You wait!
Where are you?

580
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:44,104
l'm calling you!
Can you hear me? Where are you?

581
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:47,608
Where are you?
Where are...

582
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:53,944
How dare you take my son Rana
to the station!

583
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:55,278
How dare!

584
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:59,116
How dare you touch my son Rana!

585
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,780
What do you think of me?

586
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,621
l can burn down you and
your TV channel!

587
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:08,458
l was CM for two terms!
You don't know about me.

588
00:44:08,632 --> 00:44:12,295
l would've seen many useless
fellows like you.

589
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,961
Even great men bit dust before me.

590
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:16,800
Please come in sir,
let's discuss peacefully.

591
00:44:16,974 --> 00:44:20,466
He dared to touch my family,
how can l discuss peacefully?

592
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:21,633
Please listen to me, sir.

593
00:44:21,812 --> 00:44:25,145
Why should l? You take
sides of people who pay!

594
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:29,309
But claim honesty and integrity!
- Please sir...

595
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:32,320
Today l must see his end.
- Please listen to me.

596
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,855
Why should l listen?

597
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:57,007
You may have been CM, may have
met President and Prime Minister,

598
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:59,342
but wouldn't have ever met
a mad man like me.

599
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:05,349
lf l get angry an ant or CM
are same to me.

600
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:18,025
How dare you slap me!

601
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,541
Brother-in-law!

602
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:36,216
Brother-in -law is sick!

603
00:45:36,387 --> 00:45:39,220
Rambabu's reaction attacked
former CM!

604
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,383
Rambabu has become talk of
the state once again!

605
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:47,554
Getting excited about son's arrest,
Jawahar Naidu had a paralysis attack.

606
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:51,895
His supporters went berserk in
many place across the state.

607
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:54,731
Section 144 has been imposed
in many towns.

608
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:57,070
Rambabu, phone call from CM's office!

609
00:45:57,241 --> 00:45:59,573
Who got the call?
- You!- Me?

610
00:45:59,743 --> 00:46:01,574
MD is calling you immediately.

611
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,081
l'll say only one word.

612
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:17,250
Country needs men like you!

613
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:19,953
That too in media is
really necessary.

614
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:34,942
What do you think of yourself?
Who are you?

615
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,614
Just a stone!
A small stone in Ameerpet.

616
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:42,945
l brought and chiseled it
into a statue.

617
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,452
What happened now?
- What should happen?

618
00:46:45,623 --> 00:46:48,285
lf CM calls,
will you say thanks and hang up?

619
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:50,120
Won't you tell him about me?

620
00:46:50,294 --> 00:46:52,956
l didn't have time.
He said thanks and l said okay.

621
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,792
lf he says best of luck,
you mustn't say thanks.

622
00:46:55,966 --> 00:46:57,297
What should l say then?

623
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:58,628
You must say it was all
because of Ganga,

624
00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:00,997
he would then ask, who is Ganga?

625
00:47:01,972 --> 00:47:05,305
Ganga is my mentor and
she gave me life,

626
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:08,309
tell him about me for an hour,
who can dare stop you?

627
00:47:10,648 --> 00:47:12,138
You sidelined me!

628
00:47:13,317 --> 00:47:18,152
Who are you?
My product! l identified you!

629
00:47:18,322 --> 00:47:21,985
Like introducing a hero in film,
l gave you big bang entry!

630
00:47:25,162 --> 00:47:28,154
l trained you day in and
night out to shine like this.

631
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:34,402
Why are you putting hand on neck?

632
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:36,996
Are you getting angry or got angry?

633
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:38,330
Hands off.

634
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:44,007
Why are you laughing?

635
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:47,677
l'm really sorry!

636
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:51,014
ln the pride of fame,
l forgot my mentor!

637
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:53,019
What did you give me?
You took it all!

638
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,023
Whatever happens hereafter,
you're front and l'm back, okay?

639
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,191
What would l do in the front?

640
00:47:58,362 --> 00:48:01,354
You want to put me in front
and get me killed!

641
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:08,198
Are you crying, Ganga?

642
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:11,363
My wish is coming true!

643
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:16,036
You're changing slowly
into a woman!

644
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:21,715
l'm not an ordinary girl
but extraordinary girl.

645
00:48:23,387 --> 00:48:25,048
You've made me cry!

646
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,882
l told you to observe me,
did you do it?

647
00:48:30,728 --> 00:48:31,888
Please do for some time.

648
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:01,255
Your face is extraordinary...

649
00:49:02,426 --> 00:49:06,920
Oh my God! She's extraordinary...

650
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:33,783
Your thin waist is extraordinary...

651
00:49:33,957 --> 00:49:36,118
Making faces is extraordinary...

652
00:49:36,293 --> 00:49:42,129
lf my heart slips in the dimple
on your cheek when you smile...

653
00:50:32,683 --> 00:50:37,347
Your shake like Jennifer Lopez
is extraordinary...

654
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:42,356
lf you allow to touch or caress,
it's extraordinary...

655
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:46,860
When you squeeze my heart like Sridevi
of 'Vetagaadu', it is extraordinary...

656
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:54,869
O beautiful!
Your navel is extraordinary...

657
00:50:55,038 --> 00:51:00,874
Your beautiful torture is
leaving my nights sleepless...

658
00:51:01,044 --> 00:51:02,375
Oh my God!

659
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,775
Whether you pinch or scratch
or bite, it is extraordinary...

660
00:52:07,945 --> 00:52:12,439
Whether you shout or stretch out,
whatever you do is extraordinary...

661
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:17,280
When you roam around sexily,
it is extraordinary...

662
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:25,293
Those silly blank face like
plain Jane is extraordinary...

663
00:52:25,462 --> 00:52:31,298
You're acting innocence
when l praise you...

664
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:32,628
Oh My God!

665
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,663
lf not in training,
when would you learn?

666
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:06,496
l'm vast sea, draw and use it!

667
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:10,003
Only then a Ganga and Rambabu
would come from you!

668
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:13,506
He has come without intimation!
His face looks grim!

669
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:16,502
Come Rambabu, you boys can leave.

670
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,511
l want to talk to him.
Come Rambabu!

671
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:23,680
Come.
What's the matter?

672
00:53:26,189 --> 00:53:30,182
l guessed it from your face.
That's why l sent them out.

673
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,351
One minute delay and you'd have
beaten me before them, right?

674
00:53:32,529 --> 00:53:34,190
SRK, you're great!

675
00:53:34,364 --> 00:53:36,855
Why did you beat me now, Rambabu?

676
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:37,864
What's that program?

677
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:41,368
You didn't like any of my programs,
which program are you talking about?

678
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:44,200
Awakening!

679
00:53:45,709 --> 00:53:48,041
The extinction of black marketing
of film tickets.

680
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:51,203
Like Kondapalli dolls are going extinct,

681
00:53:51,381 --> 00:53:54,214
likewise people who sell tickets
in black are also going extinct.

682
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:57,376
Let's know about their problems.
Tell us about your problems.

683
00:53:57,554 --> 00:54:00,387
We used to sell black tickets
in theatres for about 3 weeks.

684
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:03,048
Now, we're unable to sell for
more than 2 days, tell them!

685
00:54:03,226 --> 00:54:04,056
Why do you think so?

686
00:54:04,227 --> 00:54:07,219
They're releasing 1000 prints
in all centres at a time!

687
00:54:07,397 --> 00:54:12,562
And people are swiping credit cards on
internet to book tickets in advance,

688
00:54:12,736 --> 00:54:16,137
what would be our condition?
How would we support our family?

689
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,576
lf they release TV serials in theatres,
we'll sell tickets in black to women,

690
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:25,909
and eke our livelihood.
Please allow us to live, sir.

691
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:29,741
Please sit down.
- Sit down. Let us live!

692
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,751
You've seen, right?

693
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:35,756
ls careless Govt. responsible
for their poor condition?

694
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:39,259
Are directors responsible
by making C-grade films?

695
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:43,263
Are producers responsible for
releasing in maximum theatres?

696
00:54:43,433 --> 00:54:47,597
Are you responsible for not
supporting black marketing?

697
00:54:47,771 --> 00:54:49,261
Think over it!

698
00:54:49,439 --> 00:54:50,599
Awakening!

699
00:54:50,774 --> 00:54:52,605
ls this a program?

700
00:54:52,776 --> 00:54:54,607
lt's my weakness to
do such programs.

701
00:54:54,778 --> 00:54:56,439
lt's your weakness to beat me
watching that program.

702
00:54:56,613 --> 00:54:59,605
Weakness would go suddenly,
try to reduce it step by step.

703
00:54:59,783 --> 00:55:01,114
You too reduce your weakness.

704
00:55:01,284 --> 00:55:03,616
l want to slap you tightly.

705
00:55:03,787 --> 00:55:06,620
Will you slap me?
- Any doubt?

706
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:10,120
Who would dare stop you?
- Latch the door!

707
00:55:10,293 --> 00:55:13,456
Let's discuss whatever it
is behind the door! Close the door!

708
00:55:15,298 --> 00:55:17,789
Dasarada ram's murder case
took a new turn.

709
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:23,133
A man claiming to have killed Dasarada Ram
surrendered in Kachiguda station.

710
00:55:25,308 --> 00:55:30,473
To the people of this state,
to the politics of this state,

711
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:33,973
to take me away from it,

712
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:38,981
to drive away me from this state,

713
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:47,154
finish me as a politician,

714
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:56,170
l'm telling through media that
it's a conspiracy by present CM.

715
00:55:58,842 --> 00:56:07,011
Sir, if not what else,
somebody killed somebody,

716
00:56:07,184 --> 00:56:12,019
why should my son be taken to
station getting beaten up publicly?

717
00:56:12,355 --> 00:56:16,689
l'm making a fervent plea that
this is political conspiracy!

718
00:56:19,362 --> 00:56:23,696
But nobody can douse a fire!

719
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,698
Nobody can hide truth!

720
00:56:27,871 --> 00:56:31,864
Look there!
My son has come back!

721
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:39,205
Come my son!
- Father!

722
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:42,545
Father...
- Look...look my son!

723
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:44,710
They've made me a handicap.

724
00:56:44,888 --> 00:56:45,718
Nothing will happen to you, father.

725
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:48,551
What was their sin to
torture father and son?

726
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:50,556
Though he has no power,
he's struggling for people,

727
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:52,058
is this the way you treat him?

728
00:56:53,063 --> 00:56:57,056
Don't feel sad, son!
Though l die, you must live!

729
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,725
What are you saying, father?
Nothing will happen to you, father.

730
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,064
They'll not let me live,
they'll kill me.

731
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:04,730
Nothing will happen, father.
- They'll not let me live.

732
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:10,244
But, you must for the sake of people,
for the welfare of this state,

733
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:12,574
you must live!

734
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:19,621
Yes, my heir has come!
- Father...

735
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,423
He's the man responsible for all this.

736
00:57:26,596 --> 00:57:30,760
Why are you focusing on us?
Turn the cameras on him.

737
00:57:32,102 --> 00:57:36,266
Son, he's responsible for everything.

738
00:57:36,439 --> 00:57:42,935
He has joined forces with Chief Minister,
this is a drama played out by them!

739
00:57:43,113 --> 00:57:46,776
How much did he pay your channel?
- You calm down, father.

740
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:50,943
How did you allow this
uneducated mechanic into media?

741
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:53,112
ls he ajournalist?

742
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,781
What did you study to become
ajournalist?

743
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:57,119
Why did you come here?

744
00:57:58,795 --> 00:58:01,628
What did you or your father
study to rule over us?

745
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:04,293
Why should we need education
to question you?

746
00:58:04,467 --> 00:58:06,958
Just courage to speak truth
is enough!

747
00:58:07,137 --> 00:58:09,799
Son, that attitude...

748
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:27,817
Yesterday's incident Jawahar Naidu
took entire sympathy.

749
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:30,152
All other channels are accusing us.

750
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:32,488
lf we're afraid of other channels,
why should we run a channel then?

751
00:58:32,662 --> 00:58:35,654
What should l do?
Every party owns a channel!

752
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:38,665
There are rules and
restrictions in channels.

753
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:41,167
Rules and restrictions!
Please tell me what they are!

754
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:43,169
Just one rule that rules followed by
Doordarshan must be followed by all channels

755
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,672
That's enough to shut down
all the TV channels.

756
00:58:45,842 --> 00:58:48,333
Your attitude is getting me
into trouble.

757
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:51,173
Come out openly like that!

758
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:53,509
lf you say your attitude is creating
problems to me and my channel,

759
00:58:53,683 --> 00:58:56,345
please leave the channel,
l'll willingly go away!

760
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:59,511
Rambabu, l didn't mean...
- Sir, l love media.

761
00:58:59,689 --> 00:59:00,849
l've great respect forjournalism.

762
00:59:01,024 --> 00:59:02,355
But one thing hurts me,

763
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:04,516
channels have forgotten
Dasarada Ram barely in few days,

764
00:59:04,694 --> 00:59:07,026
and showing sympathy towards
Jawahar Naidu's family,

765
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:10,689
it has really hurt me, sir.
Bye sir!

766
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:41,729
l feel sad to think about that you
won't come to office from tomorrow.

767
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:44,060
l'll miss you very much.

768
00:59:45,068 --> 00:59:47,229
l too would miss you.

769
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:48,761
lsn't it?

770
00:59:49,906 --> 00:59:51,237
What shall we do then?

771
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:56,473
Come to my shed with your bike.

772
00:59:56,746 --> 01:00:00,238
Get it repaired or washed!

773
01:00:03,086 --> 01:00:05,748
lf l make an omelette,
have a Beer!

774
01:00:07,257 --> 01:00:09,748
Please give me an opportunity
to serve you.

775
01:00:09,926 --> 01:00:13,919
l'll give, you don't worry!
- Okay.

776
01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:30,810
Something is wrong with me.

777
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:36,448
Temperature too has changed.

778
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,322
You're alive because of the time
gap l give between murders.

779
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:21,854
My foot media!

780
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:27,163
Your earnings and life isn't worth
the drinks my boys have every day.

781
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:30,829
Do you think you're a hero
with a mike and camera?

782
01:01:33,343 --> 01:01:35,004
lnstead of finishing in the flow,

783
01:01:35,178 --> 01:01:37,874
why are you giving a useless
lecture about useless things?

784
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:46,011
l know your capacity!
l've seen it already!

785
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:49,351
l've brought men to fathom
your pride!

786
01:01:49,526 --> 01:01:51,858
Who the hell are you to do that?

787
01:01:52,028 --> 01:01:53,689
My pride must accept it, right?

788
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:59,525
Bring 10, 20 or 120 men,

789
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:03,194
let it be any number,
only 4 people can round me up,

790
01:02:03,373 --> 01:02:08,208
l'll kill those 4 people
on the spot!

791
01:02:09,379 --> 01:02:13,372
Whether you kill 4 and die or
die in the hands of 40 people,

792
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,608
you're sure to die!

793
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:19,044
Will you telecast my arrest?
l'll telecast your death!

794
01:02:19,222 --> 01:02:20,382
Take out the cameras.

795
01:02:26,062 --> 01:02:28,895
His death must be shown
on Discovery channel.

796
01:04:26,182 --> 01:04:27,046
Come here!

797
01:04:28,685 --> 01:04:30,516
l don't have the patience
to chase you.

798
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:35,351
Come...come here...
stand there! Come.

799
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:37,186
Am l mad?

800
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,851
To come when you're with a rod!
l've seen it, right?

801
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:41,519
We're just ordinary media people!

802
01:04:41,698 --> 01:04:45,031
Our lives not worth the
drinks you have! Come!

803
01:04:46,035 --> 01:04:50,529
We're not living on you!
You're living on us!

804
01:04:50,707 --> 01:04:55,371
lf we don't write about you!
lf we don't talk about you!

805
01:04:55,545 --> 01:04:58,537
lf we stop showing you on TV,
what would become of you?

806
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,080
You'd vanish!

807
01:05:00,383 --> 01:05:04,376
Then, you'd fall at feet to beg!
- So what?

808
01:05:04,554 --> 01:05:06,545
You're 200% right!

809
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:09,556
Media is the most powerful, so what?

810
01:05:09,726 --> 01:05:13,890
l can use, play or make the
same media my concubine!

811
01:05:14,063 --> 01:05:16,054
l'm telling you now,

812
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:20,896
l'll use the same media,
make people as puppets and play!

813
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:24,233
l'll use the same media to
become CM, what would you do?

814
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:31,745
Media isn't anyone's concubine
to play as you like.

815
01:05:39,088 --> 01:05:41,249
Let me see
how you can become CM!

816
01:06:05,615 --> 01:06:06,445
How is Rambabu?

817
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:09,278
Wait, madam told us not
to allow anyone inside.

818
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:11,784
Who is this madam?
- She's Smitha madam.

819
01:06:11,954 --> 01:06:13,114
Who is Smitha?

820
01:06:27,136 --> 01:06:30,128
He's unconscious,
please wait outside.

821
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,132
l'm Ganga!
- So what?

822
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,800
l'm here to see Rambabu.

823
01:06:35,978 --> 01:06:38,811
All the people are here
to see Rambabu.

824
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:41,882
Please go out!
Please allow him to breath!

825
01:06:48,658 --> 01:06:51,320
Why is she here, uncle?
She's from that channel, right?

826
01:06:51,494 --> 01:06:54,156
This channel made an entry
after your channel got cut.

827
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,163
Last night some people attacked
Rambabu, she brought him home.

828
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:59,665
lf she does, won't she allow
anyone to come near him?

829
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:02,498
How dare she stop me!

830
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:04,663
lt seems he can't breathe
properly if l'm there!

831
01:07:05,007 --> 01:07:09,000
Can he if she's there?
As if she's split AC!

832
01:07:09,178 --> 01:07:11,009
Who are you?
- l stay here.

833
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,172
Clear them out!
- Okay madam.

834
01:07:15,518 --> 01:07:17,213
Going in again! Stay there!

835
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:19,518
What's this fate, uncle?

836
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:21,680
What can we do? We've to adjust!

837
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:23,518
What's this, uncle?

838
01:07:28,197 --> 01:07:31,030
Brother-in-law, there lot of
sympathy on us among people,

839
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,861
Rana's popularity is on raise!

840
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:35,367
This is the right moment!
Let's get him into the act!

841
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:41,541
Plan it grandly!
Launch must be sensational!

842
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:43,542
Wherever my son may be,

843
01:07:43,713 --> 01:07:47,205
at least a million people
must be around him.

844
01:07:47,383 --> 01:07:51,217
You said some Bobby
would be here...

845
01:08:01,731 --> 01:08:04,393
Greetings...

846
01:08:08,237 --> 01:08:12,401
Babu, l can foresee it!
lt'll be victory! Let's rock it!

847
01:08:12,575 --> 01:08:15,738
CM post is a film that
should run for 5 years.

848
01:08:15,912 --> 01:08:17,402
Publicity must be a deluge!

849
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,275

01:08:27,924 --> 01:08:29,585
Don't keep the face so seriously,

852
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,422
the way our politicians have,
practice that divine look!

853
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:36,990
Every poster of you must appear
like you were born for this state.

854
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,763
You maintain that one thing,
l'll rock the show.

855
01:08:41,938 --> 01:08:44,099
When his birthday falls?

856
01:08:44,273 --> 01:08:45,262
6 months later.

857
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:48,774
6 months is too late,
shift it to next week.

858
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:52,608
l'll cut a demo on him,
release two song albums on him.

859
01:08:52,782 --> 01:08:55,273
that's enough for the party workers,

860
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:56,782

861
01:08:56,953 --> 01:08:59,945
it's my responsibility to
make him CM in your budget.

862
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,121
Take money from Murthy.

863
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:06,287
Greetings sir...

864
01:09:11,801 --> 01:09:17,467
Son, every leader in the
world rose from agitations,

865
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,303
you're a leader as big as
your agitation!

866
01:09:21,477 --> 01:09:22,808
Think over it!

867
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:35,484
l walked out of the channel unable
to compromise or bend backwards.

868
01:09:35,658 --> 01:09:37,489
lt'll repeat again in your channel.

869
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,492
Join us and do as you wish.

870
01:09:40,663 --> 01:09:44,656
Who will stop you?
Ruin our channel too!

871
01:09:45,001 --> 01:09:47,731
l don't know if you know this
or not, l'm your big fan!

872
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:50,164
Really?

873
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:59,504
Stop, please sit here.
They both are inside.- Who?

874
01:09:59,682 --> 01:10:02,515
Smitha madam and Babu.
They're busy inside.

875
01:10:02,685 --> 01:10:03,674
Hasn't she left him yet?

876
01:10:03,853 --> 01:10:05,844
l think they may ask us to
leave as night falls.

877
01:10:07,523 --> 01:10:08,512
Move!

878
01:10:21,871 --> 01:10:23,031
Can you please step out
for a minute?

879
01:10:23,706 --> 01:10:25,867
l want to have a personal
talk with him.

880
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:28,203
l think you both love each other.

881
01:10:28,377 --> 01:10:31,039
Sorry, l don't know, please carry on.

882
01:10:31,213 --> 01:10:34,046
Smitha, you've mistaken.

883
01:10:34,216 --> 01:10:36,207
There's no love between us,
Ganga, she thinks we love each other.

884
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:37,545
Are we lovers?

885
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:40,051
What brings you here?

886
01:10:40,222 --> 01:10:43,555
Heard that your leg was broken
and hurt your head!

887
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:45,387
Came just to see you.

888
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:48,724
But l find you quite happy here.

889
01:10:48,898 --> 01:10:50,388
My heart is content!

890
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:54,559
l think she wants to say something
but unable to express it.

891
01:10:54,737 --> 01:10:55,567
l'll take leave.

892
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:59,071
Please sit here.
- Sit, Smitha.

893
01:10:59,241 --> 01:11:02,574

Who would stop you?

894
01:11:02,745 --> 01:11:04,076
Be happy!

895
01:11:09,919 --> 01:11:11,079
Do you've 22 number wrench?

896
01:11:11,253 --> 01:11:13,244
Take it.
- l'll...

897
01:11:13,589 --> 01:11:14,749
Who?

898
01:11:14,924 --> 01:11:21,090
She's a scheming lady, uncle.
She's not ordinary lady!

899
01:11:21,263 --> 01:11:22,252
Do you think she's Smitha?
She's Silk Smitha!

900
01:11:22,431 --> 01:11:23,762
Look at the scent she uses!

901
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:25,764
Do media people use scents?
- No.

902
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:27,596
Do we use in our families?
- No.

903
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:28,930
Bloody!

904
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,272
Did he get even a scratch
when he was with me?- No!

905
01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:36,104
Just a small gap and
he got injured severely.

906
01:11:36,278 --> 01:11:38,439
She entered and charmed him!

907
01:11:38,614 --> 01:11:40,605
Bloody Smithaji!

908
01:11:46,288 --> 01:11:48,950
How do you do?
- Fine sir.

909
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,615
l owe my career to you, sir.

910
01:11:50,793 --> 01:11:51,953
lt's all your grace, sir.

911
01:11:52,128 --> 01:11:57,293
Stop it boy! Your programs
don't have creativity anymore.- What?

912
01:11:57,466 --> 01:11:59,457
You don't have the fire
in you anymore.

913
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:01,793
What's your program?
Awakening!

914
01:12:01,971 --> 01:12:03,131
ls it really awakening?
- Yes.

915
01:12:03,305 --> 01:12:04,795
l feel sleepy watching it.

916
01:12:04,974 --> 01:12:06,805
What's that reaction? How can you
reach top with such programs?

917
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:08,807
That's why l called you, sir.

918
01:12:08,978 --> 01:12:13,972
Sir, it seems Rambabu who was with
us is set to join your channel.

919
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:19,477
Yes, l too got the message.
He's joining today.

920
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:22,146
Please train him under you
for 2 days.

921
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:24,815
Under me? He'll get lynched!

922
01:12:24,994 --> 01:12:26,655
He'll lynch you!

923
01:12:28,497 --> 01:12:29,987
Just 48 hours is enough.

924
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:32,827
How can l say no to your request?

925
01:12:33,002 --> 01:12:34,833
l'll definitely train him.
Send him to me.

926
01:12:37,673 --> 01:12:38,833
Greetings madam.

927
01:12:39,842 --> 01:12:40,501
Greetings.

928
01:12:41,177 --> 01:12:43,839
You carry on,
l'll be back in a minute.

929
01:12:50,186 --> 01:12:53,849
SRK told me about you,
l too heard a lot about you.

930
01:12:54,023 --> 01:12:59,859
Look, media isn't just
blabbering or blurting nonsense.

931
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:01,360
Use brain!

932
01:13:02,531 --> 01:13:03,862
Didn't get me?

933
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,030
Play it boy!

934
01:13:06,702 --> 01:13:12,698
Jawahar Naidu will be sworn in as
19th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

935
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:24,042
Born in village Venigalla
of Guntur district in 1947,

936
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,884
entered politics with slogan,
Visakha steel is Telugu people's right.

937
01:13:30,226 --> 01:13:32,717
But he hasn't yet become
CM again, right?

938
01:13:32,895 --> 01:13:35,728
Program would be like
that if he becomes.

939
01:13:35,898 --> 01:13:38,890
lf he gets 'Padmasri' award,
change the voice and play it.

940
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:43,065
'Padmasri' title has been awarded
to a Telugu man again!

941
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:48,404
Jawahar Naidu who lead many
struggles and agitations,

942
01:13:48,577 --> 01:13:50,909
central Govt. is going to
honour him with the award.

943
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,069
Stop it!

944
01:13:52,915 --> 01:13:55,406
lf Jawahar Naidu dies...

945
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:56,581
Come closer.

946
01:13:57,253 --> 01:13:59,915
l'm moving closely with him,
l think he'll die soon.

947
01:14:00,089 --> 01:14:02,250
lf he dies...

948
01:14:02,424 --> 01:14:04,255
Play how the program would be!

949
01:14:05,427 --> 01:14:07,418
Light of labour has been put off!

950
01:14:07,596 --> 01:14:09,757
Hope of the poor has been lost!

951
01:14:09,932 --> 01:14:12,924
With the death of our beloved
leader Jawahar Naidu,

952
01:14:13,102 --> 01:14:14,592
entire has gone silent!

953
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:17,933
State is wet with tears of sorrow!

954
01:14:20,109 --> 01:14:21,269
How is it?

955
01:14:22,111 --> 01:14:23,271
How is it?

956
01:14:25,948 --> 01:14:28,781
Was it too long?...

957
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:34,115
Where were you all these days?
Never saw you!

958
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:38,283
lf you take such precautionary measures,
l'll kill you live on TV.

959
01:14:39,128 --> 01:14:40,288
On live!

960
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:46,124
By now he would got a tight slap!

961
01:14:49,972 --> 01:14:51,803
How is it, sir?
- How is it?!

962
01:14:51,974 --> 01:14:55,967
Rambabu has joined, right?
How his performance is!

963
01:14:56,145 --> 01:14:58,807
Why is he so obedient?
He's too soft!

964
01:14:58,981 --> 01:15:03,145
ls it? Your editor is my friend.

965
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:06,982
l got the message of
what had happened there!

966
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:10,648
Come here, editor.

967
01:15:13,162 --> 01:15:15,995
Have you sent the message
of what had happened here?

968
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:20,397
Did you send the message?

969
01:15:25,174 --> 01:15:27,506
How happy l was, uncle!

970
01:15:28,844 --> 01:15:32,678
First time l had to drink
because of Smitha.

971
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:35,180
l got you a Beer recently, right?

972
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:37,512
That's Beer and this is liquor.

973
01:15:37,686 --> 01:15:41,520
Why are you equating them?
l said its first time!

974
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:42,850
Okay, drink.

975
01:15:49,698 --> 01:15:50,687
Tell me one thing, uncle.

976
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:57,533
When l already love,
her entry is villainy or not?

977
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:01,203
You mustn't give a gap and
you gave a long gap.

978
01:16:01,377 --> 01:16:02,708
You're right, uncle.

979
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:05,040
When we went on bike,

980
01:16:05,214 --> 01:16:11,551
l made a mistake
of keeping camera kit in front.- Yes.

981
01:16:12,054 --> 01:16:14,545
Had l sat rubbing against him, the job
would've been done long back!

982
01:16:14,723 --> 01:16:19,217
lf you talk to her and join that
channel, you can be close to him.

983
01:16:19,395 --> 01:16:22,558
What are you saying, uncle?
l'll never bend.

984
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:24,062
That too before her!

985
01:16:26,235 --> 01:16:29,727
l think we're thinking too much!
ls she so dangerous?

986
01:16:29,905 --> 01:16:31,065
Snake, uncle!

987
01:16:34,576 --> 01:16:38,068
Her make-up, her matching dresses,
her low neck blouses.

988
01:16:38,247 --> 01:16:39,578
Snakes are like that, uncle.

989
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:42,478
Drink!

990
01:16:52,594 --> 01:16:53,925
Why is her car here?

991
01:17:00,769 --> 01:17:02,600
Snake got down from car, uncle.

992
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:07,438
Cobra too got down!

993
01:17:09,778 --> 01:17:11,109
Oh no! They're coming here!

994
01:17:11,947 --> 01:17:14,609
We get fine tea here.
You know that?- ls it?

995
01:17:15,451 --> 01:17:17,783
Uncle, look at her gait!

996
01:17:30,466 --> 01:17:32,457
Let's hear their conversation.
- Come.

997
01:17:43,145 --> 01:17:46,979
Did you fall in love
with anyone, Ramu?

998
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:50,141
Say Ganga!
- No!

999
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:55,150
You think anyone would've
fallen in love with me?

1000
01:17:55,324 --> 01:17:57,986
Why not? l think it would've
been a traffic jam!

1001
01:18:02,664 --> 01:18:07,658
You think do l love anyone?
- How would l know?

1002
01:18:07,836 --> 01:18:09,167
Not yet!

1003
01:18:09,338 --> 01:18:10,999
l'm telling you, l'm single.

1004
01:18:16,345 --> 01:18:20,839
See uncle, she's making an open offer.
Enticing him!

1005
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:25,851
Come here with me.
Don't stay here. Come here.

1006
01:18:26,522 --> 01:18:27,887
No uncle.

1007
01:18:28,524 --> 01:18:32,858
What you told me now if you
tell him, he would understand.

1008
01:18:33,028 --> 01:18:34,518
Look at her,
how well she's expressing!

1009
01:18:34,696 --> 01:18:38,530
l'm single, l want a gutsy man!

1010
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,691
She's telling him.
What did you tell him?

1011
01:18:40,869 --> 01:18:42,860
Having my drinks and supporting her!

1012
01:18:43,038 --> 01:18:45,029
We're left with drinks as company!

1013
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:48,870
lf l'm right, by now she
would've kissed him.

1014
01:18:49,044 --> 01:18:50,705
Really?
- lndeed!

1015
01:19:13,402 --> 01:19:17,736
The girl is rocking...
her beauty is ravishing...

1016
01:19:21,243 --> 01:19:25,577
Stop fighting...don't boast...

1017
01:19:36,592 --> 01:19:43,088
You're alluring and hit straight
into my heart like a bullet...

1018
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:49,932
l got torn like ticket and fell like
wicket, why are you staring at me?

1019
01:19:50,105 --> 01:19:53,768
Hey girl! You're sweet peppermint...

1020
01:19:53,942 --> 01:19:57,605
l'm squeezing up, come to me
sporting flowers in hair...

1021
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:01,613
Hey boy, l'll cozy up to you...

1022
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:05,947
There's no interval for us
till we sweat it out...

1023
01:20:49,665 --> 01:20:53,658
Your silk skirt is fire to burn me...

1024
01:20:53,835 --> 01:20:57,669
Listen to me,
O mischievous young man...

1025
01:20:57,839 --> 01:21:01,331
Your vital statistics
are mind boggling...

1026
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:05,503
Hey handsome man, take on me...

1027
01:21:05,681 --> 01:21:13,019
Hey love devil, you're too good...

1028
01:21:13,188 --> 01:21:17,682
l'll rock your youth...

1029
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:19,914
Let's play the game of love quickly...

1030
01:22:20,088 --> 01:22:23,751
Look how fast the kid is...

1031
01:22:23,925 --> 01:22:27,417
l'll leave my mark in all
directions with my kisses...

1032
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:31,589
Take me and rock me...

1033
01:22:31,767 --> 01:22:39,264
Hey Venus! l'm here for you...

1034
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:43,935
l saw you and
stole your entire property...

1035
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:12,129
Birthday wishes to 'Hope of the poor'
Jawahar Naidu's son Rana Naidu

1036
01:23:13,642 --> 01:23:15,473
lt's time, people are waiting!

1037
01:23:15,644 --> 01:23:17,976
Wait! Shouldn't l've a drink?
Don't add water.

1038
01:23:22,818 --> 01:23:43,161
Long live Rana!

1039
01:23:43,338 --> 01:23:47,172
l didn't know till now
why was l born?

1040
01:23:47,342 --> 01:23:49,674
l don't know the
meaning of my life.

1041
01:23:50,846 --> 01:23:53,508
But after seeing the
sea of humans here,

1042
01:23:54,182 --> 01:23:56,844
feeling the love of
millions of hearts,

1043
01:23:57,519 --> 01:24:01,182
after seeing your affection
and emotions, l've understood,

1044
01:24:01,857 --> 01:24:04,849
l was born to die for you!

1045
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:15,359
This is my last birthday!

1046
01:24:16,538 --> 01:24:21,601
Every moment of my life
is dedicated to you!

1047
01:24:26,715 --> 01:24:30,549
Enough! Enough of the tears
you had shed till now,

1048
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,051
enough of empty stomachs!

1049
01:24:33,221 --> 01:24:37,715
Till every Telugu man in this
state has two square meals,

1050
01:24:37,893 --> 01:24:40,384
l'll eat only once in a day!

1051
01:24:41,563 --> 01:24:46,227
Though toiling hard,
working till body tires,

1052
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:50,064
Telugu man isn't unable to eat well,
who is responsible for it?

1053
01:24:50,739 --> 01:24:51,728
Who?

1054
01:24:53,074 --> 01:24:58,239
People from other states who have
come here to loot our state.

1055
01:24:59,748 --> 01:25:04,242
Tamils, Malayalees,
Punjabis, Bengalis,

1056
01:25:04,419 --> 01:25:06,250
let it be anyone,

1057
01:25:06,922 --> 01:25:09,584
everyone is a plunderer!

1058
01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:14,759
Schools, temples, hotels,
shops, pawn shops,

1059
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:16,591
everything belongs to them!

1060
01:25:17,098 --> 01:25:19,259
How long this plundering will go on?

1061
01:25:19,434 --> 01:25:20,992
How long?

1062
01:25:21,603 --> 01:25:23,093
Stop it!

1063
01:25:23,438 --> 01:25:28,603
Chase out those robbers who
are stealing our mother Telugu!

1064
01:25:33,114 --> 01:25:35,105
We don't want Palghat hotels,

1065
01:25:36,451 --> 01:25:38,112
don't want lyengar bakeries,

1066
01:25:39,287 --> 01:25:41,312
don't want Punjabi dhabas,

1067
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:45,783
don't want Marwari pawn shops,
don't want Malayalee nurses!

1068
01:25:50,465 --> 01:25:53,957
This state belongs to mother Telugu!

1069
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:59,304
This state belongs to her
children only!

1070
01:26:00,141 --> 01:26:04,305
Only they must be here!
Nobody else must be here!

1071
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:09,815
lf this agitation seeks my death,
l'm ready!

1072
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:12,980
Are you ready?

1073
01:26:57,699 --> 01:26:58,688
Greetings sir.

1074
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:10,205
Reports with us are more genuine
than from police and intelligence.

1075
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:14,379
We cover from the spot without bothering
if it is stone or bullet that hit us.

1076
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:17,712
Situation is 10 times more
dangerous than what you think, sir.

1077
01:27:17,886 --> 01:27:20,878
lf you release news of 10 deaths,
at least 100 would've died.

1078
01:27:21,056 --> 01:27:23,718
lf news is 100 deaths,
it would be 1000 deaths!

1079
01:27:24,726 --> 01:27:26,887
They're beating up people
from neighbouring states.

1080
01:27:27,062 --> 01:27:29,053
They're looting and
ransacking their property.

1081
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:31,721
Mothers are on streets with kids!

1082
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,561
This is not an agitation
but atrocity!

1083
01:27:34,402 --> 01:27:38,566
This is not a memorandum
but we reporters' duty!

1084
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:42,403
Please take it as a complaint.

1085
01:27:42,577 --> 01:27:44,135
Arrest Rana!

1086
01:27:57,759 --> 01:28:01,593
Congrats son!
You got an arrest warrant!

1087
01:28:01,763 --> 01:28:04,755
With God's grace everything
is going our way, son!

1088
01:28:04,933 --> 01:28:08,096
Go immedaitely to our
Dilsukhnagar guest house.

1089
01:28:08,937 --> 01:28:10,097
l'm already there, father!

1090
01:28:10,271 --> 01:28:12,262
You're becoming CM!

1091
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:16,604
The days you spend in jail,
l'll burn down the state!

1092
01:28:16,778 --> 01:28:18,439
Telugu agitation is boiling up!

1093
01:28:18,613 --> 01:28:20,945
Arrest warrant has been
issued for Rana!

1094
01:28:21,116 --> 01:28:23,949
Agitators say handcuffs
can't stop the agitation.

1095
01:28:27,288 --> 01:28:36,788
Long live Rana!

1096
01:28:36,965 --> 01:28:39,957
Send him here!

1097
01:28:52,313 --> 01:28:54,474
How is my initiation into politics?

1098
01:28:54,649 --> 01:28:55,980
Very good!

1099
01:28:56,985 --> 01:29:00,477
You said this is your last birthday,
right? lndeed it'll be the last.

1100
01:29:00,989 --> 01:29:03,981
Now, l'm not an ordinary leader.

1101
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,649
You can't even reach me.

1102
01:29:06,494 --> 01:29:09,657
There are millions of
people between us!

1103
01:29:09,831 --> 01:29:11,662
You'd die amidst the crowd only!

1104
01:29:13,001 --> 01:29:15,834
Your warnings and warrants
were lucky charms for me.

1105
01:29:16,004 --> 01:29:17,835
You've lodged a complaint, right?

1106
01:29:18,006 --> 01:29:20,338
Do you know how would l
use it in my favour?

1107
01:29:20,508 --> 01:29:22,499
Police would be here
in few minutes.

1108
01:29:22,677 --> 01:29:26,010
You may think l'll get arrested
and go with them in van,

1109
01:29:27,682 --> 01:29:32,016
l'll walk to Khairatabad
from here,

1110
01:29:32,353 --> 01:29:34,514
it'll take 24 hours,

1111
01:29:35,023 --> 01:29:37,355
crowds will throng entire stretch,

1112
01:29:37,525 --> 01:29:39,015
a massive congregation,

1113
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:48,697
entire state must standstill
and watch me on TV all the day!

1114
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:50,928
What did you say?

1115
01:29:51,706 --> 01:29:54,869
lf your media people don't write
about me or show me on TV,

1116
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:56,533
l would vanish!

1117
01:29:56,878 --> 01:30:00,370
lf you've guts, tell media people
not to telecast this program.

1118
01:30:00,548 --> 01:30:04,882
You guys are items! You need
an item for every 30 minutes.

1119
01:30:05,053 --> 01:30:07,044
Your life is dependent on me.

1120
01:30:08,389 --> 01:30:11,881
Complete yourjourney,
let's meet in Khairatabad.

1121
01:30:12,227 --> 01:30:13,387
Come!

1122
01:30:17,232 --> 01:30:18,062
Come no guys!

1123
01:30:18,233 --> 01:30:27,232
Long like Rana!

1124
01:30:27,408 --> 01:30:28,898
Rana Naidu who received
the arrest warrant,

1125
01:30:29,077 --> 01:30:30,237
instead of going in police van,

1126
01:30:30,411 --> 01:30:34,905
he's walking to Khairatabad
police station with his party men.

1127
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:37,745
The program has begun,

1128
01:30:37,919 --> 01:30:40,410
watch it live
having drinks happily.

1129
01:30:40,588 --> 01:30:47,926
Long live people's
favourite son Rana!

1130
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:57,595
Telugu women must offer camphor
welcome to my son at Malakpet.

1131
01:30:57,772 --> 01:31:07,113
Long live Rana!

1132
01:31:07,282 --> 01:31:10,274
l thought only his father had,
he too has good following.

1133
01:31:25,133 --> 01:31:29,297
Political pundits say this will
lead to early by-elections.

1134
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:31,631
Sathish Sharma for Aaj Tak!

1135
01:31:35,476 --> 01:31:36,966
Students, workers and women,

1136
01:31:37,145 --> 01:31:39,807
everyone is talking about
one man only!

1137
01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:45,643
Long live the leadership of Rana!

1138
01:31:54,996 --> 01:31:56,327
He's 100% right!

1139
01:31:56,497 --> 01:31:58,328
This agitation started off very late.

1140
01:31:58,499 --> 01:32:01,991
We don't have the unity which
people of other states have.

1141
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:03,831
They say Victory to Marathi,
Victory to Assam,

1142
01:32:04,005 --> 01:32:05,666
they say Victory to Malayalee
and Bengali!

1143
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,674
Don't we know how much Tamils
love their language and state?

1144
01:32:09,844 --> 01:32:12,506
This is a day when every
Telugu man is proud of.

1145
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,341
Don't politicize the agitation.

1146
01:32:14,515 --> 01:32:19,009
More importantly media channels like you,
don't play politics with this agitation.

1147
01:32:19,187 --> 01:32:25,353
Long live the leadership of Rana!

1148
01:32:25,526 --> 01:32:27,858
l want your interview
before getting arrested.

1149
01:32:28,029 --> 01:32:30,020
No brother, stay away from him.

1150
01:32:31,366 --> 01:32:33,357
lf your agitation is sincere,
talk to me.

1151
01:32:33,534 --> 01:32:35,365
No brother, please listen to me.

1152
01:32:37,205 --> 01:32:39,366
What? What do you want?

1153
01:32:41,209 --> 01:32:43,200
Do you've respect for
mother Telugu or not?

1154
01:32:43,878 --> 01:32:47,211
lf mother Telugu asks,
l'll give my life also.

1155
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:51,381
Did you ever see mother Telugu?

1156
01:32:52,053 --> 01:32:55,045
Why are you asking
meaningless questions?

1157
01:32:55,223 --> 01:32:56,884
Like we do have a mother Telugu,

1158
01:32:57,058 --> 01:32:58,548
do other states' people
have a mother or not?

1159
01:32:58,726 --> 01:33:00,216
Everyone would've a mother,
so what?

1160
01:33:01,062 --> 01:33:03,895
You hate mothers of
other states, right?- l hate them!

1161
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:09,726
lt means mother Telugu hates mothers
of Tamil, Marathi, Punjabi, Bengali,

1162
01:33:09,904 --> 01:33:11,895
you say that, right?

1163
01:33:12,073 --> 01:33:12,562
l don't know!

1164
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:15,231
Why are you fighting then
without knowing it?

1165
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:18,743
Are these mothers second wives,
sisters or daughters of Mother lndia?

1166
01:33:18,913 --> 01:33:20,244
Fighting amongst you!

1167
01:33:20,415 --> 01:33:22,747
You're interpreting the
agitation wrongly.

1168
01:33:22,917 --> 01:33:24,908
You don't have respect
for other states,

1169
01:33:25,086 --> 01:33:27,077
so you don't have the right
to salute the national flag.

1170
01:33:27,255 --> 01:33:28,745
l say you're not qualified
to sing national anthem.

1171
01:33:28,923 --> 01:33:30,584
What do you say?
- Why not?

1172
01:33:31,259 --> 01:33:32,248
This is my country,

1173
01:33:32,427 --> 01:33:34,918
l'll sing
national anthem and fly the flag!

1174
01:33:35,096 --> 01:33:40,500
Punjab, Sind, Gujarat, Maratha,
Dravida, Utkal, Vanga...

1175
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:44,431
You don't have respect for any mother,

1176
01:33:44,605 --> 01:33:46,596
so l say you don't have any
right to sing national anthem.

1177
01:33:46,774 --> 01:33:48,264
What do you say man?

1178
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:51,771
You're confusing me!

1179
01:33:51,946 --> 01:33:54,437
Am l confusing you?

1180
01:33:54,615 --> 01:33:56,276
l'm asking you without confusion.
- Go ahead.

1181
01:33:56,451 --> 01:33:58,442
ls your brother doing business
in America or not?- So what if he does?

1182
01:33:58,619 --> 01:34:00,610
Do you own a 5 star hotel
in Singapore or not?- So what?

1183
01:34:00,788 --> 01:34:02,949
Do you own power plants in Sikkim
and apple gardens in Kashmir or not?

1184
01:34:03,124 --> 01:34:05,456
That's my personal business!

1185
01:34:05,626 --> 01:34:06,786
lt is personal!

1186
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:08,622
You can run business
everywhere and loot them.

1187
01:34:08,796 --> 01:34:09,956
That is your personal!

1188
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:12,292
But it is wrong if a man comes
from Chennai to sell idli here!

1189
01:34:12,467 --> 01:34:15,300
lf a man from Udupi comes to
sell sweetmeats, it's looting!

1190
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:17,961
Your car driver is a Marathi,

1191
01:34:18,139 --> 01:34:20,471
your children's tuition
teacher is a Bengali,

1192
01:34:20,641 --> 01:34:27,137
it's a Malayalee nurse who looks
after your paralysis stricken father.

1193
01:34:27,315 --> 01:34:29,647
Moreover you need Benz car
to go around.

1194
01:34:29,817 --> 01:34:30,806
For your evening drinks,

1195
01:34:30,985 --> 01:34:33,545
you want Chettinadu chicken
of Tamil Nadu,

1196
01:34:36,324 --> 01:34:37,814
what do you say about this?

1197
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:42,152
Corner him like that!

1198
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:44,992
Fantastic!
Rambabu is sensational!

1199
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:49,500
All efforts have gone
down the drain!

1200
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:51,331
l'm asking you,
what do you say?

1201
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:56,503
What a counter attack!

1202
01:35:07,688 --> 01:35:09,849
Will you say we're just items?

1203
01:35:10,691 --> 01:35:12,852
You're the item we got today!

1204
01:35:26,374 --> 01:35:29,866
How dare you insult our leader!

1205
01:35:35,216 --> 01:35:40,711
We women of the state
don't want you here!

1206
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,551
You'll lose eyes if you abuse women.

1207
01:35:44,725 --> 01:35:48,058
l don't mind if you abuse us,
how dare you abuse our mothers, bloody!

1208
01:35:56,404 --> 01:35:59,237
Oh God! He killed my sister!
Why are you watching? Kill him!

1209
01:35:59,407 --> 01:36:06,245
Kill him...bash him! Go!

1210
01:36:11,419 --> 01:36:15,082
Oh sister-in-law! He beat you too!

1211
01:36:15,256 --> 01:36:17,247
He has no respect for women!

1212
01:36:17,425 --> 01:36:20,758
Will you beat women?
Bloody rogue!

1213
01:36:40,948 --> 01:36:44,611
Can't take him like that,
get weapons!

1214
01:36:44,785 --> 01:36:46,685
Break his bones!

1215
01:36:54,629 --> 01:36:57,621
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

1216
01:37:08,476 --> 01:37:13,971
Sister Bullemma, come! Kill him!

1217
01:37:22,323 --> 01:37:24,814
Shall we fight it out, Rambabu?

1218
01:37:25,159 --> 01:37:27,719
Not fight, l'll knock you out!

1219
01:37:54,355 --> 01:37:58,519
Get acid bottles and
throw at him!

1220
01:38:10,037 --> 01:38:12,767
Will you throw acid on me?
Come on do it.

1221
01:38:13,874 --> 01:38:16,866
Will you run the roller over me?
Do it?

1222
01:38:18,546 --> 01:38:23,040
Sir, he's beating up women!
He's killing innocent women!

1223
01:38:23,217 --> 01:38:26,050
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!

1224
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,381
Are you innocent girls?

1225
01:38:31,559 --> 01:38:34,050
Will you become women if you
wear petticoats and saris?

1226
01:38:35,896 --> 01:38:37,227
ls he sister Bullemma?

1227
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:45,236
Take him to station and
strip, you'll know the truth.

1228
01:38:49,744 --> 01:38:53,077
You were also born as demon
like Thataki and Soorpanaka,

1229
01:38:53,247 --> 01:38:56,580
we've the facility to kill
you since time of Treta era!

1230
01:38:56,751 --> 01:38:59,242
lf you talk about differences
between men and women,

1231
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:01,820
l'll behead you before
Goddess Kali in Calcutta!

1232
01:39:02,757 --> 01:39:04,486
Go...go!

1233
01:39:23,944 --> 01:39:24,933
Hi!

1234
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,611
l've seen you that day.

1235
01:39:28,616 --> 01:39:29,605
What can l do?

1236
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:34,444
l've been working with that
channel for years, madam.

1237
01:39:34,622 --> 01:39:35,782
Did they fire you?

1238
01:39:36,123 --> 01:39:40,617
No, if you offerjob here,
l'll shift to your place.

1239
01:39:40,795 --> 01:39:42,956
Why? Aren't you happy
with pay package?

1240
01:39:43,964 --> 01:39:45,295
Yes.

1241
01:39:45,466 --> 01:39:48,629
We'll pay you lesser here.
- No problem.

1242
01:39:53,974 --> 01:39:56,465
Rambabu is here, right?

1243
01:39:56,644 --> 01:39:59,306
lf l join here,
we can work as team again.

1244
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,469
What would you do?

1245
01:40:00,648 --> 01:40:02,479
Rambabu with cameraman Ganga!

1246
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:04,981
People got used to it.

1247
01:40:05,319 --> 01:40:07,310
State is fixed with it.

1248
01:40:07,488 --> 01:40:11,322
State is fan of Rambabu not you.

1249
01:40:12,827 --> 01:40:14,158
No madam...

1250
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:19,664
Look, Rambabu is concentrating
on his work.

1251
01:40:19,834 --> 01:40:22,667
l don't like you to disturb him.

1252
01:40:22,837 --> 01:40:24,168
Won't you offer me ajob?

1253
01:40:27,174 --> 01:40:29,005
Why would you offer me
ajob, damn lady?

1254
01:40:29,176 --> 01:40:31,007
Why would you let me meet him?

1255
01:40:31,512 --> 01:40:34,345
You're snake!
You're an epitome of desire!

1256
01:40:34,515 --> 01:40:36,346
What the hell are you talking?

1257
01:40:36,517 --> 01:40:39,680
Why are you stopping your car
behind Apollo hospital at midnight?

1258
01:40:39,854 --> 01:40:41,845
Don't l know about your
midnight masala?

1259
01:40:42,022 --> 01:40:44,183
Do you think l'm not following you?

1260
01:40:44,358 --> 01:40:48,021
l'm Cameraman Ganga,
l've every single frame!

1261
01:40:48,195 --> 01:40:51,358
Do you want my Rambabu?
Didn't you find anyone else?

1262
01:40:51,532 --> 01:40:53,363
Have you finished with
everyone in town?

1263
01:40:53,534 --> 01:40:54,865
Why are you talking nonsense?

1264
01:40:55,035 --> 01:40:59,199
lf you roam around with
my man at midnight,

1265
01:40:59,373 --> 01:41:01,204
and take him out to
lunches and dinners,

1266
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:02,535
l'll finish you!

1267
01:41:05,713 --> 01:41:07,874
Have a fling with him,
please leave my man!

1268
01:41:09,717 --> 01:41:13,380
Get lost? You get lost,
your father get lost...

1269
01:41:13,554 --> 01:41:14,714
You're a snake!

1270
01:41:20,895 --> 01:41:21,884
Get my luggage!

1271
01:41:22,563 --> 01:41:25,396
l'll stay here from now.
- Stay here?

1272
01:41:32,573 --> 01:41:35,736
Why are you crying, Smitha?

1273
01:41:38,078 --> 01:41:38,908
What happened?

1274
01:41:40,414 --> 01:41:45,078
Are you trying to blackmail
my man emotionally?

1275
01:41:45,252 --> 01:41:47,243
lf you call him on phone again,

1276
01:41:47,421 --> 01:41:49,981
l'll blow up your exchange?
Cut it!

1277
01:41:51,759 --> 01:41:53,920
This is not the right way
to speak with Smitha.

1278
01:41:54,094 --> 01:41:57,757
Ji! l'll break her b...
- Oh God!

1279
01:41:57,932 --> 01:42:00,765
Do you know who she is?
Scheming lady!

1280
01:42:00,935 --> 01:42:05,099
Please abuse Smitha with bad words.
l can't hear it.

1281
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:06,599
Do you know how sensitive she is?

1282
01:42:06,774 --> 01:42:07,763
ls it? How sensitive?

1283
01:42:07,942 --> 01:42:10,433
She's very compassionate about
others, you know that?

1284
01:42:10,611 --> 01:42:13,603
Forget about humans, she didn't eat
for 2 days when her dog got hurt.

1285
01:42:13,781 --> 01:42:16,773
She distributes food and sweets
in orphanages on her birthday,

1286
01:42:16,951 --> 01:42:18,282
she's a still photographer too.

1287
01:42:18,452 --> 01:42:20,943
Did you ever see her photo collection?

1288
01:42:21,121 --> 01:42:22,952
l'm also a photographer!

1289
01:42:23,123 --> 01:42:25,114
But you can't see what l take!

1290
01:42:26,961 --> 01:42:28,952
You're completely
misunderstanding me.

1291
01:42:29,129 --> 01:42:31,620
l'm telling something and
you're taking it wrongly.

1292
01:42:31,799 --> 01:42:34,290
l'll you one thing about Smitha,

1293
01:42:34,468 --> 01:42:36,800
do you know how she cries
if it doesn't rain?

1294
01:42:38,806 --> 01:42:41,639
Does she want good rains and
greenery everywhere?

1295
01:42:41,809 --> 01:42:44,141
Can't she eat without
the smell of soil?

1296
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:49,643
These are snake's habits,
men fall for such things only.

1297
01:42:49,817 --> 01:42:52,809
Why are you crying?

1298
01:42:52,987 --> 01:42:54,477
By any chance, do you love me?

1299
01:42:54,655 --> 01:42:55,815
Am l not then?

1300
01:42:57,324 --> 01:43:00,816
Oh God! Would've been better
if you' told me this earlier.

1301
01:43:00,995 --> 01:43:02,326
What happened now?

1302
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:06,322
Smitha and l...very close...

1303
01:43:08,836 --> 01:43:12,169
How close?
- Very deep...deep...

1304
01:43:12,673 --> 01:43:15,005
l'll burn down both of you
along with the cot.

1305
01:43:15,175 --> 01:43:16,164
You should've told me
this earlier,

1306
01:43:16,343 --> 01:43:18,174
how would l know if you
keep it in your heart?

1307
01:43:18,345 --> 01:43:24,511
Didn't you know about what she
likes rain, dogs, my foot, hell?

1308
01:43:24,685 --> 01:43:25,845
Did she tell you?

1309
01:43:28,022 --> 01:43:32,686
l'm a girl,
how can l tell you openly?

1310
01:43:34,361 --> 01:43:36,192
Moreover l'm an extraordinary girl.

1311
01:43:42,202 --> 01:43:45,365
lf you don't mind,
l'll tell you a thing.

1312
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:50,370
Every girl in this world
is ordinary!

1313
01:43:50,544 --> 01:43:53,377
You look extraordinary
because of our craze,

1314
01:43:53,547 --> 01:43:55,037
all of you are ordinary!

1315
01:43:55,549 --> 01:43:57,210
We look with eyes covered
by sexual desire,

1316
01:43:57,384 --> 01:43:58,874
so you look wonderful,

1317
01:43:59,053 --> 01:44:01,715
we look at you after drinks,
you look stupendous!

1318
01:44:01,889 --> 01:44:06,383
somebody writes a song and
we think it is about you,

1319
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,721
just a layer of kohl on eyes
can melt us,

1320
01:44:08,896 --> 01:44:11,057
we're happy seeing a flash
on your waist,

1321
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,560
just a small smile is enough,

1322
01:44:14,735 --> 01:44:18,899
we go on a hunt to find
place to build a Taj Mahal!

1323
01:44:20,407 --> 01:44:22,398
Tell me one thing, Ganga!

1324
01:44:22,576 --> 01:44:25,409
What's the connection
between girls and sea waves?

1325
01:44:25,579 --> 01:44:27,911
What's the link between
you and moon?

1326
01:44:28,082 --> 01:44:30,243
ls your laugh like moonlight?

1327
01:44:30,417 --> 01:44:34,911
Full moonlight!
lt's shear madness! What else then?

1328
01:44:36,757 --> 01:44:41,592
Basically men are born poets,
so you're managing to survive,

1329
01:44:41,762 --> 01:44:43,753
no woman is extraordinary!

1330
01:44:44,264 --> 01:44:50,100
lt means no woman is extraordinary,
all are one and same!

1331
01:44:57,778 --> 01:45:01,270
One thing you go know is...

1332
01:45:02,282 --> 01:45:04,773
Boys like ordinary girls.

1333
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,783
Being a complete woman is
to remain ordinary.

1334
01:45:10,290 --> 01:45:12,781
You know our Savithri, right?
She was an ordinary woman.

1335
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,121
You're also ordinary!

1336
01:45:15,295 --> 01:45:17,957
The more you're ordinary
the more beautiful you are!

1337
01:45:20,467 --> 01:45:23,129
But you're extraordinary!

1338
01:45:23,971 --> 01:45:26,963
You hit my heart straight!

1339
01:45:28,142 --> 01:45:30,804
Please don't leave me.
- Why would l after telling me?

1340
01:45:30,978 --> 01:45:33,970
Come and hug me tightly!

1341
01:46:06,346 --> 01:46:09,509
When you tremble...

1342
01:46:09,683 --> 01:46:12,516
Miracles are happening...

1343
01:46:12,686 --> 01:46:15,348
O girl, you're like McKenna's Gold...

1344
01:46:15,522 --> 01:46:18,514
My heart is breaking into ajig...

1345
01:46:18,692 --> 01:46:23,026
l like you boy...cow boy...
O mischievous boy...

1346
01:46:23,197 --> 01:46:27,361
l've come to you, boy...
enjoy my strong tea...

1347
01:46:27,534 --> 01:46:30,526
Are you silk chiffon
or love tornado?

1348
01:46:30,704 --> 01:46:33,036
l'll steal you...

1349
01:46:33,707 --> 01:46:39,543
One, two, three, it's blast..
On falling head over heels in love...

1350
01:46:39,713 --> 01:46:45,709
One, two, three, come here O girl,
l'll blow you up with excitement...

1351
01:47:24,424 --> 01:47:30,260
You lit fire in me
with your lips...

1352
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:36,426
You've tried to steal me...
tried to take me away with you...

1353
01:47:36,603 --> 01:47:42,599
You made me sleep with your kiss
chloroform and troubled me...

1354
01:47:42,776 --> 01:47:48,942
l was always after you,
fell for you at first sight...

1355
01:48:59,853 --> 01:49:05,519
There's heroin in you and
you're my heroine...

1356
01:49:05,692 --> 01:49:11,688
Fire me with your
gun totting eyes...

1357
01:49:11,865 --> 01:49:18,031
You played the music of Shehnai...
How can l take this happiness?

1358
01:49:18,205 --> 01:49:24,371
lt's you everywhere l see,
l'm lucky to get you, my Kurosawa...

1359
01:50:04,251 --> 01:50:08,745
Nephew, agitation fizzled
before the surge.

1360
01:50:08,922 --> 01:50:11,254
You made the mistake by
giving interview to Rambabu.

1361
01:50:11,425 --> 01:50:13,416
Never speak directly to media.

1362
01:50:14,928 --> 01:50:16,793
Had you avoided live show,
everything would be fine.

1363
01:50:35,115 --> 01:50:38,107
Father!
- What son?

1364
01:50:38,285 --> 01:50:42,119
To put life into my agitation,
l need your emotional speech.

1365
01:50:43,290 --> 01:50:44,621
Yes, brother-in-law!

1366
01:50:44,791 --> 01:50:47,954
For your old theatrics,
if you add few tears also!

1367
01:50:48,128 --> 01:50:49,288
We'll rock it.

1368
01:51:07,147 --> 01:51:14,144
The political colour they're
painting on my agitation,

1369
01:51:14,321 --> 01:51:20,317
l think l'll not see the dream
of Telugu people come true,

1370
01:51:22,496 --> 01:51:30,494
When l see these atrocities
and arrests,

1371
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:34,663
l feel l've lost as a leader!

1372
01:51:36,343 --> 01:51:41,337
But l'm asking you,
what was my mistake?

1373
01:51:42,349 --> 01:51:47,844
l sought work for poor people.
ls it crime?

1374
01:51:48,355 --> 01:51:54,351
l sought food for poor people.
ls it crime?

1375
01:51:56,696 --> 01:52:02,032
People here can't afford to
eat rice and buttermilk too!

1376
01:52:03,203 --> 01:52:09,199
Neither l nor my son want
any seats of power!

1377
01:52:10,377 --> 01:52:16,043
lf the price of this
agitation is my life, take it,

1378
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:18,040
l say take it away!

1379
01:52:19,052 --> 01:52:27,391
But bring down this corrupt
and fascist govt.,

1380
01:52:27,561 --> 01:52:30,553
Save this Telugu state!

1381
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,561
Live as Telugu people!

1382
01:52:32,732 --> 01:52:35,929
Die as Telugu people!

1383
01:52:43,076 --> 01:52:44,236
How is it?

1384
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:49,742
What a speech, father!
What an expression!

1385
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:51,907
When would l reach to
your level, father?

1386
01:52:52,085 --> 01:52:54,417
l can never reach it, father.

1387
01:52:54,588 --> 01:52:56,920
You'll upstage me, son!

1388
01:52:57,591 --> 01:53:01,584
Release this video, public
reaction would be overwhelming.

1389
01:53:01,761 --> 01:53:05,094
lf not this, something else,
l'll release fantastic videos.

1390
01:53:05,265 --> 01:53:09,929
At any cost, l'll make
you CM, l will do it!

1391
01:53:10,103 --> 01:53:13,266
l've got an idea, father.
- What's it son?

1392
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,932
What if this becomes your
last speech, father?

1393
01:53:22,782 --> 01:53:25,273
What are you saying?

1394
01:53:26,453 --> 01:53:29,945
You had seen many things in life,
you were CM,

1395
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:32,615
don't you want your son
to become CM?

1396
01:53:33,126 --> 01:53:35,287
What are you saying?

1397
01:53:35,462 --> 01:53:37,453
You said you'd die for Telugu people.

1398
01:53:37,631 --> 01:53:38,791
Can't you die for your son?

1399
01:53:38,965 --> 01:53:43,299
What are you saying?
What is he saying?

1400
01:53:48,642 --> 01:53:53,136
Nephew, don't delay it.
Let's do it.

1401
01:53:54,147 --> 01:53:56,707
You too!

1402
01:53:59,653 --> 01:54:03,020
Hold on for two minutes,
your son would become CM.

1403
01:54:15,335 --> 01:54:17,496
Death is inevitable.

1404
01:54:17,671 --> 01:54:20,333
Coming back as another life
is also inevitable.

1405
01:54:20,507 --> 01:54:24,671
No need to feel sad for
the inevitable.

1406
01:54:39,025 --> 01:54:42,517
Jawahar Naidu's last words
before he died.

1407
01:54:42,696 --> 01:54:47,861
l sought work for poor people.
ls it crime?

1408
01:54:48,034 --> 01:54:53,870
l sought food for poor people.
ls it crime?

1409
01:54:54,541 --> 01:55:00,878
People here can't afford to
eat rice and buttermilk too!

1410
01:55:01,047 --> 01:55:07,213
Neither l nor my son want
any seats of power!

1411
01:55:08,221 --> 01:55:13,386
lf the price of this
agitation is my life, take it,

1412
01:55:14,227 --> 01:55:15,888
l say take it away!

1413
01:55:16,062 --> 01:55:18,053
Light of the workers has been put off.

1414
01:55:18,231 --> 01:55:20,222
Hope of the poor melted away!

1415
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:25,235
State has gone silent with
sudden death of Jawahar Naidu.

1416
01:55:25,405 --> 01:55:27,396
These are precautionary measures.

1417
01:55:27,574 --> 01:55:29,405
Only media can smell the future.

1418
01:55:29,576 --> 01:55:31,737
How can make programs
suddenly for deaths.

1419
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:33,572
What will he lose?
He'll die instantly.

1420
01:55:33,747 --> 01:55:35,237
Who would give the footage?

1421
01:55:35,415 --> 01:55:37,246
How would that mental know
the troubles of media?

1422
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:39,408
He comes, he beats and leaves.

1423
01:55:39,586 --> 01:55:42,919
And you send messages to him!

1424
01:55:43,089 --> 01:55:45,751
Bobby, come.
- Me? He?

1425
01:55:45,925 --> 01:55:47,415
You! Come!

1426
01:55:48,261 --> 01:55:49,922
He's calling, l'll go.
- Come.

1427
01:55:50,930 --> 01:55:52,921
Come.
- l'll come back if he lets me.- Come.

1428
01:55:57,771 --> 01:55:59,261
He's our channel's problem.

1429
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:01,771
l don't like the way news is
read in our channel.

1430
01:56:02,442 --> 01:56:05,434
But l'm not the news reader.
- But you write it, right?

1431
01:56:05,612 --> 01:56:08,775
They read as you write.
- What did l write?

1432
01:56:08,948 --> 01:56:11,439
Don't you know what did you write?

1433
01:56:11,618 --> 01:56:13,279
Shall we read the news?

1434
01:56:13,453 --> 01:56:16,115
Come!
- Let's go.- Come.

1435
01:56:26,132 --> 01:56:29,465
What is actual news and
how he presents it?

1436
01:56:29,636 --> 01:56:32,298
Watch, how he twists the news!

1437
01:56:32,972 --> 01:56:35,964
The news, a delegation went
to Delhi for discussion.

1438
01:56:37,477 --> 01:56:39,968
Though went to Rameshwaram,
the bad luck follows,

1439
01:56:40,146 --> 01:56:43,638
situation turned
against the committee.- Stop it!

1440
01:56:43,817 --> 01:56:46,308
Why are you using proverbs?
Just read the news.

1441
01:56:46,486 --> 01:56:47,976
Don't you watch BBC and CNN news?

1442
01:56:48,154 --> 01:56:52,488
Do they also quote proverbs like you?
Plain news...

1443
01:56:52,659 --> 01:56:53,648
Another news!

1444
01:56:55,495 --> 01:57:00,159
Actor Prakash Raj appealed High Court
for divorce from his wife.

1445
01:57:03,002 --> 01:57:05,334
Off late marriages of film stars
are ending up in divorces.

1446
01:57:05,505 --> 01:57:08,338
Nagarjuna, Pawan Kalyan
and now Prakash Raj!

1447
01:57:08,508 --> 01:57:11,170
Don't know why their lives
are going like this!

1448
01:57:11,344 --> 01:57:17,340
Actor Prakash Raj demands High Court
to give divorce urgently.

1449
01:57:17,517 --> 01:57:22,181
The news is about Prakash Raj,
why mention about Nagarjuna and Pawan?

1450
01:57:22,355 --> 01:57:24,687
Pawan is little mad!

1451
01:57:24,858 --> 01:57:28,350
lf he guns you down on the road,
you'll die!

1452
01:57:28,528 --> 01:57:31,190
Die on road!
Useless guy!

1453
01:57:32,031 --> 01:57:36,695
Would anyone demand High Court?
Useless man!

1454
01:57:37,537 --> 01:57:42,531
Read the next news...
please...- Next news!

1455
01:57:44,377 --> 01:57:46,368
Actress lleana said in
an audio release function,

1456
01:57:46,546 --> 01:57:49,379
that she owes her success to
following director's instructions.

1457
01:57:51,217 --> 01:57:55,051
Beautiful lleana says she's ready
to do anything for success!

1458
01:57:55,221 --> 01:58:05,893
This Goan beauty says openly she'll
go to any extent if director tells.

1459
01:58:06,065 --> 01:58:10,559
Just because you've a mouth,
will you blabber whatever nonsense?

1460
01:58:10,737 --> 01:58:12,728
What did the girl say and
what did you say about it?

1461
01:58:13,907 --> 01:58:15,898
Why should we be here
to tell as she says?

1462
01:58:16,075 --> 01:58:17,906
There's pep only if we add
something to it, right?

1463
01:58:18,077 --> 01:58:20,238
Would these fools watch
if we tell them plainly?

1464
01:58:20,413 --> 01:58:21,903
They'll change the channel.

1465
01:58:22,081 --> 01:58:24,242
Do you know how creative one
should be to present like this?

1466
01:58:24,417 --> 01:58:27,750
We use all our brain
to get the words right.

1467
01:58:27,921 --> 01:58:30,082
l've an in-built flow
in me to manage it.

1468
01:58:30,256 --> 01:58:32,087
lf not what would become
of this channel?

1469
01:58:41,768 --> 01:58:44,601
lt's time for main news,
shall we go now?

1470
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:48,430
All of you please go.

1471
01:58:48,775 --> 01:58:52,267
Politics is heating up in the state,
changes in political alignments.

1472
01:58:52,445 --> 01:58:54,606
Has Telugu agitation reached
the crescendo?

1473
01:58:55,114 --> 01:58:57,605
Can Jawahar Naidu's death
take Rana to the CM's seat?

1474
01:58:57,784 --> 01:59:00,617
How far Rana is from
the magical figure!

1475
01:59:00,787 --> 01:59:02,778
When would the countdown
to CM's seat begin?

1476
01:59:02,956 --> 01:59:04,287
No confidence motion
in Assembly,

1477
01:59:04,457 --> 01:59:06,618
making fast moves in
the political chess.

1478
01:59:06,793 --> 01:59:09,455
CM invites all MLA's to city,

1479
01:59:09,629 --> 01:59:11,961
exchange of power in the
name of get together.

1480
01:59:18,638 --> 01:59:20,469
Greetings sir

l'll give 3.
- l've spent 5, what can 3 do?

1486
01:59:33,987 --> 01:59:36,319
Elections are coming in 2 years,
we've to give again, right?

1487
01:59:36,489 --> 01:59:38,480
Don't say no, l'll send Murthy.

1488
01:59:41,327 --> 01:59:42,658
Where are you?
- What?

1489
01:59:42,829 --> 01:59:44,820
Vittal called on phone just now.
- What happened to him?

1490
02:00:03,683 --> 02:00:07,847
Brother...brother...
- What happened?

1491
02:00:08,187 --> 02:00:10,348
They killed him, brother!
- Killed? Who?

1492
02:00:10,523 --> 02:00:12,354
They killed Jawahar Naidu!

1493
02:00:12,692 --> 02:00:14,853
l captured it in video.

1494
02:00:15,361 --> 02:00:18,353
l'm a driver with Rana!

1495
02:00:39,052 --> 02:00:40,041
Brother!

1496
02:00:55,234 --> 02:00:57,725
This video is worth billions!

1497
02:00:59,405 --> 02:01:01,566
One can cheat anyone for it.

1498
02:01:07,413 --> 02:01:08,243
Hey you stop!

1499
02:01:36,275 --> 02:01:38,607
What's this tension now
when l'm set to become CM?

1500
02:01:38,778 --> 02:01:42,942
What if this is telecast?
Tension will increase manifold.

1501
02:01:43,950 --> 02:01:46,111
Anyway l killed my father
not your father, right?

1502
02:01:46,285 --> 02:01:48,276
What would l get if you
kill my father?

1503
02:01:48,454 --> 02:01:49,944
Tell me your price please.

1504
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:54,953
Rs.200 crores!
- Rs.200 crores?!

1505
02:01:55,128 --> 02:01:56,288
What would you do with it?

1506
02:01:56,462 --> 02:01:59,454
l'm a girl l do need
so much money to spend.

1507
02:01:59,632 --> 02:02:04,626
That's the price, we both are
seen clearly in the video,

1508
02:02:04,804 --> 02:02:06,795
she would need that much money!

1509
02:02:08,641 --> 02:02:10,131
Send her!

1510
02:02:10,309 --> 02:02:15,303
lt's like a 5 star hotel but
now it is new MLA quarters.

1511
02:02:15,481 --> 02:02:18,973
What is going inside isn't biryani
packets but bundles of currency notes.

1512
02:02:19,152 --> 02:02:24,818
Drinks flowing or bargaining is on,
only God knows what's happening there?

1513
02:02:24,991 --> 02:02:28,654
ln the political contest between
Chandrasekhar Reddy and Rana,

1514
02:02:28,828 --> 02:02:30,318
who will be the last man standing?

1515
02:02:30,496 --> 02:02:35,490
Bobby's exclusive after the break
on the political changes in the state.

1516
02:02:36,002 --> 02:02:39,836
The murder attempt on Rambabu has
created sensation all over the state.

1517
02:02:40,006 --> 02:02:43,498
There's information that Chief Minister
is going to inquire about his health.

1518
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:55,351
Greetings sir..
- Greetings!

1519
02:02:57,023 --> 02:02:59,685
Please don't get up, lie down!

1520
02:03:06,365 --> 02:03:11,530
l'm not here to ask who did it
or to inquire about your health.

1521
02:03:12,371 --> 02:03:14,362
l'm here for the respect
l've for you.

1522
02:03:15,374 --> 02:03:17,535
l'm a great fan of you, Rambabu.

1523
02:03:18,878 --> 02:03:23,212
Chief Minister's position
is most powerful,

1524
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:28,885
l too don't like to get down
from it in its attraction,

1525
02:03:29,055 --> 02:03:31,888
if he becomes CM, he too will
not give up easily.

1526
02:03:34,393 --> 02:03:39,558
The fight for this seat
is affecting the state.

1527
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:45,735
Whenever the CM is changed,
the state goes back by 10 years.

1528
02:03:46,072 --> 02:03:48,597
New leaders, new decisions,
new schemes.

1529
02:03:50,409 --> 02:03:53,742
They throw into dust bin midway
whatever the previous Govt. did.

1530
02:03:56,249 --> 02:04:01,619
l'll do everything to save my seat,
he'll do everything to get it.

1531
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:06,923
Change isn't in changing CM's.

1532
02:04:07,093 --> 02:04:08,754
People must change.

1533
02:04:10,263 --> 02:04:13,926
Youth must get the courage
to ask us holding our collar.

1534
02:04:16,102 --> 02:04:18,263
People won't believe me also!

1535
02:04:20,606 --> 02:04:22,096
They will believe you.

1536
02:04:23,442 --> 02:04:27,936
The only media entire state
trust is Rambabu!

1537
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:33,612
You react to small issues.

1538
02:04:35,454 --> 02:04:37,445
Today the state is in turmoil.

1539
02:04:41,127 --> 02:04:43,027
l want to see your reaction.

1540
02:05:32,678 --> 02:05:34,839
Rambabu is speaking, go live!

1541
02:05:35,848 --> 02:05:38,715
Channel is changed!
- lt's Rambabu!

1542
02:05:44,357 --> 02:05:46,689
lt's time for all channels
to come together,

1543
02:05:47,193 --> 02:05:51,357
stop any program running now,
today we need Rambabu!

1544
02:06:24,897 --> 02:06:28,890
The first thing we do reaching
home after a day's hard work,

1545
02:06:29,068 --> 02:06:30,399
to watch TV,

1546
02:06:31,904 --> 02:06:37,240
likewise people who don't have
any work also watch TV,

1547
02:06:38,411 --> 02:06:43,405
because we want to know news
of the world, we got to know it.

1548
02:06:44,917 --> 02:06:46,248
What do we do knowing it?

1549
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:49,752
We discuss in useless meeting
and give foolish advises.

1550
02:06:52,091 --> 02:06:53,422
Foolish advises!

1551
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:55,921
A man who can't earn a rupee

1552
02:06:56,095 --> 02:07:01,431
talks about what decisions Prime
Minister must take for economy growth.

1553
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:03,261
a man who never played cricket
in his life,

1554
02:07:03,436 --> 02:07:07,600
would suggest to Sachin ball how he
should play every ball of the over.

1555
02:07:08,607 --> 02:07:11,770
People in the evenings discuss about
which decision Unite nations must take,

1556
02:07:11,944 --> 02:07:14,936
and which countries
would benefit from it,

1557
02:07:15,114 --> 02:07:17,947
and say that is better for Peru
and this is good for Cuba.

1558
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:22,185
He'll brush away
Barrack Obama as nothing!

1559
02:07:23,289 --> 02:07:26,281
Useless gossip! Bloody gossip!

1560
02:07:28,627 --> 02:07:31,289
Like mother feeds us with
love and affection,

1561
02:07:31,464 --> 02:07:37,460
TV channels show us every injustice
happening around the world,

1562
02:07:37,636 --> 02:07:39,126
what do we do watching the news?

1563
02:07:39,805 --> 02:07:41,796
We'll abuse this nation
for sometime,

1564
02:07:41,974 --> 02:07:45,137
abuse leaders,
abuse the govt.,

1565
02:07:45,644 --> 02:07:50,980
we'll cry hoarsely that nobody
has social responsibility,

1566
02:07:52,318 --> 02:07:54,980
but one thing we must know,

1567
02:07:55,154 --> 02:07:59,488
more than social responsibility,
personal responsibility is important.

1568
02:08:00,659 --> 02:08:02,820
lf you're good,
the country would be good.

1569
02:08:04,497 --> 02:08:07,330
l'm not here to educate you
with my lecture.

1570
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,491
l don't have the patience
or interest.

1571
02:08:11,337 --> 02:08:13,168
But l'm here to speak to you!

1572
02:08:15,007 --> 02:08:20,001
l'm speaking to you!
Hey you!

1573
02:08:20,179 --> 02:08:22,841
Are you hearing me?

1574
02:08:23,015 --> 02:08:25,176
Do you know the extent of
damage happening to you?

1575
02:08:25,351 --> 02:08:30,345
lf 25 MLAs shift loyalty,
your fate changes, is it okay?

1576
02:08:31,357 --> 02:08:35,191
Rana Naidu, a criminal would
become CM, is it okay to you?

1577
02:08:36,028 --> 02:08:38,360
Hey you!

1578
02:08:38,531 --> 02:08:41,864
He'll collect the money spent
on buying MALs from you.

1579
02:08:42,034 --> 02:08:44,696
Petrol price will increase,
food prices will go up!

1580
02:08:44,870 --> 02:08:48,533
School fees, bus fares will go up!

1581
02:08:48,707 --> 02:08:52,700
lf gets the itch and becomes CM,
you'll end up as loser, is it okay?

1582
02:08:54,046 --> 02:08:57,709
Won't you solve your problem?

1583
02:08:57,883 --> 02:09:00,716
Don't you've time?

1584
02:09:00,886 --> 02:09:02,877
You stand in sun all the day
when your leader comes,

1585
02:09:03,055 --> 02:09:05,216
wait for hours if your loves calls,

1586
02:09:05,391 --> 02:09:09,054
you'll stand in queue at 5 am if
your favourite hero's film releases,

1587
02:09:09,228 --> 02:09:10,889
you'll watch your favourite
hero's film 20 times,

1588
02:09:11,063 --> 02:09:12,894
you've time for it,
but no time for this!

1589
02:09:13,065 --> 02:09:15,056
Right? No time for this!

1590
02:09:15,234 --> 02:09:17,566
Just leave one matinee show
and come here,

1591
02:09:17,736 --> 02:09:21,399
the job will be done.

1592
02:09:21,574 --> 02:09:23,235
Just leave one matinee show!

1593
02:09:25,911 --> 02:09:30,245
Do you want a hero?
Are you not yourself a hero?

1594
02:09:30,416 --> 02:09:33,078
Are you not yourself a hero?

1595
02:09:33,252 --> 02:09:38,417
You're the hero of your family, right?
What are you doing for your home?

1596
02:09:38,591 --> 02:09:43,585
Are you youth?

1597
02:09:43,762 --> 02:09:48,597
Sri Sri chided about you as
old, haggard and lazy!

1598
02:09:49,768 --> 02:09:52,760
Tilak cried God save my country!

1599
02:09:53,939 --> 02:09:56,669
Do you know this?

1600
02:09:57,776 --> 02:09:59,437
What can God do if you're like this!

1601
02:09:59,612 --> 02:10:01,102
l'm going to stop him,

1602
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:03,271
tomorrow you're coming
to Hyderabad!

1603
02:10:03,449 --> 02:10:05,110
Both of us are going together!

1604
02:10:05,284 --> 02:10:08,117
Are you coming or not?

1605
02:10:08,287 --> 02:10:11,620
There's nothing to lose in fighting
other than shackles of slavery.

1606
02:10:11,790 --> 02:10:13,951
Come...come!

1607
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:19,454
Rambabu is waiting for you
in Hyderabad! Come!

1608
02:10:19,798 --> 02:10:20,787
Come...come!

1609
02:11:15,521 --> 02:11:19,013
Will you live like a slave?
Don't you want live honourably?

1610
02:11:19,191 --> 02:11:24,686
Won't you change your fate?
Are you shameless?

1611
02:11:24,863 --> 02:11:28,196
You were born alone
and die alone...

1612
02:11:28,367 --> 02:11:33,703
Can't you fight as one?
Wake up from slumber and come...

1613
02:11:33,872 --> 02:11:37,205
Strangely your vote has been
twisted to act against you...

1614
02:11:37,376 --> 02:11:40,868
Won't you come to hold his
collar and seek justice?

1615
02:11:41,046 --> 02:11:43,708
Come as a deluge of
hot burning blood...

1616
02:11:43,882 --> 02:11:50,219
Come...join the swell of crowd...

1617
02:11:50,389 --> 02:11:54,052
The job will get done, come...

1618
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:28,423
Before the roof of your home
falls on you...

1619
02:12:28,594 --> 02:12:32,086
Before your heartbeat
disowns you...

1620
02:12:32,264 --> 02:12:37,759
Come on, get going...

1621
02:12:37,936 --> 02:12:41,428
Won't you take medicines
if you're not well...

1622
02:12:41,607 --> 02:12:44,940
Won't you care if nation
is not well...

1623
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:50,946
Come on, get going...

1624
02:12:51,116 --> 02:12:54,279
The first man was a lone man...
the first step is also lonely...

1625
02:12:54,453 --> 02:12:59,789
Come as the first man to take on
the life's first fight...

1626
02:12:59,958 --> 02:13:03,291
Come as clenched fist
and storming sea...

1627
02:13:03,462 --> 02:13:08,957
Agitate like high noon sun...

1628
02:13:09,134 --> 02:13:12,626
Life that doesn't fight
isn't a life at all...

1629
02:13:12,805 --> 02:13:16,138
Hoist the flag with your breath...

1630
02:13:16,308 --> 02:13:21,302
lmbibe in your every cell
the national anthem...

1631
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:25,814
Come as one...

1632
02:13:30,989 --> 02:13:34,823
Listen carefully, not an MLA
must go out from here.

1633
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:39,324
Last night when he said
you're a lone man,

1634
02:13:39,498 --> 02:13:40,829
l thought no one would turn up,

1635
02:13:40,999 --> 02:13:41,988
come out and see!

1636
02:14:34,052 --> 02:14:35,883
How many would people be here?

1637
02:14:36,054 --> 02:14:42,721
l can fathom a sea but
can't judge how man are here!

1638
02:14:54,573 --> 02:14:56,632
Such a massive crowd came
for his call!

1639
02:15:13,258 --> 02:15:15,749
lts people everywhere l see!

1640
02:15:15,928 --> 02:15:18,089
Don't know how many more
are there l don't see!

1641
02:15:21,266 --> 02:15:26,932
Are they people of our state or
came from neighbouring state also?

1642
02:15:34,947 --> 02:15:37,279
Sir, l'm going crazy watching
the crowd here.

1643
02:15:37,449 --> 02:15:39,781
lf they do anything, don't know
what decision l must take.

1644
02:15:57,636 --> 02:15:59,297
Not a man is moving or speaking!

1645
02:15:59,471 --> 02:16:01,632
The silence is making me
wet my pants!

1646
02:16:12,818 --> 02:16:17,653
lf so many turn for his call,
what if l call?

1647
02:16:18,824 --> 02:16:21,054
There are no people there
to come if you call.

1648
02:16:21,326 --> 02:16:24,159
Give up, try to understand me.

1649
02:16:35,674 --> 02:16:38,507
What's his problem?
What does he want?

1650
02:16:43,682 --> 02:16:45,843
What do you want, Rambabu?
what are your demands?

1651
02:16:46,018 --> 02:16:47,349
What are you planning to do?

1652
02:16:50,355 --> 02:16:51,845
l'm asking you,
please say something.

1653
02:17:03,535 --> 02:17:05,526
Come...come...what does he want?

1654
02:17:05,704 --> 02:17:07,865
Rambabu gave you 5 minutes time,

1655
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:09,871
not an MLA must be in
this building!

1656
02:17:10,042 --> 02:17:11,703
He has asked them to go home.

1657
02:17:11,877 --> 02:17:13,367
lt's better to leave silently.

1658
02:17:13,545 --> 02:17:16,105
What would he do if l refuse?

1659
02:17:43,408 --> 02:17:45,239
Call military!

1660
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:47,901
Before they come and raise bonnets,
everything would be over.

1661
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:49,570
Not a piece of you would be left.

1662
02:18:00,759 --> 02:18:04,251
What would he do?

1663
02:18:49,808 --> 02:18:51,639
Don't run away!

1664
02:19:21,006 --> 02:19:23,668
Telecast the video of
Jawahar Naidu's murder.

1665
02:19:34,853 --> 02:19:39,187
Will you take Rs.200 crores
and telecast the video?

1666
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:44,693
Rana Naidu caught red handed!

1667
02:19:44,863 --> 02:19:53,202
The video of Rana killing his
father has created sensation!

1668
02:20:24,569 --> 02:20:26,901
What's this? What do you want?

1669
02:20:27,072 --> 02:20:30,235
What will you get from it?
What do you want?

1670
02:20:31,743 --> 02:20:37,579
This state is ours!

1671
02:20:54,933 --> 02:20:57,424
You did what you shouldn't do now!

1672
02:21:48,653 --> 02:21:50,644
ls there politics behind your anger?

1673
02:21:50,822 --> 02:21:51,982
Are you entering politics?

1674
02:21:52,157 --> 02:21:54,990
What's the reason for the journey
from nobody to everybody?

1675
02:22:03,835 --> 02:22:08,397
My mother...
some man cheated my mother.

1676
02:22:09,674 --> 02:22:14,008
She cried seeking justice.
Nobody cared!

1677
02:22:14,846 --> 02:22:16,177
She became mad!

1678
02:22:17,849 --> 02:22:21,341
My mother was 6 month pregnant with me
when she was sent to mental hospital,

1679
02:22:22,854 --> 02:22:24,685
l was born to that mad mother,

1680

my mother doesn't know
about my birth,

1681
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:36,193
l don't know who named me
or where l grew up,

1682
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:41,703
nobody cared our cries,

1683
02:22:43,541 --> 02:22:47,033
my mother is still in
mental hospital,

1684
02:22:49,381 --> 02:22:51,440
she's still crying forjustice,

1685
02:22:55,387 --> 02:22:58,220
l don't mind if this state
ignores my family,

1686
02:22:59,057 --> 02:23:01,218
but l do care about this state!
