1
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,026
"Jolly days."

2
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,787
"Jolly days."

3
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:53,559
"Jolly days."

4
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,932
"Jolly days."

5
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:02,532
"Jolly days."

6
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,751
Santu! Santu!

7
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:25,286
Every minute and second
is important in life.

8
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,229
We must always try to
make the most of each day.

9
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,632
We must always be optimistic.

10
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,838
Have a goal in life.

11
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,339
You must plan out things.

12
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,035
And implement those plans.

13
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,634
AUnderstand? Wake up!

14
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,442
'L-low would I Know principles
for life, father?'

15
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,079
'You are wasting your time
asking me about it.'

16
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,749
'Why am I tensed today?'

17
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,549
'I don't understand anything.'

18
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,120
'ls it fear or excitement?'

19
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,920
'Never did I wake up before 8.'

20
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,517
And why today?'

21
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:59,189
'Even she has already
started her day.'

22
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,423
'Doesn't she sleep?'

23
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,833
She's preparing sweet for sure.'

24
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,634
'She'd prepared the same sweet
when I received my CET results

25
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,863
'And the same sweet even today.'

26
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,769
Santu, will you come with me
to the temple? - No, mother.

27
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,179
'Even this monkey
has already got up.'

28
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,586
'And father too.'

29
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,857
Santu! - Oh!

30
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,027
Santu, it is 'Parker' pen.

31
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:39,798
My father gave this to me on my
first day of engineering college.

32
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,470
Take this. Now it yours.

33
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,343
All the best.

34
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,515
'Old sentiments.'

35
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,669
'Today is Monday and
it's going to be..

36
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,405
...an eventful day for the Gemini.'

37
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,674
'There will be plenty of
problems in your busy life.'

38
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,046
'But different people have
various problems.'

39
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,982
'Problems..' - Are you tensed?

40
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,917
Everybody go through the same feeling
on the first day of college.

41
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,249
Don't get tensed.

42
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:33,588
If you have any problems,
go the principal immediately.

43
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,092
He will handle them.

44
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,923
Give her his phone number.

45
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,157
Do not fear to say that you sing well
if anybody questions you.

46
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,998
You must sing well. Understand?

47
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,799
'Hello. Why don't you talk?'

48
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,635
'Madam, I am suffering alopecia.'

49
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,075
It will be cured if you apply
coconut oil everyday.

50
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,443
BY the by, Why did you
people come along?

51
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,375
Poor girl.. - It is like we are
going on the mission.

52
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,884
Damn it.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,993
Why did you tell the principal
that I am good at singing?

54
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,723
Turn off the radio.

55
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:19,694
Father, until now 147 cars
went passed this road.

56
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,667
And all of them were
single driver cars.

57
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,307
300 liters of petrol per hour.

58
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:29,440
Father, assume these people
traveled by bus or train..

59
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,611
...1O cores of petrol per year.
What do you say, father?

60
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,647
So, I guess you'll be going
by bus from tomorrow?

61
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,188
It's about me, but generally.

62
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,619
Father, take a right turn.

63
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,591
I guess it's straight. Ask someone.

64
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,726
Excuse me.

65
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,069

Stop! Stop!

69
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,710
Oh..
- I am really very sorry.

70
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,220
What was the hurry?

71
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,414
You could've taken the next bus.

72
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,082
I will late to the college.
- I am sorry.

73
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,719

80
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,665

Dear, why have you
dressed like a boy?

95
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,159
Look at your son;
he has long hair unlike girls.

96
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,931
Very good. You said it right.

97
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,696
This is how girls should be.

98
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,742
Whafs there in the dress,
one must intelligent.

99
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,603

We've paid so much money

How much did you pay
for the admission?

104
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,923
Mother, keep quiet.

105
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,055

Apoorva. Appu.

You seem to be inspired
with Dhoni's hairstyle.

108
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,222
Is it suiting me?

109
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,423
L've been growing it for
the last 8 months.

110
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,557
...just to make a mark
in the college.

111
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,827

Okay, bye. Take care.

117
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,584
God, I've taken up mechanical
thinking it is easy.

118
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,182
Though I knew there are very
few girls, I still took a risk.

119
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:31,019
So please, bless me so
that I have total entertainment.

120
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:38,560
Give me a girl who speaks
English so that life's fun.

00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,364
Don't cry. You will be all right.

00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,653

Welcome, students.

Every year we celebrate this clay

Excuse me. - The reason why we

00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:22,605
Every year in the college, who..

...what he achived, for an

00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,843
It is just a beginning..
- Excuse me. Hi.

147
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,481
Hi. - ..long journey.

148

My dear friends..
- Santosh Kumar.

149
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,050
Santu.
- Today the world looks up to us.

Ankita. - ..to attain knowledge.
The information and technology..

Mechanical?

152
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,734
Yes. - ..engineers that India
has been able to produced.

153
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,439
Having said that, I don't
really mean to say that.

154
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,965
You know, the first year.

155
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,638
It's not that you all
have to take part.

156
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,181
...in the development of India
from the very first year itself.

157
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,752
Why are you so tensed?

158
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,022
Because. I have to sing.

159
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,920
On the stage.

160
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,392
After this speech.

161
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,059
Oh!

162
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,303
Actually, there's no program
after this speech.

163
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,043
They will be taking us
around the campus.

164
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,638
Are you sure?
- Yes.

165
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,213
One of the lecturers told.

166
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,275
Because they are running
short of time.

167
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,676
Dear. - I?

168
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,646
No. He.

Come here. - I?
- Yes.

171
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,856
Just a minute. I will be there.
- All right.

00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,892
Now I invite Ms. Ankita,
1st year student. Mechanical.

173
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,161
You told me this was
the last program?

174
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,499
Okay. All the best.

175
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,607
Hello.

177
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,645
He's my son Panduranga Ra.

178
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,647
You must be Santosh Kumar?
- Yes.

179
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,820
He was supposed to be sitting
besides me in the auditorium.

180
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,820
He is not like the other students.

181
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,222
This is first time
he's going to a college.

182
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,825
He's also nervous too.

183
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,327
If I am not with him, he will
not be attending college too.

184
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,853
He did his previous
education exams privately.

185
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,827
He's being stubborn that
he will not go to the college.

186
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,602
Take him inside.
I will wait right here.

187
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,027
Come on.
- Go.

188
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,414
It is really important to know
our college campus well.

189
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,386
Look, that was the first
principals residence.

190
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,648
He was a great man.

191
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:01,352
It is believed that he will
be seen in the form of lion..

192
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:05,727
...to one of the new students
in this college.

193
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,990
And eventually, that student
turns out to be achiever.

194
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,558
And anybody could be that.

195
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,647
You sing really well. Wonderful.
- Thanks.

196
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,316
Tell me your names.
- Niranjan, sir.

197
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,648
Pandu, sir.

198
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,778
Santosh, sir.

199
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,720
Ankita, sir.

200
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,583
Everybody, salute.

201
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,092
Ankita, come here.

202
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,730
Sit down.

203
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,492
This is not the way to salute.

204
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,170
Bring your bags down.

205
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,607
Join your hands. Start jumping.

206
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,975
We are AAIT students!

207
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,507
We are AAIT students!

208
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,121
We are AAIT students!

209
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,554
Stop laughing.
- Sorry, sir.

210
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,063
You come dressed like a boy
to the college. - ..seniors..

211
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,525
Write an imposition.

212
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,469
...saying you'll not come to the
college dressed like a boy.

213
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,070
You are going to wear silk sari
from tomorrow. Understand?

214
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:30,444
Not you. You. Come here.

215
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,480
You both continue jumping.
- Whats the matter with you?

216
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,645
I only see your lips moving,
but I can't hear you.

217
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:35,846
Do you need a voice dubbing?

218
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,048
Whafs your name?
-l\/Iante Linga Swamy, sir.

219
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,548
I can't speak English.
- You are lying.

220
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,958
I am not lying, sir.

221
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,360
Where are you from?

222
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,297
Near Bantahalli. Kollegal.
Chamrajnagar district.

223
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,262
Are you from Kannada medium?
- Yes, sir.

224
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,665
Write down the lyrics of
Michael Jackson's songs

225
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,306
Can you tell me the
names of those songs?

226
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,634
What happened?
- Tell me the names, sir.

227
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,346
You may leave.
- Come with me.

228
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,018
Tell me the names
of those songs, sir.

229
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,316
He's Michael Jackson.
Why do you fear so much?

230
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,580
Even I am from Kollegal.

231
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,916
I couldn't speak English
like you before.

232
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,057
Since you joined college
you will surely learn.

233
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,456
You can tell me if you
have any problem.

234
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,526
I will handle it.

235
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,159
Come on, smile.

236
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,301
Damn it. Loudly.

237
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:30,464
Sir, actually, I've rashes all
around my waist.

238
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:35,443
I will not be able to wear sari
and expose my waist.

239
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,812
All right, calm down. Why cry for it.

240
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,778
This proves that our tradition
and culture has become useless.

241
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,979
You may go to your class.
Let's go to the class.

242
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,615
Carry our bags.

243
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,820
How dare you stare at us?
- Wait a minute.

244
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,163
My father is M.L.A
(member of legislative assembly)

245
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,295
Oh my God!

246
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,062
So you are an M.L.S's son?

247
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,640
This is how we treat our junior
though he's chief mihister's son.

248
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:05,972
Come on, guys.

249
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,883
You fatso!

250
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,112
Why are you harassing me like this?

251
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:26,922
The only word that I hate is 'fatso'.
- I am sorry, sir.

252
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,964
I am sorry, sir.

253
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,217
I lost my hair.

254
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,315
Is it funny to you?

255
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,857
How do I look?

256
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,021
I must be looking ugly.

257
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,430
Calm down. - I will kill that fatso.

258
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,661
It's okay. You look handsome.

259
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,803
I look handsome?
- Yes.

260
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,974
Tell me the truth.
-Yes.

261
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,103
Look at him.
- Damn it.

262
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,305
Tell me the truth. -
Don't expect girls to admire you.

263
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,017
You look like a hairless chicken.

264
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,586
So what? I will get
a proper haircut.

265
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:28,388
As you wish. - But I will
not spare that fatso.

266
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,653
If I don't teach him, I don't deserve
to be called as M.L.A's son.

267
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,722
You. Come here.

268
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,230
You look like a dirty pig?

269
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,101
Go and clean yourself.

270
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,737
Who are you to say that?

271
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,300
I will give you a hard kick.
lam your senior.

272
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,638
Get going.
- I am sorry, sir.

273
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,806
I will thrash you.

274
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,782
Why did wear this modern dress
when you'd to sing a spiritual song?

275
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,580
Wear skirt and blouse.

276
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,215
Okay, sir.

277
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,718
Wear skirt and blouse from tomorrow.

278
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:04,493
Actually, I don't have one.
I will try.. - Ankita, do as I say.

279
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,287
I am your senior.
- Okay, sir.

280
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,800
Do you know anyone from the group?

281
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,563
I mean friends?

282
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,237
Friends?

283
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,303

00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:26,181
Okay.

00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,943
Go to your class.

Radhu. - Yes?
- Lecturers.

289
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:36,626
Can I know your good name?
- What did you ask? Come again.

290
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,287
I was asking her name.

291
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,727
Why do you want to know my
girlfriends name?

292
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,291
She looks very interesting.

293
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,026
Funny. - What? Interesting?

294
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,936
You rascal, remove your shirt.

295
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,664
How dare you?

296
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,432
Why do you want to know her name?

297
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,974
You have good physique.
You look like Mike Tyson.

298
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,240
I will kill you, rascal.

299
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,152
How dare you stare at me?

300
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,147
Go running round the campus.

301
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,355
Guys, the lecturers are coming.
Wear your shirt soon.

302
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,051
Everybody, leave.

303
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,656
'Though we'd a clash with the seniors,
we freshers..

304
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,287
...become close to each other
at our very first meeting.'

305
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,858
'Praveen. Vishvvas. Appu.
Pandu. Ankita. Niranjan.'

306
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,294
'I mean Tyson.'

307
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,265
'Everybody was happy
that we are friends now.'

308
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,007
Why are you looking so dirty?

309
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,236
He told them that
he was M.L.A's son.

310
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,376
Everybody is not as
intelligent as you.

311
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,772
When they asked you to wear
a sari you saved yourself..

312
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,146
...by giving an excuse you've
rashes around your waist.

313
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,280
I will not spare that fatso.

314
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,785
I will teach him.

315
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,578
Stop.

316
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,446
Everybody listen to me carefully.

317
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,626
We need 1O copies of Metallurgy
assignment within 2 hours.

318
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,423
And you guys will do it for us.

319
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,894
You get that? Go on.

320
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,094
Sir, we have a lecture to attend.

321
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,563
We too have a lecture.
You better do it.

322
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,027
Within 2 hours.

323
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,560
You will complete within 2 hours.

324
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,936

It would be better for
us attend the lecture.

326
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,537
You are right. I shall leave.

327
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,174
L've to change my subject.

328
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,912
I am very much interested
in computer science.

329
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,543
I want to top.

330
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,955
All right.
-Thanks. - Bye.

331
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,882
Are you not writing?
- I got it.

332
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,917
I've understood it. Nothing to worry.

333
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,396
You are great.

334
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,262
You were trying to impress
one of the senior girls.

335
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,925
Enjoy yourself.

336
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,966
Here you go.

337
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,771
You finished it so fast?

338
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:37,278
He does the work which
he is very interested in.

339
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,439
If he didn't like the work,
he will never bother about it.

340
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,784
Mother. - Take it.

341
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,249
You must bring him to
college from tomorrow.

342
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,091
I will not be able to come everyday.

343
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,191
Where do you live?
- Kamalanagar.

344
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,635
All right, I will pick him up.
- Thanks, son.

345
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,134
Did you guys finish? - Give it.

346
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,409
Give it.

347
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,880
'So the first day of
college was over.'

348
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:14,609
'There were some problems
but there was fun too.'

349
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,821
Mother!

Do you take us to be fools?

361
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,164
Sorry. I don't like..

362
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:16,875

00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,630
You want to have a college
radio, isn't it?- Forget it, Santu.

424
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:02,432
Don't get scared. I am with you.
- Forget it. Please.

425
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:03,929
Come on.

426
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,299
Let me go. - Wait.

427
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:06,964
Excuse me.

428
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,036
We have. I mean, she has an idea.

Lefs throw paper rockets on her.

431
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,252
I think. we should have
college radio.

00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:25,314
What is need of it?
- Giri, sit quietly.

433

Sorry, my friend.

Actually. I think it will be cool.

435
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,597
Cool! What are you saying?

436
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,628
Just listen to me for a second.

437
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,259
Lefs listen to her.

438
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,739
We can have a college radio
instead of a notice board.

439
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,263
College radio?
- Yes.

440
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:47,971
If we have one, we will
get to hear good music.

441
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:54,143
We can have debates.

443
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:03,252
How it is possible to have
a radio in our college?

444
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:04,852
I don't understand this.

445
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,025
Get up.

446
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,032

Okay, Ankita, all the best. - Okay.

00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,309
It will be economical.

450
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,278
Please, give me a chance.

451
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,510
Hi. - Hi.

452
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,811
Whom are you waiting for?

453
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:33,949
Waiting for Seema?
- No. I was waiting for you.

454
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,758
What about the idea?

455
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,995
They did like it, but
maybe next year.

456
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,333
They are planning to construct
hospital in the neighborhood village.

457
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,895
Oh. Better luck next time.

458
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,301
You at least tried. - Yes.

459
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:50,667
That's all right.
But Raghu is after my life.

460
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,303
Then why don't you wear skirt
and blouse? You can get rid of him.

461
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,954
Hi, Ankita. You look beautiful.

462
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,522
Thanks for wearing.

463
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,397
As you'd ordered to wear it.

464
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,130
Will you come with me
in my car? Please.

465
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,832
Come in my car. Please, Ankita.
- No

466
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,219
Are you freshers?
- Yes, sir

467
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:39,848
Get up.

468
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,819
Ankita, sit down.
- No, thanks.

469
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,531
Sit down, Ankita. - No.

470
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,030
You come and sit

471
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,338
Thanks again, Ankita, for wearing.

472
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,807
Though I am a senior you
shouldn't have worn it for me.

473
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,279
Not just you, but I'd other seniors
also who'd ordered.

474
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,373
So I'd to wear. - Oh.

475
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,619
Why are you so tensed?

476
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,948
I feel so uncomfortable
wearing skirt and blouse.

477
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,384
I am not able to
tolerate his harassment.

478
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,485
He is after my life.

479
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,326
He always follows me.

480
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,526
Shall I drop you home?

481
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:28,029
No. If Raghu see us,
he will feel very jealous.

482
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:35,036
Ankita, you look very beautiful.

483
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,352
How dare you say that to her?

484
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,455
Get down from the bike.

485
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,885
Come along.

486
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,991
You will write thousand times
saying 'Ankita is my sister'.

487
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:00,761
After that you may go to your class.

488
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,601
What? I can't do that.

489
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,539
You better do it, you rascal.

490
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:08,443
If I find you with Ankita again,
I will thrash you.

491
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,577
I am serious about her and
lam not joking.

492
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:13,083
She's mine.

493
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,607
Understand?

494
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,415
And you better do what I said.

495
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:29,796
Ankita can't be my sister.
Actually, she maybe yours.

496
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,812
Santu, take it.

497
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,675
Thousand times. Thanks, Pandu.

498
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,581
Sir, take it.

499
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,650
Thousand times?

500
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:54,852
Get lost. This guy is crazy.

501
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:08,896
'Since Ankita was looking so pretty,
I felt like being with her.'

502
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,271
'Talking to her.'

503
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:13,470
'Maybe even touch her.'

504
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,274
'I was going through
different kind of feelings.'

505
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:20,080

Everybody should
carry their own drafters.

508
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:44,872
And everyone should bring
their own text books. - Okay, sir.

509
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,802
Ankita! Ankita, I am going
to buy the drafter.

510
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,710
...vvould you like to come along?

511
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:53,040
Thank you very much.
I was just thinking about it.

512
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,316
All right. So when are we going?

513
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,378
Right away, otherwise
Raghu catch hold of us.

514
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,718
You are right.

515
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,315
It's raining.

516

That's all right. l_et's go.
- Santu. - Come on.

517
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:14,529
'She's second girl who'll be sitting
on my bike other than my sister.'

518
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:17,733
'And it is going to be Ankita.'

519
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,905
'And especially when
she is looking so beautiful.'

520
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,774
'And in rain.'

521
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,009
'I think this is life.'

522
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,764
"lt's like the star.

523
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,959
...climbing down the sky."

524

"I feel like.

525
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,634
...it's coming just for me"

526
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,604
"A feeling of love..

527
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:01,914
...developed in me."

528
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,552
"Seeing your beauty.

529
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:09,320
...I am mesmerized."

530
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:12,818
"I don't understand this magic."

531
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:16,458
"Do you feel the same?"

532
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,037
Please, come and have coffee.

533
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,412
My mother is an expert
in preparing coffee.

534
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,814
Mother!

535
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,248
He's my classmate, Santu.

536
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,117
Hello, aunt. - Hello.

537
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:41,223
'I was very much impressed with
her mother, grandmother.

538
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:46,018
'Her house and over
all her entire family.'

539
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:51,262
'I get a feeling that she's
getting closer to my heart.'

540
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,235
<i>Okay, bye. - BYE-</i>

541
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,971
Brother, come and join me.

542
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:02,105
'Seeing my mental state I
think I am in love with her.'

543
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:08,477
'Though I'm home, my mind is still
wandering in Ankita's house.'

544
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:13,656
Hi. - Hi. What are you doing?

545
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,922
L've to buy eggs and
semolina for mother.

546
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,054
And take Snowfy for a walk.

547
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,324
Walk?

548
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,631
Can I join you? -
You just return home?

549
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:27,570
But still.. I want to walk
with you. - Okay.

550
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,328
The weather is beautiful.

551
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,599
Your dress too.

552
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,439
Nice dog.

553
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:38,846
Come on. - Actually, I was
getting bored at home.

554
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,478
But we'd a good time.
- Yes.

555
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,285
Thank God, we got
rid of that idiot today.

556
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,286
By the by, why is so
crazy about you?

557
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:50,588
I think he's obsessed.

558
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,927
He wants me wear skirt and blouse.

559
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,959
Maybe he's mad.

560
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,729
He annoyed me by constantly
staring at my dress.

561
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,868
Maybe you are really cute.

562
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,334
Uncle. - Yes? - Give me one dozen
of eggs and 1 kilo of semolina.

563
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,577
Am I that beautiful?
- Should I say you the trust?

564
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,547
You look wonderful.

565
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,950
Trust me. - Thanks.

566
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,349
'The stupid talks.'

567
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,251
'Unnecessary visits.'

568
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,282
'This is my first experience.'

569
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:26,091
'Maybe it's not really
that stupid.' - Damn it.

570
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:28,663
'I don't know.'

571
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,973
'I heard the lecturers in the..

572
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,736
...engineering colleges are
really very strict.'

573
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,670
'But never guessed they
would so strict.'

574
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,040
Hey, you! Get out!

575
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,142
Sorry, sir. - Out!

576
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,944
Sir, that's my phone.
- You also get out.

577
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:56,923
'He gets annoyed even if he
hears the pencil noise.' - Get out!

578
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,320
'Or he finds someone laughing.
' - Out!

579
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,631
'And he finds anybody eating gum,
he'd ask them to leave for sure.'

580
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,724
Out! - And if he hears
anybody yawning.

581
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,534
Out! Out!

582
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:12,303
If this lecturer sends the
students out then who'll teach?

583
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,641
What were you both talking?
- Who are you talking about?

584
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,308
You and Ankita?

585
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,681
Just a casual talk.
About books, college, etc.

586
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,648
What were you both
talking about me?

587
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,383
We vveren't talking about you.

588
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:27,952
On the street?

589
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,217
We were talking about dogs.

590
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,725
Is it only about dogs?
- Yes.

591
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,396
On the street?

592
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,696
Yesterday.

593
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:42,604
We were talking about
one of the lecturers.

594
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:47,203
Was it about the maths
lecturer? About dogs?

595
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,143
About dogs? No.

596
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,711
Are you sure?
- Very much.

597
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,715
'I will never cheat seniors.'

598
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,147
'I will never cheat seniors.'

599
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,252
Write properly.

600
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,655
Lecturer!

601
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:48,003
Shut your mouth.

602
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,771
You crazy.

603
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,280
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

604
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,186
Let me clarify something
to you before I proceed.

605
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:16,058
I Know how seriously engineering
students take their English classes.

606
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:18,898
I know why exactly
why you are all here today.

607
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,603
L've no problem in
entertaining you students.

608
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,738
Let me tell you something.

609
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:28,777
90% of all competitive exams
are based on English.

610
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,447
It maybe 'CAT'. 'GRE

611
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,549
'G MAT' NAT.'

612
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:54,398
'Like it is said in movies,
we were all at the door of heaven.'

613
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,662
'And then the bell rang.'

614
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:04,174
'We went behind her
as though we were hypnotized.'

615
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:40,412
'Vishvvas entered
civil engineering class.'

616
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,145
'And electronics too.'

617
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:48,924
'Though the lecture was over
he still followed her.'

618
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:04,805
"Lenience."

619
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:06,676
"Lenience."

620
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:10,410
"Friendship is lenience."

621
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,873
"Friendship last."

622
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,613
"..till the end of time."

623
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,785
"There's silence in the heart."

624
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:25,156
"It keeps singing the songs of love."

625
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,929
"There are flowers showering on us."

626
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,624
"We lost in the thoughts of love."

627
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,738
"You are always on my mind."

628
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:40,172
"My heart awaits you."

629
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,746
"This is first time..

630
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,749
...we are going through such a feeling."

631
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:51,182
"You are always on my mind."

632
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:54,785
"My heart awaits you."

633
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:58,725
"This is first time..

634
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,022
...we are going through
such a feeling."

635
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:12,197
"There was no indicating from her."

636
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:16,104
"But we were still getting
closer to each other."

637
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:19,683
"lam sure this is love."

638
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,342
"The life started changing."

639
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,921
"Living life by
counting every minute."

640
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,818
"Wondering like refugees."

641
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:37,025
"I don't Know how to express
this feeling of mine."

642
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:42,298
"You are always on my mind."

643
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:46,175
"My heart awaits you."

644
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:49,503
"This is first time..

645
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:53,275

"This is first time..

649
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:07,892
...we are going through
such a feeling."

650
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,399
"At times I question my self."

651
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,433
"Saying this really love."

652
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:56,435
"I even find her even
in the stone idol."

653
00:43:56,868 --> 00:44:03,615
"I feel secured
as I walk down with her."

654
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:11,084
"I don't think I would come across
this kind feeling ever."

655
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,219
"Lenience."

Madam, please.

00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:21,793
I love you, madam.

675
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,729
Madam, my name is Vishvvas.

676
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:25,062
My father is M.L.A
in Nagamangala, madam.

677
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,931
My father is quite rich, madam.

678
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,766
I have a mother, brother and a sister.

679
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,033
Madam, my future lies in you. -Then?

680
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:33,534
Madam, you need not tell me anything.

681
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,200
But I love you very much, madam.

682
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,747
Vishvvas, come to my office.
-Yes.

683
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,945
Vishwas, get me that box.

684
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,922
All these are love letters. Take them.

685
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,064
Read all the letters.

686
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:59,025
Do you have anything else to say?

687
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,931
If not, you may leave.

688
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,403
Madam. - Take it.
- Okay, madam.

689
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:07,203
'When we were already
tensed about Vishwas.

690
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:09,744
...there came a twist in Tyson's life.'
- Excuse me.

691
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,479
Are you going to the canteen?
Can I join you?

692
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,983
Can I know your good name?

693
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:28,229
It will be better for you
if you go away from here.

694
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,895
This is very special flower.
It will not dry even for one week.

695
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,235
Are you mad?

696
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,800
Why are you putting
yourself into trouble?

697
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,706
In our college history
none of the freshers..

698
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:43,039
...dared to come to the canteen.
-Don't worry about me.

699
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,442
I will take care of myself.

700
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,879
Please, take this flower and
tell me your name.

701
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:49,746
I am coming to the canteen
to have lunch. Please.

702
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,345
Please.

703
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:56,020
Shravanti.
- I know you are quite famous.

704
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,251
'It is risky to enter the lion's den.'

705
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,293
'But he not only entered the den
but messed with the lion.'

706
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:07,031
Hey, come here.

707
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:16,572
Who gave this flower? - It was me.

708
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:20,174
I will hang you to the fan and kill you.
- Sir, let him go.

709
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,012
How dare you? She's my love.
- Please, sir.

710
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,211
You get going. - You..
-Rahul, let him go.

711
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,685
He's crazy guy.
- You keep quiet.

712
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:28,257
How dare you mess with our girl?
- Please, sir

713
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:32,191
I found her to be interesting.
So I gave her the flower.

714
00:47:32,484 --> 00:47:34,293
What? Interesting?
- Please, Rahul.

715
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:35,957
Stop laughing-

716
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:37,623
Rahul, let him go.
-You stay away.

717
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:40,737
Is your father a minister?
- No, sir.

718
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,065
When will you get us beaten
up by the bullies?

719
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,674
In four years. Maximum four years.

720
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:48,004
I will do it. - What will you do?

721
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:49,736
I will start a company.

722
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:54,548
I might employ some of
you in my company.

723
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:59,514
I might just hire you guys.
I feel so, sir.

724
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:03,020
You guys are so funny sometimes.
- You rascal.

725
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,752
Please, sir.
- Take him away.

726
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,427
Hit him! - Let him go!

727
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,597
Rahul, let him go.
- Rahul, are you out of your mind?

728
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,324
Why are you behaving like this?
-Get going.

729
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:11,992
Rahul, move back.

730
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,464
What is your problem?

731
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:18,500
You must bow down to seniors.
Understand'? - Move back.

732
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:21,309
Don't create unnecessary
problems in the college.

733
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,273
Listen to me.
- Everybody, move.

734
00:48:23,435 --> 00:48:27,906
If I find you in the canteen again,
I will break your legs.

735
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,644
Santu, make him understand.

736
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,685
Move back. Get going.

737
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,347
Get going. - Get going.

738
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,290
'I was always wondering.

739
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,522
...why Tyson is wasting
his time on Shravanti.'

740
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,860
'I was even feeling pity too.'

741
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:49,698
'But today I realize,
not just ShravantL.

742
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:52,272
...he can get anything he wants.'

743
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,033
Santu! - Whats the matter, Ankita?

744
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,476
That scoundrel is coming.
- Where?

745
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:59,671
Santu, bye. - Okay. Bye.

746
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:00,805
Bye, Ankita - Bye.

747
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,283
He's forcing me that
he'd drop me home in the evening.

748
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:04,512
Ankita!

749
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,020
I will lie to him saying
we have an urgent work to do.

750
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,414
I will lie something. Damn it.

751
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:12,490
He's holding my hand
saying he will read my palm.

752
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,728
Here he comes.
- Ankita, shall we leave?

753
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,764
L've an assignment to do.

754
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:23,100
Actually, Santu and l..
- Assignment?

755
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:26,505
Do the assignment for her.
You better do it.

756
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:28,904
Get going now. Lefs go, Ankita.

757
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:32,415
'I will not forget the way
Ankita looked at me.'

758
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,516
'I thought I'd committed
a grave mistake in life.'

759
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,186
'I couldn't sleep the entire night.'

760
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:53,730
This side 8O degree
and this side 130 degree.

761
00:49:53,892 --> 00:49:55,633
130 degree?
- Hi, Tyson.

762
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,729
Hey Vishwas.. - Total si>< diagrams.
I've clone all of them.

763
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:00,275
You don't worry. Okay?
- Thank you very much, Praveen.

764
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:02,106
I really mean it.
- lt's okay.

765
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,077
You needn't thank me.
You said we are friends?

766
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,410
Okay, I'll give a treat.
- Yes, this is good.

767
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,482
You give me excuses when we need
a favor whereas for Kirti..

768
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,151
Relax.
- Appu.

769
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:15,951
Did you complete the drawing for me?

770
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:19,358
You told me you drew half the
diagram but I found nothing.

771
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,929
Take it.
- Thank you.

772
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:25,267
I just drew half the diagram.
I don't carry any sentiments.

773
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,460
Oh God.

774
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:29,864
Hi, Ankita.

775
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:34,869
Hello.

776
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,174
What?
- Your drawing is very good.

777
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,373
Get away.

778
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,217
Ankita.

779
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,124
Vishvvas. - Thank you.

780
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,390

Whafs the occasion?

784
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:05,970
Oh!

785
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,339
So, you are Pisces?

786
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:13,271
Everyone must come.

787
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:14,777
Pandu.

00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,377

00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,871
Go and talk to her.

795
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,945
Hey, I am sorry.

796
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:44,745
I am really sorry.

797
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:47,710
I was just worried about the
fight between us and the seniors.

798
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,215
Get away.
- I told you I am sorry.

799
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:53,417
Ankita! - Idiot.

800
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,115
Oh God.
- Damn it.

801
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,667
Hi, Ankita.
- What?

802
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,830
You may leave.

803
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,564
Ankita.
- Yes?

804
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,032
Lunch? - No.

805
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,099
Coffee? - Look, Raghu.

806
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,904
...l've a lecture to attend so
I cant talk to you right now.

807
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:21,746
Understand?
You need not meet nor treat me.

808
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,682
And stop following me. Okay?

809
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,720
Ankita. - Hey, Santu. Santu!
- Ankita, please.

810
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:31,759
Ankita, listen to me for once.
-Hey Ankita.

811
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:33,658
...l your senior. Just get away.
- Shut up.

812
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,231
So what if you are a senior?
- Santu! Hey, Santu!

813
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,404
You are dead.
- Oh God.

814
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,337
You will no more exist
in this college.

815
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,308
Are you happy now?

816
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:51,513
The consequence is going
to be really bad.

817
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,476
You may also come for the
birthday party on Sunday.

818
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,079
You.

819
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:02,750
'Though I was tensed about
the clash with seniors..

820
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:08,087
...but I feel it's worth
fighting for Ankita.'

821
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:21,106
Hey Santu, being a man
you should be courageous.

822
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:24,939
Will you forget me now?
- I will never do that.

823
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:29,546
Hello.
- What?

824
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,088
Hello, guys. - Hi.

825
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,990
Did you both patch up?
- Vishvvas, our hero slapped Raghu.

826
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:41,558
Santu, why did you do that?
- You get going.

827
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:45,793
Why should we fear?
We will teach them.

828
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,903
Santu was right. Lefs go.

829
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:53,035
We three have a request to you.
I'll present you a big gift.

830
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,734
I don't need a gift.
Tell me, what is it?

831
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:58,335
Will you invite Kirti, Shravanti and..

832
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,140
Rutika madam for your birthday?

833
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,443
Madam'? That's impossible.

834
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,850
No way. - Lefs go.
-Ankita, please.

835
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:08,185
Please. - Don't miss Shravanti.
-That's impossible. -Please.

836
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:12,292
Should I come?
- Yes. VVe'll have great fun.

837
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:15,559
Okay, I'll come.
- Cool. Thanks.

838
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:18,799
One thing.
The guy with long hair in your group.

839
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:23,265
Tyson. -ls he mad?
Why is he after me?

840
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:25,439
He's not mad,
but he likes you very much.

841
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,600
Funny.
-But he really likes you very much.

842
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,205
He will land in trouble.
- He doesn't fear.

843
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:32,873
Hi.
- Hi.

844
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:34,542
Hi, Kirti. - Hi.

845
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:36,583
This Sunday is your birthday,
right? I'll be there.

846
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:39,119
Thank you. - Praveen told me.
- Cool. Thanks.

847
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:43,122
Funny. Why do you students
invite the lecturers?

848
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,253
Actually.

849
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,597
All right. Ask Vishwas
to come and meet me.

850
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:49,823
Okay, ma'am.

851
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,300
Madam, you must come.

852
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,834
Don't you speak English?

853
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,596
Speak to me in English.
- Madam, you come. Please.

854
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:06,138
Look, this is my husband.

855
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:10,482
Golden star, Ganesh?
- No.

856
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,346
My husband resembles Ganesh.

857
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,980
Now you get the point.
-Hello. Hello. Hello.

858
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:18,083
Still, you come, madam.

859
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,123
All right. Do one thing.

860
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:23,995
Memorize this poem and
recite it to me by evening.

861
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,566
Then I'll come.

862
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:28,831
I will do it, madam.
-V\/hat'?

863
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,864
I will do it, madam.
I will do it, madam.

864
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,115
Tyson.

865
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,653
Hi. You called me?

866
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,759
Don't get exited. Ankita invited me
for her birthday party.

867
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,997
L'll not be able to come.
- But you told her you'll be coming?

868
00:55:57,088 --> 00:55:59,125
But now I am saying
I'll not be able to come.

869
00:55:59,223 --> 00:56:00,634
Why? ls he pressuring you?

870
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,901
He can easily thrash you.

871
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,637
Why do you get so exited?
Does anyone hit their senior?

872
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,271
They will surely react.

873
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,984
Stop laughing.
You'll be under pressure not me.

874
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,552
I am telling for your own betterment.

875
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,755
Thanks for being concerned about me.

876
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,548
Madam! Madam!

877
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:25,118
Madam! Madam! Just a minute.
- Yes, Vishwas?

878
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,822
Evening poem. What madam?
- Come on, recite.

879
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,991
If you can dream and not make
your dream as your master.

880
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,159
If you can think and not make
your thoughts your aim.

881
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,237
If you can meet with
disaster and try your..

882
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:37,533
If you can...?

883
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,167
If you can..

884
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,103
If you can..

885
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:43,137
No, Vishvvas.
- Madam.

886
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,005
Madam. -No.
- Madam, please.

887
00:56:45,136 --> 00:56:46,809
Wait, madam. Madam, please.

888
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,542
Wait, madam. Madam, please.

889
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,015
Wait, madam. Madam, please.
Madam, please.

890
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:54,783
Madam, please. Wait, madam.
Madam, please. Madam!

891
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:03,632
Happy birthday, Ankita!
- Thanks.

892
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:08,002
Ankita, you look beautiful today.

893
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:13,573
Thanks. - Did Shravanti come?
- No.

894
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:16,737
Sorry.

895
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,777
I tried my best but she didn't come.

896
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,008
Cool, man.

897
00:57:21,338 --> 00:57:23,113
It's okay. No problem.

898
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,918
Lefs go. - Yes, come.

899
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,753
We are late because of you.

900
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,320
L'd been for a hair cut.
- Shut up.

901
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:02,649
Thanks.

902
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:16,929
"My life has become beautiful
after you came."

903
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:22,602
"It is you who taught me
hovv to love."

904
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,571
Bye. -Bye. Bye-

905
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,748
Lefs go. Bye. Take care.

906
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,986
...me to this vvorld..
- Okay aunt, bye. - Bye.

907
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,589
Bye. -The food was very delicious.
- Thank you. - Bye.

908
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,588
Okay Ankita, bye.
- Bye.

909
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,394
Are you happy? - Yes.

910
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:46,992
Santu, you must treat us for this.
- Sure.

911
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:49,465
Look, there's an auto coming.

912
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:51,133
Auto! Auto!

913
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,805
Will you come to Rajajinagar?
- No.

914
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:55,705
Come on, it's late.

915
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,041
My wife's pregnant and
she'll be waiting for me.

916
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:01,881
You touched our hearts. All right.

917
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,347
Not a single auto we find.
What do we do now?

918
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:07,548
Santu will drop us home on his bike.

919
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,550
Do you think it to be a truck?

920
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,489
Do whatever you want but l..

921
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:25,774
Let's be together.

922
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,113
Praveen, stop!
- Stop!

923
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:09,043
I spare you since you are
my sister's friend. Get away!

924
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,313
Get away! You rascal!

925
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:20,823
My spectacles!

926
01:00:31,262 --> 01:00:32,502
Oh God!

927
01:00:41,172 --> 01:00:44,153
If you mess with the senior again,
you'll be killed.

928
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:48,679
How dare you entice my girl?
Hit him! Hit him!

929
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:51,222
Oh God!

930
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:54,853
Police! Let's go! Run, everyone.

931
01:00:58,723 --> 01:00:59,827
Oh God.

932
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,035
Tyson?
- What is it?

933
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:04,296
Are you okay?
- Yes. - Santu.

934
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,139
Tyson, are you okay?
-Lift him.

935
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,034
Lift him.
-Tyson.

936
01:01:16,307 --> 01:01:17,684
Hey, Santu, vvhafs up?

937
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:20,381
Ankita, open your back door
of your house. - Why?

938
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:22,614
Open it first.
- Okay.

939
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,220
Oh God.

940
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,021
What happened to you, guys?

941
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:33,025
Bring cotton.
- What happened?

942
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,228
First bring it.
- All right.

943
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,204
What happened actually, Santu?

944
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:42,200
The senior attacked us.

945
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,712
This is really terrible.

946
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,976
Let's lodge a police complaint.
-Ankita, give me the cotton.

947
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:51,744
Praveen, are you all right?
- Yes.

948
01:02:00,618 --> 01:02:03,098
Thank you, Ankita. I will do it.
- Okay.

949
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:08,662
God.

950
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,098
It's hurting.

951
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,539
Let me help you, Vishvvas.
- Leave.

952
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:18,144
Damn it.
- What you did was wrong.

953
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:21,112
I didn't say a word thinking the
truth will be revealed in before them.

954
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:25,014
I would've understood you
if you were really scared.

955
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:29,114
But you favored them
betraying us just for Kirti.

956
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,522
What you did was wrong.

957
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:34,527
I again tell you. She's not worth.

958
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,024
Her family is very dangerous.

959
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,901
They will ruin you one day.

960
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,661
Listen to me.
Don't be serious about her.

961
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:45,273
Santu, Tyson, let's go.

962
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,134
Bye, Ankita.

963
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,036
Okay Ankita, goodnight.

964
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,871
Santu..

965
01:02:53,504 --> 01:02:54,608
...l am sorry.

966
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:58,613
I am the one
who's responsible for all this.

967
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:05,619
I never thought this matter
would get so serious.

968
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,262
Why do you cry for such minor matter?

969
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,994
Go and sleep.

970
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,969
'That day I realized
how dangerous fear is.'

971
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:21,007
Bye. -'We did fear our seniors
as they were ragging us..

972
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:23,940
...but after this incident
we stopped fearing them.'

973
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:26,845
'We were beaten by them.

974
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:30,311
...but started getting a feeling
that we are bravos.'

975
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,615
'That was not the end of it.'

976
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,547
'Vishvvas got very aggressive.'

977
01:03:34,712 --> 01:03:36,453
'Since he was from
a dangerous district.'

978
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,856
Stop everybody.
- Come on stop.

979
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:42,189
We have to spend another
four years in this college?

980
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,526
Look hovv badly they've beaten them.

981
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:46,632
They've attacked them like
a mafia gang would.

982
01:03:46,724 --> 01:03:51,070
Quiet, Ankita.
-We will go to the canteen and talk.

983
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:52,964
Don't create a chaos here.
- No.

984
01:03:53,097 --> 01:03:54,838
We will complain to the principal.

985
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,870
If you complain then their career
will be ruined.

986
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,777
Let's go to the canteen
and talk to them.

987
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:01,780
Do you take the senior for granted?

988
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:05,751
What do you think of yourselves?
Satish, this was just a trail.

989
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,619
Next time we will break their bones.

990
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:11,285
Dare you do that. Just a phone call..

991
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:16,421
...and the bullies will come
and beat you all to death.

992
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:21,459
Santu, stop it.
- How dare you tell that?

993
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,105
Stop it everybody.

994
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,398
Angi, stop it now.

995
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:28,207
Move back. Sit down.

996
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,977
Whats the matter with you guys?

997
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:33,810
Why did you hit your senior?

998
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:35,610
It just happened
all of a sudden, Satish.

999
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:37,111
I even apologized.

1000
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:40,650
Satish, Santu hit him since
he was harassing me.

1001
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:42,289
Ankita, quiet.

1002
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,459
Satish, he's trying to a hero
in front of the girls.

1003
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:47,061
Being a junior,
how dare he entice with my girl'?

1004
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:48,629
Hey, you.
- Vishvvas.

1005
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,430
Santu, stop it.

1006
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:58,004
Stop it. - Stop it.
-Get back to your places. - Dare you..

1007
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,905
You made a mistake
hitting your senior.

1008
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,272
Let bygones be bygones.

1009
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:04,641
Get back to your classes.

1010
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:07,915
Go. -Won't you react
if your junior hits you?

1011
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,415
Get back to your classes.

1012
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:10,985
We will not complain.

1013
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,246
We are ready to compromise.

1014
01:05:13,544 --> 01:05:16,855
But ask them to stop ragging us.
-Why should we stop?

1015
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,958
We will not stop it
until the freshers party.

1016
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,801
Do one thing. Will you both
play a cricket match?

1017
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,202
Cricket match? With these kids?

1018
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,869
Look, you must stop ragging them
if they win. Agree?

1019
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:40,778
Not just ragging,
I will give away my girl to him.

1020
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:44,448
You can even kiss her if you want to.

1021
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:52,519
OOOOWe have professional players.
- They will never win.

1022
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,034
Aren't you ashamed to bet on me?

1023
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,999
Shras, take it easy.
They will never win.

1024
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:10,105
I will kill you.
Cancel the deal first.

1025
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,745
Don't show me your face until then.

1026
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:15,077
If you repeat it again,
I will hit you with my slippers.

1027
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:18,186
Go.
- Shras! Shras, please!

1028
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:19,946
Please!

1029
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,449
We must vvin against them.

1030
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:27,392
They should never bother us again.

1031
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,492
I will prepare a high-tech bat.

1032
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,655
You will play really well with it.
-Tyson..

1033
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,391
...even that fatso
is a professional player.

1034
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,992
Do something about him too.

1035
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:37,003
<i>We must Wm the game first.</i>

1036
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:40,271
We need good players in our team.
-Don't worry.

1037
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,741
I will play well.
-Is it?

1038
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,072
Have you played cricket before?

1039
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:47,411
Not cricket, but I've played
hockey in my village.

1040
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:49,183
That's wonderful.
- Yes.

1041
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,252
I used to play the game really well.
- He seems to be good.

1042
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,413
Lefs go.

1043
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:56,584
We got to vvin this.

1044
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,923
...otherwise our dignity will be
ruined in the college.

1045
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,520
We will surely win.
-V\/hat if we lose?

1046

That's the end of the over.

He has bowled it short
and Praveen has.

1061
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:21,409

'Summer holidays were very exciting
during our school days.

1157
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,948
'But now it is quite boring.'

1158
01:17:28,378 --> 01:17:30,358
'There were no good movies
which were worth watching.'

1159
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:32,049
'No cricket matches too.'

1160
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:36,196
'Whereas Ankita was busy
with her beauty parlor sessions.'

1161
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,826
'The girls are always concerned
about their looks.'

1162
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,262

'After few days Vishwas was back
with some DVDs.'

lt's Ankita's call.

1168

Come on, it's quite interesting.

1169

Hello.
- Where are you guys?

1170
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,737
No one bothered to call or meet me.

1171
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,831
By the by, what are you guys doing?
-Nothing at all.

1172
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,502
You tell me.

1173

Shall we go to watch it?

01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:29,280
What kind of guys you are?

1176
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,282
Do you expect me to buy the tickets'?

1177
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,580
Aren't you ashamed?
-Shall we go in the evening?

1178
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,087
I will buy the tickets.

1179
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:38,516
That's like a good boy. Okay, bye.

1180
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:41,760
'Maybe the DVD affect on me..

1181
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:45,257
...l felt like I was carrying
the vvorld's burden.'

1182
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:49,734
Santu, watch the movie.

1183
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:53,704
'That day I was unable
to control myself.'

1184
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:58,202
'Forgetting about the movie
I tried out something.'

1185
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:04,045
'But Ankita was very clever.'

1186
01:19:13,383 --> 01:19:15,090
Whats the matter with you today?

1187
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:17,053
Are you out of your mind?

1188
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:19,799
It's not what you think.

1189
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:22,296
After watching the DVDs..

1190
01:19:22,492 --> 01:19:24,529
...l didn't find the movie interesting
in the theatre.

1191
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:25,966
Alright.

Madam. - 'But there was major change
in the college.'

- Congratulation, Praveen.

1217
01:20:52,982 --> 01:20:55,292
With a difference of just 0.5%.

1218
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:58,297
Just 0.5% difference.
Go and receive it.

1219
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:03,059
Hey, Praveen. Whats the matter
with him? - Forget him.

1220
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:08,336
Hello. -I spent so much money
on your admission, but you failed.

1221
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,602
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1222
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,139
Father, it is not called as fail.

1223
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:14,714
It is called backlogs.

1224
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:16,477
I will clear it next time.

1225
01:21:16,606 --> 01:21:18,142
You don't worry, father.

1226
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:20,344
It's not me but it is you
who has to be worried.

1227
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:22,514
You would've realized
if I'd thrashed you.

1228
01:21:22,612 --> 01:21:25,650
You still dicln't realize
the importance of education.

1229
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:27,694
Father.
- You are such a useless guy.

1230
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,228
Father, actually.
- You wasted my money.

1231
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,956
You rascal!

1232
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,399
Get going-

1233
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:40,633
Tyson!

1234
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:43,143
Okay. Bye.
-Did you call me?

1235
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,108
Don't get exited.

1236
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,848
Why did you quit computer science?
Are you mad?

1237
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:49,177
Can I sit?

1238
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:54,953
I am not interested in it.
I want to do robotics.

1239
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,949
C++ and..
- Stop lyiflQ-

1240
01:21:58,181 --> 01:22:00,821
I'm your senior.
You're doing this Praveen,
aren't you'?

1241
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:02,928
He doesn't deserve it.

1242
01:22:03,186 --> 01:22:04,529
Don't ruin your career.

1243
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:07,863
He will surely betray you someday.
-How do you know?

1244
01:22:07,991 --> 01:22:10,904
I can guess seeing
the kind of girlfriend he has.

1245
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:14,574
Go from here.
- Why are you getting so nervous?

1246
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:18,842
Are you scared or you love Rahul?

1247
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:22,413
Go to your classes. Junior has
no right to question the senior.

1248
01:22:22,572 --> 01:22:24,108
Understand? Go.

1249
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,912
Okay. See you.
Thanks for your concern.

1250
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,123
Hey. - Hey. Thanks.

1251
01:22:32,382 --> 01:22:34,089
Congrats, man. -Thank you very much.

1252
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:35,526
I just heard the news.
- Congrats again.

1253
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:36,790
Congrats. - Thank you.

1254
01:22:36,919 --> 01:22:38,865
I hope you didn't change
your subject for my sake?

1255
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,798
Hey, come on, I like mechanical.
You know it.

1256
01:22:42,892 --> 01:22:44,132
Thanks, my friend. -Praveen..

1257
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:46,138
...you must top this time
in computer science.

1258
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:47,537
Hi, hero. Congrats.

1259
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,405
Thank you.
-So, when are you going to treat us?

1260
01:22:49,599 --> 01:22:52,136
Aren't you guys tired of partying?

1261
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,008
Lefs go on a trip?

1262
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,444
Goa or Ivlangalore.
-Okay. Too good.

1263
01:22:56,606 --> 01:22:58,244
Appu, what do you think?

1264
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:03,353
'It is girls' rights
refusing for everything.'

1265
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:09,327
Please. - 'God knows whether
they pretend or really mean it.'

1266
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:14,592
'But we somehow managed
to convince the parents.'

1267
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:16,562
'Except one.'

1268
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:22,206
Key. The bike key.

1269
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:24,106
Give it to me.

1270
01:23:26,636 --> 01:23:29,048
Money. Money.

1271
01:23:36,746 --> 01:23:38,487
Get out, I say!
- Okay, sir.

1272
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:43,726
Niranjan. -Yes?
-You cannot go like this.

1273
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,264
Please, sit down.
- Why, sir?

1274
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:47,025
Don't try to fool me, Niranjan.

1275
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,499
I know what you are teaching, sir.
Let me go, sir.

1276
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:52,003
I can solve the problem for you.
-Okay.

1277
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,995
It's over, sir. - Well done, my boy.

1278
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:20,562
You've done a great job.
You can go now.

1279
01:24:21,123 --> 01:24:22,261
Well done, man.
- Thanks.

1280
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:25,031
Thank you. -All the best.
- Thanks. Bye.

1281
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:27,667
Hi, Shras.

1282
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:31,107
Can I drop you?
- No. Thanks.

1283
01:24:31,968 --> 01:24:34,574
Both of us are going home.

1284
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:38,684
Whafs wrong in that?
Do you fear Rahul?

1285
01:24:39,842 --> 01:24:42,516
Junior shouldn't question the senior.
Understand?

1286
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:46,219
Anyway, I am not coming.
Just don't bother.

1287
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:53,901
Hi. Shravanti.

1288
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:57,294
What is it? - I want you to come
for the trip with us.

1289
01:24:57,827 --> 01:24:59,670
No. - I will talk to aunt
if you want me to.

1290
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,070
No. - Aunt!

1291
01:25:01,197 --> 01:25:02,574
No. - Aunt!

1292
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,700
Do you have even girls coming?
- Yes, aunt.

1293
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:06,609
Then why didn't they come to meet me?

1294
01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:10,047
Shravanti is my friend.
So I want to take her along, aunt.

1295
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:14,517
I don't want to fool you by
bringing the girls to convince you.

1296
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:19,054
Thanks, dear. This is kind of
attitude I always look for.

1297
01:25:20,983 --> 01:25:22,929
L've no problem if she's interested.

1298
01:25:23,653 --> 01:25:24,757
Why should I come when
I don't belong to your batch?

1299
01:25:24,854 --> 01:25:26,800
You can come for me.
- Why should I?

1300
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:30,495
What relationship do we have?

1301
01:25:31,928 --> 01:25:35,569
I only know you as my junior
and a brilliant student.

1302
01:25:35,932 --> 01:25:39,744
Is it just that? Tell me the truth.
Aren't you interested in coming?

1303
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:43,076
Are you scared of anyone?
-Didn't I say you?

1304
01:25:43,406 --> 01:25:45,909
Junior shouldn't be
questioning the senior?

1305
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:48,215
I am not questioning
but requesting you.

1306
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,154
I am not interested.

1307
01:25:57,887 --> 01:25:58,991
Tyson!

1308
01:26:02,892 --> 01:26:04,098
Actually.

1309
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:07,398
...l am scared whether they..

1310
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:11,174
...they would harm you.

1311
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,040
Got it? - Shras, come
if you are really interested.

1312
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:16,675
And it's okay otherwise.

1313
01:26:19,442 --> 01:26:20,614
What if I am in two minds?

1314
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:23,314
Then it is going to be
complicated, Shras.

1315
01:26:52,008 --> 01:26:56,582
"This is more than
a blood relationship."

1316
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:01,356
"This relationship
can happen anytime."

1317
01:27:02,285 --> 01:27:06,859
"They stand by each other
during the difficult times."

1318
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:11,599
"They share love and sorrow."

1319
01:27:12,595 --> 01:27:15,633
"Walking hand in hand."

1320
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,045
"Keep going ahead in life."

1321
01:27:26,809 --> 01:27:31,155
"This is what is called friendship."

1322
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:41,432
"Let it last forever."

1323
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:12,430
"We don't bother who we are."

1324
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:17,536
"Where we come from."

1325
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:22,842
"We still share
feelings for each other."

1326
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:27,277
"When we are together."

1327
01:28:28,204 --> 01:28:33,085
"..it makes us feel complete."

1328
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,719
"We sometime quarreL."

1329
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:38,351
"..we sometime pamper one another."

1330
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:43,863
"This is how our friendship will be."

1331
01:28:44,754 --> 01:28:48,292
"Walking hand in hand."

1332
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,466
"Keep going ahead in life."

1333
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:03,448
"This is what is called friendship."

1334
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:13,751
"Let it last forever."

1335
01:29:37,073 --> 01:29:47,017
"Making paper boats
as and when rain pours."

1336
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:52,383
"We are fond of
each other's naughtiness."

1337
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:07,747
"Our happiness that we got
from our mischievousness is endless."

1338
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:13,347
"And this will go on."

1339
01:30:14,309 --> 01:30:17,984
"Walking hand in hand."

1340
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:22,919
"Keep going ahead in life."

1341
01:30:28,557 --> 01:30:33,404
"This is what is called friendship."

1342
01:30:38,734 --> 01:30:43,649
"Let it last forever."

1343
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:12,709
Damn it. Our lives are going in vain.

1344
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:16,045
Neither entertainment nor education.

1345
01:31:16,172 --> 01:31:19,244
We are just wasted. Look at him.

1346
01:31:19,408 --> 01:31:24,118
He's a topper and he gets
computer science seat because of him.

1347
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,692
And girlfriend for a kiss.

1348
01:31:26,882 --> 01:31:29,556
He's having the time of his life.
We are just wasted.

1349
01:31:30,019 --> 01:31:33,432
Though I'm a senior I haven't been
so lenient to boyfriend.

1350
01:31:34,123 --> 01:31:37,263
Being a junior, this is too much.

1351
01:31:37,459 --> 01:31:40,872
Who do I have
other than that fat girl?

1352
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:44,806
Ankita and you together
can do anything you want.

1353
01:31:44,967 --> 01:31:48,574
Whereas you are trying
to impress your senior.

1354
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:50,241
Do you think it's going to work out?

1355
01:31:50,372 --> 01:31:52,215
Did Rahul kiss you anytime?

1356
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:55,053
He did try, but I told that
I would slap him if he did so.

1357
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:58,715
Well, hovv do I
approach her for a kiss?

1358
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:01,359
Shut you. lt's not the way you think.

1359
01:32:01,484 --> 01:32:02,827
It was just general.

1360
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:05,159
This is what everyone in
the college thinks.

1361
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:07,662
Shras is an open minded girl.
I will stand by you if anything happened.

1362
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:11,203
I will stand by you
if anything happened. -No. No.

1363
01:32:13,462 --> 01:32:15,271
Here they come.

1364
01:32:15,998 --> 01:32:17,568
Hi, girls.
- Hi, guys.

1365
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,804
Hi, Shras.
- Hi.

1366
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:20,504
Hi, Appu. - Hi.

1367
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,251
Shall we play cards?

1368
01:32:27,376 --> 01:32:28,719
L've ordered for the dinner
here itself.

1369
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:31,121
Appu, what were you three talking
for all this while?

1370
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,725
About their kiss?
- Shut up, you rascal.

1371
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,260
Shall we play cards?

1372
01:32:36,585 --> 01:32:37,689
9K8)'-

1373
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:46,462
'I don't know about others
but their kiss.

1374
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:49,173
...brought a feeling in me.'

1375
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:58,113
What about the dinner?

1376
01:32:58,207 --> 01:33:01,313
'We were happy that Shravanti
came along with us for the trip.'

1377
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:04,950
'But the trip costed her pet's life.'

1378
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,806
'That night was unforgettable.'

1379
01:33:22,498 --> 01:33:24,500
This is the projection. The top.

1380
01:33:51,827 --> 01:33:53,067
Whats the matter?

1381
01:33:53,562 --> 01:33:54,700
Just go home.

1382
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:56,033
Go.

1383
01:34:00,002 --> 01:34:02,539
I see a change in your behavior.

1384
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,324
Ankita.
- Yes?

1385
01:34:14,616 --> 01:34:15,720
Ankita.

1386
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:19,830
...you look very beautiful today.

1387
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:25,929
I feel like.. kissing you. Thafs it.

1388
01:34:28,397 --> 01:34:31,970
You asked me and I said
whatever was on my mind.

1389
01:34:32,401 --> 01:34:33,573
Out.

1390
01:34:35,904 --> 01:34:37,042
Damn it.

1391
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,795
Father, Santu is good boy.

1392
01:35:32,628 --> 01:35:35,006
But I don't know what happened to him.

1393
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:38,807
He never misbehaved
like this before, father.

1394
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:42,173
I am so sorry.

1395
01:35:42,804 --> 01:35:44,613
Don't look at me like that.

1396
01:35:49,111 --> 01:35:52,285
I can handle it.
-Why are you crying, dear?

1397
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:54,892
Did you shout at you?
-You don't say a word..

1398
01:35:56,385 --> 01:35:59,195
...but you'll feel bad about it.
-Calm down.

1399
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:02,334
Let bygones be bygones.

1400
01:36:09,998 --> 01:36:12,171
Shall we consider this as our date?

1401
01:36:12,701 --> 01:36:14,408
If so, shall I arrange for the dinner?

1402
01:36:14,536 --> 01:36:17,244
You need not get exited about this.
lt's just a movie.

1403
01:36:17,406 --> 01:36:19,443
You say another word I will go away.

1404
01:36:19,575 --> 01:36:21,111
Okay. I was just kidding?

1405
01:36:26,215 --> 01:36:27,353
Popcorn?

1406
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,454
Thanks.

1407
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:33,325
Cold drinks?

1408
01:36:41,763 --> 01:36:44,869
Isn't she Kirti?

1409
01:36:47,336 --> 01:36:49,441
He's not Praveen. Then who is he?

1410
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:51,543
Hey, Kirti.

1411
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:54,813
Are you out of your mind?
-Let me.

1412
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:57,286
She doesn't need him anymore.

1413
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:00,622
Lefs go.

1414
01:37:01,116 --> 01:37:02,356
Tyson.

1415
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:15,101
Hi, Kirti. - Hi, Praveen.

1416
01:37:15,297 --> 01:37:17,334
I am watching a wonderful movie
in the theatre.

1417
01:37:17,466 --> 01:37:19,275
Who is with you?
- My cousin.

1418
01:37:19,468 --> 01:37:21,038
Come right away.

1419
01:37:21,236 --> 01:37:23,512
Right away? - I should be watching
this movie with you.

1420
01:37:23,605 --> 01:37:26,484
Lefs watch it some other day.
- All right. Bye.

1421
01:37:30,045 --> 01:37:31,319
What it Kirti?

1422
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:34,191
Does she want a kiss?
- Come on.

1423
01:37:34,416 --> 01:37:37,590
Don't get exited. -Why shouldn't I?

1424
01:37:37,786 --> 01:37:39,993
Praveen will be dejected
if he gets to know about it.

1425
01:37:40,122 --> 01:37:42,568
Are you going to tell him about it?
- Of course.

1426
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:45,668
Is she a girl or a witch?
I just don't believe this.

1427
01:37:45,827 --> 01:37:49,206
Will he believe it? - V\/e're friends
and he'll surely believe me.

1428
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:51,769
Hey, Praveen.
- Hi, Tyson.

1429
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,671
Praveen, forget Kirti.
- Whats the matter?

1430
01:37:54,803 --> 01:37:56,874
You don't have to know the reason.

1431
01:37:57,039 --> 01:37:58,916
Listen to me. Forget her.

1432
01:37:59,241 --> 01:38:01,016
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1433
01:38:01,243 --> 01:38:03,883
Today, I saw Kirti with
a guy in the theatre.

1434
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,021
They were very close to each other.

1435
01:38:06,215 --> 01:38:08,718
If I tell you more then
you will be dejected. Please.

1436
01:38:08,817 --> 01:38:11,058
Tyson, don't get much exited.

1437
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,822
She'd just called me.

1438
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:14,796
She has gone for a movie
with her cousin.

1439
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:17,461
She asked me to join her since
the movie was interesting.

1440
01:38:17,759 --> 01:38:19,102
But I didn't go.

1441
01:38:19,528 --> 01:38:21,804
She's a cunning girl.

1442
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:23,535
She's up to something.

1443
01:38:23,665 --> 01:38:26,612
She will betray you.
Please, listen to me. - Stop it.

1444
01:38:26,935 --> 01:38:29,506
You are crossing your limits.
You very well know I love her.

1445
01:38:29,604 --> 01:38:32,278
I am sure she will not betray me.
-Praveen, listen to me.

1446
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:33,785
She is a characterless girl.

1447
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,081
She kissed him in the public.

1448
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:36,450
You can ask Shras if you want to.

1449
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:39,058
Think about your education and
your family background.

1450
01:38:39,514 --> 01:38:40,754
Shut up.

1451
01:38:41,016 --> 01:38:43,018
Do you expect me to ask
Shravanti about Kirti?

1452
01:38:43,151 --> 01:38:44,994
Hey, Shra..
- Quiet.

1453
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,358
Shravanti has no right
to talk about her.

1454
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:49,526
She was found flirting
with many seniors.

1455
01:38:49,691 --> 01:38:51,227
Look at dresses she wears.

1456
01:38:51,393 --> 01:38:53,566
She has a bad reputation
in the college.

1457
01:38:54,296 --> 01:38:55,400
Did you see her?

1458
01:38:55,731 --> 01:38:58,302
Did you see her
flirting with other guys?

1459
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:03,745
I saw Kirti kissing him in the public.

1460
01:39:04,072 --> 01:39:05,551
Enough. Stop it.

1461
01:39:05,974 --> 01:39:08,580
Idiot, Shravanti is not our topic.

1462
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:11,584
I saw it myself.
- I will talk about Shravanti.

1463
01:39:11,713 --> 01:39:13,624
If Shravanti is good girl to you
then Kirti is also good girl to me.

1464
01:39:13,782 --> 01:39:16,160
Are you finished? Now listen to me.

1465
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,294
Though Shravanti flirts
with other guys..

1466
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,524
...she never crosses her limits.

1467
01:39:20,655 --> 01:39:22,464
And if she does,
she would say it with courage.

1468
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:24,264
She will not behave like Kirti.

1469
01:39:24,393 --> 01:39:27,306
I have the confidence,
do you have the confidence?

1470
01:39:27,429 --> 01:39:28,874
I will bet my life on it.

1471
01:39:29,031 --> 01:39:30,840
Do you have the confidence? Tell me.

1472
01:39:30,999 --> 01:39:33,001
You don't know anything about Kirti.

1473
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:34,811
You do her assignments.

1474
01:39:34,936 --> 01:39:37,143
You take her for movies.
You buy gifts for her.

1475
01:39:37,272 --> 01:39:41,914
You do all this since
you are insecure about her.

1476
01:39:42,344 --> 01:39:46,554
Don't compare Shravanti to Kirti.

1477
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:49,728
Kirti is not trust worthy.
She's a lousy girl.

1478
01:39:50,052 --> 01:39:51,827
She's very intelligent girl.

1479
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,262
I am telling you for the last time.

1480
01:39:54,389 --> 01:39:57,029
I hear another word about Kirti
I will thrash you.

1481
01:39:57,159 --> 01:39:59,332
Santu, ask him to just shut his mouth.

1482
01:39:59,428 --> 01:40:01,135
I will talk about her.
She's a lousy girl.

1483
01:40:01,296 --> 01:40:03,572
I will prove it.
I will tell this several times.

1484
01:40:03,732 --> 01:40:05,439
Don't you understand what I say?

1485
01:40:05,533 --> 01:40:08,377
Don't you? - Praveen.
-Praveen, calm down.

1486
01:40:08,536 --> 01:40:11,210
Tyson, get up. Why do you interfere
in his personal life?

1487
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,910
How dare you comment on Kirti's
character? -Praveen..

1488
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:14,715
...calm down, my friend.

1489
01:40:15,877 --> 01:40:18,323
She's manipulating you.

1490
01:40:19,047 --> 01:40:20,390
You are such a fool.

1491
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:23,891
Not just build your muscles
but get mature too.

1492
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:26,759
Dare you talk about Kirti.
- Praveen.

1493
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:28,059
Dare you.

1494
01:40:28,223 --> 01:40:29,759
Dare you talk about my Kirti.
- Tyson, get up.

1495
01:40:30,959 --> 01:40:32,996
Praveen, are you out of your mind?

1496
01:40:33,161 --> 01:40:35,300
You hit your friend.
Go away from here.

1497
01:40:36,064 --> 01:40:38,408
Why does he not believe me?

1498
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:41,413
You needn't be concerned about him.
To hell with him.

1499
01:40:46,107 --> 01:40:48,383
Forget him. ls this what I deserve?

1500
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:50,949
He's a good friend of mine.

1501
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,787
Since I wanted him to
build a good career..

1502
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:56,086
...l gave my computer science
seat to him.

1503
01:40:56,818 --> 01:40:59,890
How can I watch him being ruined?

1504
01:40:59,988 --> 01:41:01,797
Tyson, it's your fault.

1505
01:41:01,923 --> 01:41:04,995
I knew he would betray us someday.

1506
01:41:05,093 --> 01:41:07,539
He's not trust worthy.
He's a selfish guy.

1507
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:10,810
But still, he is our best friend.

1508
01:41:22,244 --> 01:41:24,417
What is it? - Shras, I am sorry.

1509
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,954
Tyson, please go away.

1510
01:41:29,717 --> 01:41:30,889
I am really tired.

1511
01:41:31,853 --> 01:41:34,732
I never expected people are
having such an opinion about me.

1512
01:41:35,123 --> 01:41:36,329
It's really shocking.

1513
01:41:36,991 --> 01:41:38,971
Please, leave me alone.

1514
01:41:39,394 --> 01:41:41,874
Forget me. - Shras, but
I've a good opinion about you.

1515
01:41:41,964 --> 01:41:43,671
It doesn't matter. Okay? Please.

1516
01:41:50,973 --> 01:41:52,316
Kirti. stop.

1517
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:54,654
Kirti, listen to me. Please.

1518
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:57,818
Just leave him alone.
He has many goals to achieve.

1519
01:41:58,113 --> 01:41:59,524
He's from a poor family.

1520
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:02,523
Why don't you stick around
with your own group?

1521
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:05,758
Get away. -Kirti, stop. Listen to me.

1522
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:07,558
Listen to me, Kirti. - yson..

1523
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:10,067
...don't interfere
in our personal matter.

1524
01:42:10,192 --> 01:42:12,968
Otherwise, the consequence
is going to be worse. That's it.

1525
01:42:17,932 --> 01:42:19,172
Aren't you ashamed?

1526
01:42:22,037 --> 01:42:23,482
I will teach you.

1527
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:30,480
We must not spare Tyson.
- What does he think of himself?

1528
01:42:30,612 --> 01:42:31,989
Lefs go and thrash him.
- Shekar, listen to me.

1529
01:42:32,113 --> 01:42:33,490
He's a crazy guy. Just let him go.

1530
01:42:33,615 --> 01:42:35,356
Lefs teach him.
- Listen to me.

1531
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:37,053
I will make him understancL.
- Why are you favoring him?

1532
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:38,630
Kirti. - Don't you love me?

1533
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,961
He slapped me. Do you know that?

1534
01:42:41,223 --> 01:42:43,032
Nobody had slapped me until now.

1535
01:42:45,927 --> 01:42:47,031
We can't wait until tomorrow.

1536
01:42:47,128 --> 01:42:49,904
Lefs go and thrash him today itself.
-Where does he live?

1537
01:42:49,964 --> 01:42:51,375
How dare he slap my sister?

1538
01:42:51,533 --> 01:42:52,637
<i>Shaker. .</i>

1539
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:55,007
...l will bring him.

1540
01:43:00,509 --> 01:43:01,681
Praveen, come in.

1541
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:04,551
There's an emergency.
- Emergency?

1542
01:43:11,285 --> 01:43:13,561
Praveen, where have you brought me?

1543
01:43:13,822 --> 01:43:15,301
Come with me.
- Whafs going on?

1544
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:17,495
Come. I will explain to you.
- Why did you bring me here?

1545
01:43:17,626 --> 01:43:19,071
You will come to know.

1546
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:28,973
Go.

1547
01:43:33,408 --> 01:43:35,820
Praveen, vvhafs going on?

1548
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,589
Bring him.

1549
01:43:43,785 --> 01:43:44,855
Come on.

1550
01:43:46,955 --> 01:43:49,060
Don't hit me. Let me go.

1551
01:43:49,224 --> 01:43:51,397
Why are you hitting me?

1552
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:58,271
My God. Let me go.

1553
01:44:08,676 --> 01:44:10,019
Oh god! Oh!

1554
01:44:17,853 --> 01:44:19,491
Enough. Lefs go.

1555
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:21,264
Raghu, let's go.

1556
01:44:22,457 --> 01:44:25,529
How dare you hit my sister?
- Come on. Lefs go.

1557
01:44:47,249 --> 01:44:48,387
Hi, Shras.

1558
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,287
How is he? Anything serious?

1559
01:44:51,453 --> 01:44:53,330
Nothing to worry.

1560
01:44:54,689 --> 01:44:55,861
Hi.
- Hi.

1561
01:44:55,957 --> 01:44:57,265
It is hurting very much?

1562
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,605
Just kidding.
- You.

1563
01:45:05,133 --> 01:45:06,305
You.

1564
01:45:07,436 --> 01:45:09,507
Were you both in
the hospital the entire night? - Yes.

1565
01:45:09,704 --> 01:45:11,809
Go home and freshen up.
I will take care of him.

1566
01:45:11,906 --> 01:45:13,943
Okay. See you later.
- See you later.

1567
01:45:14,142 --> 01:45:15,416
Okay. Take care.

1568
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,950
Steamed pancake, coffee, medicines.
- He knows it.

1569
01:45:19,047 --> 01:45:20,424
Okay. Take care. Bye.

1570
01:45:20,548 --> 01:45:22,824
Vishvvas, don't tell
about this to anybody.

1571
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:24,893
It was just an accident. That's it.

1572
01:45:25,019 --> 01:45:29,024
I will not spare. I will teach him.
- At least for my sake.

1573
01:45:29,224 --> 01:45:31,795
I will not spare him for sure.
Lefs go.

1574
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,437
Why do you spare him?

1575
01:45:34,028 --> 01:45:36,008
Why are you so patient towards him?

1576
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:41,175
Shras. Shras, I love you.

1577
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:43,979
I know.
- Don't you love me?

1578
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,586
Did I say that?
- Then why are you avoiding me?

1579
01:45:47,909 --> 01:45:49,946
You must rest now.

1580
01:45:52,113 --> 01:45:53,387
Do you need time?

1581
01:45:53,548 --> 01:45:55,687
Will you let me know later?
-Tyson..

1582
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:58,926
...juniors mustn't question the seniors.

1583
01:46:10,065 --> 01:46:12,238
Vishwas, come in.
- That's all right.

1584
01:46:12,334 --> 01:46:14,541
Praveen.
- Yes? - Vishwas is here.

1585
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:17,841
Yes, Vishwas?
- Nothing.

1586
01:46:18,473 --> 01:46:20,009
Tyson is a bit serious.

1587
01:46:20,141 --> 01:46:22,178
I need to talk to you.
Come with me.

1588
01:46:22,377 --> 01:46:23,685
Just a minute.

1589
01:46:33,722 --> 01:46:36,669
Vishvvas, why did you bring me here?

1590
01:46:36,791 --> 01:46:38,862
Who lives here?
- I will tell you. You rascal.

1591
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,634
How dare you hit Tyson?
How dare you hit him?

1592
01:46:41,863 --> 01:46:43,740
You got him beaten up by the seniors.

1593
01:46:43,865 --> 01:46:45,606
Whats the matter with you?
- You hit Tyson for Kirti.

1594
01:46:45,733 --> 01:46:48,304
Listen to me.
- You hit your friend.

1595
01:46:49,704 --> 01:46:52,116
There's no friendship.

1596
01:46:52,841 --> 01:46:54,718
How dare you!

1597
01:46:54,842 --> 01:46:57,254
You rascal!

1598
01:46:58,446 --> 01:47:00,392
How dare you!

1599
01:47:04,952 --> 01:47:06,431
I will teach you today.

1600
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:08,056
Tyson is your friend too.

1601
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:10,169
He's one of the best friends
we've ever had.

1602
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:12,897
You must lucky to have such a friend.

1603
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:14,165
You rascal.

1604
01:47:15,497 --> 01:47:18,967
He was always concerned about you.

1605
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:22,979
Whereas you hit him
for the sake of Kirti.

1606
01:47:23,104 --> 01:47:25,015
You rascal.

1607
01:47:25,173 --> 01:47:26,880
He must be a fool.

1608
01:47:26,975 --> 01:47:31,822
He gave you his computer science
seat for you.

1609
01:47:33,114 --> 01:47:36,960
Sit down. Sit down.
You are such a useless guy.

1610
01:47:37,218 --> 01:47:38,856
How did you even think of hitting him?

1611
01:47:38,987 --> 01:47:40,489
You rascal.

1612
01:47:40,622 --> 01:47:42,795
Is it hurting?

1613
01:47:42,924 --> 01:47:44,767
Though he's going through pain.

1614
01:47:44,859 --> 01:47:47,840
...he requested us
not to complain about you.

1615
01:47:47,996 --> 01:47:50,567
You are not even worth his shoes.

1616
01:47:50,665 --> 01:47:53,077
You rascal.
- Get away.

1617
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,974
I don't need you guys.

1618
01:47:55,036 --> 01:47:56,310
My Kirti is important to me.

1619
01:47:56,471 --> 01:47:59,714
I love her. - You rascal.
To hell with Kirti.

1620
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:04,517
Get away.
I don't need you guys anymore.

1621
01:48:04,745 --> 01:48:06,247
My goodness.

1622
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:21,306
Jolly! Jolly! Jolly!

1623
01:48:22,296 --> 01:48:24,742
Come on. You want to hit me?

1624
01:48:24,866 --> 01:48:26,436
Why are you guys getting scared?

1625
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:27,671
Come on.

1626
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:29,710
You want to hit me?

1627
01:48:33,107 --> 01:48:35,383
"We are the juniors."

1628
01:48:41,582 --> 01:48:42,720
Hi.
- Hi.

1629
01:48:43,418 --> 01:48:46,092
Hey, you must be Shravanti?
- Yes. -Come in.

1630
01:48:47,455 --> 01:48:49,628
Please, come in. I am Shweta.
-Hi, Shweta.

1631
01:48:49,724 --> 01:48:51,101
How are you?
- I am fine.

1632
01:48:51,226 --> 01:48:53,729
Mother! Mother, Shravanti is here.

1633
01:48:53,828 --> 01:48:55,239
Coming.
- Hello.

1634
01:48:55,897 --> 01:48:58,878
Am I not visible?
-Get away. You visit everyday.

1635
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,438
Hello, aunt.
-He talks about you everyday.

1636
01:49:03,304 --> 01:49:05,511
I am feeling better now.
- Hi. Shras. - Hi.

1637
01:49:05,773 --> 01:49:07,343
Hey. Hi, Shras.
- Hi.

1638
01:49:07,475 --> 01:49:08,647
Hi. - Hi.

1639
01:49:08,843 --> 01:49:10,948
Hi. - Hi.
-Happy birthday.

1640
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:12,183
Thank you.

1641
01:49:12,947 --> 01:49:15,154
What made you come here?
- Shouldn't I be coming here?

1642
01:49:15,416 --> 01:49:17,521
Actually, you are senior.

1643
01:49:18,619 --> 01:49:20,064
Okay. I'll see you.

1644
01:49:20,455 --> 01:49:22,298
L've some work to do. Come.

1645
01:49:22,657 --> 01:49:25,365
See you.
- Ankita, I need to talk to you.

1646
01:49:26,127 --> 01:49:28,403
<i>Okay. Byg
' APP“, you too.</i>

1647
01:49:28,596 --> 01:49:30,371
<i>Why'?
' APP“, come.</i>

1648
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:32,737
Just a minute.

1649
01:49:35,436 --> 01:49:36,676
How are you feeling now?

1650
01:49:41,476 --> 01:49:45,618
What is it? - Let's leave them
alone for sometime.

1651
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,084
What was the need to tell?
You could've signaled.

1652
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:52,024
Calm clown.
We're not intelligent like you.

1653
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,597
You may leave now.
- Ankita, let's go.

1654
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:57,394
Appu, you want me to drop you?

1655
01:49:59,527 --> 01:50:02,872
Shras, you still didn't let me know.

1656
01:50:03,464 --> 01:50:06,934
Tyson, I didn't come across
a guy like you in my life.

1657
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:10,650
You are so special.

1658
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,380
I like you very much.

1659
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:16,952
Shras, you mean, 'no'?

1660
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:19,955
It is because I am younger to you?

1661
01:50:20,482 --> 01:50:22,894
No.
- ls it because Praveen abused you?

1662
01:50:23,317 --> 01:50:24,421
No.

1663
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:28,592
Do you have problem at home?

1664
01:50:30,759 --> 01:50:32,432
Do you love someone else?

1665
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:35,869
I know I don't have a great body.

1666
01:50:42,837 --> 01:50:44,908
It's been a long time.

1667
01:50:45,773 --> 01:50:49,050
I guess, Shras is proposing him.

1668
01:50:49,243 --> 01:50:51,689
Shras, don't you like me?

1669
01:50:52,213 --> 01:50:54,284
I like you more than anybody.

1670
01:50:54,616 --> 01:50:56,789
You've known me very well.

1671
01:50:57,284 --> 01:51:00,595
Then I've no problem.
I don't fear anyone.

1672
01:51:00,688 --> 01:51:02,497
Don't get exited.

1673
01:51:02,724 --> 01:51:04,726
I don't want to be
committed to anyone.

1674
01:51:05,126 --> 01:51:08,596
I just want to go to U.S
and proceed my.

1675
01:51:08,963 --> 01:51:11,341
I just want to study.
-All you need is time, isn't it?

1676
01:51:11,499 --> 01:51:13,103
I will wait for you.
I've no problem.

1677
01:51:13,234 --> 01:51:16,681
It's not that.
I just don't have you in my heart.

1678
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,980
I told you I am leaving.

1679
01:51:19,473 --> 01:51:21,953
I got an admission in
the University of Washington.

1680
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:25,248
I will not see you forever.
Understand?

1681
01:51:27,315 --> 01:51:31,320
What if I come to Washington
in one year as your junior?

1682
01:51:31,919 --> 01:51:35,594
I might fall in love
with someone before you..

1683
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:38,962
What if you fall in love
with me than anyone else?

1684
01:51:42,263 --> 01:51:43,367
Bye.

1685
01:51:44,999 --> 01:51:46,137
Shras.

1686
01:51:48,169 --> 01:51:49,341
Maybe.

1687
01:51:54,074 --> 01:51:57,419
I know juniors shouldn't
be questioning the seniors.

1688
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:05,155
"Friendship."

1689
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,397
...is heaven."

1690
01:52:28,009 --> 01:52:29,420
Here she comes.

1691
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:30,750
Hi, Shras.

1692
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:33,653
Whats the matter with her?
- Come on.

1693
01:52:42,857 --> 01:52:44,530
Did Shravanti leave?

1694
01:52:45,059 --> 01:52:48,905
You are sweetest brother,
aren't you? Don't cry.

1695
01:52:53,801 --> 01:52:55,303
What happened?
- Nothing.

1696
01:52:55,403 --> 01:52:57,906
Is she mad? She will never
find a better guy than you.

1697
01:52:58,005 --> 01:52:59,609
She will be leaving very soon.

1698
01:53:00,575 --> 01:53:02,350
Are you all right?
- Yes.

1699
01:53:02,476 --> 01:53:04,683
Santu, please console him.

1700
01:53:12,853 --> 01:53:14,025
Calm down.

1701
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:16,658
Why do you need this anymore
when she already left?

1702
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:19,497
Lefs go.

1703
01:53:40,081 --> 01:53:41,822
Whafs going on?

1704
01:53:42,016 --> 01:53:44,963
I don't understand
vvhafs on your mind.

1705
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:46,529
Why did we come here?

1706
01:53:46,621 --> 01:53:48,225
Are you out of your mind?

1707
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:50,833
Santu, make him understand.

1708
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,831
Tyson, let's go.

1709
01:53:53,727 --> 01:53:54,933
Santu.

1710
01:53:56,497 --> 01:53:57,737
What is it?

1711
01:53:58,532 --> 01:53:59,977
Just once..

1712
01:54:00,968 --> 01:54:02,276
Just once..

1713
01:54:03,204 --> 01:54:06,185
Imagine for once if Appu or Ankita.

1714
01:54:06,974 --> 01:54:09,011
...gets married to someone else.

1715
01:54:10,478 --> 01:54:15,791
Imagine she's kissing someone.

1716
01:54:16,383 --> 01:54:18,192
She's making with someone.

1717
01:54:19,554 --> 01:54:21,431
Imagine for once.

1718
01:54:23,791 --> 01:54:26,533
It's very painful, isn't it?

1719
01:54:26,961 --> 01:54:30,966
Now I am going through
the similar kind of pain.

1720
01:54:31,499 --> 01:54:33,103
It hurts, isn't it?

1721
01:54:34,435 --> 01:54:38,008
I can't live without her.

1722
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:42,312
I will go join the same university.

1723
01:54:42,677 --> 01:54:46,318
We are just wasting
our time in this college.

1724
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:51,156
I will go as herjunior
in that university.

1725
01:54:51,986 --> 01:54:54,023
I can't stay without her.

1726
01:54:54,222 --> 01:54:56,327
I can't stay without her.

1727
01:55:04,098 --> 01:55:05,941
"Friendship."

1728
01:55:12,873 --> 01:55:14,716
"..is heaven."

1729
01:55:23,217 --> 01:55:24,355
Oh.

1730
01:55:25,986 --> 01:55:27,727
Hey:

1731
01:55:30,458 --> 01:55:33,405
Why did you come here at this hour?
-I am sorry. Forgive me.

1732
01:55:33,494 --> 01:55:35,838
Life without you is terrible.

1733
01:55:35,963 --> 01:55:39,206
Appu, please.
Neither I am able to eat or sleep.

1734
01:55:39,367 --> 01:55:41,472
Trust me, I gave up drinking too.

1735
01:55:41,702 --> 01:55:43,909
Appu, you are everything to me.

1736
01:55:44,004 --> 01:55:46,780
Please, tell me
what you expect me to do?

1737
01:55:46,874 --> 01:55:49,548
Please, say something, Appu.

1738
01:55:50,178 --> 01:55:53,387
Please, say something, Appu.

1739
01:55:53,514 --> 01:55:55,323
Why are you killing me
with your silence?

1740
01:55:55,416 --> 01:55:57,919
Appu, do you love me?

1741
01:55:58,252 --> 01:55:59,424
Please.

1742
01:56:01,489 --> 01:56:02,763
Damn it.

1743
01:56:03,591 --> 01:56:05,867
Appu, I need to talk to you.

1744
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,901
Shall we get married?

1745
01:56:08,095 --> 01:56:09,972
Am I the only girl surviving?

1746
01:56:10,064 --> 01:56:11,566
Don't you see other girls?

1747
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:14,873
Appu, don't hurt me.
I love you very much.

1748
01:56:15,069 --> 01:56:18,346
When did you fall in love with me?
-I guess from right before.

1749
01:56:18,606 --> 01:56:21,815
But I dicln't realize it since
you always dress like boys.

1750
01:56:21,909 --> 01:56:24,947
Now you realized
since I am wearing sari, isn't it?

1751
01:56:25,546 --> 01:56:28,322
Actually.
- All right. I understand.

1752
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:30,395
Granny, let's get married.

1753
01:56:30,451 --> 01:56:32,931
So you want to marry my grandmother.

1754
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:35,933
Did I say your grandmother?
I don't think so.

1755
01:56:36,257 --> 01:56:38,100
I love you very much, Appu.

1756
01:56:38,225 --> 01:56:40,102
Tell me. What do you see now?

1757
01:56:40,728 --> 01:56:43,971
You have beautiful eyes.

1758
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:46,805
Then what about her?
- Are you talking about Archana?

1759
01:56:46,934 --> 01:56:49,505
To hell with her.
-Now look at me properly.

1760
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:54,176
You look like a princess.
-Are you serious?

1761
01:56:54,308 --> 01:56:56,310
I will kill you.
- Appu, I am sorry.

1762
01:56:56,744 --> 01:56:59,657
Do you love me?
- I always loved you.

1763
01:56:59,814 --> 01:57:00,918
Appu.

1764
01:57:02,983 --> 01:57:05,759
Appu, kiss me.
- Get away.

1765
01:57:06,286 --> 01:57:07,560
You naughty.

1766
01:57:40,954 --> 01:57:43,764
Santu, will he be okay?

1767
01:57:44,492 --> 01:57:45,937
He's be all right, uncle

1768
01:58:02,309 --> 01:58:05,552
Uncle, this is how Ankita
and I met first.

1769
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:08,823
Even her hands
were shivering like yours.

1770
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:10,961
She was really tensed.

1771
01:58:12,319 --> 01:58:13,923
Doctor. - Doctor.
-How is he?

1772
01:58:14,388 --> 01:58:16,197
Don't worry. He's out of danger.

1773
01:58:16,323 --> 01:58:18,394
He will regain his conscious
in one hour. -How is he, sir?

1774
01:58:18,592 --> 01:58:20,162
Nothing to worry.

1775
01:58:23,864 --> 01:58:25,707
Hello.
- Father, where are you?

1776
01:58:25,866 --> 01:58:27,709
I am here.
- What do you mean?

1777
01:58:28,035 --> 01:58:29,776
You didn't call nor
did you receive the call.

1778
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:31,543
Everybody here is tensed.

1779
01:58:31,672 --> 01:58:34,278
Listen to me. - What is it?
-Listen to me for a minute.

1780
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:37,117
Bring my Exchequer book
to Suguna hospital.

1781
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:39,416
Suguna hospital?
-Did she yell at you'?

1782
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,316
Yes.
-I know.

1783
01:58:42,249 --> 01:58:43,785
Uncle, I shall leave now.

1784
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:45,758
Are you all right?
- I am fine.

1785
01:58:45,953 --> 01:58:49,423
Santu, thank you. Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1786
01:58:51,625 --> 01:58:52,763
Uncle.

1787
01:58:54,862 --> 01:58:56,273
Uncle, I am sorry.

1788
01:58:56,597 --> 01:59:00,101
Sorry for what? -Actually..
I just wanted to say, uncle.

1789
01:59:01,602 --> 01:59:03,775
Aren't you both talking to each other?

1790
01:59:04,305 --> 01:59:06,285
No, uncle. lt's been two years now.

1791
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:09,016
She loves you very much.

1792
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:11,180
She doesn't let you down.

1793
01:59:11,845 --> 01:59:13,119
Do you miss her?

1794
01:59:13,747 --> 01:59:15,749
I miss her very much.

1795
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:17,952
But I will be okay.

1796
01:59:19,186 --> 01:59:20,494
I will get over it.

1797
01:59:32,366 --> 01:59:35,506
'I don't Know why,
but I was feeling good about myself.'

1798
01:59:36,203 --> 01:59:40,310
'I was happy helping Ankita's father.'

1799
01:59:44,578 --> 01:59:46,421
Hello. - Hello.
-Tell me.

1800
01:59:47,648 --> 01:59:51,596
I dialed your number my mistake.
- Okay.

1801
01:59:52,152 --> 01:59:53,256
9K8)'-

1802
01:59:54,121 --> 01:59:55,225
9K8)'-

1803
01:59:55,856 --> 01:59:56,960
9K8)'-

1804
01:59:57,358 --> 02:00:00,066
Maybe because I am back in control.

1805
02:00:01,595 --> 02:00:04,508
'Hello. Okay. Okay.'

1806
02:00:05,566 --> 02:00:08,979
He never bothered to talk to me.

1807
02:00:09,136 --> 02:00:10,547
I did apologize.

1808
02:00:10,904 --> 02:00:14,317
I apologized to her and
her father too.

1809
02:00:15,009 --> 02:00:16,682
I guess she wants me..

1810
02:00:17,044 --> 02:00:18,614
...to apologize to her mother and
grandmother too.

1811
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:21,420
Why dicln't you try talking to him?
Tell me.

1812
02:00:21,649 --> 02:00:25,062
If you really love him
you should forgive him.

1813
02:00:26,286 --> 02:00:28,425
You love Santu, don't you?
-Love?

1814
02:00:29,356 --> 02:00:30,733
I am crazy about her.

1815
02:00:30,924 --> 02:00:33,336
Suppose, he apologizes
getting down on his Knees'?

1816
02:00:33,794 --> 02:00:38,243
He's Santu not Vishvvas. -Then hovv
are we going to sought this out?

1817
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:41,505
Then come with me to U.S.
-America! America!

1818
02:00:41,602 --> 02:00:43,912
Everybody in the college
is crazy about America.

1819
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:46,343
MS, visa, passport.

1820
02:00:46,507 --> 02:00:50,353
Finally, Tyson also changed his mind..

1821
02:00:50,577 --> 02:00:52,784
...and thafs because of Shravanti.

1822
02:00:54,781 --> 02:00:56,226
And now the city updates.

1823
02:00:56,283 --> 02:00:59,594
City organization committee
has elected our Santu.

1824
02:00:59,753 --> 02:01:01,130
Congratulations!

1825
02:01:01,255 --> 02:01:05,101
So guys, today's
birthday wishes goes to Kirti.

1826
02:01:05,192 --> 02:01:07,536

1827
02:01:07,661 --> 02:01:09,834
...but tomorrow is a holiday.

1828
02:01:10,064 --> 02:01:13,011
So wish you advance happy birthday.

1829
02:01:41,595 --> 02:01:43,302
'Why isn't she picking the call?'

1830
02:01:45,065 --> 02:01:47,170
'Seems like she forgot
her phone at home.'

1831
02:01:55,576 --> 02:01:59,991
"ls this happening right before me?"

1832
02:02:00,113 --> 02:02:04,584
"My heart stopped beating."

1833
02:02:05,186 --> 02:02:12,729
"I misunderstood my friends."

1834
02:02:13,794 --> 02:02:15,467
"Friendship."

1835
02:02:22,636 --> 02:02:24,479
...is heaven."

1836
02:03:21,395 --> 02:03:23,238
"Forgive me."

1837
02:03:30,104 --> 02:03:31,742
"Forgive me."

1838
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:53,764
This is your RJ, Sangeeta.

1839
02:03:53,894 --> 02:03:57,068
And Ankita will be talking
to you in just a while.

1840
02:03:57,364 --> 02:04:00,038
Meanwhile, enjoy this beautiful song.

1841
02:04:16,383 --> 02:04:18,727
'Then come with me U.S.
- No.'

1842
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:21,933
'First do your exam well.
You'll not get this chance again.'

1843
02:04:22,022 --> 02:04:23,865
'You've scored a good percentage.'

1844
02:04:26,693 --> 02:04:29,333
'I am not interested.
- Why, Santu?'

1845
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:32,704
'Actually, Ankita's family will not
allow her to go to U.S.'

1846
02:04:33,233 --> 02:04:34,769
'She's the only child.'

1847
02:04:34,935 --> 02:04:40,408
'I don't want to create
confusion in her life.'

1848
02:04:41,241 --> 02:04:42,811
'They are so good together.'

1849
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:45,718
'She loves her parents very much.'

1850
02:04:47,481 --> 02:04:51,224
Sangeeta, will you do my program,
please? - Sure.

1851
02:05:01,695 --> 02:05:04,301
<i>Manta, Pandu, Appu, Praveerm.</i>

1852
02:05:04,465 --> 02:05:06,467
...and Vishwas will be the part
of action committee.

1853
02:05:06,633 --> 02:05:08,374
We will have 1O more volunteers.

1854
02:05:15,909 --> 02:05:19,186
Tyson will be HR coordinating
with sponsors and colleges.

1855
02:05:23,917 --> 02:05:26,796
Ankita will be in charge
of college publicity.

1856
02:05:29,923 --> 02:05:31,061
Oh.

1857
02:05:32,226 --> 02:05:34,536
What is it?
- I want to talk to I\/Ir. Santu.

1858
02:05:35,061 --> 02:05:37,234
Later.
- No. Right away.

1859
02:05:37,464 --> 02:05:39,034
Tell me.
- I want a ride.

1860
02:05:39,366 --> 02:05:41,903
Start your bike.
- Are you all right? - Yes.

1861
02:05:43,037 --> 02:05:45,643
Okay. When?
- Right away.

1862
02:05:46,106 --> 02:05:47,414
Are you crazy'?

1863
02:05:47,641 --> 02:05:51,851
I am busy now.
I will talk to you after the meeting.

1864
02:05:52,145 --> 02:05:53,385
Okay?

1865
02:05:54,714 --> 02:05:55,818
Hey, Santu.

1866
02:06:05,592 --> 02:06:07,833
Will you still not come
even if I say I want kiss you?

1867
02:06:09,262 --> 02:06:10,673
"Are you the question?"

1868
02:06:11,098 --> 02:06:12,543
"Are you the answer?"

1869
02:06:12,799 --> 02:06:15,177
"Are you the.."
- Hey, Santu. Congrats.

1870
02:06:18,772 --> 02:06:20,080
Okay. Lefs go.

1871
02:06:21,775 --> 02:06:24,415
It's been two years now.
I was dying.

1872
02:06:24,644 --> 02:06:27,386
It's all because of you.
Aren't you ashamed? - What?

1873
02:06:28,381 --> 02:06:31,089
We neither spent time together..

1874
02:06:31,351 --> 02:06:33,297
...nor spoke about
each other's desires.

1875
02:06:33,387 --> 02:06:35,867
We didn't message nor
write love letters to each other.

1876
02:06:36,022 --> 02:06:37,558
We didn't be together.

1877
02:06:38,392 --> 02:06:40,269
And you straight away talk about kiss.

1878
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,600
How dare you?

1879
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:44,170
Why should I fear you, Ankita?

1880
02:06:44,331 --> 02:06:45,867
I said whatever was on my mind.

1881
02:06:45,999 --> 02:06:47,103
Stop.

1882
02:06:49,002 --> 02:06:52,347
Will you be kissing me
in the public park? -Calm clown.

1883
02:06:53,841 --> 02:06:57,084
Tell me something.
How many faded jeans do you have?

1884
02:06:57,911 --> 02:06:59,720
Just one. - Sure?

1885
02:07:00,013 --> 02:07:04,621
Yes. - Were you wearing the same
jeans the other day?

1886
02:07:05,485 --> 02:07:06,828
I am not sure.

1887
02:07:07,421 --> 02:07:11,267
You may not be sure but I am. Come.

1888
02:07:13,794 --> 02:07:19,767
This is how I'll be reacting
if anybody touches you hereafter.

1889
02:07:20,967 --> 02:07:24,141
The style is pretty good,
but I am feeling cold.

1890
02:07:24,638 --> 02:07:26,845
Why are you legs so thin?

1891
02:07:27,174 --> 02:07:31,418
Since I was wandering about for you
for four years.

1892
02:07:32,512 --> 02:07:38,292
'The final exam came up by the time
I patched up with Ankita.'

1893
02:07:43,957 --> 02:07:47,268
Appu, pass me your answer sheet.
-She's watching us.

1894
02:07:59,106 --> 02:08:01,518
Tell me about yourself.
-My name is Ivlante Linga Swamy, sir.

1895

we don't have a single school..

1897
02:08:05,745 --> 02:08:07,247
...which has a roof or a toilet.

1898

1909
02:08:38,545 --> 02:08:41,355
His communication skills are
poor and English is very weak.

1910
02:08:41,481 --> 02:08:42,960
I can't give him a job.

1911
