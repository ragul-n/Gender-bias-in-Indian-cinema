1
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,104
From North-West of India, nearly 1000 years ago for still unknown reasons,

2
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,983
the gipsies furrowed the roads of Europe, of Egypt, of North Africa.

3
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,820
During this long trip out of the borders of India, the

4
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,616
gipsy terms, halab, Tzigane, gipsy, gypsum… were given to the ROMANIAN people.

5
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:27,796
In the desert, the carriage advances slowly. 

6
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:32,258
It takes me along towards my family. 

7
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,644
To cover my feet of sheets of tree

8
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,654
The bride is beautiful

9
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,016
I have washed the dishes

10
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,614
I have done my bed

11
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,460
only without you? 

12
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,299
It has only you there

13
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:20,181
Oh my eyes 

14
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,433
I cry. 

15
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,684
Dora Gilded, I see your face

16
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,990
Your image

17
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:04,159
Come to see the moon… Come to see the moon!

18
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,244
It is not expensive!

19
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,339
Here, time to live returned. 

20
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:49,676
To live in freedom. 

21
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:26,504
There in Timisoara… 

22
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,721
people go down in the street… 

23
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,567
They shoot at people. 

24
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,208
the mountain is green… 

25
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:32,045
the forest too. 

26
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:36,007
the chance from goes away. 

27
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:20,046
You want that I play the music…

28
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:21,589
for three parts?

29
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,407
the life is so far… 

30
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:43,578
And death if meadows. 

31
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:38,938
God has us condemned with the wandering. 

32
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:48,948
We left very far. 

33
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:06,341
We fled from misery and hatred. 

34
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:50,677
We leave towards Germany… 

35
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:23,626
Towards Germany… 

36
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:30,800
We leave. 

37
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:21,162
like other Gipsies, we are like that, wandering. 

38
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:27,085
Our manner of living, nobody will change it. 

39
01:35:01,409 --> 01:35:04,329
it is to you a stork… 

40
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:59,027
Of Isabelle the Catholic… 

41
01:37:11,539 --> 01:37:13,541
We were victims… 

42
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:43,154
Some evenings… 

43
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:38,209
like many other evenings… 

44
01:38:41,963 --> 01:38:48,303
I find myself envying 

45
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:10,200
the respect you give your dog.
