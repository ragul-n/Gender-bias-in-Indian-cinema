00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
He broke the door and entered.

00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,684
Don't hit me. The Commissioner is
on the line. Listen, talk to him..

4
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,382
My brother-in-law is a minister.
Don't hit me.

5
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:13,230
I say! D.C.P don't dare to hit me.

6
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:15,866
Or else you'll be in big trouble.
Understood?

7
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,608
Have you gone mad D.C.P Bhagat Pandey?

8
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:34,921
I was mad when I wore this uniform and..

9
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,273
...took an oath to perform
my duties sincerely.

10
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,504
Do you know who you arrested?

11
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,840
His brother-in-law is a minister.

12
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:46,622
Hence it took three months
to prepare his file.

13
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,050
But only three hours to arrest him.

14
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:55,235
He'll be out in three minutes
and you'll be helpless.

15
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,036
His file is not in your
Commissioner office or any police station.

16
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,195
It is in the Court.
Tomorrow he'll be in the Court too.

17
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:05,652
From there he'll directly go to jail.

18
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,185
I assure you that no 'Law Agent'
will be able to free him.

19
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:13,107
Mind your tongue. I'm your senior.

20
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,484
If you weren't corrupt and immoral...

21
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:18,214
...then not only would I
have spoken with decorum..

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,492
...but also with respect.

23
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,763
Do you know what the punishment
for such behavior is?

24
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:26,046
I have suffered before.
I'll suffer now, too.

25
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,963
But, after he is punished.

26
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,466

27

like you are either sold or..

28
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:37,576
...just watch the
corruption like a eunuch.

29
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,834
You are handcuffed by
bribes, Commissioner sir.

30
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,216
And you are spreading corruption.

31
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,516
Just shut up!

32
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:48,355
Then I believe I have
traced your weakness.

33
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,104
Yes, he has traced your weakness.

34
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,695
But his pity has saved you.

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Or else, your misbehavior
with the Commissioner..

36
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:59,582
...would have cost your job. Understood?

37
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,721
It's not so easy to sack me.

38
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,132
Yes, I will resign,
if I find it's essential.

39
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,147
Because, I'll not wear
this virtuous uniform..

40
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:10,060
...while massacring traitors like you.

41
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey! Mind your tongue.
My name is Minister Satya Narayan.

42
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,458
I make the Government and
topple the Government too.

43
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:22,509
- You don't know me at all.
- I know you, very well.

44
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,934
When you weren't a minister...

45
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:28,081
...on the footpath,
you used to fix the punctures of cycles.

46
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,520
But now, you are trying
to puncture the Country.

47
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,571
Hey Commissioner!

48
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:37,280
Hasn't your department
taught him etiquette?

49
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,191
Is this the way to speak to a Minister?

50
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,735
Right now, I am not speaking to a minister.

51
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,323
I am speaking to an agent of crime
who has come to free a criminal.

52
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,672
But I'll not leave him.

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,208
You may go now. Allow me to do my work.

54
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,570

55
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:57,601
I'll dismiss and give you a dog's death.
Understood?

56
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:01,264
You uneducated brute!
Know your limits and speak.

I am an I.P.S officer.

58
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,197
You can't dismiss or suspend me.
But can only transfer me.

59
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:11,499
Hence, before I plunge into such
situations I'll be prepared to leave.

- That's good.

00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,022
- What has happened to your hand?
- He has been shot.

174
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,228
Not only his hand, but his leg too.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
- Who did it?
- I did it.

176
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:50,865
You did it?

177
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,399
By the way, who are you to shoot him?

178
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:56,275
Four gangsters killed a
businessman and were fleeing.

179
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,933
But do you have a license for this pistol?

180
00:12:58,103 --> 00:12:59,270
Yes. Shall I show it?

181
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:03,703
Has the Government sanctioned you
to wound such innocent citizens?

182
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,590
He is not an innocent citizen.
He is a gangster.

183
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,998
Really? Do you have proof for it?

184
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:12,618
I'm the A.C.P here and
you are teaching me?

185
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,827
Rane, snatch his pistol
and put him in custody.

186
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,381
I'll tell him what the law is all about..

187
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:18,865
No Rane! Both will be sacked.

188
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:20,834
He is D.C.P Bhagat Pandey.

189
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,000
Sorry, I am sorry, sir.

190
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,346
Go write the report.
She was here to file a complaint.

191
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:35,202

192
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:39,349
In our department we've
snakes like you everywhere.

193
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,996
Don't get scared.
I'll kick you out, at the right time.

194
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,208
Until then put him in the lock up.

195
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,034
And fix an appointment
with Commissioner for me.

196
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,480
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,680
Please, be seated.

198
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:58,778
Would you like to present that
shooter directly in the Court,

199
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:01,268
or prefer to have him in
your custody for a few days?

200
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:03,829
That'll be quite unnecessary, sir.

201
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,773
Half has already been disclosed.

202
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:07,801
Tonight I will find out
whatever is remaining.

203
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,231
- By the way, he was speaking
about some Munna. - Hmmm.

204
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,280
He is Munna.

205
00:14:19,795 --> 00:14:20,995
He is Guru.

206
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,221
They are the underworld's
dons and are good friends.

207
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:30,401
He is Babu Bakshi.
He has the support of M.P Patel.

208
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,031
He is Govind 'Edda'.

209
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,587
He is Minister Bhavani Choudhari's
right hand.

210
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:41,782
Earlier, Bhavani Choudhari and M.P
Patel were in different parties.

211
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,230
But now they are united.

212
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:47,381
Yes. I read that in the newspapers..

213
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:50,228
That M.P Patel gave the
support of 20 M.L.A's..

214
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,445
...and helped Choudhari
to form his government.

215
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:57,698
Babu Bhakshi and Govind 'Edda'
were potent enemies..

216
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:04,027
But as per our information,
they might unify like their leaders.

217
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:07,482
People are thinking that we may unite.

218
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:12,164
But they are unaware that
we are already unified.

219
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,792
We are made for each
other, did you understand?

220
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,318
Pandit, may we know the
reason of your presence?

221
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:24,635
The person whom we had chosen for
Dawoo's place is now against us.

222
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:26,377
Look, leader.

223
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,542
When we needed your support...

224
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,824
...for our advancement,
you didn't support me.

225
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,058
Though they were my enemies...

226
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:37,630
Patel and Parmar,
the parties were different too

227
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:41,255
Then too they supported me with 20 M.L.As..

228
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:44,078
...and helped me to form my government.

229
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:47,939
Hence, I've made him the minister..

230
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:51,585
...and Patel is my favorite.

231
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:55,203
Listen, that Babu Bhaksi is one of my men.

232
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,484
And Govind 'Edda' Mr. Choudhari's man.

233
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,039
Though both are underworld
dons and are potent enemies.

234
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,315
Now that we have united,
even they have to do the same.

"O ant, I am jaggery."

236
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:19,442
"Come to me if you want or I'll leave."

237
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,680
"Hold my fair arms."

238
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:43,918
"Hold my fair arms."

239
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:49,094
"Quit drinking, O drunkard."

240
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,634
Yes, I know that.

241
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:55,649
Hence I am here to settle
the matters regarding Guru.

242
00:16:56,522 --> 00:17:00,434
What I say is..
We politicians think alike..

243
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:04,263
People like you are brainless
with a big sized skull!

244
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,414
It will be very difficult to adjust
with him. He doesn't understand.

245
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:12,445
Like you, we don't get
involved in petty things.

246
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,239
We have our own way of
dealing with things.

247
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,685
That Inspector Sukhdev was against us.

248
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,603
Now he is behind the bars.

249
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,737
Dawoo, tried to compete
with me in the elections.

250
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,184
I sent him to hell.

251
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,157
Now he might be standing
over there for elections.

252
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:30,189
I am little mad.
And my name is Govind Edda.

253
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,583
Who am I?

254
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:32,897
- Govind Eeda.
- Yes.

255
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:34,853
The day you want to execute Guru..
Just tell me.

256
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,420
Give me the commission
and I'll terminate him.

257
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,328
- Because who am I?
- Govind Eeda.

258
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:42,294
Your father is mad. Your grandpa is mad.

259
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,620
- Your entire family is mad!
- Calm down.

260
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:50,157
I agree I am a little mad.
I take a commission to play their game.

261
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,575
People also call me as Don Babu?

262
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:56,744
- The intelligent one.
- You are right.

263
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:01,180
We suspended that Inspector
using his colleagues.

264
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,082
Nowadays we can't trust them too.

265
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,348
If they aren't loyal to
their own department,

266
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:07,631
how'll they be loyal to us?

267
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:11,598
Previously, you favored Guru
and now you want me to kill him?

268
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,506
If you aren't loyal to him,
how can we trust your loyalty to us?

269
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,623
Leaders, like us are like this.

270
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:19,319
Until the person is
advantageous, we use them.

271
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:23,974
And when we find them
unnecessary, we eliminate them.

272
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,738
Remember one day even
you could be useless.

273
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,832
Before I lose control, you better leave.

274
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,174
Let's leave from here. Come on.

275
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,244
Chote, eradicate Guru's shooter tomorrow.

276
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,144
The police will think that he
was shot by Munna or Guru. Okay?

277
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,625
But where?

278
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,881
Tomorrow D.C.P Bhagat is taking
him to the Court. Kill him there.

Have you gone mad? He is Guru's shooter.

Don't shoot him. Shoot randomly.

But when I knew I had to work for you,

298
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,098
I felt very happy and proud about it.

299
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:07,178
- I know.
- Then why is it that...

...an officer like

Our limitations are only
up to a police station.

If the case is subjected to the
Court, nothing is in our hands.

304

has been trapped so well that...

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,988
You'll see the agony and terror.

315
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:12,985
Look deep into her eyes.

316

In case you reveal facts about
your associates, they'll kill you.

then the police may kill you.

Look, this is called mother's love.

327
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:53,353
Just the thought of your
death can kill her mentally.

328
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:57,016
For your wife the thought of being
a widow shivers her to death.

329
00:22:57,603 --> 00:23:00,765
Then, if you really die,
think of their plight.

330
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:03,101
Enough. It's too much.

331
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,224

wrong path, ends up at death's door.

they go to the court thinking
that you can get saved.

337

Sometimes hopes are built or broken.

338

passes away without a solution.

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,136
Now, my head will burst.

343
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:49,909
Sir.

344
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,208
I don't know what bad time that was
when I decided to walk this path.

345
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,074
Please save me, Sir.

346
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:03,881
Help me, sir.

347
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:08,459
Madam, please leave from here.
I'll try my best to save him.

348
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:12,156
If Sir is giving you a chance,
then try your best to change.

349
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,325
- Please take care of him.
- Please don't do all that.

350
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,040
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,874
What do you know about Sukhdev Singh?

352
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:23,562
Everything.

353
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:25,062
Sir,

354
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:28,624
A.C.P. Patil and Rane,
together they trapped him.

355
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:35,120
Minister Bhavani Choudhari, Parmar and
M.P. Patel, they are the mastermind.

356
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,375
Also, Babu Bakshi also has a hand in it.

357
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:43,928
- Even Guru can be involved in this.
- No. Sukhdev wanted to help Guru.

358
00:24:44,572 --> 00:24:46,686
Sukhdev Singh, helping a criminal?

359
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:50,062
Guru wasn't a criminal.
Situations forced him to be a criminal.

360
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:53,221
Guru's father and grandfather
were both great freedom fighters.

361
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:54,741
He's passed M.Sc.

362
00:24:55,085 --> 00:24:56,921
After being so well educated,

363
00:24:57,008 --> 00:25:01,258
his grandfather had to beg in
front of politicians for a job.

364
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:04,783
When he wasn't justified,
he fought for his rights.

365
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,713
Politicians got scared.

366
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,717
Before this also a politician had
an issue with a freedom fighter...

367
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,452
...and he had to lose his position.

368
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,523
Hence the politicians,

369
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,859
with the help of Thadani, compelled
them to sell their property...

370
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:18,007
and shift from Delhi to Mumbai.

371
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,200
You've to take care of her,
as it keeps you away from love tensions.

372
00:25:25,254 --> 00:25:28,734
- What's this?
- She is angry with him.

373
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,774
Hello. My name is Raj Guru.

374
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,011
- Munna. - We've shifted here,
I need your help to shift our things.

375
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,164
Why are you staring at me like this?
Can't you help him?

376
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,955
- Thank you.
- Idiots.

377
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,912
Excuse me. My name is Rajnath Guru.

378
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
- You stay in Shivaji Nagar, right?
- Yes. But how do you know this?

379
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,813
I stay next to your house.

380
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,085
Oh! I see.

381
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:12,288
- How may I help you?
- I want to meet Mr. Thadani.

382
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,388
He is a very busy man.
He won't meet anybody easily.

383
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:19,711
He'll definitely meet me.
Because it was he who called me from Delhi.

384
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:21,288
Okay. I'll talk to him.

385
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:23,121
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

386
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:27,190
- A Mr. Rajnath Guru is here to meet you.
- Rajnath Guru.

387
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:33,104
Who is that Guru? Tell him to phone
beforehand for an appointment.

388
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:38,379
He asked you to phone
and take an appointment.

389
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,694
Please keep these certificates with you.

390
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:42,369
If you get a chance, show it to your boss.

391
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:43,757
- Okay.
- Greetings.

392
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:49,673
I'll go in the evening for it
and I'll join you after that.

393
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:56,948
- How are you, don?
- Why are you calling me a don?

394
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,269
Aren't we friends? Address me as Munna.

395
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:04,021
- He is my friend, Guru.
- Yes. I know.

396
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:06,383
His grandfather is a
great freedom fighter.

397
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,874
- We've met. How are you?
- I am fine.

398
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,147
- I've met him.
- Is that so?

399
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,229
I'll just be back as
I need to make a call.

400
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,040
Where are you going?
Call up from this mobile.

401
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,194
I'll call from the public phone.
Isn't it costlier from here?

402
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:22,360
God has given me everything.
Don't worry. Call up from here.

403
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:25,220
God gave or because you are a don?

404
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,320
It's not easy to be a don.
It's full of tensions.

405
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:34,012
When I'll be a don. I will be
without tension, do you understand?

406
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:36,032
You all will see me that day.

407
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,755
We'll think about it when you are a don.

408
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:39,441
Guru, take this and call now.

409
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:42,952
- Number.
- 4462151.

410
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,660
Hello I am Rajnath Guru speaking.
Can I speak to Mr. Thadani?

411
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,661
What? I'll not get any job?
Try somewhere else?

412
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,438
What happened?

413
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:01,266
He made us sell everything,

414
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,845
and made us shift from Delhi.

415
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:06,054
Now he is telling me,
there's no job for me.

416
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,768
He thinks his father is ruling us?
Give me the phone.

417
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:13,342
- This is the number of that girl.
- Which girl?

418
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,412
Your neighbour.

419
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,296
If possible fall in love with her.

420
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:21,512
She is a very good girl.
And you'll be free of love-tensions.

421
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,799
Hello, Dawoo brother.

422
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,094
Look Thadani, I'm not Dawoo.
I'm Munna here.

423
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,872
You can take a chance with Dawoo
but never with me. Understand?

424
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:34,155
I don't think you know that I know
very influential persons in Delhi.

425
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:38,324
And I know the grim reaper.
Don't try to be too smart.

426
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,580
You called him here and fooling him?

427
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:42,985
I'll send him and better fix
his problem now, immediately.

428
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:46,710
- Understood? Else I'll execute you.
- Okay.

429
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,450
You send him here.

430
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:54,212
You both will forget
each other's friendship..

431
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,511
Hello.

432
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:59,236
- You? Why are you here?
- To meet Mr. Thadani.

433
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:01,324
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Why?

434
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,831
Police are inside. Flee from here.

435
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,795
- Else you'll be arrested.
- Inspector, there he is!

436
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,603
Don't move. Else I'll shoot you. Hands up.

437
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:12,428
Search him.

438
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:22,928
He's clean, sir. He doesn't have anything.

439
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,737
You want money from him?

440
00:29:24,777 --> 00:29:28,221
What are you speaking of?
I am here in search of a job.

441
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,567
He had promised my grandpa.

442
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:34,002
Who is that grandpa?
In which area is he the don?

443
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,566
Not that don, sir.

444
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:38,117
He has promised my grandfather.

445
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:39,869
You are pretending.

446
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:43,594
- Name the don you are working for?
- I don't work for any don.

447
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,709
I stay with my grandparents,
my mother and my sister.

448
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,391
- And nobody else.
- I'll show you. Take him with us. Come on.

449
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,517
He is very innocent.

450
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,073
How do you know him?

451
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,565
He was here before in search of a job...

452
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:07,758
...and he has given his certificates.

453
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,902
He is the son of a freedom fighter.
A martyr's son.

454
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:17,404
If you know about his prior life,
even you'll know he is innocent.

455
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:22,848
Thadani acted as per
some politicians and...

456
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:25,440
...compelled them to come here.

457
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:37,149
- What was the amount he demanded?
- It was 250,000.

458
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:39,534
On the phone you said it was 500,000?

459
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,982
Mr. Sharma, why are you speaking
to him with such utmost respect?

460
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:47,392
Once in a while try speaking
this way even with the poor.

461
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,592
Our department hardly has time
to write a complaint for them.

462
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,959
Call Rajnath Guru.

463
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,019
Please.

464
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:01,286
- Can you please stand up?
- What?

465
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,456
I told you to stand up.

466
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:08,341
Stand like this until
I tell you to sit down.

467
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:16,832
Sit down.

468
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,324
Please forgive me.

469
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,453
I hit you and you were insulted.

470
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:34,654
For the poor,
being insulted is a part of life.

471
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
I can understand your pain.

472
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:41,673
A person who has cleared his
post graduation in first class...

473
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:44,397
...are forced to work
under such brutal people.

474
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,067
Could you be insulted any more than this?

475
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,509
You are insulting me inspector.

476
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:57,486
You are trying to threaten
me with your English words?

477
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:00,031
Hey! Mind you language.

478
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,012
I know very influential people in Delhi.

479
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,574
Lower your voice!

480
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,893
Else I'll put you in the lock-up,
for cheating an innocent person.

481
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:13,738
And regarding the influential
people, I know about it very well.

482
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:18,717
Limit your influence to yourself.
Else it may lead to death.

483
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,008
You both can leave.
I'll leave you till the door.

484
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:30,589
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

485
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:35,616
Again you are silent.
What are you thinking?

486
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:38,732
I am measuring...
The sacrifices of a freedom fighter...

487
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:40,833
...and gratefulness of a politician.

488
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:43,694
Hope you are not thinking about vengeance?

489
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,538
I am not in a position for such things.

490
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,146
My sister's marriage is nearing.

491
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,644
My grandpa thinks that
I am going to office.

492
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,781
And I don't have anything.

493
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,373
- Why don't you tell them the truth?
- What do I gain?

494
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,173
Now I am the only one who is tensed.

495
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,853
Then everyone will be tensed.

496
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:06,901
At least now I can live
with my artificial smile.

497
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:10,078
But he will lose his entire well being.

498
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,442
Yes, you are right.

499
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,020
What will you do when the
day of marriage arrives?

500
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:19,196
Time will answer everything.

501
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:24,097
Festival of lights are celebrated
in bungalows and in slums.

502
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:28,090
If a poor man can earn money
with his sincere efforts...

503
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,377
...one day even he'll
celebrate it very pompously.

504
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:33,561
Similarly when the time arrives...

505
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,008
...my sister's marriage will be performed.

506
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:40,448
Only God knows how and
when it will be done.

507
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:44,863
At any moment in your
life, if you need me...

508

have been sleeping forever.

846
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:26,101
Even today it pains.

847
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:31,018
But I didn't feel so hurt on that day.

848
00:57:32,592 --> 00:57:36,004
When in front of all the villagers
who respected me so much...

849
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:40,955
...an inspector said I was a
thief and made me run naked.

850
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:46,956
They hung me inside a well.

851
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:53,955
But they didn't kill me.
That was their only mistake.

852
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,568
This was the mistake they made.

853
00:57:57,982 --> 00:58:02,285
When I got a chance, I killed them
one by one. This was my mistake.

854
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,713
I killed my cousins in
front of their house.

855
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:10,035
I killed that Inspector
in front of that well.

856
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,326
Then I fled to Mumbai.

857
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:15,246
First I was a small thief,

858
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,549
then hitman and I grew into a don.

859
00:58:19,273 --> 00:58:22,261
They told me that they will
address me as 'Bhai.' I said, no.

860
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:26,353
I was nostalgic about my village.
So I asked them to call me 'Dawoo'.

861
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,954
Because in our village we call
our elder brother as 'Dawoo'.

862
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:36,130
Guru, when I looked into your face...

863
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:41,417
...the teacher who was
sleeping until now, woke up.

864
00:58:43,472 --> 00:58:45,463
You woke him. You!

865
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:54,066
For your sister, your little sister,
I've arranged for the marriage.

866
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:57,021
Do you want to see?
Come along with me. Come with me.

867
00:58:57,322 --> 00:59:00,716
See I have bought all this for her.

868
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,136
Vessels. Clothes. Jewellery.

869
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:05,848
What are you doing?

870
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:10,286
How many times have I told her clothes
and guests stuff should be separate?

871
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,232
These greedy relatives.

872
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:15,454
They come to share joy
as well share sorrow.

873
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:17,539
They attend the wedding too to take gifts.

874
00:59:18,265 --> 00:59:19,790
How many people are you expecting?

875
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:22,757
The marriage party will come from Punjab.
There will be 300 people.

876
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:24,584
300 people. Fine.

877
00:59:24,918 --> 00:59:27,089
300 people.
Why are looking at me like this?

878
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:30,088
Call the manager and ask
him to vacate the rooms.

879
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:31,657
250 people can stay here.

880
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:32,993
For the rest 50 guests
I'll accommodate elsewhere.

881
00:59:33,012 --> 00:59:34,182
I'll arrange everything.

882
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,483
Just check out those.
Is everything proper?

883
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,800
Dawoo.

884
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,367
You called me Dawoo.
I'll not miss your sister's marriage.

885
00:59:43,504 --> 00:59:44,996
Take care of him.

886
00:59:46,228 --> 00:59:47,527
I'll surely come.

Tell me, Rane. Any news.

888
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:56,710
Bhansingh Dawoo and Bakshi
are not on good terms.

889
00:59:58,479 --> 01:00:00,661
Dawoo has a good
reputation with the people.

890
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:06,068
Since he proclaimed that he would compete
in the elections, great leaders are scared.

891
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:08,804
And hence want to kill him immediately.

892
01:00:08,998 --> 01:00:12,197
Today is the right time for this,
as Dawoo will be in Bakshi's area.

893
01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:14,494
- Why?
- To attend a wedding.

01:10:10,084 --> 01:10:11,470
My name is Govind Edda.

1018
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:14,354
Dawoo!

1019
01:10:16,419 --> 01:10:17,540
No, Dawoo!

1020
01:10:20,377 --> 01:10:23,927
Hey Sukhiya! Don't leave them.

1021
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:31,070
- Sukhiya, do you have any spare gun?
- Don't touch guns.

1022
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:36,246
Once you touch them,
you'll never be free from it.

1023
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:39,601
Dawoo! You wanted to fight the elections.

1024
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:41,566
Go to hell and do the same.

1025
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:45,854
- Flee from here! Flee from here!
- No! No!

1026
01:10:46,003 --> 01:10:49,035
Don't be obstinate.

1027
01:10:49,274 --> 01:10:51,733
Hey Dawoo! Why aren't you speaking?

1028
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:54,416
You didn't like Govind edda's bullets?

1029
01:11:01,753 --> 01:11:04,030
Wilson! Tell me where is the spare gun?

1030
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,699
I'll teach that Govind a lesson.

1031
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:08,153
I am out of my bullets.
AK 47 is in the cupboard.

1032
01:11:08,784 --> 01:11:11,422
- You take care of him.
- No! No, Guru!

1033
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:14,359
Don't do that or you'll
become a part of it.

1034
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,008
Munna! Rao!

1035
01:11:27,358 --> 01:11:29,961
Dawoo. Dawoo. Wilson! Get aside.

1036
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,327
We'll do it together. Just tell us where?

1037
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,640
Tell us where we have to go.

1038
01:11:47,912 --> 01:11:49,232
Tell me where.

1039
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:51,027
He'll never tell you.

1040
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,040
Look, don.

1041
01:12:00,228 --> 01:12:02,943
Don't call me don. Address me as Guru.

1042
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:09,061
Because this seat belongs
to a school master.

1043
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,583
And in the Hindi language,
master means 'Guru'.

1044
01:12:12,656 --> 01:12:14,982
All right Guru. Shall we talk business?

1045
01:12:15,657 --> 01:12:17,379
Tell me anything other
than selling this nation.

1046
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,843
We have to kill a contractor.

1047
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:22,570
A tender was passed to build 7 flyovers.

1048
01:12:22,826 --> 01:12:25,056
Prior to the completion of the flyover
you would've built your bungalows.

1049
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,242
Those get built before the file opens.

1050
01:12:28,751 --> 01:12:29,511
Is it so?

1051
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,213
It isn't so, Munna. Raju is joking.

1052
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,269
He is not joking,
he is telling you the facts.

1053
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:39,770
When you know the truth,
why are you arguing?

1054
01:12:40,509 --> 01:12:44,235
Because the contractor has already
given more money than he promised.

1055
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:48,608
He had been here. He has a family.

1056
01:12:48,922 --> 01:12:50,802
If he is killed,
then his children will be orphaned.

1057
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:56,589
In case we take back our support then...

1058
01:12:57,183 --> 01:12:58,699
You'll be an orphan...

1059
01:12:59,144 --> 01:13:01,743
Unreasonably, police
will kill you.

1060
01:13:03,808 --> 01:13:08,125
You are threatening me?
I died the day I sat on this chair.

1061
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:09,589
Look, Guru.

1062
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:14,620
When you killed Govind Edda's men,
then the Minister handled your case.

1063
01:13:14,907 --> 01:13:16,545
That contractor didn't save you.

1064
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:18,020
Kill the contractor!

1065
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:20,481
Why should we fight within
ourselves for a third person?

1066
01:13:20,946 --> 01:13:22,746
Contractor is very sincere.

1067
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:26,769
Minister wants to kill him and
give the contract to someone else.

1068
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:30,197
They'll make money by supplying
the cheapest raw materials.

1069
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,506
Some days later,
the flyover will fall down.

1070
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:34,672
What are you losing anyway?

1071
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:36,917
Innocent people of my
country will be killed.

1072
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:40,954
When you're on the throne of violence,
don't speak about honesty.

1073
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:44,949
Look Singh sir,
circumstances made me a gangster.

1074
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:49,130
- But the patriot is still alive.
- Think about yourself.

1075
01:13:49,385 --> 01:13:51,342
We'll think about the nation.

1076
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,237
Because people have chosen us for it.
Come. Let's leave.

1077
01:13:55,589 --> 01:13:58,695
Don't worry, Singh sir.
We are friends forever.

1078
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,442
Let him calm down,
then we'll do as per your wish.

1079
01:14:02,536 --> 01:14:04,939
Shall I tell you one thing?
Don't feel bad.

1080
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:08,281
My heart says you should have
been there in his position.

1081
01:14:08,307 --> 01:14:09,864
Hey! Leave from here.

1082
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:11,865
Why do you want to spoil friendship?

1083
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:16,319
He is seated there as per our wish.
Understood?

1084
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,984
Circumstances changed a
freedom fighter's grandson...

1085
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:25,950
...from an decent human being
to an underworld don.

1086
01:14:26,577 --> 01:14:29,011
Sir, Sukhdev can be released...

1087
01:14:29,581 --> 01:14:33,994
...if you take Patil and
Rane into your custody.

1088
01:14:38,002 --> 01:14:40,005
- Then what happened?
- Then...

1089
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:45,586
Then Rane, hid those gangsters' guns.

1090
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:47,772
- And I.
- Hmm.

1091
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,918
- You know what I did?
- What?

1092
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:54,166
I proved to those Human
Rights people that...

1093
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,932
...they were innocent
and not the gangsters.

1094
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,327
That did it.

1095
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,533
Great patriot will be either
be jailed for 7 to 8 years...

1096
01:15:05,998 --> 01:15:09,573
...else he'll be treated
as mentally retarded.

1097
01:15:10,647 --> 01:15:16,723
And that too on those people's words
who call themselves Human Rights.

1098
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,425
Did you understand?

1099
01:15:18,502 --> 01:15:21,071
Sir. Sir. This..

1100
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,495
What's it? Why are you roaming like this?

1101
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:30,400
Sir! Champa is making a
video film all about us..

1102
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,519
As per the instructions of
D.C.P. Bhagat Pandey.

1103
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:33,965
- What are you saying?
- Yes sir.

1104
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:35,410
I'll kill you.

1105
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:40,715
Stupid. You betrayed me. I will kill you.
I will kill you. Stupid.

1106
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,640
Oh hello! Come back to your senses, Patil.

1107
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:49,274
Sir you've heard the testimonies
as well as seen the video film.

1108
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:53,650
- Now the judgment is up to you.
- They should be dead.

1109
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:55,864
Even the police wants that.

1110
01:15:55,999 --> 01:15:59,663
But due to the press,
gangsters and murderers have escaped.

1111
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,700
- Yes, he is right. Yes. Yes.
- It happens all the time. Always..

1112
01:16:01,736 --> 01:16:03,183
Order. Order.

1113
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,543
The Court has decided that
Patil and Rane are responsible..

1114
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:15,816
...for entrapping Sukhdev Singh
and also for the shoot out.

1115
01:16:16,818 --> 01:16:18,858
Hence they will be imprisoned for 3 years.

1116
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,960
We release, Sukhdev Singh...

1117
01:16:24,951 --> 01:16:29,338
...son of Jattedar Singh.

1118
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,755
The court is adjourned.

1119
01:16:32,653 --> 01:16:35,722
Come. Let's go.

1120
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,261
It's a right judgement.

1121
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:42,720
Thank you, sir.

1122
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,103
The punishment awarded by
the Court is very less.

1123
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,551
Hence I'll punish you in a way
that your 7 generations will remember.

1124
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,021
Inspector Sukhdev.

1125
01:17:13,335 --> 01:17:16,285
Call me only Sukhdev Singh, Sir.
I'm no longer an Inspector.

1126
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:20,514
I want to give you back the position.

1127
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:25,685
Why?

1128
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,278
I want you to work next to
me to fight corruption.

1129
01:17:31,486 --> 01:17:32,714
As a Government official...

1130
01:17:34,602 --> 01:17:37,213
...dancing to the tunes of politicians?

1131
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:39,529
This service revolver,

1132
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:44,278
Which has to be used with permission and
also every bullet has to be accounted for.

1133
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,338
What have you gained by
wearing this uniform?

1134
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:51,847
When you tried to fight
injustice, you were transferred!

1135
01:17:52,616 --> 01:17:55,907
As per my knowledge, you have been
transferred all over the country.

1136
01:17:56,846 --> 01:18:00,908
But could you ever subdue
the corruption anywhere?

1137
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:03,848
The Commissioner who takes a prompt oath..

1138
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:07,042
...was he ever successful
in eliminating crime?

1139
01:18:07,722 --> 01:18:09,898
But we are not sitting idle too.

1140
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:13,848
Whenever we get a chance
we catch hold of criminals.

1141
01:18:14,179 --> 01:18:16,762
Anyway, I'm not here to share my thoughts,

1142
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:19,722
but I'm here to make you understand
that again today this country

1143
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:22,143
needs Martyrs Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev.

1144
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:25,204
Just because the name matches one
doesn't become a freedom fighter.

1145
01:18:26,246 --> 01:18:27,862
Please don't keep hopes on me.

1146
01:18:27,887 --> 01:18:30,027
I'm fed up with this corruption.

1147
01:18:30,697 --> 01:18:34,260
Though we call our department,
'The protector of Society',

1148
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,454
the corruption begins from there.

1149
01:18:37,262 --> 01:18:40,165
An innocent man is treated
like a dog in the police station.

1150
01:18:40,241 --> 01:18:44,416
Not just the police station,
but any government office.

1151
01:18:44,566 --> 01:18:47,480
Municipal, electricity,
food, water, telephone...

1152
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:52,702
People are harassed and in the
end he himself gets fed up.

1153
01:18:53,839 --> 01:18:58,718
I am telling you to break that
maze in which we all are stuck.

1154
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:01,611
Again, we can attain freedom.

1155
01:19:03,064 --> 01:19:05,029
British ruled us for 200 years.

1156
01:19:05,789 --> 01:19:08,235
And we could expel them.
Then why not this now?

1157
01:19:08,984 --> 01:19:10,966
In fact we are the ones who
gave them that position.

1158
01:19:11,591 --> 01:19:14,131
We can definitely overthrow them.

1159
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:16,791
Being an officer,
we can't achieve all this, sir.

1160
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:20,802
I've tried and what did I get?
Imprisonment!

1161
01:19:21,992 --> 01:19:24,868
To be a Police officer we
have to study for 14 years.

1162
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:27,284
With one year of training
and some years of experience.

1163
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:30,440
What do we get?
An uneducated, ignorant leader?

1164
01:19:30,883 --> 01:19:33,455
Who cheats the public or steals
the election ballet-box..

1165
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:36,264
...and we are ordered to protect him?

1166
01:19:36,614 --> 01:19:38,837
Should I salute him if he comes.
Salute him when he leaves.

1167
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:41,169
We have to salute him all the time.

1168
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:44,898
I am fed up with this.
I'll not salute them any more.

1169
01:19:45,825 --> 01:19:47,964
I want everybody...

1170
01:19:48,003 --> 01:19:52,408
...the police force,
the lawyers and the gangsters to salute me.

1171
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:56,885
Oh! So you wish to plunge
into the underworld?

1172
01:19:57,555 --> 01:20:01,819
I don't wish to, sir.
But I have already decided it.

1173
01:20:02,438 --> 01:20:04,871
If you've already decided,
it's a waste to make you understand.

1174
01:20:05,829 --> 01:20:08,077
But before you leave,
I want to tell you one thing.

1175
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:13,264
Apart from this service revolver,
I have my own private pistol.

1176
01:20:17,364 --> 01:20:20,178
I don't need any permission for this...

1177
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:22,898
...nor the bullets have
to be accounted for.

1178
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:26,271
From today,
one of the bullets will be for you.

1179
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:31,870
If I can release you from
jail, then I can shoot you too.

1180
01:20:37,948 --> 01:20:39,589
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

1181

Same to you.

1224
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:05,633
I used to pray to God for it.
Look it's a super hit.

All right. I am watching T.V.
People are praising your movie.

- Really a good movie.
- Super hit.

Send me at least 20 million.

But, how will I arrange for
such a huge amount, Babu?

01:26:30,331 --> 01:26:33,259
- Don't pretend. Send 20 million.
- I am in great trouble.

Trouble hasn't started yet.
Don't try to be smart...

1234
01:26:37,303 --> 01:26:38,941
...else you and your troubles will
be kicked out of this world. Get it.

1235
01:26:39,102 --> 01:26:40,278
Babu, please.

1236
01:26:40,355 --> 01:26:43,286

- Yes.

So that your death is postponed.

1246
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:21,637
For 200 years,
you were slaves for Britishers.

1247
01:27:22,252 --> 01:27:26,079
That's why the concept
of slavery still exists.

1248
01:27:27,402 --> 01:27:29,462
You fear the threats of gangsters.
You fear them.

01:27:30,014 --> 01:27:33,053
You'll dance to the tunes of politicians.

1250
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:35,775
You cowards why are you still alive?

1251
01:27:38,422 --> 01:27:44,887
You cowards..
Will just dance according to them.

Keep dancing, scoundrels.

Inspector Sukhdev Singh neither
gives bribes nor accepts bribes.

1257
01:28:14,633 --> 01:28:17,743
Then what is this, sir?

1258
01:28:18,644 --> 01:28:21,492
Because I need some information
about the underworld.

1259
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,177
I have heard that underworld Don,

1260
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:31,481
Babu Bakshi has asked film producer
Bajaj to pay him taxes to live?

1261
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:34,357
You've heard it right, sir.

1262
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:41,440
I've already given this news to D.C.P
Bhagat Pandey. Without any bribe.

1263
01:28:41,894 --> 01:28:46,334
Yes, he has even provided two bodyguards.

1264
01:28:48,058 --> 01:28:51,851
But anyway, Bakshi's men will kill them.

1265

- Where?
- Santa Cruz market at 10 a.m.

1266
01:28:57,072 --> 01:28:57,802
Is it accurate?

1267
01:28:57,841 --> 01:29:02,125
People say that a drunkard never lies.

1268
01:29:02,164 --> 01:29:06,369
And I drink all through
the day and night sir.

Rupees 100 fine for drinking and driving.

hence I get concessions.

I'll talk to you later, Doble.

who died belonged to Babu...

are ordinary citizens.

Get aside, sir. Get aside.

1316
01:31:51,809 --> 01:31:53,856
- I'll give you the guarantee
for your life. - Get aside.

and having fun like eunuchs?

Not like eunuchs but like puppets
whose strings are in your hands.

1322

You give birth to such
corrupted, illegitimate youth.

And you blame us for it, either on
the stage or with people like this.

01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:25,723
They are not ordinary citizens,
but are Babu Bakshi's gunmen.

1325
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,927
They had been here to
kill an ordinary man...

1326

...but died, killing each other.

1327

...there's another gangster's
born in the underworld..

Shall I tell you his name?

Inspector Sukhdev Singh.

1331
01:32:37,822 --> 01:32:41,074
- He is no longer in our department.
- Why should I bother about it?

1332
01:32:41,559 --> 01:32:43,316

01:32:43,506 --> 01:32:46,114
You know he is demanding
extortion money from me?

01:32:46,336 --> 01:32:48,391
Lodge a complaint at the police station.

1335
01:32:48,678 --> 01:32:50,389
When we nab him, he'll die like this.

1336
01:32:50,466 --> 01:32:53,695
You're telling me to go to the
police station? Me? M.P. Patel?

1337
01:32:53,772 --> 01:32:55,915
Am I sending you to be arrested?

1338
01:32:56,307 --> 01:32:57,852
I'm sending you to lodge a complaint.

1339
01:32:57,928 --> 01:33:01,961
How can I take an action against
him if you don't lodge a complaint?

1340
01:33:02,038 --> 01:33:06,408
We have to take action.
When I came to know there's a chaos...

1341
01:33:06,561 --> 01:33:08,823
...I came running to perform my duties.

1342
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,435
Good. Then, wait till the
preliminary investigations.

1343
01:33:11,511 --> 01:33:13,959
It will be easier for me to get
shoot out orders against Bakshi.

1344
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:17,769
- Why should I stay?
- Then why did you come here?

1345
01:33:18,165 --> 01:33:22,015
To prove that the police department
is sleeping and you are alert?

1346
01:33:22,191 --> 01:33:25,477
And when we want to alert
you, you want to sleep?

1347
01:33:25,554 --> 01:33:27,321
Better you stay till
preliminary investigation..

1348
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:31,621
...or else you'll prove to the public
that you are Babu Bakshi's man.

1349
01:33:31,987 --> 01:33:34,604
Who says the Babu Bakshi is my man?

1350
01:33:34,808 --> 01:33:37,439
Forget it. Some one just commented on it.

1351
01:33:37,603 --> 01:33:39,581
You just need to sign this.

1352
01:33:41,237 --> 01:33:43,429
How can I sign?

1353
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,664
Better sign it fast or else you'll
have to fight for your life.

1354
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:53,053
At least, give me a pen?

1355
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,760
Yes.

1356
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,957
Yes.

1357
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,640
Thank you.

1358
01:34:01,929 --> 01:34:05,517
Take immediate action
against Sukhdev Singh.

1359
01:34:05,844 --> 01:34:07,499
Or else I'll take action against you.

1360
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,925
We have to take action against both.

1361
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:14,458
Because after this signature,
even Babu Bakshi is your enemy.

1362
01:34:14,673 --> 01:34:17,222
I made you an M.P. from a pick pocketer.

1363
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,979
First I helped you to be a M.L.A, then M.P.

1364
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:20,469
But now you disfavored me?

1365
01:34:20,509 --> 01:34:22,684
- What I am saying is...
- What did he do?

1366
01:34:22,987 --> 01:34:25,081
He signed the papers
for my shoot out...

1367
01:34:25,507 --> 01:34:29,708
- ...in front of that D.C.P.
- Please understand what I say?

1368
01:34:29,965 --> 01:34:32,709
I was surrounded by people
and I was all alone.

1369
01:34:32,786 --> 01:34:34,517
He then compelled me to do it.
Tell me what I should've done?

1370
01:34:34,727 --> 01:34:37,868
Don't worry. I've called that D.C.P.

1371
01:34:38,414 --> 01:34:40,457
- D.C.P is here to meet you.
- There he has come.

1372
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:41,589
Where is he?

1373
01:34:42,634 --> 01:34:43,368
Come.

1374
01:34:43,972 --> 01:34:45,603
How are you D.C.P?

1375
01:34:46,549 --> 01:34:48,080
- Salutations.
- Salutations.

1376
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:49,519
- Is everything fine?
- Yes.

1377
01:34:50,074 --> 01:34:51,279
What would you like to have?

1378
01:34:51,304 --> 01:34:54,111
Whiskey, scotch or rum?

1379
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,802
A glass of water. So that I can
listen to you with a cool mind.

1380
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:01,820
Water will be here in any moment.
But have something.

1381
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:04,596
No. Thank you. Why am I called here?

1382
01:35:05,206 --> 01:35:09,281
It's nothing.
I've spoken to the Home Minister.

1383
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:14,184
We don't have any strong
evidence against Babu Bakshi.

1384
01:35:14,546 --> 01:35:17,332
Hence the shoot out orders are canceled.

1385
01:35:17,882 --> 01:35:23,197
I just called you here to say
that you shouldn't kill him.

1386
01:35:24,612 --> 01:35:27,742
Commissioner already
informed me about this.

1387
01:35:28,346 --> 01:35:30,465
As per the second one...

1388
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,721
...I can't guarantee you anything.

1389
01:35:34,077 --> 01:35:37,362
Because if he or his men try to kill me...

1390
01:35:37,866 --> 01:35:42,622
...I can't stand innocently and
watch their style of shooting?

1391
01:35:43,653 --> 01:35:47,181
But yes, in case you guarantee,
he will not shoot me then...

1392
01:35:47,258 --> 01:35:49,667
- ...I will guarantee.
- Do you know what you are saying?

1393
01:35:49,743 --> 01:35:52,213
- Why?
- You don't have brains.

1394
01:35:52,342 --> 01:35:56,413
How can we guarantee?
Is he our relative or a friend?

1395
01:35:56,489 --> 01:35:59,744
Or do we live with him?

1396
01:35:59,821 --> 01:36:01,396
That's what I thought.

1397
01:36:01,657 --> 01:36:05,717
Even people say this.
Now Patel Sir confirmed it.

1398
01:36:06,128 --> 01:36:10,086
Forget what people say. Do as we say.

1399
01:36:11,018 --> 01:36:14,067
And what I'm saying is, if you obey us..

1400
01:36:14,251 --> 01:36:15,534
...you will prosper.

1401
01:36:15,675 --> 01:36:18,219
No. I mean, you will get promoted for sure.

1402
01:36:18,296 --> 01:36:22,155
So I'm here to save gangsters?

1403
01:36:23,365 --> 01:36:25,244
But the reward for it is very less.

1404
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:30,239
I had told you.. Everything can be bought.

1405
01:36:30,614 --> 01:36:33,659
- Only one should know how to trade.
- You are correct.

1406
01:36:33,735 --> 01:36:37,059
What I want to know is what else
do you need apart from a promotion?

1407
01:36:37,136 --> 01:36:40,691
The way the Britishers quit our country.

1408
01:36:41,149 --> 01:36:43,660
In the same way I want you
all to quit your position.

1409
01:36:44,988 --> 01:36:47,084
What are you saying?

1410
01:36:47,161 --> 01:36:50,848
You know how long we've taken
to be here in this position?

1411
01:36:51,017 --> 01:36:54,710
- We've spent thousands of rupees.
- So that you earn in millions.

1412
01:36:55,146 --> 01:36:57,566
By getting involved in
one scam after another.

1413
01:36:57,643 --> 01:37:00,744
And when nothing will be left
you will indulge in land scam...

1414
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:02,421
...and sell this country.

1415
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:06,628
First you divided into areas.
And now it has spread to villages.

1416
01:37:07,138 --> 01:37:09,186
So that this will ease your trade.

1417
01:37:09,842 --> 01:37:13,798
Name one leader who has done
a useful task for the country.

1418
01:37:14,177 --> 01:37:18,477
Or one who has recognized the
freedom fighters or their families.

1419
01:37:19,221 --> 01:37:23,655
Or who has given his money for
the betterment of those families?

1420
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:26,172
Name at least one?

1421
01:37:27,429 --> 01:37:29,650
What I want to say is, forget this.

1422
01:37:29,979 --> 01:37:32,923
It's impossible for me to
answer these questions.

1423
01:37:33,074 --> 01:37:36,833
If you want an answer come to
Parliament, Choudari will answer.

1424
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:38,831
Why do you want to pull me into this?

1425
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:41,309
Am I the sole one responsible for it?

1426
01:37:41,465 --> 01:37:46,459
- Entire Parliament should answer this.
- Who'll answer me there?

1427
01:37:48,673 --> 01:37:52,715
Still there are people who are
sincere and can't be bought.

1428
01:37:53,113 --> 01:37:57,086
Even I'm one of them. I don't have
any personal grudge against anyone.

1429
01:37:58,348 --> 01:38:01,527
I am against this corrupt system.

1430
01:38:03,141 --> 01:38:07,405
I can resign and kill a minister.

1431
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:11,297
Else I can be on duty and kill Babu Bakshi.

1432
01:38:13,483 --> 01:38:14,771
Hail India!

1433
01:38:21,913 --> 01:38:23,579
- Half kilo sugar..
- Here it is written that..

1434
01:38:23,947 --> 01:38:26,836
- Following are the underworld dons...
- Black lentils.

1435
01:38:26,988 --> 01:38:29,859
Babu Bakshi, Govind Edda, Guru Bhai.

1436
01:38:30,741 --> 01:38:32,526
What did you say? Raj Guru?

1437
01:38:32,982 --> 01:38:34,934
Not Raj Guru.

1438
01:38:35,382 --> 01:38:37,977
It is the news about the
underworld don named Guru.

1439
01:38:38,243 --> 01:38:40,252
- He is not your grandson.
- Yes.

1440
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,880
I'll meet you later.

1441
01:38:42,046 --> 01:38:43,405
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

1442
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:44,814
Shoba, call Kusum.

1443
01:38:46,266 --> 01:38:47,963
I've been waiting for long.

1444
01:38:53,531 --> 01:38:55,947
My parents have fixed my marriage.

1445
01:38:56,252 --> 01:38:58,248
I know. You go inside.

1446
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:00,135
I want to talk to her.

1447
01:39:01,065 --> 01:39:03,112
What will you speak?

1448
01:39:04,289 --> 01:39:07,470
You'll say that the underworld don...

1449
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:11,248
...'Guru' is none other than you?

1450
01:39:12,111 --> 01:39:14,853
The news in the newspaper
is all about you?

1451
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:21,573
Brother, grandpa is very innocent.
But I am not!

1452
01:39:22,377 --> 01:39:25,693
He doesn't know anything.
Nor does mother know about it.

1453
01:39:26,338 --> 01:39:27,915
Grandma is ignorant about it.

1454
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,865
But I know everything.

1455
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,324
If you know, then make her understand.

1456
01:39:32,483 --> 01:39:34,209
What will she make me understand?

1457
01:39:34,461 --> 01:39:36,749
I live in the shadow of death.

1458
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:39,659
That anybody can kill me,
or the police can shoot me.

1459
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,173
But one thing is very clear,
I am not far from death.

1460
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:45,381
I love you.

1461
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,038
My conscious can't bear
to make you a widow.

1462
01:39:50,021 --> 01:39:52,215
So you better get married
as per your parent's wish.

1463
01:39:52,961 --> 01:39:57,834
No. I can't live without you.

1464
01:39:59,188 --> 01:40:00,535
I'll die.

1465
01:40:00,692 --> 01:40:02,711
You are talking about the future.
I am speaking about the present.

1466
01:40:02,954 --> 01:40:05,729
- I'll shoot myself.
- No.

1467
01:40:05,994 --> 01:40:09,244
- Brother - If you want me to
live for some more days...

1468
01:40:10,446 --> 01:40:12,841
...then get married as
per your parent's wish.

1469
01:40:14,495 --> 01:40:17,380
Please. Put down your pistol. Please.

1470
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,047
I'll do as you wish.

1471
01:40:22,918 --> 01:40:25,169
- Brother.
- I'll do as you wish.

1472
01:40:25,943 --> 01:40:29,420
Brother, she loves you a lot.

1473
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:32,021
Hence I'm making her understand.

1474
01:40:33,234 --> 01:40:37,834
You always don't gain in love.
Sometimes you may lose too.

1475
01:40:38,021 --> 01:40:39,617
Take care and forget me.

1476
01:40:40,476 --> 01:40:41,435
Brother..

1477
01:40:41,723 --> 01:40:44,319
Brother, at least tell us...

1478
01:40:44,693 --> 01:40:49,508
...what made you so
helpless as to become a don?

1479
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,561
Some things are better
not to be discussed.

1480
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,840
Brother.

1481
01:41:17,682 --> 01:41:20,745
"He came to me stealthily."

1482
01:41:21,549 --> 01:41:24,701
"He called me from the window."

1483
01:41:25,344 --> 01:41:28,293
"He asked me to go with him."

1484
01:41:29,093 --> 01:41:31,778
"I didn't listen to him."

1485
01:41:32,301 --> 01:41:36,091
"He asked me what was the
program for the weekend."

1486
01:41:36,406 --> 01:41:38,838
"When will spend evening together?"

1487
01:41:38,914 --> 01:41:40,779
"I said."

1488
01:41:42,535 --> 01:41:48,432
"I love only on Sundays."

1489
01:41:49,794 --> 01:41:56,168
"I love only on Sundays."

1490
01:41:57,142 --> 01:42:03,817
"You wait for me only on Sunday."

1491
01:42:05,022 --> 01:42:09,173
"Monday I am very busy."

1492
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:12,610
"I don't get time even for a moment."

1493
01:42:12,687 --> 01:42:16,387
"What do I tell you about
Tuesday and Wednesday?"

1494
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:20,135
"It's really difficult."

1495
01:42:20,507 --> 01:42:24,019
"I'll go to market on
Thursday and Friday."

1496
01:42:24,273 --> 01:42:28,066
"I come home late on Saturday."

1497
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:31,245
"I come late."

1498
01:42:31,498 --> 01:42:33,249
"Because."

1499
01:42:33,869 --> 01:42:39,924
"I agree only on Sundays."

1500
01:42:40,876 --> 01:42:47,522
"You wait for me only on Sunday."

1501
01:43:13,885 --> 01:43:17,437
"I won't enjoy meeting you every day."

1502
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:21,400
"I fear that I may get defamed."

1503
01:43:25,312 --> 01:43:28,865
"I won't enjoy meeting you every day."

1504
01:43:28,905 --> 01:43:32,577
"I fear that I may get defamed."

1505
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,940
"You think about me all the time."

1506
01:43:36,988 --> 01:43:40,351
"You have become crazy."

1507
01:43:40,533 --> 01:43:44,220
"There should be..

1508
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:48,235
...some distance between us."

1509
01:43:50,033 --> 01:43:53,510
"Understand my helplessness."

1510
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:55,424
"Because."

1511
01:43:55,785 --> 01:44:01,949
"I meet only on Sundays."

1512
01:44:02,614 --> 01:44:09,604
"You wait for me only on Sunday."

1513
01:44:26,184 --> 01:44:29,692
"I hid my youth from people for 16 years."

"I will give my youth to the
one who becomes my beloved."

1515
01:44:37,576 --> 01:44:41,074
"I hid my youth from people for 16 years."

1516
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:45,113
"I will give my youth to the
one who becomes my beloved."

1517
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:48,878
"He will get palanquin for me."

1518
01:44:48,994 --> 01:44:52,728
"He will take me along."

1519
01:44:52,878 --> 01:44:56,543
"I won't listen to you."

1520
01:44:56,620 --> 01:45:01,021
"I won't give my hand to you."

1521
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:05,579
"Listen to me, O beloved."

1522
01:45:05,728 --> 01:45:07,461
"Because."

1523
01:45:07,855 --> 01:45:14,346
"I fall in love only on Sunday."

1524
01:45:15,098 --> 01:45:21,741
"You wait for me only on Sunday."

1525
01:45:23,182 --> 01:45:26,820
"Monday I am very busy."

1526
01:45:26,969 --> 01:45:30,607
"I don't get time even for a moment."

1527
01:45:30,724 --> 01:45:34,328
"What do I tell you about
Tuesday and Wednesday?"

1528
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:38,210
"It's really difficult."

1529
01:45:38,522 --> 01:45:42,265
"I'll go to market on
Thursday and Friday."

1530
01:45:42,342 --> 01:45:46,065
"I come home late on Saturday."

1531
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:49,857
"I come late."

1532
01:45:51,365 --> 01:45:57,842
"I agree only on Sundays."

1533
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:05,690
"You wait for me only on Sunday."

[WHISTLING]

1535
01:46:33,149 --> 01:46:34,495
- Where are you taking me.
- Come on. Come on.

1536
01:46:35,587 --> 01:46:37,264
Come, come, come. Move.

1537
01:46:37,573 --> 01:46:39,227
Daniya, get the flowers here.

1538
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:42,235
- Hold this.
- What's this for?

1539
01:46:42,347 --> 01:46:44,126
There's the solution
for your love-problems.

1540
01:46:44,366 --> 01:46:48,303
Hence I brought you here.
The medicine is inside. Go inside.

1541
01:46:53,605 --> 01:46:57,577
I am sorry. My friends pushed me.
I didn't come here by myself.

1542
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:01,775
You haven't come.
You have fallen here with the bouquet!

1543
01:47:03,143 --> 01:47:05,942
- Even this is their mischief. Forgive me.
- Is it so?

1544
01:47:06,945 --> 01:47:09,065
Please, be seated.

1545
01:47:10,373 --> 01:47:11,373
Why are you so scared?

1546
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:16,008
I agree they pushed me
in, but it was insolence.

1547
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:18,040
But yet you are so courteous?

1548
01:47:19,868 --> 01:47:22,723
You are the first man who
is so well-behaved with me.

1549
01:47:24,074 --> 01:47:27,112
Other people come here,
with lust filled eyes...

1550
01:47:27,814 --> 01:47:29,794
...or to satisfy their lust.

1551
01:47:30,776 --> 01:47:36,862
They kill me with their obscene looks.

1552
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,848
But today, for the first time...

1553
01:47:42,586 --> 01:47:44,346
...in your eyes I can see a respect for me.

1554
01:47:45,432 --> 01:47:47,155
I respect women a lot.

1555
01:47:48,091 --> 01:47:51,853
If I give you lustful looks,
then I'll be unable to forgive myself.

1556
01:47:53,404 --> 01:47:57,385
All of us have such helplessness
that forces them to do things.

1557
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:00,659
Even you would have been helpless once,

1558
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,703
which persuaded you to be here.

1559
01:48:03,988 --> 01:48:05,548
Where I have to sell myself!

1560
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,080
You can also say you are
presenting your talent.

1561
01:48:09,114 --> 01:48:10,162
You say that.

1562
01:48:10,944 --> 01:48:13,100
People call me a bar dancer.

1563
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:17,988
Even when I used to dance in the beer bar.

1564
01:48:18,522 --> 01:48:22,783
Now when I am on the stage,
people still call me the same.

1565
01:48:23,241 --> 01:48:25,954
This world is a theater.
Here everybody is dancing.

1566
01:48:26,521 --> 01:48:29,837
Even I am dancing.
But I don't look like that.

1567
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:33,703
Life is making me dance in such a way...

1568
01:48:34,297 --> 01:48:35,608
...that this dance has no end.

1569
01:48:36,029 --> 01:48:37,802
Then we are sailing in the same boat.

1570
01:48:38,465 --> 01:48:42,403
Why don't we sail together for
sometime in this sea of life?

1571
01:48:42,442 --> 01:48:43,799
This is not possible.

1572
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,534
Do you know that I am black listed.

1573
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:52,687
I know. Your name is Rajnath Guru.
People call you 'Guru'.

1574
01:48:52,763 --> 01:48:55,084
Yet you want to walk with me?

1575
01:48:55,633 --> 01:48:58,858
After knowing that death
is not far from me?

1576
01:48:59,128 --> 01:49:03,077
I don't fear death.
Because I am not alive.

1577
01:49:03,821 --> 01:49:07,938
I died on that day when situations
forced me to be a dancer.

1578
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:12,500
- I know all about you.
- And I know about you.

1579
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:15,877
I didn't receive any invitation
card for Kusum's marriage.

1580
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:21,329
But I got the news that
you persuaded her to marry.

1581
01:49:22,236 --> 01:49:25,549
We'll not gain anything by
speaking about the past life.

1582
01:49:26,212 --> 01:49:29,226
- I am leaving.
- When will we meet again?

1583
01:49:30,261 --> 01:49:33,300
Never! It's better you stay away from me.

1584
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:37,820
Because the life that I am leading
has no place for sympathy or love.

1585
01:49:38,434 --> 01:49:39,921
At least give me those flowers.

1586
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:43,916
I am asking your forgiveness
for my friend's mischief.

1587
01:49:47,488 --> 01:49:48,991
Your friend is better than you.

1588
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:53,332
At least they do mistakes.
You don't make mistakes, even by mistake.

1589
01:49:54,106 --> 01:49:55,358
How are you, Doble?

1590
01:49:56,871 --> 01:50:00,062
Sir, you didn't get any bottles for me?

1591
01:50:03,994 --> 01:50:07,556
- Why don't you stop drinking?
- Then I'll be lifeless.

1592
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,601
If you want me to give the information...

1593
01:50:12,778 --> 01:50:14,338
...then you need to buy me alcohol always.

1594
01:50:20,794 --> 01:50:24,831
Don. The thing is that...

1595
01:50:25,799 --> 01:50:28,227
...Babu Bakshi has already
transferred this hotel in his name.

1596
01:50:28,743 --> 01:50:31,107
Now if I give away my land to you...

1597
01:50:31,692 --> 01:50:35,000
- ...then what will I have?
- Your life.

1598
01:50:36,038 --> 01:50:41,492
But Minister Choudhari told us,
that we give the hotel to Bakshi,

1599
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:44,584
- Then they'll never trouble us.
- Yes, that is right.

1600
01:50:44,949 --> 01:50:46,384
Yes Don.

1601
01:50:53,517 --> 01:50:56,347
I don't speak to kids. I am a bit crazy.

1602
01:50:57,206 --> 01:50:58,243
Hey!

1603
01:50:59,889 --> 01:51:04,059
I wanted the hotel, but Babu took it.

1604
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:06,250
Minister came between us..

1605
01:51:06,606 --> 01:51:07,630
Babu is my friend.

1606
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:10,842
Now the same Minister is
telling me to take the land.

1607
01:51:10,986 --> 01:51:13,098
Why? You didn't receive any phone calls?

1608
01:51:13,989 --> 01:51:15,668
- Yes, he had called me. Yes.
- Is it so?

1609
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,049
I tried to make him understand.

1610
01:51:17,097 --> 01:51:18,137
Don't make me understand.

1611
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:20,280
[GLASS BREAK]

1612
01:51:26,303 --> 01:51:31,289
- Sign it. I am a bit crazy.
- I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

1613
01:51:31,766 --> 01:51:34,984
- Govind Edda. Who am I?
- Give me the pen. I'll do it.

1614
01:51:35,241 --> 01:51:35,905
I'll do it.

1615
01:51:42,253 --> 01:51:44,173
I thought my head was shot.

1616
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:47,167
You saved me. But why did you leave him?

1617
01:51:47,202 --> 01:51:49,993
- Why didn't you kill him?
- What's the urgency?

1618
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:53,990
He has acquired a lot
of money from others.

1619
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:55,033
Yes.

1620
01:51:55,072 --> 01:51:57,447
Now I will extort money from
him as a tax for his life.

1621
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:03,651
I got the news that Babu Bakshi
also had to be here with him.

1622
01:52:04,085 --> 01:52:09,839
That is perfectly right.
In the end, Minister Bhavani changed it.

1623
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:14,931
They'll have to change
their plans very frequently.

1624
01:52:16,109 --> 01:52:18,270
Because I'll be the only underworld don.

1625
01:52:18,309 --> 01:52:19,775
And that is Sukhdev Singh.

1626
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:23,428
If you want, we can help you.

1627
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:29,468
Because to stabilize this world
we need help from criminals.

1628
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:31,487
Yes, I know.

1629
01:52:31,611 --> 01:52:36,163
All these petty dons are
alive because of him.

1630
01:52:37,531 --> 01:52:41,139
Since I want to meet him,
I am doing all this.

1631
01:52:41,931 --> 01:52:44,771
- If you want we'll..
- Don't call me don.

Sukhdev Singh Encounter.

1633
01:52:50,126 --> 01:52:54,027
Sukhdev Singh, if you want,
I'll arrange for a meeting...

1634
01:52:54,357 --> 01:52:58,097
...with an opposition leader.
His name is Yadav.

1635
01:52:58,350 --> 01:53:01,929
Jumani, you were trapped by those people...

1636
01:53:02,332 --> 01:53:04,056
...who've always misused you.

1637
01:53:04,582 --> 01:53:06,988
But you have come to the right place.

1638
01:53:07,441 --> 01:53:10,486
And, you brought the right person.

1639
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:16,063
If he works hand-in-hand then I'll
put an end to all those traitors.

1640
01:53:16,985 --> 01:53:19,205
I think I am at the wrong place.

1641
01:53:21,274 --> 01:53:24,775
If I wanted to serve the country, I
could've been with D.C.P. Bhagat Pandey.

1642
01:53:26,067 --> 01:53:27,762
I have done enough for this Country.

1643
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:33,811
Now I am here to earn name
and fame in the underworld..

1644
01:53:36,218 --> 01:53:40,265
Maybe you aren't in the position
to help me and yourself.

1645
01:53:40,776 --> 01:53:43,852
I know I'm not in the ruling party,
but I'm in the opposition party.

1646
01:53:44,144 --> 01:53:47,362
A dead elephant is never of no use.

1647
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:49,999
Similarly,
a defeated leader is never weak.

1648
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:52,164
Have a look at these cassettes.

1649
01:53:53,148 --> 01:53:54,493
Have a look at these cassettes.

1650
01:53:55,211 --> 01:54:00,494
These contain such information
which can destroy them fully.

1651
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,373
I'm just waiting for the right opportunity.

1652
01:54:03,857 --> 01:54:06,227
I think I am at the right place.

1653
01:54:08,549 --> 01:54:11,807
Nobody can stop me to
reach my destiny now.

1654
01:54:12,538 --> 01:54:15,254
Munna, demand 2.5 million
from that builder.

1655
01:54:17,336 --> 01:54:20,133
- You?
- I'm seeking your help.

1656
01:54:20,694 --> 01:54:21,792
Tell me.

1657
01:54:22,072 --> 01:54:26,005
I've fulfilled every demand of the
dons because of my helplessness.

1658
01:54:27,331 --> 01:54:30,594
- Especially Govind.
- Yes.

1659
01:54:31,499 --> 01:54:34,015
But now they want my body too.

1660
01:54:35,563 --> 01:54:37,363
If I reject them,
it is nothing but suicide.

1661
01:54:38,303 --> 01:54:40,415
My circumstances don't permit me.

1662
01:54:42,258 --> 01:54:45,325
My consciousness doesn't permit
me to be nude in front of them..

1663
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:48,013
You can go home and relax.

1664
01:54:48,232 --> 01:54:51,257
If he wants to live then he'll
never make any such demands.

1665
01:54:57,249 --> 01:55:01,022
Govind. Me and my friends are hunting you.

1666
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,025
But I want to give you another chance.

1667
01:55:04,066 --> 01:55:08,415
Why do you speak of a chance?
Just kill him!

1668
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:13,911
Did you hear what Munna said?
Come with me.

1669
01:55:14,977 --> 01:55:17,137
If you try to trouble Shweta again,

1670
01:55:18,039 --> 01:55:20,768
then nobody can save you.

1671
01:55:43,155 --> 01:55:44,500
I was really foolish.

1672
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:47,246
Where is Guru?

1673
01:55:48,025 --> 01:55:49,573
That way.

1674
01:55:57,597 --> 01:55:58,869
Munna.

1675
01:56:04,283 --> 01:56:06,000
Get out from here, fast.

1676
01:56:06,949 --> 01:56:11,272
- You are running away?
- Let's go Munna. Let's go.

1677
01:56:18,943 --> 01:56:23,248
Look, our friends are being cremated.

1678
01:56:25,012 --> 01:56:26,412
We can't even go near them.

1679
01:56:28,728 --> 01:56:30,542
Asif would've been buried over there.

1680
01:56:31,434 --> 01:56:35,369
And we can't be near them.
And we call ourselves 'brother'?

1681
01:56:36,182 --> 01:56:40,572
You are right.
When my mother was being cremated..

1682
01:56:41,449 --> 01:56:45,276
I was watching it from far.
Like an eunuch.

1683
01:56:46,435 --> 01:56:48,636
I was responsible for his death.

1684
01:56:49,029 --> 01:56:51,010
Why do you blame yourself?

1685
01:56:51,729 --> 01:56:55,234
Death claims everybody.
It just needs a reason.

1686
01:56:56,539 --> 01:57:01,518
You accepted this kind
of life to kill poverty.

1687
01:57:01,594 --> 01:57:02,855
And I killed her!

1688
01:57:03,802 --> 01:57:06,154
I have everything today..

1689
01:57:06,801 --> 01:57:10,539
But I don't have my mother,
for who I did all this.

1690
01:57:11,321 --> 01:57:16,513
Let's move. Before this fire
burns our remaining happiness.

1691
01:57:17,069 --> 01:57:18,999
Let's leave. Come.

1692
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:41,706
"I love you..

1693
01:57:41,747 --> 01:57:48,179
...but I don't trust you."

1694
01:57:54,881 --> 01:58:01,512
"I love you.."

1695
01:58:01,558 --> 01:58:07,994
"I love you..

1696
01:58:08,033 --> 01:58:14,484
...but I don't trust you."

1697
01:58:14,666 --> 01:58:21,124
"I have love for you in my eyes."

1698
01:58:21,249 --> 01:58:27,651
"I have love for you in my eyes."

1699
01:58:27,788 --> 01:58:34,395
"..but I don't trust you."

1700
01:58:50,825 --> 01:58:57,369
"Love is two-sided..

1701
01:58:57,408 --> 01:59:04,630
...but I think only I love you."

1702
01:59:10,505 --> 01:59:16,979
"Affection is two-sided..

1703
01:59:17,123 --> 01:59:23,750
...how can I tell you?"

1704
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:30,247
"I love you sincerely."

1705
01:59:30,286 --> 01:59:36,730
"I love you sincerely."

1706
01:59:36,896 --> 01:59:43,348
"But I don't trust you."

1707
01:59:43,387 --> 01:59:49,595
"I have love for you in my eyes..

1708
01:59:50,009 --> 01:59:56,723
...but there's trust for life."

1709
02:00:16,379 --> 02:00:22,952
"How can anyone guard memories?"

1710
02:00:23,077 --> 02:00:30,221
"I couldn't forget you
even if I wished to."

1711
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:42,561
"Dear, my feelings say..

1712
02:00:42,765 --> 02:00:49,282
...I wish I embrace you."

1713
02:00:49,321 --> 02:00:55,752
"I ask you in prayers."

1714
02:00:55,791 --> 02:01:02,379
"I ask you in prayers..

1715
02:01:02,456 --> 02:01:08,843
...but I don't trust you."

1716
02:01:08,936 --> 02:01:15,234
"I have love for you in my eyes..

1717
02:01:15,593 --> 02:01:22,076
...but there's trust for life."

1718
02:01:22,323 --> 02:01:28,632
"I love you.."

1719
02:01:28,835 --> 02:01:35,389
"I love you..

1720
02:01:35,429 --> 02:01:41,159
...but I don't trust you."

1721
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:45,442
Today's headlines. A witness is
in court against Munna and Guru.

1722
02:01:45,482 --> 02:01:48,580
They could be arrested
any time by D.C.P. Bhagat Singh.

1723
02:01:51,556 --> 02:01:53,554
- Greetings grandfather.
- God bless you, son.

1724
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:56,774
Why do you use the back door nowadays?

1725
02:01:56,814 --> 02:01:58,068
Actually, grandpa..

1726
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:00,918
He would have been settling
some matters with our servants.

1727
02:02:00,987 --> 02:02:04,173
I am not speaking only about today.
It's almost every day.

1728
02:02:04,749 --> 02:02:06,462
Mother and grandma are not to be seen.

1729
02:02:06,793 --> 02:02:08,903
They have gone to the temple.
They will be here any minute.

1730
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,701
When did you come from
your in-law's house.

1731
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:12,421
After reading this.

1732
02:02:14,281 --> 02:02:17,049
- Did you read this?
- Listen, have an eye outside.

1733
02:02:18,486 --> 02:02:19,089
Understood.

1734
02:02:19,128 --> 02:02:21,833
- What are you both whispering?
- It's nothing grandpa.

1735
02:02:22,988 --> 02:02:23,786
Fine.

1736
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,785
Grandpa I was thinking,
now that she is married...

1737
02:02:34,259 --> 02:02:36,409
...and we have enough money.

1738
02:02:37,237 --> 02:02:40,444
Though the house in Delhi is no longer
ours, we've one in Punjab.

1739
02:02:41,474 --> 02:02:43,275
It was at the tip of my tongue.

1740
02:02:43,503 --> 02:02:46,492
Even I am fed up with this busy life here.

1741
02:02:46,614 --> 02:02:49,214
I was also thinking of
going back to our village.

1742
02:02:49,992 --> 02:02:50,823
Your job?

1743
02:02:51,815 --> 02:02:53,417
It has served it's purpose.

1744
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:57,223
With this money we'll do some farming.

1745
02:03:00,252 --> 02:03:01,531
They have arrived..

1746
02:03:02,711 --> 02:03:03,250
Who?

1747
02:03:03,289 --> 02:03:06,663
- Brother, run..
- Come on! Let's leave by the back door.

1748
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,157
So you are the don 'Guru'?

1749
02:03:19,893 --> 02:03:23,047
My Raj Guru has become an underworld don.

1750
02:03:24,853 --> 02:03:26,961
You have broken my dreams into pieces.

1751
02:03:27,418 --> 02:03:32,142
But why? What did I ask from you,
that you had to do this?

1752
02:03:32,746 --> 02:03:35,239
I was happy as a poor man.

1753
02:03:36,630 --> 02:03:39,202
- Run brother.
- From whom all will you run?

1754
02:03:39,965 --> 02:03:44,866
Me? You? Police?
Can you run from yourself?

1755
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:50,442
You shed a lot of blood.
Today I'll kill you.

1756
02:03:50,612 --> 02:03:53,306
You have played enough with this.
I'll shoot you.

1757
02:03:53,345 --> 02:03:57,997
- You'll shoot me?
- Why can't I? You've already killed me.

1758
02:03:58,470 --> 02:04:02,264
My principles, culture,
thoughts everything you've murdered.

1759
02:04:02,682 --> 02:04:04,138
Mr. Dinanath please open the door.

1760
02:04:04,215 --> 02:04:07,930
- I'll kill you.
- Let's go. Come.

1761
02:04:08,082 --> 02:04:10,046
Wait. Wait.

1762
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:14,855
Sir, he fled from the back door.

1763
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:17,710
Come.

1764
02:05:15,433 --> 02:05:16,995
[FOOTSTEPS]

1765
02:05:21,172 --> 02:05:24,090
- Get the gun.
- What are you doing?

1766
02:05:24,542 --> 02:05:26,678
I'll take care of them.
Leave this, get inside.

1767
02:05:26,718 --> 02:05:27,969
What are you saying? Have you gone mad?

1768
02:05:28,008 --> 02:05:29,887
Don't make me. Understand.

1769
02:05:30,031 --> 02:05:34,277
I've promised Dawoo.
You've a family and a future. Now leave.

1770
02:05:34,316 --> 02:05:37,226
Go now. I said I will handle this.

1771
02:05:37,303 --> 02:05:40,743
Munna has seen all this.
Now you leave. Now you leave.

1772
02:05:40,917 --> 02:05:46,026
You take him away. Make him understand.
I will take care of it.

1773
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:50,308
- I am here.
- Come with us.

1774
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:51,683
Fire!

1775
02:05:56,018 --> 02:05:57,233
Oh, God.

1776
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:17,160
Why are you shooting here? Shoot here.

1777
02:06:18,373 --> 02:06:19,210
Shoot here.

1778
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,311
This was done to save Guru.

1779
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:38,224
I had to die long ago.

1780
02:06:39,352 --> 02:06:43,395
Today I'm dressed for the right occasion...

1781
02:06:57,174 --> 02:06:59,633
Dinya don,
you're fleeing from the police?

1782
02:06:59,673 --> 02:07:00,793
Don't call me don.

1783
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:06,106
- I beg of you. Don't call me as don.
- Don, what happened?

1784
02:07:07,913 --> 02:07:11,064
- Are you going out?
- Don't call me brother.

1785
02:07:11,936 --> 02:07:15,482
You are my brother.
Else should I call you uncle?

1786
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:18,221
People have spoilt the word 'bhai'

1787
02:07:18,685 --> 02:07:23,108
Even if my sister calls me
'bhai' my breathing ceases.

1788
02:07:23,839 --> 02:07:27,200
He could have been helpless grandfather.

1789
02:07:27,832 --> 02:07:32,768
Yes, dear.
We poor people are always helpless.

1790
02:07:34,263 --> 02:07:41,024
Sometimes this helplessness puts us
in debts or makes us lose respect.

1791
02:07:41,548 --> 02:07:47,153
That doesn't mean we've to forget
our principles and aim in life.

1792
02:07:48,405 --> 02:07:51,956
We shouldn't forget the culture which
has been inherited from our ancestors.

1793
02:07:52,865 --> 02:07:55,944
If every helpless person turns to violence,

1794
02:07:56,521 --> 02:07:59,887
then one day this world will
be filled with dead bodies.

1795
02:08:04,304 --> 02:08:05,823
Why did you stop?

1796
02:08:06,610 --> 02:08:10,803
You couldn't arrest him,
instead of him arrest me.

1797
02:08:13,324 --> 02:08:16,228
I am here to enquire about some things.

1798
02:08:17,995 --> 02:08:21,257
After hearing your words,
I felt I'm in the wrong place.

1799
02:08:21,441 --> 02:08:24,832
No. You are in the right place.

1800
02:08:25,278 --> 02:08:26,993
You're in the right place.

1801
02:08:27,723 --> 02:08:31,763
That idiot is my grandson.

1802
02:08:33,081 --> 02:08:38,835
I didn't even expect that he
would be a part of this corruption.

1803
02:08:39,464 --> 02:08:41,750
I tried to eliminate him,

1804
02:08:41,965 --> 02:08:45,892
but nothing happened!

1805
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:49,524
Why couldn't I shoot?
Why couldn't I shoot?

1806
02:08:49,827 --> 02:08:54,059
To use this, first you need
to unlock this. Like this.

1807
02:08:58,343 --> 02:09:00,167
We were five  brothers.

1808
02:09:01,579 --> 02:09:05,385
Two died like Bhagat Singh.

1809
02:09:06,454 --> 02:09:09,841
Another two went along
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

1810
02:09:10,533 --> 02:09:15,586
They were lucky not to see
the state of our Country.

1811
02:09:16,932 --> 02:09:19,904
I was with Gandhiji. I was saved.

1812
02:09:20,129 --> 02:09:22,611
And I am forced to see all this.

1813
02:09:23,449 --> 02:09:26,830
But now, this non-violence follower,

1814
02:09:27,150 --> 02:09:31,239
will walk the path of Netaji Subhash
Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh.

1815
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:36,665
- Now, all of you better leave.
- No one should use their weapons.

1816
02:09:37,812 --> 02:09:41,840
He is a freedom fighter.
Now he is speaking in anger.

1817
02:09:44,194 --> 02:09:46,533
I can understand your outrage.

1818
02:09:47,035 --> 02:09:48,089
Control yourself.

1819
02:09:48,807 --> 02:09:51,751
When you calm down,
please visit the police station with this.

1820
02:09:53,266 --> 02:09:54,116
Come.

1821
02:09:55,538 --> 02:10:01,455
Minister, will you listen to me?
Try to free that Patil and Rane.

1822
02:10:01,495 --> 02:10:05,056
Shut up. Let me hear what D.C.P is saying.

1823
02:10:05,346 --> 02:10:08,390
Our leaders try to encourage
petty thieves,

1824
02:10:08,667 --> 02:10:13,389
or helpless people and
make them underworld dons.

1825
02:10:13,568 --> 02:10:16,083
Later he'll be either
killed or may go to jail.

1826
02:10:16,293 --> 02:10:19,823
Or he'll be forced to
flee from his house.

1827
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:24,923
To a place where he has
everything but still has nothing.

1828
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:28,713
I made this concept clear
for Babu Baksi and Govind.

1829
02:10:29,098 --> 02:10:32,461
They agreed to reveal the names
of the leaders supporting them.

1830
02:10:32,611 --> 02:10:34,159
Did you hear that?

1831
02:10:34,938 --> 02:10:38,287
My men are speaking against me.

1832
02:10:40,066 --> 02:10:41,519
But you don't worry.

1833
02:10:42,309 --> 02:10:45,999
I'll call Balvinder Singh from
Haryana to kill these two.

1834
02:10:46,012 --> 02:10:47,855
Govind and Babu.

1835
02:10:48,578 --> 02:10:53,692
We'll tell them that no don
is greater than a politician.

1836
02:10:53,943 --> 02:10:57,916
By the time Balvinder Singh arrives here,

1837
02:10:58,483 --> 02:11:02,142
the DCP would've killed us.

1838
02:11:02,218 --> 02:11:04,453
It won't happen. I've called Yadav here.

1839
02:11:04,574 --> 02:11:05,893
- Yadav?
- Yes.

1840
02:11:06,353 --> 02:11:08,622
But he is from our opposite party.

1841
02:11:08,698 --> 02:11:10,122
He is from the opposition,

1842
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:11,977
not from the police or public.

1843
02:11:12,551 --> 02:11:15,832
Sometimes both ruling party and
opposition party will be at par.

1844
02:11:16,045 --> 02:11:18,651
Didn't understand?
We are people who think alike.

1845
02:11:18,994 --> 02:11:22,358
- Sir. Yadav is here.
- Hail India brothers.

1846
02:11:22,514 --> 02:11:23,616

02:23:35,658 --> 02:23:39,755
A 'General' is a person from the military.

2014
02:23:39,899 --> 02:23:44,385
In our military? We'll trap him
in a false case and suspend him.

2015
02:23:44,537 --> 02:23:48,806
He is speaking about that Dyer,
who was killed by Udam Singh.

2016
02:23:48,974 --> 02:23:52,469
Udam Singh. I've heard this name before..

2017
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:54,268
Is he from our Country?

2018
02:23:54,366 --> 02:23:55,163
Yes.

2019
02:23:56,569 --> 02:24:00,491
And Bhagat Pandey also patriot
who is walking the same path.

2020
02:24:00,959 --> 02:24:04,252
And I fear that he may shoot you.

2021
02:24:04,450 --> 02:24:08,080
You must tell me this beforehand.
Because I want to live.

2022
02:24:08,157 --> 02:24:11,164
Only if I let you live.

2023
02:24:11,522 --> 02:24:14,831
Remember once I had told you...

2024
02:24:15,551 --> 02:24:19,546
...that I'll remove this
uniform when necessary?

2025
02:24:20,851 --> 02:24:24,111
To be an officer, we've to study so much.

2026
02:24:25,027 --> 02:24:28,777
But only with speeches and
lies you get the position.

2027
02:24:28,941 --> 02:24:34,432
And for that you demolish mosques and in
the name of temples you create revolts.

2028
02:24:35,771 --> 02:24:38,591
British divided this country into 2 parts.

2029
02:24:38,878 --> 02:24:42,452
But people like you broke
our country into pieces.

2030
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:47,790
In the name of caste, creed, culture.
You bring chaos.

2031
02:24:48,933 --> 02:24:51,543
You make officers like
us become your puppets.

2032
02:24:51,676 --> 02:24:54,111
Commissioner. Why are you standing
and staring at me? Arrest him.

2033
02:24:54,188 --> 02:24:59,698
I'll do it. Definetly. After his
goals as a patriot are accomplished.

2034
02:25:13,861 --> 02:25:15,955
You can't escape.

2035
02:25:29,236 --> 02:25:32,222
You were saying that you had
joined our brotherhood.

2036
02:25:32,535 --> 02:25:34,685
Brotherhood exists between
friends or brothers!

2037
02:25:36,047 --> 02:25:40,870
But you are people who sell
your country for your position.

2038
02:25:41,548 --> 02:25:43,596
At the border soldiers sacrifice
their lives to save us.

2039
02:25:43,673 --> 02:25:47,818
Your greed for money is making
their sacrifices useless.

2040
02:25:48,768 --> 02:25:52,696
But if anything happens
to you or your party...

2041
02:25:52,773 --> 02:25:55,932
...you'll do anything..
You'll burn people and city alive.

2042
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:58,666
The government will be
overthrown to achieve your goals.

2043
02:25:58,742 --> 02:26:01,420
You'll auction this place
to fill your pockets.

2044
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:06,902
Our neighbor has attained freedom...

2045
02:26:06,979 --> 02:26:10,566
...but still tries to invade us...

2046
02:26:11,012 --> 02:26:13,330
...because you are never free
from your criminal activities.

2047
02:26:13,663 --> 02:26:17,797
I want to ask you one thing.
Is there a leader...

2048
02:26:18,285 --> 02:26:22,551
...who has done a few good
things for our free Country?

2049
02:26:23,729 --> 02:26:26,178
What will you say? You traitors!

2050
02:26:26,579 --> 02:26:30,237
You have used this politics as
your means to satisfy your greed.

2051
02:26:30,411 --> 02:26:32,882
And have made this country
a market place for slaves.

2052
02:26:33,688 --> 02:26:36,356
While you are living like kings.

2053
02:26:36,833 --> 02:26:40,514
You have accounts in Swiss Banks,
bank balance, you own properties.

2054
02:26:40,695 --> 02:26:41,809
Where will you take all these to?

2055
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:44,524
Where will you take all these to?

2056
02:26:45,745 --> 02:26:48,658
Remember if an ordinary man is awakened...

2057
02:26:48,864 --> 02:26:51,597
...you'll neither have place to hide...

2058
02:26:51,674 --> 02:26:56,031
...nor will you get enough
place to bury your corpse.

2059
02:26:59,923 --> 02:27:02,710
But who'll wake this corpse?

2060
02:27:04,131 --> 02:27:07,357
Yesterday, this was done by
Mangal Pandey, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose,

2061
02:27:07,382 --> 02:27:10,209
martyrs Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev.

2062
02:27:10,943 --> 02:27:13,431
Today we will have to start it.

2063
02:27:14,196 --> 02:27:17,314
I am not as worthy as martyr Sukhdev,

2064
02:27:17,583 --> 02:27:18,247
but yes,

2065
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:22,309
I have to respect the name that we share.

2066
02:27:25,402 --> 02:27:27,605
Fire! Shoot them.

2067
02:27:29,527 --> 02:27:31,552
Run. Escape.

2068
02:27:33,416 --> 02:27:37,112
I feel that the purpose of
giving the information is achieved.

2069
02:27:41,354 --> 02:27:46,472
"From demons and traitors."

2070
02:27:46,721 --> 02:27:51,391
"We have to fight together."

2071
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:57,724
"We have to move ahead."

2072
02:27:57,763 --> 02:28:02,644
"Stop fearing."

2073
02:28:08,497 --> 02:28:11,451
I killed everybody.
Only you are remaining.

2074
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:15,091
Where is my pistol?

2075
02:28:15,225 --> 02:28:19,898
The person who wanted to kill me,
will bless me now.

2076
02:28:21,934 --> 02:28:23,707
The situations had
compelled him to be a don.

2077
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:30,069
But the blood in him escorted
him towards patriotism.

2078
02:28:30,250 --> 02:28:31,593
The change was temporary.

2079
02:28:32,806 --> 02:28:35,473
The principles are with him forever.

2080
02:28:36,854 --> 02:28:39,556
The principles you had taught
him are reflected in him now.

2081
02:28:39,902 --> 02:28:43,182
You wanted to bring about a revolution.
It has begun.

2082
02:28:43,743 --> 02:28:47,143
So you are those three revolutionaries?

2083
02:28:47,314 --> 02:28:51,186
Yes. We had to begin somewhere.

2084
02:28:52,471 --> 02:28:55,729
If an aged person like you
can take such decisions..

2085
02:28:55,806 --> 02:28:57,370
Then why can't we?

2086
02:28:57,970 --> 02:29:01,204
When I left that pistol in your hands...

2087
02:29:01,632 --> 02:29:04,282
...I had seen the glimpse
of patriotism in your eyes.

2088
02:29:05,407 --> 02:29:09,756
Let your patriotism be
our strength and honor us.

2089
02:29:11,192 --> 02:29:13,935
So that we can accept death happily.

2090
02:29:14,818 --> 02:29:16,295
This is our last wish.

2091
02:29:16,621 --> 02:29:19,419
Not in a dark room, but in an
open place in front of everybody...

2092
02:29:19,836 --> 02:29:21,603
...we would wish to face death.

2093
02:29:21,923 --> 02:29:24,893
I like your last wish.

2094
02:29:25,841 --> 02:29:30,321
People are forgetting the way
people had sacrificed their lives.

2095
02:29:30,645 --> 02:29:34,361
Let our death refresh the
memories of martyrs.

2096
02:29:34,703 --> 02:29:38,526
The freedom fighters who had
sacrificed their lives for us.

2097
02:29:40,042 --> 02:29:42,862
People can never erase their memories.

2098
02:29:44,072 --> 02:29:48,598
Freedom is our birthright.
Whenever freedom is endangered...

2099
02:29:48,637 --> 02:29:53,131
...freedom fighters like Sukhdev, Bhagat
Singh and Rajguru will be born again.

2100
02:29:53,945 --> 02:29:55,536
Hail the motherland!

2101
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:58,461
- Hail the motherland!
- Hail the motherland!

2102
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:13,222
"Sukhdev, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru..

2103
02:30:13,514 --> 02:30:18,887
...will be born on this land again."

2104
02:30:24,024 --> 02:30:29,363
"Sukhdev, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru..

2105
02:30:29,403 --> 02:30:34,435
...will be born on this land again."

2106
02:30:34,731 --> 02:30:39,867
"They will get freedom to us."

2107
02:30:40,105 --> 02:30:44,712
"We trust them."

2108
02:30:50,592 --> 02:30:55,798
"Everyone talks about the world."

2109
02:30:56,043 --> 02:31:01,564
"World is nothing."

2110
02:31:06,611 --> 02:31:11,863
"It is a dream, an illusion..

2111
02:31:12,009 --> 02:31:17,484
...or this world is nothing."

2112
02:31:22,578 --> 02:31:27,871
"Everyone talks about the world."
