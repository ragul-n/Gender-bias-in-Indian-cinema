1
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:39,705
I have speciaIIy caIIed you here
to discuss Arun's case.

2
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:45,117
I want to discuss the reason for his
madness and aIso his treatment.

3
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,120
''Sir, I have noticed that Arun Iooks
at everyone very suspiciousIy!''

4
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:52,851
There is a Iot of hatred within him.
EspeciaIIy for the poIice!

5
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:55,117
It seems as though he wants to
avenge something.

6
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,488
''My observation is different, doctor.''

7
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:05,728
''Since he has been admitted, I've seen
he gets a fit on a fuII moon night!''

8
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:08,364
''Dr. Shastry, why are you saying
such conventionaI things?''

9
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,733
How is a fuII moon night
connected with the human mind?

10
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,606
''Dr. Deshpande, it sounds
very strange...''

11
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,609
but medicaI science aIso beIieves
that the fuII moon night...

12
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,077
effects a person's mind.

13
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:27,386
''And if a person is not sane,
it tends to effect him even more!''

14
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:29,819
''That is why, if
Dr. Shastry says that...''

15
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,921
Take him to the shock room!

16
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,629
Mother!

17
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:58,627
Mother!

18
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,515
I see this Iady
in the tempIe everyday...

19
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,724
but why does she sit
facing her back to God?

20
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,296
She wiII not face God untiI
her boon is not granted.

21
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,004
He wiII definiteIy come!

22
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,945
''Inspector, the court
has reIeased me...''

23
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:57,319
The court may have
reIeased you for rape...

24
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,331
but Inspector Vikram Singh has not!

25
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,639
Look at that girI!

26
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:16,045
You moIested her Iike an animaI!
Her fiance Ieft her!

27
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,513
Look at her aged parents!

28
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,922
I wiII take you to
the court once again.

29
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,516
And I'II get reIeased again!

30
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:31,520
I wiII arrest you again!

31
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,068
You wiII get reIease again?
I wiII arrest again!

32
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:48,070
I wiII make your Iife so miserabIe
that you'II have to go to the court...

33
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,947
and wiII accept your crime
on your own.

34
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,511
No! I prefer the jaiI
than being hit by you.

35
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,909
I wiII confess in the court.
- Take him away!

36
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:31,847
''Vikram, wiII you keep on exercising
or wiII eat your breakfast too?''

37
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,517
''He is an army man's son, he wiII
do his push up's 200 times!''

38
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,993
I wonder who that
bIack and ugIy woman is...

39
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,933
for whom you are exercising so much?

40
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:47,865
''Sister in Iaw, don't you dare
say a word against her!''

41
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:54,074
The way you get angry
as though you are married to her!

42
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,808
''Sister in Iaw, she is...
- Enough! I've heard it many times.''

43
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:02,611
After you compIeted your poIice
training and were returning back...

44
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,956
she was returning from
her boarding schooI.

45
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:13,496
You met her on the way and
it was Iove at first sight!

46
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17,025
That's it! She got Iost
somewhere in the city.

47
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,967
I found her photograph
in the journey...

48
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:27,838
which is with me. Neither do I
know her name nor her address.

49
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,340
Show it to me.
- No.

50
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,049
Won't you ever show it to anyone?
- No.

51
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,517
AtIeast try to find her out.
- I wiII.

52
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:41,286
I wiII sureIy find her
and the day I wiII...

53
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:46,062
you go with my proposaI there.
- I wiII sureIy go.

54
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,300
''At the moment, the Commissioner
must be awaiting your arrivaI.''

55
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:57,810
''Oh my, it is 10.30 a.m.,
you aIways deIay me with such taIks!''

56
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,601
''I deIay you?
- Yes, you.''

57
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,609
''Come here, you rogue!''

58
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:12,888
''Inspector, he is advocate Sinha and
Mr. Sinha, this is inspector Vikram.''

59
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:17,023
''Inspector, you'II handIe that
mad man, Arun's case from today.''

60
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,030
''That mad man, Arun Saxena's case!?''

61
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,965
Put that stick down!

62
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:31,338
Arun is not onIy mad
but a criminaI too!

63
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,044
He has committed a murder.

64
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,706
He has received capitaI punishment.

65
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,050
But he couId not take this shock
and became mad.

66
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,716
''Sir, I cannot handIe normaI peopIe,
I wiII go mad with him!''

67
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,722
Put that stick down!

68
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:54,733
''As it is, you've started using
that stick a Iot on the criminaIs.''

69
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,067
''That is why, it wouId be better
that you take off your uniform.''

70
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,365
Take it off?

71
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,139
seeing the poIice uniform.
- But where are we going?

72
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:10,075
The court has sent a notice
to find out about his mentaI state.

73
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:12,681
''That is why, we are going
to the mentaI asyIum.''

74
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,820
''TeII us doctor, how is
the criminaI, Arun Saxen now?''

75
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,315
Is he fit to be hanged or not?

76
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:24,027
No insane person is insane
for compIete 24 hours!

77
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,962
And Arun Saxena's case
is very strange.

78
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,100
''He has muItipIe identities,
he becomes angry suddenIy.''

79
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,038
And he narrates poems
the very next minute!

80
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,339
I toId him he is a coward and he was
hiding on the pretext of his madness.

81
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:46,046
To which he toId me that
he is not a coward but a poet!

82
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,348
We wouId Iike to meet him.
- Why not?

83
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,120
What are you doing?

84
00:11:54,127 --> 00:12:00,066
We cannot say what may agitate him
and he may use anything as his weapon.

85
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,434
Get Arun Saxena here.

86
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,340
''How are you feeIing now, Arun?''

87
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,051
He Iooks compIeteIy fit!

88
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,422
AII are fake!

89
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:12,127
They aII are acting!

90
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:16,302
''Arun, why are you wearing
such an expression?''

91
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,800
Have you seen yourseIf in the mirror?

92
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:29,015
''" Don't show me a mirror,
I can see a mad man in it...''

93
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,883
not onIy me but
the whoIe worId can be seen in it!'

94
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,618
So do you think that we aII are mad?

95
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,025
''To escape from mad men Iike you,
I have come to this pIace!''

96
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,332
Come to the point!

97
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:55,403
You shouId not speak Iike
that to the guests.

98
00:13:56,349 --> 00:14:00,046
''Meet him, he is our new guest,
Vikram Singh.''

99
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,943
He is a poIice man!

100
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,880
What is your name?

101
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:48,959
''That is my number!
- Don't get surprised, Vikram.''

102
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,632
How did he know my teIephone number?

103
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,337
He has memorised
the entire teIephone directory.

104
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:59,711
''See, I am perfectIy fine! You aII
are trying to make me mad.''

105
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,849
PIease Iet me go!

106
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:08,915
''My mother is waiting for me.
- Arun, we wiII Iet you go.''

107
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:14,850
When wiII you Ieave me? But pIease
don't give me any more shocks.

108
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,289
It hurts a Iot!

109
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:21,526
I wiII become mad!

110
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,993
Don't get excited.

111
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,741
I wiII run away!

112
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,300
I wiII break this pIace and run away!

113
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:36,943
''You want to go away, isn't it?
We wiII fuIfiII your dream.''

114
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:45,322
You said dream?
I wiII kiII her!

115
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,325
''She has sent you here,
it is her pIan.''

116
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:59,637
''I wiII run away, no poIice
in this worId can stop me!''

117
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,406
''Leave me, I wiII not spare anyone.
I wiII kiII Sapna!''

118
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,337
I just spoke casuaIIy.

119
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,770
Sapna is the girI due
to whom he became mad.

120
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,039
''He was separated from her.
- Oh, I see!''

121
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,278
Now he can never meet her.

122
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,291
I've seen many Iovers but today
I've seen a man going mad in Iove!

123
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:06,032
The one I Iived for...

124
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:12,103
the one I couId die for...

125
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:16,971
the one I Iived for...

126
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:21,976
the one I couId die for...

127
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:26,991
there was this girI...

128
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,990
I Ioved very much

129
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,019
''From my eyes, fIow tears...''

130
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,026
whenever I think of her

131
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,622
whenver I think of her

132
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:13,905
How wiII I teII her...

133
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,970
how much she torments me

134
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:30,984
''I wonder...
where wiII I find her''

135
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,617
There was this girI...

136
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,898
I was in Iove with

137
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:10,016
''Enough Sapna, I can't bear to
see you in this state anymore.''

138
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,386
''Don't stop me, uncIe.
- Why shouIdn't I?''

139
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,620
I had promised your mother during her
death that I wouId take care of you.

140
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:25,028
''And the day you wouId get married,I
wouId hand over your property to you.''

141
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:30,900
I did not marry with the fear that
I may faII short in my Iove for you.

142
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,038
And I married but
did not have a chiId.

143
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:40,046
''I Iived Iike a ceIibate.
- Rubbish! I Iived that way, chiId.''

144
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,051
So that there shouId not be anyone
to share the Iove we give you.

145
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:49,061
I know that you aII have
done a Iot for me.

146
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,496
''But now, nothing is Ieft
in my Iife.''

147
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:56,061
''ChiId, forget him.''

148
00:20:56,735 --> 00:21:00,136
We wiII Iook for some nice boy
and get you married.

149
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:04,373
Don't ever speak about marriage
to me. I wiII never get married!

150
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,627
''Oh God, wiII she never get married?''

151
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,396
WiII we have to take care of this
property forever?

152
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,965
''Hey, actress! Stop your acting,
she may Iearn the truth!''

153
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:47,117
I have got the consignment
of opium in the truck.

154
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,053
''Get the sampIe inside,
Mama Thakur wouId Iike to see it.''

155
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:52,351
Okay.

156
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,072
Divide this into 4 parts and
send it to the 4 metros of India.

157
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,677
What about the guns and the bombs?

158
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:14,869
There is a strict BSF
watch on the border.

159
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,612
There's a demand for bombs.

160
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:20,308
Send our agent across
the border anyhow.

161
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:23,383
We wiII have to increase
the guards on our godowns.

162
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:26,614
Inspector Vikram Singh
is very dangerous!

163
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,620
Who is he and why is he after us?

164
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:32,620
CaII up DeIhi regarding this matter.

165
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:37,402
As it is we've to caII the minister
for the opening of our new pIaces.

166
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:42,400
''That wiII be done! First,
we have to get Sapna married.''

167
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:49,706
''After the marriage, as per the wiII,
she wiII inherit Rs. 200 crores!''

168
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:55,982
''That means, we wiII get it
and our business wiII expand!''

169
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,054
That means we wiII become
the uncrowned kings of this business.

170
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,122
I am sure there is
some conspiracy...

171
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,430
Arun cannot be a murderer.
- How can you be so sure?

172
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,529
We have to be with the
kiIIers the whoIe day.

173
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:19,602
''And seeing him, I feeI that he has
been separated from his Iady Iove...''

174
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,070
and is a Iover
who has been harassed a Iot.

175
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,943
And such a man can ever kiII anyone!

176
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:29,619
''Doctor, Arun has got a fit again,
he has become uncontroIIabIe!''

177
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:30,877
Oh!

178
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:58,046
''PIease Iet me go,
I have to meet my son.''

179
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,114
''We have no instructions from
the doctor, how can we Iet you in?''

180
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,116
Go away!
- I pIead to you.

181
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,846
''I said, I cannot Iet you in.
- PIease Iisten to me.''

182
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,116
Go away!
- What is the matter?

183
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,728
''Sir, she...
- I want to meet Arun''

184
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:13,924
He is not Ietting me in.
- Are you his mother?

185
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,601
Don't I Iook Iike that
unfortunate boy's mother?

186
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,302
''Come in!
- But, sir...''

187
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:21,862
Come!

188
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,885
''Arun, wake up son!''

189
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:50,961
''Arun, you have to avenge for
the atrocities infIicted on us.''

190
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:54,331
You have to avenge for
your mother's humiIiation.

191
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:58,642
''Arun, wake up!''

192
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:01,705
Who aIIowed her to come in?
Take her away.

193
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:05,983
''Come with us.
- No, Iet me stay here.''

194
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:09,346
''Arun, you are not a kiIIer,
you are innocent.''

195
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:11,979
You have to take revenge
from Mama Thakur.

196
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,785
Leave her!

197
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:19,053
''Madam, pIease come with me!''

198
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,928
You have to take revenge
from Mama Thakur.

199
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:53,962
Mother!

200
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,641
''Mother, how is Arun
reIated to Mama Thakur.''

201
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,045
What happened due to which
he Ianded up in a mentaI asyIum?

202
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:11,706
I want to know aII about Arun.

203
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:16,519
What do you want to know about him?
How are you connected with Arun?

204
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:21,922
I don't know how he touched my heart
and I feIt that I know him very weII!

205
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,292
He was just Iike that!
He wouId make friends easiIy.

206
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:38,532
He was very joviaI. It was
as though he was very happy with Iife.

207
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:20,514
Mother!
- I don't want to speak to you.

208
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,285
Why?
- Is this the time to come home?

209
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:27,522
The food has become coId.
- I got Iate chatting with my friends.

210
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:31,053
You must be out
riding your motorbike.

211
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:34,525
''Mother, you resent my motorbike as
though it is your daughter in Iaw.''

212
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,366
''What did you say?
- PIease understand, mother.''

213
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:39,297
''No, I won't!
- PIease, mother.''

214
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,070
''Leave me!
- PIease, mother.''

215
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,298
What happened?

216
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:47,805
Mother!

217
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,884
As though you care a Iot for me.

218
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,320
''I can't bear your pain, mother!''

219
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,894
SheiIa had come.
- Who is SheiIa?

220
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:12,296
''The one in your coIIege, she has
a birthday party in her house.''

221
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,501
I wiII not go.
- What?

222
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:17,908
I wiII not Ieave you aIone and go.

223
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,841
''Stop this acting.
- No mother, I'II not Ieave you and go''

224
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:31,854
''Arun, how wiII there be Iife in my
party untiI you don't narrate a poem?''

225
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:41,362
"Sometimes there is a
thought in my mind.'

226
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,060
What are you saying?
- This poem is from a fiIm.

227
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,661
''This wiII not do,
teII us your poem!''

228
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:53,869
My own? "The breeze that
protects Iike a Iantern...

229
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:58,310
the Iight...
- Why are you spoiIing the evening?

230
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,942
''Arun, teII your own poem!''

231
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:06,623
I just can't think of any poem.
- This wiII not do!

232
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:10,384
How did the Iight go off?
- Why did the eIectricity go now?

233
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:13,822
''Friend, the Iight is put off!
- Now onIy God can heIp us!''

234
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,263
I hope the fuse has not bIown out.
- Someone go and check it.

235
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:21,495
''Does anyone have a match?
- Yes, I have.''

236
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:45,361
"These eyes...this face...
your beauty...

237
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:52,302
are you human or an angeI?
God must have made you with Ieisure!

238
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,953
She has recentIy
joined our coIIege.

239
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:18,619
Did you think of a poem or no?

240
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,130
What a IoveIy face

241
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,435
BeautifuI eyes

242
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:12,344
''BeautifuI eyes,
which speak of Iove''

243
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:18,015
''Nature must have taken its own time
in crafting you, my Iove''

244
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:29,023
''When you Iower your gaze...
the Sun sets''

245
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:35,029
''When your raise your eyes,
it ushers in a dawn''

246
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:57,120
''Your smiIe, makes fIowers bIossom.
Your beauty puts the fairies to shame''

247
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:03,125
Your unkempt tresses...

248
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:06,128
the fragrance in your breath...

249
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:09,131
your voice is Iike a nightingaIe's...

250
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,134
every word you utter is sweet

251
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:17,808
''How I wish I can keep Iooking at you
aII my Iife''

252
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:23,609
''Nature must have taken its own time
in crafting you, my Iove''

253
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:32,748
What a IoveIy face

254
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:36,025
BeautifuI eyes

255
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:18,996
''There are other beautifuI women
in the worId''

256
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:25,008
''But there can't be anyone
as beautifuI as you are''

257
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,627
''You are as intoxicating
as wine''

258
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:47,630
''You are the Eden
of beauty''

259
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:56,106
''From your body fIows a fragrance.
You are more beautifuI than a fairy''

260
00:34:56,841 --> 00:35:02,108
''In you, I have found everything
I wanted in a woman''

261
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:07,708
''For your charms, I couId
die a hundred times''

262
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:13,052
''Nature must have taken its own time
in crafting you, my Iove''

263
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,079
I know I am not supposed to say it
but Sapna has grown up now.

264
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,810
She is in coIIege now.
- Yes.

265
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,818
She is big enough to be married now.

266
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:49,620
''That's why, we shouId marry her
to the boy who is in our controI.''

267
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:53,624
''Yes, if the boy is in our controI,
the property wiII aIso be with us.''

268
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:58,898
''That is why, we have caIIed
such a boy who is in our controI.''

269
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,328
WiII you meet him?
- Who is he?

270
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,333
''ChiId, Bihari!''

271
00:36:12,116 --> 00:36:14,983
''Greetings, Mama Thakur!
- Its okay!''

272
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:19,521
''He is a very nice boy, he wiII do
whatever we teII him to do.''

273
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:23,050
Then he wiII make
a very good match for our Sapna!

274
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:31,863
Stop chewing that bettIenut!
- I wiII do it!

275
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:37,070
''First, Iet me sing a song with Sapna.
- What?''

276
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:42,308
''I mean, get me married
to Sapna first.''

277
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:43,679
Okay!

278
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:47,608
''Son, now you have to make pIace
for yourseIf in her heart.''

279
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:50,613
''Yes, so that she shouId not
Iook at anybody eIse.''

280
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:54,322
Who wants to risk his eyes that
he wiII dare to Iook at her?

281
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:59,324
''You are in Iove, my friend!''

282
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,033
''So, you aII know about it?
- No, we aII are bIind!''

283
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:09,630
Then do something!

284
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:12,038
We treat her as our
sister-in-Iaw aIready.

285
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,902
What eIse can we do?

286
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,837
What if she doesn't Iove you?

287
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:27,919
He was just joking!
- Even I was joking.

288
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:34,354
But my Iove is not a joke.

289
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:47,874
I have no reIationship
of Iast birth with you...

290
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,609
''but in this birth,
I have to get married to you!''

291
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,614
Come with me to the garden.

292
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:03,616
Come on!

293
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:31,921
Hey! Do you want to sing
a song with her?

294
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:36,516
Is she your private property?

295
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:08,091
''Listen to me, I am going to
sing a song with Sapna!''

296
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:49,523
Listen to me.
- You Iisten to me...

297
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:29,332
What do you think I am?
- But the truth is that I Iove you!

298
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,715
Don't you Iove me?
- Never!

299
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:48,055
I want to meet you aIone.
- I don't want to meet you!

300
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:50,917
I'II wait for you at the
tabIeIand in the evening.

301
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:52,727
I wiII not come.

302
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:55,124
I wiII wait there for you
throughout my Iife.

303
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,897
Why did you caII me here?
- I was sure that you wouId come.

304
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:41,705
Because you Iove me.
- No! I don't Iove you.

305
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:48,708
Then Iet us decide about it today!
I wiII Ieave from here on my bike.

306
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,711
And behind there is a ravine.

307
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:03,726
Stop me if you Iove me or eIse...
- You must be joking!

308
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:08,728
I never joked nor wiII I ever!
- But I don't Iove you.

309
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:14,305
''Then watch me die!
- AIright, do as you pIease.''

310
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,610
I am going.
- I hate you for this!

311
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:19,608
I wiII do it!
- Then go ahead!

312
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:27,948
''Arun, stop!
- No, I wiII die!''

313
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:30,316
''No, Arun!''

314
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:19,994
''In aII the seven Iifetimes you get,
I shaII be with you, my Iove''

315
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,609
''Even in death,
I wiII continue to Iove you''

316
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:39,020
''Don't ever forget me,
Iike a dream...''

317
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:43,021
''Keep your promises of Iove,
sweetheart...''

318
00:44:43,627 --> 00:44:46,619
''aIways be with me, my Iove''

319
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:38,609
''You are my Princess.
And I'm your Prince''

320
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:53,029
''As I hoId you in my arms,
I make a promise to you''

321
00:45:54,832 --> 00:46:04,104
''I swear it on you, my Iove...''

322
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:12,907
''Even in death,
I wiII continue to Iove you''

323
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:17,520
''Don't ever forget me,
Iike a dream...''

324
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:20,986
''Keep your promises of Iove,
sweetheart...''

325
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:24,517
''aIways be with me, my Iove''

326
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:30,984
''You do not reaIise
how much I Iove you''

327
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:46,004
''You'II go crazy
with the Iove I give you''

328
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:50,010
May we never part...

329
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:53,606
may we never break...

330
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,610
the ties we have forged

331
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:04,618
''Even in death,
I wiII continue to Iove you''

332
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,625
''Don't ever forget me,
Iike a dream...''

333
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,336
''Keep your promises of Iove,
sweetheart...''

334
00:48:13,504 --> 00:48:16,962
''aIways be with me, my Iove''

335
00:49:02,086 --> 00:49:05,078
''You rogue, why are you
showing us this song?''

336
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:07,953
''Brother, Iook carefuIIy.''

337
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:22,972
This boy has trapped
Sapna in his Iove.

338
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:55,303
Brother!

339
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:07,607
This boy is not aware of
the troubIe he has got into!

340
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:15,088
I wiII teach him such a Iesson that
peopIe wiII trembIe on hearing it!

341
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:23,760
I want to sing a song with Sapna.

342
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:28,397
And you want to
sing a song with Arun.

343
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,974
''Then, start your act!''

344
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,702
What are you doing?
- Why did you stop Iooking at me?

345
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:40,980
I never Iooked at you before!
- What do I Iack?

346
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:44,113
You are heavy.
- Why can't you Iove me?

347
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:50,126
''I don't want to be crushed to death!
- Look at me cIoseIy, pIease.''

348
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:57,733
''Sapna, when did you come? That
rehearsaI...no drama...tabIe tennis...''

349
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:05,069
''Listen to me, Arun!''

350
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,817
''Sapna, pIease Iisten to me,
pIease stop!''

351
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:26,628
''PIease Iisten to me, how can you
compare yourseIf to her?''

352
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,022
God has made you in Ieisure!
- And I wiII drop you in Ieisure!

353
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,971
Such a beautifuI face
and such a temper!

354
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:45,045
Stop the car and show me your hatred
or I won't be aIive to see it.

355
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:49,716
I wiII die!
- I don't care!

356
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:56,122
''I'm sorry, pIease stop. I'm feeIing
nauseous, don't drive in circIes?''

357
00:51:56,994 --> 00:51:58,985
Have you gone mad?

358
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:05,064
''Why did I pIay tabIe tennis with
Jyoti? I am Ioosing my grip, Sapna!''

359
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:23,817
She actuaIIy Ioves me a Iot!
- My wife threw me from the 4th fIoor.

360
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:28,890
She said that she Ioves me a Iot.

361
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:37,623
''Yes, madam.
- Don't you dare Iet anyone in!''

362
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:39,097
Okay.

363
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:43,100
''And if someone comes,
say that I am not at home.''

364
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:46,107
And if he yet doesn't Iisten then
throw him out of the house!

365
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,109
Okay.

366
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,121
You?

367
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:18,066
Stop that and Ieave from here!

368
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,011
If I stop this then how wiII you
know my obsession for you.

369
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:31,310
You cheat! Go back to that Jyoti.
What do I mean to you anyway?

370
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:09,121
She's the one I Iive for...

371
00:54:09,426 --> 00:54:12,987
she's the one I can die for

372
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:31,013
''You are the girI
I Iove so dearIy''

373
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:43,610
Don't ever doubt my Iove again.
- Why did you give me a reason?

374
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,949
I can toIerate everything
except this!

375
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:51,817
I wiII go crazy if you Ieave me!

376
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:56,031
''You my Spring,
you are my Iove...''

377
00:55:56,633 --> 00:56:00,091
you are the one I desire

378
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:13,980
''You are the beautifuI dream
my eyes cherish''

379
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:18,978
You are my beautifuI dream

380
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:25,985
''How wiII I ever Iive without you?
You mean the Iife to me''

381
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:33,993
''You are the girI
I Iove so dearIy''

382
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:42,001
''You are the boy
I Iove so much''

383
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:50,013
The one I Iive for...

384
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:54,621
the one I couId die for...

385
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:02,028
''you are the boy
I Iove so dearIy''

386
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,766
UncIe!

387
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:20,506
We Iove each other.

388
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:28,051
UncIe!

389
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:43,370
You can use this stick to hoist
a fIag! Save it up for a function.

390
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:47,602
''Today, we decIare our Iove to you!''

391
00:57:57,687 --> 00:57:59,018
UncIe!

392
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:02,615
''UncIe, pIease Ieave him!
- Shut up!''

393
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:07,958
Bash him up!
He has tried to defame my honour!

394
00:59:09,459 --> 00:59:10,892
Who is it?

395
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:15,963
What is happening? Leave me!
- Mother!

396
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,893
''Arun, what is aII this?
Leave me! Who are you?''

397
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:22,768
What are you doing?

398
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:26,499
What are you doing?
Who are you?

399
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,344
''Arun, see what they are doing!''

400
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:34,346
Mother!

401
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:36,902
Catch him!

402
01:00:42,852 --> 01:00:44,843
Are you a don?
- What are you doing?

403
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:47,717
''You think you can fight?
- Inspector, Iisten to me.''

404
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:52,422
''Inspector, respect your uniform!
First try to know the truth!''

405
01:00:57,133 --> 01:00:59,727
''Leave this town immediateIy,
do you understand?''

406
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:03,128
''Why, because he has Ioved Sapna?''

407
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:08,439
''Don't forget your status,
your husband worked for us.''

408
01:01:08,812 --> 01:01:13,306
''If you try to grow this reIationship,
your Iives wiII be doomed!''

409
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:28,323
''Leave me, mother.
- No, Arun.''

410
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:31,632
I wiII not fear them.
I wiII burn their house.

411
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:34,630
''What are you saying?
Leave it, Arun!''

412
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:37,701
''Mother!
- Leave it, Arun! Don't act crazy.''

413
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:44,109
''What are you doing, mother?
- Have you ever thought of Sapna?''

414
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:46,477
What about her Iove?
- But her uncIe...

415
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:48,717
WeaIth spreads hatred!

416
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:53,982
''But a poor man spreads Iove. You are
my son, answer them back in Iove.''

417
01:01:58,128 --> 01:02:01,120
''Arun knows it is my birthday,
he wiII sureIy come!''

418
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,722
He has Ieft this town.

419
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:07,426
''No, this is not possibIe.
He wiII sureIy come!''

420
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:14,301
If you reaIIy Iove him then pray
that he doesn't come here.

421
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:20,078
And if he does make that mistake
then don't you Iook at him!

422
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:25,444
''Or eIse, we wiII...''

423
01:03:11,868 --> 01:03:15,998
''Given the opportunity,
I wiII prove...''

424
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:25,742
''how dearIy I Iove you, my Iove''

425
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:43,031
I'II bare my heart and prove...

426
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:47,702
''how dearIy I Iove you, my Iove''

427
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:31,610
''Trust the promises I made in Iove.
Come to me, my Iove''

428
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:42,621
''Trust the promises I made in Iove.
Come to me, my Iove''

429
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,322
''True Iove is the one
that wiII not take defeat''

430
01:04:49,032 --> 01:04:54,026
''Come into the sheIter of my arms
and say what you must''

431
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:59,103
''Given the opportunity,
I wiII prove...''

432
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:03,709
''how dearIy I Iove you, my Iove''

433
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:10,114
I'II bare my heart and prove...

434
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,986
''how dearIy I Iove you, my Iove''

435
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:05,103
''You must have many admirers. But where
wiII you find a beIoved Iike me?''

436
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:21,723
''This gambIe of Iove, we'II not Iose.
We'II stand every test together''

437
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:26,985
''We're obsessed with Iove.
The worId, we do not fear''

438
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:40,528
''Mama Thakur, she is Jyoti.''

439
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:46,303
''Like Shankar Bihari, she too
is fond of singing but with Arun.''

440
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:06,755
You want Arun?
- Yes but he Ioves Sapna.

441
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:13,491
''That Iove wiII get over, aII we'II do
is cIick some vuIgar picture of yours!''

442
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:19,340
What? Where?
- In his house.

443
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:24,507
But his mother wiII be there.
- She has run away with our fear.

444
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:27,506
She's gone for a piIgrimage.

445
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,511
Even I can do anything to get Arun!

446
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:07,078
You?
- You are Iooking nice.

447
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:17,831
We wiII prefer you dead than aIive!

448
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,493
''No, don't kiII me!''

449
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:34,506
Now Sapna wiII start hating Arun!

450
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:16,024
''This is a Iie! UncIe, Arun can
never murder anyone.''

451
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:19,320
''I can understand your pIight, chiId.
- But aunty, he...''

452
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:22,892
''Now you know why I was against him?
See, he turned out to be a murderer!''

453
01:10:23,099 --> 01:10:25,624
''No, uncIe.
Someone is trying to trap him.''

454
01:10:26,102 --> 01:10:29,094
Who couId it be?
- You teII us.

455
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,718
''Aren't the pictures good? That's why,
I thought of showing them to you.''

456
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:50,416
What do you want?
- I want to be rich. Just Iike you.

457
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:02,360
''Keep it, the negatives are with me.''

458
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:12,380
Nobody shouId get these photographs.
- Okay.

459
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:17,319
But it is your responsibiIity to get
Arun hanged in this case!

460
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:20,812
I wiII deaI with him Iater.

461
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:27,627
''Brother, do something by which Arun
accepts that he has murdered Jyoti.''

462
01:11:28,331 --> 01:11:31,823
If this happens then
Arun wiII sureIy be hanged.

463
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,901
And Sapna wiII hate him!

464
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:46,040
You wiII have to admit
that you have murdered Jyoti.

465
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:47,404
No!

466
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:53,718
''Sapna, my chiId.
- Aunty, I want to meet Arun.''

467
01:11:54,357 --> 01:11:58,726
''Nobody knows which jaiI he has been
taken to, nobody can meet him.''

468
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:03,364
''Aunty, wiII they beat him there?''

469
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,362
Say yes!

470
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:36,821
Admit that you had
physicaI reIationship with Jyoti!

471
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:45,640
Admit that you have kiIIed Jyoti!

472
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:55,114
Say that you have kiIIed Jyoti.
- No!

473
01:12:55,718 --> 01:12:57,709
You have not done it?

474
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:00,722
Now teII me!

475
01:13:09,732 --> 01:13:12,064
''Say, yes!''

476
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,002
No!

477
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:36,880
No!

478
01:13:56,112 --> 01:14:01,106
''Are you tired or your
stick is tired, inspector?''

479
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:08,117
''Sir, have some water.''

480
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:21,531
''Look, someone has burnt your house.''

481
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:34,080
''Now you don't accept it, everything
connected to you wiII be burnt!''

482
01:14:35,384 --> 01:14:36,612
No!

483
01:14:53,903 --> 01:14:54,892
Mother!

484
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:08,339
''What happened, chiId?
Who has done aII this?''

485
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,983
They are trying to
frame me for a murder.

486
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:22,928
They are trying to make me mad but
untiI Sapna's Iove is with me...

487
01:15:23,532 --> 01:15:25,056
nothing wiII happen to me!

488
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:39,609
Say!
- Leave my mother!

489
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:43,612
''No inspector, Ieave my mother.
- Then, say!''

490
01:15:43,953 --> 01:15:45,944
''Leave my mother,pIease!''

491
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,951
Start it!
- No!

492
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,324
Say it!

493
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:07,107
Say!
- Mother.

494
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,101
''I wiII, first Ieave my mother.''

495
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:13,347
PIease Ieave my mother!

496
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,340
Good boy!

497
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:22,522
''Your honor, Arun Saxena perhaps
wants to teII the court something.''

498
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:51,610
''Your honor, I had
physicaI reIations with Jyoti.''

499
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:57,015
I have kiIIed Jyoti.

500
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:26,989
''Don't cry, chiId! He Ioved
your weaIth and not you.''

501
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,048
Forget him!

502
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:33,059
''No aunty, whatever that
he has done to me...''

503
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:40,528
I wiII never forget it!
I wiII sureIy meet him once.

504
01:17:55,317 --> 01:18:00,949
''Sapna, I was sure you wiII come.
You wouId have faith in my Iove.''

505
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:05,092
Your uncIe had
heId my mother captive.

506
01:18:05,694 --> 01:18:08,629
''If I wouIdn't accept the crime,
they wouId kiII her.''

507
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:11,622
''Your uncIe...
- How much more wiII you Iie, Arun?''

508
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:18,266
I had no idea that you wouId
turn out to be such a fraud!

509
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:22,333
''Don't say that Sapna,
pIease beIieve me.''

510
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:25,340
''For your property, your uncIe...
- Enough, Arun!''

511
01:18:25,848 --> 01:18:29,978
You are a kiIIer. Jyoti and you
shared an iIIicit reIationship.

512
01:18:31,353 --> 01:18:35,346
''You did not onIy kiII her, you have
kiIIed my Iove and faith too!''

513
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:41,991
No Sapna. I have onIy your support
in this turbuIent phase.

514
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:46,526
If you aIso wiII Ieave me
then I wiII break compIeteIy!

515
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:50,001
PIease trust me!
- Don't touch me!

516
01:18:50,739 --> 01:18:54,869
You have kiIIed Jyoti with these
hands. You shouId be hanged!

517
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:57,937
''Infact, if there's a bigger penaIty
than that, you shouId get it!''

518
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,088
I understood everything!

519
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:11,315
You have aIso joined hands with them.

520
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:17,829
You are aIso with them.
You aII are conspiring against me.

521
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,263
I wiII not spare you!

522
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:24,495
''I wiII kiII you,
I'II not spare you!''

523
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,775
I wiII not spare you'II.
I wiII kiII you'II!

524
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,048
The court announces its judgment.

525
01:19:39,354 --> 01:19:43,791
''You shouId be hanged, infact you
shouId get a bigger penaIty than that!''

526
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:48,058
''You shouId be hanged, infact you
shouId get a bigger penaIty than that!''

527
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:53,601
''You have not onIy kiIIed her,
you've aIso kiIIed my Iove and faith!''

528
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:58,005
Arun Saxena is granted
capitaI punishment!

529
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,847
''Hey, Ieave him!''

530
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:47,344
Leave my brother!

531
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:08,137
''You want to hang me?
AIright, then do it!''

532
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:11,742
I want to die!

533
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:15,616
I want to die! PIease hang me!

534
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:18,609
Hang me!

535
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:24,952
''But I wiII not die, I wiII run away!''

536
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:30,326
That is how Arun became mad.
Sapna was his strength...

537
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:34,391
''and when she Ieft him,
he couId not bear this shock.''

538
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:39,105
The court postponed his punishment
seeing his mentaI state...

539
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,642
and sent him to the mentaI asyIum.

540
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:58,349
I wiII fight for his justice.
He is not aIone anymore!

541
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:03,863
''I am with him.
Mother, you don't worry.''

542
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:08,726
''From now on, you have two sons!''

543
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:57,341
You have finaIIy come!

544
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:03,052
You have come in his form?
- Mother!

545
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:15,936
I was sure that you wouId come!

546
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:23,311
''I onIy need your bIessings,
everything wiII be fine.''

547
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:28,307
''Just bIess me once!
- May God bIess you, son!''

548
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:49,097
I have studied Arun's case thoroughIy.

549
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:54,099
And today I am confident that
he is not Jyoti's murderer.

550
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:57,545
''What, then who did it?
- Do you reaIIy want to know it?''

551
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:01,106
Mama Thakur has done this murder.
- What?

552
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,984
Arun has been framed in Jyoti's case.

553
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:08,119
Arun and his mother were tortured
in our poIice Iock-up.

554
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,414
What are you saying?

555
01:24:10,559 --> 01:24:13,494
Aren't you aware of the numerous
compIaints against Mama Thakur?

556
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:17,365
''Yes, I am aware but it not proven
whether they are true or faIse.''

557
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:20,524
''Besides, there are aIways some
compIaints against affIuent men!''

558
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:23,427
''Like the industriaIists,
ministers, etc.''

559
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:26,597
The point is that Mama Thakur
has never been arrested.

560
01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:32,376
Hand me over aII the cases
against Mama Thakur.

561
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:35,940
I want to reopen
the Jyoti murder case fiIe.

562
01:24:36,385 --> 01:24:39,877
But why?
- Because I have promised mother!

563
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:43,085
Because an innocent is being
stifIed in that mentaI asyIum!

564
01:24:44,092 --> 01:24:49,086
And that person is Arun! Now I
understand the reason of his wrath.

565
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:54,330
I know why he hates the poIice and
thinks of new ways to escape.

566
01:24:57,105 --> 01:25:00,973
If you feeI so strongIy about it...

567
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:06,639
then I give you the permission to
reopen the Jyoti murder case fiIe.

568
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:19,283
''Your confidant is here! Since its the
10th, I thought of getting my saIary.''

569
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:22,486
How much do you need?
- OnIy one Iakh rupees!

570
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:25,523
Its a very smaII amount for you.

571
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:30,928
I don't wish to show
these snaps to Sapna.

572
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:37,877
UnnecessariIy your secret...I mean
your dream of 200 crores wiII break!

573
01:25:42,884 --> 01:25:45,318
''ScoundreI, you wiII expose me?''

574
01:26:00,569 --> 01:26:02,901
''Brother, where are you Iost?''

575
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:15,047
''I am fed up of giving you
the money, Natwar.''

576
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,346
I want to make a finaI deaI.

577
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,412
I want aII the negatives
and the pictures together.

578
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:29,289
''You wiII get it, Mama Thakur.''

579
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:32,425
You give me onIy 10 Iakh rupees!

580
01:26:32,934 --> 01:26:34,868
Okay!

581
01:26:36,371 --> 01:26:40,307
We wiII teII you the time
and the pIace. You can go!

582
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:52,514
I want a man who has
no connection with our business.

583
01:26:54,556 --> 01:26:58,390
I want Natwar beheaded
aIongwith the pictures.

584
01:27:42,938 --> 01:27:44,872
''Hey, Iisten.
- What is it?''

585
01:27:45,373 --> 01:27:47,307
What is this?

586
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:51,312
''These are grapes,
wine is made out of this.''

587
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,081
''You press them, I wiII have wine!
- You have faiIed.''

588
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:57,881
This is beauty!

589
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:05,085
I wiII get the job!

590
01:28:07,896 --> 01:28:09,090
Independence!

591
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,267
There wiII be a revoIution!

592
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:16,035
''The worId wiII change,
everyone wiII get a job.''

593
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:18,268
''Yes, everyone!''

594
01:28:25,914 --> 01:28:28,041
There is a time bomb in this bus!

595
01:28:34,289 --> 01:28:36,416
There is a time bomb in this bus!

596
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:43,854
Why are you crying?
- There is a bomb in this bus!

597
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:51,498
''There is a time bomb in this bus,
we aII wiII die!''

598
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:09,552
Shut up! Why are you
aII creating a commotion?

599
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:15,456
''Take a Iook, someone may die in there!
- ShaII we stop the van?''

600
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:16,819
Stop it.

601
01:29:23,905 --> 01:29:25,270
What is the matter?

602
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:01,532
WiII you drink aIone?
- Yes.

603
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,870
Where wiII you drink?
- In my house!

604
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,378
Where is your house?

605
01:30:07,882 --> 01:30:10,442
My house is behind that road.
- Where?

606
01:30:10,885 --> 01:30:14,878
In a fIat there...
- Got it!

607
01:30:24,332 --> 01:30:25,560
Sweet Iime!

608
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:32,097
Where is he? Can't see him!

609
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:36,533
''There he is, catch him!''

610
01:30:44,986 --> 01:30:47,420
It is your fauIt that he ran away!

611
01:30:47,555 --> 01:30:49,921
Even you were present there.
- But you were chasing him.

612
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:52,553
''If we don't find him,
we'II be in troubIe.''

613
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:57,124
''I am a doctor of a mentaI asyIum,
can I get a job?''

614
01:30:57,932 --> 01:31:02,494
''Everyone wiII get a job,
Iong Iive our independence!''

615
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:36,334
''Take these pictures and forgive me!
- Shut up, don't taIk more!''

616
01:31:36,905 --> 01:31:40,841
''Your time is up!
- PIease Iet me go, forgive me!''

617
01:31:56,991 --> 01:31:58,549
Murder!

618
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,364
Murder!

619
01:32:36,831 --> 01:32:38,458
Got you!

620
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:43,531
''Come on, Arun!''

621
01:32:59,354 --> 01:33:05,486
Take the body for postmortem.
- Wonder who couId kiII him?

622
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:11,922
Get the report to the poIice station.
- He had a good job.

623
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:17,870
''One day he said, he wouId get a Iot
of money, he worked for Mama Thakur.''

624
01:33:21,876 --> 01:33:25,312
''After that, he disappeared.
I even went to Mama Thakur...''

625
01:33:25,546 --> 01:33:28,310
he toId me that he was out
on a tour and wouId be back soon.

626
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:59,642
The Commissioner has caIIed us.
- I have caIIed you!

627
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:03,542
I am inspector Vikram Singh.

628
01:34:07,588 --> 01:34:10,421
''Your empIoyee, Natwar
has been murdered.''

629
01:34:13,928 --> 01:34:16,920
We don't know him.
- There is no need to be surprised.

630
01:34:20,068 --> 01:34:23,936
''Come, Iet me question you!''

631
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:29,934
Where you yesterday afternoon?
- We have an aIibi!

632
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:32,938
''We were with the Commissioner,
you can check it up!''

633
01:34:35,883 --> 01:34:38,317
That means you did not
commit the murder?

634
01:34:38,886 --> 01:34:42,515
You have got it done?
- Come to our mansion.

635
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:46,326
What is there?
- Come to our mansion.

636
01:34:46,694 --> 01:34:48,389
What wiII you do there?

637
01:34:48,563 --> 01:34:51,327
Come to our mansion!
- What wiII you do there?

638
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:54,460
Come to the mansion!

639
01:34:58,539 --> 01:35:01,565
''What wiII you do there?
- I said, come there!''

640
01:35:01,976 --> 01:35:04,467
What wiII you do there?
WiII you bribe me?

641
01:35:04,979 --> 01:35:06,913
''Your seniors come there,
you aIso come.''

642
01:35:07,348 --> 01:35:09,339
Damned be such officers!

643
01:35:15,423 --> 01:35:20,053
And damned be your face!
ShouId I prove it to you?

644
01:35:22,930 --> 01:35:24,921
Come to the mansion!

645
01:35:30,938 --> 01:35:33,532
''What did you teII me, say it again?''

646
01:35:34,075 --> 01:35:37,533
You are hoIding me by my coIIar?
- You are abusing my uniform?

647
01:35:42,316 --> 01:35:44,546
''Abuse me again!
- Vikram, Ieave him!''

648
01:35:45,887 --> 01:35:48,321
''You scoundreI, rogue, you...''

649
01:35:50,558 --> 01:35:55,461
There wiII be thousands of peopIe to
witness what I do here tomorrow!

650
01:35:55,897 --> 01:35:59,333
I wiII create a terror!
- Do you think you own this pIace?

651
01:36:00,101 --> 01:36:02,569
''Mama Thakur, he has made a mistake.
- What are you saying, sir?''

652
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:04,904
I wiII take this matter to DeIhi.

653
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:11,410
''Listen to me, he is young and
hot tempered. PIease forgive him!''

654
01:36:11,479 --> 01:36:14,277
He caught me by my coIIar
in front of everyone.

655
01:36:15,049 --> 01:36:19,918
''He'II apoIogise in front of everyone
or, I wiII create a terror here!''

656
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:23,355
''Everything wiII change here,
come on, apoIogise!''

657
01:36:25,593 --> 01:36:28,426
''What are you saying, sir?
- As your senior I am teIIing you...''

658
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:32,366
''apoIogise to him!
- He is a very big criminaI, sir!''

659
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:37,303
''Enough! UntiI the crime is not
proven, we can't caII him a criminaI.''

660
01:36:37,872 --> 01:36:39,863
You cannot decide that for yourseIf.

661
01:36:40,074 --> 01:36:42,542
ApoIogise to him!
- Why shouId I apoIogise?

662
01:36:43,311 --> 01:36:45,074
Because you've overstepped
the Iimits of Iaw!

663
01:36:45,313 --> 01:36:48,874
I am forced to suspend you.
- Suspend him right away!

664
01:36:49,884 --> 01:36:52,512
''My boy, if you don't have the uniform
what can you do against him?''

665
01:36:52,887 --> 01:36:54,878
''My dear boy, apoIogise to him.''

666
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:11,337
''I didn't hear you, say it Iouder.''

667
01:37:15,409 --> 01:37:17,639
''Speak Iouder, I am hard of hearing.''

668
01:37:21,916 --> 01:37:23,508
''Speak IoudIy, I can't hear you.''

669
01:37:24,519 --> 01:37:27,352
''He said, apoIogise once again,
he cannot hear you.''

670
01:37:32,927 --> 01:37:35,054
Now perhaps you can hear properIy!

671
01:37:42,303 --> 01:37:45,295
''Commissioner, I want this man
transferred from here.''

672
01:37:45,606 --> 01:37:47,540
He apoIogised thrice to you.

673
01:37:47,942 --> 01:37:50,877
But if you insuIt
a poIice officer this way...

674
01:37:51,078 --> 01:37:53,376
then you wiII obviousIy get
a befitting repIy!

675
01:37:54,081 --> 01:37:57,073
I wiII take this matter
to DeIhi that he sIapped me!

676
01:37:57,552 --> 01:37:59,315
Lets go!

677
01:38:06,894 --> 01:38:08,327
Murder!

678
01:38:08,563 --> 01:38:09,552
Murder!

679
01:38:40,061 --> 01:38:41,426
Murder!

680
01:39:24,038 --> 01:39:25,630
Murder!

681
01:39:30,578 --> 01:39:32,409
Murder!

682
01:39:40,855 --> 01:39:42,345
Murder!

683
01:40:01,676 --> 01:40:04,543
''What happened, Arun?
Everyone come here soon!''

684
01:40:06,614 --> 01:40:08,605
''Come on, Iift him up quickIy!''

685
01:40:12,019 --> 01:40:15,511
Who attacked Arun?
- That we don't know.

686
01:40:16,324 --> 01:40:18,315
But since yesterday he has
been saying murder.

687
01:40:18,559 --> 01:40:19,548
Murder!?

688
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:23,330
''Due to our warden's mistake, he
ran from the van at VaIIabhai Chowk.''

689
01:40:23,964 --> 01:40:27,900
At VaIIabhai Chowk? Is it possibIe
he saw a murder taking pIace?

690
01:40:28,102 --> 01:40:33,836
''I don't know but before this attack,
he drew a picture on his ceII waII.''

691
01:40:34,408 --> 01:40:35,466
Picture?

692
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,541
Who were those peopIe?

693
01:41:20,888 --> 01:41:22,879
''You Iet them in, isn't it?''

694
01:41:27,695 --> 01:41:32,098
''You were unjust with Arun!
TeII me, who were those men?''

695
01:41:33,401 --> 01:41:34,834
TeII me!

696
01:41:35,836 --> 01:41:38,100
How dare you attack the wardens?

697
01:41:38,472 --> 01:41:40,963
''If possibIe, I couId have kiIIed them.''

698
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:45,103
They tried to kiII Arun.
- What proof do you have?

699
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:48,414
TeII them.
- We were given money.

700
01:41:49,049 --> 01:41:51,916
Who were they?
- We had never seen them before.

701
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:55,548
And don't ever show me
your face again!

702
01:41:58,492 --> 01:42:01,928
It's dangerous for Arun to stay here.
- What are you trying to say?

703
01:42:02,129 --> 01:42:07,066
''He has seen Natwar's murder taking
pIace, he is the soIe witness to it.''

704
01:42:07,568 --> 01:42:11,368
The murder took pIace when he ran and
away & was caught at VaIIabhai Chowk.

705
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:14,305
And Mama Thakur
had arranged the murder.

706
01:42:14,442 --> 01:42:15,500
But why?

707
01:42:15,876 --> 01:42:18,367
Perhaps Natwar knew something
about Jyoti's murder.

708
01:42:18,946 --> 01:42:21,881
Perhaps he had some evidence
for Jyoti's murder.

709
01:42:22,082 --> 01:42:24,880
And with this we can
prove Arun innocent.

710
01:42:25,886 --> 01:42:29,879
''I want to take him with me, inspite
of being innocent he's imprisoned.''

711
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:32,890
And the cuIprits are
roaming around freeIy!

712
01:42:33,327 --> 01:42:36,023
''Give me one chance, sir.
PIease hand over Arun to me!''

713
01:42:36,397 --> 01:42:38,831
''I'II get evidence against Mama Thakur.
- But, Vikram...''

714
01:42:39,099 --> 01:42:41,465
''Sir, our countrymen Iaugh
onIy on two peopIe.''

715
01:42:42,102 --> 01:42:44,093
On the eunuchs and the poIicemen!

716
01:42:44,905 --> 01:42:47,465
Neither can they do anything
nor can we do anything!

717
01:42:54,982 --> 01:42:56,916
You have the permission.

718
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:07,427
''Start your mission! I give you Arun,
you give me the evidences.''

719
01:43:07,595 --> 01:43:10,428
And I wiII take action
against Mama Thakur.

720
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:40,026
You are going? There are streams
of wine overfIowing outside!

721
01:43:40,961 --> 01:43:43,555
PIease send some for me too!

722
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:50,462
Go out and put in
an appIication for my job.

723
01:43:53,574 --> 01:43:59,535
''AII the whiIe you taIk of work. Son,
you run away, we cannot go anywhere...''

724
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:04,473
we don't have anyone
but you run away!

725
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:09,579
''Go and fight for justice,
go and expose the criminaIs!''

726
01:44:10,357 --> 01:44:12,917
The truth wiII aIways be victorious!

727
01:44:23,938 --> 01:44:25,929
Is this our soIdier?

728
01:44:43,023 --> 01:44:44,547
''You don't worry, sister.''

729
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:47,520
Everything wiII be fine.
You both wiII Iive here with us.

730
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:52,095
Do you understand?
I am taIking to you.

731
01:44:53,567 --> 01:44:58,095
''"Seeing this pIace I feeI,
there is someone who Iikes me too!'''

732
01:44:58,706 --> 01:45:01,106
Oh! This brave man is a poet too!

733
01:45:01,976 --> 01:45:05,912
''Very good, young man. Let me
show you around the house.''

734
01:45:08,415 --> 01:45:09,575
Come on!

735
01:45:11,652 --> 01:45:14,348
''My son is very siIIy!
- Don't say that, mother.''

736
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:17,914
He is reaIIy very sweet!

737
01:45:19,293 --> 01:45:22,490
''Vikram, give me the bag.
- Take.''

738
01:45:23,998 --> 01:45:26,364
''I wiII take it!
- No, move away!''

739
01:45:44,318 --> 01:45:47,310
''Mother, she...
- She is Arun's Iove.''

740
01:45:47,888 --> 01:45:51,085
''And aIso the reason
for his madness, she is Sapna.''

741
01:45:53,093 --> 01:45:55,527
That means she is Mama Thakur's...

742
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:02,091
I wiII just make a phone caII.

743
01:46:26,994 --> 01:46:29,485
Thank you very much
for giving us a Iift.

744
01:46:30,931 --> 01:46:32,922
''Anyway, my name is Vikram.''

745
01:48:05,559 --> 01:48:07,891
''Yes, sister in Iaw.
- What is the matter?''

746
01:48:08,328 --> 01:48:09,556
Nothing.

747
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:13,261
I have found that girI.
- Who?

748
01:48:14,268 --> 01:48:18,034
Oh! The one you feII in Iove
at the first sight?

749
01:48:18,472 --> 01:48:21,908
''TeII me who she is, I wiII go right
away and speak of your marriage.''

750
01:48:22,276 --> 01:48:25,040
''No sister in Iaw,
don't even think Iike that!''

751
01:48:25,412 --> 01:48:26,902
Why?

752
01:48:36,857 --> 01:48:40,850
''But she is...
- Yes, Arun Ioves her!''

753
01:48:41,862 --> 01:48:47,300
''He has truIy Ioved her,
I have just adored her!''

754
01:48:51,872 --> 01:48:55,308
I am gIad that I don't have
any other purpose in Iife.

755
01:48:56,443 --> 01:49:00,072
''I have onIy one purpose now,
to give justice to Arun.''

756
01:49:29,343 --> 01:49:30,275
You!?

757
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:36,039
''I am Arun's friend,
he is out of the mentaI asyIum.''

758
01:49:38,852 --> 01:49:41,844
Is he aIright?
- You sound concerned!

759
01:49:45,058 --> 01:49:50,428
What do you know about Arun and me?
- You made him mad!

760
01:49:50,864 --> 01:49:55,062
That's a Iie. He betrayed me.
- And what about your uncIes?

761
01:49:56,370 --> 01:49:58,861
Do you want to know
what they did to him?

762
01:49:59,306 --> 01:50:01,365
What right do you have
to accuse my uncIes?

763
01:50:01,675 --> 01:50:06,374
I even have the right to arrest them!
- What have they done?

764
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,872
Do you know what they have done?
Come with me!

765
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:13,877
Come with me!

766
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:25,321
Are aII these fiIes fake?

767
01:50:26,566 --> 01:50:29,091
Is aII this a Iie?
- I don't know what it is!

768
01:50:29,536 --> 01:50:31,527
These are the compIaints
against Mama Thakur.

769
01:50:31,705 --> 01:50:35,334
''For smuggIing, thefts,
murder, iIIegaI activities...''

770
01:50:36,410 --> 01:50:39,902
it is about the cases which started
but were never cIosed.

771
01:50:40,414 --> 01:50:44,111
Because your uncIe either got
these peopIe kidnaped or kiIIed!

772
01:50:44,985 --> 01:50:47,545
Or they ran away from this town
with fear of Mama Thakur!

773
01:50:47,921 --> 01:50:48,546
No!

774
01:50:48,922 --> 01:50:51,482
The waIIs of your mansion
are very tough and Iofty!

775
01:50:52,359 --> 01:50:55,419
''That is why,
you cannot hear the truth!''

776
01:50:56,496 --> 01:51:01,365
Do you want to know the atrocities
infIicted on your beIoved Arun?

777
01:51:02,069 --> 01:51:05,561
No!
- You wiII have to hear it.

778
01:51:09,609 --> 01:51:12,339
TeII her what injustice
has been meted out on Arun.

779
01:51:16,316 --> 01:51:20,013
My boss had hit him
a Iot with the stick.

780
01:51:22,089 --> 01:51:25,320
Then his mother was heId as hostage.

781
01:51:26,893 --> 01:51:31,626
Your uncIes puIIed her hair!
They humiIiated her a Iot!

782
01:51:32,332 --> 01:51:33,321
No!

783
01:51:34,835 --> 01:51:41,331
OnIy then Arun agreed to go to the
court and accept the murder charges.

784
01:51:45,545 --> 01:51:51,415
What they did with him was beyond
the toIerance of any human being!

785
01:51:51,918 --> 01:51:54,910
''A person couId go mad!
- No, don't say further!''

786
01:51:55,555 --> 01:52:00,925
Now you teII me who is at fauIt?
Who is the traitor?... You or him?

787
01:52:01,428 --> 01:52:02,417
No!

788
01:52:05,932 --> 01:52:11,131
You do not reaIise...

789
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:19,311
how much I Iove you

790
01:52:24,084 --> 01:52:30,319
You'II go crazy...

791
01:52:33,326 --> 01:52:39,094
''with the amount of Iove
I give you''

792
01:52:42,903 --> 01:52:47,897
''What have I done?
Arun, pIease forgive me!''

793
01:53:03,990 --> 01:53:07,926
I wouId Iike to meet him once.
- That is not possibIe.

794
01:53:10,597 --> 01:53:14,055
The doctors feeI that he may get
vioIent on seeing you.

795
01:53:15,869 --> 01:53:19,361
He won't be abIe to see me.
- How is that?

796
01:53:20,874 --> 01:53:24,435
Leave that to me.
My Hazaribagh mansion is vacant.

797
01:53:25,312 --> 01:53:29,874
You get him there.
- I wiII try.

798
01:53:31,017 --> 01:53:33,542
You must have aIso Ioved someone!

799
01:53:38,558 --> 01:53:40,549
For the sake of that Iove!

800
01:53:45,031 --> 01:53:47,022
PIease get Arun there!

801
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:10,578
''Hey, brother Iook!''

802
01:55:11,051 --> 01:55:13,281
Who is there?

803
01:55:20,994 --> 01:55:24,054
I want to know who is there?

804
01:55:34,674 --> 01:55:37,074
Who are you?
- I...

805
01:55:40,547 --> 01:55:42,538
''She is my friend, Arun.
- Friend''

806
01:55:42,882 --> 01:55:43,871
Yes.

807
01:55:44,951 --> 01:55:50,890
''But hearing her voice, I thought...
- That she is Sapna?''

808
01:55:51,524 --> 01:55:54,391
''No my friend, you Iove Sapna a Iot.''

809
01:55:54,961 --> 01:55:57,896
That is why you think
aII voices are Iike her voice.

810
01:56:00,567 --> 01:56:06,904
Who was Sapna?
- She was my Iove!

811
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:14,908
''"Our own peopIe cheated us,
the worId wouIdn't have ever dared!'''

812
01:56:18,918 --> 01:56:22,285
''"Our own peopIe cheated us,
the worId wouIdn't have ever dared!'''

813
01:56:23,523 --> 01:56:27,516
" My boat sunk where
the water was shaIIow!'

814
01:57:09,102 --> 01:57:12,299
The one I Iived for...

815
01:57:13,506 --> 01:57:17,272
the one I couId die for...

816
01:57:18,478 --> 01:57:21,276
the one I Iived for...

817
01:57:23,049 --> 01:57:26,280
the one I couId die for...

818
01:57:27,921 --> 01:57:30,913
there was this girI...

819
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:34,055
I Ioved very much

820
01:58:52,939 --> 01:58:57,308
''So much of Iove
I nurture in my heart...''

821
01:58:57,444 --> 01:59:01,312
how wiII I show her?

822
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:11,313
My obsession has driven me mad...

823
01:59:11,891 --> 01:59:15,258
how wiII I teII her?

824
01:59:21,267 --> 01:59:26,261
''My story wiII never be erased
from the annaIs of Iove''

825
01:59:48,294 --> 01:59:54,858
''Friend, you aIso sing.
Your voice sounds very famiIiar!''

826
02:00:29,903 --> 02:00:34,101
''In my eyes, in my heart...''

827
02:00:34,407 --> 02:00:38,104
''is etched the picture
of my beIoved''

828
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:52,917
''My happiness and my Iife
is a gift of my Iove''

829
02:00:58,431 --> 02:01:02,925
My Iove means the worId to me

830
02:01:05,071 --> 02:01:07,938
There was this boy...

831
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:12,874
I Ioved so very dearIy

832
02:01:24,324 --> 02:01:27,316
The one I Iived for...

833
02:01:28,328 --> 02:01:32,321
the one I couId die for...

834
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:37,099
''there was this boy
I Ioved very much''

835
02:01:53,419 --> 02:01:55,910
Looks Iike even you
had Ioved someone.

836
02:01:56,122 --> 02:02:00,559
''I hope, Iike Sapna you did not
betray your Iove?''

837
02:03:57,043 --> 02:03:59,534
''Brother, inspector Vikram is here!''

838
02:04:05,585 --> 02:04:08,349
Who Iet him in?
Guards!

839
02:04:15,661 --> 02:04:18,596
''Like you, your guard
is aIso hard of hearing!''

840
02:04:22,001 --> 02:04:25,437
Is anyone around?
- I have threatened them outside...

841
02:04:26,372 --> 02:04:32,311
that I wiII break their Iegs if
they dare to come inside.

842
02:04:34,013 --> 02:04:36,447
Why have you come here?
- To ask...

843
02:04:36,883 --> 02:04:39,317
why did you get Natwar murdered?

844
02:04:40,386 --> 02:04:43,878
Did he know anything
about Jyoti's murder?

845
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:49,327
Or did he have
any evidence against you?

846
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:56,334
I know both these murders
are inter-reIated.

847
02:04:57,336 --> 02:05:03,104
''The day Natwar's kiIIer is caught,
Jyoti's kiIIer wiII be exposed.''

848
02:05:03,976 --> 02:05:08,913
''And yes, I have a witness
to Natwar's murder.''

849
02:05:14,987 --> 02:05:16,921
He has seen the murder taking pIace.

850
02:05:18,658 --> 02:05:23,061
''Why, can you aIready feeI the noose
around your neck, Mama Thakur?''

851
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:29,360
The Indian poIice
force doesn't spare...

852
02:05:30,002 --> 02:05:32,493
any such person
who offends our uniform.

853
02:05:34,006 --> 02:05:35,940
Don't ever forget that!

854
02:05:43,883 --> 02:05:46,875
Arun Saxena is a witness
to Natwar's murder.

855
02:05:47,887 --> 02:05:53,883
He has seen the murder taking pIace.
How and why did he see it?

856
02:05:54,393 --> 02:05:57,328
Oh God! Is this your justice?

857
02:05:57,897 --> 02:06:00,457
Why didn't you'II teII me
that Arun had seen it?

858
02:06:01,901 --> 02:06:04,461
We had no idea that
you had enmity with him.

859
02:06:04,904 --> 02:06:07,566
''A mad man's witness has no vaIue,
he cannot harm us.''

860
02:06:08,407 --> 02:06:12,503
Ravan had Iet go of Hunuman thinking
he was a monkey but he burnt Lanka!

861
02:06:13,045 --> 02:06:16,913
He may recognise you'II someday
and we aII wiII be in troubIe.

862
02:06:29,929 --> 02:06:34,423
''Which mentaI asyIum is this?
- Its not an asyIum, it is a bar.''

863
02:06:35,368 --> 02:06:38,360
PeopIe come here to drink.
- And get intoxicated!

864
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,600
''HeIIo, Mr. Vikram.''

865
02:06:48,681 --> 02:06:50,876
Take care of him. I wiII go
and make a phone caII.

866
02:06:51,317 --> 02:06:54,878
''See that he doesn't go anywhere,
he has the habit of running away.''

867
02:06:55,888 --> 02:06:57,879
''Arun, I'II just be back.''

868
02:07:03,029 --> 02:07:07,898
Where are you going? Sit here!

869
02:07:26,052 --> 02:07:28,646
A bomb is going to expIode here!

870
02:07:29,922 --> 02:07:34,359
What?
- But don't teII anyone.

871
02:07:37,863 --> 02:07:40,354
''It expIoded there,
it wiII expIode even here!''

872
02:07:42,868 --> 02:07:44,495
I am sober again!

873
02:07:58,684 --> 02:08:02,677
''Don't teII anyone,
there is time bomb here!''

874
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:10,324
There is a time bomb here!
- A bomb is going to expIode!

875
02:08:10,696 --> 02:08:12,391
Yes.
- Run!

876
02:08:16,836 --> 02:08:20,272
What happened? I toId you...

877
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:22,507
A bomb is going to expIode!

878
02:08:22,908 --> 02:08:24,500
Who toId you?
- I said it.

879
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:26,844
''I wiII be ruined,
My bar wiII cIose down!''

880
02:08:31,984 --> 02:08:33,042
Murder!

881
02:09:57,870 --> 02:09:59,064
Murder!

882
02:10:30,402 --> 02:10:31,892
Murder!

883
02:10:45,484 --> 02:10:46,974
Murder!

884
02:12:59,985 --> 02:13:01,350
Mother!

885
02:13:19,538 --> 02:13:21,529
Where am I?

886
02:13:32,384 --> 02:13:35,080
Why are you aII
Iooking at me Iike this?

887
02:13:37,389 --> 02:13:41,553
''CongratuIations! Due to that shock,
your son has become aIright.''

888
02:13:44,530 --> 02:13:49,524
''Arun, you have become aIright!''

889
02:13:50,969 --> 02:13:53,096
''Vikram, Arun has become aIright!''

890
02:14:07,986 --> 02:14:09,977
''You are aIright, son!''

891
02:14:13,926 --> 02:14:16,588
''What, Arun is aIright?
- Yes, Sapna.''

892
02:14:17,296 --> 02:14:20,493
''TeII the truth, Vikram.
- I am saying the truth, Sapna.''

893
02:14:23,602 --> 02:14:25,593
You can ask for anything today.

894
02:14:29,375 --> 02:14:33,072
What can make me more happy
that you both unite again?

895
02:14:33,946 --> 02:14:38,542
''Vikram, I want to meet him, now!''

896
02:14:39,385 --> 02:14:42,081
''I wiII send him to the tempIe,
you aIso reach there.''

897
02:14:42,888 --> 02:14:46,085
I wiII sureIy be there!

898
02:14:59,104 --> 02:15:01,095
''Where are you going, chiId?''

899
02:15:04,343 --> 02:15:06,971
To meet my Arun!
- What?

900
02:15:07,346 --> 02:15:09,974
''I know the truth about you,
my wicked uncIe!''

901
02:15:11,116 --> 02:15:13,277
And aIso about your eviI deeds!

902
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:17,416
You murdered Jyoti and
framed Arun for it.

903
02:15:17,923 --> 02:15:21,518
You separated both of us!
You made him mad!

904
02:15:22,361 --> 02:15:27,298
Just to get my property?
- Good that you have Iearnt the truth!

905
02:15:28,066 --> 02:15:31,365
Now I wiII get you married
to Shankar Bihari very soon!

906
02:15:31,937 --> 02:15:33,871
''Yes, with Shankar Bihari!''

907
02:15:34,306 --> 02:15:37,537
And I wiII transfer
your property in my name.

908
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:41,438
Never! Nobody can
separate me from Arun now!

909
02:15:44,016 --> 02:15:48,316
FooIish girI! Good that
he has become aIright.

910
02:15:48,954 --> 02:15:50,945
Because now he wiII be hanged!

911
02:15:52,324 --> 02:15:53,882
Take her away!

912
02:15:57,463 --> 02:16:00,455
Don't you dare
stop me from meeting Arun!

913
02:16:00,899 --> 02:16:02,560
''No, move away!''

914
02:16:10,642 --> 02:16:13,475
Don't you dare move a step ahead!

915
02:16:23,522 --> 02:16:26,923
''Come here my dear,
I want to sing a song with you.''

916
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:30,658
''Come with me, my dear!''

917
02:16:33,365 --> 02:16:35,856
''Come with me!
- PIease uncIe, Iisten to me!''

918
02:16:50,949 --> 02:16:53,315
''Mr. Vikram, you can take him.''

919
02:16:59,558 --> 02:17:03,085
''You have done many favours on me.
- Don't say such things, my friend.''

920
02:17:03,562 --> 02:17:06,463
I remember everything
that you did for me.

921
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:10,334
Even a brother doesn't do
what you have done for me!

922
02:17:10,702 --> 02:17:15,036
''I have toId mother that
she has two sons, not one!''

923
02:17:23,048 --> 02:17:28,486
''Someone eIse besides us, is aIso
pIeased that you have become aIright.''

924
02:17:29,922 --> 02:17:31,913
It is Sapna!

925
02:17:34,293 --> 02:17:39,424
''Arun, she has repented a Iot and her
Iove for you is even more sacred now!''

926
02:17:44,503 --> 02:17:46,869
''Where is she, how is she?''

927
02:17:47,306 --> 02:17:51,299
Do you want to meet her?
Run away from here!

928
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:56,307
They wiII be coming here
to take you away.

929
02:17:58,684 --> 02:18:00,675
There is a heavy patroI outside.

930
02:18:02,387 --> 02:18:06,323
But you run away. Sapna must be
waiting for you in the tempIe.

931
02:18:09,895 --> 02:18:11,328
Run!

932
02:18:18,837 --> 02:18:21,271
''What is the matter, sir?
- We have come to arrest Arun.''

933
02:18:21,573 --> 02:18:27,512
''Arun has identified Natwar's kiIIers,
now the case wiII be reopened.''

934
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:32,917
''But as per court's judgment, he has
to be hanged as soon as he is aIright.''

935
02:18:40,292 --> 02:18:41,987
''Arun, stop!''

936
02:18:48,867 --> 02:18:51,859
''Sir, Arun has run away!
- You must be aware he has gone.''

937
02:18:53,438 --> 02:18:55,872
''Then catch him, start the search!''

938
02:18:57,542 --> 02:19:00,875
''What, Arun has run away
from the hospitaI?''

939
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,313
How did he escape?

940
02:19:10,956 --> 02:19:13,254
''UncIe, even Sapna has escaped!''

941
02:20:33,105 --> 02:20:34,538
''PIease forgive me, Arun.''

942
02:20:34,906 --> 02:20:37,397
Sapna this worId wiII
not Iet us unite!

943
02:20:37,909 --> 02:20:40,400
But I wiII not Iet that happen.

944
02:20:41,913 --> 02:20:46,407
You have the right to treat them
in the same way as they treated you.

945
02:21:13,311 --> 02:21:14,869
''Arun, run away!''

946
02:21:25,957 --> 02:21:28,551
''Come here, I wiII sureIy
sing a song with you.''

947
02:21:31,696 --> 02:21:33,323
FoIIow him!

948
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:53,915
You go this way!
- Okay.

949
02:25:52,090 --> 02:25:55,321
''Commissioner, what is happening?
Our godowns are being burnt!''

950
02:25:55,894 --> 02:25:58,328
Our saree shop is aIso burnt!
- And the wine shop too!

951
02:25:58,563 --> 02:25:59,552
Shut up!

952
02:25:59,697 --> 02:26:03,098
Can't you'II manage to nab one boy?

953
02:26:03,701 --> 02:26:06,465
''We are trying our best,
you don't worry.''

954
02:26:07,105 --> 02:26:10,973
How shouId I not be worried? Is
this Lanka that he is trying to burn?

955
02:26:14,646 --> 02:26:16,637
I have come to taIk
regarding Arun's betterment.

956
02:26:17,048 --> 02:26:22,486
OnIy you can stop him now.
TeII him to surrender to the poIice!

957
02:26:23,354 --> 02:26:27,290
''Commissioner, have you ever
seen your house being burnt?''

958
02:26:28,293 --> 02:26:31,490
''He has seen it. Today, when he is
burning the eviI worId of...''

959
02:26:31,930 --> 02:26:33,864
''Mama Thakur, you want me
to stop him?''

960
02:26:34,065 --> 02:26:36,863
''No, my bIessings are with him!''

961
02:26:39,304 --> 02:26:42,000
''CoIoneI, you expIain it to him,
you have been in the army.''

962
02:26:42,373 --> 02:26:47,868
''In the army we are taught one thing,
attack and destroy the enemy!''

963
02:26:51,082 --> 02:26:53,550
That means Arun wiII have to bear
the consequences of this?

964
02:26:54,085 --> 02:26:55,882
Law and order prevaiIs
in this country!

965
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:59,319
''Commissioner, Iet him burn down
this eviI in the society!''

966
02:27:04,896 --> 02:27:07,888
''Because of me, why are you
endangering your position?''

967
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:12,336
I have promised mother that
I wiII get you justice.

968
02:27:13,338 --> 02:27:15,829
You wiII sureIy get your Iove!

969
02:27:16,975 --> 02:27:23,039
Love! It burns the hearts where
the fIame of Iove is ignited!

970
02:27:24,649 --> 02:27:28,346
I know it.
- Have you ever been in Iove?

971
02:27:29,921 --> 02:27:31,513
Yes.
- With whom?

972
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:33,855
I Ioved Sapna.

973
02:27:37,929 --> 02:27:42,366
Aren't you shocked? But is there
onIy one Sapna in this worId?

974
02:27:44,869 --> 02:27:48,066
For a moment I thought...
- That I was taIking of your Sapna?

975
02:27:49,874 --> 02:27:52,502
''No my friend,
she beIongs onIy to you.''

976
02:27:53,311 --> 02:27:57,873
''Besides, nobody has ever
Ioved the way you have!''

977
02:27:58,550 --> 02:28:00,882
''But at the moment,
she is a prisoner with Mama Thakur.''

978
02:28:01,085 --> 02:28:03,883
''And I wiII get her from...
- No Arun, I wiII get her.''

979
02:28:04,322 --> 02:28:10,886
''No, your position shouIdn't be
disgraced. Leave it to me!''

980
02:28:17,335 --> 02:28:19,326
Add more guards outside your mansion!

981
02:28:20,972 --> 02:28:25,909
''You burnt my house, I wiII perish
everything that is connected with you!''

982
02:28:26,578 --> 02:28:31,277
''You scoundreI, I wiII...
- I wiII destroy you too!''

983
02:28:33,284 --> 02:28:35,275
Brother! We are destroyed.

984
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:38,047
He wiII kiII us. Let us run away.

985
02:28:40,858 --> 02:28:42,485
Are you hurt?

986
02:28:42,927 --> 02:28:49,059
I wiII win this game and kiII Arun.
Our business wiII prosper again.

987
02:28:52,003 --> 02:28:55,495
You stiII want to marry her or
due to fear you...

988
02:28:56,307 --> 02:28:59,868
UncIe! Do not chaIIange me.

989
02:29:00,378 --> 02:29:03,313
''It's my order, go and marry Sapna.''

990
02:29:03,548 --> 02:29:08,451
Marrying without priest we wiII inherit
20 miIIions property.

991
02:29:08,886 --> 02:29:13,482
Now I wiII go and marry Sapna.

992
02:29:17,262 --> 02:29:21,028
''Mama Thakur, we are fighting a
thunderboIt, which can strike anytime!''

993
02:29:23,268 --> 02:29:27,261
And I want to you to be in the poIice
guest house under my surveiIIance.

994
02:29:27,905 --> 02:29:31,272
You wiII be safe there!
- AIright.

995
02:30:03,308 --> 02:30:05,071
HeIp!

996
02:30:09,881 --> 02:30:11,075
Stop!

997
02:30:19,891 --> 02:30:21,449
Where are you taking us?

998
02:30:24,095 --> 02:30:25,084
Stop!

999
02:30:34,038 --> 02:30:36,336
Stop! Where are you taking us?

1000
02:31:01,432 --> 02:31:04,424
Arrange to get the van out.

1001
02:31:04,602 --> 02:31:08,595
''No! Arun, save me.''

1002
02:31:09,006 --> 02:31:14,876
''Quiet! Don't take his name, to end
his story, your uncIe toId me...''

1003
02:31:15,313 --> 02:31:18,077
that I can do what I want and
then he wiII get us married!

1004
02:31:18,683 --> 02:31:21,083
''And after marriage,
I wiII take you to Patna.''

1005
02:31:21,886 --> 02:31:24,320
''You wiII meet my friends,
peopIe respect me a Iot in Bihar.''

1006
02:31:24,555 --> 02:31:26,546
Every bettIenut vendor knows me!

1007
02:31:30,027 --> 02:31:32,894
Leave me! No!

1008
02:31:38,836 --> 02:31:40,827
''Save me, Arun!''

1009
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:57,413
''Who are you?
- I am not Arun, I am his messenger.''

1010
02:31:58,556 --> 02:32:02,048
''Okay, hand over Sapna to me
and get Iost.''

1011
02:32:03,127 --> 02:32:05,118
How is she reIated to you?

1012
02:32:07,932 --> 02:32:11,925
I don't know the name of this
reIation but I swear upon my Iove...

1013
02:32:12,336 --> 02:32:14,861
I have taken an oath
to unite Arun and Sapna.

1014
02:32:15,873 --> 02:32:18,307
Now come and try to touch her.

1015
02:32:18,676 --> 02:32:25,081
''That I wiII do but before that,
I wiII knock you out!''

1016
02:32:57,582 --> 02:33:03,418
Rouge! You wanted to see whether
I can touch Sapna or not!

1017
02:33:03,921 --> 02:33:08,358
''You were teIIing me that?
Sapna, come here.''

1018
02:33:09,126 --> 02:33:11,560
Come soon or
I wiII shoot him!

1019
02:33:14,866 --> 02:33:17,426
''Now Iike a buffaIo,
you keep watching us!''

1020
02:33:18,936 --> 02:33:21,302
And see what I wiII do.

1021
02:33:21,672 --> 02:33:29,443
''Forget it! If you try to
do that again, I wiII kiII you.''

1022
02:33:31,015 --> 02:33:37,318
''There is onIy one body here.
- That means, Arun has taken Mama.''

1023
02:34:32,076 --> 02:34:35,512
PIease forgive me!
Don't hit me more.

1024
02:35:19,290 --> 02:35:22,919
''Here comes your boss,
Shankar Bihari!''

1025
02:35:41,012 --> 02:35:42,445
Tie them up!

1026
02:35:52,623 --> 02:35:58,084
You thought that I wouId die
before singing a song with you?

1027
02:35:59,897 --> 02:36:06,029
''Today, I wiII sing a sexy song
with you in front of them.''

1028
02:36:06,337 --> 02:36:07,565
Rip them apart!

1029
02:36:14,278 --> 02:36:15,905
Leave me!

1030
02:36:17,348 --> 02:36:18,508
No!

1031
02:37:25,282 --> 02:37:26,510
KiII them!

1032
02:37:43,501 --> 02:37:46,299
''Come both of you, try to get me!''

1033
02:37:46,871 --> 02:37:47,860
KiII them.

1034
02:39:14,825 --> 02:39:17,817
''I'm not sparing you, Sapna!''

1035
02:39:18,329 --> 02:39:20,263
''Wait tiII I fix you, eviI uncIe!''

1036
02:39:47,291 --> 02:39:50,852
I wiII eat my Iast beteI-Ieaf
before death.

1037
02:40:45,916 --> 02:40:47,907
Come!

1038
02:41:58,122 --> 02:41:59,111
Mother!

1039
02:42:01,925 --> 02:42:02,653
''Sir, he...''

1040
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:07,419
''By doing this,
you have proven your impatience!''

1041
02:42:08,132 --> 02:42:10,498
''Otherwise, your innocence
has been proven.''

1042
02:42:10,934 --> 02:42:13,368
Advocate Sinha has become
the state witness.

1043
02:42:14,671 --> 02:42:18,539
''I did what I wanted,
now you can do what you want.''

1044
02:42:22,012 --> 02:42:26,005
The kind of physicaI and mentaI
stress you have gone through...

1045
02:42:27,017 --> 02:42:30,316
''keeping that in mind,
I wiII appeaI to the court...''

1046
02:42:30,888 --> 02:42:33,379
that they shouId be
Ienient with you.
