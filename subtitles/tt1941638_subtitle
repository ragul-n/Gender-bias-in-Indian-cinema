Joined by Andy
Towns at your service.

18
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,240
Now, look at this!

19
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,407
Got a chance.

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,018
He got his head to it.
But couldn't redirect it.

21
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,781
Having find a way through.

22
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,887
Played that well. Great
positional play. Good ball!

23
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,394
Now, they have to pick him up here.

24
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,621
Shoot. How good was that!

25
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,129
Stunner. Absolute stunner.

26
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:17,032
"This is not a house.
It's a clock tower."

27
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:23,865
"It's a screeching,
screaming house."

28
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,873
"This is not a house.
It's a clock tower."

29
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,388

screaming house."

30

00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:49,060

landlord Chaddha asked for rent."

33
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,305
"Our den."

34
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,645
"Friends' den."

35
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,987
"Our den."

36
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,456
"Our den."

37
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,297
"There is a border of insanity."

38
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,434
"No line of control."

39
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,979
"Here, love is measured by abuses."

40
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,107
"Guests are made to do chores."

41
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:44,384
"Every issue is solved with a puff."

42
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,652
"Puff over. Breath has stalled."

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,228
"And it becomes a panic issue."

"Everything here is broken."

49
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,224
"There is a whiff of burnt food."

50
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,887
"We built caste in the air."

51
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,760
"We grow money plant in our mind."

52
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:34,169
"We have sessions of
tea on an empty-stomach."

53
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,201
"Milk is over.
Conversation has stalled."

54
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,347
"Everybody wants to go
to Chaddha's house."

55
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:51,213
"As soon as we ring the bell,
Sweetie Chaddha opens the door."

56
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:08,100
"We have left home in
quest of our destination."

57
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:14,407
"We have left home in
quest of our destination."

58
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:20,578
"We have made this den
a part of our life."

59
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,658
You are a symbol of auspiciousness.

60
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,792
Lord Ram, along with Lakhan
and Sita reside in your heart.

61
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,995
Glory to Lord Ram and Sita!

62
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,797
Who is disturbing us
early in the morning?

63
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,670
Glory to Lord Ram!

64
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,976
All sleep anyhow, anywhere.

65
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,851
I have to hop.

66
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,345
Scoundrel. It's offensive.

67
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,114
It's 10 o'clock. Come on. Wake up.

68
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,486
We get only Sundays.

69
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,918
Why are you waking us up?

70
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,786
Even stables are cleaner.

71
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,123
Jogi, right?
- You fool.

72
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,662
Wake up. Make tea.

73
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,098
Today is Irfan's turn.
- It's Rajat's turn.

74
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,662
Get up, Samir.

75
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,032
Kabir.

76
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,170
Where is Safal?

77
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,798
I made it yesterday.

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,268
Jogi.
- Yes.

79
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,537
Wake up. Make tea.

80
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,647
Why are you harping on
my name in the morning?

81
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,872
The chart has been
put up in the kitchen.

82
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,107
We will find out whose turn it is.

83
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,650
Jogi. Jogi, make tea.

84
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,650
Yes. So bring the chart.

85
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,812
What is this?

86
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,047
You should have made it.
- Oh, no.

87
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,390
Morning tea.

88
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,794
Morning tea. Morning tea.

89
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,697
Who will make it? Who will make it?

90
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,201
Irfan.

91
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,333
Come on. Go and make tea.
- Come on.

92
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,965
Make tea.
- Wake up.

93
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,634
Make tea.
- What is this?

94
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,541
No need to be so happy.

95
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,544
Something else is
also written. Listen.

96
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,843
Safal will make breakfast.

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,075
Kabir will clean the
kitchen and wash vessels.

98
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,551
Oh, no.
- Samir will clean the toilet.

99
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,848
Irfan will cook lunch.

100
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,651
Rajat will make the evening tea.

101
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,521
And Jogi will cook dinner.

102
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,366
Jogi, what is this?

103
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,092
You have to make breakfast.
- So?

104
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,870
Wake them up when it's made.

105
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:24,068
And tea? - It will be
morning for them when they wake up.

106
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,435
Until then lie down here
thinking it's a platform.

107
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,180
The train is two hours late.

108
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,011
Don't show me your bum
early in the morning.

109
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,277
Is that so?

110
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,184
When would you like to see it?

111
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,018
Quiet. The train is two hours late.

112
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,251
I will show you.

113
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,089
I should wash the vessels too?

114
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,594
Jogi.

115
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,071
Your show has begun.
You are not going?

116
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,733
My entry is after ten minutes.

117
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,638
Have you dropped the
idea of going to Mumbai?

118
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,775
I will go whenever they call me.

119
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,448
I am happy with theatre.

120
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,818
I want to make a name for myself
in theatre like Habib Tanvir.

121
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,093
I want to bring theatre
to the Broadway level.

122
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,892
I have even decided the
name of my group. - What?

123
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,055
Art and soul.

124
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,996
Where is Samir? It's Samir's entry.

125
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,569
Do you remember your lines?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,437
Come on. Take your entry.

127
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,447
I am not God.
I am not his relative.

128
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,477
Get out.

129
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,820
If I don't perform, people will
ask for the refund of their ticket.

130
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,824
I will slap you. You
will come to your senses.

131
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,128
Come on. Leave.

132
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,457
Leave.

133
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:56,259
If anybody finds out,
I won't spare you.

134
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,267
Come on. Leave.

135
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,171
The analysis of our
performance this week.

136
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,644
As you can see, Rajat and Irfan
are holding number one position...

137
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,285
...since the past two weeks.

138
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,546
So we are hopeful one of them...

139
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,286
...will win Our Den
King crown this month.

140
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,056
Jogi, that is fine. But tell me.

141
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,557
What will this
week's lowest scorer do?

142
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,226
Loser has only two choices.

143
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,506
He will either treat everyone with
beer or do the household chores.

144
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,237
He will either treat everyone with
beer or do the household chores.

145
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,538
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

146
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,704
Has someone done something?
- What?

147
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,075
What about money?
- Look.

148
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,911
I am preparing the design.
My presentation is next week.

149
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,520
Understood?
- Look here.

150
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,916
This week I sold three
water purifiers. - Is that so?

151
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,183
Three.
- Listen.

152
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,921
Who got A++ in the fourth semester?
- Him.

153
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,023
Jogi.

154
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,596
Is dinner ready?

155
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,099
What did he do? Come. Come. Come.

156
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,827
What did he do?

157
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,232
Listen. What did he do?

158
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,569
He is the only one who is
sticking to his guns. - Amazing!

159
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,344
Safal has to sit for
civil service exam.

160
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,674
He is studying hard day and night.

161
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,338
Why are you harassing him?

162
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,245
Friends, Jogi's performance board...

163
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,955
...mirrors our endeavors.

164
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,751
Nobody remembers attempters.

165
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,559
We have to do it.

166
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,363
Yes!

167
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,767
Yes!

168
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,032
Listen, the one who is
the most successful man...

169
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,300
...I will be with him.

170
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,739
You fool.
- Jogi.

171
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,038
We have still not achieved success.

172
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,772
And you are
already eying our wealth.

173
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,752
Good afternoon, sir.

174
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,658
Sir, Kabir Asthana.
From Eureka Forbes.

175
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,158
Sir, what precaution
do you use for water?

176
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,127
Sir, we have launched
a new product.

177
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,463
It's made from the
latest Nano silver technology.

178
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,802
Sir, if you use it, you
will get clean and pure water.

179
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,966
Shall I show you a demonstration?
- Prakash.

180
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,737
Wait. Wait, scoundrel.

181
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,742
Wait.

182
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,315
How did you come inside?

183
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,816
Yes, Kavya.

184
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,822
Today, I went for an interview.

185
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,493
Let's see what happens.

186
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,264
I also miss you a lot, Kavya.

187
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,431
It's very difficult, isn't it?

188
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,975
I don't know.

189
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,177
See her.
- Yes.

190
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,184
I am talking about Sunaina.
And not you.

191
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,049
Yes.

192
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,849
Oh, my. See her attitude.

193
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,788
Today she will kill us.

194
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,954
Keep the coach. I will
give up jogging. I swear.

195
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,227
I will pay her instead.
- Cut to.

196
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,994
See her respectfully.
She is your sister-in-law.

197
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,397
Yes.

198
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,799
Kabir.

199
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,233
Come quickly. Our half
naked gals have come.

200
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,803
You...

201
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,011
Irfan, why are you
causing problems?

202
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,373
Will you get me into trouble?

203
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,174
I was talking to my fiancée.
And you...

204
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,683
Forget it. Kavya is
available 24 hours.

205
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,715
Keep the phone on the side.
And take your eye tonic.

206
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,425
Look, today she is looking hot.

207
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,996
See her once.
- Yes.

208
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,032
They are surely talking about us.

209
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,071
Like us they also have
a lot of fun.

210
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,039
And we are accused of being cheap.

211
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,241
If they do it, it's actual.

212
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,245
If we do it, it's sexual.

213
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,346
It's Kavya's call. Control it.

214
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,349
Don't ruffle my hair.
- Yes, Kavya.

215
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,616
Look at her.

216
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,585
No, Kavya. I didn't hang up.
It got disconnected.

217
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,628
What? Half naked gals?

218
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,862
Yes.

219
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,963
It's Samir's new play's title.

220
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,104
Irfan was talking about that.

221
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,465
No, Kavya. What are you saying?

222
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,939
It's not a cheap play.

223
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,136
It's on spirituality.
- Legs (Tang).

224
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,216
Hello. Hello. Hello.

225
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,315
Got me into trouble.
- Hello.

226
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,285
Yes, Kavya.

227
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,880
Legs?

228
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,282
Yes. Hang it (Tang).

229
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,129
Yes. Rajat has got a new calendar.

230
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,788
We were wondering where
to hang it in the house.

231
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,625
It's a very nice calendar.

232
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,662
I am at home, Kavya.

233
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,600
In the balcony. With everyone.

234
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:11,844
Yes. You see, at this hour
it is nice and breezy outside.

235
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,349
This hot breeze
cools the eyes a lot.

236
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,088
One cigarette was left.

237
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,492
He finished it off
thinking it is Complan. Scoundrel.

238
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,027
Hi.
- Good morning.

239
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,831
Good morning. - Looking nice.

240
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,099
Thank you.

241
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,799
She is new.
- Hi.

242
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,104
She wears anything.
- What problem do you have?

243
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,508
Do your work.

244
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,811
Hi.
- Hi.

245
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,172
Where is Irfan?
- There.

246
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,509
Good morning, hot hunk.

247
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,948
Hi.

248
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,655
Sorry. I couldn't
sleep the whole night.

249
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,190
Today, you are giving
presentation to the boss? - Yes.

250
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,993
Come on. Show me.

251
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,726
See.

252
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,465
It's wonderful!
- Thanks.

253
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,732
Radhe, did boss ask for me?

254
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,564
Yes. Twice.

255
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,677
Oh, no.

256
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,082
No need to be so nervous.

257
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,345
He can't reject this design.

258
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,682
I hope.

259
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,724
And today you are asking me out.

260
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,023
Come on. All the best.

261
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,096
Come. I will take
you out for dinner.

262
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,045
Hurry up. The metro will
get crowded. - Yes. Let's go.

263
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,444
Irfan.

264
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,974
Will you get up?

265
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,052
Or from tomorrow
should I spread the rumor...

266
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,589
...that your intention turned
bad when you saw me alone?

267
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,288
I like to tease you.

268
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,966
I wish I didn't have a boyfriend.

269
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:47,065
I wouldn't have let a hot man
like you escape from my clutches.

270
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,073
Stop blushing and get up.

271
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,314
Listen. Do you
have to catch a train?

272
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,128
Hi. How are you?

273
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,167
You have come to pick me up?
Outside the office.

274
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,664
It's not a surprise. It's a shock.

275
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,104
But I have planned to
go out with a friend.

276
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,873
No.

277
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,106
I will manage.

278
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,443
You go. I will manage.
- Okay.

279
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,847
I will manage.

280
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,179
Bye.

281
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,492
'Safal, good wishes to you.'

282
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,556
'Son, I was very happy
when you passed the exams.'

283
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,460
'I pray to God that
you pass the interview.'

284
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,326
'I am sending you money
by mortgaging... '

285
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,838
'... your grandfather's fields.'

286
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,901
'Now, I don't have
anything left to give.'

287
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,170
'My hopes are on you.'

288
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,813
'This is your last chance.'

289
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,050
'The entire family is eager to see
you become a collector, magistrate.'

290
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,355
'Don't disappoint us.'

291
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,682
Give me a kiss.

292
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,582
Please.

293
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,016
No. I won't let you go today.

294
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,719
Come on. Please.

295
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,261
Samir.

296
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,757
Samir.

297
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,462
Samir.

298
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,601
Jogi. - What happened, Jogi?
Why are you screaming so much?

299
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,036
I think he had a nightmare.

300
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,739
What happened?
- I don't know.

301
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,210
What happened, Jogi?

302
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,913
Don't feign innocence, scoundrel.

303
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,312
What did Samir do?

304
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,882
He mounted on me.
And held me tight.

305
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,814
Do you know what he said?

306
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,786
"Give me a kiss. Please."
- What?

307
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,284
Oh, no.

308
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:28,458
Samir, you know who
Jogi is, don't you?

309
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,659
I know it very well.
He is your cousin.

310
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,101
I also love him. Trust me.

311
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,298
Amazing!

312
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,307
During daytime he is Jogi.

313
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,274
At night he is your lover.

314
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,676
That love?

315
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,247
Lust has possessed him.

316
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,008
Get lost, sinner.

317
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,951
Why are you harassing me?

318
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,684
I was sleeping. I made a mistake.
I apologize. Fine?

319
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,019
I beg you. Okay?

320
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,253
It's okay. Nothing bad happened.

321
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,333
Look, if you want to apologize,
apologize to this hapless boy...

322
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,096
...whom you were going to rape.

323
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,033
Drink water.

324
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,502
I will show him.

325
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,310
Drink.
- No.

326
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:18,045
Don't touch me. I
have become unchaste.

327
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,982
I can't face anyone.

328
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,054
No, Jogi. No, my brother.

329
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,885
Samir, beat them.
They are raping us.

330
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,550
Run. Run.

331
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,491
Beat them.

332
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,462
Oh, no.

333
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,006
Where are you going?

334
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,534
I am leaving. Bye.

335
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,183
You were smoking, weren't you?

336
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,083
You will never give it up.

337
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,926
And you won't even say sorry.

338
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,831
Okay. Sorry.

339
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,895
Okay?

340
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,229
Come and say sorry to sir.
And join the group.

341
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,363
I won't say sorry to him.

342
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,338
Samir, you can't
live without acting.

343
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,536
If you don't do theater,
what will you do?

344
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,508
Sir. Sir. Sir.

345
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,615
Sir, a Hollywood film is
going to be shot in Rajasthan.

346
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,242
And sir, Will Smith and
Angelina Jolie are the stars.

347
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,379
And casting is going on for local
artists in M.F. Hussain gallery.

348
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,117
Sir, all ordinary
actors have reached there.

349
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,725
You should go there.

350
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,691
Sir, please. Please.

351
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,261
You don't need them. They need you.

352
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,867
Is that so? - Poor people
have come from Hollywood.

353
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,300
They are our guests.

354
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,928
Come and help them a bit. Please.

355
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,746
Your best friend.
- Buddy.

356
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,782
Samir Khanna.
National school of drama.

357
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,262
Sir, I had a girlfriend.

358
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,928
I took her to the movies.
I took her to the dinner.

359
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,935
I took her to the bar. And then
I took her to the guest house.

360
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,735
But she didn't let
me touch her, sir.

361
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,645
That basic need of life is also
a huge struggle in our country.

362
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,752
Sir, you lead a
better life. Trust me.

363
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,855
I am impressed.

364
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,817
Sorry.

365
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,758
Both of you have been
shortlisted for a prominent role.

366
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,797
Let's see who is selected.

367
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,133
All the best.
- Thank you.

368
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,166
Hey, buddy. Congrats.
- Thanks, bro.

369
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,478
Rajat, if you are not selected
in the campus interview today...

370
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,608
...have you thought what
you will do in the future?

371
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,279
What else?
I have to work in the US.

372
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,219
I will try again next year.

373
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,296
The list has been put up.
The list has been put up. Come.

374
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,364
Move. Move.

375
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,034
Rajat, your name.

376
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,704
Yes! Yes! Yes!

377
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,310
40% of the film is
going to be shot in India.

378
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,678
And my role is very strong.
- Wow!

379
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,476
The shoot will begin
after three months.

380
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,710
Before that workshops.

381
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,047
Do you know how much these
guys are paying me? - How much?

382
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,985
10 lakhs.
- Oh, God!

383
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,114
Yes!
- Yeah!

384
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,745
"You won't get any intimation."

385
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,683
"She will come stealthily."

386
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,694
"She will stretch her claws."

387
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,422
"Give it to me."

388
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,459
"You won't get any intimation."

389
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,761
"She will come stealthily.
- Yeah!"

390
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,133
"She will stretch her claws."

391
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,364
"Come on. Come on."

392
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:40,434
"She will devour you
lovingly as if you are a mouse."

393
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,111
"Cat. Cat. Cat."

394
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,618
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

395
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,484
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

396
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,716
"Let's go."

397
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,955
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

398
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,588
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

399
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,962
"Like that."

400
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,237
"Move to the beat."

401
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,671
"Don't spoil my romance."

402
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,246
"Don't fight with me in love."

403
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,779
"Don't spoil my romance."

404
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,118
"Don't fight with me in love."

405
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,350
"Clutching the claws,
acting smugly."

406
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,585
"She will wreak
havoc in your heart."

407
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,821
"In the magic of love."

408
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,454
"She will get entrapped."

409
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,663
"Yeah. Getting the groove now."

410
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:43,001
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

411
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:47,608
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

412
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:52,172
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

413
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,182
"Delhi's cat."

414
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,781
"Women looking like a wow."

415
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,049
"Anytime I see you
getting like now."

416
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,317
"Everybody seeing
and wondering how."

417
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,484
"Do you know I hit you like a paw?"

418
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,790
"I get all the girls I desire."

419
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,161
"No harm to say that."

420
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,869
"Delhi's cat."

421
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,572
"Why don't you listen to me?"

422
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,842
"Only the heart knows its nature."

423
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,178
"You will have to pay a heavy
price if you lock horns with me."

424
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,720
"I can teach wise people a lesson."

425
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,982
"Lovers don't understand."

426
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,251
"They dwell in the heart
and save their lives."

427
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,520
"They remain in a drunken stupor."

428
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,823
"When I walk with a gait."

429
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:43,867
"Delhi's cat."

430
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:48,338
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

431
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,501
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

432
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,906
"Let's go."

433
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,775
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

434
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,046
"Delhi's cat. Loving Delhi's cat."

435
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,213
"Delhi's cat."

436
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,218
"Meow."

437
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,261
Mr. Richard, this
land is without water.

438
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,299
Mr. Richard, this
land is without water.

439
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,870
Mr. Richard, this
land is without water.

440
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,139
Mr. Richard, this
land is without water.

441
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,607
Why are you harping on land
and water since a long time?

442
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,773
Why are you disturbing my studies?

443
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,643
Your civil service exams
are important for you.

444
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,583
The same way this is
also important for me.

445
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,953
If it's important, say it softly.

446
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,822
Mr. Richard, this
land is without water.

447
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,726
There is no water to drink.

448
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,391
You are crazy.

449
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,402
You don't pay rent on time.
And you act smugly.

450
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,164
What did you say?

451
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,499
Bihari, what did you say?

452
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,643
Look, don't insult me. I am
warning you. It will be very bad.

453
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,573
What will you do, Bihari?
- What will I do?

454
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,838
I will thrash you.
- What is this?

455
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,742
What are you doing? What's going on?

456
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,017
Leave me.

457
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,515
I can go and open the door.

458
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,352
Both of you will
have to promise me...

459
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,690
...that you will resume the
fight only after I come back.

460
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,095
Because I want to see who
thrashes the most. Okay?

461
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,768
It's a parcel from
your house. Come on, Jogi.

462
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,033
Serve it for everyone.

463
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,275
Mother has sent it.

464
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,006
Open it.

465
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,005
Wow!

466
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,042
If you interfere in my career,
I will kill you.

467
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,381
Scoundrel.
- What are you doing?

468
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,545
Scoundrel.

469
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,122
You interfere in my career.

470
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,226
I was studying. You disturbed me.

471
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,157
Come to your senses.

472
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,836
I didn't go home because of
all of you. And all of you...

473
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,669
Jogi, throw the 'Biryani'
(Flavored rice) in the dustbin.

474
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,807
Damn!

475
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,481
"Our den."

476
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,753
"Friends' den."

477
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,855
"Our den."

478
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,523
"Our den."

479
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,932
Jogi, I told you to
throw it in the dustbin.

480
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,731
I won't throw it. I won't throw it.

481
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,203
Do whatever you want.

482
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,739
Since the time I have
sniffed the aroma of 'Biryani'...

483
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:41,106
...I am dying to eat it.

484
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,441
So you eat it. Why are you
giving it to these scoundrels?

485
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:46,846
Mother has sent it so lovingly.
Why won't we eat?

486
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,043
I see.

487
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,586
You are so concerned about mother.

488
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,416
You should have
thought about him too.

489
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,954
He was talking rudely.

490
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,422
He could have spoken lovingly.

491
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,586
No, Samir. That's not so.
Have some pity on me.

492
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,097
My exams are after 15 days.

493
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,026
Did you see?

494
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,263
He has become an IAS officer.
He has become diplomatic.

495
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,369
Scoundrel.

496
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,238
Irfan.

497
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,209
Call up mother.

498
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,743
Mother.

499
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,374
Yes.

500
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,873
Yes. 'Biryani' was delicious,
mother.

501
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,947
Thank you, mother.

502
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,450
Yes.

503
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,718
Yes. I will give him the phone.

504
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,392
Yes, mother.

505
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,630
God wills I will give
you the good news soon.

506
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,974
Prayers? I say it, mother.

507
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,177
The house is near a mosque, mother.

508
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,942
I will call you later. Bye.

509
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,751
What kind of man are you, Irfan?

510
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,958
You lie to your mother on the
phone. Don't you feel ashamed?

511
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,363
If nothing else, at least
say your prayers on Friday.

512
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,100
Safal is right.

513
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,805
Your mother also tells you.

514
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,033
In the morning take a bath
and read 'Hanuman Chalisa'.

515
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,506
Do you ever read it?

516
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,273
You are not eating.

517
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,441
Everybody is immoral here.

518
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,778
Oh, Lord.

519
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,978
God, You are benevolent.

520
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,716
From next Friday onwards I
will surely say my prayers.

521
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,403
It's so yummy.

522
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,172
One cottage cheese kebab also.
- Yes.

523
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,089
Yeah.

524
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,925
Oh, God. His timing.

525
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,359
Hi.

526
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,025
Scoundrel, I am going to
give you such a news...

527
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,262
...that you will be shocked.

528
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,375
Tell me. What is it regarding?

529
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,945
Am I speaking to Irfan?

530
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,604
Yes. Irfan speaking.

531
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,181
You fool. Are you fine?

532
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,286
Yeah. I am fine. I am fine.

533
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,883
You are with your boss?

534
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,858
I am having lunch. You fool.

535
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,755
You are with a girl. You scoundrel.

536
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,594
You are enticing a girl.

537
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,733
Yes.

538
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,129
Shall I come?

539
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,598
Not required as of now.

540
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,974
Listen, you fool.

541
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,936
I have signed the film's contract.

542
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,306
I have got a cheque of 1 lakh.

543
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,242
What are you saying, you scoundrel?

544
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,648
Finish your lunch. We
will have coffee together.

545
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:14,584
Bye.

546
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,100
Ridhima, what is this?

547
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,503
Sir, Sripal construction company.

548
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,743
Company's costing file.

549
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,153
Check it.

550
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,813
If there is anything, let me know.

551
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,654
Okay.

552
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,024
Ridhima.

553
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,162
Yes, sir.

554
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,332
Stop calling me sir. We are friends.

555
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,609
Shall we go out for dinner today?

556
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,812
Not today. Today I
am not feeling well.

557
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,278
You can have lunch with
a Muslim in one plate.

558
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,848
And you have a problem
in having dinner with me.

559
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,148
Believe me. They
are not trustworthy.

560
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,224
All they care about
is their religion.

561
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,053
I have good judgment of people.

562
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,299
And keep your cheap
thinking with you.

563
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,130
Ridhima, I am your boss.

564
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:38,031
Sir, decide. Do you want
to be my friend or my boss?

565
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,872
Because this is how
I talk to my friends.

566
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,339
Father, I am sending Rs.50000.

567
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,416
Don't worry about my expenses.

568
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,316
What?

569
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,550
You won't be able
to spend Rs.50000?

570
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,689
No. No need to
deposit it in the bank.

571
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,258
Father, at least
have fun in old age.

572
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,761
Okay. I will call you later.

573
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,960
She is not any ordinary girl.
She is a tempest.

574
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,396
Don't look there, you fool.

575
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,598
I will lose her.

576
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,205
Will you be able to woo her?
- She is interested in me.

577
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,368
She is flirting with me
for the past ten minutes.

578
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,407
Don't show your cheapness.

579
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,212
I have seen her somewhere.

580
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,919
It's an old dialogue.
Keep your mouth shut.

581
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,158
She is the same girl who
comes in my dreams. Yes.

582
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,288
See her in your dreams.
I don't have any problem.

583
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,592
Just don't look there.

584
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,803
If you spoil my romance, I will
beat you less and drag you more.

585
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,001
Will you give me a party?

586
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,578
What are you reading?
- Come on.

587
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,178
Look in the front.
- What?

588
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,981
Look in the front.

589
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,781
He is the same boy whose play...

590
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,356
...we watched the other day, right?

591
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,851
Checkered shirt?

592
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,364
Seems to be him.

593
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:42,790
They are talking about us.

594
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,534
The other boy is also cute.

595
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,942
Okay. Is he looking here?

596
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,439
He is giving you a royal ignore.

597
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,878
You are getting too excited.
Sit straight.

598
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,116
He will see.

599
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,178
Just see.

600
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,730
She is very desperate.

601
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,296
Shreya, the other boy
is getting confused.

602
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,202
Is that so?
- Yes.

603
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,301
Approach her. Approach her.

604
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,036
Before he comes, get up.

605
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,817
She is leaving. Go.
- Shall I go?

606
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,349
No. I am going.
- Okay.

607
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,684
Idiot.

608
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,993
He is following us.
- Ignore him. Keep walking.

609
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,922
Excuse me.

610
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,227
Yeah?

611
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,761
Hi.

612
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,601
You didn't recognize me?

613
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,675
Sorry. Have we met?

614
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,183
No. I think we
have not met properly.

615
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,745
We have not even said hi or hello.

616
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,114
Hi. I am Irfan.

617
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,420
No. I want to remind you
that something was going on...

618
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,430
...between us inside
the coffee shop.

619
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,031
Now, you are giving
me a royal ignore.

620
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,726
Excuse me.

621
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,934
Come on. Accept that
you were checking me out.

622
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,235
Have you see your
face in the mirror?

623
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,401
I see it everyday.

624
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,138
Touch wood. I don't feel
like taking my eyes off.

625
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,790
Ma'am, on behalf of all boys,
I want to request all girls.

626
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,620
When you flirt, be thorough.

627
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,086
Don'tjust relish and then leave.

628
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,488
You don't know. We
get touchy easily.

629
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:01,227
Guys, on behalf of all girls,
I want to request all boys.

630
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:05,598
Yes. - Don't be so confused.
Use your brain.

631
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,478
I was checking out your friend.

632
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,272
Not you.

633
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,479
He was dumb. And you
turned out to be duffer.

634
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,919
Let's go. Whatever.

635
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,850
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

636
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,958
Sister-in-law.

637
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,599
Shall I call him?

638
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,866
I am single.

639
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,643
But not available.

640
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,171
Your friend has
three days to find me.

641
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,646
I just want to see how
far he can chase me.

642
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,111
And you know what?

643
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,713
His time starts...
- Sister-in-law.

644
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:54,950
Now.
- Ma'am.

645
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,287
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.

646
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,793
Ma'am. Ma'am.

647
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,295
Samir. Samir, run. Run.

648
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,029
What?
- She was checking you out.

649
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,890
Her taste is so bad.

650
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,859
She is checking you out
for the past ten minutes.

651
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,568
What is this?

652
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,368
Today it has been proved.
Girls like fools.

653
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,840
From tomorrow no cigarette.

654
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,746
If she says yes, you
will go overboard on liquor.

655
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,151
It's my boss.
- Yes, sir.

656
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,224
Boss, I had come for
coffee during lunch.

657
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,554
I am not heaving, sir.

658
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,927
I had coffee, sir. My
tongue has got burnt.

659
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,329
Sir, costing file,
the estimate file.

660
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,497
I have kept it in the drawer, sir.

661
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:43,933
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I
am coming. I am coming.

662
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,674
Oh, no. How was the girl with her?

663
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:47,870
Okay.

664
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,043
Didn't you see?
- I was seeing your gal.

665
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:52,606
She was fine.

666
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,710
Why am I running?

667
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,353
Glory to Bajrangbali.

668
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,717
Where did he go?

669
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,560
In your excitement you
were driving in top gear.

670
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,359
He is not Spiderman.
He was left behind.

671
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,963
Don't worry. Listen to me.
He will surely follow me.

672
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,093
Then see how I entice him.

673
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,262
Yes.

674
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,977
He enticed the girl and won.

675
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,776
It's over.
- We will drink a lot.

676
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,988
It's over.
- He has enticed a girl.

677
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,055
You are spilling it.
You are spilling it.

678
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,319
What are you doing?

679
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,722
Kabir.

680
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,290
Where are you?

681
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,231
Come home. We are partying.

682
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,735
Bottles will clink.

683
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,065
He is drunk.

684
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,832
What?

685
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,974
Kabir's parents are coming.
- What are you saying?

686
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,307
Yes. He said he is at the station.

687
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,506
He is bringing them.

688
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,011
"Each corner is messy."

689
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,045
"We clean and scrub."

690
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,776
"Come. Let's clean."

691
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,651
"Our den is messy."

692
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,950
"What's the need?"

693
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,525
"Why should we clean it?"

694
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,823
"It's easier when
things are scattered."

695
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,558
"Why to change it?"

696
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,327
"What does anyone care?"

697
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,560
"It's our life."

698
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,192
"So what if we fight?"

699
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,633
"But we scrub."

700
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,800
"Come. Let's clean."

701
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,304
"Come. Let's clean."

702
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,405
"Come. Let's clean."

703
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,755
"Come. Let's clean."

704
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,366
You yourself are Lord
Shiva and joy of Kesari.

705
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,496
Uncle, hello. Aunt, hello.
- God bless you, son.

706
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,699
Hello.
- God bless you.

707
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,901
Aunt, hello.
- God bless you, son.

708
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,067
Uncle, hello.
- God bless you, son.

709
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,769
God bless you. Uncle, hello.
- God bless you, son.

710
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,278
Aunt, hello.
- God bless you, son.

711
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:41,214
You are always eager to
fulfill the wishes of Ram.

712
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,876
Such good children.

713
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,681
You are always keen to listen
to the narration of Ram's deed.

714
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,722
Ram, Lakhan and Sita
always resided in your mind.

715
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,385
He is doing a Hollywood film.

716
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,789
But he didn't forget our culture.

717
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,363
Aunt, he has imbibed the
same values in Will Smith too.

718
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,531
Both talk about spirituality
for hours together on the phone.

719
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,865
Fair skinned people have
always loved our culture, son.

720
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,874
No, aunt. Will Smith is not fair.

721
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,807
He is black.
- He is a black guy.

722
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:11,711
Bringing the
Sanjeevani you revived Laxman.

723
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,613
And Lord Ram embraced you with joy.
- It was futile.

724
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,276
Why are you
starting a new rehearsal?

725
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,581
You are disturbing my studies.
- Safal.

726
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,714
What are you blabbering?

727
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,726
You don't worship. At
least let him worship.

728
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,295
Safal.

729
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,726
Greet aunt and uncle.

730
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,332
The ghosts, demons and
evil spirits keep away.

731
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,439
Hello.
- No, son. No. No.

732
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,008
Learn to respect your elders, son.

733
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,608
No matter how much
you toil in life.

734
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,815
God is everybody's savior.
- What is he saying?

735
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,419
Don't forget Him.

736
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,651
But uncle, I...

737
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,350
O Son of Wind God,
destroyer of all miseries.

738
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,517
You are a symbol of auspiciousness.

739
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,453
God bless you, son. Bless you.

740
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,190
Mother, Samir.

741
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,192
God bless you.

742
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,460
Glory to Lord Ram and Sita.

743
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,968
Glory to Hanuman, son of Wind God.

744
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,665
Fight for your dreams.

745
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:14,972
Son, I don't think so. Still,
I am asking you.

746
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,842
Do you smoke and drink?
- No.

747
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,646
No.

748
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:29,525
Safal, I think you
must drink occasionally.

749
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,858
It's a bad habit, son.

750
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,124
Give it up.

751
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,067
No, aunt. I don't
know about outside.

752
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,000
In this house
there is a strict rule.

753
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,040
No smoking. No drinking.
- Yes.

754
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,005
Yes, aunt. We have sworn.

755
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,011
We will stay away from these things.

756
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,478
Ice-cream.

757
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,320
Why are you looking down, son?

758
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,514
Uncle.
- What are you doing, son?

759
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,853
I remembered my
father on seeing you.

760
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,858
I feel like lying at your feet.

761
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,423
They are very nice children.

762
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,658
Ice-cream. - Sinner.

763
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,768
He seems to have gone astray.

764
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,275
Aunt, we tried hard
to make him like us.

765
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,208
But he doesn't listen.

766
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,577
Father, shall we serve lunch?

767
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,417
Let's eat. You must be hungry.

768
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,852
I had to send an urgent mail.

769
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,917
Take uncle to the room, Jogi.
- Yes.

770
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,390
We will cook lunch.
- Come on, son.

771
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,293
Come, mother.
- Shall I help you in the kitchen?

772
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,590
No, aunt.

773
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,062
Today, we will cook lunch.

774
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,427
Uncle, I will do it.

775
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,145
Rajat.

776
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,278
Rajat.
- Yes.

777
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,719
Irfan left the bikini
babe file open. - Oh, no.

778
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,122
Come on. Come. Today
I won't spare him.

779
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:12,293
"Friends' den."

780
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,628
Aunt, I will go and say
the prayers. - Yes, son. Go.

781
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,010
You are sitting here.

782
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,650
I have not smoked for
the past four hours.

783
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,182
I am feeling dizzy.

784
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:41,649
Give me quickly.

785
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,963
Shall I say something?

786
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,333
You don't look like a
Muslim from any angle.

787
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,539
Shall I grow a beard? Wear a cap?

788
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,680
Shall I talk about
religion all the time?

789
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,140
Only then will I look
like a Muslim?

790
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,613
We are connected.

791
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,224
Son, the house
seems to be expensive.

792
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,128
The rent must be high.

793
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:20,856
No, father.

794
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,390
Mother, this house
belongs to Rajat's NRI uncle.

795
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,061
It was empty.

796
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,828
We have to only pay
the maintenance charge.

797
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:33,810
Son, we went to Ghaziabad
to see a boy for Sunaina.

798
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:38,644
Yes. Mother told me
everything at the station.

799
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,648
The boy is very good.

800
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,248
Why are you thinking?

801
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,919
Kavya's family drops hints
of fixing the wedding date.

802
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,720
It's been two years
since you got engaged, son.

803
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,825
How long will they wait?

804
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,598
Son, when will you find a job?

805
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,199
Look, don't worry
about our marriage.

806
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,699
Make arrangement for
Sunaina's marriage.

807
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,870
I will do whatever I can.

808
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,369
Best of luck, Safal.

809
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,064
Thanks, friends.

810
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,141
Have it. Your
interview will go well.

811
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:39,901
No.

812
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,904
Wait.

813
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,614
Go and do it.

814
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,788
Samir.

815
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,488
You are saying it wrong.

816
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,726
Say, come on, do it.

817
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,329
Certificate of obscenity.

818
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,061
Worshipper of lust.

819
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,061
What have you done to yourself?

820
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,230
Why don't you take a kiss?

821
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:12,901
Good one.

822
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:14,834
Looking confident.

823
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,003
Nice t-shirt.
- Thank you.

824
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,445
No. Wash it and hang it back.

825
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,574
What?

826
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,743
Going to meet Shreya?

827
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,786
Samir, is Shreya
pretty and cultured?

828
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,125
She is that and much more.

829
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,791
She is a hot chick, man.

830
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,295
She is very open.

831
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,961
From top to bottom...

832
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,163
Yes.

833
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,365
The best thing is that she
has a heart of gold. Yes.

834
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,807
Is that so? - She is the
nicest soul I have ever seen.

835
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,704
When did you see her soul?

836
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,310
Nowadays she is coming in my dream.

837
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,849
I see. She is coming in your dream.

838
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,178
She is coming. I am not going.

839
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,513
Is that so? - Go and tell her.
Why are you snapping at me?

840
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:02,318
Is there anyone in the
house to fight with both of us?

841
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,216
I swear on my mother.
I am not with him.

842
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,893
Fight with both of us.
- Do I want to die?

843
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,628
You are crazy. Will you
kill me? What if he stabs me?

844
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,397
I love drag racing.

845
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,738
That's Neha and her boyfriend.

846
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,171
Hi. - We come here
every week for drag racing.

847
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,339
It's so much fun.

848
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,917
So are you excited?
- Bring it on.

849
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,877
So let's go.
- Let's go.

850
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,255
You will lose it. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

851
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,564
Loser. Loser.

852
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,059
Oh, no.

853
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,106
Loser. Loser. Neha is a loser.

854
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,372
What happened?

855
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,279
From whom are you running?

856
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,784
Nitin. My ex-boyfriend.

857
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,020
He moved on.

858
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,903
You are also leaving me?

859
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,537
Shreya, I don't want to be
another man in your life.

860
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,539
You are on both the sides.
And I am only on your side.

861
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,541
It will be better for me to end
this relationship on a good note.

862
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,743
And to leave from here.

863
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,217
Do you love me, Samir?

864
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:24,919
You don't trust me?

865
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,528
I am just scared.

866
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,501
If you leave me, I
will beat you a lot.

867
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,480
I entered the house.
- Yes.

868
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,777
Safal went to the
bathroom and locked it.

869
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,179
What are you saying?
- From inside.

870
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,948
I could hear him panting.
- Yes.

871
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,182
Tell me the joke. - He came
out after an hour, sweating.

872
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,691
I asked, "What happened?"

873
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,689
"I have an upset stomach."

874
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:00,953
Tell me too.

875
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,189
Quiet. You are a kid.

876
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,126
Rajat.
- Yes.

877
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,531
Rajat, open the net.
- What happened?

878
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,762
My result must have been declared.

879
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,064
Oh, my. What are you saying?

880
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,469
Come on. Quickly. Come on. Come on.

881
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,575
The result has come.
- Come on. Come on.

882
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:16,363
I brought so many beers.
You finished it all?

883
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,639
Come, Kabir.

884
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,440
Let's buy some more.

885
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,478
Come.
- Please. - Come.

886
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,147
Come.
- Stop it, Samir. Stop it.

887
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,189
He is getting jealous. Look
at him. He is getting jealous.

888
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,824
Irfan.
- Samir.

889
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,020
Samir.

890
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,461
Safal failed once again.

891
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,859
This was his last attempt.
And this time too...

892
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:52,366
Oh, no.

893
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:59,081
Where is Safal?
- In his room.

894
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,081
Samir, let it be. He is not
talking to anyone. He is tense.

895
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:11,651
He will talk to me.
He is my best friend.

896
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,256
Safal.

897
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,990
You have gone crazy in
your drunken stupor.

898
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,590
Do you see the time? You
will throw us out of the house.

899
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,202
Safal.
- I will strangulate you.

900
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,736
I will beat you. Let me tell you.

901
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,029
Samir.
- Hey, rich brat.

902
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,275
Don't try to be his elder brother.

903
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,936
You...

904
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,205
Leave me. - You won't interfere
today. - What are you doing?

905
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,713
Today, I will see you.

906
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,852
Have you gone crazy?

907
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,581
Stop.
- Rajat. - Leave.

908
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,587
Stop Rajat.

909
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,191
I am observing since many days.
- Safal.

910
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,760
Listen to me.

911
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,864
Safal.
- Safal.

912
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,673
Do you remember 21st July?

913
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:13,844
'Friends.'

914
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,183
'AII of you remembered.'

915
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,348
'You don't remember.
We have to remember.'

916
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,391
'No. This time I remembered.'

917
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,153
'I have worn new clothes. And I
had gone to the temple as well.'

918
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,353
'Look, the sacred dot.'

919
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:32,495
'Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.'

920
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:36,129
'Happy birthday dear Safal.'

921
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,901
'Happy birthday to you.'

922
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,972
'No. No. I won't drink.'

923
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,172
'You are feeling shy as if you
had your nuptial nightjust now.'

924
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:49,581
'Give him.
- No.' - 'Drink it like cold drink.'

925
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,654
'It's amazing! '

926
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:59,056
'Samir, will you only
dance with girls in films? '

927
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,920
'Dance with me.'

928
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,157
'Come on.'

929
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,597
'Yes. Laugh. Laugh.'

930
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,259
'When my photo will be published... '

931
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,598
'... show it to people and say,
"Samir Khanna was our friend."'

932
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,832
'Samir Khanna was our friend.'

933
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,845
When Samir's
Hollywood film will release...

934
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,208
...do you know what Jogi will say?

935
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:19,406
What?

936
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,109
Samir used to sleep with me.

937
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,383
Now we will take
Samir Khanna's interview.

938
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:31,049
Hello. I welcome you
to ETV Big Business.

939
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,422
I am Komal Nahta.

940
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:34,962
Today we have Samir
Khanna with us in the studio.

941
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,224
Samir.
- Yes.

942
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,962
Your upcoming film
'Jab Hua Tab Hua'.

943
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,741
'Jab Hua Tab Hua... Hua
Hua Pyar Phir Vivah'.

944
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,736
This is the title. - Will your
photo be printed on the poster...

945
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,314
...or the film's
title will be printed?

946
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:58,819
No. But we are promoting it
by the name of JHTH3VP2BH.

947
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,047
I see.

948
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,716
So JH2...

949
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,224
I can't do it.

950
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,385
It's like a chemical equation.

951
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,396
What to do? Movies are all
about chemistry and equations.

952
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,127
Your chemistry
with Mallika Hilawat...

953
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:13,792
...has been appreciated a lot.

954
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,563
What's the equation?

955
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,506
No. We are just good friends.

956
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:25,671
Is that so?
- Yes.

957
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,819
Okay. Tell me. When you were
living in Delhi with six boys...

958
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:39,019
...you had a physical relationship
with a boy called Jogi?

959
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,691
What's going on?

960
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,665
I don't know any boy called Jogi.

961
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:50,034
No. Both of you were gay couple.

962
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,600
What are you saying?

963
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:57,370
No. Samir Khanna
is not a gay. Is he?

964
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,338
You kept us in the dark,
afraid that your image...

965
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,610
...in the media might get spoilt.

966
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,346
No. Khan can't endure my success.

967
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,545
I am being framed.

968
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,713
Poor Jogi went into depression.

969
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,484
He is still waiting
for you in Vrindavan.

970
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,151
Jogi supported you
In your bad times.

971
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,355
Now, Mallika and
I are good friends.

972
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,193
Do you have emotion?
- Yes. I have emotions.

973
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,166
Today I, Samir Khanna, am
saying in front of everyone.

974
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,897
I am gay. Jogi is my love.

975
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,680
Let me laugh. I am
laughing after a long time.

976
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,908
From where did you get the
term 'physical relationship'?

977
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,980
Are you downloading
adults' movies nowadays?

978
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,156
Jogi, run.
- Wait. - Jogi, run. - Wait.

979
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,054
Hurry up. We will miss the bus.
- Wait.

980
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,654
Jogi, we will miss the bus.

981
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,491
Oh, no.

982
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,057
Oh, no.

983
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,566
It's okay. I will
catch the next bus.

984
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,731
Come on. I am going to
Kalkaji for the interview.

985
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:58,841
You understood where you
have to go? - Yes. I know.

986
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,602
If there is any problem, I
will call you up and ask you.

987
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,274
Bye. Best of luck.

988
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,715
Wish you the same. Bye.

989
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:08,909
Bye. I will leave now.

990
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:34,738
Got it.
- Wow! That's great.

991
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,405
Where are we meeting?
- Shall we meet at your place?

992
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:39,945
My place?

993
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,144
Why? Any problem?

994
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,152
No. That's not so.

995
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,580
Just you and me.
- Okay.

996
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,050
What?

997
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,089
If I don't come home,
where will I go?

998
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,594
I should go for a movie?

999
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:55,625
Will you pay?

1000
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:57,426
I shouldn't come home
until you don't call me up?

1001
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,761
How much more time?

1002
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,426
You are very lucky.

1003
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,731
Why? What happened?

1004
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,965
If you don't finish it by
10 o'clock, I will ring the doorbell.

1005
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,164
I won't...

1006
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:06,502
Hello. Hello.

1007
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,658
I am about to leave.
It's a big car.

1008
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,352
You also reach there. I am coming.

1009
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,755
Fine. You reach there.
Okay. Okay. Yes.

1010
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:29,957
Okay.

1011
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,105
What's the matter, son?
- Uncle.

1012
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,298
You are standing outside.

1013
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,034
Hello.
- Hello.

1014
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,200
What happened?

1015
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,710
Uncle, Jogi has the key.

1016
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,144
Okay. No problem, son.
I have a duplicate key.

1017
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,774
No, uncle. Jogi had
called up just now. He...

1018
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,716
For how long will
you stand outside?

1019
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,218
Come. Come with me.
- Uncle.

1020
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,481
Coming.

1021
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:07,995
Close your eyes.

1022
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,008
Open your eyes.

1023
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,962
You have to get excited.

1024
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,584
If I had listened to my
mother when I was a kid...

1025
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,122
...I wouldn't have
had to face this today.

1026
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,281
Is that so?

1027
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,752
What did your mother say?

1028
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,155
I told you.
I never listened to her.

1029
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,257
You fool.

1030
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,127
Look at him. See this crazy man.

1031
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,802
Haunting ghosts.

1032
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,003
Are both of you watchmen?

1033
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,439
I am checking the
height of my frustration.

1034
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:55,601
I don't know about Rajat.

1035
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,779
Don't worry, friends.

1036
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,946
No need to worry.

1037
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,078
I have got superb DVDs from Palika.

1038
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,250
Eight top films.

1039
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,484
We will put Jogi to sleep.

1040
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,459
And watch it the whole night.

1041
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,453
What do you say?

1042
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:18,325
We have our hands. We will
fulfill our desires like this.

1043
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,390
Imagine.
- Yes.

1044
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,495
What if we didn't have hands?

1045
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:26,967
God, make me blind.
But not armless.

1046
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,375
Graviera man.

1047
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,808
Come, Jogi.

1048
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,776
Did you take him for a stroll?

1049
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,312
Can't you see?

1050
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,221
He has got a job.

1051
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:42,449
I am speaking the truth.

1052
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,156
I helped Jogi get a
job in Eureka Forbes.

1053
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,695
Now, Jogi will sell
aquaguards door-to-door.

1054
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,960
And I will give interviews.

1055
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,500
Meanwhile, I will
survive on my savings.

1056
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,062
Jogi.

1057
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,365
Great!

1058
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,967
Why are we standing outside?

1059
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,473
Some work is going on inside.

1060
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:15,715
Irfan.

1061
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,088
You have done a greatjob.

1062
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,522
Thank you, sir.

1063
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,359
Did you have lunch?

1064
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,069
No, sir. - Today, you
will have lunch with me.

1065
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,406
We will meet in ten minutes.

1066
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,339
Okay, sir. I will just come.

1067
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:38,474
Sorry.

1068
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,414
Ridhima?
- Yes.

1069
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:45,611
She is outside.

1070
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,214
Thanks.

1071
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,750
What's the problem?
- Nothing.

1072
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:51,685
Hi.

1073
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,091
I will talk to you later.

1074
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,856
I want to talk to you.

1075
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:02,294
Irfan, I also want to talk to you.

1076
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,471
Irfan, I was
searching for you inside.

1077
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,376
Ridhima, we are going
out for lunch.

1078
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:11,707
Why don't you join us?

1079
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:15,975
Are you coming?

1080
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,082
Come.

1081
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,616
I will get my bag and come.
- Yes. Sure.

1082
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,061
One more time. Sorry.

1083
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,626
Oh, no. Excuse me.

1084
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,064
Sorry about that.

1085
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:40,800
Yes, Shreya.

1086
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,167
I am at the workshop.

1087
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,405
Half an hour.

1088
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,850
Okay. Can you pick me up? Alright.

1089
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,115
Where were we? Sorry.

1090
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:00,260
Sir, could I get a
copy of the script?

1091
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,129
I have already given you one.

1092
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,593
Yeah. I know.

1093
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,092
I might have misplaced it.

1094
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,427
What?

1095
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,163
Yes.

1096
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,632
Hello, ma'am. Myself
Jogi from Eureka Forbes.

1097
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,335
I don't want it.
Don't waste my time.

1098
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,604
No problem.

1099
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,605
Ma'am, can I get a glass of water?

1100
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,142
Chocolate. Chocolate.
- Thank you, uncle.

1101
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,275
Look, so many. Take it. Take it.

1102
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:24,644
I also want it.
- Chocolate. Chocolate.

1103
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:25,947
One more.

1104
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,113
I also want it.

1105
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,015
Thank you, ma'am.

1106
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,623
Sorry, ma'am. I will
drink water from outside.

1107
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:38,389
What's the problem in this water?

1108
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:39,891
One moment.

1109
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,301
See this, ma'am.

1110
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,741
The maximum reading of
this meter should be two.

1111
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,637
And here, it's 7 point.

1112
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,915
It means your
water is impure, ma'am.

1113
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,849
And 90% diseases are
caused due to impure water.

1114
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,849
It will affect your children badly.

1115
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:02,719
Okay. Show me. How does
your water purifier work?

1116
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:03,882
Yes, ma'am.

1117
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,555
Ma'am, we are using two filters.

1118
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,391
This is called carbon filter.

1119
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,762
It has the latest
nano silver technology.

1120
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,596
There is a carbon block in this.

1121
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,871
The particles get purified.

1122
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,667
And travel to UV block.

1123
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:21,539
All bacteria get killed.
And you get germ free water.

1124
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:42,688
It feels so nice to drink
liquor bought by Mr. Jogi.

1125
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:43,659
I feel very nice.

1126
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,429
Jogi is not my brother.

1127
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,669
He is not my cousin.

1128
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:57,438
Jogi's father used
to work in my house.

1129
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:07,144
Jogi failed in high school.

1130
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,482
And he discontinued studies.

1131
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,157
And I left my house.

1132
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:21,462
Not because of Jogi.

1133
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:28,106
It's a top secret.

1134
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,015
My father...

1135
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,126
...could never understand me. No.

1136
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:55,793
Since childhood I used to
dream of a white-collarjob.

1137
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:04,035
And he would tell me,
"Construct roads."

1138
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:09,379
"Go into construction field.
Build bridges."

1139
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:13,045
"You are a Jat. Jat."

1140
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,052
"Jats never work for someone."

1141
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,322
I also told him, "Give
me one year's time."

1142
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,954
"I will go to America."

1143
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:24,892
He said, "Fine."

1144
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,331
"And I will give you
money for your expenses."

1145
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,974
"But I won't see
your face for a year."

1146
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:40,875
He is my father.

1147
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,752
He won't see my face.

1148
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,321
Tell me. What's the matter?

1149
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,864
Tell me. What's the matter?

1150
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,392
Your design...
- Yes.

1151
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,725
A project is being made on it.

1152
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,227
What?

1153
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:06,097
Are you speaking the truth?

1154
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,099
I saw it on boss's laptop.

1155
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,744
He was going to surprise you
after finishing the project.

1156
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,871
But I couldn't control myself.

1157
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,216
Oh, Lord.

1158
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,416
There is another good news.

1159
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:28,255
Wait. First let me enjoy this news.

1160
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,564
There is another good news.

1161
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,463
I am dying to tell you.

1162
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,528
Fine. Tell me.

1163
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,936
My boyfriend has got a job in
Canada. And he is going there.

1164
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:57,482
I gave you such a good news.
And you have become woeful.

1165
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,095
It means, you are
also going to Canada.

1166
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:07,796
No.
- So why are you so excited?

1167
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:12,102
Because finally that
idiot is out of my life.

1168
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:16,744
My intention would turn
bad whenever I would see you.

1169
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,408
I would feel guilty.

1170
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,943
You don't know how
relaxed I am right now.

1171
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:27,884
Look at your face.

1172
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,285
You idiot.

1173
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,527
Give me a hug. Come on.

1174
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,860
Get out!

1175
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:30,811
Thank you.

1176
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,753
What happened to you? Do
you have an upset stomach?

1177
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,890
Take this.

1178
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:40,587
Wear it.

1179
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,692
Be happy.

1180
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:48,661
Shall we go?

1181
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,857
Take care.
- Okay, brother.

1182
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,955
Fine?
- Go. - Guys.

1183
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,766
You go.
- Go.

1184
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:20,959
Come here.

1185
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:26,931
Hello.

1186
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,909
Are you still in character?

1187
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:35,049
I will watch your
film in New Jersey.

1188
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,716
Watch it in the theatre.
Don't buy a pirated copy.

1189
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,145
He will look uglier
in a pirated version.

1190
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,057
Samir, where are you?

1191
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,624
I had come to the
airport to drop my friend.

1192
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,996
It's been two days. You
didn't come to meet me.

1193
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,070
Are you so busy with your workshop?
You forgot me.

1194
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,265
No. That's not true.

1195
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,432
Do I exist in your life?

1196
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,771
I am a bit tense.

1197
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,074
If you don't meet me,
you are bound to be tense.

1198
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,784
Okay. I am coming.

1199
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,580
You never told me
about Ridhima before.

1200
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,817
Guys, I have to leave.

1201
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,516
Ridhima has gone to get coffee.

1202
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,857
At least have coffee.
- No. You guys carry on. Okay?

1203
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:30,094
What happened to you?

1204
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:37,476
I wanted to talk to all of you.
- Yes. Tell us.

1205
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:45,316
Ridhima and I have
decided to live together.

1206
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:53,024
You are also leaving us?

1207
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,798
We won't spend our
whole lives in our den.

1208
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,693
We have to move on.

1209
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,305
Hey, what happened?

1210
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,469
Shreya, will you please stop this?

1211
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:12,372
I want to talk to you.
- Tell me. I am listening.

1212
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,511
The film that I was doing,
that role...

1213
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,712
...has been offered
to somebody else.

1214
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,148
It is okay, Sam.

1215
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,060
Why did you stop
the music, you idiot?

1216
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:32,394
Because I want to
talk to you. I need you.

1217
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,371
I lost the race because of you.

1218
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:44,235
Damn it.

1219
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,505
Are you mad?

1220
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,847
Don't take out your
frustration on me.

1221
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,583
Listen, Sam.

1222
01:19:58,226 --> 01:19:59,284
Damn it.

1223
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,557
Samir.

1224
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:06,958
What's the problem?

1225
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,873
Shreya, do you care about me?
- Like what?

1226
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,139
Loser. Loser. Loser.

1227
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,173
Loser. Loser.

1228
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:22,776
Loser. Loser. Loser.

1229
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,781
I am really
feeling very bad. Really.

1230
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,158
You were treated unfairly.

1231
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:37,989
This is what you wanted to hear.
Right? - Loser. Loser. Loser. Loser.

1232
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:44,561
Loser. Loser. Loser. Loser.

1233
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,299
Samir.

1234
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,466
This is your life.

1235
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,504
You lose, you achieve,
it is up to you.

1236
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,276
I am not dependent on you.
So why should I care?

1237
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,453
So all you care about is your...
- And you don't.

1238
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,919
I do. God damn it.

1239
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:03,313
I do care about you.

1240
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,594
What you like, what you don't like...

1241
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:08,993
...it makes a
difference to me, Shreya.

1242
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:12,260
I know I ruined my
career to spend time with you.

1243
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,834
But that's okay. I don't regret it.

1244
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,027
Because I did it from my heart.

1245
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,165
I did it because I liked it.

1246
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,109
You are so disturbed because you
lost a small race to your friends.

1247
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,648
I have lost the
battle of my life, Shreya.

1248
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,008
With you.

1249
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:32,212
Sorry.
- No.

1250
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,350
I don't need your sympathy.
- What?

1251
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,223
I don't want your
10% so-called love.

1252
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,954
There are many fools in
this city like me, Shreya.

1253
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:44,332
So please go ahead.
And enjoy your life.

1254
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,525
Please.

1255
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:51,697
Are you coming?

1256
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:37,614
"What's hidden in your heart?"

1257
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:42,189
"Only your heart knows that."

1258
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,224
"What's hidden in your heart?"

1259
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,029
"Only your heart knows that."

1260
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,729
"Who is guarding your heartbeats?"

1261
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:59,966
"When and who dwelled
in your heart and why?"

1262
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,907
"What's hidden in your heart?"

1263
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:08,278
"Only your heart knows that."

1264
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:13,644
"Heart's ways are so strange."

1265
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,416
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1266
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:19,152
"The heart is bit crazy."

1267
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,888
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1268
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:28,561
"The heart is bit crazy."

1269
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:48,119
"The heart always plays
hide-and-seek with desires."

1270
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:55,428
"The heart always endures
the restrictions of dilemma."

1271
01:23:56,731 --> 01:24:04,638
"The heart always plays
hide-and-seek with desires."

1272
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:12,038
"The heart always endures
the restrictions of dilemma."

1273
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:17,808
"It roams around with an
advertisement on its face."

1274
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:23,113
"It exhibits its
desires and dances."

1275
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,019
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1276
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,686
"The heart is bit crazy."

1277
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,355
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1278
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:38,530
"The heart is bit crazy."

1279
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:39,731
'I am going, Kavya.'

1280
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,669
'I will return to Bareli
only after I achieve something.'

1281
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:10,002
"Nobody could understand why
heart behaves childishly."

1282
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:17,607
"The heart has
several stories and tales."

1283
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:26,451
"Nobody could understand why
heart behaves childishly."

1284
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:34,525
"The heart has
several stories and tales."

1285
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:39,726
"Once heart gets stuck,
it remains stuck."

1286
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:45,067
"It suffers and yet keeps silent."

1287
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,801
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1288
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,467
"The heart is bit crazy."

1289
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:53,206
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1290
01:25:53,281 --> 01:26:01,211
"The heart is bit crazy."

1291
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:20,797
Sir, we are going to get married.

1292
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:23,907
We thought we will inform you.

1293
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:26,071
Congrats.

1294
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:31,076
Yes.

1295
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,112
Yes.

1296
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:35,587
Give an ad in Times of India.

1297
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,488
MBA in marketing.

1298
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:41,185
Kabir.

1299
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:43,357
Kabir.

1300
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:45,591
Yes.

1301
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,335
We need a guy as soon as possible.

1302
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,462
Yes.

1303
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,705
Sir, my friend is
a MBA in marketing.

1304
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:56,476
From where?
- From Banaras Hindu University.

1305
01:26:57,412 --> 01:27:00,939
Trust me, sir. He is a very
talented guy. Hard working too.

1306
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:02,340
Great!

1307
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:04,650
Call him on Thursday.

1308
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:07,888
No need to worry. I was
also nervous on the first day.

1309
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,319
Everything will be fine. Okay?

1310
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:10,516
Yes, sir.
- Come on.

1311
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:11,882
Okay. Listen.

1312
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,491
You go to Dwarka section 9.
And you go to Maharani Bagh.

1313
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:15,824
Okay, sir.
- All the best.

1314
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,361
Thank you.

1315
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,806
Buddy, it's a big office.

1316
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,711
Your career is going great.

1317
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:37,210
Your career will also
be bright. Don't worry.

1318
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:38,709
I hope so.

1319
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:45,515
Is my tie okay? - Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1320
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:46,719
Relax.

1321
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:52,428
Ridhima is not to be seen.

1322
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,429
She is on leave since two days.

1323
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,094
She is not well.

1324
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,197
Irfan.

1325
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:07,706
What the hell is this?

1326
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:11,209
There are so many
errors in this project.

1327
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:16,716
If I had not checked
before sending the tender...

1328
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,786
...our firm would have
incurred a loss of two crores.

1329
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:21,926
Just because of you.

1330
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,264
Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

1331
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:30,461
No.

1332
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,765
I don't need
irresponsible people like you.

1333
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,545
Submit all the documents.
Collect your cheque.

1334
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,275
And leave.

1335
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:44,876
Sir.

1336
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,292
People are kicking us
as if we are football.

1337
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,567
But they don't know
we are going forward.

1338
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,064
Closer to our goal.

1339
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,073
I won't give up like Safal.

1340
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:14,014
There is no dearth of
opportunities in this world.

1341
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,009
Shall we go home?

1342
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,616
Jogi.

1343
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,293
I have started getting wrinkles.

1344
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,760
These are your negative thoughts.

1345
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:33,096
It's abusing you on your face.

1346
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:36,270
Do you know what someone
told Donald Trump once?

1347
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,834
Sir, you got success overnight.

1348
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:41,838
Do you know what he said?

1349
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:46,470
My friend, you don't know
how long that night was.

1350
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,849
Nowadays you have
started reading Donald Trump?

1351
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,185
Times of India had
printed its quotation.

1352
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,022
I opened the dictionary
and understood the meaning.

1353
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:57,882
Amazing!

1354
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,486
It's less.

1355
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:04,357
Uncle, our two
partners have already left.

1356
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:06,394
Please manage this time.

1357
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,301
I am managing since
the time Rajat has left.

1358
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:12,362
But I have to give an
answer to Mr. Chawla.

1359
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,507
Uncle, don't worry.

1360
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:17,134
Please give me a few days.
I will surely do something.

1361
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,739
Fine. I give you 15 days.

1362
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:25,345
If you don't pay the
full amount within 15 days...

1363
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:27,546
...I will throw your luggage out.

1364
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:43,695
Samir.

1365
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,330
Samir.

1366
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,498
What happened?

1367
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,837
Samir, we owe two months' rent.

1368
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:50,371
Mr. Chaddha is getting angry.

1369
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:52,545
It was overdue even
when Rajat was there.

1370
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,746
Chaddha didn't have a problem then.

1371
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,380
Samir, uncle Chawla is
brother Rajat's relative.

1372
01:30:58,486 --> 01:30:59,544
He is not our relative.

1373
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:01,550
And you must have got the cheque.

1374
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:03,089
Please adjust in that.

1375
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:04,248
Please.

1376
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,853
My bank account is zero.

1377
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,060
And I am not doing the movie.

1378
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:13,559
What?

1379
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:17,236
You got such a big opportunity.
And you lost it.

1380
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:20,297
Samir.

1381
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,901
Samir, I am talking to you.

1382
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:27,977
Samir, are you
listening to what I am saying?

1383
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,045
You smoke joint the whole day.

1384
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,315
Why are you spoiling your life?

1385
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:38,388
First achieve
something in your life.

1386
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:41,158
After that give advice
to others. Understood?

1387
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,100
Jogi.

1388
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:57,305
How many more whistles?

1389
01:31:57,645 --> 01:32:00,170
Three. Lunch will be
ready in five minutes.

1390
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:02,774
Where is Samir?

1391
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:04,675
He has not come out of
the room since last night.

1392
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:06,311
Call him too.

1393
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,313
We will eat together.

1394
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:10,954
I knocked a few times. But
he didn't open the door.

1395
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,645
Samir.
- Samir. Samir. - Samir.

1396
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,048
Samir, open the door.
- Samir.

1397
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,816
Samir, are you listening?
Open the door.

1398
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:45,516
Yes. What happened?

1399
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:50,687
Samir, you are fine, aren't you?

1400
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:53,558
I am alive. I am not dead.

1401
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:05,709
'Now, I am calling on
stage actor Samir Khanna.'

1402
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:08,973
'Last year he topped the
National School of Drama.'

1403
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:12,315
'And made his
hometown Bhopal proud.'

1404
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,486
'Actor Samir Khanna.'

1405
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:20,356
'Well done, my boy. Well done.'

1406
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:23,421
'Samir, you are outstanding.'

1407
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:25,598
'Sir, your performance was superb.'

1408
01:33:25,733 --> 01:33:26,995
'You played very well.'

1409
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,001
'Brother, you will act in movies.'

1410
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:32,402
'Son, with the money that you
send I will go to Amarnath.'

1411
01:33:48,656 --> 01:33:49,714
'Do you love me, Samir? '

1412
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:52,622
'You are bound to be
tense if you don't meet me.'

1413
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,694
'I will beat you a
lot if you leave me.'

1414
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:56,228
'You are also leaving me? '

1415
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:57,922
'You are also leaving me? '

1416
01:33:58,065 --> 01:33:59,259
'You are also leaving me? '

1417
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,425
'You are also leaving me? '

1418
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:03,093
'You are also leaving me? '

1419
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:04,761
'You are also leaving me? '

1420
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:06,662
Hi, Samir.
- Hi.

1421
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:09,260
How are you?

1422
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:12,096
I am fine.

1423
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,332
How are you?

1424
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:15,533
I am fine.

1425
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:23,809
I want to talk to you.

1426
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:26,111
Can we meet?

1427
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:28,682
I am in Goa. I am
returning this evening.

1428
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:31,017
Tell me. What's the matter?

1429
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:40,125
I am missing you, Shreya.

1430
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:51,044
Samir, I waited a lot for you.

1431
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:54,974
But the thing is...

1432
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,350
...I have patched up with Nitin.

1433
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:53,032
"It lost itself."

1434
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:58,100
"Poor heart couldn't understand."

1435
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:05,313
"It wandered around
searching for its shadow."

1436
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:09,450
"It lost itself."

1437
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:14,493
"Poor heart couldn't understand."

1438
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:22,098
"It wandered around
searching for its shadow."

1439
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:25,330
"It endures tears."

1440
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:27,940
"It leads a suffocating life."

1441
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:33,070
"It gets murdered and yet
it bows in front of God."

1442
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,910
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1443
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:38,644
"The heart is bit crazy."

1444
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:41,311
"It's crazy. It's crazy."

1445
01:37:41,455 --> 01:37:48,987
"The heart is bit crazy."

1446
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,300
Sir, I admit our
friend made a mistake.

1447
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:56,830
But he is innocent, sir.

1448
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:58,165
He is innocent?

1449
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,468
He will be in
prison for a long time...

1450
01:38:02,576 --> 01:38:03,873
...for attempt to murder and
possession of illegal arms.

1451
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:05,137
He is not innocent.

1452
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,704
Sir. Sir, please.

1453
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:09,648
Poor boy's life will get spoilt.

1454
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:11,841
Sir.
- What do I do?

1455
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,883
Sir, he made a mistake.
Forgive him.

1456
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:15,352
What do I do?

1457
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:19,049
He has clearly
written in the letter.

1458
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:22,890
I support Anna Hazare.

1459
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:25,631
I talk frankly.
- Yes, sir.

1460
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,961
If you get dragged to the court,
you will spend a lot of money.

1461
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:34,072
It amounts to Rs.25000.
Let's end the matter here.

1462
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:38,842
Let's see Anna Hazare's
anti-corruption movement...

1463
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,980
Yes, Kripal. Hello.

1464
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,013
Which station?

1465
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,712
Tilak Nagar.

1466
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:49,983
It's a girl's matter?

1467
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,683
No. Don't get involved.

1468
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:55,084
All the medias will reach there.

1469
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:56,986
Send him to prison for a long time.

1470
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:58,824
Yes.

1471
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:01,431
Kabir.
- Yes.

1472
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:03,330
How much do you have?

1473
01:39:03,904 --> 01:39:07,203
Around Rs.2000-2500.

1474
01:39:09,143 --> 01:39:11,941
I also must have
around Rs.6000-7000.

1475
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:16,681
All of you arrange
for as much as you can.

1476
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:18,448
I will manage the rest.

1477
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:20,045
Let's see.

1478
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,379
I ruined my career.

1479
01:39:49,183 --> 01:39:51,447
Thank God.

1480
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:53,075
There is still corruption in India.

1481
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,485
If he had not taken bribe, you
would have still been in prison.

1482
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:01,883
I am... sorry.

1483
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:06,761
It's okay. It's okay.

1484
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,326
Samir, shall I say something?

1485
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:14,239
When you used to do theatre,
you would always be happy.

1486
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:16,303
Join theatre once more.

1487
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:19,443
Jogi is absolutely right.
Listen to him.

1488
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:20,604
Do you understand?

1489
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:24,079
Come on. Tell me.
Who will buy us tea?

1490
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,745
Who?
- He has become a rich man.

1491
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,583
He will buy us tea. Why should I?

1492
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:41,793
Hello, sir.

1493
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,167
I want to join the group again.

1494
01:40:48,809 --> 01:40:51,175
I don't work with
unprofessional people.

1495
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,806
I am sorry, sir.

1496
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:58,678
The show is after three days.

1497
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,851
There is no role for you now.

1498
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:04,220
Let me stand in the crowd.

1499
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:08,051
Please, sir.

1500
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:10,352
I can't let you stand in the crowd.

1501
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:11,625
I will do backstage, sir.

1502
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:14,296
I am really, really sorry.

1503
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:17,063
I want to come back, sir.

1504
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,830
The rehearsal is in the evening,
in the auditorium.

1505
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:23,501
Come there.

1506
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,336
Thank you, sir.

1507
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:28,375
5 o'clock means 5 o'clock.

1508
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,764
Hari.
- Yes, sir.

1509
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:50,598
You can leave.
- Okay.

1510
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,095
Where is Samir?

1511
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,535
Samir.
- Yes, sir.

1512
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:56,432
Serve tea for everyone.
- Okay.

1513
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:35,639
Komal.

1514
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:40,419
I am glad one talent
was saved from dying.

1515
01:42:41,522 --> 01:42:43,149
This is the final rehearsal.

1516
01:42:43,524 --> 01:42:44,889
Best of luck.

1517
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,622
We will fight, friends.

1518
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,393
For the sad weather.

1519
01:42:53,367 --> 01:42:55,767
We swear on emotions.

1520
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:59,131
We swear on dejected eyes.

1521
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,499
We swear on hardships.

1522
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,444
We will fight, friends.

1523
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:11,982
We will fight, friends.

1524
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:14,513
For the sad weather.

1525
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:18,124
We swear on emotions.

1526
01:43:19,493 --> 01:43:21,825
We swear on dejected eyes.

1527
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:25,130
We swear on hardships.

1528
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,523
We will fight, friends.

1529
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:45,285
'Son, when will you get a job? '

1530
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:56,053
Hello.

1531
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:58,122
Papa.

1532
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,329
Papa, I have got a job.

1533
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:04,061
Yes, papa.

1534
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:31,161
It took me two years to
design this ambitious project.

1535
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:40,764
Get out. Or else I
will throw you out.

1536
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:50,109
Sir, I want to ask
you a small question.

1537
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:52,510
I will leave after that.

1538
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:59,221
How did it take you two years
to take out its photocopy, sir?

1539
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:03,027
When we don't have guns,
we will have swords.

1540
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:07,025
When we don't have swords,
we will get used to fighting.

1541
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:08,959
When we don't have
the energy to fight...

1542
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:11,234
...it will be our need to fight.

1543
01:45:11,505 --> 01:45:13,973
We will fight, friends.

1544
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:20,943
We will fight.
We will fight for sure.

1545
01:45:21,515 --> 01:45:24,211
We will fight.
Why didn't we fight before?

1546
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:27,982
We will fight to find our voice.

1547
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:32,557
We will fight to keep the
memory of martyrs alive.

1548
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:37,890
We will fight, friends.
Because there is no other way.

1549
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:41,459
We will fight,
friends. We will fight.

1550
01:46:12,632 --> 01:46:14,156
I will hear your nonsense later.

1551
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:15,632
I am calling from Mauritius.

1552
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:17,767
What are you doing in Mauritius?

1553
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:19,532
I have joined Silver Circle group.

1554
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,467
My company has sent
me on a holiday.

1555
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:23,641
You are lucky.

1556
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:25,203
Work as well as holiday.

1557
01:46:25,345 --> 01:46:26,437
Do you know?

1558
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:27,672
I have even completed graduation...

1559
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:28,838
...from correspondence.

1560
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:30,210
How many more
surprises will you give me?

1561
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:35,052
Listen, brother Rajat is
coming from US on Sunday.

1562
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,314
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1563
01:46:36,423 --> 01:46:37,481
I am organizing a get together.

1564
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:39,218
Okay. Tell me. Who all are coming?

1565
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:40,451
I am coordinating.

1566
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,027
God wills all scoundrels will come.

1567
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:46,660
Fine. I am not promising.
But I will try.

1568
01:46:46,767 --> 01:46:47,961
Don't come. Go to hell.

1569
01:46:49,102 --> 01:46:50,296
Irfan.

1570
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:52,895
What are you doing?
Hurry up. You are so late.

1571
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:01,536
Scoundrel. I am in Patna.

1572
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:03,174
I have continuous
shows for three days.

1573
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:04,341
How can I come?

1574
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:06,316
If you want to come,
come. Otherwise go to hell.

1575
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:13,157
Komal.
- Yes.

1576
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:15,888
Komal, a bit on the side. There.

1577
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:22,727
Yes, Jogi.

1578
01:47:25,806 --> 01:47:26,898
Sunday?

1579
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:31,434
Not possible. I am
going to Mumbai today.

1580
01:47:32,746 --> 01:47:34,077
Shift it ahead.

1581
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,675
You are so busy earning money.

1582
01:47:39,052 --> 01:47:40,610
You don't have
time for your friends.

1583
01:47:41,054 --> 01:47:42,612
Just write on facebook.

1584
01:47:42,756 --> 01:47:44,849
Miss you. Let's
catch up. This and that.

1585
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:46,589
You don't have time
to show your face.

1586
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:53,693
Welcome back to India.

1587
01:47:57,604 --> 01:47:58,696
Scoundrel.

1588
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:00,238
Scoundrel, how are you?

1589
01:48:01,575 --> 01:48:03,099
Scoundrel, you were playing a drama.

1590
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:06,045
What did you think?
Only you have news?

1591
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:07,238
Jogi.

1592
01:48:08,615 --> 01:48:10,139
Hi. Hello. Hello.

1593
01:48:10,584 --> 01:48:12,449
You have got a hot gal from America.

1594
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:14,076
Scoundrel, I am your sister-in-law.

1595
01:48:17,123 --> 01:48:18,647
Yes. Tel me, Kavya.

1596
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:23,128
You said you have to go
for shopping with Jenny.

1597
01:48:24,264 --> 01:48:27,062
Yes. Where are we going?

1598
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:28,965
To my house. To my house.

1599
01:48:29,102 --> 01:48:31,593
Yes. Come to
Irfan's house with Jenny.

1600
01:48:31,705 --> 01:48:34,333
Tell them buy whatever they want.

1601
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:35,601
Take as much time as they want.

1602
01:48:35,709 --> 01:48:36,801
We are not in a hurry.

1603
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:41,476
Yes. Rajat is saying
take care. Bye. Bye.

1604
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:44,007
No.

1605
01:48:44,384 --> 01:48:45,476
Are you fine?

1606
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:47,579
It's 'Roza' (Fasting).

1607
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:50,081
Since when?

1608
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:53,955
All of you are looking at me
as if I have committed a crime.

1609
01:48:54,995 --> 01:48:58,362
It's good. But how?

1610
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:04,831
Ridhima said if you
love Allah, express it.

1611
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,631
Why this silent love?

1612
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:09,938
It was simple. I understood.

1613
01:49:11,344 --> 01:49:12,868
Nice. Very nice.

1614
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:15,106
Shall we go to our den once?

1615
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:18,283
Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1616
01:49:59,859 --> 01:50:00,883
Shall we see it once?

1617
01:50:01,962 --> 01:50:04,055
A family could be staying here.

1618
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:06,323
What's the harm in trying?

1619
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:10,561
Let me do it.

1620
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:14,668
Let's open it and see.

1621
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:19,837
Jogi has bought our den.

1622
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:22,844
Scoundrel Jogi.
- Jogi.

1623
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:25,008
Scoundrel, you bought our den.

1624
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:23,407
If you had not taken your life,
today you would have also...

1625
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:25,637
...achieved something in life.

1626
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:38,490
Jogi.

1627
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:40,253
Come on. Come on.

1628
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:57,502
Yes. Tell me.

1629
01:52:01,414 --> 01:52:03,507
It's not as breezy as before.

1630
01:52:05,752 --> 01:52:09,688
A hot girl has come.

1631
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:15,558
Where is she going?

1632
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:16,988
Hot gal.

1633
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:19,856
What? What?

1634
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:23,828
What were you looking at?

1635
01:52:23,937 --> 01:52:25,370
A hot girl had come.
- Is that so?

1636
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:27,138
You missed it. Really.

1637
01:52:29,876 --> 01:52:34,040
Hi, Rajat. Hi, Irfan.
Hi, Samir. Hi, Kabir.

1638
01:52:38,051 --> 01:52:39,712
Anu. My girlfriend.

1639
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:47,652
Jogi, come on.

1640
01:53:11,951 --> 01:53:13,851
"Today we are here."

1641
01:53:17,924 --> 01:53:19,949
"Today we are here."

1642
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:23,052
"Today we are here."

1643
01:53:23,163 --> 01:53:25,757
"We don't know where
we will be tomorrow."

1644
01:53:25,899 --> 01:53:29,699
"God knows where the
open sky will take us."

1645
01:53:29,969 --> 01:53:33,905
"Friends, we will never
forget our friendship."

1646
01:53:34,007 --> 01:53:35,565
"Those times. Those moments."

1647
01:53:35,675 --> 01:53:38,644
"Your laughter."

1648
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:45,909
"Be it day or night."

1649
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:49,777
"I will miss you all the time."

1650
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:54,054
"No matter how far we are."

1651
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:58,256
"This distance
will bring us closer."

1652
01:53:58,364 --> 01:54:01,891
"Those hard times. That love."

1653
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:03,897
"You are my shadow."

1654
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:06,161
"I am Ionely without you."

1655
01:54:06,306 --> 01:54:07,830
"I am missing you again."

1656
01:54:08,274 --> 01:54:10,242
"It's the desire of my heart."

1657
01:54:50,049 --> 01:54:53,815
"We should be together
for seven lifetimes."

1658
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,686
"We might die. But we will be
together till our last breath."

1659
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:01,518
"Don't ever separate from me."

1660
01:55:01,661 --> 01:55:05,563
"Don't ever leave me."

1661
01:55:05,865 --> 01:55:09,733
"Nothing will remain
besides our friendship."

1662
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:14,203
"This is life. This is happiness."
