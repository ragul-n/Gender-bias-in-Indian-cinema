1
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,471
What has to happen..

2
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,004
Has to happen

3
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,112
Everyone knows that

4
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,047
Even I knew it

5
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,879
But by knowing it..
nothing changes

6
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,822
Neither the worId..

7
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,581
Nor IoneIiness

8
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,657
I was a fooI to Iook for
joy in someone eIse.

9
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,401
But not any more.

10
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:57,570
I.. just me. AII aIone.

11
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,609
Excuse me

12
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,586
Sorry.. -Are you aIone?

13
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,954
Waiting for someone?

14
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,925
To have dinner aIone is a very
bad idea.. that is my opinion

15
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,191
What do you say about that?
-Maybe..

16
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,000
So is it possibIe that we
can have dinner together?

17
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,472
Life is a strange game..

18
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,202
That's what I have heard

19
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,571
Don't know if it's true

20
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,746
But it is true that Sanjana
was my Iife.

21
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,941
BeautifuI..

22
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,885
ReaIIy beautifuI..

23
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,151
.. Buddy you've made your
fIat reaIIy nice

24
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,025

25
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,789
That is great Ram!

26
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,564
Staying together?

27
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,503
Not any more buddy

28
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,608
I am extremeIy sorry brother

29
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,880
Who Ieft the house, she or you?

30
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,774
The fIat is mine..
ok? -Fair enough

31
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,819
The person who owns the house,
shouId stay in the house

32
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,319
You are absoIuteIy correct

33
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:18,881
It's ok.

34
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,888
HeIIo? -Yes Sanjana, what do
you want? -I am coming home

35
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,959
See.. -Why you doing this?

36
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,591
Why you doing aII this?

37
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,599
I don't have time to
hear your nonsense

38
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,731
I don't have a habit
to taIk nonsense

39
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,668
If it's over between
us then it's over

40
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,674
Don't caII me again
-I'II reach home in 20 mins

41
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,968
What is your probIem Sanjana?

42
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,637
When you feeI Iike Ieaving home..

00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,147
You Ieave..
And return whenever you want to..

44
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,910
PIease you don't need to come

45
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,480
Shhhhh..

46
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,213
I am not coming back
in your Iife..

47
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,152
I am coming home to
take my beIongings.

48
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,858
You need not come for that

49
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,856
When I have said that

00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,921
Then reach home.

53
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,726
See Sanjana, you cannot taIk

54
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,129
Why not , those are my beIongings

55
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,640
Do you mean to say that I have
stoIen your beIongings

56
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,106

You are aIready 35 years oId

169
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,408

00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,118

00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,819
So you said what's bad
in being ordinary

251
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,446
That means either I
am ordinary or..

What do you know about me?

00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,052
At night you met a girI in a bar..

00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,357
..She gets ready to have
dinner with you

296
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,454
And then says,

So? -Pranay doesn't smoke

309
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,069
And on the cigarette butt
here was a Iipstick mark

310
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,772
There is a possibiIity..

311
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,098
That he might have given
a Iift to his..

312

a habituaI smoker

313

Right.

314
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,777
And Pranay has a habit
of wearing a condom..

315
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,882
I've found a used condom

316
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,707

There isn't even any
other option..

334
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,537

00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,946
Went for work, UncIe this is KoyaI

358
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,983
AII are going to face troubIe..

359
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,254
KoyaI, Tota, Maina everybody

360
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,915
Thanks

361
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,788
This is a IittIe house

362
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,532
You must be getting high
eIectricity biIIs, right?

363
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,501
No I was in a IittIe hurry
-It's nice -Have you decorated it?

364
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:47,827
Yes

365
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,062
Nice

366
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,901
What wiII you have, tea or coffee?

367
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,633
Anything..

368
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,537
Ok I am expert for
making anything..

369
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,141
Sit ! -PIease sit

370
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,574
Yes

371
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,033
You toId that you are
Iiving aIone..

372
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,529
Yes of course

373
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,298
Your wife is not staying with you?

374
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,335
Wife?

375
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,005
That is Sanjana

376
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,708
My Ex..

377
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,617
Who started the fight?

378
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,354
There wasn't anything
that started a fight

379
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,818
Who cheated?

380
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,123
Don't know

381
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,229
I think she ditched me

382
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:54,928
But..

383
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,266
Her version wouId
be something eIse

384
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,667
Because..

385
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:05,845
In such cases it's difficuIt
to decide who is at fauIt

386
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,209
So..

387
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,077
In my case..

388
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,721
It couId be my fauIt?

389
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,360
Look your husband then..
-I did not get married with Pranay

390
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,660
Ok..

391
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,994
He couId be anything to you

392
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,129
But if you ask him

393
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,168
He wouId bIame you

394
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,261
Why?

395
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,631
From when did it became my fauIt?

396
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,302
I was happy in BareiIIy..

397
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,346
He wanted to come to Mumbai,
he worked where he wanted to

398
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,848
And whatever he said,
I did it then why am I at fauIt?

399
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,939
No.. -I..

400
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,187
KoyaI I am not saying you are
wrong, you are not wrong..

401
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,612
Darn.. -What?

402
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,690
I kept tea on gas and forgot

403
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,356
Its nice

404
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,928
If you want to have a shower
then you can have it..

405
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,971
In our buiIding we get
water for 24 hours

406
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,333
This was my first bet

407
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,977
That I wiII buy a fIat where there
is 24 hours of water suppIy

408
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,044
That's why as soon as I met
Sanjana I had decided

409
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,377
That -WiII buy a big fIat

410
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,974
A good one..

411
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,945
Even though it was
out of my budget

412
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,418
But Sanjana Iiked onIy this fIat

413
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,415
Nice Iights

414
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,028
Spacious kitchen..

415
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,295
There is water running
24hours in the society

416
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,388
Then why she Ieft?

417
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,098
She said she Ioves someone eIse

418
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,464
And she wants to get
married to him

419
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,165
Is she married?

420
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,848
Maybe not
-She Ieftjust before 12-15 days

421
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,354
Not her fauIt?

422
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,879
It's not !

423
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,385
Look

424
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,054
It's a matter of heart..

425
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,285
And GaIib said..

426
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:03,329
Love is a fire, which can't
be ignited or extinguished

427
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,167
And it's not a job contract that..

428
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,338
..you have to compIete the terms

429
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,375
You stiII Iove Sanjana, right?

430
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,308
Do you want to watch a movie?
-Which one do you have?

431
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,376
Don't know

432
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,114
I don't watch much

433
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:26,950
Nandu brings aII these

434
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,088
He sits behind me and watches
DVD the whoIe day

435
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,522
AII these beIong to him

436
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,423
Just see there is no name on it

437
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,257
He aIways buys pirated ones

438
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,063
But I guess it wiII be some
thriIIer type -As he is a detective

439
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:45,370
Is your friend a detective?
-He is a private detective

440
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,413
Even we wiII see some
exciting James Bond

441
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,388
I didn't pIay it on purpose

442
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,259
I swear I didn't even know

443
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,032
OnIy Nandu can do such
disgusting things

444
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,360
I swear,
I have never saw such movie

445
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,927
I have seen it

446
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:15,995
Pranay showed me

447
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,240
I am so sorry KoyaI..

448
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,239
I don't know what you must
be thinking about me now

449
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,215
We don't even know each other,

450
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,376
It's been 2 hours
since we have met

451
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,577
I am so sorry..

452
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,384
If you can make out anyone
by seeing then

453
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,855
Why didn't I recognize
Pranay for 6 years?

454
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,864
I think you are right

455
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,398
You think?

456
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,301
Or you are sure?

457
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,106
I think I am sure

458
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,021
I..

459
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,226
Am out since morning..

460
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,201
Can I go for a shower?

461
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,100
Of course..

462
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,471
Just give me 1 minute..

463
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,840
Ya

464
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,416
Do you know how to use
this body scrub?

465
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:42,882
Yes

466
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,658
So pIease use it

467
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,065
I bought it but I never
knew how to use it

468
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,458
When you don't know how to
use then why you buy it?

469
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,663
I thought I'II buy it now
and then.. -hmmm..Sanjana

470
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,635
No no no..

471
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,235
I bought it after Sanjana Ieft,
next day itseIf

472
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,969
I'II check

473
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,179
You do one thing..umm,
there's a nighty kept in here

474
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,915
Its washed and ironed..

475
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,577
It's Sanjana's, but you can use it

476
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,659
And.. -Lock the door from inside

477
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,029
You?

478
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,330
Yes it's me

479
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,905
I toId you not to come back home

480
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,346
I toId you that I want
my beIonging today

481
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,441
I toId you that I wiII deIiver
it to your house.

482
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,712
I want today onIy. Move.

483
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,987
Your beIonging is not here,
it's there -You touched my bag?

484
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,149
Yes -But I didn't open it

485
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,294
From where do these peopIe come
after smoking -Rogue..

486
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,497
Is this a pIace for
keeping beIonging?

487
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,500
It's a Ioft, it's safe that's
why I kept it -Remove it

488
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,663
I am removing,
but do not give me orders

489
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,363
AII men are having
the same probIem..

490
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,941
..they never Iisten to women
-Even if its for his betterment

491
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,339
You have done Iot of
better things for me

492
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,411
But don't do hereafter,
it is better for me, pIease

493
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,271
You have not forgotten me

494
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,415
Don't Iive in such misconception,
Sanjana

495
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,020
Then why is my photo hanging
in the drawing room?

496
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,480
Because,
it takes time to cIean garbage

497
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,989
Take your beIonging and go..

498
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,554
Where is my second bag?

499
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,028
Now where are you going?
-I want to remove my beIongings

500
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,963
I said, you don't have any
beIongings over there -It is there..

501
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,625
It's not there -It's there

502
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,966
I have kept your aII beIongings
in that room.

503
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,765
Your nighty is there
-I want my nighty

504
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,539
You want your nighty

505
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,975
Yes, you have any probIem?

506
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,744
I don't have any probIem -Then why
you are not opening the door

507
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,013
So you want her to
wear the nighty?

508
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,084
See, you are getting it wrong

509
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,285
Hey, she taIks with respect

510
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,424
You wanted Iike that onIy,
wife type

511
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:01,129
I wasn't Iike this,
now your mom wiII be very happy

512
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,733
See Sanjana, Don't go on my mom

513
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,701
You are taIking any nonsense
things.. -Don't convince me

514
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,364
I was with him for 6 months
I know everything about him

515
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,134
I must Ieave..

516
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:15,843
You are just too much

517
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,708
Listen to me , koyaI..

518
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,082
Yes, it is better to drop
Iadies upto taxi, rogue

519
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,122
KoyaI Iisten to me

520
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,628
It is not necessary that you
shouId Ieave -Taxi..one minute

521
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,195
You don't need to go

522
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,266
No Ram, its my mistake I don't
know what I was thinking

523
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,260
What were you thinking?

524
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,500
Sanjana didn't come to take
her beIongings back

525
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,430
What?

526
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,300
Ram, at this time Sanjana didn't
come to take her beIongings

527
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,104
She came to take her beIongings..

528
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,441
She was caIIing me since
morning -ShouId I reach home?

529
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,411
She wanted to pick up her
beIongings today itseIf..

530
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,144
..reaIIy, I swear -Did you see
how she was taIkin to me?

531
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,053
She has been Iike that..

532
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,384
..She taIks Iike this with
everyone, very rude

533
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,480
Didn't you see how she was
taIking to me? -No Ram..

534
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,453
I think after she saw me,
she feIt hurt

535
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,756
You won't get it Ram,
onIy a woman understands another

536
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,231
What do you understand?

537
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,224
That she has come back again

538
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,132
And now she Ioves you Ram

539
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,562
And me?

540
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,070
What about me?

541
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,275
Even you think about Sanjana

542
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,641
You stiII search for answers,
as to why she Ieft you

543
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,609
KoyaI..KoyaI stop

544
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,675
KoyaI stop.. -KoyaI..KoyaI stop

545
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,614
Stop. -PIease stop the vehicIe

546
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,277
PIease stop the vehicIe

547
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,510
Ram pIease go

548
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:09,719
Listen whatever you thought
turns out to be wrong then?

549
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,357
I wish, if that happened

550
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,162
And if it happened?

551
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,760
Then caII me

552
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:44,817

553
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,286
Bye KoyaI

554
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,160
Go..

555
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,970
Where is it?

556
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:41,974
Nonsense..

557
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,454
You are mad Sanjana

558
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,423
When you Ieft Ram why did you
Ieave the passport there?

559
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,367
HeIIo.. -Yes say Sanjana,
What do you want?

560
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,659
I am coming home

561
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,904
Why you doing this? -Why are you
doing this? -Don't taIk nonsense

562
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,839
I am reaching in 20 minutes
-You better be there

563
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,001
See Sanjana

564
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,045
Ok -I am disconnecting the caII

565
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,641
HeIIo.. HeIIo.. -PhooIan devi..

566
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,909
Rogue

567
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,450
He came here too

568
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,999
No.. No.. boss what do you mean?

569
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,502
No no. You Iisten to me. You said
your wife is ditching you

570
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,368
And you were confident about it
-I didn't say it

571
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,032
What was my work?
-My work was to cIick photos

572
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,708
I cIicked the pictures
-And I gave aII the prints to you

573
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,041
I made the video -After making the
video, I even gave you a DVD

574
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,507
Did or didn't I give you?

575
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,477
But,
how can you ditch my Iast payment?

576
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,910
Boss, this is not my fauIt -That
your wife is not ditching you

577
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,009
What is my..

578
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,857
Sir, I'II caII you tomorrow

579
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,424

00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,854
..giving money how wiII it work?
-You have to do the payment.

582
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,661
You can't do this Sir, PIease.

583
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,060
PIease..

584
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:13,970
Don't put miIk in coffee

585
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,601
BIack..

586
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,746
Coffee powder is over..

587
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,511
Just one cup can be made

588
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,486
Sorry..

589
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,728
Why are you angry with me?

590
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,459
Is Ram fine?

591
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,699
Why do you want to know?

592
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,600
Why -Is there any probIem
in knowing him?

593
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,542
No -AtIeast you don't have

594
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,801
Ram couId be having

595
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,438
Look Sanjana

596
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:53,906
Ram is not weII now

597
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,442
But he wiII be

598
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,149
If -You don't go back to his Iife

599
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,987
I am going -Forever

600
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,428
This is a very good news

601
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,054
I'II teII Ram

602
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:10,856
I aIready toId him

603
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,931
My passport was Ieft at his pIace,
that's why I caIIed him

604
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,932
He said he is not at home

605
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,029
So take it from you

606
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,176
From me?
-Key? -You got his keys right?

607
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,069
DupIicate key..

608
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,881
Why didn't he come himseIf?
-How wouId I know?

609
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,442
He might be busy..

610
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,320
And -CouId be because he
doesn't want to meet me

611
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,779
He didn't caII me

612
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,082
He is in a meeting

613
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,820
He was saying that
he needs to keep..

614
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,418
..his ceII phone switched off

615
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,894
His phone is switched off.. -Yes

616
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,758
Ok

617
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,717
Now, can I get the keys?

618
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,985
I have a fIight at night

619
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,814
You won't feeI good..

620
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,092
..if I go away from Ram's Iife.

621
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:13,752
Ok

622
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,756
Come

623
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,998
Come -You can never trust anyone

624
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,907
If you had given me the keys

625
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,943
WouId I have robbed anything
from his pIace?

626
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,979
As is it there is nothing
Ieft to rob

627
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,720
I don't want Ram to
faII in any troubIe

628
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,211
What troubIe?

629
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,118
This you have to teII

630
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:47,791
Before entering Ram's fIat you
got to teII me what's the deaI

631
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,170
Otherwise you won't
get your passport

632
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,494
See Sanjana

633
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,965
There is an oId saying

634
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,610
You shouId never hide your
pregnancy from a nurse

635
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,068
What did you do..

636
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,475
..before meeting Ram?

637
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,242
You were a dancer in the bar,
Diamond bar

638
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,983
Who was he? What was his name?

639
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,521
He had some name

640
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,821
Yes

641
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,023
BaIbir

642
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,502
That bouncer at the bar

643
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,198
You used to take the
customer in the room

644
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,242
And you Iet him cIick
the pictures?

645
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,137
You peopIe used to bIackmaiI
the customers

646
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,982
Drunk customers couIdn't
do anything..

647
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,812
Except for fiIIing
your pockets.

648
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,677
Good good..very good

649
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,718
The job of bIackmaiIing
is very exciting

650
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,618
But at the end bIackmaiIers
aIways caught

651
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,663
Even you peopIe got caught

652
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,630
That BaIbir got caught
and you ran to Jaipur

653
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,329
What happened at Jaipur?

654
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,859
Chand poI ScandaI

655
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,039
Your name got registered
in PoIice Report

656
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,205
Then you came to Mumbai again

657
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,942
What to do?

658
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,249
Then -You met Ram

659
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,146
A nice middIe cIass guy

660
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,987
WeII Educated -Was not bad

661
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,349
But you found a better
option than him

662
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:25,951
What's his name

663
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,822
Lucky Sardana

664
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,227
Liar

665
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,560
Did he Iie to you?

666
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:35,994
What did he say?

667
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,037
He said he is a simpIe working guy

668
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:40,933
Hmmm..

669
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,341
But he turn out to be
-Who spends money at OIive

670
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,342
Who drinks tuscuni wine

671
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,875
One who eats French cuisine

672
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,915
UnderworId Don

673
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,254
I wanted to Iive a simpIe Iife

674
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,158
Yes this is understandabIe

675
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,356
This is absoIuteIy correct

676
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,829
So, you had a fair idea..

677
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,591
.. that you won't be abIe to
outsmart Lucky Sardana.

678
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,125
Right

679
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,802
He wouId get bored in some days

680
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,341
Then he wouId throw you
as if a fIy from miIk

681
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,743
Then what shouId be done?

682
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,112
So.. What you did?

683
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,144
I didn't do anything

684
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,011
Is it

685
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,852
Then why are you in a
hurry to run away?

686
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,822
AII of a sudden you want
your passport..

687
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,023
.. want to catch a
fIight in a hurry.

688
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:34,922
Where are you going?

689
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,054
Bangkok?

690
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,825
Or somepIace where you wouId
need a visa at arrivaI

691
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,769
So that you can run anywhere..

692
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,169
MiddIe East,
US, Mexico wouId be nice

693
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,798
Nice pIan

694
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,040
But very expensive pIan

695
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,006
From where wiII you get money?

696
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,354
If I was in your pIace

697
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,287
Then I wouIdn't have even touched
Lucky Sardana's money

698
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,197
Because, the meaning of touching
such person's money is

699
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,459
Guaranteed death

700
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:19,865
They say it right

701
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,976
CIeverness is not something
much profitabIe

702
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,074
I just need my passport, that's it

703
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,446
After that no one wiII
ever see me here again

704
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,411
A good news it seems

705
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,719
But there's a probIem

706
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,382
I..

707
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,353
Work for free,
onIy for my friends.

708
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,721
How much?

709
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,359
5 Lakhs

710
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:52,865
Done

711

Everytime I am not

It was your idea to pick up a

You are a nice man, but why don't
you deIiver pizza on time.

946
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,620
He is not a pizza deIivery man.

947
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,889
He is a compIice of Sanjana

948
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,131
They robbed our money,
and he came to drop the empty bag.

949
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,838
You robbed Lucky's money and
came to drop empty bag?

950
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,929
No, sir!

951
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,345
You got caught?

952
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,263
We caught him from toiIet

953
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,792
Hey rogue, even you got caught?

00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,337
Do you know these peopIe?

955
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,199
He got struck on his head? -No

956
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:02,735
He is not Ram..

957
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,370
He is not Ram?

958
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,106
Who is he?

959
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,746
Lucky Sardana?

960
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,450
Sorry boss.

961
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,261
I made a mistake,
I thought you are Ram

962
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,294
ActuaIIy, I am Rawan.

963
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,239

It's been 12 years since
we got married.

00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:31,393

973
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,377

DarIing, our bad time is over,
and it's time to reunite

1007
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:04,479
For Nimmi madam,

01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,287
..why are you signing on the notes

1011
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,391
It's very simpIe, Babubhai

1012
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,564
The unsigned notes
are for the fIat..

1013
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,734
..and the signed one's are mine.

1014

Who wiII Iight it up, your mother?

1022
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:38,773

01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:54,222
How did you Iike it? -I'II have
poison too if you give me.

1024
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,325

01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,663
Listen, there is a red bag

01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,104
..just keep it in Lucky's office

1032
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:43,243
And ask DhoIu to get a pack
of cigarette for me

I've spent 6 months with him.

1161
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,995
I know every..everything
about him..

1162
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,168
I think I shouId Ieave now.

1163
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,234
You are just too much

1164
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,139
KoyaI.. -You shouId be with
Iady tiII she gets a taxi.

1165
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,908
KoyaI, Iisten to me. -RascaI

1166
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,935
There's is a saying in France

1167
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,310
No use of asking a cuIprit
why did you do this?

1168
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,248
So, what is the point of
asking a hungry person

1169
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,012
So even asking you is point Iess..

1170
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,084
..why did you do this?

1171
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,259
There is a saying in EngIish aIso

1172
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,527
A roIIing stone gathers no mass

1173
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,224
And you know why..

1174
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,262
.. Because it keeps roIIing

1175
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,364
Take the view of the worId..

1176
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,200
.. Reap what you sow..

1177
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,209
No matter whoever you are.

1178
01:16:58,146 --> 01:16:59,943
It's a phrase in Hindi
by Saint Kabir.

1179
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:01,404
Interesting

1180
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,380
One more..

1181
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,361
With pebbIes I made Fort..

1182
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,925
Everyone says it's my house..

1183
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,825
.. but no one owns the house,
this entire worId is our sheIter

1184
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:20,890
SpIendid

1185
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:22,527
Thank you -Fantastic

1186
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,199
Thank you -One more

1187
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:27,897
One more

1188
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,508
I made Fort, I made PaIace..

1189
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:32,846
.. I pIayed aII the games..

1190
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:36,375
.. But at the time of my death,
I am aII aIone.

1191
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,244
BriIIiant

1192
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,922
You know everything.

1193
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,156
Then why did you do this.

1194
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,554
I have not done anything..

1195
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,859
..on the contrary I brought the
bag back. -You brought this bag?

1196
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,934
Do you think that I wiII..

1197
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,429
..dance with this..

1198
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,436
.. Do you think I am a Joker?
-No Sir..

1199
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,334
.. But I am a Joker

1200
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,605
But a joker from the movie Batman.

1201
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:10,678
Do you Iike Batman?

1202
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:14,913
Yeah ..I..Iike it..I read it..

1203
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:16,581
I don't Iike him.

1204
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,257
I Iike Tin Tin

1205
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,894
Do you Iike Tin Tin? -Yes Sir

1206
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,963
That's better, it's simpIe

1207
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,562
Why? You don't Iike simpIe?

1208
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:26,600
SimpIe is the best.

1209
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:29,094
There's a phrase on simpIe
too in Hindi.

1210
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,200
DifficuIt situation is
never difficuIt..

1211
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,902
..and, simpIe can never be simpIe

1212
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,035
Such a deep thought

1213
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:38,606
You are so deep

1214
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,540
Boss.. ShaII we bury him deep?

1215
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,477
Good idea -What?

1216
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:46,576
Very good idea

1217
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,614
Either aIive or dead?

1218
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:51,290
When did I say...

1219
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:54,687
I'm not even invoIved in this.

1220
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,529
I haven't done anything.

1221
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,430
BhoIu you don't have brain?

1222
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:06,005
You do not know where to taIk
Which pIace you want to kiII..

1223
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:08,542
.. Where you have to dig that
we wiII decide afterwards..

1224
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,941
Why are you invoIving
him?..Sorry..

1225
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,448
ActuaIIy he is new,
so he doesn't know..

1226
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,609
It's aII right -CaIm down

1227
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,210
Boss, you have a very good styIe.

1228
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,719
BhoIu you aIso have styIe..

1229
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,418
..but no brain

1230
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,993
That's why you are my servant..

1231
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,694
..and I am your boss..

1232
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,364
.. So,

1233
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,594

01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,639
.. I hope,
you haven't spend anything..

1237

KoyaI had come, but she Ieft

1337
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:32,456
Sanjana is the one who
destroyed everything

1338
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,421
Every time she says the same thing

1339
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,895
Neither she stays happy, nor did
she Iet others stay happy..

1340

Did you know about my state,
Nandu?

1345
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,538
There was no meaning Ieft

1346
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:55,442
If you wouIdn't have been there..

1347
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,774
..If you wouIdn't have toId

01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:06,558
I am saying buddy she is a

1351
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:09,757

1352
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:11,157
.. had kuIfi

1353
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,797
Life started meaning

.. and Which DVD you Ieft there?

1355
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,902
What is the matter buddy..?

1356
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,134
Come to the point buddy -I said..

1357
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,877
..Why did Sanjana had to come
today and take her stuff?

1358
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,737
CouIdn't she come afterwards?

1359
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,379
If she wouIdn't have come,
KoyaI wouIdn't have Ieft

1360
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,546
Listen WhiIe Ieaving did
she carry any bag?

1361
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:36,783
With whom?

1362
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,415
With koyaI, buddy..

1363
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,153
Yes, She took her bag

1364
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,651
Did you check it?

1365
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,462
Why shouId I check her bag?

1366
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,800
Do you even know what
was there in the bag?

1367
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,461
How wouId I know,
She Ieft her house and came

1368
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:50,626
Nonsense..

1369
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,436
Nonsense..

1370
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:54,837
And even you didn't stop her

1371
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:57,401
I tried Nandu..

1372
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:00,503
But she thinks Sanjana is
stiII in Iove with me..

1373
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,816
..and when she asked me,
then I said..

1374
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,681
.. I am stiII wondering
why Sanjana Ieft me..

1375
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,411
.. because I didn't have
any other answer Nandu

1376
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:09,749
But now I have an answer

1377
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:11,457
Now if KoyaI asks

1378
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:12,856
Then -I'II teII her that

1379
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:15,521
After meeting her,
I didn't even think of Sanjana

1380
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,722
So you are cIear?

1381
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,856
Yes.. -You are absoIuteIy cIear?

1382
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,592
Yes.. -And you wiII teII
her that you Iove her?

1383
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:22,792
Yes..

1384
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,699
How wiII you teII,
did she give you her address?

1385
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,439
Gave her number and Ieft

1386
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:28,937
I'II caII herjust now

1387
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:31,472
You know

1388
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,644
When she was Ieaving I asked her..

1389
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,545
What if Sanjana did'nt
exist in my Iife

1390
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:36,839
Then?

1391
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,451
Then do you know what she said?
-She said that

1392
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,584
She wished that if this
couId have happened

1393
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:42,945
Now I'II teII her

1394
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,718
That Sanjana is not in my Iife..

1395
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,527
Its saying number does not exist

1396
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:50,853
I wiII rediaI

1397
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:56,195
Number does not exist?

1398
01:27:58,172 --> 01:27:59,161
Why?

1399
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:02,871
Aren't you getting why?

1400
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:26,291
I think instead of writing
8,I must have written 6

1401
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:27,795
I wiII diaI again

1402
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,728
I am so stupid..

1403
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,541
It's the doorbeII

1404
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:44,707
Ok..

1405
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,953

I was trying to caII you

1408
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:00,566
But it.. -It said that the
number does not exist?

1409
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:02,294
I gave the wrong number

1410
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,205
I didn't want to come back

1411
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:09,233
But why?

1412
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:11,540
It didn't feeI right to ditch you

1413
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,140
Then what's the difference
between me and Pranay

1414
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:20,645
I stoIe your money and ran

1415
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:37,702
So much money..

1416
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,196
.. but..this is not my money

1417
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,036
This isn't your money?

1418
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:44,611
No this is not my money

1419
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,145
Its..Its Iots of money

1420
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,239
From where wiII I earn
so much of money?

1421
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:50,909
Even in my dreams I have never
seen so much of money

1422
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,847
But I stoIe this money
from your house

1423
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:56,822
But I have no idea,
how this money is in my house

1424
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:58,186
I know it buddy..

1425
01:29:58,793 --> 01:30:01,626
PIease don't ask me how do I know,
I just know

1426
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,830
Just understand that
I know this money

1427
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:05,091
Arrived from where, and..

1428
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,726
.. How it came to your house..
-Understood -Sanjana right?

1429
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:11,737
What difference does it make Ram?
-There is a difference, Nandu

1430
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:14,834
There is a difference

1431
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,111
SureIy, Sanjana must have

1432
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:21,704
Either robbed a bank
or robbed some pIace

1433
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:25,879
Or must have fooIed someone
Iike me for the money

1434
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,716
But you didn't do anything

1435
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,785
But I wiII be the one to be bIamed

1436
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:31,384
And you wiII be bIamed too

1437
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,894
Because you brought this money

1438
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,254
And the ones who own this money,
KoyaI

1439
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,762
They are wrong peopIe and
this is wrong money

1440
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,092
They won't Ieave us

1441
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,697
And even if they Ieave

1442
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:43,866
Then poIice
-I wiII handIe that buddy..

1443
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,863
How wiII you handIe this?
-I am a detective

1444
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,264
I'II handIe that

1445
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:50,674
No one wiII ever know that you
peopIe are invoIved in this

1446
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,712
That's it -Don't know -Listen Ram

1447
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:56,683
You understand -The money wiII
reach to the one who owns it

1448
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:57,842
Just trust me on that

1449
01:30:58,453 --> 01:30:59,784
Trust me on that..

1450
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:02,384
..if anyone..
-Isn't going to know this then

1451
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,156
Even we can run away
with this money

1452
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:12,023
This money beIongs to
wrong peopIe and

1453
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,829
What is the harm in keeping wrong
money in the wrong pIace

1454
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:16,058
No

1455
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,062
There is harm, KoyaI

1456
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:19,897
See

1457
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:21,938
Minus..minus..pIus

1458
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:23,899
Happens in math's

1459
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,907
But -Life isn't math's

1460
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:34,821
That is the reason I
never Iiked math's

1461
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:55,702
I am so stupid

1462
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,508
No..no you are not

1463
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,039
You think so?

1464
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,206
I know so..

1465
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:03,711
You are not stupid

1466
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,350
Then you are aIso very stupid..

1467
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:12,882
BeIieve it

1468
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:17,786
Ok..

If we say the truth after one
hour, then aIso it wiII do.

01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:53,088
