and Gautam Ghose

9
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:23,819
For a thousand years, I've
been wandering upon the earth

10
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,689
For a thousand years, I've
been wandering upon the earth

11
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:34,559
From the Ceylonese ocean to the
seas of Malaya, I've traversed it all

12
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:40,302
I've even been to the ashen
worlds of Emperor Bimbisara & Asoka

13
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,769
And gone further into the
darkness of the city of Vidharbha

14
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,734
I am but a weary soul

15
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,315
And as the ocean of
life foams around me

16
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,178
I've found my moments of
peace with Natore's Banalata Sen

17
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,146
Hey you! What do you want?

18
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,664
Nothing is happening tonight.

19
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,005
We're closed for the day.
And anyway I am not well.

20
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,073
What is so funny about that?

21
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,105
Weird! Don't you read what I say?

22
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,152
How many times do
I haveto tell you?

23
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,120
Jibonanondo? -
- Yes.

24
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,162
Printed in the same font,
but no fingerprints.

25
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,097
What nonsense!

26
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,731
The police is not a magician.

27
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,305
It can't solve cases overnight.

28
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,208
Sir, Pakrashi has been sitting
on this case for almost 8 months.

29
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,174
Would you call that "overnight"?-
- So what do I do?

30
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,521
Do I remove him from the case?-
- I'm not saying that, Sir...

31
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,524
Sir, please have a word with him.

32
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,489
I know it's an internal issue
of the detective department.

33
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,395
But the entire police
force is under pressure.

34
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,767
4 murders in 8 months, the
same pattern, same method.

35
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,967
People are scared of
going out at night.

36
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,509
Once the press gets to
know the entire case detail...

37
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:33,773
Listen Debu, I can't insult
Pakrashi by teaching him his job!

38
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,479
Have you seen his track record?

39
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,479
Can you name another
guy who's as patient...

40
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,023
...& intelligent as him?

41
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,489
Which means you'll
swipe the card again?

42
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,519
No way! Call your manager.

43
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,766
Call him! I need to
talk to him! Idiot!

44
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,492
Where the hell is your manager?

45
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,262
I got stuck!

46
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,473
What's wrong?-
- Ma'm, it was a mistake...

47
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,440
No! They are simply
trying to bluff me!

48
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,341
Thank goodness I
checked the bill carefully!

49
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,981
How much is it? I'll pay.
- No, why should you?

50
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,777
Are we here for charity.'

51
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,551
How is it a charity?

52
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,289
Come, tell me the amount,
and give me a void slip.

53
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,621
Bunch of lazy bums!

54
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,296
Why can't they do
their job properly?

55
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,193
This is not an easy job,
it'll take time.

56
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,234
But we have to expedite it.

57
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,768
We have to find out a way.

58
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,304
Sir, may be he needs some guidance?

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,435
As in?

60
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,776
Serial killing is a
special kind of crime.

61
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,415
It has it's own rules and
methods of investigation.

62
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,589
And as far as experience of
cracking such cases is involved...

63
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,721
Impossible.

64
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,032
But why Sir?

65
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,431
You know why.

66
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,407
But Sir, that was long
time ago in the past..

67
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,734
And I will not repeat
any mistakes from the past.

68
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,240
Sorry Sir, but you can easily
handle the issue if you want.

69
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,478
You know your classmate very well.

70
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,182
Is he really that
difficult to handle?

71
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,516
Yes.

72
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,522
Take it from me, as I know him.

73
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,058
Okay Sir.

74
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,326
Do what you feel is right.

75
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,597
But there's one thing
we both are sure of.

76
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,305
There's only one person
who can crack this case...

77
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,675
...in the entire country,
let alone this state.

78
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,734
So... did he hand you a thrashing?

79
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,007
What else? You think I
was born lame...

80
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,146
I did not ask for
your father's name!

81
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,748
Where's Khokon?-
- He's no more.

82
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,122
What do you mean?

83
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,191
I'm there because I squealed.
Khokon didn't, so he's not there.

84
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,194
The basic thing you need
to understand is that...

85
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,090
...I know everything.

86
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,661
Once you get that, you're through.

87
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,968
Understand?-
- Yes Sir.

88
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,479
Very good! Then
you'll be talking in here.

89
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,978
We needn't go to that room, right?

90
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,281
What do I talk about?

91
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,493
That means you did not understand.

92
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,021
Oh God!

93
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,699
Believe me Sir, I wasn't there.

94
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,031
I didn't do anything Sir. I swear.

95
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,967
That area belongs to
that rascal, Mohin.

96
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,600
Sir please listen to me,
let me go please.

97
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,472
I am not involved in all this Sir.

98
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,985
Was creating a scene necessary?

99
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:30,745
Yes, it was.

100
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,253
I'm not the stoic, impassive kind.

101
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,117
<i>What?</i>

102
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,662
Stoic... forget it.

103
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,223
Get off the road!

104
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,363
Hey move!

105
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,080
Weird! People celebrate
the World Cup victory...

106
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,123
...while a murderer is on the prowl!

107
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,961
You're venting your work
related frustration elsewhere.

108
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,967
As in?

109
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,903
<i>what?</i>

110
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,200
Tell me what it is, come clean.

111
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,508
I want to know.

112
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,704
What exactly did you imply by that?

113
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,207
I'm not trying to
create any scene Mam!

114
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,151
I have a very simple question.

115
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,990
Do all cases have to
be solved within a week?

116
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,952
And work for me isn't an office,
bullets move here, not files.

117
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,689
Mafia is a 'Powerpoint,
& not a presentation.

118
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,199
...no Micro, no soft works here.

119
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,271
Don't blabber in English!
Irritating!

120
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:03,077
Hey, wait! What the hell!

121
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,979
Had enough of a
geeky boyfriend, is it?

122
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,344
Okay, I'm requesting in English!

123
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:17,221
Hey! What's going on here?

124
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,153
I'm playing hockey! Want to join?

125
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,662
Rascal! I'll play with your dad!
- Which Police station?

126
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,661
<i>What?</i>

127
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,065
Which Police station?

128
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,409
Sorry Sir, I didn't know.
- Why not?

129
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,080
Because don't
look like a meat shop?

130
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,118
No Sir.
- But that's what Hindi films tell you.

131
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,745
Could you get me a cab?-
- No!

132
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,081
Get into the car!

133
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,748
Will you get me a cab?-
- Am rim, get into the car!

134
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,658
Please sit Mam.

135
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,131
Leave.

136
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,274
Hey, 90". go...

137
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:40,569
On each of your head,
the crow craps everyday

138
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:47,274
You can't clean it with your hands,
hence you look for paper

139
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,577
Do you want some puffed rice?

140
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,748
You look for dry leaves

141
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,425
Will you kindly go take a bath?

142
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:05,027
You hate your own excreta, & you
don't know how to take a bath!

143
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,237
You keep blabbering, I have to cook.

144
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,340
What fish?-
- What?

145
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,339
What fish have you brought?-
-'Telapia'.

146
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,976
What do I do?

147
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,073
There's no money. Do you
expect me to get lobsters?

148
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,743
I'll go mad some day.

149
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,587
I abhor lobsters!

150
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,680
Personally detest them!

151
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:28,684
Same bull crap!

152
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,953
You just watch!

153
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,153
One day they will have
to publish my poems.

154
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,293
Mark m y words.

155
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,564
Writing bull crap all the day,
and speaking bull crap too.

156
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,531
Wasting my life too!

157
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,366
Is Rabindranath there?

158
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,713
Yes, this is Nibaran!
Nibaran Chakraborty!

159
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:49,844
Come here young man, let's test
your skull with my penetroscope

160
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,612
Come here young man, let's test
your skull with my penetroscope

161
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,077
What portion of your brain is dull,
& what gives ground for hope

162
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,683
I'll quantify the withered
cells that clog your active tissues

163
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,295
And defiltrate the fizzy gels
from solid worthwhile issues

164
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,427
Lines from this Sukumar
Hay poem were found...

165
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,061
...beside the body,
on 11th September.

166
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,067
The victim was known by all.

167
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,571
Connection with the poem?

168
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,303
Sukumar Sukumar.

169
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,012
Head smashed in by a stone.

170
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,676
Second murder.

171
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,254
22nd October 2010. Harkata Lane.

172
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,584
Malati Kundu alias Rosie.

173
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,284
A prostitute.

174
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,649
Hit on the head first

175
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,590
And then, strangulation.

176
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,965
This poem was found beside her.

177
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,533
For a thousand years, I've
been wandering upon the earth

178
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:52,269
From the Ceylonese ocean to the
seas of Malaya, I've traversed it all

179
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,012
I've even been to the ashen
worlds of Emperor Bimbisara & Asoka

180
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,484
And gone further into the
darkness of the city of Vidharbha

181
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,216
I am but a weary soul

182
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,490
And as the ocean of
life foams around me

183
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,222
I've found my moments of
peace with Natore's Banalata Sen

184
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,533
Jibonanondo?-
- Yes.

185
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,128
Printed in the same font,
but no fingerprints.

186
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,071
Third case.

187
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,009
11th December, 2010.

188
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,339
The lane next to
Keoratola Crematorium.

189
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,113
Victim's name, Shubaran Dhol.

190
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,347
Grave digger by profession.

191
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,515
He was drunk.

192
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,753
Hun over by a car.

193
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,484
But, not just once.

194
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,991
Repeatedly.

195
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,093
Horrific!

196
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,973
A chit was lying
beside him, that read...

197
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,270
A bright fish flew once

198
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:05,741
Only to sink again into the visibly
blue, but actually transparent water

199
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:11,746
Having seen this pleasant sight,
a fruit blushed red

200
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,556
Ripening in a deep abyss of pain

201
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,985
Oh God!

202
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,284
What's the connection?

203
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,587
The name of the poetry book.

204
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,354
"Phire Esho Chaka".

205
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,456
Binoy Majumder.

206
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,259
No, thank you.

207
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,243
"Phire Esho Chaka"...as
in "Come Back O Wheel".

208
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,378
Right.

209
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,987
The fourth & the last one.

210
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,518
23rd March.

211
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,564
A notorious goon. Near Garden Reach.

212
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,126
Stabbed on the back with a knife.

213
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
After that, the body
was chopped into pieces.

214
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,337
No fingerprints.

215
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,142
Some Shakti Chatter ii lines
were found beside the body.

216
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,479
The boy erred in
breaking hard stones

217
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,514
Human beings were softer

218
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,983
Could've have broken
them instead into pieces

219
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:26,629
The boy was blind & hence
the stony roads went vain

220
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:32,067
Roads know where they're
headed for, high on their opinions

221
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:37,731
Human beings are cheap, the boy
could've torn them into pieces

222
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,058
Is that you?

223
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,651
Yes.

224
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,659
Almost done.

225
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,031
A few more.

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,658
What are you up to these days...

227
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,968
...out so late at night?

228
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,130
Mind your own business, you fool!

229
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,008
What do you know about poetry?

230
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,667
Where does poetry feature in this?

231
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,111
Listen, don't stay out so late.

232
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,479
It's on 'l'.V., crime is on the rise.

233
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,217
Shut up!

234
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,749
Don't lecture me.

235
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,687
This was destined to happen.

236
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,490
Go off to sleep.

237
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,351
I have a lot of work.

238
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,622
I've to take dates.

239
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,132
Who will you call
up so late at night?

240
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,395
That fellow...

241
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,603
...Rabindranath.

242
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,537
11 arrests.

243
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,472
...8 of whom you
have already released.

244
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,043
The rest are under observation.

245
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,543
The forensic lab is
failing to get any lead.

246
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,343
Same with the agents.

247
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,021
Even I have people to answer to.

248
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,097
Even in your department...

249
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,196
...your meteoric rise may not...

250
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,767
...be taken very well.

251
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,038
What is Debu da saying?

252
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,534
To remove me?

253
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,544
Why will Debu say anything?

254
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,207
I know.

255
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,186
I want you to work on this case.

256
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,719
And I know, you'll crack it.

257
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,982
But, may be...

258
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,759
I think you've lost faith in me.

259
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,967
So, what I'd suggest is...

260
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,137
...you should remove me.

261
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,500
No.
- One minute Sir.

262
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,433
I cannot follow somebody,
like a sidekick.

263
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,672
Why are you taking it that way?

264
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,240
Listen, this is
just about a guidance.

265
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,150
You will lead.

266
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,477
Take it as...

267
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,665
Prabir was my classmate...

268
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,965
We sat for the IPS
examination together.

269
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,535
Scion of a feudal family.

270
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,169
One second.

271
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,209
Prabir as in, Prabir Roy Chowdhury?

272
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,516
The one, who was
dismissed from the force?

273
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,987
Prabir had a problem.

274
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,317
His temper.

275
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,287
He took every criminal...

276
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,159
...doesn't matter
proved guilty or not...

277
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,564
...for his personal enemy.

278
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,371
And if he realized...

279
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,405
...that a criminal
couldn't be convicted...

280
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,767
...then...

281
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,409
One such incident occurred in 1999.

282
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:14,589
Monty Halder, an
influential promoter's son, died.

283
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,224
Rather Prabir killed him
in the name of encounter.

284
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,589
As usual...

285
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,562
...the media got involved.

286
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,972
People testified against him.

287
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,069
And you want to bring him back?

288
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,373
That too, for this case?

289
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,206
Yes.

290
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,715
I'll talk to the
higher authority in Delhi.

291
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,583
But why all of this?

292
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,329
And in every case, the
special investigation squad...

293
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,736
...had one member in common...

294
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,474
This classmate of your's?

295
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,572
Not just serial killing...

296
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,618
...he is immensely
knowledgeable about everything.

297
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,981
Sheer brilliance!

298
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,311
But...

299
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,721
Very bad-mouthed and abusive.

300
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,488
He may provoke you.

301
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,392
He might insult you as well.

302
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,203
If you can be patient,
you'll learn a lot.

303
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,738
Go to him Pakrashi.

304
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,747
Yes, I will, but...

305
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,148
...will the Bengali
audience prefer a morning tea...

306
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,589
...with "Jack, the Ripper"?

307
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,350
We have to ensure that,
with the way we serve it.

308
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,554
It's also about the awareness.

309
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,430
13 episodes...

310
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,067
...about the world's most
infamous serial killers.

311
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,370
On one hand the public
will watch the latest news...

312
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:21,611
...and on the other, they'll
relive a little bit of history.

313
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,082
All the cases are very violent.

314
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:31,651
Butchered bodies, sexual organs...

315
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,591
Will people watch?

316
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,323
Oh they will.

317
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,556
They sure will.

318
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,229
Like kids watch horror movies...

319
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,266
...with half open eyes, or
from behind trembling fingers...

320
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,642
Shurjo, we love to get scared.

321
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,444
If you talk about
showing violence...

322
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,115
...do you know what the
viewership rating was...

323
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,445
...when Gulf War was
being aired on T.V.?

324
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,756
Though the curfew has
not yet been declared...

325
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,118
When my city is
scared of the sunset...

326
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,227
"what should I show on my channel?

327
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,630
Or cute love triangles?

328
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,597
Let's finalize the names of the
serial killers for the program.

329
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,709
For sure Jack the Ripper.

330
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,813
The biggest celebrity in
the world of serial killers.

331
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:24,970
Rather, the trendsetter.

332
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,948
And then... Boston strangler

333
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,019
Whose lover?

334
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,356
No, nothing, I was just...

335
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,555
...reading
Browning's poetry last night.

336
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:44,293
Similarity of the poem's lover's &
Boston Strangler's modus operandi...

337
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,736
Forget it, you continue.

338
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,335
It'll get a nice literary angle.

339
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,667
Tell me...

340
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,769
...have Sharatchandra,
Bankim, or Rabindranath...

341
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,048
...written anything
on serial killing?

342
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,352
I'm not sure, I'll have to check.

343
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,524
Please check, it'll be a big
USP if we can cross refer.

344
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,390
...not 13.

345
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,258
Finalize 12 names.

346
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,593
We'll dig out the 13th episode,
not from the pages of history...

347
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,232
...but the pages of police records.
- As in?

348
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,741
With a real life serial killer,
in flesh & blood.

349
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:42,218
What I'm saying is,
we can talk this out.

350
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:46,524
You're talking all crap.
And listen, one second...

351
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,031
The pronunciation is "Phaltu".

352
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,396
There is no "F" in Bengali!
No such alphabet.

353
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,032
What do you mean by that?

354
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,134
Enough is enough!
I cannot drag this!

355
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,609
Please come down and
collect your things. Yes!

356
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,411
Take care!

357
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,444
Kanai. Hey Kanai!

358
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,179
You lazy asshole!

359
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,515
You anyway just come for an hour!

360
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,655
I'm not paying you so you
can smoke your opium here!

361
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,040
Come. I'll pummel the
living daylights out of you.

362
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,280
How many times have
I told you not to...

363
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,994
What do you want? Donation?

364
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,731
No donation.

365
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,967
And if you fool around with me...

366
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,769
...or else I'll lock you
up for the rest of life.

367
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:52,782
I had called you up.

368
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,249
I am Abhijeet. I've come here,
to discuss a case.

369
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,722
Yes.

370
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,464
I missed the lane.

371
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,969
12 minutes.

372
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,439
In the last 12 minutes,
the sunlight has traveled...

373
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,205
...to and fro the earth,
18¢ a halftimes.

374
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,638
The little humming bird has
flapped it's wings 72,000 times.

375
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,120
According to the reports, there
have been 8 rape cases in India...

376
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,689
...in the last 12 minutes,
and you...

377
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,592
...just missed the right lane?

378
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,126
<i>what'!?</i>

379
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,360
No, I don't drink.

380
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,289
Bournvita?

381
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,664
No. Thank you.

382
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,173
Sit.

383
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,076
So, tell me.

384
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,178
How may I waste my time?

385
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,280
It's regarding a case.

386
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:44,384
I mean, these murders that
are happening in the city.

387
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:51,628
We were wondering if you could
guide us a little about that.

388
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,434
Actually...

389
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,003
...the truth is...

390
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:03,008
...we have not yet been able to
find any proper lead till now.

391
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,442
Why?

392
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,079
No suggestions in
the test paper, is it?

393
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,546
What do you mean?

394
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,514
That's how it
works these days right?

395
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:20,356
Either donation, or reference,
or simple cheating.

396
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,593
Whether it be a doctor
or a police's work...

397
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,297
...you can't solve such
cases without using your brain.

398
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,308
No, Abhijeet.

399
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,417
I'd rather suggest,
you catch petty thieves.

400
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:49,782
Or, go become a security
guard for some politician.

401
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,653
Just a second.

402
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,462
We have already progressed a
lot with our investigation. Okay?

403
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,560
We have a lot of
preliminary evidence.

404
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,572
Quite a few arrests...
-investigation, my foot.

405
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,166
Arrests, my foot.

406
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,506
See Prabir babu, you've been...
- Sir.

407
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,474
<i>what?</i>

408
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,517
Not Prabir babu. Sir.

409
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,290
I am not a grocer.

410
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,661
I've been trying to make a very
simple proposal for along time.

411
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,067
Please tell me if
you would accept it.

412
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,638
Or else, we shall...
- Or else what?

413
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,736
Or else I shall finish
another drink and...

414
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,002
...you shall go back
home in your white car...

415
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,705
...to release all your
frustration in the bed.

416
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,783
A sick maggot shall kill
..a few more people and...

417
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,782
...the department will not be
able to do anything. Nothing at all.

418
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:03,028
You should see a doctor Sir,
you have a problem.

419
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,623
Yes,I do.

420
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,501
Because over the
years the department...

421
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,503
...is getting infested
with brainless morons.

422
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,565
And listen!

423
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,138
Tell Amit that this
is no brothel that...

424
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,410
...pimps will walk in to bargain.

425
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,516
Ask him me to meet me in person.

426
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,314
Then, I'll think about it.

427
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,586
Now get lost.

428
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,960
It was a stormy, windy night

429
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,192
A starry night

430
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:51,304
A night that was soaring high,
like a violent sea

431
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,054
It was a stormy, windy night

432
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,178
I shall take the rest tomorrow.

433
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,042
The keys are with the guard.

434
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,269
O great life, no more
poetry should you knit

435
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,403
Bring on the rigid, crude prose

436
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,680
Let rhyme, rhythm &
rhetoric wash away

437
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:03,444
Pound the hard hammer of prose

438
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,381
There's no need for
the soft poetic pleonasm

439
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,259
Poetry... I now bid you adieu

440
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:20,350
The hungry world is
decked with prosaic fiction

441
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,401
He said... I mean
what he said was...

442
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,505
...he said he will only give
it a thought if you go meet him.

443
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,668
Is this the way he said it?

444
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,403
More or less.

445
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,539
Bull crap!

446
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,281
He'll not use such decent
words even for his father.

447
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,413
The question is, are you going?

448
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,047
Are you going?

449
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,036
<i>Okay!'</i>

450
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,973
And when you realized Monty
Halder is not going to confess...

451
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,345
...what exactly did you do?

452
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,614
I passionately kissed him, Sir.

453
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,085
Right.

454
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,264
Your passion is very evident
in the postmortem report.

455
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,025
According to your
friend & colleague...

456
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,465
...Amit Kumar
Srivastav's testimony...

457
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,597
...this is not the first
time this has happened.

458
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,970
You have broken the
law several times...

459
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,170
...& displayed a violent way of...

460
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,014
Did I say anything funny.'

461
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,556
You guys are weird!

462
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,957
Your servant will clean your loo...

463
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,959
...& you'll complain
with a frown that...

464
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,155
...the phenyl was too poisonous?

465
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,432
I have nothing else to say.

466
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:37,094
Clearly, all the accusations against
Prabir Hay Chowdhury are true.

467
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,572
He doesn't regret insulting
the court of law... -

468
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,698
No, I don't.

469
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,968
It's simple maths.

470
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,974
I hate criminals & to
destroy their existence...

471
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,054
...I can go to any extent.

472
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,980
I've already lost enough,
& may lose again if the...

473
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,250
...cause requires.

474
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,257
I don't give a damn.

475
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,630
You scoundrel! How dare you!

476
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,639
How dare you call me
a lunatic! Leave me!

477
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,964
The killer poet strikes again.

478
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,703
On the Ballygunje foot bridge,
a beggar woman.

479
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,598
Smashing the head with a stone,
in the 'Stoneman Style'.

480
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,270
A poem was found beside the body.

481
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,466
I'll have to leave right now.
See you soon Sir.

482
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:25,975
And listen...

483
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,273
...keep yourself
free in the evening.

484
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,041
Why Sir?

485
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,583
I have a reunion with an old friend.

486
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,692
Another fight?-
- That's what she says.

487
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,398
And this time it's serious.

488
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,024
Good if it is.

489
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:49,601
I don't want a cop for a son-in-law.

490
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,967
You know what?

491
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,267
Take the opportunity,
and propose to her.

492
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,475
Strike the iron when it's hot?-
- Absolutely!

493
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,609
I don't understand this dram a.

494
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,607
You have grown up together.

495
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,718
You spend all the day
in each other's house.

496
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,715
Why don't you guys get married?

497
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,411
Moth er.

498
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,046
Hey!

499
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,525
Why are you lazing around?
Come on, finish your work.

500
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,151
Forget it. I have a headache.

501
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,189
I can't read all of this at one go.

502
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,960
I'm feeling pukish.

503
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:19,624
What was mom saying?

504
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,469
She was saying it is time,
we got married.

505
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,405
Not again!

506
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,167
Love, marriage, honeymoon, kids.

507
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,175
This is all an
entire race bothers about!

508
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,206
Another fight?

509
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:42,413
Oh God!

510
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,586
Don't you get fed UP?

511
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,390
This is the 5th time
in the last 8 months.

512
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,686
Forget it.

513
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,321
Make up with him.

514
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,260
Abhijeet is a good man.

515
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,992
May be the second best in your life.

516
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,160
But still, he is good.

517
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,404
You really want me to hit you?

518
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,604
No, believe me!

519
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,070
The guy is after all a
good prospective groom.

520
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,707
A little dumb.

521
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,283
Dry and short tempered.

522
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,540
It's not his mistake.

523
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,711
He spends the entire day
with thieves and dacoits(robbers).

524
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,523
Hey! Don't you speak
nonsense about him.

525
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,955
Cut the drama.

526
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,458
Isn't he "not that
important anymore"?

527
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,392
You're so irritating!

528
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,160
Hey Amu...

529
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,607
...how much does a sex
change operation cost?

530
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,702
What!
- No...

531
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,072
You flirt!

532
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:44,178
You don't worry. You're
position remains intact.

533
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:53,487
You mean, 'Platonic love'?

534
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,688
Only hearts, no hormone.

535
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,397
Who are you fooling?

536
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,264
What about the kiss, on
the 31 st December of 2001?

537
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:04,070
And what about that rainy
afternoon in this balcony?

538
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,539
That's because you pounced on me!
- Me?

539
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,974
Besides we were young.
Drunk and doped...-

540
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,704
...that dope... -We're
investigating it thoroughly.

541
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,276
We are hoping we shall
reach a solution soon.

542
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,415
Any message for the public
from the Kolkata Police?

543
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,694
And I am arranging
for the 13th episode.

544
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,021
Thank you.

545
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:33,334
This is the 5th murder.
People are getting desperate.

546
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,596
We just heard what the
Kolkata Police has to say.

547
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:40,038
But will they succeed in putting
an end to these mysterious killings?

548
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,976
With Parthosharathi at the camera,
this is Purushottam Pandit.

549
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,475
Star Ananda, Kolkata.

550
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,537
Hey you!

551
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,982
What do you want here?

552
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,708
What are you doing?

553
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,577
Didn't you see?

554
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,587
I scattered it all away in the wind.

555
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,723
My words.

556
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,117
My poetry.

557
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,562
I'm down, so I came to the...

558
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,097
...riverside for some fresh air.

559
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,462
You too have come...

560
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,065
...for the fresh air of the Ganges.

561
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,030
Same here.

562
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,002
I feel so demoralized.

563
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,408
Why so?

564
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,981
What else?

565
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,417
They don't like any of it.

566
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,219
They rejected all of these.

567
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,021
They say, it's becoming predictable.

568
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,220
What the hell man!

569
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,690
Is this some detective story?

570
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,021
Or poetic prose?

571
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,997
I got so angry to hear that. So I...

572
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,158
so?

573
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,168
Sol...

574
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,228
...nothing.

575
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,599
But a few he liked a lot.

576
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,072
My book will surely get published!

577
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,706
And do you know who
will publish the book?

578
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,413
Who'll do the proof reading?

579
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:04,608
Who?

580
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,587
Rabindranath!

581
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,420
That is wonderful!

582
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,956
You'll be awarded the
Nobel Prize one day.

583
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:13,117
Mark m y words.

584
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,161
And you will steal it, right?

585
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,692
Anyway, listen.

586
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,165
Amongst the few ones approved...

587
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:25,332
...I am reading you one.

588
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,531
Do you want to listen?

589
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,699
Yes, read it.

590
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:37,483
Obscene poetry & sedition
- this is what they were accused of

591
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,252
The poets were taken away in chains

592
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,254
aided by leading intellectuals.

593
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:51,490
From behind the veil, 'Victorian
morality smirked at this spectacle

594
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,960
as Macaulay's bastard
children danced unbashed on...

595
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,232
...the stage set by the hangman.

596
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,106
Fifty years have passed since..

597
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,075
...blowing the bugle of
the largest democracy

598
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:13,350
The reds, yellows,
saffrons & greens scream & gurgle

599
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,647
'this is for the plebians!'

600
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:24,960
As the fangs clash merrily"

601
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:29,401
"paper tigers appear

602
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,472
making nooses out of red tape

603
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,241
And in the land of red earth

604
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:43,277
Queen Draupadi sings and
toils the whole day long

605
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,122
Com e.

606
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:14,076
Come in.

607
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,549
Oh!

608
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,693
Amit Kumar Srivastav is here!

609
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,498
How are you?
- Good.

610
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,127
And you?

611
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,702
Exactly the way
you saw me last time.

612
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,239
Jobless.

613
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,037
Alone.

614
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,178
Let bygones be bygones.

615
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,416
Let's discuss work.

616
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,215
Work.

617
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,595
That's a word I haven't
heard in a very long time.

618
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,026
Work.

619
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,331
You know something Amit...

620
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:20,008
...I have hung curtains all
around the verandah, for years now.

621
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:25,615
I sit there in the afternoons.

622
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,581
I don't want my
neighbours to see that...

623
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,518
...a police officer honored
with the President's medal...

624
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,597
...is sitting at home,
because he has gone nuts.

625
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,229
I want you to take up this case.

626
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,396
I want you to join...

627
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,479
That, is what you want.

628
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,283
And what does your department want?

629
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,691
Let's say, I am the department?

630
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,322
Oh good!

631
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,395
You're a big guy!

632
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,198
So Abhijeet...

633
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,603
...how about some whiskey today.'

634
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,648
I don't drink.

635
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,058
Talking of serial killers...

636
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,494
...there's only one name
I can think of right now.

637
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,028
Rafiq Ahmed.

638
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,503
But after staying here for somedays,
he was transferred to "Tihar Jail.

639
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:54,167
And I don't know if you
will be able to interview him.

640
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:55,566
Why?

641
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,337
He has been in the
jail for 18 years now.

642
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:02,646
He has hardly spoken to
anyone during this period.

643
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,418
Can I go meet him at Tihar once?

644
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,649
I can arrange for that
at my personal risk.

645
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,158
But I don't think it
will be of any help.

646
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,691
I'd rather suggest you to...

647
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:20,597
...research about him properly.

648
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,693
From his file?

649
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,336
This has the prelim evidence
and the postmortem reports.

650
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,705
This has the prelim evidence
and the postmortem reports.

651
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,466
"Prelim" as in?

652
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:33,037
Pre... Preliminary.

653
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:41,716
Hope you intelligently
utilize the time you save?

654
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,321
I try, Sir.

655
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,352
We shall see.

656
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,224
So...

657
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,128
Kanai .

658
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,031
Kanai!

659
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,270
Oh no.

660
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:07,080
He is off from work today.

661
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,612
I have only one servant.

662
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,613
He comes twice a week, for an hour.

663
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,585
Get the suitcase kept at the
God's corner from your chair.

664
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,713
Put it here.

665
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,071
A tight fit.

666
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:16,640
How do I look?

667
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,146
I've grown old.

668
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,015
Not you.

669
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,646
I will not report to anyone,
but myself.

670
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,254
My decision is final.

671
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,325
I'll need a police
jeep for traveling.

672
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,329
I will need a
separate room to myself.

673
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,266
Right now, the
department doesn't have vacant...

674
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,475
Whose file is this?

675
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,986
During his stay here,
Hafiz made only...

676
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,079
...one friend here.

677
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,982
He was the only one
Hafiz would talk to.

678
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,322
He, too, was a convict

679
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,696
Was he convicted for murder too?

680
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,326
Well, not directly.

681
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,965
The fire that broke out in
the book fair in 1997...

682
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,698
...was later proved
to be caused by him.

683
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,399
Apart from one lac books
that burned to ashes...

684
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,109
...one person lost his
life in the stampede.

685
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,504
What a strange man!

686
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,482
He claim ed that he was a poet.

687
00:57:56,673 --> 00:58:00,519
In his confession he said he
was involved in some movement.

688
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,611
O great life, no more
poetry should you knit

689
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,511
Bring on rigid, crude prose

690
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,175
Let rhyme, rhythm &
rhetoric wash away.

691
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,180
Pound the hard hammer of prose

692
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,053
There's no need for the
soft bower of poetic pleonasm

693
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,684
Poetry, I now bid you adieu

694
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,960
The hungry world is
decked with prosaic fiction

695
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,328
The full moon is but
scalded flat bread

696
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,392
This is by Shukanto, right?

697
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,333
Yes, by the very well
known poet, Shukanto.

698
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,562
Yes, whatever.

699
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:53,630
Jobless.

700
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,200
No contribution to the society.

701
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,710
Just wasting paper & time.

702
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:04,108
We have to get some of these
useless books from the library.

703
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,615
We'll have to do a detailed study.

704
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,250
They couldn’t even get an
air conditioner in the room.

705
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,452
That means...

706
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:19,329
...the hard hammer of prose
pounded on the hungry world...

707
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:24,064
...translates to a huge
stone smashed on the head.

708
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,965
And it was a full moon night.

709
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,978
The problem is, the
locations he chooses are...

710
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,274
...scattered all over the city.

711
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:38,341
So, we cannot really
follow any particular radius.

712
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,449
Is there anyway we could
connect the locations?

713
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:50,964
Dumdum, Harkata Lane, Keoratola
Crematorium, Garden Reach, Ballygunje.

714
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,261
It covers a huge area.

715
00:59:56,359 --> 01:00:00,171
2 of the victims are
female and <i>3</i> are male, thus...

716
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,242
...the sexual angle too,
doesn't stand as a motive.

717
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,440
There is just one pattern.

718
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:08,607
The obvious one.

719
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,086
The association of
the victim with poetry.

720
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,051
A certain similarity.

721
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:16,955
A certain connection between the...

722
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,423
...poem's lines &
the method of killing.

723
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,117
And yes...

724
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,596
...all the poet's whose
poetry he uses, are dead.

725
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,191
But all that is not
good enough to help us.

726
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,605
The probable victim & Bengali
poetry, both are infinite sets.

727
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,173
There can be no
pattern to predict them.

728
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,434
As in?

729
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,175
Let say, the
murderer does not repeat...

730
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,982
...by the way whose
poems have been used?

731
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,585
Jibonanondo Das, Shakti Chatter ii...

732
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,714
...Sukumar Hay, Shukanto
Bhattacharya, Binoy Majumder.

733
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,148
Right.

734
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,452
Even apart from them...

735
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,324
...the number of dead
Bengali poets is huge.

736
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,522
Then calculate each
one's total number of poems.

737
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,194
It would be much easier if only
the murderer was Punjabi or Marwari.

738
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,198
Are you always this
regional in your opinions?

739
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,271
Not "regional". The right
adjective would be, "correct".

740
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,105
Anyway-

741
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,314
There's another pattern...

742
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,354
...that you've overlooked.

743
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,015
And, what might that be?

744
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:32,126
All victims are from the
lower rung of our social ladder.

745
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:33,627
And this profiling...

746
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,999
...shall help immensely in
building the Suicide Squad.

747
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,329
Suicide Squad?

748
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,495
What's that?

749
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:39,663
Oh God!

750
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,168
Illiteracy all over!

751
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,168
You've taken a
serial killing's case.

752
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,473
You don't know what
a Suicide Squad is?

753
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,304
No.

754
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,472
But I want to know.

755
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:50,979
Only if you would tell me.

756
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,643
Yes !

757
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,417
Since I have opened a
school here, I'm bound to teach.

758
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,959
I hope you know...

759
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,460
...a pawn is needed
to hunt for a tiger?

760
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,619
Now don't say...

761
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,256
...you don't know as you
haven't hunted a tiger yet!

762
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,467
Yes, I did not get that chance.

763
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:08,965
But I did get what you're saying.

764
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:10,694
Did you now?

765
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,295
Let's hear you then.

766
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,970
We have to select some
police officers who'll...

767
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,975
...look & dress up
like his target victims...

768
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,273
...& scatter them all
over the city. That's it.

769
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:23,013
Bravo! No one can stop you from
being awarded the "Bharat Ratna"!

770
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,407
Now go.

771
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,575
Find them.

772
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:26,982
With that kind of salary slip...

773
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,319
...you'll find loads of malnourished
idiots in the police force.

774
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,514
Now rush.

775
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,685
And listen.

776
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,999
Apart from that, we'll
need "Khochors" too.

777
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,362
You know 'Khochor'?

778
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,958
Or do I have to say
"Agent" or "Mole"...

779
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,334
...for your colonial hangover?-
- I know Sir.

780
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,530
I have some too.

781
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:47,697
Those are useless.

782
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,977
We'll need a proficient one.
We'll sit over it.

783
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,272
There's a pimp in Shonagachi.

784
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,436
He's pretty good.

785
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:54,604
And there's a pickpocket.

786
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,977
He is an absolute artist!

787
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,274
Can I ask you something?

788
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,348
Yes, sweet child of mine, go ahead.

789
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,646
You hate criminals, right?

790
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,551
“My then, do you
have them work for you?

791
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:05,582
Listen kid.

792
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,058
Basically we're all pimps.

793
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,955
Some pimp ministers,
some pimp God...

794
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,087
...you pimp our laws.

795
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,964
Far more decent...

796
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,693
...is to pimp women.

797
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,163
At least it lacks hypocrisy.

798
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,562
Poor Ratan may be exhausting...

799
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,029
---People's pockets.

800
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,969
And what about the powerful
ones who exploit the country...

801
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,702
...in the name of ideology?

802
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:42,552
Are you sure it's here?

803
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,490
What were you expecting?

804
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,123
A jailbird will reside
in South City Apartments?

805
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,326
Did I say that?

806
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,267
I don't think the
shopkeeper said it was this far.

807
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,336
That's because you
weren't concentrating.

808
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,971
That pretty girl who was
drying her clothes in the...

809
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,544
...verandah, you
were busy eyeing her.

810
01:03:58,601 --> 01:03:59,636
<i>Sweetheart...</i>

811
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,643
...will you be equally
possessive after our marriage?

812
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,416
Haven't things changed a lot?

813
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:09,950
How?

814
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:11,681
It's all the same.

815
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,283
Some guys are...

816
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,564
...sleeping & some
are doing all the work.

817
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,693
No one is noticing.

818
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,330
What do you think about Abhijeet?

819
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,165
I've started with
some basic set ups.

820
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,115
Though the real case will get
solved in the armchair, I'm sure.

821
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,544
That does not move.

822
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:42,712
The rook is there.

823
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,585
More like a mind game you mean?

824
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,251
Completely.

825
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,963
We have to enter the
mind of the murderer...

826
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,558
...to know why he is
doing these murders.

827
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,962
Only then can we find out...

828
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,339
...when & how he'll
go for the next kill.

829
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,046
Can I ask you a question?

830
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,023
Why one? Ask me lots.

831
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,684
Go on. You know I love babbling

832
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,130
Do you blame me for
that incident even today.'

833
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,392
No.

834
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,028
I used to.

835
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,031
But then, I realized...

836
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:39,638
...such things are painful, but
are a part & parcel of a cop's job.

837
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,084
And imagine my luck.

838
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,352
You weren't on duty and I
had to stand in for you.

839
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:53,450
It happens.

840
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,462
See, I always thought...

841
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:02,501
...I mean I had this feeling
from the very beginning...that...

842
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,035
...were dangerous.
They could do anything.

843
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,196
I know.

844
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,498
They did.

845
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:18,408
Anybody home?

846
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,394
We... we're here to meet Mr.
Nibaran Chakraborty.

847
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:33,590
Is he home?

848
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,025
What for?

849
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,634
We are from a T.V. channel.

850
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:39,605
We need a byte for a program.

851
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,637
Yes.
- Please come in.

852
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,436
Please come.

853
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:48,338
Please come.

854
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,712
Come on.
- Please com e.

855
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,596
We've come from a channel...

856
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,701
Nothing has been finalized.

857
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,613
We're still deciding on things.

858
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,711
Swapan! What the
hell is wrong with you?

859
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:25,041
Haven't you told them?

860
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,051
No,I mean, we are...

861
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,589
See, you'll be
informed when it's finalized.

862
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,355
All I can reveal is...

863
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,483
...it's releasing in this book fair.

864
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,990
Rabindranath has given me his word.

865
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:39,691
Rabindranath...

866
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,592
...has given you his word?

867
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:49,070
I guess there's been
some misunderstanding.

868
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,404
What exactly are you talking about?

869
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,240
My book of poems!

870
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,371
Why?

871
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,415
What are you here for?
- Oh no.

872
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,716
...we need some
information about a person.

873
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,248
Probably you know him.

874
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,687
And my poems?

875
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,282
My book?

876
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,617
Is it not important?

877
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,423
Because am not Mr.
Sunil Ganguly...

878
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,622
...you'll ignore me?

879
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,261
Isn't it? Tell me! What the hell!

880
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,596
No, see, all I'm saying is...

881
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,998
No way. I'm don't know anything.

882
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:18,697
I can't tell you anything.

883
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,430
Please let me...

884
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:24,170
- Are you sure your book is
releasing in this year's book fair?

885
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,335
Of course!

886
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,403
I mean...

887
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,272
...that's what they are saying.

888
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,720
You should not
trust anyone. Sit down.

889
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,158
We've come here to warn you.

890
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,595
Right now, do not trust anyone.

891
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,698
Neither Rabindranath Tagore,
nor Nazrul.

892
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,229
Yes, I know.

893
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:54,973
It's been 33 years, but...

894
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,101
...no one has kept his word

895
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,035
You guys are right!

896
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,471
Right.

897
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,106
Absolutely right!

898
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,674
Those swines...

899
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,614
You will...

900
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,162
...cover my book release, right?

901
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,224
Or, are you bluffing?

902
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:23,164
No, see...
- We're carrying the contract with us.

903
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,694
But there's a clause in it.

904
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,629
There's a condition.

905
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,072
Condition? What condition?

906
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,272
I will recite the poem I want to.

907
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,175
Then don't come up
with personal requests!

908
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,278
"Please read that once, Sir!"

909
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,981
I will not tolerate all that.

910
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,716
I don't do cabaret.

911
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,043
I'm a poet.

912
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,013
That will be your call.

913
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,690
There's something else
where we need your help.

914
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,017
What sort of help?

915
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,061
We need some information
regarding a friend of yours.

916
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,182
There's no milk at home.

917
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:14,677
But there's sugar.

918
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,590
Do you like sugar in your tea?

919
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,685
Hey, I'll give you one tight slap!

920
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,286
You fool!

921
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,160
Didn't I ask you to put
your hand in the pocket?

922
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,692
Your such a scatter-brain!

923
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,068
Go home! Get lost!

924
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,265
Only use your hands, not voice!

925
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,037
No.

926
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,646
But now that you're back Sir...

927
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,412
...I'll be alert.

928
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,984
If you see or hear
anything suspicious...

929
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,522
...inform me or him.

930
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,222
He's my student. He is
learning the job from me.

931
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,518
<i>Okay.</i>

932
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:56,686
What are you doing these days?

933
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,498
You already know everything Sir.

934
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,496
As always.

935
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,399
But I am growing old now.

936
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,365
I've got hold of students.

937
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:06,971
I tutor them at home.

938
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,434
So, Abhijeet?

939
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,974
Do you realize the importance of...

940
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,479
...private tutions in the
educational system of our country?

941
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:18,708
By the way"-

942
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,078
...we need to allot him
a particular area, right?

943
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:27,486
You wouldn't say that
if you knew his network.

944
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:31,690
He knows everyone, from the
small fry to the big fish.

945
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,357
<i>what?</i>

946
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,697
Why are you laughing like a clown?

947
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,070
You're exaggerating, Sir.

948
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:43,276
But, I do know a few people, Sir.

949
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,068
I know that.

950
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,138
That's it for today then,
we'll leave now.

951
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:52,051
You're getting old, be
careful with your work.

952
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:53,983
Skills wither away with time.
And if you're caught...

953
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,181
...I'll beat the hell out of you!

954
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,585
You are embarrassing me Sir.

955
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,391
You are my Godfather.

956
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,958
But even today, a
thrashing from you...

957
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,224
...keeps me assured
of your love, Sir.

958
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,461
Rascal!

959
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:11,333
But, I haven't yet
grown so old as yet, Sir.

960
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,563
Hey! This is mine!

961
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,299
What the...

962
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,690
Initially, he wouldn't speak to me.

963
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,693
Then, suddenly one night,
he started talking.

964
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,325
I started listening to him.

965
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,327
And then, gradually, I
started speaking too.

966
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:41,065
With time, he started opening up.

967
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,464
What did he tell you about himself?

968
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,271
He lost his mother in his childhood.

969
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,230
Just like me.

970
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,707
His father was a 'Maulvi'.

971
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,337
They were very poor.

972
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,977
His father used to
beat him up daily.

973
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,307
His childhood was
subject to a lot of perversion!

974
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,351
Poor kid, couldn't
do anything about it.

975
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,183
And then, one day, he
killed a lot of people.

976
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,349
What!

977
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,517
Suddenly?

978
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,018
Suddenly.

979
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:11,387
Yes! Suddenly!

980
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,191
I mean...

981
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,497
- He used to dream of
a different world.

982
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,634
A world with mesmerizing beauty...

983
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:21,664
...overflowing joy...

984
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:24,344
...celebrations... music...

985
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,241
He was damn right
in killing them all.

986
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:28,976
He had the courage to
call a spade a spade...

987
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,711
...& the spine to
revolt ...so he did!

988
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:33,409
Do you have the guts?

989
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,178
<i>Okay.</i>

990
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:38,485
But why did you set
the book fair on fire?

991
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,988
What crusade was behind that?

992
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,333
Kindly leave, if
you're done with the tea.

993
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,698
I've a lot of work.

994
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,233
I have to call
Rabindranath and much more.

995
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:57,033
Tell me one thing...

996
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,570
...who has send you?

997
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,517
What else are we left with?

998
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,579
Suicide Squad is ready.

999
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,524
The faces in the Suicide Squad
were making me suicidal though!

1000
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,594
The agents have been planted.

1001
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,494
Police posting too has been...
- Oh, ignore that.

1002
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,494
You can't track down a
serial killer like this.

1003
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:30,471
For how long & where all
will you post those lampoons!

1004
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,078
The solution will be found,
sitting in the drawing room itself.

1005
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:41,077
Just one pattern that would
help anticipating the next kill.

1006
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,622
Just one mapping. Just one.

1007
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,223
The poetry books need to
be read thoroughly Abhijeet.

1008
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:51,227
But from our side we are...

1009
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,400
Yes, go on...

1010
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,531
What happened to you?

1011
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,710
No, nothing happened.

1012
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,979
Then why are you
stammering like an idiot?

1013
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,141
I just said nothing's wrong.

1014
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:15,278
Then why are you cranky,
and why that frown?

1015
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:16,712
Are you menstruating?

1016
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,217
Stop the car Ramu.

1017
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,017
Why?

1018
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:22,958
Don't stop the car,
keep driving Ramu!

1019
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,224
Can't you hear me, Ramu?
Stop the car!

1020
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,529
Keep driving straight!-
- You will stop the car!

1021
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:29,965
You are not going anywhere!

1022
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,138
Ramu, you'll stop the car right now!

1023
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:35,970
Keep driving! You
are not going anywhere!

1024
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,035
I'm your senior.

1025
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:44,310
You swine! Don't you
dare fool around with me!

1026
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,715
Show that attitude somewhere else!

1027
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,990
I suspend you!

1028
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,524
Come & collect the letter tomorrow!

1029
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,504
Why did you have to
piss him off needlessly?

1030
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,470
He was gradually opening up anyway.

1031
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:03,098
It was not intentional.

1032
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:04,642
It just slipped out.

1033
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:06,302
You know what...

1034
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,638
...he's no better
than your serial killer.

1035
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,246
He burns down the book fair...

1036
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,183
...& then claims that, he
needs to call Rabindranath!

1037
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:15,546
He's totally nuts!

1038
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:19,019
Anyway, we'll get some
more information next day.

1039
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,630
And then the final interview,
at Tihar.

1040
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,157
That, only if
Mr. Hafiz speaks up, at all.

1041
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,264
Only if Mr. Nibaran Chakraborty
could've been the murderer...

1042
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,064
...things would be so much easier.

1043
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,267
We could finish the
interview in Kolkata itself.

1044
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,267
Just think about it...

1045
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,974
...poet plus serial killer.

1046
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,177
Bengalis would've just lapped it up.

1047
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:47,614
I'd not really mind one.

1048
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,412
Anyway, chuck that.

1049
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,952
I'll get to doing what
I brought you here for.

1050
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,392
There's a grave
issue we need to address.

1051
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,398
Get serious, will you!

1052
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,966
Okay, let's get to work then.

1053
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,406
I have decided that...

1054
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,077
...I'll propose to you day after.

1055
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,374
<i>what?</i>

1056
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:21,377
What happened?

1057
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,511
Why are you laughing?

1058
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,249
I am serious!

1059
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,388
I'm telling you beforehand,
so you are prepared.

1060
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,326
Don't give me that
cliched girlie reaction!

1061
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,394
Please, I never do that!

1062
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:36,059
- Don't you give me those airs!

1063
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,265
Why the hell are you
laughing like an idiot?

1064
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:40,597
If I accept the proposal...

1065
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,035
Hey there...

1066
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:48,537
...your names please!

1067
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,274
We're from the press.
- One minute.

1068
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:51,645
What?-
- Shurjo Sinha.

1069
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,986
What's your business here?

1070
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:56,515
What?-
- Let me handle this.

1071
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:58,423
What did she just say?

1072
01:21:58,546 --> 01:21:59,581
No, nothing.

1073
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,057
I said, "Kindly mind
your own business"

1074
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,623
Oh really? Okay, if you insist.

1075
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,531
Come on, let's get to
business then. - See...

1076
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:08,657
Come, let's go to
the police station!

1077
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:17,505
Kanai, how many times have I
told you, inform me before you...

1078
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,148
What do you want now?

1079
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,499
Your suspension order is ready.

1080
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,397
There's no point cribbing now.

1081
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,167
I shall not tolerate
insubordination at any cost!

1082
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:52,510
I have handled much
bigger smart asses Abhijeet!

1083
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,647
You are no big deal for me!

1084
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,415
Don't you mess around with me!

1085
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,682
<i>what?</i>

1086
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,959
Why are you standing
like the Gateway of India?

1087
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,222
Could I have some whiskey?

1088
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,234
We were cootchie-cooing.

1089
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,267
Will you please shut up!-
- Yes for sure!

1090
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:24,400
I do have a problem!

1091
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,979
During this time of the day...

1092
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:29,480
...couples are found
doing all the wrong things.

1093
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,981
Hence, we have to
keep a check you know.

1094
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,077
Listen, let alone chatting up.

1095
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,955
But slapping a cop too,
is a punishable of fence..

1096
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,257
...according to the IPC.

1097
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,166
Name please! And the channel's too.

1098
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:05,175
I've seen you somewhere, I
can't remember where though.

1099
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:08,085
He'd booze up every night.

1100
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:11,683
Then, he'd shout & abuse.

1101
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:17,323
Every night he created a scene.

1102
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,496
Otherwise, he was a good man.

1103
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:25,694
I mean, he was very good.

1104
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:30,237
But, after a couple of drinks...

1105
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,342
Alcohol is such a..

1106
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:34,503
-...great thing!

1107
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,349
It was your father's
problem if he couldn't handle it.

1108
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,147
Neither the alcohol's, nor yours.

1109
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:49,418
Then...

1110
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,258
...the man deserted us.

1111
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,597
...the man deserted us.

1112
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,160
...14 back then.

1113
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:04,968
My mother was left alone...

1114
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:08,604
...in that house.

1115
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,518
And then...

1116
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:18,580
...I shifted to...

1117
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:19,953
...Kolkata.

1118
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:28,590
Job.

1119
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,233
I was very... very... alone.

1120
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:38,706
Good that he left.

1121
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:40,974
Very good in fact.

1122
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,980
It's better to part &
behave like humans...

1123
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:49,146
...than to live together,
like animals.

1124
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:52,548
Hey!

1125
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:54,488
What size bra do you wear?

1126
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,965
Why are you weeping like women?

1127
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,132
Don't try to tell me what sorrow is.

1128
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:13,705
I've cremated my wife & child,
with my own hands.

1129
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:20,251
The next morning I
reported at the police station.

1130
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,955
Always remember...

1131
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:26,582
...you are the luckiest on earth.

1132
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,259
There's someone, somewhere
always unluckier than you.

1133
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:39,564
That way, life seems...

1134
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:42,431
...like a cakewalk.

1135
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,535
You...

1136
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,172
...you don't have anyone?

1137
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:50,977
As in, someone...

1138
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:55,544
Someone as in ?

1139
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:01,016
Women?

1140
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:04,620
I have.

1141
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,563
I have many girlfriends.

1142
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:09,968
All of them stay together

1143
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:13,161
At Shonagachi(brothel).

1144
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,077
No strings attached.
No expectations.

1145
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:22,704
Just...give& take.

1146
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,041
Don't you have...

1147
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:31,682
Yes, I have one.

1148
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,385
I mean...l had one.

1149
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:39,588
“My past tense?

1150
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,393
We broke up.

1151
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:48,463
We were together
for quite a few days.

1152
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:54,703
It didn't work out.

1153
01:27:58,072 --> 01:27:59,710
Why were you blaming your father?

1154
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:01,982
Didn't you do the same thing?

1155
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:06,686
No. But they were...

1156
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:10,388
...married to each other,
but weiusi had a...

1157
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:13,394
...a...live-in relationship.

1158
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:15,691
Bull crap!

1159
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:18,026
That too is a marriage...

1160
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,037
...according to the 'Gandharva' way.

1161
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,338
The Veda has 8 types of
marriage written in it, you fool.

1162
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,707
Prajopatwo' isn't the only one.

1163
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:31,016
That "live-in" of your's...

1164
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:33,084
...hasn't been
imported from America!

1165
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:35,646
We had it since thousands of years.

1166
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,959
Okay. In that case we got...

1167
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:44,394
...divorced according
to the 'Gandharva' way.

1168
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:50,591
Amidst huge fights...

1169
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,236
...violent and emotional ones...

1170
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:56,966
...have you ever felt like...

1171
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,067
“hugging her suddenly?

1172
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,537
But how is that...

1173
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:08,450
Buy a bunch of
roses tomorrow morning.

1174
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,680
Don't even think of
orchids or carnations.

1175
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,321
Some cliches have no equals.

1176
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:15,485
And along with the flowers...

1177
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,686
...a Cadbury.

1178
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:22,263
Swiss chocolates won't work.

1179
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,498
Your phone is ringing.

1180
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:32,367
Yes, Abhijeet?

1181
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:34,472
Could you come down?

1182
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,481
What's wrong, so late in the night?

1183
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:37,708
Nothing much.

1184
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,518
We've had to bring your
girlfriend to the station.

1185
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,622
They got into a mess with a cop.

1186
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:44,951
There's a guy with her too.

1187
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,325
We could do things
faster if you'd come down.

1188
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:51,353
I'll be there.

1189
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,956
And, any progress on that case?

1190
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,225
Oh crap.

1191
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,028
The call got disconnected.

1192
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:07,341
He's coming. Meanwhile,
tea, coffee... or anything?

1193
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:21,016
I'm okay.

1194
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,963
Take him home,I don't
know where he lives.

1195
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,562
We'll take him,
Sir. I know his house.

1196
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:35,030
I know where he lives.

1197
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:38,033
I am absolutely in my senses.

1198
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:42,173
I am alright!-
- Okay, come on now.

1199
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:45,149
The car... keys...

1200
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,409
I am alright!

1201
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,177
Be careful.

1202
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:52,013
You go sit with him.

1203
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:54,282
Listen !

1204
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:57,385
You're Amrita, right?

1205
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,696
Learn to differentiate
between Dal-Rice and Biriyani.

1206
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:05,067
The former is a necessity.

1207
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:06,661
The latter, a luxury.

1208
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:16,538
Mind your steps.

1209
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,246
Just a minute.

1210
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:22,715
What's wrong?

1211
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:33,498
Why did you drink when
you're not used to it?

1212
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:47,337
I 'm okay.
- Come.

1213
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,480
I was hungry...
...besides I'm not used to it.

1214
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:26,281
That proposal is
temporarily postponed.

1215
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:30,250
Let's see after 20 years or so,
if you're single again...

1216
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:33,081
...I’ll try again.

1217
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:01,245
We'll fight in the evening
& part our beds at night

1218
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:04,045
For weeks we'll be staunch enemies

1219
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,387
till we make sudden
love in a midnight

1220
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:12,155
Crazy woman with you,
I'll give in to abstinence

1221
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,392
Crazy woman with you, I'll
play your Adam & you my Eve

1222
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:17,592
Joy Goswami.

1223
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:23,100
In which year was Bishnu De
honored with the Gyanpith?

1224
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:27,076
1970.. sorry, 1971 , the year
of Bangladesh's freedom war.

1225
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:29,273
Good! You seem to
have memorized it all!

1226
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:30,639
Now, tell me..

1227
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:31,978
...how is the
Hungrealist movement...

1228
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:34,280
...related to Bengali poetry?

1229
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:36,078
Through history.

1230
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:41,126
In 1960 this Hungryalist or Hungry
Generation movement was launched.

1231
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:43,621
It's propounders were...
Malay Hay Chowdhury...

1232
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:45,020
Samir Hay Chowdhury...

1233
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:46,187
...Tridib Mitra...

1234
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,164
Subimal Ghose,
Shaileshwar Ghose, etc. poets.

1235
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,630
Their poetry challenged the
stability of the establishment.

1236
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:55,573
Very hard hitting...

1237
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:56,698
...strong...

1238
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:00,505
...poetic language that declared
war against corruption & the system.

1239
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:02,975
A lot of their work was banned...

1240
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,607
...on grounds of obscenity.

1241
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:09,420
The state filed a case against them.

1242
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,955
Some of the famous poets...

1243
01:34:12,046 --> 01:34:14,151
...were involved in
it as state witnesses.

1244
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:17,488
Yes, a coffee.
- Make that two.

1245
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:20,689
You're having coffee?

1246
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,707
When and how did
Jibonanondo Das die?

1247
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,979
He was hit by the tram. Year...

1248
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:36,342
...l don't remember
the year exactly...

1249
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:40,611
...1955 or 1956...
and the month was...

1250
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:44,052
22nd October.
- Yes, 22nd October.

1251
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,684
22nd October!

1252
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,453
How could I miss it? I
just read it yesterday!

1253
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:51,688
The 2nd murder, that
poem beside the dead body!

1254
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,132
So? Does that mean, all
the rest of them too...

1255
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,596
Does your phone have internet?
- No, let's go to office.

1256
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:00,535
No. Let's not waste time.

1257
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:03,098
Right behind you.

1258
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:08,273
Give me the dates & the names of
the poets whose poems he used...

1259
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:11,717
10th September, Sukumar Hay.
22nd October is already confirmed.

1260
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:16,714
11th December, Binoy Majumder.
23rd March, Shakti Chatter ii.

1261
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:18,682
Wait. Just a second...

1262
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:30,568
Death, 1923.

1263
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,027
Now we're talking.

1264
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,503
Wait, let's confirm the others.

1265
01:35:38,365 --> 01:35:39,969
11th December, Binoy.

1266
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:48,245
23rd March, Shakti, and...

1267
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:51,384
...13th May, Shukanto, right?

1268
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:55,686
They'll match.
They're bound to match.

1269
01:35:56,984 --> 01:35:59,294
No more guessing, Abhijeet.

1270
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:02,161
Matched. Confirmed!

1271
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,025
<i>Now when'!?</i>

1272
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,969
Now the dates have
to be narrowed down.

1273
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:11,602
Mark the death anniversaries of all
famous Bengali poets after 13th May.

1274
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,410
Who's left? Whose death
comes up next in the calender?

1275
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:19,176
See, there's Rabindranath Tagore.
Apart from him...

1276
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:21,077
...Nazrul...

1277
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:23,947
...Nazrul's is in August

1278
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:26,149
After that...

1279
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,685
...Bishnu De, that's
much later, in December.

1280
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:33,021
Hey wait!

1281
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:35,595
I was just about to miss him!

1282
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:38,326
Who?

1283
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:42,974
Michael Madhusudan Dutta.

1284
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:48,244
You're not publishing it?

1285
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:50,982
Is this a joke?

1286
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:55,045
I've met you so many times.
You promised!

1287
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,177
What the hell!

1288
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:59,313
Excuse me? Wait a second!

1289
01:37:00,247 --> 01:37:01,282
Obscene?

1290
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:03,689
And who decides that? You?

1291
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:06,555
What do know of poetry?

1292
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:10,329
You just know how to rhyme
words in the name of poetry!

1293
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:19,443
Damn you Rabindranath!

1294
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:22,030
Listen...

1295
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:27,578
Do you really have to go?

1296
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:31,640
I told my mom, I'll be late,
but I'll dine at home.

1297
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,147
At least that...
- Tell me something...

1298
01:38:38,178 --> 01:38:40,954
...your mother, does not...

1299
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:42,686
"approve of me at all, right?

1300
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:49,490
...she is a little scared
of the kind of work to you.

1301
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:56,199
We've broken up 5 times in a year!

1302
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:57,435
She is confused.

1303
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:02,310
But this time, I really got scared.

1304
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,962
You had a nice time with
Shurjo all this while, didn't you?

1305
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:27,702
Don't be a jiealous cat!
Of course I did!

1306
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:32,200
Besides...

1307
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:34,636
he's been
interested in you eternally.

1308
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:40,212
If you stop speaking crap,
I'll give you a fantastic news!

1309
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:43,948
There's no "F" in Bengali.
- There is no alphabet, yes.

1310
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:48,549
I can give you a fantastic news!

1311
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:52,495
Shurjo & I went to the
slum for some work &...

1312
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:56,958
...this is confidential.
- Will you start?

1313
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:00,430
Come in.

1314
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:02,968
Sorry to disturb you Sir...

1315
01:40:03,063 --> 01:40:05,509
...a man called Ratan
has come to meet you.

1316
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,704
Send him in.

1317
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:13,979
Okay, you get to work.
I'll leave for home.

1318
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:19,380
Com e.

1319
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:22,483
Come in.

1320
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:27,589
Sir, my spy from
Khalashitawla informed me.

1321
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:31,534
After hearing him, I thought
he might be of help to you.

1322
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:34,299
He's very scared. He was
not willing to come to you.

1323
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:36,167
I forced him to come down.

1324
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,067
You wait outside, I'll talk to him.

1325
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:49,653
What got you so agitated?

1326
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:52,947
It's finally ringing!

1327
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:55,684
Yes Probir-da, Abhijeet here.

1328
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:56,955
Sorry to disturb you so late.

1329
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:58,961
Witness?

1330
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,227
I've been trying
your number as well.

1331
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:02,490
The line was engaged.

1332
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,230
Probir-da, I think we found our man.

1333
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:09,967
I'll come down &
update you. I am coming now.

1334
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,973
Yes, I'll be there right now.

1335
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,568
Where are you going?

1336
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,709
He was not like this earlier.

1337
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:21,184
As in, he was not as ill.

1338
01:41:21,675 --> 01:41:25,589
Now a days, he often goes
out from the house at night.

1339
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:28,285
God knows who all he keeps calling.

1340
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,959
A few days back, I returned
from the market to find...

1341
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:36,296
...he had shattered
everything in the house.

1342
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:40,334
He was crying, lying
on the floor & saying...

1343
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:44,170
...that he'll kill the man who
refused to publish his book.

1344
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:47,973
Sometimes he was saying,
he himself will die.

1345
01:41:49,303 --> 01:41:51,715
I'm quite scared, Sir.

1346
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:54,719
I sleep right there, near his room.

1347
01:41:56,076 --> 01:41:58,215
What if he...
- No, wait.

1348
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:01,955
Who does he want to kill,
& who did he keep calling?

1349
01:42:02,049 --> 01:42:05,496
I don't know the
names Sir, but often...

1350
01:42:05,586 --> 01:42:07,964
...he talks to a man named...

1351
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:13,502
...Rabin... Rabi...

1352
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:14,629
Rabindranath?

1353
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:16,606
Oh 'yes!

1354
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:18,637
Yes,that's him.

1355
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,649
In which year was he jailed?

1356
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:31,249
That was long back...
- Which year?

1357
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:34,681
It's been around 15 years.

1358
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:38,558
He was alright back then.

1359
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:40,090
He was not insane.

1360
01:42:42,222 --> 01:42:46,034
Dig out Nibaran Chakraborty's
entire history from the file.

1361
01:42:47,127 --> 01:42:48,572
You'll find it in
the old store room.

1362
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:52,068
As far as I remember,
his case was under me.

1363
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:54,146
Swapan, we'll meet that chap...

1364
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:56,308
...l mean your master,
day after tomorrow.

1365
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:59,109
But the situation at
home right now...

1366
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:01,444
We need to examine
this very situation.

1367
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,319
Otherwise, we'll not be
able to cure his insanity.

1368
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:06,080
Don't worry.

1369
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,357
We'll not disclose
our real identifies.

1370
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:09,684
Don't be scared.

1371
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:13,487
We gather your master won't suffer
any spell of madness till 29th June.

1372
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,089
But...

1373
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:16,224
<i>---but Why?</i>

1374
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:20,533
Day after tomorrow, 10 am.

1375
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,266
We work for a magazine.

1376
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:27,971
We're publishing a
special issue on the...

1377
01:43:28,068 --> 01:43:29,376
...history of Bengali poetry.

1378
01:43:30,137 --> 01:43:32,981
We would be obliged if..

1379
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:35,986
...we could publish an...

1380
01:43:36,076 --> 01:43:37,987
...interview with you in it.

1381
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:44,956
Since you hold astounding knowledge
regarding our subject, so...

1382
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:49,261
Another two like you
had come that day.

1383
01:43:51,191 --> 01:43:56,140
So... our first question would be...

1384
01:43:57,598 --> 01:44:00,977
...why did the poetry of the
Hungry generation or the...

1385
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:03,605
...Hungryalist movement,
fail in Bengali poetry?

1386
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:05,176
Who says it failed?

1387
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:07,042
You? Or him?

1388
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,012
No, but...

1389
01:44:11,311 --> 01:44:12,949
...in 1965...

1390
01:44:13,113 --> 01:44:14,148
Get it clear kid.

1391
01:44:14,314 --> 01:44:15,952
The movement was not a failure.

1392
01:44:17,117 --> 01:44:18,687
Rather, the society failed.

1393
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:21,056
The literature failed.

1394
01:44:21,722 --> 01:44:23,167
They failed to understand us.

1395
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:25,500
But that doesn’t matter at all.

1396
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,167
If they don't understand simply...

1397
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:30,100
...then, we have other ways.

1398
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:33,269
Is it true, that you set the
book fair on fire, because...

1399
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:37,580
...your book was refused a doesn’t
due to it's obscene content?

1400
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:40,986
If they can have Dr. Binayak
Sen imprisoned for life...

1401
01:44:41,508 --> 01:44:43,249
...what else can I expect from them?

1402
01:44:43,977 --> 01:44:45,081
Hell, yes I did it!

1403
01:44:45,512 --> 01:44:46,991
An infected system!

1404
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:49,561
Every human being is rotting here.

1405
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:53,393
Corpses are wandering around.

1406
01:44:54,588 --> 01:44:55,623
Don't you get the foul smell?

1407
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:58,970
Yes I can.
- But to get rid of that".

1408
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:01,972
...foul smell is the job of the
police, the law. Not the poet's.

1409
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,166
Which idiot says that?

1410
01:45:03,664 --> 01:45:04,972
Are we some piece of crap?

1411
01:45:05,532 --> 01:45:07,512
Are we to tolerate
everything like vegetables?

1412
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:10,373
We will be raped, and we will...

1413
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,182
...we'll write! We'll shout.

1414
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:15,644
And if the system has
a problem with that...

1415
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:17,315
...we care a damn!

1416
01:45:18,712 --> 01:45:19,952
Do you know, that this...

1417
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:22,960
...doctrine of
destruction that you espouse...

1418
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,553
...has no place in a Democracy?

1419
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,961
Democracy.

1420
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,098
Swapan .

1421
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:35,704
What is Democracy?

1422
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:39,140
What is Democracy!

1423
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,644
The vote... that is
happening in the next month...

1424
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,205
Got the picture?

1425
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,956
For 80 % of our
country's entire population...

1426
01:45:52,045 --> 01:45:54,491
...democracy stands for, just,
the right to vote.

1427
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:57,558
All the other rights
are under your control.

1428
01:45:58,518 --> 01:46:00,964
If I am stopped from writing...

1429
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:03,564
...l shall avenge it in my own way.

1430
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:06,966
If my pen is strangled...

1431
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,999
...l shall strangulate as well.

1432
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:11,502
No regrets?

1433
01:46:11,598 --> 01:46:12,633
No!

1434
01:46:13,433 --> 01:46:14,468
I'm glad I did it.

1435
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:15,975
I'll do it again.

1436
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:17,713
Call it my way of revolting.

1437
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:19,709
Stop me if you can!

1438
01:46:19,806 --> 01:46:21,615
That means...
- You must leave now!

1439
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:23,345
Come on, get lost!

1440
01:46:25,078 --> 01:46:27,354
I need some darkness

1441
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:32,629
A dense darkness masks the sky

1442
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:37,291
a darkness as
mysterious as the light

1443
01:46:38,191 --> 01:46:40,501
like the woman I haven't ever seen

1444
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:44,707
but the beauty of whose
face I have always adored

1445
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:49,704
That darkness deepens
into the sky of the spring

1446
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:54,408
Sad.

1447
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:57,020
He's mad! I think
he's completely insane!

1448
01:46:57,978 --> 01:47:01,687
Insanity depends on which side
of the lunatic asylum you reside.

1449
01:47:02,315 --> 01:47:04,022
Are you defending a criminal?

1450
01:47:04,117 --> 01:47:05,152
You think so!

1451
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:07,562
I'll not even think
twice before finishing him.

1452
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:10,229
He's sick, & it's my
duty to get rid of him.

1453
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:12,698
But the man did have a point...

1454
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:14,963
There's only one
obstacle in our way.

1455
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:18,710
Nothing but circumstantial
evidence will work in his case.

1456
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:22,145
May be we know that he
is the killer, but...

1457
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:23,270
- I know.

1458
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,247
Thus we need to
catch him red handed.

1459
01:47:25,705 --> 01:47:27,378
Get prepared for 29th June.

1460
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:29,385
Do or die. Come on.

1461
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:01,642
Take your position.

1462
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:31,649
Here, chew the cud.

1463
01:48:33,139 --> 01:48:34,174
Come on,take it!

1464
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:15,954
Now, com e!

1465
01:49:25,992 --> 01:49:27,027
After me.

1466
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:56,216
Is he going to the police station?
- God knows!

1467
01:50:57,717 --> 01:50:59,560
Let's not take a chance! Come on!

1468
01:51:02,555 --> 01:51:04,967
Stop you scoundrel! Or I'll shoot!

1469
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:08,506
Hey you! Freeze at once!
Or I'll shoot! Freeze!

1470
01:51:17,103 --> 01:51:19,982
You? What are you doing here?

1471
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:21,980
My master has gone mad, Sir!

1472
01:51:22,542 --> 01:51:23,953
Something disastrous
is about to happen!

1473
01:51:24,444 --> 01:51:26,424
He's burning down all his poems!

1474
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:27,958
He is going to destroy everything!

1475
01:51:28,314 --> 01:51:31,420
He is going to destroy everything!

1476
01:51:32,585 --> 01:51:34,622
Please save me Sir! Please save me!

1477
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:39,103
We don't have time!
Get the jeep! Quick!

1478
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:48,175
Probably we've lost him.

1479
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:50,037
Damn!

1480
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:51,980
Not again!

1481
01:52:13,259 --> 01:52:14,294
We were right.

1482
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,073
We lost him.

1483
01:52:28,608 --> 01:52:29,712
Not just a suicide.

1484
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:33,290
He has left his epitaph.

1485
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,961
He's maintained his pattern...

1486
01:52:43,056 --> 01:52:44,967
...even in the last murder.

1487
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:51,237
Stop a while traveler!

1488
01:52:51,998 --> 01:52:55,707
Should Mother Bengal
claim thee for her son

1489
01:52:56,669 --> 01:53:02,176
As a child takes repose on
his mother's Elysian lap

1490
01:53:03,009 --> 01:53:04,955
Even so here in the Long Home

1491
01:53:05,044 --> 01:53:06,955
on the bosom of the earth

1492
01:53:07,046 --> 01:53:10,619
enjoys the sweet eternal sleep
Poet Madhusudan of the Duttas

1493
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:13,109
A month later...

1494
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,975
Tomorrow is 22nd of
the month of Sraban.

1495
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:18,981
Rabindranath
Tagore's death anniversary.

1496
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:22,246
On this occasion various
programs have been organized...

1497
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:26,480
Good morning.

1498
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:27,614
Good morning.

1499
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:30,120
Whats up?
- Nothing much. Care for some tea?

1500
01:56:31,117 --> 01:56:33,028
Not really, in a hurry.
Where's our lady, not ready yet?

1501
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:34,521
In the process.

1502
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,023
She's inside.

1503
01:56:36,589 --> 01:56:38,125
Last minute touch-ups.

1504
01:56:38,224 --> 01:56:39,294
Wow!

1505
01:56:43,596 --> 01:56:47,203
You look as pretty as the
quintessential neighbor's wife!

1506
01:56:48,267 --> 01:56:51,180
Listen, heat up last
night's left over for lunch.

1507
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,544
I'll be late.

1508
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:55,042
And whose turn is it now?

1509
01:56:57,043 --> 01:56:58,420
They've built the set at Kobordanga.

1510
01:56:59,312 --> 01:57:00,347
Sir called up.

1511
01:57:00,446 --> 01:57:01,948
lam meeting him tonight, let's see.

1512
01:57:02,982 --> 01:57:05,053
He said something
important has come up.

1513
01:57:05,385 --> 01:57:06,489
Say hi to Prabir-da.

1514
01:57:08,154 --> 01:57:09,224
It can rain any moment.

1515
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:10,460
I will if I remember to.

1516
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:12,968
Come on!
- Yes.

1517
01:57:16,996 --> 01:57:18,976
Listen...

1518
01:57:20,099 --> 01:57:22,340
...don't flirt too much.

1519
01:57:22,602 --> 01:57:23,637
Are you nuts?

1520
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,615
She is Mrs. Inspector after all!

1521
01:57:26,272 --> 01:57:27,307
Sir...

1522
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:28,511
...l value my life!

1523
01:57:28,608 --> 01:57:29,643
Moron! Get going!

1524
01:57:36,349 --> 01:57:37,419
Oh yes,welcome!

1525
01:57:38,584 --> 01:57:40,222
You've become punctual!

1526
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:42,157
Sit, give me 2 minutes.

1527
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:47,695
Do you have any payment pending?

1528
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:49,262
No Sir.

1529
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:53,041
Just the overtime in
the month of February...

1530
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,979
No, you must take it now.

1531
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:58,711
Who can predict the future.

1532
01:58:01,607 --> 01:58:03,609
Do you write, "Ha" or "Ho"?

1533
01:58:20,426 --> 01:58:21,962
I'll take your leave then?

1534
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:23,163
Yes, please.

1535
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:29,536
Oh yes.

1536
01:58:30,002 --> 01:58:31,072
Let me introduce.

1537
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:34,274
Yes?

1538
01:58:34,674 --> 01:58:36,278
He works for Kolkata Police.

1539
01:58:36,976 --> 01:58:38,353
My colleague-cum-friend.

1540
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:39,616
Hello.
-cum-Student.

1541
01:58:41,214 --> 01:58:42,318
Very bright student.

1542
01:58:42,582 --> 01:58:44,687
And he is Rabindranath Maitra.

1543
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,593
He runs a printing press...

1544
01:58:47,353 --> 01:58:49,162
...and publishes a little magazine.

1545
01:58:49,322 --> 01:58:50,357
He is himself a poet too.

1546
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:53,061
He is doing me
favour regarding an issue.

1547
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:54,496
You're embarrassing me Sir.

1548
01:58:55,161 --> 01:58:56,435
I've known you for so long!

1549
01:58:57,630 --> 01:58:59,576
I've just tried to
contribute within my meager means.

1550
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:02,446
To help the Police is our...

1551
01:59:02,535 --> 01:59:03,570
That's enough.

1552
01:59:04,403 --> 01:59:05,438
You may leave now.

1553
01:59:11,577 --> 01:59:12,612
I don't quite get this.

1554
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:15,618
Are you coming up
with a poetry book now?

1555
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:17,321
Are you being smart with me?

1556
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:19,361
I'll give you one...
- No but...

1557
01:59:19,452 --> 01:59:23,958
...what's with this
printing press, little mag...

1558
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:26,195
"and you?

1559
01:59:26,292 --> 01:59:28,101
Don't act smart with me Horatio.

1560
01:59:29,262 --> 01:59:34,041
There are many a wonders in the
world that you still don't know of.

1561
01:59:36,669 --> 01:59:37,704
No.

1562
01:59:40,106 --> 01:59:41,346
Acting smart again?

1563
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:42,576
Wait.

1564
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:46,680
Forget Kanai.

1565
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:48,957
He must have bunked work like usual.

1566
01:59:50,516 --> 01:59:52,154
I've never seen his face till date.

1567
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:57,259
Get us a couple of drinks.

1568
01:59:59,992 --> 02:00:01,027
Swapan?

1569
02:00:03,262 --> 02:00:04,468
Told you Horatio!

1570
02:00:05,731 --> 02:00:07,506
There are many such wonders.

1571
02:00:08,334 --> 02:00:09,369
Don't be surprised.

1572
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:11,037
It's a long story.

1573
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:13,344
I tell you over the drink.

1574
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:15,110
No, but...

1575
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:16,643
...who is this guy?

1576
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:18,448
Kanai or Swapan?

1577
02:00:18,978 --> 02:00:23,950
First tell me, what have you
meager from me in all these days?

1578
02:00:24,984 --> 02:00:26,019
Any observation?

1579
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:29,155
<i>what?</i>

1580
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:30,624
Yes, I've...

1581
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:32,692
...meager to...

1582
02:00:34,126 --> 02:00:36,072
...follow a
pre-confirmed method to...

1583
02:00:36,162 --> 02:00:37,197
Oh no!

1584
02:00:37,296 --> 02:00:38,604
Again that same bookish language!

1585
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:42,705
Did anything strike you?

1586
02:00:43,135 --> 02:00:44,409
No, nothing in particular.

1587
02:00:46,205 --> 02:00:47,240
...though...

1588
02:00:49,141 --> 02:00:50,586
...there's this one thing.

1589
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:55,323
Everything fell into place, I mean"

1590
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:56,484
...like a jigsaw.

1591
02:00:57,583 --> 02:01:01,497
The right people came out with
the right lead at the right time...

1592
02:01:02,188 --> 02:01:03,223
like some...

1593
02:01:03,656 --> 02:01:08,696
...like the script of a
naive Bengali thriller. Right?

1594
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,565
Quite so.

1595
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:16,036
Another point to be noted would be..

1596
02:01:17,136 --> 02:01:18,171
...I mean...

1597
02:01:18,337 --> 02:01:19,975
...I’ll bring it up
only if you allow...

1598
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:22,642
With pleasure.

1599
02:01:24,577 --> 02:01:27,057
When you took up the case...
you said...

1600
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:31,051
...you'll issue some books on
Bengali poetry from the library.

1601
02:01:31,517 --> 02:01:33,053
I was just going
through those books.

1602
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:36,962
The right pages are
folded according to the case..

1603
02:01:37,456 --> 02:01:39,299
...they've been marked,
but that's natural.

1604
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:43,232
Strangely, all the
books have been issued...

1605
02:01:43,996 --> 02:01:45,441
...since May, last year.

1606
02:01:45,998 --> 02:01:47,238
But you took up the
case only this year.

1607
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:48,368
Elementary my dear Watson!

1608
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:53,106
Here it comes.

1609
02:02:06,585 --> 02:02:07,620
You may go.

1610
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:14,494
Now would you...

1611
02:02:15,594 --> 02:02:16,698
Enough poetry.

1612
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:19,232
Let me tell you a
story in proper prose.

1613
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:26,108
A story of a...

1614
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:29,219
...strict & ruthless man.

1615
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:33,387
The prime priority in his life was..

1616
02:02:39,085 --> 02:02:40,587
...to annihilate criminals.

1617
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:44,499
People were terrorized by him.

1618
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:48,505
And those who were not
terrorized enough...

1619
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:50,198
You could do away with the pronoun.

1620
02:02:50,996 --> 02:02:52,441
I know this man very well.

1621
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:54,634
Do you now?

1622
02:02:55,668 --> 02:02:58,581
Tell me, what was
his favourite smell?

1623
02:03:01,006 --> 02:03:02,041
Smell?

1624
02:03:03,175 --> 02:03:04,449
You don't know him at all.

1625
02:03:06,579 --> 02:03:08,957
Neither that of the
wet soil after a rain...

1626
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,619
...nor that of new books,
not even that of petrol.

1627
02:03:13,185 --> 02:03:16,962
It was the pungent smell of the
dark, murky, walls of the jail...

1628
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:20,003
"stained by the piss
of countless criminals.

1629
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:23,968
The smell of the
Constable's salty sweat...

1630
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:25,974
...rising up from a
heap of dusty files...

1631
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:27,442
...during hours of
long power failures.

1632
02:03:29,368 --> 02:03:33,407
And that
interrogation room? Amazing!

1633
02:03:35,007 --> 02:03:37,544
That was a dreamland!

1634
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:40,415
Little droplets of blood...

1635
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,082
...mixed with a few
droplets of tears.

1636
02:03:44,316 --> 02:03:45,954
A few whispers.

1637
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:48,455
A little bit of painful scream...

1638
02:03:50,322 --> 02:03:51,357
<i>What?</i>

1639
02:03:52,458 --> 02:03:53,493
Already scared, are you?

1640
02:03:55,661 --> 02:03:57,038
No, please continue.

1641
02:03:58,998 --> 02:04:02,969
In one such interrogation room,
I broke a criminal's useless leg.

1642
02:04:04,336 --> 02:04:06,976
Those spineless
reptiles from that gang...

1643
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:08,710
...barged into my house.

1644
02:04:10,109 --> 02:04:11,486
My wife and & kid were at home.

1645
02:04:12,511 --> 02:04:15,958
I was standing in
for Amit, who was...

1646
02:04:16,048 --> 02:04:17,186
...off sucking up to some minister.

1647
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:19,686
When I came back home...

1648
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,025
...everything was over.

1649
02:04:32,231 --> 02:04:33,266
Two ice-cold dead bodies.

1650
02:04:39,338 --> 02:04:42,319
I wasn't aware...

1651
02:04:42,408 --> 02:04:43,443
Oh please don't bother.

1652
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,345
Why should you be sorry?

1653
02:04:49,582 --> 02:04:51,220
That loss tore me apart.

1654
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,619
But...

1655
02:04:54,587 --> 02:04:55,622
...what could I have done?

1656
02:04:57,389 --> 02:04:58,424
We are cops.

1657
02:05:00,292 --> 02:05:01,327
If we sit and brood...

1658
02:05:04,463 --> 02:05:05,635
"who will protect the city?

1659
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:14,982
I reported straight at the duty,
from the crematorium.

1660
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:37,563
You see, it's a violent story.

1661
02:05:38,998 --> 02:05:42,445
I was skeptical about your
reaction as an audience.

1662
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:46,278
Sol had to drug you.

1663
02:05:50,242 --> 02:05:51,243
Headache?

1664
02:05:56,649 --> 02:05:58,128
Think about it Abhi.

1665
02:05:59,318 --> 02:06:02,128
What have I not
sacrificed for this Police force?

1666
02:06:03,656 --> 02:06:06,967
I've worked day & night,
like a prostitute.

1667
02:06:07,459 --> 02:06:09,439
One fine morning these
traitors call me & say...

1668
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:11,264
..."Thank You Sir."

1669
02:06:12,264 --> 02:06:13,402
..."Your services will
not be required anymore"!

1670
02:06:20,272 --> 02:06:21,580
So, one day I decided...

1671
02:06:23,342 --> 02:06:24,946
...that I'll create a situation...

1672
02:06:25,978 --> 02:06:30,620
...so that those maggots
will have to come back.

1673
02:06:31,717 --> 02:06:32,957
They'll go down on their knees.

1674
02:06:33,185 --> 02:06:34,220
They'll beg me, to rejoin.

1675
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:39,626
Is it hurting too much?

1676
02:06:54,373 --> 02:06:57,217
Serial killing was
the only option I had.

1677
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:59,589
What else would they need me for?

1678
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:04,352
And what else could I
have designed so flawlessly?

1679
02:07:05,384 --> 02:07:06,556
You know very well...

1680
02:07:08,554 --> 02:07:09,589
"that it's my..

1681
02:07:12,591 --> 02:07:13,626
You mean...

1682
02:07:16,996 --> 02:07:18,134
...all those innocent people...

1683
02:07:19,331 --> 02:07:20,366
What could I have done?

1684
02:07:22,334 --> 02:07:23,642
I did not have another way out.

1685
02:07:25,604 --> 02:07:28,244
A goon, a beggar, a
completely insane poet...

1686
02:07:30,175 --> 02:07:32,246
...killing whomever
was convenient, you know.

1687
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,956
But why are you getting so bothered?

1688
02:07:36,582 --> 02:07:40,496
The guinea-pigs you murdered
during your biology practicals?

1689
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:43,327
Can I call you a murderer then?

1690
02:07:44,657 --> 02:07:47,331
So, Nibaran Chakraborty
didn't commit suicide?

1691
02:07:47,426 --> 02:07:48,461
No.

1692
02:07:49,228 --> 02:07:51,037
A false case needs a...

1693
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:53,972
...false serial killer.

1694
02:07:55,134 --> 02:07:57,444
And until & unless
the false killer dies...

1695
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:02,145
...how am I to get all the
credit to solve the case?

1696
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,015
Think about it.

1697
02:08:09,648 --> 02:08:11,423
Nibaran's case had been under me.

1698
02:08:12,418 --> 02:08:15,160
It was very easy
for me to frame him.

1699
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:18,559
I got Nibaran busy with Mr.Maitra.

1700
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:23,368
He'd often go out late in
the night, regarding his book.

1701
02:08:24,129 --> 02:08:27,406
And then, Mr. Maitra him self
created the reason for the suicide.

1702
02:08:28,267 --> 02:08:29,712
He refused to publish the book.

1703
02:08:31,003 --> 02:08:32,038
And what about Swapan?

1704
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:35,383
An erstwhile butcher.

1705
02:08:36,008 --> 02:08:38,955
Then he was imprisoned for a murder.

1706
02:08:39,578 --> 02:08:41,353
He'll do anything for money.

1707
02:08:42,581 --> 02:08:45,425
And now, he's our only witness.

1708
02:08:46,985 --> 02:08:48,225
Kanai is very a useful chap.

1709
02:08:49,221 --> 02:08:51,633
He kept an eye on Nibaran.

1710
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:54,128
He led you to the prime suspect too!

1711
02:08:54,993 --> 02:08:56,973
And in the end...
- He poisoned his tea!

1712
02:09:00,265 --> 02:09:05,010
Now I understand why you
closed the case so hurriedly.

1713
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:10,984
...nothing was examined properly.

1714
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,491
So, you killed them all?

1715
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:17,617
Oh no.

1716
02:09:18,117 --> 02:09:19,289
I've grown old.

1717
02:09:20,519 --> 02:09:22,089
I'd explain everything to Kanai.

1718
02:09:22,454 --> 02:09:25,230
I'd give him the poems.
He executed it all.

1719
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:31,973
So, you didn't kill
with your own hands...

1720
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:33,099
Hands?

1721
02:09:33,999 --> 02:09:35,376
What about the brain?

1722
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:38,277
If I have planned the murders,
then I am the murderer.

1723
02:09:38,604 --> 02:09:39,639
Simple maths.

1724
02:09:40,672 --> 02:09:41,707
But...

1725
02:09:43,008 --> 02:09:46,478
...I’ll commit the
last murder, myself.

1726
02:09:46,578 --> 02:09:49,616
But you just said...

1727
02:09:49,715 --> 02:09:51,956
...Swapan poisoned Nibaran's tea!

1728
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:53,620
Idiot! Don't be silly!

1729
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,433
That was not the last murder,
it's going to happen today!

1730
02:09:58,323 --> 02:09:59,495
Today is the 22nd of Sraban!

1731
02:10:12,004 --> 02:10:13,039
That means...

1732
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:16,578
...it's my turn.

1733
02:10:39,665 --> 02:10:40,700
No.

1734
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:44,704
You have a lot of work to do.

1735
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:48,718
You have to arrest Kanai.

1736
02:10:51,043 --> 02:10:53,956
You have to close the case file.

1737
02:10:56,582 --> 02:10:59,062
You have to purge the
society from it's impurities.

1738
02:11:01,687 --> 02:11:02,961
I had thought...

1739
02:11:04,656 --> 02:11:08,968
...my son would grow up to be a...

1740
02:11:09,061 --> 02:11:10,972
...strict cop...

1741
02:11:11,063 --> 02:11:12,474
...just like me.

1742
02:11:15,334 --> 02:11:16,438
But he too...

1743
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:19,705
...ditched me.

1744
02:11:23,342 --> 02:11:24,480
...you can do that.

1745
02:11:29,548 --> 02:11:31,960
On the contrary...

1746
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:35,964
...I’m almost done.

1747
02:11:38,123 --> 02:11:39,966
After being
dismissed from the force...

1748
02:11:41,226 --> 02:11:43,137
...there was only one
objective in my life.

1749
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:46,505
And that's done now.
- No! What the hell do you mean?

1750
02:11:51,336 --> 02:11:53,612
I have died long
time back, Abhijeet.

1751
02:11:55,607 --> 02:11:59,680
I've been haunting my
own house for years now.

1752
02:12:03,215 --> 02:12:06,128
I was just waiting
to settle the scores.

1753
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:09,555
It's even now.

1754
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:13,962
You need to see a doctor!

1755
02:12:14,626 --> 02:12:17,630
I am there! We're
all there, with you!

1756
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:18,969
What are you saying!

1757
02:12:19,064 --> 02:12:22,045
She's a great girl!
Don't fight with her.

1758
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:25,112
You'll regret if she goes away.
- Will you shut up!

1759
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:26,505
Is this a joke!

1760
02:12:35,714 --> 02:12:37,625
It's true I don't have any regrets.

1761
02:12:38,583 --> 02:12:41,223
But I am a murderer.

1762
02:12:46,591 --> 02:12:48,434
What the hell do you
think you're saying?

1763
02:12:49,995 --> 02:12:52,498
Hush! Listen to the wheels of time-

1764
02:12:52,597 --> 02:12:55,168
Someone else killed for you!

1765
02:12:55,267 --> 02:12:58,146
His chariot rushes invisible
- You're mentally ill.

1766
02:13:00,072 --> 02:13:03,952
Crushing under wheel
the despairing blackness

1767
02:13:04,042 --> 02:13:07,580
from whose fractured heart
spring stars like teardrops

1768
02:13:11,984 --> 02:13:13,088
O my friend

1769
02:13:14,252 --> 02:13:17,961
that onrush of time ensnared..

1770
02:13:18,056 --> 02:13:22,300
...& lifted me onto his chariot

1771
02:13:23,996 --> 02:13:29,309
on a path of reckless adventure

1772
02:13:32,337 --> 02:13:34,977
far away, far from you

1773
02:13:35,073 --> 02:13:40,614
far-whirling beyond countless deaths

1774
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:42,214
You're not doing this Prabir-da!

1775
02:13:42,647 --> 02:13:45,457
Far- to this sunrise-kissed
mountain peek

1776
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:46,961
You are not doing this! - and
behind us flapping in the wind".

1777
02:13:47,052 --> 02:13:49,191
...trailing in the
vortex of the chariot

1778
02:13:50,589 --> 02:13:52,364
traces of my name, myself

1779
02:14:00,532 --> 02:14:02,512
Today across the path of no return

1780
02:14:03,602 --> 02:14:08,711
if you catch a glimpse
from afar you will know me not

1781
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:16,115
My friend

1782
02:14:19,317 --> 02:14:20,352
Farewell !

1783
02:14:21,987 --> 02:14:23,022
Prabir-da, just listen to me.

1784
02:14:23,121 --> 02:14:25,624
Prabir-da, just listen to me once.
