1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,833


3
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,750
'Chithamur'

4
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,125
'Nagesh Theater'

5
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,917
'Today'

6
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,208
Are all girls like this?

7
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,625
Will you eat breakfast
without brushing your teeth?

8
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,458
'He is our film's hero'

9
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
'His name is Naga'

10
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,583
'His job is what a jobless chap
with great difficulty gets his hands into'

11
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,167
'I mean, broker'

12
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,292
'His friends ridicule him to such an extent
for not clinching a single deal'

13
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,292
'...because integrity is his motto'

14
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,792
You owe me 500 bucks

15
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,250
- So far you've lost 10 times
- Why did she lose to you?

16
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,458
She said I would take
a commission some day

17
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,708
As usual she lost the bet

18
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,875
Hey! Lakshmi
Finish your breakfast

19
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,250
I am totally broke

20
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,458
Will you give your bro 500 bucks?

21
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,875
What an easy way out!

22
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:01,750
Bless you, bro

23
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,833
Has he taken a vow
not to earn at all?

24
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,292
Ma, jobless officer is here

25
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,792
'I will keep in mind
your mind voice'

26
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,708
Drink your coffee

27
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,875
One who lacks intelligence is a fool

28
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,958
You know how intelligent you are

29
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,250
But though he is intelligent
he doesn't know to earn

30
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,917
He is a real foolish fool!

31
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,500
Why are you raising your voice now?

32
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,667
Your younger brother owns a car
You ride a bike

33
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,250
That too, the bike he bought for you

34
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,833
He paid only the initial payment

35
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,375
I'm paying the EMIs

36
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,417
Those who dotted the i's
never prospered!

37
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,958
The silent ones achieved their goals

38
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,458
I'll give you an idea
to come up in life

39
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,875
Will you listen to me?

40
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,583
Ma, is this your brilliant idea?

41
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,083
You'll know tomorrow

42
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,625
Ma, many didn't progress in life
because they got married

43
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,042
Only if you get a wife
you'll lead a good life

44
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:17,583
- Whose pearl of wisdom is this?
- Astrologer!

45
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,292
I'll get married only after I find
a groom for my younger sister

46
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,042
If she pins her hopes on you

47
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,042
...she will end up
only as 'Avvaiyar'!

48
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,000
I know how to find
a suitable boy for Lakshmi

49
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,708
Zip your lips!

50
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,292
I won't look at any girl

51
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,083
I'll just say I don't like her and leave

52
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,375
- You'll be dead meat then
- What is our groom saying?

53
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,958
You're busy with your 'mixture'

54
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,958
If you call the bride
we can meet her

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,125
I get this rare chance to eat
only on such occasions

56
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,083
Let me call her

57
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,125
Aramana Gayathri Suba Sree Himaja

58
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,750
She has a long name
You can shorten it

59
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,042
'This is our heroine'

60
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,708
'Not just her name
Her wish list also rolls to a mile!'

61
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,750
'Recently a few girls insisted on
the groom landing in a helicopter'

62
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,792
'And give the bride
500 sovereigns as dowry!'

63
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,792
'She belongs to that list'

64
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,667
'She wants to marry
a software engineer'

65
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,167
'And not just USA, she wants
to settle down in Jupiter!'

66
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,458
Take a look

67
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey! Look at her

68
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,500
'Another slave for life bites the dust'

69
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,458
'My daughter seems to
sail in the same slave boat!'

70
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,917
'He refused to look
and now he's all eyes!'

71
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,125
'Don't embarrass me, sit down'

72
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,417
Do you work in Infosys or TCS?

73
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,125
I'm Nagesh

74
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,708
My friends call me Naga

75
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,000
Aren't you a software engineer?

76
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,417
Sir, is it 2 BHK or 3 BHK?

77
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,625
I have a soooper party, sir

78
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,000
We can close the deal tomorrow

79
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,625
Please remove
the 'To Let' board, sir

80
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,000
'What 'To Let' board'?

81
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,042
My mother said my life
will change if you're my wife

82
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:41,958
She was 100% right

83
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,125
The moment I saw you
I concluded a deal

84
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,958
Where do you work?

85
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,542
Where is 8th street
in Lakshmi nagar?

86
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,542
Give him directions to Lakshmi nagar

87
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,500
I don't know

88
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,292
She doesn't know it seems

89
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,833
You're this area's broker's daughter?
And you don't know?

90
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,583
Give him directions
Broker's daughter!

91
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
How long?
I'm starving

92
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:16,667
Just 5 more minutes
and I'll be done

93
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,875
Why did you marry him
knowing he's a real estate agent?

94
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,208
His parents lied to me
saying he is a bank employee

95
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,583
'As if she is a collector!'

96
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,250
My blessed fate
I'm living with him

97
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,500
You put up with him

98
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,083
If I had been in your shoes
I would have strangled him

99
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,583
I'm being teased wherever I go
as 'broker's daughter'

100
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,500
I feel so humiliated

101
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,958
Let this torture end with me

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,667
I've found the perfect boy for you

103
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,500
He is too good to be true

104
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,042
I was told you are
a software engineer

105
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,542
That's why I agreed to meet you

106
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,375
You don't like me
or my job now?

107
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:50,333
I don't like your job

108
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,792
So I don't like you either

109
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,958
Then girls prefer the profession
to the actual person!

110
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:59,167
Not knowing whether
it is day or night...

111
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,625
...working like a madcap
in cool comfort and ruining their health

112
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:06,708
To set that right they will spend
beyond their means, borrowing money

113
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,875
- You want only them?
- Yes

114
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,042
Earning 50,000 per month and
paying EMI to the tune of 55000

115
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,375
...is a software engineer's job

116
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:19,375
A broker lies through his teeth
and exaggerates to the core

117
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,417
Sells his soul for a commission
Isn't that your job?

118
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,958
Hey! Even if God orders me...

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,750
...this gentleman broker Nagesh
won't sell his integrity

120
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,375
Then you wouldn't have
clinched even 1 deal?

121
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:32,542
'Even she knows, huh?'

122
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,208
Not just a house broker

123
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,792
You aren't fit to be even a hustler!

124
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,958
I don't like you

125
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:43,667
Good bye, miss Aruvamanai
Gayathri Suba Sree Himaja

126
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,833
Aruvamanai means 'chopper'

127
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,500
They grabbed the fritter
from your hands, huh?

128
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,000
Listen to me, all ears

129
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,125
Nowadays girls are very shrewd

130
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,750
They show their smart-ass side
even to the smartest groom ever

131
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,208
Sir being jobless-

132
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,000
Ouch! It hurts
Wait, dear

133
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,292
If I take a dig at him...

134
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,958
...don't know from where
your anger erupts, clear off now

135
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,958
You can have your 'anna'
all to yourself, see you

136
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,708
Will I get the perfect match?

137
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,708
In your dreams!

138
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,625
They hang up on me
as soon as I mention your job

139
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,958
Don't know where I'll find
the perfect match for him!

140
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,333
Only if the eldest son
is settled well in life...

141
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,958
...the whole family will prosper

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,750
Please listen to me

143
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,500
Take up some other job

144
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,917
Okay, right?

145
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,750
In my times though you won't find
too many literates around...

146
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,250
...they were all intelligent

147
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:49,208
Now the literate and the illiterate
are a bunch of nincompoops!

148
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,000
If you must work here...

149
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,208
...you need an intellect
beyond normal intelligence

150
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,750
A grandma in Coimbatore
and one in Ooty steam 'idli'

151
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,833
...in the same vessel
at the same time

152
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,917
Which 'idli' will first get cooked?

153
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:13,375
I've asked this to 2883 people

154
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,750
Not one answered it right

155
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,250
- Ooty, sir
- How?

156
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:26,750
More than Coimbatore
Ooty is 7300ft above sea level

157
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,125
Atmospheric pressure there is low

158
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,167
Moisture in the air evaporates faster

159
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,208
Then won't the 'idli'
in Ooty cook earlier?

160
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,250
This was a question
in the 1979 IAS exam

161
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,458
The way you answered
the most complicated question

162
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,292
...I know what a genius you must be
and how much you would've studied

163
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,375
If I scrutinize your certificates
even after this

164
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,125
Tell me, dear

165
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,208
I got a super job
just as you wished

166
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,583
I am so happy for you

167
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,458
- Tell me
- I studied MBA, correspondence

168
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,333
You can ask me
any question you like, sir

169
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,500
Why waste time asking questions?

170
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,125
Being a girl is your most
favourable qualification!

171
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,667
But you're so unlucky

172
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,792
I selected a boy
for this post just now

173
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,917
Sir, did you select him of all people?

174
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,917
Indeed

175
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,583
Can I meet this genius just once?

176
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,583
This is very important

177
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,667
You'll find me a bride
fairer and taller than her

178
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,833
I'll marry her

179
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:39,167
If the groom has a cushy job
sky is the limit to find the right bride

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,333
I'll call you later, ma

181
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,292
Okay

182
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,542
Just like He heaped beauty on girls...

183
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,750
...God must have blessed
 men with intelligence

184
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,292
Didn't I mention the genius
I appointed? That's him

185
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,625
Hello, Mr Broker Nagesh
How are you?

186
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,917
- 'Broker?'
- How could you appoint him?

187
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,708
Did you read his résumé thoroughly?

188
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:09,208
- No, I didn't
- 5 attempts to pass his 10th grade

189
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,125
Passed his 12th grade after failing thrice

190
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,333
He took twice the normal time to secure
a degree, that too scored around 40%

191
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,542
'She blew the whistle on me!'

192
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,250
He passed every time we held an election

193
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:20,417
So you want him?
Or a gold medallist like me?

194
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,292
I am Aramana Gayathri Suba Sree Himaja

195
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,792
Good lord!
You aced it

196
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,750
God seems to have blessed you
with both beauty and brains

197
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,958
You'll be a real asset
to this company, my dear

198
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,542
'You are the right choice'

199
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,833
You can keep this, my dear lad

200
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,333
If you don't get me wron-

201
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,500
Sir, the lamb always trusts
the one who slaughters him

202
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,833
'Go ahead and employ
this English madam'

203
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,083
I'll take leave, sir

204
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,500
'One day I'll get even with you!'

205
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:10,333
Not just 'that' job
You aren't fit for any job!

206
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,083
Only the jobless will come to a park

207
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,708
What's so special about
parking ourselves in this park?

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,500
I don't know
We'll know soon

209
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,833
But whatever you say

210
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,333
...I won't spare that gold medallist
who snatched that job from you

211
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,542
Thanks, friend
We'll get even with her

212
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,958
Sir, take a look at this book
It has all the details about this world

213
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,375
Please buy at least 1 book, madam

214
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,792
Is this some prize job?
And she snatched it from you, eh?

215
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,875
Do I look like I read books?

216
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,042
Useful book, sir

217
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,292
Use or news
Clear out!

218
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:54,250
How will I make out with my wife!

219
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,500
Did you get hurt
in a delicate spot?

220
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,708
- Will you buy this book, bro?
- No need, clear out!

221
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,542
- Yes, Himaja
- I couldn't sell a single book

222
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,958
I don't want this job

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,792
If we provide 3 square meals a day
and proper accommodation...

224
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:13,667
...500000 unemployed graduates
are waiting in a queue

225
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,875
Try to adjust

226
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,375
It's okay
I'll manage

227
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,667
So many unemployed graduates, huh?

228
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,375
Buy just 1 book, sir

229
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,167
- I'm not interested
- 'Blockhead!'

230
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,542
Don't disturb me
Go away!

231
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,958
Don't be a pain
Clear out!

232
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,833
Will you buy a book, sir?

233
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,042
Got a book on the popular
sex education show on TV?

234
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,500
Will you bring an aphrodisiac next time?

235
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,917
- '7 hours'
- No, sir

236
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,875
'And what do you mean
you haven't sold a single book?'

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,583
'If you don't sell those 100 books
by this evening...'

238
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,667
'...don't step into our office'

239
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,125
'Popsicle is melting at
'kulfi' ice cream's dilemma!

240
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,292
'Disconnect now'

241
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,667
That's my father-in-law's cash

242
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,833
Give me 5 books

243
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,042
I need coaching for IAS exam

244
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,417
I'm considered a lucky mascot
All your books will sell like hot cakes!

245
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,708
Himaja, where are your books?

246
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,792
I sold the entire lot

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,542
- Sold out?
- Yes

248
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,667
Who bought them?

249
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,792
Look at this, we are
stuck with the whole lot

250
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,500
'Wonder who was today's 1st buyer
He is our lucky mascot!'

251
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:32,250
'I am considered a lucky mascot
The books will sell like hot cakes'

252
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,708
I'll be back

Sweeping discount, sir

258

You won't get it for less
anywhere else, sir

259
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,583
If you sell a book
worth Rs 300 for Rs 3000

260
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,708
...knowing passers-by will make
a beeline to her, your plan is too good

261
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,417
You are a genius, I swear!

262
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,833
Upright IAS officer
Sagayam read this book

The book in Dr Abdul Kalam's library

264
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,917
Even if it's the last pie you must
buy it from the Govt outlet, sir

265
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,708
Give me one of your books

266
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,500
Read this, you'll secure a Govt job

267
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,333
- 'Govt job at this age!'
- How much is it?

268
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,958
Special rate by our firm, Rs 3000

269
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,042
Don't buy

270
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,333
A girl in there is selling
the same book for Rs 300

271
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,667
They bought it from her
and making a killing

272
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,417
- 'He hit the bull's eye!'
- Go in and buy

273
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,958
Look how they con innocent people

274
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,042
If you had enhanced your job like this,
you would be a bigshot by now

275
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,750
Your brain works extra bright
only to hook the girl you flip for

276
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,875
Go light on this
Come...buy this book, sir

277
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,417
Enough of studying for IAS exam!

278
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,667

"Just looking at you will do"

283
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:26,333

"Fresh time drizzle
showers to dazzle"

right up to the roots?"

00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,875
"Even before I could see
you became 'me' easily"

290
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,542
"This is a mere dream of delight"

291
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,417
"In a reverie, I yearn for it outright"

292
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:05,167
"I fall asleep only when I know
it is not a dream but all so true"

293
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,292

without you, my love?"

00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,750
"If you merge with me
I'll live on earth blissfully"

295
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,167
"Shall I wilt thinking of that day?"

296
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,000
"Or look for a place in your lap to stay?"

297
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,625
"When our eyes meet irresistibly"

298
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:23,625

"This need nourishes my mind anew"

301
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:35,000
Yov! Go and dry
the rinsed clothes

302
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:37,583
- Don't be so rude to dad, ma
- Why are you on his side?

303
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,208
Refer to him as 'mediator' decently

304
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,500
He has become as thin as a rake
serving the whole town

305
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,583
You go dry the clothes

306
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,125
- Is there some hidden agenda in this?
- Not at all

307
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,500
"The enticing evening glow"

"To light the lamps auspicious"

313
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:39,458
"I will share your home as your princess"

314
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,625
"Tell me now
Shall I, my love?"

315
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,750
Don't cry, you'll also find
a dumbass husband who can cook

316
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,792
Add onion, onion 'dosa'

317
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,125
Mix egg, it's egg 'dosa'
Roast it with ghee, ghee 'dosa'

318
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,375
- Don't add anything it's pan 'dosa'
- Very confusing

319
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,375
From your 1st cup of coffee
to massaging your feet at night

320
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,958

"Looking for you whole way through"

324

"My eyes are disappointed by the view"

325
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:36,708
"The moment I saw your smiling face
I changed my wayward ways"

326
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:41,417

on your loving lap always"

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,708
"O' beautiful girl, my forever-find"

330
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,042
"This cloud caresses me gently"

331
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,542
"I didn't want to see
this cloud right next to me"

332
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,792
"Monsoon showers only within me silently"

333
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:06,125
"Drenching me pitter-patter
my fever shot up faster"

334
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,458
"When our eyes meet secretly"

335
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,417
"I somehow lose my sanity"

336
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,125
"Just looking at you is all I want to do"

337
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:25,375
"This urge ushered in my heart anew"

338
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,375
She loves you, right?

339
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,458
Tell him

340
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,292
- Why has she brought him here?
- No clue

341
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,583
Doesn't look too good

342
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,833
What is love, sir?

343
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,292
Love is a physical outlet
Whole world knows that

344
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,292
- What, sir?
- He'll explain

345
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:43,083
Love isn't like a link
between landlord and tenant

346
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:46,167
More like the ties between
tenant and landlord

347
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,375
Inseparable bond

348
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,458
What do we call people
who don't accept love?

349
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,375
There isn't any special term for them

350
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,000
Brother, don't join him
and bore us to death

351
00:23:58,042 --> 00:23:59,083
Come to the point

352
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,500
He is in love with a girl

353
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,875
But her family hasn't accepted

354
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,583
She is refusing to opt
for a registered marriage

355
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,375
It would be great
if you can convince her

356
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,583
Now she is turning you
into a different kind of broker!

357
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:14,500
Serving love is
as good as serving God

358
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:19,000
Who is that crackpot who refused
to support this 'Arvind Swamy'?

359
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,917
Her family is very strict

360
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,458
That isn't a big deal
Give me the details

361
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,208
She has 2 brothers
She's very scared

362
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,917
Identify them to me
We can kidnap them

363
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,792
Sing my praises to her, dude

364
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,458
He was the one
who got me married

365
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,167
But I'm still celibate!

366
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,500
That's off topic

367
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,125
Point the girl out to me

368
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,500
We'll kidnap her tomorrow
and get you married at once

369
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,542
You praised him sky high
saying he's like 'Arvind Swamy'

370
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,958
He nailed your coffin tight!

371
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,750
Our story takes a terrific twist, eh?

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,375
What happened?

373
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,958
I swear I had no idea
she is your sister

374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,333
But we love each other truly

375
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,583
I swear on God
even I didn't know

376
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,875
My sister is very gullible

377
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,958
He must have sweet talked
and brainwashed her

378
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,958
Sit down

379
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:30,333
You said serving love is
equal to serving God?!

380
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,708
Does it pain to help unite
your sister and her lover?

381
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,125
It hurts, dude

382
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:39,125
Only a brother will know the pain
of his sister falling in love

383
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
You're a single child
You're clueless

384
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,292
If only he had fallen in love
I would have broken his teeth

385
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,125
But your sister has reciprocated

386
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,792
You know my sister can't speak

387
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:53,417
If she gets married to him
all his relatives will deride her

388
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,417
My mother won't be
able to bear that disgrace

389
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,042
If he truly loves her...

390
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,125
...ask him to come home with his parents 
and ask for her hand formally

391
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,667
Or else ask him to forget my sister

392
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,292
Come along

393
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,292
My sister is a beauty!

394
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,958
Naga, if Lakshmi is ready
ask her to meet our guests

395
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Come soon

396
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,042
Why are you standing aloof?

397
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,917
Erase all superstitions about widows
not participating in an auspicious event

398
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,750
He's right
Come, ma

399
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,583
It isn't enough if parents
save money for their children

400
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,917
They should support
in the choice of spouse too

401
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,792
My son hit the nail on the head
and convinced me

402
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,458
I endorse this alliance completely

403
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,750
We haven't come to sell
our son to your family

404
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,917
I won't demand any dowry from you

405
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,500
We have too many friends
and extended family

406
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,000
You won't be able to handle it

407
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,583
So we'll handle the entire
wedding expenses

408
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,917
We've been living as
a joint family for generations

409
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,625
Your daughter should live
under the same roof with us

410
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,792
And I don't know...how to say this?

411
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:16,458
Words spilled from your mouth till now
like a water fall, say it in the same flow

412
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:19,917
Both my daughters-in-law walked in
with 150 sovereigns of gold

413
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,583
If your daughter can also fall in line-

414
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,000
'Keep quiet!'

415
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,708
If the 3rd daughter-in-law also
falls in line with the other 2

416
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,250
...they won't have any conflict

417
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,083
The families won't split either

418
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,500
True, my son means the world to me

419
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,917
But family is important
much more than that

420
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,875
If you are willing to give jewelry
worth 150 sovereigns...

421
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,208
...we can conclude
this alliance as final formally

422
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:53,625
It is every parent's duty to ensure
a good life for his or her children

423
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,167
If 150 sovereigns of gold will fetch
my daughter a happy life...

424
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,750
...I am most happy to do so

425
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:08,333
Hey Shakthi!

426
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,792
- How can we, ma?
- I'll manage

427
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:24,000
How could you even accept?
Whom were you depending on?

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,542
You thought he'll pitch in?

429
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,375
He is a worthless additional baggage

430
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:30,125
I'm running this household singlehandedly

431
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,875
150 sovereigns of gold
is about 4 to 5 million

432
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,250
If I take a loan...

433
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:37,042
...I'll die paying up
the EMIs for a lifetime

434
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,625
I can't afford to do this

435
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,375
Find her some other groom

436
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,708
We can't do that

437
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,333
Why not, ma?

438
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,500
Lakshmi and that groom
love each other

439
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,792
They fell in love, eh?

440
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,458
You're trying to pass it off
as if you arranged it traditionally

441
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,583
You acted so innocent and
had the gall to fall-

442
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,333
Hands off
Shut up!

443
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,583
How dare you hit our sister!

444
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,958
You are the main culprit

445
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,833
I knew when you brought him home
there must be some obstacle like this

446
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,583
Whether you get her married to
the groom of her choice or not...

447
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:11,917
...because I'm duty bound as her brother
I'll contribute 30-40 sovereigns only

448
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,083
I can't spend a naya paisa more than this

449
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,000
Then it's your goddamn wish!

450
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:02,042
'Your father suddenly suffered
a heart attack when you were a kid'

451
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:06,917
Why are you being so morbid?

452
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,417
You'll be fine, dear

453
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,625
Only I know about 
my health condition, dear

454
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:16,917
Still...this house is all we possess

455
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
How can our daughter inherit it?

456
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:23,917
Our daughter is special
She has a speech disability

457
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,958
You'll find it very difficult
when you have to get her married

458
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,958
That's why I've willed it in her name

459
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,667
What about our sons?

460
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,833
If they expect to live
on their father's assets...

461
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,208
...they are not fit to be men

462
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:44,958
But they shouldn't suffer
because of our daughter

463
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,333
Till Lakshmi gets married
keep this as a secret

464
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:59,458
'Will you have a baby with Ashok or not?'

465
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:00,958
'No, akka'

466
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,708
'But 2 years ago
you were dating him'

467
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,583
'I should make out a new episode
in between her favorite episodes'

468
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,167
1 track mind 24x7

469
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,333
I'll slice you into 2

470
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,958
Not letting me watch a serial in peace

471
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,125
One day I'll show you
how virile I can be!

472
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,958
'Looks like only you'll be
with me my whole life through'

473
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,750
'Same feeling'

474
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,500
Hey, Sumathi

475
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,083
When we were dating
you didn't let me touch you

476
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,458
18 months since we got married
and not even once have we made out

477
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,292
Even I'm feeling sorry for myself

478
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,167
Aren't you feeling sorry for me?

479
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,833
1st get up

480
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:23,500
'Even if he falls at your feet...'

481
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,500
'...make him sleep only in the hall'

482
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,208
Don't fall all over me
1 minute, I'll be back

483
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,042
'Who is it?'

484
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,375
This useless fellow, huh?

485
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,208
She left me high and dry
kneading my hands

486
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:43,958
Go away

487
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,333
- Why...?
- Your loser friend is here!

488
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,500
- What does he want?
- His sister's wedding, right?

489
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,583
He must have come
to ask you for a favor, go

490
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:51,917
Talk to him and send him off

491
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:52,958
Wait, dude

492
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,542
I'll be right back
Be patient

493
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,708
Only your friend's sister
is getting married

494
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,250
Not your sister's wedding

495
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:02,250
If you ask me to bring coffee and snacks
I'll rip your intestines out

496
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:03,333
- Go
- I won't ask

497
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,000
- Then we can continue where we left
- Get lost!

498
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,250
Kaala, my dear friend-

499
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,500
You come out first

500
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,292
Why...?

501
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,458
You are too young to understand
even if I explain

502
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,875
Tell me why you're here

503
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:21,000
My sister's problem got solved

504
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,458
I'm so glad to hear it

505
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,750
Why didn't you just call me?

506
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,917
We must go to my hometown
I came to fetch you

507
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,417
- Come
- Why suddenly?

508
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,750
You could've told me earlier

509
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,875
If I call, you'll tag along
like the Vodafone pup

510
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:34,708
No dog will come out
at night in January

511
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,125
I'll come in the morning, go now

512
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,542
- Better get ready
- I have odd jobs to do

513
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,417
You don't have to do any job
odd or otherwise, come along

514
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,042
I'm not coming

515
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,875
How often you've said
I don't know how to survive

516
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:49,500
Now you don't become like me!
Total value of this property is 10 million

517
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,917
Your commission alone is 0.2 million

518
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,083
In just 10 days!

519
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,083
2 lakhs in 10 days!

520
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,458
Are you coming or not?

521
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,625
Think about it

522
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,500
Even if you give me 2 million,
I can't leave my wife

523
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,542
Kala...?

524
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,750
Drink coffee, bro

525
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,583
Why are you standing outside and chatting?

526
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,333
Please come inside, bro

527
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,500
It's okay

528
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,917
I've fixed my sister's wedding
I came to take him along

529
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,542
Sure, please take him along

530
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,583
Okay

531
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:16,750
Why are you staring?

532
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,458
Consider your friend's sister as your own

533
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Go and help my 'brother'

534
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,250
From your wife's mouth to God's ears

535
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,667
Go and get ready

536
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,708
Okay, machan
Give me 5 minu-

537
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,667
Wait outside for 10 minutes

538
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:31,292
You come inside, let me change
and pack my bag-

539
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,708
Are you seeing a bride or what?

540
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,042
You can go like this

541
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,708
'I am not even wearing my brief'

542
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,375
Okay, we'll take leave

543
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:40,917
Come on

544
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,083
- Brother...?
- What...?

545
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,333
He isn't too good with money

546
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,542
Please give that 0.2 million
commission money to me, bro

547
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,000
'Blessed wife of mine!'

548
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,417
Is this pay off more important
than your husband?

549
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,583
Thank God!

550
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,917
'Chithamur'

551
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,667
Hey! The gate is locked

552
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,458
Let's call out to him

553
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,750
I can see the lights are on
but nobody is around!

554
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,125
Call his number

555
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,667
Phone is completely wet
Can't turn it on now

556
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,958
Give, let me try

557
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:50,375
Forget it, let's go to the theater
and meet him in the morning

558
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,792
Okay, come

559
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,208
1st find a place for us to sleep

560
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,750
So much space here

561
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,917
Let's sleep in this corner

562
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,292
I'll check inside
if there's place to sleep

563
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,958
It has been shut for a long time
Watch out for snakes and lizards

564
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,250
Let us sleep here
to one side

565
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:01,625
Wait, I'll go check

566
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,167
You're such a stubborn mule!

567
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,125
Listen to me

568
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,792
This theater was closed long ago

569
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,000
There may be some
creepy crawlies, sleep here

570
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,667
Scaredy cat!

571
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,958
I don't get scared that easily

572
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,125
- I'm only scared of you
- Why...?

573
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:36,042
I know the outcome if a bachelor 
sleeps next to a married man!

574
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,583
So you sleep alone there

575
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:22,250
[excerpts from 'Exorcist']

576
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:28,000
[indistinct overlap of voices]

577
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,000
Hey, Naga

578
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,417
'I've sent you the location
by WhatsApp, check it'

579
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,542
You dumbass!

580
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,417
Very close to Chennai

581
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,958
Hey! I'm feeling very sleepy

582
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,625
Your eyes are like
Miss World Aishwarya Rai

583
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,042
Deepika Padukone's lips

584
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:48,583
All this combined
is my precious princess

585
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,833
I know you're lying

586
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,625
But...

587
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,792
...I feel like hearing it
over and over again

588
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,250
Repeat it once more

589
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,042
- Again...?
- He was here just now

590
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,333
Your eyes are like
Miss World Aishwarya Rai

591
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,167
Deepika Padukone's hips

592
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:06,708
Like Katrina Kaif-

593
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,208
You made me sleep with a ghost

594
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,167
And you're busy flirting
with your girlfriend?

595
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:11,417
What...?

596
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,625
It's very cold
I can't sleep alone

597
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,625
What's going on?

598
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,917
Sorry, Miss World
I'll call you in 5 minutes

599
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,625
I'll just put my arm over you

600
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
Otherwise my leg

601
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:36,500
My family deity Sunny Leone,
only you should save me

602
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,667
If my parents get me married
to some other boy...

603
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:03,958
...what will you do?

604
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,167
"Wherever you are, I wish you
from the bottom of my heart true"

605
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:10,583
"Beloved, lead a happy life
without any strife"

606
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,125
I'll sing and bless you

607
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,042
After I'm married...

608
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:18,208
...if I find out on my wedding night
my husband is a software psycho

609
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:22,208
If he stubs me with his cigarette
and I have burns and scars all over...

610
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,833
...if I come back to you

611
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,875
At that time if I'm not married...

612
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:29,500
...I'll consider you

613
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,792
So you have an idea to dump me
and get married to another female

614
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,833
You can ditch me and
marry some other chap

615
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,750
Why can't the same hold good for me?

616
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,167
'I happen to love you'

617
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,792
'Instead of seeing me as your wife...'

618
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,958
...you'll think of some other
female as your wife?

619
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,833
Typical male attitude!

620
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,583
You asked me a question
and you answered it, huh?

621
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,250
I got it, some girl is
your ticket for thoroughfare!

622
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,833
And I'm just a pastime for you!

623
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:54,083
Hey, you got me wrong

624
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:55,917
'Listen to me, will you?'

625
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:57,208
No, dear

626
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,417
Pooja, listen, don't get tense

627
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,208
Are you with some other female now?

628
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:11,083
Hey, you misunderstood me
I didn't mean it in that sense

629
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,375
Hang up now

630
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,500
Pick up, damn you!

631
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,875
She answered her own question
and then switched off the phone

632
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,125
Sunny Leone won't hit me, only hit on me!

633
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,875
Is it Sunny Leone or Sumathi?

634
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,917
Why would my lips sting
if I was kissing her?

635
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:52,250
[loud bang on door]

636
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:03,000
[banging continues]

637
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:12,500
[loud thumping]

638
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,042
Don't open

639
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,667
Let's escape by the other door

640
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,333
When I first saw the theater,
I was spooked

641
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,125
[banging continues]

642
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,833
Don't, listen to me

643
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,208
Don't open

644
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,167
Move aside

645
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,917
'Why did she come here?'

646
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,208
- Where is she?
- Who...?

647
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,958
You packed her off
before I landed?

648
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,125
What are you blabbering?

649
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,917
One girl to love and
another to gratify your urges!

650
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,375
Oh gawd!

651
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,625
Have you lost your senses?

652
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,167
You just let your imagination run

653
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,292
I've been with him

654
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,458
With him?

655
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:07,333
Yuck! How disgusting is that!

656
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,250
Hey, I'll slap you

657
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,000
Himu, wait

658
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,875
Nothing happened
the way you imagine

659
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:18,417
There's no other girl
in my life other than you

660
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:19,792
I swear on you

661
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,583
- Nothing happened, right?
- No, not at all

662
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,208
Because this loser hasn't
consummated his marriage as yet

663
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:28,833
...was dreaming of Sunny Leone
and making weird sounds!

664
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:31,375
How could you
suspect my love for you?

665
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,208
I'm her fan

666
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:39,875
I misunderstood you

667
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,667
I came here
on a spur of the moment

668
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:42,708
I'll leave now

669
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,208
How will you go alone at this hour?

670
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:49,125
Stay here tonight

671
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,583
You can go
tomorrow morning

672
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,042
What do you think?

673
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,375
Let her leave in the morning

674
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,875
You'll have a ball
even within a small phone

675
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,000
In this big theater
I know what you'll be up to!

676
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,417
Move away from her

677
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:04,083
You must listen to me
Come along

678
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,083
You thought I was asleep?

679
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,833
Even I pretended to
be asleep like you!

680
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:23,208
You'll tempt him even if he
keeps his hands to himself

681
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,625
I'll kill you if you fool around

682
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,458
Nobody should experience
what I didn't

683
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,958
'Soft cotton over there'

684
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,125
'Ball of fire here'

685
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:32,792
'Kala, you're nailing me in the coffin
not knowing my adrenalin is rushing!'

686
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,250
Last night I slept like a log

687
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,500
A mosquito bit me
while I was asleep

688
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,833
When I hit it, blood smeared
all over my face

689
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,458
Not on the mosquito

690
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,708
When I sat up and looked around...

691
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,000
...there was a huge spirit
right next to me

692
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,167
I stared daggers and
it ran away terrified

693
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,458
I'm brave even though I'm not
from Madurai, I've visited it

694
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,958
Why this holy crap?

695
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,917
- Leave now
- I kept strict watch last night

696
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,292
As if you can have a ball now

697
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,417
Leave us alone

698
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:05,333
Even if I trip on my foot
my moustache will be intact!

699
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,167
'Nagesh Theater'

700
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,750
'Naga's girl, my sister'

701
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,000
Please give the phone to him

702
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:25,167
- Where are you?
- At home

703
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:26,583
Hom-

704
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,292
How did you travel alone at night?

705
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,667
Why should I be scared?

706
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32,292
Won't you get scared at all?

707
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,417
1 minute

708
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,042
Go fast and give
the phone to him

709
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,375
I'll give it to him

710
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,167
We had a small fight

711
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,208
After that I didn't talk to him

712
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,625
Did you see how possessive my girl is?

713
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,000
No one on the line

714
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:13,750
Are you day dreaming or what?

715
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,958
Your father was mad about Nagesh

716
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,958
That's why he named you and
his theater after the legendary comedian

717
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,208
Very unfortunate
he died so young

718
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:30,458
But your mother was so strong
and educated all of you so well

719
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,667
- When did you come?
- Last night

720
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,750
Why didn't you come here?
Where did you stay?

721
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,542
You weren't here,
so we slept in the theater

722
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,375
- What is it, uncle?
- You spent the night in the theater?

723
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:45,708
- Yes
- Nothing happened?

724
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,083
Er...no, why do you ask?

725
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,042
The theater is haunted

726
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,375
Haunted?

727
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,750
Everyone here is aware it's haunted

728
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,292
I tried to screen some films
but I failed in my attempt

729
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,833
I knew this news
would scare your mother

730
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:05,417
This must be a ploy by
someone here to reduce the rate

731
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,125
It isn't what you think, son

732
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,250
Just as it is true you are alive now

733
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:11,417
...same holds good
for the spirit in there

734
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,708
No one will come forward
to buy a haunted place

735
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,792
Let's go back

736
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,167
Somehow you escaped last night

737
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,792
But you can't always be this lucky

738
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,583
Feel free to stay here

739
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,708
If we fear what doesn't exist...

740
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,417
...we have to lose
whatever we own, uncle

741
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,000
I don't wish to lose anything

742
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:31,000
My sister's wedding hinges
on the sale of this theater

743
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:34,625
Only if I stay there I can
convince people it isn't haunted

744
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,750
I can find a buyer
who will offer a decent price

745
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,083
- Listen
- It's alright, uncle

746
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,292
Don't be scared
I can take care

747
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,583
Let's go

748
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,958
He's right you know

749
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,875
So be it, don't you
want the commission?

750
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,042
Not me, take him!

751
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,083
It's just my phone

752
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,375
I thought it was a banshee!

753
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,042
- Hello, ma
- Where are you staying?

754
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,125
In the theater

755
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,458
- Why?
- Why inconvenience them?

756
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,833
What about the electricity and tax issues?

757
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10,083
Soundarapandi uncle has paid
to the last paisa, ma

758
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,625
- Come back soon
- 'Okay, ma'

759
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:40,167
[humming]

760
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,375
Who are you?

761
00:51:28,417 --> 00:51:29,458
Don't you recognize me?

762
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:30,375
No, I don't

763
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,292
Now do you know?

764
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:33,333
Not one bit

765
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,792
Google Ganga

766
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:40,958
Ladies' broker, huh?

767
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,958
Hello, I'm a land broker

768
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,792
How will we know
if you're so ambiguous?

769
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:45,958
We are also brokers

770
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,750
Do we wake up everyone
and tell them?

771
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:48,875
Customer is waiting

772
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,542
Soundarapandi sir sent them

773
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,833
Come soon
Hurry up

774
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,708
- Can we trust her?
- No harm trying

775
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,208
Hello, sir

776
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,333
Electricity and water tax bills are clear

777
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,208
We have a clear
Encumbrance certificate

778
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,042
Let's inspect the back yard

779
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,458
8 grounds, sir

780
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,167
- Is there water in the well?
- No water problem, natural spring

781
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,250
No damage to the roof
The building is strong

782
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,583
Needs just a coat of whitewash

783
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,875
My sister's wedding
Why will we sell a good theater?

784
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,708
Good but seats need to be changed

785
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,542
Screen is in good condition

786
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:18,792
Lucky theater, sir

787
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:21,167
If this deal is clinched
I can get the commission

788
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,958
MGR inaugurated this theater, sir

789
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,167
I am all in favour of
closing this deal tomorrow

790
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,042
So we can sign
the agreement right away?

791
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,125
I have to ask my guru

792
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,792
- Who is your guru?
- Come with me

793
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:33,542
Swami?

794
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,000
Don't buy, this place isn't auspicious

795
00:52:52,042 --> 00:52:54,417
Leave this place immediately
without even turning back

796
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,042
Let's go

797
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,208
Sir, if you like we can offer
a goat as redemption

798
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:03,792
The affluent people depend
solely on a soothsayer or seer

799
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,792
[maniacal laughter]

800
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,667
[indistinct chatter]

801
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,083
My head is splitting

802
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:26,375
That goddamn God-man
let me down real hard

803
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:27,958
Give me 2 pots of toddy

804
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:30,500
Drink this and cool down

805
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,917
This heat won't go
without getting laid

806
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,667
- You won't understand it
- Here you go

807
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,917
Drink our national relief-drink!

808
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,625
You'll cool down head to toe

809
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,250
Go away

810
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,292
I think he's mad

811
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:04,208
Give me 1 more

812
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:08,708
What's wrong?
Stop staring at him

813
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,708
Look at me
Hold this

814
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:23,083
1 minute

815
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:34,958
Hey! Wait

816
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:42,792
Who is he?

817
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:51,083
I've heard of strong tea

818
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:53,083
These 2 are drinking tea with a straw?

819
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,708
What can I serve you, sir?

820
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,167
What is hot and ready to serve?

821
00:54:57,208 --> 00:54:59,333
- Only tea
- That's all?

822
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,042
- What else do you want?
- Only water

823
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:03,333
But you're stopping its flow 
with your goddamn dam!

824
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:08,542
Who are they?
Why did we scare them away?

825
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:10,292
You're staying in Nagesh Theater

826
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,792
That's why they are terrified of you

827
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:14,792
- What can I get for you, sir?
- 1 glass tea

828
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:18,375
The men here are so weird

829
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:25,958
'Who is the murderer?
Youngster found dead in a bathroom'

830
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:41,333
'Heroine Keerthy Suresh
Wedding bells soon to be heard'

831
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,042
My heart exploded
when Nazriya got married

832
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:48,208
If Keerthy gets married I wonder
which part of me will burst now?

833
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:51,333
A law should be passed prohibiting 
heroines from getting married

834
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:06,125
Hey! Stop

835
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,125
He's another pain in the wrong place

836
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:10,125
Don't run

837
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:12,167
Wait...don't run

838
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,167
Wait, I say

839
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,250
Who are you?
Intend telling me or not?

840
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:48,792
Who the hell are you?

841
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:50,458
Why are you laughing madly at me?

842
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,000
If you don't tell me
I'll strangle you now

843
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,792
Don't interfere, he has been
bugging me from this morning

844
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,583
He must have started this rumor
of our theater being haunted

845
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,750
He is connected to the events here
but he is refusing to open up

846
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,708
He won't respond to blows favorably

847
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:19,042
Last year our Govt closed 60 shops
on the East Coast Road

848
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:21,583
All that remained was only this shop

849
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:26,083
Only spot where
youngsters could booze

850
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:29,708
Money overflowed in
the cash box in this shop

851
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:34,375
The owner of this bar planned
to buy the surrounding land

852
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:39,833
This year only you should buy
all the property around this area, brother

853
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,958
Only you should be
the landlord of this village

854
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,667
It's my wish too, bro

855
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,375
Anna

856
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,333
Please take a seat, sir

857
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,875
Sit down

858
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,125
All you have to do is
sign this tomorrow

859
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,875
This place is yours

860
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:20,042
"Howdy, my dear 'sangi-mangi' lady"

861
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:23,875
"I copied the white beard of Kabali
Every Tamil film's top cat rowdy"

862
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,625
"Howdy, my lady I fancy
Every man's fantasy"

863
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:33,125
"I sported the white beard stylishly
Copying the style of big gun Kabali"

864
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:36,083
"Girls kindle desires in every young male"

865
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,167
"Blessed Anjala, you wicked female!"

866
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:41,083
"Close your window, belle
Don't lure me as well"

867
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:43,083
"Even the villagers are under your spell"

868
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,917
"Without our female clan
what can you do, blessed man?"

869
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,500
"You are half-woman"

870
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:50,833
"In search of liquor you go everywhere
ruining your family's welfare"

871
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:53,000
"No one is sincere
Up to no good here"

872
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,667
"Cutting, cutting, cutting, da"

873
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,250
"If you guzzle it down raw
you'll have a date with Lord Yama!"

874
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:05,875
"Howdy, my dear lady
With eyes that lure me"

875
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,042
"Welcome, my floozy
who makes me go crazy"

876
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:12,667
"I copied the white beard of Kabali
Every Tamil film's top notch rowdy"

877
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:35,708
"Earth will have no miseries
if there ain't any missies"

878
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,750
"No need of God either
to run to in rough weather"

879
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:42,083
"To sharpen the horns of men
women are needed, amen"

880
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:45,333
"She's Goddess on earth, get lost, man!"

881
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:48,208
"Even if you marry a spirit
you can be happy, dammit"

882
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:51,958
"A maiden if you marry
rest of your life, you’ll be a zombie"

883
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,792
"A sacred thread is a noose
around a girl’s neck hanging loose"

884
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:58,250
"Fully aware she sticks out her neck
She's a deity indeed, what the heck!"

885
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:01,500
"Don't take vows for my sake
No offerings to redeem my mistake"

886
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:06,542
"Just leave me in peace
Walk out of my life please"

887
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:33,917
"Chinaman, Chinaman dude
 May I know, where are you off to?"

888
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,667
"Cul de sac siren, full of grace
I got lured by your serene face"

889
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:40,917
"I was fooled, I was such an ass
Get lost, you no-good lass"

890
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,250
"You have no spunk, you stinky fellow"

891
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,500
"My life will be zero
if I marry you, just go"

892
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:50,458
"To the Govt toddy shop exclusive
you're the sales representative"

893
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,917
"Our mistake totally
to have hit on you, girlie"

894
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:56,917
"You are just a junk piece
fit for the trash can please"

895
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,625
"I am a rare prize pricey
You can't hold a candle to me"

896
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,667
"Let's not go in for a brawl
Nor throw innuendoes at all"

897
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:07,875
"Let's close the shutter tight
and go away, good night"

898
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,708
"Howdy, my lady I fancy
Every man’s fantasy"

899
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:15,125
"I sported this white beard stylishly
Copying the style of big gun Kabali"

900
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,875
"Women kindle desires in every young male"

901
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:20,083
"Blessed Anjala, you wicked female!"

902
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:22,833
"Close your window, belle
Don't bewitch me as well"

903
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,125
"Even the villagers are under your spell"

904
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:27,667
Without our female clan
what can you do, wretched man?"

905
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,708
"You are half-woman"

906
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:32,667
In search of liquor you go
digging your family's grave, you hobo"

907
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,875
"No one is sincere
Up to no good here"

908
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:37,625
"Cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, da"

909
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:41,042
"If you guzzle it down raw
you'll have a date with Lord Yama!"

910
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:45,500
"Howdy, my dear 'sangi-mangi' lady"

911
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:53,417
I copied the white beard of Kabali
Every Tamil film's top cat rowdy"

912
01:01:56,625 --> 01:02:00,083
'When he sent his goons to the theater
to take over, you know what transpired?'

913
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,958
This is really superb

914
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,542
I didn't know this is
such a big theater, bro?

915
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,000
No owner for this property

916
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:16,042
You gave that Govt officer just Rs 300000
and procured even a fake document

917
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,667
And usurped this place
You beat a fox hollow!

918
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:21,125
We can screen 'those' films
in our theater tomorrow

919
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,458
And our cash box will overflow

920
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,333
Such films are easily available
online and in smart phones

921
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,000
Who will bother nowadays
to come all the way here?

922
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:50,292
Poor Govind, the bar owner

923
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,250
He got a fake document
The ghost sealed his fate

924
01:02:53,292 --> 01:02:54,875
Don't go anywhere near the theater

925
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,542
It is haunted

926
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,458
I might fall for this ghost story

927
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,208
But my friend here, no way

928
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,958
To prove there are no ghosts...

929
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,208
...do you know how many haunted
houses he has stayed in, right?

930
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,000
You must work hard
for 3 square meals

931
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,833
To lead a cushy life...

932
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,125
...only stealing another's assets
will reap rich rewards

933
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:50,292
Are you asleep?

934
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,083
No

935
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:57,125
You think I'll let you sleep, huh?

936
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:38,083
Hey! Get up

937
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,083
'I won't come, dear'

938
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,375
Get up, dude

939
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:43,792
How did we land here?

940
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,583
Hey! Don't ditch me

941
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,417
Jogging, huh?

942
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,458
I got a soooper buyer for you

943
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:01,958
If he likes this place
next moment you'll be loaded

944
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,833
Shall we show him the place?

945
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:05,625
Fine, let's do it in high spirits!

946
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:09,292
Only you and I know
about the ghost inside

947
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:11,000
It isn't a crime 
if we zip our lips

948
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:12,958
Not just between us
This whole town knows

949
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,667
That's why no one here will buy it

950
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,833
Good idea to dump it
on some chap from abroad

951
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:18,833
You want Lakshmi
to get married or not?

952
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:21,125
And my commission
Please call him here

953
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:23,333
Please come

954
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,750
Yes, sir

955
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:26,375
He looks like a foreign blockhead

956
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:28,208
Good idea to dump it on his head

957
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,792
Go inside, sir

958
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:34,250
Go in, I'll just make a call and join you

959
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:40,917
Good morning

960
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:43,667
I've come to India
to buy a property

961
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,083
I'll talk to you later

962
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:46,958
How many grounds is this?

963
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,667
Around 8, sir

964
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:53,125
How many owners?

965
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,625
Only us

966
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:55,875
Single ownership?

967
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,583
It's quite a big screen

968
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,458
Yes, sir
70 MM

969
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,417
Movies can be screened?

970
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,042
We have a run-down projector

971
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,167
Reels are torn
Can't screen a film, sir

972
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,708
You're mistaken, sir
You can screen a film

973
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,417
Don't we know our own theater?
You are wrong, sir

974
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,833
Want to watch?

975
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,875
'You'll run for your life
once you buy this place'

976
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:19,167
'We'll watch that if you like'

977
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,542
'Thinks he's Will Smith!'

978
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:21,875
'Look at his stride'

979
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,958
Is he really loaded?
Or is he taking us for a ride?

980
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,208
Don't leave me and scoot

981
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:37,333
What's up with them?

982
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,208
Google, run

983
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,667
I'll call you back

984
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,708
Where are you, sir?

985
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:53,958
Vanished into thin air?

986
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,792
Sir, can you hear me?

987
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,375
What do you mean? 
People you dream of end up dying?

988
01:08:12,417 --> 01:08:13,542
Let's leave this place

989
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,083
Staying alive is more important
than anything else

990
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:24,917
Let's go

991
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:30,625
My mother

992
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,333
Wedding date has been fixed

993
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:36,000
3rd week of May

994
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,500
Invitations are getting printed

995
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:39,375
When will you conclude the deal?

996
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:42,875
'Can you hear me?'

997
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,958
Any problem, son?

998
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,750
Nothing of that sort

999
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,292
Will be through in 2-3 days

1000
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:48,958
Okay, dear

1001
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,333
'Hey! 1 minute'

1002
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:51,542
'Tell me, ma'

1003
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,333
Your sister has wagered a bet with 
your brother saying you'll clinch this deal

1004
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,542
This is a question of her life she says

1005
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:03,958
'Without messing at least this'

1006
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,958
I am hoping you'll see the deal through

1007
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,250
Don't worry, ma

1008
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,333
I'll finalize it

1009
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,625
There's a place called
Kalitheerthan Kulam

1010
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,333
[humming a song from 'En Annan']

1011
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,208
Sir?

1012
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,750
How do we go to
Samiyaar madam?

1013
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:35,000
What is the issue?

1014
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:37,417
A spirit has to be exorcised, sir

1015
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:39,750
Which ghost is this?

1016
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:41,958
The one in Nagesh theater

1017
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,833
The ghost in Nagesh theater!

1018
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,667
- What's the matter?
- I want to live!

1019
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:47,792
Tell us and then run

1020
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,417
Brother

1021
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,042
Stop

1022
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,208
- Isn't someone calling us?
- I heard him too

1023
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,625
Come here

1024
01:10:20,292 --> 01:10:21,708
We came all the way only to see-

1025
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,625
I am aware of everything

1026
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:37,333
Keep this near your pillow at bedtime

1027
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,167
Everything will fall in place

1028
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:02,667
'Where are you, man?'

1029
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:05,333
I've just finished my duty and 
come to my friend's guest house

1030
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,417
'I guessed right'

1031
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,167
'Whom are you having a ball with?'

1032
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,750
I just completed my rounds and
came here to meet my friend, dear

1033
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:12,292
'Oh yes! You always speak the truth!'

1034
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,458
'Send me a selfie as proof'

1035
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:19,917
What's the use of being a policeman
and ending up so henpecked?!

1036
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:27,208
She'll ask snaps
in all the angles possible!

1037
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:06,167
'Police officer murdered mysteriously
Widespread panic'

1038
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:14,625
Who is the murderer?

1039
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:16,917
All our men are dying one by one

1040
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,792
Even I am baffled, bro

1041
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,583
The entire police department is perturbed

1042
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,292
All the murders have been horrific

1043
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,667
And no trace of the slightest evidence

1044
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,583
I feel this isn't the work
of any human being

1045
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,458
There's something else to it

1046
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,125
Let's meet a Malayali seer

1047
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,083
I know the reason 
you met me did not fructify

1048
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,500
The same problem
has cropped up again

1049
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:53,208
Swami, this is the lemon you gave us

1050
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,792
Place it on the sacred plaque

1051
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:12,667
You met me last night
You took this lemon

1052
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,625
None of those happened!

1053
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:19,625
You met an evil spirit
that came in my form

1054
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:24,292
Swamiji went to the temple in Kasi
and returned only this morning

1055
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,125
This is the sacred ash 
given by the Aghoris in Kasi

1056
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,500
...after praying to Lord Shiva

1057
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:33,917
At bedtime, sprinkle this 
in a circle around you

1058
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:38,958
No evil spirit can evade this power
and come anywhere near you

1059
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:40,917
Alright, swami

1060
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:45,917
Take it from him

1061
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,125
You still don't trust me

1062
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,625
If I was indeed the bad spirit

1063
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:54,125
...this powerful deity Kali 
would have scorched me to cinders

1064
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:14,417
Here he is

1065
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:19,750
1 minute

1066
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,375
What a surprise!

1067
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,958
- Come along
- What's up?

1068
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,208
Birthday today

1069
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,875
Give this as if it's your gift

1070
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:42,417
Bullshit!

1071
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:45,292
Today is your birthday
He doesn't even remember that

1072
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,542
Bad enough you waited for so long 
and made me also wait!

1073
01:15:48,583 --> 01:15:49,583
'You screwed up'

1074
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:50,708
Let's go

1075
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:53,292
I don't know how I forgot your birthday

1076
01:15:53,292 --> 01:15:54,458
It wasn't intentional

1077
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:56,625
Hear me out

1078
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:58,833
'This is what will happen
if girls run behind guys'

1079
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:00,833
I was too tense 
It skipped my min-

1080
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:02,083
'Listen to me, Himaja'

1081
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,000
'Must have skipped
 his mind, forgive him'

1082
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:13,375
She walked off in a huff
and you're cool as a cat

1083
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:15,917
If she is mad at me
being the possessive kind...

1084
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,625
...like last time she'll come back
in the middle of the night

1085
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:19,958
And knock on this door

1086
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,750
One more night with my sweetheart

1087
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,333
If you disturb me this time, I'll kill you

1088
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,167
Like that night?

1089
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,750
That wasn't your possessive girlfriend

1090
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,875
It was a spirit that came to possess you!

1091
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:33,875
If I hadn't barged in, you would 
have made out with a spirit

1092
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:35,208
She would have crucified you

1093
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,750
Why didn't you tell me right then?

1094
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,167
Were you in a mood to listen?

1095
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:41,500
At least now listen to me

1096
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:46,833
The spirit kills whomever I dream of

1097
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:52,292
If we figure out the link
between the 3 murders...

1098
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,250
...we can find this ghost's motive

1099
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:59,125
In broad daylight the murder of a girl 
in Nungambakkam railway station is unsolved

1100
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:01,792
You think you're the hero of 
'Ramana' investigating a crime

1101
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,667
They will nab you and imprison you
Even give you shock treatment

1102
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:08,250
You should go about your job, 
find a buyer, get your sister married

1103
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,875
Pay me the commission

1104
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:15,083
1 track mind about the brokerage
Friendship is more important than money

1105
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,542
'Praise be to Lord Shiva'

1106
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:38,750
Whatever fix you may be in
you won't stop flirting!

1107
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,542
What now?

1108
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,917
It's alright

1109
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:46,000
What's your problem?

1110
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:47,500
'Why were you kind of weird?'

1111
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,958
Won't you tell me?

1112
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:50,250
Forget all that

1113
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:56,458
You aren't mad at me, I hope?

1114
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,042
I misunderstood you

1115
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:30,625
Slept, dumbass!

1116
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:32,083
'Ghost it seems!'

1117
01:18:51,292 --> 01:18:53,542
[dogs barking]

1118
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:52,708
'Youngster's head exploded to bits
Mid night horrific tragedy'

1119
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,708
'I feel this isn't the work
of any human being'

1120
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,417
'There's something else to it'

1121
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:11,167
You said no evil spirit can 
get into the sacred ash circle

1122
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:12,417
But 1 more victim-

1123
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:15,125
Despite the sacred ash
1 more victim, right?

1124
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,417
What happened is different

1125
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:22,625
God won't quietly watch all the sinners
in this world without taking action

1126
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,375
You came to prevent this

1127
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:27,958
But no one can prevent
what will now ensue

1128
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,292
People will continue to be killed

1129
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:35,083
What is the motive?

1130
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,500
Who is the culprit?

1131
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,250
Why should I dream all this?

1132
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:42,208
Before the wee hours of dawn
you will know all the answers

1133
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,708
Go

1134
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:45,958
Don't come in search of me hereafter

1135
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:11,083
You can't find a buyer
till the spirit is driven out

1136
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,792
I called you over to convey this

1137
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:15,208
I will find a way
to drive away the spirit

1138
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,833
Don't stay in the theater

1139
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:17,833
You can sleep here

1140
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:18,875
Uncle, I don't mind-

1141
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:19,917
Listen to me

1142
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,833
You're wrong in taking it lightly

1143
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:23,958
I'll handle this

1144
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:26,667
- Did you give them food?
- Yes

1145
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:28,375
Go to bed
Treat this as your home

1146
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:30,958
Good night

1147
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,958
'I am worried for these 2 lads, dear'

1148
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:02,417
'Mysterious death of bachelor
in a guest house'

1149
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,875
'People will continue
to be killed'

1150
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:15,125
'Before the wee hours of dawn
you will know all the answers'

1151
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,833
If I sleep, I dream

1152
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:20,708
If I dream
someone is killed

1153
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,542
- If I don't sleep?
- Super, dude

1154
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,833
We'll see how anyone 
gets killed if you're awake?

1155
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,625
We shouldn't fall asleep

1156
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:28,833
We shouldn't sleep

1157
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,500
Don't sleep

1158
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,458
We slept so restlessly
in the theater

1159
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,208
That's why I felt drowsy

1160
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:54,292
Only you shouldn't sleep

1161
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,042
I can doze off

1162
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,708
Let me catch up on some sleep

1163
01:22:57,792 --> 01:22:59,917
You don't sleep, machan

1164
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:34,625
Naga, where are you?

1165
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,708
In my father's friend's house
Why?

1166
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:39,167
You said you wanted to share
something important with me

1167
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:41,917
'You asked me to come to the theater
and why did you go there?'

1168
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,042
I am in front of your theater

1169
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:44,958
Theater?

1170
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,542
'When did I ask you to come there?'

1171
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,417
Who would have asked her
to go to the theater?

1172
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,958
Himaja?

1173
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:38,417
Where is she?

1174
01:24:57,958 --> 01:24:59,542
HIMAJA!

1175
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:22,292
Naga, wait

1176
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:23,958
What are you doing?

1177
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:26,083
When did you come?

1178
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:29,833
Why are you here?

1179
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,792
Last night when we were on the phone

1180
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:33,875
...you slept

1181
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,750
I dreamt all this

1182
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,042
- You did?
- Yes

1183
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:48,667
I saw this in real life
in front of me

1184
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:50,250
In reality-

1185
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:52,792
- How did you see my dream?
- I don't know

1186
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,667
I recorded our call

1187
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:34,625
Then am I the one who killed everyone?

1188
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,625
What happened?
Tell me

1189
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,917
WHY...?

1190
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,333
WHO IS IT?

1191
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:31,542
Tell me

1192
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:36,125
Tell me now

1193
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:37,375
WHO ARE YOU?!

1194
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,667
WILL YOU TELL ME NOW OR NOT?

1195
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,125
Tell me

1196
01:29:52,167 --> 01:29:54,250
Why aren't you letting me out, huh?

1197
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,875
WHY AM I YOUR TARGET?

1198
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,125
Only if I'm alive
you'll kill everyone?

1199
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:26,458
What will you do if I'm not alive?

1200
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:25,458
'A place inhabited by orphans
is said to be a temple'

1201
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:28,458
'Even this house is a temple'

1202
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:29,917
'None of us had parents'

1203
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:33,875
'Dr Sakunthala 'amma'
raised and educated us'

1204
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,583
Come and eat

1205
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,625
- Grandma!
- Come, my dear

1206
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:43,333
You should study well
and do well in life, okay?

1207
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:48,125
'She will always be checking
Tamilselvi's page in Facebook'

1208
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:51,417
'And follow it to a T'

1209
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:00,708
Before 1950 there were
no major diseases in our country

1210
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,458
We used organic fertilizers
for our agriculture

1211
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:05,292
We ate healthy food

1212
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:06,750
We were hale and hearty

1213
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:10,458
Only then foreigners decided
to use us as a tool to mint money

1214
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:14,875
He tempted us and threatened us
to use chemical fertilizer

1215
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:17,333
Our produce turned toxic

1216
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,875
Consuming all that poison
we lead a disease-filled life

1217
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:21,125
And now

1218
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:23,375
We buy medicines from him
to cure ourselves!

1219
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:26,417
He is minting money
in millions using us

1220
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:28,542
Hereafter we should
eat only organic food

1221
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:29,625
And lead a healthy life

1222
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:31,125
Who said this?

1223
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:33,583
- Tamilselvi
- Who is she?

1224
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:34,917
She is a famous writer

1225
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:39,000
She exposes all the injustice happening
in our country by posting the news online

1226
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:40,875
Wait, I'm coming

1227
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,417
Let me get hold of
this naughty imp of a female!

1229
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:02,458
Watch this!

1231
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:13,750

1232
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:16,792

"I won't be scared though
 of anyone's dad you know"

1235
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:25,167
Who are you?
You look decent

1236
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:26,917
But barging in
without any etiquette

1237
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:28,083
Who lacks manners?

1238
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:29,750
I was ringing the bell
for 1/2 an hour

1239
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:32,708
You know how tough it is to find
a rural type of house in the city?

1240
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:35,000
I found it for you
hunting high and low

1241
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:36,167
I helped you settle in

1242
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:38,583
I came to collect
the brokerage of 50%

are taking me for a ride

1244
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,417
How much is your commission?

1245
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:45,667
Way too much

1246
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,625
A patient is here to see you, madam

1247
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:49,750
Wait, I'll be back

1248
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,292
What about my commission?

1249
01:33:55,042 --> 01:33:57,958
It's only a small tumor
You'll be fine after a surgery

1250
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
- I don't want an operation
- Why?

1251
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,458
I went to another hospital
The doctor said it will cost 150000

1252
01:34:03,542 --> 01:34:06,333
I can't afford to pay so much

1253
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:08,333
That is why I came to you
for a 2nd opinion

1254
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:11,708
Okay...okay
Don't cry

1255
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:13,458
I have to fend for my daughter

1256
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,250
I won't charge you for the surgery

1257
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,958
But you must pay me
only my fees as the doctor

1258
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,208
'Too good to be true!'

1259
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,042
- How much, doctor?
- Rs 10

1260
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:24,625
You mean Rs 10,000?

1261
01:34:24,667 --> 01:34:26,542
No, just Rs 10

1262
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:29,167
That's all?
Here, doctor

1263
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:31,667
You drop it in my donation box

1264
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,875
Bless you, doctor

1265
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:44,417

- Yes, dear?

1266

from the orphanage to a bungalow in ECR

1267
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:51,667
I'm terrified, akka

1268
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,542
'Somehow come and take us back, akka'

1269
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,958
- Do you know the address?
- I know, sis

1270
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,167
Don't be scared
I'll be there soon

1271
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,333
Take your commission

1272
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:09,708
Hereafter if you barge in unannounced
I'll be really mad at you

1273
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:13,792
Let this be my humble contribution
to the surgery you'll be performing

1274
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,375
What do you mean?

1275
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,750
Nowadays you can't even
buy a tablet for 10 bucks

1276
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,042
But you are willing to do
 a surgery for 10 rupees

1277
01:35:20,042 --> 01:35:21,667
You are like God, ma

1278
01:35:22,542 --> 01:35:24,292
- Accept it
- No, it's okay

1279
01:35:24,292 --> 01:35:25,500
- Don't refuse
- No need

1280
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:26,583
Please accept it

- Are you coming?

1284
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:45,750
I'll pay you 2,000

1285
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:47,875
- Only for an hour
- This chic chick wants to pay me!

1286
01:35:47,917 --> 01:35:49,333
Tell me, yes or no?

1287
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,542
Okay...er-

1288
01:35:52,042 --> 01:35:53,500
Why did you select me?

1289
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:56,458
If I see certain faces
I can find out at once

1290
01:35:58,417 --> 01:35:59,625
Start your bike

1291
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:02,708
Just because I immediately responded...

1292

...don't mistake me

1293
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,667
Worse than a snail!

1294
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:06,708
This is...

1295
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:08,958
...first time for me

1296
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:12,750
When there are so many waiting...

1297
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:14,750
...why selecting me?

1298
01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:17,417
Hello, stop your bike

1299
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:20,333
- Get down
- What's wrong?

1300
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:22,208
I will clear your doubt right away

1301
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,167
- Sit behind me
- You know to ride a bike?

1302
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:25,458
You crawled at snail's pace

1303
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,667
Watch me now

1304
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:28,625
Girls these days are
in a tearing hurry!

1305
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Hold on to me

1306
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:40,458
Get down

1307
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:42,875
How can we?
 Right here, huh?

1308
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,792
Yes, now get down

1309
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:50,250
In case there's a police raid or-

1310
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:51,792
Keep quiet

1311
01:36:52,833 --> 01:36:55,875

girls nowadays have forged ahead...

1312
01:36:55,917 --> 01:36:57,583
...you've been
such a greenhorn!

1313
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:59,542
Come
Come here

1314
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:04,750
Didn't you hear me?

1315
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:06,000
Stand still

1316
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:08,458
Hold on to this

1317
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:11,417
She is a fast one
Beats me hollow!

1318
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:13,458
What are you waiting for, dude?

1319
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:17,417
I'll prove I'm a bull
who cannot be tamed that easily!

1320
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:18,458
Sit down

1321
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,000
Oh! 1st should I sit, huh?

1322
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:22,167
- I asked you to sit, right?
- I am ready

1323
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,583
Move your hands

1324
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:28,583
What do you intend doing up there?

1325
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:30,958
Please wait here
I'll be back

1326
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,583
This is a love issue, right?

1327
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:34,125
No, serious matter

1328
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:36,042
Why did you drag me
to solve your problem?

1329
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,792
Please don't talk
Give me my bag

1330
01:37:37,875 --> 01:37:40,458
You will coolly go inside
What will I do standing here?

1331
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,125
- Listen to me, give it
- Get lost!

1332
01:37:42,167 --> 01:37:44,500
In our lingo this is called
'holding the light for the act'

1333
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,458
Go and do your job!

1334
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,208
I need that bag
Give it to me

1335
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:51,250
- Wait, I'll be back
- Will I at least get that 2000?

1336
01:37:51,292 --> 01:37:52,375
Yes, I will

1337
01:39:16,542 --> 01:39:19,208
Assistant commissioner sir
I clinched the foreign deal

1338
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:22,208
I have a treat for you
Wait upstairs, I'll join you

1339
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:38,167
It's a superb project, sir

1340
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:39,542
You got your way 100%

1341
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:43,375
- What, uncle?
- Come

1342
01:39:45,292 --> 01:39:46,333
Let go of my hand

1343
01:39:48,292 --> 01:39:49,500
Is she okay?

1344
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:51,542
Sir, will this girl suit your needs?

1345
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:53,208
Take her to the room

1346
01:39:53,417 --> 01:39:54,667
Let go of me

1347
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:41,042
Grandma, I'll join 
that big orphanage

1348
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:43,917
I'll study well and
become a doctor like you

1349
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:46,333

'Rs 10 doctor'

But akka and you should visit me
every week without fail

1351

Definitely, dear

1352
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:55,000
We'll take care of them even better
than the love you showered here

1353
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:56,750
Okay, take good care of her

1354
01:40:56,792 --> 01:40:57,958
Godspeed, sweetheart

1355
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:00,958

from her body before she dies

01:47:41,917 --> 01:47:44,833
'But many ruthless people
with adequate power and authority'

1395
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,958
'...have brought our orphanages
 under their control'

1396
01:47:48,042 --> 01:47:51,250
'They extract blood once a week
from the children here'

1397
01:47:51,292 --> 01:47:56,125
'They remove the plasma
and re-inject the blood into them'

1398
01:47:56,167 --> 01:47:59,458
'Without even their knowledge
they are being used as a plasma donor'

1399
01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:04,750
'Plasma obtained in this manner
is powdered and exported illegally'

1400
01:48:04,792 --> 01:48:08,792
'This illegal act is worse than
smuggling cocaine, marijuana and heroin'

1401
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:11,833
'The blood from these orphans
with wrinkles on their stomachs...'

1402
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:14,833
'...help to remove the wrinkles
on faces of many rich people'

1403
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,292
'This is a curse for humanity'

1404
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:20,125
'The most staggering fact is...'

1405
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:22,417
'...Chennai holds the first place
in this business'

1406
01:48:22,417 --> 01:48:26,667
'I have brought to your notice
one such gang's illegal activities'

1407
01:48:26,708 --> 01:48:29,625
'I have uploaded the videos
of all those involved in this racket'

1408
01:49:12,417 --> 01:49:13,667
Shalu...?

1409
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:47,750
Wait near the front gate

1410
01:49:47,792 --> 01:49:49,208
- Hurry up
- Okay

1411
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:57,000
The girl who knows all our secrets...

1412
01:49:57,042 --> 01:49:58,042
...is none other than

1413
01:49:58,083 --> 01:49:59,083
Tamilselvi!

1414
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:01,958
'Posting controversial
truths on Facebook...'

1415
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,875
'...one who is very popular among people'

1416
01:50:03,917 --> 01:50:05,333
'It is her account, sir!'

1417
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,083
She's very dangerous

1418
01:50:08,625 --> 01:50:10,417
She shouldn't be alive

1419
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:12,792
'As usual let's finish her off
by using catfish'

1420
01:50:12,833 --> 01:50:14,792
Does she hold any evidence against us?

1421
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:17,500
'No, sir, I've destroyed everything'

1422
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,208
'Can we kill her now?'

1423
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:20,750
I should do the honors

1424
01:50:20,792 --> 01:50:22,583
- Don't be in a rush
- Okay, sir

1425
01:50:22,625 --> 01:50:24,042
I'll come with catfish

1426
01:50:25,917 --> 01:50:27,542
Where is she?

1427
01:50:27,542 --> 01:50:30,125
Is this how you guard her?
Go and look for her

1428
01:50:34,417 --> 01:50:35,542
Tell me, sir

1429
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:38,250
The girl who barged
 into our bungalow today-

1430
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:44,417
Let it be Tamilselvi or any celebrity

1431
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:45,875
No need to worry at all

1432
01:50:45,917 --> 01:50:48,333
That theatre is under my jurisdiction

1433
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:51,208
I'll ensure the police department
doesn't bother you

1434
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,750
'But make certain
no one gets the dead body'

1435
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,917
Brother?

1436
01:53:56,958 --> 01:53:59,167
What happened, bro?
Please forgive me

1437
01:54:45,833 --> 01:54:49,458
"I bow and seek refuge
in the Lord of the Universe"

1438
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:53,708
"Praise be to Bairava
Fearful form of Lord Shiva!"

1439
01:54:55,375 --> 01:54:58,458
"Oh Lord, salutations to you
Lord of the 3 worlds"

1440
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,417
"Shiva, 3-eyed Lord
Greatest of all Gods"

1441
01:55:00,458 --> 01:55:03,458
"He who gives enlightenment beyond
 Astral, Physical and Spiritual worlds"

1442
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,500
"Epitome of fury with a vast body
like the blue sky and sea"

1443
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:10,500
"Lord of all beings, consciousness
which is untouched by the universe"

1444
01:55:14,625 --> 01:55:15,958
"Peace for all"

1445
01:55:18,667 --> 01:55:20,417
"Peace for the living and non-living"

1446
01:55:24,792 --> 01:55:29,250
"I trust in the divine essence and nature
to form the immortal, eternal Lord"

1447
01:55:29,292 --> 01:55:31,625
"Lord Parvati and Uma
Lord of wild animals"

1448
01:55:31,667 --> 01:55:33,500
"I submit myself to you"

1449
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:37,083
"Lord of knowledge
Lord of all that exists"

1450
01:55:37,125 --> 01:55:39,708
"Lord of Brahman
of supreme knowledge"

1451
01:55:39,792 --> 01:55:42,833
"The universal Spirit,
I am Shiva, I am the eternal Shiva"

1452
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,333
For that spirit

1453
01:56:20,458 --> 01:56:23,250
...to transmigrate to another place

1454
01:56:23,667 --> 01:56:25,458
...it needs a body with breath intact

1455
01:56:28,333 --> 01:56:29,875
Only with the aid of his body...

1456
01:56:31,125 --> 01:56:33,042
...it has killed each and everyone

1457
01:56:42,667 --> 01:56:46,750
"I continuously bow
to that Linga of Shiva"

1458
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:50,792
"Honored by Brahma, Krishna and Indra
Adorned and resplendent by clear light"

1459
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:53,875
"Which destroys the grief
born out of birth"

1460
01:57:10,333 --> 01:57:12,083
Her blood...

1461
01:57:12,625 --> 01:57:14,458
...is mixed with his blood

1462
01:57:16,458 --> 01:57:18,333
Only if he is killed...

1463
01:57:18,708 --> 01:57:20,250
...and his body is cremated

1464
01:57:21,417 --> 01:57:23,583
...that spirit possessing him
can be destroyed

1465
01:57:25,625 --> 01:57:26,625
Otherwise...

1466
01:57:27,625 --> 01:57:30,208
...that spirit will kill all of us!

1467
01:57:33,083 --> 01:57:34,208
Sakthi

1468
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:35,542
Finish him off

1469
01:57:40,375 --> 01:57:41,667
It's fine even if we murder

1470
01:57:41,667 --> 01:57:45,958
Using orphans who have
no family to question us...

1471
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,250
...we can achieve our target

1472
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:54,625
- Who is that girl?
- Which girl?

1473
01:57:54,667 --> 01:57:57,167
The girl on your bike
you were going around with

1474
01:57:57,375 --> 01:57:58,792
Doctor's granddaughter, Shalu!

1475
01:57:58,792 --> 01:58:00,542
Wanted me to find
a house for rent

1476
01:58:18,917 --> 01:58:21,000
'Why are you hesitating?
Finish him off'

1477
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,542
Don't hit him

1478
01:58:31,792 --> 01:58:33,250
'You made a mistake'

1479
01:58:48,958 --> 01:58:51,250
"Peace for everything
in this cosmic manifestation"

1480
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:54,167
[Holy chant continues]

1481
01:59:07,042 --> 01:59:09,417
"Praise be to the Remover of Obstacles"

1482
01:59:20,042 --> 01:59:22,333
"I worship Thee
Greatest of Gods full of mercy"

1483
01:59:23,417 --> 01:59:26,167
"Lord Shiva as Rudra present
Drive out the evil predominant"

1484
01:59:40,542 --> 01:59:43,000
"I am consciousness and bliss
 I am Shiva, I am Shiva"

1485
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:57,250
Kill him!

1486
02:00:17,625 --> 02:00:20,667
"To be blessed with prosperity
let me meditate on Goddess Lakshmi"

1487
02:00:20,667 --> 02:00:23,125
"O' wife of Lord Vishnu,
give me higher intellect"

1488
02:00:29,667 --> 02:00:32,125
"And let Goddess Lakshmi
 illuminate my mind"

1489
02:00:36,542 --> 02:00:38,917
"We bow to the highest principle, Hanuman"

1490
02:00:38,917 --> 02:00:41,042
"Manifestation of
the reliever of suffering"

1491
02:00:59,417 --> 02:01:01,125
[Holy chant continues]

1492
02:01:02,125 --> 02:01:05,500
"Lord Vishnu who is also Shiva and Brahma
the authority of every knowledge"

1493
02:01:05,583 --> 02:01:07,500
"May He help us at all times"

1494
02:01:07,583 --> 02:01:10,250
Get that blood without
smearing it on your hands

1495
02:01:11,833 --> 02:01:16,625
"God, give me higher intellect and
let God Rudra illumine my mind"

1496
02:01:21,917 --> 02:01:23,000
Let go

1497
02:01:25,417 --> 02:01:28,458
"I seek refuge with God full of grace
who is Brahman, who has six faces"

1498
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:31,833
"Hail Muruga with peacock as vehicle
 son of Lord Shiva who performs miracles"

1499
02:01:31,958 --> 02:01:34,792
"Protector of our universe
Lord of the eternal heavens"

1500
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:44,333
