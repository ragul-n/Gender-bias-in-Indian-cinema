1
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:51,246
How you inured.

2
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:57,561
I went in the bathroom and fallen.

3
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,104
You fell in the bathroom?

4
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:13,407
You understand me fool.
How you injured tell me.

5
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:19,209
How you injured tell me.

6
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:31,861
He has beaten you.

7
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,326
Yes he has beaten you.

8
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:47,707
You have beaten her.

9
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:54,652
Why you have beaten her?
- Madam I did anything.

10
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,450
You did nothing.

11
00:02:58,258 --> 00:02:59,850
Now you can not
dare to speak truth.

12
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,457
Madam she is my wife and I
can beat her or do anything.

13
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,759
What you will have to do.

14
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,123
She is a woman and you
can do anything to her.

15
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,327
She is your wife and you beat her.

16
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:13,734
You people do the marriage
for beating wife. Get up up.

17
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:17,338
Your wife needs protection
from her husband.

18
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,503
She expects to be taking
care of not beaten up.

19
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:23,513
You don't understand. You
have much power then beat me.

20
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,847
You don't understand.
You beat me and show.

21
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:27,883
You're very strong...

22
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,320
You should be hanged...

23
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,587
You people should be hanged.

24
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:37,686
Leave me! - What are you
doing? - He should be hanged.

25
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,432
This is not the way
to behave Mr. Anju.

26
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,797
And this Is not happening
for the first time.

27
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:45,728
You know that last time I have to...

28
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,397
...latterly plead to the board...

29
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,675
That they should not sack
you from the hospital.

30
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:52,540
You are a good doctor.

31
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,239
But no one can tolerate
such type of behaviour.

32
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,545
What happen to you...

33
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:03,516
Whenever such case comes
why you become so hyper.

34
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,753
Anyways its your life.

35
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,665
We don't want to loose you but...

36
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,071
You do one thing.
Take leave for some days.

37
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,239
Just short yourself out.

38
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,748
The way there are
darkness residing...

39
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,218
...behind these twinkling lights...

40
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,518
...similarly among my
happiness there are...

41
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:40,655
...some wounds that
haven't yet healed.

42
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,764
I'm applying ointment
on others' wounds...

43
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:54,462
...when my pain has
still not alleviated.

44
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,778
This is not ink but my tears.

45
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,648
This is not story but the truth.

46
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,646
If I write then perhaps
my pain will be reduced.

47
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,412
Maybe my wounds will be eased...

48
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,252
If I speak then perhaps
life will be easy.

49
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,494
Otherwise I will be
dying like this only.

50
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,497
That was a wonderful city.

51
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:27,400
Bijnor one small city
of the Uttar Pradesh.

52
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,398
In the age of 6 years...

53
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,207
my father was posted there
in the govt. Hospital.

54
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:40,746
Bhai saab every one were calling
by this name to that Ravana.

55
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:48,322
Bijnore was like Lanka of this
man where he has kidnapped me.

56
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:53,259
He was giving life and death
to the people at his choice.

57
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:00,230
Only I was such a girl...

58
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:06,076
Who could not get these
two neither death nor life.

59
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,478
I become just a live dead body.

60
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,609
Brother's unmarried wife.

61
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,657
Yes, this is what
people used to call me.

62
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:26,593
Only the words were not
for us but become truth.

63
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:40,375
Doctor saab what
are you discussing.

64
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,857
Aunty ji you will give tea.

65
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,261
What happen. Why are you standing.

66
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,103
Doctor saab sit.

67
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,665
Sit.

68
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,174
What is the problem.

69
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,280
If my hand would
not be on your head...

70
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,826
...then they would
have finished her.

71
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,161
This is not the big city
like Agra and Meerut.

72
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:44,507
This is Bijnore and then
she is your daughter.

73
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:50,579
If ten people insult her
then you will feel good.

74
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:55,278
Speak.

75
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:33,619
Every one has ignored to
my screaming in that city.

76
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,530
They were watching
us 24 hours and...

77
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,295
...our all efforts become waste.

78
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,570
The death was also angry to us.

79
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:52,609
Baba has taken one promise
on that day not to die.

80
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:56,308
After that day my
eyes were waiting...

81
00:08:57,617 --> 00:09:01,519
That some one may come and
take me away from that Lanka.

82
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,153
Brother you contest in
the election from Bijnore...

83
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:25,323
From our party...

84
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:27,459
And also select the
ministry yourself.

85
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:29,523
Then we will be
sitting In the lucknow.

86
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:36,364
Jastant I am not connected
with any ideology.

87
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:37,698
There is respect.

88
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,895
Lucknow comes in
Bijnore. And Bijnore?

89
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,298
Nowhere goes.

90
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:42,705
You can understand everything.

91
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,374
Then the substance is that Tyagi...

92
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,138
...ji you tell the chief minister...

93
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:52,547
That the water will the 50

94
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,620
Otherwise take the
canal out of the Bijnore.

95
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:18,737
Rajbir see your son
knows that what...

96
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,746
...is liking of the Bhai saab.

97
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,809

Well Bhai saab I am going.

101
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:35,852

One finger on the
stitching and other...

104
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,097

Understand where is other finger.

This is in swinger.

00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,511
Understand.
- See.

110
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,758
And watch the hand.

Yes, brother.

112
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,336

Do like this. Trained him like me.

116
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:06,118
Lot of time is required for this.

117
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:10,713
He is just like the Rajbir.

118
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:20,821
The same head same
nose and same ears.

119

00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:06,636
Brother I will leave him there.

00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,472
You have hited me from bat.

138
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,274
With bat...

139
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,688

What I want Bhai.

183
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:16,410
I was worried about you only.

184
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:21,075
I thought that this boy
has taken your place.

185
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:28,283
But you are a lucky man.

186
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:29,651
Means?

187
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,860
I feel jealous to see you.

188
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:47,544
You pray the God that I
respect to your in law.

189
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,378
The day on which that
respect goes then Bhup Singh.

190
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,593
You do the duty.

191
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,221
Fine. Bye.

192
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,808
What are you thinking.

193
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:27,482
Registrar saab you are taking
signature on the paper...

194
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,253
But this is Govt. Land.

195
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,589
Bhai saab the Govt.
Is also your only.

196
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,257
You are wise man.

197
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:40,159
Bablu show the land of Najibabad to him.
- Yes.

198
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:41,897
You learn to control your anger.

199
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,294
I heard some people have started...

200
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,835
...their agriculture on the land.

201
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:49,641
You tell them that the land
belongs to Jaswant Sisodia.

202
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:50,800
Okay.

203
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,401
Rupa you go and leave the
Registrar saab to the car.

204
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:55,605
Its O.K.
- Okay.

205
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,481
Why you are not going.

206
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,353
Bhai saab I was to
ask you one thing.

207
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:10,556
Will you be angry?

208
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,061
He is my younger brother and
how I will be angry to him.

209
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,095
Ask.

210
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:20,371
Bhai saab yesterday
night that girl.

211
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:41,121
Don't ask again.

212
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:45,253
Yes.

213
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,392
You go they are waiting for you.

214
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:18,287
You too went to meet,
but it was in vain.

215
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,558
Who are you people. Go from here.

216
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:25,669
You come here and ask
then I will tell who I am.

217
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:28,764
Hello. How are you?

218
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,575
Don't speak in English
and get lost from here.

219
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:35,441
Are you mad.

220
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,474
This is our land and asking
us to go out from here.

221
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:43,748
You see there your
uncle is plaguing there.

222
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:45,346
He is cultivating the land.
- Yes.

223
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:49,224
How he can plough the land.
This is the land of Jaswant Bhai.

224
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,356
Which Jaswant.

225
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:54,263
Get lost from here.

226
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:30,390
Come on... hurry.

227
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,395
Babloo, get up.

228
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,495
Hey, Raju. What happened?

229
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,335
Look at Guddu.
- Get up, Guddu.

230
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:39,427
Hold him...

231
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,231
Look at Bhiku...

232
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,170
Lot of bleeding...

233
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:45,500
Bhai saab here everything is wrong.

234
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:47,208
What are you doing this.

235
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,581
Bhai what I tell you our
all the men have been killed.

236
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:54,549
Bhai I am worried for him only.

237
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,354
He is not looking amongst them.

238
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:01,750
O.K. Bhai saab.

239
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:18,793
Fine. Okay. Change his dressing.

240
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:22,260
Okay. - Give this medicine
to patient of bed number 12.

241
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,211
Listen. You...

242
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:07,873
Where are you going? You
can't go out in this condition.

243
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,406
Bhai saab forgive
him. He is our child.

244
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,280
When he is child then
live like child only.

245
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:15,383
What was the need of
doing all these to him.

246
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:17,216
We are not in shortage of men.

247
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:23,759
What reply I will give
to the Rajbir to go there.

248
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,534
Tell me what reply I will give.

249
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,501
Come here what reply
I will give to...

250
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,802
...your father Rajbit to go there.

251
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:40,471
What would I've replied?

252
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,712
You have grown up very nicely to...

253
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:44,373
...your son but could not save him.

254
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:46,708
The same.

255
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,623
How he will be married...

256
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,067
And who will give
girl to this blind man.

257
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,799
Now I have to give dowry.

258
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,542
Rupa start the
arrangement of dowry.

259
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,340
What we have to give.

260
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,473
You tell me.

261
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:25,248
Sofa!
- Sofa, double bed, T.V., fridge...

262
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:32,496
And one mosquito net also.

263
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:44,170
Rupa he has killed seven
people by the cutter.

264
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:46,802
You think about it.

265
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:56,243
You have thought that he has
killed seven people alone.

266
00:32:57,889 --> 00:32:59,356
The same madness!

267
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,287
The same... what's it called.
- Obsession.

268
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,491
Same obsession.

269
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,257
Just like Rajvir.

270
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,630
Always ready to kill or get killed.

271
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:18,834
Don't worry.

272
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,474
One- eyed boy will
find one- eye girl!

273
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,459
It'll be strange for people
of a big city like Mumbai.

274
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,427
But this is the
truth of small town.

275
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:44,724
Neither Government
nor political party...

276
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,629
...but people like
Jasawnt Sisodia rule here.

277
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,700
The accused is
released with honors.

278
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:53,903
We've won!

279
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,545
People like Jaswant
Sisodia decide who...

280
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,545
...should be punished or pardoned.

281
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:01,710
We've won.

282
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:05,687
Let's go.
- Great...

283
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,260
Brother was saying...

284
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,692
You've come. Now don't worry.

285
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:27,709
Bhai this is not possible.

286
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:31,813
Whatever happen is not good...

287
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:35,786
And we have to give
reply to the higher-ups.

288
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,190
You control him.

289
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:45,126
If I control him then he
will become like a buffalo.

290
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:49,098
But I want to keep him
like a bullock only.

291
00:34:50,535 --> 00:34:52,901
You take care from him.

292
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,205
Greetings.

293
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:57,105
Come brother.

294
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,673
Come on.

295
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:16,149
I think we have to stop you
and sack out of our community.

296
00:35:18,062 --> 00:35:20,792
You are supporting to
that Jaswant Singh...

297
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,459
...Sisodia to leave
our own community.

298
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:32,837
Our community is illiterate and
only you become a big officer.

299
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:37,410
We have seen so much
dreams and so much thinking.

300
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:49,250
Bhupe my younger
brother has been killed...

301
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,096
And I will not leave to any one.

302
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:04,441
By study the patience comes...

303
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:12,575
And the patience teach
to wait for the time.

304
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,316
Let the right time come.

305
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,290
I am bringing.

306
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:41,404
Brother give me three
vanilla ice-cream.

307
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:55,383
Take this, daughter.

308
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:59,289
No I don't want.

309
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,255
Let it be.

310
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,632
Take it.

311
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,085
Nothing, brother. He was
going with his girl friend.

312
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,287
Doctor saab where are you going.

313
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,564
There is still time in the duty.

314
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:37,429
I am going for smoking.
- Smoking.

315
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,466
See our doctor is
also smoking then...

316
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:41,129
...what he will give treatment.

317
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,637
Just see where the doctor is going.

318
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,177
Where he will go. He
is the man of the Bhai.

319
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,685
Mr. Sharma what are you doing.

320
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,619
You know there is lot of
danger in meeting here.

321
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,023
His men are sitting in the
car and if they have seen then.

322
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,454
You should have called me on phone.

323
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,754
Doctor saab I can not take
your signature on your.

324
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,433
You sign on the places
where marked with the pencil.

325
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,039
This city is wonderful.

326
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,236
Bijnore...

327
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:27,282
Entirely fed up
completely disgusted.

328
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:31,480
I have seen to do every
thing and every try.

329
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,258
O.K. You take this
as a last attempt.

330
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:42,331
There should not be any problem.

331
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:47,161
This is the question of
my daughter's whole life.

332
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:05,188
I know that you don't like
my coming here like this.

333
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:09,318
But what to do.

334
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,119
Come.

335
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:35,486
You try to understand my problem.

336
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,251
You are daily coming
In the rikshaw and...

337
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:40,756
...all the public are watching you.

338
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,389
I can not tolerate this.

339
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:50,461
How it is possible that any
one else may see you except me.

340
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:56,106
Your examination center
is in the Dhampur...

341
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:58,733
And the car will come to take you.

342
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,843
Now you can not go
Dhampur by rikshaw.

343
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:05,743
You'll go...

344
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,245
...in a rickshaw for 40 kilometers.

345
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:29,596
I am doing all these
for your happiness.

346
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:15,750
In the cool breeze I
ask for a ray of sun.

347
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:28,360
Under the blue sky, the eyes
hold sight of stagnant water.

348
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:32,829
In the cool breeze...

349
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:49,848
Why is there humiliation
on deserted path?

350
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:56,559
Why does the air
seem to be cursing us?

351
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:05,135
Why is there humiliation
on deserted path?

352
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:10,766
...Why does the air
seem to be cursing us?

353
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:17,343
For which crime we
got this punishment?

354
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:28,690
In the cool breeze I
ask for a ray of sun.

355
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:41,364
Under the blue sky, the eyes
hold sight of stagnant water.

356
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:45,307
In the cool breeze...

357
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,374
See how beautiful girl.

358
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:54,812
She is the concubine of
the Bijnore's Bhai saab.

359
00:42:56,854 --> 00:42:59,288
Oh...
- Unmarried.

360
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:13,202
Daily I am dying in that city...

361
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,568
And I promised with my father
that I will not commit suicide.

362
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,771
That is why I can not take my life.

363
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:32,316
And Jaswant Sisodia...
he won't let me live.

364
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:37,152
You please do one
thing and kill me.

365
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,162
So many people are daily
dying in the accident...

366
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,095
And if I will die then
it makes no difference.

367
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,433
You do anything and
push me from ditch.

368
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:46,527
But you kill me. I don't
wan to go back in that city.

369
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:49,105
You please kill me.
You please help me.

370
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:52,472
Please. Help me.

371
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:57,344
The life and death
is in the hand of God.

372
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:02,778
The courage is required
for life and not for death.

373
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,820
What I will do to live.

374
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:16,190
Even my breaths are not mine own.

375
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:21,065
There is no one in
the Bijnore to help me.

376
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,166
There is nobody... not even you.

377
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:31,570
Life is scattered.
Free is from bane.

378
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:37,643
Give me some breath of life.

379
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:43,456
Give me a little sky to fly.

380
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:49,495
Give me some breath of life.

381
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,500
Give me a little sky to fly.

382
00:44:55,906 --> 00:45:01,572
Give me some breath of life.

383
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:04,738
Give me some breath of life.

384
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,213
Fine. I'll see to it.

385
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:22,799
Sir I heard that the party of
the Bhai saab is wonderful.

386
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:25,359
Some time you take to me also.

387
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:29,239
Gopal let me have the meal.

388
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,864
Sir.

389
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:34,367
What is it? Can I eat first?

390
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:37,108
Who is there.

391
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:46,448
May I come in?

392
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:50,088
Yes... come in. Please.

393
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:55,865
Please sit, sir.

394
00:45:58,436 --> 00:46:00,734
Come is there any enquiry.

395
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:03,130
Yes...

396
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:05,132
But don't worry.

397
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:08,138
It is not against you.

398
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,412
Then against whom.

399
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,350
Jaswant sisodia. Are
you joking with me.

400
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:25,590
Sir you people have made a joke.

401
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:28,725
We...
- Yes the entire system.

402
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:34,136
You read the file and
fix the date of the case.

403
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,668
Who will give statement.

404
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:39,166
The entire family.

405
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:40,640
If they don't turned up then.

406
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:42,869
Who will take
responsibility of our safety.

407
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,615
Some arrangement for
that we will make...

408
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:50,886
But if any one else
comes to know about it...

409
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:55,691
Then one enquiry will be
constituted for you also.

410
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,603
Bye the way your
file is also ready.

411
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,196
Sir.

412
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,706
Happy birthday.

413
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,247
Sir...

414
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:21,784
Congratulations, brother.

415
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:24,248
Sir...

416
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:00,086
My heart is lost in love.

417
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:09,664
My heart is lost in love.

418
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:14,670
I have been plundered
in the market.

419
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,806
This is the ways
of the merry world.

420
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,046
This is the magic of love.

421
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:29,651
This is the ways
of the merry world.

422
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,588
This is the magic of love.

423
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:38,321
I am oblivious to everything.

424
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:43,499
Everyone ask me
what happened to me.

425
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:49,131
This question is on every lip.

426
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:53,801
My heart is lost in love.

427
00:48:53,877 --> 00:48:58,837
I have been plundered
in the market.

428
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:03,611
My heart is lost in love.

429
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:08,750
I am in a big trouble.

430
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:32,074
Applying and wearing ear rings...

431
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:37,310
...when I stepped out...
there was a big gathering.

432
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:42,781
I didn't realize
when it happened.

433
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,627
My heart is lost in love.

434
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:52,758
I have been plundered
in the market.

435
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:57,637
My heart is lost in love.

436
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:04,580
I am in a big trouble.

437
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:28,294
I told you to keep control to him...

438
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:36,305
Otherwise he will break
his head on the walls.

439
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:38,674
No problem.

440
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,510
No wyou give him in my
hand. I will see him.

441
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:58,692
Mind your business. Bhupe go.

442
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:02,265
You're high.

443
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:05,469
Bhupe go.

444
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:25,521
Bhai saab this is not good for you.

445
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:32,864
You have not done
good in front of all.

446
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:39,639
You didn't do the right thing.

447
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:45,104
You should not have done this.

448
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:50,379
In front of everyone...

449
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:58,820
Till today... you didn't
do the right thing.

450
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:55,543
I told you that I am waiting
for the right time patiently.

451
00:52:57,788 --> 00:52:59,153
Now the time has come.

452
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:10,432
Even then I will prove that
I was the gujar and till

453
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:17,635
I am alive I will
remain gujar only.

454
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:24,143
You don't leave him now.

455
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:30,586
Don't spare him!

456
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,399
Hey...

457
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,408
Now I'm with you...

458
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:18,857
It's the festival of holi!

459
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:23,570
Take this.

460
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:26,808
How much for this?
- 10 rupees.

461
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:28,071
Take color...

462
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:31,471
It's the festival of holi!

463
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:34,853
The breeze is
helpless because of gratitude.

464
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:41,961
The air seem to be
filling the breath with poison.

465
00:57:42,705 --> 00:57:49,372
The breeze is
helpless because of gratitude.

466
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:56,776
The air seem to be
filling the breath with poison.

467
00:57:57,553 --> 00:58:05,619
We are living a meaningless life.

468
00:58:06,662 --> 00:58:11,622
Every happiness had turned dark...

469
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:15,631
I had prayed to
Goddess which came true.

470
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:18,998
You've become a big doctor too.

471
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:22,272
Like our Doctor.

472
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:24,276
CMO.

473
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:27,440
Chief medical officer.

474
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:31,319
Are you happy?
- Hmm.

475
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:51,370
If I'm culprit, even
you're no less at fault.

476
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:57,840
If I'm quiet, you too are watching
everything silently.

477
00:58:58,314 --> 00:59:01,806
O God, why are you helpless?

478
00:59:01,884 --> 00:59:05,581
We all are your creation.

479
00:59:05,654 --> 00:59:09,715
All my illusions are shattered.

480
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:12,989
The heart is scathed.

481
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:16,887
The heart is scathed.

482
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:21,869
The heart is scathed.

483
00:59:22,338 --> 00:59:24,533
The heart is scathed.

484
00:59:48,931 --> 00:59:51,331
Brother, why don't you marry?

485
00:59:56,872 --> 00:59:57,634
Why?

486
01:00:01,243 --> 01:00:02,540
Why do you want to know?

487
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:14,021
Why are you
oblivious to your own world?

488
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:21,557
I don't like destiny
written by you, O Lord.

489
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:28,763
My heart says to
leave this world of sorrow.

490
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:32,796
Everything is false here.

491
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:36,367
The heart is scathed.

492
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:40,037
The heart is scathed.

493
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:43,877
The heart is scathed.

494
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:50,850
O God, you're
omniscient. Try to be a human.

495
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:58,264
We had to die everyday to
live, try this life too.

496
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:02,760
Let me crush this faith.

497
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:06,535
I am my own God now.

498
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:10,976
Now I don't want your mercy.

499
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:16,551
No favors...

500
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:19,616
On one hand my
complement has made her

501
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:22,353
And otherside she become indebted...

502
01:01:22,424 --> 01:01:24,051
...due to the favour of Bhai saab.

503
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:26,451
What you will do.

504
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,924
What to do he was a human being.

505
01:01:34,436 --> 01:01:36,370
His decision was his own problem...

506
01:01:38,807 --> 01:01:42,868
And could not understand
it. He went away.

507
01:01:55,824 --> 01:01:57,223
Bhaisaab is calling.

508
01:02:11,006 --> 01:02:18,310
Take the curd as it is
cool and your mind will be cool.

509
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,579
Tell him.

510
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:25,342
Our party is in need
of the Jaswant Sisodia.

511
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:28,788
And in other the
personal respect. In law

512
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:32,551
I am talking about the proud and
determination of our caste.

513
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:36,530
The question of
understanding him does not arise.

514
01:02:43,806 --> 01:02:44,966
Then tell him.

515
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:47,741
Tomorrow is something happen...

516
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,801
Then don't tell me that
I have not done anything.

517
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:51,809
He has become mad now.

518
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:54,546
He wants to take
revenge from Jaswant Shisodia.

519
01:02:54,616 --> 01:02:55,878
He has lost his mind.

520
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:57,580
He'll be incinerated.

521
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:02,021
Now there is no time to understand.

522
01:03:05,227 --> 01:03:07,422
The arrow has left the bow.

523
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:22,667
Follow me...

524
01:03:31,887 --> 01:03:34,583
After completing the task go back...

525
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:38,986
And if arrested then...

526
01:03:40,562 --> 01:03:42,462
Brother I am not
doing for the first time.

527
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:44,629
Money.

528
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,769
The money is full.

529
01:04:22,704 --> 01:04:25,673
See who came in
front of your house.

530
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,842
Jaswant Sisodia himself came here.

531
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:33,872
Brother...

532
01:04:39,388 --> 01:04:40,753
Ah... brother.

533
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:56,602
I love you so much.

534
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:58,303
Got it?

535
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:03,506
What happen like this.

536
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:07,915
What is my mistake.

537
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:09,941
Tell me.

538
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:15,819
You are my younger brother.

539

Tell me what to do.

572
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:05,764

574
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:11,707

This is the paper you sign it.

586
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:37,908

Listen.

592
01:15:11,886 --> 01:15:15,754
We don't know what
God has decided for us.

593
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:19,592
I don't know
whether the life will give...

594
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:21,322
...another chance to live us or not

595
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:25,692
I also don't know whether I
will be ever free from this Lanka.

596
01:15:26,868 --> 01:15:32,807
But I know that if anything happens
to your because of me...

597
01:15:34,843 --> 01:15:36,777
Then I would
never forgive to myself.

598
01:15:41,716 --> 01:15:43,013
You please take care of your.

599
01:16:16,684 --> 01:16:20,381
Why don't you come in front of me.

01:16:21,456 --> 01:16:24,892
Wait just let me meet to the Bhupe.

601

A good hunter never
kills the bird by bullet.

607
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:21,772
Because the titar can not
fly much at the most three field.

Malik don't talk me unnecessary.

677
01:23:13,401 --> 01:23:17,394
Your daughter will go away
from the hand of Jaswant Sisodia.

678
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:20,841
I did mistake.

679
01:23:20,975 --> 01:23:23,739

Come.

688
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:34,968
This is the
desire of every father...

689
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:38,569
To do the kanyadan of his
daughter with his own hand.

690
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,042
But I can not do.

691
01:25:43,451 --> 01:25:45,544
The anger is your right.

692
01:25:46,287 --> 01:25:48,448
I had only stopped you from dying.

693
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,350
Daily I was loosing...

694
01:25:53,427 --> 01:25:58,194
And telling you false that I
will fulfill your all the dreams.

695

Daily I am dying.

698
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:23,823
I don't know whether I
was a coward or a father...

699
01:26:25,292 --> 01:26:32,027
And feeling ashamed in
begging to forgive me also.

700
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,872
Doctor listen carefully...

701
01:26:48,782 --> 01:26:50,773
If Anju would not become mine...

702
01:26:51,552 --> 01:26:53,281

703
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:02,460

breath is not stopped.

I will support you.

707
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,392
He's here.

708
01:28:49,503 --> 01:28:51,562
He is my younger brother.

709
01:28:51,972 --> 01:28:54,372
You get all the
paper work from him only.

710
01:28:54,908 --> 01:28:56,603
Now he has to
look after everything.

711
01:28:56,744 --> 01:29:00,942
I love you so much.

712
01:29:01,515 --> 01:29:03,039
Come here.

713
01:29:05,419 --> 01:29:07,353
Some people will say you cheater...

714
01:29:08,522 --> 01:29:10,490
And also say that you
are the man of the house.

715
01:29:12,326 --> 01:29:15,352
Because whom the Lanka of the
Jaswant Sisodia has destroyed.

716
01:29:16,897 --> 01:29:22,358
But whatever you are
doing is true and correct.

717
01:29:48,562 --> 01:29:50,462
It's a bad new regarding brother.

718
01:29:59,773 --> 01:30:00,899
Blow hard.

719
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:11,376
Yes Tyagi ji.
- Namaste.

720
01:30:11,652 --> 01:30:12,550
Namaste.

721
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:13,984
I wanted to tell you something.

722
01:30:14,054 --> 01:30:15,248
Yes.

723
01:30:15,489 --> 01:30:19,585
Your boy has signed a
testimony against you.

724
01:30:20,694 --> 01:30:22,753
You had sacrificed major.

725
01:30:23,397 --> 01:30:24,625
What will you do with him?

726
01:30:25,499 --> 01:30:26,898
He's coming to Lucknow with Ajju.

727
01:30:33,073 --> 01:30:34,335
Brother what happen.

728
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:40,508
Own man of the
house destroyed Lanka.

729
01:30:42,383 --> 01:30:43,407
Meaning?

730
01:30:45,285 --> 01:30:47,583
Whole life I was going on
the path given by the Bhaisaab...

731
01:30:49,556 --> 01:30:50,853
And never asked any question.

732
01:30:52,493 --> 01:30:54,393
But now I wan to
give support to the truth.

733
01:30:58,332 --> 01:30:59,959
I will give
statement against Bhai saab.

734
01:31:01,635 --> 01:31:02,966
I will support you in the court.

735
01:31:07,975 --> 01:31:09,840
The time is very
short. Come from here.

736
01:31:15,849 --> 01:31:18,044
The breath of this city
is in the hand of Bhaisaab...

737
01:31:20,421 --> 01:31:22,013
But there is a new
life out of this city.

738
01:32:11,371 --> 01:32:16,308
The journey is very long
and you will not be trapped.

739
01:32:22,516 --> 01:32:29,388
Have made this house by collecting
each and everything.

740
01:32:33,327 --> 01:32:40,563
But now you are
going away from me only.

741
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:53,969
I don't understand that
what I should feel much.

742
01:32:57,317 --> 01:32:59,547
Anju is going away to me...

743
01:33:02,322 --> 01:33:05,758
Or you are taking
away to the Anju from me.

744
01:33:09,363 --> 01:33:13,629
Well tell me...

745
01:33:17,404 --> 01:33:20,498
I have accepted
Rajbir as my elder brother...

746
01:33:22,476 --> 01:33:23,909
And to you as my younger brother.

747
01:33:26,246 --> 01:33:28,612
What is wrong in this.

748
01:33:32,452 --> 01:33:36,388
Bhaisaab you did wrong.

749
01:33:39,326 --> 01:33:41,055
You have given so much love that...

750
01:33:42,696 --> 01:33:44,960
I could not understand the difference
between right and wrong.

751
01:33:48,936 --> 01:33:50,801
But her
screenings have open my eyes.

752
01:33:51,972 --> 01:33:54,736
It has ashamed to my soul.

753
01:33:56,577 --> 01:33:59,546
Bhai saab let us go from here.

754
01:34:01,348 --> 01:34:02,372
No.

755
01:34:03,951 --> 01:34:07,352
I can not allow her to go
and not allow you to take her.

756
01:34:09,456 --> 01:34:10,787
Try to understand.

757
01:34:14,962 --> 01:34:17,863
I love her more than my life.

758
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:24,868
I can not live because her.

759
01:34:30,711 --> 01:34:32,906
Understand.
- What is this love Bhai saab.

760
01:34:35,015 --> 01:34:38,007
You just see her carefully.

761
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:42,721
Only her body is your
and that too by force...

762
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:45,558
Not her heart.

763
01:34:49,696 --> 01:34:50,754
You say it is love.

764
01:35:03,777 --> 01:35:06,905
You will tell me the
definition of the love to me.

765
01:35:08,248 --> 01:35:09,374
This is Ibjore...

766
01:35:11,718 --> 01:35:14,346
And here the poems will
not be read for our love.

767
01:35:14,421 --> 01:35:15,445
But there is love.

768
01:35:15,989 --> 01:35:18,924
Poetry will not be made
for our love but there is love.

769
01:35:19,226 --> 01:35:22,684
Jaswant Sisodia does not
want to do the marriage...

770
01:35:24,297 --> 01:35:25,321
Look.

771
01:35:28,902 --> 01:35:33,896
This heart is
beating in the name of Anju.

772
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:40,676
If you love her so
much then let her go.

773
01:35:42,549 --> 01:35:43,573
You free her.

774
01:35:45,318 --> 01:35:46,910
If her steps are stopped...

775
01:35:48,855 --> 01:35:52,222
Then her body and
soul will be yours.

776
01:35:54,361 --> 01:35:55,589
If the steps are stopped.

777
01:36:01,968 --> 01:36:03,731
If the steps are stopped...

778
01:36:04,638 --> 01:36:05,969
Naive!

779
01:36:08,942 --> 01:36:11,001
I have not learned the
love by reading in the books...

780
01:36:11,244 --> 01:36:13,644
But I felt it and then acquired it.

781
01:36:14,648 --> 01:36:15,876
If I will allow her to go...

782
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:18,474
Then I will become a
story of the defeated love.

783
01:36:19,953 --> 01:36:22,251
Jaswant Sisodia will
never alow her to go.

784
01:36:22,322 --> 01:36:23,721
I will keep her here.

785
01:36:24,558 --> 01:36:26,219
Every one are dong the same.

786
01:36:27,527 --> 01:36:30,394
The marriages are
being done for the woman...

787
01:36:32,966 --> 01:36:35,366
And this is
happening since thousand years.

788
01:36:35,702 --> 01:36:37,567
This is the purpose.

789
01:36:38,772 --> 01:36:39,796
This is true.

790
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:44,408
I don't know what is
right and what is wrong.

791
01:36:45,879 --> 01:36:46,937
But I know that...

792
01:36:48,315 --> 01:36:52,411
Only she is having
right on her own breaths...

793
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:55,645
And not you.

794
01:37:01,828 --> 01:37:02,886
I am going...

795
01:37:05,332 --> 01:37:06,799
And if possible you forgive me.

796
01:37:16,777 --> 01:37:17,801
Stop.

797
01:37:18,612 --> 01:37:19,636
Stop.

798
01:37:25,318 --> 01:37:27,878
Stop. Stop.

799
01:37:56,383 --> 01:37:57,407
Brother...

800
01:38:04,491 --> 01:38:05,515
Brother...

801
01:38:06,626 --> 01:38:09,424
Are you hurt?

802
01:38:12,265 --> 01:38:13,732
Brother...
- Yes.

803
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:16,264
Brother
- Nothing will happen you.

804
01:38:16,736 --> 01:38:20,297
Wait. See is there any one.

805
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:22,565
Hey, brother...

806
01:38:25,712 --> 01:38:28,442
Someone bring a car...

807
01:38:29,683 --> 01:38:30,775
Get up.

808
01:38:31,384 --> 01:38:32,783
Get up. Nothing will happen.

809
01:38:49,236 --> 01:38:50,464
Listen...

810
01:38:52,572 --> 01:38:53,596
Hey...

811
01:38:54,641 --> 01:38:55,665
Brother.

812
01:38:56,843 --> 01:38:58,606
Brother.

813
01:38:58,712 --> 01:39:01,476
No, brother. No...

814
01:39:02,482 --> 01:39:04,416
No, brother.

815
01:39:04,584 --> 01:39:07,781
Brother, forgive me.

816
01:39:08,655 --> 01:39:09,679
No...

817
01:39:13,426 --> 01:39:15,724
Hey... call someone.

818
01:39:16,563 --> 01:39:18,428
Is someone there?

819
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:21,964
Brother...

820
01:39:22,302 --> 01:39:26,762
Rajbir you forgive me.

821
01:39:29,743 --> 01:39:31,904
Rajbir you forgive me.

822
01:39:37,984 --> 01:39:40,680
Brother, get up.

823
01:40:04,511 --> 01:40:05,535
Kill me.

824
01:40:08,481 --> 01:40:09,505
Kill me.

825
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:18,848
Shoot!

826
01:40:34,641 --> 01:40:36,506
I become free from the prison.

827
01:40:37,544 --> 01:40:39,978
But there are so many
girls in the small cities...

828
01:40:40,947 --> 01:40:42,847
Who are in the
prison of the Ravana.

829
01:40:43,917 --> 01:40:45,544
Every time there
is no need to take...

830
01:40:45,618 --> 01:40:47,279
...birth of the Ram to get them free.

831
01:40:47,988 --> 01:40:54,416
Only one human being is
enough to make free the Anju like me.

832
01:40:55,895 --> 01:40:58,625
Perhaps this story may give courage
to any Anju for living.

833
01:41:00,266 --> 01:41:04,498
Perhaps this story may give
birth to a Bibhishan in the Lanka.

834
01:41:06,573 --> 01:41:07,631
He has gone...

835
01:41:09,376 --> 01:41:11,003
But told a truth to me.

836
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:17,282
He said that courage is
required for living and not for death.

837
01:41:39,339 --> 01:41:44,333
When I see you, my
heart welcomes you.

838
01:41:44,944 --> 01:41:50,211
On your path, I lay my world.

839
01:41:50,617 --> 01:41:55,554
My desires are
aroused after meeting you.

840
01:41:55,755 --> 01:42:01,318
You are the one who
fills the ambience with aroma.

841
01:42:01,394 --> 01:42:12,464
I want you and I
pray for you every moment.

842
01:42:12,906 --> 01:42:23,942
O my companion. Come
into my arms.

843
01:42:48,374 --> 01:42:53,471
I see only you on
the path of loyalty.

844
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:58,910
There is happiness
only because of you.

845
01:42:59,652 --> 01:43:10,551
Day and night, I miss you.
This is the effect of love.

846
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:21,404
I search for
you. Heed my request.

847
01:43:21,941 --> 01:43:33,443
O my companion. Come
into my arms.
