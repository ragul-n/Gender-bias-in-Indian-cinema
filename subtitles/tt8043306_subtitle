1
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:38,833
<i>This world is a tough place, my dear.</i>

2
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>It changes color everyday.</i>

3
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>A wise man once said,</i>

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,000
<i>"The best way to live your life is
to blend in with the color of the world."</i>

5
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,292
<i>And this world is run
only by one color.</i>

6
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,708
<i>The color of money!</i>

7
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,042
<i>Where there's money, there's fame.
Where there's money, there's respect.</i>

8
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,250
<i>Where there's money, there's life.</i>

9
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,542
<i>My ma always tells me,
"Son, money isn't everything."</i>

10
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,542
<i>And I just say,
"Ma, money really is everything."</i>

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,958
<i>Ask those who don't have it,
and just look at those who do!</i>

12
00:01:11,042 --> 00:01:13,125
<i>They have a unique swag!</i>

13
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,083
<i>For instance, just look at this fella.</i>

14
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,042
<i>Not easy on the eyes,
and a face only a mother could love.</i>

15
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,583
<i>But his pocket's full of money.</i>

16
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,542
<i>So the world asks him,"how are you honey?"</i>

17
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:26,125
Make sure the building doesn't have
any of these...

18
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,333
Mr. Sheikh!

19
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,792
His building is next door.

20
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,500
Salaam, Mr. Sheikh.

21
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,417
All dandy?

22
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,208
Yes, Billu. All set?

23
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,625
Both set and fit.

24
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,750
But right now...

25
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:18,542
dad's sent a message for you.

26
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,667
It's of a very serious nature.

27
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,708
Billu, my dear.
Can you even spell "serious"?

28
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,375
So get on with it.

29
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,042
He says...

30
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,958
-"Where's my money?"
-Money?

31
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:40,958
What money?

32
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,292
The money you took.

33
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,958
Ever plan on returning it?

34
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,875
So, you've come for the money?

35
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,417
Come here.

36
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,333
Forward this message to your
father with utmost respect.

37
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,833
What message?

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,125
For now, keep this.

39
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,917
If he wants the rest, tell
him to come get it himself.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,042
And tell him,
"Butt, your better days are yet to come!"

41
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll tell on you!

42
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,458
You don't know who I am!

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,083
-How do I look?
-Very nice.

44
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,792
-You're also looking nice.
-Thank you.

45
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,333
It has started, right?

46
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:34,833
Can you hear me?

47
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,708
In the name of Allah,
most gracious, most merciful.

48
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,750
So, Mr. Butt, what are your plans for
the betterment of your constituency,

49
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,417
and of women's rights in your area?

50
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:45,667
<i>Quote Allama Iqbal.</i>

51
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,708
<i>Dream...</i>

52
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,625
Mr. Butt, "Dream..."

53
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,917
Dream!

54
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a wonderful thing to dream.
Everyone has dreams.

55
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,542
I am sure you do too.

56
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,708
Allama Iqbal also had a dream.

57
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,667
What? Billu got smacked!

58
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,083
That Billu got smacked!

59
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,292
No! That's not what you had to say!

60
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,417
No! That's not what you had to say!

61
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,792
Oh, for God's sake, please stop!

62
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,083
Oh, for God's sake, please stop!

63
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,375
He got slapped for real, Mr. Butt.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,708
He got slapped for real.

65
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,750
What? Did he really get smacked?

66
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,458
Excuse me!
Could you please cut the shot?

67
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,167
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

68
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,708
Ashfaaq!

69
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,583
Mr. Butt, I am right here!

70
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,667
What happened? Who got slapped?

71
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,375
Billu got slapped.

72
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,917
Billu got slapped?

73
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,125
I hope nobody saw!

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,958
-I don't know about that.
-Who the hell slapped him?

75
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,958
-Sheikh!
-Sheikh! That...

76
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,417
-What happened?
-Something about someone's mother.

77
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,417
What are you staring at?
Call Teefa!

78
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,000
-Okay.
-Hurry the hell up! Call him!

79
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,958
<i>Where are you?</i>

80
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,875
<i>Need you to get to the job right now!</i>

81
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,833
<i>Billu just got smacked!</i>

82
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,333
<i>Sheikh, that son of a gun!
He slapped my son!</i>

83
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,875
He is even getting away
with my money! Get him!

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,042
Chill out, Mr. Butt. I am on it.

85
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,208
Sheikh, you son of a gun!
You won't get away with this!

86
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,833
Who are you talking to?

87
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,333
Your aunt May!

88
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,458
Salaam, Mr. Sheikh!

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,083
Teefa?

90
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,833
Where are you headed?

91
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,750
Keep moving.

92
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:28,792
Mr. Sheikh, let's just get out of here.

93
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,292
Where are you going?

94
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,708
This here, is one expensive
<i>kulfi</i> I've got for you.

95
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,125
With some cream in it.
Want some?

96
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,750
I am so done with Butt.

97
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:49,417
Look, I am telling you,
don't get involved.

98
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,708
You're smart, aren't you?

99
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,542
Mr. Sheikh, I am also telling you--

100
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,708
Don't worry, Mr. Sheikh.
Go ahead, I'll take care of this punk.

101
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,667
Looks like no one really
believes in talking anymore!

102
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,958
I mean, don't you have
some manners or etiquette?

103
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:16,750
Didn't your mama teach
you anything, you punks?

104
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,417
You know what they say.
"Spare the rod, spoil the child."

105
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,458
Finish him!

106
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,042
Now, if you all had stayed in
school you wouldn't be up to this!

107
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,583
The teacher must now resort to the rod.

108
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,875
So, shall we begin?

109
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,750
Where's the key?
Put the key in!

110
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,167
He's down, Mr. Sheikh!

111
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,750
-Put the key in, you idiot!
-Yes.

112
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,667
He's mopping the floor with them!

113
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:57,917
There goes my money!

114
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,792
Mr. Sheikh, the car won't start!

115
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,833
Hurry up!

116
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:40,667
Thank God! Hurry up, you idiot!
Faster!

117
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,750
He won't leave us alone!
Stubborn lad!

118
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,667
Turn, hurry up!

119
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,125
Drive faster!

120
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,333
Move!

121
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,542
Watch out! You'll wreck the car!

122
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't you dare move, you scoundrel!

123
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,708
Easy on the hand, ma'am!

124
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,708
Where did she come from?

125
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,708
Damn you, woman!
My money's on the line!

126
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,583
Get out of the way!

127
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,958
Get out of the way!

128
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,417
Get away! Are you crazy?

129
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,375
That curry smells nice.

130
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,958
Could you save a little for me?
I'll be back before you know it.

131
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,375
Go, go!

132
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,208
Mr. Sheikh, you really
should have had that <i>kulfi.</i>

133
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,708
Don't grab me by the collar!

134
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,708
Mr. Sheikh!

135
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:19,167
I swear to god, you can take my life...

136
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,292
but I won't give you the money!

137
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,875
Mr. Sheikh, I don't want your life.
I want the money!

138
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,917
But if you insist,
I'll go for your life.

139
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,583
Teefa, my dear...

140
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,292
How about we play a game?

141
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,750
Six bullets, right?

142
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:40,958
Well...

143
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,792
now, we got five.

144
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:45,667
If it doesn't fire,
the money's all yours.

145
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,875
But if it does,

146
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,750
I guess we know
who'll be keeping the money.

147
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,375
Teefa, my son.
My dearest!

148
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,458
Please don't fire.
No, no! Son, please don't fire!

149
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,250
No! No!

150
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,000
Mr. Sheikh!

151
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,583
Teefa, my son,
I knew you wouldn't fire at me.

152
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,750
Mr. Sheikh, if only one
was as lucky as you.

153
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,292
But only if they could
be as despicable as I am.

154
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:25,500
If I may?

155
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,167
You sure?

156
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,167
Why, thank you!

157
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:35,417
Teefa, don't you dare forget this day!

158
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,083
Oh, I almost forgot!

159
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,333
Mr. Butt had sent a message for you.

160
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,750
He said...

161
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,708
Teefa, my darling,
you're going to remember this.

162
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,125
-Wow, Mr. Butt.
-Here you go.

163
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,042
This is for you,
fresh from the mountain!

164
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,875
Exactly 20. Count them.

165
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,000
What's the point?

166
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,542
If you're saying they're 20,
I am sure they'd be 20.

167
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,875
You should know, I never trust anybody.

168
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,875
But if I do, I trust blindly.

169
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,292
But...

170
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,083
don't you ever break it.

171
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,792
No, Mr.Butt, we're your children.

172
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,708
-Here's your dessert.
-Wow!

173
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,417
Wonderful.

174
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,667
Mr. Butt, just don't forget your promise.

175
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:55,917
What promise?

176
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,542
You forgot? My restaurant!

177
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,750
What are you saying! How can I forget?

178
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,000
"Teefa's Tikkas!"

179
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,625
"The best in the world!"

180
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,792
Done, my son!

181
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,125
I've been fixing things for you
since you were a kid.

182
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,708
How can I possibly forget this?

183
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,375
Alright, Mr. Butt.
May I take your leave?

184
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,333
Sure.

185
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,667
-Say hi to your mother on my behalf.
-Absolutely!

186
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,292
They say, "sweet's good for you."

187
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,292
I'd say take a couple more for the road!

188
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,208
Why is it always me
who has to wait for you?

189
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,833
And why do we always eat here?

190
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,958
When you know, why do you ask?

191
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:13,250
-Anya, please act normal today.
-Keep watching, I'll be really cool.

192
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,667
We'll see how "cool" you are.

193
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,833
-Anya!
-Is he coming here?

194
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,833
Yeah, he is and he looks hot as hell!

195
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,875
What did I do, Sara?

196
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,542
-No, go ahead. Act cooler please.
-What is he gonna think of me?

197
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,000
I am the biggest idiot in this world!

198
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,042
You sure are.

199
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,083
Looks like someone's hitting on someone.

200
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,875
Tell him to get in line.

201
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,917
We ain't here for nothing!

202
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,250
Damn those eyes!

203
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,667
Why don't you look here again?

204
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,792
Does baby want a look-see?

205
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,000
Dad, I swear.
I just tried to talk to him.

206
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:44,667
I'm gonna kill you!
Just try and come at me again!

207
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,792
Don't you trust me?

208
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,083
I didn't even touch him!

209
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,625
Sister, can you please
just give me a chance to talk!

210
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,042
That guy's in the hospital.

211
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,458
And the restaurant's
lodging a case against you.

212
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,958
Against me? Me!

213
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,917
Dad, a case should
be lodged against that guy!

214
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,250
He has no manners!

215
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,250
Wow!

216
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,042
So, you've had a sudden
epiphany about "manners"?

217
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,875
Great! This is all I needed right now!

218
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,917
Behave! She's your mom!

219
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,375
Anya!

220
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,583
It wouldn't have come to
this if she had any manners.

221
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,583
Anyway, Commissioner Joe
is handling the case.

222
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,292
We'll find out everything.

223
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,417
Here, talk to him.

224
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,208
Teefa! You're here?

225
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,542
-Why don't you say something?
-Ma, how are you?

226
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,000
Teefa, look!

227
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,833
I've cooked some delicious
vegetable curry for you!

228
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,875
-Almost ready!
-Ma, did you forget?

229
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,250
It's Friday!

230
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,208
Today, I get to be your cook,

231
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,750
and you just relax
and watch some TV.

232
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:14,083
But the TV hasn't been
working since that last power cut!

233
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,000
Really? Why don't you check?
It might be working now.

234
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,583
I checked this morning!

235
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,875
Well, why don't you
check again for me tonight?

236
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,292
Alright, if you say so.

237
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh! Teefa, what's this?

238
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,792
LED TV! The big screen!

239
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,250
-So pretty!
-Check this out!

240
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,417
Come, sit! I'll show you!

241
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,042
Sit down.

242
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,375
I'll show you.
Check this out.

243
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,583
You can watch all your favorite
programs whenever you want!

244
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,042
-Lovely!
-What do you want to watch?

245
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,958
Films? Dramas?
Cooking shows? Whatever you want!

246
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,208
Tell me.

247
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,667
Are you enjoying it?

248
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,375
Yes, I am.

249
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,000
But tell me something,
where did this come from?

250
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,583
Ma, I've told you so many times.

251
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,000
Don't bother with the details, just enjoy.

252
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:13,750
Son, even if you do the
right thing by wrong means,

253
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,042
it'll always be wrong.

254
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,833
Ma, why do you get so
serious all the time? Let it be!

255
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,042
Just taste this curry for me.
Does it taste good?

256
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,417
Listen to your me.
Let go of what you're doing.

257
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,958
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

258
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes, Ma. You're right!

259
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,250
Darkness cannot drive out the darkness.

260
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,417
But a UPS can, right?

261
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:40,417
And a UPS comes from money.
And if we'd bought one,

262
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,917
we wouldn't be
playing "Dark Room" every night.

263
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,458
Look, Ma.

264
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,125
I try to explain certain
things to you, but you don't get it.

265
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,333
You know what that is?

266
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,792
These "things" bring you peace,

267
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,375
and these "things"
come with money, okay?

268
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,417
Listen to me.

269
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,458
I want to see you at peace,
why don't you understand?

270
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:08,667
Money can't buy you peace, my son.
Only love can.

271
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,375
This is something
you'll only find in books, Ma.

272
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,958
I've explained you a thousand times.

273
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,500
You just ruin the mood!

274
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,792
Let me taste that curry.

275
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,042
Here, try to enjoy your life.

276
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:34,417
Looks like you have an
excellent teacher. Who is it?

277
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,542
There's this hot auntie,
goes by the name Surraiyya.

278
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,042
Oh God!

279
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,792
Stop it!

280
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,833
It's you, Ma.
You mean the world to me.

281
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,042
Whatever I do, it's just for you.

282
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,833
Yeah, Sara.
And this time, it's pretty serious.

283
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,000
Dad was so pissed, he said...

284
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,833
Anya is getting out of control!

285
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,250
Well, she already is.

286
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,542
<i>Then?</i>

287
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,333
Then what? That Sophie!

288
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,333
She was at the same joint again,
running behind that "Andy" fella!

289
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,042
I've been telling you to get her married.

290
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,292
If things get out of hands,
you'll regret it!

291
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,667
Are you sure he's the right guy for Anya?

292
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,000
<i>Bilal? But he's a baldy!</i>

293
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,333
<i>How can you even compare
Andy and his deep blue eyes</i>

294
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,333
<i>with that egghead!</i>

295
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,375
Just think about your
business prospects with Bajwa.

296
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,750
I can't even imagine.

297
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:40,208
But one thing's for sure.
I'd rather die than get married!

298
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,792
<i>Listen, I have an idea.</i>

299
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,958
Sounds like a good idea.

300
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,250
But how are we going to do this?

301
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,417
Engagement, then straight
to the wedding ceremony.

302
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,500
When?

303
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:57,083
<i>Imagine! You, Andy,
his guitar and the lake.</i>

304
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,583
Anya will get married and just leave?

305
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,417
Listen, what about Butt?

306
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:17,167
He's my oldest friend
and has hopes for his son.

307
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:22,208
Don't you think that
it's time to clear things out?

308
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,958
You're talking to him
on Skype tomorrow, right?

309
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,458
Then talk about this.

310
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,625
If not now, then when?

311
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,542
Yes.

312
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,667
I'll talk to him.

313
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,042
Khalida, why isn't this working?

314
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,542
Are the pipes blocked or something?

315
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,500
In the name of God!

316
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:49,917
Damn! Is that how big my face is!

317
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,417
Well, then you have to give it to me

318
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,042
for being so patient
with such a big face!

319
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,417
Alright!

320
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:59,750
You're wearing a suit?
You think it's your father's reception?

321
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,292
Daddy, we're here for a marriage
proposal, not a hockey match.

322
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,792
Oh my dearest, cutest son!

323
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,375
Oh, Basheera! Hello!

324
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:10,667
<i>It's Bonzo. Bonzo, please.</i>

325
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,417
But for me, you're Basheera, aren't you?

326
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,833
Look man, just look at
how time's gone by.

327
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,500
That's what I'm telling you, Butt.

328
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>We should also be investing
in new technology for our business!</i>

329
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,000
Let go of the business for now!

330
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,458
I wanted to talk to you,
about an important family matter.

331
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,917
Yeah, I think it's time.

332
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,750
You go first.

333
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:40,250
Look, Anya's all grown up,
and so is my son, Billu.

334
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,042
Get lost.

335
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:49,208
So, as I was saying,
it's time that the kids got married.

336
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:50,125
Right.

337
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,000
You're right!
I was also going to say that--

338
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,792
See? He got it and
I didn't even have to say anything.

339
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,542
That's how we've always been!
Telepathic, I tell you!

340
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,333
Okay, tell me.
What have you thought?

341
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,750
Butt, I've thought
of getting Anya married.

342
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,750
That calls for a celebration!

343
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,375
Here, have these sweets! Open your mouth!

344
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,167
<i>But, there's a problem.</i>

345
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,917
You had told me to share my
problems with you, remember?

346
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,833
Yes, but what's the problem?

347
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,125
The company's shares are selling off,

348
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,333
and I'm losing ownership of the business.

349
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,833
You remember Bajwa?

350
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,625
Yeah, the guy with the crooked nose?

351
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:37,833
Yeah, him.

352
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:43,167
He said that he'll buy the shares
and help me retain my post and...

353
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:47,625
And? Get to the point, Basheera.

354
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,083
And...

355
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,583
Bajwa asked for my daughter's
hand in marriage with his son Bilaal.

356
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,750
Oh! So, you're trying to
ask me how to say no to them, right?

357
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:05,833
Right.

358
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,875
No, we had to say yes.

359
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,875
What do you mean, "you had to say yes"?

360
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,875
I mean, Anya's is tying the knot!

361
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,958
What? Anya's tying the knot?

362
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:29,833
Let alone that you could've asked me,

363
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,625
you didn't even tell me!

364
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,292
I was about to tell you, mate!

365
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,250
I am not your mate!

366
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,542
"About to tell you!"
But did you?

367
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,083
Did you even ask?

368
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:46,250
Basheera, all my life...

369
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,125
I've done exactly what you asked me to.

370
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:51,292
And you are off to wed your daughter,

371
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,083
without even asking me?

372
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,958
You didn't care to inform!
Right?

373
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:56,042
Right.

374
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,708
<i>Butt, why are you being so emotional?</i>

375
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,833
At least I have emotions to be emotional!

376
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:03,708
I am not cold-hearted like you!

377
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:06,958
Butt, can you just
relax and listen to me?

378
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:09,167
I am not going to listen to you anymore!

379
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,083
All talks end right here,
you horse-faced idiot!

380
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,458
Butt, please try to
understand the situation.

381
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:17,292
I am not a man of "situations"!

382
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,500
I am a man of heart!

383
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,250
Did I have the time to
understand the situation

384
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,958
<i>when I starved my own children</i>

385
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,500
<i>so that I could save money
to send you abroad?</i>

386
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,208
Did I try understanding the situation

387
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:33,375
when Shauki's goons came to beat you up

388
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,833
and I stood tall to protect you?

389
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:41,000
How I took blows from
their fists and hockey sticks!

390
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,083
Did I try understanding
the situation then?

391
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,042
Butt!

392
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,458
In fact, I now understand,

393
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:52,208
that our friendship was never
a sacred bond for you!

394
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,000
It was just business!

395
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,208
Butt, now you're crossing your limits.

396
00:29:57,292 --> 00:30:00,083
Oh, you have no idea
of what my limits are!

397
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,125
Now I dare you to get Anya married!

398
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,208
I'll see how you go through with it!

399
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,958
What?

400
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,458
What did you say?

401
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,792
You're challenging
me to get Anya married?

402
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,542
Yes!

403
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,042
You damned son of a gun!

404
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:34,083
You think you can stop me?

405
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,750
You think you've made me?

406
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,458
Who the hell do you think you are!

407
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,625
<i>I am the one who made you!</i>

408
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,042
You used to sell freaking
yoghurt dumplings on Multan Street!

409
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,417
Have you ever seen your son?

410
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,042
His face is bigger than entire my house!

411
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,833
You think I'll let Anya marry him?

412
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,792
I'll punch you right across
the screen all the way to hell!

413
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:53,875
I'll...
I'll not spare you!

414
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:57,875
I'll kick you in your damn face!
You don't know who I am!

415
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,667
-Screw you!
-I'll punch you hard!

416
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,250
Go to hell!

417
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,792
Butt, do whatever the
hell you think you can!

418
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,833
Is that a challenge?

419
00:31:05,917 --> 00:31:07,292
Well, I guess it is!

420
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,958
Then let's shake on it!

421
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,417
There you go!

422
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,958
Shut this damn thing!

423
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

424
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:44,000
Daddy, I've never asked
you guys for anything!

425
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,500
And the one time I did,
you couldn't get it for me?

426
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,625
People are already
making fun of me out there!

427
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,333
I had warned you!

428
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,750
Your friend is nothing
but a greedy bastard!

429
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:59,167
Shut up! All you do is blabber!

430
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,292
That's it!

431
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,667
No one cares about me!
I am going to shoot myself!

432
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,792
No, my son, don't!

433
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,333
Put the gun down.
It does work sometimes, you know.

434
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,833
Oh God, my son is going to die!

435
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:17,250
-No, my son. Please don't do it.
-Get back, Mommy!

436
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:21,250
Either you all get me married
to my Anya or else I'll shoot myself!

437
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,667
You son of a gun!
What do you want me to do?

438
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,292
-Should I just go and nab her?
-Yes!

439
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:30,042
What!
Have you lost it?

440
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,000
He's absolutely right!

441
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,000
You nab people all the time,

442
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,667
why can't you nab your daughter-in-law?

443
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,542
Both of you have gone mad, and
you'll drag me to the crazy town too!

444
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,542
Why? Didn't you kidnap me as well?

445
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,875
What do you want?

446
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,000
That I should go and kidnap her myself?

447
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,667
When did I ask you to go?

448
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,792
Then who will go get her?

449
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,458
There you go, your pet's here.

450
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,083
Right?

451
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,125
-Right?
-Right!

452
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,208
What?

453
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:15,292
No, Mr. Butt. I can't do this
and you know it.

454
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:18,792
Dad, I can't get married and you know it.

455
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:22,667
Why not? This isn't the
first time you're nabbing someone.

456
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,500
You just nabbed the sweetmeat, right?

457
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:25,667
Right.

458
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,167
Mr. Butt...

459
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,958
there's a difference between
a girl and a sweetmeat.

460
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,958
I've never nabbed a girl,
neither do I intend on it.

461
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,500
We're not kidnapping her.
We're just bringing her home.

462
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,708
-Right?
-Right.

463
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,292
Your mother and I believe that
you won't find a better guy than him.

464
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,917
Oh, dear boy, she's our daughter.

465
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:48,917
What!

466
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,708
My boy, just worry about the money.

467
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,042
I give you five lakh rupees.

468
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,833
You will get all your
wishes fulfilled in one go!

469
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,000
Think about it.

470
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,458
That means money's
everything for you, right?

471
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,458
You are my daughter.

472
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,125
I know what's good,
and what's bad for you.

473
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:09,750
And I've already said yes.

474
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,208
Now, it's a matter
of our family's reputation.

475
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:16,333
Teefa, our munchkin's
reputation is on the line!

476
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,625
-Right.
-Mr. Butt, five lakh...

477
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,875
Five lakh rupees
is a bit less for this job.

478
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,042
I'd have to think about it.

479
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,542
Teefa, we don't have time to think.

480
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,875
Alright, take ten lakhs and
let's get it done with.

481
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:42,583
How foolish of me, that I couldn't see
what you're trying to do for me.

482
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,875
But I see it now, Dad.

483
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:57,917
My boy, you always know your
ways around our hearts!

484
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,625
Call Tony right now.

485
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,917
Confirm the six o'clock flight for
the day after tomorrow.

486
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,875
My boy's flying off to Europe!

487
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,167
Why don't you believe me,
you bloody idiot!

488
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:44,125
You know, desperate times,
call for desperate measures.

489
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,583
What!

490
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,500
You can speak Urdu?

491
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,250
You're from Pakistan?

492
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,708
Okay, I am sort of stuck in
the middle of something.

493
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,125
I'll call you back once I am free,
you moron!

494
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:03,667
Oh, my God!

495
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,042
Do you speak French?
Or, do you speak Polish?

496
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,083
Can you speak Urdu?

497
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,042
Oh, so you don't talk much.

498
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,625
Good! You won't yap all
the time after we get married.

499
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,167
Hot as in, piping hot.

500
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,583
Some piping hot Tony
and the realization

501
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,000
that you left Pakistan, but you
are still rocking that pervert.

502
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,292
How's my brother doing?

503
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,958
-I was good until you arrived.
-Well, I had to.

504
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,375
Man, I am really hungry.

505
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,750
They only served dates on the flight.

506
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,958
Come, I'll treat you to some refreshingly
plain Polish air.

507
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,500
Okay, let's go.

508
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,792
Do you get to drink here?

509
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:04,875
Of course!
But you got to buy the drink first.

510
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:26,667
One second. All that's fine,
but Billu Butt...

511
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:27,958
wants to marry Anya?

512
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,125
Yes.

513
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,958
Wait, riddle me this.

514
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:40,042
What do you think will first enter the
room on his wedding night?

515
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,042
Billu or his belly?

516
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,333
Billu's belly!

517
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:51,250
Listen.

518
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,667
Tell me, what's the plan?

519
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,125
The plan is...

520
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,167
The plan is so good that you'll
remember it for the rest of your life.

521
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:00,292
Listen carefully.

522
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,417
-Bonzo lives...
-Thank you.

523
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,167
Mention not.
Bonzo lives in a mansion.

524
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,125
Which is patrolled by
guards from all sides.

525
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:09,917
Rigged with lasers,
and guarded by blood hounds.

526
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,250
And Anya lives inside of that mansion.

527
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,542
Anyone who's ever tried to
trespass there, has never returned alive.

528
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,083
-And neither will you.
-What are you saying!

529
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,375
I mean, how will you return without
even stepping inside, Sherlock!

530
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,958
-I don't get it.
-It means, you're not gonna step in.

531
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,167
She'll step out.

532
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,292
Every day, sharp at 11:00 a.m.,

533
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,625
Anya goes to the gym
accompanied by her guards.

534
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,958
The guards wait outside.

535
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:39,375
And at 11:05, Anya begins
her warm-up routine.

536
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:43,000
And you'll be there posing as her trainer.

537
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,125
Tony, can't we do something
about the outfit?

538
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,083
No!

539
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,083
As soon as the warm-up finishes,

540
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,250
you'll make her do
her first set of squats.

541
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,000
Tony, what are you thinking?

542
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,500
How many of these do we have to do?

543
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:07,958
Tony!

544
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,083
-Tony!
-Yes?

545
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,458
Tony?

546
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,000
Oh, yes!

547
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,583
After the squats,
you're going to spike her water.

548
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,667
-Is this the sedative?
-No, this is just for the demo.

549
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:20,833
And as soon as she drinks
the water, she'll faint.

550
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,000
And fall right into your arms.

551
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,208
-You don't say?
-But I do.

552
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,542
And then Tony will enter.

553
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,292
Then I'll start the fire alarm.

554
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,792
Which will cause chaos at the gym.

555
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,917
Taking advantage of this situation,
you'll quickly wheel Anya out of the gym

556
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,333
from the back door,
into the alley.

557
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:47,208
And your brother will be waiting right
outside with your fake travel documents.

558
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,167
-My brother?
-Me, I am your brother.

559
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,917
And with those fake documents you'll
land straight in Lahore!

560
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,167
No way!

561
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,042
-Damn right!
-Tony, you're not human!

562
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,958
You're a treasure!

563
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,917
I feel like burying you into
the pits of the earth!

564
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,833
I'm taking you to the skies and
you're dragging me into the dirt?

565
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,792
I'm just kidding!
Don't mind me.

566
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,292
Alright, next round's on me!

567
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,875
Lucy, two pints,
and bill this gentlemen right here.

568
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:34,417
Tony, do you know the difference
between desis and the white folk?

569
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,542
Desis can't handle their alcohol!

570
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,792
I am dying! God forgive me!

571
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:55,167
Tony, we've handled it just fine!

572
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:11,000
Tony, why don't they ban
alcohol here as well?

573
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,750
-That's what I miss about our country.
-What? The alcohol?

574
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,792
-No, the ban.
-Oh damn!

575
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,708
-Yeah, man!
-Tony?

576
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,542
I think the class has ended.

577
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,375
All the girls are out
but she's not here.

578
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,458
What if her parents
banned her from the gym?

579
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,625
Now you're getting me worried.

580
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,708
Don't worry, I'll just check on it.

581
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:37,167
Tony?
Yes?

582
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,750
-So?
-So!

583
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,458
I just solved our girl's mystery!

584
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:00,708
Why isn't she here?

585
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,125
She's getting married today!

586
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,042
What the hell are you saying?
She's getting married today!

587
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,708
What's so shocking about it?

588
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,917
I mean if you were getting married,
would you have come to the gym?

589
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,500
Do you have any idea
what you're saying!

590
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:15,250
What now?

591
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,917
She'll get married, go for
a honeymoon, maybe have a son--

592
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,208
Son of a bitch!

593
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:21,792
Why would she have a son of a bitch?

594
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,167
She'll have a human child!

595
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,917
Tony, your plan crashed
before it took off!

596
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,833
Screw you, man!

597
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,917
It happens, Teefa.
You don't have to spit at me.

598
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,458
There goes my ten lakh rupees!

599
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,042
What will I tell Mr. Butt?

600
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:47,917
Teefa, you're worrying as
if she was your Juliet!

601
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:00,250
-Hello, Teefa!
-Waist, 28 inches.

602
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:03,708
Ankle, 12.

603
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,833
Salaam, Mr. Butt.

604
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:09,958
Everything's under control.

605
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,458
Except for this tiny problem...

606
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,917
that nothing's under control.

607
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,458
What?

608
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,500
The girl's getting married today,

609
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,000
and we were just here
to nab her from her gym,

610
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,750
but she didn't show up.
Tony just told me.

611
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,833
but if you want we can drop
off some flowers at her place.

612
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:29,333
<i>I thought, it'll look good
on your side as you're old friends.</i>

613
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,958
<i>Maybe I can drop off
some red or white roses.</i>

614
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:38,042
Teefa, go there right now
and get her here!

615
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,583
This marriage is impossible!

616
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,375
-Dad!
-Fatso, I'm not talking to you!

617
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,833
Never knew your dad also gets fits.

618
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:51,542
Teefa, listen to me very carefully.

619
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,875
Till now you've only seen my kindness.

620
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,542
Not my wrath.

621
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:05,583
If you don't bring my daughter here,
I will...

622
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:10,083
<i>And this is for all the
special mothers out there!</i>

623
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,000
Is everything okay?

624
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,958
Don't worry...

625
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:34,958
Good news is, that I can't go
inside, because everyone knows me here.

626
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:38,958
And the bad news is, you can't go inside,
because nobody knows you!

627
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:40,792
So do you, Tony.

628
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,542
Your brother has learned from 007 himself.

629
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,500
There was your plan, now here's mine.

630
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:56,375
Clear.

631
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,583
Excuse me, brother.

632
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,750
I wanted to say, what a nice jacket!

633
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,292
A few hours from now,

634
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:56,958
our partnership will
transform into a life partnership.

635
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,042
What are you serving?

636
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:16,292
Sir, there's some bread, eggs,
and also some strawberry.

637
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,750
How do I look?

638
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:44,208
Wow!

639
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,292
If your mom were alive, she--

640
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:57,917
Oh, Dad! So what if she's not here?
At least you are.

641
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,667
But, even you won't be around anymore.

642
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:11,917
Don't say such things.

643
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,708
I am wherever you are.

644
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,458
Hello, Sara. He's here.

645
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,667
Where were you?

646
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,292
-In the closet?
-What were you doing in there?

647
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,917
We are already late, hurry up!

648
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,208
What's the plan?

649
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:34,917
Yes, the plan!

650
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,833
The plan you're here for!

651
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,208
What am I here for?

652
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,167
So do I have to
tell you everything now?

653
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,917
So, you wanna stage a kidnapping?

654
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:53,625
Go ahead! Put me to sleep! Quick!

655
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,667
There's no time!

656
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:01,167
Even brides aren't this shy.
Looks like I have to do everything.

657
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,417
You wanna know something funny?

658
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:13,958
Whenever this happens in films,
people just faint right away.

659
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:16,583
But in real life...

660
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,417
Anya?

661
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,750
Anya?

662
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,292
You?

663
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,000
Who are you?

664
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,125
Me?

665
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:44,083
You need something ironed?
A <i>salwar,</i> shawl, or a shirt?

666
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,917
Where is Anya?

667
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:50,833
Anya? I think... ma'am was right here.

668
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:52,833
Must've gone outside.
She's getting married, you know.

669
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:01,292
You...

670
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,250
You...

671
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,042
You! You haven't ironed
the clothes yet?

672
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,625
Come on, hurry up, boy!

673
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,583
What did you think?

674
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:05,583
That you'd get away with it?

675
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,958
Show me what you're hiding.

676
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,375
What are you looking at?

677
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,750
Take out that bottle.

678
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,208
Fix me a drink and don't
tell the missus about it.

679
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:16,542
Sure, sir.

680
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,500
Get in.

681
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:36,500
What are you staring at?

682
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,208
-Go away.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,292
-Bonzo!
-It's for you!

684
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:44,917
You're concerned about the drink?

685
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,667
Anya is not in her room.

686
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,208
She must be here somewhere!

687
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:49,583
I've looked everywhere!

688
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,875
Anya!

689
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,500
Anya!

690
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:04,625
Anya!

691
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,125
What the hell are you doing?

692
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,458
Zoom in!

693
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:27,125
Then what are you looking at?

694
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:56,875
Tony, hurry up!

695
00:53:58,042 --> 00:53:59,667
Hurry up!

696
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:05,667
Hurry up!

697
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:08,250
Wait, Teefa! I'm right here!

698
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,208
One second.
Let me in.

699
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:17,875
Why aren't you driving?
Hurry, you're going to get us killed.

700
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:31,917
Get them!

701
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,583
We've kidnapped Bonzo's daughter!

702
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:43,042
We kidnapped Bonzo's daughter?

703
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,042
We kidnapped Bonzo's daughter!

704
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:46,458
Take it easy, Tony!

705
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,833
She was all ready to be kidnapped!

706
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:51,000
-Does Bonzo know about this?
-I don't think so.

707
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,667
Tony, they're coming!

708
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,833
Wake me up if we survive!

709
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:20,417
This doesn't seem like heaven or hell.
So I guess we're alive?

710
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,167
Hell, yeah! All thanks
to your brother right here!

711
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,583
You wannabe James bond!
You think you saved us?

712
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,167
Instead, you've put us in jeopardy!

713
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,208
Bonzo knows about us,
we're dead meat now.

714
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,917
Charlie Chaplin!
Tony, where are you going?

715
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:38,083
Finding a bush to lighten myself.

716
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,292
And what about the dead-weight
in the van?

717
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,292
That dead-weight was your plan.
Now deal with it.

718
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,167
It was her own plan,
you're not getting it.

719
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,958
She was already prepared to be kidnapped!

720
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,542
-I think she's crazy!
-Crazy?

721
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,917
-Yes! Crazy!
-Crazy?

722
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,875
Yeah, she looks like a do...

723
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,958
<i>Do, re, mi, fa, so...</i>

724
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,333
You're up?

725
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:58,500
-So, you think I'm crazy?
-He does.

726
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:00,500
Why would I say that?

727
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,083
-But you're absolutely right!
-What?

728
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,292
I am crazy!

729
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,708
But you both aren't too far behind!

730
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,042
What timing, my brother!

731
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,333
Don't bro-zone me.

732
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:12,042
Well, I have to give it to you and Sara.

733
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,458
But I have to ask,
who came up with the red handkerchief?

734
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:15,833
Red handkerchief?

735
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:26,583
Dad must be thinking
that I've been kidnapped.

736
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:30,000
-And by the time my trip ends...
-Do you get any of this?

737
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,250
the groom's family
will call off the marriage!

738
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:39,042
Wait, here's your payment.

739
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,042
-So I'll be off now?
-Okay.

740
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,292
Oh, wrong way!

741
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,125
Oh, man!

742
00:56:54,417 --> 00:56:56,083
She thinks we're the dream dealers.

743
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,333
Who the hell are they?

744
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,708
-You don't know who dream dealers are!
-No! Do you?

745
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,000
-Let's Google them.
-Quick!

746
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,083
Did you find out?

747
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:07,625
No, I was poking Lubna on Facebook.

748
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:09,542
She blocked me!

749
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,042
-She's gone!
-Yeah.

750
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,333
Anya's gone!

751
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,458
Man, why do these girls
keep getting away from us!

752
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,417
Well, it ain't like that, son.

753
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,667
Some find their way back to us.
Check that out.

754
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,583
I think she's coming to embrace me.

755
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:35,792
Not an embrace!
It's a bloody chase, Tony!

756
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,083
Run!

757
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:43,917
Run!

758
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,042
Don't go there!

759
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,500
What are you doing?
You'll get us killed! Run!

760
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,708
-Where do we go?
-I'll take the high road,

761
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:19,375
-you go for the shortcut!
-Okay!

762
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,708
Today I got to know what true love is.

763
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:45,333
Hot stuff!

764
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,667
We lost them.

765
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,417
No, it's our job.

766
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,167
You wanna run away? We'll keep you safe!

767
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:05,125
I'll be on my way.
Tony, shall we?

768
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:06,958
What are you doing?
Why are we letting the girl go?

769
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:09,125
Don't worry, I've understood everything.

770
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,250
Just count to three.

771
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:15,042
She'll come to us.
Just count to three.

772
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,750
One, two...

773
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:21,875
Yes?

774
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:23,792
How about a cup of coffee?

775
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,500
Did you find her?

776
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,375
Sir, there's a twist in the story.

777
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:34,250
She wasn't kidnapped, she ran away!

778
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,292
She's a smart girl, you know.

779
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,333
Tony, what kind of a girl is she?

780
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:03,083
I think the one behind her is prettier.

781
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:05,083
-I'm talking about the one with us.
-Her?

782
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,875
She ran away on the day of her wedding?

783
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:08,750
This happens in Europe as well?

784
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:11,875
You can take a desi out to their country,
but not the desi out of them!

785
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:14,375
I may be the only guy
who's European inside out!

786
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:15,583
I thought so!

787
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:17,792
Thank you.

788
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,542
I know what you guys must be thinking.

789
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,958
What sort of a girl am I to run
away on the day of my wedding.

790
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:26,958
Yes!

791
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:29,833
Not at all.
Why would we judge you?

792
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,167
But what sort of a girl are you?

793
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:32,917
What do you think?

794
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,667
The coffee's very hot.

795
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:39,875
We were thinking, what might
have pushed you to take such an action.

796
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,167
Obviously, something forced you.

797
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,708
I have an offer for the both of you.

798
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:48,625
Tell me the offer.

799
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,458
If the both of you escort me
to the Śniardwy Lake,

800
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,875
and deal with my father's minions
that may show up along the way,

801
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,750
which, I'm sure you will,

802
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:03,292
I will pay you guys
five thousand zlotys.

803
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:09,875
Look, handling your dad
and his minions

804
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,583
looks like a lot of work, we...

805
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:14,542
I don't know...
What do you say, boss?

806
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:15,875
-Boss?
-Boss!

807
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,833
Look, this seems like
a complicated situation.

808
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:20,792
But, boss, you said it yourself,

809
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:24,167
that it's the company's
policy to help those in dire need.

810
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,083
Policy, yes!

811
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,125
There's something called
policies in companies!

812
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,375
So should I consider this deal done?

813
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:31,083
Yes, let's shake on it!

814
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,458
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

815
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,125
Wait a second.
Not like this.

816
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:42,875
Then how?

817
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,125
Like this?

818
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:46,875
We were here to pick up a girl,
not laundry.

819
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:50,375
You worry about the clothes,
I'll get the girl.

820
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,667
She'll come to us, on her own!

821
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:07,542
<i>He stole a piece of my heart
That Jackie-Chan Fan!</i>

822
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:12,083
<i>A bit white, and a tad tan

<i>I ain't going to stage a romance
Go try your luck elsewhere</i>

826
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:37,917

827
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:42,250
<i>If you don't shake that waist
And dance like no one's watching</i>

828
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:46,375

829
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,625

01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:35,708
-No, I was just...
-I didn't tell you to stop.

868
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:38,250
You can look all you want,
but also look ahead.

869
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:49,833
My dad's friend!

870
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:52,542
He must've told him everything!
He's here to get me!

871
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:56,083
Then... she cannot be here!

872
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:57,917
Really? Then where should I be?

873
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:10,917
You have to stay absolutely quiet.

874
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,333
And if they ask a question,
just say <i>"Jinkoya."</i>

875
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,375
-Is that how you scare the demons here?
-It means thank you!

876
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,583
Tony, do you have your license?

877
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:33,792
-I don't know.
-What do you mean?

878
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,917
I don't have one.

879
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,083
You never got one made? Why?

880
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:38,292
My picture didn't come out nice.

881
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,292
Seriously? Are you kidding me?

882
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,667
Does this look like a time to be joking?

883
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:43,875
What do we do now?

884
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:46,958
-Give them your license!
-You!

885
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:48,875
<i>Jinkoya!</i>

886
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,542
License, gone!

887
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,875
-We're dead.
-Damn you!

888
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:04,375
-Stand close.
-You're such an idiot!

889
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:07,542
He's going towards the trunk!
What do we do?

890
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,833
You have any spare change to bribe them?

891
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,333
-Get him!
-Tony!

892
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:25,833
Go on, get him!

893
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:27,250
Stop them!

894
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,667
Go after him!

895
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,458
Tony!

896
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:35,500
Anya?

897
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:17,750
Get in the car!

898
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:48,500
You?

899
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:54,708
Anya?

900
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,750
Anya!
Hey, get them!

901
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,208
What the hell are you doing?

902
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,667
Sit quietly!

903
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:16,708
What are you doing?

904
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:21,792
Watch out!

905
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,958
Listen!

906
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,792
Sit quietly, will you?

907
01:10:28,875 --> 01:10:30,500
Sure, I'd be more
comfortable with a mattress.

908
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:40,208
Are you the Ghost Rider or what?

909
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,958
Watch out!

910
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,500
I've never come across a girl like you!

911
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:01,958
Dear God, save me! Watch out!

912
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:03,667
-Aren't you scared?
-Shut the hell up!

913
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:08,625
Watch out for the turn!

914
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,667
Have you lost it?

915
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:14,875
-They're gone.
-How did they escape?

916
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,792
-Slowly...
-You'll get us killed.

917
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:27,500
-Where are you going?
-Come on.

918
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,500
-What?
-Wait

919
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:32,583
-What are you doing?
-No!

920
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:34,833
Are you crazy? It's someone's truck,
not your damn boudoir!

921
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:35,833
Shut up!

922
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,167
-What's this?
-Shut up and put your hand here.

923
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,875
No! Are you crazy!

924
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:46,500
No! Chopping off my hand
won't give you anything.

925
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:49,458
Wait! How about a test first?

926
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,208
-With this?
-Yes, let's test your aim.

927
01:12:53,292 --> 01:12:54,125
Wait.

928
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,500
I...
I think...

929
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,833
there is no talent.

930
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:04,917
Oh damn!

931
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,708
-Okay.
-Let's not do this.

932
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:10,667
Wait a second.

933
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:13,500
-Found it!
-What is this?

934
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:14,958
A hairpin, idiot!
Sit down.

935
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,000
-Hairpin?
-Yeah.

936
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:18,250
-How does this work?
-You ask a lot of questions.

937
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,583
Oh man!

938
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:26,875
Aren't you a Houdini!

939
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,667
What other tricks do
you have up your sleeve?

940
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,875
-Plenty! Come on!
-Aren't you something!

941
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:10,042
Listen, I don't see
many <i>Chillarhs</i> around here?

942
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:10,958
<i>Chillarh?</i>

943
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:13,125
<i>Chillarh</i> as in,
the police, you know.

944
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,542
In Lahore, we call the cops <i>"Chillarh."</i>

945
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:18,375
-You're from Lahore?
-Yeah.

946
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:20,500
Don't Lahoris do the bhangra?

947
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:22,875
Such stereotyping!

948
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,792
Are Lahoris supposed to
do bhangra all the time?

949
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,000
No, sir.

950
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,083
So, technically that
makes me a Lahori too.

951
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:31,750
-So your dad's from Lahore?
-Yes.

952
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:34,000
-Did you ever get to visit?
-Well, we did plan to.

953
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:34,917
Then?

954
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:38,208
As usual, Sophie ruined everything.

955
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,000
What about your real mom?

956
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:46,625
I was eight when she
passed away in an accident.

957
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:51,042
And it took dad eight days
to get married again.

958
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,458
What are you thinking about? Such is life!

959
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:04,292
I was thinking that the number
eight, sure is bad luck for you!

960
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,500
Are you a numerologist?

961
01:15:09,042 --> 01:15:10,875
I'm guessing you
must know how to read palms?

962
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,875
Palms? Give me your feet
and I'll tell you your fortune!

963
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,708
Alright, here you go.
What does my future hold?

964
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:26,792
Well, your wish to go to Lahore
might come true sooner than you think.

965
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:29,250
Really? When?

966
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,292
In about eight days!

967
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,125
Now you're just pulling my leg!

968
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:38,125
-Listen.
-Yes?

969
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:41,375
Can we find a place that serves curry?
I'm very hungry!

970
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,042
So you wanna have some desi food?

971
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:46,208
After having all those burgers,
I am missing Islamabad.

972
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,917
Alright, I'll get you
some desi food! Wait.

973
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:52,792
Let me check.

974
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:54,708
My wallet!

975
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,042
Where is it?

976
01:15:58,542 --> 01:15:59,917
-Tony!
-Tony?

977
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:02,583
Bro, I have no idea where they are!

978
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,875
Are you from Chakwal in Pakistan?
Because I am also--

979
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,292
Wait a minute!

980
01:16:09,917 --> 01:16:10,792
Alright, go for it.

981
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,792
What kind of a boss is he?

982
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,500
Someone who just deserts
you in a time like this?

983
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:24,958
How would I have known?

984
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:31,792
-You wanna eat, right?
-Yes!

985
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:35,042
-Let's go!
-Where?

986
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:37,917
Money?

987
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,208
You don't need money for everything.

988
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:49,250
-That's what all the rich people say.
-What?

989
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:51,417
That you don't need money for everything.

990
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,625
-Is that so?
-Yes.

991
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,375
We'll see.

992
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,083
What are you?

993
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,583
We ate the dessert
but the white guy had to pay for it!

994
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:17,042
-Let's go!
-Where?

995
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:22,167
Don't open your eyes until I say so.

996
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,583
Where are you taking me?
Don't push me, okay?

997
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:26,375
What is this place?

998
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,500
Open your eyes.

999
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,583
If you are fortunate enough to
see 11:11 on the clock, it means

1000
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:44,000
that the universe is
sending you a message.

1001
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,167
That no matter what,

1002
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:50,042
you don't need to fear anything,
you're on the right path.

1003
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,417
No matter how difficult the times are,

1004
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:56,583
one day you will find the
true calling of your destiny.

1005
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:15,250
So, Mr. Teefa, tell me something.
How much for an experience like this?

1006
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:31,167
Can I ask you something?

1007
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:33,542
You dad has given you everything.

1008
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:36,833
Then why are you running away from it?

1009
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,583
Yes, he did give me everything...

1010
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,875
except for what I really wanted.

1011
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,667
-What did you want?
-An assurance.

1012
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:50,958
That perhaps I am the most
important thing to him in this world.

1013
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:54,333
Not his business or his money.

1014
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,958
And sometimes, I need a hug.

1015
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,583
A cuddle.

1016
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:10,542
Oh, cuddles are always nice.

1017
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,583
Sometimes, it gets
very cold around here.

1018
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:46,792
You were right, it is cold here.

1019
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:22,500
Don't you "hello" me!

1020
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,625
I've been trying to
reach you for so long!

1021
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,875
Where the hell are you idiots!

1022
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,750
Is the job done yet?

1023
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,500
It's done, Mr. Butt.

1024
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:36,417
Anya's with me.

1025
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,375
Oh, Teefa!

1026
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:42,875
Very good! When are you coming?

1027
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,125
Soon!

1028
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:47,625
Hurry up, Teefa! Very good! Well-done!

1029
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:51,083
That's my boy!

1030
01:21:13,042 --> 01:21:14,083
Are you married?

1031
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,125
Do you have kids?

1032
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:24,583
I have a daughter.

1033
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,042
And I'd do anything for her.

1034
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:30,625
<i>What the hell is he on about?</i>

1035
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,583
<i>How do I get out of here?</i>

1036
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,958
<i>If I jump out of this window,
I'll break my eggs.</i>

1037
01:21:36,042 --> 01:21:39,875
<i>Because there's a truck down there,
not of eggs but some damn rods.</i>

1038
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:49,917
<i>Well, I guess I'll just listen to him.</i>

1039
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:51,375
Do you get it?

1040
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:54,542
Now tell me.

1041
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:55,875
What?

1042
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:00,042
Where is my daughter?

1043
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:03,667
I don't know, I swear!
I never lie!

1044
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:07,583
Every child in Poland knows
that Tony never lies!

1045
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:10,792
I'm telling you the truth!
I don't know where they are!

1046
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:14,667
Lee, shut off your phone.

1047
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,792
Sir, that's not my phone.

1048
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,208
Teefa!

1049
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:32,333
Don't try to act smart

1050
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:34,667
Tell him to stay where he is,

1051
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,583
and that you'll be there
in fifteen minutes.

1052
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,958
<i>-Tony, you son of a--</i>
-Teefa, listen to me! Where are you?

1053
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:45,042
<i>I'm on the roof right next
to the clock tower at Town Square!</i>

1054
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,167
Alright, stay right there!

1055
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,292
I'll be there in fifteen minutes!
Don't move, okay?

1056
01:22:48,375 --> 01:22:50,583
<i>Yeah, okay.
If you disappear this time, I'll--</i>

1057
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,125
Is that fine?

1058
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,458
Take him along.

1059
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:58,667
Yes, take me along.
I'll only get bored!

1060
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,458
We'll catch that son of a bitch together!
Easy on the hand!

1061
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:17,792
There you go, some hot tea.

1062
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:23,458
How do you know that I'd want
some tea when I wake up?

1063
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,333
-You like tea?
-Yeah.

1064
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:29,667
Oh man, wait till you
try the tea my mother makes.

1065
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:31,917
If you're ever in Lahore,
I'll treat you to some!

1066
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:35,167
You live in Lahore?

1067
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:37,958
-Yes.
-I thought you might've moved here.

1068
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:39,583
Why would I move here?

1069
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:44,042
You know, once you've lived in Lahore,
you can't live anywhere else.

1070
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,458
Tony just calls me here
for pulling some jobs.

1071
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:49,583
Once I am done, I go back.

1072
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,583
Oh, that reminds me! We found Tony!

1073
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,125
He's almost here!

1074
01:23:57,083 --> 01:24:00,875
Then you can go off to your friend,
and I'll be off to Lahore to my ma.

1075
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:02,833
-Shall we go?
-To Lahore?

1076
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:04,708
Downstairs.

1077
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:27,583
Run!

1078
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:34,458
We're safe!

1079
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,000
Anya!

1080
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:38,583
Anya!

1081
01:25:43,292 --> 01:25:46,250
Tony you ruined everything!

1082
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:47,875
I am the one fixing it, aren't I?

1083
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,542
Don't fight, guys! Let it be.
Shall we go?

1084
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:53,958
Go where? The truck's busted.
How will we get anywhere?

1085
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:05,417
Tony, translation please.

1086
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,250
Translation, please.

1087
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,667
Sometimes the journey is
more important than the destination.

1088
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:18,583
Well, well...

1089
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,375
The girl's kinda saucy, Tony!

1090
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,375
I know what you're thinking.

1091
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:28,667
But what you're thinking
can never happen.

1092
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:30,875
Then let me enjoy thinking about it.

1093
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:47,125
<i>Oh, my dear
Listen to my heart</i>

1094
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:52,750
<i>My beloved, you're the only one for me</i>

1095
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:58,333
<i>Oh, my dear
Listen to my heart</i>

1096
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:03,667
<i>My beloved, you're the only one for me</i>

1097
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:06,667
<i>I'll guard my heart till it's yours</i>

1098
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,458
<i>I'll write every song for you</i>

1099
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:12,250
<i>My nights will long for your embrace</i>

1100
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,958
<i>Just hear me out, my love</i>

1101
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:17,833
<i>I'm an artist, just for you</i>

1102
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:20,667
<i>I'm intoxicated for you</i>

1103
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,458
<i>I've fallen in love with you</i>

1104
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:26,292
<i>Just say yes!</i>

1105
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:31,958
<i>Oh, my dear
Listen to my heart</i>

1106
01:27:32,292 --> 01:27:37,667
<i>My beloved, you're the only one for me</i>

1107
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:43,083
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1108
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:48,375
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1109
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:06,208
<i>I've come just for you
Take care of my heart</i>

1110
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:11,750
<i>Take me wherever you go
I won't ask for anything more</i>

1111
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:17,333
<i>Seems as if I've known you for years</i>

1112
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:21,833
<i>Catch me in your arms if I ever fall</i>

1113
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:24,667
<i>I'll always be with you</i>

1114
01:28:24,917 --> 01:28:27,583
<i>I won't even dare talk to anyone else</i>

1115
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:30,292
<i>My life is only yours</i>

1116
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:33,333
<i>You're my only one</i>

1117
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:38,917
<i>Oh, my dear
Listen to my heart</i>

1118
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:44,500
<i>My beloved, you're the only one for me</i>

1119
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:49,917
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1120
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:55,208
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1121
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:13,375
<i>How do I kill away the nights
As I miserably long for you</i>

1122
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:18,458
<i>Without you,
My heart and soul can't ever sing</i>

1123
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:24,333
<i>Your love is what makes me worthy
It shines like the stars</i>

1124
01:29:24,667 --> 01:29:28,958
<i>Just embrace me in your arms</i>

1125
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:31,583
<i>We live only once</i>

1126
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,500
<i>So let's fall in love</i>

1127
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:37,292
<i>Enjoy this moment for me</i>

1128
01:29:37,417 --> 01:29:40,375
<i>As you reside in my heart and soul</i>

1129
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:45,875
<i>Oh, my dear
Listen to my heart</i>

1130
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:51,500
<i>My beloved, you're the only one for me</i>

1131
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:56,958
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1132
01:29:57,208 --> 01:30:02,292
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

1133
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,792
-And we're here!
-Wow!

1134
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:18,583
Can you ask Mr. Boris Becker
to open the door for us?

1135
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:21,417
-Hurry!
-Thank you.

1136
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,208
Sara!

1137
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:29,250
Everything went according to plan?

1138
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,500
-Where are those dream dealers?
-Behind you.

1139
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,417
This means my connections
were right all along.

1140
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,833
This looks good.

1141
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,792
Teefa.

1142
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,250
Tony.
"Tony.Shah."

1143
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:42,417
-I am Sara.
-You're not Sara.

1144
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,833
You're my Senorita.

1145
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:50,417
Translation, please.

1146
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,500
If she laughs, she digs you.

1147
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:55,208
Sara, if it weren't for these two...

1148
01:30:55,292 --> 01:31:00,167
I mean, if it wasn't for him,
I would have never gotten here.

1149
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:02,625
I was just doing my job.

1150
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:05,667
I'm glad she's reached safely.
That's all I want.

1151
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:07,542
Tony, shall we?

1152
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,000
Tony, let's go!

1153
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:13,917
-What are you doing?
-Just keep looking!

1154
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,292
How about a cup of coffee?

1155
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:21,292
How about some <i>Lassi?</i>

1156
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:23,375
<i>Lassi?</i>

1157
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,458
Seems like these white folks
have their lives figured out.

1158
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:32,917
Anya!

1159
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,333
Andy's coming and
he looks hot as hell!

1160
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:56,500
Latifah? Is he mocking me?
I'll smash his head!

1161
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:58,000
No, he's only joking!

1162
01:32:09,917 --> 01:32:11,875
Thank God you got her here
all safe and sound.

1163
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:14,750
You know, I've never seen her so happy.

1164
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,958
She's dying to be with him.

1165
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,375
But she never lets it show.
Idiot!

1166
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:21,167
Shall we?

1167
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:24,125
Having fun?

1168
01:32:24,792 --> 01:32:26,500
You seem a bit down, man.

1169
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:34,583
Check out that white dude,
tight as a drum!

1170
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:37,833
And you, Teefa?
Mr. Loose Lace!

1171
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:40,792
Do something.
Pull something out of your hat.

1172
01:34:55,917 --> 01:35:01,500
<i>My love, your path is far from me</i>

1173
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:06,708
<i>And my arms long for you</i>

1174
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:09,375
<i>You reside within my heart and soul</i>

1175
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,958
<i>Why won't you say something?</i>

1176
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:16,792
<i>Breathe life into me,
So I can breathe</i>

1177
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:22,500
<i>I stand helpless</i>

1178
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:27,917
<i>Your soul is where I reside</i>

1179
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,583
<i>I can't bear anything else</i>

1180
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:33,667
<i>I can't live without you now</i>

1181
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:38,250
<i>Take me into the realm of your love</i>

1182
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:05,833
<i>We'll be sitting by the river</i>

1183
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:11,000
<i>Oblivious of this world,
Lost in our own</i>

1184
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:16,458
<i>I've come just for you</i>

1185
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:20,792
<i>You are in me, I am in you</i>

1186
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:26,000
<i>Like a moon and a star</i>

1187
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:31,125
<i>Is how we belong together</i>

1188
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:36,667
<i>As I sleep in your arms
And tell you I'm yours</i>

1189
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:41,875
<i>May love embrace us for life</i>

1190
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:47,208
<i>I will devote myself to your name</i>

1191
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:52,500
<i>Keep my heart safe</i>

1192
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:55,125
<i>I can lose everything in this world</i>

1193
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:58,500
<i>But as long as I have you,
I'll be complete</i>

1194
01:36:58,583 --> 01:37:03,250
<i>That's all I would ever wish for</i>

1195
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:29,000
<i>In the dark of the night</i>

1196
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:33,458
<i>I miss you</i>

1197
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:42,250
<i>My heart can't bear it</i>

1198
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:06,750
Teefa!

1199
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:08,625
Falling in love, are you?

1200
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,042
This is where they all fall.

1201
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:22,167
You lose your heart,
and you lose your mind.

1202
01:38:23,375 --> 01:38:25,875
Come on, boy.
Enough.

1203
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:30,292
Hurry up, hand over the girl

1204
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:35,667
and get done with this mess.

1205
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,250
Alright? Come on!

1206
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:39,875
Don't listen to him, Teefa.

1207
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,375
Money isn't everything.

1208
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,583
The real power lies in love.

1209
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:46,875
Love?

1210
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:51,292
The whole world falls in love,
gets married,

1211
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,625
and then they cry with clenched fists!

1212
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:56,792
Love? Love is only for the fortunate.

1213
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:58,833
To hell with love!

1214
01:38:58,917 --> 01:39:00,292
Listen up, everyone.

1215
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:02,458
We can bicker all we
want about love and money,

1216
01:39:02,542 --> 01:39:05,125
but can we order something to eat?
I'm hungry.

1217
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:08,708
I'm scared. This is not right.

1218
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:10,292
Oh, man!

1219
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:14,958
Teefa, everything will be alright,

1220
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:17,708
-if you stick to the plan.
-No!

1221
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:23,083
Teefa, listen to your heart.

1222
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,917
To hell with the heart.
What about this belly, right here?

1223
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,458
You mean the heart?

1224
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:38,042
The heart brings hell on earth!

1225
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:40,875
Teefa, he's getting you into trouble.

1226
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:43,875
That girl is getting you
into trouble, Teefa!

1227
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:46,625
Oh my, God! We're stuck!

1228
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:48,708
Should I order some tikkas?

1229
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:50,583
Hungry?

1230
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:54,083
Looks like we'll have
to make some tikkas after all.

1231
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:58,792
Oh, good Lord!

1232
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:04,167
Bloodshed gets you nowhere.

1233
01:40:04,583 --> 01:40:08,333
But those of us who believe in love
can die for it...

1234
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:09,375
Here we go!

1235
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:11,083
...and also kill for it!

1236
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:15,458
Someone's getting emotional!
This is gonna be fun!

1237
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:20,833
I've been asking you guys what to order!
I'm hungry!

1238
01:40:20,917 --> 01:40:22,208
I told you something bad
was going to happen!

1239
01:40:22,292 --> 01:40:24,167
-What do we do now?
-Wait a minute!

1240
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:26,625
Guys, we're all the same person.

1241
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:30,542
There's no need to fight,
let's just sit and discuss everything.

1242
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:31,458
To hell with that!

1243
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:19,167
Teefa...
What did I tell you?

1244
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:21,833
Love is nothing but bullshit!

1245
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:24,583
It's all about the money, honey.

1246
01:41:24,667 --> 01:41:29,000
Come on, boy.
Get up, get the girl,

1247
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:32,250
and show us what you got.

1248
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:34,750
Come on, now. Wake up!

1249
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:27,500
Who's this?

1250
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:25,583
Beautiful, right?

1251
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:28,208
Yes, very.

1252
01:43:30,667 --> 01:43:32,292
You'll leave all of of this behind?

1253
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:34,042
No.

1254
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,083
It'll stay with me...

1255
01:43:38,042 --> 01:43:39,250
forever.

1256
01:43:44,125 --> 01:43:45,375
I'll miss...

1257
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:48,375
all of this.

1258
01:43:51,667 --> 01:43:53,375
I'll miss it too.

1259
01:43:58,708 --> 01:43:59,917
How's Lahore?

1260
01:44:02,917 --> 01:44:05,958
You see the colors of the skies above us?

1261
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:10,125
Lahore is painted with as many colors.

1262
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,667
I want to see those colors.

1263
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:15,917
-You won't be able to.
-Why?

1264
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,167
Because princesses who
have grown up in palaces...

1265
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:22,542
cannot fathom the pain
of starving children,

1266
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:24,458
lying bare naked on the street.

1267
01:44:25,042 --> 01:44:26,250
Nor can they understand their despair.

1268
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:29,458
I want to understand.

1269
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,833
Yes.

1270
01:44:37,417 --> 01:44:38,792
I was 12...

1271
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:42,875
when my dad passed away.

1272
01:44:44,542 --> 01:44:46,542
Leaving nothing but misery behind for us.

1273
01:44:46,667 --> 01:44:47,833
He said...

1274
01:44:49,083 --> 01:44:50,500
"I'm leaving behind the respect
we've earned."

1275
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,375
Little did he know...

1276
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:58,208
that when you're starving,
you can't feed on respect.

1277
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:00,792
You need bread.

1278
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:04,125
And for that, you need money.

1279
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:07,125
He couldn't understand.

1280
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:10,958
But I understood
the world quite sooner.

1281
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:14,083
Money is everything.

1282
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:19,458
Because those who have money,
have respect.

1283
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,708
Do you get it now?

1284
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:33,417
Anya!

1285
01:45:35,292 --> 01:45:36,708
Let's go!

1286
01:45:44,125 --> 01:45:46,667
-What are you gonna do now?
-I can't go home.

1287
01:45:48,083 --> 01:45:49,500
Then where?

1288
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:53,375
Lahore.

1289
01:45:54,292 --> 01:45:57,083
-Take me to Lahore.
-Are you sure?

1290
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,417
I'm sure.

1291
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:15,667
Where is Anya?

1292
01:46:18,292 --> 01:46:19,375
I don't know.

1293
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:20,792
Check inside!

1294
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:09,167
Wait a minute!

1295
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:12,542
Be gentle!
It's pure leather. Be careful!

1296
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:15,958
Where is Anya?

1297
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:17,917
Listen, we're in a foreign country.

1298
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,833
We don't deal with things like this.

1299
01:47:19,917 --> 01:47:21,875
There's a coffee shop nearby.
How about we have a chat there?

1300
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:24,500
You'll get to have some coffee
and I'll have a chance to talk!

1301
01:49:01,125 --> 01:49:02,792
What's so special about this place?

1302
01:49:17,625 --> 01:49:19,542
It's so peaceful here.

1303
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,500
And so beautiful.

1304
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,500
Life can be so unpredictable.

1305
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:27,917
One moment you're some place...

1306
01:49:29,042 --> 01:49:30,875
and in the next, another.

1307
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:32,750
And that too with you.

1308
01:49:41,167 --> 01:49:42,875
My dear daughter!

1309
01:49:46,625 --> 01:49:48,083
Uncle Butt?

1310
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:52,042
-How did you know that I am here?
-Don't talk nonsense, my dear.

1311
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:55,083
You're in my city.
How could I have not known?

1312
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:56,458
Ain't that right, Teefa?

1313
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,833
Why are you standing
there with that long face?

1314
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,458
Haven't you told her?

1315
01:50:02,542 --> 01:50:05,250
You two, know each other?

1316
01:50:05,417 --> 01:50:06,500
Know each other?

1317
01:50:06,583 --> 01:50:08,833
He's my number one man.

1318
01:50:08,917 --> 01:50:12,333
He takes care of all of my problems.

1319
01:50:12,417 --> 01:50:15,208
He's the one who's brought you here.

1320
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:20,125
Praise be to Allah!

1321
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:25,042
You've grown up to be
a beautiful young woman.

1322
01:50:25,125 --> 01:50:27,833
By the way, you're much
prettier than your photographs.

1323
01:50:27,917 --> 01:50:30,125
-Salaam...
-You bucket head!

1324
01:50:30,208 --> 01:50:32,292
You can save the romancing for later.

1325
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,167
Come on, dear. Let's go home.

1326
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,000
Your aunt is waiting for you.

1327
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:39,333
All the arrangements have been done.

1328
01:50:42,917 --> 01:50:44,375
Teefa...

1329
01:50:44,958 --> 01:50:46,500
what is uncle talking about?

1330
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:50,625
He doesn't say much.
He's more of an "actions" guy.

1331
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:52,208
Ashfaaq!

1332
01:50:52,292 --> 01:50:54,875
Get over here
and give Teefa his reward!

1333
01:50:55,417 --> 01:50:56,833
There you go, Teefa.

1334
01:50:56,917 --> 01:50:59,458
It's all in there. You can count it.

1335
01:50:59,542 --> 01:51:03,625
I've got fresh, new bills for you.

1336
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:07,667
Take it. Why are you being so shy?

1337
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:09,333
It's yours.

1338
01:51:09,792 --> 01:51:11,625
Take it!

1339
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,208
Let's go.

1340
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:36,125
<i>My beloved</i>

1341
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:42,333
<i>Stands before me today</i>

1342
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:49,333
<i>My heart</i>

1343
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:55,125
<i>Has been ripped into pieces</i>

1344
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:59,125
<i>My heart now weeps</i>

1345
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:06,125
<i>Inside of my chest</i>

1346
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:11,000
<i>May no one's beloved</i>

1347
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:16,667
<i>Ever part ways</i>

1348
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:33,000
<i>Don't hide behind the veil, my beloved</i>

1349
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:36,500
<i>My heart and my life now belong to you</i>

1350
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:39,667
<i>Don't hide behind the veil, my beloved</i>

1351
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:43,083
<i>My heart and my life now belong to you</i>

1352
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,458
<i>I don't know what's happening
My heart is sinking</i>

1353
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:06,167
<i>Makes me knock on every door</i>

1354
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:12,708
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1355
01:53:12,792 --> 01:53:19,000
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1356
01:53:19,083 --> 01:53:25,458
<i>I don't know what's happening
My heart is sinking</i>

1357
01:53:25,542 --> 01:53:29,208
<i>Makes me knock on every door</i>

1358
01:53:29,292 --> 01:53:35,750
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1359
01:53:35,917 --> 01:53:42,292
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1360
01:53:55,583 --> 01:53:58,458
<i>Don't hide behind the veil, my beloved</i>

1361
01:53:58,542 --> 01:54:02,250
<i>My heart and my life now belong to you</i>

1362
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:09,083
<i>My beloved is upset
As the sun now sets</i>

1363
01:54:09,417 --> 01:54:15,208
<i>The matters of the heart
Remain confined within</i>

1364
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:22,250
<i>Tears stream down
As the heart trembles</i>

1365
01:54:22,583 --> 01:54:29,000
<i>Oh love, I don't understand you</i>

1366
01:54:29,208 --> 01:54:35,292
<i>One life...</i>

1367
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,667
<i>One life
And a thousand pains</i>

1368
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:51,208
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1369
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:57,583
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1370
01:54:57,667 --> 01:55:04,125
<i>I don't know what's happening
My heart is sinking</i>

1371
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:07,750
<i>Makes me knock on every door</i>

1372
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:14,208
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1373
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:20,792
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1374
01:55:21,042 --> 01:55:27,458
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1375
01:55:27,625 --> 01:55:34,167
<i>I'm swaying to the rhythm of love</i>

1376
01:55:46,458 --> 01:55:49,167
Teefa, you're back?

1377
01:55:49,917 --> 01:55:51,792
Is the job done?

1378
01:55:55,792 --> 01:55:57,083
Ma...

1379
01:55:58,292 --> 01:56:00,458
can you please
honestly answer my question?

1380
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:04,375
What sort of a man was my father?

1381
01:56:04,833 --> 01:56:05,875
Teefa...

1382
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:09,542
why are you
asking me this again?

1383
01:56:10,833 --> 01:56:12,667
Is everything alright?

1384
01:56:15,292 --> 01:56:16,625
Tell me.

1385
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,958
Were you happy with him?

1386
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:20,875
Extremely.

1387
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:25,125
But, he never got anything for you.

1388
01:56:26,542 --> 01:56:32,458
Well, there's not much needed
when there's plenty of love.

1389
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:36,083
But, he could have at
least left something for us, Ma.

1390
01:56:36,708 --> 01:56:39,708
I've seen you washing people's
dishes all my childhood.

1391
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:43,250
How can you say
that he left nothing for us?

1392
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:46,417
Have you seen the kind of respect
I get in the neighborhood?

1393
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:49,625
It's all because of your father.

1394
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:54,625
Son, earning money is very easy.

1395
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:56,125
But earning respect?

1396
01:56:58,625 --> 01:57:03,250
Look, money and people...
all go away someday.

1397
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:07,583
But good deeds live on forever.

1398
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:11,000
And this isn't something
you'll only find in books.

1399
01:57:11,167 --> 01:57:12,083
Ma...

1400
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:19,667
-My dear...
-I've made a mistake.

1401
01:57:20,042 --> 01:57:22,667
Look, Teefa. I am your mother.

1402
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:25,208
I know everything.

1403
01:57:25,667 --> 01:57:28,042
Everyone makes mistakes.

1404
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:30,958
But in the end...

1405
01:57:31,875 --> 01:57:37,292
the ones who fix their mistakes
are truly righteous.

1406
01:57:39,833 --> 01:57:41,750
And I know...

1407
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,833
that you'll do the right thing.

1408
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:19,958
My God, I cannot believe my eyes!

1409
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:21,625
So beautiful!

1410
01:58:21,708 --> 01:58:25,875
You look just like a princess!

1411
01:58:26,083 --> 01:58:29,833
I brought these bangles for you.

1412
01:58:30,042 --> 01:58:33,708
These are ancestral.
My mother had given them to me.

1413
01:58:33,792 --> 01:58:34,958
And I am passing them on to you.

1414
01:58:35,042 --> 01:58:37,542
-What?
-Right.

1415
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:43,250
My dear, I know you must be
thinking that this isn't right.

1416
01:58:43,458 --> 01:58:45,375
But soon, everything will be alright.

1417
01:58:45,708 --> 01:58:47,375
This is how marriages happen.

1418
01:58:47,667 --> 01:58:49,958
And my son, my munchkin...

1419
01:58:50,292 --> 01:58:52,708
he's a very good guy.

1420
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:54,542
He'll look after you.

1421
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:57,667
He'll take good care of you.
I swear.

1422
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:02,042
He'll pamper you and give you
everything that he has.

1423
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:03,958
And that unwilling father of yours?

1424
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:06,583
He'll come to terms with it too,
I'm telling you!

1425
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:11,958
-You're right
-God bless you!

1426
01:59:12,292 --> 01:59:14,917
My friend, you look like a prince today.

1427
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,375
She's a lucky woman, you know.

1428
01:59:16,458 --> 01:59:18,583
Is the Maulvi here or not?

1429
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:20,542
Dad, my button popped open again.

1430
01:59:20,625 --> 01:59:23,250
-Call the tailor!
-To hell with the tailor!

1431
01:59:23,333 --> 01:59:25,333
The Maulvi is going to officiate,
not the tailor.

1432
01:59:25,417 --> 01:59:27,625
Who cares about the buttons?
They're gonna open up later anyway.

1433
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:30,583
Tell me, who's gone to get the Maulvi?

1434
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,417
Son, I've been praying all my life.

1435
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,625
But never as much
as sitting with you on the bike.

1436
01:59:38,708 --> 01:59:40,750
You couldn't keep your
damned foot off of the accelerator.

1437
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:42,167
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

1438
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:46,042
One should be pious like yourself,
and stubborn like me!

1439
01:59:47,167 --> 01:59:49,042
Come, let's go.

1440
01:59:49,125 --> 01:59:50,500
God, I repent!

1441
01:59:53,708 --> 01:59:54,792
The bird took it!

1442
01:59:56,708 --> 01:59:57,750
This way, sir.

1443
01:59:57,833 --> 02:00:00,333
Get over there you son of gun!

1444
02:00:00,417 --> 02:00:02,333
Mr. Butt, the Maulvi.

1445
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:05,792
Salaam Alaikum. Welcome.

1446
02:00:05,875 --> 02:00:11,583
My son, you take
care of all of my problems, don't you?

1447
02:00:11,667 --> 02:00:15,375
If it wasn't for you,
I would have been worthless.

1448
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:19,708
Go, my boy.
Enjoy the party!

1449
02:00:21,833 --> 02:00:24,917
Give me that.
It's time to nab the sweetmeat.

1450
02:00:25,625 --> 02:00:28,875
Wow, so much perfume!

1451
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:30,708
Aren't you wearing any?
You're too smelly.

1452
02:00:30,792 --> 02:00:32,458
-Hello there, Teefa.
-Hi, teefa.

1453
02:00:32,542 --> 02:00:33,917
How do I look?

1454
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,125
Oh my! Praise be to God.

1455
02:00:38,792 --> 02:00:41,125
Damn, it opened up again!

1456
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:43,167
There goes all of my self confidence!

1457
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:45,292
Well no problem, it's just a button.

1458
02:00:45,417 --> 02:00:47,042
Let's just button it up again.

1459
02:00:47,208 --> 02:00:48,250
Suck in your belly.

1460
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:51,417
Could you guys go
over there for a second?

1461
02:00:54,958 --> 02:00:56,417
-Teefa.
-Yes?

1462
02:00:56,667 --> 02:00:57,958
You're like a brother to me.

1463
02:00:58,208 --> 02:01:00,042
I can share this only with you.

1464
02:01:00,917 --> 02:01:04,458
You know, it's sort of my first time.

1465
02:01:04,667 --> 02:01:06,750
So how I do make Anya...

1466
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:08,750
smile.

1467
02:01:08,833 --> 02:01:10,625
She looks sad all the time.

1468
02:01:10,833 --> 02:01:14,417
If you say, should I go talk to her?

1469
02:01:15,625 --> 02:01:18,833
-I guess she listens to you, right?
-Yes.

1470
02:01:18,917 --> 02:01:20,167
Please put in a good word for me.

1471
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:23,292
I know just what to do, don't worry.

1472
02:01:23,375 --> 02:01:24,667
Here, have this sweetmeat.

1473
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:26,708
Don't you worry. Okay?

1474
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:28,750
Listen.

1475
02:01:29,458 --> 02:01:31,708
-Don't mind, okay?
-Not at all.

1476
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:34,625
-Something's been bothering me.
-Tell me.

1477
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:37,375
Well, you guys were together
for a really long time.

1478
02:01:37,458 --> 02:01:39,750
-Did you both ever...
-What the hell are you saying!

1479
02:01:39,833 --> 02:01:41,833
-She's your sister in law!
-What!

1480
02:01:41,917 --> 02:01:43,625
I meant, mine.

1481
02:01:45,042 --> 02:01:46,583
But you don't have to worry at all.

1482
02:01:48,083 --> 02:01:50,708
You just wait and watch how
I go and talk to her.

1483
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,375
No worries.
It's your wedding, man!

1484
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:59,250
-Teefa, where are going?
-Salaam Alaikum.

1485
02:01:59,542 --> 02:02:01,083
Need to get out of here.

1486
02:02:04,833 --> 02:02:07,542
<i>At first the barber came for me</i>

1487
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:10,333
<i>At first the barber came for me</i>

1488
02:02:10,417 --> 02:02:13,208
<i>I won't go with the barber,
I am scared</i>

1489
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:15,750
<i>Can't lift the lock
Can't say anything</i>

1490
02:02:15,833 --> 02:02:18,542
<i>Can't lift the lock
Can't throw it away</i>

1491
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:21,542
<i>Can't lift the lock
Can't throw it away</i>

1492
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:25,417
<i>Barber, oh barber,
You're a player</i>

1493
02:02:25,542 --> 02:02:27,792
<i>With your slick moves
You're a player</i>

1494
02:02:27,917 --> 02:02:29,750
<i>I won't go with you</i>

1495
02:02:29,958 --> 02:02:31,083
<i>I won't go</i>

1496
02:02:31,167 --> 02:02:32,167
Anya!

1497
02:02:35,458 --> 02:02:36,333
Anya!

1498
02:02:42,292 --> 02:02:43,417
Anya?

1499
02:02:45,292 --> 02:02:46,458
Anya?

1500
02:02:59,208 --> 02:03:00,625
Anya!

1501
02:03:01,917 --> 02:03:02,792
Anya!

1502
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:03,958
-What are you doing?
-You!

1503
02:03:04,042 --> 02:03:05,083
What are you doing here!

1504
02:03:05,167 --> 02:03:06,875
Have you lost it?
You'll die!

1505
02:03:06,958 --> 02:03:08,125
Give me your hand!

1506
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:10,125
I'd rather die than give you my hand!

1507
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,083
Neither is this a good way to escape
nor to die.

1508
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:14,875
You're surrounded by Butt's men!
You won't be able to escape!

1509
02:03:17,375 --> 02:03:19,042
Can you just give me your hand?
Climb up!

1510
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:21,000
Billu is one lucky guy!

1511
02:03:21,083 --> 02:03:23,125
A foreign chick,
who doesn't even talk back.

1512
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:25,208
-Truly amazing!
-Truly amazing!

1513
02:03:26,167 --> 02:03:27,250
Give me your hand.

1514
02:03:33,375 --> 02:03:35,042
Pass that over.

1515
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,458
Don't you dare touch me!

1516
02:03:42,542 --> 02:03:44,417
Amazing! I just saved you and--

1517
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,208
You're the one who got me
here in the first place.

1518
02:03:46,292 --> 02:03:48,000
I was a fool but not anymore!

1519
02:03:48,083 --> 02:03:50,958
-Look, just listen to me.
-No!

1520
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:52,917
Now you listen to me!

1521
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,292
One more word and I'll...

1522
02:03:55,625 --> 02:03:59,000
I'll scream my lungs out
and make sure everyone's here!

1523
02:04:00,625 --> 02:04:01,667
Alright, scream!

1524
02:04:01,792 --> 02:04:05,542
"Help me, I am dying!"
Go on, scream!

1525
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:12,292
I have never seen a bigger scoundrel
in my entire life!

1526
02:04:12,417 --> 02:04:17,042
I know I am a scoundrel, a dog.
A bloody rascal!

1527
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:19,583
But for one last time,
please listen to me.

1528
02:04:20,125 --> 02:04:21,542
I got you into this mess, right?

1529
02:04:23,875 --> 02:04:26,000
-So, I'll get you out of it.
-Why?

1530
02:04:26,083 --> 02:04:28,500
Why should I believe you?
Tell me.

1531
02:04:46,583 --> 02:04:47,625
Take it.

1532
02:04:47,958 --> 02:04:51,583
If it fires,
you need not believe me.

1533
02:04:52,125 --> 02:04:55,250
But if it doesn't,
you'll have to do everything I say.

1534
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:15,042
I hope you've thought this through.
I am a bit crazy.

1535
02:05:16,333 --> 02:05:17,792
I've thought about it.

1536
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:19,792
I am a bit crazy myself.

1537
02:05:20,917 --> 02:05:22,042
Do it.

1538
02:05:37,917 --> 02:05:39,708
-Come over here, Khalida.
-Yes.

1539
02:05:39,792 --> 02:05:40,708
I was saying...

1540
02:05:43,458 --> 02:05:44,417
Dad!

1541
02:05:44,542 --> 02:05:45,667
My Anya!

1542
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:48,208
Anya!

1543
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:54,375
What the hell did you do!
I can't believe you actually fired!

1544
02:05:55,625 --> 02:05:57,667
I didn't know
it would fire so easily!

1545
02:05:57,792 --> 02:06:00,292
-You asked me to do it!
-Are you gonna do everything I say?

1546
02:06:00,375 --> 02:06:01,750
Yes! No!

1547
02:06:02,292 --> 02:06:04,125
No! Yes!

1548
02:06:04,208 --> 02:06:05,292
No...

1549
02:06:05,417 --> 02:06:08,500
Anya, open the door!
Is everything alright?

1550
02:06:08,583 --> 02:06:10,583
Open the door!

1551
02:06:10,667 --> 02:06:12,167
Who fired that shot?

1552
02:06:12,333 --> 02:06:13,542
Open up, dear!

1553
02:06:13,625 --> 02:06:15,125
Open the door!

1554
02:06:15,208 --> 02:06:18,792
-Dad, I widowed even before I could marry.
-Take down the door!

1555
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:20,500
-Me?
-Then who else?

1556
02:06:20,583 --> 02:06:21,500
Knock it down!

1557
02:06:21,583 --> 02:06:25,167
Anya, where are you?
Anya!

1558
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:27,708
Look over there, you idiots!

1559
02:06:27,958 --> 02:06:30,542
-Dad!
-God! You scared me!

1560
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:33,083
Look out the window, maybe she jumped!

1561
02:06:33,167 --> 02:06:35,750
Look there, hurry up.

1562
02:06:37,833 --> 02:06:40,000
All well, Mr. Butt?

1563
02:06:40,208 --> 02:06:42,333
The girl ran away!

1564
02:06:43,125 --> 02:06:44,208
What do you mean?

1565
02:06:44,292 --> 02:06:45,917
The girl ran away!

1566
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,417
Meaning she has run!

1567
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,542
Yes!

1568
02:06:48,625 --> 02:06:51,375
But with whom, Mr. Butt?

1569
02:06:51,458 --> 02:06:53,958
-Dad, I think she ran away with Teefa.
-What?

1570
02:06:54,042 --> 02:06:56,167
The chick eloped with Teefa!

1571
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:59,500
What?
Who did she ran away with?

1572
02:06:59,583 --> 02:07:01,875
You idiot, can't you hear?

1573
02:07:01,958 --> 02:07:03,625
She ran away with Teefa!

1574
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:05,375
You could've said that earlier!

1575
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:08,083
So should we tell them to
serve the food or not?

1576
02:07:09,875 --> 02:07:13,542
Go, get them! They ran away!

1577
02:07:22,917 --> 02:07:24,917
Come on, now.

1578
02:07:25,625 --> 02:07:26,875
Here we go.

1579
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:30,292
What? Is the gas over?

1580
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:33,375
-It isn't starting?
-No, I am just trying to act funny.

1581
02:07:34,167 --> 02:07:35,208
Oh, God!

1582
02:07:38,167 --> 02:07:40,417
-Where are you going?
-Move!

1583
02:07:43,375 --> 02:07:45,500
-Come on!
-Let me sit...

1584
02:07:46,042 --> 02:07:48,000
Horses are better than this!

1585
02:07:48,083 --> 02:07:49,583
Come on, start.

1586
02:07:49,667 --> 02:07:51,333
Hurry! Call Meeda too!

1587
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:56,417
You?

1588
02:08:16,125 --> 02:08:20,167
You can't put enough grease in your hair
to make yourself a politician.

1589
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:24,750
Putting on blue and yellow suits
won't make you white!

1590
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:28,417
You can't kidnap someone's
daughter and call her your own.

1591
02:08:28,708 --> 02:08:29,917
Bring her here.

1592
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:36,208
I said bring her.

1593
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:42,542
I could bring her, but...

1594
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,250
she ran away!

1595
02:08:44,333 --> 02:08:45,917
What do you mean she ran away?

1596
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,750
Don't tell me you've been away for so long
that you've forgotten our language!

1597
02:08:48,833 --> 02:08:51,042
It means, she has run!

1598
02:08:51,125 --> 02:08:53,792
-And that too with Teefa.
-Exactly!

1599
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Then why the hell
are you looking at me?

1600
02:08:57,083 --> 02:08:58,250
Go get him!

1601
02:08:58,333 --> 02:08:59,417
Why isn't the bike starting?

1602
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,333
How would I know?
Do I look like a mechanic?

1603
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:02,583
Come on!

1604
02:09:06,958 --> 02:09:09,083
Hurry up! Get them!

1605
02:09:09,292 --> 02:09:11,292
Billu, where are you?

1606
02:09:11,375 --> 02:09:13,042
Get in the car!

1607
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:17,375
Mr. Butt, Teefa's getting away!

1608
02:09:22,542 --> 02:09:25,042
-You clever little monkey!
-Let's go!

1609
02:09:25,917 --> 02:09:27,667
What the hell are
you staring at me for?

1610
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:29,333
Get them!

1611
02:09:32,417 --> 02:09:33,500
Let's go!

1612
02:09:33,583 --> 02:09:35,792
Teefa!

1613
02:09:35,875 --> 02:09:37,292
Teefa, I'll...

1614
02:10:13,417 --> 02:10:14,875
Where are we going?

1615
02:10:15,292 --> 02:10:16,583
Didn't I tell you?

1616
02:10:16,667 --> 02:10:19,333
I got you into this mess,
and I'll get you out of it.

1617
02:10:27,292 --> 02:10:29,833
Hurry up!

1618
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,083
Get out of the way!

1619
02:10:32,375 --> 02:10:34,000
Hurry up!

1620
02:10:34,167 --> 02:10:36,833
Where is that rascal?

1621
02:11:00,792 --> 02:11:01,875
Happy?

1622
02:11:06,125 --> 02:11:07,500
Always keep smiling.

1623
02:11:08,208 --> 02:11:09,375
You look great when you do.

1624
02:11:12,958 --> 02:11:14,042
Anya!

1625
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:19,500
Andy?

1626
02:11:23,042 --> 02:11:24,292
Teefa, you...

1627
02:11:27,375 --> 02:11:28,375
Why?

1628
02:11:32,167 --> 02:11:34,083
Do keep me in your prayers.

1629
02:11:35,958 --> 02:11:37,167
That's all I am taking away from here.

1630
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:41,083
<i>My love,</i>

1631
02:11:41,167 --> 02:11:44,875
<i>Your path is far from me</i>

1632
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:48,792
<i>And my arms</i>

1633
02:11:48,917 --> 02:11:52,625
<i>Long for you</i>

1634
02:11:53,167 --> 02:11:56,750
<i>You reside within my heart and soul</i>

1635
02:11:57,167 --> 02:12:01,083
<i>Why won't you say something?</i>

1636
02:12:01,292 --> 02:12:04,875
<i>Breathe life into me</i>

1637
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:09,417
<i>So I can breathe</i>

1638
02:12:43,875 --> 02:12:45,292
Teefa...

1639
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:48,042
didn't I tell you?

1640
02:12:48,375 --> 02:12:51,125
Never break my trust.

1641
02:12:52,833 --> 02:12:54,417
What do I do, Mr. Butt?

1642
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:55,750
What's done is done.

1643
02:12:55,833 --> 02:12:59,333
Break his freaking legs!

1644
02:13:04,375 --> 02:13:05,208
Oh my!

1645
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,083
What's happening

1646
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:27,792
Anya?

1647
02:15:27,875 --> 02:15:29,500
Where is she?

1648
02:15:35,458 --> 02:15:36,458
Anya!

1649
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:40,958
How childish of you!

1650
02:15:41,083 --> 02:15:43,167
You had gotten us all worried!

1651
02:15:43,917 --> 02:15:45,875
This is no age for me to
be running around looking for you.

1652
02:15:45,958 --> 02:15:47,208
You shouldn't have done this!

1653
02:15:47,292 --> 02:15:48,917
Come on, let's go home.

1654
02:15:49,667 --> 02:15:51,458
For the first time in his life

1655
02:15:51,542 --> 02:15:53,250
your half-English father
has said something wise.

1656
02:15:53,333 --> 02:15:54,625
Let's go home, my child.

1657
02:15:54,708 --> 02:15:56,583
Butt, that's enough!

1658
02:15:56,958 --> 02:15:57,875
Come on!

1659
02:15:59,125 --> 02:16:02,667
Her home is here. She'll go with us.

1660
02:16:02,792 --> 02:16:07,833
I no longer have the energy
to deal with your antics, Butt.

1661
02:16:08,375 --> 02:16:09,333
Come on, Anya.

1662
02:16:10,792 --> 02:16:13,750
No one's coming to get you out of here.

1663
02:19:16,792 --> 02:19:18,375
God bless you!

1664
02:19:55,375 --> 02:19:57,833
Old man, give me the stick.

1665
02:19:57,917 --> 02:19:59,208
Yeah, right!

1666
02:20:00,083 --> 02:20:02,458
Can I have it please?
It'll only take a couple of minutes.

1667
02:20:02,792 --> 02:20:05,250
-Okay, then.
-Why, thank you.

1668
02:20:57,917 --> 02:21:00,417
Anya, let's go.

1669
02:21:00,958 --> 02:21:03,250
Anya, you're coming with me!

1670
02:21:03,333 --> 02:21:05,708
The Maulvi is waiting, come with me.

1671
02:21:05,833 --> 02:21:07,750
Anya's my daughter, she'll come with me!

1672
02:21:07,833 --> 02:21:09,042
I said, she'll come with me.

1673
02:21:09,125 --> 02:21:11,333
How dare you! I am her father!

1674
02:21:11,417 --> 02:21:13,208
You guys should stop fighting!

1675
02:21:13,292 --> 02:21:15,542
-She'll come with me.
-I am her father, she will--

1676
02:21:15,625 --> 02:21:16,500
Stop it!

1677
02:21:17,542 --> 02:21:18,750
Shut up!

1678
02:21:20,667 --> 02:21:21,833
Whom should I go with?

1679
02:21:22,667 --> 02:21:24,333
Should I go with you dad?

1680
02:21:24,708 --> 02:21:25,875
Tell me?

1681
02:21:26,708 --> 02:21:28,750
No. I should go with you.

1682
02:21:29,083 --> 02:21:31,583
Or with you?
Maybe with you?

1683
02:21:32,333 --> 02:21:34,000
Or how about I go with you?

1684
02:21:34,083 --> 02:21:35,375
Of course! Why not?

1685
02:21:35,458 --> 02:21:37,375
Muhammad Asif from Patogi.

1686
02:21:38,833 --> 02:21:39,917
Wow!

1687
02:21:40,417 --> 02:21:42,417
There's another lined up!

1688
02:21:45,542 --> 02:21:48,375
Will anyone care to ask
whom I want to go with?

1689
02:21:49,417 --> 02:21:50,542
What am I? An item?

1690
02:21:50,667 --> 02:21:51,875
Well, that you are!

1691
02:21:56,375 --> 02:21:58,292
What's up with all you men?

1692
02:21:59,292 --> 02:22:01,208
You think a woman has no say?

1693
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:04,708
Do you ever get a boy married
against his will?

1694
02:22:04,958 --> 02:22:06,750
Or do you save all of
these antics for girls only?

1695
02:22:14,958 --> 02:22:19,458
The girl does have a point, you know.

1696
02:22:20,583 --> 02:22:23,417
One should ask!

1697
02:22:24,375 --> 02:22:28,750
Well, let me do the honors.

1698
02:22:30,208 --> 02:22:32,667
Will you come with us?

1699
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:38,875
Don't you dare! That's my daughter!

1700
02:22:38,958 --> 02:22:40,000
Butt, who is he?

1701
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:48,875
Teefa, my son,
you had brought me a message, right?

1702
02:22:49,667 --> 02:22:53,917
Now get ready for the reply.

1703
02:22:54,083 --> 02:22:56,167
I won't be unfair.

1704
02:22:56,458 --> 02:23:01,000
A slap... for a slap.

1705
02:23:01,625 --> 02:23:02,917
Come on.

1706
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,708
Give one tight slap to Butt.

1707
02:23:07,083 --> 02:23:08,500
Go ahead.

1708
02:23:12,917 --> 02:23:14,542
Aren't you a mannerless fellow!

1709
02:23:16,708 --> 02:23:22,417
You hadn't thought
this through now, did you?

1710
02:23:22,750 --> 02:23:24,750
Well, it's you who
didn't think this through.

1711
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:28,500
I am a stubborn guy.
I am sure you remember

1712
02:23:28,583 --> 02:23:29,958
But I ain't mannerless!

1713
02:23:30,125 --> 02:23:31,542
How could you forget?

1714
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,167
You want me to slap, right?

1715
02:23:33,333 --> 02:23:36,458
I will do so.
And it'll be a tight one.

1716
02:23:36,792 --> 02:23:39,875
But, it will be on your face!

1717
02:23:39,958 --> 02:23:44,583
Hey! I haven't even asked
for my money yet.

1718
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:47,958
Three times more,
with the slap as interest.

1719
02:23:48,542 --> 02:23:49,750
Or else...

1720
02:23:52,333 --> 02:23:55,583
Dad! Let go of me!

1721
02:23:55,667 --> 02:23:58,333
-Teefa!
-Dad, please save me!

1722
02:23:58,417 --> 02:23:59,375
I don't want to go with him!

1723
02:23:59,458 --> 02:24:01,417
Hey, get them!

1724
02:24:28,458 --> 02:24:29,792
Let go!

1725
02:24:37,167 --> 02:24:38,042
Teefa!

1726
02:24:56,917 --> 02:24:57,792
Teefa!

1727
02:25:15,917 --> 02:25:17,917
-Teefa!
-Teefa!

1728
02:25:22,292 --> 02:25:23,333
Anya!

1729
02:25:25,333 --> 02:25:27,833
Anya!

1730
02:26:32,083 --> 02:26:33,625
Teefa...

1731
02:26:33,917 --> 02:26:36,542
where are you taking me this time?

1732
02:26:41,833 --> 02:26:43,458
Where ever you want me to.

1733
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:46,750
Aren't you going to ask?

1734
02:26:48,833 --> 02:26:52,458
Can anyone do anything
without asking you?

1735
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Tell me. Where do you want to go?

1736
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:03,000
Wherever you take me.

1737
02:27:06,292 --> 02:27:07,583
Are you sure?

1738
02:27:09,583 --> 02:27:10,625
I am sure.

1739
02:27:11,292 --> 02:27:12,708
I am crazy!

1740
02:27:14,125 --> 02:27:15,875
Well, so am I.

1741
02:27:19,417 --> 02:27:21,250
Will you love me?

1742
02:27:28,458 --> 02:27:29,500
Will you?

1743
02:27:32,875 --> 02:27:34,250
Oh, you have no idea.

1744
02:27:46,208 --> 02:27:47,458
But on one condition.

1745
02:27:47,875 --> 02:27:53,583
You'll have to make me <i>Aloo Chaat,</i>
chicken curry,

1746
02:27:53,750 --> 02:27:56,542
and fried bitter gourd everyday.

1747
02:27:57,125 --> 02:27:58,167
Then only I'll love you.

1748
02:27:58,917 --> 02:27:59,917
Will you make that for me?

1749
02:28:02,042 --> 02:28:02,958
Teefa?

1750
02:28:06,917 --> 02:28:07,750
Teefa?

1751
02:28:15,417 --> 02:28:17,667
Teefa, wake up!

1752
02:28:18,292 --> 02:28:19,208
Teefa!

1753
02:28:19,542 --> 02:28:21,542
Teefa, I'll do whatever you say,

1754
02:28:21,625 --> 02:28:23,250
I'll go wherever you take me!

1755
02:28:23,333 --> 02:28:24,542
Please, wake up!

1756
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,042
Teefa, wake up! Teefa!

1757
02:28:29,708 --> 02:28:32,250
Teefa!

1758
02:28:36,750 --> 02:28:40,000
<i>And my arms</i>

1759
02:28:40,083 --> 02:28:43,875
<i>Long for you</i>

1760
02:28:44,417 --> 02:28:48,375
<i>You reside within my heart and soul</i>

1761
02:28:48,583 --> 02:28:52,167
<i>Why won't you say something?</i>

1762
02:28:52,708 --> 02:28:56,125
<i>Breathe life into me</i>

1763
02:28:56,667 --> 02:29:00,833
<i>So I can breathe</i>

1764
02:29:06,792 --> 02:29:08,333
<i>So...</i>

1765
02:29:09,083 --> 02:29:11,208
<i>what did I tell you guys?</i>

1766
02:29:11,917 --> 02:29:14,208
<i>This world's a tough place.</i>

1767
02:29:15,542 --> 02:29:18,208
<i>It neither lets you live, nor die.</i>

1768
02:29:19,083 --> 02:29:22,750
<i>When you're alive,
all they talk about is killing and dying.</i>

1769
02:29:23,208 --> 02:29:24,625
<i>And when death comes to you,</i>

1770
02:29:24,708 --> 02:29:26,375
<i>all they want is for you to be alive.</i>

1771
02:29:26,458 --> 02:29:27,917
<i>What is a man supposed to do?</i>

1772
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,167
<i>So much confusion!</i>

1773
02:29:31,333 --> 02:29:34,167
<i>Man knows that he was
brought into this world.</i>

1774
02:29:34,708 --> 02:29:36,875
<i>But he forgets about
leaving it one day.</i>

1775
02:29:37,208 --> 02:29:38,417
<i>However,</i>

1776
02:29:39,083 --> 02:29:41,583
<i>my death brought
all of them together.</i>

1777
02:29:41,708 --> 02:29:42,917
<i>What more could I ask for?</i>

1778
02:29:44,042 --> 02:29:46,042
<i>A wise man once said,</i>

1779
02:29:46,125 --> 02:29:48,042
<i>"Time heals all wounds."</i>

1780
02:29:48,125 --> 02:29:49,875
<i>It always passes, you know.</i>

1781
02:29:52,083 --> 02:29:54,667
<i>Before you know it,</i>

1782
02:29:54,875 --> 02:29:58,542
<i>Butt and Basheera's friendship
became the talk of the town.</i>

1783
02:30:00,417 --> 02:30:03,458
<i>As they say,
"what goes around comes around."</i>

1784
02:30:07,333 --> 02:30:10,292
<i>And as they say in English, "cute."</i>

1785
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,750
<i>Billu Butt also found
his special someone.</i>

1786
02:30:19,208 --> 02:30:21,375
<i>He too, deserves love, right?</i>

1787
02:30:22,250 --> 02:30:24,625
<i>And that made Khalida happy as well.</i>

1788
02:30:24,792 --> 02:30:26,083
<i>"Right?"</i>

1789
02:30:27,292 --> 02:30:33,875
<i>As for Tony, he finally ended up
with his Senorita.</i>

1790
02:30:35,792 --> 02:30:38,042
<i>That leaves us with ma and Anya.</i>

1791
02:30:38,458 --> 02:30:41,042
<i>I love the both of them very much.</i>

1792
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:44,958
<i>I still think that they're
out there missing me.</i>

1793
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:48,292
<i>Thinking about my cooking.</i>

1794
02:30:48,917 --> 02:30:50,417
<i>They must be wondering...</i>

1795
02:30:50,708 --> 02:30:52,042
<i>how easy it was for me...</i>

1796
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:54,417
<i>to fool all of you!</i>

1797
02:30:58,708 --> 02:31:01,417
Presenting, hot tikkas!

1798
02:31:05,917 --> 02:31:06,875
What happened?

1799
02:31:06,958 --> 02:31:08,542
Why are you all acting
like someone died in here?

1800
02:31:08,625 --> 02:31:10,750
Well, we're about to die of hunger!

1801
02:31:11,083 --> 02:31:13,458
Bring those special Teefa's tikkas!

1802
02:31:13,542 --> 02:31:16,458
Bring them over, while they're hot.

1803
02:31:17,458 --> 02:31:18,458
Have some.

1804
02:31:18,542 --> 02:31:22,250
-Butt, come on, try some.
-Give me some more.

1805
02:31:22,333 --> 02:31:23,750
Who made this?

1806
02:31:23,833 --> 02:31:26,208
-I did!
-Wonderful, my boy!

1807
02:31:29,583 --> 02:31:30,833
-Teefa, come here.
-Yes?

1808
02:31:31,208 --> 02:31:32,333
-We've got a new job.
-What?

1809
02:31:32,417 --> 02:31:34,125
We have to nab an auntie in Morocco.

1810
02:31:34,208 --> 02:31:37,542
-I hope she isn't heavy.
-Just check her out.

1811
02:31:39,250 --> 02:31:40,833
-Teefa!
-Do you want some salad?

1812
02:31:47,208 --> 02:31:50,083
-You look very pretty.
-Here you go.

1813
02:31:50,167 --> 02:31:52,542
Thank you... sister-in-law!

1814
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:54,208
She's a sister to me.

1815
02:31:59,625 --> 02:32:01,625
-Come here, I'll show you something.
-What?

1816
02:32:02,042 --> 02:32:03,208
Check that out.

1817
02:32:06,375 --> 02:32:07,333
I know right!

1818
02:32:10,667 --> 02:32:12,917
TEEFA'S TIKKAS.
