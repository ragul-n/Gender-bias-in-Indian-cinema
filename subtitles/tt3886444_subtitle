1
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,785
'Last night...
I dreamt the same dream again...'

2
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,689
'Once again...me and her...'

3
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,719
'...lost in the shadows
of the Lakeside Manor.'

4
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,291
'...and Lakeside Manor...
still looked the same.'

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,261
'Trapped in the clutches of time.'

6
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,799
'Standing quietly...in
the darkness of the night.'

7
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,603
'Like someone who
knows all the secrets...'

8
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,266
'..but is still silent.'

9
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,638
'As if it's saying...'

10
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,803
"Don't you miss me?"

11
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,941
'Even if we miss it, what can we do?'

12
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,444
'We can't ever go back there.'

13
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,984
'But yesmwe can certainly go back...'

14
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,821
'...to where this story began.'

15
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,294
Hi, it's Valentine's Day...

16
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,590
and... on this auspicious day...

17
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,531
...we're making a cute movie.

18
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,332
The heroine of this film
is taking her beauty sleep.

19
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,501
Hi, Happy Valentine's Day!

20
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,236
Happy Valentine's Day!

21
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,507
Now, say cheese.

22
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,382
Why the camera?

23
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,848
Come on...it's okay.

24
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,918
You're looking so beautiful.
Right?

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,887
No, switch off the camera.

26
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,219
Okay, on one condition.

27
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,254
Say that you love me.

28
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,627
Okay, I love you...
Now shutdown the camera.

29
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,424
No.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,897
Now say...

31
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,799
You will always...always...
always be with me.

32
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,226
Yeah!

33
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,199
I will always...always...
always be with you.

34
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,798
Now turn it off.

35
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,404
You will never leave me.

36
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,140
I will never leave you.

37
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,914
And...
- Now shut it down.

38
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,782
...give me a nice kissy.
- No.

39
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:55,819
No.
- No.

40
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,149
No.
- No.

41
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,444
Hey come on...
Whatever...

42
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,744
What nonsense...

43
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,439
It was mad.
- We must go again.

44
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,745
What about Shekhar, where is he?
- His wife called.

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,877
Poor guy.
- Where's he going?

46
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,922
That's what she saying.
Her husband is Indian.

47
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,183
Come with me.

48
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,986
Excuse me.
- It's okay.

49
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,087
Look at what your
so-called friend has done.

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,165
"Okay, I love you..."

51
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,499
"Now shutdown the camera."

52
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,432
"No. Now say..."

53
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,595
"Okay, I love you..."

54
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,332
"Now shutdown the camera."
- See this.

55
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,374
"No. Now say..."

56
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,308
"You will always...always...
always be with me."

57
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,776
"Okay, I love you..."

58
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,205
"Now shutdown the camera."

59
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,305
Oh God.
- "No. Now say..."

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,508
"Okay, I love you..."

61
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,676
"...now shutdown the camera.

62
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,582
"No. Now say..."

63
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,415
I am sorry.

64
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,544
"You will always...always...
always be with me."

65
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,055
I'm not going to leave him.
I won't spare him.

66
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,489
Sam ee r! Sam ee r!

67
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,427
Rascal...get up...

68
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,103
I'm not going to leave you, rascal...

69
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,709
I'm not going to leave you.

70
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,042
You dog!

71
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,208
Sameer!

72
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,082
Stop it, Sameer!

73
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,614
Stop, Sameer. Stop.

74
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,744
Leave me Simran!

75
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,913
I won't spare him.

76
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,458
Let me handle this. - Rascal,
you finally showed your true colors.

77
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,524
You dog.
- Stop it.

78
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,992
Rascal...

79
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,385
What a lowlife.

80
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,055
I'm not going to leave him.

81
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,772
Why did you do this, Kabir?

82
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,800
Why?

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,304
What joy did you get?

84
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,182
The joy you got after leaving me,
running me...

85
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,715
..and marrying someone else...

86
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,891
...l felt the same joy in
ruining your marriage.

87
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,024
Now the whole world knows.

88
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,725
You made promises to
me and married someone else.

89
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,828
Bloody unfaithful Simran.

90
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,369
If proving that I am
unfaithful makes you happy..

91
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,241
..then okay...l am unfaithful.

92
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:41,076
What about all the ways
that you've betrayed yourself?

93
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,910
Won't you celebrate those?

94
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,923
You fought with your parents...

95
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,059
...and broke all ties with them...

96
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,991
..and betrayed that relationship.

97
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,424
You wrote one book...

98
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,533
...but, left three books incomplete.

99
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,463
And betrayed your profession.

100
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:05,170
Every year you promised to marry me...

101
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,672
...and then,
each year you betrayed your promise.

102
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,083
You're an incomplete man, Kabir.

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,414
You could never complete
anything in life.

104
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,881
The truth is,
that my marriage made you realize...

105
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:25,953
how incomplete your life is and
that's what you're angry at, not me.

106
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:32,769
Try to look for the Kabir...

107
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,372
that I fell in love with...

108
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:43,842
...because I don't know who this
incomplete and hopeless Kabir is.

109
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,181
Hi, Sid.
- Hi.

110
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,919
I would've asked
how you are...

111
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,354
...if your face wasn't
already revealing your condition.

112
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,760
I admit my face isn't in a good state.

113
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,555
But, I am here to say something nice.

114
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,964
Wow! I'm getting the opportunity"

115
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,367
..to hear you say something nice.

116
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,372
Go on!

117
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,965
I want to write a book.

118
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,338
Incomplete or complete?

119
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,537
I'm not joking, I am serious.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,204
Even I am serious.

121
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,678
You've already taken
the advance for three books.

122
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,409
I am answerable to
the board of directors.

123
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,383
Now you'll want an advance again.

124
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,617
What's this?

125
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,656
I am not here for the advance.

126
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:05,856
In fact, I am returning the advance...

127
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,523
...l took for the previous three books.

128
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,031
This is yours.

129
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,998
I don't understand.

130
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:21,905
Siddhanh, I've taken undue
advantage of our friendship.

131
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,044
I'm really very sorry.

132
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,647
I am.

133
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,189
I know...no one trusts me anymore...

134
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,152
and it's mostly my fault.

135
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:42,728
But now I want to write a book that
will help me win back everyone's trust.

136
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,165
Maybe..

137
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,931
So...l need your help.

138
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,934
You can print it if you like it.

139
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,201
That's it.

140
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:00,774
Today after many years I can see glimpses
of the old Kabir Malhotra in you.

141
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,846
Some bits of me are visible...

142
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,394
...but some are yet to be re-discovered.

143
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,227
I'll return when I find all the pieces.

144
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,328
I'm leaving for now.

145
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,228
Kabir!

146
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,241
Where will you go?

147
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:52,168
"O my heart!
Let's go far away from this world."

148
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:57,470
"Let's hold the fingers of the road
and start walking."

149
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,838
"O my heart!
Let's go far away from this world."

150
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:07,515
"Let's hold the fingers of the road
and start walking."

151
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,886
"Where there are no happiness's
and no sadness's."

152
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:18,527
"Let's find such a place."

153
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:24,564
"What you've won and lost,
why are you thinking so much about it."

154
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:29,573
"You are the river, you're the sea,
why are you holding yourself back."

155
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:35,275
"What you've won and lost,
why are you thinking so much about it."

156
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:40,875
"You are the river, you're the sea,
why are you holding yourself back."

157
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,901
"Whatever has happened, has happened."

158
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,977
"Whatever is going to happen,
will happen."

159
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:17,577
"Why are you blaming your destiny."

160
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:22,188
"You reap what you sow."

161
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:27,630
"Where there are some new mornings."

162
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,395
"Let's find such a place."

163
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:39,306
"What you've won and lost,
why are you thinking so much about it."

164
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,405
"You are the river, you're the sea,
why are you holding yourself back."

165
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,950
"What you've won and lost,
why are you thinking so much about it."

166
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:55,652
"You are the river, you're the sea,
why are you holding yourself back."

167
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,278
It's a strange place, isn't it?

168
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,863
Normally...the journey
of life ends here.

169
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,527
But at this crematorium...

170
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,862
...the journey of
unfulfilled desires begins.

171
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,063
What do you mean?

172
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,606
People come...tie a ribbon...

173
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,270
...and pray for their incomplete
desires to be fulfilled.

174
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:54,276
I wish fulfilling desires was that easy.

175
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,619
Give it a try... maybe.

176
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,883
...l just buried my desires.

177
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,956
Once I start something new...

178
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,954
...l will pray for
it to be fulfilled too.

179
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,160
Listen...

180
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,769
You will definitely find new desires...

181
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,067
...on the path that you've taken.

182
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,338
But remember...your desires...

183
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,610
...will bring you back here.

184
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,206
Hello.

185
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,777
Anybody there?

186
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,878
Are you okay?

187
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,173
E m pfY-

188
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,081
Huh?
- Rooms.

189
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,914
10 rooms, they're all empty.

190
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,587
You can take any room you like.

191
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,947
Give me your best room.

192
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,933
The windows in this
room are bigger, so...

193
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,934
...the room will get more light.

194
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,229
<i>O</i> kaY-

195
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,464
Deposit?

196
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,838
You're filling up an empty room,
that's all for now.

197
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,038
Dinner at 8, in the Dining Room.

198
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,690
Come.

199
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,749
It's really quiet here.

200
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,453
There's no noise.

201
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,385
You can say that too.

202
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,755
Will you...

203
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,454
Join me?

204
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,493
Later.

205
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,569
At least sit with me.

206
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,871
It feels really awkward eating alone.

207
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,487
Your...name?

208
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,590
Meera.

209
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,963
Meera.

210
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,700
Do you look after
this big house alone?

211
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,236
Yes.

212
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,240
Are you from around here?

213
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,411
This is my husband's home.

214
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,982
He's not well, so...

215
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,216
He can't get up from the bed.

216
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,776
He's in the room upstairs.

217
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,153
I am sorry, that's really sad.

218
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:25,647
Don't you feel lonely
here...away from everyone?

219
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,483
A person's lonely even in a crowd.

220
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,153
Well...

221
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,552
...yes, that's true.

222
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:42,360
It's the things that we can't
tell others that make us feel lonely.

223
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,965
We're all prey to our own secrets.

224
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,769
Yeah...you're right.

225
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,906
I never thought of it that way.

226
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,782
I am a writermnovelist.

227
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,344
Here to write a story.

228
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,550
Write a story...or look for one.

229
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,356
Looking for one.

230
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,489
How did you know?

231
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,158
Those who wander around..

232
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,198
..are either looking for a story,
or trying to forget one.

233
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,804
Or both?

234
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,135
Or both.

235
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,705
Well...it's time for
my husband's medicines.

236
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,751
I have to feed him too.

237
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,820
I hope you have a goodnight.
- Yeah.

238
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,382
Goodnight.

239
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,821
'After meeting Meera...
I realized one thing.'

240
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:52,596
'She was much more
incomplete...than I was.'

241
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,699
"She was lonelier...than me."

242
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:04,673
'She was burdened with
many more secrets...than I was."

243
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,175
'And somewhere...
between her secrets and mine...'

244
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,613
'...was my story.'

245
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,355
'And that night...
the story took a new turn.'

246
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,003
Wake up!

247
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:29,139
"My beloved will return."

248
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:35,378
"Will return."

249
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:51,866
"How are the lamps alight
without the flame?"

250
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:59,632
"How are the lamps alight
without the flame?"

251
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:08,384
"Though nobody's shooting,
the arrows are let out of their quiver."

252
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,080
"Though nobody's shooting."

253
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,391
Are you okay?

254
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:01,298
Some...someone's here.

255
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,960
I saw...his reflection.

256
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,760
The radio... It was on.

257
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,238
There was a fire burning.

258
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,800
There was a fire burning here.
I saw it with my own eyes and..

259
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,677
No!

260
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,973
The painting...

261
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,410
The painting...

262
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,112
First the man was in this
painting then, he disappeared.

263
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,485
N---...

264
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,782
Book

265
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,323
This...

266
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,760
Look...

267
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,754
...sometimes when the
wind blows in these valleys...

268
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,766
...the creaking wood of these old houses
almost sound like footsteps.

269
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:43,629
You have travelled a long way
and must also be tired.

270
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,039
I think you need a good night's sleep.

271
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:50,311
Yeah!

272
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,488
I've been calling
you since three days.

273
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,127
And all I get are assurances...

274
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,626
...but there's no trace of my package.

275
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,524
Yes.

276
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,032
How many times do I
have to give you my address?

277
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,534
Fine, write it down.

278
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,770
5, Lakeside Manor.
Hussain Road, Manasar.

279
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,636
19001.

280
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:53,936
And yes...

281
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,672
If I am not at home,
my man Rashid will be.

282
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,475
You can hand over the package to him.

283
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,655
Sometimes you need
to remind people...

284
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,889
...that, there is a man in this house.

285
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,629
Otherwise...there's
a long list of people...

286
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,667
...who like to bother a single woman.

287
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,061
Yeah.

288
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,631
So...where are you going with the bag?

289
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:30,409
Nothing. I was thinking
of doing some sight-seeing.

290
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,679
Get inspired.

291
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,817
Or maybe...you're going
to look for a story.

292
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,145
Something like that.

293
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,824
I made breakfast for you.

294
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,327
And obviously you were trying
to slip out without eating it.

295
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,420
No, I'll eat out...at some cafe.

296
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,933
You shouldn't say no to food.

297
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,360
I'll pack it.

298
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,629
It's fine really.
- Just give me two minutes.

299
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,298
It's...fine.

300
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,946
So, what do you suggest?

301
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,339
What's worth visiting around here?

302
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:09,976
There's a Shiv temple
at a short distance.

303
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,816
There are gardens,
but they are a little old.

304
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:16,052
There's a lake also.
People go there boating sometimes.

305
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,956
How do I get to the Shiv temple?

306
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:25,127
A little ahead from here, there's
a dry fruit store at the crossroads.

307
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:29,500
Turn left and head straight.

308
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,672
Thank you.

309
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,841
- You shouldn't say no to food.

310
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,042
- I'd heard that saying
after a very long time.

311
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:42,342
- After a long time I felt like there
was someone who cared about my meals.

312
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,749
- Whose small gestures
had started touching my heart.

313
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:49,249
- But, on one hand where there were
things about Meera that made me happy...

314
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,988
- ...on the other hand the workings
of her mind continued to baffle me.

315
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,825
Excuse me, mister.

316
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,523
Yes, sir.

317
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,232
There is supposed to
be a dry-fruit store here.

318
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,964
I was told that there is one.

319
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,503
Yes, sir. It used to
be here a couple of years ago.

320
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,632
But it has shifted to the city now.

321
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,793
That dry-fruit store
shifted out years ago.

322
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,702
You haven't stepped out
of your house for that long.

323
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,910
Am I right?

324
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,879
Excuse me.

325
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,519
Sorry, I meant...

326
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,422
...all these years you haven't
even seen the crossroads...

327
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,388
...that are just a
kilometer away from your house.

328
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,388
Right or wrong?

329
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:04,624
The story you're looking
for is right here in this house.

330
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,463
Not out there.

331
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,367
That's the thought that
brought you back here.

332
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,869
Right or wrong?

333
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,845
You make every
conversation complicated.

334
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,977
If I make things easier,
then how will you find your story?

335
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,812
I've no right to
ask you this question.

336
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,651
But what mystery are you hiding?

337
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:35,026
To know my truth...
you'll have to be honest too.

338
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:38,963
You're right.

339
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,730
I see a story here.

340
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,237
I just want to know.

341
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,068
Let's do one thing.

342
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,912
Forget my story.

343
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,347
Why don't you write the story...

344
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,412
..which is slowly
developing here?

345
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:02,421
What do you mean?

346
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,662
A vacant house.

347
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,194
A lonely girl.

348
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,165
Her husband's sick.

349
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,666
A traveler suddenly arrives.

350
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,879
And soon he finds out...

351
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,712
...that there are mysteries
hidden in this house.

352
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,521
He wants to get closer to the girl...

353
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,115
...but he hesitates.

354
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:41,186
And the girl... she knows.

355
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:46,865
There's just one guy who can...

356
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:51,230
...break down the walls around her...

357
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,206
...and that's him.

358
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,848
A strange dilemma.

359
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,287
And then...

360
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:21,704
"At least I got to know about
the thoughts of your heart."

361
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,903
"The ones that you had kept hidden
from the world."

362
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:32,542
"At least I was acquainted
with that thought of yours."

363
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:38,144
"Which you had kept hidden
from your own self."

364
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:45,252
"Somewhere I am reading your eyes
your thoughts."

365
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:52,461
"Somewhere I am getting moulded
in your heart, in your heart beats."

366
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:57,557
"Every moment you are attached to me."

367
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:15,551
"Whether I was close to you or away.."

368
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,380
"You are sad on the day
when I don't see you or meet you.."

369
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:08,239
"You remain very quiet on the day."

370
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:15,218
"When I don't say
or hear anything to you."

371
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:21,815
"l have become a reason to live."

372
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:31,533
"Don't hide this thing from yourself.."

373
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:36,957
"Every moment you are attached to me."

374
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,370
"Whether I was close to you or away.."

375
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:27,083
"Even if you don't say it thing
through your lips."

376
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:33,954
"It's only me who lives in your heart."

377
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:40,969
"Your breaths say yes."

378
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:47,705
"if I touch or hold your hand."

379
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:54,312
"Come on say what you wish.."

380
00:37:54,739 --> 00:38:03,489
"..this is the time to accept,
to admit."

381
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:09,416
"Every moment you are attached to me."

382
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:22,896
"Whether I was close to you or away.."

383
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,819
Meera!
- I am sorry, Kabir.

384
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,361
Please, let go.

385
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,419
Sometimes you get close to me
and then you get distant.

386
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,465
Why? Why?
What is it?

387
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,035
Kabir, please let me go.
- No, no...

388
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,761
I know you won't tell me anything.

389
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:48,929
But at least tell me,...

390
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,667
...would you get close to me if
the situation was different?

391
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,937
The situation isn't any different, Kabir.
- What if it was?

392
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,705
But it's not.

393
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,405
But it can be.

394
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,843
Please.

395
00:38:59,037 --> 00:38:59,845
What do you mean?

396
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,906
There's a place...
where wishes are fulfilled.

397
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,008
Come with me.

398
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,485
Kabir, what madness is this?
What are you doing?

399
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,385
Even I want to know
what this madness is.

400
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,516
I can't leave this house. Okay.
- Why?

401
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,525
Why?
Why can't you?

402
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,429
I can't, that's it.

403
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,691
Why? Okay...fine. Fine.

404
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:19,200
Just tell me...do you want
to be close to me or not?

405
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,827
It's not that simple.
- Do you want to or not?

406
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,429
Kabir.
- Yes or no.

407
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,031
Yes, but...
- That's it...come with me.

408
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,208
Kabir.

409
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,711
Kabir, listen to me.

410
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,315
We're making a big mistake.

411
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,714
We're not doing anything wrong.

412
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,580
This is the right thing to do.

413
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,216
Oh damn.

414
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,366
Pandey, write a report.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,528
It was an accident.
- Okay, sir.

416
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,735
Look sir, this is an accident case.

417
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,137
So we'll have to take a statement.

418
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,074
Now, or at the Police Station.

419
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,577
You can take one now.

420
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,211
What happened?

421
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,142
We were driving down
Lake road and suddenly...

422
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,949
And someone had left a
big boulder on the road.

423
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,387
We didn't see it till the last minute.

424
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,256
And while trying to avoid the boulder...

425
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,419
...the car crashed into the tree.

426
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,361
This often happens here.

427
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,993
The truck drivers leave the boulder...

428
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,498
...on the road,
while trying to fix a tire puncture.

429
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,604
It happened last week.

430
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,148
Thank you.

431
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,780
Why did you give a false statement?

432
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,985
Didn't you see that man
in the middle of the road?

433
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,527
I told you before...

434
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,597
...that I can't leave this house.

435
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,495
But you didn't listen.

436
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:00,092
You mean this is all my fault.
- Goodnight, Kabir.

437
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,487
Where were you?

438
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,215
I've been waiting
for you since two hours.

439
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,088
I am sorry.
I am very sorry.

440
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,752
I...
- Where's the car?

441
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,787
I looked out of the window
and the car wasn't there.

442
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,362
Well...it wasn't working properly
so I took it to the garage...

443
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,229
...so I got delayed.

444
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,858
There's no one to
give me my medicines...

445
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,460
...or to feed me.

446
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,402
lam fed up of this life.

447
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,940
I have to depend
on you for everything.

448
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,102
Jaidev, I said I am sorry.
- What sorry.

449
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,736
I'll get your food right away.

450
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,832
'That night I...
would've cut myself off...'

451
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,204
'...from Meera and
her lies forever...'

452
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,466
'...if I hadn't heard the
hopelessness of my reality...'

453
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,173
'...screeching through my anger.'

454
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:22,444
'I was leaving a relationship
incomplete again.'

455
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:28,953
'When I could finally think
with a cool mind, I realized that...'

456
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:34,595
'...that there was some
helplessness behind Meera's lie.'

457
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:41,096
'A helplessness which
she couldn't endure or convey.'

458
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,069
'And alleviating her pain...'

459
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:48,137
'...was becoming a necessity for me.‘

460
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,115
Hello.

461
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,778
Anybody there?

462
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,683
Hello.

463
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,124
Like I said...

464
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,259
...you will come back.

465
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:09,923
Since you knew that
you probably know the rest as well.

466
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:13,195
I know somethings;
you can fill me in on the rest.

467
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,301
Let's assume there's
an evil spirit in that house.

468
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,541
But...why do you want
to know whose spirit it is?

469
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,704
Meera's being held
captive by that spirit.

470
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,548
And there's something
she isn't telling me.

471
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,084
I want to know why, that's it.

472
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,949
And if I ask...why do you
care about her helplessness?

473
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:34,250
Honestly...

474
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,883
...l don't know why I am doing this.

475
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,161
Every time I look
at her...l feel like...

476
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:45,723
...her silence is screaming for my help.

477
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:48,265
Her loneliness is seeking my support.

478
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,234
"lam no poet..."

479
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,765
"But since the day I saw you..."

480
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:56,276
"...l could write poetry."

481
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,374
I'll come to that house tonight.

482
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:05,078
But before that you'll
need to do one thing.

483
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:29,936
I am sorry.

484
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,975
I lied to the police...

485
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,980
...and you're apologizing?

486
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:38,147
My mom used to say,
before accusing someone...

487
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,880
...one should understand
their situation.

488
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:41,946
Meaning?

489
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:46,153
If you had told the police that
we rammed some guy with our car...

490
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,628
...they would've gone to
the hospital and inquired.

491
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,130
Looked for the body.

492
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,895
We could've been jailed too.

493
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,631
Who would've looked
after your husband?

494
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,339
Run this hotel?

495
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:03,271
You understood all
that in a single night?

496
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,277
Very good.
- Thank you.

497
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,676
lam sensible.

498
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,081
That reminds me...

499
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,083
...my mom also said that...

500
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:14,587
...people should sit together and drink,
to forget their differences.

501
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:17,451
Did your mom really say that?

502
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:22,121
No...but it really makes a big
difference if you put it that way.

503
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:23,457
I swear.

504
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,433
I'll get the glasses.
- Yeah.

505
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,269
We'll see the evil spirit's image...

506
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,434
...in this water.

507
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,405
You mean...reflection.

508
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,543
Yes.

509
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,176
On...On...

510
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,715
Where did he gone?

511
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,896
No...no...

512
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,983
I've recognized that evil spirit.

513
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,791
Come with me.

514
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,433
This is that evil spirit...

515
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,731
...and his name is Jaidev.

516
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,296
What? Jaidev is Meera's husband.

517
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,731
This is his picture.

518
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,669
Jaidev is dead, he's not alive.

519
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:38,940
Then who's upstairs?
- Maybe no one.

520
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,643
How's that possible?
I heard Meera talking...

521
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,787
Oh my, God!

522
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:50,286
It makes sense.

523
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:54,457
I heard Meera talking in a male voice.

524
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,128
So Meera was imitating her husband.

525
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,863
This is all Meera's doing.

526
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,266
She killed her husband.

527
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,406
It'll be dawn soon, I should leave.

528
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:10,105
But you know what you have to do.

529
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:08,457
I've been running
this hotel for 2 years.

530
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,595
I can recognize a wine bottle...

531
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:13,258
...that's already been opened.

532
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:22,309
Now get the hell out of my house.

533
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,279
Get out.

534
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,739
Out!

535
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,549
I just wanted to know...

536
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,250
...to what extent you
could go for your story.

537
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,286
You gave me sleeping pills.

538
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,223
Brought some stranger to my home.

539
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:43,459
You believed him and thought
everything I said was a lie!

540
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,456
Are you satisfied now?

541
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,626
Found out the truth?

542
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,097
Now get the hell out of my house.

543
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,606
Believe me, Meera...
lam not doing this for a story.

544
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,108
I just want to help you.

545
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,804
You wanted to help me by finding
out whether I was lying or not?

546
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:58,972
Did that help?

547
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,345
Now please...leave.

548
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:02,615
Meera..

549
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:05,016
Meera, listen to me. Meera...
- Please.

550
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,385
Meera, I just want to
know what the problem is...

551
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,446
...that's stopping you
from getting close to me?

552
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,751
Who is holding you captive here?

553
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,296
Yes, I am trapped.

554
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,761
But not just me,
but me and my husband both.

555
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,431
The evil spirit in this house
is Jaidev's first wife.

556
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:27,235
She swore to make our life
a living hell before she died!

557
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:31,305
And now she's fulfilling
her curse after her death.

558
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:34,243
Anything else...

559
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:37,542
Anything else to make
your novel a best-seller?

560
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,219
Meera, l..

561
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,155
I think you have
everything you need now.

562
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,249
Just go.

What?

603
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,348
There's no blood on this.

Herbs?

605
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:52,017
The decomposition of his body has
been prevented by using herbs.

606
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,291
He's been dead right from the start.

607

You killed...Jaidev, right?

608
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,810
You killed your husband.

Lies and more lies!

Get it out.

This is the same bottle...

...you were holding
when I first came here.

630

What is it? Huh?

634
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,342
What is it?

635
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,069
What are you hiding from me?

636
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,373
What are you hiding?
Tell me.

637
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,574
Leave me.
- No!

638
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:32,044
It's okay.

639
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,052
It's okay.

640
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,817
It's okay.
It's okay.

641
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,424
Stop.

642
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,499
It's done.
It's done.

643
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,830
It's done.
It's done.

644
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:50,937
It's okay.

645
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:21,202
What happened here...
started back in Mumbai.

646
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:28,735
My dream was to be a fashion model.

647
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:33,138
But my parents...
were against my dream.

648
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:36,976
That night...l had a
big fight with my parents...

649
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,710
...and I left home.

650
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,417
No!

651
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:57,063
Look...there's been an accident...

652
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:05,039
Look...
ls he dead or alive?

653
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:07,178
Someone call for an ambulance!
Take a look...

654
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,648
Look, she's running that way.
- Forget her, first let's check him.

655
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,310
ls there anyone in the car?

656
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,647
Someone call the ambulance.

657
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,481
There's no one in the car.

658
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,354
There's no one in the car.
- Quickly.

659
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,490
Hello.
- Hello, Meera, where are you?

660
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,863
The police are here.

661
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,527
Did you crush someone under my car?

662
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,070
No, Lakhan. It was too dark.

663
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,868
I didn't see him. I don't know where
he came from suddenly.

664
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:35,944
Damn...l should've
never given you my car.

665
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,479
Look... I've told them
that my car was stolen.

666
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,982
Leave the city.
- Yes.

667
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:44,981
I'll call you back
when things calm down.

668
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:48,420
But till then...just leave the city.
Just leave.

669
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,184
<i>O</i> kaY-

670
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,801
- According to the
Azad Nagar residents...

671
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:06,466
...who were present at the spot,
the driver was a female...

672
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,203
- ...who fled from scene of the incident.

673
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,505
- No one's seen the female's face.

674
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:13,444
- There's a buzz throughout the city...

675
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:17,883
...because the deceased was
MLA Shorey's son, Namit Shorey.

676
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:21,787
- Our correspondent spoke with
MLA Shorey after the incident.

677
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:24,553
This isn't just a loss for my family...

678
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,122
...in fact,
it's a loss for the entire city.

679
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:32,193
- Today it was my son,
but every day in our city...

680
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,858
- From Jammu I started
moving towards Kashmir.

681
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:37,060
- Sometimes I took
the State Transport bus.

682
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,505
- Or hitched a ride...or on foot.

683
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:45,870
- Bad luck isn't ever tied to
a place that you can escape from.

684
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,376
- Bad luck always follows you around.

685
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:52,846
- And the more you try to run from it...

686
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:56,253
- ...the more it keeps coming at you.

687
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,353
Which way are you heading?

688
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,031
Manasar.

689
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,356
You're lucky.

690
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,766
I'm going just there,
I can give you a ride.

691
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,099
Thank you.

692
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,605
Hi, Jaidev Dhanrajgir.

693
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,378
Priya...

694
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:31,549
l...missed my train, and...

695
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:34,887
...my friends have
already reached Manasar.

696
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:37,158
I just have to catch up with them.

697
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:41,863
Shall we?

698
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,631
Thank you.
- Welcome.

699
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:19,132
Now you can meet your
imaginary friends...

700
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,608
...stay in an imaginary hotel...

701
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,308
...and enjoy your imaginary holiday.

702
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,712
What do you mean?

703
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:34,378
You have a cellphone,
but the battery's dead.

704
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:38,691
Which means that you didn't get
an opportunity to recharge it.

705
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,492
This means you were away
from electricity all night.

706
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:45,496
The wet soil on your
jeans has dried up.

707
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:49,799
Which means that you've been
walking though rain-affected areas.

708
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:53,037
And it hasn't rained
for three days in this area.

709
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:57,806
Which means that...you
walked all the way from Jammu.

710
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,682
Designer jeans and latest cellphone.

711
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,581
You're coming from the city
but couldn't bring any money along...

712
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,522
...which is why you're
walking on the road...

713
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,321
...and not travelling by
a private cab or luxury bus.

714
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:16,928
The tattoo on your hand says MJ.

715
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:23,871
And I can't see how 'M' and
'J' can spell Priya in any way.

716
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:32,671
A girl from the metro-city,
without a bag or luggage.

717
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:36,142
And she's lying.

718
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,179
But why?

719
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,621
Because she's running from someone.

720
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,316
Right?

721
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,019
What happens next is up to you.

722
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,801
Either you can try and take care
of yourself in this unfamiliar city...

723
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:58,633
...or trust the person...

724
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:02,808
...who knows so much about you.

725
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:08,244
Give it a thought.

726
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:02,800
This dress belongs to my wife.

727
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:05,970
But I think...

728
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:08,306
...it should fit.

729
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:11,343
You...are married?

730
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,972
Was...

731
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,147
I'm a widower now.

732
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:22,882
Oh...l am so sorry to...

733
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,556
Don't be sorry.

734
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:28,652
I didn't like her anyway.
Sol killed her.

735
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:32,424
What?

736
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,702
Just kidding.

737
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:45,004
The guest room is that way.

738
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,505
For you.

739
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,042
I won't guarantee
that you'll feel relaxed.

740
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:31,818
But it will definitely
make you forget...

741
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,088
how tired you are.

742
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,053
Here you go.

743
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:40,756
Thank you.

744
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,352
Please sit.

745
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:52,005
If you want to charge your phone...

746
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:55,069
...and inform someone
about your whereabouts...

747
01:13:55,398 --> 01:13:57,071
...then, please feel free.

748
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:01,649
Since you already know
so much about me...

749
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,875
...I'm sure that you've guessed that...

750
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:07,511
...there's no one
I would like to call.

751
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,820
So...

752
01:14:51,988 --> 01:15:00,339
"Remove all shyness,
put night in front of your eyes."

753
01:15:00,396 --> 01:15:08,315
"Quench my thirst,
steal the moisture from my lips."

754
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:15,322
"I'm your burning nights and you're
the morning that extinguishes it."

755
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:32,201
"Let me get drenched
in your rain today."

756
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:37,261
"Let me get drenched
in your rain today."

757
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:51,257
Beautiful.

758
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,592
But...

759
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,190
But why are they bottled up?

760
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:01,760
Yes.

761
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:06,337
Because I like caging
beautiful things.

762
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:14,271
"Come and weave
your desires on my lips."

763
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:18,149
"And choose the rest of your wishes."

764
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:23,719
"My bits are all scattered."

765
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:30,725
"Let's tangle our bodies together."

766
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,900
"Set alight the heart once again."

767
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:40,908
"Let me taste your bits."

768
01:16:42,498 --> 01:16:50,349
"I'm your burning nights and you're
the morning that extinguishes it."

769
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:58,989
"Let me get drenched
in your rain today."

770
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:04,081
"Let me get drenched
in your rain today."

771
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,377
Will you marry me?

772
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,183
But before you say yes,
I want you to know...

773
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:27,948
...that my marriage rituals
are a bit different.

774
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:32,823
"Come and make these nights long."

775
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:36,886
"Fill a spark in every cell of mine."

776
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:43,104
"You're devoid of shame."

777
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:49,408
"Place your lips on mine."

778
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:53,470
"Let me cross my limits."

779
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:58,912
"Where should I stop,
please tell me."

780
01:18:01,077 --> 01:18:08,393
"I'm your burning nights and you're
the morning that extinguishes it."

781
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:17,601
"Let me get drenched
in your rain today."

782
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:22,693
"Let me get drenched
in your rain today."

783
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:46,276
You're still awake.

784
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,605
Stay away from me.

785
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:52,419
You're not Jaidev,
you're someone else.

786
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,781
lam your Jaidev.

787
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:58,523
The only difference is that
you now know the truth about me...

788
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,527
...which you never
should have found out.

789
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,454
What is this truth?

790
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:03,553
What were you doing there?

791
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:04,562
Praying-

792
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:08,297
Praying, worshipping,
reveringmbut, not of God.

793
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,402
But of The Devil.

794
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:11,732
What the hell are you talking about?

795
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:14,171
You know exactly
what I am talking about.

796
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,535
You betrayed me.

797
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,305
Why did you hide
this truth from me?

798
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,573
Simple.

799
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:21,844
If you had known the truth about me...

800
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,046
...you wouldn't have stayed.

801
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:25,879
You would've run away.

802
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:30,720
And then I wouldn't have
been able to trap you in my heart.

803
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,990
Where will you go?

804
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:44,170
The police are still looking
for the hit-and-run driver...

805
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:47,540
...who killed the MLA's son.

806
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:53,208
You won't be able to
survive a day out there.

807
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:56,244
Jaidev, I beg you.

808
01:22:56,572 --> 01:23:00,714
I won't tell anyone your secret.
Please let me go, please.

809
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:07,553
Darkness is much more
powerful than the light.

810
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,130
And this power can be yours too.

811
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,529
I don't want this power, let me go.

812
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:17,402
God makes you beg and plead...

813
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,473
...yet He's called Benevolent.

814
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:23,973
He makes children deaf,
dumb, blind, crippled at birth...

815
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,070
...yet He's the symbol of hope.

816
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,313
Right?

817
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,575
Tell me!

818
01:23:28,704 --> 01:23:31,048
He causes earthquakes,
storms, starvation, famines...

819
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,142
...yet He's our protector?

820
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:36,417
If God exists,
why doesn't He do something?

821
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:39,583
Why doesn't he protect women?
Feed the starving?

822
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,525
Because God doesn't exist.

823
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:45,225
The only thing that's real
is the Devil and his power.

824
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:15,828
The doctors at the hospital said...

825
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,922
...Jaidev could never walk again.

826
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,198
He was paralyzed waist down.

827
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:24,528
Instead of trapping me every second...

828
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:27,540
...he was now trapped in his own body.

829
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:30,944
Maybe it was God's way of punishing...

830
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:33,570
...a Devil-worshipper.

831
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:41,210
I knew this was my only
opportunity to get out of here.

832
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:46,524
I had one last thing
to do before I left.

833
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:05,993
I know you want to run away.

834
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:11,034
You want to leave me
trapped in this crippled body.

835
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,801
But I will never let that happen.

836
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:18,405
The letter you're
holding is just a copy.

837
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:22,005
The original is with my lawyer.

838
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:25,884
And it states that my wife hates me...

839
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:28,751
...and she might try to kill me.

840
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:35,923
And if she says that I left,
went missing or suddenly died.

841
01:27:36,552 --> 01:27:41,194
Then it's just her excuse
to hide the truth after killing me.

842
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,870
And I also know that
this girl is a criminal too.

843
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,500
She's fled from Mumbai...

844
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:49,270
...after killing the MLA's
son in a hit-and-run case.

845
01:27:49,531 --> 01:27:54,913
If you find out that she's left,
then consider that I am already dead.

846
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:57,607
I've instructed my lawyers
to open this letter...

847
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:00,845
...if I disappear or die...

848
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,382
...or if you disappear.

849
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:05,719
As far as you are concerned...

850
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:08,794
...my spirit is strong
enough to keep you here.

851
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,994
You and I will live here, forever.

852
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,464
In this hell.

853
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:15,498
Keeping me alive is
now a necessity for you.

854
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:20,401
If I'm found dead, you'll spend
the rest of your life in jail.

855
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:22,675
Won't that be fun?

856
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,071
I've been reading this
letter every day since two years.

857
01:28:42,384 --> 01:28:43,920
I wonder why I thought...

858
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:48,396
...that someone like
me could be lucky enough to find love.

859
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:51,335
Go away, Kabir.

860
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:55,566
Jaidev will never let me leave,
or let you take me away.

861
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,578
I will stay trapped here...forever.

862
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:04,846
No.

863
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:07,048
You're not the only one trapped.

864
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:09,655
I am too, Meera.

865
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:13,554
I've been running from life.

866
01:29:14,616 --> 01:29:19,497
I never completed any relationship,
responsibility or any story.

867
01:29:20,556 --> 01:29:22,934
But I won't run this time.

868
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:27,499
I will take you along,
even if I have to lose my life.

869
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,150
I love you.

870
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,149
I love you, too.

871
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:46,916
If that's the case,
then there's a simple solution for it.

872
01:29:48,317 --> 01:29:51,196
We'll have to perform
the final rites for Jaidev's body.

873
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,261
And then, his soul will
have to leave that house...

874
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:54,959
...along with his body.

875
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,671
No. If we do that, then...

876
01:29:58,927 --> 01:30:01,771
...Jaidev's lawyer will
learn of his disappearance.

877
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:05,003
He'll open the letter
and Meera will be jailed.

878
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,706
I don't have a solution
to that problem.

879
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:12,777
I have an idea.

880
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,221
Kabir, this is no solution.

881
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:20,190
If you're caught you can be jailed.

882
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:21,727
There's no other way.

883
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:23,729
We'll have to deal
with this lawyer first.

884
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,389
Only after that can we
do something about Jaidev.

885
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:28,094
But...how will you find the letter?

886
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:29,863
Once I find my way in his office...

887
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,529
...l have the entire night.

888
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,065
ls that the address?

889
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,205
It's in here.

890
01:30:34,363 --> 01:30:35,740
Shamit Noorie and Sons.

891
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:38,641
34IHussain Street, Srinagar.

892
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:21,580
- Shamit Noorie and Sons,
is a fake name.

893
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:25,555
It's been derived from the boy's name
that died in your hit-in-run accident.

894
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:27,383
Namit Shorey.

895
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:29,959
Shamit Noorie.

896
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,889
I can hear his laughter
resonating in my ears.

897
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:34,896
It sounds like he's saying...

898
01:31:35,424 --> 01:31:40,464
..."l kept you here for
2 years on the basis of a lie".

899
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:43,440
"l fooled you."

900
01:31:43,532 --> 01:31:45,478
Till now Jaidev has won every time.

901
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:47,977
But this game ends tonight.

902
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:49,906
We'll have to take his
body to the crematorium...

903
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:52,008
...and perform his final rites.

904
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:53,953
Then it's all over.

905
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:55,816
Do we have to take him there?

906
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:58,582
What if we burn him here.
- No.

907
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:01,051
We can't just burn him.

908
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:03,959
We've to perform his final
rites according to all the rituals.

909
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:07,030
And that can only be done
at the crematorium.

910
01:32:07,122 --> 01:32:09,932
If we simply burn him his
spirit will still haunt the house.

911
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:12,434
And his body should stay intact...

912
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,336
...until we reach the crematorium.

913
01:32:50,866 --> 01:32:51,970
The engine's overheated.

914
01:32:52,768 --> 01:32:53,746
We need water.

915
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:54,872
But how will we do it.

916
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,609
Meera, if I don't get water then the
engine will stop working.

917
01:32:56,705 --> 01:32:58,616
And we can't take this body on foot.

918
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,485
I noticed a waterfall on the way.

919
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:06,851
I'll do something.

920
01:33:07,482 --> 01:33:08,483
I am scared.

921
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:10,029
Lock the car.

922
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,926
And don't step out at any cost.

923
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:14,700
I'll be right back.

924
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:52,001
Meera!

925
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:01,813
Kabir.

926
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,906
Meera! Meera! Meera!

927
01:35:35,297 --> 01:35:36,435
Meera! What happened?

928
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:37,703
What are you doing here?

929
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:38,744
N---...

930
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,038
N---...

931
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,973
I..
- It's nothing.

932
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,408
Come on.

933
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:47,677
Oh damn.
- Kabir.

934
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,953
Oh damn.

935
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:52,915
Stay here.
- Kabir, be careful.

936
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,837
"Silences.."

937
01:37:23,238 --> 01:37:25,240
"..have a voice."

938
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:29,880
"Come someday to listen to them."

939
01:37:30,712 --> 01:37:35,525
"They will blossom after touching you."

940
01:37:35,817 --> 01:37:40,266
"Call them home someday."

941
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:46,029
"They are restless to speak."

942
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:52,076
"Let them speak."

943
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:57,282
"Silences.."

944
01:37:57,505 --> 01:38:02,147
"..our silences."

945
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:07,057
"Silences.."

946
01:38:07,148 --> 01:38:14,896
"..these gripping silences."

947
01:38:38,713 --> 01:38:45,927
"Have you ever passed through a lane?"

948
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:55,535
"Where no one has passed through ages?"

949
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:05,473
"My time has stopped there."

950
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:15,827
"How should I express
what all happened with me."

951
01:39:18,219 --> 01:39:20,563
"Silences.."

952
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:23,030
"..are like a musical instrument."

953
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:27,398
"Bring some tune.."

954
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:32,869
"Silences are like words."

955
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:37,681
"Come and hum them someday."

956
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:43,546
"They're restless to speak.."

957
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:49,721
"Let them speak."

958
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:54,857
"Silences.."

959
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:59,871
"..our silences."

960
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:04,707
"Silences.."

961
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:09,737
"..these gripping silences."

962
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:14,844
"Silences.."

963
01:40:14,909 --> 01:40:19,756
"..our silences."

964
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:24,694
"Silences.."

965
01:40:24,753 --> 01:40:32,399
"..these gripping silences."

966
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,234
Kabir!

967
01:41:08,029 --> 01:41:09,235
Meera.

968
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:11,074
Meera!

969
01:41:12,433 --> 01:41:14,037
Kabir!

970
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,079
Meera!

971
01:41:27,782 --> 01:41:29,557
Help me, Kabir!-

972
01:41:29,951 --> 01:41:30,895
Meera!

973
01:41:30,952 --> 01:41:31,896
Meera!

974
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:33,693
Meera!

975
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:36,201
Meera!
- Help me!

976
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:40,697
- Kabir!

977
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:45,410
Meera.

978
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,377
Now I get it.

979
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:28,214
This is not a painting, it's a door.

980
01:42:29,277 --> 01:42:32,781
And only they can use it, not you.

981
01:42:34,048 --> 01:42:36,961
It's a portal.
- What nonsense is this?

982
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,153
lam not like you.

983
01:43:02,577 --> 01:43:05,421
I'm from the world of spirits.

984
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,422
The world behind this painting.

985
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:09,917
Oh my, God.

986
01:43:10,018 --> 01:43:11,895
We have to save Meera, Kabir.

987
01:43:13,254 --> 01:43:14,733
There isn't much time.

988
01:43:16,724 --> 01:43:18,863
There are seven levels
between heaven and hell.

989
01:43:19,327 --> 01:43:20,738
You see these seven nails.

990
01:43:21,329 --> 01:43:22,740
Each one represents a level.

991
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,537
Jaidev's spirit will
have to manifest himself...

992
01:43:26,267 --> 01:43:27,974
...in this butterfly from
whichever level he's hiding.

993
01:43:29,604 --> 01:43:31,743
And...what's this ash for?

994
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:33,517
It's Jaidev's.

995
01:43:33,574 --> 01:43:35,076
If his ashes unite with his soul...

996
01:43:35,977 --> 01:43:40,949
...then he'll have to abide
by the rules of this world.

997
01:43:41,282 --> 01:43:42,920
He will have to leave this world...

998
01:43:44,418 --> 01:43:46,728
...and depart with his cremated body.

999
01:43:48,256 --> 01:43:50,202
As soon as the
butterfly comes alive...

1000
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:54,070
...you have to pour
this ash-water over it.

1001
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:56,130
The body and soul will be one again...

1002
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:59,309
...and Meera will be
free from Jaidev's captivity.

1003
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:42,672
Every place where there's my blood..

1004
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,635
..my form will appear there.

1005
01:46:46,834 --> 01:46:48,370
But you have only one form.

1006
01:46:50,004 --> 01:46:51,642
How long will you remain alive?

1007
01:51:12,366 --> 01:51:14,277
Jaidev's dying form..

1008
01:51:14,335 --> 01:51:17,316
..was heading towards
the painting to become re-alive.

1009
01:51:17,805 --> 01:51:19,011
Then I understood.

1010
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,020
"that there was only one solution
to defeat Jaidev.

1011
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,181
I should drink his
blood and become Jaidev.

1012
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:29,885
So, either the hatred will win..

1013
01:51:30,651 --> 01:51:31,561
..or love.

1014
01:52:22,002 --> 01:52:25,347
Meera belongs to Jaidev.

1015
01:52:33,113 --> 01:52:34,183
Kabir, help me.

1016
01:52:34,281 --> 01:52:37,319
Silence.

1017
01:52:37,384 --> 01:52:39,295
Help me.

1018
01:52:41,188 --> 01:52:42,963
Kabir.

1019
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:47,636
Silence.

1020
01:52:48,462 --> 01:52:50,305
Kabir.

1021
01:53:26,767 --> 01:53:32,877
Silence.

1022
01:53:36,443 --> 01:53:41,324
Silence.

1023
01:54:11,778 --> 01:54:14,156
- 'Meera was finally
freed from her captivity.'

1024
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:17,292
- 'I kept my promise to her.'

1025
01:54:20,554 --> 01:54:21,658
Meera is alive today.

1026
01:54:22,623 --> 01:54:24,261
She did me a big favour...

1027
01:54:24,325 --> 01:54:25,827
...by accepting my love.

1028
01:54:26,994 --> 01:54:28,871
She's the reason
I completed this story.

1029
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:32,434
She completed me with her love.

1030
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:38,206
"Khamoshiyan"
(Silences).

1031
01:54:39,106 --> 01:54:41,143
Silences still surround me even today.

1032
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:43,779
But filled with peace and serenity.

1033
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,315
With happiness and joy.

1034
01:54:48,215 --> 01:54:49,888
"Khamoshiyan"
(Silences).

1035
01:54:56,290 --> 01:54:58,702
"Silences.."

1036
01:54:58,792 --> 01:55:01,136
"..are like a musical instrument."

1037
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:05,506
"Bring some tune.."

1038
01:55:06,133 --> 01:55:11,105
"Silences are like words."

1039
01:55:11,171 --> 01:55:15,415
"Come and hum them someday."

1040
01:55:16,544 --> 01:55:21,516
"They're restless to speak.."

1041
01:55:21,615 --> 01:55:27,622
"Let them speak."

1042
01:55:27,687 --> 01:55:29,963
"Silences.."

1043
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:32,697
I think we should let
them enjoy themselves...

1044
01:55:32,793 --> 01:55:34,534
...and we should slip out.

1045
01:55:34,862 --> 01:55:36,808
Why? It's your party.

1046
01:55:37,264 --> 01:55:40,711
Madam, if we don't leave...

1047
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:43,037
then how can we begin a new story?

1048
01:55:43,136 --> 01:55:45,844
"These gripping-y

1049
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:50,718
Let's go?
- "Silences."

1050
01:56:14,001 --> 01:56:21,078
"The water of the river also flows
silently here."

1051
01:56:23,911 --> 01:56:30,260
"In this shining moonlight,
there are millions of silences."

1052
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:42,873
"Even the raindrops have no speech."

1053
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:51,305
"In the burning hearts,
there's a silent rising smoke."

1054
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:58,646
"Silences are like the skies."

1055
01:56:58,712 --> 01:57:03,593
"Come someday to fly in them."

1056
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:08,429
"Silences are like emotions."

1057
01:57:08,755 --> 01:57:13,795
"Can you feel them?"

1058
01:57:13,894 --> 01:57:19,071
"They are restless to speak."

1059
01:57:19,133 --> 01:57:25,140
"Let them speak."

1060
01:57:25,238 --> 01:57:30,278
"Silences.."

1061
01:57:30,343 --> 01:57:35,292
"Our silences."

1062
01:57:35,349 --> 01:57:40,094
"Silences.."

1063
01:57:40,153 --> 01:57:45,227
"These gripping silences."

1064
01:57:45,292 --> 01:57:50,173
"Silences.."

1065
01:57:50,264 --> 01:57:55,179
"Our silences."

1066
01:57:55,269 --> 01:58:00,116
