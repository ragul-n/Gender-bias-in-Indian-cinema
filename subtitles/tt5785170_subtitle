2
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,652
The Father of our Nation, Mahatma Gandhi
wasn't just the first 'Satyagrahi'...

3
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,416
but, also the first
'cleanliness activist' too.

4
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,787
Even though it's been 100 years
since Champaran Satyagraha...

5
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,416
we still couldn't get rid of
the filth in our country.

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,221
But now, under the leadership of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi...

7
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,921
Gandhiji's dream of clean India
will become a reality...

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,725
on his 150 birth anniversary,
that is 2nd October, 2019.

9
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,732
This is our small
contribution to his campaign.

10
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,131
Our heartfelt
homage to Gandhiji.

11
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,536
Once she starts insisting,
there's no way to turn her down.

12
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,567
You just can't say no to her.

13
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,306
So why don't you go
for a third one?

14
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,246
I am not Farah Khan.

15
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,644
She's already had triplets.

16
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,845
But here, keep continue...

17
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,218
And if you're so fascinated by the idea
then why don't you try for another one?

18
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,413
Forget it...

19
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,522
I've my hands full with
one 'Ninja Hattori'.

20
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,623
By the way, Chulni, how is
your mother-in-law's knee?

21
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,958
It's as good as new.

22
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,193
No wonder she's been racking
her brains a lot recently.

23
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,736
My mother-in-law has
lost her marbles.

24
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,550
She makes me slog over the
sewing machine all day.

25
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,160
I see...

26
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,198
Well, speaking of machines, I've heard
Neelam goes on and on like a machine.

27
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,142
What have you been feeding
your husband these days?

28
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,109
Tell us too.

29
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,737
She can't stop smiling.

30
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,043
- Tell us too.
- Spill it out.

31
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,052
Our husbands fall
flat on the bed...

32
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,111
as if they were moving
mountains all day.

33
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,815
Tell us...

34
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,456
Where did you find
this magical herb?

35
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,823
Tell us.

36
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,427
Tell us.

37
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,562
Oh, my... where did
you get that done?

38
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,332
Well, last month he took me
to Delhi... for sight-seeing.

39
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,902
We must get one soon too.

40
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,500
Normally, men get us pregnant
and then forget all about us.

41
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,844
Listen to my
mother-in-law? But why?

42
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,648
She just needs a reason...

43
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,480
You'll get a stomach-ache...

44
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,259
Who is he?

45
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,192
<i>Oh, WW''-</i>

46
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,434
That rascal intentionally
flashed his light on us.

47
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,837
- You are right.
- Rascal.

48
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,649
No, you go, I can't come?

49
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,784
Sonu has made a mess at home.

50
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,549
Hey madam, won't
you let me pass?

51
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,257
If I flash my dipper
now, you'll get furious.

52
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,133
Keep flashing your
dipper now. Rascal.

53
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,769
- Jaya...
- You taught him a good lesson.

54
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,138
- Bye.
- Bye.

55
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:01,256
''There are many
beautiful girls..''

56
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,259
''But all eyes staring at you..''

57
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,261
Oh my, God! Oh my, God!

58
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,667
''But what do I say about me..
Even the moon praises me..''

59
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,226
Is someone going to lower the
volume of the television?

60
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,433
It's pointless...

61
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:20,844
''Oh my baby doll of gold..''
''Oh my baby doll of gold..''

62
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:27,409
''Oh my baby doll of gold..''
''Oh my baby doll of gold..''

63
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,613
Kakka... you won't
see more that way.

64
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,749
Actually, son, I can see more.

65
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,393
My number has increased.

66
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,527
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

67
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,496
- Kakka, let me take a look.
- No.

68
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,022
- Just once... only once...
- I said...

69
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,968
I hope you can see
all big and clear.

70
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,368
Vidya, you just broke
our concentration.

71
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,368
Scenes like these... makes
it a 'good morning'.

72
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,240
Jagdish, my son... why did
you change the channel?

73
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,371
- Why did you change the channel?
- Yes, why did you?

74
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,642
If he can watch it in front
of his daughter-in-law...

75
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,671
then you can also watch it in
front of your young daughter.

76
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,278
She watches it on her
mobile, he on the computer.

77
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,783
<i>And I watch it on the TV...</i>

78
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,550
Instead we should all
watch it together.

79
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,922
Why not? Let's forget all shame.

80
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:09,926
- Listen Sunny...
- Huh?

81
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,894
- I mean... what's her name?
- Vidya?

82
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,056
Listen Vidya, I may
have a dirty mind.

83
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,463
But I have a clean heart.

84
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,296
And... one of the
most religious''

85
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,065
and cultured country in the world
has one of the largest population.

86
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,040
Kakka I had.. no
contribution in it.

87
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,269
I only have one daughter.

88
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,468
And for a fact, she's
so pampered...

89
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,410
that she's still studying when
she should've settled down.

90
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,674
Haven't you seen kakka's
Japanese degrees?

91
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,408
Yeah.

92
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,811
It's only natural for some of his talents
to rub off on his granddaughter.

93
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,753
I wonder what good are these
Japanese degrees in agriculture.

94
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,947
No one even knows
what's written on them.

95
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,321
- And you know.
- You're spoiling our daughter.

96
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,018
- Me?
- Stop all this right now!

97
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,357
Don't you have any shame?

98
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,526
''Fair boys... fair boys...''

99
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,761
Sunny, again?

100
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,392
Not you''.

101
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,772
''I sway my hips and dance. I
wear my earrings and dance.''

102
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,105
Is it her birthday today?

103
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,673
You're going to look stunning
in your wedding dress.

104
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,417
Even you'll look quite
appealing in your suit.

105
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,322
Keshav, why do you keep playing
with my thumb all the time?

106
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,086
Can't help it, baby. That's as
far as I am destined to get.

107
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,059
Never imagined we'll he getting
married on the same day...

108
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,760
hut to different people.

109
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,998
Naru's calling. Here.

110
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,472
- Yeah, go on.
- Radhe-Radhe, brother.

111
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,506
Only five more minutes before
the Auspicious time to start.

112
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,873
Are you planning
on starting a war?

113
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,708
The bride's family is waiting.

114
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,750
Be quiet... you make it sound like
I am marrying Mallika Sherawat.

115
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,150
Doesn't matter... at least
she has the same name.

116
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,710
You see... the wedding cards
have been distributed...

117
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,585
guests have arrived and the
procession is ready to leave.

118
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,114
So... where are you?

119
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,318
- Naru.
- Yes.

120
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,383
Is that Keshav?

121
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,723
Tell him, if we miss
this auspicious day...

122
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,630
the next auspicious date
comes only after <i>36</i> years.

123
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
Tell him.

124
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,933
I'm sure you heard everything.

125
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,604
Tell him... I'm going
through a break-up.

126
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,730
This will take time.

127
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,972
So... what are your plans
for your wedding night?

128
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,338
What about you?

129
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,640
Don't forget to take the
glass of milk on time.

130
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,773
Forget it...

131
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,380
Your beloved wife will bring
an entire milk dairy with her.

132
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,680
Well, then I'll send you all
the cottage-cheese you want.

133
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,889
My God, cottage cheese
makes you blush.

134
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,954
I wonder what you'll
do if I say cream?

135
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,760
Well, that's the end
of this love-story.

136
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,703
Now go marry your groom.

137
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,499
I wish you had mustered some
courage to talk to your father...

138
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,202
then you would he
getting married to me.

139
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,539
And not with that Mallika.

140
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,010
Doesn't matter... we both
had our share of fun.

141
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,016
We had some really good
time together, right.

142
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,144
Listen... we'll keep meeting even
after the wedding, won't we?

143
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,912
After the wedding... never!

144
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:51,888
I have a strict policy...

145
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,721
Never fiddle around with
someone's television or wife...

146
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,021
You'll get the shock
of your life.

147
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,494
Oh my boy of principles.

148
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,065
Are you going to post your
wedding photos on Facebook?

149
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,497
I will, sis...

150
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,202
Get lost. Go marry
that milk-maid.

151
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,649
Radhe-Radhe, brother. Brother,
father is very furious.

152
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,945
Then ask father to sit
at the dais in my place.

153
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,877
Guess you're in a
had mood today.

154
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,251
But this is amazing...

155
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,753
You give those girls
driving lessons, but...

156
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,349
they switch partners when
they need a permanent driver.

157
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,758
You know what, the day I
find my kind of girl...

158
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,593
I swear I will rattle
Panditji's world.

159
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,165
You can say anything
you like out here.

160
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,464
Because you can't say a
word in front of father.

161
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,829
Come, brother. Time to suit up.

162
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,439
Sister-in-law Mallika
beckons you.

163
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,503
''Mallika is all grown up...''

164
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,473
''like a dairy of milk.''

165
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,916
[CHANTING PRAYER]

166
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,697
Come, Sister-in-law.

167
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,941
He's Manglik.

168
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,942
Plus, the planets and stars in
his birth-chart are unfavorable.

169
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,274
Only this Buffalo can
save his life now.

170
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,347
Congratulations.

171
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,680
Finally, there's some hope
for Keshav to get married.

172
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,751
Only when we find someone with
two thumbs on her left hand...

173
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,984
can he get married?

174
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,525
- I see?
- Yes...

175
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,562
Bless you. Bless you two.

176
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,600
Great...

177
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,004
That's called moving up in life.

178
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,904
From Mallika the Buffalo to
Mallika the sister-in-law.

179
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,433
Congratulations, brother Keshav.

180
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,958
Naru!

181
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,659
- Naru.
- Yes.

182
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,365
- Where are you, you numbskull?
- Coming, father.

183
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,938
Have you got ants
in your pant...

184
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,839
that you're running
around like this. Huh!

185
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,969
The shipment hasn't arrived yet.

186
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,378
Well, father, we've already
placed an order for cycle chains.

187
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,576
Brother and I will catch a train and
go buy those tubes for the cycles.

188
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,553
The accounts are in a mess.

189
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,445
It's hard to believe
there's a discrepancy...

190
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,321
on brother Keshav's
watch, father.

191
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,756
Really? Where is your brother?

192
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,527
Enjoying his honeymoon?

193
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,593
- Tell him.
- Yes, father.

194
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,204
This week I will
sit in the shop...

195
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,230
Chandu will take an off, and
you two will do the cooking.

196
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,173
Okay father...

197
00:14:58,998 --> 00:14:59,999
But father...

198
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,015
- Radhe-Radhe, brother.
- Radhe-Radhe.

199
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,084
Cooking bread, are you?

200
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,622
You know what, I can't see
you in this predicament.

201
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,424
Should I call
sister-in-law instead?

202
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,758
She will cook bread for you.

203
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,427
You're pulling my
leg, aren't you?

204
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,734
You see... your
sister-in-law has solved...

205
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,935
- half the problems in my birth-chart.
- Yes.

206
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,237
I've 50% chances of
getting married now.

207
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,880
Now just wait and watch when I bring
a beautiful and smart wife, like me.

208
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,982
I'll even cook bread for her.

209
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,518
And you'll he fuming
with jealousy.

210
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,743
Let's not get so far
ahead of ourselves.

211
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,912
Did you forget about
father's second condition?

212
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,754
Where will you find
someone with two thumbs?

213
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,325
Will she descend from the sky?

214
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,524
Take my advice, brother.

215
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,826
Forsake all hopes
of getting married.

216
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,565
And you should mourn instead.

217
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,033
Even the children of your friends
are now going to school.

218
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,564
And you couldn't even find one.

219
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,773
It's not your cup of tea.

220
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,368
You're going to
die a bachelor...

221
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:08,705
That's the limit.

222
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,405
Can't we brothers
talk in private?

223
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,710
Why does sister-in-law keep
getting offended all the time?

224
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,051
- Uncle, move aside.
- Yes, dear.

225
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,147
Everyone's standing in the way.

226
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,680
I'll just make a quick
visit to the toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

227
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,919
I'm coming too.

228
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,555
- Yuck...
- What happened?

229
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,928
At least let me pee
in peace, madam.

230
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,629
Disgusting people why
can't they lock the door?

231
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,760
Men think why should
we lock the door?

232
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,770
Real maturity is about
peeing with the doors open.

233
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,772
- No shame at all.
- Right...

234
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,569
They knew the door was open...

235
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,336
hut thought it was against
their pride to knock.

236
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,935
Wouldn't you call
that impolite, Naru?

237
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,379
This isn't your house's main
door that we need to knock?

238
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,643
Of course not, it's a garden...

239
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,648
where you can take
a stroll freely.

240
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,980
Hey brother, talk to me.

241
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,043
Get it?

242
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,935
What are you staring at?
I am talking to you.

243
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,432
Hey, brother...

244
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,498
Call me rude, but don't
call me brother.

245
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,835
Look at your age.

246
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,845
Are you going to teach
this to your children too?

247
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,242
How can I have kids?

248
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,947
I am still a bachelor.

249
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,241
I see... no wonder.

250
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,819
No wonder he looks so desperate.

251
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:24,747
Move.

252
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,120
I said move.

253
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,623
You didn't even wash
your hands. Yuck.

254
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,967
She just publicly
humiliated you.

255
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,197
Doesn't matter, Naru.

256
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,033
It's my fault, so I
must pay the price.

257
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,143
What a big heart?

258
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,587
I washed my hands.

259
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,617
Are you crazy?

260
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,255
He just splashed
water in my eye.

261
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,585
Crazy man.

262
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,096
Hey...

263
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,626
''May no one throw
stones, at my lover..''

264
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,703
Come, the station has
arrived. Let's go.

265
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,148
Great... you're here.

266
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,688
- Here you go, Uncle.
- Get down.

267
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,621
- Your cycle has arrived.
- Okay.

268
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,853
On-time delivery.

269
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,286
Bravo...

270
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,120
Did the blunder. What is this?

271
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:41,922
What happened, uncle?

272
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,500
I asked for Sunny Leone...

273
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,058
hut you got me Sunny
Deol instead.

274
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,294
Did he ask for a lady's cycle?

275
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,504
I don't remember. Maybe...

276
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,973
What do you mean you
can't remember?

277
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,271
- Check the order again.
- We're checking, again.

278
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,140
Please do.

279
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,405
No need to worry, uncle.

280
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,880
You must have a saw at home.

281
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,015
- Just cut off that middle rod.
- That's right.

282
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,416
- And it will he a lady's cycle.
- Right.

283
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,388
And uncle, you can use that rod
to drive away the monkeys.

284
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,422
Get on...

285
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,924
- That's no way to do business.
- This is how we do it.

286
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,392
Listen... Radhe Cycle,
this isn't right.

287
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,396
- Get lost.
- I will not spare you.

288
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,296
Brother, it's that way.
What are you doing?

289
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,264
What's going on?

290
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,898
Attending to the customer.

291
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,631
Come on... get the saw.

292
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,035
We'll cut off that rod.

293
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,577
What made you change your mind?

294
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,646
- You were leaving.
- What's going on here?

295
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,878
Did you buy a new cycle for me?

296
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,508
I thought I'll give
you a surprise.

297
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,845
But these guys from
Radhe Cycle...

298
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,045
- Listen.
- Yes.

299
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,452
I've found that thief who's
been stealing our clothes.

300
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,251
Coming.

301
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,450
It's amazing.

302
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,884
Well, it was supposed
to he a lady's cycle...

303
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,950
hut we mixed up the order...

304
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,518
Why are you going off-track now?

305
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,695
You?

306
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,425
The rude guy from the bathroom.

307
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,764
No, I'm the cycle guy.

308
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,666
Your father ordered
a lady's cycle...

309
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,673
hut we got a gents
cycle instead.

310
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,501
Doesn't matter.

311
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,270
This one's a gents cycle,
isn't it? I'll keep it.

312
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,276
How can you keep it?

313
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,677
- It's our fault, we'll fix it.
- What do you mean?

314
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,943
I like this design,
I'll keep this one.

315
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,084
This isn't a joke. How are
you going to ride this?

316
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,449
There's a rod in the middle.

317
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,976
- Hey, Radhe Cycle...
- Keshav.

318
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,554
Whatever your name is?

319
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,248
Try to keep an open mind,
not the bathroom's door.

320
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,758
For your kind information...

321
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,328
what did women wear when
cycles were invented in 1860?

322
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,528
Dresses.

323
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,292
And the rod in the middle was
removed for their safety.

324
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,665
And what do we wear now?

325
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,434
- What?
- Jeans.

326
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,797
So the rod doesn't matter.

327
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,071
Her general knowledge
is better than yours.

328
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,703
Doesn't matter... she's a female.
You spoke really well, madam.

329
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,707
But after 1860, in 1885
came safety cycles...

330
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,610
which had a chain
and peddle as well.

331
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,481
Ladies got their freedom
of movement after that.

332
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,010
Great...

333
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,690
- Yes, but...
- I'm on your side, madam.

334
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,914
I don't differentiate
between ladies and gents.

335
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,516
That's why I prefer trains.

336
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,120
There are no separate toilets
for ladies and gents.

337
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,326
- But you must lock them.
- Of course.

338
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,028
Whether it's a ladies or gents.

339
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,936
Well, that's enough
lesson for one day.

340
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,771
No... please go on,
I am loving it.

341
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,966
Jaya, what happened?

342
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,169
What's wrong? You're still here.

343
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,875
Well, uncle, I was
just leaving...

344
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,708
Jaya got me talking.

345
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,281
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

346
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:15,910
Okay, uncle...

347
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,578
Hold it.

348
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,484
If you ever have a problem,
just give me a call.

349
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,148
Yes.

350
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,951
My personal mobile number is
written behind this cycle.

351
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,756
- Give it to your entire family.
- Yes.

352
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,988
- I forgot to shift gears.
- Yes.

353
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,498
See you... Okay.

354
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,524
Papa...

355
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,771
Brother... it's falling...

356
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,298
What are you doing? Can't you
see through those glasses?

357
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,654
What happened?

358
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,894
What happened?

359
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,056
Is that her or am I
imagining things?

360
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:04,764
That's her alright?

361
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,365
She's a topper.

362
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,170
Don't even think about her.

363
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,940
Do you have the number of
Kanhaiyya, the computer guy?

364
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,578
Yes will get it.

365
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:29,783
''Since the day we met...''

366
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:34,795
''I can't stop smiling.''

367
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:43,488
''I keep telling
everyone... I see.''

368
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:54,398
''Stay away from this fantasy
or life will he doomed.''

369
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,817
''Quit smiling, silly..''
- Brother, give me tea.

370
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,519
''Or I'll fall in love.''
- Madam, tea.

371
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:07,258
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

372
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,962
Bloody thief.

373
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,938
Hello. How are you, Vasudev?

374
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,110
Where are you?

375
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,545
Madam, what's the time?

376
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,140
- 9:00.
- Thank you.

377
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,108
Yes.

378
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:31,378
''I used to feel... love's
too far-fetched for me...''

379
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,582
“...because I had no dreams.“

380
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:38,686
''But since we met, I feel
a little unrestrained.''

381
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:44,060
''I feel like I'm
lost in your eyes.''

382
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,936
''Like sandalwood gets
dissolved in water.''

383
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,496
She has only five fingers.

384
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,336
''The heart's willing
to do anything.''

385
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,467
Move.

386
00:23:55,968 --> 00:24:01,111
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

387
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:06,019
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

388
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:11,688
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

389
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,057
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

390
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,732
- Jaya.
- Yes.

391
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,499
Isn't that you?

392
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,633
Why that...

393
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,072
Where is he?

394
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,608
Where's that bloody Radhe cycle?

395
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,641
Why»-

396
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,972
Who do you think you are?

397
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,878
Kuldeep, get a cup
of tea for ma'am.

398
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:33,948
YES: ma 'a m?

399
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,347
With whose permission
did you put that up?

400
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,953
With whose permission did
you take my picture?

401
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,383
You think you're smart?

402
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,115
I'll shut down Radhe
Cycles for good.

403
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:44,355
Cancel the tea, get a cold drink.
Calm down, madam, calm down.

404
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:47,227
You're a topper. I really
care about education.

405
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,957
It's just a marketing strategy.

406
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,534
I swear since we put your face on the
hoarding, sales have gone up 8%.

407
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,162
And it's also sending a
message to the girls.

408
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,672
Whatever... I didn't top my
class to increase your sales.

409
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,076
- I know...
- Then know this.

410
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,911
If you don't take all the
posters down by tomorrow...

411
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,411
you will he in big trouble.

412
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,146
Moron!

413
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,322
Madam, you... forgot your phone.

414
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,326
As well as my mobile
number in it.

415
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,298
Yes, Anu.

416
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,063
Brother, I did exactly
like you said.

417
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,193
But that Jeetu is
terrified of his father.

418
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,171
He says he won't elope with me.

419
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,941
Did he lose a leg?

420
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,737
Why won't he elope with you?

421
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,345
Of course, he will.

422
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,045
Get two tickets for
Gorakhpur Express. Yeah...

423
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,616
Pack your bags and get
to the station tonight.

424
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,980
I'll handle the rest.

425
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,487
- But will Jeetu show up?
- Give me my phone.

426
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:46,713
Give me my phone.

427
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,185
You're such a disgusting man.

428
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,659
You're advising
someone to run away.

429
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,356
- Who are you talking to, brother?
- Hold on.

430
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,788
She's my cousin.

431
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,391
Whether I give her my advice, or
anything else why does it matter to you?

432
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,501
- Anu.
- Mad.

433
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:04,303
- Yes, brother.
- From Gorakhpur head straight to Nepal.

434
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,200
Nepal?

435
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,540
Nepal is an amazing place.
Economical, reliable and realistic.

436
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,409
- I'll send you money from my mobile.
- But, brother...

437
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,278
Listen, sis, India is a
lot more advanced now.

438
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,885
Radhe-Radhe... take care.

439
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,112
Very good.

440
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,748
The brother inside you suddenly wakes
up and sacrifices your own sister.

441
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,824
How is it right to run
from your problems?

442
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,653
This is the best
advice right now.

443
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:26,822
This thinking...

444
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,355
This thinking... has
doomed this country.

445
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,293
If you have the guts
to love someone...

446
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,894
you should he man enough to
admit it to your family.

447
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:38,205
Look, madam, their family
only has hatred and anger.

448
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,443
Because it doesn't take
time to hate someone...

449
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,537
hut, takes time to
understand love.

450
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:48,646
Soon the hatred will resolve until
then, let them enjoy their honeymoon.

451
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:52,319
Our thinking is so different.

452
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,922
No, it's not.

453
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,291
You're saying 'talk to the
family', I am saying 'run away'..

454
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,523
''But we're both on
the side of love.

455
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:00,727
Crazy...

456
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,430
You're crazy.

457
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,559
Madam, listen...

458
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,998
It's quite late,
I'll drop you home.

459
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,765
No need for that.

460
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,267
I swear I won't elope with you.

461
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:12,965
I can go myself.

462
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,403
Oh God, she's so
fluent in English.

463
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,720
Look straight... Stop ogling.

464
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,314
''Just like one needs
to breathe...''

465
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,018
''Just like one needs
to breathe...''

466
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,529
''to stay alive.''

467
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:12,602
''All I need is a sweetheart...''

468
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,329
''for falling in love.''

469
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,736
''All I need is a sweetheart...''

470
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,075
''for a massage.''

471
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,181
Hey, brother, you're in
a colorful mood today.

472
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,479
Guess Holi isn't too far.

473
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,981
By the way, brother, it's
your first Holi post wedding.

474
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,989
What color will you
put on sister-in-law?

475
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,388
Every color's going to suit her.

476
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,016
Radhe-Radhe... You're
in love, brother.

477
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,497
Don't get emotional and
pull her on your hike.

478
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,295
Just watch, she will definitely
sit on my Honda some day.

479
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,128
My advice is... load her on a truck and
take her to see Agra's, Taj Mahal.

480
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,762
I can build a Taj Mahal for her.

481
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,507
Oh brother, now
that's happy Holi.

482
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,668
Sister-in-law's grown young.

483
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,738
She's become a dairy...

484
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,542
Are you crazy?

485
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,177
Are you crazy?

486
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,486
You just ruined my mood.

487
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:06,554
Get lost.

488
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,458
I only said milk...

489
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:11,918
No, enough.

490
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,224
Wow, dear...

491
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,998
That's a really cheap ringtone?

492
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,670
Who is calling?

493
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,529
Don't ask, mom.

494
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,006
- My phone fell in the drain.
- I see...

495
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,406
I want to change your
mother's ringtone as well.

496
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:34,017
Are you listening? He wants
to throw you down the drain.

497
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:35,918
Pass me the salad.

498
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,013
Hey, brother, you're brushing
your teeth a lot today.

499
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,883
Just refreshing my breath.

500
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,519
I'm washing my underwear and
you're refreshing your breath.

501
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,189
That's what you're good for.

502
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,040
Brother... goggles, deodorant...

503
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,210
- What are you preparing for?
- It's a lover's parade...

504
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,379
Should he grand.

505
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,057
[FOLK SONG]

506
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,477
[FOLK SONG]

507
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,994
[FOLK SONG]

508
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,504
It should he stopped now.

509
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,731
Who heats their
husband like this?

510
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,239
They are simply venting their
anger on these poor souls.

511
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,878
Look at their condition.

512
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,472
Fine, then you don't
heat your husband.

513
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,444
I will never...

514
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:15,674
Look, there''.

515
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,084
Hold on.. wait.. wait..

516
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,323
Brother, thank God we
didn't get married.

517
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,364
Look at the size
of their sticks.

518
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:33,100
The men in our country hate
the idea of apologizing.

519
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,331
They certainly deserve this.

520
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,396
Hold on, aunty...

521
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,338
Coming through...
coming through...

522
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,310
- Oh my, God.
- He's flat on the ground.

523
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,882
- Hey.. Radhe.
- Don't heat him.

524
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,753
Look there... there...

525
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,087
So brother... no. 19.

526
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,092
No...

527
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,656
No. 1.

00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,437
Listen...

531
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,067
I need to talk to her
today at any cost.

532
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,307
Okay.

534
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,585
It's Holi!

535
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,288
She will he here...
She will he here...

She will he here soon... She
will he here... he patient.

00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,101
She's here... she's here.

538
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,232
''My holi..

539
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,507
She is looking this way.

540
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,804
Even her friend's good looking.

541
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,004
When she comes here,
you guys leave.

542
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,936
She is still standing there.

543
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,115
She's here... she's here.

544
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,515
Tell her everything today.

545
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,412
Are you done yet?

546
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,450
Chasing me around.

547
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,114
Your friends even teased
you taking my name.

548
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,260
You've been staring
at me all this time.

549
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,588
You must he getting a kick
out of it, don't you?

550
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,425
Are you done ogling at me?

551
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,895
Satisfied now?

552
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,758
You boys think it's
right to ogle at girls?

553
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:16,101
Huh? Look at me, I
am talking to you!

554
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,366
All this doesn't suit
you. Look at your age.

555
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,976
Don't you get it?

556
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,303
There can never he
anything between us.

557
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,946
- Madam.
- What?

558
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:32,119
It's already
happened between us.

559
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,287
But you can't see it, or
maybe you're ignoring it.

560
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,985
You're the one
ignoring reality...

561
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,493
There's a big
difference between us.

562
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,429
DO You get it?

563
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:47,461
I am just a college pass-out but my
GK's better than anyone out here.

564
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,833
I am a Pandit's (PRIEST) son,
but I eat eggs after praying.

565
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:57,069
I maybe over-age but, no kid in
this village can heat me in a race.

566
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,975
From my sunglasses to my
t-shirt, everything is a fake...

567
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:02,713
hut I'm still pretty
rustic at heart!

568
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,917
Now you decide whether you
want to tie the knot with..

569
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,923
some ordinary IAS,
doctor or engineer...

570
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,117
or are you looking for
some romance in life.

571
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:10,892
And yes...

572
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,353
Let me tell you one
thing honestly.

573
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,297
Since the day I saw you...

574
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,304
I decided that I'll stand up
against the whole world for you!

575
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,141
And about following
you around...

576
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,441
Here you go...

577
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,079
I've deleted my number.

578
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,550
From your phone
and mine as well.

579
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,385
Goodbye. Let's go.

580
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,749
Bro, you were great today.

581
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,091
Bro, you were amazing today.

582
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:04,394
''Feels like these days, I've been
capriciously riding the waves.''

583
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:15,072
''And never leave without watching
my reflection in your eyes.''

584
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:26,183
''How do I stay away from your thoughts
you're the only one I think about.''

585
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:33,972
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

586
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,048
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

587
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,477
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

588
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:50,387
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

589
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,257
Take these tires,
when the customers...

590
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,078
Hey, Radhe Cycle.

591
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,975
Your nameplate's fallen
off. Put it hack.

592
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:19,384
If something's wrong with my
cycle where am I going to call?

593
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,651
If you can take it off, then
you can put it hack too.

594
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:25,094
You didn't have to come all
the way here for that.

595
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,125
Leave.

596
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:32,202
I may have studied BCA but, my
GK isn't better than yours.

597
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,464
I'm a Joshi's girl, but
I ride gents cycle.

598
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,564
From head to toe, I
am completely rustic''

599
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,666
''but my thinking's
completely modern.

600
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,899
Now you decide...

601
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,502
whether you want to tie the knot with
some ordinary, homely girl or...

602
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,845
do you want some
romance in life?

603
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:54,355
Sudhir... put the radium
nameplate on madam's cycle...

604
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,053
so that my number glitters
even in the dark.

605
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,128
And see to it that she
has no more trouble.

606
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,231
And take this one down.

607
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,365
I'll do a photoshoot for you.

608
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:17,706
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

609
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:23,015
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

610
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:28,448
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

611
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:33,890
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.

612
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,733
- Listen.
- Huh.

613
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,704
Will you come to topper,
with the marriage proposal?

614
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:42,835
No.

615
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,474
In fact, my advice is that you
shouldn't either. Just WhatsApp her.

616
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,970
- Aren't you my brother?
- No.

617
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,141
But if you still
insist on going...

618
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,049
then he honest with them and tell
them about the 'two thumbs'.

619
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,644
They are educated people, you fool. Let
me make an impression on them first.

620
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,280
Otherwise, they will
show me the way out.

621
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:04,825
Will you come along?

622
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,058
Take me to Syria instead.
I am not coming with you.

623
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,929
How could I say no to
brother, isn't it, aunty?

624
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,527
So I had to come down to talk.

625
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,230
And uncle, I knew
this since the day...

626
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,832
brother put up huge
hoardings of sister-in-law.

627
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,576
- Can I ask you a question, son?
- Yes.

628
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,442
- I hope you won't mind.
- Not at all.

629
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,012
Guys your age normally
have two kids.

630
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,484
- So why...
- There's Mallika.

631
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,080
I mean he will treat
sister-in-law like a queen.

632
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,887
- I see...
- You see... he's also past that age.

633
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,450
But he has many desires.

634
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,520
You see, aunty, I
never got the time.

635
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,394
In fact, I never came
across anyone like Jaya.

636
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,362
That's true.

637
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,826
- Have some tea, son.
- No...

638
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,940
- I'll get you some cola.
- Get some cola for him, aunty.

639
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,464
But make sure it's sugar-free.

640
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,840
You see, brother likes
to maintain himself.

641
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:54,842
- I see...
- Right?

642
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,105
- No-no-no...
- I'll go get it for you.

643
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,408
- No need for that.
- Let's get to the point.

644
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,038
Yes.

645
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,975
Do you put the holy thread
over your ear while peeing?

646
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,475
No... not at all, uncle. No
formality in an emergency.

647
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,020
No... not at all.

648
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,181
Mahatma Gandhi has said...

649
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,624
''Be the change you wish
to see in the world.''

650
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,727
Because the world...

651
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,026
International knowledge.

652
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,086
Uncle...

653
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,462
I just love wise men.

654
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,933
- Sunny Leone or Mallika Sherawat?
- Huh?

655
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,600
Tell him to stop''.

656
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:23,128
What?

657
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,765
- Sunny Leone or Mallika Sherawat?
- He's at it again.

658
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,536
Sunny Leone.

659
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,437
Give me five.

660
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,072
- Radhe Cycle.
- Yes.

661
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,344
Take a seat.

662
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:39,018
Well... I completely
trust my daughter Jaya.

663
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,045
Ida too.

664
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,216
If she's chosen you, then there
must he something about you.

665
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,125
- Yes.
- All I have to say is...

666
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,358
''just keep her happy.

667
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,226
Uncle, I can shut shop and
take up a government job.

668
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:54,634
- No-no...
- Just say it...

669
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,796
By the way, son, who else
is there in your family?

670
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,206
There's me, Naru and
Panditji, my father.

671
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,844
All men.

672
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:07,777
Yes... mother passed
away when I was a kid.

673
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,442
- And our grandma lives in Gorakhpur.
- Okay, okay.

674
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,150
And anyway, aunty,
once he gets married..

675
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,054
''They will carry
forward the lineage.

676
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,550
Children.

677
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,993
So let's take this
one step ahead.

678
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,722
When is Keshav introducing
us to Panditji?

679
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,888
Don't ask him, sister-in-law.

680
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,601
Father will give
him special time.

681
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,170
Isn't that right, brother?
Let's go see father.

682
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,011
He seems to he in a good mood.

683
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:40,978
I'll go first.

684
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,552
Guess who, father?

685
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,021
Now what trouble is this?

686
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:52,119
Rascals, never let me
do anything in peace.

687
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:57,258
Don't just stand there and
stare, say something.

688
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,965
Father, I was saying...

689
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,230
Father...

690
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:04,136
You want to go to Mumbai to
become a hero at this age.

691
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,103
Is business running in a loss?

692
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:14,343
Then what else is it?

693
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:16,978
Speak LIP-

694
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,315
Father, I... he...

695
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,619
- Brother...
- I want to get married.

696
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:23,585
Get me married.

697
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,126
Curses.

698
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,054
- I can see that.
- What, father?

699
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,100
The volcano erupting inside you.

700
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:33,872
What?

701
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:35,463
You've got some of
father's pee on your cheek.

702
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,903
You numbskulls... I've
told you a thousand times.

703
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,937
Your wife must have two
thumbs on her hand.

704
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,481
We already have a buffalo tied
in our courtyard with two horns.

705
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,207
Let's stop ranting
about two-thumbs.

706
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,288
You fool... that was just to get rid
of his 'Manglik' (INAUSPICIOUS) phase.

707
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,287
What about the faults still
left in his birth-chart?

708
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,618
And why do you think...

709
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,353
I am insisting on getting
him a wife with two thumbs?

710
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,694
According to the scriptures...

711
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:07,793
Water, Earth, Sky, Wind, and Fire.
The thumb... represents fire.

712
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:12,106
Only double fire can absolve the
final faults in his birth-chart.

713
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,206
So... you must marry someone...

714
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,770
who has 'double fire'
on her left hand.

715
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,072
Yeah...

716
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,715
This is really
terrible, brother.

717
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:29,114
I wonder what I did to
deserve this imbecile?

718
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,161
Can I say something, brother?

719
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,598
I think you should shift in the
barn with sister-in-law Mallika.

720
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,900
I've another idea.

721
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:41,736
Should I ask Hrithik?

722
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,337
Maybe he knows someone.

723
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,112
You know what...

724
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,739
why don't you put up
posters for this too.

725
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,307
''Wanted! With two thumbs.''

726
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,749
I'm in a real tight spot,
and you think it's funny.

727
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,922
Look... on a serious note...

728
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,482
Why don't you tell
father everything?

729
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,790
Hang me upside down father.

730
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:10,122
You're <i>36</i> years old... and
still scared of your father.

731
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,259
Not at all, I'm not
scared of my father.

732
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,360
- Really.
- I am scared of myself...

733
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,971
If I lose my mind, I swear, I
will make father's life hell.

734
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,139
Of course.

735
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,772
Don't you have a solution
on your computer.

736
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,710
For this? No...

737
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,884
Only some quick-fixer can
find a solution to this.

738
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,384
You're right... why move mountains
when we can find a quick-fix for it.

739
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,957
Absolutely right, mister.

740
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,060
It's a question
of our image now.

741
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:45,291
Brother, two cups of
tea... with ginger.

742
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,767
- Make it good.
- Yes.

743
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,067
- Brother, no ginger in mine.
- Okay.

744
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,981
- Listen.
- Yes.

745
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,921
- Can you knit?
- Yes, why?

746
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,395
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

747
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,265
Consider it done.

748
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,010
0 benevolent Lord,
get me married.

749
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:37,682
''There isn't a moment of peace without it.''
- Keshav.

750
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:42,346
- Are you dead?
- ''Always keeps you on your toes.''

751
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,157
''Spins around like the
wheel of a cycle.''

752
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,859
''Anyone in this predicament
is always happy.''

753
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:57,135
''The path of love isn't easy.''

754
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:03,373
''There's nothing more
complicated than love.''

755
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:11,246
''There's nothing more
complicated than love.''

756
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:28,194
''I got cheated by
my own heart...''

757
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:32,430
''and started believing you.''

758
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:35,074
''I got cheated by
my own heart...''

759
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,238
''and started believing you.''

760
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,578
''Finally my heart
took the bait...''

761
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:43,575
''and sacrificed all
its dreams for you.''

762
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:49,416
''Small issue, lots of pain.''

763
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:55,625
''There's nothing more
complicated than love.''

764
00:45:55,987 --> 00:46:03,098
''There's nothing more
complicated than love.''

765
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,332
Just remember three things.

766
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,340
Don't try to scratch with it...
or the nail will come off.

767
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,378
Keep it away from fire,
or it will melt.

768
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,607
And don't use it for legal purposes
it doesn't have a fingerprint.

769
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:15,780
Not at all. Never.

770
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,945
- Congratulations on your wedding, brother.
- Get lost.

771
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,693
Impossible!

772
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,263
Just like Hritika Roshan.

773
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,469
Where did you find her?

774
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,244
Father, last night Goddess
Laxmi came in my dreams.

775
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,779
And in the morning when I
went to the riverside...

776
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:50,013
this fell on me from the roof.

777
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,287
When she came looking for this, I
did the smart thing and hid myself.

778
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,754
I swear father, there was
fire emitting from her.

779
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,757
She was double
fire, take a look.

780
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:01,056
See, this'' See, father.

781
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,361
Father, get me married.

782
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,296
Father...

783
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:24,011
Come, Come''.

784
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,586
Hey stop please.

785
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:28,720
Who is it?

786
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,053
- Bless you.
- Careful.

787
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:31,923
Come here.

788
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:43,464
[CHANTING PRAYER]

789
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:49,000
Hurry up. Hurry ''P-

790
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:56,076
[CHANTING PRAYER]

791
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,250
Bless you, two. Bless you.

792
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,860
- Father... double fire.
- Yes.

793
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,291
Everything's going to
he just delightful now.

794
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,334
Not just delightful, now brother's
going to tango every night.

795
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:16,972
Am I right, Sister-in-law?

796
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:21,002
Brother Keshav, come please.

797
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,305
Congratulation Brother Keshav.

798
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,082
Well done''.

799
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,018
You are great!

800
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,721
Come dance with me.

801
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:35,389
Very good.

802
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:41,353
Brother Keshav, do
the serpent dance.

803
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:46,602
Well done Father''.

804
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,370
Hail to Brother keshav!

805
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,046
Dance with me also.

806
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,245
Come sister-in-law.

807
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,656
Come brother.

808
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,595
Aunty, your
daughter-in-law's here.

809
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,791
Right foot, sister-in-law...
right foot.

810
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:19,894
Come, sister-in-law.

811
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,810
Welcome, sister-in-law.
This is our courtyard.

812
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,174
Welcome.

813
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,373
<i>Stop-stars“?-</i>

814
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,040
Let me introduce
you to his first.

815
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,786
You're the second wife, not
the first. She's his first.

816
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,118
Her name is Mallika you must
meet and greet her first.

817
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,589
You can meet her later.

818
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:42,713
- Come here first.
- This isn't right.

819
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,419
Listen to me...

820
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,061
You're in a lot of hurry today.

821
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,960
Do you always have to
interfere? Get lost.

822
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,761
I am not going anywhere. I'm
going to sleep in the middle.

823
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,686
What is that?

824
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:26,997
- 'Sande Ka Tel'.
- Shameless.

825
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:30,231
Here... my mistress sent
this for you. Drink it.

826
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,466
You can't even take
a joke nowadays.

827
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,473
Even you kept me in the dark.

828
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,009
I want a divorce, that's it.

829
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:38,977
I see...

830
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,311
Let's get on with the
wedding night...

831
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,511
and I'll divorce your entire
family in the morning.

832
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,388
Will you come
quietly... or jump?

833
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,522
Jump, - Jump!

834
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:55,495
Sister Mallika...

835
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,090
Sister Mallika, help!

836
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:00,700
Curse those two.

837
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,879
Sister-in-law.

838
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,610
Sister-in-law.

839
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,183
Get up.

840
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:23,420
Get up.

841
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,926
You already woke me up
three times last night.

842
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:28,964
I am a man, not a machine.

843
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:30,959
Useless.

844
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,105
Sister-in-law, recognize me?

845
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,302
I am Sana. We met
at your wedding.

846
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:42,841
Yes, Sana, but...

847
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,278
It's already 4:15.

848
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:47,373
Everyone's eagerly waiting to
welcome you to our IOTA party.

849
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,814
Sana, is it going to take long?

850
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:53,385
Get the new daughter-in-law
quickly. It's getting urgent.

851
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:57,224
You go, Sana. I'll
meet everyone later.

852
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,087
It will he dawn soon.

853
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,922
You go, I am coming.

854
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,724
Hurry up then.

855
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,534
We've along way to go.

856
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,373
Wake up. Keshav, wake up.

857
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:12,413
Wake up!

858
00:52:12,438 --> 00:52:14,690
My dear, are you going to
wake me up like this every day?

859
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:15,938
Why didn't you tell me?

860
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:18,875
But Naru did tell
you about Mallika?

861
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:20,040
Stop joking-

862
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,808
Why were these women
calling me out?

863
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,682
Don't you have a
toilet in your home?

864
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,483
Toilet?

865
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,090
No toilet... where?

866
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,149
There's one in my home.

867
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:34,094
Why didn't you tell me
before our marriage?

868
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:36,829
Tell you what?

869
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,866
That you don't have a
toilet in your home.

870
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,560
Why are you making
a scene for it?

871
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:43,965
Where should I go then?

872
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,571
Same place everyone
else is going.

873
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,240
Socialize with everyone, get to
know everyone in the IOTA party.

874
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,439
Be their leader...

875
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,043
Be their leader!

876
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,381
Listen to me. Such
anger for a toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI)?

877
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,986
If I had known, I would've
never married you.

878
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:00,217
Move!

879
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,700
Didn't anyone in the village
build a toilet, Sana?

880
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:17,165
No, sister-in-law,
there isn't one here.

881
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:19,241
What's the matter?
Is there a problem?

882
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:22,369
Don't you think it's a problem...
to defecate out in the open.

883
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,271
But this is important.

884
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,980
How can we do without it?

885
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,241
No walls or doors.

886
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:31,444
- What if someone sees you?
- Now I get it.

887
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,847
I guess there's been
an incident with you.

888
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,515
Is everyone waiting for
an incident to happen?

889
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,158
Until then, let things
continue the way they are.

890
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:37,852
Isn't it?

891
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,820
Are you two going
to chatter alone?

892
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:40,988
We're here too.

893
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,088
You're really beautiful.

894
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,190
Also, you had a love-marriage.

895
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,299
Yes, of course, that's what girls
do when they get educated.

896
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,805
Yes... that's what they
teach us in college.

897
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,737
She's got a sharp
tongue, sister.

898
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,171
He was always so predictable.

899
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,869
We always knew, Keshav will marry
some English-speaking girl.

900
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,407
- How much further?
- Just a little more, sister-in-law.

901
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,920
What if we have to
go during the day.

902
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,446
Control it.

903
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:12,226
Hurry up, daughter-in-law,
it will he dawn soon.

904
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,643
Will you just stand there and
stare at us, daughter-in-law?

905
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,938
Aren't your in-laws feeding you?

906
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,508
She feels embarrassed.

907
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,748
Forsake all your inhibitions
and get down to business.

908
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,553
I'm not used to it.

909
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,854
Did your parents build
a palace for you?

910
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,986
You are right.

911
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,193
Yes... there was a
toilet in my home.

912
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,062
I can't do this.

913
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:55,566
- Listen...
- Daughter-in-law.

914
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,230
You'll get in trouble later.

915
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,942
Just watching television.

916
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,260
Come... Father's not at home.

917
00:55:26,857 --> 00:55:28,393
You're still angry with me.

918
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,199
Say something.

919
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,804
Why are you making such a scene?

920
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,514
I can't defecate out
in the open, Keshav.

921
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,922
Do something... or I'm leaving.

922
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:04,836
Father...

923
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,302
we delivered Gokul's
consignment yesterday.

924
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,608
Some minor things to do.

925
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:13,948
I've called a handyman.
The roof was leaking.

926
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,449
And build a small
toilet in the room.

927
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,779
- What did you say?
- The spare parts will arrive from Agra...

928
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,813
- Huh?
- What did you say?

929
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,322
Spare parts...

930
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,252
Before that.

931
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:29,162
- The roof was leaking.
- After that?

932
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,438
Build a small toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI)...

933
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,868
What happened, father?

934
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,237
I can't swallow a
single morsel...

935
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,645
if anyone mentions a
toilet while eating.

936
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:52,585
And now our... topper daughter-in-law
wants a loo in our home.

937
00:56:56,446 --> 00:57:00,690
No respect for our culture or knowledge
of our tradition and rituals.

938
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:06,230
Over-education makes
you a failure in life.

939
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,812
- Give me some bread.
- Yes, me too...

940
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,712
What is this?

941
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:28,413
Father's share of bread...

942
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,415
Go give this to father.

943
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,293
Come along, father
will like that.

944
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,126
Come.

945
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:25,071
Father, please eat...

946
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:30,718
Stop venting your anger
on food, father.

947
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:34,078
Daughter-in-law cooked this food
without going to the toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

948
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,918
I won't eat this.

949
00:58:41,452 --> 00:58:46,333
By the way, father, if we can have
a living room, a dining room...

950
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,026
then, we can certainly
build a toilet.

951
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,170
Then why take the body
to the crematorium?

952
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,431
You can burn me right
here in our courtyard.

953
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,374
And then build a toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

954
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,215
Come Jaya, it's really late.

955
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,125
Jaya...

956
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,163
Jaya, I am trying.

957
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,131
I've already put in a
request with father.

958
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:58,973
Darling... just a few more days.

959
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,139
Soon we'll find a
solution for this.

960
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,068
What solution?

961
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,176
Build a fake toilet,
like the fake thumb.

962
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,441
- Trying to make quick-fixes.
- Jaya..

963
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:29,363
No-no-no... look.

964
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,698
Look closely who defecates
out in the open.

965
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,400
There should he some difference.

966
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,743
Here... it's your uncle calling.

967
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:44,741
Tell him... what you thought
was a smartphone...

968
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,719
turned out to he a small pager.

969
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,892
- Radhe-Radhe, uncle.
- Everything okay.

970
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,233
Tell me... how can there he
so much peace in Mandgaon.

971
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,668
We sent a storm from here.

972
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,441
Forget the storm, uncle, I am
preparing for World War 3.

973
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:12,204
- Have faith in me.
- I do...

974
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,875
Keep a firm grip on
those cycle-sellers.

975
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,282
Hmm...

976
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:21,545
Why are you sounding so
low? Is everything alright?

977
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,452
Give it to me.

978
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:24,551
No, uncle.

979
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,684
I was just feeling tired.

980
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:30,898
Right, I guess you don't
get much sleep these days.

981
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,762
Listen, tell Keshav that
Sunny's new film is releasing.

982
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,963
We'll go watch it together.

983
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,767
- Uncle...
- Let me talk properly...

984
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,104
Dear... is everything fine?

985
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,212
- Yes..
- When are you coming home?

986
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:49,806
Hello-hello.

987
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,411
- Hello.
- What happened?

988
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:02,625
There's always a villain
in every love story.

989
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,332
And in my case, it's the toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

990
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,227
I must fix this
once and for all.

991
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,404
I have an idea.

992
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:14,903
Take your problem
to the Pradhan.

993
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:17,070
Get out of here... the Pradhan.

994
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,716
Pradhan!

995
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,814
[FOLK SONG]

996
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,290
[FOLK SONG]

997
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,225
I'm asking you for the fourth time. Why
bring me here at the crack of dawn?

998
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,698
Wait, sweetheart. Be patient.

999
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,803
Everyone must change with time.

1000
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,103
I've heard she's well educated.

1001
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,904
Are you planning on letting
her take up a job as well?

1002
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:48,874
Oh, no...

1003
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:52,073
It's up to her. She can
do what she wants.

1004
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:54,172
Jaya, go and meet
grandma upstairs.

1005
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,445
She's bedridden and can't
move or walk. Go on.

1006
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,181
Yes, why not.

1007
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,918
That's why they had to build
a toilet in grandma's room.

1008
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,218
I'll send her.

1009
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,558
No-no, she will manage
herself. Go on.

1010
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,062
Don't he hasty.

1011
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,959
Haste makes waste.

1012
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,557
Right, wifey, right.

1013
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,423
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1014
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,323
What now? What are you
fuming about now?

1015
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:16,362
It's nothing.

1016
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:19,828
What do you want?

1017
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,861
What kind of a question is that?
Don't you know what I want?

1018
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,639
I felt like a thief
just to go to the loo.

1019
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,375
- You've made my life miserable.
- I can say the same for you.

1020
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,239
You've done me a big
favor by marrying me.

1021
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,180
And now I must tolerate
your educated tantrums.

1022
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:36,473
What?

1023
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:39,644
You really think I am
throwing tantrums.

1024
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:43,280
Isn't a woman even entitled
to a toilet in her home?

1025
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,891
For years women have
been adjusting...

1026
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:46,758
to the methods practiced
in her in-law's home.

1027
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,691
It's nothing new.

1028
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:51,893
Education has got to your head.

1029
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,429
Chauhey, check the tubes
before you buy them.

1030
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,030
Or else we'll get the
defective stuff again.

1031
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,241
Brother, did you get
the hike serviced?

1032
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,003
Father has to leave for Mathura.

1033
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,705
Wouldn't I rather
sabotage the brakes?

1034
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:06,503
Here.

1035
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,611
And don't forget to
wash the lunchbox.

1036
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:16,747
Frankly speaking, brother, God has
put you in a really fine mess.

1037
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,917
I'm sure he wrote
my fate in the loo.

1038
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,355
Yes... and flushed it too.

1039
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:27,501
You know what, brother
why don't you buy...

1040
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,629
sister-in-law her
own personal field?

1041
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,604
That way, you can have
your cake and eat it too.

1042
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:34,703
Have you lost your mind?

1043
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,904
- Go mind your own business.
- Don't come asking me for advice again.

1044
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,445
Keshav. Keshav, wake up.

1045
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:46,576
Keshav, wake up.

1046
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:48,088
- Wake up. Wake up.
- What's wrong? Is it an earthquake?

1047
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,784
- Take me to the field quickly.
- Field.

1048
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,391
No 'ifs' or 'huts'.

1049
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,792
This is not the time for
your tantrums. Let's go.

1050
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:55,852
I am sorry.

1051
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:59,094
I was very rude
to you yesterday.

1052
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,131
- I apologize.
- Doesn't matter. Let's go.

1053
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:06,332
By the way, the fields
are very romantic.

1054
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,803
- We can romance...
- This is no time to he Shahrukh Khan.

1055
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,216
Curses.

1056
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,813
Radhe-Radhe.

1057
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,024
I'm right here.

1058
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,093
Good luck.

1059
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:45,802
Father!

1060
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:27,913
Peel these.

1061
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,550
Are you done with
your work in Mathura?

1062
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,249
- First wash my hands.
- Yes.

1063
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:46,691
What's all the racket about?

1064
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,244
Clear your throat for good.

1065
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:39,085
Father.

1066
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:45,890
She's just tensed about what
happened today in the field.

1067
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,355
You're worried about
what happened to her.

1068
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:50,625
And what about the fact that
I fell in a pile of garbage.

1069
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,824
These things happen.

1070
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:56,237
Don't complicate things.
It wasn't so serious.

1071
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,235
Daughter-in-law did
cover her face.

1072
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,897
- Then.
- I see...

1073
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:03,133
That's a fine example, father.

1074
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:06,873
Then we don't need to cover our
faces anymore in this house!

1075
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:10,445
Jaya.

1076
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:15,745
Father...

1077
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:35,804
Brother... are you planning to
jump in front of the train?

1078
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,305
No...

1079
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:42,647
I'm thinking of throwing
you in front of the train.

1080
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,513
Why didn't you stop me
from getting married?

1081
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,647
That doesn't make sense.
Why would I stop you?

1082
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,949
First of all, I am not getting
married because of you.

1083
01:10:52,315 --> 01:10:55,626
Father was the hurdle in your
life. And you're in mine.

1084
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,960
He's been married twice.

1085
01:10:58,021 --> 01:10:59,762
But no lane's
concerned about me.

1086
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:01,765
My brother, you don't
know how happy you are.

1087
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:02,963
I don't want to he happy.

1088
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,198
Even I was overexcited
to get married.

1089
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,437
And I did.

1090
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:09,271
You can see how she's
turned my life into hell.

1091
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:10,901
What are you saying, brother?

1092
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:13,513
Your wife's one in a million.

1093
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:16,847
It's better not to have
one..not like her.

1094
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:19,112
She's got my life
trapped in an urn.

1095
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,347
Stop discussing our
family problems outside.

1096
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:23,982
What family problems?

1097
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,653
When there's a problem at home a man's
going to vent it out somewhere.

1098
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:31,456
Right, Rastogi.

1099
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,694
What happened, brother? Be
a little more specific.

1100
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,361
How about I tell you in detail?

1101
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,596
- Stop provoking brother, you rascal.
- Naru!

1102
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,306
Show some respect.

1103
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,342
He's <i>35</i> years older than you.

1104
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:47,942
Shameless...

1105
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:51,484
It's nothing, Rastogi.
Life's a big mess.

1106
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,344
Will you he a little
more specific?

1107
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,978
Who made a mess and where?

1108
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,184
I am stuck.

1109
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:01,051
Actually, your poor sister-in-law
isn't asking for too much.

1110
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:02,323
One toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

1111
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:07,629
I am ready to give her open fields,
the jungle, trees and bushes.

1112
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,658
But no...

1113
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:14,141
She insists on a 4x8 toi... let.

1114
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,575
Bloody hell.. Where do
I get her a toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI)?

1115
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,577
So that's the problem.

1116
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:22,276
It's not a problem,
its blasphemy.

1117
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,349
And then there's Panditji.

1118
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:27,781
He's like the permanent
problem in my life.

1119
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:30,355
He's like father-in-law
from hell.

1120
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,653
I pray no one has to go
through this ordeal.

1121
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,363
They have made my life hell.

1122
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,691
Look, brother Keshav,
my advice to you is...

1123
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,597
take sister-in-law to
Gorakhpur, to see your grandma.

1124
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:44,430
The train halts for <i>7</i>
minutes in your village.

1125
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:47,006
So... when do I
hook your tickets?

1126
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:50,573
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- Give it to me.

1127
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:51,702
Okay.

1128
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:01,911
What did you say?

1129
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,156
- How long will the train halt?
- <i>7</i> minutes.

1130
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:08,887
- Will the train halt for <i>7</i> minutes?
- Yes.

1131
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:33,153
Remember our first
meeting and climb up.

1132
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:34,912
Go on, you have seven minutes.

1133
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:44,127
''Your love's slowly
growing on me.''

1134
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:48,295
''Like ginger blends
with the morning tea.''

1135
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:52,066
''Your love's slowly
growing on me.''

1136
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:56,737
''Like ginger blends
with the morning tea.''

1137
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,650
''I eagerly wait for you, like for
the morning rays in winter.''

1138
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:08,514
''I'm prepared to ride all
the way to the moon.''

1139
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,854
''The morning train...''

1140
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,089
''Your love's like
the morning train.''

1141
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,563
''The morning train...''

1142
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,691
''Your love's like
the morning train.''

1143
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:22,200
''I stay awake all night...''

1144
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:25,399
''Your love's like
the morning train.''

1145
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:27,874
''The morning train...''

1146
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:31,777
''Your love's like
the morning train.''

1147
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,041
It's three...

1148
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:35,477
- Oh, God!
- Yes.

1149
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,849
- I won.
- What is this? I don't want to play.

1150
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,686
You know what, you go.

1151
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:41,585
Your sister-in-law and
I are going to play.

1152
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,748
Where are you taking the game?

1153
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:44,689
Brother's going to play
another games with you now.

1154
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:46,387
How are we going to play now?

1155
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,084
Let's play.

1156
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:05,273
''We set out before dawn.''

1157
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:11,210
''Let the world he envy.''

1158
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:16,280
''We set out before dawn.''

1159
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:22,223
''Let the world he envy.''

1160
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:25,228
''The heart keeps chugging.''

1161
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:28,030
''Keeps stopping on the way.''

1162
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:30,833
''The heart keeps chugging.''

1163
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,363
''Keeps stopping on the way.''

1164
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:38,777
''And sometimes heats fast
like an express train.''

1165
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,314
''The morning train...''

1166
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,510
''Your love's like
the morning train.''

1167
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,711
- Keshav.
- Yes, father.

1168
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:50,520
Give this to the Pradhan when you
go out for one of your joyrides.

1169
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:51,386
Yes.

1170
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:53,516
Oh no!

1171
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,921
- We're late today.
- No, we're not.

1172
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,590
I'll just go deliver this
to the Pradhan. Okay.

1173
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:03,300
- Come hack soon.
- I'll he hack in a jiffy.

1174
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,434
Check the next
compartment, dear.

1175
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:13,276
- You'll find an empty one.
- Thank you.

1176
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:17,014
Move. Move, mister.

1177
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:17,949
Read it.

1178
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,653
- Hurry up.
- The train's about to leave.

1179
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,911
- Radhe-Radhe, Pradhan.
- Radhe-Radhe, son.

1180
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,240
What brings you here so early
in the morning, Keshav.

1181
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:50,081
Father sent these documents
for attestation.

1182
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,586
Take a seat... let's have
a cup of tea. Vimla.

1183
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:54,918
No-no-no... not now. I'm
getting late. Maybe next time.

1184
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:58,682
Take a seat, it's not like
you've to catch a train.

1185
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:06,833
What...

1186
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,129
- Okay, see you then.
- Okay.

1187
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:11,933
Radhe-Radhe.

1188
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:13,905
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Radhe-Radhe.

1189
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:17,470
I only want the betterment
of this village.

1190
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,502
That's true. Anything
for this village...

1191
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,338
Open the door!

1192
01:18:01,577 --> 01:18:03,818
Quickly. The train's
leaving, Open the door!

1193
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:07,527
- Open the door.
- Yes, we're moving it.

1194
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,722
Open the door.

1195
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:10,526
The train's leaving,
Open the door!

1196
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:12,532
Yes, we're moving it.

1197
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,431
Get everything aside.

1198
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,527
- Move.
- Yes, we're moving it.

1199
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,244
Keep it here...

1200
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,445
Come... come''.

1201
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:56,072
<i>Jaya, get down.</i>

1202
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,679
Jaya, pull the chain.

1203
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,607
Pull the chain!

1204
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,883
Pull the chain!

1205
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,782
Jay-a!

1206
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:09,784
Jay-a!

1207
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,550
Jaya! What are you
doing? Pull the chain.

1208
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:17,027
We're running out of platform.

1209
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:21,229
Pull the chain!

1210
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:29,472
Jaya.

1211
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:36,478
Jaya. Pull the chain!

1212
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:11,412
Shooting '' Shooting''.

1213
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:17,754
Even if you call 100 times you'll
get the same answer, Keshav.

1214
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,052
I am not coming hack.

1215
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,584
Think about the rumor
people are going to spread.

1216
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:24,061
Keshav's wife left
him for a toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

1217
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:27,292
Will you feel proud if your
wife defecates out in the open?

1218
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:29,458
You're getting it all wrong.

1219
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,700
We'll find a way.

1220
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,304
You mean another quick-fix.

1221
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,735
When in love, the best
solution is to run away.

1222
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:38,746
Fake thumb for marriage and,
using the loo on the train.

1223
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,344
Listen carefully, Keshav.

1224
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,346
No more quick-fixes.

1225
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,812
Find a permanent solution.

1226
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:47,319
You know what, you can take your
demands and sit in your toilet(SWCHALAYA IN HINDI).

1227
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:48,547
Okay. Okay.

1228
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:57,055
See... she's publicly
embarrassed us.

1229
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,493
What happened, father?

1230
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:01,735
Read, son. Read.

1231
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:04,167
She's made us Pandit's so proud.

1232
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,197
- Your grandma called.
- Yes.

1233
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,034
She's coming down from
Gorakhpur next week.

1234
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:09,836
Yes, father.

1235
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,241
She just made a big
joke out of us.

1236
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,272
Brother. . look..

1237
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:19,047
Tell him, Naru.

1238
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,546
Now he must take care
of the household.

1239
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,785
Couldn't even take
care of his wife.

1240
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:28,157
She's not some piece of cloth
which needs to he taken care of.

1241
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:29,886
Come on.

1242
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,496
He's only good for
cleaning up dung.

1243
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:35,601
Only animals are allowed
to shit in this courtyard.

1244
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,270
Which scoundrel
published this news?

1245
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,273
We've been betrayed
by one of our own.

1246
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,603
Rastogi from Jagran.

1247
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:45,276
- Brother Keshav.
- Bloody traitor...

1248
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:47,474
How dare you!

1249
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:51,249
How dare you
humiliate my family!

1250
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:52,843
- Now he's got the respect he deserved.
- Brother, please...

1251
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:54,218
Come on.

1252
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:58,123
Whatever I did, was
for your own good.

1253
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:01,223
Shut it down. Shut it
down. Go hack inside.

1254
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,593
You bloody...

1255
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:04,321
Speak up!

1256
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:06,333
- Tell me.
- Listen to me, brother, please...

1257
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,629
I'll tell you if you
stop hitting me.

1258
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,330
Speak up. Yes, tell me.

1259
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,803
Listen to me...

1260
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,332
This news would've
been out soon enough.

1261
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:17,342
My newspaper didn't
expose some hidden scam.

1262
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:23,281
Thanks to your newspaper. Those
who didn't know also know.

1263
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:24,350
Just wait and watch...

1264
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:27,444
sister-in-law will come hack
home due to this article.

1265
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:28,352
HOW?

1266
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,754
The bride's family never likes to
see such news in the newspaper.

1267
01:22:31,914 --> 01:22:33,222
There must he chaos
in their house.

1268
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:34,250
All of them must he
completely shaken.

1269
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,830
'You said...'

1270
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:46,062
Can someone please lower the volume so
we can discuss more important issues?

1271
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:50,267
These so called 'important' issues
are what's ruining the country.

1272
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:53,376
''How long are we going
to mourn and cry.''

1273
01:22:53,402 --> 01:22:56,246
''Pull up the blanket over
your head and sleep.''

1274
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,013
Please stay quiet.

1275
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,050
I can't hear the
dialogues, mother.

1276
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,781
Did anyone read
today's newspapers?

1277
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:05,755
What is everyone's
opinion about it?

1278
01:23:05,915 --> 01:23:09,294
This is Kakka's contribution in 'Swacchta
Abhiyan' (CLEAN INDIA MOVEMENT).

1279
01:23:09,385 --> 01:23:12,594
Today's newspaper was fit to
he used as waste and so I did.

1280
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:17,329
Waste should always go into
the wastepaper basket.

1281
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,167
- 'They will die for you?
- Yes.'

1282
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:23,200
'But I am not like
them. I am different.'

1283
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:28,806
My thumb.

1284
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:41,922
Daughter-in-law's thumb?

1285
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,859
What if Rastogi's
right, brother?

1286
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,366
Maybe sister-in-law will come
hack after reading this news.

1287
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:54,999
She won't.

1288
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:57,285
I wonder how many times I
will still get humiliated...

1289
01:23:57,297 --> 01:23:58,008
Useless!

1290
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,545
Both of you are useless!

1291
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:02,941
Useless!

1292
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:05,748
This...

1293
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:09,183
This fake thumb that you made...

1294
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,616
It's not for me or religion.

1295
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,559
She left it behind for
you, your topper madam.

1296
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:22,996
And now... even the Lord
can't absolve your troubles.

1297
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:24,795
- But, father, sister-in-law only...
- Shut up.

1298
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,964
Don't you dare mention
her name here again?

1299
01:24:27,997 --> 01:24:28,873
Yes, father.

1300
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,978
They want show
religion the finger.

1301
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:34,674
Stop pretending!

1302
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:37,350
Get up brother.

1303
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,604
Field clear.. silence.

1304
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,297
Taking.

1305
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,203
- Ready, sir.
- Action.

1306
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,106
Do I look stupid to you?

1307
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:04,199
- I'm sorry.
- What sorry.

1308
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,344
You think I can't see.

1309
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,548
You were flirting with her,
I saw it with my own eyes.

1310
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,114
You don't trust me.
You trust me right?

1311
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:26,329
I love you.

1312
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:27,128
Cut it.

1313
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:32,797
I see... so these oversized
boxes are toilets.

1314
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:36,273
Your sister-in-law will he
really comfortable in this.

1315
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:38,971
Huh?

1316
01:25:39,568 --> 01:25:42,344
Brother, I don't think
your intentions are good.

1317
01:25:43,572 --> 01:25:45,848
Careful. Careful.

1318
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:47,716
Pull.. Pull..

1319
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,548
How do you feel carrying a loo
on your shoulders, Rastogi?

1320
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,958
- I feel like Mother India.
- I see...

1321
01:25:54,049 --> 01:25:56,427
Brother Keshav, it looks new.

1322
01:25:56,752 --> 01:25:58,925
Don't publish this
in your newspaper.

1323
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:03,400
Brother, after that heating, I'll
only print what you tell me to.

1324
01:26:03,425 --> 01:26:05,803
Brother, what if they file a
complaint with the police?

1325
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,534
Only if they find it.

1326
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:09,867
Where will we hide it?

1327
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:12,738
We'll hide it in our
courtyard for a day or two.

1328
01:26:12,768 --> 01:26:13,371
And cover it.

1329
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:16,006
Later, when father leaves for
Agra we'll shift it in my room.

1330
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:16,742
Come on.

1331
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,805
Can't live without me?

1332
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:49,580
There's something I
want to tell you.

1333
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,844
That's what phones are for.

1334
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:53,547
Not like this.

1335
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:54,880
Let's meet.

1336
01:26:55,344 --> 01:26:56,414
What is it this time?

1337
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:57,889
Some quick-fix again.

1338
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:00,425
No quick-fix... this time
I've come up with an idea.

1339
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,217
Can we meet?

1340
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,155
Then come home.

1341
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:05,421
I won't come home.

1342
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,223
Things will just
get complicated.

1343
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:09,494
Why? Are you feeling
embarrassed?

1344
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,802
Fine, let's meet tonight.

1345
01:27:12,094 --> 01:27:12,799
Why?

1346
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:14,799
Are you embarrassed to
meet me during the day?

1347
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:15,931
Of course, I am.

1348
01:27:15,998 --> 01:27:18,171
I don't want people to
think that I gave in.

1349
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:22,643
So where are we going to
meet my beloved wife?

1350
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:25,948
Near the field with the tower.

1351
01:27:26,308 --> 01:27:28,310
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1352
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:38,361
Are you enjoying, meeting secretly
like this even though we're married.

1353
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:41,264
Yeah... I've been having
fun for <i>36</i> years, madam.

1354
01:27:41,657 --> 01:27:44,570
I used all the tricks up my sleeve
to get a wife but she left me too.

1355
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,903
We should've eloped instead.

1356
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,570
This distance is
taking effect on you.

1357
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,371
So tell me... why did
you call me here?

1358
01:27:56,138 --> 01:27:58,482
Better prepare yourself
to come hack home.

1359
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,575
I just solved this
problem permanently.

1360
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:03,015
I see... How?

1361
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:04,519
See for yourself.

1362
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:08,928
Soon I'll take you hack home,
like wedding procession.

1363
01:28:09,218 --> 01:28:11,824
You could've said
this over the phone.

1364
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,105
I wanted to see you.

1365
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,438
But not me.

1366
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,307
Why are you on-line
last night at 12:30?

1367
01:28:28,837 --> 01:28:31,147
Were you watching
my profile picture?

1368
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:35,615
You must have run your fingers
on my photo, like this.

1369
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:41,688
I see... how do you know?

1370
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,220
Were you keeping an eye on me?

1371
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:48,825
I have a drone hovering
over your father's home.

1372
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:50,831
And it keeps telling me.

1373
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:57,173
You know, since the day I left, I've
been sleeping embracing your picture.

1374
01:28:57,466 --> 01:28:59,412
So... stop doing it until
day-after-tomorrow.

1375
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:03,245
- Why?
- Everyone will think that you gave in.

1376
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:12,850
Your phone's vibrating.

1377
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:17,088
Hold on.

1378
01:29:19,254 --> 01:29:20,631
Speak up, bloody jinx.

1379
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:34,043
Now you guys are stealing
toilets as well.

1380
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:38,007
Because of people like you even mugs
have to he chained in train's toilets.

1381
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:42,384
Fine, but I don't want to stand out
in the open like you guys and pee.

1382
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:44,488
Are you listening to his taunts?

1383
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:47,218
You take the necessary
action, Inspector.

1384
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:49,486
He has tainted my religion.

1385
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,163
By bringing this sin home?

1386
01:29:51,253 --> 01:29:53,494
They have been committing the
sin till now, Inspector.

1387
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,229
What did his
daughter-in-law do wrong?

1388
01:29:55,257 --> 01:29:57,237
Only animals defecate
out in the open.

1389
01:29:58,093 --> 01:29:59,299
I see...

1390
01:30:02,364 --> 01:30:06,835
I raised him into this
37-year-old man that he is now.

1391
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,746
And now you think it's wrong
to defecate out in the open.

1392
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:13,209
You're right. You
raised me to he a man.

1393
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:16,522
That's why I never
thought about women.

1394
01:30:20,449 --> 01:30:21,792
Let him stay in jail.

1395
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:34,299
Grandma. Grandma,
come in. Please.

1396
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:37,333
- Come in. Please.
- I will never cross this threshold!

1397
01:30:37,366 --> 01:30:38,902
I just came here to say..

1398
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,844
that you've raised your daughter
with some great values.

1399
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:45,450
Keshav stole a loo for her.

1400
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,755
And now he's locked up
in jail, for stealing.

1401
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:50,316
And this princess...

1402
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:53,155
She's sitting in her
home, over a loo.

1403
01:30:54,216 --> 01:30:55,422
Unbelievable, grandma.

1404
01:30:55,751 --> 01:30:57,321
You're saying this even
though you're a woman.

1405
01:30:57,352 --> 01:31:00,697
I'm saying this because I am a woman.
We've to compromise all the time.

1406
01:31:00,722 --> 01:31:02,292
That's the plight of women.

1407
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:04,861
But she left her home.
That's not the way.

1408
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,668
This never happened in
our village before.

1409
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,703
Out on your joyride again.

1410
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:14,742
The men can do it right
in their backyard.

1411
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,313
But we're women.

1412
01:31:16,438 --> 01:31:18,850
We've to work harder
for everything.

1413
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:19,985
Isn't it?

1414
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,247
We're expected to make
all the compromises.

1415
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,456
Because that's what our
culture teaches us.

1416
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:26,024
Control your urges.

1417
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,856
Wait for nightfall.

1418
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:30,187
Men can do it during the day, but
you got to do it in the dark.

1419
01:31:30,252 --> 01:31:31,356
But stay quiet!

1420
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:36,132
If men look at you with lusty
eyes then just cover your faces..

1421
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,363
''But stay quiet!

1422
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,836
And when some pervert
flashes his torch at you...

1423
01:31:39,895 --> 01:31:41,841
then cover your faces, rather
than covering your backside!

1424
01:31:42,064 --> 01:31:43,975
So that he can go to
his friends and say...

1425
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,479
''I caught a glimpse, but
don't know who it was.''

1426
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:50,111
Every day they kept flashing
their headlights at you...

1427
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:51,708
hut it never struck you.

1428
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:56,756
You're happy because IOTA party
has a new agenda to discuss!

1429
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:00,324
This is okay Neelam.

1430
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:03,089
If you're having periods,
stay out of the temple.

1431
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,892
If there's a pyre burning we
stay out of the crematorium.

1432
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,159
And if we want to relieve
ourselves go outside the village.

1433
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:08,499
Why?

1434
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:12,333
Why make these rules?
Why only for us?

1435
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:18,270
It was their fault... hut
now, it's our fault!

1436
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,506
What do you want, Jaya?

1437
01:32:19,568 --> 01:32:20,979
Do you expect us to leave
our home like you?

1438
01:32:21,136 --> 01:32:23,138
We don't have a toilet
even in our parents' home.

1439
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,372
I don't know.

1440
01:32:24,673 --> 01:32:26,584
I only found a solution
to my problem.

1441
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:29,485
But the rest of you don't even
realize that you're in trouble!

1442
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,415
Someday... Someday you will he
reduced to ashes in these urns.

1443
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,786
Even now you're trapped
in it while you're alive!

1444
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:44,367
Serve water to your
husband in this urn...

1445
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,998
and we'll see... whether
they make a scene, or not.

1446
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:19,463
- Come, sir.
- Please.

1447
01:33:20,896 --> 01:33:23,467
- Brother.
- Hello, sir.

1448
01:33:23,532 --> 01:33:24,510
Yeah...

1449
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:27,873
Jaya.

1450
01:33:32,073 --> 01:33:33,711
- Sir...
- Yes, thank you.

1451
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,826
This was your solution
to my problem?

1452
01:33:43,385 --> 01:33:45,490
Do me a favor, Keshav.

1453
01:33:46,688 --> 01:33:49,294
No more quick-fixes for me.

1454
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:53,835
Forgive me.

1455
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,407
Don't say that, Jaya.

1456
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:06,651
Strange, you're hailing out
the guy who stole your loo.

1457
01:34:07,442 --> 01:34:10,821
No thief in the world will
steal a toilet, Inspector.

1458
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:11,955
I see...

1459
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:13,859
Okay.

1460
01:34:14,282 --> 01:34:16,159
- Let Keshav go.
- Thank you, sir.

1461
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,676
Come, brother. I guess
it's going to rain.

1462
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:32,577
Let it rain, Naru.

1463
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:36,305
Even the Lord's taunting me now.

1464
01:34:36,938 --> 01:34:40,818
Guess you're drunk...
you're not in your senses.

1465
01:34:41,376 --> 01:34:45,381
I am drunk... and even
more determined now.

1466
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:57,929
- Mom.
- Yes.

1467
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,972
Where's my silver-waistband?

1468
01:35:00,662 --> 01:35:01,936
Wow...

1469
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:05,307
If Keshav sees you today he
will take you hack home.

1470
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:07,008
Let him come.

1471
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:08,740
I will break his
head with the stick.

1472
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:09,975
Listen...

1473
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:12,318
He isn't asking for dowry.

1474
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:14,585
Or raised his hand on you?

1475
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:18,086
He loves you, think about it.

1476
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:20,293
End this right here
and go hack home.

1477
01:35:20,415 --> 01:35:22,019
You've made things more
complicated than it is.

1478
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,084
Complicated?

1479
01:35:23,785 --> 01:35:26,197
Bravo, Vidya. Bravo.

1480
01:35:26,354 --> 01:35:29,301
Do you know what happened
with the kids in Badhai?

1481
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,504
Poor kids went out
in the evening.

1482
01:35:31,593 --> 01:35:33,800
They were raped and
hung from the tree.

1483
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:37,034
And a 17-year-old girl in
Jharkhand, committed suicide.

1484
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:40,069
Why? Because her father
didn't build a toilet.

1485
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:45,078
God forbid if something like
that happens with our child...

1486
01:35:45,173 --> 01:35:47,779
will you still say that
she's complicating things.

1487
01:35:47,976 --> 01:35:50,320
You women are your
own worse enemies.

1488
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:51,753
Like they say, Vidya...

1489
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:53,883
Don't wait till it's too late.

1490
01:35:54,349 --> 01:35:56,727
It's a good thing that our
child took this step.

1491
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:58,329
When Keshav shows up today...

1492
01:35:58,386 --> 01:36:00,423
hit him hard on my
behalf as well.

1493
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:03,426
Forget it, grandpa. I am not
even going to look at him.

1494
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:24,485
''I crave for your glimpse...''

1495
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:28,483
''and finally I realized.''

1496
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:36,516
''I want to rub the mud under your feet
on my head and sanctify my sins.''

1497
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:49,004
''You didn't invite me... hut I
still came down your lane.''

1498
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:55,612
''You can punish me for
all unfair treatment.''

1499
01:37:01,683 --> 01:37:05,529
''You didn't invite me... hut I
still came down your lane.''

1500
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:09,428
''You can punish me for
all unfair treatment.''

1501
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:12,631
''Don't spare your
beloved today...''

1502
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,738
“...because he never learns.“

1503
01:37:14,763 --> 01:37:18,210
''Your beatings feel so sweet.''

1504
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:22,443
''Come dear and hit me hard.''

1505
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:25,044
''Come dear and hit me hard.''

1506
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:28,679
''You're the only one I love.''

1507
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:33,150
''Come dear and hit me hard.''

1508
01:37:52,233 --> 01:38:00,233
''As my veil fluttered...''

1509
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:04,718
''you colored it with your love.''

1510
01:38:04,746 --> 01:38:09,252
''you colored it with your love.''

1511
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:17,417
''When I look into your eyes...''

1512
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:21,339
''my eyes were overwhelmed.''

1513
01:38:21,429 --> 01:38:25,605
''they were overwhelmed.''

1514
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:30,013
''My tear-filled eyes
couldn't sleep all night.''

1515
01:38:30,038 --> 01:38:32,040
''They are crazy about to you.''

1516
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:34,053
''They are crazy about to you.''

1517
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:38,046
''When I heard your
sweet talks...''

1518
01:38:38,213 --> 01:38:40,454
''my heart was hooked on.''

1519
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:42,825
''My heart was hooked on..''

1520
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:46,730
''I came to you leaving
the world behind.''

1521
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:51,194
''I severed all ties
just to he with you.''

1522
01:38:54,896 --> 01:38:56,967
''Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.''

1523
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:59,375
''Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.''

1524
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:03,314
''Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.''

1525
01:39:03,371 --> 01:39:07,285
''I've forsaken everything for you,
now punish me in any way you want.''

1526
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:10,879
''We're incomplete
without each other.''

1527
01:39:10,912 --> 01:39:15,292
''Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.''

1528
01:39:15,316 --> 01:39:19,287
''Chant Radhe-Radhe-Radhe-Radhe.''

1529
01:39:19,387 --> 01:39:24,302
''Pray to your God for me.''

1530
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:30,000
''I've let go of this shield.''

1531
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:31,835
''Color me red...''

1532
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:35,540
''only you can set
things right for me.''

1533
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:39,312
''Come dear and hit me hard.''

1534
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:41,712
''Come dear and hit me hard.''

1535
01:39:41,776 --> 01:39:45,189
''You're the only one I love.''

1536
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:49,890
''Come dear and hit me hard.''

1537
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:21,050
This is really
humiliating, brother.

1538
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,988
Stop acting like some Romeo.

1539
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,593
Let's go inside.. It's
your in-laws home.

1540
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:28,066
Throw your weight around.

1541
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,259
How can I show my face?

1542
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,338
I made a big mistake.

1543
01:40:42,803 --> 01:40:45,682
Well... you try talking
to sister-in-law.

1544
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:47,311
I'll wait for you
in that corner.

1545
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:51,381
And whoever hurled
that balloon at me...

1546
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:52,982
I'll show him when he
comes to my village.

1547
01:40:53,014 --> 01:40:55,119
I am keeping my mouth shut because
this is my sister-in-law's home.

1548
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:56,627
Otherwise I would've showed
you how we play Holi.

1549
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:46,710
That won't do any good.

1550
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:48,309
Apply some dirt.

1551
01:41:49,003 --> 01:41:50,209
Apply some dirt!

1552
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:51,843
Apply some <i>s***</i> instead.

1553
01:41:52,373 --> 01:41:54,216
You're never going to
move ahead of that.

1554
01:41:54,909 --> 01:41:56,718
You claim to have the best GK...

1555
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:59,451
hut never use it in real life.

1556
01:42:00,014 --> 01:42:01,584
Will dirt cure your wounds?

1557
01:42:02,717 --> 01:42:04,924
But it will definitely
cause infection.

1558
01:42:09,257 --> 01:42:12,170
You've all made a fine mess in the
name of tradition and customs.

1559
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:15,871
When in trouble, find
an easy way out.

1560
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:19,405
Change others, but not yourself.

1561
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:26,346
Since the time I was horn, I've
always used a toilet, Keshav.

1562
01:42:27,842 --> 01:42:29,515
Why should I change
my habit now?

1563
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:40,860
Listen... it's really
painful, isn't it?

1564
01:42:41,756 --> 01:42:43,429
You're the one who
got beaten up.

1565
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:52,736
But I gave you the wounds.

1566
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,848
Come hack home.

1567
01:42:58,039 --> 01:43:00,041
I swear I'll change everything.

1568
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,381
What will you change?

1569
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:05,655
Everyone's opinion?

1570
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:13,822
I won't die without you.

1571
01:43:15,423 --> 01:43:16,731
I am happy-

1572
01:43:54,429 --> 01:43:55,874
You didn't go?

1573
01:43:56,697 --> 01:44:02,113
You see, brother never leave a patient
in hospital or a lover alone.

1574
01:44:02,336 --> 01:44:04,509
What did sister-in-law
say? Is she coming hack?

1575
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:10,920
No, Naru. And she
shouldn't either.

1576
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,624
I finally realized now.

1577
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:18,553
How can she do something she
never did all her life?

1578
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,040
This isn't just about a loo...

1579
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:35,246
It's about everyone's view.

1580
01:44:36,037 --> 01:44:40,452
Jhoni... tell me
everything. What happened?

1581
01:44:40,575 --> 01:44:44,079
What can I say, grandma...
this is getting uncomfortable?

1582
01:44:44,512 --> 01:44:48,654
They're always in the jungle before
us, with their lights and camera.

1583
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:51,355
At first, we thought
its the shooting crew.

1584
01:44:51,653 --> 01:44:54,065
But soon we realized
they were after us.

1585
01:44:54,255 --> 01:44:56,235
Guess they are from
some news channel.

1586
01:44:56,624 --> 01:45:00,071
They record us like we're
indulging in foreplay.

1587
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:02,967
It's entirely Keshav
and his wife's fault.

1588
01:45:03,131 --> 01:45:07,671
Laxmi... what did she do now?

1589
01:45:08,002 --> 01:45:11,643
Your news was published in the
newspaper and we're paying the price.

1590
01:45:11,973 --> 01:45:15,921
Jhoni, you claim to he the
leader of IOTA party...

1591
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:18,215
then why so embarrassed
to come on TV?

1592
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,223
What are you saying, Keshav?

1593
01:45:20,315 --> 01:45:23,228
- Are you drunk?
- Yes, grandma, I am drunk.

1594
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:25,125
This is entirely
your fault, Keshav.

1595
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:26,927
Repercussions of getting
an educated wife.

1596
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:29,195
You should he thanking us.

1597
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:31,635
You've become a model at
this age, thanks to us.

1598
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:33,429
Every day you defecate
out in the open.

1599
01:45:33,594 --> 01:45:35,972
So how about showing some
skin for TV as well.

1600
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:52,586
It's alright, Panditji. He doesn't
know how to respect women.

1601
01:45:52,647 --> 01:45:56,026
The women in this country
can't respect themselves.

1602
01:45:56,417 --> 01:46:00,388
Otherwise, they would've never agreed
on defecating out in the open.

1603
01:46:07,628 --> 01:46:10,165

To hell with these people.

1606
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:43,199
We'll come up with a solution.

1607
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,237
- We'll...
- No, Naru.

1608
01:46:46,934 --> 01:46:49,039
We're done with finding
quick solutions.

1609
01:46:50,805 --> 01:46:52,682
It's time to do the impossible.

1611
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:04,159
The shooting is taking place on
the border of both the villages.

1612
01:47:04,318 --> 01:47:06,696
The shooting crew
has been warned...

1613
01:47:06,988 --> 01:47:08,990
that they should
stop wasting water.

1614
01:47:09,223 --> 01:47:11,533
The matter is under control now.

1615
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,601
The next agenda, Keshav's
wife has left him.

1616
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:19,968
And Keshav has put
in a request...

1617
01:47:20,034 --> 01:47:23,015
to build a public toilet
outside the village.

1618
01:47:23,137 --> 01:47:28,746
Those who agree can sign or put their
thumb impression on this paper.

We won't give our
thumb impression.

1621
01:47:37,218 --> 01:47:40,791
Young man, did you get this
idea from the shooting crew?

1622
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:45,928
People won't forget their values
even if you build loos for them.

1623
01:47:46,026 --> 01:47:47,937
And stop defecating
in the fields?

1624
01:47:47,995 --> 01:47:50,441
Keep this stupidity
restrained to your home.

1625
01:47:50,565 --> 01:47:52,567
Stop joking, village-head.

1626

If you try to burden us
with your problems...

1628
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,416
then, we'll have
to face the music.

1629
01:47:58,539 --> 01:48:00,280
We got freedom from
the British rule...

1630
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:02,582
do you want us to he
slave to their culture?

1631
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:04,021
That isn't right, village-head.

1632
01:48:04,312 --> 01:48:05,689
There are other women
in the village.

1633
01:48:05,713 --> 01:48:08,091
And their safety is the village
council's responsibility.

1634

- We're happy with our IOTA party.
- Yes.

1635
01:48:10,718 --> 01:48:13,824
And what about openly
humiliating yourself.

1636
01:48:14,055 --> 01:48:16,899
Keshav, don't talk
about respect.

1637
01:48:16,957 --> 01:48:18,937
Your wife left you.

1638
01:48:19,426 --> 01:48:21,167
Show some respect to others.

1639
01:48:21,195 --> 01:48:24,108
That's what he wants. That
we <i>s***</i> in our homes.

1640
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:25,768
Or maybe <i>s***</i> in our kitchens.

1641
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:27,813
I only want the
village council...

1642
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:31,214
to put in a request with the
government for a toilet.

1643

Don't try to teach us
our responsibility.

1644

This is an ancestral village.

1645
01:48:35,309 --> 01:48:37,983
Our ancestors didn't build
a toilet in our homes...

1646
01:48:38,045 --> 01:48:39,649
and we're not Gods either.

1647
01:48:39,714 --> 01:48:42,627
If we build a bathroom in our
homes, won't that dirty our homes.

1648

And what about the stink.

1649
01:48:44,585 --> 01:48:46,064
You want us to invite
diseases in our homes.

1650
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:48,894
Don't try to teach the
villagers, Keshav.

1651
01:48:48,956 --> 01:48:50,958
- We don't want a bathroom.
- Of course.

not bother the government.

01:52:19,867 --> 01:52:21,346
- Brother...
- Hold on.

1711
01:52:21,702 --> 01:52:25,673
Where are these... 3000 Cr
toilets. Can you show me?

1712
01:52:25,873 --> 01:52:29,787
I see... the public's awakening.

1713
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:32,750
Well, finally after
all these years...

1714
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:35,158
someone came asking
for an explanation.

1715
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,583
What do you want from me?

1716
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:40,063
Toilets... which the
government promised us.

1717
01:52:40,554 --> 01:52:44,263
Actually... I am
going to expose you.

1718
01:52:44,358 --> 01:52:45,598
I see...

1719
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:49,732
See that you don't
expose yourselves.

1720
01:52:52,166 --> 01:52:54,578
Take a good look, guys.

1721
01:52:56,303 --> 01:52:59,409
This is a barber shop,
horse-stable...

1722
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,147
and this lane's a tailor shop.

1723
01:53:01,241 --> 01:53:03,243
So what does that prove?

1724
01:53:03,377 --> 01:53:05,448
All these are public toilets...

1725
01:53:05,545 --> 01:53:07,752
which you guys are using for
your personal benefits.

1726
01:53:08,014 --> 01:53:11,120
The government makes
toilet schemes...

1727
01:53:11,352 --> 01:53:13,093
hut you guys reject it.

1728
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:15,460
And you guys don't care.
To hell with the funds.

1729
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:18,662
We won't build a
toilet in our homes.

1730
01:53:20,327 --> 01:53:23,399
Look at this Keshav, the
plan for your home.

1731
01:53:23,731 --> 01:53:24,801
Few of the homes
in your village...

1732
01:53:24,832 --> 01:53:26,607
were built under the government
rehabilitation scheme.

1733
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:28,111
But the rest are
ancestral homes.

1734
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:32,379
So there was never any facility
for toilets in our home.

1735
01:53:32,406 --> 01:53:35,478
The government installed
sewage lines in your homes.

1736
01:53:35,576 --> 01:53:37,453
But you guys shut it down.

1737
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:38,884
That's not done.

1738
01:53:39,246 --> 01:53:41,055
The government made
arrangements...

1739
01:53:41,282 --> 01:53:45,424
hut connecting the sewage
with your toilet is your job.

1740
01:53:46,887 --> 01:53:48,889
So who's the villain now?

1741
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,929
You mean we don't
have an option now.

1742
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,630
Do you know what's a PIL?

1743
01:53:54,929 --> 01:53:56,738
Public Interest Litigation.

1744
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,002
Go see a lawyer.

1745
01:53:58,165 --> 01:53:59,644
Register a PIL against
the Village Council...

1746
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,544
that you want a toilet
in your village.

1747
01:54:01,769 --> 01:54:03,612
Well, finally after
all these years...

1748
01:54:03,938 --> 01:54:07,647
at least someone thought
that toilet is a problem.

1749
01:54:08,542 --> 01:54:10,613
Actually sir, until the problem
doesn't get personal...

1750
01:54:10,644 --> 01:54:13,386
no lane's prepared to
fight... or find a solution.

1751
01:54:23,524 --> 01:54:25,003
- Sir, can I come in?
- Come.

1752
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:50,595
- Uncle, show me your face.
- Yes.

1753
01:54:50,617 --> 01:54:51,755
- Uncle.
- Taking my picture. Wait...

1754
01:54:51,785 --> 01:54:53,093
- Taking my picture. Wait...
- Uncle.

1755
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,728
I took this picture at the turn.

1756
01:54:55,689 --> 01:54:57,965
This is a barber-shop,
this one is a tailor-shop.

1757
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:00,437
This one is a cowshed, Isn't
this what the lawyer said?

1758
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:20,119
Sir, I've brought all the
proof. What should we do next?

1759
01:55:38,632 --> 01:55:39,633
This will get the job done.

1760
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,004
I'll get a sanction from the government
get a toilet built in Mandgaon.

1761
01:55:43,237 --> 01:55:44,238
- Okay?
- Yes.

1762
01:55:44,838 --> 01:55:47,250
It will take 11 months.

1763
01:55:48,142 --> 01:55:50,645
Well, that's almost a year.

1764
01:55:50,711 --> 01:55:52,691
It's the government...

1765
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:54,687
works at its own pace.

1766
01:55:54,748 --> 01:55:57,126
All these years you
lived without a toilet.

1767
01:55:57,351 --> 01:55:58,955
Another yea r. Right.

1768
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:04,727
I can live without a toilet
but without my wife.

1769
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:11,235
Remember who's the villain,
in this case, Keshav.

1770
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:13,711
You're challenging our culture.

1771
01:56:14,535 --> 01:56:15,536
Understood!

1772
01:56:16,403 --> 01:56:19,509
And it's not easy to
win over culture.

1773
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:21,447
This is a difficult trial.

1774
01:56:22,042 --> 01:56:26,115
In this country, fighting against
culture is not an easy task.

1775
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:36,797
Brother, I have an idea now...

1776
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:40,138
what this culture is
everyone's ranting about.

1777
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,230
Who is it?

1778
01:56:42,162 --> 01:56:45,541
Culture is something no
one's seen or heard of...

1779
01:56:45,565 --> 01:56:47,545
yet, everyone's
clinging on to it.

1780
01:56:48,034 --> 01:56:51,208
Culture is what makes us put donation
boxes in temples and mosques...

1781
01:56:51,305 --> 01:56:54,514
hut makes humans defecate out
in the open like animals.

1782
01:56:54,574 --> 01:56:55,780
That's culture.

1783
01:57:01,415 --> 01:57:04,794
[CHANTING PRAYER]

1784
01:57:19,933 --> 01:57:21,708
What is he doing?

1785
01:57:36,617 --> 01:57:38,290
This is a pandit's
home after all.

1786
01:57:38,685 --> 01:57:41,393
So veneration is a must before
starting any good deed.

1787
01:57:41,922 --> 01:57:43,060
For the sake of your happiness.

1788
01:57:43,223 --> 01:57:45,169
What good deed, son?

1789
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:46,737
Laying the foundation
stone, grandma.

1790
01:57:47,494 --> 01:57:48,939
I'm building a
toilet in our home.

1791
01:57:49,929 --> 01:57:51,931
Now, change your
thinking, father.

1792
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:54,242
And stop peeing out
in the gutter.

1793
01:57:57,170 --> 01:57:58,240
Okay, son.

1794
01:58:00,007 --> 01:58:01,509
You've crossed all limits.

1795
01:58:02,109 --> 01:58:03,315
Do as you please.

1796
01:58:05,112 --> 01:58:08,093
I won't eat a
morsel of food now.

1797
01:58:08,182 --> 01:58:10,253
Great, no food, no stress.

1798
01:58:10,818 --> 01:58:11,990
Radhe-Radhe.

1799
01:58:14,655 --> 01:58:16,259
What... What's he...

1800
01:58:26,867 --> 01:58:28,744
''The world's preparing
to land on Mars...''

1801
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,506
''while the moon's
being sold on earth.''

1802
01:58:34,908 --> 01:58:36,615
''From black/white to color...''

1803
01:58:36,677 --> 01:58:38,554
''and now everything's in 3D.''

1804
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:42,218
“Thousands have climbed...
the Everest...“

1805
01:58:42,249 --> 01:58:48,200
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1806
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:54,001
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1807
01:58:55,162 --> 01:58:58,371
''How long are you going to keep
doing it around the hush?''

1808
01:58:58,398 --> 01:59:04,144
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1809
01:59:04,905 --> 01:59:07,010
- Can I give you an idea?
- What?

1810
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,485
Leave the bathroom uncovered.

1811
01:59:09,409 --> 01:59:10,046
Why?

1812
01:59:10,177 --> 01:59:11,986
Are you going to bury
Anarkali in here?

1813
01:59:12,112 --> 01:59:14,023
Go on... hurry up.

1814
01:59:15,382 --> 01:59:16,520
Father...

1815
01:59:18,218 --> 01:59:21,222
Father, your meal..
Please eat your meal.

1816
01:59:22,556 --> 01:59:26,800
''Defecating in the open
is humiliating...''

1817
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:30,564
''that's what culture tells us.''

1818
01:59:30,797 --> 01:59:35,007
''Cover yourself
till your waist...''

1819
01:59:35,101 --> 01:59:38,810
''and sit out in the open.''

1820
01:59:38,838 --> 01:59:40,818
''Sister-in-law sets out
at crack of dawn...''

1821
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:43,014
''while the boys are waiting
on the way to ogle.''

1822
01:59:43,076 --> 01:59:46,285
''Sit hack and watch
what happens.''

1823
01:59:46,313 --> 01:59:52,093
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1824
01:59:52,152 --> 01:59:57,864
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1825
01:59:59,092 --> 02:00:02,266
''How long are you going to
keep heating around the hush?''

1826
02:00:02,295 --> 02:00:07,973
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1827
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:18,745
''Every lane of the country is stinking,
it's difficult to even breathe.''

1828
02:00:18,812 --> 02:00:22,760
''India will he clean again look
at the condition of your home.''

1829
02:00:22,816 --> 02:00:24,796
''If you sit next
to the river...''

1830
02:00:24,818 --> 02:00:26,798
''the water will
wash it all away.''

1831
02:00:26,853 --> 02:00:28,560
''And that water will flow
through the taps...''

1832
02:00:28,588 --> 02:00:30,864
''and you'll he forced
to drink that.''

1833
02:00:30,924 --> 02:00:34,804
''Stop going to defecation
in the field.''

1834
02:00:34,828 --> 02:00:38,799
''Stop other people
from going too.''

1835
02:00:38,832 --> 02:00:42,575
''If defecating in the open is a matter
of pride then stop wearing clothes.''

1836
02:00:42,602 --> 02:00:46,812
''Not everything is a tradition,
stop hiding behind it.''

1837
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,786
''Stop hiding behind it.''

1838
02:00:48,809 --> 02:00:51,221
''Stop hiding behind it.''

1839
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:54,248
''Don't blame culture
for your faults.''

1840
02:00:54,314 --> 02:01:00,128
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1841
02:01:00,153 --> 02:01:06,001
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1842
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,134
''How long are you going to
keep heating around the hush?''

1843
02:01:10,163 --> 02:01:16,011
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1844
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:21,982
“Mister... better
build a toilet now.“

1845
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:08,198
Hey...

1846
02:02:09,923 --> 02:02:10,924
Slop!

1847
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:29,484
Keshav, stop. Stop'' Keshav.

1848
02:02:40,187 --> 02:02:40,995
Slop!

1849
02:02:42,989 --> 02:02:44,935
Leave him Keshav. What
are you doing? Leave me.

1850
02:02:44,958 --> 02:02:47,097
Keshav. Leave me.

1851
02:03:02,242 --> 02:03:03,152
Get lost...

1852
02:03:03,777 --> 02:03:04,915
Get lost...

1853
02:03:05,278 --> 02:03:06,416
Get lost...

1854
02:03:07,047 --> 02:03:08,025
Get lost...

1855
02:03:08,681 --> 02:03:09,819
Don't come in front of me.

1856
02:03:09,883 --> 02:03:14,525
- What happened, brother?
- Naru, the calamity's been averted.

1857
02:03:14,954 --> 02:03:17,560
A Brahmin's home was saved
from getting tainted.

1858
02:03:18,358 --> 02:03:20,167
Nothing is ever going
to change here.

1859
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,267
If you get hurt, apply dirt.

1860
02:03:22,695 --> 02:03:24,675
<i>U you get a swam, any' gum.</i>

1861
02:03:26,433 --> 02:03:28,208
If shitting and toilets
are such a had thing...

1862
02:03:28,268 --> 02:03:29,906
then why did God
give us a stomach?

1863
02:03:30,003 --> 02:03:31,744
No stomach, no loo.

1864
02:03:32,406 --> 02:03:36,081
Headman, open your
scriptures and tell me...

1865
02:03:36,476 --> 02:03:39,423
Is it our moral obligation to make
a spectacle out of our wife...

1866
02:03:39,446 --> 02:03:41,289
or does <i>sh***</i> out in the
open give us salvation?

1867
02:03:41,614 --> 02:03:42,684
Tell me!

1868
02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:52,803
Savri... you don't feel
embarrassed having six kids.

1869
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:55,428
But you feel embarrassed
to talk about toilets.

1870
02:03:56,462 --> 02:04:00,467
People like them associate
shame with religion.

1871
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,706
You people.

1872
02:04:02,068 --> 02:04:03,547
You should he ashamed.

1873
02:04:09,075 --> 02:04:11,817
Panditji... you were
so embarrassed...

1874
02:04:11,845 --> 02:04:14,189
to read about your daughter-in-law
in the newspaper.

1875
02:04:14,214 --> 02:04:17,093
But no shame in peeing
out in the gutter.

1876
02:04:17,417 --> 02:04:20,023
It's quite obvious that
the women are fleeing.

1877
02:04:20,353 --> 02:04:22,993
We're stuck in this
blind game of religion.

1878
02:04:23,256 --> 02:04:29,901
Pretty soon... no one will ever give
you their daughter's hand again.

1879
02:04:30,096 --> 02:04:32,406
Everyone will die as bachelors.

1880
02:04:35,535 --> 02:04:36,741
Go on...

1881
02:04:37,003 --> 02:04:40,815
Go home... celebrate.

1882
02:04:41,341 --> 02:04:43,343
Tell stories to your children...

1883
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:47,924
About how we bravehearts
broke Keshav's Taj Mahal!

1884
02:04:47,948 --> 02:04:50,519
Go on... tell them!

1885
02:05:05,499 --> 02:05:06,944
Grandma...

1886
02:05:07,734 --> 02:05:11,341
Grandma... set the
plate for your son.

1887
02:05:11,571 --> 02:05:13,642
He'll break his fast today.

1888
02:05:14,073 --> 02:05:15,984
He just broke the entire house.

1889
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,386
He broke everything.

1890
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:36,855
''I feel so unfortunate.''

1891
02:05:44,337 --> 02:05:52,337
''I don't deserve you.''

1892
02:05:59,719 --> 02:06:07,719
''Nothing's more...''
''complicated than love.''

1893
02:06:15,668 --> 02:06:19,480
Yeah, Jaya. I tried everything.

1894
02:06:21,007 --> 02:06:23,214
We must wait for 11 months.

1895
02:06:23,677 --> 02:06:24,951
No, Keshav.

1896
02:06:26,546 --> 02:06:28,457
Don't call me again.

1897
02:06:30,283 --> 02:06:33,730
And if you think I am joking,
then don't he mistaken.

1898
02:06:33,887 --> 02:06:35,059
I have an idea.

1899
02:06:44,464 --> 02:06:46,171
I'll get the Goswami Road fixed.

1900
02:06:46,499 --> 02:06:48,172
I'll get it fixed from my quota.

1901
02:06:48,234 --> 02:06:49,679
Look what's published in the
newspaper, village-head.

1902
02:06:49,735 --> 02:06:50,736
Calamity has befallen
on our village.

1903
02:06:50,803 --> 02:06:52,282
Divorce for a toilet.

1904
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,083
Our village has been jinxed.

1905
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,646
This is a complete disaster.

1906
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:59,584
Our village will he disgraced
in the entire district.

1907
02:06:59,946 --> 02:07:02,756
Too much education
isn't good either.

1908
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:05,494
This is really had.

1909
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:07,723
Brother Keshav is doomed.

1910
02:07:07,854 --> 02:07:10,767
Where can he go? He can't
stay in this village anymore.

1911
02:07:10,924 --> 02:07:13,666
There's been no divorce in our
village for the last 1700 years.

1912
02:07:13,793 --> 02:07:15,773
This is really
terrible, Panditji.

1913
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:17,406
What can I say?

1914
02:07:18,331 --> 02:07:20,572
I never imagined I'll ever
hear this word in my life.

1915
02:07:21,501 --> 02:07:22,775
She wants a divorce.

1916
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,581
Does she think it's a joke?

1917
02:07:25,171 --> 02:07:28,084
Sir, isn't he the same
Keshav who came to meet you?

1918
02:07:30,409 --> 02:07:33,447
No, he's the same 'Keshav'
who started 'Mahabharata'.

1919
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:35,921
That 'Keshav' matter is
getting a lot of attention.

1920
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:37,621
We're here to
interview his wife.

1921
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:38,958
I'll tell you once I get there.

1922
02:07:40,553 --> 02:07:42,590
Keep the bathroom
in the background.

1923
02:07:43,523 --> 02:07:45,662
This story is about Jaya
from Sahrana village...

1924
02:07:45,758 --> 02:07:49,331
who is going to divorce her husband
just 6 months after their wedding.

1925
02:07:49,496 --> 02:07:50,907
Reason; toilet.

1926
02:07:54,367 --> 02:07:58,110
Jaya, are you actually divorcing
your husband for a toilet?

1927
02:07:59,639 --> 02:08:01,585
Don't you think this
reason is good enough?

1928
02:08:01,774 --> 02:08:04,084
You've been here since morning.
You came all the way from Delhi.

1929
02:08:04,344 --> 02:08:05,687
Did you use the bathroom?

1930
02:08:05,979 --> 02:08:08,391
Actually, we have a vanity
van, which has a...

1931
02:08:08,414 --> 02:08:10,792
That's why you think this
is not an actual problem.

1932
02:08:10,817 --> 02:08:14,321
I advise you to stay here one
night. Go out with IOTA party.

1933
02:08:14,721 --> 02:08:16,928
Sit out in the open amongst snakes,
scorpions and other animals.

1934
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:19,292
And then you'll
realize my problem.

1935
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:22,731
See... she's openly describing
her deeds on television.

1936
02:08:23,496 --> 02:08:26,477
Keshav, do you think that the
government is responsible?

1937
02:08:26,766 --> 02:08:29,076
Honestly, we're to
he blamed first.

1938
02:08:29,335 --> 02:08:32,009
The scam happened because
we didn't want a toilet.

1939
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:33,740
We love our fields.

1940
02:08:34,107 --> 02:08:37,418
And the government distributed
free notebooks to the children...

1941
02:08:37,443 --> 02:08:39,719
hut didn't tell them
what to write in them.

1942
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:42,625
They built toilets, but didn't
teach anyone how to use it.

1943
02:08:42,816 --> 02:08:45,490
This is the government's
responsibility as well.

1944
02:08:45,685 --> 02:08:47,460
They only carried out
half of their tasks.

1945
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:49,927
But the government has been
promoting this campaign a lot.

1946
02:08:50,222 --> 02:08:53,431
And built around 6 million
toilets in the last three years.

1947
02:08:53,826 --> 02:08:55,134
They built toilets..

1948
02:08:55,328 --> 02:08:57,808
hut it's high time the government
made certain laws as well.

1949
02:08:58,131 --> 02:08:59,371
What laws?

1950
02:08:59,499 --> 02:09:01,911
Use toilets for defecating.

1951
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:04,775
Keshav, you built a
toilet in your home.

1952
02:09:04,904 --> 02:09:06,281
Who broke that?

1953
02:09:06,539 --> 02:09:10,749
The men of our country feel really
proud to do it out in the open.

1954
02:09:11,544 --> 02:09:15,082
Some narrow-minded
guy broke my toilet.

1955
02:09:16,382 --> 02:09:19,056
- So...
- Actually, it was my father.

1956
02:09:20,019 --> 02:09:22,431
So you mean to say you'll never
do it out in the open again.

1957
02:09:22,722 --> 02:09:25,635
Well, hack in the days I
would stand anywhere.

1958
02:09:25,725 --> 02:09:28,535
But now I'll only stand
up for a bathroom.

1959
02:09:29,262 --> 02:09:32,141
You must have faced a lot of
humiliation for this divorce.

1960
02:09:32,165 --> 02:09:34,805
If I make a mistake, I'm
hound to get insulted.

1961
02:09:35,201 --> 02:09:36,874
There must he a
toilet in the house.

1962
02:09:37,137 --> 02:09:39,617
There must he a toilet in
the house for the women.

1963
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:41,752
So that, men can stop them
from wandering outside.

1964
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:44,755
Wonderful, madam. Such a twisted
question for such a simple answer.

1965
02:09:45,044 --> 02:09:47,115
Are you from foreign channel?

1966
02:09:47,547 --> 02:09:50,460
Real freedom isn't about
going out to defecate.

1967
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:53,929
It's about going out
on your own free will.

1968
02:09:54,487 --> 02:09:56,797
But who will explain
to these idiots?

1969
02:09:57,256 --> 02:10:00,465
Our fight is against...
this. Their views.

1970
02:10:00,693 --> 02:10:01,899
Their views.

1971
02:10:02,161 --> 02:10:05,540
But if you lose this fight,
you can lose your wife too.

1972
02:10:05,698 --> 02:10:07,803
I can lose her in the
open jungle as well.

1973
02:10:08,034 --> 02:10:10,412
I would rather lose
her like this.

1974
02:10:11,104 --> 02:10:12,549
It's quite simple, madam.

1975
02:10:12,572 --> 02:10:16,213
If you want your wife, you
got to have a toilet.

1976
02:10:21,781 --> 02:10:24,387
Jaya, who do you think is
responsible for this divorce.

1977
02:10:24,583 --> 02:10:26,620
The government or our tradition.

1978
02:10:27,353 --> 02:10:31,358
The women... who'll set out
again tomorrow at dawn.

1979
02:10:36,062 --> 02:10:40,169
Jaya from Sahrana village is still
steadfast on her decision of a divorce.

1980
02:10:40,233 --> 02:10:42,839
Will this affect the government
officials in anyway?

1981
02:10:44,337 --> 02:10:46,647
There's going to he a war.

1982
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:55,717
All our past scams will
get exposed, Yadav.

1983
02:10:55,748 --> 02:10:56,954
DO You get it?

1984
02:10:58,417 --> 02:11:00,897
I guess even we'll have to
bathe out in the open now.

1985
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,524
I can see stars
in daylight, sir.

1986
02:11:02,588 --> 02:11:03,566
I told you before...

1987
02:11:03,656 --> 02:11:04,726
You should've carried
out a part of the work.

1988
02:11:04,891 --> 02:11:05,961
Now the CM's called
for a meeting.

1989
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:08,104
This is wrong, Swamiji.

1990
02:11:08,261 --> 02:11:09,604
This country will
never progress.

1991
02:11:09,629 --> 02:11:11,870
What was the result
of this movement?

1992
02:11:12,165 --> 02:11:17,410
Build toilets! Build toilets!

1993
02:11:18,237 --> 02:11:19,716
Calm down!

1994
02:11:20,973 --> 02:11:22,782
Our country is going backwards.

1995
02:11:24,644 --> 02:11:27,056
Well, there's been some
activity within the government.

1996
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:30,189
From 11 months, its
come down to 10 months.

1997
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:34,293
If the government functions any faster
then it will definitely collapse.

1998
02:11:45,632 --> 02:11:47,839
I'm a Brahmin too.

1999
02:11:48,501 --> 02:11:52,472
I'll have water as well as tea.

2000
02:11:53,272 --> 02:11:54,876
Yes, I'll get it.

2001
02:11:57,944 --> 02:11:59,321
Tell me something, Pandit.

2002
02:12:00,146 --> 02:12:02,422
Do you watch Sunny
Leone's movies?

2003
02:12:03,516 --> 02:12:05,257
Radhe-Radhe.

2004
02:12:07,553 --> 02:12:09,965
Is this what you wanted to ask?

2005
02:12:10,556 --> 02:12:13,127
You've been living alone
for so many years.

2006
02:12:14,326 --> 02:12:16,772
I'm sure you watch it secretly.

2007
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:20,203
This was expected from you.

2008
02:12:20,433 --> 02:12:22,640
One can see your values
reflecting in your daughter.

2009
02:12:22,802 --> 02:12:24,008
That's true.

2010
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:27,815
We taught her to speak up,
instead of staying quiet.

2011
02:12:29,075 --> 02:12:32,989
Your values about entering this
house with the help of a lie.

2012
02:12:33,212 --> 02:12:37,092
The values of maligning the family honor
by giving an interview on television.

2013
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:41,321
And complicating a simple
issue like a toilet.

2014
02:12:41,621 --> 02:12:43,464
Even you admit it's an
uncomplicated issue.

2015
02:12:43,489 --> 02:12:45,594
So build a toilet at home too.

2016
02:12:46,092 --> 02:12:47,366
I see...

2017
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:49,865
So you want us to
build a toilet...

2018
02:12:49,962 --> 02:12:51,441
in the same courtyard
where we Pray to 'Tulsi'.

2019
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:53,444
Unbelievable, Panditji.

2020
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,111
You Pray to the Ganga as well.

2021
02:12:56,469 --> 02:12:58,710
But don't you wash
your sins in it too?

2022
02:12:59,238 --> 02:13:00,740
You won't build a
toilet in your home...

2023
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:02,942
hut, you've turned the entire
country into a big loo.

2024
02:13:03,042 --> 02:13:07,889
You can open your zipper, or untie
your draw-strings wherever you like.

2025
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:10,490
Change with time.

2026
02:13:11,784 --> 02:13:12,888
Change?

2027
02:13:13,752 --> 02:13:15,356
And forget our culture.

2028
02:13:15,454 --> 02:13:19,300
People like you have reduced
culture to just 'Sanskrit.'

2029
02:13:19,325 --> 02:13:22,898
Joshi... we live
for our culture...

2030
02:13:23,296 --> 02:13:26,334
and we Pandits can even
die for our culture.

2031
02:13:27,133 --> 02:13:28,942
I know you got
Japanese degrees...

2032
02:13:29,068 --> 02:13:31,070
hut, have you ever read
the holy scriptures?

2033
02:13:31,938 --> 02:13:35,545
Lord Krishna addressed a
grave problem in Gita.

2034
02:13:35,775 --> 02:13:39,245
The world fights with each other but
only the brave fights with himself.

2035
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:42,556
If you can conquer over
yourself, Pandit...

2036
02:13:43,082 --> 02:13:46,325
then, you can save the children's
world from falling apart.

2037
02:13:48,821 --> 02:13:50,323
And remember...

2038
02:13:51,224 --> 02:13:55,400
If you change nothing,
nothing will chance.

2039
02:13:56,095 --> 02:13:57,472
Radhe-Radhe.

2040
02:14:12,244 --> 02:14:14,485
There's nothing more
we can do, Keshav.

2041
02:14:15,948 --> 02:14:19,794
We failed to rattle the government
or change father's opinion.

2042
02:14:22,221 --> 02:14:24,667
All our plans backfired.

2043
02:14:26,292 --> 02:14:28,898
Even our plans of getting
a 'divorce' failed.

2044
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:37,305
So what?

2045
02:14:39,638 --> 02:14:43,211
Tomorrow morning we'll go to the court
and withdraw our divorce petition.

2046
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:47,555
We'll leave our home...

2047
02:14:47,913 --> 02:14:49,790
and build our own little abode.

2048
02:14:51,417 --> 02:14:53,658
I cannot break
your home, Keshav.

2049
02:14:59,058 --> 02:15:01,197
But I can break this marriage.

2050
02:15:09,368 --> 02:15:11,575
This isn't just my fight alone.

2051
02:15:14,373 --> 02:15:17,479
Every daughter, every
woman has her eyes on me.

2052
02:15:19,078 --> 02:15:20,386
If I give up now...

2053
02:15:20,413 --> 02:15:23,019
no woman will ever fight
for her right again.

2054
02:15:28,253 --> 02:15:29,926
See... now you sound
like a leader.

2055
02:15:35,127 --> 02:15:36,128
Sorry...

2056
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:40,141
I couldn't he your wife.

2057
02:15:40,666 --> 02:15:45,672
You became my wife the day you served
father dinner after the entire fiasco...

2058
02:15:45,804 --> 02:15:47,909
and even went out to the fields.

2059
02:15:50,042 --> 02:15:51,715
And today... when you're
prepared to leave me...

2060
02:15:51,744 --> 02:15:53,314
to bring a change
in this country.

2061
02:15:57,116 --> 02:16:00,689
That's more like Keshav's wife.

2062
02:16:04,023 --> 02:16:06,060
And as far as our
divorce is concerned...

2063
02:16:06,358 --> 02:16:07,462
Give me your phone.

2064
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:12,002
Here...

2065
02:16:12,198 --> 02:16:14,200
I've deleted your number.

2066
02:16:17,570 --> 02:16:19,914
I can even walk the
gallows for you.

2067
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,920
Divorce is a very small step.

2068
02:16:26,178 --> 02:16:28,180
See you tomorrow at
the family court.

2069
02:16:29,448 --> 02:16:30,483
Radhe-Radhe.

2070
02:16:35,421 --> 02:16:37,901
Come on... I'll drop you home.

2071
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:43,100
I swear I won't elope
with you. Come on.

2072
02:16:44,296 --> 02:16:52,113
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

2073
02:16:57,877 --> 02:17:03,418
''I used to feel... love's
too far-fetched for me...''

2074
02:17:03,716 --> 02:17:09,029
“...because I have no dreams.“

2075
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:14,432
''I am completely
lost in your eyes.''

2076
02:17:14,493 --> 02:17:19,636
''Like sandalwood
dissolves in water.''

2077
02:17:19,665 --> 02:17:27,665
''The heart's willing
to do anything.''

2078
02:17:28,207 --> 02:17:35,716
''Quit smiling, silly,
or I'll fall in love.''

2079
02:17:40,453 --> 02:17:43,195
These days if there's an
argument the wife quits home.

2080
02:17:43,722 --> 02:17:45,633
Even if the husband's
Hrithik Roshan.

2081
02:17:46,158 --> 02:17:47,762
You're absolutely right.

2082
02:17:47,926 --> 02:17:49,701
That Joshi's daughter
didn't give up.

2083
02:17:49,929 --> 02:17:51,431
She's going to the court...

2084
02:17:51,697 --> 02:17:53,699
They might even get divorced.

2085
02:17:53,799 --> 02:17:56,441
Honestly speaking, her
husband really loved her.

2086
02:17:56,453 --> 02:17:57,337
Yes.

2087
02:17:57,403 --> 02:17:59,906
Didn't you see... he
tried his level best.

2088
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:01,212
But to what avail?

2089
02:18:01,307 --> 02:18:03,218
Just another charade
without a reason.

2090
02:18:03,375 --> 02:18:05,252
For such small things who creates
an issue. She only made a scene.

2091
02:18:05,477 --> 02:18:08,754
Who runs away from home and demands
divorce for such trivial issues?

2092
02:18:09,081 --> 02:18:11,152
I thought her demand was valid.

2093
02:18:11,217 --> 02:18:13,094
What did she ask for?

2094
02:18:13,319 --> 02:18:15,526
Poor thing wasn't used to
going out in the open...

2095
02:18:15,554 --> 02:18:16,328
what else could she have done?

2096
02:18:16,355 --> 02:18:19,199
So now she can sit in
her toilet proudly.

2097
02:18:19,492 --> 02:18:20,129
And us?

2098
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:30,770
We'll keep going
out... like we do.

2099
02:18:34,206 --> 02:18:37,949
You know... what would've happened
if we had made the same demand?

2100
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:40,916
Don't talk to me in Jaya's tone.

2101
02:18:41,413 --> 02:18:42,517
What happened?

2102
02:18:43,015 --> 02:18:44,824
She only brought
disgrace to our village.

2103
02:18:44,950 --> 02:18:47,658
- Come on... serve dinner.
- I didn't cook dinner.

2104
02:18:47,686 --> 02:18:48,960
What do you mean you
didn't cook dinner?

2105
02:18:49,188 --> 02:18:51,361
If we eat, we'll have to go.

2106
02:18:51,690 --> 02:18:53,692
No food, no going out.

2107
02:18:53,993 --> 02:18:55,404
Have you lost your mind?

2108
02:18:56,361 --> 02:18:58,671
Actually, it all
makes sense now.

2109
02:19:33,932 --> 02:19:37,004
- Vimu...
- Who?

2110
02:19:37,136 --> 02:19:38,581
- Oh, my...
- Mother!

2111
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:42,208
- Oh, my...
- Mother!

2112
02:19:43,241 --> 02:19:44,413
What happened?

2113
02:19:45,311 --> 02:19:47,518
- What happened?
- I think I broke a hone.

2114
02:19:47,579 --> 02:19:49,183
But how did you fall down?

2115
02:19:49,281 --> 02:19:51,591
- Someone spilled oil here.
- Oil?

2116
02:19:51,617 --> 02:19:53,654
I was going towards the field.

2117
02:19:53,819 --> 02:19:55,730
Quickly, take me to the field.

2118
02:19:55,787 --> 02:19:58,097
Hurry up... quickly. Pick me up.

2119
02:19:59,391 --> 02:20:00,597
Mother...

2120
02:20:01,193 --> 02:20:01,966
Mother...

2121
02:20:01,978 --> 02:20:04,333
No.. I don't think I can
walk all the way to the field.

2122
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:07,707
- And I can't control it any longer either.
- Mother..

2123
02:20:07,766 --> 02:20:10,679
- Quickly... lift me up.
- Mother''.

2124
02:20:13,138 --> 02:20:15,311
Can I go in there?

2125
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:23,388
What are you thinking?
Your mother is dying!

2126
02:20:24,683 --> 02:20:27,357
Quickly... lift me up.

2127
02:20:27,419 --> 02:20:29,365
Mother, no.. No..

2128
02:20:29,921 --> 02:20:31,901
Lift me up.

2129
02:20:31,957 --> 02:20:35,530
Lift me up. Oh, God! Oh, God!

2130
02:20:37,596 --> 02:20:38,267
Careful.

2131
02:20:38,296 --> 02:20:41,277
Quickly, take me. Take me, son.

2132
02:20:41,466 --> 02:20:45,642
Take me quickly. Oh, God!

2133
02:22:09,154 --> 02:22:14,069
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2134
02:22:14,092 --> 02:22:19,303
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2135
02:22:19,465 --> 02:22:21,308
If Jaya Joshi gets a divorce...

2136
02:22:21,399 --> 02:22:22,969
then, we'll all get a divorce.

2137
02:22:23,034 --> 02:22:27,813
We can't defecate
out in the open!

2138
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:29,981
We'll fight. Take
down our request.

2139
02:22:30,042 --> 02:22:31,077
This is not the way.

2140
02:22:31,142 --> 02:22:33,247
Why don't you understand? This
is not how you get a divorce.

2141
02:22:33,278 --> 02:22:34,848
I request you, please go away.

2142
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:36,653
- We also want a divorce.
- Just go from here.

2143
02:22:36,982 --> 02:22:39,292
We've all heard about
mass marriages...

2144
02:22:39,351 --> 02:22:41,490
hut never about mass
divorce before today.

2145
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,591
One reason; toilet.

2146
02:22:43,955 --> 02:22:46,401
This is a challenge
to the government.

2147
02:22:47,058 --> 02:22:48,537
- Verma.
- Yes, sir.

2148
02:22:48,827 --> 02:22:49,897
What is this?

2149
02:22:49,928 --> 02:22:52,067
Bureaucracy, sir.

2150
02:22:52,197 --> 02:22:53,972
From society welfare
committee to the village...

2151
02:22:53,999 --> 02:22:56,172
the files have to go
through seven offices.

2152
02:22:56,301 --> 02:22:58,281
And they all have their...

2153
02:22:58,337 --> 02:22:59,372
Understood!

2154
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:01,412
Verma, do one thing today.

2155
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:03,083
Then buy seven locks...

2156
02:23:03,442 --> 02:23:07,117
and lock all the toilets
in those offices.

2157
02:23:07,179 --> 02:23:07,924
Sir..

2158
02:23:07,949 --> 02:23:10,184
No one will go to the
toilet for seven days.

2159
02:23:10,482 --> 02:23:12,860
Those who want to go will have
to find a solution himself.

2160
02:23:13,185 --> 02:23:14,163
But, sir..

2161
02:23:14,252 --> 02:23:18,701
Only the wounded knows the
pain, and no one else.

2162
02:23:18,857 --> 02:23:20,461
But, sir, how is that possible?

2163
02:23:20,826 --> 02:23:25,036
If our Prime Minister can ban notes
for the country's benefit...

2164
02:23:25,097 --> 02:23:28,943
then we can close toilets too.

2165
02:23:29,434 --> 02:23:30,435
Yes, sir.

2166
02:23:57,529 --> 02:24:00,339
Jaya Joshi left her husband's
home on 15th February.

2167
02:24:00,432 --> 02:24:03,106
And today they are meeting
directly in the court.

2168
02:24:03,568 --> 02:24:07,778
And the reason for their separation
is the 3000 Cr toilet scam.

2169
02:24:07,839 --> 02:24:10,080
We've never had a divorce
in the last 1700 years.

2170
02:24:10,175 --> 02:24:12,212
If Lord Krishna
returns to Radha...

2171
02:24:12,244 --> 02:24:13,951
will Rukmini divorce Him?

2172
02:24:14,112 --> 02:24:15,819
Quarrels should he
solved at home.

2173
02:24:15,847 --> 02:24:17,952
- And not made a public spectacle.
- You're right.

2174
02:24:18,016 --> 02:24:21,589
No one's ever said that
we should use a toilet...

2175
02:24:21,786 --> 02:24:23,288
then what is this
feud all about?

2176
02:24:23,355 --> 02:24:25,665
I wish Keshav had understood
the chapter on Manusmriti...

2177
02:24:25,791 --> 02:24:27,793
then he wouldn't he
facing this problem.

2178
02:24:27,859 --> 02:24:30,931
Seems like people are
against building toilets.

2179
02:24:31,029 --> 02:24:33,509
They believe it's
against their culture.

2180
02:24:33,599 --> 02:24:34,703
You tell me...

2181
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:37,312
What about the Prime Minister's
'Cleanliness Drive'?

2182
02:24:37,402 --> 02:24:40,508
If we build a toilet at home then
how can we keep our homes clean?

2183
02:24:40,705 --> 02:24:43,242
So that's their opinion about
the 'Cleanliness Drive'.

2184
02:24:43,308 --> 02:24:45,948
A village where toilets
are deemed unhygienic...

2185
02:24:45,978 --> 02:24:47,889
are hound to have such divorces.

2186
02:24:54,419 --> 02:24:55,454
Hello.

2187
02:25:17,842 --> 02:25:19,515
Madam, sign on this urgently.

2188
02:25:23,281 --> 02:25:24,851
- Madam... madam...
- Hold on.

2189
02:25:24,882 --> 02:25:26,928
- Jaya...
- What is it?

2190
02:25:26,952 --> 02:25:29,455
Will it he easy for your daughter to
live in the village after this divorce?

2191
02:25:29,621 --> 02:25:30,326
Why?

2192
02:25:30,422 --> 02:25:32,333
Is she causing
floods or doomsday?

2193
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:33,123
No, I...

2194
02:25:33,135 --> 02:25:35,371
Did anyone in your family
ever have a divorce before?

2195
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:37,303
Forget my family, let's
talk about the country.

2196
02:25:37,362 --> 02:25:39,308
Did anyone ever have a
divorce for a toilet?

2197
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:40,875
My daughter will set an
example. Come along.

2198
02:25:40,899 --> 02:25:43,175
Do you think divorce is the
solution to this problem?

2199
02:25:43,268 --> 02:25:44,906
It is the solution
to my problems.

2200
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:47,181
- One more question...
- That's enough... Come on, move aside.

2201
02:25:47,205 --> 02:25:49,879
Sir-sir... you tried your level
best to save your marriage.

2202
02:25:49,941 --> 02:25:51,386
But, if this is only
about a toilet then..

2203
02:25:51,409 --> 02:25:52,945
why didn't you go
live with your wife?

2204
02:25:53,244 --> 02:25:54,621
Yes, that's a nice idea.

2205
02:25:54,879 --> 02:25:56,722
But I don't know how to
run from my problems.

2206
02:25:56,782 --> 02:25:58,284
Sir, it's not that sunny...

2207
02:25:58,316 --> 02:25:59,818
yet you're wearing sunglasses.

2208
02:25:59,951 --> 02:26:01,487
Are you trying to
hide your tears?

2209
02:26:01,586 --> 02:26:04,931
Look, madam, everyone's
blinded by fake pride.

2210
02:26:05,156 --> 02:26:06,658
And anyway, these
are fake Rayhans.

2211
02:26:06,958 --> 02:26:08,437
But the world has a
real one on their eyes.

2212
02:26:08,526 --> 02:26:10,563
Are you going to challenge
the government after this?

2213
02:26:11,095 --> 02:26:14,633
It's your job to blame the
government for everything.

2214
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:17,137
You should take some
responsibilities yourself.

2215
02:26:17,235 --> 02:26:19,442
Keshav, are you sad that
your wife's leaving you?

2216
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:20,947
No, I love it.

2217
02:26:21,206 --> 02:26:22,810
Now I'll get a new
wife for myself.

2218
02:26:22,908 --> 02:26:23,909
- Come on, that's enough.
- Sir, just one more question.

2219
02:26:23,942 --> 02:26:25,751
- Sir.. Sir.. Please sir.
- That's enough.

2220
02:26:28,246 --> 02:26:29,486
I feel that everything
will he fine.

2221
02:26:29,581 --> 02:26:31,424
They don't know how to talk.

2222
02:26:31,483 --> 02:26:32,006
I mean...

2223
02:26:32,018 --> 02:26:33,622
These people are getting
divorced as well.

2224
02:26:33,651 --> 02:26:35,221
I don't know.

2225
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:37,395
- Radhe-Radhe.
- Greetings. Greetings.

2226
02:26:45,797 --> 02:26:49,142
We didn't have so many
guests even at our wedding.

2227
02:26:50,535 --> 02:26:52,845
I haven't seen our
wedding video yet.

2228
02:26:53,538 --> 02:26:56,144
But our divorce is being broadcast
live on national television.

2229
02:26:59,544 --> 02:27:01,285
Fix your hair, sweetheart.

2230
02:27:04,816 --> 02:27:07,194
Quit smiling silly,
I'll fall in love.

2231
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:20,632
Time now for a small break.

2232
02:27:20,698 --> 02:27:23,770
On the other side of the break we'll
show you Jaya and Keshav's signatures.

2233
02:27:23,802 --> 02:27:26,476
Stay with us on Abhi
Tak Channel, live.

2234
02:27:26,738 --> 02:27:29,912
After this divorce, the people are
going to divorce this government.

2235
02:27:29,941 --> 02:27:32,285
Because this is their
biggest failure.

2236
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:35,448
Judging by the size of this issue, this
was a controversy waiting to happen.

2237
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:38,083
If what Keshav and
Jaya are doing...

2238
02:27:38,149 --> 02:27:41,096
ushers in a change then
it's always welcome.

2239
02:27:41,219 --> 02:27:43,859
You see, I was the first one to
report this news in my newspaper.

2240
02:27:44,022 --> 02:27:46,161
But I never thought it
would escalate to divorce.

2241
02:27:46,324 --> 02:27:48,463
It's all due to the narrow-mindedness
of these ignorant.

2242
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:50,833
But brother Keshav
tried his best.

2243
02:28:16,087 --> 02:28:18,328
Jaya and Keshav.

2244
02:28:21,526 --> 02:28:23,972
Do you two still stand
firm on your decision?

2245
02:28:28,099 --> 02:28:29,237
Yes...

2246
02:28:29,301 --> 02:28:32,077
No toilet, no marriage.

2247
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:48,124
Sir, this letter has arrived
from the CM's office.

2248
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:04,480
The court rejects Jaya and
Keshav's plea for divorce.

2249
02:29:11,342 --> 02:29:14,289
The government has accepted
Keshav's request...

2250
02:29:14,345 --> 02:29:17,155
for building a toilet
in his village.

2251
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:30,903
The construction begins tomorrow morning
on the ground outside the village.

2252
02:29:31,095 --> 02:29:36,272
Until then... the villagers will
he facilitated with porta-loo.

2253
02:29:40,605 --> 02:29:42,312
- Why are you sulking?
- Nothing.

2254
02:29:42,374 --> 02:29:44,285
Congratulations, brother.

2255
02:29:44,509 --> 02:29:47,319
The file which went nowhere in 12
months got sanctioned in 12 minutes.

2256
02:29:47,345 --> 02:29:49,347
And do you know what the
Chief Minister did?

2257
02:29:49,447 --> 02:29:52,223
He locked all the toilets
in every government office.

2258
02:29:52,283 --> 02:29:54,422
That's when these officers
learned their lesson.

2259
02:29:54,619 --> 02:29:56,826
Remember what you said
at Mr. Mathur's office.

2260
02:29:57,055 --> 02:29:58,466
''Until the problem
doesn't get personal...''

2261
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:00,367
''no lane's willing to
fight, find a solution.''

2262
02:30:00,491 --> 02:30:02,095
You were absolutely
right, brother.

2263
02:30:03,794 --> 02:30:05,296
What's wrong now, Keshav.

2264
02:30:05,363 --> 02:30:07,673
We found a solution and
did the impossible.

2265
02:30:07,866 --> 02:30:09,470
We got the toilet.

2266
02:30:10,401 --> 02:30:14,315
Jaya, I promised to give
you your personal toilet.

2267
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:15,879
I couldn't do it.

2268
02:30:16,107 --> 02:30:18,144
Maybe not personal, but at
least there's a toilet.

2269
02:30:18,309 --> 02:30:21,381
- I am happy.
- I couldn't change father's view either.

2270
02:30:22,447 --> 02:30:24,654
I can't take you
hack in that house.

2271
02:30:25,083 --> 02:30:26,426
Keshav!

2272
02:30:27,385 --> 02:30:29,592
You'll always be a numbskull.

2273
02:30:30,121 --> 02:30:31,623
You fought against
the entire world...

2274
02:30:31,856 --> 02:30:35,099
and now you say you
won't take her home.

2275
02:30:37,962 --> 02:30:40,704
Daughter-in-law, let this he.

2276
02:30:40,998 --> 02:30:44,810
The fake charades, fake
thumb, fake pride.

2277
02:30:44,936 --> 02:30:48,611
Leave all this behind and
then step inside the house.

2278
02:30:48,974 --> 02:30:50,612
- Is he sick?
- I think so.

2279
02:30:50,742 --> 02:30:52,085
I am not sick, son.

2280
02:30:52,277 --> 02:30:54,120
In fact, I am better now.

2281
02:30:55,013 --> 02:30:56,219
You see...

2282
02:30:57,248 --> 02:30:59,990
It's time to take the
blind off our eyes...

2283
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:02,527
and put it on the toilet.

2284
02:31:03,488 --> 02:31:06,059
That's wonderful, father.

2285
02:31:06,391 --> 02:31:09,338
- That's wonderful.
- Sorry, daughter-in-law. Sorry.

2286
02:31:09,594 --> 02:31:12,632
For the first time, I've
done something good.

2287
02:31:12,797 --> 02:31:16,472
So only daughter-in-law
will inaugurate my toilet.

2288
02:31:16,534 --> 02:31:17,877
- My toilet, father?
- Yes.

2289
02:31:18,069 --> 02:31:19,810
But brother sold his
hike to pay for this..

2290
02:31:19,871 --> 02:31:22,044
- ''You didn't spend a penny.
- Get lost... shut up.

2291
02:31:22,073 --> 02:31:23,984
- Just a thought, father.
- Let it he.

2292
02:31:24,208 --> 02:31:25,516
- This isn't right.
- Quiet.

2293
02:31:25,577 --> 02:31:28,057
No.. No.. Come on.

2294
02:31:32,817 --> 02:31:34,125
- What happened?
- Sister-in-law, look here.

2295
02:31:34,185 --> 02:31:36,631
Brother Keshav... Group
photo. Yes. Yes.

2296
02:31:36,855 --> 02:31:37,833
Ready.

2297
02:32:15,026 --> 02:32:17,097
Written in scriptures.

2298
02:32:17,528 --> 02:32:23,103
Humans should not perform daily
action in front of the sun or moon.

2299
02:32:23,268 --> 02:32:26,408
Then the use of the toilet
should he made mandatory.

2300
02:32:26,771 --> 02:32:28,546
I had already told Keshav.

2301
02:32:28,606 --> 02:32:31,553
This sacrifice has to he done in the
interest of cleanliness of the people.

2302
02:32:31,575 --> 02:32:35,785
Children get used to going to
the toilet since childhood.

2303
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:37,789
If you defecation in the
open, you will heat.

2304
02:32:37,882 --> 02:32:41,227
Getting big pleasure.
My life has changed.

2305
02:32:41,252 --> 02:32:43,163
Father did not approve of this.

2306
02:32:43,187 --> 02:32:45,565
But said no. Toilets
will he definitely made.

2307
02:32:45,623 --> 02:32:46,727
Why do sister-in-law
go out to toilet.

2308
02:32:46,758 --> 02:32:49,295
Or why should any woman
go out? This is wrong.

2309
02:32:49,327 --> 02:32:51,170
Congratulations to
Keshav and Jaya.

2310
02:32:51,262 --> 02:32:53,936
Now the women of the house do not
have to go away in the open.

2311
02:32:53,998 --> 02:32:57,810
Keshav is right. 'If you want your
wife, you got to have a toilet.'

2312
02:32:57,835 --> 02:33:01,544
The money that the government
gave us to make toilets...

2313
02:33:01,572 --> 02:33:02,949
we returned them.

2314
02:33:03,108 --> 02:33:06,681
Do we take money from the
government to buy TVs and freeze?

2315
02:33:06,711 --> 02:33:08,349
Then why take money
to make toilet.

2316
02:33:08,412 --> 02:33:10,892
The toilets will he
made by our own money.

2317
02:33:11,082 --> 02:33:12,186
Remember...

2318
02:33:12,216 --> 02:33:15,629
'If you want your wife, you
got to have a toilet.'
