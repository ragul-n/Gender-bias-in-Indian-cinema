1
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,870
My name is Ashvini.

2
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,602
The one, walking ahead of
me, sometime back, was..

3
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,340
..Shumonto, my son.

4
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,617
For so many clays, now, I've
been following him around..

5
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,521
..he is not aware of it.

6
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,285
I've a lot to tell him
and Shumonto too..

7
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,423
..has much to say to me.

8
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,767
He has a wife, Supriya.

9
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,889
Sister!
- What?

10
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,924
Will you play that game?
- Which one?

11
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,325
'Finding the finger.’ Here,
try to find this one.

12
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,454
This one, not that one.

13
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,655
Hold the finger..

14
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,532
'President Bush has said..'

15
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,658
That's fine.

16
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,329
'America is not just a country
made up of many lovely..

17
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,895
..cities like other countries.'

18
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,269
'America is a thought, an idea,
an imagination and a..

19
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,678
..prospect which lives in the
hearts of many, many people.’

20
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:13,284
'He believes anyone can be a part
of this idea, imagination..

21
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,719
..and prospect.’

22
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,281
'You can be an American at heart
even if you don't live..

23
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,417
..in America.'

24
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,292
'America is more than just
a country, America is more..

25
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,025
..than just a place,
it's a prayer.’

26
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,747
Hello!

27
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,520
Hello, Shumonto, did I wake you up?

28
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,385
Not at all! Go on.

29
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,328
lt's Kolkata-New York
direct and back.

30
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,998
Let her spend her entire
school holidays here.

31
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,528
Give it to Supriya.

32
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:13,776
Supriya! Supriya, there's a call
from America. It's your brother.

33
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,411
Brother! - Yes.

34
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,284
Listen, I'm sending papers
for the visa along..

35
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,551
..with your ticket.

36
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,625
Your flight is on the
Monday after this one.

37
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,896
Not to worry. Basabi and I will
receive you at the airport.

38
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,822
Really, you really mean it?

39
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,358
Yes, really.

40
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,365
lfeel like dancing.

41
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,505
I believe it's snowing very
heavily over there now.

42
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,642
No, not yet.
It will, after two months.

43
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,309
How are your kids?

44
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,539
Fine. Brother!
- What is it?

45
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,614
Brother, shall I enroll in the
'Spoken English' programme?

46
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,545
Don't laugh! Tell me!

47
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,583
See you soon! Bye!

48
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,988
Can you speak in English?

49
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,656
A little.

50
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,825
Can you continue a conversation?
- Just about.

51
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,273
Where is the spoon now? Brother
leaves things all over..

52
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,402
..the place.

53
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,579
What did he say? Your brother!

54
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,618
Didn't you hear? I'm going to
brother, to America. New York.

55
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,747
When are you leaving?

56
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,916
The Monday after this one.

57
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,418
Where will they stay?

58
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,453
Who will stay where?

59
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,026
Who else? Shanta and Shantanu.

60
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,429
Here. Radha will cook as usual.

61
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,635
I'll pay her a little extra.
She will take care of them too.

62
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,711
Daddy!

63
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,845
Daddy!

64
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,791
Why are you sitting here?

65
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,917
l'll sit here.

66
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,255
You've to move that side.

67
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,590
No! l'll sleep on this side!

68
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,858
You move that side, l'll
sleep on this side. - No!

69
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,900
Move that side!
- Here you are.

70
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,778
Dad, are you sleepy?

71
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,943
Soon, I'll be.

72
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,479
Shall I draw a picture on your back?

73
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,653
Are you sleepy?

74
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,759
Sing a song
and you'll fall asleep.

75
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,368
I've a bit of your nose.
I've a bit of your ears.

76
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,996
I've a piece of your heart too.

77
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:35,471
You're my life, you're everything.

78
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,832
I too had a wife, Putul.

79
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,906
We had a house in Majhipur.
It's still there.

80
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,409
Putul lives there.

81
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,557
How are you?
- Fine.

82
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,025
And you? Why didn't you
visit for so many days?

83
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,996
Not so many days. l was
here a few days back.

84
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,572
You don't remember
a thing these days.

85
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,837
Are you taking your
medicines on time?

86
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:22,010
I met Shumonto again that day.

87
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,491
Shumonto hasn't visited for
a long time. How is he?

88
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:35,862
Can you tell just by looking? Could
you tell by looking at me?

89
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,473
I could. The times you were hungry..

90
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:47,410
..or sad, I could tell all of it.

91
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,413
Oh, how about Abha? How
is she? Do you meet her?

92
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:05,592
I told you the other day.
I don't know where Abha is.

93
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,967
Don't you feel like seeing Abha?

94
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,601
I do.
- Why?

95
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:25,876
If I meet her, I'd tell her why
I had to leave her that day.

96
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,463
Putul! Putul, what happened?

97
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,940
Hey, what's your hurry!

98
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,465
What will you eat in the afternoon?
- A kiss!

99
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,632
Kiss, kiss, kiss!
- Hey, quiet!

100
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,602
And?
- And..

101
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,977
Some fish preparation with
piping hot rice! - Okay.

102
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,482
Last night, I saw a strange
dream and felt like crying.

103
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,451
I dreamt that you left me and
went somewhere far away.

104
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,496
I've seen that dream
many times before.

105
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,993
Why do 
 feel so scared?

106
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:58,605
How is that place? Is it a
place that brings peace?

107
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,670
Meaning?

108
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:08,717
I had told you as a child I had
seen a photograph in the paper.

109
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,452
It was a dazzlingly beautiful
place, no place we know about.

110
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,732
It was totally out of this world.

111
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,631
Many times, 
 feel like running
away to that place.

112
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,938
I've even set out for it a few times.

113
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,971
You still don't like to
stay at home, isn't it?

114
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,311
It's not that. 
 feel there
must be some place..

115
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,877
..like the one in the picture.

116
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:50,385
A place where no one knows
me and I know no one.

117
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,732
I'll go there and live
forever and ever.

118
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,572
But, wherever I go, I
can't live without you.

119
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:10,772
l'll die and come back as a ghost.
Don't get scared then!

120
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,442
Shumonto!

121
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,939
Keep trying! You might
succeed some day.

122
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,743
Want to go somewhere?
- Where?

123
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,614
Kusumpur.
- Where's that?

124
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,880
Not very far. See, Padma?
Beyond it lies Kusumpur.

125
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,479
No! I've my studies!

126
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,057
As if one day of studies
will take you places!

127
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,422
Come, let's race.

128
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,321
l'll drive slowly, you follow me.

129
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,436
Get the oxygen cylinder from outside.
One of you, go with him.

130
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:25,287
If you don't get the medicines
in the pharmacy, take it from..

131
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,518
..my chambers.

132
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,720
Okay?

133
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,631
Will that bring it under
control, doctor?

134
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,594
lt's asthma. Let's try out
the medicines and see.

135
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,636
Come tonight to see the 'jatra'
(folk play), sonny.

136
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,932
Doctor, you come too.

137
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,974
These things never lose their charm.
- I'll see.

138
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,992
Go straight home!
- Okay!

139
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,766
Excuse me!

140
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,940
Can you recognise me?

141
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,811
Abha!

142
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,359
Movies, theatre? What
happened to all that?

143
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:42,000
It's all there. But I don't
get much work these days.

144
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,403
So, in winter I perform
in these folk plays.

145
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,430
They pay well.

146
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,603
How are you doing?

147
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,040
Fine. How about yourself?

148
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,580
Better.

149
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:12,355
Surprising! I thought I
won't ever see you again.

150
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,868
The world is full of surprises.

151
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,640
Do you remember? You used to tell
me about your house here.

152
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,611
A very old and large house,
isn't it?

153
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,956
Why did you suddenly leave Kolkata
without telling me?

154
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,285
What were you thinking? That
I would chase you to your..

155
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,388
..home?

156
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,302
Can you name some books in Bengali..

157
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,635
..that are based on America?

158
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,434
What will you do with books?
You're coming on a holiday.

159
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,636
I know nothing about the country.

160
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,969
I should know something.

161
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:04,545
There are many, many books.
Travelogues. - Meaning?

162
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,517
They talk of travels. Written
while on the road.

163
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,646
They sell by the dozens
on College Street.

164
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,389
You too can write one on return.

165
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,487
These books are pretty popular.

166
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,263
That's an idea! I had written
a couple of times..

167
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,458
..for the college magazine.

168
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,667
That was a long time back! Will
I be able to do it now?

169
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:28,264
Of course you can! lnk, pen and
your mind, the three will..

170
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,333
..do the trick! Think
about it. That's it.

171
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,342
Will you go to College Street today?

172
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,275
Will you get me all the books
on America that you can lay..

173
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,009
..your hands on?

174
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,411
I've a lot to do today. Ask
Shumonto. He'll get it.

175
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,391
Please go to College Street today.

176
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,731
Get whatever Bengali books
on America that you get.

177
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,464
Here's rupees 500. I've some
work to do after school.

178
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,446
Careful!

179
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,691
Hey! Excuse me!

180
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,370
What is your name?
- Nakul.

181
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,971
Are you new to this trade?
You aren't an expert yet?

182
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,605
What if you were caught?

183
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,442
My factory has shut down, sir.

184
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,781
In that case, better learn
this trade properly.

185
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,378
Or some day you'll be behind bars!
- Okay, sir.

186
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,689
Where do you live?
- Dutta Park.

187
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,054
How many family members?
- My wife.

188
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,397
What is her name?
- Roma.

189
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,629
She loves you a lot, isn't it?

190
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,901
Hey, hey, look, look!

191
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,462
Sit down.

192
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:54,506
Today, I'll ask you questions
about America. - America?

193
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,473
Won't you give us math today, ma'am?
- No.

194
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,848
Today, we'll do America.

195
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,819
Sunanda, tell me what is
the capital of America?

196
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,947
Capital?

197
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,022
Seema, where is the Hudson river?
- Hudson river?

198
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,527
Radha, where is the
Statue of Liberty?

199
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,901
Statue of Liberty?

200
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,966
Where is Manhattan? Chhaya, tell me.

201
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,378
Don't stand there quietly. Tell me!

202
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,472
Manhattan..

203
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,383
Okay, I'll ask you
a simpler question.

204
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,421
Which country produced
Coca-cola first?

205
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,061
Which city in the world has
the most McDonald's outlets?

206
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,559
What is McDonald's, do you know?

207
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,597
Who can point out America
on this globe? Who?

208
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,740
Aren't you ashamed of
yourselves? Shame!

209
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,715
I can't imagine you know so
little about the world.

210
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:11,347
I'll tell you about America.
Listen carefully, don't forget.

211
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:52,491
Mr. Shumonto, Mr. Roy is calling you!
- Coming.

212
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,630
Good news, go in!

213
00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,993
What do you mean good news?

214
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,599
Meaning, promotion!

215
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,609
The list will be out
in a couple of days.

216
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,004
Please see if any of us are on it.

217
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,480
I think we too will
be promoted, right?

218
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:26,822
Yes!

219
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,667
May I come in, sir?
- Come in.

220
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,710
This report that you've made
about Dibrugarh branch.

221
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,642
We'll need to give a charge
sheet to the manager.

222
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,782
He'll lose his job. Do you want that?

223
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,383
He is very corrupt, sir. The police
report too is against him.

224
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,584
I haven't written it alone.

225
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,052
Bijon, Alokesh and Vivek
too were there.

226
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,455
Who is not corrupt? In this
country, everyone is corrupt.

227
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,723
No one has any morality.

228
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,332
What is the use of penalizing
only Mahapatra?

229
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,906
And the police? Lesser
said the better.

230
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,448
Sir, when will the promotion
list be out?

231
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,343
I don't know.

232
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,614
Am I on it, sir?

233
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,749
How do I know?

234
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:35,966
Listen, settle your differences
with Mahapatra.

235
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,028
I've no differences
with Mahapatra, sir.

236
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,302
You had sent the four of us.

237
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,601
That was due to pressure
from the top.

238
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:47,644
Your friends are ready.
What about you?

239
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,441
I'm going, sir.

240
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,817
You, you were always a failure.

241
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,270
Does Mr. Roy have something
going on with..

242
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,367
..Mrs. Mahapatra?
- Why?

243
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:24,278
I saw Mr. Roy and Mrs. Mahapatra
walking hand in..

244
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,977
..hand at Curzon Street.

245
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,478
Oh. That must be someone else.

246
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,017
Mahapatra's wife died
many years back.

247
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,495
What? No, no! I saw it clearly.

248
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,759
Hallucination! Your eyes were
playing a trick on you.

249
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,494
An optical illusion!

250
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:56,640
Excuse me.
- Yes?

251
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,252
Could you please show me all
the Bengali books you have..

252
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,844
..on America?
- Sure.

253
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:08,321
Hey, 'Mohini's Market,' 'In
Hollywood on Holi day.'

254
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,451
Is it in here?

255
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,429
'A cauldron from Dallas,'
'Amravati America.'

256
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,696
'Bengali bride, America's honey!'

257
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,995
And 'Jamming in America.'

258
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,333
Bring down whatever is available.

259
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,797
Would you like an English one?

260
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,638
Bill Clinton's 'My Life.'

261
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,970
The Monica history chapter is
there too! Lewinsky! Want it?

262
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,340
No, only the Bengali ones.

263
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,413
Here, this is a new one.

264
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,015
So many books? Who buys
all these books?

265
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,293
Those who say, where shall I go?
Where shall I go and..

266
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,556
..don't go anywhere.

267
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,592
You've been selling books
for a long time, isn't it?

268
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,434
Yes. Ever since this grew!

269
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,798
Which ones do you want?

270
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,297
Sometimes I feel like lying
down beside Shumonto like..

271
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,359
..old times.

272
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:03,669
When he was a little boy, he had
a pleasant smell around him.

273
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,842

 used to smell that.

274
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:14,682
Strangely, one day the very same
Shumonto wanted to kill me.

275
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,530
Would you like to buy a flute?

276
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,665
Don't know how to play.

277
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,799
l'll teach you.

278
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:11,934
I don't have money.

279
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,376
Do you like listening to the flute?
- Yes.

280
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,504
Then, take this.

281
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,411
You can give me the money
the next time we meet.

282
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,541
What if we don't meet?
- Then don't pay.

283
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,945
No. What is your name?
- ldris.

284
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,380
Who is he?

285
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,582
My son, Abdul.

286
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,464
Hey, who are you?

287
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:32,313
'President Bush asserted that
America is made of man's..

288
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:37,454
..favourite dreams. It is his
duty to uphold those dreams.'

289
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,758
'He doesn't want anyone on
earth to die of hunger.'

290
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,065
'So he is sending 1,000 tons
of potatoes for Udalgudu.'

291
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,338
'He has told the Indian Prime
Minister that India should..

292
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,902
..produce more potatoes instead
of nuclear weapons.'

293
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:57,471
I'm a mature member of my party.

294
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,983
But, more than that, I'm an American.

295
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,682
I love my country, I love
what America stands for.

296
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,655
l knowjust how mad people are
to be like the Americans.

297
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,859
Reading the new stuff that arrives.

298
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,961
An inherent in that statement
is this profound knowledge.

299
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,292
Is that, if you can't read you
can't access the profound..

300
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,832
..American dream.

301
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,029
Our great country is known for
people who never gave up.

302
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,311
Gujarat's chief minister said
that he is trying to arrest..

303
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,815
'Eat dear, eat dear, this
stomach is empty.'

304
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:37,549
'A rossogolla (sweetmeat),
a rossogolla..

305
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,854
..eat
up dear, eat up son, eat.'

306
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:42,985
Some terrorists have..

307
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:48,522
'A rossogolla, a rossogolla.'

308
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:52,797
'Eat up dear, eat up son, eat.'

309
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,435
Hey Shanta, Shantanu! Take a look!

310
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,809
Father had a car exactly
like that one.

311
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,851
He used to drive it himself
to see patients.

312
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,382
I saw a car like this
after so many days!

313
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,754
Did you drive?

314
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,721
Hey, will you guys eat now?
I've to finish these books.

315
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,832
Just 7 days to go.
So much to do yet!

316
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:29,465
Daddy, tell us about your father.
You never talk about him.

317
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,599
Will you tell us today?

318
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,001
Come.

319
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,611
How is everyone at Kolkata?

320
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,875
Kolkata is where it is.

321
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:19,787
I hardly ever meet mum,
brother and Shobha.

322
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,516
I'm on my own really.

323
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,759
What about your wife?
Is she beautiful?

324
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:34,498
I haven't returned to Kolkata
after coming here. Come.

325
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,580
Putul. Abha.

326
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,774
Sit.

327
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,548
I've heard about you.

328
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,424
Have you heard everything?

329
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,652
Meaning?

330
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,561
That we were friends.

331
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,805
Your friend or your
brother's friend?

332
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,499
My friend.

333
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:16,470
Putul, I met her here
a few days back.

334
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,281
The troupe that performs Ramayana
here, she plays..

335
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,344
..the role of Sita in that.

336
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,386
Please come one day to see it.
- I will.

337
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:42,304
A dark, deep sea! No one on
this earth will be spared..

338
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,968
..by Ravana! - Come.

339
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,038
Come, come, Jatayu, let us fly out.
- Come.

340
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,849
We'll take Janaki out
to the Ashok forest.

341
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:59,322
You monster! Your golden Lanka
will turn to ashes with..

342
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,260
There will be light
in Lanka from now on!

343
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:08,755
0 Ram, where are you? Why
don't you return to me?

344
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,666
May I say something?
- Yes.

345
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,740
Why didn't you marry Abha?

346
00:36:55,513 --> 00:37:01,383
I didn't want to marry Abha,
I wanted to marry you.

347
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,788
Sister, what are you drawing?
A hill? - No.

348
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,794
A river?
- No.

349
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,761
Tell me.

350
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,431
A beautiful place.

351
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,809
Very beautiful?
- Yes.

352
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,501
Can one go to this place?
- Silly!

353
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,815
I waited for so long,
why didn't you come?

354
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,950
What do I do? I got stuck so badly,
I just couldn't reach.

355
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,320
I'll need some money,
about rupees 7,000.

356
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,022
I need to do some shopping.

357
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,358
Take it from me tomorrow.

358
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:54,397
How are the kids? Bring them along
some day, I want to see them.

359
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,397
What's the point asking about
Shanta and Shantanu?

360
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,034
You hardly care for them.

361
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,771
They won't recognise
you at this rate.

362
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,880
How long can we continue
like this, tell me!

363
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,243
I don't like this. What is the
point in hanging around here..

364
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,686
..where I've no attachments
whatsoever!

365
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,248
Don't worry, everything
will be fine.

366
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,989
What do 
 get for you?
American jeans?

367
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,991
lndian jeans are just
not good enough.

368
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,893
Get what you feel like. Come
early tomorrow. - Okay.

369
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,837
Daddy!

370
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,005
Daddy!

371
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:32,052
See if you can arrange
for a camera. - I will.

372
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:37,330
Daddy, which one is you?
This one, right?

373
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,068
These books have such beautiful
pictures of America.

374
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:48,938
You can see the photos,
at least, once I return.

375
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,882
You could've taken some vicarious
pleasure out of it.

376
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,075
When are you leaving?

377
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:58,353
Day after tomorrow.
America it will be.

378
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,484
Mum, is Tin Tin available there?

379
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:06,494
Tin Tin is available here too.
I'll get you a toy gun, okay?

380
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,757
Come on, daddy, we'll
be late for school.

381
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,299
Yes, daddy..

382
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:13,303
In Europe and America, they use
paper instead of water..

383
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,033
..in the toilets! Better
practice a bit.

384
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,574
That's all you know about
Europe and America!

385
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,306
You haven't travelled in anything
besides bus, train..

386
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:27,783
..and rickshaw! Have you ever?

387
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:33,322
Of course, I went to Dibrugarh
by plane. I went and returned.

388
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,050
Oh, that one time. That
too on office work.

389
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,621
Come on, daddy!

390
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,347
Uncle, what about my pants?
- I'll give it..

391
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,815
Come on, daddy, we're getting late.
- Come.

392
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,370
Daddy!

393
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,700
lnk, pen and the mind,
the three do the trick!

394
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,385
How are you?

395
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:54,426
Do you know me? Open
the umbrella please.

396
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,660
Yes, you're the TV newsreader,
isn't it?

397
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,571
May 
 ask you something?
- Yes.

398
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,282
Some days back you spoke of
a new island rising at..

399
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,411
..Sunderban. I remember
that island very well.

400
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:21,484
lt's stunning! Have you been there?
It's amazing, isn't it?

401
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:24,619
I haven't been there.

402
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:29,298
Oh. A few days back you
showed two fishermen..

403
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:34,532
..in a trawler fishing
at the Bay of Bengal.

404
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:39,537
Do you know the place? Such
huge waves! Amazing!

405
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:43,041
The ones who cover the news
go to those places.

406
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:47,044

 read the news.
- 
 see.

407
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,479
What a job, eh! You get to see
and know so many things.

408
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,620
Where do you live?
- Paipada.

409
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:02,265
Oh, it's just there! Go
straight and turn left.

410
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,996
Okay! Just going on and
on, what an idiot!

411
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,745
Mili, it's done?

412
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:26,881
We got promoted
today, all three of us!

413
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,956
Hey Bijon, let go of the phone,
we too need to tell the news.

414
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,857
Won't you wake Sandhya up?

415
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,398
Wait!

416
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,698
I'll take ten days off, sir.
I've a lot of leave pending.

417
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,467
You would've got a promotion.

418
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,290
He has been whining for a while.

419
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:44,392
He wants to go to
the toilet I guess.

420
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,404
Jill, come here. No more using soil.

421
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,410
Bijon, Mr. Roy and Alokesh
all have a bathroom.

422
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,471
Why shouldn't you have one?

423
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,844
From now one, this is your
bathroom, go on and use it.

424
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,257
I'm going to visit mother
with Shanta..

425
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,558
..and Shantanu tomorrow. Come
and give Jill her food.

426
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,936
Daddy! Run, we're here!

427
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,574
How are you, mum?

428
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,012
Fine, come, sit.

429
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,923
Bimla was saying you've
been here for some time.

430
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,682
You should've called me.

431
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,020
You were asleep.

432
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,294
Where are the kids? I haven't
seen them for so long!

433
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,797
Grandma!
- Grandma!

434
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,664
Here you are! Come!

435
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,338
Have you eaten?
- Yes.

436
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,032
Have you?
- Yes.

437
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,670
Mum, can you walk a little now?

438
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:06,341
Yes, I walk till the bathroom.
I don't try beyond that.

439
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,546
Where will I walk to?

440
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,445
It's not right to lie
down all the time.

441
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,685
ls Bimla giving the
medicines on time?

442
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,888
She does a lot. Yesterday,
she brought Dr. Ashim here.

443
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,797
He changed the medicines.
A whole lot of new medicines.

444
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,869
I wonder how long I'll
have to take medicines.

445
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,498
No doctor will take
the fees you know.

446
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,698
Naturally they won't take the fees.

447
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,002
No doctor charges at another
doctor's residence.

448
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:35,503
Dad too didn't take.

449
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,474
Do you meet daddy?

450
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,384
What rubbish you talk, grandma?!

451
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,286
I hear daughter-in-law
has gone for 2 months.

452
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,695
How will you stay with the kids
alone? Leave them here.

453
00:48:57,535 --> 00:49:00,698
We don't have holidays.
Who will go to school, you?

454
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,566
Stay during the holidays.

455
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,434
l've my art class.

456
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:09,969
So many problems you have!

457
00:49:10,915 --> 00:49:12,712
Never mind, stay at your Kolkata!

458
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:17,420
That Kolkata is hardly a city!
Now Dhaka was a city.

459
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,552
My father too was a doctor
like your grandpa.

460
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,770
What is your name?
- Shantanu.

461
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,641
Who are you and where are you going?

462
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,509
We're a troupe of Ramayana artists.

463
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,341
We're going to the neighbouring
village to..

464
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:56,079
..perform the Ramayana.

 play Ravana's part.

465
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:57,946
Do you know the Ramayana?

466
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:01,923
He is Hanuman.

467
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,301
He is so cute!
- Hah!

468
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,763
She is Surpanakha.

469
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:33,046
My heart says I love you.

470
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,524
The eyes say, leave it alone.

471
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,955
The moon says I'm here,
look at me.

472
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:46,332
I'm here, don't you see!

473
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,798
My heart says I love you.

474
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:05,412
Flowers bloom on every branch.

475
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,625
Birds sing among the leaves.

476
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,793
Flowers bloom on every branch.

477
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:15,024
Birds sing among the leaves.

478
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:21,301
For whom O beloved..

479
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:24,808
..do they spread their wings?

480
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,842
For whom do they
spread their wings?

481
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,039
My heart says I love you.

482
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,476
The eyes say, leave it alone.

483
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:41,318
The moon says I'm here,
look at me.

484
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:45,056
I'm here, don't you see!

485
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,794
My heart says I love you.

486
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:07,382
I can't bear the light in
this night of separation.

487
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:13,313
Pour what is in your
heart into the flute.

488
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,455
Speak through your heart.

489
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,022
May I come in?
- Come in!

490
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:34,538
We're leaving in a couple of days.
- Why?

491
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,841
The troupe has to perform elsewhere.

492
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,377
Sit.

493
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,988
Will you tell me something?
- Yes?

494
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,063
Do you still love me?

495
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:00,995
What is the point in knowing?

496
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:13,272
Do you remember you had come
to our house in Kolkata..

497
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,612
..one afternoon?

498
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,723
No one was at home. You
desired me that day.

499
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:21,882
Do you remember?

500
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,955
Why didn't you force me that day?

501
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,767
I wanted to give you everything.

502
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,301
Had you forced me that day,
my life wouldn't be in this..

503
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,633
..state today.

504
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,839
Life changes so easily, isn't it?

505
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:39,028
You haven't changed one bit.
A coward if there was one!

506
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,444
No point in my staying here
any more after this.

507
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,046
Let me finish what I'm saying.

508
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:56,878
l'll feel uneasy if you
touch me after this.

509
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,463
What you've seen is nothing.

510
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:13,566
You could've shown
me something more!

511
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,667
Or did you run out of courage?
- Putul!

512
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,797
Don't shout!

513
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,575
I've told Shumonto everything.

514
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,375
I'm leaving this house.

515
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,723
Shumonto said he'd leave with me.

516
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:09,489
Are you really leaving? Where
was the need to tell..

517
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,756
..Shumonto everything?

518
00:57:15,499 --> 00:57:16,557
He is a growing lad.

519
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:19,501
He needs to know why I'm
leaving this house.

520
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,628
Keep quiet! Why? Why
should I keep quiet?

521
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,505
Aren't you ashamed of shouting
being guilty yourself?

522
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,843
What do you think,
I didn't see anything?

523
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,071
Don't talk rubbish!
What did you see?

524
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,112
Shumonto will understand
when he grows up.

525
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,510
What will he understand?
I don't want him to know about..

526
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,519
..this hanky panky.
I don't want my son to grow..

527
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,817
..up
in this licentious atmosphere.

528
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,948
Putul!

529
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:26,668
Shantanu! Shantanu!

530
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,101
Shantanu!

531
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:29,966
Shantanu!

532
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:33,106
Shantanu!

533
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:55,895
That is our house!
There is my father!

534
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:01,869
Sister, sister! Daddy!

535
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,838
Alright, get off carefully.

536
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,557
Daddy!

537
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,731
Where were you? l was looking
for you since a long time.

538
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:37,706
l was with them. They're very nice.

539
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,002
May we leave?
- Yes.

540
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:40,902
Okay, alright.

541
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:50,844
Where were you?

542
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,185
l was with them. They're very nice.

543
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,087
You should tell before you go.

544
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,124
We kept calling out Shantanu,
Shantanu!

545
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:01,995
We were going crazy. I saw such
a nice dance by Surpanakha.

546
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,462
You should tell before you
go. How did they dance?

547
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,504
What else did you see?
I saw so many more things.

548
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,211
When did you come?

549
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,145
It's been quite a while.

550
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,819
You were asleep that's
why I didn't call out.

551
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:34,728
The new medicine helps
me sleep very well.

552
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,157
Have you eaten?

553
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:44,505
No. Don't you feel hungry? Sleepy?

554
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:51,871
Come in, dear. Shumonto and
his children have come.

555
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:59,521
Putul, when Shumonto needed
me very much you..

556
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:10,063
I went looking for him, when
I returned you weren't there.

557
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:19,469
In your stubborn pride, you didn't
realise what you did.

558
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:29,075
Now when you explain it
I can see everything clearly.

559
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:35,489
You were more concerned about
our relationship than..

560
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:39,996
..you were about me. Do you
understand now, Putul?

561
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,860
Yes, I do.

562
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,038
l was alone in this
house for a month.

563
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:54,703
Then one day..

564
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:01,742
Hello?

565
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,011
l'm Supriya here. How are
Shanta and Shantanu?

566
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:09,458
They're fine. All day they were
running around, now they're asleep.

567
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,756
.. How are you? Fine.

568
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,994
Are you travelling a lot?
No, I'm writing quite a bit.

569
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,032
Writing? What are you writing?

570
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,459
A sort of a travelogue. Am
writing about America's..

571
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,027
..various places.

572
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,797
You're doing a lot of sightseeing!

573
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:27,809
Not really. Brother
can't take leave.

574
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,772
How are you writing then?

575
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,472
Brother has brought me a whole
lot of video tapes..

576
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,642
..on different places.

577
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,079
I watch them at home
and write about them.

578
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,978
l've named the first one,
'New York's Natural.'

579
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,818
I had faxed it to a
magazine in Kolkata.

580
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,759
They liked it immensely.
They will serialize it.

581
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,797
They'll send the cheque
to the Kolkata address.

582
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,131
You didn't say anything.
Don't like it, right?

583
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:52,694
No, it's good.

584
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,798
What about your promotion?

585
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,804
Silent again. It didn't
happen, right?

586
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,044
I knew it. You're always a failure.

587
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,139
When will you return to Kolkata?

588
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:06,573
Not decided yet.

589
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:39,946
Did you see your father?
- Where?

590
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,154
Look outside the window.
Talk to him.

591
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:12,615
You've so many windows. I've just
the one. You shut that one too?

592
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:15,810
Please open the window.

593
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:40,571
After that day, I took you and
went to my parents' place.

594
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:48,006
I didn't hear from your
father for six months.

595
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:53,122
When I returned home, your
father had left the house.

596
01:04:56,092 --> 01:05:00,529
He had written to you. What
did he write in it?

597
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,762
You had read it, mum.
- Yes.

598
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,462
Father had written about Kusumpur.

599
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:11,902
He had written that he too
had to go some place.

600
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:16,141
He said he wondered if he
could reach there or not.

601
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,708
You didn't bother to find
out about him either.

602
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,076
What could I find out?

603
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,457
Does Kusumpur ever have an address?

604
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:07,814
Wait.

605
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,488
Was he caught?

606
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,824
Come on, daddy!

607
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,500
We're getting late. No.

608
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,240
Why?

609
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:38,645
No.

610
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:46,753
What happened? Oh.

611
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,625
Are you leaving because of me?

612
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:57,535
Actually, it's very
nice to see you two.

613
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,701
Please sit, I'll go elsewhere.

614
01:08:00,777 --> 01:08:01,835
Come.

615
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:04,204
Jill.

616
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:23,498
I've seen you before. Yes, one
day, l was taking my kids..

617
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:28,697
..to school. A man with a knife..

618
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,969
Have you killed someone?
What had happened?

619
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,835
Excuse me!

620
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,574
Excuse me!

621
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,786
Brother, what is the matter?
Are you listening?

622
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,861
Listen to me. Are you listening?

623
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,224
Hey, Shumonto, how are you?
- Fine.

624
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,563
My chair?

625
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,129
Your chair is over
there from now on.

626
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,502
In the general section.
- Meaning?

627
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:44,144
Meaning, this is now the
promoted officers' room.

628
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:45,981
Please sit in the general section.

629
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:14,801
You? Are you new here?

630
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:17,834
Why do you want to know?

631
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,800
As long as your work is done.

632
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:35,818
How long will you stay? lt's rupees
500 for the entire night.

633
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:40,761
I'll pay. Can you dance?

634
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:43,655
Everyone here can dance.

635
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,926
The dance will cost you another 100.

636
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:49,663
I'll pay.

637
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,088
Come closer, lover, come closer.

638
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,720
Come closer, lover, come closer.

639
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:17,557
My eyes are kohl-lined, look
at me once, please come.

640
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:24,131
I won't break your heart, I'm
yours, please come, beloved.

641
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:30,468
Don't torture me, O beloved.

642
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:35,046
Come closer, lover, come closer.

643
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:41,781
My eyes are kohl-lined, look
at me once, please come.

644
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:48,586
I won't break your heart, I'm
yours, please come, beloved.

645
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,597
I can't dance anymore.

646
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,649
Do you've a wife at home?

647
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:12,513
Yes. But not in my bedroom.

648
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:15,782
That is why you're here.

649
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:20,725
Do what you're here for.

650
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,634
I felt like it after many days.

651
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,733
Now I don't feel like it anymore.

652
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,741
You'll have to pay the entire sum.

653
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:42,942
I'll pay.

654
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:57,498
You won't pull me once I'm dressed,
will you? - No.

655
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,045
You're strange, you know.

656
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,778
Do you've a terrace here?

657
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,116
Why do you need a terrace now?

658
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,720
I want to sleep. I'm very
sleepy. On the terrace.

659
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,898
This is a pay-house. You
need to pay up each hour.

660
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:32,891
Where will you find a terrace here?

661
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:37,001
We had a terrace at
our Hasnabad house.

662
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:41,475
We didn't have a fan. So when
it was hot, we'd all go to..

663
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:44,479
..the terrace and sleep.

664
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,475
One day we were sleeping and..

665
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:50,985
..it began raining so heavily!

666
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:09,902
You can't do a thing. Please
don't come here again.

667
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,769
You don't suit here.

668
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:17,103
'Where's sister?'

669
01:16:31,454 --> 01:16:34,116
Hey, brother! Get up, this
won't go any further.

670
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,453
If you must sleep go get a sheet
and pillow from home. Go!

671
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,070
There's mother.

672
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,566
Mum, mum!

673
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:02,508
Get a big vehicle, all
this needs to go.

674
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,217
Is this all yours?

675
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,022
Amazing things! Everything
from there.

676
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:10,648
Made in U.S.A. You'll see it later.

677
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:13,487
Didn't you get chocolate?
- I did.

678
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,094
You haven't eaten this
chocolate before.

679
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:18,158
I've brought you a
toy gun and shoes.

680
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,967
An overcoat for Shanta.
You'll look great.

681
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,073
I brought you a tie, hat and blazer.

682
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,599
I got a great deal in a sale the
day before I was to leave.

683
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:32,506
lt'll fit you. Now, instead
of standing there..

684
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,709
..get a van or something.
I can't take it any more.

685
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:39,518
Okay.
- Keep the change.

686
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,646
Okay.

687
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:54,594
I'm dying! I'm dying!

688
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,981
I've brought everything.
I can't keep it here for long.

689
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:48,579
How are you keeping? Pining
away for you! - Naughty girl!

690
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,591
What's this?!

691
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:51,987
I'll meet you after school tomorrow.

692
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:56,959
It's been long since we met.
How much longer will this take?

693
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:03,761
Around six months. Come soon
tomorrow. Okay? - Okay.

694
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,804
Chocolate!

695
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,718
Mum, what papers are these?

696
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:22,547
Who asked you to remove those?
Those are my articles.

697
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,816
Keep it back.

698
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:29,488
Shantanu!
- Coming!

699
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,560
You've written so much!

700
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,539

 used to write for around
ten hours everyday.

701
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:42,134
Now onwards, all I'll do
is write in my free time.

702
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:48,514
lfeel like writing a lot.
All the time. I'm restless!

703
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,951
lfeel 
 only need to sit
and I'll be able to write.

704
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,518
I finished writing 'Paris
Yellow' in the plane.

705
01:19:55,924 --> 01:20:00,122
It's a nice name, isn't it? You went
to Paris? You didn't tell me.

706
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:01,989
So what if I didn't go!

707
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:03,993
Does everyone really go every where!

708
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,924
It's all about imagination.
I saw Paris on the video.

709
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,470
'Everywhere in America,' 'Taming
in Miami.'

710
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,876
Didn't forget you, New York,'
'On the bus, Columbus!'

711
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,506
So many in such a short time? Let
the publishers know right away!

712
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,641
They'll..

713
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,620
Oh dear, they're flying off.
What are you staring at?

714
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:38,792
Grab them. Oh no, mum's writing
is flying all over the place.

715
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:41,096
Come on, pick it up.

716
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,668
Hey wind, leave!

717
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,607
Sister has taken all the papers.

718
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,841
Mum, sister has taken
all the papers.

719
01:20:55,784 --> 01:21:02,622
Get hold of the papers.
You'll tear them.

720
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:03,851
Move, move!

721
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,121
Let go, let go!

722
01:21:13,135 --> 01:21:15,467
Stop Jill, she is eating everything.

723
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,666
Give it to me.

724
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:31,814
Oh no, she ate it. It's either
Jill or me in this house.

725
01:21:32,755 --> 01:21:33,813
Which one did she eat?

726
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,584
I think it's 'On the bus, Columbus.'

727
01:21:39,762 --> 01:21:43,528
Mum, give her some medicine
so she vomits.

728
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,128
But will the alphabets be visible?

729
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,761
They'll dissolve with the saliva.

730
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,829
Quiet! Don't talk rubbish!

731
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:56,134
Instead of getting so excited,
why not rewrite some pages?

732
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:57,970
Very simple, isn't it?

733
01:21:58,514 --> 01:21:59,811
You haven't done anything yourself.

734
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:01,746
I saw all these years what you did.

735
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,943
Can ghosts talk?

736
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:35,643
Not just talk, they can sing
and dance too. I've seen it.

737
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:36,775
Where?

738
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:41,584
What do you mean where?
I've seen so many ghosts.

739
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:47,493
Catch him, catch him!
Beat him, hit him!

740
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:54,162
Catch him, catch him!
Beat him, hit him!

741
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:59,765
He is such a cheat! I thought I
felt something creeping on my back..

742
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:02,868
Hit him! Hit the fool! Hit him!

743
01:23:02,945 --> 01:23:06,472
Nakul! Nakul!

744
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,449
Hit him, hit him!

745
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:20,119
Go home.

746
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,124
I had come about seven-eight
months back. - Yes.

747
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,718
To buy Bengali books on America.
- Yes.

748
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:29,725
Are there any new books since then?

749
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:33,199
Hey, get the new books
on America! Give!

750
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,476
Here.

751
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:49,882
This, this and this.

752
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:02,154
Do these books sell?

753
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:06,660
Sell? They're going like hot cakes!

754
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,770
They sell as soon as
they're unpacked.

755
01:25:09,972 --> 01:25:11,030
Which ones do you want?

756
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:13,032
Shumonto!

757
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,173
Excuse me!

758
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:34,189
Were you calling me? Do
you know me? Who are you?

759
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:53,144
Listen to me.

760
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:59,011
Listen to me. It'll be good for you,
mark my words.

761
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:05,856
You're still angry with me.
I meet Putul sometimes.

762
01:26:07,429 --> 01:26:10,762
I speak to her too.
- I know.

763
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:17,731
I never wanted Putul or you
to ever leave Majhipur.

764
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:27,446
You get insomnia from me. So many
times I spent the night..

765
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:32,818
..just gazing at your face.

766
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:36,749
There was no way mum
could've continued..

767
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,019
..staying in that house.

768
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,891
That's what your mother thought too.

769
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:50,028
You see, love only lasts as long
as everything is hunky dory.

770
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:53,666
The minute something is amiss..

771
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:59,137
Mum could not accept Abha
and you together.

772
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,914

 used to love Abha at one time.

773
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:09,213
But I never thought I could
spend a lifetime with her.

774
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:14,487
That is why I had moved
very far from her.

775
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:17,497
Yet, when I met her after so long..

776
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,625
..old feelings were rekindled.

777
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:25,665
You could've spoken to mum about it.

778
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,872
Putul refused to listen
to anything that day.

779
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:36,678
She didn't even want to know how
I survived after you left.

780
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:42,522

 talk about all that now,
maybe she understands or may..

781
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,650
..be she doesn't.

782
01:27:49,798 --> 01:27:50,856
What is that mark on your hand?

783
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,665
The bullet had hit me here that day.

784
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:07,481
Does it still hurt?
- No.

785
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:14,716
Dad, do you want to eat something?

786
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:18,753
You used to love roast meat
and pan fried bread.

787
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:23,564
It's available at a shop here.
Want to have some?

788
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:26,724
You still remember?
- Yes.

789
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:31,163
Come, let's go.

790
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,251
lt's tasty, isn't it?

791
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:56,529
I've been thinking for so many days.

792
01:28:58,133 --> 01:29:01,068
If I ever met you, I'd say..

793
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:10,135
..dad, I really love you!

794
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:13,105
That day..

795
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:29,154
If the bullet had hit my head
that day, I'd have died.

796
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:37,503
I wanted to ask you, did you really..

797
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:41,668
..want to kill me that day?

798
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:55,249
Dad, you used to wear
a blue shirt, remember?

799
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:57,888
That's so long ago.

800
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:06,193
Come, let me buy you a shirt.
I'm sure we'll get one like that.

801
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:23,180
Dad, walk a bit. Go on, walk.

802
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:40,962
You look like you used to!

803
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:45,731
Please give me a pant to match.

804
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:48,571
Oh no, I don't need any more.
- No, I want to.

805
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,677
It's the first
time I'm buying you something.

806
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:10,930
Dad, what are you looking at?
- This city.

807
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:19,033
Everything is fine,
like before. Only..

808
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:24,877
Why didn't you look
for us after we left?

809
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:35,216

 used to wait for you
at home. Nobody came.

810
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:39,488
Had you come..

811
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:46,557
Then I thought no one waits for me.

812
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:49,502
No! After mum's temper cooled down..

813
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:53,200
..we went home again.

814
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:58,003
Mum waited for you all day.

815
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:03,579
One day we realised you won't come.

816
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,951
l was worried! Very worried!

817
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:11,959
Then I heard one day that your car
had fallen off the cliff.

818
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,119
What happened?

819
01:32:16,598 --> 01:32:20,728
Do you remember? 
 used to
tell you about a picture.

820
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:26,463

 used to show you a picture of
a beautiful place and say..

821
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:31,569
..I will go there one day. Yes.

822
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:36,182
One day l was speeding
unnecessarily.

823
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:42,579
Suddenly I came to a place.
It was exactly like that place.

824
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:47,922
The place that everyone wants
to go to sooner or later.

825
01:32:50,632 --> 01:32:52,725
I had named that place Kusumpur.

826
01:32:56,104 --> 01:33:01,667
When I reached there I felt
I'm not waiting for anyone any more.

827
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:05,872
Why did you return?

828
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:16,513
l was still attached to
some things. That is why.

829
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:26,533
Dad, did you take the
packet from the store?

830
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:32,506
You didn't take it?
You left it there!

831
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:37,971
Wait here, I'll run
and get it. Wait.

832
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:28,791
ldris? Abdul! Do you remember me?

833
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:34,797
Many years back, you were
walking through a field.

834
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:36,460
Playing on your flute.

835
01:34:37,472 --> 01:34:39,599
You said, you'd teach
me to play the flute!

836
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:40,932
Do you remember?

837
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,076
Keep this.

838
01:35:48,009 --> 01:35:50,477
'Countless people have been
affected by the terrible..

839
01:35:50,545 --> 01:35:53,810
..floods in Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar and Orissa.'

840
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:57,481
'Lack of supplies and
medicines has led to..

841
01:35:57,552 --> 01:35:58,883
..epidemics in these places.

842
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,620
Many people are dying every day.

843
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:03,418
River Bhagirathi is flowing
near the danger mark at..

844
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:05,015
..Balagadh in Hooghly.

845
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:07,423
Under these conditions all
communication between..

846
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,827
..North and South Bengal
has broken down.

847
01:36:11,633 --> 01:36:14,431
Near village Jagadhari the
Teesta-Torsha Express is..

848
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:18,165
..stuck. 6 out of the 16 carriages
have been rescued.

849
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:21,907
The engine and the ten remaining
carriages have not been lifted yet.

850
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:23,910
The earth beneath the railway
line has eroded away.

851
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:25,103
The rail track is floating on water.

852
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:26,976
The roads too are in
the same condition.

853
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:29,449
The most shocking bit of news in
all this is that all relief..

854
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:31,451
..material that has poured in
from different countries..

855
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:33,043
..is being spirited away mid-way!

856
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:37,055
Yes, they're spiriting it away,
stealing it mid-way, the fool!

857
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:38,453
It is suspected minister, Lattoo
Singh, the idiot, is taking..

858
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:40,585
..everything away!
Can you believe it?

859
01:36:40,662 --> 01:36:43,460
When people are dying of hunger
and disease these..

860
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:47,126
..people are busy lining
their own pockets!

861
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:27,027
Supriya, Supriya!

862
01:38:29,771 --> 01:38:30,829
What do you want?

863
01:38:34,509 --> 01:38:42,177
After almost seven years,
lfeel like it. I mean..

864
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:54,587
Have you used soap?
- No.

865
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:00,457
Have you brushed?
- No.

866
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:03,061
Have you had a wash?

867
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,195
No, nothing.

868
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:06,197
Then?

869
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:14,477
Even if I chew an entire soap,
a tube of toothpaste and..

870
01:39:14,549 --> 01:39:19,486
..drink an entire bottle of Dettol
(disinfectant) bottle included..

871
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:21,681
..you won't stop despising me.

872
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:35,562
Excuse me. I haven't
told you something.

873
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,038
I'm leaving this house.

874
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:45,906
lfeel shocked even to think of it.

875
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:49,580
lfell in love and married you.

876
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:57,990
I thought you'd do something,
become someone. But..

877
01:39:58,059 --> 01:39:59,583
What is your idea
of doing something?

878
01:40:00,528 --> 01:40:01,859
What does becoming someone mean?

879
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:05,989
I'm fine the way I am.

880
01:40:06,601 --> 01:40:07,659
You don't know it.

881
01:40:08,536 --> 01:40:14,475
But actually, Shanta and Shantanu
are not your kids.

882
01:40:15,476 --> 01:40:19,537
I didn't tell you all these days.
But I can't go on any more.

883
01:40:25,553 --> 01:40:29,819
I knew it, I knew everything.

884
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:40,230
You knew it?
- Yes, I knew it.

885
01:40:41,636 --> 01:40:43,501
You may have left much earlier.

886
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,768
You couldn't because of
Shanta and Shantanu.

887
01:40:49,644 --> 01:40:50,702
You knew it?

888
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:59,042
Supriya, life is of many hues.

889
01:41:00,187 --> 01:41:03,054
Your life is like yours
mine is like mine.

890
01:41:03,925 --> 01:41:06,723
Who is to say which one is
right and which one isn't?

891
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:10,656
Shanta and Shantanu could've
been entirely mine.

892
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:14,534
Just because they aren't,
didn't change anything.

893
01:41:15,937 --> 01:41:17,199
I love them.

894
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:25,211
They will go where 
 go.

895
01:41:29,016 --> 01:41:38,015
If they go, they will.
Do you know them?

896
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:07,453
l have a bit of your nose,
a bit of your ear..

897
01:42:07,521 --> 01:42:09,512
..and a bit of your heart.

898
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:17,191
You're my world you're
everything to me.

899
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:24,917
Where is 9 by 2?

900
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:27,846
I joined today.

901
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:30,183
This one. Whose letter is it?

902
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:32,057
Supriya Bannerji.

903
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:35,522
Supriya, Supriya.

904
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:00,748
You can give it to me.

905
01:46:00,955 --> 01:46:03,014
Oh no, this is an important letter.
I've to give it to her.

906
01:46:03,157 --> 01:46:04,818
But she is not opening the door.

907
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:07,891
It's important, from the
Guinness World Records.

908
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,086
What?

909
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:13,022
Are you her husband?
- Yes.

910
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:17,634
Then take it. Sign here.

911
01:46:41,996 --> 01:46:46,456
Dear Supriya Bannerji,
congratulations!

912
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,463
You've won the right to
be included in the..

913
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:54,667
..Guinness Book of World Records
for your amazing..

914
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:59,076
..contribution to international
understanding by writing in..

915
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:04,482
..the last year, the most words,
1 million, 298,000..

916
01:47:04,551 --> 01:47:08,078
..611, on America!

917
01:47:09,023 --> 01:47:13,016
For this great cultural
achievement, we're happy to..

918
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:17,029
..invite you to fly
to New York at once.

919
01:48:12,019 --> 01:48:13,111
Mum has gone.

920
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:24,891
You're here.

921
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:44,173
How do you feel to
be alive, Shumonto?

922
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:51,050
Like walking the tightrope.

923
01:48:52,926 --> 01:49:01,527
Still, everyday when I wake up
and look around 
 feel good.

924
01:49:02,936 --> 01:49:10,604
When I see someone eating
alone I feel like crying.

925
01:49:12,613 --> 01:49:17,482
When a melody comes floating
on the air from a..

926
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:22,488
..distance, when 
 see someone
loving someone..

927
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:28,688
..someone wiping another's tears
away, I feel like crying.

928
01:49:30,964 --> 01:49:38,496
Daddy, may be I could
not become anyone but..

929
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:42,906
..you know, I still love to live.

930
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:50,973
Shumonto you're quite different.
A unique individual.

931
01:49:52,786 --> 01:49:57,120
How many can survive
like you're doing?

932
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:04,788
How many can love like you?
If only I could have done it.

933
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,468
Dad, do you remember the times
when I went with you..

934
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:12,596
..to the market every Sunday?

935
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:18,204

 used to hold on to one finger
of yours so firmly.

936
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:23,015
I felt no one could harm me!

937
01:50:25,686 --> 01:50:26,744
I remember.

938
01:50:29,556 --> 01:50:31,490
You went to check patients..

939
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:34,220
..I would accompany you sometimes.

940
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:40,625

 used to do this and that.
Do you remember? - I do.

941
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:47,570
Nowadays, I forget everything
in my sleep sometimes.

942
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:51,503
lfeel the world is as it was.

943
01:50:52,713 --> 01:50:58,515
Putul is continuing with her
embroidery and little you..

944
01:50:58,585 --> 01:51:04,649
..are cycling by my side.
Then I remember everything.

945
01:51:16,069 --> 01:51:23,874
Daddy, have you ever seen
love turn to pity?

946
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:36,888
Finally, in the end, all I could
see in Supriya's eyes, was pity.

947
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:44,555
Actually, we couldn't become
the way they wanted us to be.

948
01:51:46,767 --> 01:51:48,564
I've no regrets about that.

949
01:51:51,972 --> 01:51:57,706
Now I remember why nothing
appealed to me that day.

950
01:51:59,112 --> 01:52:04,448
Why did I feel what will happen,
what can happen?

951
01:52:06,787 --> 01:52:10,450
Despite knowing everything
I drove the car..

952
01:52:10,524 --> 01:52:12,185
..toward the valley.

953
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:17,453
Didn't you think about me?

954
01:52:25,672 --> 01:52:27,936
Don't you feel like returning, dad?

955
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:36,945
I do. Now that I'm alone
I can understand it all.

956
01:52:38,552 --> 01:52:43,615
I've a lot to say. That which
I didn't say before.

957
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:55,964
Daddy, mum is going in
that plane, isn't it?

958
01:52:56,236 --> 01:52:57,498
No, silly!

959
01:53:17,457 --> 01:53:18,719
Daddy, catch!

960
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:08,439
l have a bit of your nose,
a bit of your ear..

961
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:11,170
..and a bit of your heart.

962
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:20,177
You're my world you're
everything to me.

963
01:54:20,921 --> 01:54:28,919
The nose is in it's place,
the ear is in it's place.

964
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:37,660
Is your heart in place? Does
the forest sleep in peace?

965
01:54:38,071 --> 01:54:42,064
So, I've a bit of your heart.

966
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:50,749
Multitudes in the forest,
but each one is alone.

967
01:54:51,618 --> 01:54:59,491
Their only relatives are
their woes and sorrows.

968
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:04,021
So, I've a bit of your heart.

969
01:55:04,498 --> 01:55:08,491
So, I've a bit of your heart.

970
01:55:09,169 --> 01:55:14,436
l have a bit of your nose,
a bit of your ear..

971
01:55:14,508 --> 01:55:17,033
..and a bit of your heart.

972
01:55:17,978 --> 01:55:26,579
You're my world, you're
everything to me.
