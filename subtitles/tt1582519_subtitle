1
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:58,248
Twenty people are
reduced to ashes in one month.

2
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,519
My father has died.
Brother has died.

3
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,528
I think an epidemic has
spread in our village.

4
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,346
Why are you so many
people dying after all? Yes?

5
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,346
What is our fault in it?

6
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,282
The entire village will be
converted into a cemetery.

7
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,750
And we can't do anything?!

8
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,286
Isn't there any remedy?

9
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,730
The total figure is 534, Siddha.

10
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,931
Only this many people
are alive in the village.

11
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,670
Vishweshwarai.

12
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:35,348
Born in 9 planets, 12 star signs,
27 constellations..

13
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:41,883
...a valiant will come
here within 48 days.

14
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,492
Go! Go and search him
in the north direction.

15
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,965
The wind is showing
you the direction.

16
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,365
This land will protect you.

17
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,640
Siddha, nothing will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you.

18
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,435
Go. Go soon. Go.

19
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,701
Whom do I have to find?

20
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,780
That man's face
will be very glorious.

21
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,843
His glowing facial
features will be like fire.

22
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,719
A storm! He will run like a storm!

23
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,389
But how will I find him?

24
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,657
You will hear his
voice automatically.

25
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,796
The birds and animals
will shout in a loud voice.

26
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,933
The rain will
welcome him on this land.

27
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,004
The soil of this place will dance.

28
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,737
Even the slight sound he
makes will also echo all around.

29
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,415
The one whom you want to see
will appear in front of you.

30
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,484
The sky will enthrone him.

31
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,812
The fire will dance to
the tune of his fingers.

32
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,823
His touch will put a tilak
(mark) of blood on your forehead.

33
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,689
Even the death
shivers at his sight..

34
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,956
...whose touch will
make you more powerful!

35
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,760
On watching him, even the
little children will start smiling.

36
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,562
On whose touch even a hut
will change into a palace.

37
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,767
Go and bring him,
Siddha. Go and bring him.

38
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,571
Yes. Siddha, be careful.

39
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,706
Do not look into his eyes.

40
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,638
Call him not with the voice of
your throat, but that of your heart.

41
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,986
If he comes, this
village will be saved.

42
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,778
Nothing will happen to you.

43
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,583
Go and call him. Go.

44
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,523
Om Namah Shivai!

45
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,849
Swami.
- The shield of death.

46
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,982
What is this?

47
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,585
This village has to be
saved within 48 days by Siddha.

48
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,083
Shoot him. Shoot him. Kill him.

49
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,817
Shoot him. Kill him.

50
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,753
Kill him.

51
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,811
Come on. Let's return.

52
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,906
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

53
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,241
Stop. Stop. Stop!
- Please stop, brother.

54
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,519
How are you feeling
on watching this spot?

55
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,452
I am feeling hot.
- Obviously you will feel.

56
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,984
Think something new.
I love this place.

57
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,525
I feel like camping here.

58
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,856
No! This is bad.

59
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,987
Never mind if it is bad.

60
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,395
Whoever will watch this program,
he will go mad.

61
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,593
Why are you saying this, sir?
- Then what else, brother?

62
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,871
If you tell them to make a
documentary on Rajasthan..

63
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,997
...everyone shows the camels,
sand dunes and rocks. - Yes.

64
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,935
We should cover the
entire Rajasthan. - How?

65
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,534
There is a way. I will show you.
- Yes.

66
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,076
Enjoy the breeze. Touch the
plants and trees. - Oh, oh!

67
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,346
We will take this
desert in our clutches.

68
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,545
We will take it in our clutches?
- Yes.

69
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,956
Oh, my God!

70
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,284
Help!

71
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,357
Oh, my God! I tore the
land open and popped up?

72
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,902
Why are you asking me? I
didn't understand it either.

73
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,028
I thought I had a heart fail.

74
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,571
I had slept on the
ground last night.

75
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,300
It means the land covered you?

76
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,169
I thought I will go
around the entire Rajasthan..

77
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,575
...but after I fell asleep I
felt as if the land was revolving.

78
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,044
What?
- Goodness me!

79
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,576
But what is all this
after all, brother?

80
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,911
It is dust, brother.

81
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,042
You will get rid of it
when you rub it off.

82
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,312
Do not sneeze,
Babulal, you will die.

83
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,445
How do you know that
my name is Babulal?

84
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,914
I have come to know
from your identity card.

85
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,050
Why are you so surprised?

86
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:09,985
Are you from Mumbai?

87
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,929
Yes, brother. I have come here to
make a documentary film on Rajasthan.

88
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,126
Brother, actually I really
love Rajasthan's climate. - Oh!

89
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,936
I am the director and
they are my assistants.

90
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,062
Huh? Where have they disappeared?

91
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,196
Did they run away when I shouted?

92
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,207
A coward can never become an
assistant director. - What?

93
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,943
We will talk rest of
the things later. - Yes.

94
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,478
Go and bring the luggage first.
- Yes, I will bring it right now.

95
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,143
Babulal.
- Yes?

96
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,611
Will you feel bad if I
ask something? - No.

97
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,152
Have you come to the
desert to shoot a documentary..

98
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,952
...or to do romance
with the heroines?

99
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,152
I don't make any
relations with the girls. - What?

100
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,955
By the way, I don't have any
relations with the girls too.

101
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,627
Are you that?
- What?

102
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,489
Sir, by the way, for what
work have you come here?

103
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,625
Me, right?
- Yes.

104
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,566
To dry the clothes
in bright sunshine.

105
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,966
You are not replying any
of my questions correctly.

106
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,506
Will I reply
correctly if you ask me?

107
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,169
Do you know Hardoike Raju?
- I love him.

108
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,245
He is grandfather's darling.
That is my name.

109
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,370
So you are Hardoike Raju?

110
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,176
Yes. it was a long name, so
I kept a short name as Raju.

111
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,381
How is my name?
- It sounds good to hear.

112
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,653
And while uttering it too.
- Oh!

113
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,648
Sir, what is your father?

114
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,121
I don't have my parents.

115
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,452
My grandfather is all I have.

116
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,720
He is a teacher. He
teaches in school too.

117
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,322
He takes the class at home too.

118
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,987
Honestly speaking, he is a bookworm.

119
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,663
If he gives a gift, he
gives a pen or pencil only.

120
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,462
I was fed up of studying.

121
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,995
There is maid who does
all the household chores..

122
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,404
...while watching TV.

123
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,012
And this is the cook. She
cooks while reading a book.

124
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,544
And this is the photo of my parents.

125
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,010
'Grandfather, take the
progress report. - Very good.'

126
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,214
What should I tell you, Babulal?

127
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,019
There was no happiness
on grandfather's face..

128
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,150
...even if I scored
90 marks out of 100.

129
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,352
'You have scored only
90 marks out of 100?!'

130
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,696
'If this goes on, what
will you do when you grow up?'

131
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,560
'I have got a job as a
taxi driver, grandfather.'

132
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,032
'You have diabetes so
I didn't bring sweets.'

133
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,566
'Never mind, son. You have
become self-sufficient.'

134
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,435
We had a son after ten
months of our marriage.

135
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,303
I had been on a
pilgrimage since six months..

136
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,637
...and a son was
born to my wife here.

137
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,305
I want to make him a doctor.

138
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,513
By the way, if you see the
old records of me and my wife..

139
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,448
...he will never become a doctor.

140
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,248
I will have to give
donations and I need money for it.

141
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,053
And if we don't make him a
doctor due to lack of money..

142
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:25,393
...then he will become a
driver like you when he grows up.

143
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,732
That's why I have
opened this travels agency.

144
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,396
That is the car and this is the key.

145
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,408
Keep this identity card.
All the best.

146
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,340
This car is small. Don't
you have a bigger one?

147
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,206
My friend owns a transport office.
Shall I send you there?

148
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,079
You have a good sense of humor.
- Yes.

149
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,144
I want to ask you something.
Will you mind it? - Not at all.

150
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,280
Ask without hesitation.

151
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,687
Don't feel bad.
- I won't.

152
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,555
You were on a
pilgrimage for six months..

153
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,424
...then how did your
wife become pregnant?

154
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,761
'No other job is as
carefree as a taxi driver's job.'

155
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,624
'You do not have to
give a reply to anyone..'

156
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,294
'..or take orders from anyone.'

157
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,305
Hey, don't take the right,
but the left turn.

158
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,635
'Stop your stupid voice, idiot.'

159
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,766
From the left?
- Yes.

160
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,371
Brother, are you
driving a bullock-cart?

161
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,312
Drive faster or I will miss
the flight. - Certainly, sir.

162
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,359
'If you take one more round,
your kidney or liver will pop out.'

163
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,486
Rs. 300, sir.
- What?

164
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,619
Rs. 300, sir.

165
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,506
"Wretched man, is it
your father's road?"

166
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,239
"I too have the same
right on it as you."

167
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,252
"You have challenged a
brave man by mistake."

168
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,249
"Look, I too know to abuse."

169
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,725
"Goons and criminals salute me."

170
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,592
"Buddy, I will teach you a lesson."

171
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,733
"First your car will be damaged."

172
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,396
"All the public will
watch your scene."

173
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,200
"I will make your
condition such today.."

174
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,743
"..that you will never be
able to drive a car again."

175
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,937
"I will make you pay."

176
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,612
"I will make you pay dearly."

177
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:02,210
"I won't come in
anyone's hands now."

178
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:07,220
"I drive a taxi. A
taxi on the road."

179
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:12,356
"I drive a taxi. A
taxi on the road."

180
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,517
"No one is greater
than me in this world."

181
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,255
"No car is better than my taxi."

182
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,797
"Taxi!"

183
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,595
"Taxi!"

184
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,261
"I have changed the
directions of many storms."

185
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,805
"My taxi runs faster
than an aeroplane"

186
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,603
"Taxi!
- It's time to go!"

187
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,336
"Taxi!
- Yes!"

188
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,408
"I will never be scared of anyone."

189
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,813
"I will live with my head high."

190
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,887
"I will win the game, I
will play all the moves."

191
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,287
"I have seen great ones like me."

192
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,691
"Does anyone have the
guts to fight with me?"

193
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:22,495
"I will thrash him so hard
that he will never forget it."

194
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,297
"I drive a taxi. A
taxi on the road."

195
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,838
"No one can stop my taxi."

196
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,431
"I drive a taxi. A
taxi on the road."

197
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,976
"No one can stop my taxi."

198
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,463
"No one has ever
been able to stop me."

199
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,936
"No one has ever been
able to block my path."

200
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,803
"Taxi!"

201
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,537
"Taxi!"

202
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,943
"No one has ever been
able to win over me."

203
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,675
"No one has ever been
able to give me a reply."

204
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:17,619
"Taxi. Taxi."

205
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,884
"Whenever I rotate the steering."

206
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,620
"A feeling of fear
spreads all around."

207
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:27,356
"No one ever challenge
me or mess with me."

208
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,497
"Look at me. Know me. I
will reach my destination."

209
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:39,373
"I promise, I will touch the
sky with my hands one day."

210
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,844
"I drive a taxi. A
taxi on the road."

211
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,040
"No one has ever
been able to stop me."

212
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,049
"I drive a taxi. A
taxi on the road."

213
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,450
"No one has ever been
able to block my path."

214
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,388
Brother, by the way,
you didn't tell me..

215
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,788
...why you have come to Rajasthan?

216
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,052
Who comes without any reason?

217
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,721
You think I am mad?

218
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,924
I am trapped in
some trouble, brother.

219
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,463
The name of that
troublemaker is Sumita.

220
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,658
Her height is 5.10 inches.

221
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,739
5.10inches?! - Yes,
brother. She is like a pillar.

222
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,407
By the way, she looks mind blowing,
but she is dangerous.

223
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,473
She has played a
special role in my life.

224
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,476
I have met her four times.

225
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,482
Then what? The
autumn arrived in monsoon.

226
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,414
Meeting no. 1 . We had
met in a college campus.

227
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,421
Which college?
- To hell with the college.

228
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,615
I don't have to
take admission there.

229
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,419
An amazing earthquake
had occurred when I..

230
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,016
...spoke to her for the first time.

231
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,485
Strange people were roaming around..

232
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,621
...and on the top of it I
was receiving phone calls.

233
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,489
'Hello?'

234
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,624
'Welcome to Astro-world.
- Yes.'

235
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,894
'Please tell me your date of birth.'

236
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,833
'Mine? One minute.'

237
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,095
'Brother.
- Yes?'

238
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,433
'Brother from Kerela,
please walk ahead..'

239
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,564
'..otherwise the people
will think we are together.'

240
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,438
Sure. Sure. Let's walk ahead.

241
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,568
'It is 9th October.'

242
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:52,116
'9th October? Yes. Today you
will meet a person in blue dress.'

243
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,517
'And your life will completely
change because of that person.'

244
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,590
'Yeah. Whatever!'

245
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,788
'Hey, my cap.'

246
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,932
'Do you want a taxi?
- No.'

247
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,537
'Shall I carry your
things to the car?'

248
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,004
'No, no. I will go myself.'

249
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,002
'Coffee?
- No, thanks.'

250
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,669
'Take it. Tea?
- No, thank you.'

251
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,008
'Thumbs up?
- No.'

252
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,016
'Sweetheart, shall we sit and talk?'

253
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,483
'Sir, what should I bring?
- Bring anything.'

254
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,610
'Okay, sir.'

255
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,552
'Is this called life?
There is no joy or happiness.'

256
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,490
'She has refused flatly. Dammit!'

257
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,556
'Buddy, stop playing. Please.
Please, I beg of you. - Okay.'

258
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,036
'I am sorry. - What are you saying?
Don't you know to drive?'

259
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,834
'Look my car is damaged.
- I.. I am sorry..'

260
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,567
'Can't you drive carefully?
Who allotted the license to you?'

261
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,700
'See the condition of my car.'

262
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,834
'What's wrong, brother?
Why are you shouting?'

263
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:53,968
'She has wrecked my car.'

264
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,513
'Did you dash it?
- No, I was just turning it around.'

265
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,049
'You should have done it carefully.
- No, I was reversing it slowly..'

266
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,845
'A hard push, but it
has dashed slowly.'

267
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,716
'This is the condition of my
car when she dashed slowly.'

268
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,846
'What if she dashed hardly?'

269
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,719
'Hey! She is a girl. Don't
show your manliness at her.'

270
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,849
'Understood?'

271
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,586
'I will give him compensation.'

272
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,519
'Darling, have you gone crazy?'

273
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,654
'He will rob millions
of rupees from you..'

274
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,788
'..in the name of compensation.'

275
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,923
'I am here. I will
handle the situation.'

276
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,125
'All right?
- Okay.'

277
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,533
'Brother, if she would
have done purposely..'

278
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,661
'..you could have sent
her behind bars. - Yes.'

279
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,795
'But she has done it unknowingly..'

280
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,203
'..so take Rs. 100
or 150 and go away.'

281
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,138
'Rs. 100 or 150?!
- Rs. 500!'

282
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,941
'I know this girl. Take Rs. 500.'

283
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,537
'Brother, it is a car.
- I didn't say it's an elephant.'

284
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,673
'Settle the matter for Rs. 500.'

285
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,746
'It is fine for me,
but what about the taxi?'

286
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,550
'Taxi? The same which you
find at the railway station..'

287
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,558
'..with a black and
yellow combination?'

288
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,026
'No, not that. The
white car of Orange cab.'

289
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,960
'Goodness me! I am about
to get a heart stroke.'

290
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,033
'Is it written in blue on the side?'

291
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,966
'It is written in blue,
but why are you crying?'

292
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,964
'It is my taxi, brother.
- What?! it is your taxi?'

293
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,772
'Oh, my God! I am ruined.'

294
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,652
'Darling has said that
she has dashed slowly?'

295
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,848
'I am sorry.'

296
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,584
'Oh, my God! it is the same blue.'

297
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,788
'Damn you! So you
predict the future?'

298
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,129
'Hello?
- Welcome to Astro-world.'

299
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,135
'Yes. Who usually
predicts the future there?'

300
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,670
'Astrologer Anil Awasthi.
- Astrologer Anil Awasthi? I see.'

301
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,201
Where will I find him now?

302
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,209
'Ask anyone his address in Bandra.'

303
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,801
'He is very famous?
- Yes.'

304
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,808
'Look, shall I predict his future?
- Sure.'

305
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,282
'One man in white dress is
going to meet him in the evening.'

306
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,822
'Oh, wow! - After that Mr. Anil
Awasthi will walk on one leg.'

307
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,619
'But why? - Because I am
going to break his other leg.'

308
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,023
'Damn his prediction.'

309
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,628
'Meeting no. 2.' What
do you call the place..

310
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,038
...where you park your car?
- Parking place.

311
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,244
Yes. Parking place. There.

312
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,115
'Okay? So won't you
recognize me now? Hello! Come here.'

313
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,243
'Hi.
- Come here. Come.'

314
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,980
'I am sorry, I
didn't recognize you.'

315
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,715
'I am really sorry about that day.'

316
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,252
'I really didn't mean to do that.'

317
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,655
'Actually there were
many people there..'

318
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,660
'..so I got scared and left.'

319
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,856
'Actually it's my first accident.
I hope you understand.'

320
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:33,733
'First the glass. Second
the light. Third, the dent.'

321
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,207
'Thirty abuses from my boss.'

322
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,670
'The total is amount Rs. 8,950.'

323
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,677
'You can't escape by saying,
'I am sorry. I am very sorry.'

324
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,269
'I didn't know anything.'

325
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,349
'I will pay the amount. By
the way, how much is it?'

326
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,010
'Rs. 8,950. Give Rs.
10,000 as the round figure.'

327
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,747
'Rs. 9,000 is the round figure
for the amount Rs. 8,950, right?'

328
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,088
'There are more rounds
in Rs. 10,000. - Yes.'

329
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,753
'Take it.'

330
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,099
'She dashed it again? I am doomed.'

331
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,367
'Come out! Get down.'

332
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,911
'Damn you. Come out. Come out.'

333
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,711
'How will you be able
to see if you drive..'

334
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,249
'..wearing black goggles?'

335
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,114
'My side mirror is damaged.'

336
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:31,855
'Why are you glaring at me
like this? Will you kill me?'

337
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,725
'Are you angry at me?'

338
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,062
'You are too much.
You dashed my car.'

339
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,203
'You glared at me.
And you will kill me?'

340
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,999
'Then of what use am I? Lower
your eyes. Lower your eyes.'

341
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,734
'Otherwise I will gouge
them out. Lower your eyes.'

342
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,934
'What are you saying to madam?'

343
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,277
'I have not thought of anything
yet. Tell me if you have any idea.'

344
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,405
'Will I remain silent if
you will molest this girl?'

345
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,816
'I don't want a drama.
You go and do shopping.'

346
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,285
'Don't boast about your manliness.'

347
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,219
'A brave man like me
too lives in this city.'

348
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,756
'I will kill you, rogue.'

349
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,894
'I give you one minute's time.'

350
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,756
'If you don't leave from here,
you will never be able..'

351
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,766
'..to do what you were saying.'

352
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,372
'The God in heaven will punish you.'

353
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,376
'I didn't hear.
- I know you have heard it.'

354
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,378
'Speak loudly.
- I won't say anything else.'

355
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,504
'Rogue!'

356
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:24,973
'He was boasting on seeing a girl..'

357
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,107
'..and he has fled
on watching a dagger.'

358
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,784
'You were provoking him,
assuming that the matter will end..'

359
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,119
'..if I'll be dead.'

360
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,851
'I won't take a big
risk for a side mirror.'

361
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:39,988
'How much do you want?'

362
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,794
'I liked you because
everyone talks with their mouth..'

363
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,200
'..but you talk with money.'

364
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,466
'You think that you will
buy me on the basis money..'

365
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,201
'..so take out a bundle of notes.'

366
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,867
'Right now I don't have any cash.'

367
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,205
'So will you give me tomorrow?'

368
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,875
'So tell me.. where
should I meet you, darling?'

369
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,076
'What should I say, friend?'

370
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,896
Our third meeting was in a
coffee shop. That Farishta.

371
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,021
Not Farishta, but Barista.

372
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,223
Yes, I know. I know.

373
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,425
Hello? Listen quietly
what I am saying. Okay?

374
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,164
Hi! - Oh my God! Have you
forgotten to wear your pants?

375
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,508
Shut up!
- I see. So it is so short?

376
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,302
How much?
- How much is the calculation?

377
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,107
I will check and tell you.

378
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,246
I think she has a
lot of money. Sir, pen.

379
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,250
Two Mocha please.
- Okay, ma'am.

380
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,512
But why the Mocha? You
could have ordered for coffee.

381
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,850
That is also a coffee, sir.

382
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,450
You all sell the coffee by
such strange names. Go ahead.

383
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,924
Ma'am, here.
- Thank you.

384
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,462
Excuse me, sugar?

385
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,218
"Listen, O' beauty."

386
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,350
"You look ravishing."

387
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:21,091
"Don't cast a spell
with your eyes, damsel."

388
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,292
"Listen, O' beauty."

389
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,494
"You look ravishing."

390
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:30,233
"Don't cast a spell
with your eyes, damsel."

391
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,502
"Your face always
blooms in my eyes."

392
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:37,046
"No, no. No, no."

393
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:41,514
"Your magic works
whenever I confront you."

394
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,053
"it happens in love."

395
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,382
"Come on, let's go."

396
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,923
"Far away."

397
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,987
"Don't stop. Come on,
everything is moving on."

398
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,523
"Come on, let's go."

399
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,998
"Far away."

400
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:02,130
"Don't stop. Come on,
everything is moving on."

401
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:39,168
"Unite our hearts.
Why is this distance?"

402
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,178
"We both are young."

403
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,381
"You are with me. Oh, God,
it's fantastic."

404
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,387
"The land and sky are dancing."

405
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,513
"You are a cool boy."

406
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,525
"Sometimes when you
give me a problem."

407
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,466
"Come closer, become my sweetheart."

408
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,335
"Come and settle in my heart."

409
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:46,036
"You are my darling.
My heart is burning."

410
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,045
"I wonder what
will happen about me."

411
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,580
"Just chill boy,
don't say that again."

412
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:58,248
"What if we have a
fight in such a situation?"

413
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,516
"Oh, silly boy, don't say that."

414
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:04,391
"Sometimes when you
give me a problem."

415
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,053
"Sometimes when you
give me a problem."

416
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:11,391
"Come closer, become my sweetheart."

417
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:15,268
"Come and settle in my heart."

418
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,544
"Listen, O' beauty."

419
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,745
"You look ravishing."

420
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:34,484
"Don't cast a spell
with your eyes, damsel."

421
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,751
"Listen, O' beauty."

422
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,159
"You look ravishing."

423
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,699
"Don't cast a spell
with your eyes, damsel."

424
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,231
"Your face always
blooms in my eyes."

425
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,569
"it happens in love."

426
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,105
"Come on, let's go."

427
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,371
"Far away."

428
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,439
"Don't stop. Come on,
everything is moving on."

429
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,175
"Come on, let's go."

430
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,512
"Far away."

431
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,716
"Don't stop. Come on,
everything is moving on."

432
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,467
Will you take us to
Geological Survey of India?

433
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,139
Yes. Please sit.

434
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,536
Sir, you go, I will reach
within half an hour. - Okay!

435
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,211
Hello, Dr. Paranje speaking.
Is it director sir? - Yeah!

436
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,217
Sir, the building
is under renovation.

437
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,483
They say there is no one there.

438
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:42,285
But today is a working day.
Please come, Mr. Paranje.

439
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,417
Okay, sir.

440
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,820
Sir, are you a doctor?
- Yes.

441
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,162
I am feeling
exhaustion since a few days.

442
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,631
Please recommend me
anything else besides food.

443
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:53,567
I am not a medical doctor.
- Then?

444
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,172
I have done Phd in Geology.
Then I got this title.

445
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,572
There is such a thing too?
- Yes.

446
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,575
What does Geology mean?
- Earth science.

447
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,170
The science which informs about
the metals beneath the earth..

448
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,648
...and the rocks above it.

449
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,777
I have understood.

450
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,654
Senior officer is going to come.
Bring this board down. - Yes, sir.

451
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,587
Slowly. Carefully.
- Okay, sir.

452
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,591
Yes. I am doing it, sir.
- Carefully!

453
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,851
Yes, one minute. One minute.

454
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,330
Slowly.
- Yes, carefully.

455
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,677
Sir, your wallet?

456
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,818
They killed him?!

457
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,429
You are shocked just to hear it.

458
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,626
Then what must be my
condition on watching it?

459
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,424
I was terribly shocked.

460
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,430
Okay! So what happened
about the other one?

461
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,278
How sad! - He was like
junior Abhishek Bachchan.

462
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,343
He was finished within a moment.

463
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,485
You have told me everything,
but the reason..

464
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,892
...that why you have
come to Rajasthan.

465
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,488
The good news is, the
life insurance company..

466
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,963
...Is giving a
compensation of Rs. 200,000.

467
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,830
The bad news is, it will
cost Rs. 300,000 for CPR.

468
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,896
So shall I deduct Rs. One million
rupees slowly from your salary?

469
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,302
My salary is Rs. 6,000. if
you will deduct from it too..

470
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,431
...then how will I survive?

471
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,906
Don't talk great things.
I will explain it.

472
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,307
It was Dilawar Singh
who fell on your car.

473
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,845
There is an insurance of Rs.
500,000 on his name.

474
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,380
He is a resident of Rajasthan.

475
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,313
I have prepared all the documents.

476
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,714
This is a cheque of Rs. 500,000.

477
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,309
You give it to his wife
and bring Rs. 100,000.

478
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,445
Yes, as if she would
be waiting for me..

479
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,647
Why will she give me Rs. 100,000?

480
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,917
You have done the
accidents and didn't I spend on it?

481
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,721
Alright. I will give a
new car. You go by it.

482
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,320
I can never forget the food and
grandfather's scolding of that day.

483
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,526
Along with forgetting the way in
the desert, I lost my money too.

484
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,333
The situation was such that I
had to rob drinking water too.

485
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,530
This is my story, Babulal.

486
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,735
Bring two bread, one potato
and cabbage dish and buttermilk.

487
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,743
Smear a dash of butter to bread.

488
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,007
And for you, sir?
- No fat. No oil. No spice.

489
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,880
If you have any dishes
without them, then bring them.

490
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:33,981
Lord Bholenath, where will
he be in the three worlds?

491
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,851
Bhole!

492
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,809
Mr. Banwari! Mr.
Banwari, have they come?

493
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,013
Yes. They are arrived, madam.

494
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,485
I want to go to party.
I am getting late.

495
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,013
Yes, I know. You dance the
entire night, flirt around..

496
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,751
...and sleep
peacefully during the day.

497
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,486
I know what your problem is.

498
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,020
Good evening, sir.

499
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:14,888
You had wished me 'good
morning' in the morning..

500
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,432
...then why 'good evening' now?

501
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,024
You have got a habit of forgetting.

502
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,500
What will we do till
they come, sir?

503
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:25,833
You wear a skirt. I will wear pants.
We will dance in front of them.

504
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,434
Okay, sir. - What else? She is
talking about going to a party.

505
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,638
Her mother is drinking tea.

506
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,442
Her father is sucking
my blood. And.. - Hello?

507
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,642
I will call you later.
- Sir, juice?

508
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:36,846
You drink it. Drink it.

509
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:54,131
Hi, uncle.
- I am Law. Father-in-law.

510
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,603
Hi.
- Hi.

511
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,799
Oh, grandfather has come.
Grandfather has come.

512
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,538
Mr. DP, you have got a very
beautiful house. - Thank you.

513
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,880
What about GK?
- He is actually out of India.

514
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,814
But we can't wait. Sorry.
- Let's go.

515
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,546
She is my wife.

516
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,681
Hi.
- Hello.

517
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,815
They are our legal advisors.

518
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,032
Mr. Banwari.
- Sir.

519
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,701
Oh, it's okay. You
have very good values.

520
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,640
It's a beautiful place.

521
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,776
Bobby, why don't you
take a picture? - Sure.

522
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,578
Mr. Banwari, you click it.

523
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,178
She always tells me to
click the important photos.

524
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,184
Because you will not be
included in the photo.

525
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,591
Mr. Banwari.
- Sir?

526
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,523
You go now.
- What shall I bring?

527
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,927
Come later. Okay?

528
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,061
Hi.
- Hello.

529
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,605
Hello, aunt.
- She is my daughter, Sumita.

530
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,541
I am giving her to you. Go.

531
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,544
Are you sure, uncle?
- Hundred percent.

532
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,097
Is it your chopper?
- Yeah!

533
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,039
Hello? Yeah, we are starting now.

534
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,789
Thank you.

535
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,063
Wow!

536
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,741
It's beautiful!

537
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,803
Let's go.

538
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,676
How did you arrange all this?

539
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,680
If you wish, you can keep
this moon in your balcony too.

540
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,752
Excuse me!
- Yeah.

541
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,295
Hello? Yeah? I am a
little busy right now.

542
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,295
So call me in the morning.
Thanks. Yeah.

543
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,298
Hey, Sumita.

544
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,973
Hey, Sumita! Hey, Sumita, wait!

545
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,647
Sumita, wait!

546
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,711
Listen to me.

547
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,208
Dad.
- Yes?

548
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,682
Sumita is missing in Rajasthan.

549
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,889
That condom packet. I am sorry, dad.

550
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,162
What have you done? What did
you think about that girl?

551
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,697
A call girl who demands money?

552
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,760
I am making a business deal of Rs.
4 billion with her father.

553
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,030
Everything is ruined
because of your foolishness.

554
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,035
Stay out! Everyone is useless.

555
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,172
Is it? Is it not there?

556
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,302
Hello? Yes, sir.

557
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,381
I am sorry, Mr. Durga Prasad.
My son has made a mistake.

558
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,179
Your daughter will be with you
within 24 hours. Without fail.

559
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,314
Hey, go and check the work.

560
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:10,449
Impractical guys! They don't
know any planning as well.

561
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,398
Brother, do you see
any sea in front of you?

562
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,263
It is not a sea, but
your misconception.

563
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,802
You mean a mirage?
- Yes.

564
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:20,928
It means it is a deception.

565
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,336
A person's mind is so strange.

566
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,998
You have come here just
one day ago, right? - Yes.

567
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,736
That's why you see sea all around.
- I see.

568
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,334
I have come here since
last three days. - Really?

569
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,881
Look there. it seems
really Sumita is coming.

570
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,753
Hey, Raju! - Brother, it
seems she is coming running.

571
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:38,879
Really?
- Yes.

572
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,013
First it seemed she
was coming walking.

573
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:43,491
Brother, is it any mirage too?
- It shouldn't be.

574
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:44,885
Oh, my God!

575
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,486
Thank God to see you, Raju.

576
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,761
From last night I just see animals..

577
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,095
...and not a single human being.

578
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:52,428
Please take me home.

579
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:56,368
I'll give you as much money as
you want. Rs. 2,000 or 3,000.

580
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,441
Your round figure, Rs. 5,000.

581
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,379
Oh, I am so sorry. I
am Sumita. And you?

582
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:06,438
Documentary.
- Documentary? What are you saying?

583
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,780
Babulal. How did you come here?

584
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,319
That's a long story.

585
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,853
I had come here with someone
yesterday in a helicopter.

586
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,925
And today I have
duped him and run away.

587
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,319
But there is no taxi
or auto-rickshaw here.

588
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,862
What kind of a place is this?

589
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,791
You know, the mosquitoes bit me..

590
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,925
...and made me miserable
the whole night. Look here.

591
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,195
Do you know where we are right now?

592
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:31,867
Perhaps 20 or 30
kilometres away from Mumbai?

593
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,073
Raju, I need a shower badly.

594
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,475
By the way, where have
you parked your taxi?

595
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,423
A miracle occurred when you
hit me on my head that day.

596
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,562
I had to stay in the
hospital for three days.

597
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,825
The very next day, the unlucky
planet showed such an effect..

598
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,563
...that two men ready
to die boarded my taxi.

599
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,505
I dropped them at the office.
They went inside.

600
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,303
Someone shot them
and one of them died.

601
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,435
And the second one? Oh, my God!

602
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:12,173
This is the highlight. it's
amazing. Very interesting.

603
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,850
He came running
and fell on my taxi..

604
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,318
...and the taxi sank in the land.

605
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,252
I have heard a new
showroom has opened here.

606
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,984
I thought of buying
a new taxi from here.

607
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,927
And you want a taxi? You will
get a camel here, she-camel.

608
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,467
If you don't find it,
I will bend down..

609
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,126
...you sit on me and
I'll carry you.

610
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,195
You mean..

611
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,000
Mumbai is only 20-30
kilometres away from here?

612
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,133
Damn you!

613
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,940
Pakistan is close by. Look here.
Look at that sign.

614
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,481
Did you see?
- Oh!

615
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,082
There are such big mosquitoes here.

616
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,344
If the snake of
this place bites you..

617
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,476
...you won't even ask for water.

618
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,878
Madam, why did you
leave the helicopter..

619
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,354
...and get trapped here in Rajasthan?

620
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,017
The matter is not so.
He had condoms.

621
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,354
There were more risks so..

622
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,622
I don't have that too.
So there is more risk.

623
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,227
Please take me to Mumbai right now.

624
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,226
Why are you panicking? Accompany me.

625
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,428
You will die. - Don't scare us.
He always keeps on joking.

626
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,903
We will find some
railway station nearby..

627
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,303
...and we will depart to
Mumbai from there. - Yes.

628
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,967
Will you go out of here
with my darling? - Yes.

629
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,245
There is a limit of madness.

630
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,307
Babulal, while roaming in the sun,
you have lost your balance.

631
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,451
Forget him. You come with me.

632
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,058
Raise it.
- What?

633
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,192
Raise your skirt.

634
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,394
Hey, what are you looking at?

635
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,995
Her thighs are strong, Babulal.

636
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,468
We can't build such thighs. Come on.

637
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,136
Come and jump on me.
Make me a bubblegum..

638
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,405
...and stick me on the ground.

639
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,339
Man with small eyes!
- I have small eyes?

640
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,213
Whom did you call that?
- Leave me. Leave me.

641
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,150
Look! Look how she
is glaring at me..

642
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,949
...and she is standing
like a pillar. I will..

643
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,548
Sir! Sir! Sir! Forget it. She is
a poor girl. Come on. Let's go.

644
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,217
Oh, my God!

645
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,626
I am going home, Babulal.
- What?

646
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,562
I am fed up of her.

647
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,696
Lord Bajranbali!

648
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,375
You hit so perfectly. What an aim!

649
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,239
That's what I was saying
since such a long time.

650
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,036
Do you know how to play football?

651
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,047
Yes. I was forward in my school.

652
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,639
I was a goalkeeper in
my college, you know.

653
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,377
Really? So stop this.

654
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,056
Oh, no! Oh, no! You have killed him.

655
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,715
Babulal, get up! Get up, Babulal!

656
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,118
Oh, darn! He is bleeding too.

657
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,991
Give your scarf.
- No, no, why should I?

658
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,121
You give him yours.

659
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,255
You have hit him and
you are asking my scarf?

660
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,129
No, come on, give it quickly.
- No, I won't.

661
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:45,394
So you won't agree easily.

662
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,467
I will tear it away myself.

663
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,331
What are you doing? You
know how much it costs? Idiot!

664
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,067
Tell me, what happened, brother?

665
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,408
She made a goal and you missed it.

666
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,417
Brother, why is her dress torn up?

667
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:06,682
I have used it. - Oh! You used
her?! it means you used her?!

668
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,556
There is a lot of sand here.

669
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,220
It is very useful
for the sand sellers.

670
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,023
We don't have any benefit, Babulal.

671
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,154
Who named you Babulal?

672
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,097
Actually my father used to
work as an officer in the army.

673
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,101
That's why my mother
named me after his name.

674
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,364
Okay, Babulal, tell me,
where your parents stay?

675
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,439
My mother is in Mumbai
and father is in Bihar.

676
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,440
Sumita, your name is beautiful.

677
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,374
It is an old-fashioned name.
It is a long name.

678
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,106
Sumo. it will be
short and comfortable.

679
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,115
What is this Sumo? Short
and simple. Call me Su.

680
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,386
Susu means peeing. Will it be fine?

681
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,580
Sumo is dead.

682
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,453
I am trying to
download her in this system.

683
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,062
Sumo is a witch.
- Yes.

684
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,135
Sumo is a she-demon.
- Fantastic.

685
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,728
Babulal, we will form a
sentence out of it. - Why not?

686
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,471
Let's declare Sumo's death
day as National holiday.

687
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,599
Fantastic.

688
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,610
Sumo's murderer will
not get any punishment.

689
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,736
We will give him a reward too.

690
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,076
In fact we will distribute
sweets to the countrymen..

691
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,343
...on Sumo's death day.

692
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:08,475
With biscuits.
- Yes.

693
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:17,416
Babulal! Babulal! Oh, God!

694
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,095
Your dress will be
reduced to a bikini..

695
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,358
...If you will hit
Babulal twice more.

696
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,297
And I will die within this time.

697
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,763
Sumo! Sumo!
- Yes?

698
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,363
You are looking very sexy.

699
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,499
Hey!

700
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,509
Brother, it seems
to be a school bus.

701
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:40,776
Come on, hurry up. Hurry up.

702
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,176
Raju!

703
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,185
No one is seen around, brother.

704
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,314
The keys are there too. Let's go.

705
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,324
No, brother, what if it
explodes as soon we start it? - Why?

706
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,654
Perhaps someone
has installed a bomb.

707
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,651
Darn you!

708
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,796
Am I Sonia Gandhi and
you are Manmohan Singh..

709
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,126
...that someone will
stop a bus here for us..

710
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,791
...Install a bomb in it
and make it explodes?

711
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,198
Are you a fool?

712
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,127
You talk just nonsense.

713
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,533
Hey, someone is over there.

714
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,344
Brother, wait. He is
doing something there.

715
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,548
I am uprooting the plant.

716
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,876
It is such a
fantastic melon, brother.

717
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,482
My name is Babulal.

718
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:19,612
I am Tom Cruise.

719
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,816
What sort of name is it?
- My parents have named it.

720
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,160
I was a child, so I
couldn't object it.

721
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,422
By the way, what work do you do?
- Plant toxins.

722
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,554
What?
- What? What?

723
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,895
I am doing a research on
whether the plants have any poison.

724
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:32,293
So does it contain poison?

725
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,630
Yes.
- It is fantastic.

726
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,570
Hey, don't touch.
This is very dangerous.

727
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,641
It will cause septic
if it pierces you.

728
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,233
If it enters your body, you
won't get time to reach home.

729
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,369
You will be buried here.

730
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,636
To take it in a dickey.
- It's difficult.

731
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:44,771
In a train.
- No.

732
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:45,905
In a flight.
- Never.

733
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,581
Fantastic. Clever boy.

734
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,777
That's why I have brought this bus.
- I got it, brother.

735
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,318
He is going. He is going.
Ask him for a lift. Ask him.

736
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,720
Brother Tom. Brother Tom.
- What is it?

737
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,783
Please give us a lift.
- Why should I?

738
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,257
We will die in this sun.
- Then die.

739
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,263
Forget about us.
Think about that girl.

740
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,595
A girl? Where is she?

741
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,862
Where? - Such a beautiful
girl is right in front of you.

742
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,530
I see. This baby?
- Yes!

743
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,936
She looks very strong.

744
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,267
She can carry you. Why
do you want her? Please.

745
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:17,347
Don't joke. Darling, come here.
- I see! Darling!

746
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,210
You people having fun?

747
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,749
Even she loves plants
just like you do. - What?

748
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,878
Really?
- Yes.

749
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,880
Hi.
- Hi, I am Tom..

750
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,487
We were affected by her slowly.

751
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,621
But he slipped immediately.
- Forget it, brother.

752
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,562
A desert has sand
and sand has holes.

753
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,690
Are you okay?

754
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,428
What can I say? I'll have to.

755
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:40,693
I'll speak.

756
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,294
Excuse me, sir. You
help me to get up.

757
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,430
You pick it up.

758
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,564
Okay.

759
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,300
Thank you.

760
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,776
May I help you?
- Hey, don't touch.

761
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,903
I will, okay?

762
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,977
Hey, give me that.

763
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,644
Thank you.

764
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:03,987
Tom, listen.

765
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,325
Will you give us a lift, please?

766
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,665
What an amazing style!
- Yes.

767
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,261
If only she was mine..

768
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,392
...I would've given her a lift.

769
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,535
Lift. Come.

770
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,402
Thank you.

771
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,340
Crap!

772
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,409
What do say now, Babulal?

773
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,611
Forget it, sir.

774
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,018
Handle.. - if there's a screw,
it'll be loose. And it'll come off.

775
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,950
Right?
- Forget your discussion.

776
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,884
Help Tom first.

777
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,026
God! Tom. Come.

778
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,502
Road is unruly.

779
00:51:55,412 --> 00:52:00,782
If you don't mind,
can I kill this girl?

780
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,053
What? What did he say?

781
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,051
He is thinking of killing
my darling. - You'll kill?

782
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,052
If I had strength, I
would've killed her all on my own.

783
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,455
But she is strong.

784
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,532
That's why I need help.
- But what has she done?

785
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,398
What has she done? I
fell down in the hole..

786
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,597
...as soon as she touched me.

787
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,806
The second time, I flew up
in the air and fell down.

788
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,339
Sometimes it's in
people's legs and sometimes..

789
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:29,605
...In the tongue.

790
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,939
She has it in all her body.
- What?

791
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:36,809
Iron. She's an iron lady.
- Correct.

792
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,079
I am saying the same thing.

793
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,682
But Babulal doesn't agree.

794
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:42,019
Let him not agree.
Both of us do know, right?

795
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,752
This is wrong.
- What is wrong?

796
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,020
She wants to kill me. Is that right?

797
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,823
How can you know in stray incidents?

798
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,954
But what do you say
about what happened with us?

799
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,695
That was not an incident.
It was an accident.

800
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,694
I will prove it.

801
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,094
See.

802
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,441
What is it?
- Mosquito.

803
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,111
What happened? Nothing.

804
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,719
Shano. Come here quickly.

805
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,982
See, we have guests in the village.

806
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,523
Let's give them food.

807
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,650
You said something
is about to happen.

808
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,389
They are giving us
food without asking.

809
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,521
Brother?
- Yes.

810
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,462
Not everyone is bad.
There are good people too.

811
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,398
There are no plants around here.

812
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:26,662
Mobiles are not working.

813
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,135
Something's wrong, brother.

814
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,598
Not something, brother.

815
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,071
I feel everything is wrong.

816
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,735
Could there be a
knife in the carrier?

817
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,400
How can she get a knife?

818
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,672
She seems like a knife herself.

819
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,408
Yes, it'll be better if you
do research on plants with..

820
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,609
...fruits rather than thorns.

821
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:45,881
Take. Take.
- Thank you aunt.

822
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,481
Enough! Enough.
- Take.

823
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,151
Here.
- Thank you.

824
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,963
The food was good, right?
- Yes. Very tasty.

825
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,836
It was for free. it had to be tasty.

826
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,708
Hey, where is my bus, man?

827
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,844
Hey, where are those people?

828
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,648
Oh my God!

829
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,845
Bus! Bus!

830
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,515
God! They fed us and
took the bus away.

831
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,592
So, Babulal. You said
that not everyone's bad.

832
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:25,718
There are good people too.

833
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:30,061
The hands that fed us
stole the bus parts too. - Yes.

834
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,134
You made Tom incur loss.
- What?

835
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,668
Loss, brother.
- It's okay.

836
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,466
Have you read the book
called Secret? - What?

837
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,200
Reading people's secret
books is not a good habit.

838
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,533
I love attraction.
- Meaning?

839
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,812
She has negative attraction.

840
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,140
Touch her..
- You'll burn.

841
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:45,475
Hold her..
- You'll burn, brother.

842
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,140
If you marry her?
- Sand.

843
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,877
Oh!
- You'll turn into sand.

844
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,743
So what should we do, sir?
- Let's kill her.

845
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,483
Correct, sir. Kill her.
I won't interfere.

846
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,819
There is a village called Girdwara.
- Yes.

847
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,552
Dilwara Singh's family stays there.
- Okay.

848
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,492
We'll give them 5,00,000
and get one back. - Good.

849
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,497
And then in the night,
Babulal and I will..

850
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,499
...hold her legs and you..
- Yes.

851
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,502
No sir, don't get me into all
these matters. Please. - Raju!

852
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,164
Yes, darling. - You wanted to
go to Girdwara village, right?

853
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,501
Why, is it in your bag?

854
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,098
No, it is here.

855
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:14,840
My lovely staring..

856
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,783
Dilwar Singh's house?

857
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,120
This is the one, sir.

858
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,257
I am Dilwar's dad.

859
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,119
You? Come in.

860
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,062
Come in. Sit.

861
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:43,606
After my son passed away, even
his friends stopped coming here.

862
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:49,401
There are small children at home,
and I am old.

863
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,209
There is nothing to eat at home.

864
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:59,821
Though you don't know us,
you came this far to pay us.

865
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,958
You are God for us, sir.

866
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,089
You are God for us.

867
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,957
You are God for us.

868
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:17,096
After his son died, even
his friends didn't look back.

869
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:22,773
He's happy that you're helping
him despite being a stranger.

870
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,251
Should I ask about your share?

871
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:33,848
How can you ask now?

872
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,049
Have you seen his state?

873
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,051
They don't have enough to eat.

874
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:38,987
How will they pay 1,00,000?

875
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,729
I don't want it. The
owner will ask for money.

876
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,657
I'll give it. I'll
take a loan and pay it.

877
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:47,864
Or I'll take it from grandpa.

878
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:49,931
He's my grandpa after all.

879
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,808
It got out of my hands.

880
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,882
Okay. Sit.

881
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,952
Hey, come here.

882
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,824
Have fun! Go.

883
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,038
Don't stare. You'll get it too.

884
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:35,116
"He plays a sweet tune.
Radha is impressed."

885
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,710
"Gopis call for Girdhar Nandlala."

886
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,312
"Nandlala."

887
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:45,725
"He plays a sweet tune.
Radha is impressed."

888
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:49,060
"Gopis call for Girdhar Nandlala."

889
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,065
"Nandlala."

890
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,398
"Gopis call for Girdhar Nandlala."

891
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:16,424
"I can't say it."

892
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:21,163
"I can't say it."

893
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:25,826
"I can't stay without saying it."

894
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:30,235
"I can't stay without saying it."

895
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,777
"I can't say it."

896
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:39,178
"I can't stay without saying it."

897
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:44,117
"There is a fire that is
making my heart suffer."

898
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,247
"I'm awake all night.
Sleep eludes me."

899
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:53,386
"This restlessness of
the heart is my love."

900
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:56,260
"I will tell her today."

901
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,390
"I'll tell her."

902
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,869
"I'll tell her
honestly that I love her."

903
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:06,465
"I'll tell her all the secrets
that are hidden in my heart."

904
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,937
"Govinda."

905
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,138
"Govinda."

906
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,272
"Govinda."

907
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,817
"Govinda."

908
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,410
"Govinda."

909
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:09,000
"Why doesn't she tell me?"

910
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:13,872
"Why doesn't she tell me
the secrets of her heart?"

911
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:20,081
"She can't say that
she's in love too."

912
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:24,882
"She can't stay away.
She doesn't come close."

913
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:30,016
"The heart doesn't agree. I
can't take this pain anymore."

914
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,095
"Today she will speak."

915
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:34,353
"Speak."

916
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:39,564
"He has my heart. He's mine."

917
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:44,238
"I love him. I've
to say this today."

918
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,365
"Govinda."

919
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,842
"Govinda."

920
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,038
"Govinda."

921
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,377
"Govinda."

922
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,917
"Govinda."

923
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,313
"Dance, dance, dance, Girdhar."

924
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:00,912
"Dance, dance, dance,
- Girdhar."

925
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,117
"Dance, dance, dance.
- Girdhar."

926
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,251
"Dance, dance, dance,
- Girdhar."

927
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:07,056
"Dance, dance, dance, Girdhar."

928
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,927
"Dance, dance, dance.
- Girdhar."

929
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,398
"Dance, dance, dance, Girdhar."

930
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,935
"Dance, dance, dance, Girdhar."

931
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:18,201
"Girdhar plays flute!" "Gopala!"

932
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:23,074
"By playing, he steals hearts.
Girdhar Nandlala."

933
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:42,554
"There wasn't a moment
that was spent without you."

934
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,030
"Without you."

935
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,230
"Your dreams are
growing in my eyes."

936
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:53,502
"My days go by because of you."

937
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:58,979
"I've become yours.
I'm lost in you."

938
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,984
"Now I've to stay in
your arms. I've to stay."

939
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:07,250
"Wherever you go, stay in my heart."

940
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:12,055
"Darling, it is because of
you that I deck myself up."

941
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:16,120
"Govinda." "Govinda."
"Govinda." "Govinda."

942
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,666
"I am Radha."

943
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,060
"Govinda."

944
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:23,263
"Govinda."

945
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,602
Will you travel all night to
cover three hundred kilometres?

946
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,142
Don't you have a brain?
- Sorry sir.

947
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,404
Babulal. Has our car come?

948
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,412
Yes, as soon as I got network,
I called them.

949
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,004
They got it.
- Yes sir.

950
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,276
Thank God. The car
came at the right moment.

951
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,283
Good that you got the car.
Go and get the luggage. - Yes.

952
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,682
One minute, brother. Madam, you too.

953
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,952
Brother Raju, there's a
bus stop called Abor..

954
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,615
...which is thirty minutes from here.

955
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,625
Every evening, a bus
leaves at five from there.

956
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:47,093
If we miss it, we'll have
to wait till the next day.

957
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,697
If you walk fast, we
can catch it. Come on.

958
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,091
That means, you'll leave us here.
- Go.

959
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,690
What are you saying?
- Should I give my life?

960
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,106
This is the grace of
God that I got saved.

961
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,106
Or else, I would've
died because of her.

962
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,169
Sorry, ma'am. Don't mind.

963
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:06,642
Poor Tom's shriek is
still echoing in my ears.

964
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,046
What are you
looking at? Get the car.

965
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,175
Nothing will happen this time.

966
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,650
Brother Raju, forgive me.

967
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,653
I'm with you.
- To see my corpse.

968
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,983
Speed up.

969
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,182
Don't leave me and go. Babulal!

970
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,451
Why are you looking like that?

971
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,456
You think he'll come back?

972
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:23,062
That lousy guy will never come back.

973
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,327
Go and get the bag or
we'll miss the bus too.

974
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,199
Babulal has become so smart!

975
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:56,561
Raju! Raju!

976
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,367
Help!

977
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:09,635
Help!

978
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,769
Help!

979
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:12,638
Help!

980
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,177
Raju! Raju!

981
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,308
Get up, Raju!

982
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,316
Raju! Raju!

983
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,182
Raju!

984
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,075
When the bus was about
to leave in the evening..

985
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,210
...someone stabbed him.

986
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,685
Please help me to take
him to the hospital.

987
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:53,812
I stabbed him.

988
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:17,569
Just a second.

989
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,376
Is he the one?

990
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,785
Yes. Chatrapati Raju.

991
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:29,384
His height is six feet.

992
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:37,665
Black eyes.
- That's right.

993
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,394
There is one tooth
missing on the right.

994
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,530
Everything else is okay.

995
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:45,799
How did all this happen?

996
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,535
I stabbed him on the back.

997
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,875
It's an internal injury, sir.

998
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,475
There are no blood stains outside.

999
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,406
Okay, where is the girl?

1000
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:56,742
She's here, sir. She's with me.

1001
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:58,811
What should I do with him?

1002
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,853
Which swine stabbed me?

1003
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,533
Tell me, who stabbed me?

1004
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,669
I'll kill him only.

1005
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,349
Or else, I'll kill everyone.

1006
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,687
He ran away, sir.

1007
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,632
If you remain quiet,
I'll make this okay.

1008
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,771
You're attacking me from
behind like a lousy man?

1009
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,380
Your arms can't harm me.

1010
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,848
These are like toys for me. Got it?

1011
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,511
Hey!
- Hey, kill that swine!

1012
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,781
Yes, you'll try to kill me and
I'll just keep watching you.

1013
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,654
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1014
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:58,991
Hit the swine! Hit him.

1015
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,603
Will you extract this and hit me?
- No!

1016
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:07,733
Tell me.
- No!

1017
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:08,867
You swine!

1018
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,355
If I put this into your palm,
you'll have to eat..

1019
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,358
...with your left hand, swine!

1020
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,484
No!

1021
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,618
No!

1022
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,360
Come on, come on. This is your turn.

1023
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:38,096
You!

1024
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,840
You're their leader, right?

1025
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,443
If I kill you, all the
problems will be solved.

1026
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,910
Wait, one minute.

1027
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,041
One minute. Come on.

1028
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,439
Hey!

1029
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,910
Did it hurt? I got hurt too.

1030
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:53,779
Got it?

1031
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:55,454
You don't have the guts
to attack from the front.

1032
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,718
You attacked from behind?

1033
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,517
Here you are.
- No!

1034
01:09:58,627 --> 01:09:59,651
I am not like you!

1035
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,739
Hey, wait. Swine!

1036
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:20,409
Where are you running?

1037
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,609
Swine!

1038
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:45,767
Trying to run away!

1039
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,642
'You can hear his voice.'

1040
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,856
'The five ghosts will
shout in a loud tone.'

1041
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,993
'The rains will
welcome him on this earth.'

1042
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,725
Hail Lord Shiva!

1043
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,798
'The earth here will
dance aggressively.'

1044
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:20,540
'Even the smallest sound he
makes will echo all over.'

1045
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,807
'The one you want to see
will come to you on your own.'

1046
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:41,495
'The sky will welcome
the one you want to see.'

1047
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,699
'The fire will dance
aggressively if he's angry.'

1048
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,895
Fire! Fire!

1049
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:51,836
I want fire!

1050
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,837
I want fire!

1051
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,530
'Your forehead will
have a stain of blood..'

1052
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:23,866
'..when he touches you.'

1053
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,541
'Even death is scared of him.
Your strength will..'

1054
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,008
'..increase when he touches you.'

1055
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,543
'Small kids smile on seeing him.
Even small huts become..'

1056
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,741
'..palaces when he touches.'

1057
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,878
'You wanted to see him.
You saw him.'

1058
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,551
Sir, save me. Sir, save me.

1059
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:46,287
Forgive me, sir. Forgive me.

1060
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:48,756
Save me first.

1061
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:53,825
Sir!

1062
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,094
Sir!

1063
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,864
He's come.
- He's come.

1064
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,661
He's come.
- He's come.

1065
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,172
Hail the lord!

1066
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,304
Hail the lord!
- Hail the lord!

1067
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,457
Have you gone blind?
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1068
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,793
Where are we?
- Pali.

1069
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,269
What?
- Andhra Pradesh.

1070
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,136
Tell me, didn't you
get any hospital in..

1071
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,264
...Rajasthan?

1072
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,403
You and your driving!

1073
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:50,472
You never use the brakes.

1074
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,010
It seems there's no gear
other than the first one.

1075
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,139
Tell me.
- Yes.

1076
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:56,207
What kind of a village is this?

1077
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,748
What is it?
- Everyone in this village..

1078
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,345
...thinks you're God.

1079
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,083
What?
- God!

1080
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,215
Me?

1081
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,816
You should've told the taxi driver.

1082
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,759
But he said that Sri Krishna was..

1083
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,093
...Arjun's driver.
- Who said that?

1084
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,830
Hail the lord!
- Hail the lord!

1085
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:12,958
Greetings.
- Yes.

1086
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,496
Have you started
the standing program?

1087
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:15,961
Very nice! Very nice!

1088
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:17,766
Is he the one?

1089
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,501
Why did you tell these
people that I am God?

1090
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,434
Not an ordinary one.

1091
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,175
You're that God who will protect..

1092
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:25,439
...five hundred thirty four people.

1093
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,310
I've come here to protect
five hundred thirty four people?

1094
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,040
Is there a problem if
there are thirty five?

1095
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,448
Do you know what you've told them?

1096
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,787
Goddess said that you'll come here..

1097
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,118
...with fire and water.

1098
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,780
Actually I came here
in an injured state.

1099
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:37,916
I'll leave as soon as I am cured.

1100
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,926
Master! Choose a name for my kid.

1101
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,122
Cheechu!

1102
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,867
Very nice. Cheechu.
- Cheechu!

1103
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,259
Cheechu!
- Cheechu!

1104
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,394
Cheechu!
- Cheechu!

1105
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:51,472
But this is not a name. I said
it without a reason. - Cheechu!

1106
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,137
He'll abuse me when he grows up.
- Cheechu! - Cheechu!

1107
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,265
Quiet!

1108
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,209
God! Everyone's gone mad!

1109
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,336
You're calling me God?

1110
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,005
I'm not God. Got it?

1111
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,275
You're God!

1112
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,541
Keep your volume low.

1113
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:05,214
Will you hit me if I disagree?

1114
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,480
You don't know.

1115
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,353
Everything that God
says has to happen.

1116
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,822
For example, will these
flowers shower on us..

1117
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,361
...If I ask them to?

1118
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,237
The gust of the wind
is a little too strong!

1119
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,102
The breeze is flowing since morning.

1120
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,569
The flowers have bloomed now.

1121
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,242
Yes. You and your logic!

1122
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,842
Will water flow from
Shirdi's Sai's foot..

1123
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,576
...If I say so?

1124
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,054
That girl is doing it.

1125
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,526
But the fall is that side.

1126
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,057
He's irritating me.

1127
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,264
I'll use another trick to test him.

1128
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:01,866
That wall will fall
down immediately..

1129
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,535
...If I am God indeed.

1130
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,606
Hey, where are you going?

1131
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:09,877
Hail the Lord!

1132
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,543
Hey!

1133
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,025
What is this?

1134
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,159
I asked for the wall
to break down and..

1135
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:29,294
...not to be broken down.

1136
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,031
Flowers have showered from the tree.

1137
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:33,566
Water flowed from the
little girl's hands.

1138
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,170
Sidha could break this stony wall.

1139
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,043
Everything that you
think of will happen.

1140
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:42,242
Your smile is a blessing.

1141
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,908
Your anger is a curse.

1142
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,983
Your words are prophecies.

1143
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:51,449
It's a dark night. I
have taken permission from..

1144
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,584
...teacher Gokul.

1145
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:53,922
North, South, east and west.

1146
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:55,053
I searched in all directions.

1147
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,528
I worshipped with love.
I had no other work.

1148
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,929
I bent my head and
worshipped the master.

1149
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:01,127
My mind and spirit were restless.
Where will I get God?

1150
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,260
I looked for Him in
three worlds and..

1151
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,394
...fourteen Godly destinations.

1152
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:04,529
I didn't get him here or there.

1153
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:05,936
My inner mind was in a whirl.

1154
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,599
It was God's miracle.
I got to see Him.

1155
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:08,937
My life is successful.

1156
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,068
Hail the Lord!

1157
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,202
Hail the Lord!

1158
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,337
Hail the Lord!

1159
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:13,471
Hail the Lord!

1160
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:14,606
Hail the Lord!

1161
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:15,944
Hail the Lord!

1162
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,416
Hail the Lord!

1163
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,952
Hail the Lord!
- Hail the Lord! Hail!

1164
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,953
"Hail the anger of the Lord."

1165
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,029
"Hail the Lord's voice."

1166
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:59,585
"Lord Shiva is the ultimate saint."

1167
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:04,131
"Goddess Durga's husband.
He stays in Kailash."

1168
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,201
"You're an incarnation of Shiva."

1169
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:13,070
"You help everyone."

1170
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,410
"You will eliminate our troubles."

1171
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,207
"You'll help the Sun
of our happiness rise."

1172
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,078
"You'll turn the
sunshine into shade."

1173
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:26,621
"You will have to
make this promise."

1174
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:33,494
"You protect us forever.
Keep us from troubles."

1175
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,563
"Remove all our obstacles."

1176
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:42,228
"There's no other
support that we have."

1177
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,563
"Lord Shiva. Play drums."

1178
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,507
"Light new candles of happiness."

1179
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,374
"Earth and sky are moving."

1180
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:57,042
"When you use the
potion of your love."

1181
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:05,126
"That's why the world
calls you innocent."

1182
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,391
"Hail the Lord Shiva."

1183
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:11,465
"Hail the Lord Shiva."

1184
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,056
""Hail the Lord Shiva.
Sing, Sing, Sing."

1185
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,068
"Hail the Lord Shiva."

1186
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:19,072
"Sing along, Shiva, Shiva, Shambhu."

1187
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:22,666
"Hail the Lord!"

1188
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:25,678
"Heal the world is all we pray."

1189
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,079
"Save our lives and
take our pain away."

1190
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,084
"Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1191
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:34,553
"Sing along! Shiva!
Shiva! Shambhu on his way!"

1192
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:55,235
"Lord Shiva is the ultimate saint."

1193
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:59,245
"Goddess Durga's husband.
He stays in Kailash."

1194
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:03,317
"You're an incarnation of Shiva."

1195
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:08,446
"You help everyone."

1196
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:16,593
Hail the Lord!

1197
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:21,793
Careful!

1198
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,129
Doctor, please have
a look at this kid.

1199
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,606
What is it?
- She was fine till yesterday.

1200
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,607
I don't know what happened suddenly.

1201
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:31,270
What did you feed
her in the morning?

1202
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,403
Goulash, sir.
- At night?

1203
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:33,538
Goulash.

1204
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:34,672
That's the reason she is unwell.

1205
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,478
Feed her fruits
and green vegetables.

1206
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:37,608
Getting all this is very difficult.

1207
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,152
So why did you
give birth to the kid?

1208
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:40,278
Hey, Changrez.
- Sir.

1209
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,155
Come here. Check her
fever and blood pressure too.

1210
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:44,282
Yes.
- Stethoscope.

1211
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,416
How will you check?

1212
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,221
Send the blood sample to the
laboratory quickly. - Okay, sir.

1213
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,559
'Let them do anything.
The kid can't be saved.'

1214
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,158
'She will die suddenly.'

1215
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,567
'There will be boils on her body.'

1216
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,763
'And her eyes will turn red.'

1217
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,570
'After that, her
relatives will mourn her death.'

1218
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,768
'They will bury her in the
burial ground on the North.'

1219
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:39,737
Where have you come from?

1220
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,338
From the medical camp at Palegaon.

1221
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,481
Send him to Tony's office.

1222
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,301
We'll have to talk to the
dean to stop the camp, dad.

1223
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,240
The dean's assistant is okay.

1224
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,315
But the dean is stuck in rules, dad.

1225
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,651
Okay. Call up Govardhan.

1226
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:20,385
Place twenty men to cover up.

1227
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,655
And no violence. I
want it to be clean.

1228
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,919
This news shouldn't be
published in the newspaper.

1229
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:27,518
There should be no
transaction from our account.

1230
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:28,653
Our men shouldn't talk to
anyone and none of our..

1231
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:30,458
...cars should go there.

1232
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:35,664
There should be no use
of fax, telex or email.

1233
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,267
You talk to the dean once, dad.

1234
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:39,738
If it doesn't help,
talk to Govardhan.

1235
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,341
Didn't you read the
morning newspaper?

1236
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:43,937
The dean died due to
heart attack yesterday.

1237
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:45,273
He's no more.

1238
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:04,755
Henceforth, the assistant
dean's signature will be okay.

1239
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,357
Just go ahead.

1240
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,365
There is a letter.

1241
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:17,369
What? We'll have to do
away with the medical camp.

1242
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,374
They will create a ruckus.
- They'll handle it.

1243
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,516
How much time will it take?

1244
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,723
It takes one hour
to put up the tent.

1245
01:25:33,828 --> 01:25:35,921
Only fifteen minutes will
be enough to take it out.

1246
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,858
Sir, we'll have to give
medicines to eight patients tomorrow.

1247
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,868
Pack up the equipments
and load them in the car.

1248
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,733
Why, sir?
- It's the dean's order.

1249
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,872
Don't worry. Doctor!

1250
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:47,533
Have a look at this kid.

1251
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,412
Listen, madam.
There's no need to worry.

1252
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,483
This kid is dead.
- What?

1253
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:58,611
Why are you looking at me like that?

1254
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,551
The life that she had
was more than enough.

1255
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:03,824
Everyone who is born has to die.

1256
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:06,754
She has lived for ten years.
That is good enough.

1257
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:07,952
Last month..

1258
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:09,620
How many people died last month?
- 25.

1259
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:11,358
Yes. 25 people died.

1260
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,433
With her, the number
has gone up to 26.

1261
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:14,896
What is the use of saline now?

1262
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:16,563
I'll remove it.

1263
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:25,838
Hey, let's go quickly.

1264
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,384
Plants are drying up.

1265
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,524
And the poor kids are dying.

1266
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,532
Even the tears have dried
up after so much of crying.

1267
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,865
No, Veera. Don't cry.

1268
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:55,540
Tell Veera to stop crying!

1269
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:01,745
Master! Look at what has happened!

1270
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,825
Have you planned
to settle down here?

1271
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:18,956
Come on. Quickly get
on moving from here.

1272
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:21,560
These faces are irritating me.

1273
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,044
Hey!

1274
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,458
If you put one inch of bandage,
one gram of..

1275
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:50,998
...cotton or even one drop
of spirit on him, I'll..

1276
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,524
...kill all of you.

1277
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:00,465
You're trying to flee with all your
luggage by calling her an insect..

1278
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:02,941
...and extracting
the saline from her?

1279
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,476
Where will you go?

1280
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:07,013
Go. Go wherever you want to. Swine!

1281
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:11,883
Hail the Lord!

1282
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:17,557
Hey! Who are you?
- Chatrapati Raju.

1283
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:23,097
What? - Hardev Chatrapti Raju!
Freedom fighter.

1284
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,566
He's very famous.

1285
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,629
My grandpa likes him a lot.
So he named me after him.

1286
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:33,230
You didn't like it?

1287
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:35,032
Tell me.

1288
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,641
Why does everyone have
a problem with my name?

1289
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:38,769
Tell me.

1290
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:30,755
Hey!

1291
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,768
Dance in anger,
master! The angry dance!

1292
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,170
Create uproar!

1293
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,040
Uproar, master! Hail the Lord!

1294
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:51,978
Dance in anger,
master! The angry dance!

1295
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:16,936
Dance in anger, master!

1296
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:18,875
You swine!

1297
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:24,679
Dance in anger,
master! The angry dance!

1298
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:27,016
Become the ultimate end, master!

1299
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:30,022
Ujjain's ultimate end, master!

1300
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:52,111
Why did you stop? Shout!

1301
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:54,705
What do you eat?

1302
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:56,177
Where do you get so
much of strength from?

1303
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:58,651
Your shout made me
forget who I am hitting..

1304
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:01,119
...and why I am hitting him.

1305
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,850
A second later, I
would've cut his head off.

1306
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,657
God!

1307
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,729
Now I understood the matter.

1308
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:17,197
All of you will make
me believe I am great.

1309
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:19,736
And I'll kill all of
them and go to jail.

1310
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,736
And you'll worship me?

1311
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:23,206
He's young. He doesn't know.

1312
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,801
You're old enough. Where
is your sense? Tell me.

1313
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:26,140
Do you even know who he is?

1314
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,074
Sorry, brother.

1315
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:31,208
Did I chop off your finger?

1316
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,687
If I am God according
to you, don't ever..

1317
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,020
...tell me to kill anyone.

1318
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:40,087
This kid is dead.

1319
01:31:44,832 --> 01:31:46,891
You must ask me to
give life back to her.

1320
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:55,967
Hail the Lord!

1321
01:31:56,944 --> 01:31:58,775
"Hail the Lord!"

1322
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,246
"Hail the Lord!"

1323
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,783
"Hail the Lord!"

1324
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:27,137
"Hail the Lord!"

1325
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:30,074
"Heal the world is all we pray."

1326
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:33,169
"Save our lives and
take our pain away."

1327
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:35,340
"Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1328
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:37,747
"Sing along! Shiva! Shiva! Shambhu!"

1329
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:41,811
"Hail the Lord!"

1330
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:44,483
"Heal the world is all we pray."

1331
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:48,284
"Save our lives and
take our pain away."

1332
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,863
"Hail! Hail! Hail!"

1333
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:53,161
"Sing along! Shiva!
Shiva! Shambhu on his way!"

1334
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,500
Raju. Do you really have
inexplicable strengths?

1335
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,830
Quiet! Have you gone mad?

1336
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,174
I am not Shirdi's Sai to
give life back to the dead kid.

1337
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:05,038
That kid was unconscious.

1338
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:06,371
She woke up on my touch.

1339
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:11,315
Everybody is
irritating me by calling me God.

1340
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:13,116
They've gone mad!

1341
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:17,991
If this continues, this
village will become like Puttaparti.

1342
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:20,122
They'll worship me
with flowers and fruits.

1343
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:24,321
I'm scared, Sumo.

1344
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,132
So what should we do now, Raju?

1345
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:38,468
What will they think?

1346
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:39,807
They, right?

1347
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:43,415
They had elevated my
position by calling me God.

1348
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,814
They must be abusing
me after knowing..

1349
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,013
...that God has disappeared suddenly.

1350
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:49,880
Should we go back?

1351
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,482
They'll build a temple.

1352
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,223
Are you feeling cold?

1353
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:01,891
You should take care of yourself.

1354
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,834
You should carry a
shawl or stole while..

1355
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,166
...travelling in a lorry.

1356
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:07,240
The breeze is cold.
There's dew on top of it.

1357
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:10,037
You'll fall sick. You're not a kid.

1358
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:12,573
You should be careful.

1359
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:06,490
What's this, darling?

1360
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:09,159
What were you doing?

1361
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,996
Dust..
- Yes, dust.

1362
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:15,299
Removing..
- Removing it?

1363
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:18,401
You should've blown air out.
Why were you moaning?

1364
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,904
Okay, you do all this?

1365
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:24,383
Oh my God! I am dead!

1366
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:25,917
Brahmanad Swamy said
that the world is changing.

1367
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:28,250
Did he mean this?

1368
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,319
Girls will titillate guys.

1369
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,048
Yes? Very good!

1370
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:35,589
Actually you left it at
moaning while you were in this mood.

1371
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:39,262
If you were angry, you've
pelted stones at me, right?

1372
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:40,924
How would I know
which mood you are in..

1373
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:43,196
...when you don't know it yourself?

1374
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:46,273
Hey, I'm talking here
and you're looking away?

1375
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:47,397
Look into my eyes.

1376
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:49,201
What is your intention?

1377
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,340
I was sleeping here
like an honest kid.

1378
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,012
What was your
intention of coming close?

1379
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:54,274
What did you want to do?

1380
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:55,405
What did you..

1381
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:58,548
I came with this intention.

1382
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:03,022
Since I am a good girl,
I stopped myself here.

1383
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:33,579
"Sunday. Monday.
Etcetera. Every day."

1384
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:34,984
"Have fun! Have fun!"

1385
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,387
"Enjoy your today, friend!"

1386
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:41,188
"Sunday. Monday.
Etcetera. Every day."

1387
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:42,990
"Have fun! Have fun!"

1388
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:45,065
"Enjoy your today, friend!"

1389
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:48,998
"Let's love each other openly."

1390
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:52,595
"Let's shout out today."

1391
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,601
"Let's love each other openly."

1392
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:00,612
"Let's shout out today."

1393
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:20,500
"The evening of fun has arrived."

1394
01:37:21,068 --> 01:37:24,504
"There is rum for friends."

1395
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:30,032
"Let's dance in this situation."

1396
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:34,512
"This young ambience is
making me intoxicated."

1397
01:37:34,615 --> 01:37:38,312
"How can sense
prevail in this condition?"

1398
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:43,580
"Come on. You and
I should have fun."

1399
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:47,388
"Let's love each other openly."

1400
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:51,463
"Let's shout out today."

1401
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:03,270
"Sunday. Monday.
Etcetera. Every day."

1402
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,072
"Have fun! Have fun!"

1403
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,079
"Enjoy your today, friend!"

1404
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:38,771
"We get such a night very rarely."

1405
01:38:39,146 --> 01:38:42,775
"We don't get friends everyday."

1406
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:48,178
"So why shouldn't we have fun?"

1407
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:52,385
"Who knows what
will happen tomorrow?"

1408
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:56,594
"These moments of happiness,
friend."

1409
01:38:56,697 --> 01:39:01,725
"Why shouldn't we
do what we want to?"

1410
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:03,735
"Give me. Give me more."

1411
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:05,532
"Give me, give me more."

1412
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,206
"Give me. Give me."

1413
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:09,333
"Give me more."

1414
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:21,414
"Sunday. Monday.
Etcetera. Every day."

1415
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:23,217
"Have fun! Have fun!"

1416
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:25,155
"Enjoy your today, friend!"

1417
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:29,161
"Sunday. Monday.
Etcetera. Every day."

1418
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:30,753
"Have fun! Have fun!"

1419
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:33,162
"Enjoy your today, friend!"

1420
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,238
Call Durga Prasad.

1421
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,565
Sir, call for you.

1422
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:43,633
Hello?

1423
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,177
I've heard that your daughter is..

1424
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:46,439
...roaming around with a taxi driver.

1425
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:48,705
Where?

1426
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,249
Don't ask me where.

1427
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:51,781
Just think about
what needs to be done.

1428
01:39:52,219 --> 01:39:53,777
Make sure that our names
aren't published in the papers.

1429
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:57,382
Get my daughter-in-law
from that taxi driver.

1430
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:03,525
I'll forget that your daughter
was roaming around with someone.

1431
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:32,282
Dad.

1432
01:40:34,595 --> 01:40:36,495
Hey! Kill him and
bring the girl here.

1433
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:37,621
What did you say?

1434
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:39,562
I asked them to kill you and
to bring my daughter here.

1435
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,234
Why do you want to
kill me to fetch her?

1436
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:43,360
Take her if you want.

1437
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:45,629
Tell me, what sort of car
ever runs without petrol?

1438
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,636
Can a train run without the tracks?

1439
01:40:47,741 --> 01:40:49,231
There must be bloodshed.

1440
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:51,501
These days people yearn for rains.

1441
01:40:51,612 --> 01:40:52,840
And you want bloodshed.

1442
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:54,709
Hey! He is scared out of his pants.

1443
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:57,841
I swear. Neither am I scared
of him nor do I love this girl.

1444
01:40:58,285 --> 01:40:59,309
You've taken her
around all over Rajasthan..

1445
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,444
...assuming that
she is a little girl.

1446
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,782
I know.

1447
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:04,790
A little girl. You can
see her figure, right?

1448
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:07,658
You'll commit suicide if you
hear what I did to her last night.

1449
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:11,594
He is talking like that. And
you are standing doing nothing?

1450
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:12,923
I am having tea.

1451
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,927
Darn your tea.

1452
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:38,682
What is this?

1453
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:39,884
One blow and..

1454
01:41:40,327 --> 01:41:41,760
The punch was solid, sir.
- So..

1455
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:43,420
I had been to the doctor
day before yesterday..

1456
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:44,963
...to get my teeth out.

1457
01:41:45,065 --> 01:41:47,431
The doctor asked me
to come after a week.

1458
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:52,296
But he took it out right now. Here.
- Hey..

1459
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:54,840
I guess he has come down to earth
after getting his teeth broken.

1460
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:56,307
I took out the teeth
without making him unconscious.

1461
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,502
It must have hurt him a lot.

1462
01:41:57,744 --> 01:41:59,644
He'll be fine if he goes
home and rests for two days.

1463
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:01,446
Rest assured.

1464
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:02,981
I have hired goons from Hardoi.

1465
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:04,641
Ask him to break everyone's teeth.

1466
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:06,776
By the way, he has hit only one.

1467
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:08,320
There are a lot many.

1468
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:09,787
I too am not happy beating just one.

1469
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:10,982
I'll beat up the entire crowd.

1470
01:43:13,887 --> 01:43:15,582
You were with them, right?
- No sir.

1471
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:16,780
What are you doing here?

1472
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:18,380
I work here.
- You are working.

1473
01:43:21,762 --> 01:43:23,059
How much does a litre petrol cost?
- Sir.

1474
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:24,653
How much does a litre petrol cost?

1475
01:43:25,566 --> 01:43:26,726
You look like a thief.

1476
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:28,865
And you say that you work here.
- Oh God!

1477
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:32,061
Get lost.

1478
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,679
Sir, don't beat me
up in front of my son.

1479
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:40,804
Why have you brought your son?

1480
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:42,005
There is no one at home.

1481
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:43,810
That's why I've got him with me.

1482
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:46,013
Such a deed in front of your son.

1483
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:48,019
I don't have money
even for the school fees.

1484
01:43:48,121 --> 01:43:50,021
How much has he said that
he'll give you? - 3,000.

1485
01:43:50,457 --> 01:43:52,084
3,000?
- 4,000. Sir.

1486
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:54,023
Sir, he has kept the 1,000
rupees with him as commission.

1487
01:43:54,127 --> 01:43:55,754
You usurp the kid's fees.

1488
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:58,422
Aren't you ashamed?
- Sir. Sir, he gave me Rs. 5000.

1489
01:43:58,532 --> 01:44:00,500
Banwari gave me Rs.4000.
And took Rs.1000.

1490
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,699
Darn you!

1491
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:08,900
You rob poor people off
their money and live off it.

1492
01:44:09,009 --> 01:44:10,033
This is no living. You dogs!

1493
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:11,705
Sir, there is no one there.

1494
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:12,904
Will he keep quiet
if there is someone?

1495
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,504
You are the one who is rich.

1496
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:17,516
What coat, shirt, pant and tie!

1497
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:19,776
You look like a thief in
these clothes. Useless.

1498
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:21,854
I should've abused you.
Did I? No. Right?

1499
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:23,455
You abused me by scolding me.

1500
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:24,581
Now why do I need respect?

1501
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:25,715
I give it very rarely.

1502
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:26,850
Take it when I am giving it?
- What's that?

1503
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:27,984
Respect.

1504
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:29,858
Are you about to give
something else apart from respect?

1505
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,054
You can take your girl away.

1506
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:33,064
Raju, what are you saying?
- I am right.

1507
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,929
Your father stabbed in the back
because I went around with you.

1508
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:36,059
It is still hurting.

1509
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:37,932
So much of violence for so
little love is not right.

1510
01:44:38,038 --> 01:44:39,471
I beg of you. Go
away with your father.

1511
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:40,597
Go away.

1512
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,538
Go sit in the car. Go
sit in the car, dear.

1513
01:44:43,777 --> 01:44:44,869
One strange bodyguard.

1514
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:46,803
What are you staring at?

1515
01:44:47,514 --> 01:44:49,948
I'll strangle you if ever you
come in front of me wearing a tie.

1516
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,142
Goodbye.

1517
01:44:52,986 --> 01:44:57,685
I hate you. Hate you, Raju.

1518
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:11,100
All the doctors are leaving.

1519
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:13,630
They're taking the
medicines with them.

1520
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:16,706
And Swami too has left us.

1521
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:22,105
But God hasn't left us.

1522
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:26,580
He is away for something important.

1523
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:30,121
He is thinking about us.

1524
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:32,047
He'll certainly do this task.

1525
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,185
He will come back.

1526
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:39,726
Okay. So you are back.

1527
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:41,524
I would've put out an
advertisement in the newspaper..

1528
01:45:41,635 --> 01:45:42,932
...If you had come today.

1529
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:44,060
You should have.

1530
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,195
There were no telephone lines there.

1531
01:45:45,305 --> 01:45:46,533
You could've written a letter.

1532
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,800
Wasn't there ink in the pen?

1533
01:45:47,908 --> 01:45:49,000
Old habits don't die easy.

1534
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:50,133
What happened?
- Nothing.

1535
01:45:50,243 --> 01:45:52,609
I know you don't have brains.

1536
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:54,144
Alright. Come in.

1537
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:57,616
Who is he?
- Gosh! When did you come?

1538
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:58,942
Don't you know?

1539
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,076
He is here for me.

1540
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,084
Now tell me.

1541
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:10,220
You are here to take
me with you, right?

1542
01:46:11,064 --> 01:46:12,622
What do you think I am?

1543
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,633
I know just three things.

1544
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:18,704
Driving a cab. Bashing
people up if they mess with me.

1545
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:19,829
And do you know the third thing.

1546
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:22,101
Getting beaten up if the
opponent is more powerful than me.

1547
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:26,170
What special quality do I
have that you all call me God?

1548
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:33,909
If we sow the seed of this
fruit a plant will grow.

1549
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:37,048
But you will find
this only to be a seed.

1550
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:41,052
But I see a plant.

1551
01:46:50,771 --> 01:46:51,863
Brother, you are still alive?

1552
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:53,803
Lay off. Don't touch. I'll kill you.

1553
01:46:54,174 --> 01:46:55,664
You ditched me.

1554
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:56,868
I'm really scared
of getting a tattoo.

1555
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:58,137
You think I enjoy it.

1556
01:46:58,311 --> 01:47:01,747
I lost all my fruits
because of your sweetheart.

1557
01:47:01,848 --> 01:47:05,284
I lost my watermelon. I lost
my car. And my job as well.

1558
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:09,218
They ruined me by
tattooing me on my private parts.

1559
01:47:09,856 --> 01:47:12,154
I left a week ago. And
I am reaching today.

1560
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:16,019
Who is he?

1561
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:17,289
Sitting here like a statue.

1562
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:21,691
He thinks I am God.
- God?

1563
01:47:22,068 --> 01:47:24,764
If you are God, who
would the devil be?

1564
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:25,963
I did not understand that either.

1565
01:47:26,339 --> 01:47:27,897
Shall we have a
test to understand it?

1566
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,114
Give me Rs.10.
- What?

1567
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:39,715
I need Rs.10. Will you give it?

1568
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,180
You've started early morning.

1569
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:43,654
Aren't you ashamed of
begging in jeans and shirt?

1570
01:47:43,757 --> 01:47:45,725
He is asking Rs.10 as if I
had borrowed it from him.

1571
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:47,658
Good Lord!

1572
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:03,672
Will you give me Rs.10?

1573
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:10,075
Keep the change for Rs.100.

1574
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:14,143
Adorations to Lord Shiva!

1575
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:15,278
Adorations to Lord Shiva!

1576
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:16,685
Adorations to Lord Shiva!

1577
01:48:20,193 --> 01:48:21,683
Why did you need to ask for Rs.10..

1578
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:24,093
...from the bike rider
although we had money?

1579
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:28,030
If you ask for Rs.10 from the one
with a car, he gives you Rs.100.

1580
01:48:28,134 --> 01:48:29,362
I did not get it.

1581
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:32,102
No one gives money to
others just like that.

1582
01:48:33,273 --> 01:48:35,707
The second time I
did not ask for myself.

1583
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:39,040
I thought I would get some
milk for this boy if I get money.

1584
01:48:40,146 --> 01:48:41,170
He gave me Rs.100.

1585
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:44,112
Brother, now I know
the definition of God.

1586
01:48:44,417 --> 01:48:45,714
He is not up there somewhere.

1587
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:47,776
He is here within you and me.

1588
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:52,385
If someone needs help,
he jumps to his aide.

1589
01:48:53,426 --> 01:48:55,917
You'll get millions, not just 100.

1590
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:57,189
Things will happen as
per what you had imagined.

1591
01:49:00,233 --> 01:49:05,193
Siddha, look your
village means nothing to me.

1592
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:07,806
But I'll still help you.

1593
01:49:09,175 --> 01:49:11,075
You saw a plant in the seed.

1594
01:49:12,045 --> 01:49:13,876
But I saw the God within me.

1595
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:15,805
I'll show you. Come on.

1596
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:20,409
Brother, where are you going?

1597
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:22,081
Brother, stop.

1598
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:23,413
Say something.

1599
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:24,948
Where are you going, brother?

1600
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,154
Thank God.

1601
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,754
We would've died if we
had gone any further.

1602
01:49:32,866 --> 01:49:34,094
We would've died even if we had not.

1603
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,895
It would've been better if you had
shut your mouth in this situation.

1604
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:42,231
Speak up, brother.

1605
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:46,373
Where are you going?
Tell me, brother.

1606
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,847
He'll tell us where we
have to go. Get him. - Whom?

1607
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:05,263
Hey! Who are you?
- God.

1608
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:06,456
What did you say?

1609
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:14,136
Didn't you hear or are you
asking out of ignorance?

1610
01:50:14,374 --> 01:50:15,466
I am asking out of ignorance.

1611
01:50:15,842 --> 01:50:17,400
It's better if you don't
understand certain things.

1612
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:18,807
So what do I do, sir?

1613
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:22,471
You came into this world alone,
and you'll die alone.

1614
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:24,413
Can't you jog alone?
- Yes.

1615
01:50:29,322 --> 01:50:31,290
Friend, see you
tomorrow morning for jogging.

1616
01:50:50,076 --> 01:50:51,976
You beat me whenever you
feel like. Who are you?

1617
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:55,837
Brother, whose single
blow drives you nuts.

1618
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:57,573
I am the one.

1619
01:50:58,418 --> 01:50:59,851
I have heard this
dialogue somewhere.

1620
01:51:00,353 --> 01:51:01,513
Not drives your nuts, brother.

1621
01:51:01,621 --> 01:51:02,986
But block your mind.

1622
01:51:03,289 --> 01:51:04,381
That's an old dialogue.

1623
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:05,983
This is absolutely new.

1624
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:07,855
But this dialogue came from there.

1625
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:09,928
But is he going to like the
beating he is going to get.

1626
01:51:10,897 --> 01:51:12,524
Why did you wrap up the
medical camp from there?

1627
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:13,860
Are you going to beat the postman..

1628
01:51:13,967 --> 01:51:14,991
...If the telegram has bad news?

1629
01:51:15,101 --> 01:51:16,125
I don't need this logic.

1630
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:17,931
I am asking you something. And
you are replying something else.

1631
01:51:18,038 --> 01:51:19,266
The dean wrapped
up the medical camp.

1632
01:51:19,372 --> 01:51:20,464
I am just the postman.

1633
01:51:20,573 --> 01:51:21,870
You won't speak like that.

1634
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:23,199
I'll make you talk.

1635
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:24,333
I'll cut your legs.
And you'll start talking.

1636
01:51:24,444 --> 01:51:26,071
Leave me. Leave me. Don't beat me.

1637
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:27,407
I'm telling the truth.
I'm telling the truth.

1638
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:28,538
What he say is true, sir?

1639
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:29,945
I don't think so.

1640
01:51:39,325 --> 01:51:40,349
What are you doing?

1641
01:51:41,461 --> 01:51:43,486
Listen brother Tom. Mix
in some jaggery and eat.

1642
01:51:44,931 --> 01:51:46,023
And catch the dean.

1643
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:47,957
Don't consider him an ordinary man.

1644
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:49,160
He is the head of the college.

1645
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:50,361
It is very tough to catch him.

1646
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:51,494
I wonder if there
will be tight security.

1647
01:51:51,604 --> 01:51:54,095
Will there be security or not?
- I don't know.

1648
01:51:57,143 --> 01:51:58,371
I told you there will be security.

1649
01:51:58,545 --> 01:51:59,978
We'll have to go in, brother.

1650
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:04,448
Milkman, newspaper guy,
servant, waterman, plumber, driver.

1651
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:06,309
Whom do we catch?

1652
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:13,987
Lord, you are no human, but God.

1653
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:18,453
Lord, what you think of will happen.

1654
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,938
Great. Why should we go in?

1655
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:29,132
Won't he come out?

1656
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:46,415
Listen.
- Yes.

1657
01:52:46,526 --> 01:52:49,359
Are you dean Venkat Sharma?
- Yes. What do you want?

1658
01:52:52,532 --> 01:52:54,159
Don't question God?

1659
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:56,157
Just follow his orders.

1660
01:53:01,141 --> 01:53:03,166
Hey! What's going on?

1661
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:04,368
He is kidnapping in front of us.

1662
01:53:04,477 --> 01:53:05,501
Come on, call up the police.

1663
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,377
Beautiful. Fantastic. Marvellous.

1664
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:11,174
I have made 25 serials so far.

1665
01:53:11,417 --> 01:53:14,113
But I have never watched an
international movie like this.

1666
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,518
Someone here is going to
call up the police I guess.

1667
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:17,647
You, right?

1668
01:53:18,024 --> 01:53:19,184
You were so natural.

1669
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:24,127
Encourage the artist,
folks. Oh. Hello.

1670
01:53:25,031 --> 01:53:26,055
Henu is in the car, right? Alright.

1671
01:53:26,232 --> 01:53:27,665
Lock the door and stay away.

1672
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:29,998
Sir.
- What, brother?

1673
01:53:30,103 --> 01:53:33,072
What is this serial called? - Thali
mein Khopdi (brain on the plate).

1674
01:53:33,173 --> 01:53:34,538
What do you mean?
- You did not understand?

1675
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:38,010
The bull's brain on the steel plate.

1676
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:39,535
Phew!

1677
01:53:48,521 --> 01:53:49,681
Don't worry.

1678
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:52,021
He'll break the
coconut with that rod.

1679
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:53,615
Mix in some jaggery and feed us.

1680
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:55,084
Darn you!

1681
01:53:55,195 --> 01:53:56,219
Why are you hitting me?

1682
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:59,027
This is not temple that you
can have coconut every day.

1683
01:53:59,132 --> 01:54:01,100
You'll get something
else for lunch today. Apple.

1684
01:54:01,201 --> 01:54:02,566
Apple a day keeps the doctor away.

1685
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:05,103
I am also a doctor.
Feed me an apple.

1686
01:54:05,405 --> 01:54:07,032
You want me to feed you
an apple and leave? - Yes.

1687
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:08,164
Should I kill you feeding a banana?

1688
01:54:08,274 --> 01:54:09,502
Darn you! Moron!

1689
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:10,633
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

1690
01:54:10,743 --> 01:54:12,233
Rogue, no fake voices here.

1691
01:54:12,345 --> 01:54:13,642
If you do so, I'll finish you off.

1692
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:16,105
Why have we got him here?

1693
01:54:16,282 --> 01:54:17,306
What do I know?

1694
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:18,441
He told me to move it.

1695
01:54:21,754 --> 01:54:25,246
Dean, why did you send the
letter to move the medical camp?

1696
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:28,054
I did not. Actually G.K had sent it.

1697
01:54:28,161 --> 01:54:29,185
Who is he?

1698
01:54:29,295 --> 01:54:31,320
G.K is to India what
Bill Gates is to USA.

1699
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:33,126
What has he got to
do with this college?

1700
01:54:33,233 --> 01:54:35,463
He is the board member of
our medical college. - So?

1701
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:37,067
There is a rumour
that he had replaced..

1702
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:40,333
...the dean if he refused
from moving the medical camp.

1703
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,067
That's not a rumour. But it's true.

1704
01:54:42,175 --> 01:54:44,405
G.K's man Govardhan had
killed the previous dean.

1705
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:48,272
When I refused from signing,
he threatened me as well.

1706
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:51,407
Good Lord, we'll have
to catch him as well.

1707
01:54:52,585 --> 01:54:54,416
How many people do I catch?

1708
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:56,151
There are no chairs or ropes either.

1709
01:54:56,256 --> 01:54:58,224
We'll bring chairs and
ropes with the next guy.

1710
01:54:58,324 --> 01:54:59,348
He is really influential.

1711
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:01,689
It is not an easy job to
catch and bring him here.

1712
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:05,564
Lord is the mountain.
Don't mess with him.

1713
01:55:07,133 --> 01:55:12,161
You'll be wiped out. You'll be
destroyed. You'll be ruined.

1714
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:18,106
His expectations are
increasing by the day.

1715
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:26,175
Hello. Good morning.

1716
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:27,777
How did you get here?

1717
01:55:28,288 --> 01:55:29,380
I reached the gate in a car.

1718
01:55:29,489 --> 01:55:31,582
It was closed. That's why
I jumped over it. - Why?

1719
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:33,182
To meet G.K.

1720
01:55:33,293 --> 01:55:34,590
I have been working
here for three years.

1721
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:36,194
I myself haven't met him yet.

1722
01:55:36,296 --> 01:55:38,127
You are an ordinary secretary.
You question us?

1723
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:39,459
Do you know who he is? He is God.

1724
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:43,733
If you are God himself,
make some miracle happen.

1725
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:47,603
Brother cracks a mean joke.

1726
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:52,471
By the way, we aren't here for G.K.

1727
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:55,145
I have heard that a guy
named Govardhan works here.

1728
01:55:55,381 --> 01:55:56,814
He is a very close friend of mine.

1729
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:58,543
We'll call him out,
talk to him and leave.

1730
01:55:58,651 --> 01:55:59,675
Please.

1731
01:55:59,786 --> 01:56:01,276
It's Sunday. it's a holiday.

1732
01:56:01,387 --> 01:56:02,547
Jump over the gate and leave.

1733
01:56:02,655 --> 01:56:04,418
It's Sunday. We'll have
to jump over the gate.

1734
01:56:04,524 --> 01:56:05,684
Then you should've
told this earlier.

1735
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:07,157
Why were you asking us the details..

1736
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,557
...how and why we came here?

1737
01:56:08,661 --> 01:56:09,685
He drove me nuts.

1738
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:11,821
Let's go.

1739
01:56:11,931 --> 01:56:13,558
Don't be enemies with God.
You'll go blind.

1740
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:15,156
Not a problem.
- Leave me.

1741
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,428
He is talking trash.
- Keep quiet.

1742
01:56:16,536 --> 01:56:17,628
It's Sunday. Don't we know?

1743
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:19,565
It's Sunday as if we don't know.

1744
01:56:19,672 --> 01:56:20,764
Exactly at 12..

1745
01:56:24,477 --> 01:56:26,570
Keep talking to me.
Don't disconnect the call.

1746
01:56:27,213 --> 01:56:28,305
Get it?
- Govardhan.

1747
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:30,840
Govardhan.

1748
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:32,178
A rogue is following me.

1749
01:56:32,285 --> 01:56:33,309
You are Govardhan, right?

1750
01:56:33,419 --> 01:56:34,852
You are him, right?

1751
01:56:34,954 --> 01:56:36,182
Keep talking.

1752
01:57:08,921 --> 01:57:12,880
I'm out of breath, pal.

1753
01:57:14,727 --> 01:57:18,356
Govardhan, I can't run anymore.

1754
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,896
Why are you making me
run in the scorching heat?

1755
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:28,905
What do you eat that
you have so much energy?

1756
01:57:29,675 --> 01:57:32,644
Tell me. Are you a
human or an animal?

1757
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:35,708
Govardhan, I had
something to ask you.

1758
01:57:36,282 --> 01:57:38,443
Please stop.

1759
01:57:49,962 --> 01:57:53,329
Govardhan, are you alive or dead?

1760
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:55,801
My whole body is aching.

1761
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:57,335
Tie him securely.

1762
01:57:57,437 --> 01:57:58,529
The door is weak.

1763
01:57:59,572 --> 01:58:02,336
Govardhan made me run so much.

1764
01:58:02,442 --> 01:58:04,672
I salute his running.

1765
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:07,745
My leg is aching badly.

1766
01:58:08,514 --> 01:58:10,482
Darn! He runs well.

1767
01:58:10,716 --> 01:58:12,946
I can figure out from his
run that he is a cross breed.

1768
01:58:13,986 --> 01:58:18,355
Your body will float in the air
if water crosses into this whisky.

1769
01:58:18,458 --> 01:58:20,358
Yes. Please. Please.

1770
01:58:22,061 --> 01:58:24,427
Siddha, do you also want some?

1771
01:58:25,665 --> 01:58:26,825
He is strange.

1772
01:58:26,933 --> 01:58:28,560
You've come to know now.
I came to know long ago.

1773
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:29,961
Cheers.
- Cheers, brother.

1774
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,374
You saw him.

1775
01:58:45,818 --> 01:58:47,376
He looks like a recluse.

1776
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:50,784
And this is dean. Darn the dean.

1777
01:58:51,357 --> 01:58:52,381
Jerk!

1778
01:58:53,759 --> 01:58:55,727
You do this instead of teaching.

1779
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:02,327
Ever since I have dropped
her at the gas station..

1780
01:59:02,435 --> 01:59:04,995
...my life has been rocked.
- Really.

1781
01:59:05,438 --> 01:59:08,532
Shirt and trouser all the time.

1782
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,802
I never got to see sari or
Salwar (traditional dress).

1783
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:12,410
I've gone nuts.

1784
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:15,413
We are going to call her up.

1785
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:16,672
Don't take of fence.
- I don't want to talk to her.

1786
01:59:16,782 --> 01:59:17,806
You talk to her.

1787
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:25,955
Hello.
- Listen, it's me.

1788
01:59:26,926 --> 01:59:27,950
Why did you call?

1789
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,357
To apologize to you.

1790
01:59:29,529 --> 01:59:30,621
That's not needed.

1791
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:33,824
Listen. Listen. Don't
hang up. Please. - Why?

1792
01:59:35,601 --> 01:59:36,829
I am in a really bad shape.

1793
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:38,831
You gave me the kiss and left.

1794
01:59:38,938 --> 01:59:40,428
But my life has become miserable.

1795
01:59:40,673 --> 01:59:42,436
I can't sleep at night or
be at peace during the day.

1796
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:43,566
I am really upset.

1797
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:45,034
I wonder what I should do.

1798
01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:50,572
Listen. Listen. Are
you there? Listen.

1799
01:59:52,418 --> 01:59:53,442
How can you leave if I say so?

1800
01:59:53,886 --> 01:59:55,376
And moreover you said I hate you.

1801
01:59:56,422 --> 01:59:58,720
Your father was next
to you. What could I do?

1802
01:59:58,824 --> 01:59:59,848
I am really shy.

1803
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:01,789
Sumo, how do I
explain all this to you?

1804
02:00:03,696 --> 02:00:05,994
You are laughing.
- Idiot.

1805
02:00:07,433 --> 02:00:09,731
You really like it when
you abuse me in English.

1806
02:00:10,903 --> 02:00:13,997
Stupid.
- Abuse me all you want.

1807
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,737
Who else apart from
you will abuse me?

1808
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:17,737
You are my sweetheart, Sumo?

1809
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:20,740
You change colours
like the chameleon.

1810
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,004
I can't believe you.

1811
02:00:22,515 --> 02:00:23,539
Say it once again.

1812
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:25,406
You keep changing
the topic all the time.

1813
02:00:25,585 --> 02:00:26,745
Say the last portion.

1814
02:00:26,852 --> 02:00:28,080
I can't believe you.

1815
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:31,617
Call me by my name.
- Raju.

1816
02:00:34,594 --> 02:00:38,621
I'll be at your feet as your
pet dog if you call me like that.

1817
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:40,691
I'll talk to you later.

1818
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:42,091
What are you doing, Raju?

1819
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:44,635
What am I doing? I'm drinking.

1820
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:46,895
Shall I hang up now?

1821
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:53,512
Sumo. Her élan, her level, her
style is completely different.

1822
02:00:54,947 --> 02:00:57,507
She kissed me when
we were in the car.

1823
02:00:57,817 --> 02:00:59,648
You mean lip to lip kiss.
- Right.

1824
02:01:04,624 --> 02:01:10,859
Brother don, ever since then
the warmth of her breath..

1825
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:12,453
What has the warmth
of her breath done..

1826
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:13,589
It has driven me crazy.

1827
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:19,660
Why are you listening to our story?

1828
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:22,140
I was talking about
family and ladies matter.

1829
02:01:22,708 --> 02:01:24,073
So you should've shut
your ears, isn't it?

1830
02:01:24,176 --> 02:01:26,940
A decent man like me made
you run all over the city.

1831
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:29,545
And I kidnapped and fed
you Biryani (rice dish).

1832
02:01:29,715 --> 02:01:31,740
So don't you know that
you must shut your ears?

1833
02:01:31,851 --> 02:01:32,875
Both my hands are tied.

1834
02:01:32,985 --> 02:01:34,009
How do I shut my ears?

1835
02:01:34,987 --> 02:01:37,148
He is shouting.
- I can see.

1836
02:01:37,256 --> 02:01:38,484
He is threatening me.

1837
02:01:38,924 --> 02:01:41,620
Govardhan, you are
giving me an attitude.

1838
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:45,962
Gosh! What attitude!

1839
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:51,695
Govardhan, I have a way to
do away with your attitude.

1840
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:56,631
Why are you hitting me for
someone else's mistakes?

1841
02:01:56,742 --> 02:01:57,766
Tell me. Who made it?

1842
02:01:57,877 --> 02:01:58,901
G'K.
- What did he do?

1843
02:01:59,011 --> 02:02:00,911
He has stated a
factory with Sumita's father.

1844
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,513
And many villagers have died
after drinking..

1845
02:02:02,615 --> 02:02:04,048
...the water contaminated
by that factory.

1846
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,777
What factory?
- What do I do?

1847
02:02:05,885 --> 02:02:06,909
I am an ordinary goon.

1848
02:02:07,019 --> 02:02:08,111
What will you find
out by killing me?

1849
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:10,654
Go ask Sumita's
brother-in-law Banvari.

1850
02:02:10,756 --> 02:02:11,780
Then you'll know.

1851
02:02:11,891 --> 02:02:15,987
Man, he is not saying
anything even after all that.

1852
02:02:16,762 --> 02:02:18,127
All the intoxication is gone.

1853
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:23,066
My head is aching. Darn it.

1854
02:02:23,169 --> 02:02:24,193
Hey! What are you doing?

1855
02:02:24,303 --> 02:02:25,531
Get me a glass of
chilled water if you have.

1856
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:27,799
If he'll get a shot
for with those hands.

1857
02:02:27,907 --> 02:02:28,931
What for?

1858
02:02:29,041 --> 02:02:30,065
To drink.
- What is this?

1859
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:31,541
What are you talking about?

1860
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:32,668
Who is he?

1861
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:34,203
So the bottle is here.

1862
02:02:34,313 --> 02:02:35,678
Put your leg down. Keep it down.

1863
02:02:35,848 --> 02:02:36,872
What is all this?

1864
02:02:37,049 --> 02:02:38,949
You are here to
plunder me in broad daylight.

1865
02:02:39,051 --> 02:02:40,882
Do you know whom are you
talking you? - To whom?

1866
02:02:40,986 --> 02:02:42,544
To God.
- He is no God. He is a cab driver.

1867
02:02:42,655 --> 02:02:43,679
He turned God three days ago.

1868
02:02:43,789 --> 02:02:45,689
You are talking as if the girl
turned adult three days ago.

1869
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:47,622
You aren't aware of his powers.

1870
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:48,955
He kidnapped a man passing by.

1871
02:02:49,061 --> 02:02:50,221
No one dared to utter a word.

1872
02:02:50,329 --> 02:02:52,559
Only goons kidnap and not God.

1873
02:02:52,798 --> 02:02:53,822
Shut up.

1874
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:56,892
You know that's why
he's calling me God.

1875
02:02:57,002 --> 02:02:58,629
He doesn't know. He is an idiot.
- Yes.

1876
02:02:58,738 --> 02:02:59,830
I'll explain to him.
- Okay.

1877
02:03:01,874 --> 02:03:05,037
Brother Banvari, let me
tell you something simple.

1878
02:03:05,611 --> 02:03:09,047
You'll be enlightened
the moment you hear it.

1879
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:11,583
Then you too will consider me God.

1880
02:03:11,684 --> 02:03:12,981
Come on, make a shot for me.
- Sure.

1881
02:03:15,087 --> 02:03:16,645
What is this?
- Hand.

1882
02:03:16,756 --> 02:03:17,780
Oh God!

1883
02:03:19,692 --> 02:03:21,785
What is this?
- Hand.

1884
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:24,652
O God! - He is hitting you.
Watch your words.

1885
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:31,659
I get it. I understood. Hammer.

1886
02:03:33,639 --> 02:03:35,937
Who am I? You are God.

1887
02:03:36,175 --> 02:03:38,006
As I said. He'll understand quickly.

1888
02:03:38,177 --> 02:03:40,008
He did not
understand when he said it.

1889
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:41,941
You said it and I understood.

1890
02:03:43,182 --> 02:03:44,206
Relax and sit down.

1891
02:03:45,251 --> 02:03:48,687
Come on, sit.
- Alright.

1892
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:57,696
For now, we'll strip and talk.

1893
02:03:58,264 --> 02:04:00,698
Don't involve my wife in this.

1894
02:04:00,933 --> 02:04:03,094
You go in. Go in.
- Okay.

1895
02:04:04,003 --> 02:04:05,163
You'll have to strip completely.

1896
02:04:05,805 --> 02:04:06,897
Absolutely nothing inside.

1897
02:04:07,273 --> 02:04:08,297
Completely free.

1898
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:11,042
What business do Sumo's
father and G.K together do?

1899
02:04:11,143 --> 02:04:12,167
What do they do, sir?

1900
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:13,768
They are big people.
They do business.

1901
02:04:14,146 --> 02:04:16,774
His father Durgaprasad is God.
- Oh God!

1902
02:04:18,017 --> 02:04:19,177
He is a crook.

1903
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:21,719
He has hired me only
to hide his misdeeds.

1904
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:25,247
Where did G.K's son meet Sumo?

1905
02:04:25,691 --> 02:04:28,057
At some function.
Love at first sight.

1906
02:04:29,161 --> 02:04:30,992
He'll not get married.
He is an absolute loafer.

1907
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:32,324
He wants a different girl everyday.

1908
02:04:32,898 --> 02:04:33,922
The wife is no less.

1909
02:04:34,166 --> 02:04:36,862
She went around with a boy
in Rajasthan for three days.

1910
02:04:37,169 --> 02:04:38,659
They have been
disgraced in the society.

1911
02:04:38,771 --> 02:04:39,795
O God!

1912
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:40,929
Why are you hitting me
although I am being candid, sir?

1913
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:42,064
She was going around with me.

1914
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:46,268
Hands are right here.

1915
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:47,675
But I'm still getting hit.

1916
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:48,804
How is this possible?

1917
02:04:48,914 --> 02:04:50,142
Don't ask questions. Answer him.

1918
02:04:50,716 --> 02:04:52,684
I have small desires.

1919
02:04:53,052 --> 02:04:56,021
I want another woman without
my wife coming to know of it.

1920
02:04:56,388 --> 02:04:59,016
Throw all your desires
into the drain. Okay.

1921
02:05:00,726 --> 02:05:02,353
What factories do GK
has in Pali village?

1922
02:05:02,795 --> 02:05:04,729
Just watch this.
Hey, just come here.

1923
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:05,956
Behind the plastic glass. Yes.

1924
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:10,359
Don't worry. it's bullet-proof.

1925
02:05:11,303 --> 02:05:12,702
We have readied this plastic.

1926
02:05:12,805 --> 02:05:13,829
It's scratch-proof.

1927
02:05:14,139 --> 02:05:15,163
And look at this.

1928
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:16,832
Fireproof.

1929
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:18,907
Check it out. Test it.

1930
02:05:19,011 --> 02:05:20,842
Lara, call all the secretaries..

1931
02:05:20,946 --> 02:05:21,970
...and ask them to
stand behind the glass.

1932
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:23,878
I want to check distance.
- So sweet.

1933
02:05:23,983 --> 02:05:25,007
Made out of sugarcane.

1934
02:05:25,117 --> 02:05:26,379
This plastic has been
prepared from sugarcanes.

1935
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:27,911
Go and keep it there.

1936
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:30,045
Okay, okay, okay,
now it all makes sense?

1937
02:05:30,356 --> 02:05:31,721
Durga Prasad is this
country's number one..

1938
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:33,291
...sugarcane crop owner, right?

1939
02:05:33,392 --> 02:05:35,326
You are wrong, number two.

1940
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:37,455
But she's her daughter.

1941
02:05:38,264 --> 02:05:39,788
And for that I should marry her?

1942
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:41,730
Young man, he has sugarcane..

1943
02:05:41,834 --> 02:05:42,994
...and I have a factory.

1944
02:05:43,102 --> 02:05:44,467
When these two are mixed
together we prepare plastic.

1945
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:46,737
Come on, come on, jump, jump.

1946
02:05:46,839 --> 02:05:48,136
I like it.

1947
02:05:49,174 --> 02:05:50,334
Marry Sumitra.

1948
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:52,338
And you can have a mistress as well.

1949
02:05:52,845 --> 02:05:54,278
Where is the factory, tell me?
- I don't know.

1950
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:55,404
Or else I will pound you.

1951
02:05:55,514 --> 02:05:57,243
No matter what you do my
answer will be the same, sir.

1952
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:01,877
Listen.

1953
02:06:02,121 --> 02:06:03,145
Listen.

1954
02:06:03,789 --> 02:06:04,813
What happened?

1955
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:06,757
Look, Raju, my father
has turned my marriage..

1956
02:06:06,859 --> 02:06:08,986
...Into a business as well.

1957
02:06:10,262 --> 02:06:11,820
Don't cry. I am there.

1958
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:13,821
I am still alive. I am there.

1959
02:06:13,933 --> 02:06:14,957
Be quiet.

1960
02:06:15,067 --> 02:06:16,364
Enough. Nothing will happen.

1961
02:06:18,003 --> 02:06:21,166
Your cheeks are so soft,
like the apples of Kashmir.

1962
02:06:21,473 --> 02:06:23,031
The Lord is consoling her.

1963
02:06:23,142 --> 02:06:24,166
You are wrong.

1964
02:06:24,276 --> 02:06:25,300
Soothing her.

1965
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:26,435
He's cajoling her.

1966
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:28,779
If you keep talking
nonsense like this..

1967
02:06:28,881 --> 02:06:29,973
...then I will break
this glass on your head.

1968
02:06:30,082 --> 02:06:31,106
Close your eyes!

1969
02:06:31,216 --> 02:06:32,274
I didn't mean you.

1970
02:06:32,885 --> 02:06:33,909
Be quiet.

1971
02:06:57,910 --> 02:06:59,537
"You are so beautiful."

1972
02:06:59,845 --> 02:07:01,813
"My love is crazy."

1973
02:07:06,051 --> 02:07:09,987
"Now even I dwell in your heart."

1974
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:15,427
"I lost my heart."

1975
02:07:15,527 --> 02:07:17,358
"I've lost my serenity."

1976
02:07:17,463 --> 02:07:19,431
"I can't sleep or stay awake."

1977
02:07:19,531 --> 02:07:21,328
"What should I do?"

1978
02:07:21,433 --> 02:07:26,097
"I am not.. in my senses."

1979
02:07:26,205 --> 02:07:27,900
"You are so beautiful."

1980
02:07:28,007 --> 02:07:29,998
"My love is crazy."

1981
02:07:30,109 --> 02:07:34,102
"Now even I dwell in your heart."

1982
02:08:06,378 --> 02:08:10,109
"You covertly entered my heart."

1983
02:08:10,215 --> 02:08:15,551
"Now I.. think about
you all the time."

1984
02:08:16,455 --> 02:08:20,414
"He runs behind me
like a crazy lover."

1985
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:25,293
"How do I.. stop him."

1986
02:08:26,498 --> 02:08:30,434
"The eagerness torments me."

1987
02:08:30,536 --> 02:08:34,336
"I am completely restless."

1988
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,237
"I've lost my serenity."

1989
02:08:36,341 --> 02:08:38,206
"I can't sleep or stay awake."

1990
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:40,141
"What should I do?"

1991
02:08:40,245 --> 02:08:44,978
"I am not.. in my senses."

1992
02:08:45,084 --> 02:08:46,574
"You are so beautiful."

1993
02:08:46,685 --> 02:08:48,915
"My love is crazy."

1994
02:08:49,021 --> 02:08:52,980
"Now even I dwell in your heart."

1995
02:09:29,328 --> 02:09:33,196
"I am so immersed in your love."

1996
02:09:33,298 --> 02:09:38,634
"That I don't know where I am."

1997
02:09:39,538 --> 02:09:48,469
"You gradually enter my
senses like a fragrance."

1998
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:53,508
"The heart's getting intoxicated."

1999
02:09:53,619 --> 02:09:57,316
"The heart's making mistakes."

2000
02:09:57,422 --> 02:09:59,151
"I've lost my serenity."

2001
02:09:59,258 --> 02:10:01,123
"I can't sleep or stay awake."

2002
02:10:01,226 --> 02:10:03,057
"What should I do?"

2003
02:10:03,162 --> 02:10:07,997
"I am not.. in my senses."

2004
02:10:17,576 --> 02:10:19,476
So, brother. Why are
you looking so dull?

2005
02:10:20,112 --> 02:10:21,477
Now we know where the factory is.

2006
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:24,010
Lets inform the police..

2007
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:25,174
...and they'll know what to do next.

2008
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:27,443
There is something wrong.

2009
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:31,011
GK opening a factory
there and people dying..

2010
02:10:31,123 --> 02:10:33,318
...due to the chemical
coming out of that factory.

2011
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:35,218
Something is not right.

2012
02:10:35,661 --> 02:10:37,754
Actually GK wants to kill people.

2013
02:10:39,631 --> 02:10:41,599
That's why he removed the
medical camp from there.

2014
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:45,101
That means that joker lied.
- You are right.

2015
02:10:45,604 --> 02:10:46,628
He doesn't know the whole thing.

2016
02:10:47,139 --> 02:10:49,107
Then who will tell
us about the rest.

2017
02:10:51,610 --> 02:10:52,634
Why you..

2018
02:10:55,214 --> 02:10:56,704
Madam, do you want to die?

2019
02:11:00,419 --> 02:11:03,081
'Sir, you go ahead I
will reach in half an hour.'

2020
02:11:05,157 --> 02:11:06,647
What happened?
- Where are you going?

2021
02:11:07,426 --> 02:11:08,450
Brother.

2022
02:11:09,294 --> 02:11:10,659
Seems like Govardhan
will get us killed.

2023
02:11:11,597 --> 02:11:13,258
Are you thinking of
breaking the door down?

2024
02:11:13,632 --> 02:11:16,260
Brother Govardhan, take us
along too. Brother Govardhan

2025
02:11:35,454 --> 02:11:37,081
I was kidnapped by
Hardoi Chatttrapati Raju..

2026
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:39,248
...from in front of the office.

2027
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:45,489
But I didn't say anything.

2028
02:11:48,467 --> 02:11:49,661
Not for not saying anything.

2029
02:11:50,736 --> 02:11:52,101
It's because you didn't find him.

2030
02:11:57,709 --> 02:12:00,177
You shouldn't smoke
cigarette along with alcohol.

2031
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:01,507
It's a bad habit.

2032
02:12:02,681 --> 02:12:04,239
Does anyone else
know about this secret?

2033
02:12:05,517 --> 02:12:07,109
Why are you following me?

2034
02:12:07,219 --> 02:12:08,584
You tell me why you were running.

2035
02:12:11,690 --> 02:12:12,748
I don't know anything.

2036
02:12:13,592 --> 02:12:14,718
I didn't ask you anything.

2037
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:18,127
You knew that the
doctor is going to die.

2038
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:20,698
That's why you didn't
sit in the car that day.

2039
02:12:21,233 --> 02:12:23,463
Anyone that stays with
him will die. - Why?

2040
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,866
When someone's losing
millions will he stay quiet?

2041
02:12:26,371 --> 02:12:27,861
Such high value for
a plastic factory?

2042
02:12:28,307 --> 02:12:30,138
Plastic factory is a small thing.

2043
02:12:30,242 --> 02:12:33,177
This is much bigger than that.
- How big?

2044
02:12:34,513 --> 02:12:35,537
Bigger than my life.

2045
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:37,339
They are going to
eradicate the entire village..

2046
02:12:37,449 --> 02:12:38,643
...what are you?

2047
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,215
More than a
billion dollars of money.

2048
02:12:43,322 --> 02:12:46,883
10 corporate offices,
many MP's, ministers and GK.

2049
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:48,584
Everyone has planned this together.

2050
02:12:48,694 --> 02:12:50,161
They will eradicate an
entire village from the state..

2051
02:12:50,262 --> 02:12:52,753
...before the people find out.

2052
02:12:55,767 --> 02:12:59,726
Actually this matter began
from Rajasthan's Gidhwala village.

2053
02:12:59,838 --> 02:13:01,703
While returning from Jaisalmer..

2054
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:03,775
...I and doctor
Paranjye stayed back there.

2055
02:13:03,875 --> 02:13:06,673
And that night was 'Janmastami'.

2056
02:13:07,546 --> 02:13:09,173
Dr. Paranjye was attracted..

2057
02:13:09,281 --> 02:13:11,841
...towards Lord Krishna's crown.

2058
02:13:12,284 --> 02:13:14,184
And Dilawar Singh from the village..

2059
02:13:14,286 --> 02:13:16,345
...helped us in testing that crown.

2060
02:13:17,289 --> 02:13:19,723
It wasn't made of copper or bronze.

2061
02:13:20,292 --> 02:13:22,658
After scraping it we
found that it was..

2062
02:13:23,295 --> 02:13:24,319
'Iridium.'

2063
02:13:25,764 --> 02:13:29,564
'Costlier than gold,
stronger than platinum.'

2064
02:13:29,668 --> 02:13:31,932
'Rarest and toughest.'

2065
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:36,206
'This element is made from
colliding of asteroids..'

2066
02:13:36,308 --> 02:13:39,277
'..and from falling from the
sky millions of years ago.'

2067
02:13:40,245 --> 02:13:42,440
'It has the capability of
withstanding intense heat.'

2068
02:13:43,315 --> 02:13:46,648
'It is used in satellites,
nuclear warheads.'

2069
02:13:49,821 --> 02:13:51,789
'If it is bonded with bronze..'

2070
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:54,655
'..then you can see its many forms.'

2071
02:13:54,926 --> 02:13:57,690
'This metal must have
been found in Rajasthan..'

2072
02:13:57,796 --> 02:14:01,254
'..and they made a
crown of Lord Krishna.'

2073
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:04,626
'It travels all the way
from Madhya Pradesh, Orissa..'

2074
02:14:04,736 --> 02:14:07,227
'..'Ghati' (Valleys) and
finally it settled down..'

2075
02:14:07,339 --> 02:14:09,307
'..in this Pali village of
northern Andhra Pradesh.'

2076
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:14,437
'I spent 20 million for
sponsoring this research program.'

2077
02:14:15,614 --> 02:14:17,514
'But you have given me
information worth billions.'

2078
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:19,374
'Thank you, Paranjye.'

2079
02:14:20,485 --> 02:14:21,645
'This shouldn't leak out.'

2080
02:14:22,354 --> 02:14:23,548
'Bury it right here.'

2081
02:14:23,955 --> 02:14:25,320
'How can I do that, sir?'

2082
02:14:25,824 --> 02:14:27,553
'It is the property
of the government.'

2083
02:14:28,026 --> 02:14:29,789
'It can change the face of economy.'

2084
02:14:30,429 --> 02:14:31,691
'We should inform them.'

2085
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:33,825
'What will I get from that?'

2086
02:14:34,366 --> 02:14:35,526
'The contract to dig it out?'

2087
02:14:35,901 --> 02:14:37,528
'I want the entire iridium.'

2088
02:14:37,636 --> 02:14:40,571
it's illegal.
- But I spent money for it.'

2089
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:43,335
'That's why I gave you a copy.'

2090
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:47,606
'Don't irritate me, Paranjye.'

2091
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:52,341
'If you want to live then
let this remain a secret.'

2092
02:14:52,851 --> 02:14:55,012
But the doctor didn't listen to GK.

2093
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,850
He wanted to associate the
department of Ecology in this research.

2094
02:14:57,956 --> 02:15:02,552
That's why Dilawar Singh and
he were murdered brutally.

2095
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:05,420
Who else?
- A taxi driver called Raju.

2096
02:15:05,530 --> 02:15:08,328
Does he know about this? - He
arrived after the doctor's death.

2097
02:15:08,433 --> 02:15:09,525
Does he know or not?

2098
02:15:10,669 --> 02:15:12,466
Maybe not, sir.
- Are you sure?

2099
02:15:15,006 --> 02:15:16,906
I don't like this word 'maybe'.

2100
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:19,570
Should I kill him too?

2101
02:15:19,678 --> 02:15:21,703
You killed two government
officers in broad daylight.

2102
02:15:21,813 --> 02:15:23,508
But this driver is worrying me.

2103
02:15:25,417 --> 02:15:26,441
Do one thing.

2104
02:15:26,952 --> 02:15:28,510
Take him somewhere far from here.

2105
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:31,519
And kill him.
- Yes, sir.

2106
02:15:34,025 --> 02:15:35,322
Did you ever think that
how did Dilawar Singh..

2107
02:15:35,427 --> 02:15:37,327
...who earned only
2,000 rupees a month..

2108
02:15:37,429 --> 02:15:38,453
...get 5,00,000
rupees from the insurance?

2109
02:15:38,697 --> 02:15:40,324
Your cab owners were given money..

2110
02:15:40,432 --> 02:15:42,332
...the papers were
readied and given to you..

2111
02:15:42,434 --> 02:15:44,061
...and then sent to Rajasthan.

2112
02:15:44,569 --> 02:15:46,332
That day when the goons
arrived at the village..

2113
02:15:46,438 --> 02:15:48,702
...they were there to
kill you and not Sunita.

2114
02:15:50,575 --> 02:15:52,406
How is iridium connected
with the plastic factory?

2115
02:15:52,711 --> 02:15:54,611
We need plastic to pack iridium.

2116
02:15:54,713 --> 02:15:55,737
Strong plastic.

2117
02:15:55,847 --> 02:15:57,576
And I have built
this factory for that.

2118
02:15:57,682 --> 02:16:00,014
And to make strong
plastic one requires sugarcane.

2119
02:16:00,118 --> 02:16:02,348
And for that it is very important..

2120
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:04,388
...for Durga Prasad's
daughter to marry my son.

2121
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:06,354
The village should
be evacuated so that..

2122
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:08,688
...I can peacefully extract the
iridium from below the village.

2123
02:16:08,994 --> 02:16:10,825
But if we evacuate the
village forcefully..

2124
02:16:10,929 --> 02:16:12,920
...the government and the
media will find out about it.

2125
02:16:13,732 --> 02:16:15,359
We get rid of the
residents of Pali..

2126
02:16:15,467 --> 02:16:17,094
...we will have to
develop fear in their hearts.

2127
02:16:17,736 --> 02:16:19,533
The people of that
village are superstitious.

2128
02:16:19,638 --> 02:16:21,367
We should take advantage of it.

2129
02:16:22,007 --> 02:16:24,976
We will have to develop
fear in their water and air.

2130
02:16:25,744 --> 02:16:29,111
Death should make
even their souls quiver.

2131
02:16:29,748 --> 02:16:31,375
Since then the poisonous
water of the factory..

2132
02:16:31,483 --> 02:16:33,610
...was mixed in the
village's river and lake.

2133
02:16:33,718 --> 02:16:35,379
The people of Pali
village started dying..

2134
02:16:35,487 --> 02:16:36,511
...after drinking that water.

2135
02:16:36,621 --> 02:16:37,986
The entire village
turned into a graveyard.

2136
02:16:38,089 --> 02:16:39,386
No doctor visited that place..

2137
02:16:39,491 --> 02:16:40,981
...nor did anyone
receive any medication.

2138
02:16:41,092 --> 02:16:42,389
They wanted the entire
village to be evacuated..

2139
02:16:42,494 --> 02:16:44,553
...before the extraction started.

2140
02:16:44,663 --> 02:16:46,858
Everything was going
fine until you arrived.

2141
02:16:47,632 --> 02:16:49,122
GK promised me that..

2142
02:16:49,768 --> 02:16:51,599
...he will pay me 1 billion
rupees after the extraction is done.

2143
02:16:57,642 --> 02:16:59,906
You shouldn't tell a story
holding a gun in your hands.

2144
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:01,478
You should shoot.

2145
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:04,140
And the person should die as
soon as you press the trigger.

2146
02:17:06,985 --> 02:17:08,418
No matter what GK
extracts from there..

2147
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:09,851
...I won't spare him.

2148
02:17:11,056 --> 02:17:13,422
Tell that GK that I am
getting a six foot tall..

2149
02:17:13,525 --> 02:17:15,959
...and two feet broad casket for him.

2150
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:17,653
He cannot escape me.

2151
02:17:19,798 --> 02:17:22,096
If he's a man, then
ask him to come to Pali.

2152
02:17:24,135 --> 02:17:26,626
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

2153
02:17:27,005 --> 02:17:28,165
You were holding a gun.

2154
02:17:28,807 --> 02:17:29,831
A loaded one.

2155
02:17:30,542 --> 02:17:31,702
Your target was in front of you.

2156
02:17:32,544 --> 02:17:33,636
Then why didn't you shoot him?

2157
02:17:35,614 --> 02:17:36,638
I..

2158
02:17:37,983 --> 02:17:39,610
I was scared to see him.

2159
02:17:47,892 --> 02:17:49,951
It was my mistake to trust you.

2160
02:17:51,096 --> 02:17:52,120
I am sorry.

2161
02:17:52,998 --> 02:17:54,022
Everyone listen.

2162
02:17:54,132 --> 02:17:55,156
We have to reach Pali in 15 minutes.

2163
02:17:55,267 --> 02:17:56,825
Many people are ready to die.

2164
02:17:56,935 --> 02:17:58,732
Not even a single person
should survive in that village.

2165
02:18:24,596 --> 02:18:25,995
I have built a
factory in this village.

2166
02:18:27,098 --> 02:18:28,929
And let the poisonous water
from it flow in your lake.

2167
02:18:30,068 --> 02:18:32,502
I thought that you
will leave this village..

2168
02:18:32,604 --> 02:18:35,164
...from the fear of dying after
drinking that poisonous water.

2169
02:18:36,675 --> 02:18:38,165
But you believed
someone as your God.

2170
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:40,637
And he started
protecting all of you.

2171
02:18:41,212 --> 02:18:44,807
Your God has ruined my entire plan.

2172
02:18:47,218 --> 02:18:49,709
Who is he?
- Our God.

2173
02:18:49,821 --> 02:18:50,845
Will he save you?

2174
02:18:51,890 --> 02:18:53,517
The life of every person..

2175
02:18:53,625 --> 02:18:55,991
...lies in every flag
that's posted here.

2176
02:18:57,095 --> 02:19:02,931
God will surely
come.. to save these 534 lives.

2177
02:19:05,070 --> 02:19:08,267
How many flags are there?
- 544, sir.

2178
02:19:09,307 --> 02:19:11,867
And how many corpses?
- 10 people, sir.

2179
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:19,708
544 minus 10.

2180
02:19:19,818 --> 02:19:22,082
534.

2181
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:26,284
You predict the future, don't you?

2182
02:19:27,659 --> 02:19:30,628
What is your future, tell me.

2183
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:34,023
I want this soil.

2184
02:19:34,999 --> 02:19:37,126
I want the iridium below it.

2185
02:19:37,802 --> 02:19:38,996
I will have it.

2186
02:19:39,671 --> 02:19:41,138
Can your God stop me?

2187
02:19:53,151 --> 02:19:58,316
Soon you will be reduced to the
soil you are so eager to obtain.

2188
02:19:59,357 --> 02:20:02,849
In 15 minutes you will be
standing at the doors of hell.

2189
02:20:02,961 --> 02:20:05,657
Your fame will be destroyed.

2190
02:20:07,165 --> 02:20:09,258
Death is coming in front of you.

2191
02:20:10,702 --> 02:20:13,671
The sound his footsteps
will make your heart explode.

2192
02:20:15,974 --> 02:20:18,841
Your heart will be
stuck in your throat.

2193
02:20:19,711 --> 02:20:22,805
It will be scared even
to see a small child.

2194
02:20:24,215 --> 02:20:26,911
Your palms will face the sky.

2195
02:20:28,086 --> 02:20:32,352
Leave as soon as you
see our God. Leave. Go.

2196
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:35,626
This contains a
magazine of 12 bullets..

2197
02:20:35,727 --> 02:20:37,126
...and I also have 50 men.

2198
02:20:37,228 --> 02:20:38,752
Now there are 533 left.

2199
02:20:39,197 --> 02:20:40,221
Lord.

2200
02:21:02,687 --> 02:21:04,917
The divine sight.

2201
02:21:11,029 --> 02:21:12,656
I can see it, Lord.

2202
02:21:13,298 --> 02:21:14,788
I am overwhelmed.

2203
02:21:17,368 --> 02:21:18,392
Over..

2204
02:21:39,924 --> 02:21:41,289
Tears in God's eyes.

2205
02:21:45,396 --> 02:21:47,159
So he might bleed as well.

2206
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:25,105
'Death is coming in front of you.'

2207
02:25:26,284 --> 02:25:29,219
'The sound his footsteps
will make your heart explode.'

2208
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:36,652
Go away.

2209
02:25:40,498 --> 02:25:42,261
I am not taking anything from here.

2210
02:25:42,366 --> 02:25:43,390
I only do my business.

2211
02:25:43,501 --> 02:25:44,525
Go ahead, do your business.

2212
02:25:44,635 --> 02:25:45,659
Do it.

2213
02:25:47,171 --> 02:25:48,536
But you won't ruin a single home.

2214
02:25:50,041 --> 02:25:51,338
Not a single drop of
blood will be shed.

2215
02:25:52,043 --> 02:25:53,067
Can you do that?

2216
02:25:53,511 --> 02:25:55,342
Business. You will do business.

2217
02:25:55,446 --> 02:25:57,277
What will you get by digging here?

2218
02:25:57,381 --> 02:25:58,405
Iridium.

2219
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:00,278
Iridium.

2220
02:26:00,518 --> 02:26:02,509
You don't even know its spelling.

2221
02:26:03,588 --> 02:26:06,182
Rocket and
satellites are made from it.

2222
02:26:07,058 --> 02:26:08,320
It is very valuable.

2223
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:10,491
The people here don't know that.

2224
02:26:10,595 --> 02:26:11,619
They are crazy.

2225
02:26:12,196 --> 02:26:15,529
You know it is more
expensive than gold.

2226
02:26:16,067 --> 02:26:17,500
Is it more valuable than human life?

2227
02:26:18,336 --> 02:26:20,099
Is it more valuable
than your severed hand?

2228
02:26:21,339 --> 02:26:23,432
GK. Let's do business.

2229
02:26:24,542 --> 02:26:26,134
I will give you that mountain.

2230
02:26:26,677 --> 02:26:27,701
Will you give me this hand?

2231
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:31,009
Will you give me this hand in exchange
of this hand? - Leave it. Leave it..

2232
02:26:31,115 --> 02:26:32,139
Leave it. Leave it. Leave it.

2233
02:26:32,683 --> 02:26:35,345
Give that hand. Give that hand.
Give that hand, GK.

2234
02:26:37,555 --> 02:26:40,547
'You will be even scared
to see a small child.'

2235
02:26:40,658 --> 02:26:42,250
Fool, you scared me.

2236
02:26:47,365 --> 02:26:49,196
You think you are God
just because they said so.

2237
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:50,426
Who said I am God?

2238
02:26:51,369 --> 02:26:52,734
Will God come down just to kill you?

2239
02:26:52,837 --> 02:26:56,273
I don't need any weapon to kill you.

2240
02:26:56,374 --> 02:26:58,399
My hands are capable
enough to kill you.

2241
02:26:58,509 --> 02:26:59,533
Come on.

2242
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:02,503
GK.

2243
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:06,140
GK.

2244
02:27:07,118 --> 02:27:08,142
GK.

2245
02:27:09,654 --> 02:27:10,678
Come out.

2246
02:27:14,125 --> 02:27:17,060
'Your heart will be
stuck in your throat.'

2247
02:27:24,535 --> 02:27:25,559
No!

2248
02:27:27,605 --> 02:27:28,765
No!

2249
02:27:31,409 --> 02:27:33,206
Don't kill me.

2250
02:27:38,482 --> 02:27:41,645
No! No! No!

2251
02:27:41,752 --> 02:27:44,619
Leave me. Leave me.

2252
02:27:47,425 --> 02:27:51,122
Leave me. I beg you.

2253
02:27:51,229 --> 02:27:52,253
Move your hands.

2254
02:27:52,363 --> 02:27:53,591
You are scared of
death now, aren't you?

2255
02:27:54,165 --> 02:27:55,723
Where was this fear
when you killed Siddha?

2256
02:27:56,701 --> 02:27:59,568
Look. You killed him brutally,
didn't you?

2257
02:28:00,438 --> 02:28:03,202
He fell at my feet and
brought me here calling me God.

2258
02:28:03,774 --> 02:28:06,106
He never looked into my eyes.

2259
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:08,303
He looked into my eyes
just before he died.

2260
02:28:09,714 --> 02:28:12,080
When he was dying there
was happiness in his eyes..

2261
02:28:12,183 --> 02:28:14,083
...and not fear.

2262
02:28:14,185 --> 02:28:15,675
And you are pleading.

2263
02:28:18,189 --> 02:28:19,679
I didn't know that you
are such a big rogue.

2264
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:22,088
If I had known it then that day..

2265
02:28:22,193 --> 02:28:24,218
...I would have wished that you
die instead of asking for water.

2266
02:28:27,665 --> 02:28:30,566
If I am God then
you will have to die.

2267
02:28:30,668 --> 02:28:32,295
I curse you.

2268
02:28:45,349 --> 02:28:50,286
'You will be startled to
see our God in front of you.'

2269
02:28:51,489 --> 02:28:52,513
'You won't be able to see.'

2270
02:28:54,625 --> 02:28:57,287
'Your palms will face the sky.'

2271
02:29:31,529 --> 02:29:34,555
Lord, the void has been filled.

2272
02:29:34,665 --> 02:29:36,155
After killing
Siddha he thought that..

2273
02:29:36,267 --> 02:29:38,827
...only 533 are left,
that was his foolishness.

2274
02:29:40,271 --> 02:29:41,898
Divine predictions are never wrong.

2275
02:29:43,541 --> 02:29:44,565
Veera.

2276
02:30:07,832 --> 02:30:10,357
You protected this
life from his clutches.

2277
02:30:11,435 --> 02:30:13,335
He was still in his mother's womb.

2278
02:30:14,372 --> 02:30:16,738
He's the 534th life, Lord.

2279
02:30:18,776 --> 02:30:21,438
No one can see when
miracles take place.

2280
02:30:21,545 --> 02:30:24,207
And there's no need to see
it after it has occurred.

2281
02:30:27,318 --> 02:30:29,377
You might not believe
that you are our God.

2282
02:30:29,487 --> 02:30:31,216
But for us you are our God.

2283
02:30:34,525 --> 02:30:37,585
Lord, this is the apple of your eye.

2284
02:30:39,797 --> 02:30:40,957
Please give him your blessings.
