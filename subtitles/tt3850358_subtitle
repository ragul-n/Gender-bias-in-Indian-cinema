1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,250
'Liquor drinking
is injurious to health.'

2
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:05,500
'Smoking causes cancer.
Smoking kills.'

3
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:52,628
Spoiling our life and the
reason for us to be jailed..

4
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:58,003
..we shall take an oath
this moment to kill that guy.

5
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,378
Need to kill wherever he is.

6
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,605
Where ever.

7
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:08,011
Hey! Not possible for you.

8
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:11,416
You are 10 and my son is just one.

9
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:16,406
Still it is not possible
for you to defeat him.

10
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,239
Anybody, how much
ever you want bet now.

11
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:22,447
In this Kabaddi,
it is sure for my son Seenu to win.

12
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,531
Prize money 50000 coming to us is sure.

13
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,239
Before watching his son Seenu
being given so much buildup by him..

14
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,114
..let us watch
the following he has first.

15
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:37,447
God, even when I failed 10th ten
times I had never asked you anything.

16
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:41,364
But, see to that our
Seenu wins in Kabaddi God.

17
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,572
For a week I will be without
eating Chicken, mutton.

18
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:47,322
I will not fight with anyone from now.

19
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:51,739
Make our Seenu win.
All the money should come to him. Yes.

20
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:58,322
Hey leader of the world! Thinking
even logically, our Seenu should win.

21
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,281
If he wins, Ha ha ha,
will shave my head..

22
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:03,531
..not for me, for my wife.

23
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:07,406
All these praying for
Seenu is not with love on him.

24
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:09,572
With the hope to get
back the money they gave him.

25
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:10,906
Now let us watch Seenu.

26
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,615
Son! With this shot, all our
debts should be cleared. Collapse them.

27
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,822
Okay Uncle.

28
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:54,614
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

29
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,072
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.
- Catch him!

00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:00,572
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

32
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:10,614
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

33
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:21,406
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

34
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:27,197
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

35
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:32,741
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

36
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:44,199
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

37
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:48,366
Hey!
- Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

38
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:57,491
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

39
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:08,032
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

40
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:09,532
Oh God!

41
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:16,032
Super son! Hey clap man. Hey, hey!

42
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,991
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

43
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,866
There..
- Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

44
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,741
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

45
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:28,157
Hey, hey!

46
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:32,366
Finish it!
- Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

47
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,782
Do not stop the chant.

48
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:38,032
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.
- Do it!

49
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:43,616
Go on..
- Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

50
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,407
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

51
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,907
Thank God, Your amount is safe.

52
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:03,574
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

53
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:14,653
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

54
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:21,116
Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi, Kabaddi.

55
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,366
You are super, son.

56
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,574
Seenu, You should give
back my amount adding 500 to it.

57
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,032
Why, Why should he give?

58
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:44,949
Broke a hundred coconuts.

59
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:45,782
So what?

60
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,532
Let us give uncle.

61
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,782
How do you think you won as per logic?

62
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:51,116
I prayed to shave the head
of my wife if you win.

63
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:52,824
Wow! Means couple of shaven heads.

64
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,032
Would be superb!

65
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,116
Great!

66
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,491
Badami youth Association presented
Kabaddi competition winner, our Seenu..

67
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:00,366
Respect.

68
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,616
Yes, yes. That is.

69
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,866
Requesting our Seenu sir
to come and take the prize.

70
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,282
Bloody fellow, where is he?

71
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,074
Where is this guy?

72
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,741
Hey Seenu..

73
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:26,407
"Hey Kokapeta, Khajipeta.."

74
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:32,366
"Balkampeta, Brodipeta,
Saidapeta, Siddipeta."

75
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:38,824
"Ambarpeta, Ameerpeta,
Shameerpeta, Hakimpeta, any street.."

76
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:42,032
"..is mine."

77
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:08,824
"My family name is silk,
my body colour is milk."

78
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:12,407
"If you touch, I will give you a shock"

79
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:16,657
"My word is parrot talk,
my shake is lightening shine."

80
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:20,116
"Hey there is no one
left not falling in my trap."

81
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:24,574
"Feel shy at 6 o'clock,
blink eye at 10 o'clock. "

82
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:28,491
"Ask to rise at 11 o'clock,
light the fire round the clock."

83
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:32,491
"Will touch front back,
reduce your head ache."

84
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:36,616
"Put my lip lock,
make you get heart attack."

85
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,616
"Come my rubber doll.."

86
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:43,407
"..looking at you my mind is blocked."

87
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:47,366
"Come my rubber doll.."

88
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:52,282
"..looking at you my mind is blocked."

89
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:03,949
"My family name is silk,
my body colour is milk."

90
00:10:04,032 --> 00:10:07,824
"If you touch, will give you a shock?"

91
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:47,157
"Why those goggles to your blue eyes?"

92
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:51,199
"Hey, to change the
day into dark night."

93
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:55,032
"Why so many bangles
to your small hands?"

94
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:59,074
"Those bangles are
to tell angles in me."

95
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,907
"In your waist folds
why is that key chain?"

96
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:06,866
"In your waist folds
why is that key chain?"

97
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:10,532
"To touch it and for
you to open my heart door."

98
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,824
"For you to open."

99
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:15,866
"Come my rubber doll.."

100
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:20,949
"..looking at you my mind is blocked."

101
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,491
"Enthrall!"

102
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:56,116
"Why red color in the beautiful lips?"

103
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:59,991
"Hey in front of all
to stop like a red signal."

104
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:03,991
"Why that tattoo on your body back?"

105
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:08,032
"To flag off if you come to a side."

106
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:11,741
"Why the white polish
on your hand nails?"

107
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:15,657
"Why the white polish
on your hand nails?"

108
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:19,491
"To come in my hand
and faint day and night.."

109
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,824
"..faint day and night."

110
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,741
"Come my rubber doll.."

111
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:29,282
"..looking at you my mind is blocked."

112
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:33,491
"My family name is silk,
my body colour is milk."

113
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:37,491
"If you touch, will give you a shock"

114
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,241
Who is it man?

115
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:03,991
Who has tied me up?

116
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:04,907
It is us.

117
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:07,699
If you pay what you should,
we would untie.

118
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:11,532
Hey, if my uncle comes to know you
have tied me, it would not be normal.

119
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,616
Good morning Son!

120
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,991
What, went to Sheela baby again?

121
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:21,074
Yes Uncle! As she was in some troubles,
went to console her.

122
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,574
First of all it is winter,
Why these meetings at night?

123
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,782
Have you worn monkey cap?

124
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:27,449
Okay, asked you to have curd
rice before sleeping. Have you taken?

125
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:28,407
Will you stop?

126
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:31,116
Is it the money of his dad?
If you go on enjoying..

127
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,782
..with our money saying Silpa babies
and Sheela babies.

128
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:35,282
Shall we sit performing
rituals and poojas here?

129
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:38,241
I am not any feelings about 10th.

130
00:13:38,324 --> 00:13:38,949
Logic.

131
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:40,532
What shall I do Reedappa sir..

132
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,407
..saying brother! Take there is no elder
brother like Venkatesh.

133
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,991
To call Brother with love..

134
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,616
..no sisters as in Hitler film.

135
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,366
At least to move on happily,
no friends like Happy days film.

136
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:54,116
Huh! Who else other than Silpa babies
and Sheela babies to my life, you tell?

137
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,074
Logically, what Seenu says is correct.

138
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,366
All these days
we thought him mischievous..

139
00:13:58,449 --> 00:13:59,741
..but forgot that he was single, sir.

140
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:03,907
Hey, How is he single, man?
Son, I am there for you.

141
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:06,491
Yes! He is become
so due to your handling.

142
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:08,324
Reddappa sir, you said such a big word.

143
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:11,449
What is me growing him? He
is growing me. Still, I go behind him..

144
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:16,741
..but he does not come behind me, right?
What Gundappa brother?

145
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:17,532
That is true.

146
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:18,366
You, shut up.

147
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:20,032
Hey man, when would
you pay back our money?

148
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:21,907
You untie me, I will pay by evening.

149
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:25,574
Logically thinking, how will the money
which is not there now come by evening?

150
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,157
Do you want money or logic?

151
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:27,866
Money.

152
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:28,866
Then untie.

153
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,074
Gundappa sir!
Think he is again giving us a cutting.

154
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,699
He asked time only till evening..

155
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:35,866
..let us tie him up again
if he does not pay, logically.

156
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:36,782
Will you stop the nonsense.

157
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:38,074
Hey, untie him man.

158
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:38,991
Come man!

159
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:43,741
Gundappa sir! Come straight
to the pond in the evening.

160
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:45,616
I will settle you all there.
Uncle, come.

161
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,991
Hey, I am not understanding.

162
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:50,532
How will you pay the money by evening?

163
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,282
Gundappa!

164
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:55,866
Heart is badly beating man.

165
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:57,241
Will you think he comes?

166
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:58,991
Now logically.
- Bloody, shut up.

167
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,616
You untied him saying logic and magic..

168
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:03,282
..if he does not comes..

169
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,991
What if he does not?
- You should go.

170
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:08,241
What Reddappa, Gundappa?
All have gathered, any meeting?

171
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,657
Not meeting, waiting.

172
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,699
That Seenu fellow said to settle
the payment to all. We thus came here.

173
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,866
What? He and his uncle have
just met in the railway station.

174
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,324
Said have settled all debts
and going to Tirupati for shaving head.

175
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,157
I too have a prayer
pending from long time.

176
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:23,366
I gave them two thousand
to drop in the hundi.

177
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,616
Head shaving was not for him,
he shaved you

178
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:27,991
You bloody Seenu!

179
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:33,574
What have you done man?

180
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,407
Left the village given debts uncle.

181
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:37,199
I did not like what you did.
- Why?

182
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,574
Should talk something
if money is not given..

183
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:41,282
..but why to run away
like this from village.

184
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:43,074
It is wrong to cheat all like this son.

185
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:45,532
What wrong uncle? We had given them
interest more than principle already.

186
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:47,532
One or two, it is six rupees interest.

187
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:49,324
So much will not be there
even in film industry, uncle.

188
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,699
Should have not taken in such case.

189
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,907
Okay uncle! Are we running away or what?

190
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,741
We are going to Chennai now.
From Chennai to Dubai,

191
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:57,032
there if we take an oil
well from a shake as a debt..

192
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:59,491
..then we cannot just pay back our debts,
but can pay back entire village debts.

193
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:00,991
Means, you are really
paying back, right?

194
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:02,407
That is why we are going, uncle.

195
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:07,199
There bhais, wells, shaiks,
shapes, life will be changed uncle.

196
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,366
Do not you lying with me?

197
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,991
Will give back money of all.

198
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:16,366
Okay then.
Enough of drinking! Sleep. Come, sleep.

199
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,366
The journey of these
started so to Chennai.

200
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,116
Takes a wrong turn at Guntakal
junction and has turned their lives.

201
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:29,949
With the hope of going to
Chennai and meeting Dubai babu..

202
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,657
..they are sleeping in
the train to Hyderabad.

203
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,282
Get down.

204
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,741
Son.
- Ok..

205
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:40,407
Whatever, sentiments are
high in our South India, man.

206
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,657
Yea uncle! Much more in Tamilnadu.

207
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,741
I ask..
- What?

208
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:45,407
We do not know Tamil, how do we manage?

209
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,657
When we do not know the language, we
should manage with body language, uncle.

210
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,657
Okay.

211
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:52,116
Hey Babu! Auto.

212
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:53,907
Vanakkam..

213
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,324
Stop if you cannot shiver.
Why are you saying me?

214
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:58,074
Hey Son! Our Telugu guy man.

215
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,991
Yes uncle! What Boss,
will you come to Pondy bazaar?

216
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:02,168
Pondy bazaar?

217
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:04,418
Yes man! As if we came to Hyderabad

Come.. come.

What you are asking is the
Pondy Bazaar in Chennai, right?

221
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,084
Asked great boy! When we come to Chennai,
we ask about Chennai Pondy Bazaar only.

222
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:19,959
Where should you go in Pondy Bazaar sir?

223
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,918
Do not know the address.

00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:23,293
We will call and ask when we reach.

225
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,209
Why? If you find out here,
it would be easy for me.

00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:26,626
It would be easy for us, if go near.

227
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,293
If we say to come saying we are near,
he would himself come.

228
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,126
Auto amount will be saved. What uncle?

229
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,126
You are too ripe man.

230
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:32,334

00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,853
Will come to Chennai
by tomorrow evening.

344
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:37,562
I promise.. Okay, bye.

345
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,103
Boy!
- Yes?

346
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:44,187
Do not feel as I am saying.
Should not lie swearing on mother.

347
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,478
What did I lie sir?

348
00:22:45,728 --> 00:22:49,520
Hey! Staying in Chennai,
said your mom to be coming to Chennai

349
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:51,728
What? Is this is Chennai?
This is Hyderabad.

350
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:52,478
Hyderabad?

351
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,687
Look, Charminar.

352
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,978
Son!

353
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,770
What brother,
will you come to Pondy Bazaar?

354
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:03,020
Pondy Bazaar, one more chance to cheat.

355
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:03,895
Okay, sit.

356
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,812
What are you upto?

357
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:08,978
Came to know so fast, brother?

358
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,103
I came to know fool, you will swell now.

359
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:12,812
How many would you cheat so?

360
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:14,228
Ah.. tell you.
- Hey, stop.

361
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,145
Hey, stop.

362
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:21,687
Hey, stop.

363
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:25,770
Hey, stop.

364
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:43,145
Ah.. ship.

365
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:44,728
Bhai has come..

366
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:45,853
Bhai.

367
00:24:09,978 --> 00:24:10,728
Namaste Bhai.

368
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:13,020
I am Kishan Jewellers partner,
need to talk a bit with you.

369
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,312
Anything, talk with Dimple.

370
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,103
Sir, Dimple madam means.

371
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:17,270
That car.

372
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:25,603
Sir, need to meet Dimple madam.

373
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,145
Dimple Madam?

374
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:28,437
Yes Sir! Is she in?

375
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,228
No! In the dicky, go and meet.

376
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,062
In the dicky?

377
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:33,437
What can I say..
you think Dimple is a lady.

378
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:35,187
I am Dimple.

379
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,895
You?

380
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:38,187
Yes bloody pimple.
Why have you kept the face so?

381
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,812
Name and my face are not matching?

382
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,895
Matched sir.
- Tell, what is the matter?

383
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:43,228
Sir, I am Kishan Jewellers partner sir.

384
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:45,687
When my big brother said
to start business, I put 8crores sir.

385
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:46,895
He said 50 50.

386
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:49,562
Now after getting profits he says
not 50 but 20 sir, that bloody idiot.

387
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:51,145
My work will be done
if Bhai sir makes one call.

388
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,687
As a gift I even got a ten sir.

389
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:54,770
Ten?
- Yes Sir.

390
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,520
Suitcase looks big man,
Is it lacks by mistake?

391
00:24:57,603 --> 00:24:58,187
Yes sir.

392
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,395
Will hit with the shoe.

393
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:01,562
Have you ever seen
Bhai sir dealing in lacks?

394
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:02,853
He will not if the
deal is below a crore.

395
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,270
Even if he does by mistake, I will not.

396
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:05,853
Go, get off.

397
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:08,103
Ten lakhs.

398
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,520
Who is Bhai?

399
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:13,312
For a small matter to forget
by sipping a tea, why Bhai sir?

400
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,853
By you touching us,
he lost idli, I lost diesel.

401
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:17,687
What loss you had? Forget brother.

402
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:20,853
First answer to what I asked.
Why do all fear about him so much?

403
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,187
Bhai means fear.

404
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:27,062
Either illegal deals or legal settlements
in this city are done by Bhai, only.

405
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:30,728
Why are you doing so much enquiry son?

406
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:33,103
You will know why in an hour,
give ten thousand.

407
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:33,812
I need to go for shopping.

408
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:35,145
What is this new loss son?

409
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:36,103
Shut up and give, man.

410
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:51,062
Hey! Go once and look in the room.

411
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,312
What is this torture for us, son?

412
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:53,937
They are not Telugu people,
Ripen people.

413
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,603
Yes man!

414
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:55,645
You vacate the hotel and go.

415
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:56,770
Shut up, go and look.

416
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:57,645
Okay, we will go.

417
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,812
Who is this guy?

418
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,187
Hey! What happened?

419
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,437
Oh! Might have been confused
by thinking some Minister.

420
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,353
This is very too much son.

421
00:26:14,562 --> 00:26:17,478
Bringing in four rotten bags
and as if we looted all your property..

422
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:18,520
..you get Bhai here?

423
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:20,728
He is not Bhai, my uncle.

424
00:26:23,187 --> 00:26:23,895
Uncle.

425
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:24,937
Yes.

426
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,437
Are they twins, son?

427
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,145
No!

428
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:29,478
My uncle has none
in this world other than me.

429
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:32,062
We shall do settlements in
this city using my uncle from today.

430
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:33,645
Bhai will not deal other than in crores.

431
00:26:33,812 --> 00:26:36,103
There will be lacks below crores,
thousands below lacks.

432
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:37,645
We will do those deals.

433
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:38,395
Might be risk?

434
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:40,562
To grow in life, need to do only risk.

435
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:42,645
Bhai should not know about our business.

436
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,270
Uncle should not know that we are doing.

437
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,395
Difficult that your uncle
should not know brother.

438
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:47,853
He firstly asks many logics.

439
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,687
I will manage my uncle by saying
some passport or visa work.

440
00:26:50,895 --> 00:26:52,145
It is a habit for me from childhood.

441
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,353
What should we do?

442
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:56,687
First change your beggar getups
and arrange for a costly car urgently.

443
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,103
I will take care of the rest.

444
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,687
Kishan Jewellers.

445
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:01,728
Yes..

446
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:06,312
Hey Son! What are these mad getups?

447
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:07,020
No other way uncle!

448
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,687
If you do not look so, passport will
not be given, Visa cannot be got.

449
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,478
Passport, Visa means that
is the work Chennai Babu fellow.

450
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:13,062
The work he does is
done by these guys here.

451
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:14,812
Let us give them a chance
to correct their mistake.

452
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:15,312
Yes sir.

453
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,770
To help you, one chance.

454
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:19,770
Okay! Live good man.
Do not go for cheating.

455
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:20,857
Why these cheating getups?

456
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,562
True sir, you move sir.
- Ok..

457
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,270
What is this son?

458
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:37,937
Hotel uncle.
- Why such a big hotel to eat?

459
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:41,020
Namaste Bhai sir.
- Good morning Bhai sir.

460
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:43,395
Just by dressing strong,
why are they giving so much respect?

461
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,687
World is like that uncle.
Give more value to cash than character.

462
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:48,478
That is why we all had
to dress up like this.

463
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:52,895
What man, will our work be done?

464
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,978
Will be done uncle!

465
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:57,687
Those coming are the business partners
to the cousin of passport officer.

466
00:27:57,895 --> 00:27:58,812
If these tell him..

467
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,728
..he tells to the passport officer
our work will be done.

468
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:01,978
Something son,
it is enough if the work is done.

469
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:04,187
Will be done uncle!
You be sipping two coffees by then.

470
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:05,520
I would go, meet them. and come.

471
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:07,228
Hey! Order two coffees for uncle.

472
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,145
Order it.. - Double strong coffee!

473
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:10,312
This star hotel.

474
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:11,728
Then double strong coffee.

475
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:18,728
I had called Tell me.

476
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,603
Greetings sir,
he is my brother Kishanlal.

477
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,395
What, want to threaten me
by using Bhai name?

478
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:25,103
No. Want to settle.

479
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:27,812
If you give his share,
you both can be happy.

480
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:30,270
Look!
Even I can get connection with Bhai.

481
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:33,728
But, Bhai will not put his fingers in
such matters. Do not look to threaten me.

482
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,687
You misunderstood Bhai a lot.

483
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,270
Bhai has already entered
in this matter. Look there.

484
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,853
Sir! He is my one and only brother.

485
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,478
Will I cheat him, you tell? Thought,
he would misuse if money is given.

486
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:58,353
Will not misuse,
it would be better if given.

487
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:00,978
Hey Chagan!
You take how much ever you want.

488
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,437
You are my little brother man.

489
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:04,312
It is enough if you give
what I should get brother..

490
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:05,770
..you leave we shall meet
in the evening.

491
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:08,853
Okay, I am leaving.
Boy, tell Bhai that all is well.

492
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:09,478
Okay okay.

493
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:10,312
You may leave.

494
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:12,853
25 Lacs.

495
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,103
Your problem is solved.
You happy, we happy, Bhai happy.

496
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:17,145
You can leave now.

497
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,062
Thanks.

498
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,312
Bro! Heart attack to my big sister..

499
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,603
..Cancer to small sister,
something else for my mother..

500
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,478
Hey hey hey! Diseases should not
be remembered by seeing money.

501
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:30,312
Hey, they are more clever than us. Let
us take whatever they give, what son?

502
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,270
Yes! Bhai will give us, I will give you.

503
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:32,895
Yes.

504
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,895
Money is rusted badly in Hyderabad,
man! Need to clean.

505
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:39,478
Rohit! Name looks modern, no?

506
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,770
Will you marry if name is good? Crap!

507
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,895
Daddy was careful not
to let out any details.

508
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:48,228
It would have been better if
at least his phone number was known.

509
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,812
Why mobile number?
you can see him direct?

510
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,687
How?

511
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,270
Like that.

512
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,145
Yes! Now you look like a hero, Son.

513
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:59,312
Your daddy is so free means,
he is Rohit.

514
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,103
Also saying him, Son!

515
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:03,520
Crap! Not good.

516
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:05,478
Wait uncle,
will get a nice dress for you.

517
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,728
What, liked me by seeing?

518
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:18,103
How did you know?

519
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:20,062
Was said, Will you marry me?

520
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:21,437
Means, suddenly..

521
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,145
If you like, shall we marry?

522
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,312
Will we not have feelings?

523
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,103
Correct, but..

524
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,270
Do you know Katrina Kaif?

525
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:28,853
Super figure.
- What?

526
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,395
Oh! Means, not more than you.

527
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,770
Does Katrina Kaif know you?

528
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:33,228
How will I be known to her?

529
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,853
This is important, this is the point.

530
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:37,853
It is not enough if you like me.
I liking you is important.

531
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,853
Yes! Correct.

532
00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:42,020
This Anjali to like you height
and beauty are not just enough.

533
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:43,395
You should have many more qualities.

534
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:46,687
It is not so easy to trap daughter
of Bhai like trapping Bhai.

535
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,187
Daughter of Bhai? What is this twist?

536
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:50,395
Yes! What is your name?

537
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:51,603
Oh! See.

538
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:54,353
Yes, Rohit! My daddy loves you a lot.

539
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,187
I have just seen. Reason for him to love
is that you are multi millionaire..

540
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:01,687
..but for me to love you,
should pass a few tests.

541
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:02,520
Tests?

542
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:03,228
Yes!

543
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:05,312
Suppose if you fail in that..

544
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:09,020
..you should some how cancel this
marriage by saying something to my daddy.

545
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,562
Else, I will put poison
and kill you on the first night.

546
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:13,145
Ah!

547
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:13,895
Got it?

548
00:31:13,978 --> 00:31:14,645
Yes!

549
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:18,853
This is my number.

550
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:21,187
Should lift in one ring if I call.

551
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,937
Will lift.

552
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:23,187
Should be before me
in the second minute.

553
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,478
Will come.

554
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:31,478
I made uncle Bhai, God is giving
Bhai as my father-in-law.

555
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,145
Anjali madam!

556
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,395
You look good even from back.

557
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,812
What madam?
Hyderabad is giving all to me.

558
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:19,103
"Saying whatsup,
your naughty thought moved me."

559
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:25,978
"Saying hurry up your
love talk has called me."

560
00:32:26,062 --> 00:32:33,228
"Whatever I am there am in your fever."

561
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:42,103
"Whatever I do..
you are like my heartbeat"

562
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:49,020
"Saying whatsup,
your naughty thought moved me."

563
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:56,103
"Saying hurry up your
love talk has called me."

564
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:34,437
"From Sunrise to Sunset. It
is your voice in my heart FM channel."

565
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,145
"Either bed light or
moon light I can see.."

566
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:42,187
"..if I am with you,
I do not need a moon."

567
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:49,603
"Like a satellite circling around you
my mind will not sleep."

568
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:57,187
"Like a filament glowing day long
A to Z your topic in crazy thoughts."

569
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:04,020
"Saying whatsup,
your naughty thought moved me."

570
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:11,312
"Saying hurry up your
love talk has called me."

571
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:56,020
"Either eat popcorn or listen pop song.
Not able to enjoy in this LOVE kick."

572
00:34:56,103 --> 00:35:03,770
"Either Imax or Inox. Your cutout
is shown in disturbing equation."

573
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:11,270
"Life has changed due
to you like Ilayaraja melody."

574
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,728
"Dreams monsoon started In
rainbow colours drenching my world."

575
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:25,728
"Saying whatsup,
your naughty thought moved me."

576
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:32,937
"Saying hurry up your
love talk has called me."

577
00:35:56,895 --> 00:36:01,353
Please excuse bhanu sir, please live me.

578
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:06,020
Please leave me.

579
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:09,978
Bhanu! Favoring wind started, start.

580
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:14,728
Throw one more bullet.

581
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:15,728
Why?

582
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:18,687
One for Budha,
one for Guru, another for Saturn..

583
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:19,937
..would be like giving equally.

584
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,062
Okay baba.

585
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:25,937
Sir! Bhai Phone from Hyderabad.

586
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,437
Oh! Hello Bhai.

587
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,437
Hi friend.

588
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,937
Called on a good day.

589
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,270
Sukra high days have just started for me.
Our Bhole baba just said.

590
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,645
Not only that..

591
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:40,353
..he said it is very good if marriage
of Rohit and Anjali is done at Sharja.

592
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:44,103
In Sharja? Ha ha ha!
What friend, all of us are here.

593
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:45,812
Can get it done fantastically.

594
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:49,853
I see! You anyways do not have beliefs!
Respect our belief.

595
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:53,812
Sukra has more strength
on Sharjah than India.

596
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,312
Planet would also feel happy it seems.

597
00:36:55,395 --> 00:37:00,687
We shall do marriage grandly in Sharjah,
place the reception in India if you want.

598
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,895
Jai Bholenath!

599
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:03,270
Okay.

600
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:04,520
Dimple.

601
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:06,353
Hey Dimple, We will have
to go to Sharjah for Marriage.

602
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,187
Sir, sir.

603
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,645
Place of the Marriage is not
important rather it is important..

604
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,187
..with whom is the marriage.

605
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,562
We know that the son
of Bhanu Bhai is an idiot.

606
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,812
There are rumours that he
raped and killed a foreigner earlier.

607
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,603
Should we give our own daughter
in marriage to such idiot?

608
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:23,020
Anjali is not my own daughter.
She is my brothers daughter

609
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:25,395
Sir.. Which means..

610
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:28,437
Do not further think.
You will be breathless.

611
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:30,895
You stupid.

612
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:32,937
While your son is studying
happily in London.

613
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:34,770
You are spoiling your daughters life
by giving in marriage to some one else.

614
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,478
You will be smashed.

615
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,895
Brother whose house is this?

616
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:43,812
Bhais house.

617
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,187
Why did you bring us directly
to bhais house. You have no fear at all.

618
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,062
We have bhai but we
do not have customers.

619
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:50,395
For catching customers
we should come here.

620
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,312
How will we catch customers.

621
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,312
I will set it up.

622
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,937
If bhai comes to know he will kill us.

623
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,812
I know bhai is not at home.
so I brought you here.

624
00:37:55,895 --> 00:37:56,853
Our work is with dimple.

625
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:58,270
Dimple.. who is that ?

626
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:02,437
Not possible for me. Cannot do
these ten lack and 25 lacks settlements.

627
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:02,978
Not that sir, Bhai sir.

628
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:05,520
Hey! Who is Bhai, man?

Hey, hey what man?
Put the garland to me as it is heavy?

633
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:15,020

Hang on him after he returns.

634
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:17,228
We brought for you only sir.

635
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:18,520

Why sir? Fans are only for Chiranjeevi?

00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,312
Fans for Venkatesh Babu only?
Not for Suresh Babu?

641
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,978
Devotees for only Rama?
Not for Anjaneya?

642
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,728
Oh! Can be there, means?

643
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,353
Bhai becoming so much great today,
Is the reason not your brain sir?

644
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:42,312
People may not know what
really happened, but we know sir.

645
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:44,228
Let it be man!
At least you have recognized.

646
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:47,312
That is why sir, we became fans
for your face, Slaves to your brain.

647
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:50,645
Just like your brain, we used
our brain and put small ventures.

648
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,312
Like how we give share in profits to God
of Tirupati, we too will give you so.

649
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:56,062
Ten lacks was left to us in our
first venture. Here is your ten percent.

650
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,145

00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:03,770
That is Son-in-law Seenu sir.

00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:05,437
Son-in-law Seenu? What is that name man?

654
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,353
Why sir? When mother Rajasekhar,
brother Satyam exists..

655
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:08,687

Oh! They call you son?

659
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,020

690
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:18,562
Okay sir, I will look into that.

691
00:40:18,687 --> 00:40:19,353
Okay.
- Will leave, sir.

692
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:20,270
Ok..

693
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:28,520
Where are all these customers gone?

694
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:53,981
Wow! What a tempting personality!

695
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:57,108
What is the need for tests?
- I will blindly marry him.

696
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:58,555
Shut up!

697
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:00,808
I do not even buy car
without taking test drive..

698
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,805
..so why will I commit
in marrying the boy.

699
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,608
Hi, Ms. Anjali! Hi girls!
- Hi!

700
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,367
Why are you late?
- Sorry.

701
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,015
Heavy traffics..

702
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:12,261
Traffics?

703
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,451
What traffics like graphics?

704
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:17,182
Sir, you are cracking jokes
in english, they do not understand.

705
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:18,675
It means too much of traffic.

706
00:41:18,755 --> 00:41:19,894
Yes, yes. Traffic.

707
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:21,689
Anyway, there should
be some sense of humour.

708
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:24,389
Oh, there should be
some time too along with it.

709
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,294
Correct, correct.
By the way, he is driver, right?

710
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:28,172
Why is doing over action?
- He is not just driver..

711
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,600
..he is my childish friend too.
- Childish friend?

712
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:33,392
Again english joke?
- Yes.

713
00:41:33,472 --> 00:41:34,518
We are childhood friends..

714
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:36,956
..I mean we grew up together
by eating from the same dish.

715
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,200
That is why child dish, childish.

716
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,627
Wow! What a sense of humour?
- Bad joke.

717
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,203
Come, you have to eat paani puri.

718
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:46,505
Paani puri means?

719
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:47,806
I know paani and puri..

720
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,079
..but I do not know how
it looks when both are mixed.

721
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,305
How will you know, sir?
You grew up in foreign.

722
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:54,817
Yes, yes. Anyway, what is
this eating after calling for tests?

723
00:41:54,897 --> 00:41:56,694
Matching of our tastes is also a test.

724
00:41:56,774 --> 00:41:58,719
I like such simple things.

725
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,542
Will you eat or not?
- Let us eat.

726
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:02,878
This is puri.
- Puri is big, right?

727
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,791
Why is it small?
Did they make it with low budget?

728
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:06,383
Puri will be of this size only
in paani puri.

729
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,208
Giri, how nice it is! How cute it is!

730
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:10,809
It is so funny, sir.
- Look..

731
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:13,191
..you have to eat this.
- That is it? It is so simple.

732
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:15,765
Wait, I am giving you five chances.

733
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:18,520
You have to eat without even a single
drop of water spilling out of paani puri.

734
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:21,039
At least one. Start.
- Okay. - Sir!

735
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,558
Will you eat paani puri in
this pollution? Is it necessity?

736
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:25,616
Giri, solution for my marriage
is important than pollution.

737
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:27,149
I worship you, sir.

738
00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:34,194
Giri, it is very difficult.

739
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:35,599
How well you are acting!

740
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:40,019
Ms. Anjali, they are very sensitive.

741
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:42,538
Mad girl!

742
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:51,414
Sir, I think chances are getting over.

743
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,440
Cool.

744
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:04,321
Ms. Anjali, I passed.
Is the marriage confirmed?

745
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:06,282
What? Will I marry
just for paani puri?

746
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:08,077
So should I do Panipat battle?

747
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:09,326
No. Come.

748
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:18,944
What is this green balls? - Sir, they
are not balls, they are watermelons.

749
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:20,577
I mean watermelons.
- Watermelons?

750
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:22,235
Watermelons are red. Is not it, Giri?

751
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:24,187
They look green but if you cut them,
they are red.

752
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:25,817
Is it?
- Wow!

753
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,429
It is red inside, Giri!

754
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:29,325
What a wonder!
- Nature, sir.

755
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:32,270
Poor guy! He does not even
know how water melon looks.

756
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,992
What should I do now, Ms. Anjali?

757
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,255
It is enough if you eat once piece.
Three chances.

758
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:39,067
Red should not be seen and not even a
single piece should fall down. Start.

759
00:43:39,296 --> 00:43:41,730
Very difficult, Ms. Anjali.
I think it might fall down.

760
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,881
All my tests will
be difficult like this.

761
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:51,265
Giri! - Sir.
- I ate.

762
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,138
It is like a half moon.
- It is beautiful, sir.

763
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:56,493
Good, I liked your determination.
- Thanks. - Next test.

764
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:58,343
Auto!

765
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:03,355
Why are you watching like that?

766
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,874
No! I can not believe this!

767
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:08,009
What happened, sir?
- How come it has only three wheels?

768
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:09,282
Where is the fourth wheel?

769
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:11,545
Sir, auto has only three wheels.

770
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,138
So how will it balance?

771
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,583
Did not you see auto till now?

772
00:44:15,663 --> 00:44:17,947
He does not know about autos,
he knows only about automatic cars.

773
00:44:18,027 --> 00:44:19,257
It is a poor man's vehicle, sir.

774
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:22,142
Is it? It is like erecting
a tent on scooter? - Stop it!

775
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:23,993
You find my auto strange..

776
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:25,816
..and I find your words
too equally strange.

777
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:27,520
Get in, let us go.
- Sir.

778
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,748
Stop. Sit in front.

779
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:36,290
Wow! What a breeze!
Did you open the doors for wind?

780
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:38,700
See the road.
- I know.

781
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,264
You said you do not know auto,
how did you start?

782
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:48,942
I mean it is bothering
me near the legs..

783
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,571
..so I pulled it to throw it out
and thereby it started.

784
00:44:50,651 --> 00:44:53,420
My God! Is it used to start?
Such a big key?

785
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,895
Do not you really know what auto is?
- You first drive.

786
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:07,305
Thank God!
You brought us safely. How much?

787
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:09,485
100.
- Only three per seat?

788
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:11,455
Are we from share auto?

789
00:45:11,535 --> 00:45:12,747
Did you find out?

790
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:14,698
No, I confirmed it.
I got doubt earlier.

791
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,784
Brother, had you used
this intelligence on yourself..

792
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:19,239
..than me then you would
have been driving a Benz car by now.

793
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:20,961
Very sad! You ended up with auto!

794
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:23,480
Make payment.

795
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,856
This is how you are
cheating rich girls.

796
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:31,824
They are not innocent. Once they fall,
they will squeeze us. Telling stories..

797
00:45:33,904 --> 00:45:36,643
My God! Why are there so many people?

798
00:45:36,723 --> 00:45:38,063
Why are they fighting like that?

799
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:40,197
They are not fighting,
they are buying.

800
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:42,213
Should they fight for buying?

801
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:43,422
This is a bazar.

802
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:46,958
You should go and bring four dozen
bangles from that last Salim Bangles shop.

803
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:48,653
That is it?
- No.

804
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:51,648
You are failed even if one bangle
gets broken by the time you come here.

805
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:54,543
It is fine that you asked for bangles.
What is this bang again?

806
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:57,437
Poor guy! We too cannot bring
without breaking them in this crowd.

807
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:58,697
Impossible.

808
00:45:58,777 --> 00:46:01,418
It is impossible
to impress Anjali too.

809
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:03,240
Start.
- Sir!

810
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,063
Sir, I think you might get crushed.

811
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:09,217
Inevitable! I am ready to
do any sacrifice to satisfy her.

812
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:10,252
Sir!

813
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:15,684
Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

814
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:18,432
See how he is going
like a black ticket seller.

815
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:21,880
Hey, baby! Come home tonight.

816
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,866
We will eat biryani
and have fun on bed.

817
00:46:25,406 --> 00:46:28,768
Shameless! - Sir, why are you creating
nuisance in front of the shop?

818
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:30,354
What do you want?

819
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:32,396
Why do not you tell if you do not like?

820
00:46:32,476 --> 00:46:34,696
Why are you putting him in trouble?
- My goodness!

821
00:46:34,776 --> 00:46:36,161
See there!

822
00:46:43,603 --> 00:46:45,352
Now you can prepare for marriage.

823
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:48,430
He is winning every
time and hurting my ego.

824
00:46:58,027 --> 00:47:00,454
Why did you see my waist?
- I did not see.

825
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,433
No, you had seen.

826
00:47:02,717 --> 00:47:03,889
I am saying I did not see.

827
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:05,419
No, you have seen it, I saw you.

828
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:07,572
I am saying I did not see.
Do not you understand?

829
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:09,101
What is it? What happened?

830
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:11,984
He saw my waist.
- Hey! What is your nagging?

831
00:47:12,064 --> 00:47:16,024
I am saying I did not see. - In 'Khushi'
movie Pawan Kalyan too had seen..

832
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:18,681
..and lied like you saying
he did not see. - Ms. Anjali.

833
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:20,943
He is hero, this person is villain.

834
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:22,980
He is saying he did not see.
What is the need to quarrel?

835
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,157
Let us go. - So will you
believe his words or mine? - Hey!

836
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:30,959
I remained calm by thinking
why should I bother a rich girl.

837
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:32,727
You provoked me.

838
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:36,415
Now I will catch.
Will he do something?

839
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,166
No, brother. She said it for fun.

840
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,263
I too will fulfill my fun.

841
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:51,011
No, brother. I did not touch till now.

842
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:52,321
Is it?

843
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,071
So my hand is good, brother.

844
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:55,744
I will do the opening.

845
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:04,905
Please, brother. No fights.

846
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:12,105
Now see,
not even one bangle will remain.

847
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,576
Sir, are you hurt?

848
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,152
They got hurt.
- Of course.

849
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,478
Others will only
get hurt all the time.

850
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:32,736
Check them, none of them is broken.

851
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:35,548
So did I pass all the tests?

852
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:39,102
You reached semi-finals. I
will finalize after you reach finals.

853
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,733
Wait for my call.

854
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,937
Brother, I had seen
many test matches but..

855
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,705
..so many tests for one match?

856
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:47,610
Once I consider it mine..

857
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:50,212
..I am ready for any number of tests.

858
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:19,134
Greetings, Bhai. Come.

859
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:40,293
Brother, let us kill him.

860
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:43,481
No. Killing him is important..

861
00:51:44,804 --> 00:51:47,488
..and also our staying alive.

862
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:49,173
He might escape today.

863
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,553
He cannot escape tomorrow.
- Brother..

864
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:56,610
Do not feel sad. We will kill him.

865
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:01,263
God!
- Dad, did you call me?

866
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:03,965
Rohit, Bole Baba has fixed the date.

867
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:06,457
You go to India tomorrow
and bring Anjali.

868
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:09,246
Her family too will come with you.
- Okay, dad.

869
00:52:18,362 --> 00:52:19,507
Hi, girls!
- Hi!

870
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:20,955
Hi, Mrs. Anjali.

871
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:23,968
Why are you looking dull, Mrs. Anjali?

872
00:52:24,048 --> 00:52:25,800
That is why she called you.

873
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,771
What happened?

874
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:30,627
Anjali had two best friends
Catherine and Sanjana from childhood.

875
00:52:30,707 --> 00:52:34,511
Three of them decided to attend every
occasion related to each of them.

876
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:37,169
But Catherine is getting
married today afternoon in Kerala..

877
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:39,156
..and in the evening Sanjana's
delivery is due in Jodhpur.

878
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:40,897
She is suffering in between, right?

879
00:52:40,977 --> 00:52:41,996
Do not take it easily.

880
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:43,956
Both are at extreme ends of India.

881
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,814
We will remain at the
start until we do not start off.

882
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:49,571
But how?
Since we cannot satisfy both so..

883
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:51,540
..daddy said to say sorry
to each of them and leave it.

884
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,986
Leave about him,
I will take you. Okay?

885
00:52:54,188 --> 00:52:55,773
Really? But how.

886
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:56,682
Chartered flight?

887
00:52:56,762 --> 00:52:59,027
Yes, sir.
Big contract. I have to go urgently.

888
00:52:59,107 --> 00:53:01,766
I understood.
You are earning in crores..

889
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,561
..and throwing lakhs at me.

890
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,375
Is not it? - No, sir.
You will receive big amount from this.

891
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:08,097
How? - Sir, I love a girl.

892
00:53:08,177 --> 00:53:10,158
Sir, flight is required
if she were to love me.

893
00:53:10,238 --> 00:53:12,531
I did not ask about flight,
I asked about the share.

894
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:14,344
Sir, I mean she is very rich.

895
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,746
Who is that girl?

896
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,284
Think she is Bhai's daughter.

897
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:19,786
Bhai's daughter?

898
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:21,810
Sir, I mean she is rich like him.

899
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,311
You will get half of the
property after I get everything.

900
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:26,345
I had never seen a fast fan like you..

901
00:53:26,425 --> 00:53:27,921
..even in the past.

902
00:53:28,001 --> 00:53:30,311
Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Raghuramraju..

903
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,197
..his personal flights and power
plants. He is our client. -Okay.

904
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,220
Hello, Mr. Raju. I am Dimple speaking.

905
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,409
Tell me. - I want a
chartered flight urgently.

906
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:39,507
Bhai's personal guy.
- Who is he?

907
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:41,348
Son-in-law.
- What? Son-in-law?

908
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:42,997
I mean, think as son-in-law.

909
00:53:43,077 --> 00:53:45,647
Okay, I will arrange. - Thank you, sir.
Your work is finished.

910
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:47,067
Thank you, sir.
- Hey!

911
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:48,890
Why are you going
by saying thank you, sir?

912
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,612
You have to pay me the
flight payment of three lakhs.

913
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:52,737
I will send in one hour,
girl is waiting over there.

914
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:54,221
Do not leave the girl.

915
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:55,530
Sir, I will not leave.

916
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:59,468
I should squeeze him properly.
I will squeeze.

917
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,239
Greetings, sir. Welcome.
- Thanks.

918
00:54:06,027 --> 00:54:08,043
Arrangements are ready inside.
- Right, right.

919
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:09,920
He and his stupid english.

920
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:12,412
Wow!

921
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:17,554
Thank you so much.
- It is not finished, there is still more.

922
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:34,186
Gift.
- Why?

923
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:35,688
How can you attend the
marriage in this dress, Anjali?

924
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:38,470
You are giving lot of surprises.
Thank you.

925
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:22,676
Daniel and Catherine..

926
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:26,560
Will you honour each other as man
and wife for the rest of your lives?

927
00:55:26,926 --> 00:55:27,796
I will.

928
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:31,154
Daniel, do you accept
Catherine as your wife?

929
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:32,940
Yes, I do.

930
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,027
Catherine,
do you accept Daniel as your husband?

931
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:38,876
Catherine. Catherine!

932
00:55:54,902 --> 00:55:56,441
Congratulations!

933
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:58,877
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you so much, Anjali!

934
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:02,040
Do not say thanks to me, say it to him.
I could come because of him.

935
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,724
She said it is your wife. I thought
what gift should I bring you..

936
00:56:04,804 --> 00:56:06,162
..and finally brought
your friend as gift.

937
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:08,333
This is the best gift
of my life you know.

938
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:13,722
Happy married life!

939
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:51,345
Anjali?

940
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,490
Come.

941
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:00,217
Congratulations!
- Thank you, Anjali.

942
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,640
Did you attend Catherine's marriage?

943
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,307
I attended.
- Did you attend?

944
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,285
Yes. How did you
go there and come here?

945
00:57:05,707 --> 00:57:07,035
He took me..

946
00:57:07,115 --> 00:57:08,372
..and brought me.

947
00:57:16,011 --> 00:57:17,596
Thank you.
- Congrats.

948
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,179
You gave me a memorable gift,
you know.

949
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:23,638
Who is he?

950
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:25,937
My would be.

951
00:57:31,894 --> 00:57:36,337
"Everybody in the house!
Say yay! Yay! Yay!"

952
00:57:36,685 --> 00:57:41,458
"Everybody in the house!
Say yay! Yay! Yay!"

953
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:45,657
"Mache! Mache!
Mache! Mache! Mache! Mache!"

954
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:50,732
"Mache! Mache!
Mache! Mache! Mache! Mache!"

955
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:54,341
"Hey, like a dynamite of hundred
tons blasting inside the heart.."

956
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:59,196
"Like hitting a century in one ball.."

957
00:58:00,937 --> 00:58:03,291
"Life is suffering like this."

958
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:05,859
"Arrow seems to have
pierced the heart."

959
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:08,259
"Life is suffering like this."

960
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,723
"Arrow seems to have
pierced the heart."

961
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:16,094
"O girl, you have increased
my heart beat. What to do?"

962
00:58:17,945 --> 00:58:20,226
"Oh God!"

963
00:58:20,306 --> 00:58:22,736
"What is this chaos?"

964
00:58:22,816 --> 00:58:24,586
"Oh God!"

965
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:27,797
"What is this chaos?"

966
00:58:28,429 --> 00:58:31,342
"Like the entire rain
from clouds falling in tub.."

967
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,299
"Like the heat from
the pub making us crazy.."

968
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:40,430
"Beauty is playing madly."

969
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,986
"Mirror has broken suddenly."

970
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:48,399
"My night has become bright
as if there is light. What to do?"

971
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,228
"Oh God!"

972
00:58:52,476 --> 00:58:54,097
"What is this chaos?"

973
00:58:54,986 --> 00:58:57,351
"Oh God!"

974
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:15,341
"What is this chaos?"

975
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:20,326
"Everybody in the house!
Say yay! Yay! Yay!"

976
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,361
"To measure the heat
inside this body.."

977
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:30,608
"Thermometer of kilometer
length is required."

978
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:34,831
"To write the words of lips.."

979
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:38,028
"..white paper of the size
of White House is required."

980
00:59:39,898 --> 00:59:42,628
"To hide the.."

981
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,074
"..love inside the heart.."

982
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:47,639
"To hide the love inside the heart.."

983
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:50,136
"Entire world should come together."

984
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:56,722
"You have increased my pulse
rate to dollar rate. What to do?"

985
00:59:56,942 --> 00:59:59,149
"Oh God!"

986
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:01,470
"What is this chaos?"

987
01:00:01,773 --> 01:00:04,191
"Oh God!"

988
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,353
"What is this chaos?"

989
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:47,922
"Even if I forget my date of birth.."

990
01:00:48,096 --> 01:00:51,036
"..I will not forget the
date of meeting you first."

991
01:00:52,956 --> 01:00:55,365
"Even if I forget my own name.."

992
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:58,471
"..I will never forget
your cell phone number."

993
01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:02,602
"Even if my life.."

994
01:01:03,148 --> 01:01:05,383
"..leave me.."

995
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,058
"Even if my life leaves me.."

996
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:10,513
"I will not leave
the hand that I hold."

997
01:01:10,593 --> 01:01:15,765
"You have become like the
password of laptop. What to do?"

998
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,017
"Oh God!"

999
01:01:19,741 --> 01:01:21,820
"What is this chaos?"

1000
01:01:22,232 --> 01:01:24,622
"Oh God!"

1001
01:01:24,702 --> 01:01:27,718
"What is this chaos?"

1002
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:43,645
What is this money given by you to me?

1003
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:45,395
Yes sir! I gave it to you.

1004
01:01:45,562 --> 01:01:47,395
If required, see this cctv footage.

1005
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,729
Is he still alive?

1006
01:01:57,312 --> 01:01:58,312
Have you given money to him?

1007
01:01:58,395 --> 01:01:59,979
What he sir? It is you, right?

1008
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,770
You mean, gave the money to me?

1009
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,020
You means, to the boy with you sir.

1010
01:02:15,187 --> 01:02:15,937
Who is that boy?

1011
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:17,687
- That is, that boy, to you..
- Hey.

1012
01:02:18,895 --> 01:02:19,979
You do not talk..

1013
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:22,354
..answer to what I asked.

1014
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,312
Who is that boy?

1015
01:02:24,395 --> 01:02:25,145
Son-in-law of Dimple sir.

1016
01:02:25,229 --> 01:02:26,354
We met him here in this house.

1017
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:28,270
Dimple!

1018
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:31,062
'He is a bullet six feet tall"

1019
01:02:33,062 --> 01:02:36,062
"He is like a rocket"

1020
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:40,729
What man?
You became direct to Bhai sir?

1021
01:02:41,354 --> 01:02:43,729
Sir! You should not encourage
them like this sir.

1022
01:02:43,937 --> 01:02:45,312
It is better for you to follow protocol.

1023
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:49,562
Who is this boy?

1024
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,020
He is my fan sir.

1025
01:02:51,854 --> 01:02:52,937
Fan for you?

1026
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:56,020
What sir? You say fans for me?
Should we not have fans?

1027
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,145
But, it is not right to
make my fans move behind you sir.

1028
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:00,312
What is his name, man?

1029
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:01,729
Son-in-law sir.

1030
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,562
What?

1031
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,979
That is, Son-in-law Seenu sir.

1032
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:04,854
Son-in-law Seenu.

1033
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:05,479
What is this name man?

1034
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:06,562
Why not it should be sir?

1035
01:03:06,937 --> 01:03:08,812
When Mother Rajasekhar,
Brother Satyam exists.

1036
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:10,145
Why can Son-in-law Seenu be there sir?

1037
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:14,104
Where do all these stay?

1038
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:16,520
What will stars know,
where would fans be sir?

1039
01:03:16,604 --> 01:03:17,979
Kill you.

1040
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:20,937
Do you know who he is? Big cheater!

1041
01:03:21,645 --> 01:03:24,854
Creating one like me, making
you a fool he is looting the money.

1042
01:03:25,687 --> 01:03:28,020
Hey! Go and search the entire city man!

1043
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,645
I want all these,
including that duplicate.

1044
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:33,104
Okay sir. Move man.

1045
01:03:47,479 --> 01:03:49,270
Ouch!

1046
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:50,812
How much he give you? Huh.

1047
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,937
Put the garland and gave a lakh sir.

1048
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:56,395
Sir.

1049
01:03:56,645 --> 01:03:58,229
How much would they have collected sir?

1050
01:03:58,604 --> 01:03:59,437
Means, Shall I tell you accounts?

1051
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,979
Ha.. no sir.. Ouch!

1052
01:04:04,793 --> 01:04:06,229
Take this!
- Hi, uncle!

1053
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:09,520
Hey Rohit, Come, come, come.

1054
01:04:09,687 --> 01:04:10,854
Why are you feeling tense?

1055
01:04:11,145 --> 01:04:13,145
Nothing..

1056
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:15,937
This idiot has
unnecessarily troubled me.

1057
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:16,854
Why could you not kill him?

1058
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,645
Will you kill?

1059
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,520
Leave his issue. Good you came.

1060
01:04:20,895 --> 01:04:21,687
Anjali!

1061
01:04:24,562 --> 01:04:25,812
Your would be Rohit.

1062
01:04:27,479 --> 01:04:28,270
Hi Anjali!

1063
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:31,645
Though you have not seen me till now,
I saw you many times in videos.

1064
01:04:31,854 --> 01:04:34,520
Uncle sends each of
your videos to my dad.

1065
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,562
Daddy! One minute.

1066
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,229
What happened girl?

1067
01:04:38,729 --> 01:04:39,854
I am confused.

1068
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,229
Is he Rohit?

1069
01:04:41,437 --> 01:04:41,937
Yes.

1070
01:04:42,229 --> 01:04:42,895
He is Rohit.

1071
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:46,187
Then, who was that with
you in the mall that day?

1072
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:47,437
Yes, what if there?

1073
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:49,437
He said was Rohit.

1074
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,937
I, I liked him dad.

1075
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:53,770
Means, Whoever is beside me,
will he become Rohit?

1076
01:04:54,229 --> 01:04:55,145
Will you love that guy?

1077
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:56,687
Sorry daddy!

1078
01:04:56,812 --> 01:04:57,895
He is a big cheater.

1079
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,770
He has not just you,
cheated many more saying my name.

1080
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:03,145
Give his phone number.

1081
01:05:04,812 --> 01:05:06,270
You, give the phone number.

1082
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,395
No dad. I do not have.

1083
01:05:08,479 --> 01:05:09,812
Seen, how cheat he is.

1084
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,479
He is taken care by not giving
his phone number and address to anyone.

1085
01:05:14,145 --> 01:05:15,812
Let him come in hands that bloody.

1086
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:19,020
Anjali, listen to what I say Anjali.

1087
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:22,812
I, who does not believe men
at all have believed you first time.

1088
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:25,062
I thought you are not like all.

1089
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,520
Why have you cheated me so much?

1090
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:28,020
Listen coolly to what I say.

1091
01:05:28,187 --> 01:05:29,854
What would you say, one more lie?

1092
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:32,812
I have not given your number
when my dad asked. Do you know why?

1093
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:36,312
Few memories were left unforgettable
in my life because of you.

1094
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:38,937
Else, he would have killed you.

1095
01:05:39,229 --> 01:05:41,312
I may have said lies
to get closer to you.

1096
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:42,937
But, my love is true, Anjali.

1097
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,562
Please, enough now.

1098
01:05:45,062 --> 01:05:47,520
Run away anywhere.
You will at least remain in life.

1099
01:05:48,437 --> 01:05:51,854
Never ever try to either
meet or talk to me.

1100
01:05:52,312 --> 01:05:53,062
Anjali.

1101
01:06:19,395 --> 01:06:20,020
Hey..

1102
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:24,312
..she has not listened to what I said.
She slapped me tight on me cheeks.

1103
01:06:25,354 --> 01:06:26,645
Felt like to die.

1104
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:28,895
All girls in city are like this Seenu.

1105
01:06:29,104 --> 01:06:30,270
They will not fall if you tell facts.

1106
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,020
If put in trap by not telling,
they say cheaters.

1107
01:06:32,104 --> 01:06:33,020
What is this bullshit?

1108
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:35,270
Hey, hey what is this?
- Good evening sir.

1109
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:36,437
Anjali.

1110
01:06:36,812 --> 01:06:37,770
Anjali.

1111
01:06:37,854 --> 01:06:39,062
Why has he fallen drunk?

1112
01:06:39,145 --> 01:06:43,437
Sir, Seenu is deeply hurted in love.
So, automatically we all are hurted.

1113
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:45,020
Love? Who is that girl?

1114
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,270
Daughter of Bhai.

1115
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:48,645
Poor girl, she has not understood well.

1116
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:50,395
Saying cheater she slapped and left.

1117
01:06:51,562 --> 01:06:52,729
Hit and left? Hey!

1118
01:06:53,437 --> 01:06:54,354
Who exactly is that Bhai?

1119
01:06:54,437 --> 01:06:56,395
Bhai means Same to same.

1120
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:59,395
Bhai means a big head in city.

1121
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:01,520
Big head?

1122
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:03,437
So?

1123
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,937
Hey, Auto, auto!

1124
01:07:15,142 --> 01:07:16,520
Hold on.. Hold on.

1125
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,895
Sir, I am new to this city.
Some Bhai it seems, need to meet him.

1126
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:22,895
Get in, We too are going to him.

1127
01:07:29,187 --> 01:07:30,145
He is Bhai.

1128
01:07:34,062 --> 01:07:34,895
Go.

1129
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,062
Namsate sir.

1130
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:49,062
My name is Narsimha.

1131
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:51,104
I have to talk..
- Tell.

1132
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,854
You?

1133
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:58,229
Bhai means you?

1134
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:02,020
Hello, I should be shocked
as you are alive, why are you shocked?

1135
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:04,270
Then, Is it your daughter
that my Seenu has loved?

1136
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,937
Who is this Seenu guy?

1137
01:08:06,479 --> 01:08:08,145
Hey! You cheated me a lot man..

1138
01:08:08,979 --> 01:08:10,687
..made me without life.

1139
01:08:11,312 --> 01:08:13,395
Thought to die thinking it my fate..

1140
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:17,270
..but a small kid has given
me the courage and made me live.

1141
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:20,770
He is Seenu. He is very good.

1142
01:08:21,354 --> 01:08:23,395
He will take good care of your daughter.

1143
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:26,604
Hey, I have not done anything to him.

1144
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,395
If you want I will go long
from you and vanish.

1145
01:08:31,895 --> 01:08:34,020
But, you give your daughter
to him in marriage.

1146
01:08:34,562 --> 01:08:35,604
He is gold, man!

1147
01:08:40,645 --> 01:08:43,812
Not just you,
even the innocence in you has not died.

1148
01:08:44,312 --> 01:08:47,895
What we need to talk here
is not about marriages, about deaths.

1149
01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:50,562
Hey, get them here.

1150
01:08:57,312 --> 01:08:58,354
Hey Yadi!

1151
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:05,812
Narsimha brother! Narsimha brother!
Are you alive? Are you alive brother?

1152
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:06,812
Yes man!

1153
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:10,229
But, what is all this?
How are you all here?

1154
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,562
Brother! Need to tell you one thing.
Your daughter has not died, she is alive.

1155
01:09:15,354 --> 01:09:17,895
What man? What are you telling?

1156
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:21,687
Yes brother! Growing at him
is your daughter. Our Anjali baby!

1157
01:09:23,395 --> 01:09:25,520
Hey! Is what they say is a truth?

1158
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,937
Is my daughter alive?

1159
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:31,437
Where is my Anjali, man?
Where is my Anjali?

1160
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,229
She is there.

1161
01:09:32,854 --> 01:09:35,479
What would you do knowing
about living ones before dying? Hah!

1162
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:16,604
Hey! To help, once there was
no Sugreevs in this life of Rama.

1163
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:19,455
But, he is there now.
My Son-in-law is there. Look man, Son!

1164
01:11:19,645 --> 01:11:20,895
Hello.
- Uncle!

1165
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:25,354
Our flight take off permission has come.
We are all in airport. Where are you?

1166
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:26,562
I am coming.

1167
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:46,312
Son-in-law.. hey! Son-in-law!

1168
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:47,104
Hey.

1169
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,562
Brother!

1170
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:52,645
Tie even him along with
all and burn all of them.

1171
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:53,937
Ok boss..

1172
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:56,854
Son.

1173
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:25,335
'Liquor drinking
is injurious to health.'

1174
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:28,349
'Smoking causes cancer.
Smoking kills.'

1175
01:12:43,897 --> 01:12:44,522
Hello.

1176
01:12:44,814 --> 01:12:45,314
Brother.

1177
01:12:45,397 --> 01:12:46,022
What happened?

1178
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:08,731
He is taken his men and escaped.

1179
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:10,022
Hey!

1180
01:13:10,272 --> 01:13:11,814
They should not live.

1181
01:13:12,106 --> 01:13:15,231
By the time Anjali gets married and
I come back, I want their dead bodies.

1182
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:17,064
What is this uncle? What is all this?

1183
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,356
You said have no body.
Is Bhai your brother?

1184
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,522
Ours is Nalgonda district.

1185
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,231
Siripuram village.

1186
01:13:24,564 --> 01:13:26,564
The money in the name
was not in the village.

1187
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:32,481
The fluoride problem had
taken happiness in our lives.

1188
01:13:33,564 --> 01:13:35,106
What can I do Narsimha sir?

1189
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:37,731
As you would do anything sir,
people have believed and voted you sir.

1190
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:40,022
Added you became the
Minister for the district.

1191
01:13:40,606 --> 01:13:43,397
Narsimha sir,
Do you not think I have no pain.

1192
01:13:46,731 --> 01:13:51,231
This is the fluoride plant plan.
To put this, it costs 50 crores.

1193
01:13:51,564 --> 01:13:54,106
I made the Government
agree to invest 50%..

1194
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:56,564
..who would put the rest 50%.

1195
01:13:57,981 --> 01:13:59,022
We will put.

1196
01:14:01,314 --> 01:14:05,397
My Father-in-law has given
huge property along with his daughter.

1197
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:10,231
His soul will be happy if
I spend it for the good of ten.

1198
01:14:10,397 --> 01:14:11,981
Thus, I will give Twenty crores
from the property..

1199
01:14:12,606 --> 01:14:14,731
..he is given to put the fluoride plant.

1200
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:17,147
You also give whatever you feel..

1201
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:19,064
..all our children should be happy.

1202
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:30,314
He is not even considered
as brother and put me in jail.

1203
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:32,772
He will not give a single penny..

1204
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:35,064
..but is selling his entire property
for the village.

1205
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:37,439
It would have been good
to kill him and come to jail.

1206
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:40,272
You should not tell at others and cry.

1207
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:43,772
Pulling it is the manliness.

1208
01:14:43,856 --> 01:14:46,689
What should I pull sitting in Jail?
Except the whitened hairs.

1209
01:14:46,772 --> 01:14:49,814
If you give partnership,
I will give the idea.

1210
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:51,356
I am ready.

1211
01:14:57,147 --> 01:14:59,397
Boss, it is 25 crores.. be careful.

1212
01:14:59,481 --> 01:15:01,022
Why be afraid? I got security.

1213
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:04,022
I will go to God at Temple and then
meet the Minister to handover the money.

1214
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:06,356
You be here and take care that the meeting
of executive officer is done. Okay!

1215
01:15:06,939 --> 01:15:08,022
Hi!

1216
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,397
Nandini.

1217
01:15:29,356 --> 01:15:30,314
Anjali.

1218
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:32,356
Anjali.

1219
01:15:32,897 --> 01:15:33,856
Anjali.

1220
01:15:34,356 --> 01:15:35,356
Anjali.

1221
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:43,647
Anjali.

1222
01:16:01,397 --> 01:16:03,272
What man, Are Anjali
and your sister-in-law dead?

1223
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:06,647
What would you alone do living brother?
You too die.

1224
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:11,064
Now, I will make the villagers believe
that you killed your wife and daughter..

1225
01:16:11,147 --> 01:16:13,606
..and eloped with the money collected.

1226
01:16:14,022 --> 01:16:18,522
Instead of dying in the hands of Police
and villagers, better die here man!

1227
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:32,522
Sir! Narsimha has killed the security
people and eloped taking all the money.

1228
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:33,106
Is it?

1229
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:34,397
Stop him! Catch.

1230
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:42,356
Narasimha.

1231
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:46,606
As he looks like me, police by seeing me
have believed that I eloped with money.

1232
01:16:47,856 --> 01:16:50,064
They arrested our people.
Made people hate them.

1233
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:53,254
Reading all these in papers,
as I do not have any..

1234
01:16:53,587 --> 01:16:58,921
..proofs to show me innocent
and left all alone thought to die.

1235
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:02,046
You just then came in to my life.

1236
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:02,796
What about Anjali then?

1237
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:05,046
Brother does not know about Anjali.
I will tell.

1238
01:17:17,296 --> 01:17:19,212
Hey, you came in, we are going out.

1239
01:17:20,296 --> 01:17:21,754
We did it all.

1240
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:23,796
It was us who killed your friend.

1241
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:28,379
One more good news,
his daughter is alive it seems.

1242
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,796
She has huge property on her name..

1243
01:17:32,754 --> 01:17:33,879
..and even that is mine.

1244
01:17:34,712 --> 01:17:36,879
But I should grow her for 20 years.

1245
01:17:37,046 --> 01:17:37,754
I will.

1246
01:17:40,296 --> 01:17:41,212
Kid!

1247
01:17:41,878 --> 01:17:43,462
Your dad is very bad..

1248
01:17:43,754 --> 01:17:44,921
..killed mother.

1249
01:17:45,337 --> 01:17:47,337
Cheated the village
and eloped taking the money.

1250
01:17:47,421 --> 01:17:48,504
Uncle.

1251
01:17:49,796 --> 01:17:53,212
Not uncle kid, from today I am Daddy.

1252
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:54,296
Call me.

1253
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:55,254
Daddy.

1254
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,254
Daddy.

1255
01:17:56,337 --> 01:17:57,212
That means.

1256
01:17:57,379 --> 01:17:58,837
Is my daughter hating me?

1257
01:17:59,004 --> 01:17:59,712
Yes brother!

1258
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:01,629
He is grown her with
poison from childhood.

1259
01:18:01,837 --> 01:18:02,921
Means my daughter.

1260
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:06,921
Uncle, do not feel bad. I will
make your hating daughter love you.

1261
01:18:07,004 --> 01:18:09,337
I will get 10 times of the
money back of what they looted.

1262
01:18:09,421 --> 01:18:12,754
To the village you had gone far, I will
make that entire village come to you.

1263
01:18:12,837 --> 01:18:13,421
How?

1264
01:18:13,587 --> 01:18:16,171
All have gone to Sharjah.
Marriage is fixed there for Anjali too.

1265
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:18,837
Marriage is fixed by them.
I will tie the knot.

1266
01:18:19,129 --> 01:18:20,296
Shift to Sharjah!

1267
01:18:35,171 --> 01:18:36,587
Who is here man? Hah, who?

1268
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,379
There is no one speaking Telugu?

1269
01:18:39,462 --> 01:18:40,837
Why sir? Shouting like that!

1270
01:18:40,921 --> 01:18:42,337
If not shouting, will we tell singing?

1271
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:43,504
No hot water inside.

1272
01:18:43,587 --> 01:18:45,254
It is Wednesday sir,
hot water will not be there.

1273
01:18:45,337 --> 01:18:46,879
If it is Wednesday, will hot
water not be there? What is that?

1274
01:18:46,962 --> 01:18:49,046
Yes sir! On Mondays
you should not take bath.

1275
01:18:49,254 --> 01:18:50,712
On Tuesday, should not eat mutton.

1276
01:18:50,796 --> 01:18:52,254
On Thursday, should eat eggs.

1277
01:18:52,337 --> 01:18:53,546
There will be one rule
for every day here, sir!

1278
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:55,004
Who has kept foolish rules man?

1279
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:55,837
It is us.

1280
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:57,212
Who are you?

1281
01:18:57,462 --> 01:18:59,504
If you are PA to Hyderabad Bhai,

1282
01:18:59,587 --> 01:19:00,962
I am PA to Sharjah Bhai.

1283
01:19:01,379 --> 01:19:03,796
Oh! Then we both are same to same.
Nice to see you

1284
01:19:03,879 --> 01:19:05,671
Sorry! We both are not same to same

1285
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:06,254
Why?

1286
01:19:06,337 --> 01:19:07,587
Is your rupee and our Dirham same?

1287
01:19:07,671 --> 01:19:10,004
With your rupee, not even water
bottle comes in our country.

1288
01:19:10,171 --> 01:19:12,129
With our Dirham,
full bottle comes in your country.

1289
01:19:12,337 --> 01:19:15,171
Oh! What is there in money sir,
even dogs would earn it.

1290
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:17,546
But only men earn Dirhams here.

1291
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:19,754
But still,
what are these foolish rules, sir?

1292
01:19:19,837 --> 01:19:20,796
Orders of our Boss.

1293
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:21,712
If we do not follow.

1294
01:19:21,796 --> 01:19:22,629
Said to bury.

1295
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:25,462
Venkat, Is Vaastu cleared for sir?

1296
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:26,462
Not yet sir.

1297
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:27,004
Do it.

1298
01:19:27,087 --> 01:19:28,504
What Vaastu? What clearance?

1299
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,462
Hah! What is this man, what?

1300
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:31,712
Stop, it will fall.

1301
01:19:31,796 --> 01:19:32,962
What, if it falls?

1302
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:36,087
Sir, North East is increased sir.

1303
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:37,546
Is North East, the stomach?

01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:38,921
It is increased even for you no man?

1305
01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:40,254
He can have, you should not have.

1306
01:19:40,462 --> 01:19:42,504
Venkat! Do not keep more
than one roti per day to this sir.

1307
01:19:42,587 --> 01:19:44,379
What is this torture when
we came for marriage, a good moment.

1308
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:45,546
Okay, what is your name?

1309

You go! I, myself will do some thing.

You do not roam semi nude like this.

1321
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:03,629
Why?

1322
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:05,671
There would be audience here
who likes personalities even like you.

1323
01:20:06,296 --> 01:20:07,879
He is not Peda, looks different.

1324
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:17,796

What happened? - This is a bad moment,

Why sir? We have many drivers with us.

1347
01:21:09,921 --> 01:21:11,004
I need to go alone.

Bhai is said everything. What now?

1369
01:22:34,504 --> 01:22:36,379

..to Sharjah from Hyderabad
in the last four, five days.

1382
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:05,962
I need the photo identification
of all those with address.

1383
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:07,462
Sure! I will send.

1384
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:10,504
Get me all the details
of the passengers..

1385
01:23:10,587 --> 01:23:13,212
..who travelled from Hyderabad
to Sharjah, the last one week.

1386
01:23:13,462 --> 01:23:14,087
Yes Sir.

1387
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:23,212
Stop Bhanu.
- Why?

1388
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:24,546
Do not move for 5 minutes.

1389
01:23:24,629 --> 01:23:25,171
Why Baba?

1390
01:23:25,254 --> 01:23:27,796
Saturn is entering into the Three steps.
Minutes are not good.

1391
01:23:27,879 --> 01:23:28,671
Saturn?

1392
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:29,629
Blue stone!

1393
01:23:30,546 --> 01:23:31,962
Uncle, why have stopped there only?

1394
01:23:32,171 --> 01:23:32,879
Come.

1395
01:23:32,962 --> 01:23:35,796
I should not come for 5 minutes baby.
Saturn is in 3rd step.

1396
01:23:36,462 --> 01:23:38,504
Stupid fellow.

1397
01:23:39,629 --> 01:23:40,754
Sir, please take this.

1398
01:23:40,837 --> 01:23:41,837
What is this?

1399
01:23:42,087 --> 01:23:43,129
Is it Thailand tailam?

1400
01:23:43,379 --> 01:23:44,504
Shall I apply this to the sirs body.

1401
01:23:44,712 --> 01:23:46,504
No, this is urine. give it in the lab.

1402
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:47,837
Shit. Urine?

1403
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:48,796
Hey Dimple!

1404
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:51,671
You say bloody to urine of my dad?
Give respect.

1405
01:23:51,754 --> 01:23:53,379
What respect to urine sir?

1406
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:56,087
Respect is not to urine.
That is to the person who passed it.

1407
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:58,421
Still, do not say urine always cheaply.

1408
01:23:58,629 --> 01:23:59,712
What should I say then sir?

1409
01:23:59,879 --> 01:24:01,712
Say susu, go to the lab.

1410
01:24:01,796 --> 01:24:02,712
Yes sir.

1411
01:24:04,212 --> 01:24:05,379
Coming, coming.

1412
01:24:05,962 --> 01:24:07,379
Dimple sir.

1413
01:24:08,254 --> 01:24:09,129
Oh god.

1414
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:12,546
You? You idiot! Why are you here?

1415
01:24:12,796 --> 01:24:14,337
That was the don's urine.

1416
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:16,754
Keep quiet sir! Is it any sacred
water or special? Let it go.

1417
01:24:16,837 --> 01:24:20,171
Tell if you want, all would give a bit.
It may match with someone.

1418
01:24:20,337 --> 01:24:22,754
Giving such cunning ideas
only you collapsed my place.

1419
01:24:23,046 --> 01:24:24,171
Why did you come back here again?

1420
01:24:24,254 --> 01:24:25,754
That is, to correct the mistake sir.

1421
01:24:25,837 --> 01:24:27,421
Came to correct? Or came to clash with?

1422
01:24:27,504 --> 01:24:29,004
We are saying the truth sir.
That duplicate guy..

1423
01:24:29,087 --> 01:24:30,962
..knowing that we are your
fans has used us cleverly.

1424
01:24:31,129 --> 01:24:33,921
Thus we cleverly came to know about
his next plan and followed till Sharjah.

1425
01:24:34,004 --> 01:24:36,046
He is the one doing
the accident to Bhai sir.

1426
01:24:36,129 --> 01:24:38,087
What? Is this accident by him?

1427
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:41,171
Yes sir! It was again Seenu who
admitted Bhai at hospital in time.

1428
01:24:41,254 --> 01:24:42,879
How many time should I believe
that what you say is true?

1429
01:24:42,962 --> 01:24:44,421
We know that you will
not believe by saying sir.

1430
01:24:44,504 --> 01:24:45,421
That is why,
we shall show you, come Sir.

1431
01:24:45,504 --> 01:24:46,171
What will you show?

1432
01:24:46,254 --> 01:24:47,254
You come sir!
- Okay, come on.

1433
01:24:54,754 --> 01:24:55,462
Who is he?

1434
01:24:55,546 --> 01:24:57,421
Duplicate Bhai sir Narsimha.

1435
01:24:57,629 --> 01:24:58,504
I will tell the matter to them.

1436
01:24:58,671 --> 01:25:00,712
Wait sir. How if you be so innocent sir?

1437
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:01,837
What man? What happened?

1438
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:05,046
May would die in war, but Paramaveera
Chakra will be given only to one sir.

1439
01:25:05,129 --> 01:25:06,546
What Paramaveera chakra man?
Tell clearly.

1440
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:08,712
Yes sir!
If you surrender him, maximum..

1441
01:25:08,796 --> 01:25:09,962
..they would pat your shoulder
and say well done.

1442
01:25:10,046 --> 01:25:12,004
What if we surrender
the 100 crores he looted?

1443
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:13,754
Paramveera Chakra will
be given put in flowers.

1444
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:16,629
What are you thinking sir?

1445
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:18,421
You are more mental than me..
- Sir.

1446
01:25:18,837 --> 01:25:19,587
Bloody fools man!

1447
01:25:19,671 --> 01:25:20,712
What sir? You have said like that?

1448
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:23,879
What if not man? What they giving
after collecting from him, man?

1449
01:25:24,087 --> 01:25:25,129
We shall loot it.

1450
01:25:25,212 --> 01:25:26,171
Paramaveera Chakra?

1451
01:25:26,296 --> 01:25:27,337
Will become a bit late man!

1452
01:25:27,462 --> 01:25:28,379
Yes.
- Sir.

1453
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,587
That is why you are
in this position sir.

1454
01:25:31,462 --> 01:25:34,004
Sir, Bhai has lived due to your fan.

1455
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:37,337
If this matter is known to anyone
your position and image, Oh God!

1456
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:40,296
True man! They are still thinking
that he is some Telugu person.

1457
01:25:40,504 --> 01:25:42,629
They should know that he was not there,
if my fan was not there.

1458
01:25:42,712 --> 01:25:43,754
You too come, man!
- Sir!

1459
01:25:43,962 --> 01:25:45,004
What should we do to him, then sir?

1460
01:25:45,421 --> 01:25:46,421
What should we?

1461
01:25:46,587 --> 01:25:47,754
Better if he is in your control sir.

1462
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:48,962
Very good idea!

1463
01:25:49,212 --> 01:25:51,046
We will hide him secretly in my villa.

1464
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,921
I will see how we can pull
including interest from him.

1465
01:25:54,004 --> 01:25:55,754
Hey! You all stay here,
you come with me.

1466
01:25:55,837 --> 01:25:56,587
Okay sir.

1467
01:26:00,296 --> 01:26:01,879
You! Why did you come here?

1468
01:26:02,296 --> 01:26:03,921
Who is he? Do you know him?

1469
01:26:04,254 --> 01:26:05,046
He is a cheater.

1470
01:26:05,129 --> 01:26:06,629
No, not so madam.

1471
01:26:06,712 --> 01:26:09,296
He is the one, who saved your father
and admitted in the hospital.

1472
01:26:09,379 --> 01:26:09,837
This guy?

1473
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:10,546
Yes sir.

1474
01:26:10,796 --> 01:26:12,462
Why were you there at that time?

1475
01:26:12,546 --> 01:26:15,087
As I was there at that time,
was able to bring him here in time.

1476
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:15,712
Correct!

1477
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:18,254
What ask sounds like
why have made this guy live?

1478
01:26:18,337 --> 01:26:21,004
It is not good that you are
insulting my fans. I do not like it.

1479
01:26:21,212 --> 01:26:22,087
Fans for you?

1480
01:26:22,171 --> 01:26:24,671
Yes sir! He is my fans
association President.

1481
01:26:32,171 --> 01:26:32,921
Anjali.

1482
01:26:33,837 --> 01:26:34,629
Dad!

1483
01:26:47,879 --> 01:26:49,504
What daddy, looking newly at me?

1484
01:26:49,962 --> 01:26:51,171
You are my daughter, kid.

1485
01:26:54,671 --> 01:26:55,546
Thanks son.

1486
01:26:55,921 --> 01:26:56,504
Its ok sir.

1487
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:58,212
I would have not lived,
if he had not come.

1488
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,004
Looked, heard sir!

1489
01:27:00,504 --> 01:27:01,046
Sir!

1490
01:27:01,379 --> 01:27:05,254
You lived because of the blood,
food donations my fans have done sir.

1491
01:27:05,879 --> 01:27:08,546
You have unnecessarily misunderstood
me and slapped hardly.

1492
01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:09,546
Sorry Dimple!

1493
01:27:10,879 --> 01:27:12,671
Let him be with me
till the marriage is done.

1494
01:27:13,046 --> 01:27:14,296
Why him here daddy?

1495
01:27:14,671 --> 01:27:15,962
I will have some strength baby!

1496
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:18,796
Hey Friend keep him and be strong.

1497
01:27:19,004 --> 01:27:21,879
But, one thing!
What happened to you was not accident..

1498
01:27:22,421 --> 01:27:23,379
..it was an attempt is my doubt.

1499
01:27:24,421 --> 01:27:25,671
What are you saying uncle?

1500
01:27:25,754 --> 01:27:27,796
Yes baby! That Narsimha fellow
and his batch may have..

1501
01:27:27,879 --> 01:27:29,421
..landed in Sharjah
is the information I got.

1502
01:27:30,587 --> 01:27:33,129
If that is true,
none would go back with life.

1503
01:27:33,296 --> 01:27:34,212
Narsimha means.

1504
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:35,379
Your dad.

1505
01:27:36,087 --> 01:27:37,337
Is he still alive?

1506
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,921
Uncle, before my marriage
I should see his death.

1507
01:27:47,587 --> 01:27:49,504
Will show! You do not worry.

1508
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:54,796
He and his batch,
none will go back with life from here.

1509
01:27:55,504 --> 01:27:56,671
You take rest, friend.

1510
01:28:09,046 --> 01:28:11,337
What Anjali?
Anger on me is not still gone?

1511
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:15,796
Look, you may convince my dad,
but never convince me.

1512
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:18,004
Because, a cheater is always a cheater.

1513
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,004
Once a lover, always a lover.

1514
01:28:49,129 --> 01:28:58,212
"Oh sweet heart filled full of heart Oh
sweet heart cannot be without seeing you."

1515
01:28:58,587 --> 01:29:03,046
"Even if channels change
Will the remote change for TV."

1516
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:07,754
"Even if quarrels happen Will
the quality of your love change."

1517
01:29:07,837 --> 01:29:17,129
"I love you o Anjali I love you forever.
I love you o Anjali I want to be your."

1518
01:29:17,212 --> 01:29:21,837
"I hate you o cheater
I hate you forever."

1519
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:26,921
"I hate you o idiot you
cannot be my lover."

1520
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:50,671
"Getting up early morning
darling I should see your face."

1521
01:29:52,462 --> 01:29:57,921
"Hey look at your face in
the mirror before that, idiot."

1522
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:04,587
"We should be along
deadly like Idli sambar."

1523
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:09,254
"You are curry leaf in that,
will throw you out."

1524
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:13,671
"Push or put aside my love
will not change."

1525
01:30:13,754 --> 01:30:18,296
"I love you o Anjali
I love you forever."

1526
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:23,087
"I love you o Anjali
I want to be your lover."

1527
01:30:23,171 --> 01:30:27,671
"I hate you o cheater
I hate you forever."

1528
01:30:27,754 --> 01:30:32,754
"I hate you o idiot you
cannot be my lover."

1529
01:31:05,546 --> 01:31:10,337
"You should say tata when I go out."

1530
01:31:12,587 --> 01:31:17,962
"You are bad boy will
tell good bye instead of Tata."

1531
01:31:19,629 --> 01:31:24,462
"Should give flying kiss
with lips wherever I am."

1532
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:29,254
"Make both lips as feet
and give a flying kick."

1533
01:31:29,337 --> 01:31:33,587
"Kick or cut me my
love will not change."

1534
01:31:33,671 --> 01:31:38,254
"I love you o Anjali
I love you forever."

1535
01:31:38,337 --> 01:31:43,004
"I love you o Anjali
I want to be your lover."

1536
01:31:43,087 --> 01:31:47,671
"I hate you o cheater
I hate you forever."

1537
01:31:47,754 --> 01:31:52,712
"I hate you o idiot you
cannot be my lover."

1538
01:32:08,587 --> 01:32:10,712
He is a new type coma patient.

1539
01:32:13,171 --> 01:32:14,962
Eyes keep looking..

1540
01:32:15,504 --> 01:32:16,379
..body will not move.

1541
01:32:16,837 --> 01:32:19,587
No way, need to keep him,
what is it, tell man!

1542
01:32:22,754 --> 01:32:25,712
Tell.. Say it!

1543
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:27,796
What is that look?

1544
01:32:28,129 --> 01:32:30,921
One who could open your eyes, do you
think I cannot open your mouth? Tell man!

1545
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:32,587
Tell where is the money..

1546
01:32:32,671 --> 01:32:35,629
..tell tell tell?

1547
01:32:36,004 --> 01:32:37,129
Tell.

1548
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:39,796
Hey, you do not know about me man?

1549
01:32:39,879 --> 01:32:42,504
Hey, I played Bhai like a ball,
what are you after all?

1550
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:44,587
Sir, you are putting more current,
may be he would die.

1551
01:32:45,129 --> 01:32:46,671
He will not man,
I switched on the deviser.

1552
01:32:46,754 --> 01:32:49,046
Sir, seems to be tired fully.
Have a peg and start again.

1553
01:32:49,129 --> 01:32:50,587
You are right. Fix one peg man.

1554
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:53,629
Hey! By the time I finish
my peg and come..

1555
01:32:53,712 --> 01:32:55,379
..should open your mouth
and tell the truth.

1556
01:32:55,629 --> 01:32:58,962
Else, we will put the pepper spray!

1557
01:32:59,212 --> 01:33:01,962
You will become like
a crow losing your eyes.

1558
01:33:02,546 --> 01:33:03,421
Poor fellow.

1559
01:33:04,046 --> 01:33:06,212
What sir?
Have you really played with Bhai?

1560
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,504
He is Bhai for outsiders,
Toy in my hand.

1561
01:33:08,962 --> 01:33:10,712
You know how many times I made him VP?

1562
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:14,837
Hey, he had a girl friend
by name Ruksana. Beautiful figure.

1563
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:16,046
I made her fall for me.

1564
01:33:16,254 --> 01:33:18,212
Gave him cutting that
she was going to Dubai..

1565
01:33:18,504 --> 01:33:20,462
..and put her in pent house
at Dilsukh nagar.

1566
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:22,837
Ruksana is with You.

1567
01:33:23,129 --> 01:33:24,921
Ruksana super figure.

1568
01:33:28,129 --> 01:33:31,462
What man? What are you seeing?

1569
01:33:31,879 --> 01:33:35,962
Looking as if I am trying
to beat your girl friend?

1570
01:33:36,337 --> 01:33:38,379
Face will become paste if I hit.

1571
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:40,962
Feeling like an original, bloody?

1572
01:33:41,254 --> 01:33:43,712
Hey, how many have I seen like you?

1573
01:33:43,796 --> 01:33:44,546
Take the wine.

1574
01:33:44,796 --> 01:33:47,796
You will be alive till I wake up.

1575
01:33:47,962 --> 01:33:50,712
Sir, once he comes into consciousness
and tells where he has hidden the amount.

1576
01:33:50,921 --> 01:33:51,837
We would be given our share, right sir!

1577
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:53,587
What giving, bloody sweet?

1578
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:54,629
Why do you say so sir?

1579
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:55,671
You said yesterday to be sharing sir.

1580
01:33:55,754 --> 01:33:59,546
What sharing? What shares to
the batch traveling in share autos?

1581
01:33:59,629 --> 01:34:02,879
Hey Place is mine,
plan is mine, risk mine..

1582
01:34:02,962 --> 01:34:05,129
..current is mine,
money coming too is mine.

1583
01:34:05,212 --> 01:34:06,921
Hey ! I am very mad about money.

1584
01:34:07,004 --> 01:34:08,421
What madness is yours.

1585
01:34:11,046 --> 01:34:13,879
After all my fans, Will you hit me?

1586
01:34:13,962 --> 01:34:16,671
We are fans, you are hero.
Which film have you done, idiot?

1587
01:34:16,754 --> 01:34:17,546
You only said.

1588
01:34:17,754 --> 01:34:19,087
Hey idiot! Do the sitar step.

1589
01:34:19,171 --> 01:34:21,087
I do not know the Sitar step.
If you want I will play sitar.

1590
01:34:21,171 --> 01:34:22,921
I see! To play sitar,
are you any Mahanati Savitri?

1591
01:34:23,004 --> 01:34:23,587
You shut your mouth, man.

1592
01:34:23,671 --> 01:34:26,379
Hey! Why is your sound growing?
- Will it not grow for you?

1593
01:34:26,462 --> 01:34:30,129
You will not give the share
Situation will be very wild.

1594
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:31,754
Hold this! Come on.

1595
01:34:32,879 --> 01:34:34,171
Why did you him so much?

1596
01:34:34,254 --> 01:34:35,712
The result of this will
be known tomorrow.

1597
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:42,004
Friends! From today till my
sons marriage, every day is a party.

1598

Bullshit! What is he man? Empties
entire party saying enjoy and party..

1599
01:34:47,671 --> 01:34:49,379
..me and my sister should beg.

1600
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:50,921
How will the property of our boss.
come to you?

1601
01:34:51,004 --> 01:34:52,462
After he goes, it is ours only.

1602
01:34:53,296 --> 01:34:54,129
Cheers.

1603
01:34:54,212 --> 01:34:55,212
Friend!

1604
01:34:56,712 --> 01:34:59,087
You recovered well. I am happy..

1605
01:34:59,171 --> 01:35:00,212
Take the blessings of Bhole baba.

1606
01:35:00,296 --> 01:35:00,879
Baba.

1607
01:35:00,962 --> 01:35:01,796
Long live.

1608
01:35:04,129 --> 01:35:06,421
So much devotion, so much confidence.

1609
01:35:06,796 --> 01:35:09,837
Humans will change Bhanu.
Changes do come.

1610
01:35:11,046 --> 01:35:12,337
Friend, look!

1611
01:35:12,712 --> 01:35:15,671
My son and your daughter, how enjoyment.

1612
01:35:16,379 --> 01:35:17,129
Hi.

1613
01:35:25,831 --> 01:35:28,337
Oh! I am not able to
see this combination, son.

1614
01:35:28,504 --> 01:35:31,296
One more hour uncle! Calculations
along with combination will change.

1615
01:35:31,379 --> 01:35:33,087
Understood! It is lungi baba, right!

1616
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:34,837
Yes!
- You go and be ready.

1617
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:39,212
Sir! Dimple sir.

1618
01:35:42,211 --> 01:35:43,171
You are like hero sir.

1619
01:35:43,254 --> 01:35:44,587
Day time they say so.

1620
01:35:44,671 --> 01:35:47,462
It is in night that they say sitar
steps, drum steps and are beating me up.

1621
01:35:47,546 --> 01:35:49,712
Sorry sir!
All has come due to those idiots.

1622
01:35:49,796 --> 01:35:51,004
I have sent them now to Hyderabad.

1623
01:35:51,087 --> 01:35:51,837
Then, why are you here man?

1624
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:53,087
That is, Bhai sir asked me to stay.

1625
01:35:53,171 --> 01:35:54,504
Are you my fan or Bhai fan?

1626
01:35:54,587 --> 01:35:56,254
Though I am at Bhai, I am your fan sir.

1627
01:35:56,337 --> 01:35:57,171
You are ripened man.

1628
01:35:57,796 --> 01:36:00,046
Bhai sir is canopy.
He asked you to come urgently.

1629
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:02,421
Oh! You became director or what?

1630
01:36:04,837 --> 01:36:06,046
Should do this guy something!

1631
01:36:06,212 --> 01:36:07,796
I too want the same.

1632
01:36:08,504 --> 01:36:09,171
Peda sir.

1633
01:36:09,254 --> 01:36:10,462
What is it man?
- Sir.

1634
01:36:10,754 --> 01:36:14,087
Bhai sir is speaking some secret at
canopy. He asked none to come that side.

1635
01:36:15,212 --> 01:36:16,046
Secret?

1636
01:36:17,254 --> 01:36:20,587
Yes Dimple! In this Atlantic 1065..

1637
01:36:20,671 --> 01:36:22,462
..there would be a baba
by name Lungi Baba.

1638
01:36:22,629 --> 01:36:25,629
Give him this cash and ask
him to leave from here immediately.

1639
01:36:25,796 --> 01:36:26,421
Why sir?

1640
01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:29,254
That is, he is a old relation of mine.

1641
01:36:29,796 --> 01:36:31,921
When I showed the Jatakam
for Anjali marriage..

1642
01:36:32,129 --> 01:36:33,921
..he said no saying problem
for the bride groom.

1643
01:36:34,337 --> 01:36:36,837
Now, I do not believe them..

1644
01:36:37,212 --> 01:36:40,129
..but if Bhanu guy comes to
know he would stop the marriage.

1645
01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:42,337
Sir! One small doubt.

1646
01:36:42,504 --> 01:36:45,504
If there is such a big trouble, will
Bhole baba does not know about this?

1647
01:36:46,004 --> 01:36:46,962
He does not anything man.

1648
01:36:47,212 --> 01:36:50,087
They kept Bhanu wife delivery
on the date kept by him.

1649
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:52,587
What happened?
After Rohit was born, wife is expired.

1650
01:36:53,462 --> 01:36:57,212
He is a fake Baba.
He is just there for survival.

1651
01:36:57,504 --> 01:36:58,587
What is it that you are saying Peda?

1652
01:36:58,671 --> 01:37:01,629
Yes sir. I heard their secret secretly.

1653
01:37:01,754 --> 01:37:03,504
Marriage of our Rohit sir,
believing that guy means.

1654
01:37:03,587 --> 01:37:04,379
No, no, no!

1655
01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:07,504
First you go and get that Lungi baba
here. Give how much ever money required.

1656
01:37:07,587 --> 01:37:08,254
Okay sir!

1657
01:37:24,671 --> 01:37:27,546
Lungi dance, lungi dance, lungi dance..

1658
01:37:27,754 --> 01:37:28,462
Who is this baba?

1659
01:37:28,587 --> 01:37:29,712
Ok, I know.

1660
01:37:29,837 --> 01:37:31,462
Namaste Lungi Baba. Namaste.

1661
01:37:31,546 --> 01:37:32,254
Lungi blessings..

1662
01:37:32,337 --> 01:37:33,254
..lungi blessings

1663
01:37:33,504 --> 01:37:35,004
Baba, my son Rohit.

1664
01:37:35,712 --> 01:37:36,796
Namaste Baba sir.

1665
01:37:37,212 --> 01:37:40,046
What in his face,
trouble is revolving like a cyclone.

1666
01:37:40,796 --> 01:37:42,004
Trouble, what trouble?

1667
01:37:42,087 --> 01:37:44,337
Do not know what trouble is,
and you are a big baba?

1668
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:45,629
Bhanu! What are you talking?

1669
01:37:45,712 --> 01:37:49,504
Truths. You made to go for 30 rigs.
Oil came in 3.

1670
01:37:49,587 --> 01:37:50,546
Why not in the others?

1671
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:51,796
There was no oil there and has not come.

1672
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:55,504
You were the one fixed
time for the delivery of my wife.

1673
01:37:55,587 --> 01:37:57,421
My wife has died, why?

1674
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,087
Her time was up and has gone.

1675
01:37:59,171 --> 01:38:01,629
Now your time is up. Go from here.

1676
01:38:01,754 --> 01:38:03,629
Bhanu! You are insulting me.

1677
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,879
Will finish you. Go from here.

1678
01:38:11,254 --> 01:38:12,087
Is it okay?
- Yes!

1679
01:38:12,254 --> 01:38:15,546
You tell baba! My son is
getting married in four days baba!

1680
01:38:15,796 --> 01:38:17,546
Marriage? Who is the girl?

1681
01:38:20,129 --> 01:38:20,671
Uncle.

1682
01:38:20,754 --> 01:38:21,754
Baba this is Anjali.

1683
01:38:22,087 --> 01:38:23,379
Not at all matching..

1684
01:38:23,921 --> 01:38:24,629
..who is the father of her?

1685
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:25,504
Friend.

1686
01:38:25,921 --> 01:38:26,712
Go, uncle.

1687
01:38:27,004 --> 01:38:27,462
Go.

1688
01:38:27,546 --> 01:38:28,337
Hey, Dimple!

1689
01:38:31,337 --> 01:38:34,171
Bhadra, you!
Why man? Play games with planets?

1690
01:38:34,296 --> 01:38:35,671
I said you not to go
for this marriage, right?

1691
01:38:35,754 --> 01:38:37,421
That is, I do not believe more in these.

1692
01:38:37,504 --> 01:38:38,296
I have.

1693
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:41,587
I have. Baba!
Is any solution there for this?

1694
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:42,379
Yes!

1695
01:38:42,546 --> 01:38:44,921
But, tougher and very tougher.

1696
01:38:45,004 --> 01:38:46,462
No problem, tell it.

1697
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:49,254
You need to do a dummy marriage for
this Anjali baby at the same moment.

1698
01:38:49,546 --> 01:38:52,254
Then the trouble will be gone in 24
hours. The guy marrying her will be gone.

1699
01:38:52,421 --> 01:38:54,421
Later, you can get her
married to anyone you like.

1700
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:56,671
Okay then, we will see someone
and get the marriage done secretly.

1701
01:38:56,754 --> 01:39:00,629
Not possible. We can cheat humans
secretly, but not the planets.

1702
01:39:00,754 --> 01:39:01,837
They would be watching all from up.

1703
01:39:02,087 --> 01:39:02,879
Is it right baba?

1704
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:06,004
Correct! We should follow
all traditions and processes.

1705
01:39:06,087 --> 01:39:07,962
Marriage should take
place in front of all grandly.

1706
01:39:08,129 --> 01:39:10,962
Only then the marriage problem will be
gone for girl and trouble will be gone.

1707
01:39:11,212 --> 01:39:12,712
Friend! Are all these possible?

1708
01:39:12,837 --> 01:39:15,171
In a place out of our nation,
where do we get the one we need?

1709
01:39:15,254 --> 01:39:15,921
There is one guy.

1710
01:39:16,129 --> 01:39:17,837
There is? Who Dimple?

1711
01:39:20,671 --> 01:39:21,796
My fan Seenu.

1712
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:24,879
Seenu? Impossible.
I will not marry him. I hate Seenu.

1713
01:39:24,962 --> 01:39:26,796
That is why, if you marry him,
he will become late Seenu.

1714
01:39:26,879 --> 01:39:28,504
it is just dummy marriage baby, agree

1715
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,004
She may agree.
But, he should agree right!

1716
01:39:30,087 --> 01:39:32,004
You stay sir! I will make him agree.

1717
01:39:32,254 --> 01:39:34,129
But, he is a bit more mad about money.

1718
01:39:34,337 --> 01:39:35,587
We shall give how much ever he wants.
Make him agree

1719
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:37,421
That much is needed. Give a crore.

1720
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:38,254
What? One crore?

1721
01:39:38,337 --> 01:39:40,587
Yes! If it is me,
will be done in a crore rupees.

1722
01:39:40,712 --> 01:39:42,921
If you go and ask he would
ask a crore Dirhams. You will have it.

1723
01:39:43,004 --> 01:39:44,171
Not required, you go and ask.

1724
01:39:44,504 --> 01:39:45,629
Not required, you go and ask.

1725
01:39:45,712 --> 01:39:47,254
What is that you say sir?

1726
01:39:47,337 --> 01:39:49,337
Should marry daughter of Bhai
in eager of crore rupees?

1727
01:39:49,421 --> 01:39:50,421
That too a dummy marriage..

1728
01:39:50,504 --> 01:39:51,712
..my self-respect is
not into agreement sir.

1729
01:39:51,796 --> 01:39:52,504
Bullshit!

1730
01:39:52,837 --> 01:39:54,879
Do not have food to eat
and nothing else for all these.

1731
01:39:55,171 --> 01:39:58,129
Still, fans should have
respect and not self-respect.

1732
01:39:58,421 --> 01:40:00,671
Man! Will anyone lose crore
rupees in front of the eyes?

1733
01:40:00,754 --> 01:40:03,962
Okay! Why are you doing a
dummy marriage? Will I die or what

1734
01:40:05,004 --> 01:40:07,004
A small cutting for
toe or finger it seems.

1735
01:40:07,129 --> 01:40:08,421
If it is toe or figure,
he could have married.

1736
01:40:08,504 --> 01:40:09,712
Do not speak idiotic logics.

1737
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,462
Man with crores will
not risk even leg or toe.

1738
01:40:11,712 --> 01:40:13,212
I committed and came
that you will marry.

1739
01:40:13,629 --> 01:40:15,754
Will you marry for me as a fan or not?

1740
01:40:15,837 --> 01:40:19,087
Okay Sir! With the respect on you,
I will kill my self-respect.

1741
01:40:19,254 --> 01:40:20,504
You will not ask any share
in this crore, right sir?

1742
01:40:20,587 --> 01:40:22,587
No, no! Not even need a rupee.
All is for you..

1743
01:40:22,671 --> 01:40:23,921
..and then for me after you go.

1744
01:40:24,004 --> 01:40:24,504
What sir?

1745
01:40:24,671 --> 01:40:26,171
Nothing man! It is okay for you, right

1746
01:40:26,254 --> 01:40:26,837
Okay sir.

1747
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:29,296
Thanks man! Will right
now go and tell them this matter.

1748
01:40:29,754 --> 01:40:31,087
You hit me,

1749
01:40:31,254 --> 01:40:33,712
after the marriage,
planets will eat like eagles.

1750
01:40:34,004 --> 01:40:35,921
What? Have you agreed?

1751
01:40:37,087 --> 01:40:39,087
Do not know what Dimple has said you..

1752
01:40:39,171 --> 01:40:41,837
..but they said you will die
in one day if you do this marriage.

1753
01:40:41,921 --> 01:40:45,046
No problem! I will be your husband
at least for 24 hours. That is enough.

1754
01:40:46,046 --> 01:40:49,421
Shall I tell one more thing? Love is
a disease, medicine to that is to love.

1755
01:40:50,379 --> 01:40:51,296
That is your Fate.

1756
01:41:13,212 --> 01:41:13,962
Hi.

1757
01:41:14,587 --> 01:41:15,671
Hi.

1758
01:41:20,629 --> 01:41:23,004
Do not talk about that Seenu rascal.
He is a big cheater.

1759
01:41:23,671 --> 01:41:25,837
Yes! I thought you will not
come to my marriage.

1760
01:41:26,004 --> 01:41:27,921
But, he brought you and cheated a lot.

1761
01:41:30,212 --> 01:41:32,796
By bringing you for my delivery,
he is done a bigger mistake, right?

1762
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:35,004
What girls?
Are you his friends or my friends?

1763
01:41:35,087 --> 01:41:36,962
Yes! Your friends leave it.

1764
01:41:37,254 --> 01:41:38,921
Okay! Tell what is
the program for the day?

1765
01:41:39,004 --> 01:41:40,546
I have arranged a big ride for us all

1766
01:41:40,796 --> 01:41:43,504
What girl? After making the bride,
should not go out, right?

1767
01:41:43,712 --> 01:41:46,504
This is dummy marriage.
You both do not take it serious than me.

1768
01:41:46,587 --> 01:41:47,712
Ok?
- Come, let us have fun.

1769
01:41:47,796 --> 01:41:48,879
Ya ok..
- Let us go.

1770
01:41:53,546 --> 01:41:54,504
Welcome.

1771
01:41:54,587 --> 01:41:55,587
Why did you come here?

1772
01:41:55,754 --> 01:41:56,796
We had asked to come.

1773
01:41:57,004 --> 01:41:59,796
Anjali! You have a problem with him.
We do not have any.

1774
01:42:00,004 --> 01:42:02,546
If even this is a problem, tell.
We shall leave.

1775
01:42:02,796 --> 01:42:04,337
Not necessary. Just stay away from here.

1776
01:42:04,546 --> 01:42:05,837
Have I climbed in your hug now or what?

1777
01:42:06,046 --> 01:42:06,629
Shut up.

1778
01:42:06,712 --> 01:42:08,504
God! Will you stop? Come, let us leave.

1779
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:09,421
Let us go.

1780
01:42:11,546 --> 01:42:14,254
Oh God! So much depth, I cannot bear.

1781
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:15,962
Hey! Old aged would do this.

1782
01:42:16,212 --> 01:42:18,004
Okay, I will do. You do later then.

1783
01:42:18,087 --> 01:42:18,712
Okay.

1784
01:42:20,879 --> 01:42:23,712
Hey, Anjali!
- Anjali.. please be careful.

1785
01:42:23,796 --> 01:42:24,587
Its ok.

1786
01:42:31,087 --> 01:42:33,962
Anjali, be careful..
- Its ok..

1787
01:42:45,879 --> 01:42:47,504
Oh God! Rope is not tied.

1788
01:42:49,129 --> 01:42:50,546
Anjali.

1789
01:42:54,504 --> 01:42:55,421
Hey.

1790
01:43:04,337 --> 01:43:05,462
Anjali.

1791
01:43:05,546 --> 01:43:06,587
Anjali.

1792
01:43:27,046 --> 01:43:28,337
Oh thank god.

1793
01:44:07,087 --> 01:44:09,337
Hey! You are mad, you would have died.

1794
01:44:09,629 --> 01:44:10,504
I have not died, right?

1795
01:44:11,212 --> 01:44:14,879
Thank you Seenu! Why did you jump
like that without any safety?

1796
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:19,129
I have not thought about myself
at that second. I thought about Anjali.

1797
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:22,587
What would I do living after she goes?

1798
01:44:39,546 --> 01:44:40,546
Seenu.

1799
01:44:41,254 --> 01:44:45,879
All these days I tried a lot to convert
the love on you into hatred.

1800
01:44:46,629 --> 01:44:48,212
I hated wontedly..

1801
01:44:51,421 --> 01:44:52,879
..but was not possible for me.

1802
01:44:54,337 --> 01:44:55,504
I Love you Seenu!

1803
01:44:55,587 --> 01:44:56,921
Anjali, this really true, right?

1804
01:44:57,671 --> 01:44:58,587
Why do you say so?

1805
01:44:59,129 --> 01:45:01,462
That is, if you come to know
again that this baba batch..

1806
01:45:01,546 --> 01:45:03,546
..dummy marriage all these are false.

1807
01:45:03,879 --> 01:45:05,296
No problem, whichever is false.

1808
01:45:06,296 --> 01:45:08,712
I understood that your love is true.

1809
01:45:09,046 --> 01:45:11,212
Then, all that is my setup.

1810
01:45:11,962 --> 01:45:12,754
What?

1811
01:45:12,962 --> 01:45:16,379
Yes! Should I keep watching
if some guy is marrying you?

1812
01:45:16,462 --> 01:45:17,546
That is why all this.

1813
01:45:17,921 --> 01:45:20,837
That is it or any more for me to know.

1814
01:45:20,962 --> 01:45:24,212
Yes, but instead of me telling those
it is better you know them yourself.

1815
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:28,087
Not required. I knew about you,
that is enough.

1816
01:45:28,587 --> 01:45:30,087
No problem if I do
not know anything else.

1817
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:33,837
I Love you.

1818
01:45:50,837 --> 01:46:00,629
"You closed me in blue eyes
and gave the heart."

1819
01:46:00,712 --> 01:46:10,796
"You tied me in slant
looks and hugged the heart."

1820
01:46:10,879 --> 01:46:15,837
"After liking you how would I leave."

1821
01:46:15,921 --> 01:46:20,879
"Shall I hide you till
end like a line on palm."

1822
01:46:20,962 --> 01:46:25,962
"I will be a love letter in
the line on your palm."

1823
01:46:26,046 --> 01:46:31,171
"Daily I will be read to you like this."

1824
01:46:31,254 --> 01:46:41,171
"You closed me in blue
eyes and gave the heart."

1825
01:46:41,254 --> 01:46:52,296
"You tied me in slant
looks and hugged the heart."

1826
01:47:21,129 --> 01:47:26,754
"Hey! There is one heart
and it is to be given to you."

1827
01:47:26,837 --> 01:47:31,796
"Came to know because
of you and gave it to you."

1828
01:47:32,046 --> 01:47:42,004
"Never thought I need a company Felt
due to you and came along with you."

1829
01:47:42,379 --> 01:47:47,379
"If you get hiccups
will stop thinking of you."

1830
01:47:47,546 --> 01:47:52,212
"If you do not get sleep
will stop coming into dreams."

1831
01:47:52,296 --> 01:48:02,212
"You closed me in blue
eyes and gave the heart."

1832
01:48:02,296 --> 01:48:13,171
"You tied me in slant
looks and hugged the heart."

1833
01:48:37,004 --> 01:48:42,504
"You should be like
a river and I like the boat."

1834
01:48:42,587 --> 01:48:47,421
"Entire life I should
spend in your flow."

1835
01:48:47,712 --> 01:48:52,754
"You should be like the sky
and I should be the moon light.."

1836
01:48:52,837 --> 01:48:58,046
"..should keep living
happily in your hug."

1837
01:48:58,129 --> 01:49:03,254
"In the job to keep seeing you,
will not put any leave."

1838
01:49:03,337 --> 01:49:07,796
"Now, any day will remember
only you and not anyone else."

1839
01:49:07,879 --> 01:49:17,712
"You closed me in blue
eyes and gave the heart."

1840
01:49:17,796 --> 01:49:27,879
"You tied me in slant
looks and hugged the heart."

1841
01:49:48,546 --> 01:49:49,129
Seenu.

1842
01:49:49,296 --> 01:49:49,879
Sir.

1843
01:49:51,171 --> 01:49:52,421
You are very good.

1844
01:49:52,837 --> 01:49:54,546
You saved my friend once.

1845
01:49:54,837 --> 01:49:57,712
By agreeing this dummy marriage,
you saved my son from the trouble.

1846
01:49:57,837 --> 01:49:59,462
That is, trouble means
they said a some foot..

1847
01:49:59,546 --> 01:50:00,754
..or toe is what they said.
That is all right?

1848
01:50:00,837 --> 01:50:01,962
That is all!

1849
01:50:04,129 --> 01:50:06,004
Good will be done to you Seenu!

1850
01:50:06,087 --> 01:50:07,212
Salutes to you Bhanu sir!

1851
01:50:07,462 --> 01:50:09,546
Majhar has sent me. Here is your file.

1852
01:50:09,629 --> 01:50:11,504
Okay, Thank you.

1853
01:50:11,587 --> 01:50:12,462
Thank you.

1854
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:13,921
What is that file, Bhanu?

1855
01:50:14,587 --> 01:50:16,671
I brought it from the immigration.

1856
01:50:17,004 --> 01:50:19,421
After getting the information that
Narsimha and his batch is down here..

1857
01:50:19,587 --> 01:50:21,046
..who travelled from
Hyderabad to Sharjah.

1858
01:50:21,254 --> 01:50:24,129
I asked to get details of
each passenger along with photo.

1859
01:50:24,296 --> 01:50:28,212
None of them shall
go live back from here.

1860
01:50:29,754 --> 01:50:31,879
You recognise that Narasimham batch.

1861
01:50:31,962 --> 01:50:34,129
I know all of his batch.

1862
01:50:34,462 --> 01:50:38,504
Look and say who are the rest.
Our men would take care of them.

1863
01:50:38,587 --> 01:50:39,796
I saw them.

1864
01:50:40,421 --> 01:50:43,254
Here he comes. Came, he is that.

1865
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:45,421
That adjacent one.

1866
01:50:45,754 --> 01:50:53,587
He is the one. If you catch him,
all of them would be caught.

1867
01:50:54,171 --> 01:50:55,837
Is it him?
- Yes Friend! It is him.

1868
01:50:56,296 --> 01:50:56,921
Peda!
- Sir.

1869
01:50:57,004 --> 01:50:58,587
Make copies of this and
distribute to all our men.

1870
01:50:58,754 --> 01:50:59,296
Ok sir.

1871
01:50:59,379 --> 01:51:00,921
He should not go live back.

1872
01:51:01,004 --> 01:51:01,629
Yes sir.

1873
01:51:02,879 --> 01:51:05,837
What is this uncle?
Poor guy, you brought him in to this.

1874
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:07,129
What if he is caught by mistake?

1875
01:51:07,212 --> 01:51:08,254
He will not be caught.

1876
01:51:08,337 --> 01:51:10,171
He would have been doing
shows by now in America.

1877
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:10,837
Shows!

1878
01:51:10,921 --> 01:51:12,462
Hey! He is a big singer.

1879
01:51:12,546 --> 01:51:13,921
He came in our flight.

1880
01:51:14,129 --> 01:51:16,546
He said me that he would be doing
shows in America with his team.

1881
01:51:16,629 --> 01:51:18,462
Do not know where he would
be leaving America by now.

1882
01:51:18,546 --> 01:51:19,671
Thank God, you saved.

1883
01:51:19,796 --> 01:51:21,462
Uncle! We need to
finish the work urgently.

1884
01:51:21,546 --> 01:51:23,129
How much more? Two days only.

1885
01:51:29,212 --> 01:51:30,087
Rambo!

1886
01:51:30,712 --> 01:51:33,379
I am not able to forget
the insulting I had.

1887
01:51:34,171 --> 01:51:36,004
Something is happening there.

1888
01:51:36,379 --> 01:51:39,754
Those people from Hyderabad
are doing some tricks there.

1889
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:47,671
Bhanu should know that all
this dummy marriage is a fraud.

1890
01:51:48,087 --> 01:51:54,462
Go, change the getup and enter the
palace. Observe all and collect proofs.

1891
01:51:55,004 --> 01:51:55,796
Go.

1892
01:52:00,879 --> 01:52:05,129
Hey! Do you understand how
much current is wasted because of you?

1893
01:52:06,129 --> 01:52:08,879
It is wrong man!
You should not waste energy.

1894
01:52:09,462 --> 01:52:10,671
Tell, where is the cash?

1895
01:52:10,754 --> 01:52:12,587
You put some more current then I get up.

1896
01:52:12,921 --> 01:52:15,337
Hey! I will change your treatment.

1897
01:52:15,504 --> 01:52:18,379
I will bring some ash from
that Lungi baba and hit in your mouth.

1898
01:52:18,546 --> 01:52:20,254
Let us see, How the result goes?

1899
01:52:21,379 --> 01:52:22,379
Lungi Baba,

1900
01:52:22,754 --> 01:52:23,337
Lungi Baba,

1901
01:52:24,504 --> 01:52:25,462
What? Who are you, idiots?

1902
01:52:25,546 --> 01:52:27,254
It is me, Lungi Baba.

1903
01:52:27,712 --> 01:52:28,921
Are you Lungi Baba?

1904
01:52:29,004 --> 01:52:31,421
Yes! Come Dimple sir. Let us play cards.

1905
01:52:31,629 --> 01:52:33,962
Not playing cards, I will play with you.

1906
01:52:34,046 --> 01:52:36,962
You cheat Seenu,
I will tell this to Seenu.

1907
01:52:37,254 --> 01:52:39,796
You and your batch are
completely smashed, man!

1908
01:52:40,462 --> 01:52:41,962
Any danger? Baba.

1909
01:52:42,046 --> 01:52:44,454
Mad guy! That Seenu would take care.
You throw the card.

1910
01:52:44,534 --> 01:52:45,421
Ok..
- You close the door!

1911
01:52:45,504 --> 01:52:46,087
Okay.

1912
01:52:46,171 --> 01:52:48,212
Seenu, Hey Seenu! Oh God!

1913
01:52:48,837 --> 01:52:51,379
Dimple sir!
Close the door. Someone might see.

1914
01:52:53,629 --> 01:52:55,712
What madam? No worries even if I see.

1915
01:52:55,796 --> 01:52:58,046
But it is not good that you
take the dummy marriage so seriously?

1916
01:52:58,129 --> 01:52:59,462
Who said this is dummy marriage sir?

1917
01:52:59,546 --> 01:53:02,254
That is, that Lungi baba.
He too is dummy, right?

1918
01:53:02,671 --> 01:53:05,796
Dimple sir, this is not dummy marriage,
this is love marriage.

1919
01:53:06,046 --> 01:53:07,796
Love? When did that happen?

1920
01:53:07,879 --> 01:53:09,421
That happened when you
arranged chartered flight for us.

1921
01:53:09,671 --> 01:53:13,962
Oh I see!
You said think it is Daughter of Bhai..

1922
01:53:14,254 --> 01:53:15,837
..and now you confirmed.

1923
01:53:16,004 --> 01:53:17,296
I will say now..

1924
01:53:18,546 --> 01:53:20,171
..close the door.
Someone might see you.

1925
01:53:20,254 --> 01:53:21,879
Need to post this matter
urgently to Bhai sir.

1926
01:53:23,546 --> 01:53:27,379
Friend! We are starting a new
business once this marriage is done.

1927
01:53:27,671 --> 01:53:29,212
Dad! Which marriage? The dummy one?

1928
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:31,546
No man! The real one, yours.

1929
01:53:31,837 --> 01:53:32,837
It is very much confusing dad.

1930
01:53:32,921 --> 01:53:35,587
Wait for one day son.
All confusions will be gone.

1931
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:39,462
Friend! For the 250
crores of yours with me.

1932
01:53:39,546 --> 01:53:45,337
I am adding 500 more crores
and planned a big project in Sharjah.

1933
01:53:45,421 --> 01:53:46,921
Is it?
- Is the deal okay?

1934
01:53:47,004 --> 01:53:48,129
Sir, sir!

1935
01:53:48,212 --> 01:53:51,087
Hey! Can you not see us talking?
- That is, call from Pawan Kalyan sir.

1936
01:53:51,296 --> 01:53:52,837
Pawan Kalyan?
- Pawan Kalyan?

1937
01:53:52,921 --> 01:53:55,629
Yes sir. Due to my bad fate, he wants
to talk something with you urgently.

1938
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:58,462
Friend! May be some important issue..
Go! Go and speak.

1939
01:53:58,754 --> 01:53:59,962
Come sir, come faster.

1940
01:54:00,421 --> 01:54:01,379
Come sir, come.

1941
01:54:01,462 --> 01:54:03,796
Hey! How is number at Pawan kalian?

1942
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:07,629
No number, nothing sir.
Think these are legs and not hands sir.

1943
01:54:07,712 --> 01:54:08,546
What happened man?

1944
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:12,921
They hit me badly sir.
Not just the marriage is dummy sir.

1945
01:54:13,004 --> 01:54:16,046
That Seenu fellow, that Lungi Baba,
his batch, entire batch is dummy sir.

1946
01:54:16,129 --> 01:54:18,129
Let it be man! Am I original or what?

1947
01:54:18,504 --> 01:54:21,629
Sir, What are you talking sir?

1948
01:54:21,712 --> 01:54:22,587
I too am dummy.

1949
01:54:22,671 --> 01:54:23,546
What about original, then

1950
01:54:23,629 --> 01:54:25,712
The one you are daily
wasting current on.

1951
01:54:32,796 --> 01:54:34,087
If you leak this to anyone outside.

1952
01:54:34,171 --> 01:54:36,671
They will kill me.
Is this a matter to say outside?

1953
01:54:37,837 --> 01:54:41,171
To him I put current,
spoke mad words and scolded.

1954
01:54:41,254 --> 01:54:44,254
What would he do if he is out now?

1955
01:54:44,337 --> 01:54:45,796
Is this at least correct?

1956
01:54:47,879 --> 01:54:51,712
He always does this..
What else would he do?

1957
01:55:01,796 --> 01:55:02,629
Sir!

1958
01:55:03,712 --> 01:55:05,754
Actually there is no
mistake of mine in this.

1959
01:55:06,129 --> 01:55:08,421
Even you would have done the same,
if you were in my place sir.

1960
01:55:09,129 --> 01:55:13,337
Sir, mine is a small doubt sir! I
am a mad fellow and they played with me.

1961
01:55:13,629 --> 01:55:16,504
You are a big Bhai sir,
how were you caught to them sir?

1962
01:55:16,587 --> 01:55:18,587
You will get caught, once I wake up.

1963
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:22,421
He can only see and cannot talk.

1964
01:55:23,004 --> 01:55:27,421
Sir, if what I spoke is registered
then do your head like this..

1965
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,837
..is not registered then do like this.

1966
01:55:29,921 --> 01:55:31,671
All registered.

1967
01:55:31,879 --> 01:55:35,712
Looking him, may be all
the rubbish I spoke is registered.

1968
01:55:36,337 --> 01:55:40,754
He will kill me, if he is up.
Oh God! Need to do something.

1969
01:55:41,587 --> 01:55:44,046
Hey Seenu!
Do something and send me to India.

1970
01:55:44,129 --> 01:55:46,254
I may die not bearing this tension,
if I am still here.

1971
01:55:46,337 --> 01:55:49,379
No sir, they would get doubts. Firstly
they are a mafia batch, not good people.

1972
01:55:49,462 --> 01:55:51,129
You will lose your eyes,
if you say them something.

1973
01:55:51,212 --> 01:55:52,629
They are Gods in
comparison with you man!

1974
01:55:52,712 --> 01:55:54,712
Sir! Our work will
be completed by tomorrow.

1975
01:55:54,796 --> 01:55:55,754
Then, we all shall leave together.

1976
01:55:55,837 --> 01:55:57,921
How would we go man?
- I will set that.

1977
01:55:58,004 --> 01:55:59,462
Morning, our next scheme will start.

1978
01:55:59,754 --> 01:56:00,671
What? A new scheme again?

1979
01:56:00,754 --> 01:56:02,796
Yes sir, Operation Kiran Kumar..

1980
01:56:03,004 --> 01:56:04,421
Poor guy! Will you not leave him too?

1981
01:56:04,504 --> 01:56:05,587
It is, need to use sir, right?

1982
01:56:05,671 --> 01:56:07,129
Use man! Use!

1983
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:09,296
Hey!

1984
01:56:10,671 --> 01:56:11,504
Hey!

1985
01:57:05,837 --> 01:57:06,504
Shit.

1986
01:57:20,462 --> 01:57:23,087
Rambo, what happened? Knew anything?

1987
01:57:23,171 --> 01:57:26,712
No! Not to know about a few matters, it
is good for your health and life span.

1988
01:57:27,046 --> 01:57:28,379
Jai Bholenath!

1989
01:57:30,671 --> 01:57:31,754
Not live.

1990
01:57:42,754 --> 01:57:43,962
What son?
Nothing has happened to you, right?

1991
01:57:44,046 --> 01:57:45,671
Dimple sir!
Close the door. Someone might see.

1992
01:57:45,962 --> 01:57:47,796
What man, how is his condition?

1993
01:57:47,879 --> 01:57:49,546
Tied him to a camel
and left him in the desert

1994
01:57:50,171 --> 01:57:51,462
Left him in the desert?

1995
01:57:51,671 --> 01:57:53,671
You man! Anyone getting caught in
your hands becomes a peppermint.

1996
01:57:53,754 --> 01:57:57,087
It is okay sir. Uncle!
For this operation to be successful..

1997
01:57:57,171 --> 01:57:59,587
..we should get another best
scape goat like Dimple sir.

1998
01:58:00,379 --> 01:58:01,254
Sorry sir!

1999
01:58:01,337 --> 01:58:03,462
A chance to cheat!

2000
01:58:03,546 --> 01:58:05,629
But, Difficult to get one like Dimple.

2001
01:58:05,712 --> 01:58:07,837
You do not be tensed sir, He will catch.

2002
01:58:08,296 --> 01:58:08,837
I got him.

2003
01:58:09,004 --> 01:58:10,337
Look! Who is that?

2004
01:58:10,671 --> 01:58:11,171
Peda.

2005
01:58:11,379 --> 01:58:11,962
Peda.

2006
01:58:13,339 --> 01:58:14,881
Caught a great guy.

2007
01:58:15,131 --> 01:58:18,839
He keeps telling equations of rupees
and dirham whenever he finds time.

2008
01:58:18,922 --> 01:58:21,047
With your shot his
madness would come on track.

2009
01:58:21,131 --> 01:58:22,047
It would come.

2010
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:24,589
Where did you get this diamond sir?

2011
01:58:25,797 --> 01:58:28,381
Said you not to eat non-veg
on Thursday, right?

2012
01:58:28,464 --> 01:58:30,797
You are a security guard, understand?

2013
01:58:33,172 --> 01:58:34,381
Why are you looking so pathetic?

2014
01:58:34,464 --> 01:58:37,672
What body sir,
no problems even if ten people hit.

2015
01:58:37,756 --> 01:58:39,089
Hey, why do they hit me man?

2016
01:58:39,172 --> 01:58:40,297
Just joked.

2017
01:58:40,672 --> 01:58:42,172
Rupees should not joke with Dirhams.

2018
01:58:42,256 --> 01:58:45,714
I said right, Said he would talk so,
you wanted to say something, tell him!

2019
01:58:45,797 --> 01:58:47,464
Bhai sir wanted to
speak some secret with us..

2020
01:58:47,547 --> 01:58:49,339
..and asked none to come
to the Canopy side.

2021
01:58:49,589 --> 01:58:51,339
Secret? You go,
I will not come..

2022
01:58:51,422 --> 01:58:53,006
Ok..
- Let us leave.

2023
01:58:53,714 --> 01:58:54,672
Secret?

2024
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,131
Let us start.

2025
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:01,964
What is this swami?

2026
01:59:02,047 --> 01:59:04,381
Petro plant, means petrol plant.

2027
01:59:04,631 --> 01:59:07,256
Heard about Petrol bunk, but what
is this Petrol plant sir?

2028
01:59:07,339 --> 01:59:08,297
I will show you..

2029
01:59:14,006 --> 01:59:15,339
Take a lighter.

2030
01:59:17,881 --> 01:59:18,839
Wow.

2031
01:59:20,714 --> 01:59:21,714
What is this wonder?

2032
01:59:22,422 --> 01:59:24,464
Great!
- This is a plant giving petrol..

2033
01:59:24,797 --> 01:59:26,797
In Mexico, when a drugs
king tried to invent..

2034
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:30,172
..a new drug by mixing
Cocaine and heroin.

2035
01:59:30,256 --> 01:59:31,339
This plant was born.

2036
01:59:31,422 --> 01:59:33,172
My dearest follower Kiran Kumar Reddy..

2037
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:36,464
..is bringing in a tone of
the seeds now to India.

2038
01:59:36,839 --> 01:59:39,006
He will be growing
the crop in 10000 acres.

2039
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:42,797
Means, generations together
can live eating gold.

2040
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:44,339
Why are you telling me all this sir?

2041
01:59:44,422 --> 01:59:45,381
Because he is listening.

2042
01:59:45,464 --> 01:59:46,339
Fool! Shut up.

2043
01:59:46,672 --> 01:59:49,381
This entire project would
cost a thousand crores.

2044
01:59:49,589 --> 01:59:52,047
He is ready to put 500 crores.

2045
01:59:52,131 --> 01:59:55,047
He asked me to be
requiring a good partner..

2046
01:59:55,131 --> 01:59:57,339
..to put the balance 500 crores
and take care of the business.

2047
01:59:57,422 --> 01:59:59,381
That is why I had come
in this tour, Son!

2048
01:59:59,589 --> 02:00:03,214
As you are my dearest follower,
I am giving you the first chance.

2049
02:00:03,297 --> 02:00:04,547
Many thanks Sir.

2050
02:00:04,631 --> 02:00:08,631
Sir! You do not say friendship, relation
and join someone else as partners sir.

2051
02:00:08,714 --> 02:00:11,172
Yes sir! You must do
this project in solo.

2052
02:00:11,256 --> 02:00:12,672
My thought is also that.

2053
02:00:13,339 --> 02:00:16,006
I have 250 crores at Bhanu bro.

2054
02:00:16,214 --> 02:00:17,964
Will tell something
and get that from him.

2055
02:00:18,172 --> 02:00:21,047
Same way, will transfer
another 250 crores from India.

2056
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:22,006
Chance to cheat!

2057
02:00:22,089 --> 02:00:24,797
Good. Do not speak
about this project outside.

2058
02:00:25,089 --> 02:00:28,422
Keep this a secret. Otherwise,
I get bad mark at our Kiran Kumar Reddy.

2059
02:00:28,506 --> 02:00:30,172
Okay Baba.
- Okay Baba.

2060
02:00:30,922 --> 02:00:32,172
Is it true?
- Yes sir!

2061
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:34,381
I heard with my ears.
Saw with my eyes.

2062
02:00:34,464 --> 02:00:38,172
Spoon petrol will not be
out by digging 10000 feet here sir.

2063
02:00:38,256 --> 02:00:42,172
That is not a normal plant sir,
you get petrol by squeezing it sir.

2064
02:00:42,256 --> 02:00:43,631
Dad! It is a miracle.

2065
02:00:43,922 --> 02:00:49,547
He makes us invest in all dirty
businesses and does this in solo?

2066
02:00:50,089 --> 02:00:50,631
Will tell.

2067
02:00:50,714 --> 02:00:53,589
Friend! Need to speak to you urgently.

2068
02:00:53,922 --> 02:00:54,381
Tell.

2069
02:00:54,547 --> 02:00:59,589
Nothing. Needed some money urgently.
If you transfer my 250.

2070
02:01:00,381 --> 02:01:02,297
Is 250 enough or you want 500?

2071
02:01:02,547 --> 02:01:03,881
No, no! 250 is enough.

2072
02:01:03,964 --> 02:01:06,922
Whom should I transfer?
You? Or Kiran Kumar Reddy?

2073
02:01:09,381 --> 02:01:11,172
What, what? How do you know this?

2074
02:01:11,922 --> 02:01:14,256
Wow! What an action man?

2075
02:01:14,506 --> 02:01:17,839
Know everything friend!
Heard about the Petrol plant project.

2076
02:01:18,089 --> 02:01:22,172
We did all legal and illegal
deals together till now.

2077
02:01:22,422 --> 02:01:24,422
Will you do this now in solo?

2078
02:01:24,672 --> 02:01:25,714
Not like that friend!

2079
02:01:25,797 --> 02:01:27,922
There is some risk in this,
thought why to involve you in this.

2080
02:01:28,006 --> 02:01:29,589
I like risk.

2081
02:01:33,631 --> 02:01:35,089
Okay! We both shall do together.

2082
02:01:35,172 --> 02:01:36,589
Fifty fifty.
- Okay friend!

2083
02:01:36,756 --> 02:01:37,714
Peda.
- Sir..

2084
02:01:37,797 --> 02:01:40,089
Once the marriage is done
arrange to transfer the entire money.

2085
02:01:40,381 --> 02:01:43,422
Why till then sir? You say yes,
will transfer in just 5 minutes.

2086
02:01:43,506 --> 02:01:46,047
Sometimes,
delay would make miss the chances sir.

2087
02:01:46,756 --> 02:01:49,047
Tell okay sir.
- Okay.

2088
02:01:49,631 --> 02:01:52,381
Okay sir! Give your names.
I will send to Hyderabad in hawala

2089
02:01:52,589 --> 02:01:54,047
He looks more idiot than me.

2090
02:01:54,131 --> 02:01:56,547
Selected for that
reason only sir. Yes, yes.

2091
02:01:56,756 --> 02:01:58,047
The name is Goverdhan Reddy in this.

2092
02:01:58,131 --> 02:01:59,714
That is the name of
uncle of Kiran Kumar Reddy.

2093
02:02:00,006 --> 02:02:01,589
It would not be good doing the business
on own name and that is the reason.

2094
02:02:01,672 --> 02:02:02,131
Correct..

2095
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:03,297
Whose is this second account number?

2096
02:02:03,381 --> 02:02:04,047
That is of mediator.

2097
02:02:04,131 --> 02:02:05,256
Transfer 5% extra.

2098
02:02:05,339 --> 02:02:06,839
What? Should give
the commission correctly..

2099
02:02:06,922 --> 02:02:08,381
..to the mediator sir, what do you say?

2100
02:02:08,464 --> 02:02:09,131
Correct.

2101
02:02:09,214 --> 02:02:11,797
Hey! He is the mediator, right?
- Found out greatly sir.

2102
02:02:12,297 --> 02:02:15,297
You tightened him even legally, man!
- Thought would be better.

2103
02:02:16,672 --> 02:02:18,881
Hey! By the grace of God
you have not been in to Mafia..

2104
02:02:19,172 --> 02:02:21,464
..otherwise entire mafia
team would have been ruined.

2105
02:02:21,547 --> 02:02:22,422
Thank you Sir.

2106
02:02:22,506 --> 02:02:24,129
Huh! Why are you feeling shy man?

2107
02:02:38,506 --> 02:02:41,131
Friends! Today is a special day.

2108
02:02:41,672 --> 02:02:42,964
Me and my friend..

2109
02:02:43,506 --> 02:02:45,756
..are going to do a
sensational project together.

2110
02:02:46,006 --> 02:02:47,381
In this sensational occasion.

2111
02:02:47,672 --> 02:02:49,839
I am opening this sensational bottle.

2112
02:02:50,464 --> 02:02:52,714
This costs 25 lakhs.

2113
02:02:52,797 --> 02:02:54,006
Cheers.

2114
02:02:54,089 --> 02:02:55,547
Even this 25 is a loss to him.

2115
02:03:02,506 --> 02:03:03,756
What are you saying Seenu?

2116
02:03:04,256 --> 02:03:06,422
Why all this keeping
the marriage tomorrow?

2117
02:03:06,506 --> 02:03:08,297
Anjali! One last time,
listen to what I say.

2118
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:09,589
You will understand why.

2119
02:03:09,714 --> 02:03:10,922
Go first. Please.

2120
02:03:12,839 --> 02:03:13,464
Okay.

2121
02:03:14,506 --> 02:03:16,172
Enough friend, it is already over.

2122
02:03:16,256 --> 02:03:17,631
Leave it man!

2123
02:03:17,922 --> 02:03:20,506
This occasion will
not come again. Enjoy.

2124
02:03:20,797 --> 02:03:22,839
Daddy! I do not want this marriage.

2125
02:03:23,756 --> 02:03:25,339
It is the dummy marriage,
you are talking about, right?

2126
02:03:25,422 --> 02:03:27,422
Neither dummy nor the real.
I do not want marriage at all

2127
02:03:27,506 --> 02:03:28,714
What?
- Hey, you stop!

2128
02:03:29,256 --> 02:03:31,547
It is okay dear.
I will not do what you do not like.

2129
02:03:31,756 --> 02:03:34,131
Friend, cancel this marriage.
We will leave to India.

2130
02:03:36,672 --> 02:03:39,631
What! Talking as if you are looking
for the good of your own daughter.

2131
02:03:39,839 --> 02:03:42,131
He is brought me up more than that,
even if I am not his own daughter.

2132
02:03:42,214 --> 02:03:45,589
Why did he?
Just for the money behind you.

2133
02:03:46,381 --> 02:03:49,839
Else, he would have killed you on the
day he killed your mother and father.

2134
02:03:53,339 --> 02:03:55,964
Hey, what are you talking?
Anjali! You do not believe his words.

2135
02:03:56,047 --> 02:03:58,047
Why should she not believe?
What should she not believe?

2136
02:03:58,256 --> 02:04:00,714
For the one who killed his
own brother and sister-in-law..

2137
02:04:00,797 --> 02:04:02,631
..it is not a big deal to kill you.

2138
02:04:05,589 --> 02:04:06,631
Means, my mother and father.

2139
02:04:06,714 --> 02:04:08,131
Yes, he killed.

2140
02:04:08,506 --> 02:04:10,797
Your father had lived due to his luck.

2141
02:04:11,006 --> 02:04:13,506
Not just that,
cheating the people of own village..

2142
02:04:13,589 --> 02:04:17,881
..looting all their money, he pushed
all those crimes on to your father.

2143
02:04:18,172 --> 02:04:19,756
Ask him to tell no to this?

2144
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:26,214
That means my dad was.

2145
02:04:26,381 --> 02:04:27,339
God!

2146
02:04:27,714 --> 02:04:33,172
He is the cheater who made you without
Godlike father and Goddess like mother.

2147
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:34,047
I am the witness.

2148
02:04:34,464 --> 02:04:35,381
Hey! It was you who gave
idea for all this, right?

2149
02:04:35,464 --> 02:04:36,756
I am a criminal, I gave the idea.

2150
02:04:36,839 --> 02:04:40,797
But, not a criminal like you who killed
own brother and sister-in-law, man!

2151
02:04:41,172 --> 02:04:44,797
Hey, whether you like or
not all thought should happen.

2152
02:04:45,297 --> 02:04:49,089
It is only after the marriage with my
son that you all will leave from here.

2153
02:04:49,506 --> 02:04:50,006
Peda!

2154
02:04:50,089 --> 02:04:50,881
I will take care, sir.

2155
02:04:50,964 --> 02:04:51,839
Ok..

2156
02:05:00,631 --> 02:05:01,464
Anjali.

2157
02:05:03,881 --> 02:05:05,172
What is this Seenu?

2158
02:05:07,297 --> 02:05:08,672
You wanted me to know this.

2159
02:05:09,422 --> 02:05:11,839
Yes Anjali!
Wanted you to know this truth.

2160
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:16,006
I want to see my father Seenu, please.

2161
02:05:17,172 --> 02:05:19,964
Take me to my father.

2162
02:05:22,256 --> 02:05:23,256
He is your father.

2163
02:05:30,297 --> 02:05:30,922
He?

2164
02:05:31,089 --> 02:05:34,714
He is your father away from
your love for the past 15 years.

2165
02:05:40,462 --> 02:05:41,214
Daddy.

2166
02:06:04,297 --> 02:06:06,422
For you gone away from the top
of this heart to come back..

2167
02:06:07,881 --> 02:06:10,547
..on to the heart again,
it took so many years, dear.

2168
02:06:12,297 --> 02:06:13,547
Sorry daddy.

2169
02:06:14,506 --> 02:06:16,006
I said you many words.

2170
02:06:17,214 --> 02:06:20,047
No dear! You are my daughter.

2171
02:06:32,424 --> 02:06:37,089
Hey, all would search for
Son-in-law after daughter is born.

2172
02:06:37,922 --> 02:06:43,047
But that God is given me
Son-in-law first and then daughter.

2173
02:07:05,547 --> 02:07:09,256
This is the story. You have
no option but to make us escape.

2174
02:07:09,339 --> 02:07:13,631
So much cheating? So many conspiracies?
All of you together cheat my boss..

2175
02:07:13,839 --> 02:07:15,297
..will tell right away.
You are all finished.

2176
02:07:15,381 --> 02:07:16,214
Sir, sir Peda sir.

2177
02:07:16,297 --> 02:07:18,047
Hey Seenu, Seenu, just wait Seenu,
leave this single scene to me.

2178
02:07:18,131 --> 02:07:19,131
Let me handle this.

2179
02:07:19,339 --> 02:07:20,089
Let me handle this.

2180
02:07:20,172 --> 02:07:21,339
What is it that you handle, man?

2181
02:07:21,422 --> 02:07:25,422
Hey idiot! Once I ask you two questions,
you will get clarity.

2182
02:07:25,797 --> 02:07:27,881
Who said to your boss about Lungi baba?

2183
02:07:27,964 --> 02:07:28,256
Me.

2184
02:07:28,339 --> 02:07:29,756
That was the reason,
why marriage has stopped.

2185
02:07:30,506 --> 02:07:33,172
Who said your boss that
petrol comes on squeezing?

2186
02:07:33,339 --> 02:07:33,922
Me.

2187
02:07:34,006 --> 02:07:36,631
That is the reason man,
500 crores is gone in hawala.

2188
02:07:36,714 --> 02:07:39,256
I will tell my boss that
all these have cheated me.

2189
02:07:39,339 --> 02:07:39,881
Hey.

2190
02:07:39,964 --> 02:07:42,256
You bloody fool!
As they know that you would say..

2191
02:07:42,339 --> 02:07:44,297
..these have mingled you legally.

2192
02:07:44,714 --> 02:07:47,797
Idiot, it is there that
mediator is given 5 crores, right?

2193
02:07:47,881 --> 02:07:49,547
Whose account do
you think it is deposited?

2194
02:07:49,631 --> 02:07:53,881
Check man! It is in your account.
Look idiot!

2195
02:07:54,756 --> 02:07:55,839
Hah! This is mine.

2196
02:07:55,922 --> 02:07:57,214
Yes! It is yours.

2197
02:07:57,464 --> 02:07:58,839
Do you know Pakistan.

2198
02:07:58,922 --> 02:07:59,422
I know sir.

2199
02:07:59,506 --> 02:08:00,089
Kajikisthan?

2200
02:08:00,297 --> 02:08:01,172
I know sir, it is in Russia.

2201
02:08:01,256 --> 02:08:03,256
They are of Irikisthan.
No one knows where it is.

2202
02:08:03,339 --> 02:08:04,922
Once entered, you are trapped.

2203
02:08:05,006 --> 02:08:07,214
Son, tomorrow is the marriage.
How are we going?

2204
02:08:07,422 --> 02:08:09,589
Peda sir is there.
He would take us in chartered flight.

2205
02:08:09,672 --> 02:08:11,214
Me? In chartered flight.

2206
02:08:11,297 --> 02:08:12,214
That is Irikisthan.

2207
02:08:12,714 --> 02:08:15,089
Sir, If you are here
will Bhanu bhai let you live?

2208
02:08:15,172 --> 02:08:15,881
He would kill.

2209
02:08:15,964 --> 02:08:18,214
Idiot! Tell now, Is our
rupee great or your Dirhams great?

2210
02:08:18,297 --> 02:08:20,506
Yes! Your brains earning
rupees are great sir.

2211
02:08:20,589 --> 02:08:22,006
We do not have time, move.

2212
02:08:22,089 --> 02:08:23,047
Move..
- Let us go.

2213
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:47,035
Bhanu.

2214
02:08:52,422 --> 02:08:53,297
You are..

2215
02:08:53,464 --> 02:08:54,089
Bhai!

2216
02:08:54,172 --> 02:08:56,797
The one with you all
these days was Narsimha.

2217
02:09:00,297 --> 02:09:02,839
Dad! Anjali and others
are not to be seen.

2218
02:09:02,922 --> 02:09:04,422
Not to be seen?
- May have eloped.

2219
02:09:14,172 --> 02:09:15,797
Baba! It is you?

2220
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:19,172
All of them cheated you Bhanu!
They escaped from your house.

2221
02:09:19,672 --> 02:09:21,672
See to that they do
not escape from Sharjah.

2222
02:09:26,422 --> 02:09:27,714
Come.. come fast.

2223
02:09:29,297 --> 02:09:30,839
Come.. come fast.

2224
02:09:32,756 --> 02:09:33,631
Hey Rohit!
- Dad.

2225
02:09:33,839 --> 02:09:36,131
Take Airport chief security

Hey Seenu! Kill me man, kill me.

02:12:00,464 --> 02:12:01,922
Go, go go.

2267
02:12:13,464 --> 02:12:15,797
Hey Peda! There would be
something called cyanide, right?

2268
02:12:15,881 --> 02:12:17,172
Keeping that here, people would die!

2269
02:12:17,256 --> 02:12:18,547
Will that be found in this flight,
by chance?

2270
02:12:20,756 --> 02:12:22,339

Oh god.

2276
02:12:49,381 --> 02:12:50,672
Stop the flight.

2277
02:12:51,881 --> 02:12:53,047
Stop it.

2278
02:13:16,839 --> 02:13:18,172
Bhanu!
- Baba.

2279
02:13:18,714 --> 02:13:20,797
We should reach Hyderabad
even before they reach.

2280
02:13:21,256 --> 02:13:22,464
Arrange it.

02:14:00,006 --> 02:14:05,714
"Queen, queen you are my life,

2286
02:14:05,797 --> 02:14:11,756
"I put tent in you solo
heart Printed your photo in me."

2287
02:14:11,964 --> 02:14:16,381
"Will make you climb sky,
will put bed on stars."

2288
02:14:16,464 --> 02:14:18,172
"Will give many kisses like the Helios."

2289
02:14:18,256 --> 02:14:24,047
"Hah, Son-in-law Seenu,

"Seenu, Seenu."

2293
02:15:06,089 --> 02:15:09,006
"Son-in-law Seenu.. we are for him"

2294
02:15:09,089 --> 02:15:11,589
"He is magical, son-in-law Seenu"

2295
02:15:12,006 --> 02:15:14,756
"There is lightening in your smiles."

2296
02:15:14,839 --> 02:15:18,089
"I will give current to entire
city with that lightening."

2297
02:15:20,589 --> 02:15:27,047
"There is heat in your looks I will
cook with that heat to the entire city."

2298
02:15:29,964 --> 02:15:35,881
"Instead of sugar in the
coffee cup Will mix beauty sugar."

2299
02:15:36,089 --> 02:15:42,047
"Do not want any scent or Athars

2304
02:16:50,547 --> 02:16:56,839
"Instead of jasmines full in the
room Will sprinkle the sensuous words."

2305
02:16:57,089 --> 02:17:00,006
"Do not need incense sticks or smokes.."

2306
02:17:00,089 --> 02:17:02,964
"..and fumes Heat in body
is enough will fire up."

2307
02:17:03,047 --> 02:17:08,964
"Hah, Son-in-law Seenu,
If you come hit is every scene."

2308
02:17:15,089 --> 02:17:21,381
"Hah, Son-in-law Seenu, For our dances
gives place is the silver screen."

2309
02:17:35,089 --> 02:17:37,714
Sir we reached Hyderabad,
but we are in the risk right.

2310
02:17:37,881 --> 02:17:40,881
Yes risk, Seenu must do
something and put them in risk.

2311
02:17:40,964 --> 02:17:43,756
Son I will go to wash room.

2312
02:17:44,006 --> 02:17:44,881
Go, uncle.

2313
02:17:46,714 --> 02:17:47,589
Oh god.

2314
02:18:05,214 --> 02:18:06,964
We meet again.

2315
02:18:07,297 --> 02:18:08,464
Son-in-law..

2316
02:18:22,756 --> 02:18:24,381
Be quiet sir,
Do not be tensed unnecessarily.

2317
02:18:24,464 --> 02:18:25,547
Why are you embarrassed?

2318
02:18:25,631 --> 02:18:27,631
You would know if you were in our
position, what that tension is?

2319
02:18:27,881 --> 02:18:30,006
Look at him, seems like to die
with heart attack in an half an hour.

2320
02:18:30,089 --> 02:18:31,672
Shall we go?
- Come on uncle.

2321
02:18:44,506 --> 02:18:46,339
Your wish is going
to be fulfilled uncle!

2322
02:18:46,422 --> 02:18:48,964
You are going like a king to the village
which felt you all these days as a thief.

2323
02:18:49,131 --> 02:18:50,922
Okay, but will they
believe if truth is said?

2324
02:18:51,047 --> 02:18:52,756
We will not tell. We shall show.

2325
02:18:53,047 --> 02:18:54,131
What is that?

2326
02:18:54,381 --> 02:18:56,631
True! All Bhanu had spoken
yesterday night in the party..

2327
02:18:56,714 --> 02:18:58,881
..and the truths in the desert
are recorded in this.

2328
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:00,881
What about money then?

2329
02:19:00,964 --> 02:19:02,839
Our men have already
drawn and started uncle.

2330
02:19:02,922 --> 02:19:04,297
They will meet us on the way.

2331
02:19:07,047 --> 02:19:08,381
What Dimple, looking tensed?

2332
02:19:08,464 --> 02:19:12,172
What if not tension sir? This Seenu
has left that Bhai in chair like that.

2333
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:14,839
Who is in danger if gets up sir?
You tell, is it not me?

2334
02:19:15,214 --> 02:19:16,006
Should have killed.

2335
02:19:16,089 --> 02:19:19,589
I said to kill sir, this fellow is
a big sacrifice, has come leaving him.

2336
02:19:20,131 --> 02:19:22,047
There is a bit mistake
even from my side in this.

2337
02:19:22,339 --> 02:19:26,256
Had current in hand, if four points
more was put would have died in a shot.

2338
02:19:29,672 --> 02:19:31,131
What are you sir, looking so?

2339
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:34,464
What if I was the Bhai,
thinking how would your reaction be.

2340
02:19:36,006 --> 02:19:41,172
Talking is changed a bit, By mistake you
exchanged at the airport or what sir?

2341
02:19:42,797 --> 02:19:44,589
What Dimple?
Why are you worried so much?

2342
02:19:44,672 --> 02:19:46,464
What I spoke was such madam.

2343
02:19:47,756 --> 02:19:52,172
he would just be looking at like that.
No movement in body.

2344
02:19:52,547 --> 02:19:56,339
Will our words spoken be registered?

2345
02:19:56,422 --> 02:19:58,047
That is why we say
not to slip the tongue.

2346
02:19:58,214 --> 02:19:59,881
Do not recite Sumathi stanzas now sir.

2347
02:19:59,964 --> 02:20:03,422
Heart is like to stop, Said heart is to
stop and vehicle has stopped, why?

2348
02:20:06,422 --> 02:20:07,547
Narsimha brother! Come.

2349
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:17,631
Hey Peda!
- Sir?

2350
02:20:17,714 --> 02:20:20,297
This is the amount
earned utilizing our innocence.

2351
02:20:20,464 --> 02:20:21,422
Look at our hard earned money.

2352
02:20:21,506 --> 02:20:22,881
Ask them to give us some amount sir.

2353
02:20:22,964 --> 02:20:24,589
We would go to a place where
there are no humans and live happily.

2354
02:20:24,672 --> 02:20:26,714
Hey, this has to go to
the place it has to reach.

2355
02:20:26,797 --> 02:20:28,256
Not even a single rupee
should be touched by anyone.

2356
02:20:28,339 --> 02:20:30,797
Even those earning working
hard will not have such commitment.

2357
02:20:30,881 --> 02:20:32,797
When you do not give anyone,
why is this exhibition on roads?

2358
02:20:32,922 --> 02:20:35,006
Let us move. If someone comes
in the mean time, it is a problem.

2359
02:20:35,381 --> 02:20:36,172
He came.

2360
02:20:46,839 --> 02:20:48,422
Son-in-law!
- Uncle.

2361
02:20:50,047 --> 02:20:52,256
What are you looking like that son?
I am your uncle.

2362
02:20:52,506 --> 02:20:53,464
He is Bhai.

2363
02:20:54,172 --> 02:20:55,172
Son! I..

2364
02:20:55,256 --> 02:20:56,631
Hey! Who is son-in-law to you?

2365
02:20:56,839 --> 02:20:58,756
Hey dimple come here tell.

2366
02:20:59,089 --> 02:21:00,131
Tell that was the one
you put current, right?

2367
02:21:00,214 --> 02:21:02,297
Why current issue now sir,
Am I any line man?

2368
02:21:02,381 --> 02:21:05,381
Always say put current, put current
and torture me reminding.

2369
02:21:05,922 --> 02:21:06,797
Son!

2370
02:21:07,547 --> 02:21:08,506
Do not be confused.

2371
02:21:08,589 --> 02:21:09,256
Son-in-law.

2372
02:21:09,714 --> 02:21:10,422
He is Bhai.

2373
02:21:10,506 --> 02:21:11,339
Do not believe him.

2374
02:21:11,422 --> 02:21:12,506
I am your uncle.

2375
02:21:16,172 --> 02:21:18,006
Seenu, Seenu!

2376
02:21:19,047 --> 02:21:21,297
You planned this much
then how much I can?

2377
02:21:23,631 --> 02:21:24,631
Seenu.

2378
02:21:28,422 --> 02:21:29,339
Seenu.

2379
02:21:30,756 --> 02:21:32,006
Hey Dimple, come here.

2380
02:21:33,756 --> 02:21:34,589
Seenu.

2381
02:21:36,089 --> 02:21:38,714
He had a pen drive just before.

2382
02:21:42,589 --> 02:21:43,672
Here sir.

2383
02:21:44,214 --> 02:21:45,422
I will leave now sir.

2384
02:21:45,506 --> 02:21:49,422
Where? There are many
more to kill still by us.

2385
02:21:49,506 --> 02:21:51,422
Hey, bury him first.

2386
02:21:51,881 --> 02:21:53,672
Okay! Where have you
learnt to put current?

2387
02:21:53,756 --> 02:21:57,172
Sir, please do not ask me anything sir.
My health is in no way good sir.

2388
02:21:57,464 --> 02:21:59,297
Kidneys inside might blast sir.

2389
02:21:59,672 --> 02:22:01,464
How is Ruksana?

2390
02:22:01,922 --> 02:22:02,589
Sir.

2391
02:22:03,131 --> 02:22:05,172
What is the situation here
and what is his emotion sir?

2392
02:22:05,256 --> 02:22:07,006
What is my frustration?
Without considering all those..

2393
02:22:07,089 --> 02:22:08,172
..you ask about Ruksana,
what is this sir?

2394
02:22:08,256 --> 02:22:10,297
Hey hey What is this, voice is raising?

2395
02:22:11,464 --> 02:22:12,214
