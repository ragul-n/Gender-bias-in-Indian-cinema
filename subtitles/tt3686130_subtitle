00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:44,650
"I forgot everything...
I forgot everything..."

2
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,310
"This is the only thing
that I didn't forget"

3
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:03,012
"Julie...l love you..."

4
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,104
"Julie"...

5
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,537
"Julie loves you..."

6
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,180
Hari! There is major bleeding
from the right renal artery

7
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,143
I'm unable to control it
When will you join us?

8
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,474
I'll be there soon

9
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,376
How is he?

10
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,579
Prema, do something to
stop the bleeding now

11
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,340
Please...

12
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,579
Isn't he there?

13
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,647
- Yes, he is here
- How is the BP?

14
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,611
It's dropping

15
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,611
Kill me, baby

16
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,008

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,575
You manage for few minutes

19
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,746
Kill me, baby

20
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,403
Ravi!

21
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:32,539

27
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,171
See if there is someone else

28
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,474
Narayan, mark there

00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,104

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,503

- Hello!

33
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,669

00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,542
Pardon!

35
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,544
This...this is Prema

36
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,977
I'm inspector Raja Gowda speaking

37
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,741
No, Dr.Hari

38
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,577
Dr.Hari has had an accident
in Hosur and is dead

39
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,303

- Hello! Hari...who is this?

00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,740

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,110

00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,168
Thank you!

52
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,035
Sir!

53
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,144
Has he been identified?

54
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,338
No one knows

55
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,413
We are trying to get him identified

56
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,480
Move on the side

57
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,044
Clear those vehicles

58
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,043
Don't create a traffic jam
Keep moving

59
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,547
What arrangements have
been done to remove the body?

60
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,444
Ambulance has been informed
It is on the way

Everything is fine, sir

Everything has been cleared

79
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,544
You don't worry anything

80
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,136
I'll look after everything

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,009
No one will interfere in my work

82
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,580
Okay, who was that officer with you?

83
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,135
He was from crime branch

84
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,769
We won't have any problem from him

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,446
- Should I give him cash?
- No need

86
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,104
I'll handle everything

87
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,303
okay

88
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,636
Dear, he'll be alright

89
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,535
You go and take rest

90
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:29,579
Take her to the rest room

91
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,440
Come, let's go

92
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,305
Hold him

93
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,210
I'll come in a minute

94
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,777
Nothing happened to him, sir

95
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
It is just that
the lorry and car got crashed

96
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,544
No one died
It was a minor accident

97
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,479
What are you saying?
I saw with my own eyes

98
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,376
You don't have to tell me

99
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,037
Where is the FIR?

100
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,074
It is not there, sir

101
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,703
It was a small accident

102
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,013
Nothing happened to anyone
No one gave any complaint

103
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,514
- Then what is the need for FIR, sir?
- Where is that car?

104
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,472
- Umesh!
- Sir!

105
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,307
- Shiva!
- Sir!

106
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,175

Narayan!

107
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,338
Praveen!
Come here

108
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,703
What happened to that Hosur accident?

109
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,046
Madam!

110
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,473
Who is that in the ICU?

111
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,479
He is a doctor in the hospital

112
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:30,342
DnHaï¬‚

113
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,777
Sir, I don't know

114
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,105
He has got a brother

115
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:42,748
I don't know which one it is, sir

116
00:13:58,467 --> 00:13:59,537
Sir, tea!

117
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,371
RN Pillai

118
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,447
He is the MD
of this hospital group

119
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,605
He is a known name
among Bangalore Malayalees

120
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,111
Have you not heard of him?

121
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,646
No, I haven't
Maybe because I'm new here

122
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,202
- You are from?
- Karunagapalli

123
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,679
- Originally from Tamil Nadu
- Where in Tamil Nadu?

124
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,405
From Erwadi in Ramanathapuram

125
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,570
There is no one there now

126
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:36,409
We shifted to Kerala
when I was 4 years old

127
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,241
Okay! Your son is fine now

128
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,042
I have to attend
an important conference

129
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,044
So...

130
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,104
Actually I came to
ask you something else

131
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:49,980
Yesterday while I was coming
back with my child's blood...

132
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,638
...report, I came
across this strange visual

133
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,371
I thought I'll enquire about it

134
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,003
It is my duty

135
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,580
Actually there is a story behind it

136
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,577
Last week in Hosur
road I saw an accident

137
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:11,473
The person who died had the same face
and I was startled by the similarity

138
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:15,671
I'm saying as dead
because I saw he was dead

139
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,745
Are they twins?

140
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,213
I also asked
your front office staff about it

141
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,769
They said they know nothing

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,640
And someone said one of
your surgeons...

143
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:32,206
...Dr.Hari Narayanan met with
an accident on that day on Hosur road

144
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,175
And she also said that
he is the son of your MD

145
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:41,174
And nowl know that the one
inside the ICU is Ravi Narayanan

146
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,578
Twin of Dr.Hari Narayanan who
got killed in that accident

147
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,580
Whenl enquired I came to know that
Ravi is in a derailed state of mind

148
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,010
And that he attempted suicide

149
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,138
Early morning at 2:30
he went to the working sight

150
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,043
There he jumped from the fourth floor

151
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,376
As he fell on the
false roof he survived

152
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,612
Sir, yes...sir!
Will do as you say

153
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:05,180
Sir...sir...go carefully
It is a restricted area

154
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,008
Sir, only false roof is there

155
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,478
Be careful

156
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,340
And I think there is a minor
fracture in his rig ht hand

157
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,504
Isn't it rig ht?

158
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,648
I asked in my department
about that Hosur accident

159
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,770
They said

160
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:38,675
The corrupt to the core
cops of this state said they are not sure

161
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,379
If something like this must happen,
two things are sure

162
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,674
One, this must have taken
place with the connivance of...

163
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,303
...the immediate family members

164
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:50,042
Two, money is being
pumped into this like hell

165
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:54,241
One of the twins is dead
other attempted suicide

166
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:59,544
And I say the one who is dead
is Hari Narayanan and the one...

167
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:03,137
...who is inside the ICU is now
mentally unstable Ravi Narayanan

168
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,770
I'm here to take him

169
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,239
No, you won't

170
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,575
Mr.R.N. Pillai!

171
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,135
I tried to get you

172
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,505
But you were elusive

173
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:19,414
I came to know that avoiding
socializing your family lives aloof

174
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,679
You know sir, that if one
among twins die, it'll be an...

175
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:25,407
...unbearable blow on
the other person's heart

176
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,412
Ravi is not normal
That is why he tried for suicide

177
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:31,105
Government must have the
knowledge about such a person

178
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:35,047
- I'll look after my son's matter
- This is not a matter of only your son

179
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,274
A person who has tried for
suicide is a threat to the society

180
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,308
If Ravi had been a pilot?

181
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,280
He'll crash a plane
with 400 passengers in sea

182
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:49,046
Else if he rides a car
over innocent people?

183
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,006
That time also you'll
think about only your son

184
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:55,344
Law thinks from the point of
view of those innocents also

185
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,971
- Mister...
- Yousaf Marrakkar!

186
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:02,981
Whatevermplease, leave us alone

187
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,341
Will you?

188
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,471
- Dr.Mani!
- Sir!

189
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,773
Lets go

190
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm telling this to all of you

191
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,340
You just obey me here

192
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,104
Don't disclose this to anyone else

193
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:35,710
But I don't understand
Why shouldn't we tell anyone?

194
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,247
Sir, progress carefully

195
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:48,439
How did Ravi come to know this?

196
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,343
That is what I'm unable to understand

197
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,210
He should have been
informed only after preparing him

198
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,738
Hello

199
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,502
Yes...yes, Ravi

200
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:14,107
No, this is Balakrishnan

201
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,441
No, I'm sorry

202
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:20,446
Ravi,
I have some bad news

203
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,203
- Please stop the car
- Yes

204
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,078
P rem a, loo k

205
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,341
I know that you made
a mistake in Pisharini's case

206
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,708
It's okay

207
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,013
Don't worry about it

208
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
You just sign some documents

209
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,113
So that there are no legal issues

210
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,271
Okay?

211
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,605
Come, I'll drop you

212
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:33,481
If Jackie Chan and Tarzan
have a fight, who'll win?

213
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,377
- Jackie Chan will win
- Why?

214
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,973
Jackie Chan has got gun

215
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,240
There is knife in Tarzan's hand

216
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,608
It is a super knife

217
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,408
It is sharp
Do you know?

218
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,037
Then Tarzan will win
Go to sleep, my son

219
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,240
Jackie Chan knows
kung fu and karate

220
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,373
- Then Jackie Chan will win
- Jackie Chan knows how to run

221
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,404
Tarzan has got leopard
and monkey as companions

222
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,276
What happened?
Did you get any evidence?

223
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,075
I want the list of the medicines
which you give him, that is enough

224
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,079
Are they not heavy tranquilizers?

225
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,612
- Good morning, sir
- What is he doing here?

226
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,407
I'm on duty

227
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,510
I don't want to create
problem for anyone

228
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,069
I'm trying to help you

229
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,078
Are you not
discharging him today?

230
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,168
Sure

231
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,971
Sir, I want only a record

232
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,377
This won't become a news
It won't reach the court

233
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,538
There are ways to
finish it in chamber itself

234
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:31,634
Mr. Mani, let's go

235
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,007
Sure

236
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:38,141
I can legally get the medicines list
which Dr.Mani is prescribing Ravi

237
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,611
What list?

238
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,071
Won't there be some record?

239
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,178
My son

240
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,069
Father

241
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,438
I'm sorry, father

242
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,513
I created lot of tension, Isn't it?

243
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,046
That's all right

244
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,573
Doctor
How am I?

245
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,339
Perfect

246
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,277
Mother, Ravi?

247
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,711
How is he?

248
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,443
How is Ravi?

249
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,409
What are you saying, Ravi?

250
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,445
I was driving car

251
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,147
Suddenly...suddenly-

252
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:14,379
I felt something had happened to Ravi
He fell somewhere from top

253
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:15,673
Mother

254
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,371
Where is Ravi?

255
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,674
What happened to him?

256
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,271
Ravi

257
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,607
Sorry, doctor

258
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,477
Something has happened to me

259
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:45,782
I...surgery...Pisharini

260
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,341
Is he fine?

261
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,035
Hey, Ravi

262
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,046
He has got
internal injury somewhere

263
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,240
That is precisely why
his BP is going down

264
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,742
I took his scan report
and checked it

265
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,740
What did I look into it?

266
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,306
I'm not able to
remember it properly

267
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,313
I was coming in car
to say something

268
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,380
It was about Pisharini

269
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,343
Shit
I forgot

270
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,012
I forgot

271
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,205
It is okay

272
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,747
Take rest
We can talk later on

273
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,011
What happened to the surgery?

274
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,579
Is he alive?

275
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,578
On, No!

276
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,407
My God!

277
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,107
It is my fault
I forgot something

278
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:41,278
- Something vital
- Look, we did whatever we could

279
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,040
No, doctor

280
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:46,774
I forgot something

281
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,247
I'm to blame for this

282
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,104
It is my fault

283
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,176
Helpless, Pisharini

284
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:58,612
He was such an innocent soul

285
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,441
It is okay, Hari

286
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,411
Are you okay?

287
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,976
I'm perfect

288
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,540
But Ravi-

289
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,681
Ravi fell down
He has got a sprain on leg

290
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:17,179
Now there is nothing wrong

291
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:19,169
Oh...!

292
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,540
- Sir!
- Mother, you leave

293
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,477
There is nothing wrong with me

294
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,514
If Ravi calls,
ask him to phone me

295
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,670
Go

296
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,504
He doesn't even know who he is

297
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,978
Nowl also don't know who I'm

298
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,546
Ramana Maharshi says-

299
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,275
Can you cut this rubbish?
I need to take him and I'll do that

300
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:13,434
No

301
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,206
You won't

302
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,277
No one
will take my patient

303
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:25,406
It is I who will decide
what is good for him

304
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,343
Doctor, please

305
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:29,676
Whatever he does now,
we can't do anything legally

306
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:33,647
if you say like that, in India no one
can be done anything legally

307
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:38,342
Even if he burns down everyone in
this hospital, nothing can be done

308
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,013
A person who can't take
his own responsibility...

309
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:48,014
...is being taken over by government
I'll come back in an hour

310
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,978
I need that medicines list

311
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,671
It is a must

312
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:13,143
Hari and Ravi had an
incident in childhood

313
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,380
We went for trekking

314
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:26,271
Hari was lost whole day
from the radar

315
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:29,508
And Ravi was the first
one to realize it first

316
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,274
And he really cried

317
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:41,685
Hari said he sawa rare butterfly
and he went after that

318
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:45,143
And Ravi was the one
who really cried

319
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:47,042
Cried inconsolably

320
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,137
He continued to cry

321
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,638
He went totally out of control

322
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,510
He curled up on the rock

323
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,971
I could not handle him

324
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:01,411
He was blabbering this and that

325
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:06,712
He was crying
as if he felt suffocation

326
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:13,110
When forest guards
brought Hari in front of us...

327
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:18,139
...we didn't get back
only Hari but Ravi also

328
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,578
Now lets leave all that

329
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,536
Can you tell me about your sons?

330
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,013
Hari was a bit reserved and inwardly

331
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,180
Com pared to Ravi who was
flamboyant and outgoing

332
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:42,737
Other than this we can say
that there was no difference

333
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,038
Sometimes we'll feel that both
of them have one personality

334
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,545
I have only one child

335
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,443
During early days it was fun

336
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,044
Then we started getting scared

337
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,671
We felt if this continued,
they both won't have a life

338
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:03,307
Sol sent Ravi to my wife's
brother's house in Manipal

339
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,210
Hari remained here with me

340
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:08,771
Ravi was brought up
in a very liberal ambiance

341
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,308
Pampered

342
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,745
He joined engineering there

343
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,110
And Hari studied Medicine here

344
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:46,273
Hari was more like me

345
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:50,477
Well read, disciplined

346
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:54,270
Well mannered

347
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,337
Gentle

348
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,213
Such a gentle guy, doctor

349
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,571
Take it easy, Mr.Pillai

350
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,537
Ravi was never close to me

351
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,376
It was like he was angry with me
for separating them in childhood

352
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:26,080
Ravi always took Hari
for a father figure

353
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,203
I think I should speak to
your wife to their mother

354
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,578
Nobody can lead to their minds
better than their mother right?

355
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,116
They had no secrets
between themselves

356
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:42,171
To tell the truth
I or their father...

357
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:45,077
...doesn't know anything
about their personal life

358
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,704
One incident
that I remember-

359
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:06,280
Mother, do you know
what is there inside this?

360
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:12,181
Some top secret, classified,
for your eyes only information

361
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,441
- You want to see?
- Hey, what is this?

362
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:17,774
Give it

363
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,207
Mother, the full secrets
are inside this inside this

364
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,076
- It is inside this
- Go, man

365
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,143
One love story

366
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,975
There is nothing

367
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,037
He is saying just like that

368
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,709
He has not said anything
particularly about Prema

369
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:51,476
Some call it as Karmic

370
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:55,508
May be because it is

371
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:02,478
But I never felt this kind of an
attraction towards anyone else

372
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,046
I miss him

373
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,342
It is terrible

374
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,136
When did you meet him?

375
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:29,112
I mean what were
the first vibes like?

376
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:05,610
Close it

377
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,047
Sir, doesn't his mother
need to see him?

378
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,507
No

379
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:13,407
She need not see this

380
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,441
We'll bury him tonight

381
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:26,307
Stretch your hand
to the front

382
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,040
Yes, like that

383
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,641
That way Ravi's state is the reaction to
the challenges that are in front of him

384
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:37,375
Ravi is unable to tolerate
the pain of Hari's death

385
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:40,471
Naturally is Hari dies,
Ravi must also die

386
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:45,505
So Ravi's sub consciousness is
trying to prove that Hari is not dead

387
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,308
He doesn't wish to die

388
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,745
That is why his mind is trying
to find these kinds of methods

389
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,344
He is the inspector
I told you about

390
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,611
Nice meeting you

391
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,740
There is an
investigation in his name

392
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,642
Sure

393
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:24,440
He is my patient

394
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,502
You come to the clinic
We will talk

395
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,672
I'm not coming to talk
To arrest him

396
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:29,643
Why?

397
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,737
- What for?
- He attempted suicide

398
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,371
Do you have any evidence for that?

399
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,310
Early morning he went to
the work site at 2:30 AM

400
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,743
He climbed on top of the building

401
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,110
He is a man with
the disease of sleep walking

402
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,704
- I'm treating him for that
- He is not normal

403
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,769
The drugs that
he is using are-

404
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,412
Hey! Should you be telling me
what the drug reports are?

405
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,071
Else should I be
the one telling this?

406
00:35:49,134 --> 00:35:51,375
Doctor, please understand
He is a psychological patient

407
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,071
He'll do anything
He is dangerous

408
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,204
You don't look at what I think

409
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,544
I think it is you
who has got some problem

410
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,511
You seem really unstable

411
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,411
This obsession that is-

412
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,740
There is something behind this

413
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:24,105
Sorry I was a bit late

414
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,304
I had counseling

415
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:28,177
- So, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine

416
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:29,974
Shall we?

417
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:35,241
- Do I need counseling?
- Not counseling

418
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,610
Think of it as an exercise

419
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:43,015
Those who have gone through severe accidents
and have had mental shock are given this

420
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:47,072
- Are you going to hypnotize me?
- Well, it's a-

421
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:48,511
Interesting

422
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,579
I have also practiced
this a lot in college

423
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,246
Then I lost patience

424
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,146
- So, are you comfortable?
- Yes, I'm

425
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,541
That's good

426
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,549
Think that we are
playing a mind game, okay?

427
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,480
You get relaxed
we'll talk some matters

428
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:20,637
Right?

429
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:23,212
Right

430
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,373
Don't restrict anything
Don't hold back anything

431
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:31,609
Relax the mind
as far as possible, okay?

432
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,701
Sure

433
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:54,445
Can you hear what I'm saying?

434
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,648
Can you hear Ravi
what I'm saying?

435
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:03,237
Ravi

436
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,746
I don't know where Ravi is

437
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,244
It is many days since he called

438
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,677
Alright

439
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:11,978
What is your name?

440
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,341
Hari

441
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,475
Hari Narayanan

442
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:19,014
What is Hari Narayanan doing?

443
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,613
I'm a doctor

444
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,041
A surgeon

445
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:28,480
So what was your last case?

446
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:34,107
The last case
I could not attend

447
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,138
He is no more

448
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:40,209
He is one Pisharini

449
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,338
- Greetings
- Yes

450
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,739
He is my brother

451
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:06,274
Doctor, I'm unable to bear this

452
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:10,471
It is like the nerves will burst

453
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:25,076
This state of mine is something
above what you can understand

454
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:30,515
It is like that of the Hiranyan suffering
in the lap of Narasimha Munhy

455
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,671
That is what is me

456
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:48,015
I eat medicines
like eating food now

457
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:54,279
Before on eating medicine
the pain used to reduce

458
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,178
I'll come in a minute

459
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:02,109
Don't worry, okay?

460
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,440
Poor man!
He was a good fellow

461
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,338
What was he?

462
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,573
He was a Kathakali artist

463
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:21,374
He was...

464
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,338
- Have you seen?
- He was different

465
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,346
Have you seen?

466
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:34,141
- Very innocent
- You must see

467
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,515
I have seen only one person
smiling in extreme pain also

468
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:43,776
Wearing the attire of
Narayana Narasimha Munhy...

469
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,312
...when that Narasim han
stands on top of the stool

470
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,509
...the majesty and aggression
is something to be seen

471
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:56,072
He was the one

472
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:06,211
Ravi also used to like him a lot

473
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,515
I had a peculiar
attachment with him

474
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:22,475
I don't know

475
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:27,480
I don't know why?

476
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:30,514
Was he an old man?

477
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,413
Was he an old man?

478
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:39,776
Yes, he was 71 years old

479
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,740
What was his problem?

480
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:49,308
In renal artery
a surgical revascularization

481
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:52,373
It was a bit complicated case

482
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:53,741
I see

483
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,472
And?

484
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:59,246
It happened while
PTRA was performed

485
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,343
That was the problem

486
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,146
There was a problem in the artery

487
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:07,113
What is this PTRA?

488
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:11,644
Percutaneous Transluminal
Renal Angioplasty

489
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,008
I see

490
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,477
Go on

491
00:42:18,034 --> 00:42:20,514
So a surgery was required

492
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:27,182
For that I was going
to Greenways hospital

493
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:30,009
So he is not your patient

494
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:33,310
No, he was
Dr.Balakrishnan's patient

495
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,472
I was called when
there were complications

496
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,374
Mr.Ravi...

497
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,976
I'm sorry
Mr.Hari

498
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,514
Do you feel anything strange, Hari?

499
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,777
I mean a deep seated
unrest or distraction

500
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,638
Ravi has not called me

501
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:03,971
He has not remained
without calling for so long

502
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,274
Okaymokay

503
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:19,634


504
00:44:08,534 --> 00:44:10,639
This is what Ravi had

505
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,114
Where is the fork?

506
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:27,834


507
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,335
Hello?

508
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:54,479
When a doctor goes to OP late it creates
a very wrong opinion about him

509
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,742
I have myself
said this many times

510
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:02,280
Shit!
I'm late

511
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:06,014
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital

512
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,111
Just because I had a small wound,
how can I remain at home?

513
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,773
There are hundreds of patients
waiting for me there, mother

514
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,240
I should go

515
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:20,779
Hey!

516
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,043
Where is Ravi?

517
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,580
- Hari
- What?

518
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:33,744
Hari

519
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:40,134
<i>MBRHDRG</i>

520
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,579
Prema, come in

521
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,705
What happened to you?

522
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:30,543
Why?
Sit down

523
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,140
I was looking through these records

524
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:41,737
Do you have
the updates with you?

525
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,104
You seem so sick

526
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,679
Are you okay?

527
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,070
Yes

528
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:57,579
This Ragini Gowda, how is she?

529
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,207
Getting better

530
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:03,171
Okay, let's have a look

531
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:05,639
You brief me on the way, okay?

532
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:07,042
Come

533
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:12,674
Good morning, doctor!
Mam, report

534
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,213
Hi, how are you doing?

535
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,245
I'm better, doctor

536
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,608
Where are the files?

537
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,636
Where are the files?

538
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:07,007
- File
- Thank you!

539
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:28,505
Breath

540
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,470
Right

541
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,374
Now he doesn't have
any problem

542
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:39,172
Yes, sir

543
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:42,680
if he remains like this, he'll be
discharged in two days time

544
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:45,014
Okay, bye!

545
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:50,538
Harshad Begum, Greetings!

546
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:55,346
- Sir!
- How is he?

547
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,471
We'll feel it is Hari

548
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:09,071
This one time you send
him back from here somehow

549
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:12,080
In future I'll see to it
that this is not repeated

550
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,146
- Sir!
- Yes

551
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,180
Dr.Verma could not come today

552
00:49:21,267 --> 00:49:23,144
Why?
What happened?

553
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,237
Early morning the surgery started

554
00:49:25,334 --> 00:49:28,747
- B3118 case
- Isn't that a child?

555
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,778
Yes, sir

556
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,674
Her name is...Anasuiya
Am I right?

557
00:49:32,734 --> 00:49:33,576
Yes, sir

558
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:35,271
My QOOdness!

559
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,704
Who asked you to
put her on operation table?

560
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,972
Who?

561
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:46,081
- Dr.Verma
- Goodness

562
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,613
Arrhythmia was suspected in heart

563
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:53,146
I think it is PVC
Come, quick

564
00:49:53,234 --> 00:49:55,407
Do you have
the case diary with you?

565
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:01,014
Get her
And-

566
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,746
You better speak to
our HRI department

567
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,643
I need to talk to Dr.Prema
Where is she?

568
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,772
She is in the operation theatre, sir
She is attending a child

569
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,378
- Who is she assisting?
- Dr.Hari

570
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:29,605
okay

571
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:37,772
- Who did you say was with her?
- Dr.Hari Narayanan

572
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,775
Our senior surgeon

573
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,578
You dare to say
that a surgery is going on

574
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,977
Yes, sir
A major one

575
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,445
Sir, if it is anything urgent
you can use the intercom

576
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:29,305
- I want to meet Dr.Verma
- You don't have the permission to enter

577
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,437
This is police matter
It is very serious

578
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,604
I don't know

579
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,374
I don't have the permission
to let you in

580
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:39,746
Sir, for some time you
wait in Dr.Verma's room

581
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,673
- What is the matter?
- What happened to the surgery?

582
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:56,212
How is the child?

583
00:51:57,267 --> 00:51:59,577
- She is safe now
- Dr.Hari...?

584
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:02,648
She has been saved
because Dr.Hari came

585
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,046
Hey, what is happening?

586
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,111
Have you not seen
surgery before this?

587
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,977
You were looking
at me like this

588
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:26,744
I understand

589
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:33,251
Dr.Kuruvilla used to say that a
good surgeon is like a good musician

590
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:36,312
He improvises right on the stage

591
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:38,478
You know in stage-

592
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:39,477
Yes

593
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:41,307
Thank you!

594
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,179
Where was I?

595
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,473
It comes from...

596
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,641
I was doing this operation
and I suddenly realized that...

597
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:59,441
...it was conduction defect

598
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,978
You know conduction defect, isn't it?

599
00:53:02,034 --> 00:53:05,140
Abnormal fibers
conducting the cardiac muscle

600
00:53:05,234 --> 00:53:06,770
WBW syndrome

601
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:08,138
Yes

602
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,171
Surgical ablation
is precisely what I did

603
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:14,181
All said and done
that child had fate

604
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,712
That is the reason

605
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:20,214
- Hey!
- Father!

606
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,074
Your mother wants
to see you immediately

607
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,044
- What happened to mother?
- Nothing, she fainted

608
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,545
You go and see

609
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:32,204
I have to attend
the board meeting

610
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:36,306
But you are dressed like this
At least a blazer

611
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,175
Only if you go, it'll be okay

612
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:41,408
- You go
- 0kay...okay

613
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,170
Sir!

614
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,340
The thing that happened
here now is a major crime

615
00:54:11,434 --> 00:54:12,435
What is the crime?

616
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,174
What is the crime in
a doctor conducting a surgery?

617
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:19,614
- Ravi is not a doctor
- The one who died is Ravi and not Hari

618
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,235
Look

619
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:23,543
Don't you know law?

620
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,047
According to law a person
who is alive or dead...

621
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,444
...should be identified
by his relatives

622
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:33,505
All the other evidences are
only circumstantial evidences

623
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,982
The person to identify whether he is
Ravi or Hari is me and his mother

624
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,410
He is Hari

625
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:45,709
Now even if he himself refuses
there are no legal chances for that

626
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,270
Court will identify it as
only a psychic disorder

627
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,607
- Did you understand?
- Nowl'm dealing with two people

628
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:56,978
One psychiatric patient
and one criminal

629
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,410
Exactly

630
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:02,376
Now, get lost

631
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:11,304
- I can prove that
- Then you prove it

632
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,141
The one who died
is not Ravi but Hari

633
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,146
To prove that there
are only two evidences

634
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:18,306
One is postmortem report
Go and see what is written there

635
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,208
Listen-

636
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:23,579
Other than that the things in your hand are
finger prints and small evidences like that

637
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:26,773
It is there all over this
hospital where he is working

638
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,536
This is also my institution

639
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,477
Then there is only one record

640
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:32,138
That is there in your department

641
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,077
The evidences of that accident

642
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:39,049
To change that line by line,
what amount I paid you can ask me

643
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,441
See if you can get something else

644
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,071
If you get, you go to
court and get a warrant

645
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:47,637
On the basis of circumstantial
evidence no court will give warrant

646
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,045
If they give, you can
take me and him

647
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:04,413
To do operation and all
how is it possible?

648
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,640
In his sub conscious mind
whatever is there he brought it out

649
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,737
That is how Ravi
has changed into Hari

650
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:15,978
You know as a matter of survival
he has observed Hari very carefully

651
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:18,343
That is why Ravi could change as Hari

652
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,472
But there is a limit to it

653
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,010
What was his problem?

654
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:33,140
In Renal Artery
a surgical revascularization

655
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,171
Scientifically the activities
of the brain...

656
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:39,306
...are controlled by
a chemical called Dopamine

657
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,641
Com pared to the Dopamine
Inside our brain...

658
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:44,771
...it must be three times
more in Ravi's brain

659
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,107
By connecting the things
that Hari told at some point...

660
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:52,239
...Ravi is becoming Hari
due to that power in brain

661
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:53,711
Will show you

662
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:01,115
You know this red area
this represents dopamine activity

663
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:05,081
If a person is chased by elephant,
he'll run three times faster

664
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:08,046
That is what is happening
in this brain now

665
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,770
How many days like this?

666
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:13,640
A guy who is running away from
elephant can't run for a long distance

667
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:18,308
Inside Ravi his own
personality is getting restless

668
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,079
It is getting impatient to come out

669
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,114
That is why so much activity
is going on inside the brain

670
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,511
By the way where is he now?

671
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:44,413
Can't you see and walk?

672
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,537
I want to talk to you

673
00:58:03,467 --> 00:58:05,140
Shall we?

674
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:13,271
Somewhere else then

675
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,108
Come

676
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:27,010
Are we going to your house?

677
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,273
Yes, Ravi has not called me

678
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:37,180
Actually that is why I feel lonely

679
00:59:00,534 --> 00:59:02,707
Why are you not coming?

680
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,208
- Please come
- Mother...mother

681
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,338
Mother

682
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:17,005
Yes, she must be
somewhere inside

683
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:17,977
Please!

684
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,478
Please come

685
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:33,779
That was a good decision,
you know to come here

686
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,440
This is my nest

687
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:41,005
My room
I'm so comfortable here

688
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:44,577
This is where I lose
all my inhabitance

689
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:48,480
Sit here

690
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,204
Please, s it

691
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:18,205
This room

692
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:22,636
This is my nest

693
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,382
And I have dreamt about you a lot

694
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:32,603
In this room

695
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:51,112
Unlike my twin Ravi

696
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:55,605
I'm not the outgoing kind

697
01:00:57,034 --> 01:01:01,540
But believe me
that I'm a romantic

698
01:01:03,734 --> 01:01:07,238
No, that is not
the way to put it

699
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,471
I became a romantic

700
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,511
After seeing you

701
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,301
Wait

702
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,676
Look, I'll show you something

703
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:48,714
You remember this?

704
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:50,742
Do you remember?

705
01:01:52,034 --> 01:01:53,513
Try to remember

706
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,311
The day you came to join

707
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,504
That day.

708
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,241
I asked you to write a medical report

709
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:04,280
And you were so nervous

710
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:08,611
You started writing but
there were spelling mistakes

711
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,976
And the word usages go wrong

712
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:15,676
So every time you'll write,
crumple the paper and throw it away

713
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:18,408
Like that you did many
times for a long time

714
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:28,610
Then I would go and pick every bit
of paper that you threw on the ground

715
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:33,171
I'll pick them up
and I would collect it there

716
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:43,311
When you wrote this,
you were so nervous

717
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:47,344
You were so beautifully nervous

718
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:55,144
And...and your hands trembled

719
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,275
Not only this

720
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,573
The prescriptions that you wrote

721
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:08,976
Notes

722
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:11,673
Every bit of the thing
thatl could collect

723
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:14,078
I have it all in there

724
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,435
Wait

725
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,544
There is another thing
that you should see

726
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,446
Do you remember this?

727
01:03:55,233 --> 01:03:57,235
Last year's anniversary

728
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,638
You came in late

729
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:07,675
You had applied
lot of lipstick

730
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:09,269
Do you remember?

731
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,314
You used this
to wipe it

732
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:19,713
I took that too

733
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:27,716
Now I have your lips with me

734
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,004
Do you know something?

735
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,512
I kiss these lips every night

736
01:05:01,234 --> 01:05:02,304
What?

737
01:05:54,434 --> 01:05:56,311
I need to go now

738
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:00,580
I need to go now

739
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,270
I came for a record

740
01:06:25,034 --> 01:06:28,607
Last month for a surgery in Hosur
had you not gone, Dr.Prema?

741
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,008
Wait, P rem a

742
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:30,545
Yes

743
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:32,079
I'll drop you back

744
01:06:32,134 --> 01:06:33,670
Who were the surgeons?

745
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,003
It was Dr.Balakrishnan's clinic

746
01:06:38,067 --> 01:06:39,603
The patient was also his

747
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,079
When there was complication
Dr.Hari was called

748
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,475
Me also for help

749
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:46,605
Wasn't the accident when Hari
was coming over there?

750
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,337
Yes

751
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,744
Where you not the first one
to know about Hari's death?

752
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,206
Just a moment

753
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,177
The one who dies is not Hari

754
01:06:53,267 --> 01:06:55,372
The dead person's name is Ravi

755
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:03,717
- They were twins
- Doctor, this is not a joke

756
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,038
I think you are confused

757
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:09,081
Hari was going to hospital in car

758
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:12,171
Ravi was coming in
another car to meet Hari

759
01:07:12,267 --> 01:07:15,578
Ravi's car got crashed with a truck

760
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,276
- Listen, don't play around
- This is what happened

761
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:23,278
Hari is in a severe shock

762
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:25,711
It is Dr.Cheriyan
who is treating him

763
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,973
You can talk to Dr.Hari

764
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,677
So that is the story

765
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:35,569
It is not a story

766
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:37,146
It is a fact

767
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,137
If outside people here this,
they'll laugh

768
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,736
That is the case

769
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,610
His father says the one
who died is not Dr.Hari

770
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:59,979
That man is so powerful
He has people everywhere

771
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:04,106
He manipulated the documents all over
He has not left even a single proof

772
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,976
In front of my eyes
goat became dog

773
01:08:07,067 --> 01:08:10,640
- Now what should I do in this?
- You know what is happening

774
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:13,374
The accident took place on the way
when Hari was coming here

775
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:15,209
You know Ravi's mental state

776
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,506
I want a report

777
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,103
What records are there
in the hospital?

778
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,340
- I mean the name will be there
- I saw it was Ravi

779
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,971
It is their hospital
It is all fabricated

780
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:26,707
But how'll I give report?
I mean on what basis?

781
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,781
- Please, doctor!
- My God!

782
01:08:30,034 --> 01:08:34,039
Let me survive
I can't help

783
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:02,647
Dr.Prema, I know you are busy

784
01:09:02,734 --> 01:09:05,112
This won't take
more than 5 minutes

785
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,737
Couple of things
that I want to know

786
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,412
Do you know a person
called Pisharini?

787
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,441
Yes
Why?

788
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,277
Well during hypnosis Ravi was-

789
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:20,212
- Hari!
- Ya...ya, okay

790
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:23,714
Hari was talking about Pisharini

791
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,178
Was he a Kathakali artist?

792
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:33,139
Do you remember any
instances which can showcase...

793
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,307
...Hari's deep regard
and love for him?

794
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,438
Was Hari so much
in love with Pisharini?

795
01:09:53,634 --> 01:09:57,411
- Tell me Hari, what is it?
- It is Pisharini master's matter

796
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:00,177
I don't understand

797
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:02,508
He is taking heavy pain killers

798
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,013
And still he is complaining
of unbearable pain

799
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,146
I gave him immunity
enhancement drugs

800
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,680
Still the infections
are keep on coming

801
01:10:12,767 --> 01:10:14,747
I don't know
where it is going wrong

802
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,576
Hari, I have told you
many times before

803
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:20,307
Don't become so much
attached to patients

804
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:23,678
They need your expertise,
not your sentimentality

805
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:33,672
Well, that's it

806
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:36,237
I'll take leave of you now, okay?

807
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,371
One more thing Dr.Prema

808
01:10:46,467 --> 01:10:49,038
Do you like Ravi?

809
01:10:50,534 --> 01:10:53,515
I mean, did you love him?

810
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,077
What was your
relationship with him like?

811
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,238
Okay, I know it is
getting late for you now

812
01:11:19,334 --> 01:11:22,747
Bye and have a very
nice sunny day, okay?

813
01:11:43,367 --> 01:11:45,506
You are here
Come

814
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,647
Have a seat

815
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:53,668
Yes

816
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,708
You know what for
I have come, doctor

817
01:11:57,101 --> 01:12:00,048
You also know very well
what I'm going to say

818
01:12:00,134 --> 01:12:04,139
Doctor, you are protecting
your patient that is natural

819
01:12:04,234 --> 01:12:06,145
But you are a citizen too

820
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:10,205
Due to his madness may be
your children will suffer

821
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:13,244
I have heard this a lot

822
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:15,712
I know that he is not insane

823
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,508
To not even know his own
identity is what is sanity?

824
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:24,043
Insanity is something not to have
a logical order in behaviour

825
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:26,341
We can't predict
those kinds of people

826
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,177
Ravi is perfectly logical
and completely predictable

827
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:34,239
Nonsense, he is a Mad
A real mad

828
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:38,214
if he burns down this whole hospital,
what will you do then?

829
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,616
About this burning matter
you told Dr.Mani also

830
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:47,740
- He noted it down and told me
- Yes, it may happen

831
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:54,140
- ls your house in Erwadi?
- That is not the point

832
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,476
Erwadi which is
next to Ramanathapuram

833
01:12:56,534 --> 01:12:58,605
I have gone there
two to three times

834
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:00,044
As a student

835
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,048
A place where there are lots of
places for psychiatric treatment

836
01:13:04,101 --> 01:13:06,274
Am I correct?
Tell me

837
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:08,671
We are talking
about this case

838
01:13:08,734 --> 01:13:13,706
In Erwadi Sultan Shahid
Badshah's Darga Shareef is there

839
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:16,247
Many psychiatric patients come there

840
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:19,781
Next to that there are
many private hospitals

841
01:13:20,034 --> 01:13:23,538
- This Yunani form of treatment
- Please come to the point

842
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:27,742
Last time that
I went was in 1985

843
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:30,613
That time there was
a big fire accident there

844
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,477
One private mental asylum
got burnt down

845
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:36,569
Eight patients who were inside

846
01:13:36,634 --> 01:13:39,513
Stop it
Stop it I say

847
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:28,982
Allah! Allah!

848
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,680
Moulana Sahib
Please, see here

849
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:46,977
There is nothing wrong with me

850
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:50,174
I'm alright
I'm completely cured

851
01:14:50,434 --> 01:14:53,574
You can take me wherever
you want and check me

852
01:14:54,334 --> 01:14:59,716
Won't I ever get freedom?
Sahib, won't I ever get freedom?

853
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:05,079
Sahib, please help me

854
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:09,115
Moulana Sahib,
you don't interfere in this

855
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,113
Mad people don't remain
the same always

856
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,441
They'll talk very naturally

857
01:15:14,534 --> 01:15:17,413
But again they'll
become uncontrollable

858
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:23,073
Hakeem, he is now cured
Release him

859
01:15:23,134 --> 01:15:24,477
What I'm saying is-

860
01:15:24,534 --> 01:15:27,378
I promise on Allah and saying
there is nothing wrong with him now

861
01:15:27,434 --> 01:15:29,345
You discharge him

862
01:15:29,434 --> 01:15:32,779
I'm discharging him
on your words

863
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,178
Allah!

864
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:13,047
What is this?
Aiyoo! Aiyoo...

865
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:29,046
Hakeem...Hakeem...

866
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:41,276
I told you that time itself
You didn't listen to me

867
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:44,213
Now what to do? Allah...

868
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:18,244
You had a nervous attack
BP must have gone down

869
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:22,305
- Don't get up now! You'll feel giddy
- Its alright

870
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:26,638
I guessed the first time
itself when I met you

871
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:28,647
Before this when have
you got this attack?

872
01:17:28,734 --> 01:17:31,476
What? I'm absolutely normal

873
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:34,709
Yes, you are absolutely normal!
I know

874
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:38,278
I didn't ask that! Have you has
this kind of attack before this?

875
01:17:38,401 --> 01:17:39,471
No

876
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,503
Look, there is
nothing wrong in telling me

877
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:48,174
- You'll only benefit from that
- Are you trying to make me also a mad?

878
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:50,611
Again! There is
nothing called as madness

879
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,737
What you have is only obsession

880
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,179
That is deep down in the
root of your childhood

881
01:17:57,234 --> 01:17:59,544
I didn't come here
to enquire about myself

882
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,977
I came to enquire about a mad guy

883
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:02,171
About a criminal

884
01:18:02,234 --> 01:18:03,508
You are the one
who is protecting him

885
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:04,602
And you'll be answerable to that

886
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:06,977
Why don't you sit down?
Let us talk about that

887
01:18:07,567 --> 01:18:09,979
Listen doctor, there
is nothing more to talk

888
01:18:10,034 --> 01:18:12,674
I won't let a mad man go
around killing people like this

889
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:14,338
Officer, I just want...

890
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,970
Till nowl was straight forward

891
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:17,478
And you chose to do it this way

892
01:18:17,534 --> 01:18:20,378
Policeman has got many ways
to by pass the rules of law

893
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:23,176
I'll find him and shoot him down

894
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,502
Don't be so filmy, man

895
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,774
I have also heard some
interval punch dialogues like this

896
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,311
Go and have a cup of coffee

897
01:18:51,467 --> 01:18:53,344
Nothing happened
to anyone, sir

898
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,611
DnHaï¬‚

899
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:03,345
I don't know! He or him?

900
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:05,737
It was a minor accident

901
01:19:06,434 --> 01:19:11,383
- The one who died was Ravi not Hari
- No one died

902
01:19:12,267 --> 01:19:15,339
It is not a story
It is the fact

903
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:19,204
Get lost

904
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:29,772
- Whom did you want to see here?
- One doctor

905
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,780
Doctor! Who?

906
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:35,547
Last time when you came,
you could not meet

907
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:40,010
Last time only we two
had come here, isn't it?

908
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:43,714
Yes, do you remember?

909
01:19:51,634 --> 01:19:53,170
Of course

910
01:19:54,234 --> 01:19:56,737
That day you
were so romantic

911
01:19:58,734 --> 01:20:00,213
So emotional

912
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:04,543
Do you remember all that?

913
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:08,972
But...but you want to
see someone, isn't it?

914
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:14,411
- Yes, let us go there
- Sure

915
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,577
I like this place

916
01:20:37,434 --> 01:20:39,641
Yes, it is a nice place

917
01:20:56,334 --> 01:21:00,476
But that day Hari was
in some other dress

918
01:21:00,734 --> 01:21:02,475
A white d ress

919
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:08,369
Yes

920
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:20,342
- Same dress
- So...

921
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:48,308
- Shall I ask you one thing?
- What?

922
01:21:48,567 --> 01:21:50,376
Do you remember that day?

923
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,245
What?

924
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:03,577
I had told you a matter

925
01:22:04,634 --> 01:22:09,606
Here
In this same room

926
01:22:13,534 --> 01:22:14,569
Hari...

927
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:44,238
I remember

928
01:22:48,534 --> 01:22:50,104
I remember

929
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:19,203
Hari...

930
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:38,744
I remember
I...

931
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:46,138
Why did you take Ravi
to the resort, Prema?

932
01:24:46,234 --> 01:24:48,737
I wanted to tell Hari one matter

933
01:24:50,567 --> 01:24:53,480
- Something really important
- What did you tell him?

934
01:24:53,567 --> 01:24:55,638
About Pisharini's surgery of that day

935
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,078
I was not experienced enough to do it

936
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:01,411
I was forced to do it as
it was an emergency case

937
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:05,972
And it got complicated
I wanted to tell this to Hari

938
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:09,774
For that only I took
Hari to resort that day

939
01:25:47,134 --> 01:25:49,171
Where can I get Dr.Balakrishnan?

940
01:25:49,234 --> 01:25:51,009
- He is in seminar room
- Where is it?

941
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:52,671
-4th floor
- Thank you!

942
01:25:53,434 --> 01:25:56,438
- Hello, doctor!
- Inspector, Yousaf! Please come

943
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,674
- Guys, we'll finish this later
- Yes, okay

944
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,477
Are you still behind that?

945
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:07,276
Acop has got to be
insistent and obsessive

946
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,007
We have a term for that! OCD

947
01:26:10,067 --> 01:26:11,512
Obsessive compulsive disorder

948
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:13,171
When I feel I need a treatment,
I'll come

949
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,441
At present I have come
for some clarification

950
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:16,739
Sure! Go ahead

951
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:18,974
Dr.Hari was your consulting
surgeon isn't it?

952
01:26:19,034 --> 01:26:21,275
Yes, There are 2 to 3 of them

953
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:24,247
In surgeons it is Dr.Hari
and Dr.Rajat Shetty

954
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:26,212
Dr.Hari was a wonderful surgeon

955
01:26:26,267 --> 01:26:28,042
Affable and affordable

956
01:26:28,134 --> 01:26:29,704
Which was the last
case that he attended?

957
01:26:30,434 --> 01:26:35,213
It was a Kathakali artist
One Kesava Pisharini

958
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,540
Avery nice man

959
01:26:36,634 --> 01:26:38,204
It was when there was a complication in...

960
01:26:38,267 --> 01:26:41,976
...surgery that I called Hari
This happened on the way

961
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:48,046
Fate! I think Hari had an
extra attachment with Pisharini

962
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,579
In fact I asked him about it once

963
01:26:49,634 --> 01:26:54,583
He just smiled and said previous
birth connection or something like that

964
01:26:54,634 --> 01:26:55,704
And Prem a?

965
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,111
She is ajunior surgeon
Consultant

966
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,477
This is Dr.Hari's call list
There are only 3 names

967
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,274
Ravi, Prema and you

968
01:27:05,367 --> 01:27:06,402
Just before accident Prema had...

969
01:27:06,467 --> 01:27:08,606
...called him many three to four times,
but he didn't pick up the phone

970
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:11,170
But he spoke to you thrice
No, four times

971
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:12,372
Obviously man

972
01:27:12,434 --> 01:27:16,314
Next day there was a surgery and
he was very worked up about it

973
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:17,573
In fact he was bothering me

974
01:27:17,634 --> 01:27:19,739
After that he called you
ten times, but you didn't pick it up

975
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,676
Yes

976
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,341
See, Hari was a bit nervous

977
01:27:23,401 --> 01:27:26,575
And when he repeatedly...

978
01:27:26,634 --> 01:27:29,240
...called me, I put my
phone in silent mode

979
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:30,438
There was operation

980
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,980
He was not ready to
understand that rest was needed

981
01:27:33,034 --> 01:27:37,005
Strange! Why should a
surgeon become nervous?

982
01:27:37,267 --> 01:27:42,012
Did he know that there was some
complication in this surgery? Intuition?

983
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,441
Thatl could also not understand

984
01:27:44,534 --> 01:27:48,141
Then I thought he had become
that close with Pisharini

985
01:27:48,534 --> 01:27:50,070
This is your call list, doctor

986
01:27:50,134 --> 01:27:52,546
Can you write it down whose
number are they?

987
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:54,675
Am I a criminal?

988
01:27:54,767 --> 01:27:57,475
Sorry, it is a procedure
Don't be offended

989
01:27:57,534 --> 01:28:02,745
I was just kidding
Sure! Rules...rules...rules...

990
01:28:04,134 --> 01:28:08,605
A rule is a rule

991
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,442
Thank you! The third number

992
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:16,114
That's a wrong number!
Anything else?

993
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,372
That's all

994
01:28:19,134 --> 01:28:20,306
See you soon

995
01:28:23,034 --> 01:28:25,310
- Are you not going to sleep?
- Coming

996
01:28:28,201 --> 01:28:29,703
What is the tension?

997
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:34,044
This number belongs
to a telephone booth

998
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,636
It looks like a wrong number

999
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:38,147
The conversation has taken
place for only 12 seconds

1000
01:28:38,667 --> 01:28:42,638
But a kind of suspicion
There is something weird in that...

1001
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,180
...Dr.Balakrishnan's behaviour

1002
01:28:46,534 --> 01:28:47,774
Over casual

1003
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:53,976
- Hello, sir!
-It is me

1004
01:28:54,034 --> 01:28:55,206
I want the records of
all the calls that...

1005
01:28:55,267 --> 01:28:56,746
...were made that day
from that booth after that

1006
01:28:56,801 --> 01:28:58,439
- Immediately
- Right, sir

1007
01:29:05,334 --> 01:29:09,214
Munir is having high fever
He is talking this and that

1008
01:29:16,367 --> 01:29:18,643
<i>- Nb; so!â€œ
- Aw'.!</i>

1009
01:29:31,434 --> 01:29:33,277
Let us go to the hospital

1010
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:35,608
I checked the list, sir

1011
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,511
The next call has gone by
after 45 seconds

1012
01:29:38,634 --> 01:29:41,012
Call that number
Don't say who it is

1013
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:41,771
Sir!

1014
01:29:51,634 --> 01:29:54,706
Hello! May I speak
to Manjunath Mathod?

1015
01:29:56,101 --> 01:30:00,208
Who are you? Okay
I'm sorry

1016
01:30:02,534 --> 01:30:05,014
Sir, it is Dr.Balakrishnan's voice only

1017
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:06,137
It is he who must have talked

1018
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,339
I think it is a number which
he must have bought by giving fake ID

1019
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,313
Don't alert him now! Trace
all the calls of that number

1020
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,641
- And I want the details immediately
- Right

1021
01:30:16,734 --> 01:30:17,542
Hello!

1022
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,446
I'll come soon
It is doctor

1023
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:28,978
He suspects something
seriously wrong with Munir

1024
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,578
Sir!

1025
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:36,273
The platelet count is
a bit on the high

1026
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:38,039
I suspect dengue

1027
01:30:38,401 --> 01:30:42,042
But it is not very obvious
Let us see

1028
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:51,145
<i>Ash'.!</i>

1029
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:57,300
<i>tiff </i>

1030
01:32:15,734 --> 01:32:18,237
Dr.Balakrishnan's mobile
call list has come

1031
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,973
A bit unusual

1032
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:25,148
To a particular number he
has called more than ten times

1033
01:32:25,467 --> 01:32:26,741
Continuously

1034
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:30,143
That too all connected calls

1035
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:35,973
When I called that
number it was picked up...

1036
01:32:36,034 --> 01:32:38,139
...by the truck driver
who did the accident

1037
01:32:53,601 --> 01:33:00,541
Then Ravi had called once
The call duration is 1.47 minutes

1038
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:20,610
Dr.Balakrishnan

1039
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:23,614
There is no evidence that
he has direct involvement in this

1040
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:25,647
The one who had given him
the contract had told him to...

1041
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,237
...call on Dr.Balakrishnan's number

1042
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,608
That alternate one

1043
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:32,443
And he did the same
That much only he knows

1044
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:35,673
The payment was 5 lakhs
That very same day of the...

1045
01:33:35,734 --> 01:33:37,145
...accident he went away to Belgaon

1046
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,111
It is only two to three
days since he was back

1047
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:42,740
What about the motive? Without knowing
the matter correctly, we can't touch him

1048
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,446
- The case won't stand
- We can bring in Dr.Balakrishnan

1049
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,740
- No
- Let us question him

1050
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,404
It is such a waste of time

1051
01:33:49,067 --> 01:33:51,513
There is some other
conspiracy behind this

1052
01:33:51,734 --> 01:33:57,082
And if my intuitions are right,
Ravi knows that! Only Ravi

1053
01:33:57,467 --> 01:34:00,346
According to the call list
the day before he died Ravi...

1054
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:02,677
...and Hari had talked with each other

1055
01:34:03,434 --> 01:34:06,711
- What happened, Shobraj?
- He had a call from hospital

1056
01:34:07,034 --> 01:34:10,504
- What happened?
- Sir, your son...

1057
01:34:11,767 --> 01:34:16,767


1058
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,511
<i>Ask'.
Ask'.!</i>

1059
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:46,177
"Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!
Allah! Allah!"

1060
01:36:17,567 --> 01:36:23,313
"Yah Allah! Yah Allah! Habeebullah!

1061
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:28,782
"Yah Allah! Yah Allah! Habeebullah!

1062
01:36:29,067 --> 01:36:34,483
"Yah Allah! Yah Allah! Habeebullah!

1063
01:36:34,534 --> 01:36:40,280
"Allah! Allah! Allah! Allah!
Allah! Allah!"

1064
01:37:46,501 --> 01:37:48,742
Asir! Asir...Asir...

1065
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:26,046
Hello, Meghna! I'm Ravi's father

1066
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:38,116
"Julie...Aah...l love you..."

1067
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,241
I knew something was wrong
We were together

1068
01:38:44,467 --> 01:38:46,743
We were together the whole night

1069
01:38:53,067 --> 01:38:56,605
You don't be disturbed
Everything will be fine

1070
01:38:57,667 --> 01:39:00,011
Okay, how are the vital functions?

1071
01:39:06,467 --> 01:39:12,145
How is master now?
Hari, you don't worry

1072
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,406
By doing this you are
putting me also in mental stress

1073
01:39:21,467 --> 01:39:22,639
You know that

1074
01:39:26,067 --> 01:39:27,740
You know
You are there! You can

1075
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:29,781
You'll be able to
do something

1076
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:37,705
Relax! You relax and be calm

1077
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:39,478
I'll call you later

1078
01:39:40,201 --> 01:39:44,047
I'll call, Hari
Okay, bye!

1079
01:39:44,134 --> 01:39:46,171
Ravi was very disturbed

1080
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:51,482
He was on phone most of the
time talking to Hari

1081
01:39:53,467 --> 01:39:55,504
He didn't tell me what was the matter

1082
01:39:57,701 --> 01:40:02,150
I had to catch my early
morning flight and I left

1083
01:40:02,667 --> 01:40:06,080
Meghna, I know you are sad

1084
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:12,074
Butjust think about me and his mother

1085
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:43,203
Now he is Hari

1086
01:40:44,067 --> 01:40:48,482
But the other personality
inside him is trying to come out

1087
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:06,174
Hi, Ravi! Ravi!

1088
01:41:07,567 --> 01:41:10,241
No, mam! I'm his brother Hari

1089
01:41:18,267 --> 01:41:22,010
- You can come to the clinic if you...
- Ravi!

1090
01:41:23,734 --> 01:41:28,205
Well, for the time
being let him relax a bit

1091
01:41:28,734 --> 01:41:31,374
I'll administer some sedatives

1092
01:41:34,234 --> 01:41:37,647
It is better for him to go
to natural ambiance now

1093
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:42,343
There are no home remedies but
home could be a good remedy

1094
01:41:44,234 --> 01:41:46,180
For the time being take Ravi home

1095
01:41:46,234 --> 01:41:49,010
But he should be
under strict observation

1096
01:42:03,334 --> 01:42:06,213
- Yes, Mr.Yousaf!
- I have come to take Ravi

1097
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:09,304
- Listen, I told you...
- No need to tell me about rules and all

1098
01:42:09,367 --> 01:42:13,179
- Ravi is my patient
- Listen doctor, my son is dead

1099
01:42:13,234 --> 01:42:15,578
I'm still here because that
man is dangerous

1100
01:42:15,634 --> 01:42:16,476
Where is he?

1101
01:42:16,567 --> 01:42:18,308
Ravi is not here! He
has been taken away

1102
01:42:18,367 --> 01:42:20,438
He is heavily sedated, okay?

1103
01:42:25,301 --> 01:42:29,215
- Razia!
- Can you come home?

1104
01:42:29,767 --> 01:42:33,374
Razia, I'm a bit busy
I'll call you

1105
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:40,207
I'm not able to tolerate alone

1106
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:43,702
I'll come

1107
01:43:12,467 --> 01:43:15,971
Sylvester, time and again you
have asked me the same question

1108
01:43:16,067 --> 01:43:19,981
How many times I have told you
that they are just dormant partners

1109
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:23,671
We are using them as human shields

1110
01:43:23,767 --> 01:43:25,405
They are just silent partners
That's all

1111
01:43:25,467 --> 01:43:28,505
Otherwise will anyone give these
finger prints, signatures and letter head?

1112
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:31,445
Yes, the new one! She
is a recent colleague

1113
01:43:31,501 --> 01:43:37,315
Without reason will I do anything?
Anyway I'll call you later

1114
01:43:37,367 --> 01:43:39,005
Sylvester, I'll call you later

1115
01:43:40,334 --> 01:43:43,338
- Why did you ask me to come?
- Come

1116
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,047
I needed some more signatures
in some important documents

1117
01:43:47,167 --> 01:43:49,169
That Pisharini's case
became a bit complicated

1118
01:43:49,234 --> 01:43:51,009
No, no! Don't worry

1119
01:43:51,067 --> 01:43:54,446
Some stupid NGO's and Human
right activists are getting involved

1120
01:43:54,534 --> 01:43:57,037
So in case we need to defend
you in court of law, these are...

1121
01:43:57,101 --> 01:44:00,378
...some of the documents that
I need you to indorse! Come, sit

1122
01:44:05,267 --> 01:44:06,439
Excuse me!

1123
01:44:08,334 --> 01:44:12,612
Yes, hello!
Yes, Sylvester! One minute

1124
01:44:17,201 --> 01:44:20,444
Just sign here
Yes, Sylvester

1125
01:44:21,401 --> 01:44:24,712
Who? In Nagpur?

1126
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:29,606
Which consignment?
Who got...who got arrested?

1127
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:33,342
Hello! Talk from the
place where there is range

1128
01:44:35,101 --> 01:44:38,571
Okay, I'll call you back
I'll take care of it

1129
01:44:38,634 --> 01:44:40,136
I'll call back

1130
01:44:40,634 --> 01:44:45,583
Hello! Yes, sir! There has been
some problem in Nagpur

1131
01:44:48,801 --> 01:44:52,647
Did you hear of it? I have had
a talk with the commissioner

1132
01:45:03,734 --> 01:45:06,340
Okay? Don't worry about anything

1133
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:11,039
Throw money and finish the matter

1134
01:45:18,534 --> 01:45:23,415
I had my doubts
Drug testing on hapless people

1135
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,680
Illegal drug cartel

1136
01:45:27,567 --> 01:45:30,639
Other than Pisharini
who are the victims?

1137
01:45:31,467 --> 01:45:33,777
Other than me who are the props?

1138
01:45:36,634 --> 01:45:40,446
My mistake! I left
everything open for you to see

1139
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:44,342
It is okay
At some point you must know

1140
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:48,439
Because you are also involved
Can I get you a drink?

1141
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:54,708
This drug testing, drug cartels
it is all in the way you say it

1142
01:45:54,801 --> 01:45:57,543
Otherwise there is no big crime in it

1143
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:04,012
I don't understand
There are heavy pain killers

1144
01:46:04,368 --> 01:46:07,178
And still he is
complaining of unbearable pain

1145
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:09,303
I gave him immunity
enhancement drugs

1146
01:46:09,367 --> 01:46:13,474
Still infections are going on coming
I don't know where it is going wrong

1147
01:46:21,467 --> 01:46:29,010
You were using him as
a Ginny pig, isn't it?

1148
01:46:30,334 --> 01:46:32,507
That innocent man...

1149
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:37,715
Oh My God!
I also...

1150
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:47,480
- How'll I forgive myself?
- See again the way you say it Ginny pigs

1151
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,605
Prema, listen! Every regime
and every research has done this

1152
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:54,773
Now you and me! Every drug
and medicines have been...

1153
01:46:55,001 --> 01:46:57,311
...tested and tried on humans
Hapless humans

1154
01:46:57,367 --> 01:46:59,540
If you insist, before
it reaches us

1155
01:46:59,734 --> 01:47:05,184
Nazi Germany, Russia
Imperial Japan, USA

1156
01:47:05,234 --> 01:47:07,578
What do you think they are
doing in other countries?

1157
01:47:07,667 --> 01:47:11,774
Drug testing! If the medicine
is a success, winners everybody

1158
01:47:12,001 --> 01:47:14,208
History is made! And
if the drug is a failure

1159
01:47:14,267 --> 01:47:18,215
It is a crime! Illegal
Then about that Pisharini

1160
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:21,281
He would have died on road like a dog

1161
01:47:22,567 --> 01:47:25,514
I gave him a dignified end
Yes, he suffered

1162
01:47:25,567 --> 01:47:28,275
But for a good social cause!

1163
01:47:30,334 --> 01:47:32,507
He had a very good endurance power

1164
01:47:33,534 --> 01:47:35,605
I'll expose you

1165
01:47:36,401 --> 01:47:41,111
Expose! Deja vu
I have heard that before

1166
01:47:41,201 --> 01:47:46,048
From Dr.Hari! Just before he died
Do you know how he died?

1167
01:47:46,367 --> 01:47:50,474
It is better you don't know
What you don't know, cannot hurt you

1168
01:47:50,534 --> 01:47:53,413
It is better not to know some matters

1169
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:57,179
Sure I can't get you a drink?

1170
01:49:08,467 --> 01:49:09,537
Prema!

1171
01:49:22,367 --> 01:49:28,409
- Do you hate me?
- No...no, Prema

1172
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:34,606
I went away because I remembered
some matters about Pisharini

1173
01:49:35,534 --> 01:49:37,207
When you were told?

1174
01:49:40,334 --> 01:49:46,216
That day! I can
never hate you

1175
01:49:50,367 --> 01:49:54,611
You could have phoned me
You could have spoken a word to me

1176
01:49:54,701 --> 01:49:59,207
I kept calling you
You could have called me once

1177
01:50:01,234 --> 01:50:02,713
I talked to Ravi

1178
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:10,339
I could not sleep that night

1179
01:50:11,401 --> 01:50:15,543
And just before
sunrise I was driving my car

1180
01:50:16,634 --> 01:50:18,636
And then I called Ravi again

1181
01:50:22,734 --> 01:50:24,611
And then I called you

1182
01:50:25,567 --> 01:50:26,477
Yes

1183
01:50:26,667 --> 01:50:28,340
Whatever you do...

1184
01:50:29,734 --> 01:50:33,978
I can never hate you

1185
01:51:24,167 --> 01:51:25,510
Yes, Mr.Pillai
Tell me

1186
01:51:25,567 --> 01:51:27,308
- Ravi is missing
- What?

1187
01:52:37,734 --> 01:52:39,304
Something is wrong

1188
01:52:43,701 --> 01:52:46,511
I think I'm depressed

1189
01:52:47,634 --> 01:52:52,049
Else why should Dr.Cheriyan talk to me?

1190
01:52:52,101 --> 01:52:55,048
Let me think

1191
01:53:03,201 --> 01:53:07,377
- Are you going home, Hari?
- Yes, why?

1192
01:53:08,634 --> 01:53:15,244
You know when you are almost
there you used to mum ble something

1193
01:53:16,434 --> 01:53:18,675
Yesterday you didn't say that

1194
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,080
It used to give me a high

1195
01:53:26,701 --> 01:53:30,080
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you

1196
01:53:30,334 --> 01:53:37,013
You used to say kill me, baby
Kill me

1197
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:44,043
- Don't you remember?
- "I forgot everything"

1198
01:53:44,634 --> 01:53:47,774
"There is nothing that I remember now"

1199
01:54:09,034 --> 01:54:10,138
It's okay

1200
01:55:01,434 --> 01:55:05,075
<i>Ash'. AsirAsir'.!</i>

1201
01:57:28,134 --> 01:57:31,308
- Where did Hari's accident take place?
- Hosur road

1202
01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:37,707
Where is he?
Had he come here?

1203
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:38,505
Who?

1204
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:41,342
Listen, you know what
I'm talking about! Ravi

1205
01:57:41,634 --> 01:57:42,635
Come

1206
01:57:45,201 --> 01:57:46,680
You know where he is

1207
01:57:48,701 --> 01:57:51,648
That man is insane
A threat to society

1208
01:57:52,234 --> 01:57:54,771
In that case you should
not be going behind Ravi

1209
01:57:55,034 --> 01:57:58,413
- Are you fabricating new story?
- It is not a story

1210
01:57:58,467 --> 01:58:02,313
I heard that you lost your son
Isn't it? Dengue fever

1211
01:58:02,401 --> 01:58:07,214
In the medicines that are administered for
Dengue, do you know how many are legal?

1212
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:12,606
Indian pharmaceutical market has
been flooded with illegal drugs

1213
01:58:13,134 --> 01:58:16,115
Do you know who the
peddler of Decanlive is?

1214
01:58:16,234 --> 01:58:18,009
Take a guess

1215
01:58:19,401 --> 01:58:24,680
No, you can't know
you wouldn't know

1216
01:58:26,067 --> 01:58:28,343
Dr.Balakrishnan
Wait

1217
01:58:38,434 --> 01:58:40,141
Take a look

1218
01:58:46,567 --> 01:58:50,481
Drug names on the left
Core names on the right

1219
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:58,773
He is not running a hospital
It is a drug testing concentration camp

1220
01:59:01,567 --> 01:59:04,411
Life is stranger
than fiction, inspector

1221
01:59:05,367 --> 01:59:08,746
Those who are insane are actually good

1222
01:59:09,567 --> 01:59:13,174
They become insane because they react

1223
01:59:13,268 --> 01:59:17,739
If you are brave enough,
chase the real criminals

1224
02:00:15,334 --> 02:00:18,281
Ravi...Ravi...Ravi

1225
02:00:21,501 --> 02:00:22,639
Come

1226
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,107
Careful

1227
02:00:52,101 --> 02:00:55,548
RavimRavi

1228
02:00:58,067 --> 02:01:01,276
Meghna, why don't you
try calling him?

1229
02:01:09,567 --> 02:01:13,037
Ravi, it is me Meghna

1230
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:16,638
I'm Meghna, Ravi

1231
02:01:16,734 --> 02:01:22,275
Meghna, tell something
intimate between you both

1232
02:01:22,334 --> 02:01:24,439
Something which only you know

1233
02:01:27,668 --> 02:01:30,547
Ravi, kill me

1234
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:32,445
Kill me

1235
02:01:32,701 --> 02:01:34,180
Kill me, baby

1236
02:01:50,101 --> 02:01:52,012
I'll come in a minute

1237
02:01:52,801 --> 02:01:54,576
Don't worry at all, okay?

1238
02:01:57,034 --> 02:01:58,069
Ravi!

1239
02:02:01,167 --> 02:02:02,475
It is my brother

1240
02:02:05,101 --> 02:02:07,547
What is this, Pisharini master?

1241
02:02:07,634 --> 02:02:10,774
What has happened now that
you are becoming so tensed?

1242
02:02:11,034 --> 02:02:13,014
Will you kill me, please?

1243
02:02:14,467 --> 02:02:15,468
What?

1244
02:02:15,567 --> 02:02:17,569
Will you kill me?

1245
02:02:17,667 --> 02:02:19,738
Your elder brother
won't do that

1246
02:02:21,234 --> 02:02:22,611
He is innocent

1247
02:02:22,701 --> 02:02:26,774
He has got a golden heart
But you can do that

1248
02:02:30,801 --> 02:02:35,682
The pain is severe
I'm unable to bear it

1249
02:03:17,234 --> 02:03:18,975
I'm Pisharini

1250
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,673
Kesava Pisharini

1251
02:03:25,734 --> 02:03:27,645
You must have heard

1252
02:03:29,101 --> 02:03:31,081
I'm a Kathakali artist

1253
02:03:31,734 --> 02:03:39,277
My native place is
Paingulam near Shoranur

1254
02:03:40,134 --> 02:03:44,173
Ravi, this is just an illusion
Come out of it, please

1255
02:03:44,267 --> 02:03:47,714
With whom are you
talking this nonsense?

1256
02:03:48,234 --> 02:03:49,713
Ravi, please

1257
02:03:51,467 --> 02:03:54,175
Have we met before?

1258
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:03,471
Who is this girl?

1259
02:04:05,501 --> 02:04:08,482
Beautiful eyes

1260
02:04:10,034 --> 02:04:15,108
Have you practiced dance?

1261
02:04:20,134 --> 02:04:22,205
Whose place is this?

1262
02:04:26,034 --> 02:04:28,537
This looks like an hospital

1263
02:04:28,767 --> 02:04:32,340
Then you must have
heard of Hari Narayanan

1264
02:04:32,401 --> 02:04:35,280
He is smart and efficient

1265
02:04:36,234 --> 02:04:38,339
He is a man with a loving heart

1266
02:04:38,434 --> 02:04:45,147
In this old age I got love
and respect only from him

1267
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,512
Else who wants
this Kathakali artist?

1268
02:04:50,601 --> 02:04:53,548
It was when I
became a pauper...

1269
02:04:53,601 --> 02:04:57,606
...that I went to Mysore and had
bath in Manasa Gangothri river

1270
02:04:59,034 --> 02:05:03,710
It is there that I had
block in urinary bladder

1271
02:05:03,801 --> 02:05:06,042
I cried out of pain

1272
02:05:06,501 --> 02:05:12,417
Com patriots brought and got me
admitted in Dr.Balakrishnan's hospital

1273
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:18,008
He said it is free treatment
I had a comfortable life there

1274
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:22,310
Timely food and good room
Isn't that enough?

1275
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:27,043
But the intention
was something else

1276
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:30,145
He used me there
to test his medicines

1277
02:05:31,301 --> 02:05:34,043
Do you know that?
Do you believe me?

1278
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,480
He injected poison little by little

1279
02:05:41,434 --> 02:05:46,440
In the end before
taking me for surgery...

1280
02:05:47,767 --> 02:05:54,343
...a nurse came
and forgot her mobile there

1281
02:05:54,667 --> 02:06:01,209
Like God's grace from that
mobile I called Hari

1282
02:06:02,367 --> 02:06:04,313
He is like my son

1283
02:06:08,534 --> 02:06:10,343
They killed me

1284
02:06:11,267 --> 02:06:14,680
It is he who killed me,
that Balakrishnan

1285
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,211
Balakrishnan
(Baby lord Krishna)

1286
02:06:17,267 --> 02:06:19,144
The names they keep

1287
02:06:19,801 --> 02:06:28,152
When he realized that my son
Hari will expose him, he killed me

1288
02:06:32,234 --> 02:06:37,547
But he has not killed me fully
I also thought he had killed me

1289
02:06:39,267 --> 02:06:44,615
It is that when I entered his house
I realized I had not died

1290
02:06:55,734 --> 02:06:57,975
Ravi! What is this?

1291
02:07:04,267 --> 02:07:06,338
Ravi, what is this?

1292
02:08:22,267 --> 02:08:25,976
On seeing me he didn't recognize

1293
02:08:27,467 --> 02:08:31,108
He called me as Ravi

1294
02:08:32,267 --> 02:08:35,146
I told him who I'm

1295
02:08:35,501 --> 02:08:38,380
You should have seen his shock

1296
02:08:39,468 --> 02:08:42,415
Adead person
coming alive in front

1297
02:08:43,634 --> 02:08:48,344
The fear in his eyes
was not just fear

1298
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,077
It was the fear of death

1299
02:08:54,201 --> 02:08:56,078
I killed him

1300
02:08:56,134 --> 02:08:58,375
I just tore him apart

1301
02:08:58,467 --> 02:08:59,343
Ravi?

1302
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:21,773
Now only she remains

1303

Names as Prema (love)

1305
02:09:30,201 --> 02:09:32,181
I went to kill her

1306
02:09:36,201 --> 02:09:38,078
On reaching there...

1307
02:09:39,067 --> 02:09:47,111
...then I woke up just now
I got intoxicated

1308
02:09:48,101 --> 02:09:50,138
She got me intoxicated

1309
02:10:05,434 --> 02:10:06,469
Prema!

1310
02:10:06,667 --> 02:10:08,510

1312
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:16,543

1313
02:10:18,701 --> 02:10:20,442

1315

I had gone to
Dr.Balakrishnan's house

1316
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:41,044
Something strange
has happened there

1317
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:43,137
No nothing
I need to find him

1318
02:10:43,267 --> 02:10:45,440

- Doctor, where is Prema?
