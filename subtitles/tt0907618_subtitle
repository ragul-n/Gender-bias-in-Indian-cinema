1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:45,000


3
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,610
My friend is unemployed.
Is it okay?

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,280
Are you searching a
job for 10 years?

5
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,710
Not an answer you said is right.

6
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,720
I think he'll retire
without doing any job.

7
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,120
Sir...please, offer me this job sir

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,400
How long can I work in
departmental stores & petrol bunks?

9
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,000
I feel ashamed to be jobless.
I beg you sir.

10
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,970
Are you begging here?

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,180
Look at your face.
Bloody pushcart salesman. Get out.

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,240
Make a living as a porter.

13
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,950
Who allowed you inside?

14
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:47,590


15
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,800
I'll come with biscuit, next time.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,970
What a great office!

17
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,970
Street dog is conducting interviews.

18
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,180
I heard your wife has eloped
with your driver.

19
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,220
People are saying.
This job suits you well.

20
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,390
Ganesh, I got a job.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
I went for police selections.
I got selected as a constable.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,230
Ganesh, come.

23
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,710
What a nasty coffee he made.

24
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,880
I'll not go to school.
- If you don't, you'll end up like him.

25
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,250
Attending interview again?

26
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,060
You'll never come good in life.
Bloody wastrel!

27
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,730
Are you dodging me
to repay the loan?

28
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,090
I'll see your end.

29
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,500
Ganesh!
Attending an interview again?

30
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,260
Stop boy!
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

31
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,400
I'll give you 25 paise.

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,440
I can forget if I drink,
but it'll not allow me...

33
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,280
If I forget, I can drink,
but I can't forget...

34
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,620
Heart is like this only...

35
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,590
Man's life is like this only...

36
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:34,790
A man with heart can
never live in peace...

37
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,030
I warned him a lot but
he didn't listen to me.

38
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,010
I don't want to go home,
father will shout at me.

39
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,680
Instead of seeing him,
I prefer sleeping on road.

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,380
Uncle, Ganesh too is starving.

41
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,130
Bloody! Cheap drink,
even buttermilk isn't working on it.

42
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,860
Would you like to have buttermilk?

43
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,800
If you don't want, forget it.

44
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,310
I saw Dosas near my bed,
did Vasu left them for me?

45
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,020
I need Rs.100, for application.

46
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,520
I don't have.

47
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,090
Don't lie.

48
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,260
Okay, I won't give you.
- Why?

49
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,300
It's my money. My wish.

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,100
Am I not watching that channel?

51
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,270
My TV

52
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,770
Will any man live in this house?

53
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,720
Who said you're a man?

54
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,040
Am I a dog then?

55
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,320
A dog follows the order's loyally.

56
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,860
I'll get a job someday.
- Only fools dream.

57
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,390
What the hell did you
achieve in life?

58
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,100
For 30 years the same teacher's
job without any change.

59
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,370
Are you advising me about life?

60
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,810
I am bearing you for 30 years.
Isn't that a great achievement?

61
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,780
The brief you're wearing
isn't earned by you.

62
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,420
Men of your age have studied well,

63
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,720
Got married,
living happily with kids.

64
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,660
What about you?
You're still licking my ass.

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,330
A son is one who takes
care of aged old parent.

66
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,130
Not one who lives all his life
on father's old shoulders

67
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,410
Thank God!
I have a job for decent living.

68
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,680
If not you would've
killed me long back.

69
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,380
My sight has diminished.

70
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,690
I'm not able to stand for
more than 10 minutes.

71
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,020
I'm coughing all the night.

72
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,930
Do you know how many times,
I'm visiting hospital in a week?

73
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,640
Sons like you are useful only
to cremate parents.

74
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,130
Take...Rs.100

75
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,940
Buy application...or buy drinks
or go to a prostitute.

76
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,990
What are you looking at?
Will you die if I touch you?

77
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,430
Are you going to office?
- Yes.

78
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,330
Go....

79
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,160
Slow...slowly.

80
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:13,240


81
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,310
What happened to me today?

82
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,290
What's this new commotion
in my heart?

83
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:34,400
Shining garland of clouds...
As rain drops are showering...

84
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:43,470
Seeing my lover's beauty...
Why am I sweating?

85
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,240
Which sculptor's master piece
is this statue?

86
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,350
Her beauty is all new to me...

87
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,420
Her beauty is making
my eyes to forget to bat...

88
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,420
A new strange passion
is taking over me...

89
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,630
Unforgettable magic...

90
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,430
Feeling very thirsty
in pouring rain...

91
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:42,330


92
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,980
A rainbow has descended on
earth in gentle rain...

93
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:10,090
It lost sheen seeing
her luminous beauty...

94
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:18,070
Her beauty is pulling me
towards her...

95
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:26,080
Ever since then my legs are
following her only...

96
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:34,590
When a dawn is visiting at
midnight before me...

97
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,690
My mischievous eyes
broke into a joy...

98
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,420
Rain drops are getting wet
and dancing happily...

99
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,670
My heart broke into
a song happily...

100
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,330
My body danced in a trance...

101
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:47,950


102
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:05,640
When I see her beauty...
I'm sleepless...

103
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,010
When she sees me,
my heart can't take the thrill...

104
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:22,720
She spellbound me with her
gentle mischievous smile...

105
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,230
Jas the crescent moon bloomed
from her sensational curves?

106
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,970
I stood before my eyes
like a dream...

107
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,970
I forgot the world as
my dream came true...

108
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,950
First time I saw a lightning...

109
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:50,060
I rushed & gushed towards her
like a sea on high tide...

110
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:25,550


111
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,520
What's this? Is the world
coming to an end?

112
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,800
I'll come...I'll come fast...
I've to study now.

113
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,750
Are you coming? Where?
Are you drunk?

114
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,120
My study...

115
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,450
God! Have you made him
go mad now?

116
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,290
I'm going in because
you showed me the way.

117
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,230
Your wish.

118
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,310
Isn't her speech sensational?

119
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,360
No...always like this only.

120
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,600
I feel like I know everything,
but I can't remember it.

121
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,510
Think peacefully without tension

122
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,840
Excuse me.

123
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,730
God is there.
How you had chided me?

124
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,270
You said I can't buy my own brief.

125
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,700
Now, I've passed the written test.

126
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,130
Is he calling me to make fun?

127
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,970
What? What happened?

128
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,910
It seems my son has
passed the written test.

129
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,310
Still he has to pass
group discussion & interview.

130
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,110
He'll never make it.

131
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,590
Do I've to speak in English?
Can't I speak in Telugu?

132
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,760
I'm not good in English.
- Did I ask you?

133
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,990
You speak.

134
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,000
Say something other than yeah!

135
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,670
What's your problem?

136
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,610
I'm not fluent in English.

137
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,280
Then, speak in Telugu.

138
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,150
It's important to tell your views
in a group not the language.

139
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,920
Is it insult to speak in Telugu?

140
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,830
We are all Telugu speaking people.

141
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,560
Okay go ahead.

142
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,360
You've courage, don't you?

143
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,700
Many speakers here
belittled India economy

144
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,270
What happened?

145
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,110
It seems he has passed the
group discussion too.

146
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,820
He called me there
as he's feeling nervous.

147
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,280
Will he get the job if I go there?

148
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,930
How many more tests?

149
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,920
Anyway, you'll fail again there.
It's routine for you.

150
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,550
Why to waste time here?
Come let's go home.

151
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,220
Will you shut your gob?
- Give me respect.

152
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,190
Why did you call me here then?
- Who asked you to come here?

153
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,360
You said you'll feel better
if there's any companion.

154
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,500
I said any companion not you.

155
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,240
I must beat myself with slippers
for coming here leaving my work.

156
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,000
Sorry, you're wearing shoes today.

157
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,480
Stop.

158
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,390
Say hello to her.
Why are you just watching here?

159
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,850
She's going away. Come on say.

160
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,100
Did he really pass two tests?

161
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,100
Madam...that's...
you please carry on...

162
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,940
Why are you so elated?
Were you sure I'm useless?

163
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,670
I did feel like all these days.
Did you ever get yourself a job?

164
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,280
Suddenly when I heard you passed
a test with software solutions...- You...

165
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,250
I don't know whether
I'll get the job or not.

166
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,150
But I shouldn't see you here
when I come out.

167
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,990
I saw your lousy face.
I'll not get this job.

168
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,540
Not selected, right?

169
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,910
Forget it.

170
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,520
It's a great achievement
that you've come so far. Come.

171
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,510
Father.

172
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,690
I got the job father.

173
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,690
I'm not a useless man anymore.

174
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,670
Come let's have a coffee.

175
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,820
This way.

176
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,620
You go.

177
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,060
Starting salary is Rs.15000,
in a year, it'll be Rs.25000.

178
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,620
They will send me abroad
also for training.

179
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,660
At last, after years of wait...

180
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,570
I must buy a good watch.

181
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,240
You retire immediately father.

182
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,130
Take rest at house.
Why do you want to work?

183
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,070
Stop the bike.

184
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,310
Stop the bike.

185
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,120
What did you say?
- Are you mad, dad?

186
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,060
I'm not mad, you've grown
bigger to your boots.

187
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,600
I expected this from you
as soon as you get a job.

188
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,800
Should I retire?
Should I sit at home?

189
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,100
Become your maid servant,
cooking, washing & serving you.

190
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:38,570
Even to buy a medicine or biscuit
I've to beg you.

191
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,690
I'll never depend on anyone.
I'll live on my own.

192
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,520
I'll never ask anyone.
If a situation comes like that,

193
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,360
I'll kill myself.

194
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,990
You're not talking to me again.

195
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,390
Relationship of father and son
is snapped from this moment.

196
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,530
Go...go away.

197
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,970
What did I say now to make
you so furious?

198
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,800
I said like that to comfort
you at this old age.

199
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,700
Again same words.
- Why are you taking serious?

200
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,640
I'll kill you...stop...stop.

201
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,250
Why is he sleeping so early?
Wake him up.

202
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,480
Get up...get up...Vasu...
- What's it.

203
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,950
I got a job.
I got a job....

204
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:26,420


205
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,900
I'm unable to bear the torture of
beggars early in the morning.

206
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,830
Oh Lord Vinayaka!

207
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,250
Is it office or some hermitage?

208
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,620
What's that forehead full of designs?

209
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,090
God!
- Who is working here, you or God?

210
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,920
Wipe it away.
You look like a sorcerer.

211
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,070
Trying to cheat the world with disguises.
Come.

212
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,160
What's this man?

213
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,930
Can't you come to office on first day
after visiting a temple?

214
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,410
Look at the clean forehead.

215
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,050
I too told him the same.

216
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,780
Ask Keerthi to train him

217
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,590
He's God. He gave me Keerthi!

218
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,040
She's a different kind. Come.

219
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,650
Have you forgotten me?
On the interview day...

220
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,270
Was it you who spoke in Telugu
in the group discussion?

221
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,210
Remember me?
You helped me a lot that day...

222
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,770
I said like that to help you a little.

223
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,710
But from now onwards
only English will do here.

224
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,890
Ask me if you've any doubt.

225
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,430
Why are you still standing here?

226
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,300
This isn't a school to
start from alphabets.

227
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,150
Why this torture has been
assigned to me?

228
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,710
Why do you unnecessarily
get shouted by her?

229
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,740
I can't understand anything.

230
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,980
She has no patience.

231
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,480
I fear she may beat me in anger.

232
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,080
It seems she's the most
strict officer here.

233
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,080
And you got struck with her.

234
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,260
Take this basic study material.

235
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,590
Be careful.

236
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,960
I must get the books back next week.

237
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,670
If you damage any book...

238
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,840
Take an auto to home.

239
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,300
Ramu, you go.

240
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:11,950
Can't you tell before starting?

241
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,190
Madam! Are you always like this only?
Long faced.

242
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,360
You can smile at times.

243
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,860
Nothing...you carry on.

244
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,960
This isn't office it's road,
you're not my trainer here.

245
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,570
This is a free country.
I can say anything freely.

246
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,450
Smile sometimes.
It's good for health.

247
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,180
Come on say bye to me.

248
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Did she see me?
Did she really see me?

249
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,650
Did she look at me?

250
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,190
Did she?

251
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,730
Did she see or was it hallucination?

252
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,310
I feel like trains are chugging
in & out of my heart.

253
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:51,970


254
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,020
She'll not look at me.

255
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,490
Bloody, I can never understand this.

256
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,500
What happened?

257
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,930
Why did you allot him project
without proper training?

258
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,080
Is it a playground to
play as you wish?

259
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,710
If you don't like doing job,
stay at home.

260
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,410
I've to deliver it by tomorrow.

261
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,510
You go.

262
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,230
That's all.
Do you've to cry for such silly things?

263
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,300
Please smile at least now.
It's always good to health.

264
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,010
Watch! I think you're going to smile.

265
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,910
It's coming.

266
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:37,260


267
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,600
Giving life to my heart...

268
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,670
Gifting your heart to me...

269
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,580
Sharing your love with me...

270
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,780
Building a bridge to my youth...

271
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,740
Opening the door of love to me...

272
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,110
Opening the room of my heart...
spreading a bed...

273
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,690
You are presiding there
forgetting the world...

274
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:44,330


275
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,010
Your looks make the sun to freeze...

276
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,020
Your touch will make the
moon to sweat...

277
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,030
For your free & frankness...
For your affection...

278
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm in a world of illusion...

279
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,870
Withered leaves turned into flowers
when you walk on them...

280
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,910
Even crows turned into poets
seeing your beauty...

281
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,810
For your dreams...
For your tales...

282
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,970
It's happiness all over...

283
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,810
Praising me beautifully...

284
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,720
Asking me something later...

285
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:21,460
You've created ripples in
my serene pond like heart...

286
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:32,430


287
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,920
Talk to me a word affectionately...

288
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,920
Walk a step with me...

289
00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:00,930
It'll be a cherished memory for
all my next 10 births...

290
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,000
I must take refuge
at least once in your lap...

291
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,940
Sleep on your heart once...

292
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:17,010
I can spend my life happily
with these sweet memories...

293
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,850
I've noticed your desires...

294
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,960
I've recognized your anxiety...

295
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,060
Unable to decide...
Unable to answer you...

296
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm watching you silently...

297
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,290
How was I earlier?
She took me to the top.

298
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,860
You must meet her.
You'll die in jealousy.

299
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,900
I'll get the best wife amongst us.
Watch it.

300
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,160
Her hostel number.
You must call & tell her.

301
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,730
That Ganesh loves you very much.

302
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,840
Your name is written
all over his room.

303
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,670
Then, if you say no, he'll die.

304
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,220
His heart is throbbing for you only,
tell her everything.

305
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,320
And ask if she too loves me.
She'll definitely say no.

306
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,790
Don't leave her till she
accepts my love.

307
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,150
One more important thing

308
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,230
Tell her I don't know anything
about this phone call.

309
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,760
Do you want to escape
making us scapegoats?

310
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,370
No, I've to adjust now
for further problems.

311
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,370
Coins! You go on talk to her,
I'll insert coins continuously.

312
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:53,100
I've auditing in my office,
I'll take leave. Bye.

313
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:59,080
I'm down with dysentery.
I've to consult doctor.

314
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,510
Bye.- Bye.

315
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,120
If you don't call her now on phone,
I'll never see you guys again.

316
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,260
Ganesh, try to understand us.

317
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,330
This is a matter of your life.
I can talk any nonsense.

318
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:17,600
Seenu is a brave man.
He has good rapport with girls.

319
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,270
Your love will succeed.

320
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,410
Man! He's our friend.
Take care of him.

321
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,440
We must help him. Bye buddy.
I really have urgent work, bye.

322
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,010
You stay.

323
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,680
Is she coming?

324
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,620
Keep your hand steady.

325
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:45,350


326
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,290
We'll deliver it at home.

327
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,600
Why did you say bank?

328
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,970
I'm scared buddy.
I can't do it.

329
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,540
I'll be embarrassed
if this leaks out.

330
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,040
A police in criminal act.
They will spit on my face.

331
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,810
No need of all this, come.

332
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,180
I don't know how you do it,
you must tell her.

333
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,180
My brain is heated.

334
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,950
If you don't tell her,
I'll kill you.

335
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,780
Keerthi, phone for you again

336
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,460
Hello, I'm Ganesh speaking.

337
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,060
I'm Ganesh's friend Seenu speaking.

338
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,960
Oh! I told her my name.

339
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,770
He loves me.
No...he loves you.

340
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,970
If you refuse, I'll die.
No...no...he'll die.

341
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,770
Next...next...what next?

342
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,120
He has written your name
all over his room.

343
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,290
I don't know anything
about this phone call.

344
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,390
No...you don't know.
Oh my God!

345
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,590
Actually Ganesh doesn't know
anything about this phone call.

346
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,800
I haven't seen him for a month.

347
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,630
In fact I don't know him.

348
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,330
Tell me whether
you love him or not?

349
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,800
Then...I'm not a policeman,
I'm a beggar in Railway station.

350
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,140
Ganesh loves me?
- Yes.

351
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,810
Thank God! That's it.

352
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,340
She got the message, Ganesh.

353
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,190
No...Naresh...Mahesh...Suresh...

354
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,960
If he has courage, tell him to
express his love to me.

355
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,500
Tell bravely. Okay. I'll tell her.

356
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,370
Do you've a friend named Seenu?

357
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,770
Oh no...No...I don't have any friend?
In fact I don't have friends.

358
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,280
What was the name you said?
Seenu?

359
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,920
Seenu? What a lousy name?
Nobody will befriend such a man.

360
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,420
Where were you last night?

361
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,860
Last night? I slept off after
reaching house from office.

362
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,330
No...I got news about my grandpa's death.
I went to my native place...

363
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,660
I wasn't in Hyderabad at all...

364
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,640
Some one used your name and
made a silly phone call.

365
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,810
Be careful.

366
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,010
Who is that bastard?
I'll kill him.

367
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,330
You told me, right?
I'll take care.

368
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,540
By the way...
what did he say on the phone?

369
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,750
He said you've gone mad and
taking you to mental asylum.

370
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:38,930
Did he say that?- Then, you've to go
to Australia for a new project.

371
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,770
3 others have been
selected with you.

372
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,100
Who are the 3?

373
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,280
You, Balu sir and Daniel.
- No I'll not go.

374
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,140
How can I leave you and...

375
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,150
I mean how can I go
leaving you all here?

376
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,160
Take care of the project
till we come back.

377
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,290
You mean...you are also going.

378
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,000
Which place did you say?
- Australia.

379
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,870
Australia? I want to see Australia.

380
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,440
Please, I'll also come.
Take me with you.

381
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,180
Just now you said you can't leave
all these people behind.

382
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,750
Why can't I?
Bloody useless people.

383
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,990
I can live as long as possible.

384
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,210
Don't go overboard.
You'll fall flat on face.

385
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,180
Jealousy!

386
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,850
Master! Till now you'd
worked for so many years

387
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,350
Did you ever cross Hyderabad?

388
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,550
You know the spelling?

389
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,740
Ganesh, for Rs.2000, you can.

390
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,570
Rs.2000? It's unjust.
Take Rs.1000.

391
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,150
If you can't, leave it.
Many others are in the queue..

392
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,910
Is it a joke to sit next to Keerthi?

393
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,350
One day, one night,
Keerthi next to you.

394
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,790
How lucky one must be to enjoy it?

395
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,330
You can't. People are offering
Rs.5000 or Rs.10000. Leave me.

396
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,760
Take it.
- Respect for me is diminishing.

397
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,940
Aren't you talking mercy?
Come kiddo, Balu.

398
00:46:52,540 --> 00:47:02,500


399
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,820
God save me

400
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,200
You next to me?

401
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,500
Fasten the best.
- I've already fastened it. Look

402
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,010
Not the pant belt, fasten seat belt.

403
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,190
Never boarded a flight before?

404
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
I'm seeing a flight for the
first time in my life.

405
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,690
Oh God! How do people drink this?

406
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,220
I had to do all this for Satan Balu.

407
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,460
Balu, have it.
Why are you feeling shy now?

408
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,580
I can't understand Indian English
and you're too much.

409
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,390
Wherever you go,
same men, same behavior.

410
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,560
Hey kiddo! Come here.

411
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,710
You ask.
- How can I ask her? He'll ask.

412
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,850
Tell her.

413
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,760
We come rarely to foreign country.
Shouldn't we see the places?

414
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,500
No use of going to hotel room now

415
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,830
Where shall we go then?

416
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,770
You go to the hotel.
Don't take risk. We'll look around.

417
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,540
If anything happens to you,
I'm responsible for it.

418
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:52,770
I'm coming with you.

419
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,180
Tell me the truth,
where are you going?

420
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,840
Balu sir suggested a club.
- Which club?

421
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,310
No...they are young men,
for an evening of fun...

422
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,920
I'm also a young woman, ain't I?

423
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,250
Come, I'll also have fun
along with you.

424
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,670
Please don't say no.
Let's enjoy for few minutes.

425
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:33,270


426
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,710
Hello! Stop acting, you too join
the crowd to enjoy fun.

427
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,880
I'm not interested.
- Why?

428
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,020
Leave it.
- Come out.

429
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,560
A man in love will not feel
like seeing all this.

430
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,910
He sees his lover in any woman.

431
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:56,970
How can he?

432
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,900
Do you see your lover in them?

433
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,820
Yes, what a great dancer she is!

434
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:16,820
Enough!

435
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,430
What are you drinking.
- Orange juice.

436
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:30,710
Order a juice for me.
- That is...

437
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,280
Who is your lover?

438
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,180
You!
- What?

439
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,960
I mean a girl like you.

440
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,660
Same height, same weight,
same face. Everything same!

441
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,490
What's going on?

442
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,220
I'll beat you black & blue.

443
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,230
Be silent.

444
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,690
Shut your mouth.

445
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,130
I'll kill all of you.

446
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:48,010
Why is the way zigzag?

447
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,740
What's this?

448
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:14,900
Look.

449
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,210
You...

450
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,650
Come...let's play.

451
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:34,430
How many pegs you had?
Entire bottle?

452
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:39,600
Rascal! I asked for orange juice
but he supplied something else.

453
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,640
I will...

454
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:50,570
Where are you rushing?
- Leave me...I'll kill him.

455
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,250
Okay, let's kill him tomorrow.

456
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,720
Who are you man?

457
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,830
Good! You don't remember me too.

458
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,460
I'll kill you...
be ware. I'm coming.

459
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,860
I'll kill you...
I'm coming.

460
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,530
How can I leave her
in this condition?

461
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,370
I think she'll jump out of window.

462
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,700
Madam...look...
- What?

463
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,110
I'm leaving.
Will you lock the door and sleep?

464
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,940
I'll go out.

465
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,850
What should I do then?

466
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:32,290
You sleep here.
There.

467
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,190
You mustn't come here.
I'll kill you.

468
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,660
You can remember this very well.

469
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,590
I want to sleep.

470
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,310
If you go away,
I'll also go out.

471
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,740
You...
What are you doing in my room?

472
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,480
You're in a towel.

473
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,720
My dress. Night dress

474
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,090
Where is my dress?

475
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,660
Look...nothing has happened
as you're imagining.

476
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,140
You had drinks and threw up.

477
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,900
So I had to clean & stay back.

478
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,430
Don't you remember anything
that happened last night?

479
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,110
Who are you to do change my dress?

480
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,150
I didn't change but a lady worker
did it sending me out.

481
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,550
Inquire if you've doubt.

482
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:12,920
Couldn't you go out after that?
Why did you stay in the room?

483
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:17,060
You will ask now.
You forced me stay here only.

484
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,990
You'll say like that.

485
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,360
Did I ask you to stay in my room?
Don't lie.

486
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,930
Look, you slept like a log.

487
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,580
I was here like a security as guard.

488
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,740
Believe it or not.
Your wish

489
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:21,850


490
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:27,390
My girl's eyes have
a net of charm...

491
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:33,190
Her wet lips are inviting
to be it's companion...

492
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:40,340
Her tender waist is sensuously
moving towards me...

493
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,420
You're man's pride...
it's killing me with desire...

494
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:40,300
Pinch my cheeks...
Be guest on my bed...

495
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:46,540
Don't lure and trap me
with your sensuous beauty...

496
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:52,680
If I lose control,
your youth will get devastated.

497
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,720
If you're such a macho man,
why don't you come with me?

498
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,690
Come fast...
take me in your arms...

499
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,590
Leave your marks
of love on me...

500
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:10,460
Don't rush my dear.
You've no place in my heart...

501
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:16,730
Play with my body...
Sing songs of love...

502
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:27,470


503
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,760
You trap us with your beauty...

504
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,700
You'll squeeze our hearts
and kill us mercilessly...

505
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,540
Why have you created women
on earth, O Brahma, the creator?

506
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,270
We'll entangle you gently...

507
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,750
Our language is
completely different...

508
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,760
I desire you and
I've become...mischievous...

509
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,960
I can't hide it or tell you openly...
I'm in a state of confusion...

510
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:55,570
Your heart's wishes
will never come true...

511
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,240
Don't discourage me...

512
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,940
I'll be happy if I get
what I wish for...

513
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:12,910


514
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:54,690
Please...in an emotion...
Please don't mistake me.

515
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,590
I wanted to express it well.

516
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:09,840
I'm not qualified to love you.
But I'll take good care of you.

517
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,080
If you become wife.
How am I to tell you?

518
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,220
I'm getting married next month.

519
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,920
No jokes please

520
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,760
I'm telling you truth.

521
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:29,990
Invitations are also ready.
I was about to invite you.

522
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,260
Please don't make fun of me.

523
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:38,940
Just now my life seems getting better.
I shudder to think also.

524
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,780
You must love me.
- Don't talk like a mad man.

525
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,980
What do you know about me?

526
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,220
You've just seen one part me only.

527
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,360
All this you see is a mask,
I wore for my job.

528
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,960
But situation of my family
is totally different

529
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,990
Very strict

530
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:08,260
If my grandfather comes to
know this, he'll kill me

531
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,430
I can't accept love...

532
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,840
....why am I telling you all this?

533
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,370
Leave me alone.

534
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,080
The way you look.

535
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,750
No...no...you love me.
Don't hide it.

536
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,230
Leave my hand.

537
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,000
Leave my hand.

538
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:44,400


539
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,980
What sir?
How was your foreign trip?

540
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,830
Don't you want to eat?
- No.

541
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,870
Switch off the light.
- Why?

542
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,400
I said no, leave it

543
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,870
You should tell me before,
I've already cooked.

544
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,170
It will go waste.

545
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,050
Take it. Don't shout.

546
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:02,980
What happened son?

547
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:05,780
Ain't I asking you?

548
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,750
Won't you let me live in peace?
Why do you torture me?

549
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,860
Tell me...as if you've lost the world.

550
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,190
Yes...indeed I've lost my world.

551
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,330
For a girl...

552
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,700
I created a new world in my heart.

553
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:28,110
Carefully...beautifully...
a large one...It's gone.

554
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,040
A girl rejected your son's love.

555
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,580
She's getting married
what am I to do?

556
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,180
Do you want me to jump with joy?

557
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,620
It's love...
how can you understand?

558
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:46,200
It's gone...life is over.

559
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,300
Go...I'll be with you till death.

560
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,150
Keerthi! Greetings

561
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,990
I'm Ganesh's father

562
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,660
Tell me.
- I want to talk to you personally.

563
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,960
Why did you send your father to office?

564
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,230
I didn't send him.

565
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,670
He's here...he's talking
to Keerthi madam.

566
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,700
I mustn't praise my own son.

567
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:35,510
Though he may look mischievous,
he's very good man.

568
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:39,640
I never saw him chasing a girl.

569
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:43,780
First time he has fallen
in love with you only.

570
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:49,450
He's love for you is not ordinary,
he loves you very much.

571
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:50,720
Love!

572
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:54,190
How would I know all this?

573
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:59,370
He's sitting at home and crying

574
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,230
What's the use of me,
if I don't help my son?

575
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,010
I don't know what had
transpired between you both,

576
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:11,410
You both are modern youth.

577
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,920
If you've any idea
about him, tell me.

578
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:18,210
I'll talk to your parents.
- Don't you've any sense?

579
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:21,890
How can you talk like
this to a stranger?

580
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,390
Aren't you ashamed?

581
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,790
Your son did a mistake.

582
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:29,760
How could you support him at this age?

583
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,090
If you trouble me again,
I'll report to police.

584
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:41,100
Your son had earlier took me
into his arms in public...

585
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,910
Do you know what's the gossip
going around in my office?

586
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,190
You both know very well
my marriage is fixed.

587
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,120
Are you humans or...?

588
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,960
Your son fell short by
2 marks in the interview...

589
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,590
I felt pity and got him this job.

590
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,670
Is it the way both father & son
show the gratitude?

591
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,030
What's this?

592
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,110
He asked you out
of affection on me.

593
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,270
He's an elderly man.
Can't you explain him patiently?

594
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,080
Why are you shouting at him?

595
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:27,390
Should I watch mutely your
irresponsible behavior?

596
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:28,960
This foolish man...

597
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,790
I'll not take one more
harsh word against him.

598
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,900
I have been watching you,

599
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,320
wagging your tongue.

600
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,300
Tell me truthfully.

601
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,800
Don't you know that I'm
following you all these days?

602
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,040
Don't you know
how I was admiring you?

603
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:53,020
You can know a man seeing
even from a mile away.

604
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,390
Why this hypocrisy knowing everything?

605
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,920
If you don't like me,
say it openly.

606
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,220
Or say he's an American,
and I'm a status less local.

607
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:06,490
Why create a scene here?

608
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,260
Let the fight be within us.
Say sorry to him.

609
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,370
One more word and
I'll burn your face with acid.

610
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:18,670
...say sorry to him

611
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,510
What's this?
- Father!

612
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:22,740
I'll kill you.

613
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,280
Ganesh, don't get angry.

614
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,190
Listen to me...

615
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,120
All are watching us.
It's not good...come with me...come.

616
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,360
Keerthi, don't cry

617
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,060
Don't say cheers and
mar my respect.

618
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:59,580
It's been 20 years I had a drink.
I feel it's little strong.

619
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,510
May I add little soda?
- No.

620
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,830
Do you drink regularly?

621
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,020
No father, sometimes when I'm sad.

622
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,000
Don't get addicted.
It's not good for health.

623
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,280
Shall we go to the doctor?
Your face looks swollen.

624
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:35,850
Strong girl.
- Who told you to go there?

625
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,520
I would've become normal,

626
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,720
there are many other girls on road.
Isn't she the only girl?

627
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,290
Forget it.

628
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:51,800
No father, she slapped you.
I don't mind going to jail killing her.

629
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,970
Did she slap me? In that commotion
her hand hit my face.

630
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:03,300
You think from her side.
Yesterday son and today father

631
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,740
Who will not get angry if we
pester her to love you?

632
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,580
Why are you supporting her?

633
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,490
She's a good girl
I can judge by looking at her.

634
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,730
Won't you eat anything?
I brought biryani.

635
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:28,760
No. I had drink after many years.
I feel giddy...I'll go to sleep.

636
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,340
Father...father...be careful.

637
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:35,840
Leave me.
Have I grown old?

638
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:40,170
People are ready to give their daughters
in marriage to me even now.

639
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,010
Okay...come.
Do you've such ideas at this age?

640
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:55,520
Are you still feeling sad, son?

641
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:00,700
No father.
You had to face all this for me.

642
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:10,710
Yes dad

643
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,540
You got so furious on seeing
me getting slapped.

644
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:19,220
Do you love me so much?

645
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,820
Why are you asking me that?

646
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,560
Okay then, don't tell me.
Leave it.

647
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:28,150
Suddenly when you asked...
- I asked casually. Go to sleep.

648
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,560
Father...- Go

649
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:41,270


650
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,740
Why did you call us
early in the morning?

651
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,980
My father is dead.

652
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,410
I'm confused.

653
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,770
What man?
How did this happen?

654
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:15,440
I don't know...he breathed
last in his sleep...

655
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,940
He was fine last night,
by morning he's....

656
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,560
Why?
- For arrangements.

657
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,230
I have money. I'll take care.
- No.

658
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:39,800
Let me arrange my dad's
funeral with my earnings.

659
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,420
Father, what did you cook?

660
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,050
We are coming from LIC.

661
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,890
Your father had taken a policy
for Rs.10 lakhs on your name.

662
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:10,720
Please sign the documents.

663
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,390
I'm from State Bank, please collect
your mother's jewels from the locker.

664
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,730
Your father deposited his PF
Rs.5 lakhs in your account.

665
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,590
I killed you.

666
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,090
I killed you.

667
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,770
If I hadn't fallen in love
with that girl...

668
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,600
You would be living now, dad.

669
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:03,440
What happened to him?

670
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,120
Are you mad?

671
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,950
I killed my father.
I killed him.

672
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,390
His time came and he left the world.

673
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,390
How can you think of him
and stop living?

674
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,300
Did you have anything?

675
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,970
Please eat. Eat. Eat I say.

676
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:43,140
Eat...eat...eat...
Eat I say.

677
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,650
How long will you be like this?

678
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:48,490
Do you also want to die?

679
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,090
Give it to me.

680
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,320
Eat...eat...

681
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,670
Eat...

682
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,340
Eat...

683
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,670
I've to go to my native place urgently.

684
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,340
Some land problem.
Moreover my marriage.

685
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:17,010
How can I leave him alone here?
He may go completely mad.

686
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:19,780
I'll take him to my house.

687
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,460
Your house is too small,
it'll be difficult.

688
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,860
Will you come with me to
my native place?

689
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,200
Stay away from Hyderabad
for few days. Mine is a large family.

690
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,540
With paternal uncles,
we are about 30 people.

691
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,130
Change will be good for you.

692
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,610
Go with him. You'll get peace.

693
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,710
Take care of him.

694
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,540
I'll come as soon as I get leave.
- Okay.

695
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:49,710
What?

696
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:53,560
I don't see Keerthi, may be she
has boarded another coach.

697
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,890
Get in...be careful...
take good care of him.

698
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,440
Give me your hand...come in...

699
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,970
She's Keerthi.
....did I tell you about her?

700
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,810
My fiancee...
you wished to see her.

701
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,810
Let's go to the seats & discuss.

702
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,060
Keep the bag down.
It'll be comfortable for 3.- Okay.

703
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,070
Where are you going away?
- I want to go, leave me...

704
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:21,570
Are you mad to jump from a speeding train?
What happened now?

705
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:25,740
You're going home happily to marry,
I don't want to come with you.

706
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,580
Don't you want to attend my marriage?

707
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,310
Listen to me...
It'll create problems.

708
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,320
If you don't come with me now...
I swear. I'll never marry in life.

709
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:36,590
Shut up and come with me.

710
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,930
I want you to live peacefully
away from Hyderabad.

711
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,690
You're acting high...come.

712
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,660
What?
- Come here for a moment.

713
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,440
Wait...I'll come.
- Come, I say.

714
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:52,440
Come...one more word...
I'll not consider our friendship too.

715
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,110
Come...leave the bag...come.

716
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:01,270
Why is he here?
- Do you know him?

717
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,620
No...but...you know about our family

718
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,460
It'll create problem.

719
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:14,460
Why is everyone talking about problem?
I'll take care of it.

720
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,300
His father died suddenly.

721
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,360
He was the only close
relation he had.

722
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,300
He's devastated.
If I leave him, he'll go mad.

723
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,140
What happened?

724
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,650
When did his father die?
- 4 days ago.

725
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,990
Poor man died of heart attack.

726
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,720
You're the heaven in eyes...

727
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,050
You're the hell in heart...

728
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,490
You're the sweetness of world...

729
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:54,060
You're the poison in neck...

730
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:58,700
You're my sad story
of my love...my dear...

731
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:02,130
You're my lovely pain...

732
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:08,340
You're my lullaby of love,
my dear...

733
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:12,810
You're the lava in my heart...

734
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:24,650
You became flower and
spread fragrance...

735
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:29,560
You turned into a thorn and
pricked my heart...

736
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:34,490
You spread light in life
like a lightning...

737
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:39,230
You buried my dreams
striking like a thunder...

738
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:44,160
Is love a journey of tears?

739
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:48,540
Is trouble the destination of love?

740
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:58,050
Love warned me not to enter
its world of destruction...

741
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:02,780
But still foolishly I stepped
into it's realm...

742
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:07,490
And paid a heavy price for it.

743
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:17,800


744
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:10,420
You encouraged me...

745
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:15,160
Later you discouraged me...

746
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:19,960
When I sought refuge in you...

747
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:24,740
You smashed my world...

748
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:29,840
My body was hidden safely
like in a temple...

749
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:34,110
But Goddess' garland has
become a noose to me...

750
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:43,590
I lost faith in love...

751
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:48,390
I want to go to a world
devoid of love...

752
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,230
I must reach a place
you can never even dream of...

753
01:26:53,440 --> 01:27:03,400


754
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:39,610
You said a large family.
But I don't see anyone here.

755
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:44,610
My grandfather is of olden times.
He's God to this place.

756
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:49,180
We abide by his rule and live for
generations as a joint family.

757
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:52,360
Our grandpa decided our marriage
after college studies.

758
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:54,960
They fixed the date and
started making arrangements too.

759
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:57,430
We didn't want to marry so early.

760
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,530
We wished to reach top
in our respective jobs.

761
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,800
We tried hard to convince grandpa
but he didn't listen.

762
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:04,200
He said he'll think of it
after marriage.

763
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:07,600
So, we ran away from home
just days before marriage.

764
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,210
I rented a room and
she joined a hostel...

765
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,550
We took up jobs.
Everyone at house accepted us.

766
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:18,710
But grandpa stopped talking
to us since then.

767
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:24,060
He didn't worry much about me.
But he dotes her.

768
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,220
She lost her mother at birth.

769
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:30,390
So, grandpa and all others
took special care for her.

770
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,120
We came here last year too.

771
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,830
Grandpa didn't enter house
till we were here.

772
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,240
This marriage is too cool his temper.
I think this will cool him.

773
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,750
Why didn't you introduce her to me?

774
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:44,910
How many times should I ask her?

775
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:49,570
She decided not to meet
any of my friend.

776
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,750
She thinks she's very intelligent.

777
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:54,350
She gets angry if I go to meet her.

778
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,590
How can I take you with me?

779
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,760
Look! Who is coming?

780
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,430
Old man is coming.

781
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,100
I'll inform the villagers about it.

782
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,430
Grandpa!

783
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:12,370
Go...seek his blessings...
you too go.

784
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:15,610
Why are they seeking my blessings?

785
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,500
Tell them their foolish
grandpa is dead.

786
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:22,950
Why those harsh words?
Be happy for their achievements.

787
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:26,120
I don't need to learn how
to be happy from you.

788
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:26,950
Is it?

789
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,390
Who is he?

790
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:38,400
Grandpa! He's my friend.
Few days...

791
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:42,970
Few days?
- To stay here for few days...

792
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:47,800
You don't have a place here
and you've a guest with you.

793
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,540
Look at him.
He's like a beggar.

794
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:55,080
Tell him not to come before me.
- Okay.

795
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:00,650
He's too much.
- Please bear it for me.

796
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,330
She's bright like a bride, right?

797
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,160
May you live like a Goddess.
Move...drink boost.- No.

798
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,990
Move...move...I haven't yet
seen my niece.

799
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,000
How are you dad?
- You wait.

800
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:19,670
Kusumamba! I got this from
town especially for you. Take it.

801
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,340
By next year you must gift
us a baby, Kusumamba.

802
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:30,780
Kusumamba?
- My grandma's name.

803
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,180
That's her real name.

804
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:36,850
She changed it to Keerthi for city folks.
Come, let's go in

805
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,930
Haven't you seen a man till now?

806
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,540
What a family!

807
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,540
Oh God! You scoundrel, who are you?

808
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,210
Bloody donkey How dare!
- Why are you beating me?

809
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,870
What is your caste, religion?
Blood sucking vampire.

810
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:05,050
Hey! get turmeric water.
He has defiled the place.

811
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:11,560
I've to cleanse the place.
What am I to do? Get it fast.

812
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,230
Come inside.
- Leave me.

813
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:14,220
What happened now?

814
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:15,730
Did you call me here
to get beaten up?

815
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:17,400
You may be a great family,
but I'm leaving.

816
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,630
She's my grandma.
She's little unbalanced.

817
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:22,570
Adjust please.

818
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:25,570
Mad? Old lady broke my back.

819
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:26,970
My sister-in-law

820
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:28,970
Enough Prasunamba

821
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,170
My name is Pooja

822
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:36,520
That is...I got it.

823
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:40,920
Is the entire family mad?

824
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:45,320
Oh! What's this?
- What?

825
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,260
What's this outfit?

826
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,760
Shouldn't I take bath?
- So what?

827
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:57,100
You must take bath here like this only.
No bathrooms here. Undress and tie this

828
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,440
This looks very small size.

829
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:06,770
No need, I'll take bath tomorrow morning.

830
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:09,780
You mustn't enter house
without bath, grandma will shout.

831
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:13,790
Hey short fat boy! One rag on head
and you'll get 2 inches shorter.

832
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,960
I'm not used to loincloth.
- Than take bath without it.

833
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,790
Bloody

834
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,620
How dare you beat me?

835
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,790
If you say something now,
I'll strangle your neck.

836
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,130
I won't take bath. Go to hell.

837
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:29,470
He's hardly above the ground
but shouting at me.

838
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,050
Father-in-law, please bless the children.

839
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:52,420


840
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:57,830
It's me sir. Don't beat me.
- What's now?

841
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:02,160
Get up sir. Nobody must sleep here
after the rooster crows.

842
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,330
Get out.
- Please come out sir.

843
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,010
If old man comes to know,
he'll create a scene.

844
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:16,680
What's all this?

845
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:37,370
Thank God! Coffee has come.

846
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:48,310
What's this?

847
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,380
Neem leaf extract.
- What leaf?

848
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:53,560
Grandpa's rule to have it every morning

849
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,120
Only then your pot will be clean.

850
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,220
Why are you kicking?
- What's everyone doing?

851
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:06,060
10 minutes walk for free motions.
Grandpa's rule.

852
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,570
Walking? Here!

853
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,580
What's this?

854
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,580
He's a pain.

855
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,600
What's going on?

856
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,270
It's farts all over.

857
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,850
Where is everyone going?

858
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,120
Don't you want to go to toilet?
- For that?

859
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:59,180
Everything is open air here.
Grandpa's rule.

860
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,460
How many bathrooms can we
build for this large family?

861
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,450
Don't ask silly questions. Come.

862
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,460
What a family! It's a hell.

863
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,630
How can any man go to toilet
in this chill weather?

864
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,070
We'll not know even if any snake passes.

865
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:27,810
What?

866
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,810
I'm finished.
Where's water?

867
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,990
What?
Shouldn't I clear my doubt?

868
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:41,150
Clean with leaves.
We can wash in the pond later.

869
01:35:42,130 --> 01:35:43,220
What leaves?

870
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:50,300
Where am I to find
leaves in darkness?

871
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:07,550
Why is he still sitting pants down?

872
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,320
May be new to the place.

873
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,680
Bloody rogues!
Where have you all gone?

874
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:13,790
Shameless creature.
- Did you see?

875
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:22,530
Bloody! You're killing me.
What a nasty family.

876
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:39,980


877
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:45,720
I want to talk to you.

878
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:53,160
Please don't see me like a criminal.
I feel like killing myself.

879
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,570
I know your pain.
Your father died because of me...

880
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:06,070
I don't even have the right
to seek your forgiveness.

881
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,910
A good man died because of me.

882
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:13,750
Please don't cry.
Someone may watch us.

883
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:16,090
Why should we forgive you?

884
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:20,420
It was our mistake without
knowing about you well....

885
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:28,260
I came to know after coming here,
an entire family dotes on you.

886
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,260
How can you fall in love?
I've understood it.

887
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:38,110
Don't feel guilty for my father's death,
you're not responsible.

888
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,770
Massive cardiac arrest.
Nobody can help it.

889
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,020
He had two more
attacks prior to this.

890
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:52,120
Early morning...in his sleep...
a peaceful death...

891
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,620
How many are lucky to have
such peaceful death?

892
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,960
He'll be happily singing duets
with my mother in heaven.

893
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,460
If you feel embarrassed for
my presence, tell me I'll go away.

894
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:08,640
No...no problem.
Your presence is not a problem to me

895
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:11,810
What's it dear?

896
01:38:12,850 --> 01:38:18,810
Aunty, that is...Ganesh's....
- Aunty! She's inquiring about Vasu.

897
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:24,990
Are you seeing Vasu now?
Silly girl.

898
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:27,490
Tie him to your apron strings
after the marriage.

899
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,660
I'm seeing her smile first time now.

900
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:38,270
She loves this dish.
Have it dear. Have it.-Yes...?

901
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:41,740
What do you want?
- Vasu..?

902
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,350
He went to the fields with others.
Didn't you go with him?

903
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:48,850
I dozed off after bath.

904
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,020
Ask Mangaiah! He'll take you there.
- Okay.

905
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:55,520
Eat...please eat...- Enough.
- Please have it dear.

906
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:00,680
Madam, I feel embarrassed to ask
I feel very hungry...

907
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,690
Is there anything to eat?

908
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:11,570
Why are you feeling shy to ask?
This is also your house.

909
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:14,840
Why are you still watching fun?
Give me the plate.

910
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,500
You put the frying pan on stove.
Come...have it hot.

911
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:21,510
Grandma...

912
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,340
Old woman is like that only.
You come in.

913
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:26,020
Why are you watching
without blinking?

914
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:30,020
Won't you take care of guests?
Go and get a plate. You come.

915
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:34,190
Enough...enough...I can't...

916
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,260
Don't talk. Eat.

917
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:37,970
No...I can't eat so much.

918
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,390
Can you leave this place
without finishing it?

919
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,590
Yes, have it Ganesh.
Why are you feeling shy?

920
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:46,910
Have it son.

921
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:52,880
Few more?

922
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,610
What are your parents
doing back home?

923
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:05,860
I don't have anyone.

924
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:08,020
They are dead.

925
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,460
Have it son.

926
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:17,300
Don't ever say like that.
Aren't we here for you?

927
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:22,100
You're also like Vasu to us.
You must come here every summer vacation.

928
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,410
Got it! It's my order.

929
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:39,690
You...? Why are you coming out
of the kitchen?

930
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,430
I warned you not to come here many times.
- Wait...wait...- Dirty fellow!

931
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:44,460
I will...

932
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:48,030
How much did you
eat to blurb so heavily?

933
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:52,170
Oh God!

934
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:53,860
Let's harvest that 2 acres tomorrow.

935
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:56,210
Such pure air...

936
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:58,480
Such beautiful natural surroundings...

937
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,740
The fragrance of earth...

938
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:04,140
How do people have a heart
to leave all this?

939
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,580
Still you can't beat the city life.

940
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:20,030
Even kids are working.
Aren't you ashamed to watch? Go and work.

941
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:35,540
Wearing dark glasses like a blind man

942
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:39,650
Cut it like this.

943
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,420
Is your grandpa educated?

944
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:45,020
He did BA.

945
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:49,200
No use of it.
Workers must do this.

946
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:52,660
I think your grandpa is a miser.

947
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:53,660
What's the discussion going on here?

948
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:58,710
Nothing.- He said it seems
we mustn't do all this work.

949
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:01,140
It must be done by workers
and that you're a country brute.

950
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,210
Not only that he said
you're a miser and a fool.

951
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:09,140
It seems you're a psycho.
It seems you're torturing all of us.

952
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:12,080
He said you've grown old
but not wise.

953
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:14,590
Yes, I heard him say all this.
- Yes, grandpa.

954
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:19,590
My fate! My father too never
hit me so severely

955
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,460
Rogues! Is it a family?

956
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,160
Bloody family.

957
01:42:24,570 --> 01:42:27,430
My bad time, I'm here. Bloody people.

958
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,590
A snake guard here?

959
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:36,540
I'll show them what I am.

960
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:42,980
You must fear me.

961
01:42:43,590 --> 01:42:44,710
Am I any joke to you?

962
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:47,220
Every one ran in scare.

963
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:52,890
Why is the guard hissing?

964
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,530
Will it hiss?

965
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,950
He's damn scared.

966
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:19,780
Please don't get scared...

967
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:22,720
What happened?

968
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:25,420
He got scared seeing a snake.

969
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,730
He got scared seeing a snake.

970
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:29,590
Our kids here play with it.

971
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,930
Girls! Serve here.

972
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:16,540
May god bless you.

973
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:20,540
Let it get cooked well or
else it'll smell raw.- Okay sir.

974
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,580
Are you fine sir?

975
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:28,050
I'm coming straight here after
chopping off your lawyer's hand.

976
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,260
How dare you send me a notice?

977
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:35,360
I'll wipe out your entire family.
- Shut up you buffalo!

978
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,260
It's our ancestral property.

979
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:42,090
You took it on lease,
do you want to usurp it?

980
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:47,240
Get out or else I'll call police.
- Police? Me?

981
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:48,840
Madam greetings

982
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:50,850
Junior madam...greetings.

983
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:53,910
Look like your grand daughter
has come from city.

984
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,980
Sign these papers, I'll go away.
If not....?

985
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:01,360
What'll you do if I refuse?

986
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:04,120
I'll put my hand in full public glare.

987
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:08,660
...not on you.
...on your women folk.

988
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:10,460
You won't be like patient.

989
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,500
I think you know
where I'll touch them.

990
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,540
What nonsense are you blabbering?
You're going overboard.

991
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:17,530
Stop.

992
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:19,660
You'll not listen to words.

993
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:23,400
Kill anyone who dares to come near me.

994
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:24,940
Catch him.

995
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:34,210
Come mother.

996
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:41,250
Who are you to support them?

997
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,230
Hey old man! Are you running a
brothel house with your women?

998
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,470
Keep it safely, watch was
presented by my father.

999
01:45:51,570 --> 01:46:01,540


1000
01:46:56,170 --> 01:46:57,660
Go! ...Hit him.

1001
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:24,160
Sorry sir. I'm scared of snakes
but not to pigs like him.

1002
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:28,030
He's a well-respected elderly man.

1003
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,530
Can you misbehave with him?

1004
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:32,170
Repent for it.
Come on.

1005
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,870
Say, God! Forgive me.
Say it.

1006
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,410
God, forgive me.

1007
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:43,580
I think he hasn't forgiven you.

1008
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:48,050
Say you've forgiven me sir.
- Go...go man.

1009
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,420
Forgive me.

1010
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,690
Okay...okay

1011
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:04,030
Move...move...
His hand is bleeding.

1012
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,200
Look, I too didn't observe it.
Give me.

1013
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:10,580
I'll do it.- Can you do it clearly?
Give it to me.

1014
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:13,180
No need of it. Nothing much.

1015
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,250
Can't you see it's bleeding? Shut up.

1016
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:16,810
Do something, mother?

1017
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:20,750
Keerthi, hold his hand,
come on do it I say.

1018
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:30,230
He has hurt himself here too.

1019
01:48:30,430 --> 01:48:32,900
No...no....- No?

1020
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,250
What should I do
to get muscles like you?

1021
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:57,380
You must grow first.

1022
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:00,890
Bloody.

1023
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:03,530
What are you doing here?

1024
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:06,630
What are you doing here?

1025
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:09,560
Bossing over me? Get out.
You're wanted downstairs.

1026
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:12,840
This isn't good.

1027
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,870
Welcome Prasunamba

1028
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:23,740
Oh Pooja! What's it?

1029
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:33,860
I'm open type & ultra modern.
- Okay.

1030
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:37,230
I can't hide my feelings.

1031
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:38,490
Okay.

1032
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:47,000
I started liking you
the moment I saw you.

1033
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,840
Later on when you
said you've no one,

1034
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:54,350
I liked your simple innocent heart.

1035
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:58,850
I liked your innocence when you
got scared seeing a snake.

1036
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:03,390
Above all this you fought
for this family's honor.

1037
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:05,750
I liked your courage very much.

1038
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:18,600
I'll say it myself.

1039
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,700
I've decided you're
perfect match to me

1040
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,970
Since my family too likes
you very much

1041
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:35,480


1042
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:38,350
What is it?

1043
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:40,360
Sister!

1044
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,060
What happened?

1045
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:50,900
Sister you must help me.

1046
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:53,440
Who else can I share it with?

1047
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,140
Tell me, what is it?

1048
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:00,910
Sister...

1049
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:12,060
Yes sister. The man who has
come here as guest

1050
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,960
Symptoms are pointing that only.

1051
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:19,560
You must convince grandpa
and get us married.

1052
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:23,200
No urgency.
2 or 3 months after your marriage...

1053
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:25,970
What are you blabbering?

1054
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:31,040
It's wrong.
- What's wrong in it?

1055
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:32,470
I don't know.

1056
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:34,920
You mustn't love him.
- Why?

1057
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:36,840
No means no...I don't like it.

1058
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:39,020
Why should you like him?
I like him.

1059
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:43,490
Aren't you my sweet sister?

1060
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,990
You're helping me
I am marrying him.

1061
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:54,760
O Love! Shall I tell you
my lover's address?

1062
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:16,550
She's a little girl.
- I know.

1063
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:22,790
Some attraction.
She will understand..

1064
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:28,140
Mention not.

1065
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:45,150
Call me for lunch.

1066
01:52:52,830 --> 01:53:04,430
Lord Narayana's feet in my refuge...

1067
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:14,610
Grandpa! Won't you talk to me?

1068
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:17,810
Go away donkey!
You left me.

1069
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:22,680
Please grandpa.
I'll never leave you.

1070
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:26,630
I promise on you.
Really grandpa.

1071
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:30,660
Who'll sing next?
- Janaki aunty.

1072
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:33,800
No, my voice isn't good today.

1073
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,430
Ask Vasu to sing.
- Me? I can't sing.

1074
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:40,370
No, listen to me.
I can't sing.

1075
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:44,750
All are asking you, come on sing.

1076
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,610
Yes, come sing.
Your wife's request.

1077
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:51,620
Oh Brother-in-law is feeling shy.

1078
01:53:53,290 --> 01:53:57,490
Dear...please sing...come on.
- Shut up.

1079
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:00,750
If you ask me to sing,
what am I to sing?

1080
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,720
Sing something.

1081
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:05,230
Think about your wife and sing

1082
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:08,890
I can't.

1083
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:12,500
He...he'll sing.

1084
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:17,540
Wait...wait...why are you fixing me?
I'm going.

1085
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:20,340
No.
Don't embarrass me.

1086
01:54:20,850 --> 01:54:22,040
Nobody can dare hear my song.

1087
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:24,840
Please for my sake say okay.

1088
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:30,420
My friend will sing
now instead of me.

1089
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:31,720
About Keerthi!

1090
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:44,500
Look how beautiful she is!

1091
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,470
Sing about her.

1092
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,240
Sing.

1093
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:19,760


1094
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:28,040
Jas the star of sky descended
on earth like you?

1095
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:35,220
Like a rare gem...
like Goddess in a temple...

1096
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:39,790
Presiding over heart...

1097
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:49,290
Earth hasn't seen anyone
till now like her...

1098
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:53,790
Won't the man who marries this
wealth of beauty be Lord Sri Hari...

1099
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:02,380
Can anyone else think and
achieve the Goddess's shadow too?

1100
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:10,750
A garden grown with
so many people's affection...

1101
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:14,980
Won't it become a celestial
garden of flowers?

1102
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:18,820
Making the beauty
more beautiful...

1103
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:22,990
Is she a gift from the heaven?

1104
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:33,230


1105
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:50,760
What man?
Children, Look!

1106
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:54,190
She's scared.

1107
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:02,320
This young woman
with her beauty...

1108
01:59:02,630 --> 01:59:06,900
She pulled everyone towards her...

1109
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:10,760
This river with so many
bends & curves...

1110
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:15,410
Don't know which heart
it has drowned in it...

1111
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:19,600
First meeting as
a sweet dream...

1112
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:23,580
It's a cherished
memory of heart...

1113
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:27,720
Won't every memory bless her...

1114
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:34,050
Spreading light
in my lover's life...

1115
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:44,230


1116
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:23,400


1117
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:26,640
She was fine.

1118
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:29,010
She never got up
even late morning also.

1119
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:33,450
She wanted to see Keerthi's marriage.

1120
02:00:38,290 --> 02:00:40,730
Sir, please do something.

1121
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,420
I can't do anything.

1122
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:44,400
She has grown old

1123
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:46,090
I don't know
what's in her mind.

1124
02:00:46,530 --> 02:00:47,830
She's struggling to breath her last.

1125
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,330
They are trying everything.
But she's not giving up.

1126
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:55,700
She loves pudding.
Please try feeding it.

1127
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:04,250
Take your hand.

1128
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:09,880
Stop...stop your cries.
All of you clear out.

1129
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:11,480
She's still alive.

1130
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:13,180
Why are you mourning?

1131
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,690
Doctor, ask all of them to go out.
Let her get some fresh air.

1132
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:18,400
Please go out.

1133
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:21,360
You can cry later. Go out.

1134
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:52,590
Grandma! I've entered your room.

1135
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,330
Wont' you beat me?

1136
02:01:56,770 --> 02:01:57,970
Don't you feel like laughing at me?

1137
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:00,810
Nobody cared when you were alive.

1138
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:04,000
But how they are asking you
what you want.

1139
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:07,340
What to do grandma?

1140
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,450
I was also like them only.

1141
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:17,450
I came to the value of my father
after his death.

1142
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:21,220
I don't know about others.

1143
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:25,690
But I like you very much.

1144
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:28,300
True.

1145
02:02:31,710 --> 02:02:34,140
Whenever you chased me
with a stick to beat...

1146
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:40,340
....it made me
remember my father.

1147
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:44,940
I'll come here every vacation.

1148
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:49,720
But I'll get bored
if you're not here.

1149
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:53,420
Think over it

1150
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,890
I'll leave it on you.

1151
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:07,710
Grandma opened her eyes.

1152
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:16,540
Grandma look at me.
I am Vasu.

1153
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:18,670
Look, mother is here.

1154
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:24,850
All have come?
You'll be fine., grandma.

1155
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:52,750
Sir, may I read it?

1156
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,990
Have all members of our family come here?

1157
02:03:58,630 --> 02:03:59,650
All are here.

1158
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:01,420
All are here, father-in-law.

1159
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:07,060
Ganesh! They are calling you.

1160
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:07,990
Can't you hear it?

1161
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:12,530
Come. They are going to read
the marriage invitation.

1162
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:13,640
Come...come.

1163
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:51,870
We are going to buy saris,
will you come with us?

1164
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:54,510
A thorn has entered my leg.
It's paining.

1165
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:57,980
Please give me way.

1166
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:03,550
Mangaiah, get my bike keys.
I've to send a fax to my office.

1167
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:05,220
It's getting late.

1168
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:09,090
Will anyone please accompany us?
We all are women.

1169
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,060
What happened?

1170
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:13,230
We are going to shop for saris,
would you like to join us?

1171
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:14,560
Yes, I'll come.

1172
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,160
What man?

1173
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:20,130
What? You go.

1174
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:22,530
You come with us.
You're my good son.

1175
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,140
No...no...he's finished.

1176
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:27,340
Get it son.

1177
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:30,580
You too get in.

1178
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:36,450
Aunty, we'll also come.
- Okay, get in.

1179
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:47,270
Woman's words have different meaning...
Not very long...

1180
02:05:47,770 --> 02:06:02,810
Women's laugh has
different meaning...

1181
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:08,250
Women's looks have
different meaning...

1182
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:13,390
Women's silence has
different meaning...

1183
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:23,760


1184
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:47,320
What nasty push!

1185
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:48,500
Have your women come
to shop for saris?

1186
02:06:49,130 --> 02:06:49,990
Wait in that room

1187
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:57,130
Have you come to shop
with women?

1188
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:59,270
Sit here, it'll take a time.

1189
02:06:59,470 --> 02:07:00,700
They too don't know when they will come.

1190
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:02,840
I'm here for last 2 days.

1191
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:14,010
I'm coming.

1192
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:16,180
Where did you go away?

1193
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:18,090
Won't this color look gorgeous on Keerthi?

1194
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,890
This one, no way.
Green silk sari.

1195
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:26,060
With a matching blouse,
with hair let down,

1196
02:07:26,630 --> 02:07:29,330
When she comes walking,
she'll be like one angel.

1197
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:38,410
Look.

1198
02:07:58,730 --> 02:08:02,860
Keerthi, you too selected the same
green sari Ganesh selected.

1199
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:05,610
That red border sari.

1200
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:11,510
Urinating here?

1201
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:21,410
Where?

1202
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:23,690
Ganesh, take her to bathroom.

1203
02:08:25,630 --> 02:08:28,360
Finished darling?
- Not yet.

1204
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:31,720
Wash it.
- That too.

1205
02:09:27,190 --> 02:09:37,150


1206
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:40,020
Aunty sent this milk for you.

1207
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:48,570
Nothing like as you're imagining.
Just old memories.

1208
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:53,980
Do me one favour.
Never again come before me.

1209
02:09:54,380 --> 02:09:55,210
It's good for both of us.

1210
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:57,210
What have I done?

1211
02:09:58,050 --> 02:09:58,850
You were seeing my photo.

1212
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:07,820
Do you still love me?

1213
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,520
What is this?

1214
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:13,790
What if anyone sees it?

1215
02:10:14,570 --> 02:10:15,300
Shall I go away from here?

1216
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:20,130
True, if I stay here,
you'll think of the past.

1217
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:21,740
No need of unnecessary trouble.

1218
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:23,130
I'll go away.

1219
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:29,210
Go away...

1220
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,380
Why so early morning?
- Don't say another word.

1221
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:39,960
I've to join office. It's urgent.
I may lose my job.

1222
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:42,290
Children may cry if they know,
tell them later. Bye.

1223
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,160
Get ready hot water.
I'm having body pain.

1224
02:10:55,210 --> 02:10:57,800
He has seen you.
Tell him & go.

1225
02:11:03,250 --> 02:11:05,780
Urgent work is pending
in office, I've to go.

1226
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:11,520
Thanks for taking good care of me

1227
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,320
One minute

1228
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:22,230
Did anyone insult you?
- No sir.

1229
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:25,970
Then, can't you stay till
Keerthi's marriage?

1230
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:27,130
Sorry sir

1231
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:28,560
Forgive me.

1232
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:31,440
If I stay back
It'll create problem.

1233
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:43,580
Bye grandma.
Take care of your health.

1234
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:58,760
Please uncle, don't go...
- Who will play with us then?

1235
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:00,960
You said there's cricket
tournament tomorrow.

1236
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:04,940
Please, uncle, don't go.

1237
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:15,720
He's going away without telling me.
- Did you wake up everyone?

1238
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,690
How can you do like this?

1239
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:22,290
If you're any grouse you should
come to me. This isn't fair.

1240
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,260
No, office work...
Let office go to hell.

1241
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:27,990
Forget it. You come in first.
- Come...come...

1242
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:31,470
This house was dull earlier,

1243
02:12:31,810 --> 02:12:33,970
now it has come alive with your arrival.

1244
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:36,230
Children, don't let him go, bring him in.

1245
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:24,620
Shut up. It's out.

1246
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:28,650
I'm umpire. My word is final.
- Uncle, what am I to play?

1247
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:30,260
What will you play dear?

1248
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:35,330
Uncle, he's bowling very fast.
- Don't bowl fast to him. Bowl slowly...

1249
02:13:50,350 --> 02:13:51,480
Ask him.

1250
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:54,320
She wants to check e-mail,
can you take her to the town?

1251
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:57,890
I'm taking care of children.
- You take her, I'll look after children.

1252
02:13:58,130 --> 02:13:59,680
Come Ganesh.

1253
02:13:59,890 --> 02:14:01,220
Check your mails yourself,
why should I come?

1254
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:02,990
Children, you continue play.

1255
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:04,130
Let's go.

1256
02:14:09,370 --> 02:14:10,100
Where are you both going?

1257
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,060
To town to check mail.

1258
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:15,900
Why are you taking him?

1259
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:17,640
How can I go alone?

1260
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:21,580
I told father.
You come, Ganesh.

1261
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:24,420
Come...

1262
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:27,440
Stop...stop

1263
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:30,920
I'm also coming.

1264
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:32,520
Why?

1265
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:34,720
I must also check my mail.

1266
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:36,650
Go another time.

1267
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:40,830
Please sister.
- Shut up.

1268
02:14:42,670 --> 02:14:44,730
You get down. I'll drive. Go.

1269
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,720
What?

1270
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:14,100
You stand outside.

1271
02:15:14,530 --> 02:15:15,900
I've to talk personally with Ganesh.

1272
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:18,100
What will you talk?

1273
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:20,360
Go, I say.

1274
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:24,870
About my matter?

1275
02:15:27,150 --> 02:15:31,050
Yes...yes...you go out.
- My great sister.

1276
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,490
Come on.
- Go little away.

1277
02:15:47,770 --> 02:15:48,290
Still further

1278
02:15:54,610 --> 02:15:55,730
Matter has become serious.

1279
02:15:59,410 --> 02:16:02,140
Yes, I'm facing new problems.

1280
02:16:03,220 --> 02:16:05,340
You talk to her and
put an end to it.

1281
02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:08,020
Poor child! She'll cry.

1282
02:16:09,590 --> 02:16:11,780
Leave her, she'll come
over it in few days.

1283
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:14,320
You don't know about Pooja.

1284
02:16:14,730 --> 02:16:16,960
She's very determined to achieve
what she desires.

1285
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:19,030
If my people come to know it,
it'll lead to problem.

1286
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:20,990
You finish it today itself.

1287
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:26,530
Okay, as you wish.

1288
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:53,030
Pooja...stop.

1289
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:27,100
Oh! Doctor...Pooja,
Take her to hospital.

1290
02:17:28,130 --> 02:17:31,870
No...no...Pooja is dead.
I killed her.

1291
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:35,670
Earlier I killed your father,
now my sister.

1292
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,170
I'm a great sinner.

1293
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:40,910
Shut up

1294
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:44,880
My sister..
- Shut up and sit silently.

1295
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:54,380
Silence please.
Shut up.

1296
02:18:01,970 --> 02:18:04,460
Give me your hands.
Give.

1297
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:17,680
Shut up.
If you shout again I'll kill you.

1298
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:19,380
Press...come on

1299
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:27,390
Why are you beating her?

1300
02:18:34,730 --> 02:18:38,230
Why did you do like this?
- Keep quiet.

1301
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:53,080
Will you love me now?

1302
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:01,060
What's your age?

1303
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:06,830
What's my age?
Are you mad?

1304
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,640
This is not love, it's attraction.

1305
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:12,930
Got me?

1306
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:19,000
Keerthi! Is she beautiful?

1307
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:21,350
Is she beautiful? Tell me.

1308
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:25,780
Is she beautiful than you?

1309
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:33,350
Go and see yourself in mirror.

1310
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:37,290
Good figure.

1311
02:19:38,030 --> 02:19:40,330
In 5 years, youth of this
place will go mad on you.

1312
02:19:41,370 --> 02:19:42,390
You'll get 10 love letters everyday.

1313
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:46,070
Not only me, even Shahrukh or
Salman Khan will fall for you.

1314
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:48,470
Would you like to die
without seeing all this?

1315
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:51,370
Die...come I'll push you.

1316
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:57,240
What?

1317
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:00,720
Will I get surely a man like you?

1318
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:04,750
Better than me.
- Answer my question.

1319
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,120
Will he keep me happy like you do?

1320
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:10,320
Will he be a good man like you?

1321
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:13,690
Yes. You'll forget me by then.

1322
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:19,070
Then okay. Come let's go.

1323
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:26,570
Sit in the front seat.

1324
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:44,790
Is she really beautiful than me?

1325
02:21:18,630 --> 02:21:20,720
We all came to the same
marriage in the same town.

1326
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:23,560
We are bride's guests.

1327
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:27,810
We all work for software solution.
- That office? My friend works there.

1328
02:21:28,110 --> 02:21:29,600
Ji buddy!
- Then, we all are...

1329
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:34,370
What?

1330
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,910
You are...?
- Are you all Keerthi's colleagues?

1331
02:21:40,590 --> 02:21:43,150
He's Keerthi's fianc.

1332
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:49,160
He's marrying Keerthi. It's him.
Isn't he smart?

1333
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:51,750
Say hi to him.

1334
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:55,330
Why are you surprised?
She's Keerthi.

1335
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:57,160
Vasu's bride

1336
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:01,770
You might be tired. Take rest.

1337
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:05,840
Guest house is in the next street.
Mangaiah, take them.

1338
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:09,080
Come madam.

1339
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:13,250
Why are you going with them?

1340
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:19,190
I'll spend sometime happily with them.
You'll be busy here.

1341
02:22:20,190 --> 02:22:20,680
Tell him.

1342
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:26,100
I'll come at night. Let's play cards.
- Okay.

1343
02:22:26,930 --> 02:22:27,960
Your clothes are in the room

1344
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:34,400
I'll pick it up later. You don't worry.

1345
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:35,910
Come buddy.

1346
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:39,800
Forgive me...
Turn away the rain...

1347
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:43,970
Will you remain like a statue?

1348
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:47,910
Silence is broken...
Where are you?

1349
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:52,420
Would you remain unmarried?

1350
02:22:53,230 --> 02:22:55,690
Keerthi, sleep early

1351
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:58,830
Marriage rituals start by 4 AM.

1352
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:00,660
By this time tomorrow
you'll be married.

1353
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:17,010
If they say love is sin...
Can't you deny it?

1354
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:27,450


1355
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,130
What?

1356
02:24:14,070 --> 02:24:17,170
Why did you come here now?
I was just...

1357
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:23,180
My family is everything to me.

1358
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:28,290
But I came here without
thinking about anything.

1359
02:24:30,290 --> 02:24:32,720
I don't know why.

1360
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:39,730
I feel like I'm dying if I don't
see you for few minutes.

1361
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:43,590
Is it love?

1362
02:24:45,770 --> 02:24:47,170
I didn't know till now.

1363
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:52,640
Why didn't I get this feeling
when you followed me?

1364
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:58,310
Or did I hide the
feelings in fear?

1365
02:24:59,690 --> 02:25:01,120
I am confused.

1366
02:25:02,390 --> 02:25:05,850
Tomorrow I'm getting married.
Why am I here now?

1367
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:11,630
Have I gone mad?
Tell me please.

1368
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:14,390
Please...

1369
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:19,930
Nothing's wrong in it.

1370
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:22,400
It happens in everyone's life.

1371
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,270
For you it came very late.

1372
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:30,510
You were brought up in
an orthodox family.

1373
02:25:34,890 --> 02:25:35,790
What should I do now?

1374
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:40,350
Will you come & seek my hand
from my family?

1375
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:50,700
You are a bride now.

1376
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:54,370
People will misunderstand
if you're seen here.

1377
02:25:55,310 --> 02:25:57,440
Come, I'll drop you at home.

1378
02:26:03,220 --> 02:26:03,680
Why?

1379
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:09,080
Are you still thinking about
your father's death?

1380
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:11,950
No...nothing like that.

1381
02:26:13,390 --> 02:26:13,860
Then?

1382
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:21,030
I didn't care when you came after me.

1383
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:24,040
Now you're taking revenge
keeping it in mind, right?

1384
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:30,570
You want men to beg like
you did, right? Tell me.

1385
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:44,190
Do you know how much I wished
that you'll turn to see me?

1386
02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:47,480
Why are you hesitating now?

1387
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,520
Can't you talk to my people?

1388
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:53,130
What am I to tell them?

1389
02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:57,190
You want me to see a
family getting destroyed.

1390
02:26:58,300 --> 02:27:01,640
The moment your grandpa said
I was a member of the family.

1391
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:05,140
I decided that moment itself,
this family is mine.

1392
02:27:06,050 --> 02:27:06,810
Think over it again.

1393
02:27:08,350 --> 02:27:09,210
I was an orphan...

1394
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:15,350
Now I've grand parents, uncles,
aunt, brothers, a full family.

1395
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,460
Children are very fond of me.

1396
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:25,820
If I ask your hand in marriage,
can they survive the shock?

1397
02:27:26,970 --> 02:27:28,960
They'll spit on me for cheating them.

1398
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:31,860
Above all my friend Vasu...

1399
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:35,830
He brought me here
to keep me happy.

1400
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:38,670
Do you want me to
spoil his happiness?

1401
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:43,310
I don't mind losing you.

1402
02:27:44,650 --> 02:27:46,020
But I can't lose a family & friend.

1403
02:27:54,530 --> 02:27:57,220
Is this your decision?

1404
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:05,640
What can I say now!

1405
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:13,100
It's my bad luck to
miss a man like you.

1406
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:20,810
You'll also marry
someone, won't you?

1407
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:25,220
No, this is enough.

1408
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:31,590
Marriage will settle all issues.

1409
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:33,960
You'll be happy.

1410
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:46,010
Keep smiling.
It's good for health.

1411
02:28:46,150 --> 02:28:56,110


1412
02:29:05,830 --> 02:29:06,300
Grandpa.

1413
02:29:08,470 --> 02:29:09,530
Don't come near me.

1414
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:12,760
Your breath also
shouldn't reach me.

1415
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:16,640
All I want to know
is one thing only.

1416
02:29:18,310 --> 02:29:21,640
Were you spoiled
mentally or else...

1417
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:25,780
Do you know how people
see women of this family?

1418
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:27,650
Like Goddesses!

1419
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:32,690
You were seen compromising
with a man at midnight...

1420
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:34,020
Don't you've any shame?

1421
02:29:35,330 --> 02:29:37,590
How were you born in this family?

1422
02:29:39,670 --> 02:29:40,130
Come.

1423
02:29:46,470 --> 02:29:47,000
Where is Vasu?

1424
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:57,510


1425
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:03,580
Go...go away.

1426
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:07,720
You're a good man.

1427
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:10,220
This family is eternal
indebted to you.

1428
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:13,530
But we can't give our daughter
in marriage to you.

1429
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:15,800
Please go away from here.

1430
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:18,960
These are old man's words.

1431
02:30:19,570 --> 02:30:29,540


1432
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:02,770
How dare to enter this house again?
Get out.- Uncle!

1433
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:13,520
Get out. Disloyal dog.

1434
02:31:15,490 --> 02:31:17,020
Keerthi isn't such a girl.

1435
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:19,030
What did you do to her?

1436
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:22,530
What game did you play to change her?

1437
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,030
So cheaply.

1438
02:31:28,270 --> 02:31:28,740
Get out.

1439
02:31:30,140 --> 02:31:32,240
Never again show your face to me.

1440
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:57,890
I was just feeling happy
about getting a family.

1441
02:32:00,670 --> 02:32:01,370
But it vanished so quickly.

1442
02:32:06,750 --> 02:32:08,580
The moment you beat me...

1443
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:16,480
I just came to say bye to Vasu.

1444
02:32:22,530 --> 02:32:23,620
You blamed me a lot.

1445
02:32:25,130 --> 02:32:29,260
After this you'll not
believe anything I say.

1446
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:34,730
But I can say confidently one thing.

1447
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:38,510
The strong belief you've that
your mother is chaste woman,

1448
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,750
Keerthi is also as chaste as she is.

1449
02:32:41,910 --> 02:32:43,540
If liking a man is sin,

1450
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:47,150
then, every girl is a
sinner in this world.

1451
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:52,760
Even if I insist on eloping,
she'll not come.

1452
02:32:53,730 --> 02:32:55,090
She loves your family so much.

1453
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:57,520
Feel proud of it.

1454
02:32:59,030 --> 02:32:59,790
Why all this?

1455
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:10,370


1456
02:33:13,250 --> 02:33:16,680
Grandma, take care of health.

1457
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:25,390
Sky will not retain a
drop of rain for itself...

1458
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:29,790
It happily gives it to earth...

1459
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:37,360
Will sea's thirst subside after
drinking up all the rivers?

1460
02:33:37,570 --> 02:33:41,270
Don't lock friendship in a cage?

1461
02:33:41,470 --> 02:33:45,380
Sending a palanquin, bless happily...

1462
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:49,240
Won't your memories turn into tears?

1463
02:33:49,450 --> 02:33:54,220
Your journey is lovely...

1464
02:33:54,420 --> 02:34:02,730
Love, pacify my troubled heart...

1465
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:24,840
Place the jaggery & cumin seeds
on the bride's head

1466
02:34:46,170 --> 02:34:47,930
How can he survive?

1467
02:34:48,510 --> 02:34:50,600
Sir, your guest Ganesh

1468
02:34:50,810 --> 02:34:53,780
The man you leased lands has stabbed him.
He's fighting death.

1469
02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:55,210
We have to take him to town.

1470
02:34:55,480 --> 02:34:56,140
Would any one come with us?

1471
02:34:58,380 --> 02:35:00,580
Sir.
- Don't you've sense?

1472
02:35:01,050 --> 02:35:03,820
Don't you know what is to be told
and what isn't to be told in a marriage?

1473
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:06,190
They'll come after marriage,
you go now.

1474
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:07,250
You carry on.

1475
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:10,160
At least give your car.

1476
02:35:10,730 --> 02:35:12,660
Sir. See to it.
- Okay.

1477
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:16,500
Vasu, you carry on.
Auspicious time is eloping.

1478
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:28,750
I said you can go after
marriage, come & sit there.

1479
02:35:38,990 --> 02:35:40,360
Vasu, I need money.

1480
02:35:40,990 --> 02:35:43,390
You come with it. I'll get clothes.

1481
02:35:50,570 --> 02:35:51,130
What man?

1482
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:55,870
I'll come with you.

1483
02:36:00,810 --> 02:36:04,080
What can we do if they
don't believe us?

1484
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:06,180
Come...come....

1485
02:36:14,460 --> 02:36:16,790
Stop. I'll also come.

1486
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,930
Don't go son-in-law.

1487
02:36:25,170 --> 02:36:26,600
Why are the children going away?

1488
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:33,580
Stop...stop.

1489
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:39,950
Please forgive us, father-in-law.

1490
02:36:41,050 --> 02:36:42,710
We are also angry on him.

1491
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:46,260
But he doesn't have anyone.

1492
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:51,020
You're a God.
Don't get angry.

1493
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:52,160
Lakshmi, what's this?
- I can't stay here.

1494
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:56,100
We can't be pitiless like you.

1495
02:36:57,400 --> 02:36:59,890
Stop I say.

1496
02:37:26,970 --> 02:37:28,260
Why are you still here.

1497
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:32,930
He's near to you than all others.

1498
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:37,730
You needn't sit.
You can also go.

1499
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:45,520
If I wanted to go,
I would've gone long back.

1500
02:37:49,120 --> 02:37:50,350
You didn't raise me like that.

1501
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:53,180
Do you think I'm sitting
here half-heartedly?

1502
02:37:55,790 --> 02:37:57,060
I'm happy.

1503
02:37:58,330 --> 02:38:04,330
I liked him very much and
asked him to talk with you.

1504
02:38:06,670 --> 02:38:09,400
I forgot him the moment,
you didn't like him.

1505
02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:13,110
I'll stay here only.

1506
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:15,200
Let them all come back.

1507
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:17,680
I'll not go there.

1508
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:26,780
Tell someone to get water,
I'm feeling giddy.

1509
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:36,100
I'll not get up from here,
till Vasu comes & marries me.

1510
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:40,660
If you want to go,
feel free to go.

1511
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:58,980
I want Horlicks from tomorrow.

1512
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:02,480
Ask the newspaper man to
deliver weekly magazines.

1513
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:04,050
What's that look?

1514
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:05,080
We have given you our daughter.

1515
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:08,320
Bloody filthy!

1516
02:40:09,130 --> 02:40:09,750
Grandma.

1517
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:14,560
Oh God! My fate.
Will any human like here?

1518
02:40:15,470 --> 02:40:21,960
Briefs, loincloth and every
dirty things is in bathroom.

1519
02:40:22,570 --> 02:40:23,770
Bloody family!

1520
02:40:24,310 --> 02:40:27,340
No Holy Basil plant here.
No prayer's room.

1521
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:29,510
They are killing me.

1522
02:40:29,950 --> 02:40:33,650
Why don't you coming
to do exercise?

1523
02:40:34,090 --> 02:40:35,920
I've been doing it since morning.

1524
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:39,880
Okay, get me a glass of cold water.
- You too.

1525
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:42,660
We've given our girl to you.
Go.

1526
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:45,260
Tell him to get provisions.

1527
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:49,030
Run out of provision in 2 days.
Get them.

1528
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:51,000
Have you added my list too?
- Yes.

1529
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:52,430
You didn't forget anything did you?

1530
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:56,670
No, I wrote everything.
- List seems little long...

1531
02:40:58,510 --> 02:41:00,380
You gave your daughter to me, isn't it?
Go...

1532
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:02,210
I'll get it by working overtime.

1533
02:41:02,450 --> 02:41:03,570
That's it.

1534
02:41:03,950 --> 02:41:07,390
You came as guest and
stole our girl. Bloody thief.

1535
02:41:08,150 --> 02:41:08,850
Thief!

1536
02:41:22,930 --> 02:41:25,430
It's me.
- So what?

1537
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:29,470
Early morning!
Last night up to 3 am...

1538
02:41:30,840 --> 02:41:31,830
Look at your face.

1539
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:33,810
Go to office

1540
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:37,350
I'm your husband.
Why are you shouting at me?

1541
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:38,910
Husband?

1542
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:42,190
Feeling pity on you
they got me married to you.

1543
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:45,090
You can't buy a car but...

1544
02:41:47,390 --> 02:41:50,950
Sorry, we are not used to toilets.
So we went out.

1545
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:00,760
Very difficult

1546
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:12,410


1547
02:42:13,690 --> 02:42:14,650
I'm going to office.

1548
02:42:16,720 --> 02:42:19,520
House is very small.
Please adjust.

1549
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:21,520
In a month, I'll fix a bigger house.

1550
02:42:26,670 --> 02:42:27,690
Won't you talk to me?
