1
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,367
Even though this story is based on
a real-life incident that happened...

2
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,200
...in north lndia, all other
aspects of the film is fictitious

3
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:24,107
No person dead or alive have been portrayed
or characterized based on the incident

4
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,495
Hey watch! Where you are going!
Out...to kill people!

5
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,693
Where are you racing to?
Can't you say even a sorry?

6
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,328
Are you rushing to kill or to eat?

7
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,452
Greetings
Was your journey comfortable?

8
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,686
Talk in Malayalam my boy
You have lost a lot of hair

9
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,289
Don't you get medicated
coconut oil here?

10
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,362
If you want Neelibhringadi (oil)
she can prepare some for you

11
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,029
She hasn't forgotten its recipe

12
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,000
Sure!

13
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,643
We don't get such things here
like we do in our home towns

14
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,541
Are you sure you didn't have any trouble?

15
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,911
Joseph had called just now

16
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,643
I am very hungry

17
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,288
The food in the train was not so good

18
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:54,292
There is a eatery here belonging
to our brother from Palakkad...careful!

19
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,487
We get even our own onion chutney there

20
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,599
I want rice Dalma and mora
And if it's hot, a chana poda

21
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,372
How far is it to Ganjam?

22
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,341
About 200 KM
About 4 hours away

23
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:58,320
Do the flames of the haystack
during Agni Pournami still fall eastward?

24
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,392
They are old traditions, isn't it?

25
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,026
There is nothing like that now in Ganjam
Harvesting is done by machines

26
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,457
Probably that's why
the news papers write...

27
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,027
...only about the starvations
in Oriyan villages

28
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,733
What's this trip for?

29
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,036
A second honeymoon in this old age, eh?

30
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,376
There are many reasons
which I'll tell you later

31
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,082
For the time being
look forward and drive Nila

32
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:11,925
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

33
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:17,797
"...of new born moonbeams
on my mystical veena"

34
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:28,572
"Amidst heartbeats,
like rhythms of spring"

35
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:37,078
"Foreign lands beyond reach,
so far, far away"

36
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:46,961
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

37
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:21,830
"As a stranger sang
untouched by tears"

38
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:29,730
"Along these paths
we travelled without parting"

39
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,645
"On these bare sandy deserts
with no roads"

40
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:44,019
"Drenched in waves of love,
come be my partner"

41
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:57,660
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

42
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,665
The fragrance of Oriyan earth

43
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,174
Doesn't it smell the same every where?

44
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:10,910
It smells different here, Nila

45
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,183
A lot of tears and
blood has been shed here

46
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,289
Nostalgia has gripped your head

47
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,616
Shall I stop for a while?

48
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,796
Yes, stop for sometime
We are not in a hurry, are we?

49
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:42,164
"ln days to come,
as time weaves a tale"

50
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:50,177
"Pains disappear, a single
night spent together"

51
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,114
"On these lands where memories rush in"

52
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,624
"Life burns in scorching heat
of summer of love"

53
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:05,425
"Come as a wave,
as a bright beacon of light"

54
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:17,100
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

55
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:23,445
"...of new born moonbeams
on my mystical veena"

56
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:33,916
"Amidst heartbeats,
like rhythms of spring"

57
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:42,126
"Foreign lands beyond reach,
so far, far away"

58
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,708
These rails that go neither
forward nor backward...

59
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,343
...are the tracks that
memories now travel on

60
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:06,120
Love would have ended here
on these railway tracks

61
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:13,393
But for the goods train
that happened to come at that time

62
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,437
It was a freezing cold night
in winter and a full moon

63
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,233
Even though heaven
and earth was frozen with cold...

64
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,779
...memories of that night
remain fresh and alive

65
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,385
I am hungry, sir
Sir...I'm hungry

66
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,117
Either eat whatever you can find
Or concentrate on your job

67
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,864
Don't die, get up!

68
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,839
Like father taught us,
word of honor is more important

69
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,878
Get up and go fulfill your word of honor

70
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,284
The hillock has reached the sky

71
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,029
Have you given your hay stack, Suneyi?

72
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:31,372
No father! I don't want to die
whatever the circumstances

73
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,977
You are a beautiful girl like golden wheat

74
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,782
Why don't you smile?

75
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:56,833
I am your watch dog, my girl
I will remain with you till I die!

76
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,871
Oriya girl with the complexion of wheat

77
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:19,554
'This land called Kalinga
is what we know as Odisha/Orissa today'

78
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,960
'A land where undercurrents of
religion, love lust and superstitions flow'

79
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:29,125
' 5000 years old it is yet another
heritage of northern lndia'

80
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:34,204
'Even though the world was growing
this village called Ganjam never grew'

81
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,432
'lt is from here, about 35 years back
this story begins'

82
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,172
'Among the Gonds of Ganjam,
Sundara panday and Ratnavalli...'

83
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,341
'who lived singing devotional songs...'

84
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:49,183
'...to Govinda Chandra Srirama,
had 2 lovely daughters'

85
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,515
'Chandrabhage and Suneya'

86
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,317
'Although devadasis( married to God)'

87
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,555
'known as Maharis
of Puri Jagannath were unlawful'

88
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,328
'Yet Jagannaths of modern times
also desired those girls for themselves'

89
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,630
'Like a statue come alive from
Konarks sculptures, Chandrabhaga...'

90
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,471
'...Iives in the inner rooms of
Kamadeva Pradhan's palace'

91
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:16,344
As the day cold weather is bid goodbye
and warm days welcomed on Agni Pournami...

92
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,541
'... Suneyi who will be 18
years old, is also destined'

93
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,485
'...to be the sacrificial victim to
this age old custom of lust'

94
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,355
'This is not the tale of Ganjam alone...'

95
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:31,460
'...but the tragic tale of every woman
who live on pavements'

96
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,072
You'd have heard about me

97
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,301
I used to be a river

98
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,134
Chandrabhaga

99
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,482
Who is there in Orissa
who wouldn't have at least...

100
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,212
...once in his life time, not taken
a dip in me, saluting the rising sun?

101
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:04,094
Although I flowed close to the sun temple
Why did he lust after me?

102
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:11,095
I always liked the moon
that shone in the moonlight

103
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:20,401
That's why when I was pursued
I jumped into the sea to preserve my chastity

104
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,181
Love is not meant to be snatched

105
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,747
It is meant to be softly
plucked from each other

106
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,170
Three months more
for the next full moon

107
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:09,608
Wonder who's going to be
the next sacrificial goat for the Pradhans

108
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,708
Sundrapandey's younger daughter Suneyi

109
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:20,251
She turns 18 then

110
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:27,595
But Ratnavalli will not allow it
She has already decided it seems

111
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,171
It is not man's wish that matters
It is God will that's important

112
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,836
The traditional ritual that's been
going on for years is most important

113
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,275
It's not here that you should
fold your hands and shed tears

114
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,817
But in front of our Lord Lokanathan

115
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:54,784
Be proud that God has chosen
your daughter to be His dasi (God's servant)

116
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,490
Thank Him

117
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:02,895
Now go, there is enough time
to prepare her to become devadasi

118
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:11,433
We won't be able to stand against
God's will or fate, Ratnavalli

119
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:16,507
We have not grown big enough
to question our traditions and practices

120
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:23,517
No! Who shall I tell my woes to?
A blind and deaf Lokanathan?

121
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:30,324
Or to the head of this land
who pretends not to know anything?

122
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:35,824
There is no justice in this

123
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,636
We consider justice
more important than tradition

124
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,502
My daughters' lives
are most important to me

125
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,475
My daughters!

126
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,892
For those who protest against
traditional practices and rituals...

127
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,293
...what else but death
can be its penalty

128
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,699
This is for Puri Jagannath
who lives in the land of Oriya

129
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,844
Mother!

130
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:28,104
Mother! Get up
Open your eyes

131
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,931
In broad daylight, in front of
so many people a murder like this!

132
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,136
And no one to retaliate
Not even you, Ram'ettan

133
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,014
I have been breathing this Oriya air
since the last 20 years

134
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,082
I am still an outsider here

135
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,378
I have neither the right
nor the capacity...

136
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:11,411
...to protest against practices here,
even if I wanted to

137
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,157
So have you lived here for 20 years?

138
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,623
I joined my dad and grandfather
when they came here for areca nut business

139
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,096
Oriya people just like
the areca nut they usually offer...

140
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,135
...on the palate, chewed and
spat out our life also

141
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,768
- Your home town?
- Thalasery

142
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,839
We are areca nut dealers
through generations

143
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,965
Our main areas of business
is Andhra and Orissa

144
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,807
I am coming on recommendation
from Keinchor committee

145
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,844
I have to find out issues
the tribals face these days

146
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:44,645
I must get them to reopen
the single teacher school

147
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,959
Education of village girls
and their security is most important

148
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:55,693
We have to rescue them
from such customs and slavery

149
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:08,536
International Women's Day, Women's Decade
No dearth for announcements

150
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,812
But even today, the safety of girls
in our country is very precarious, Ram'etta

151
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,945
Give it here
Enough of your games

152
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,924
I fear when I think of it
I too have a daughter and nearing 18

153
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,189
When the law is just on paper
Where do we go for help Meera Bai?

154
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,111
Having done yourworst
you are now dozing, eh?

155
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,516
Why did you make that boy
who is still a kid, wear a kakhi dress?

156
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,447
You are decision maker in the family
lsn't that the meaning of this smile?

157
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,051
He will look after everything now
Your reign ends now

158
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,789
Wake up, instead of sleeping like a buffalo

159
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,739
Did you have a bad dream, mother?

160
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,005
Your dad had come,
he gave me a fright

161
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,915
You opened his box, right?
What is that stale smell?

162
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:25,082
Since I got dad's job
Shouldn't I see if the uniform will suit me?

163
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,212
It's good, isn't it?

164
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:31,021
The Government is fulfilling your needs
Now get out of this uniform

165
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,756
Where is this girl?
Salomi!

166
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,062
Mom tell me your opinion

167
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,792
Doesn't this uniform
give me a particular style?

168
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,738
Style? Don't miss
the great constable Kuttan Pilla!

169
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,969
You...!!!
Go make some tea

170
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,575
Mom!

171
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,049
Enough! Enough!

172
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,144
Do remember, just the 2 of us are here

173
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:02,259
Write a letter everyday
You must go to Kerala this Christmas

174
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:08,900
Dad has a friend Mathews
Meet him on your way if you can

175
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,559
How many times will you say all this?
Change your dialogs a bit

176
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,004
It's because all are
trouble riddled places

177
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,104
Be on your guard always

178
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,902
Do we have anyone else
otherthan you?

179
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,675
Oh mom's sentiments
have become stronger

180
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,614
Bro, you go ahead

181
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,047
But just don't cheapen
that uniform you are wearing!

182
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:39,253
Respected Governor sir, since you are
a malayali, we can speak our mother tongue

183
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:44,862
Sir, we are coming from the land of Kalinga
where Gautama Buddha had his roots

184
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:50,105
In Buddha's words, from times immemorial
if the tears of the people of Orissa...

185
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,804
...were to be collected it would be

186
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:58,246
...greater in quantity than
all the lakes of Orissa

187
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:04,983
I understand your emotions, but in a land
where a band of typical bandits rule...

188
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,287
...what can we do with our
limited resources of authority?

189
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,657
You have to retaliate, sir

190
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,226
If you can't, then discard
your civil service positions...

191
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,391
...and come out to the villages with us

192
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,865
Ms Meera Bai, this is an official meeting
Watch what you are saying

193
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,735
How else must I talk?
In a place where there is no justice

194
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,744
A girl was raped right in front
of her mother in the name of tradition

195
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,780
How many days is it
since she has given you...

196
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,817
...a complaint along with
enough number of witnesses?

197
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,845
Have you examined
her nature of complaint?

198
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:40,822
Forget that! Has anybody bothered
to find out if she was dead or alive?

199
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,690
There are witnesses for the murder
of Suneyi's mother by the Pradhans

200
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,867
They are keeping quiet out of fear

201
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:59,938
If a rich man is shot you investigate
his body to see if it was a gold bullet

202
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,309
A poor man's body
is shriveled out of starvation, isn't it?

203
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,381
This is impotency sir
lmpotency of authority

204
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,349
Ms Meera Bai, control yourself

205
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,885
In such instances that is difficult sir

206
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,786
You can draw your weapons
Kill me or shoot me down

207
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:19,329
Arrest the murderers
Ratnavalli be given justice

208
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,729
Security be given to her daughter

209
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,360
Stop it!
Silence!

210
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:46,121
Women like lndira Gandhi governs the country
Yet women are not safe here

211
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:51,124
My friends, we are forced to go
against what Gandhiji taught us

212
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,696
The soul of lndia
does not live in villages

213
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,030
Only the wails of sorrow
of mothers and sisters exist in villages

214
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:13,749
"Writhing and awakening
oh land of Orissa"

215
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:24,452
"Understand, this weeping heart of the land"

216
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:40,007
"With finger tip of the soul anoint
the unfading vermilion symbol of war"

217
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:53,948
"When the homestead
burns, oh Lord of Puri"

218
00:29:54,092 --> 00:30:03,057
"Shower your rain of blessings
in a dance of fury"

219
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:38,367
"Women, like drops of water fell and
shattered on lustful statues of Kalinga"

220
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:48,902
"Have they returned softly to rain
in torrents, from clouds heavy with love"

221
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:59,287
"Memories like scattered poetry
On the burning pyre that's Orissa"

222
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:12,462
"To write out memoirs from my heart
Will you give me a copy of them?"

223
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:20,638
Under section 302 of the lPC
In Chikite colony of Ganjam...

224
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,109
In a case where Ratnavalli
died of gunshot wounds...

225
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,206
...by the accused, suspected
to have committed it

226
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,081
Kamadeva Pradhan has been
hereby ordered to be arrested

227
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:35,490
Ratnavalli's orphaned daughter Suneyi
be given a compensation of Rs 1 lakh...

228
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,563
...as well as 2 policemen
deputed to provide security

229
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,897
Till the case is resolved
ortill the time she requests for it

230
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,165
Orders as perthe district collector

231
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:15,523
"Caged within the bars of the past
Birds of this earth sobbed within it"

232
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:32,543
"Yearning to spread its wings and fly
High up into the sky...a right to freedom"

233
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,738
I will return

234
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,113
The traditional customs must continue

235
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,080
I will come as the conductor
of rituals for Agni Pournami

236
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:16,322
There is no law above
the law of Thakurs

237
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,227
Neither court nor police
Understood?

238
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,217
The job here is a little tough, mother

239
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:21,386
But it doesn't matter
I don't have a choice, isn't it?

240
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,661
We must get our Salome married off

241
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:32,093
Anyone would think he became
a policeman to get me married

242
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,637
Just read the rest of it quickly my girl

243
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:38,038
Soon I will be going on special duty
to a village called Ganjam

244
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,806
Its 2 days journey from here
Please pray for me

245
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,580
Like Salomi said the other day
the dignity of my Police uniform...

246
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:50,677
...has to be upheld and people must
Say, I am as dignified as dad used to be

247
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:56,658
The direct heir of Pradhan
clan is locked up in jail

248
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:04,530
This is a bad omen showing
that the family is heading for calamity

249
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:10,266
Mother, your brains too
have become grey like your hair

250
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:14,742
If Pradhanpur ceases to exist
it means Oriya doesn't anymore

251
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,813
This world will not exist

252
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:26,415
Even the Sun God, so bright and strong
can't keep shining all the time

253
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,515
How can one expect
a mere Pradhan family?

254
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,561
For every sunrise
there is a twilight and a sunset

255
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,254
Be quiet!

256
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:38,258
Dasis (mistress) like you are expected
to live in obedience and in the kitchens!

257
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,505
These are indications of Kalikalam
Otherwise she will not dare speak here

258
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,235
If a dasi has been brought here
to satisfy a Pradhan's lust

259
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,301
Then he better listen
to what she has to say

260
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:52,873
Those days of deaf and dumb dasis are gone
These are modern times respected mother

261
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:58,851
Let me go! Leave me!

262
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,560
This is what is happening
to the Devadasis of Lokanathan

263
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:11,759
The story of women who live as slaves
and concubines inside the Pradhan palace

264
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:16,897
The Pradhans have never been
questioned about their authority

265
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:23,169
It was into this and into the life of a poor
18 year old girl getting ready to be...

266
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:27,182
...the next victim of Pradhan clan,
I was stepping into as a security guard

267
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,618
I was actually destined for greater things
But somehow landed up here

268
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,856
I am not allowed to wield
my authority even for 5 minutes

269
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,326
- Sir, I'll go to the room
- Okay go ahead

270
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:50,202
I saluted thinking he was a higher officer
He has come as my junior

271
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,243
What took you so long I say?

272
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,438
We wandered around a bit
without knowing the way, brother

273
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,913
Brother? A slap if you say that!

274
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,748
What were you instructed
when you joined duty?

275
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,514
To use 'sir' when
addressing your senior

276
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,918
Learn to give respect
and earn respect

277
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:10,255
Look here, you belong to Kerala
I mean you are a Tamilian

278
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,386
Hey you are confusing me!!!

279
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:18,560
You are a Keralaite and I'm a Tamilian
We are on duty here in Orissa

280
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:22,663
Don't think you can
play authority games with me

281
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,308
Sir, where can I keep my bags?

282
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,943
Why don't you try my head?
You deserve a punch for this!

283
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,614
Go to the quarter
where a light is burning

284
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:35,777
Change your dress and come back here
You have to start your duty

285
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,684
No shortage for such drama

286
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,384
Hey! Sit man!
I'll shoot you down

287
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,858
You...!!!
Wake up I say!

288
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:22,728
In Kerala this is acceptable
In Tamil Nadu also its excused

289
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,423
But this is Orissa man!

290
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,527
The government, gives you
a salary and perks along with...

291
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:33,666
...soap, comb, talcum powder
Have they sent you here to sleep?

292
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:38,613
I am supposed to sleep and you
must be on duty...here take this

293
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,579
Hey! Don't go beyond 5 KM from here

294
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,815
The wild buffalos and elephants
from the forest will finish you

295
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,619
Just stay around here

296
00:38:54,532 --> 00:39:02,564
What a relief it will be if I could sleep
in total freedom without this dress on me

297
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,726
It's of no use praying
to the Sun God my dear brahmin

298
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,571
You can't even look at His face

299
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,497
The moon is a better God

300
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,436
What a pest!

301
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,040
Why don't you jump
into this river and die?

302
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,339
It will be better than the life you lead

303
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,471
But you people
never allowed me to do it

304
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,614
I know what you are thinking
Feel like a romp in the water?

305
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,045
If so come
Let's do it

306
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,988
Lord Jagannath!
Give this sinner her due

307
00:39:55,726 --> 00:40:00,459
Come all our sanctity is lost
Let's go to another bank

308
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,054
Come!

309
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:07,766
Hey! Don't go away sulking
We'll have a great time this morning

310
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,666
Come! It's a good time now

311
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:15,440
Hey! The Sun God won't
scorch you in these waters

312
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,038
Come!
Come right now!

313
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,618
Hey! This place is unusually quiet!?

314
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,651
Don't throw something else
instead of the newspaper!

315
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,990
This one's asleep
and this one is also sleeping!

316
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,094
Is this the way to be on duty?

317
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:42,973
Good morning sir!

318
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:47,840
Idiot! Go finish all your
morning ablutions and come

319
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,046
- Hey! Where is that girl?!
-Which girl?

320
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,108
Oh my goodness!
I got this job after so much trouble

321
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,847
What will I do now?

322
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,554
It's not you, but I too will lose my job!

323
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,560
I have 5 wives to look after
Go find and drag her back, man!

324
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,196
Hey! Not that way
Go this way

325
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,593
Dancing the bharathanatyam!
What will I do now!

326
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,729
Oh Lord! I have not even see her

327
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,440
Where do I go looking for her now?

328
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,980
- Fly it higher up
- Like this?

329
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,124
Did you see Sundara Pandey's
daughter go this way?

330
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,465
Yes, I did
She just went in that direction

331
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:54,236
This will get me in trouble
Where will I find this burden?

332
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:59,877
Sure it will! She's not a burden
Her name is Suneyi

333
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,646
Oh malayali?!
What a blessing!

334
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,750
What's your name my boy?

335
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,947
Nilamadhavan

336
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,954
Ram'ettan's son
Everyone calls me Nila

337
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,991
Alright Nila, tell me

338
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,687
How does that girl look like?

339
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,534
Like gold...that's why
people call her Suneyi

340
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,802
- Okay, didn't you say she went this way?
-Yes, this way

341
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,603
I will soon find her

342
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,839
Suneyi!

343
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,527
Yes...Suneyi
That's what I said

344
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:49,632
She went that way
Didn't she, my sister?

345
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,675
- Where is she, da?
- She went this way I was told

346
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:10,680
- Who told you?
- A boy, a malayali to the core

347
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,745
Was there a young girl with him?

348
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,880
Yes, there was

349
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,121
Was she tall and
her head covered?

350
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,695
Was she fair and wearing beads
around her neck?

351
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,822
Did she have a black dot on her forehead?

352
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,797
Yes, she did, but how do
you know all this, sir?

353
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:27,098
You fool! I sawthat girl
in the house yesterday

354
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:31,301
It is to guard her
we have been sent here

355
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,308
Go and drag her home safely

356
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:41,149
Hey, drag her, I meant to bring her home
safe and sound...understand?

357
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,577
No shortage for such drama!
Now go!

358
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,350
Wonder howl will continue
my duty with this guy!!!

359
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:38,308
"Clouds,were colors painted
by the strokes of your brush"

360
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:47,744
"Like dreams from the heart,
fell like droplets on earth"

361
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:56,687
"Prancing in moist mists, oh my dove
Tell me when you will tie the knot"

362
00:45:56,787 --> 00:46:01,156
Hey old man! Do you
have ghosts in this village?

363
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,022
That too ghosts that drink up
brandy at one go?

364
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:12,732
"On strings of the veena tied across as swings
Wonder what melodies swing gently on them"

365
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:19,799
"As thoughts fell gently like droplets
on tiny particles of earth, dear heart"

366
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,778
"May they be like drops of water
in tender thoughts"

367
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:32,379
"A handful of warm
and sweeping affection"

368
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,828
My name is Meera Bai

369
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,163
I am a teacher here
at Heaven of Children's school

370
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,871
I have come to discuss
about Suneyi's education

371
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:31,072
You are aware isn't it, that along with
protection, her future has to be taken care?

372
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,579
I have seen your photos
in the newspapers

373
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,518
Do you know lndira Gandhi?

374
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,214
Do you personally know
Jyothi Basu and Biju Patnaik?

375
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:42,516
I think he is that Kripadanam's left over

376
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,424
Just a dandy showing off

377
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,554
After all a policeman

378
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,196
You can expect
intelligence only of this level

379
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,835
Anyway, an extra burden on us

380
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:59,874
No Ram'etta, I am here with
a solid background and quite capable

381
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,339
As for this uniform, it is indeed
my bread and butter

382
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,883
But please don't demean it

383
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,580
So you are a malayali
Things become easier

384
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,417
He belongs to our place

385
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,481
How did you get this posting?

386
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,194
That's a long story teacher
I just finally landed here, that's all

387
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,121
Tell me what you've come for

388
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,192
Come on, forget our sharp words
We were joking, from previous experiences

389
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,201
Forget all that!

390
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:31,497
Since you know the situation
I don't have to explain

391
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:36,036
Suneyi is my student
She wants to continue studies

392
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,672
But she needs to be given a chance

393
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,474
That guy Kripakaran
is only harassing her

394
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,450
He does not want
to send her to school

395
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,315
If they are educated
they'll get over their fear

396
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,485
I will try

397
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:51,657
I am just an ordinary policeman
But I will do all to help you

398
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,593
We need the moral support
of the youth community like you

399
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:00,127
I am from Talashery
Where are you from in Kottyam?

400
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,964
Kanjikuzhi

401
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,965
Dad was in Orissa police
That's how I landed this job

402
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:11,511
Mother is from Kasergode
I also have a sister Salomi, who is studying

403
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:15,108
Working out of your state itself
Is another kind of social service

404
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,312
Especially in such remote villages

405
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,255
But don't do like dad did, marry
an Oriya girl and live here permanently

406
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,293
You will soon forget your own land

407
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:27,625
Stop talking and serve him food
My daughter Dakshayini

408
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,625
In memory of my mother
I named her Dakshayini

409
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:35,303
For a mere Rs 100, people here
sell their families and spend a life time...

410
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,636
...wallowing in the dirt and muck

411
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:42,735
The dasis get free food
and drugs for the job they do

412
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:47,281
People like Suneyi's father
devotional singers by profession

413
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,080
sing songs travelling
the length and breadth of this land

414
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,711
What do they get in return?
Miseries like this

415
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,120
There is no use of anyone guarding her
She has been written off for them

416
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:00,958
This malpractice has claimed
many girls as victims here

417
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:05,960
Suneyi's sister Chandrabhaga's
fate was also this

418
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:10,735
Now she is a slave
and mistress in that Pradhan's palace

419
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:17,278
That is the fate that awaits
Suneyi also on Agni Pournami day

420
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:43,139
Careful!
Don't burn your hands

421
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,313
She thinks she's still a small child

422
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,060
This is the naming ceremony
of kids in the Gond community

423
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:43,098
Since the baby is a boy, the village priest
dips the instrument used to sever...

424
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,691
...the umbilical cord into blood
and anoint his forehead with it

425
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,568
The original practice was to actually
dip it in the blood of sacrificial animal

426
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,079
He belongs to the Pradhan clan
How can he be the village priest?

427
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:03,846
Being a priest is a facade
A license to do whatever they pleased

428
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,231
The blessings served
is not the usual lime juice

429
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,822
It is Mahua, an alcoholic drink

430
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:20,892
Distilled from the flowers of the Mahua tree
It is just like our own country liquor

431
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,572
Amouthful of this potent drink
will leave you intoxicated for a week

432
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,676
- Want to try?
- No of course not

433
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,603
Police!

434
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:37,353
A policeman in a place where
a sacred ceremony is going on?

435
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,158
He is Suneyi's body guard

436
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:46,160
Hasn't the collector given orders
that he must stay till Agni Pournami?

437
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,925
Ask him to come here

438
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,266
Hey! Come here

439
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:54,531
He has not liked your coming here
Anyway, let's go

440
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:57,501
We can't disobey
he is all authority here

441
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,817
Very respectful person

442
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,512
Has humility too

443
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:15,151
But when in a sacred ritual
is going on...

444
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:19,787
...the Khaki is inauspicious
to the Pradhan clan

445
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:25,495
Next time you come to see me
make sure you are not wearing your Khaki

446
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,330
Understood?

447
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,564
We beg forgiveness

448
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,569
He's new and did it
out of ignorance

449
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,544
I will see that
it won't happen again

450
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,382
Who does he think he is?
The Prime Minister?

451
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,856
He has more power
than the prime minister

452
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:54,759
Old customs of this land
Right or wrong, its better we followthem

453
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,867
It's unfortunate
for this village and its people

454
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:07,776
Go!
Go on

455
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,643
Go...go fast

456
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,351
A brainless girl living in a jungle

457
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:34,785
Playing with my life
Did you have to play with this?

458
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,550
No mother or father
Living alone and does whatever she wants!

459
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,562
Do they even knowthe value of this?
Brainless rascal

460
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,963
Are you trying to frighten
rolling your eyes at me, eh?

461
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:56,804
I didn't mean anything...

462
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,937
Just think of it my girl

463
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,710
Anyone will get angry
if you did such things

464
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,668
No! I just wanted
to ask you not to cry

465
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,044
Hey stop!

466
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,979
Didn't you eat?

467
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,795
I will share my food

468
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:58,963
Eat it

469
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:12,270
If I said anything
to hurt you, forgive me

470
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,813
Sorry! I did not
have any bad intentions

471
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:27,958
I'll give you a portion of my food
Please don't refuse

472
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,939
That was it
That was the beginning

473
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,643
The first feeling of
a malayali man Christudas...

474
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:48,207
...felt towards an Oriya woman,
wheat colored Suneyi

475
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:52,319
Whether it was affection, sympathy...

476
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:59,126
...or was it just feelings
of protector to an orphan

477
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:04,765
Or beyond all this, was it
the first love a young man felt

478
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:12,798
...towards a wheat complexioned
innocent young girl...I don't know

479
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:17,608
Eat

480
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,616
Come on, eat

481
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:59,945
"As clouds move languidly
toward twilight skies"

482
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:04,617
"Have the stars come out
twinkling their hymns?"

483
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:09,855
"Once this evening as
the sun set to slumber away"

484
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:22,202
"Eyes wide open, waiting for the moon to come
Was the day yearning in tender invitation"

485
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:30,343
"Clouds,were colors painted
by the strokes of your brush"

486
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:39,393
"Like dreams from the heart,
fell like droplets on earth"

487
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:48,861
"Prancing in moist mists, oh my dove
Tell me when you will tie the knot"

488
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:28,342
The kids ran away with everything
I brought what I could get

489
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,308
This is for you

490
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,447
What happened?

491
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:37,783
Another 4 weeks
and it will be Agni Pournami

492
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,950
That means...death

493
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,285
Be quiet

494
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,485
He had come in my dreams yesterday also

495
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:49,323
Riding his horse, to take me away forcibly

496
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,236
I am scared Dakshayini

497
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:37,101
Be brave
God will surely send someone

498
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,843
Old times have gone
Odisha is developed state now

499
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,920
Probably because it is now
Odisha instead of Orissa

500
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:21,552
Migration to other states

501
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:28,821
In Kerala alone 7 lakh people
have come in search of jobs

502
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,365
What is wrong in looking
for a better job outside?

503
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,559
Which corner in the world
do we not have malayalis?

504
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,537
True...Iife is more important

505
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:42,201
When we reach dead end,
we run away to a safer place

506
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,177
Like we did once

507
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,179
Did you have a love marriage?

508
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,650
Yes, but not to an Oriya girl

509
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:59,086
My own uncles daughter
who traditionally I have a right to marry

510
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:05,897
Distance did not scare you
out of a relationship, right?

511
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,198
Real relationships are like that

512
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:14,207
I came to know of that
during that journey to the court

513
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:58,249
'For Suneyi, beyond
the limits of the village...'

514
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,949
'...it was a borderless
world full of colours'

515
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,958
'The city and its magical scenes'

516
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:11,098
'But the laughter those scenes
brought to her face, did not last long'

517
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,930
'Those court procedures
once travelled a long time back...'

518
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:21,375
'...today sent her back pitilessly
to her old state from the court rooms'

519
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,699
In our language it's known
as the fruits of our deeds

520
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,499
All clannish people, who suppress
and subjugate lives of others, end this way

521
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,806
Not here alone, but anywhere in the world

522
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,410
I heard the archeology department
was commissioned to take this up

523
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,851
A long time back
But who's bothered!!!

524
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,584
Nothing has happened till now

525
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:09,357
Who wants to remember a past
that's full of cursed memories

526
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:17,428
Today's lesson is about
Meera Bai's devotional poems

527
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,997
Meera's devotion was
her love for Lord Krishna

528
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:25,747
Radha's divine love
for Krishna as love songs...

529
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:30,046
...was found to flow
in the poetry of Meera Bai

530
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:34,746
Krishna was her protector
savior and her whole universe

531
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:46,300
'Even though I was not Meera Bai's student
I'd got used to her lessons by now'

532
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:50,264
'Love was the topic of her lesson'

533
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:55,406
'Her songs were filled
with Krishna's love'

534
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:59,805
'lnvisible strings of love
bind me tight...'

535
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:09,723
'...and trapped in those threads
I was its slave'

536
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:15,688
'Meera Bai's lesson had begun with love
but ended with the sorrow of her separation'

537
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:20,833
'Just as bad was against goodness
Separation was an enemy to love'

538
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:25,529
Hey Radha! Get up
Lessons are over, shall we leave?

539
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:45,718
When eye meets eye, it turns dangerous

540
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:46,556
What?

541
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,026
Dangers of falling in love
The symptoms have appeared

542
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,332
I don't wish to be a gooseberry

543
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:59,134
Krishna and Radha can come
on your own after your love games

544
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:00,934
Daksha!

545
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,979
What the heck did that girl
utter just now and go?

546
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:09,778
Tell me, what did she say?

547
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,410
When two eyes collide
it becomes dangerous

548
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,546
The dangers of falling in love

549
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:58,032
Oh! Rain!

550
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:03,004
Hey! Stop this childishness
Come away

551
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:34,566
Will you be with me like this forever?
Tell me...!

552
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,966
Will you?

553
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:46,840
If I am yourwatchdog, I shall remain
with you forever, till my last breath...

554
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:51,181
...oriya girl with the color of golden wheat

555
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:24,545
"Will you tell me oh flower petal
My tender heart of hearts"

556
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:35,282
"What is it that brings me sweet pain?
Is it the moon light or the rain?"

557
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:46,289
"On lonely streets I wander
in pangs of separation..."

558
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:54,232
"...with you beside me
tremulous and trembling"

559
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:09,987
"Will you tell me oh flower petal
My tender heart of hearts"

560
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:44,388
"As the midnight jasmine
blossoms sway in full bloom"

561
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:56,401
"The paths that you choose to walk
Bringing beauty and prosperity in bountiful"

562
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:12,844
"As my palate of life overflows with love
My friend can you adorn yourself with it"

563
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:27,959
"Will you tell me oh flower petal
My tender heart of hearts"

564
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:38,273
"What is it that brings me sweet pain?
Is it the moon light or the rain?"

565
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:11,111
"Stars of spring rained in
showers and finally stopped"

566
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:23,017
"Golden sandal blossomed along...
all along shady glades"

567
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:33,795
"As the heart awakens
to blue skies of sunrise"

568
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:43,508
"Will you sing silently
oh 6th asterism Betelgeuse"

569
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:57,248
"Will you tell me oh flower petal
My tender heart of hearts"

570
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,034
Suni

571
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:17,908
Come!

572
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:54,106
If religious rites are
violated not only Pradhans

573
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,435
but the entire Gond
community will become mad

574
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:58,171
Now everything is her fate

575
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:02,239
The Pradhans are the reigning Lords
They will decide her fate

576
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,264
You sneaking rascal
Where were you all this while?

577
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,635
Have you come here on duty?
Or was it for something else?

578
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:25,603
Forget it!

579
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,710
These are mischief of
the Lord Puri Jagannath

580
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,376
Repercussions will soon follow

581
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:43,280
You, an outsider, following
a different faith

582
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,122
will not know
the traditions of Ganjam

583
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:51,255
You do not realize the after effects
of violating traditional practices

584
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:54,493
But she will realize
and she must undergo the trial

585
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,332
The girl who will be donated to the Lord

586
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,997
The girl predetermined for Him

587
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,308
A mere glance from
another man with vested interest...

588
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,677
...is enough for to consign
this village to flames

589
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,216
Let whatever happened
be over and done with

590
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:15,583
A propitiation ceremony to counter this
wrong act has to be performed today itself

591
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:19,487
Till it is over,
she will not see daylight

592
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,096
Sun-rays must not touch her

593
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:33,601
Her body must be dedicated
to Lokanathan the remaining 4 days

594
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:47,777
May the Lokanath
Lord Jagannath forgive her

595
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:02,466
Let me go!

596
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,203
Leave me

597
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,450
'That was her destiny'

598
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,084
'This land of Lord Jagannath,
where the Pradhan clan reigned...'

599
01:24:56,191 --> 01:25:01,060
'...as undisputed lords
decided and enforced this fate'

600
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,123
'The horse carriage that went
further and further away from me...'

601
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,202
'...and inside it a wailing being
who was their prisoner'

602
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:14,835
'This was something that echoed
and re echoed like thunder in my mind...'

603
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,638
'...the whole day'

604
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:41,231
It was a mistake
A great mistake

605
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:45,431
For people who believed tradition
this was costlier than their blood...

606
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,398
...an inexcusable mistake

607
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,369
It is Agni Pournami
the 5th day from today

608
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,213
She will come out of her dark room

609
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,882
Customary rites will be conducted

610
01:25:56,451 --> 01:26:00,285
Next morning she will become
Lord Lokanathan's dasi

611
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:06,257
That means, the self-proclaimed
representative of Lord Lokanathan...

612
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,489
...Kamadeva Pradhan
will claim his next victim

613
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,734
Will you be able to change
her destiny before that happens?

614
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:22,371
Do you have the guts to take her away
and go lead a life in some far off place?

615
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:29,706
If so, you should take the place
of Lokanathan's representative on earth

616
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:35,220
You, who belongs to a different land
and follow a different religion

617
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,826
Mother just do as I ask you to
I will be there on time to board the train

618
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,531
We will definitely
go to Kerala together

619
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,230
What is it?
What has happened to you?

620
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,734
There was no news from you for a long time
That's why we came to find out

621
01:26:56,844 --> 01:27:00,746
Going through this difficult journey
And now my son you say...

622
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:04,808
I am telling you mother
I have some unfinished work, you go

623
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,478
Let's go together brother

624
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:07,919
Just do what I say Salomi

625
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,321
Babu, take them to the railway station

626
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:14,190
- Don't hurry be careful
- Okay, sir

627
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:02,903
What is it my son?

628
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:05,738
Who is he?

629
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,915
When you yearn you must see

630
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,813
When you hungry you must eat

631
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:52,821
When ripe it must be harvested

632
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,525
Isn't that right my dear policeman?

633
01:28:57,098 --> 01:29:00,932
Who are they?
Yourfamily?

634
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:05,472
Has your family also come
to help you guard Pandey's girl?

635
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:07,802
Who are you to ask?

636
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:10,910
Pradhan
Kamadeva Pradhan

637
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:18,014
Got out of jail only yesterday
Agni Pournami is nearing

638
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:21,913
If I don't come
There will be a lapse in tradition

639
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,818
This entire region
belong to the Pradhan family

640
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,923
Both the earth and
the women here belong to us

641
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,490
We sow and we reap
No one is there to stop us

642
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:38,972
I have not come here to fight with you
Suneyi is an innocent girl

643
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:40,739
Give her to me

644
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:44,403
Come to my place!
Rescue her and take her away

645
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,739
Whatever happens, the haystack
of Agni Pournami...

646
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:49,715
...will burn in the courtyard
of Pradhan house

647
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,979
Traditional rituals will be
performed as usual

648
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:58,548
The wheat complexioned girl will
after that belong to Lord Lokanathan and me

649
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:06,524
I am hereby inviting you
to witness the Agni Pournami rituals

650
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:45,703
What was he saying?
What is your problem here?

651
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:48,703
I will explain all that later
Now please go

652
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,715
If you starve, the harvest will be poor

653
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:02,514
Eat

654
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,453
Eat

655
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:07,491
We don't need revolutionaries here

656
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:09,161
Go out!

657
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:15,998
We do not use guns or swords as weapons
We use the broom

658
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:19,903
Don't force us to use this on you
Better release Suneyi before that

659
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:26,212
I am also ready for such
uncivilized games Meera Bai

660
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,744
Do you see this?
Bound with a gold thread

661
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:35,118
Like the broom in the old fable
of King Purushothaman and his authority

662
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:40,489
No woman has dared speak
in Pradhans courtyard like this

663
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:45,089
Once you begin, tomorrow
all these slave girls will follow...

664
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:49,000
...and the men of Pradhan clan
will be forced to hang their heads

665
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:53,096
To prevent that...!!!

666
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:04,774
Drink this coconut water

667
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:14,286
Take it

668
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,527
Tell me, do you want to go inside?

669
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:30,007
No! It is not mine alone
My teacher's tears, blood...

670
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:31,272
Okay, take rest

671
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:38,982
Nila, let's go
We are feeling very tired

672
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:17,082
These are the 2 characters
that you've met only in stories

673
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:19,249
Christudas and Suneyi

674
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:25,559
Yes, they are like
monuments of immortal love

675
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:29,861
I was waiting to meet and talk to you

676
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:40,975
- Radha...isn't that your name?
- Yes...come in

677
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:47,011
Where is he, your son Appu?

678
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:50,817
On his way back from school
He was very happy this morning

679
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:53,723
Hearing a new grandpa
and grandma were coming

680
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:01,262
Eat this also

681
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:03,636
-Where are they?
- Sitting outside

682
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:09,903
Must be the change in climate
that's making you cough continuously

683
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:14,846
Here, swallowthis tablet

684
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:20,010
If you are breathless,
I'll bring the inhaler

685
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:20,984
No, it's okay

686
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,420
Are there tablets
to be taken after dinner?

687
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:29,022
Doctors prescribe medicines
almost equal to the quantity of food

688
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:34,960
Dakshayini?

689
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:36,832
She stays with her
daughter in Koraput

690
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:39,064
I have informed her...she'll
come as soon as possible

691
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:43,439
Ram'ettan always wanted
to get her married to a man in Kerala

692
01:34:43,978 --> 01:34:48,074
Her husband is a malayali, but like us
He has always lived outside of Kerala

693
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:49,341
Runs a Bakery

694
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:53,851
Tell her to bring
the kids also when she comes

695
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,449
- It has been such a long time
- I have told her

696
01:34:56,757 --> 01:34:59,317
May be you should go to bed now
You have had a long journey, isn't it?

697
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:04,194
- True! I do feel tired
- Come on, help her

698
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:11,228
Slowly

699
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:17,300
- What about you?
- I'll come later, you sleep

700
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:26,742
I wanted to meet
Ram'ettan at least once

701
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:28,319
But could not

702
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:35,725
I didn't want to come back here

703
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:39,764
Father was most happy about you

704
01:35:40,201 --> 01:35:44,297
He talked about Agni Pournami
just before his death also

705
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:48,937
They are strange bonds of relationship
we share from previous births

706
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:52,839
Can I have a cigarette?

707
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:57,277
She doesn't allow me usually

708
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,011
This is my only vice

709
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:11,428
Where are you going all alone?

710
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,892
There's a bright moonlight

711
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,169
Let me walk around a bit
You can go to bed

712
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:26,813
Mother slept as soon as she lay down
Where is he going?

713
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:29,010
In search of memories

714
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:31,374
Thank God the old hunters no longer exist

715
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:33,851
Let him come, I'll wait
You go sleep

716
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:30,023
I have been nursing
this desire since many years

717
01:40:30,591 --> 01:40:33,253
Every year it's my brother
who conducts the rituals

718
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:39,999
I am also one of the Pradhan sons
I too have feelings and desires

719
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:46,601
This time before brother
I will conduct the rituals

720
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,504
I shall enjoy
the fruit of this tradition

721
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:58,050
Beautiful girl, the auspicious
moment has come

722
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:08,026
Your time has not
yet come, my brother

723
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:09,322
So go away

724
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:13,495
You have had many chances
This girl is for me

725
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:14,761
Have you become so brave?

726
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,060
Do brothers have to
compete among themselves?

727
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:19,435
Why not?
I'll draw my weapon also

728
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:21,838
Go ahead and draw

729
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:25,101
I will conduct this ritual
Even if I have to kill you to perform it

730
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,280
Go!

731
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:05,383
Go away!

732
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:09,885
Go away quickly!

733
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:07,863
No one can escape destiny, my friend

734
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:16,780
She belongs to Lord Jagannathan and
is the blessed offering given to us Pradhans

735
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:20,250
I will kill you

736
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:21,749
Go away

737
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:23,821
Quickly!

738
01:53:51,624 --> 01:53:53,785
Oh God! What is this hitch again?

739
01:53:54,127 --> 01:53:56,459
Someone's lying across our way

740
01:53:56,529 --> 01:53:59,259
Look he's lying there
on the track

741
01:54:09,943 --> 01:54:11,001
Sit down

742
01:54:17,383 --> 01:54:21,342
Don't cry my girl, smile
This is your good fortune

743
01:54:21,955 --> 01:54:24,185
Do you know howmany
girls I've brought here...

744
01:54:24,257 --> 01:54:26,225
...and made to sit all
dressed and jeweled?

745
01:54:26,326 --> 01:54:29,056
Agirl is just a piece of meat

746
01:54:29,195 --> 01:54:33,029
A piece of meat that will
appease the hunger of a man

747
01:54:35,268 --> 01:54:36,428
All of you go out

748
01:55:01,327 --> 01:55:02,191
Goodness! What happened?

749
01:55:02,262 --> 01:55:04,890
Pests out to cause sheer trouble

750
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:07,056
What happened to you?
Tell us

751
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:09,599
He is injured very badly

752
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:10,499
What's wrong?

753
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,502
Why was the train stopped

754
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:12,196
Who is this?

755
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:14,136
Here hold this
I'll get some water

756
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:15,172
Here hold him

757
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:20,379
It's closing time
The first signal has already come

758
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,412
I know it man!

759
01:55:21,481 --> 01:55:23,915
There are so many other
ways to kill yourself

760
01:55:23,983 --> 01:55:26,178
Can't you spare these
railway tracks?

761
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:28,214
Water

762
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:30,885
Water

763
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:32,519
Sir, he's a malayali

764
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:36,527
Why are you here?
What happened?

765
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:40,663
I don't want to die

766
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:42,399
I must go

767
01:55:43,369 --> 01:55:44,893
I must keep my promise

768
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:47,095
I must rescue

769
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:50,008
Who?
Tell us what the issue is?

770
01:56:00,353 --> 01:56:07,282
Awoman is just a piece of meat
Meant to appease the hunger in man

771
01:56:43,229 --> 01:56:46,687
I am a poor engine driver
This job is my bread and butter

772
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,731
This chap here is the guy
who shows us the way

773
01:56:51,104 --> 01:56:55,438
We don't have time
to stand here listening to your story

774
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:59,509
We have to travel according to signal
So please allow us to go on our way

775
01:57:06,119 --> 01:57:11,250
My dear boy, just move away from the track
Go fulfill your promise

776
01:57:19,632 --> 01:57:21,566
Your love appears to be true

777
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:27,402
That is why the train stopped so near you
and your life was saved

778
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:31,670
Now this train will lie here for 3 hours
to allowthe Bengal express pass by

779
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:35,206
If you can bring her
here in these 3 hours

780
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:39,149
We can leave with your Oriya
girl back to Kerala

781
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:09,146
We will wait near the river

782
01:58:09,215 --> 01:58:13,515
A chance, don't forget, 3 hours
go and come back with her

783
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:37,366
Pradhan!

784
02:00:56,482 --> 02:00:58,575
Give me my Suneyi

785
02:00:59,752 --> 02:01:01,743
Give me my Suneyi

786
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:14,590
We will go somewhere and live

787
02:01:16,602 --> 02:01:20,368
We will go somewhere and live

788
02:01:23,009 --> 02:01:27,878
I will not live without Suneyi
I will not go from here without her

789
02:01:28,714 --> 02:01:33,276
I will not leave her here
and go anywhere

790
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:44,793
I will not live without Suneyi
I will not go from here without her

791
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:47,991
Kill me along with her

792
02:01:52,672 --> 02:01:56,267
Kill me along with her

793
02:02:02,715 --> 02:02:05,684
Open!
Allow him to come inside

794
02:04:08,874 --> 02:04:09,772
Take her

795
02:04:10,476 --> 02:04:12,967
Take her away
Everything is over

796
02:04:13,946 --> 02:04:19,509
This dasi who belongs
to us by tradition is...

797
02:04:19,585 --> 02:04:23,954
...being given to you as alms

798
02:04:24,857 --> 02:04:25,687
Take her away

799
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:36,662
Go far away
Anywhere you want

800
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:41,566
But let us not see you
on this land ever again

801
02:04:42,675 --> 02:04:43,607
Go away

802
02:05:40,332 --> 02:05:43,733
Don't touch me!
I am soiled!

803
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:53,008
I don't have any wish to live

804
02:05:55,014 --> 02:05:59,110
Nothing has happened

805
02:06:06,292 --> 02:06:12,026
It was only like a mad dog bit you

806
02:06:13,799 --> 02:06:14,322
That's all

807
02:06:51,337 --> 02:06:56,138
So many years, all through this life

808
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:07,345
So much water of this great river
has flowed under the bridge

809
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:14,020
So has these
painful experiences

810
02:07:23,736 --> 02:07:27,194
The rain, a little
cold and with

811
02:07:28,107 --> 02:07:35,172
a herd of goats, among
those rocky caves...

812
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:41,716
...do you feel like
spending one more night?

813
02:07:42,388 --> 02:07:46,051
My wheat complexioned
Oriya girl?

814
02:07:52,398 --> 02:07:54,662
Did you hear their sweet murmurs?

815
02:07:54,733 --> 02:07:55,757
No! What did they say?

816
02:07:55,868 --> 02:07:59,269
Your head! First learn to love

817
02:07:59,872 --> 02:08:03,933
It is so charming
to listen even at this age

818
02:08:04,076 --> 02:08:07,910
So you were peeping in on them, eh?
This is not a good sign, okay?

819
02:08:08,047 --> 02:08:12,814
Hiding is beautiful
You men should know better, right?

820
02:08:13,085 --> 02:08:14,109
Here's your tea

821
02:08:16,855 --> 02:08:23,886
Let this heat subside
We will go around those paths once again

822
02:08:49,288 --> 02:08:53,952
Suneyi!

823
02:09:59,992 --> 02:10:00,981
What happened?

824
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,386
What happened to her?

825
02:10:04,963 --> 02:10:09,457
You asked me once
what was the purpose of our trip?

826
02:10:11,603 --> 02:10:13,093
This was the reason

827
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:23,272
To breathe her last
on this very soil she was born on

828
02:10:25,417 --> 02:10:26,816
This is over now

829
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:39,192
Next her journey from this earthly life
has to follow what her mother did...

830
02:10:40,332 --> 02:10:44,792
...swargadwar ( threshold of heaven)

831
02:10:47,072 --> 02:10:51,304
She also has to go the same way

832
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,046
That's all

833
02:11:09,094 --> 02:11:19,402
Funeral rites

834
02:12:14,126 --> 02:12:18,654
Take this pot and go round 3 times

835
02:13:29,201 --> 02:13:37,631
"ln days to come,
as time weaves a tale"

836
02:13:37,776 --> 02:13:45,547
"Pains disappear, a single
night spent together"

837
02:13:45,684 --> 02:13:50,053
"On these lands
where memories rush in"

838
02:13:50,155 --> 02:13:54,387
"Life burns in scorching heat
of summer of love"

839
02:13:54,493 --> 02:14:00,363
"Come as a wave,
as a bright beacon of light"

840
02:14:03,835 --> 02:14:12,573
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

841
02:14:12,711 --> 02:14:18,479
"...of new born moonbeams
on my mystical veena"

842
02:14:20,652 --> 02:14:28,752
"Amidst heartbeats,
like rhythms of spring"

843
02:14:28,827 --> 02:14:37,496
"Foreign lands beyond reach,
so far, far away"

844
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:47,474
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

845
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:57,555
We shall be born once again

846
02:14:57,823 --> 02:15:02,419
We have not had our fill
of sharing and caring in this birth

847
02:15:03,829 --> 02:15:08,528
In those hot summers of love
like the cool shade...

848
02:15:09,234 --> 02:15:13,466
...Iike a stream of cool thrills
we shall turn ourselves into

849
02:15:13,572 --> 02:15:16,598
Me and my Suneyi

850
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:22,444
Times don't end
Neither do stories!

851
02:15:48,773 --> 02:15:57,340
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

852
02:15:57,549 --> 02:16:02,919
"...of new born moonbeams
on my mystical veena"

853
02:16:05,557 --> 02:16:13,555
"Amidst heartbeats,
like rhythms of spring"

854
02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:21,833
"Foreign lands beyond reach,
so far, far away"

855
02:16:23,742 --> 02:16:32,172
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

856
02:16:58,677 --> 02:17:07,244
"As a stranger sang
untouched by tears"

857
02:17:07,485 --> 02:17:14,482
"Along these paths
we travelled without parting"

858
02:17:15,393 --> 02:17:19,625
"On these bare sandy deserts
with no roads"

859
02:17:19,731 --> 02:17:29,606
"Drenched in waves of love,
come be my partner"

860
02:17:33,645 --> 02:17:42,451
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

861
02:18:21,693 --> 02:18:30,067
"ln days to come,
as time weaves a tale"

862
02:18:30,502 --> 02:18:37,032
"Pains disappear, a single
night spent together"

863
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:42,642
"On these lands
where memories rush in"

864
02:18:42,781 --> 02:18:47,013
"Life burns in scorching heat
of summer of love"

865
02:18:47,118 --> 02:18:52,954
"Come as a wave,
as a bright beacon of light"

866
02:18:56,695 --> 02:19:05,034
"Birth after birth on this earth,
be like the notes..."

867
02:19:05,470 --> 02:19:10,806
"...of new born moonbeams
on my mystical veena"

868
02:19:13,411 --> 02:19:21,318
"Amidst heartbeats,
like rhythms of spring"

869
02:19:21,586 --> 02:19:30,085
"Foreign lands beyond reach,
so far, far away"

870

be like the notes..."
