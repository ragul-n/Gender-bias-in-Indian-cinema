1
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:21,088
Vikram, it's not easy
for me to say this.

2
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,655
So, please listen
to me carefully.

3
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:27,655
We can't be
together because...

4
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,562
I don't understand
you anymore.

5
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:34,104
I tried to console myself
but it's impossible.

6
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:38,635
I am leaving you.

7
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,674
I chose to record this
message because...

8
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,576
I don't want to talk to you.

9
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:46,681
No discussion...
no arguments.

10
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:50,117
I suggest you forget me.

11
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,190
Roshni...

12
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,256
Yeah?

13
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:04,865
Hello...

14
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,165
I am so proud of you.

15
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:08,562
Thank you.

16
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,167
Today I'm a simple
photographer.

17
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:14,672
Do you believe in my art...

18
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,103
Do you?

19
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:17,204
Yes.

20
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:21,611
I may not be rich today.

21
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:28,854
But one day I will
be somebody.

22
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,155
Do you believe me?

23
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,656
I do.

24
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:13,113
Hi.

25
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,118
What is it?

26
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:20,322
What's wrong?

27
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,862
Remember I had sent some
photographs to an agency in Bombay?

28
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,058
Yes.

29
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,762
Well, the agency people are here
and they want me to shoot forthem.

30
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:34,235
The catch is I have to move
to India for one year contract.

31
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:37,946
But I told them...

32
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,378
I'll think about it.

33
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,213
This is a good break
for your career.

34
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,815
It's a prestigious platform.

35
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:50,325
Don't think... just go.

36
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,924
I don't want to leave you and go.

37
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,329
And you can't go.

38
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:59,127
You have a successful
career here.

39
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:00,727
Your life...

40
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:01,962
yourfriends.

41
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:03,931
So.

42
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:15,375
You know what...

43
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:17,244
screw it.

44
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:19,913
Screw the job.

45
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,958
I can get a job in India too.

46
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:27,826
Moreover,
I want to live with you.

47
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:29,423
But...

48
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,701
you have to promise me one thing...

49
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:35,333
you will never
abandon me.

50
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,365
Yeah?

51
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:40,067
Never.

52
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,335
Sir, this is the house
that we spoke about.

53
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,060
Come.

54
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,772
What do you think?

55
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,140
One moment.

56
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:02,242
Happy?

57
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:03,543
Very!

58
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:07,021
It's exactly as you
wanted it to be.

59
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:11,219
Farfrom the
madding crowd.

60
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,639
I can't bearto see
lonely men cry.

61
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,844
I think he's either a coward...

62
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:43,678
or he's trying to get
over a mistake.

63
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:47,386
I think it's something else.

64
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:54,897
There's something
melancholic about him.

65
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,866
Are you reading his face?

66
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,671
Sir, your bill.

67
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,017
Sir, it's time to close
the restaurant.

68
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:26,786
Thank you.

69
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:49,118
Did you leave your eyes
behind in yourwife's purse?

70
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:57,127
Stop it... let him go.

71
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:59,129
Why drink when you can't handle it?

72
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:01,055
He started it.

73
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:02,863
I 'll make you sober in a minute.

74
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:07,262
Are you okay?

75
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,264
No...

76
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,268
I'm not okay.

77
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:12,801
Let me call for a taxi.

78
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,139
No...

79
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:16,171
I'm fine!

80
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,081
I have a car...

81
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:22,713
I am okay.

82
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:24,551
You seem intent
on driving...

83
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,319
but I don't think you can.

84
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:51,671
Right.

85
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,548
Sometimes right,
sometimes left...

86
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:02,553
sometimes ahead,
sometimes behind...

87
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,458
we've been driving
in this mannerfor hours.

88
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,463
Can you tell me the exact
address, please?

89
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:21,879
Hunters and their prey...

90
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,478
have one address...
the jungle.

91
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:30,643
Right.

92
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:32,278
EEnough is enough.

93
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,282
He didn't give his address,
what else could I do?

94
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,789
But what do we do now?

95
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,019
I don't know...

96
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:41,761
but we can't leave
him here.

97
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,869
Let's take him home.

98
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,959
Home?

99
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:47,595
What if someone
sees him?

100
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:50,073
Oh no!

101
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:51,234
Let's take him home.

102
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,834
If we leave him out here,
he'll cause trouble for us.

103
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,034
Come on.

104
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,171
Stop it.

105
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:03,910
He is heavy.

106
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:07,084
Let me get him a blanket.

107
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,292
I know this couch is small...

108
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,826
but you can sleep here.

109
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:19,930
Baby, I am very tired.

110
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,330
Good night.

111
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,643
No arguments...

112
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:33,911
no arguments...

113
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:37,845
no arguments...

114
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,210
Good morning.

115
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,117
Good morning, Vikram.

116
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,549
Your coffee.

117
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:18,755
I hope you slept well.

118
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:20,753
By the way...

119
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:21,821
I'm Nisha.

120
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:24,830
How do you know
my name?

121
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,265
You told me last night.

122
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,205
DK...

123
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:16,677
I just want to work now.

124
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:20,383
Give me so much work, that
I don't even have time for myself.

125
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,217
Correct... correct...

126
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:24,889
But you know very
well that...

127
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,960
when you have assignments,
you're loaded.

128
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:32,268
But otherwise, there's
nothing to do.

129
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,866
You won't be interested in
wedding photography...

130
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:37,931
I am.

131
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,272
I will do anything.

132
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:44,715
I just want to be busy.

133
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:53,050
To be honest, I don't even
feel like going back to that house.

134
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,019
Correct... correct...

135
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,324
But the place where
a man fears to go...

136
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:04,332
is the place where
he'll find his answers.

137
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:08,770
My friend, if you
want to move on...

138
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:12,139
you should forget
about her...

139
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,232
immediately...

140
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,068
from today.

141
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:16,703
Right now.

142
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:35,722
Hi...

143
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,965
I thank you forwhat you did
and I am sorry forwhat I did.

144
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,128
Sorry?

145
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:43,963
Sorry... I mean...

146
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,632
forthis morning.

147
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:47,838
That was really rude.

148
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:50,104
You don't like to wake up in
a stranger's small apartment...

149
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:51,371
I figured that.

150
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,739
It's okay.

151
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:58,153
If you don't forgive me,
I can't forgive myself.

152
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,384
If you don't mind...

153
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:03,885
as an apology...

154
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,857
tonight's dinner is on me.

155
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:09,922
Thanks...

156
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,834
but I don't go on dates
with patrons.

157
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:14,260
Sorry.

158
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:17,204
Surely a patron can
seek forgiveness.

159
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,838
And it's not a date,
it's an idea.

160
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:22,779
My way of apologizing.

161
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,819
I'll wait. No problem.

162
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,849
One whisky please!

163
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,671
Take the keys.

164
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:03,606
Okay.

165
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:04,670
Bye.

166
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:09,442
Are you hungry?

167
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:12,478
Come with me.

168
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:14,735
I am sure you don't live
alone in this big villa?

169
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:19,504
I do live alone...

170
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:23,005
because I am alone.

171
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:25,204
So am I.

172
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:30,015
Nisha...

173
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:32,220
when did you wake up?

174
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:35,165
Awhile ago.

175
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:39,625
Come on...

176
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:41,630
breakfast is ready.

177
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,138
I see that you live alone,
farfrom the city...

178
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,844
in this museum-like
mansion...

179
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:57,848
but I can't...

180
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:00,519
figure out why.

181
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,686
You seem to be in a hurry
to know everything.

182
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:09,222
I just said that...

183
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:13,932
it's okay if you
don't want to tell me.

184
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,798
There was a time...

185
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:19,001
when I took photographs
of wild animals in the jungle.

186
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:25,572
These days it's photographs
of city dwelling animals.

187
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:33,623
I like to be close to nature.

188
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:37,785
There's so much to learn.

189
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,858
For a new beginning...

190
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:45,057
it is important to sever old ties.

191
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:50,563
Leaves dry and wither away,
only to give way to new leaves.

192
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,947
So what are you thinking?

193
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,153
It's better not to think too
much and let things fall in place.

194
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,867
Get dressed,
I'll drop you off.

195
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,170
You?

196
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:32,805
Good morning.

197
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:34,748
It's past noon.

198
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:37,677
In the government,
there's no rule...

199
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:40,280
that dictates you can't say good
morning even if it's afternoon.

200
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:41,789
If you don't mind.

201
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,990
Sorry, I guess you do mind...

202
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:50,925
because we didn't think...

203
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:54,763
you'd get close to someone
else so soon.

204
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:56,963
Otherwise we wouldn't bother you.

205
00:29:57,775 --> 00:29:58,764
Come in.

206
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:07,441
This house is really big...

207
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:09,149
and exceptionally nice.

208
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:12,484
Just like you.

209
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:16,454
When did you move in?

210
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:18,351
It's been a few weeks.

211
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:19,852
Is that so?

212
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,129
Did you try to contact her?

213
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,129
Of course, I did...

214
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:28,302
but her phone is switched off.

215
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:32,808
And nobody seems to
know of herwhereabouts.

216
00:30:35,246 --> 00:30:38,875
Well, we did check at the airports,
railways junctions and bus depots.

217
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,248
But we didn't find her.

218
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,185
She hasn't left Mumbai.

219
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:45,844
Who?

220
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:47,780
His girlfriend.

221
00:30:49,026 --> 00:30:50,015
Roshni.

222
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:51,486
He hasn't told you?

223
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:57,032
Well, he still hasn't
introduced herto us.

224
00:30:57,902 --> 00:30:58,891
This is Nisha.

225
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,025
She is...

226
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:01,994
she is my friend.

227
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:04,898
You see, we're cops.

228
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:06,906
We don't like
incomplete information.

229
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:08,438
If you don't mind...

230
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,811
your complete name?

231
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:13,275
Nisha Sengupta.

232
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:18,477
Do you know her?

233
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,392
It's a small world, sir.

234
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:24,516
Right...

235
00:31:24,762 --> 00:31:26,161
and round too!

236
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,302
Tell me, did Roshni leave
any stuff behind when she left?

237
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:36,235
Atoothbrush in the
bathroom and...

238
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:38,302
that table where she worked.

239
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,275
Here?

240
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:42,334
Yes.

241
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:49,877
If you don't mind...

242
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:54,755
can we take a look
around your house and garden?

243
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:57,026
If you don't mind...
- Is it really necessary?

244
00:31:57,261 --> 00:32:00,753
Why don't you leave,
what's necessary to us?

245
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:02,554
Come on, sir.

246
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:08,570
Yes.

247
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:09,799
What's going on, Vikram?

248
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:22,843
The cops think I've
buried her here.

249
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:24,810
Idiots.

250
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:26,917
But you said you are single.

251
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:28,547
I am.

252
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:31,652
Roshni left me...

253
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:33,662
probably for another guy.

254
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:35,658
Why are the cops here?

255
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,031
They are unable to trace her.

256
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:39,791
What?

257
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:42,561
I hope no one has kidnapped her.

258
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:44,875
Or perhaps...

259
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:45,931
Nisha!

260
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,274
Roshni is fine wherever she is.

261
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:00,056
Do you really know the person...

262
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:01,148
you live with?

263
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,092
Do you really know the person...

264
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,149
whom you love?

265
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:06,729
Do you really know the person...

266
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:09,557
with whom you share your life?

267
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:19,531
Hello...

268
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:21,306
Wear something nice...

269
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,013
we have to attend
a party tonight.

270
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:25,574
Where?

271
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:26,638
You'll know.

272
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,739
And...

273
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:30,080
Leave your hair open.

274
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:33,113
I like it that way.

275
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:35,581
Okay.

276
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:39,694
Tell Sheena...

277
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,156
you won't be coming
home for a few days.

278
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,606
These works have
never been exhibited.

279
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:53,700
I urge you to enjoy them,
we may never get another chance.

280
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:55,540
Vikram...

281
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:57,804
welcome...

282
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:01,609
Good to see you.

283
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,279
This is DK, my boss.

284
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:06,645
This is Nisha.

285
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:08,787
Correct... correct...

286
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:09,655
Hi.

287
00:34:09,727 --> 00:34:12,355
Hi, welcome to our
colorful world.

288
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:14,359
By the way, buddy...

289
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:18,364
I'm happy that an international
agency wants to sign you on.

290
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:20,792
Yeah, man.

291
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,263
Thanks.
- Very good.

292
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:23,362
Congratulations.

293
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:25,901
So when are you
leaving forthe shoot?

294
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:26,838
Soon.

295
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,377
I'll know the exact
date in a week.

296
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:31,110
Vikram, afterthat you will...

297
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,938
Yeah, man.

298
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:13,615
Why did the lights go off?

299
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:17,350
Don't be scared.

300
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:23,386
When lightning strikes,
the electricity goes off.

301
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:28,664
And its back.

302
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,085
Hi... good morning.

303
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,532
Why are you doing this?

304
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:06,191
To make me jealous?

305
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:07,526
Please, Kabir.

306
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,867
It's been years
since college...

307
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:12,198
but you're still stuck there.

308
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,673
We were never in a relationship...

309
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,003
we aren't in one,
norwill we ever be.

310
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:22,912
If you are hinting at the future,
here's some advice.

311
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:25,014
Stay away from Vikram.

312
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:27,980
It's basic procedure to
look for Roshni.

313
00:37:29,092 --> 00:37:31,083
But if something's
happened to her...

314
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,523
we think Vikram is responsible.
He is the prime suspect.

315
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,121
No, he's innocent.

316
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,558
He could never do that.

317
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,829
You just want to give
him a hard time.

318
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,036
Here's some advice for you.

319
00:37:42,673 --> 00:37:44,732
Investigate thoroughly.

320
00:37:44,975 --> 00:37:45,964
Damn sure I will.

321
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:50,105
But I can see the
effect his wealth...

322
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,011
and glamour have had on you.

323
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:57,553
Anyway, an honest
cop doesn't earn much.

324
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:00,784
You are jealous, Kabir.

325
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:03,658
Yes, I'm drawn to Vikram's
wealth and glamour.

326
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,183
Happy?

327
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:10,922
Take care.

328
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:09,901
Hello?

329
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:13,705
Who is it?

330
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:16,408
Who is it?

331
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:57,248
Vikram...

332
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,661
is that you?

333
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:32,450
Hello?

334
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:39,657
Who is it?

335
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:46,865
Here...

336
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:54,114
in 20 minutes you
will be alright.

337
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,018
But nothing seems alright.

338
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:02,119
I mean, in this house...

339
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,518
There are strange sounds
coming from the bathroom.

340
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,130
The electricity keeps going off.

341
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:13,429
I'm afraid to live here all alone.

342
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:17,531
I think...

343
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:21,140
there's someone in this house.

344
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:23,938
Of course, there is...

345
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:25,607
you and me.

346
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:28,640
Apart from us...

347
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:33,680
Well, we have a gardener.

348
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:35,446
No...

349
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:38,491
there's someone else.

350
00:43:41,231 --> 00:43:42,220
Really?

351
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:44,856
Who?

352
00:43:46,703 --> 00:43:47,692
I think...

353
00:43:49,706 --> 00:43:51,037
a ghost.

354
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,884
Where is this ghost?

355
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:04,045
I'm serious, Vikram!

356
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,581
Here.

357
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:11,950
Yes, Vikram...

358
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:13,686
this is where I heard the sounds.

359
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:15,122
Muffled... choked...

360
00:44:26,676 --> 00:44:30,168
I can hear some strange sound...

361
00:44:33,483 --> 00:44:34,575
probably the wind.

362
00:44:34,784 --> 00:44:36,775
Has to be the plumbing...

363
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,610
No, Vikram.

364
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:40,482
It's not the plumbing.

365
00:44:40,824 --> 00:44:41,984
It's not the wind, either.

366
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:44,188
I am certain its a ghost.

367
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,050
Okay.

368
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:54,892
Hello!

369
00:44:55,472 --> 00:44:57,599
If the ghost is male,
'Be gone, ghoul'.

370
00:44:57,674 --> 00:44:59,835
And if female, 'Go away, banshee'.

371
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,707
If you evertrouble my
Nisha again, I will kill you.

372
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:09,175
I mean, make you alive again!

373
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:11,075
Okay?

374
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:12,915
It's not funny, Vikram.

375
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:15,453
I am serious,
there is a ghost.

376
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:18,158
There's only one ghost here.

377
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:20,485
Me!

378
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:23,554
Help me.

379
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:24,927
I hate you.

380
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:26,124
Really?

381
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:26,967
Yes.

382
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:28,004
You think so?

383
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:29,060
Yes.

384
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:38,405
Vikram...

385
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:39,637
Yes?

386
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:41,146
I feel those eyes are
staring at me.

387
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:47,812
Put it away.

388
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:49,881
Please.

389
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:00,970
It's done.

390
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,310
Where is it?
- There.

391
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:15,873
Sir!

392
00:46:17,253 --> 00:46:18,242
Sir!

393
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:20,445
What happened?

394
00:46:20,757 --> 00:46:23,089
Sir, I don't think it was an
accident. The carwas set on fire.

395
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:38,896
Hello?

396
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:40,832
Speaking...

397
00:46:58,762 --> 00:46:59,751
I'll be there.

398
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,188
What's the matter?

399
00:47:05,368 --> 00:47:06,357
Who called?

400
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:15,138
The cops found the
body of a girl and...

401
00:47:17,347 --> 00:47:20,009
they think it might be Roshni.

402
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,539
What?

403
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,150
I have been called to
identify the body.

404
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,189
See you.

405
00:48:07,897 --> 00:48:09,558
How can she be Roshni?

406
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:14,025
EExcuse me?

407
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:17,662
That's not Roshni.

408
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,176
Why don't you take
a good look.

409
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:23,976
I took a good look.

410
00:48:25,348 --> 00:48:26,645
That's not Roshni.

411
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,260
What appears hidden...

412
00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:48,397
is easily visible.

413
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:54,067
I am sorry.

414
00:48:59,816 --> 00:49:00,942
With whom were you talking?

415
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:02,273
Nobody.

416
00:49:04,954 --> 00:49:05,943
What happened...

417
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:08,246
the body?

418
00:49:10,193 --> 00:49:11,387
That wasn't Roshni.

419
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:16,389
Are you alright?

420
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:20,758
Nisha...

421
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:26,299
only you matterto me now.

422
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:30,111
Roshni is no longer
a part of my life...

423
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,671
not even as a memory.

424
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:37,084
Roshni doesn't exist for me.

425
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:49,387
I Love you.

426
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,099
Vikram, we're getting late.

427
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:11,265
Vikram...

428
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,508
What are you doing
in here for so long?

429
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,344
You think only girls can
take hours to get dressed?

430
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,343
Why don't you get
CCTVforthe house?

431
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:22,718
That way you'll know
what I'm doing.

432
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,748
I'll think about it.

433
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:27,691
But now we're late for your party.

434
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,081
Come on.

435
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,449
Come on.

436
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:34,692
There's magic...

437
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,760
in Vikram's eyes.

438
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:37,990
Really?

439
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,195
In just a few months...

440
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:43,032
Vikram has captivated
all my clients.

441
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:44,435
That's great.

442
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:48,000
Actually, I knew that...

443
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,206
Vikram is talented
and he is capable of great things.

444
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:52,181
And apart from clients...

445
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,543
even I want Vikram.

446
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:55,584
At least some time.

447
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:56,745
Correct... correct...

448
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:58,349
By the way, where is Mr. Busy?

449
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,390
Probably accepting
some compliment...

450
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:02,152
or giving an autograph...

451
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,090
I betterfind him.

452
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:04,150
Yes.

453
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,419
I'll take an autograph too.

454
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:08,988
I'll see you soon.

455
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,156
See you.

456
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:34,181
Vikram, what are you doing here?

457
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:36,316
Shouldn't you be in there?

458
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,119
I was saying 'bye' to Naomi.

459
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,451
Remember, Naomi?

460
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:45,302
Some faces you neverforget.

461
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:47,827
Right.

462
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:51,432
I like your styling.

463
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:52,698
Thank you.

464
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:54,873
See you later.
- See you.

465
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,101
Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:02,341
Watch it.

467
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,384
I didn't know you were
such a good photographer.

468
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,354
EExcuse me...

469
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,186
are you trying to flirt with me?

470
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,655
Are you trying to pick me up?

471
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,862
I won't deny it...
maybe I am...

472
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,333
But am I the only one
you're flirting with?

473
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:28,903
Apart from you,
who else is there in this world?

474
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,136
I don't know...

475
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:32,708
there can be somebody.

476
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:34,874
What?

477
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,809
I am kidding!

478
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,553
I know, I'm the only
one for you.

479
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,285
EEvery time I see a beautiful
house like this...

480
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,758
I wonder if I really
am an architect.

481
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,633
The staircase design
is just stunning.

482
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:53,898
Thank you.

483
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:56,732
You liked my mother's design.

484
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:02,875
She designed this house
especially for my father.

485
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:06,674
He was a General in the
British Army in the 1940's.

486
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:07,940
Wow!

487
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:10,852
But it's you who
deserve all the credit.

488
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,956
You've maintained
the house so well.

489
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,649
It's really beautiful.

490
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,420
Unfortunately I can't
do it anymore.

491
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,525
Old age, you know.

492
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:26,235
That's why I've wanted to sell it.

493
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,298
And move to London to
be with my daughter.

494
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:33,309
I didn't meet anyone who I thought
would take care of this house.

495
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:34,944
Selling this house has been tough.

496
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:36,941
Thank god you came along.

497
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:43,879
I will get Vikram to sign
these documents today itself.

498
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,511
God bless you.

499
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,179
Thank you.

500
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,954
Roshni, you really are
a bright ray of life.

501
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,595
Oh thank you, so sweet, DK.

502
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:54,753
Thank you.

503
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:56,799
I need Vikram to sign
some documents...

504
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:57,993
where is he?

505
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,465
The photo shoot got over
a few minutes ago...

506
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,697
he's probably in the trailer.

507
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,932
Let's check.
- Okay.

508
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,438
You can have him all to yourself.

509
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:12,542
Guess I disturbed you.

510
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:16,513
Guess I disturbed you.

511
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:18,711
You seem busy.

512
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:19,778
No.

513
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:21,513
Sorry...

514
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,614
finish yourwork.

515
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:23,882
But...

516
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:25,818
Bye.

517
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,993
I think that's your bag,
don't forget.

518
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,889
Thanks.

519
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,036
We were merely talking.

520
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:37,466
Correct... correct...

521
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,736
Did I say you weren't
'merely talking'?

522
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:50,843
Come on!

523
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:52,988
Naomi got a bottle of
wine from Goa and...

524
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,046
I'm not a fool.

525
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,488
I've seen you with her before.

526
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:57,926
So?

527
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,987
As one woman to another,
I can read her mind.

528
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,590
What do you mean?

529
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,360
I can bear yourfaults...

530
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:07,860
not your lies.

531
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,532
I may not be perfect...

532
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,603
but you know I'm
ready to do anything.

533
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,742
If we don't have trust in our
relationship, then what do we have?

534
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,005
Oh please!

535
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,051
EEverything is perfect.

536
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,849
EEverything is not perfect.

537
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,392
It seems you're leading
another life and...

538
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,058
I don't belong in it.

539
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,693
That scares me.

540
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:38,761
I feel abandoned.

541
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:46,832
Hello, Vikram sir?

542
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,034
Yes.

543
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:49,773
I'm calling from the resort.

544
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,471
You had booked a surprise holiday
for you and Ms. Roshni.

545
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:53,876
Should we confirm it?

546
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:57,387
No.

547
00:55:57,788 --> 00:56:00,382
Right now she's not interested
in the holiday.

548
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:01,753
Please cancel it...

549
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,354
No, don't cancel it.

550
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:04,989
Confirm it, we'll be there.

551
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,154
Okay ma'am.

552
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:07,986
Thank you.

553
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,188
Are the designs ready
forthe presentation?

554
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:36,421
Almost.

555
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,061
Met the contractor?

556
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,624
Not yet.

557
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,465
See you this evening.

558
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:42,794
Vikram...

559
01:00:43,574 --> 01:00:45,701
Is Naomi only your stylist
or something more?

560
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:48,135
What?

561
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,612
Do you have to be available
for her all the time?

562
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,941
She got worried that
you didn't answer and...

563
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,086
has sent a dozen text messages.

564
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,581
You checked my text messages?

565
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,917
I asked you a question first.

566
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:04,784
People send work related
text messages too.

567
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,795
'Where are you? '
'What are you doing? '...

568
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:10,500
'Had lunch? ', 'I'm missing you.'
Work related messages, huh?

569
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,134
Can't friends send those?

570
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,191
Please!

571
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:20,804
Afew days ago, I suggested setting
up CCTV cameras as a joke.

572
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,070
Now is a good time
to really do it.

573
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,743
We just work together...

574
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,041
trust me.

575
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,458
I do and that's why
I am still with you.

576
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:41,760
The day I realize there's
someone else...

577
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,100
I will break up with you.

578
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:45,991
You will be responsible for it.

579
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:48,469
You know me well...

580
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:50,697
I follow through
with what I say.

581
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:51,967
I wont listen to anyone.

582
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,973
Vikram, it will break my heart
but I will do it.

583
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:03,609
Nothing is going on.

584
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:10,149
You should go or you'll be late.

585
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,391
You look upset about something.

586
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:52,866
What's the matter, Roshni?

587
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:54,361
You can talk to me.

588
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:57,496
Perhaps I can help you.

589
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:01,743
Mrs. Fields,
I love Vikram very much.

590
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,942
And he loves me too.

591
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:08,440
But...

592
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:13,054
he is different from
who he was in South Africa.

593
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,526
How do I explain?

594
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:19,792
Take yourtime...

595
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
tell me.

596
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:22,824
I can help you.

597
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,368
I feel...

598
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:29,538
Mumbai and the fashion
industry have changed him.

599
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:31,500
Or is changing him.

600
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:38,071
He only asked me once and
I quit everything to follow him.

601
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,381
Now it seems his work is
tearing us apart.

602
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,490
It seems he is slipping away.

603
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:00,828
Work stress is to blame.

604
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:05,599
People these days believe
work is most important.

605
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:08,703
I know what you're feeling.

606
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:11,875
That's what I'm afraid of.

607
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:18,144
I mean, does Vikram even
understand what I'm feeling.

608
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:22,454
What do I mean to him?

609
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,091
That's what I don't know.

610
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,930
If I went away or died...

611
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,092
what would he do?

612
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,095
I know it sounds strange...

613
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:39,606
but I wish there was some
way to find out.

614
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:41,942
There is a way.

615
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:49,943
If you wish, you can test
Vikram's love for you.

616
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,110
Test?
How?

617
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,814
Come with me.

618
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:57,926
After India gained independence...

619
01:04:57,995 --> 01:04:59,758
my mother didn't want to
return to EEngland...

620
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,594
and my father couldn't live
without her.

621
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:22,111
Some EEnglish officers were killed
and my parents thought that...

622
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:28,118
the freedom fighters would
attack them and theirfamilies.

623
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:29,521
And so...

624
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,494
they built this bomb
proof secret room...

625
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:35,730
to hide with theirfamilies
in case of an emergency.

626
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,889
Come in.

627
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:56,276
You can look into the bathroom
and the bedroom from in here.

628
01:05:57,988 --> 01:06:01,048
Nothing can be seen from outside.

629
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,262
One way reinforced glass.

630
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,724
Like the ones used in
air conditioned train compartments.

631
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:15,068
These speakers help you
hearthe outside world.

632
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:20,333
You can hear every word
from anywhere in the house.

633
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:24,875
But no sound can
escape this room.

634
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,277
This is the electricity
connection...

635
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:33,681
it still works.

636
01:06:34,558 --> 01:06:38,187
This way,
you can stay out of sight...

637
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:40,126
and yet keep an eye on him.

638
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,220
Good luck.

639
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,267
Take care.

640
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,729
Thank you for sharing
this secret with me.

641
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:50,229
You take care in London.

642
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:51,666
Take care, Roshni.

643
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:53,600
You too Mrs. Fields

644
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:56,676
Bye.
- Bye.

645
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:49,754
Vikram...

646
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,597
I met someone in the gym.

647
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:56,066
And he is really hot.

648
01:08:01,044 --> 01:08:02,033
No...

649
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,156
Vikram, I am mad at you...

650
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:25,999
It should seem real.

651
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,800
Tears... sad face...

652
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:36,734
Okay.

653
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,112
Vikram, it's not
easy for me to say this.

654
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,877
So, please listen to me carefully.

655
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,990
We can't be together because...

656
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:51,724
I don't understand
you anymore.

657
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:56,723
I tried to console myself
but it's impossible.

658
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,125
I am leaving you.

659
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,095
I chose to record this
message because...

660
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:04,096
I don't want to talk to you.

661
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:07,073
No discussion...
no arguments.

662
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:10,671
I suggest you forget me.

663
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,180
And don't try to look for me.

664
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,474
Bye...

665
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:18,643
take care.

666
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:51,970
Roshni...

667
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:54,378
Roshni...

668
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:55,713
Keep looking.

669
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,224
White orchids.

670
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:06,885
I'm impressed.

671
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:13,966
Pick it up...

672
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:15,968
Pick it up...

673
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:24,302
Come on.

674
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:17,455
Damn.

675
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:24,766
Roshni, I saw the video.

676
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,535
What is this silliness?

677
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,332
Why?

678
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:29,770
Call me please.

679
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,051
Roshni...

680
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:48,986
where are you?

681
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,797
Is this some kind of a joke?

682
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:54,535
It's not a joke, it's a test.

683
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,735
And I think you will clear it.

684
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:50,884
Okay... I was wrong!

685
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:52,252
You have cleared it.

686
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,155
Vikram...

687
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,371
Vikram...

688
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:38,683
Vikram...

689
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:39,817
Vikram...

690
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:57,776
I am sorry, Vikram.

691
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:01,505
I am sorry...

692
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:03,645
I love you.

693
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,421
Please help me!

694
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:10,049
Please!

695
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,125
Please help me!

696
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:26,964
Please!

697
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,019
And don't try to look for me.

698
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,013
Bye.

699
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:48,620
It's unfortunate that the
last time you saw her...

700
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:51,089
was on 14th February...
Valentine's day.

701
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:52,990
Yeah.

702
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:57,472
If you don't mind, there's
something I want to say.

703
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:01,741
She is an educated adult.

704
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:03,935
And since she has left of
her own free will...

705
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,777
what can the cops do?

706
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:12,353
I think something is not right.

707
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:15,784
You mean to say
something is wrong.

708
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:18,753
Do you suspect anyone?

709
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:20,551
No...

710
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:24,764
in fact Roshni didn't
have many contacts.

711
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:27,868
You know Roshni, don't you?

712
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,002
By the way,
what's your name?

713
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,804
DK...
DK Bose.

714
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:37,639
DK Bose?

715
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:40,942
Sounds very familiar.

716
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:44,650
Well, a song by that name
was very popular.

717
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:46,510
Of course!

718
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:49,983
That's right.

719
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,428
Songs have such weird
names and lyrics these days.

720
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:58,933
When was the last time
you met Roshni?

721
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:01,465
Afew days ago,
when she dropped by the set.

722
01:19:02,705 --> 01:19:04,900
Vikram, why don't you tell him?

723
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,536
Are you keeping something
from us?

724
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,101
No...

725
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:13,172
it's not important.

726
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:14,776
EEverything is important.

727
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:15,815
It's nothing big but...

728
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:22,154
Roshni saw Vikram having a drink
with Naomi in the trailer.

729
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:23,722
And she was upset about it.

730
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:24,987
That is not important.

731
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,157
What's important is,
where is Roshni right now?

732
01:19:27,497 --> 01:19:29,931
Herfamily and friends
haven't heard from her.

733
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:32,396
I don't think she has
been kidnapped.

734
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:38,840
Nonetheless, we will check the
major exit points from the city.

735
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:39,997
Thank you, sir.

736
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:41,735
There's one more thing.

737
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:44,675
Often in such situations...

738
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:47,609
the person lodging the
complaint is the first suspect.

739
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,189
You may do as you please.

740
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:57,024
But don't waste time,
find Roshni, please.

741
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:34,588
The room was built to
hide from freedom fighters.

742
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:38,826
But my fate brought me here.

743
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,277
No discussion...
no arguments.

744
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:02,484
I suggest you forget me.

745
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:20,759
All the best.

746
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:22,893
Vikram...

747
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:24,938
Why did you say, 'all the best'?

748
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:27,798
Vikram...

749
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,370
Why did you say that?

750
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,704
Vikram...

751
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:32,770
why?

752
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:34,414
Vikram why?

753
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:38,481
Vikram, look at the water.

754
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:41,387
Vikram, look at the water.

755
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:47,292
Please...

756
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,961
Please, look at the water.

757
01:22:58,574 --> 01:22:59,563
Vikram...

758
01:23:00,443 --> 01:23:01,910
Vikram, look at the water.

759
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,300
Vikram...

760
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:04,636
Vikram...

761
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,507
Vikram...

762
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:08,780
Vikram, look at the water.

763
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:13,285
Vikram...

764
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,818
Stupid test!

765
01:23:54,964 --> 01:23:56,556
God, please help me.

766
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:14,138
No... No...

767
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:16,979
This can't be happening.

768
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:19,176
Please...

769
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:21,948
Please... come on!

770
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:02,686
Who are you?

771
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,092
Vikram.

772
01:25:12,675 --> 01:25:13,664
No...

773
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:20,743
No... Please... No...

774
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:22,372
Vikram...

775
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:30,752
No...

776
01:25:32,862 --> 01:25:34,056
No, please...

777
01:25:37,099 --> 01:25:38,088
No...

778
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,197
Stop!

779
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:54,671
No...

780
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:56,742
Please don't do this...

781
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:57,680
No...

782
01:25:57,753 --> 01:25:58,412
Stop!

783
01:25:58,487 --> 01:25:59,476
Please!

784
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,601
Please!

785
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:35,251
Stop!

786
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,189
Stop it.

787
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,060
Stop it.

788
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:48,633
Please, stop it.

789
01:26:49,004 --> 01:26:50,631
Stop it.

790
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:54,064
Please...

791
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:41,521
How did you land here to
twist our story?

792
01:27:45,194 --> 01:27:47,719
How can you look at yourself
afterwhat you have done!

793
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:57,762
Of all the men...
you got Vikram.

794
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:03,243
That's my toothbrush.

795
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:04,568
Keep it back.

796
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,278
Keep it back or I'll smash
yourteeth.

797
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:07,604
Witch!

798
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,120
Witch!

799
01:28:15,224 --> 01:28:16,213
You can hear me?

800
01:28:17,926 --> 01:28:18,915
Help me...

801
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:20,287
help me, please.

802
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,119
Please help me.

803
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,964
What's wrong?

804
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:26,907
Bad scald, huh?

805
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:29,142
So sad.

806
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:33,914
I had no other choice.

807
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:39,453
Nisha...

808
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:46,466
Nisha...

809
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,366
Nisha...

810
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:04,774
Damn!

811
01:32:13,095 --> 01:32:14,756
Why are you jumping like a child...

812
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,052
on my bed?

813
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,296
Since you and Vikram didn't break it
last night, you want to break it now?

814
01:32:22,971 --> 01:32:26,304
If you continue to jump,
your pea-sized brain will fall out.

815
01:32:33,148 --> 01:32:34,172
My bed...

816
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:41,286
that's where the key fell.

817
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:46,082
Nisha, think...

818
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:49,421
Think where the
keyhole could be.

819
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:53,161
That's not a necklace, it's a key.

820
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:57,131
Don't pose, you look like an idiot.

821
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:59,300
Nisha!

822
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:03,266
Hello?

823
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,144
Who is it?

824
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:07,203
Nisha, don't go.

825
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:10,450
Please don't go.

826
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,309
Nisha, please!

827
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:15,786
Here.

828
01:33:15,857 --> 01:33:16,846
Here?

829
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,081
Yes...

830
01:33:18,527 --> 01:33:20,051
this is where I heard the sounds.

831
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:21,728
Muffled...
choked...

832
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:28,927
Vikram, I am in here.
Please help me.

833
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:31,238
Vikram, please!
- And if female, 'Go away, banshee'.

834
01:33:31,306 --> 01:33:34,537
If you evertrouble my Nisha
again, I will kill you.

835
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:36,872
I mean, make you alive again!

836
01:33:37,346 --> 01:33:38,335
Okay?

837
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:42,207
The banshee is next to you.

838
01:33:46,154 --> 01:33:47,519
Help me...

839
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:49,921
Vikram...

840
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:50,980
Yes?

841
01:33:51,193 --> 01:33:52,785
I feel those eyes
are staring at me.

842
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:55,118
Put it away.

843
01:33:56,231 --> 01:33:57,220
Please.

844
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,128
It's done.

845
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:08,435
I hope I can take a
good look at you now.

846
01:34:09,411 --> 01:34:11,003
What is there left to look at?

847
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:47,747
What's the matter, Vikram?

848
01:34:48,784 --> 01:34:49,773
Who called?

849
01:34:57,793 --> 01:34:59,693
The cops found the body
of a girl and...

850
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,857
they think it might be Roshni.

851
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:06,890
What?

852
01:35:08,437 --> 01:35:12,203
I have been called to
identify the body.

853
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,703
See you.

854
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:28,483
Stop dreaming.

855
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,380
I'm alive...

856
01:35:30,525 --> 01:35:32,322
and I'm not going
to die any time soon.

857
01:36:27,415 --> 01:36:28,404
Start.

858
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,082
You're not the idiot...

859
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,881
I thought you were.

860
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:37,981
Stop.

861
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:40,884
Yes.

862
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,128
No, no...

863
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:51,394
Wait.

864
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:17,387
Start.

865
01:37:22,938 --> 01:37:23,927
Stop.

866
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:28,898
Is someone there?

867
01:37:29,411 --> 01:37:31,038
Yes.

868
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:35,538
Vikram...

869
01:37:36,785 --> 01:37:37,774
is that you?

870
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,083
You know I don't like
these pranks.

871
01:37:48,263 --> 01:37:49,252
Who is it?

872
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:55,094
Grandpa?
Grandma?

873
01:37:57,572 --> 01:37:58,561
Dad?

874
01:38:00,442 --> 01:38:02,808
Grandpa? Grandma?

875
01:38:15,757 --> 01:38:16,746
Roshni?

876
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:17,947
Yes.

877
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:21,153
Roshni, is it you?

878
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,158
Are you dead?

879
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,767
You wish.

880
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:31,394
I am alive.

881
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:33,973
Keep asking questions.

882
01:38:34,509 --> 01:38:36,500
The more you ask,
the more you will know.

883
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:38,768
Think.

884
01:38:40,382 --> 01:38:41,371
So you're alive?

885
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:46,346
Very good, Nisha.

886
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:47,954
Are you trapped?

887
01:38:49,858 --> 01:38:50,847
Trapped and how!

888
01:38:51,326 --> 01:38:52,793
Very badly.

889
01:39:01,069 --> 01:39:04,869
Has Vikram locked
you up?

890
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:07,930
No...

891
01:39:08,143 --> 01:39:09,940
my bad fate has locked me up here.

892
01:39:14,182 --> 01:39:18,312
Can you see me?

893
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:19,976
Yes.

894
01:39:26,361 --> 01:39:30,627
Are you behind this mirror?

895
01:39:31,433 --> 01:39:33,060
Now you're talking!

896
01:39:34,002 --> 01:39:35,060
Very good, Nisha.

897
01:40:14,642 --> 01:40:16,337
The mirror in the
bedroom is a door?

898
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:17,400
Yes.

899
01:40:17,946 --> 01:40:18,935
Amazing, Nisha.

900
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:48,197
Yes.

901
01:40:48,276 --> 01:40:49,903
Think where the key
hole could be.

902
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:55,071
Come on...

903
01:40:56,017 --> 01:40:57,006
Yes...

904
01:41:02,157 --> 01:41:03,454
The key hole is right there.

905
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:05,158
Behind...

906
01:41:16,704 --> 01:41:17,693
Yes...

907
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:32,408
Yes...

908
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:02,839
Nisha...

909
01:42:04,586 --> 01:42:06,213
Nisha, what's going on?

910
01:42:14,762 --> 01:42:15,751
Nisha!

911
01:42:24,272 --> 01:42:24,931
Nisha!

912
01:42:25,006 --> 01:42:26,633
What are you doing?
Open the door!

913
01:42:27,675 --> 01:42:28,664
Nisha, come on.

914
01:42:29,944 --> 01:42:30,933
I am sorry.

915
01:42:50,398 --> 01:42:52,059
You conniving witch!

916
01:42:55,003 --> 01:42:57,130
Witch...

917
01:43:00,775 --> 01:43:02,037
With whom were you talking?

918
01:43:02,243 --> 01:43:03,232
Nobody.

919
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:05,001
What happened...

920
01:43:05,346 --> 01:43:06,335
the body?

921
01:43:07,982 --> 01:43:09,210
That wasn't Roshni.

922
01:43:14,389 --> 01:43:15,413
Are you alright?

923
01:43:18,927 --> 01:43:19,916
Nisha...

924
01:43:21,996 --> 01:43:25,295
only you matterto me now.

925
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:28,961
Roshni is no longer
a part of my life...

926
01:43:29,437 --> 01:43:30,836
not even as a memory.

927
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:34,708
Roshni doesn't exist for me.

928
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:47,881
I love you.

929
01:43:57,699 --> 01:44:00,463
Don't leave me in here...

930
01:44:01,836 --> 01:44:03,701
Don't leave me in here...

931
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:33,756
What's wrong?

932
01:44:34,435 --> 01:44:36,062
You're drinking on duty.

933
01:44:37,338 --> 01:44:40,967
Is something troubling you?

934
01:44:42,043 --> 01:44:43,032
No...

935
01:44:44,946 --> 01:44:46,277
nothing could trouble me.

936
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,841
Of course not.

937
01:44:51,352 --> 01:44:56,790
EEspecially since you found yourself
a rich and famous boyfriend.

938
01:44:59,427 --> 01:45:00,951
But I do hope that...

939
01:45:01,829 --> 01:45:03,956
his ex-girlfriend doesn't show up.

940
01:45:04,932 --> 01:45:05,990
If she comes back...

941
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:10,168
your love story
will get complicated.

942
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:53,674
Your game is up, Vikram.

943
01:45:53,915 --> 01:45:55,212
Inspector Kamble
has been transferred.

944
01:45:55,283 --> 01:45:57,308
Unfortunately for you,
fortunately for me.

945
01:45:57,418 --> 01:45:58,180
Now your case...

946
01:45:58,252 --> 01:45:59,241
I mean...

947
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:02,254
Roshni Verma's case is under
my command.

948
01:46:02,457 --> 01:46:03,947
I'm the investigating officer.

949
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,451
Oh good.

950
01:46:07,462 --> 01:46:08,690
What's the progress?

951
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,295
Have you got any leads?

952
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:11,789
I'm sure we will.

953
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,931
A criminal can never
out-smart the law.

954
01:46:19,674 --> 01:46:20,663
All the best.

955
01:46:25,813 --> 01:46:26,802
Vikram...

956
01:46:27,782 --> 01:46:30,910
think before you
take any step.

957
01:46:33,154 --> 01:46:34,121
What do you mean?

958
01:46:34,188 --> 01:46:36,452
The fact is I'm not
worried about Roshni.

959
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:39,292
It's Nisha I'm worried about.

960
01:46:40,361 --> 01:46:41,885
If anything happens to her...

961
01:46:42,263 --> 01:46:43,457
If you hurt her...

962
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:45,956
I will not investigate.

963
01:46:47,201 --> 01:46:48,327
I will kill you.

964
01:46:49,504 --> 01:46:50,493
I will kill you.

965
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:52,201
Got it?

966
01:46:52,273 --> 01:46:54,070
I'm not in the mood
to reply to that.

967
01:46:58,913 --> 01:46:59,902
Hi...

968
01:47:00,114 --> 01:47:01,172
Where's my stuff?

969
01:47:01,883 --> 01:47:04,249
Vikram, I moved
everything in here.

970
01:47:04,385 --> 01:47:05,374
Why?

971
01:47:06,254 --> 01:47:10,213
There are no plumbing problems
in this bathroom.

972
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:14,020
And the view from this
room is much better.

973
01:47:15,363 --> 01:47:17,092
Don't you like it?

974
01:47:18,866 --> 01:47:22,324
In the future, I'd like you to tell
me before you take such decisions.

975
01:47:27,175 --> 01:47:28,506
I wanted to surprise you.

976
01:47:30,411 --> 01:47:32,140
I don't like surprises.

977
01:47:57,171 --> 01:47:59,071
If you are here to see Vikram,
he's not home.

978
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:00,901
He's at the studio.

979
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:09,082
A rich lover has gifted his
new girlfriend an old key.

980
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:12,745
Or is it the key to a treasure?

981
01:48:12,853 --> 01:48:14,150
It's none of your business.

982
01:48:14,422 --> 01:48:15,411
You may leave.

983
01:48:20,027 --> 01:48:22,928
People don't behave in this manner,
not even with strangers at their door.

984
01:48:25,266 --> 01:48:27,131
The funny thing about time is...

985
01:48:28,269 --> 01:48:30,100
that it always keeps changing.

986
01:48:30,705 --> 01:48:32,070
Listen...
- You listen to me.

987
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:36,440
I hope you like my gift.

988
01:48:42,483 --> 01:48:43,916
Thanks forthe insult.

989
01:50:57,351 --> 01:50:58,340
Roshni...

990
01:51:07,728 --> 01:51:08,717
Roshni...

991
01:52:51,365 --> 01:52:53,196
Sir, some has given
packet for you.

992
01:54:07,942 --> 01:54:09,273
Where is Nisha?

993
01:54:11,312 --> 01:54:12,745
Where is Nisha?
