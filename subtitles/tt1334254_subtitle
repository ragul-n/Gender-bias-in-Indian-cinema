Yes, look there.

00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:51,063
Take him out.

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,197
Open it. Open it.

12
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,215
Whiskey is very good
for your wounds.

13
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:46,307
The deeper the wound,
more the whiskey.

14
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:54,644
Come on!

15
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:10,655
What happened to you? You left
the party without informing me.

16
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,257
l heard you met with an accident.

17
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:13,860
And what happened here?

18
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:24,679
Are you ok?
- Yes, l'm fine. l'm fine.

The car's post-mortem has been done.

21
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,678
My post-mortem would also
have been done by now..

22
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:36,691
..if this man was not there.

23
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,696
Really!
- Absolutely escaped certain death.

24
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,703
You look very upset, Mallika.

25
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,836
You look very disappointed.

26
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:54,776
Please cut that crap.

27
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,704
Hey, why are you standing? Sit down.

36
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,226

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,828
Merchant.

40
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:02,776
Merchant, take care of my vehicle.

41
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:06,838
Make sure we don't get into
any police hassle. Please.

42
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:08,841
Thanks.

43
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,793
Sir, shall l go now?
l am getting late.

44
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:23,329
Where do you stay?
- At Dahisar.

45
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,798
Where will you go at
this hour at night?

46
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,530
You stay here tonight.

47
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:32,397
There's an outhouse on the left.

48
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:35,003
The keys are lying on the bar.
- Why?

49
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:42,215
Because l say so. That's why.

50
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,151
l don't want strangers to
stay over at my place.

51
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,347
Sir, l shall go now.

52
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:52,817
lf we take everything that
happened till now..

53
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:56,831
..into consideration, the
near ones might appear..

54
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:01,165
..more dangerous than the strangers.

55
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,301
Goodnight, Subhash.
- Goodnight, sir.

56
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:10,241
Let's meet tomorrow morning.

Listen..

00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:43,868
Get lost. Out!

59
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,611
Sir asked me to stay here.
- Forget what sir said.

60
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,148
And listen to what l am
telling you. Get lost.

61
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,083
At this time of night..

62
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,349
lt's a matter of just one night.

63
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,154
l will thank sir and leave
tomorrow morning.

64
00:11:58,227 --> 00:11:59,626
Morning? He's in drunken stupor.

65
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:01,886
He won't even recognize you
tomorrow morning. Got it?

66
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,497
How can he not recognize me!

67
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:06,895
l saved his life.

68
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,493
What? Life.

69
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,104
Did you really save
my husband's life?

70
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,904
You're asking me as if
l have committed some crime..

71
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:22,917
..by saving your husband's life.

72
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:29,115
What nonsense!
- Goodnight.

73
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,262
Good morning, madam. Good morning.

74
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,995
You? You're still here?

75
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,664
l was about to leave,
but sir stopped me.

76
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,929
He said.. Subhash, l am hiring you.
- What!

77
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:51,008
l make great coffee.
- l don't need your coffee.

78
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,679
Not for you, but l want to
make coffee for myself.

79
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,344
So if you don't mind, madam..

80
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,545
Stop calling me madam. You got it?
- Yes, madam.

00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,953
Sorry, madam.
- ldiot. - Sorry. Sorry.

82
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:03,082
Madam. Madam. Madam.

Madam.

84
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,697
Jai. Jai.

You gave him a job?

86
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,299
Yes!

87
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,571
What job, Jai?
- Driver's job.

88
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,045
You know very well that
we don't need a driver.

89
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,376
This is not some NGO
to help people out.

90
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,972
Ask him to find
a job somewhere else.

91
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,244
Give him the car's keys.

92
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:31,510
Madam.

93
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,046
Keys.

94
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:52,735
You?
- What did you think? l am dead?

95
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,066
Where were you all night?

96
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:59,206
Don't ask me, buddy.
- What happened?

97
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,341
Where are you going?
- l got a job.

98
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:05,285
Job? Where?
- He is the owner of a big bungalow.

99
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,079
He gave me a job.
- Bungalow?

100
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:10,558
No, in the municipality.
- l see.

101
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:13,620
From smalltime thefts
to cleaning the drains.

102
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:17,291
Not cleaning the drains.
The beach at Nariman Point..

103
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,027
Yes.
- That beach is running out of salt.

104
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:22,029
So l have to take out the
salt from the Juhu beach..

105
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,766
..and pour it there. - And what
if Juhu beach runs out of salt?

106
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,166
Then we have Madh lsland beach.

107
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,039
The government has the
permit till Dubai.

108
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:32,705
You don't worry. Your dal (pulses)
will never lack salt.

109
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:36,043
Where's my red shirt?
Yes, l gave it to the washerman.

110
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:37,176
Keep it with you. l will take
it from you later. - Ok, buddy.

111
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,311
Ok, bye.

112
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,054
Sir, your drink.

113
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,457
Thank you.

114
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:24,156
Let's go.

115
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,772
l had a saloon back in my village.

116
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,168
l am a barber.

117
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,171
lt caught fire.

118
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:43,175
My saloon, sir.

119
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:48,716
My saloon burnt in flames.
- Oh!

120
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,115
Very sorry to hear that.

121
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,652
Someone said.. go to Mumbai
and work in films.

122
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:03,127
What happened, sir?
- l am sorry, sorry.

123
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,130
What was your name again?
- Subhash.

124
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,543
l am not laughing at you but
l am laughing at the irony of life.

125
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:17,147
You know who l am?
- No, sir.

126
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,228
Please come, sir.

127
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,243
Come. Come.

128
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:54,246
Come. Come.

129
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,658
l'll make it, sir.
- Thank you.

130
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,335
Jai Singh Adenwala.

131
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:12,672
Jai Singh Adenwala.

132
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,869
You made all these films?

133
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,209
l used to pick people
from the street..

134
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,217
..and turn them into stars.

135
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:30,691
Jai Singh Adenwala, the star-maker.

136
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,221
The king of the movies.

137
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:40,232
And then one day a Mallika came..

138
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:43,760
..and the crown just..

139
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,906
Suresh, you can't even imagine..
- Subhash.

140
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,242
Subhash, you can't even imagine..

141
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:57,581
..what sort of days
this house has seen.

142
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,254
lt used to be crowded with
people all the times.

143
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:06,385
Stars, strugglers, journalists..

144
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:10,865
Politicians, industrialists..

145
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:15,259
And those financiers used to
stand at the street-corner..

146
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:17,271
..with suitcases filled with money..

147
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,274
Adenwala, please make a film for us.

148
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:22,276
Adenwala, make a film for us.

149
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:31,343
l would've made you a star
had you met me in the past.

150
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:37,281
You would've been on those posters.

151
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:43,558
Jai Singh Adenwala presents
Suresh Kumar. - Subhash, sir.

152
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:45,293
Subhash Kumar.

153
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,305
But your misfortune..

154
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:55,907
You know..

155
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:59,038
Subhash.
- Subhash.

156
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:04,313
There was a time when
l could have made you..

157
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:08,789
..the hero of my next movie
for saving my life.

158
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:17,332
But now Adenwala himself is about
to be closed in a tin box..

159
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:23,338
..like some movie clipping
and that tin box..

160
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:28,809
..will be transferred
to some dark godown.

161
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:35,344
Get me another. - Sir, if you
drink so much, your health..

162
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:43,017
Are you married?

163
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,355
No, sir.

164
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:51,963
You're a lucky man.

165
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:14,446
Yes.

166
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:16,582
Yes, coming, madam.

167
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:35,467
Have you seen me?

168
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,603
May l come in?
- Now come in.

169
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,876
Sir said that you didn't get any
payment since you came here.

170
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,422
The money's there on the bed.
Take it.

171
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,484
Take it.

172
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,954
You don't want it?
- No, no.

173
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:58,694
l want it. l want it.

174
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:05,429
Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Jai Singh!

175
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:08,165
Jai. Jai.
- What? - Jai, come here, fast.

176
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:09,705
What happened?
- Come here fast.

177
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:11,439
What's the matter?
Why are you shouting so much?

178
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,438
What are you doing here?
- Jai, don't ask him.

179
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,450
Ask me what it is. Look here.
He stole money..

180
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:18,110
..from my purse as soon as
he got a chance. - What!

181
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:21,053
O my God! lt's empty.
There is nothing in it.

182
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:22,988
But, madam, you said..
- Hey, you!

183
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:24,719
But, sir..
- Talk to me.

184
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,121
What is she saying?
- No, sir.

185
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,789
Madam must have had some
misunderstanding.

186
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:32,527
Search him. - What is she saying?
What's going on?

187
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,468
Sir, she.. - Listen, you do
such a thing in a house..

188
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:37,471
..where you got shelter?

189
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,073
l can't believe it but
l will have to search you. - Sir.

190
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:42,133
Search him.
- Listen to me, sir.

191
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,201
Check his pocket.
l have seen it personally.

192
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:47,744
What's in your pocket?
Show me what's there in your pocket.

193
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,743
Check it properly.
He stole it right in front of me.

194
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,013
Show me your pocket.

195
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,490
Check. Check all his pockets.

196
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:01,484
This one.
- Check properly.

197
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:03,555
What happened?

198
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:09,493
Did you get it?
- He has got nothing.

199
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:12,564
l am sorry.

200
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:20,242
Before accusing someone of stealing,
you should think twice.

201
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:22,574
Stupid woman.

202
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:28,782
l am not an ATM machine.

203
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,139
Jai.

204
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:56,545
Jai, where the heck are you?

205
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:00,945
Jai Singh, what have you done?

206
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:04,588
All my checks.. you ordered
stop-payment on all my checks?

207
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,024
You know how much it
harmed my reputation.

208
00:23:06,228 --> 00:23:09,288
Don't worry. You never had
a reputation to be harmed.

209
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:10,956
How dare you!

210
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,293
What do you want? What
am l going to do?

211
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,297
Hello! l said l will
send your payment.

212
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,774
Oh come on, Jai! Please
don't do this to me.

213
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:22,171
What explanation will
l give them all?

214
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:23,302
How will l return everyone's money?

215
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:25,307
You will say you don't
have any money.

216
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,172
Don't have money? What do you
mean 'don't have money'!

217
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:29,840
You don't have any money.
- You selfish creep!

218
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:32,315
You are always drunk.
You ruined my life.

219
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,578
You have ruined my life.

220
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,717
l ruined your life?
What was your life?

221
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:42,122
Cheap woman! You were wandering
on the streets..

222
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:45,257
And what's your status?
lf l was on the streets..

223
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,858
..you're on the streets.
On the road!

224
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:51,337
And who's the reason behind
that? You, my darling.

225
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:54,665
You should've married
a money making machine.

226
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,341
l'd have done that.
l'd have done that..

227
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:58,602
..if you hadn't married me
and wasted the best years..

228
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,739
..of my youth with your alcoholism.

229
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,008
l couldn't even become an actress..

230
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,142
..and that's because of you.
- But it's not too late, darling.

231
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,347
You can still play mother's roles.

232
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:09,213
No, you won't get that either.

233
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,749
You need at least something
to play a mother.

234
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,025
But you are a wooden statue.

235
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,090
And you?

236
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,634
You have strength to
indulge in any sin?

237
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:08,942
Please open the door.

238
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:12,676
Malli. Malli, open the door.

239
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,891
Please open the door.
l need my inhaler.

240
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:48,847
Oh my God!

241
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:51,457
Sir! Sir! Sir!

242
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:52,985
Sir!

243
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,140
You're okay, sir?

244
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,478
Okay.

245
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:28,488
Sir, how do you feel now?

246
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:30,496
Yes, much better, thank you.

247
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,494
And you take this.

248
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:38,305
You put it in my pocket that day.

249
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,967
Sorry, sir. lt was madam
who gave me this..

250
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:43,237
You need not tell me anything.

251
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:48,241
You need not tell me anything.
l know everything.

252
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,514
l know everything.

253
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:03,523
When l was..

254
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:11,405
When l was suffocating to death
l needed it desperately.

255
00:27:13,408 --> 00:27:15,535
That evil woman!

256
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:20,542
That Mallika threw it
out of the window.

257
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:26,542
But why, sir?
- Why? So that..

258
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:32,950
..l couldn't breathe
and die choking.

259
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,089
What does that mean?

260
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:41,427
lt means murder.
- Murder?

261
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,097
That evil woman wants to kill me.

262
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:49,441
But, sir, why would madam
do such a thing?

263
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:57,847
Because she knows that as
long as this drunkard..

264
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,856
..and broken man is alive
he's a burden on her..

265
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:08,453
..but if l die l'm worth 24 crores.
- 24 crores?

266
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,861
l didn't get it, sir.

267
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:16,869
Five years ago l insured my life..

268
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:20,271
..by a London-based
insurance company.

269
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,068
For 24 crore rupees.

270
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,345
And l gave her name
as the beneficiary.

271
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,142
You got it now?

272
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,884
But sir, l don't think
madam would think of..

273
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:36,924
..doing any such thing.
- Really?

274
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,618
What is this?

275
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:50,631
ln my life l came across many women.

276
00:28:52,507 --> 00:28:56,500
But this is the first woman
whom l fell in love with.

277
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:03,640
Love is a strange thing.

278
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,049
You never know when you fall
in love with someone.

279
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:14,461
Even God doesn't know it.

280
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:21,931
l was immersed in her love
and that evil lady..

281
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:25,336
..was in love with my money.

282
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:32,541
This is for you.

283
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:38,408
Your six months' salary in advance.

284
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:42,687
Sir. Thank you, sir, but..

285
00:29:43,024 --> 00:29:46,551
No ifs and buts, it's for you.
- But sir, the thing is that..

286
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:49,620
No, take it. Take it.
- No, sir, it is..

287
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:54,430
Take it for my sake. Please.
- lt's not been signed, sir.

288
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:02,442
l'm sorry. Sorry.

289
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:08,010
Take it.
- Thank you, sir.

290
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:12,709
And now l am going to my office.
- At this time?

291
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:15,386
Yes, l've some urgent work.
l need to finish it.

292
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,388
Okay, sir. l'll take the car out.
- No, there's no need for that.

293
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:22,995
There might be more whiskey
in my veins than blood..

294
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:25,589
..but when l decide
to do something..

295
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:30,662
..l do it.

296
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,404
Sir, be careful.
- No.

297
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:39,079
Subhash Sharma.

298
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:43,541
What happened?

299
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:46,753
There's a surprise for you.

300
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:55,752
Surprise? This check won't
bounce, will it?

301
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:46,674
Subhash, this..
- Yes, sir.

302
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:51,550
Give it to Mr. Merchant.
- Okay.

303
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,482
Careful. lt's very important.

304
00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:57,550
Okay. l'll give it to him right now.
- No, no, no.

305
00:31:57,692 --> 00:31:58,818
Not now. Not now. Not now.

306
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:03,697
Right now at this moment
l want you here.

307
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:08,827
Sit here. Sit here.

308
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,834
Mallika.

309
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:21,704
Mallika. Where are you?

310
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,379
What is it? Why are you shouting?

311
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:29,117
Come downstairs.
- l'm busy right now.

312
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:31,716
l said come downstairs.

313
00:32:43,204 --> 00:32:44,262
What?
- Sit down.

314
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,599
Sit down. l need to talk to you.

315
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:50,207
Then what is he doing here?

316
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:55,744
l called him.
- What nonsense!

317
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:57,874
Shut up and sit down.

318
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,683
Thank you.

319
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:17,434
l need to tell you about a very
important decision of mine.

320
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:19,767
So listen to me carefully.

321
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:23,635
And you too.

322
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:27,907
Subhash, you know about my
insurance policy, right?

323
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:31,651
Yes, sir.
- l told you about it.

324
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:37,183
But for your information,
my darling..

325
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:41,388
..l made some changes
in that policy.

326
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,199
Like if l commit suicide
the insurance company..

327
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:52,934
..will not have to pay
even a single rupee.

328
00:33:54,942 --> 00:34:00,209
ln other words, my darling,
if l commit suicide..

329
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:06,481
..you won't get even a single rupee.

330
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:12,283
Lovely thought.

331
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:19,225
Unless you can prove..

332
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,498
..my suicide as murder.

333
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:34,778
So you use your greedy mind..

334
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:38,985
Take some risk..

335
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:43,787
..and create such circumstance
and witnesses..

336
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:50,730
..that the police believes
that someone killed me.

337
00:34:50,998 --> 00:34:53,466
Go to hell. l don't need even
a single rupee of yours.

338
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:58,337
lt's not a matter of a single rupee.

339
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:02,001
lt's about 24 crores, my darling.

340
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:05,003
Single rupee!

341
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:09,278
l can say very confidently, no
matter whatever you say now..

342
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,548
..you can't suppress the
greed of 24 crores.

343
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,483
And to get that you'll do exactly
what l'm telling you.

344
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:25,298
By the way, fooling the police
and the insurance company..

345
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:31,032
..is not that easy, but you'll
definitely find a way out.

346
00:35:31,772 --> 00:35:33,763
Or else you won't get
a single rupee.

347
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:39,308
And the reason l've stopped
Subhash here is..

348
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,841
..so that you don't trap
him in my murder case.

349
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,352
You're a sick creep!

350
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:49,388
And for God's sake stop
your drama now.

351
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:52,584
The drama will begin now.

352
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,928
The show must go on.

353
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:58,054
You're drunk.
You're out of your senses.

354
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,458
Go to bed.

355
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,934
Go to sleep.

356
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,006
Oh my God!

357
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:30,419
Mallika. Whom are you calling?

358
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,151
The police. - No.

359
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:33,885
No.

360
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,429
Mallika, listen to me.
This man has given you a challenge..

361
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:37,623
..before leaving this world.

362
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:40,560
lf you win this challenge
you'll get 24 crore rupees.

363
00:37:41,168 --> 00:37:42,430
lt's not a challenge
worth 24 crores..

364
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:44,903
..but he left a sword worth
24 crores hanging on me.

365
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,836
lf l try to get it l'll die.

366
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,169
lf you try to do something alone
you might be in trouble.

367
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,840
But l'm here to help you
out. l can help you.

368
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,575
O please for God's sake
l don't need your help.

369
00:37:56,717 --> 00:37:58,514
lt's not help. lt's not help.

370
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,850
Partnership. 50-50.

371
00:38:02,523 --> 00:38:04,184
You'll get 12 and
l'll get the rest.

372
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:07,517
Don't show me such dreams.
l'm tried of dreaming.

373
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:09,195
lt's not a dream. lt's for real.

374
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:10,996
lt's right there in
front of your eyes.

375
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:13,066
Look there. Look there.

376
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:17,065
This 24 crore check is lying right
in front of you, Mallika.

377
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:19,999
Take it and deposit it in the bank.

378
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,868
What!

379
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:27,078
No, l don't want to take any risk.

380
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:29,205
Without a risk nothing is possible.

381
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,678
You have to take a risk.

382
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,520
Now try to understand me.

383
00:38:35,556 --> 00:38:39,219
Less risk and less profit.
lt's called business.

384
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:44,095
Big risk and big profit.
lt's called gambling.

385
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:50,030
But less risk and big profit.
lt's called opportunity.

386
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:52,232
lt's a chance of a lifetime.

387
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,900
We get such opportunities
only once in a lifetime.

388
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:58,505
And some people spend
their entire lives..

389
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,705
..for such opportunities, Mallika.

390
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,040
This is that big chance.

391
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,777
And whose money is this
24 crore rupees anyway?

392
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:07,986
The insurance company had to pay
this money sooner or later.

393
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:09,656
Then why should we let it go?

394
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,782
And this man, this man
is already dead.

395
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:15,518
How does it affect anyone if we say..

396
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:16,722
..it's not a suicide, but a murder?

397
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:20,060
No. We're not committing a crime.

398
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:22,068
We're not committing any crime.

399
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,800
Of course, we'll tell a few lies.

400
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,663
We'll gather some evidence.

401
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:29,935
What evidence, what lies
and what witness!

402
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:32,602
The doctor will tell them
at what time he died.

403
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:35,281
And police will tell them
we were here at that time.

404
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:37,550
And if a third person
had killed him..

405
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:40,553
..then who is that third
one and why did he kill..

406
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:44,022
..when did he kill, how did he kill..
No, no, no, please..

407
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,149
Please call the police.
Call them now.

408
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:48,090
Mallika, please give me time to
think. We'll find a way out.

409
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:50,561
Are you an idiot?
You don't understand..

410
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:52,622
..he didn't leave me
any time at all.

411
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:55,693
Mallika, Mallika, listen!

412
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:57,830
Wait!

413
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:03,168
Does this freezer work?
- Yes.

414
00:40:03,577 --> 00:40:04,635
Where is its switch?

415
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:06,609
lts here.
- Switch it on.

416
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:13,717
Good. Good.

417
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:17,113
Now let's dump his dead
body into this.

418
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,122
But, why in this?
- Yes.

419
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,727
Why are dead bodies stored
in ice chambers in morgues?

420
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,133
Because the body doesn't
rot in the ice chambers.

421
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:29,260
What do you mean?

422
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:31,600
Even if you ask a doctor
to check the..

423
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:34,607
..dead body after six months,
the doctor would..

424
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:37,337
..say that he must have died
one or two hours ago.

425
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:40,909
Yes. This means we will have lots
of time on our hands.

426
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:44,140
The time to change his
suicide into murder.

427
00:40:44,218 --> 00:40:47,085
The time to gather new situations
and new evidence.

428
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:50,146
But how will we prove that
he was murdered by someone else.

429
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,652
l haven't thought about that.
- What?!

430
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,961
Let's put the body inside
first. That's it.

431
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:56,087
This is very dangerous.

432
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,653
And l don't want to take any risk.

433
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,630
l am not talking about peanuts.

434
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:01,861
This is the matter of 24 crores.

435
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:03,628
We will have to take some risks.

436
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:06,673
Don't you realise that
this is very risky?

437
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,775
The police will be suspicious
about me.

438
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:10,637
And even if we are successful
in proving that..

439
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:13,771
..this not a suicide but
a murder, then what?

440
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:15,882
Then l will be convicted
for this murder.

441
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,381
There's no way l am doing this.

442
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:18,879
No!

443
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:22,287
Okay. Supposedly,
this does happen..

444
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:26,251
Then this would be
the answer to this.

445
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:28,693
What is this?
- This is a letter.

446
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:31,796
He had written a letter to
your lawyer, Mr. Merchant.

447
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:33,263
Which l have read.

448
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:34,392
Show it to me.

449
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:36,932
l'll read it. l am literate.
l will read it.

450
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:39,671
ln the beginning,
he has written the..

451
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,264
..same things that
he had told you.

452
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:44,309
And listen to what
he hadn't told you.

453
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:51,777
Mallika will try to prove that
my suicide is a murder. Wow.

454
00:41:52,686 --> 00:42:01,424
And get her released from jail
if he gets caught for this murder.

455
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:02,954
Show me this letter.

456
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:04,221
lt is still incomplete.

457
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:05,728
lt is still incomplete.

458
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:08,696
And if she is successful in proving..

459
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:12,705
..that this is a murder,
then give this letter to..

460
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:18,109
..the insurance company and
get the payment stopped.

461
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:19,770
You are great!

462
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,175
He is sick!

463
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,745
He did not want me to
get the money at all.

464
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:26,877
Be it murder or suicide.

465
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:30,356
He wanted to ridicule you big time.

466
00:42:30,724 --> 00:42:32,715
He made all the arrangements
so that..

467
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:34,260
..you don't get the money
at any cost.

468
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:38,323
But you.. l mean us.
We are very fortunate.

469
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:40,231
We have this letter.

470
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:45,129
What if we get convicted
for his murder?

471
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:48,469
This is the way out. lsn't it?

472
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:49,800
Come on, give me the letter.

473
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:51,802
Come on, give it to me.

474
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,278
No.
- Give me the letter!

475
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:56,750
Do you think l am a fool?

476
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:58,745
What if you forget who Subhash..

477
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:02,778
..Sharma is once you
get the 24 crores?

478
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:07,491
l will come to you with his ration
card and tell you that it's me.

479
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:10,886
Tell me, do you agree or no.

480
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:21,805
Do you agree or no?

481
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:31,310
Coffee.
- Thanks.

482
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:39,250
Listen, Mr. Adenwala is alive.

483
00:44:39,853 --> 00:44:40,911
He is alive!

484
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,046
lf anyone inquires about him, then..

485
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:43,180
..tell that person that he is alive.

486
00:44:43,257 --> 00:44:45,088
Okay?
- Where is he, if he is alive?

487
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:47,252
He is upstairs in the bedroom.

488
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:49,527
He is severely ill.

489
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:50,961
Doctor has told him to rest.

490
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:53,898
No one can meet him. No. No.

491
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,092
Okay.

492
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:58,337
This means that you,
l and he are in this house.

493
00:44:58,472 --> 00:44:59,598
Yes.

494
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,534
We would be the prime suspects.

495
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:02,870
What is wrong with you?

496
00:45:09,616 --> 00:45:11,015
Oh my God!

497
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:17,924
Yes. We need a third
person in this house.

498
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:19,283
Third person!

499
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,294
Yes. - Sir is ill.
We want someone to look after him.

500
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:23,994
And to help you out.

501
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,957
We need a girl or a nurse.

502
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:30,034
Do you know any girl
who could come here?

503
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:34,038
No. But l'll call Mr. Merchant.

504
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:36,042
That will be great. Call him.

505
00:45:41,215 --> 00:45:42,477
Oh my God!
- What happened?

506
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,982
What if someone opens it?

507
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,177
We will have to lock it.

508
00:45:46,253 --> 00:45:47,311
Where are its keys?

509
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:48,581
No! No!
- Why?

510
00:45:48,655 --> 00:45:51,283
We can't lock it.
- But why?

511
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:55,061
Looking at the lock, people will
question us as to what is in it.

512
00:45:55,195 --> 00:45:56,389
And we will say that it is empty.

513
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,055
Then they will ask us why you
have locked it if it's empty.

514
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,965
This means that we will have
to leave it open like this.

515
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:04,964
Come.

516
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,971
Why do people say that
liquor is a bad thing?

517
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:17,543
Even the empty bottles are useful.

518
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:23,987
Now no one will think of opening it.

519
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:25,953
Anyone who wants to look into this..

520
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:30,360
..freezer will have to
remove these bottles.

521
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:11,067
Merchant.
- Hi! How are you?

522
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:13,596
l am fine.
- Swati. - Hello.

523
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,537
Adenwalas are our family friends.

524
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:16,734
l don't want
any complaints from them.

525
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,672
Okay. - Why would l complain
about this sweet girl?

526
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:21,139
Anyway, thanks for coming.

527
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:23,005
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

528
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,208
You are still here.

529
00:47:24,585 --> 00:47:26,018
l was destined to meet you again.

530
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:27,144
That's why l am here.

531
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:28,279
Get the luggage. Okay.

532
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:32,089
Show Swati her room and
the house too. - Okay.

533
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:36,524
How is Jaisingh? l'll go
and say hello to him. - Hi.

534
00:47:36,597 --> 00:47:37,655
He's fine, Mr. Merchant.

535
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:39,089
Please don't disturb him.

536
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,565
He shouted at me and
harassed me a lot.

537
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:42,033
He has slept just a while ago.

538
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:44,228
He will wake up. l know
all his habits. Come on.

539
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:45,565
He will shout at me,
if l don't meet him.

540
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:47,173
He will say that why
didn't you meet me.

541
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:48,572
He has become very irritable.

542
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:49,768
Oh yeah. - He throws things at
people for no reason.

543
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:51,101
l'll handle him.

544
00:47:51,178 --> 00:47:52,236
Don't worry.

545
00:47:52,312 --> 00:47:53,370
At least have tea first.

546
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:54,505
No, l don't want tea.

547
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,243
Doctor has told us.
- That l should drink tea.

548
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,776
No. That no one should meet him.

549
00:48:02,656 --> 00:48:03,782
l'll go and just look at him.

550
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:11,096
Sir, stop it. No! Madam has told me.

551
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:16,601
No!
- Why did you go to disturb him?

552
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,095
You had told me to get
the paper signed.

553
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,198
He hit me on the head.

554
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:25,745
Sir, get the papers signed
if you are going in.

555
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:27,473
Please.
- Have you gone mad?

556
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:28,605
l don't want a broken head.

557
00:48:28,682 --> 00:48:31,344
Sir, you are his friend.
Please get it signed.

558
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:32,643
Please!

559
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:47,396
Hi!
- Hi! Are you okay? - Yes. Yes.

560
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:49,565
lt's a small wound.

561
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:51,595
He has been ill for a long time.

562
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:54,140
That's why gets
irritated very easily.

563
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:55,831
He hits people with whatever
he can lay his hands on.

564
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:57,303
He hit me with an ash tray today.

565
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,242
Don't every go into his room?

566
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:02,714
Don't climb the stairs.

567
00:49:03,717 --> 00:49:05,116
Merchant uncle was saying that..

568
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:06,777
..he is a very famous film producer.

569
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:09,253
Yes. Haven't you heard
about him? No.

570
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:10,583
Adenwala Movie Tone.

571
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:14,520
He has made that film,
'Aap Aaye Bahar Aiyee.'

572
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,719
'Aap Aaye Bahar Aiyee.'

573
00:49:15,862 --> 00:49:17,159
'Warna Main Andhar Thi.'

574
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:20,160
No.
- What are these? Paintings.

575
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:23,463
My architectural sketches.

576
00:49:23,603 --> 00:49:28,199
Architecture! l can't believe it.

577
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:30,200
Why?

578
00:49:30,477 --> 00:49:32,672
How can you be an architect?

579
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:34,870
When you have come here
as a care taker?

580
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:36,206
So what?

581
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,878
We are seven siblings including me.

582
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:41,211
We have to run our house
with dad's pension.

583
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:45,289
l do a job to take care
of my expenditure.

584
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:46,551
Good. Good.

585
00:49:49,162 --> 00:49:50,561
Shall l ask you something?

586
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:55,429
Yes.
- How long have you been here?

587
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,462
l have been here since
a few days. Why?

588
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:05,903
l am feeling weird since
l have come into this house.

589
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,342
Did you feel the same
way when you came here?

590
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:15,254
No. no. Yes. Yes.

591
00:50:15,689 --> 00:50:18,385
The thing is that we are used
to living in crammed houses.

592
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:20,186
This is a big house.

593
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,592
That's why you are bound
to feel like that. Yeah.

594
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:27,265
No. Something is wrong.

595
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:30,927
l can't explain it to you.

596
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:36,232
But, l don't know.
lt's just strange.

597
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:38,243
l know. Strange. l know.
- Yes.

598
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:40,207
Anyway, l'll get used to it.

599
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,305
Yes, you'll get used to it.
Yes. - Yeah.

600
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:53,292
Why are you behaving like this?

601
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:55,524
You are behaving like a kid.

602
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:58,229
Oh please! For God's sake,
don't irritate me.

603
00:50:58,298 --> 00:50:59,356
Why would you bother?

604
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,663
People will blame me if anything
wrong happens to you.

605
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:03,827
Okay. Fine. lt's your wish.

606
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,429
Do whatever you want to do.

607
00:51:05,572 --> 00:51:06,630
l don't care.

608
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:19,844
Stop practicing architecture.

609
00:51:19,986 --> 00:51:21,248
Start a restaurant.

610
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:23,312
Lovely food. Thanks.
- Thanks.

611
00:51:23,723 --> 00:51:24,781
Where is madam?

612
00:51:24,925 --> 00:51:25,983
She is in her room.

613
00:51:26,259 --> 00:51:27,385
Okay.

614
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:30,320
ln the morning..

615
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:31,455
What is this?

616
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:32,589
You are prepping up for the evening.

617
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:36,261
Yes.
- Subhash, it seems that Adenwala..

618
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:38,497
..doesn't take his
medicines on time.

619
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:41,331
Madam brings back
the glass of water.

620
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,741
He must be having it with liquor.
- Okay.

621
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,335
He is a stupid man.

622
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,346
Subhash, what ailment
does he suffer from?

623
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:56,781
The ailments that rich people have
are beyond our comprehension.

624
00:51:56,857 --> 00:51:57,915
What do l say?

625
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:03,353
What happened?

626
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:06,692
Subhash, are you okay?

627
00:52:07,501 --> 00:52:08,593
Do you need water?

628
00:52:12,906 --> 00:52:14,032
Why is this switched off?

629
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:15,365
l have switched it off.

630
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:18,573
Why?
- Madam told me that it's empty.

631
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:20,044
So l thought that it must have
been switched on by mistake.

632
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:21,371
So l switched it off.

633
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:23,313
Okay? When did you switch it off?

634
00:52:23,383 --> 00:52:24,645
Just five minutes ago.

635
00:52:26,753 --> 00:52:29,688
Don't ever, switch it off.

636
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,051
You have to keep it switched
on even if it's empty.

637
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:33,986
Why? This is the system
of this freezer.

638
00:52:34,427 --> 00:52:36,554
The ice gets accumulated
on the walls.

639
00:52:36,897 --> 00:52:38,762
And if you switch it off
the ice starts melting.

640
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:40,526
Then the water gets
accumulated inside.

641
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:43,061
You have to remove the water,
then put things inside.

642
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:44,928
Otherwise the motor stops working.

643
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:47,863
lt has a German compressor.
Number 38.

644
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:52,069
l hope it won't stop working.

645
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:53,937
No. You switched it off just
five minutes ago, isn't it?

646
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:55,072
Yes, l switched it off
just five minutes ago.

647
00:52:55,348 --> 00:52:56,406
lt won't stop working now.

648
00:52:56,483 --> 00:52:57,677
Otherwise there would have
been water everywhere.

649
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:01,377
Thank you. You saved me.

650
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,350
Otherwise l would have
been in grave trouble.

651
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:05,983
Relax. Relax. Okay.

652
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:27,110
Just a minute. What happened?

653
00:53:27,948 --> 00:53:29,415
Get that girl out of this house.

654
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,641
What?

655
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:33,049
Yes. - Today she switched off
the freezer.

656
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,416
What if she comes upstairs
to the room?

657
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:35,782
She won't do anything like that

658
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:38,523
She is mad. She can do anything.

659
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:41,117
Oh no. But we can't throw her
out of the house.

660
00:53:41,394 --> 00:53:42,452
Why not?

661
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:43,996
Do you want to have
an affair with her?

662
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:46,863
Just shut up and go.

663
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:49,934
Have you thought
about the dead body?

664
00:53:50,003 --> 00:53:51,061
Why are you in such a hurry?

665
00:53:51,137 --> 00:53:52,399
As it is, it's lying inside.

666
00:53:52,739 --> 00:53:53,797
We will think about it later.

667
00:53:53,873 --> 00:53:55,534
We will have to think about
it very carefully.

668
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:59,001
And please,
don't come here at night.

669
00:53:59,479 --> 00:54:02,073
Everything will be finished if
she gets suspicious about us.

670
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:03,672
Okay. Now go.

671
00:55:01,874 --> 00:55:03,933
Hello. What?!

672
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:16,345
What happened?

673
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:17,880
Look!

674
00:55:36,842 --> 00:55:37,900
No! No!

675
00:56:41,974 --> 00:56:46,308
Subhash!
- She was sleepwalking.

676
00:56:46,378 --> 00:56:47,970
She must be dreaming
about something.

677
00:56:48,046 --> 00:56:49,911
She is not conscious. Okay?

678
00:56:49,982 --> 00:56:51,040
Don't worry.

679
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,174
We can't leave her alive.

680
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:55,042
What? - She is suspicious
that something is wrong.

681
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,247
And we will have to finish her.

682
00:56:57,322 --> 00:56:58,380
Okay, we will finish her.

683
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,515
Then what?

684
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:00,922
We will keep her in the freezer too.

685
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:02,051
Along with Adenwala.

686
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,185
Oh, shut up!

687
00:57:04,196 --> 00:57:07,393
We will throw her down
from the terrace.

688
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,933
We will say she was sleepwalking.

689
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,059
And that's why she died.

690
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:16,073
Have you vowed you'll kill
someone every seven days?

691
00:57:16,675 --> 00:57:18,199
Please have mercy, murder queen.

692
00:57:18,544 --> 00:57:20,535
You are the night hunter.

693
00:57:20,612 --> 00:57:22,079
Go to your room. ldiot!

694
00:57:29,421 --> 00:57:33,482
Swati. Swati. Hl!

695
00:57:35,627 --> 00:57:37,151
Go to your room and sleep.

696
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,554
Why are you sleeping
in the passage?

697
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,961
How did l get here?

698
00:57:40,032 --> 00:57:42,159
Do you sleepwalk?

699
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:44,093
l came here sleepwalking.

700
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,632
l saw some light here.

701
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:54,036
You were removing all the
bottles in your sleep.

702
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,109
You have removed all these bottles.

703
00:57:57,649 --> 00:58:00,447
Oh my God! - Where you dreaming
about something?

704
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,577
Were you dreaming
about the freezer?

705
00:58:02,988 --> 00:58:05,047
Maybe. l was dreaming about
this when l was asleep.

706
00:58:05,123 --> 00:58:06,181
l thought so.

707
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:08,123
Hopefully the freezer will
not get filled with water.

708
00:58:08,393 --> 00:58:10,054
Hopefully l've not damaged it.

709
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,655
Look, it's not damaged. Look.

710
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,058
lt's working.

711
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:17,999
l can repair it if its gets damaged.

712
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,004
l can repair it.
- Okay.

713
00:58:20,072 --> 00:58:22,131
l can repair your madam too,
let alone this machine.

714
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:24,208
Go to your room and sleep.

715
00:58:24,276 --> 00:58:25,334
l'll keep them.

716
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,468
Go to your room.

717
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,139
She'll cut off your salary
if you stay awake at night.

718
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,272
Okay. Okay.

719
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:31,407
Go to your room. Go.

720
00:58:31,483 --> 00:58:32,541
l hope madam won't shout at me.

721
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:33,676
Go. Go. Go.

722
00:58:33,752 --> 00:58:35,014
lts okay, isn't it?

723
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:36,145
Good night! Good night!

724
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,279
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

725
00:58:37,356 --> 00:58:39,153
Good night!
- Thank you, Subhash.

726
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,282
Good night.

727
00:58:43,362 --> 00:58:45,091
This girl will ruin all our plans.

728
00:58:46,098 --> 00:58:47,156
So what?

729
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,290
l mean we will have to
do something about it.

730
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,425
That too very soon.

731
00:58:51,103 --> 00:58:53,628
Tomorrow night at 9. Okay?

732
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,098
Everything's fine until now.

733
00:58:57,442 --> 00:59:00,036
He is very clever.

734
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:03,578
First let's take advantage
of his intelligence.

735
00:59:04,182 --> 00:59:05,240
After that..

736
00:59:06,718 --> 00:59:08,583
l'm waiting for the right
moment to kick him out.

737
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:13,182
Okay. Good night!

738
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:35,469
Swati!
- Yes madam.

739
00:59:35,547 --> 00:59:37,208
Do one thing. Switch off the lights.

740
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,341
The lights hurt his eyes.
- Okay?

741
01:00:04,576 --> 01:00:05,770
Be careful. Be careful.

742
01:00:11,183 --> 01:00:13,777
Easy. Easy.

743
01:00:16,788 --> 01:00:20,246
Stop! Go! Just go away!

744
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:27,731
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the lights.

745
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:29,191
Sorry. Sorry.

746
01:01:15,447 --> 01:01:17,176
Swati. ls madam there?

747
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:19,180
She has gone out.

748
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:21,308
l got late because of the car.

749
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,844
The car has broken down.

750
01:01:24,523 --> 01:01:25,854
l'll take it to the garage.

751
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:29,193
Yes, you go to sleep. Don't worry.

752
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:35,324
Okay. Come on, let's go.

753
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:43,207
Let's go to the milk booth.

754
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,807
l'll lock you in the milk booth.

755
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,336
l'll tie your hands and legs.

756
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,878
And l'll jam a cloth
into your mouth.

757
01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:49,208
Why?

758
01:01:50,215 --> 01:01:53,343
You'll call out to people
if your mouth is left open.

759
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,344
Didn't you find any other place?

760
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,478
Why the milk booth?

761
01:01:56,555 --> 01:01:58,420
The milk van arrives at 4.30 am.

762
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,355
They will release you
when they see you.

763
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,891
Hence you'll be inside the
booth only for 2-3 hours.

764
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:04,360
This is for your own benefit.

765
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,487
Why the milk booth?

766
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:06,622
Come on, hurry up.

767
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,826
Stop!

768
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,862
And hear me out.

769
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:46,262
When the people in the
milk van set you free..

770
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:49,273
..you'll have to tell
the police that you..

771
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:52,276
..and Adenwala were going to lrla..

772
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:55,472
..nursing home to get him admitted.

773
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:57,947
Half way, some thugs
stopped your car.

774
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,281
They tied your hands and legs.

775
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:02,411
And locked you in the milk booth.

776
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,285
And then they kidnapped Adenwala.

777
01:03:05,357 --> 01:03:07,621
Got it? Kidnap. Along with the car.

778
01:03:07,692 --> 01:03:09,421
And you don't know where
Adenwala is right now.

779
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,552
Okay?

780
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,888
Okay. But he will be inside
the freezer, isn't it?

781
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:15,299
No, he will come out of the freezer,
have a bath and..

782
01:03:15,367 --> 01:03:17,301
..breakfast and then he'll
go back into the freezer!

783
01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:18,627
He will stay inside.

784
01:03:18,703 --> 01:03:19,761
How can he roam outside?

785
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:20,896
Don't talk like idiots.

786
01:03:21,973 --> 01:03:25,306
And then we'll remove the dead
body from the freezer..

787
01:03:25,377 --> 01:03:28,642
..and throw it at some desolate
place after 3-4 days.

788
01:03:28,713 --> 01:03:30,374
Here you go.

789
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:36,446
The police will have to accept that
whatever you're saying is true.

790
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:43,393
And that people who had kidnapped
him have killed him.

791
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:45,792
This murder will happen
outside the house.

792
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,331
And Swati will be the
witness that we..

793
01:03:47,399 --> 01:03:48,661
..were in the house when
this murder took place.

794
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:49,791
Okay? Got it?

795
01:03:52,404 --> 01:03:53,462
One more thing.

796
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:55,336
ln order to show that
the thugs tied your..

797
01:03:55,407 --> 01:03:57,398
..hands and legs and threw you here.

798
01:03:57,475 --> 01:03:58,533
Close your eyes.

799
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:01,806
Close your eyes and
see the magic. Okay?

800
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,938
One.. two.

801
01:04:05,951 --> 01:04:07,418
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

802
01:04:10,021 --> 01:04:11,420
All the best. Okay.

803
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,795
Hello. Yes, Merchant uncle.

804
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:12,727
What?

805
01:07:13,605 --> 01:07:15,004
They did not reach the nursing home.

806
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:17,065
That's surprising.

807
01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:19,067
Where could they be?

808
01:07:21,012 --> 01:07:22,138
You want me to call the police.

809
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:24,673
Yes. Just a minute.

810
01:07:26,217 --> 01:07:29,618
Hello. Police station!

811
01:07:30,555 --> 01:07:31,613
Where did you find the car?

812
01:07:32,891 --> 01:07:35,018
We found it at the Mahalaxmi
race course's parking lot.

813
01:07:35,693 --> 01:07:39,220
Amazing. l thought that they
must have gone out of town.

814
01:07:40,632 --> 01:07:41,690
l will bash you up.

815
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,824
But you have found the car at the..

816
01:07:42,901 --> 01:07:43,959
..race course abandoned like this.

817
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:45,627
We'll tell you if we get
any other information.

818
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:49,768
And you stay in Mr. Adenwala's
bungalow, isn't it?

819
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:50,899
Yes sir.

820
01:07:51,843 --> 01:07:53,708
lnform us immediately if
you get any phone call.

821
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:55,578
Okay sir.
- Okay sir.

822
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:56,771
Thank you very much.

823
01:07:56,981 --> 01:07:58,710
You are welcome. Thanks.

824
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:03,652
There is no rickshaw in sight.

825
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,257
Sir, can you drop me?

826
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:11,590
Hey! Sit on the front seat.

827
01:08:16,334 --> 01:08:17,596
Thank you.

828
01:08:26,678 --> 01:08:27,736
Strap on the belt.

829
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:36,749
Sorry. What do you think?

830
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:39,620
About what?

831
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:42,018
What do you think
about sir and madam?

832
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:44,691
l'm worried that something wrong
might've happened to them.

833
01:08:45,697 --> 01:08:48,757
Don't worry. You'll get your salary.

834
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,160
Sir has given me six month's
salary in advance.

835
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,702
Oh! You have got the salary,
isn't it?

836
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,698
Now stay at home.

837
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,032
Stay at home until your
sir comes back home.

838
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,168
Carry on with your work.

839
01:09:00,245 --> 01:09:01,303
Don't run away.

840
01:09:03,114 --> 01:09:04,308
When will sir come back?

841
01:09:04,382 --> 01:09:05,781
How will l know when
he will come back?

842
01:09:07,252 --> 01:09:08,310
Where has he gone?

843
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:10,649
l don't know!

844
01:09:12,657 --> 01:09:16,058
l thought he might have told
you while talking to you.

845
01:09:17,662 --> 01:09:20,790
People can gossip with a peon.

846
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:21,923
Not with a lawyer.

847
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,331
And l am a lawyer. Okay?

848
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:24,926
l am a lawyer.

849
01:09:25,937 --> 01:09:27,336
You are a lawyer.

850
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,673
l thought that you are..
- What?

851
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,068
l mean that you are not the peon.

852
01:09:31,142 --> 01:09:33,201
You'd have known where he has
gone if you were the peon.

853
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:34,802
Just shut up! Just shut up! Okay.

854
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:41,013
What did you say? What did you say?

855
01:09:41,085 --> 01:09:43,076
l'm just asking you
where sir has gone.

856
01:09:43,154 --> 01:09:44,280
Why are you getting so worked up?

857
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:45,822
No, l am not angry.

858
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,687
lt's your right. Come
on, ask me. Ask me.

859
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:48,817
Ask me whatever you feel like.

860
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:49,951
l have the right to ask.

861
01:09:51,095 --> 01:09:52,153
Where are they?

862
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:55,961
Get out. Get out.

863
01:10:07,712 --> 01:10:10,112
Yes sir. No sir.

864
01:10:10,448 --> 01:10:13,713
Yes sir. Okay.

865
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,719
Subhash, any news?

866
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,052
These policemen are so lazy.

867
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:21,916
lt's been two days.

868
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:23,119
And they still can't track
down two people.

869
01:10:23,194 --> 01:10:25,719
ldiots!
- lt's not so easy, Subhash.

870
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:27,396
lt's such a big city.

871
01:10:27,465 --> 01:10:28,796
What are you saying?

872
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:30,731
The milk van comes in the
morning and you can..

873
01:10:30,802 --> 01:10:33,396
Milk?
- Milk van.

874
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,338
l think l have lost it
because of the tension.

875
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:37,999
Milk van.

876
01:10:38,076 --> 01:10:39,134
What must have happened?

877
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:41,069
Where must they be?

878
01:10:44,349 --> 01:10:50,811
Swati, l know as much as you
know about this matter.

879
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:53,819
No. You know something more.

880
01:10:54,225 --> 01:10:56,420
l know. You are very tensed.

881
01:10:57,228 --> 01:10:58,752
l am bound to be tensed.

882
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,425
We have been stuck in this
mess for the past days.

883
01:11:01,499 --> 01:11:02,761
That's why l am bound to me tensed.

884
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,825
No, Subhash. Something
else is bothering you.

885
01:11:04,902 --> 01:11:07,370
Tell me. l want to help you.

886
01:11:12,043 --> 01:11:13,237
Swati, do you remember?

887
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:17,839
l was late when they left
for the nursing home.

888
01:11:18,116 --> 01:11:20,175
The day when your car had
broken down, isn't it?

889
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,783
My car hadn't broken down. Swati.

890
01:11:25,123 --> 01:11:26,784
l had lied to you.

891
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,187
Actually, l had an accident.

892
01:11:31,863 --> 01:11:34,798
Accident!
- l was getting late.

893
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:35,924
So l was driving recklessly.

894
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,468
So l rammed into a motor cycle.
- Gosh!

895
01:11:38,936 --> 01:11:41,928
l am sure he is severely wounded.

896
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,137
And l'm worried that l'll be one
of the prime suspects if..

897
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:49,475
..this fact about the accident
comes out in the open.

898
01:11:49,547 --> 01:11:54,143
Just relax. Just relax.
Just relax. Just relax.

899
01:11:54,952 --> 01:11:59,821
Oh God! Swati, will you
do me a favor?

900
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:01,822
Yes, tell me.

901
01:12:01,893 --> 01:12:06,159
Just in case, if the
policemen ask you..

902
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:10,496
..where l was when he left
for the nursing home.

903
01:12:10,568 --> 01:12:11,830
Say that l was here.

904
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:13,894
Madam had told me to stay here.

905
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:17,031
But madam will say that
you were late.

906
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:18,967
We'll think about it later.

907
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,510
What do l do?

908
01:12:20,978 --> 01:12:23,378
l've recorded the same statement.

909
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:25,313
And l've said the same
thing to Mr. Merchant.

910
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:28,841
l'll get trapped if
l say something else.

911
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:31,985
Please Swati. Please.

912
01:12:32,924 --> 01:12:37,258
Only you can save me. Please.

913
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:45,992
Okay. - Did you see?
l am relaxed now. Relaxed.

914
01:12:51,142 --> 01:12:52,200
What happened? Any news?

915
01:12:52,276 --> 01:12:53,334
Yes, we have got some news.

916
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:54,469
Come with me.

917
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:57,005
l'll be right back.

918
01:13:27,512 --> 01:13:28,570
What happened to her?

919
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,506
She has been dead since a long time.

920
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,507
She is dead.

921
01:13:34,986 --> 01:13:36,044
Oh my God!

922
01:13:42,927 --> 01:13:47,193
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!

923
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:50,931
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

924
01:13:51,002 --> 01:13:52,060
ls he her brother-in-law?

925
01:13:53,271 --> 01:13:55,068
He is not her brother-in-law.
He is her driver.

926
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:17,358
DCP Gokhale.
- J. D. Merchant.

927
01:14:17,428 --> 01:14:19,157
A legal advisor to Mr. Adenwala.
Please come.

928
01:14:24,969 --> 01:14:26,027
Sir!

929
01:14:34,378 --> 01:14:36,972
Who stays here?
- Nobody amongst the relatives..

930
01:14:37,048 --> 01:14:38,310
..but two of the staff
members do stay here.

931
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:40,116
She's Swati and he's Subhash.

932
01:14:40,651 --> 01:14:41,709
Why don't you sit down?

933
01:14:44,722 --> 01:14:46,053
What is your designation here?

934
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:51,451
Sir, l do everything.. from driving
to preparing drinks for sir.

935
01:14:52,396 --> 01:14:54,990
Yes, sir. Mr. Adenwala
is a heavy drinker.

936
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:57,064
He's sitting ideal since
the last five years..

937
01:14:57,134 --> 01:15:00,126
..after suffering a heavy loss in
the film. He's under a huge debt.

938
01:15:02,006 --> 01:15:06,340
How huge?
- This house is mortgaged.

939
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,671
The landlord is harassing him.

940
01:15:09,313 --> 01:15:11,679
He receives notices from different
people every week.

941
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:13,341
One more thing, sir.

942
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,015
They left home for the nursing home..

943
01:15:15,086 --> 01:15:17,077
..at 9 p.m. on Saturday night.

944
01:15:17,522 --> 01:15:19,547
And Mr. Adenwala is
missing since then.

945
01:15:21,592 --> 01:15:24,493
Why a nursing home?
For which sickness?

946
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:28,097
Mainly drinking problem.
- Alcoholic?

947
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,092
Water!
- Thank you, Swati. - Welcome, sir.

948
01:15:36,774 --> 01:15:38,765
Who's his doctor?
- Doctor?!

949
01:15:40,344 --> 01:15:45,111
l'm just a driver, sir. Driver!
- But who's his doctor? Doctor?!

950
01:15:45,449 --> 01:15:48,509
Sir used to hate the doctors.

951
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,116
He never allowed any doctor
to examine him.

952
01:15:52,557 --> 01:15:54,388
And he got ready to go
to the nursing home?

953
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,787
Sister-in-law had convinced him.

954
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:05,126
Did anybody come home
after Saturday?

955
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,231
Any phone calls?
- No.

956
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:12,267
Did he leave his house with luggage?

957
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,139
He had a small suitcase.

958
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:16,671
Where did you find the car from?

959
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:18,806
Sir, from the parking lot
of Mahalaxmi race course.

960
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,215
ls anything missing from the car?
- Nothing, sir.

961
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,310
Not even the car stereo or the AC.

962
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,082
ln fact Mrs. Adenwala was wearing..

963
01:16:26,157 --> 01:16:29,354
..diamond jewellery
worth 250 thousand.

964
01:16:30,094 --> 01:16:31,152
Nobody touched that too.

965
01:16:33,664 --> 01:16:34,722
Strange!

966
01:16:37,535 --> 01:16:40,129
Were you here when they left?
- Yes, sir.

967
01:16:40,671 --> 01:16:44,698
And Subhash?
- He was here. - Here.

968
01:16:44,842 --> 01:16:47,174
Why didn't you go? You drive for him.

969
01:16:47,511 --> 01:16:49,570
No, actually, l was supposed to go..

970
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:51,706
..but sister-in-law
told me to wait here.

971
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,841
Why?
- Because Swati was alone here.

972
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:58,479
l still tried to convince
sister-in-law to allow me to go..

973
01:16:58,556 --> 01:17:01,616
..with them but she said
l want the car to be there..

974
01:17:01,692 --> 01:17:03,250
..so how will you return then? Son!

975
01:17:07,398 --> 01:17:12,734
Sir, it's my fault.
lt's entirely my fault.

976
01:17:13,871 --> 01:17:15,736
This is because of my laziness.

977
01:17:16,874 --> 01:17:18,341
Had l not heard her..

978
01:17:22,146 --> 01:17:24,205
Please stop crying and oblige us.

979
01:17:24,782 --> 01:17:26,181
Don't start crying for
every trivial matter.

980
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:30,685
He saved Adenwala's life once
and since then he's lying here.

981
01:17:30,888 --> 01:17:32,822
What are you saying?

982
01:17:34,759 --> 01:17:38,627
l saved one life and snatched
away the other.

983
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:45,227
Call my sir. Call my sir back.

984
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,502
Enough! Enough! Your sir will
come back. He'll be found out.

985
01:17:50,307 --> 01:17:51,365
Calm down!

986
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,635
Now go to the bathroom
and wash your face.

987
01:17:55,179 --> 01:17:56,908
Gagre!
- Yes, sir. - Take him away.

988
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:06,347
l know where the bathroom is.
You go and do the other duty.

989
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:13,789
He's very emotional.
But little dolt.

990
01:18:14,865 --> 01:18:16,662
Had he been intelligent,
he wouldn't be a driver.

991
01:18:17,935 --> 01:18:19,197
Excuse me!

992
01:18:21,205 --> 01:18:25,665
Hello! Oh! Thank you.

993
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,212
Hear this. There's no
information with..

994
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,339
..lrla Nursing Home about..

995
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,748
..Mr. Adenwala's admittance
there that day.

996
01:18:36,954 --> 01:18:38,216
What?

997
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,747
Mr. Merchant! Check this out.

998
01:19:44,021 --> 01:19:50,950
Swati! When he left from here,
did you notice his condition?

999
01:19:51,562 --> 01:19:53,621
The way he was shivering
and walking..

1000
01:19:53,697 --> 01:19:56,757
..with madam's support,
it appeared to me..

1001
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,826
..as if he was on the
bed from long time.

1002
01:20:00,471 --> 01:20:02,962
Did his face appear to be sick?

1003
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:07,704
l saw him that day but
l couldn't see his face.

1004
01:20:08,045 --> 01:20:09,979
Why?
- There was darkness around.

1005
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:12,345
Why? Weren't the lights switched on?

1006
01:20:13,584 --> 01:20:15,381
He can't resist strong lights.

1007
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,715
And he was also wearing
a monkey cap.

1008
01:20:18,322 --> 01:20:19,482
Monkey cap?!
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:20:20,324 --> 01:20:22,622
Monkey cap, overcoat
and muffler too.

1010
01:20:23,327 --> 01:20:24,521
He was feeling very cold.

1011
01:20:24,895 --> 01:20:28,524
Sir, my sir had 103
degrees temperature.

1012
01:20:28,999 --> 01:20:30,899
He was literally shivering.
- Okay. Okay.

1013
01:20:31,769 --> 01:20:37,071
Mr. Merchant! l heard that
they used to fight.

1014
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:41,400
Yes! They used to fight.

1015
01:20:41,478 --> 01:20:45,676
But, what used to happen in private..
- Beating? - No!

1016
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:47,516
No, sir. He's a Godly man.

1017
01:20:47,785 --> 01:20:50,879
Beating somebody is
not possible. Never.

1018
01:20:50,955 --> 01:20:52,354
Okay.
- Never, sir.

1019
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:56,417
Difficult to say.

1020
01:20:56,894 --> 01:21:00,990
Because he's not only an alcoholic
but also eccentric.

1021
01:21:01,365 --> 01:21:04,425
That's right.
- Oh! Sir, that means Mr. Adenwala..

1022
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:06,696
..himself..
- Killed his wife. - And he escaped.

1023
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:11,434
lf he had to kill her,
why did he tie her?

1024
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:15,836
Okay.
- And if suppose he escaped..

1025
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,972
..then his car would have
been found near..

1026
01:21:18,048 --> 01:21:19,379
..some railway station
or an airport..

1027
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,714
..and not from the parking
lot of the race course.

1028
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:25,920
Exceptionally, he intended
to escape by riding horse.

1029
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,449
No, sir. He used to love animals..

1030
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:33,121
..but never used to ride them.
Dog, cat or goat.

1031
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,464
He didn't ride on the horse
even for his procession.

1032
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:40,803
He went walking. Only love.
No riding. No.

1033
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:43,562
Look, this was just to say.
- Ok.

1034
01:21:43,641 --> 01:21:44,699
Will you have some tea, sir?

1035
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,140
Wow! Nice tea.
- Thank you.

1036
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:58,148
Wow! Mr. Adenwala emptied
these bottles?

1037
01:22:01,926 --> 01:22:04,156
A bottle a day.
- Oh!

1038
01:22:06,697 --> 01:22:10,098
How much will one bottle be
worth for? 400 or 500 rupees?

1039
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:13,967
2500 rupees.
- What?

1040
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,773
2500 rupees.
- One bottle worth rupees 2500?

1041
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,705
What's in this?
- lt's empty.

1042
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:26,574
Then why is it on? Switch it off.

1043
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:31,983
No! No, we never switch it off.
Even if it's empty.

1044
01:22:32,523 --> 01:22:34,582
The ice accumulated
on its wall melts..

1045
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:38,526
..when we switch it off.
And the water gets collected inside.

1046
01:22:38,762 --> 01:22:40,821
Later on, if we want to
put something inside..

1047
01:22:40,898 --> 01:22:42,195
..we need to empty it.

1048
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:44,194
Otherwise the machine
will stop functioning.

1049
01:22:44,468 --> 01:22:47,528
Oh, l'm sorry. Sorry.
Here l switch it on again. Here.

1050
01:22:47,938 --> 01:22:51,635
lt's a German compressor of 38.
- 38?

1051
01:22:51,709 --> 01:22:53,643
What's this 38?
- 38.

1052
01:22:55,612 --> 01:23:02,484
38.. 38 succeeds 37 and
comes a little before 39.

1053
01:23:02,553 --> 01:23:06,489
Okay! Fine. 38 succeeds 37.

1054
01:23:09,226 --> 01:23:10,750
What will be the price of
this piece?

1055
01:23:11,495 --> 01:23:13,554
This one? 40 to 50 thousand..

1056
01:23:14,498 --> 01:23:16,557
You know, my brother-in-law
has opened..

1057
01:23:16,633 --> 01:23:18,567
..a hotel in Parel.
He wants one such piece.

1058
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:22,905
Actually, Adenwala wants
to sell this. Right?

1059
01:23:23,907 --> 01:23:29,504
Yes! Sir, sir is selling
all the items one by one.

1060
01:23:30,914 --> 01:23:33,712
Can you see this dining table?
- No.

1061
01:23:34,184 --> 01:23:35,242
He sold it off.

1062
01:23:37,254 --> 01:23:41,054
He sold it off. - Ok, fine!
You please sit down and relax.

1063
01:23:41,525 --> 01:23:42,583
Open this.

1064
01:23:43,193 --> 01:23:45,184
Do you want to see it from inside?
- Yes.

1065
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:47,690
Then we must bring down
all these bottles.

1066
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:52,593
Oh! Then bring it down.
- Oh, so do that. Gagre!

1067
01:23:54,872 --> 01:23:55,930
Sir, please.

1068
01:24:09,553 --> 01:24:11,612
Hello! Yes!

1069
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:21,628
Hey, be careful!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1070
01:24:22,232 --> 01:24:23,290
Leave it!

1071
01:24:25,569 --> 01:24:29,232
Yes! Spinal injury?
Got it. Thank you.

1072
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,303
Mr. Merchant, come and sit.

1073
01:24:35,913 --> 01:24:38,973
As per the post mortem report,
Mrs. Adenwala died..

1074
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:42,985
..approximately 5 hours before.
That is at 7 a.m. today morning.

1075
01:24:44,588 --> 01:24:47,716
And the serious spinal injury
is the cause of her death.

1076
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,593
lt was because of falling
on the edge of the bench..

1077
01:24:50,661 --> 01:24:52,060
..that was inside the booth.

1078
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:53,787
lts possible that
Mrs. Adenwala had..

1079
01:24:53,864 --> 01:24:55,661
..climbed on the bench
and fell down.

1080
01:24:57,067 --> 01:25:01,128
Mr. Gokhale, if she was locked
in the milk booth from..

1081
01:25:01,205 --> 01:25:04,265
..Saturday night, she
could have been found..

1082
01:25:04,341 --> 01:25:06,673
..by Sunday morning when the milk
van arrives early morning.

1083
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,870
Perhaps you don't know that there
has been a strike in the..

1084
01:25:09,947 --> 01:25:11,881
..Arabian colony since
the last five days.

1085
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,050
Mr. Gokhale. lt's quite possible
that a few goons may have..

1086
01:25:23,127 --> 01:25:27,188
..blocked their car and
locked Mrs. Adenwala..

1087
01:25:27,264 --> 01:25:29,164
..into the milk booth and
kidnapped Mr. Adenwala.

1088
01:25:31,034 --> 01:25:32,865
That's out of question, Mr. Merchant.
- Why?

1089
01:25:32,936 --> 01:25:35,370
Why is it out of question?
lt's straight and simple.

1090
01:25:35,973 --> 01:25:38,635
Why would anybody do the kidnapping?
For money, right?

1091
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:41,640
lf he kidnaps Mr. Adenwala
and kill his wife..

1092
01:25:41,712 --> 01:25:45,307
..whom will he demand
the ransom amount from?

1093
01:25:47,151 --> 01:25:52,851
Mr. Merchant, did Adenwala
make any will? - No.

1094
01:25:53,924 --> 01:25:55,858
l used to look after
his legal matters.

1095
01:25:56,126 --> 01:25:59,789
lf he had to make his will,
it was l who would have made it.

1096
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:05,726
Then there must be somebody else,
from the ones near to him..

1097
01:26:05,802 --> 01:26:07,736
..from his circle.

1098
01:26:10,007 --> 01:26:12,737
Borkar! - Sir! - Place Gagre on
duty over here. - Yes, sir.

1099
01:26:12,976 --> 01:26:14,170
Gagre!
- You stay here, right?

1100
01:26:14,244 --> 01:26:17,008
l don't have any other option sir.

1101
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:20,140
Here. Keep my card with
you. lf need arises..

1102
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:23,084
..and if it's very important,
call me. - Okay.

1103
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,154
Thanks for the tea, Swati!
- You're welcome, sir.

1104
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:41,836
Why were you crying taking
the name of sister-in-law?

1105
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:45,734
Sir has treated me like a brother.

1106
01:26:46,176 --> 01:26:47,370
So, madam is my sister-in-law.

1107
01:26:47,444 --> 01:26:50,038
What love? You know l was
controlling my laughter.

1108
01:26:51,181 --> 01:26:52,910
l'm an emotional person.

1109
01:26:54,785 --> 01:26:58,050
Mr. Merchant is still here?!
l'll take your leave. Okay?

1110
01:27:06,129 --> 01:27:07,187
Hey!

1111
01:27:11,335 --> 01:27:12,393
Come here!

1112
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,398
Prepare a drink for me.

1113
01:27:23,747 --> 01:27:26,409
lce! Wait!

1114
01:27:27,751 --> 01:27:28,809
Please use that.

1115
01:27:30,754 --> 01:27:34,952
Mr. Subhash Sharma!
- Mr. A. D. Merchant.

1116
01:27:36,827 --> 01:27:39,489
l heard you came here
to act in films.

1117
01:27:40,764 --> 01:27:44,222
Actually, initially, l intended
to be a lawyer. - Good.

1118
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,935
But then l thought it's
a dirty profession.

1119
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:49,302
lt'd be better for me to choose
a decent profession.

1120
01:27:49,773 --> 01:27:51,832
Till you don't get a
good break in films..

1121
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:54,240
..you should opt for a drama.

1122
01:27:55,012 --> 01:27:57,173
Really?
- Fabulous actor!

1123
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:03,043
Sister-in-law!

1124
01:28:04,855 --> 01:28:06,379
What a performance,
brother-in-law!

1125
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:08,382
You liked it?

1126
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:10,184
Thanks!

1127
01:28:13,797 --> 01:28:15,856
But there's a problem.
- What?

1128
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,268
Where will you give this performance?
- Meaning?

1129
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:23,530
ln jail?
- Jail? Why?

1130
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:27,009
Because police is in search
of the third person.

1131
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:32,872
Whether third or fourth,
why should l be concerned?

1132
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:36,010
You're the first one in the
list of the 'third person.'

1133
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:41,882
How am l involved now?
l'm not at all concerned..

1134
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:46,887
Sorry!

1135
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:52,902
Assume that Mr. Adenwala
is murdered.

1136
01:28:55,839 --> 01:28:57,363
Okay, fine.
- Right?

1137
01:28:58,575 --> 01:29:00,042
And Mrs. Adenwala!

1138
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,039
There was an attempt to
murder sister-in-law.

1139
01:29:05,849 --> 01:29:07,908
Okay, suppose this is true too.

1140
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:10,177
Right?
- Yes.

1141
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:16,257
Now the question is A) Who did it?

1142
01:29:18,428 --> 01:29:21,192
And B) Why?

1143
01:29:24,134 --> 01:29:30,937
A) God knows.
- And B? - God knows.

1144
01:29:35,612 --> 01:29:37,944
God knows everything, mister.

1145
01:29:40,617 --> 01:29:42,141
But police doesn't know anything.

1146
01:29:42,886 --> 01:29:46,947
And till police is unaware
of it it'll suspect..

1147
01:29:47,023 --> 01:29:50,959
..either the right
or a wrong person.

1148
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,624
On whom?
- Whom? - Yes.

1149
01:29:58,902 --> 01:30:03,635
The one who's going to obtain
Adenwala's entire property.

1150
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:09,901
Adenwala's property. lt's
spent in paying the debts.

1151
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,911
Police doesn't calculate
how much is left..

1152
01:30:11,982 --> 01:30:14,314
..and how much is paid off.

1153
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,982
l feel sleepy.
Let me take your leave.

1154
01:30:23,193 --> 01:30:25,252
You'll lose sleep for
your entire life..

1155
01:30:25,328 --> 01:30:28,058
..when you come to know
what this contains.

1156
01:30:37,607 --> 01:30:38,665
What is there in this?

1157
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:46,541
Your tomb is ready.
And you've made it yourself.

1158
01:30:47,384 --> 01:30:49,443
Only a kick is needed..

1159
01:30:49,519 --> 01:30:51,680
..and you're done for.

1160
01:30:54,024 --> 01:30:55,423
And this is that kick.

1161
01:30:59,463 --> 01:31:01,488
This is Mr. Adenwala's will.

1162
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:07,303
lt says you'll obtain
his entire property.

1163
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:15,037
And a huge insurance amount
is also mentioned in this.

1164
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,238
Yes!

1165
01:31:19,449 --> 01:31:20,507
Why are you so tensed?

1166
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:23,986
You should be happy. C'mon!

1167
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,121
Congratulations! Cheers! C'mon.

1168
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,588
Congratulations! Drink up!

1169
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,726
You.. you're joking. Let me see.

1170
01:31:39,002 --> 01:31:40,731
You've one night with you.

1171
01:31:43,306 --> 01:31:46,605
Because tomorrow morning,
l must show this to the police.

1172
01:31:48,278 --> 01:31:51,338
And Mr. Gokhale who has a
doubt on the third person..

1173
01:31:51,414 --> 01:31:53,473
..when he sees this..

1174
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:57,611
..he'll become emotional
and embrace you. Yes.

1175
01:31:59,022 --> 01:32:03,083
Then, keep seeing this
for your entire life.

1176
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:40,058
So, Mr. Gagre!
- Have a seat!

1177
01:32:41,798 --> 01:32:43,789
What's your name?
- Gangadhar.

1178
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:45,125
Gangadhar.

1179
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:48,137
Do you drink alcohol?
- No. l don't even touch it.

1180
01:32:48,338 --> 01:32:49,669
You may not be touching it at home.

1181
01:32:49,806 --> 01:32:51,330
l'm asking you since you're on duty.

1182
01:32:51,474 --> 01:32:54,136
No, never on duty.
- Never? - Never.

1183
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,268
Sure?
- Sure.

1184
01:32:55,345 --> 01:32:57,279
Swear?
- l swear! - Then drink it.

1185
01:32:59,215 --> 01:33:00,546
Yes!

1186
01:33:03,486 --> 01:33:06,819
How was it?
- Good. ls it foreign-made?

1187
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:11,151
Made in Scotland. - Oh, really?
lt tastes like it's made in foreign.

1188
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:14,826
Yes, Scotland has just been
launched in Satara.

1189
01:33:15,732 --> 01:33:18,166
Take this. Scotland has just
been launched in Satara..

1190
01:33:18,234 --> 01:33:20,759
..and Poland is about to
be launched in Poona.

1191
01:33:21,104 --> 01:33:22,162
You carry on.

1192
01:35:39,309 --> 01:35:40,367
Sir!

1193
01:35:42,245 --> 01:35:43,507
Sir, l didn't kill him!

1194
01:35:44,714 --> 01:35:46,739
He has committed suicide!
On his own!

1195
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:49,945
He has committed suicide?
- Yes.

1196
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,514
On his own?
- Yes.

1197
01:35:51,855 --> 01:35:55,313
As far as l know, suicide
is committed on one's own!

1198
01:35:55,658 --> 01:35:58,650
And he committed suicide!
And, on his own!

1199
01:35:58,728 --> 01:36:02,494
Sir, why would l kill him?
Why would l kill him?

1200
01:36:02,565 --> 01:36:03,759
Of course for money!

1201
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:05,266
When you came to know that..

1202
01:36:05,335 --> 01:36:06,393
..you were going to inherit
his property..

1203
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,334
Hey, l didn't know about the will!

1204
01:36:08,404 --> 01:36:09,462
l came to know it when you told me!

1205
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:10,597
Everyone knows about it!

1206
01:36:11,841 --> 01:36:13,001
He must have told you.

1207
01:36:13,877 --> 01:36:15,902
Oh no! He was such a fool!

1208
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,344
You saved my life, now you
take away everything.

1209
01:36:18,882 --> 01:36:21,442
Then you killed Mallika
and then killed him too.

1210
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,887
You fool! l'll call the police!
- No.

1211
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:30,022
l have the proof! l have the proof!

1212
01:36:30,693 --> 01:36:31,751
What proof?

1213
01:36:32,362 --> 01:36:34,023
l have the proof! l have his letter.

1214
01:36:34,798 --> 01:36:37,289
He has written in it that
he is committing suicide.

1215
01:36:37,367 --> 01:36:39,358
l am telling the truth!
- You are a liar!

1216
01:36:39,636 --> 01:36:42,434
Listen to me. Mallika!
lt was Mallika's plan!

1217
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,607
lt is true that he has
committed suicide.

1218
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:47,700
But Mallika wanted to prove
that he had been murdered.

1219
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:51,480
Murder!
- Yes! - What murder!

1220
01:36:52,382 --> 01:36:56,341
Because he had put a condition
in his insurance policy.

1221
01:36:56,653 --> 01:36:58,314
According to that the money
could be claimed..

1222
01:36:58,388 --> 01:37:00,720
..only when it is proved that
he had been murdered.

1223
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:02,451
And not if it is a suicide!

1224
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:03,753
l am telling the truth.

1225
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:07,889
And Mallika?
- Yes?

1226
01:37:09,332 --> 01:37:10,993
What was Mallika doing
there at that time?

1227
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:14,393
That.. l had tied her there.

1228
01:37:14,604 --> 01:37:17,334
According to our plan,
we were to prove that..

1229
01:37:17,407 --> 01:37:20,570
..the goons tied her
up and kidnapped sir.

1230
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:24,073
Why did you kill him then?

1231
01:37:24,147 --> 01:37:26,707
l did not kill him.

1232
01:37:27,517 --> 01:37:30,953
He died because of the strike
in Aarey milk colony.

1233
01:37:31,754 --> 01:37:32,880
l am telling the truth.

1234
01:37:39,963 --> 01:37:41,954
Then what was she doing?
What was she doing with you?

1235
01:37:43,867 --> 01:37:45,425
Do you know what the plan was?

1236
01:37:46,703 --> 01:37:49,365
l would get him out and..

1237
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:52,374
..place the gun he used to commit
suicide in one hand..

1238
01:37:52,442 --> 01:37:55,707
..and his suicide note
in the other hand.

1239
01:37:55,979 --> 01:37:58,072
Then l would fire it once
and go out.

1240
01:37:58,147 --> 01:38:00,047
Gadre would come out on
hearing the firing.

1241
01:38:00,116 --> 01:38:03,552
He would see that sir
has committed suicide.

1242
01:38:04,721 --> 01:38:06,552
That's it! That's it!

1243
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:12,026
lf it is proved to be a suicide,
you won't get any money.

1244
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:18,064
l don't want. l don't
want anything from him.

1245
01:38:18,735 --> 01:38:19,997
Are you telling the truth?
- l am telling the truth.

1246
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:21,468
l don't want anything.
- First, keep this gun aside.

1247
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:30,038
Sir! Sir, please save
me. Please save me.

1248
01:38:34,017 --> 01:38:38,113
Get that suicide note first,
l'll believe you only then.

1249
01:38:38,187 --> 01:38:40,485
Ok, ok, sir. Thank you.

1250
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:16,016
Thank you, Sher Singh.

1251
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:28,928
Oh!

1252
01:39:32,075 --> 01:39:37,877
Sir! Sir, take this.
lt is addressed to you.

1253
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,074
One minute..
- What happened?

1254
01:39:42,819 --> 01:39:46,550
One minute, did you hear any noise?
- No.

1255
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:50,857
One minute, there, there..

1256
01:39:53,563 --> 01:39:54,621
What happened now?

1257
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:58,155
Sir, sir, that Gadre,
Gadre is awake!

1258
01:39:58,835 --> 01:39:59,893
O my God!

1259
01:40:00,837 --> 01:40:01,895
Let's do one thing, his body..
- No, no!

1260
01:40:01,971 --> 01:40:04,098
Let's remove his dead
body and place it here.

1261
01:40:04,173 --> 01:40:05,231
No, no. Not yet!

1262
01:40:05,308 --> 01:40:07,640
He'll come any moment!
Please! Please!

1263
01:40:07,844 --> 01:40:10,244
We'll do it later. Come
here. Come to me.

1264
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:14,107
Sir, he'll come. Please sir!
Let's remove his dead body.

1265
01:40:14,183 --> 01:40:15,241
Come here. Come to me.

1266
01:40:16,853 --> 01:40:18,514
He'll come, sir. Please, sir!

1267
01:40:18,588 --> 01:40:21,250
Sign this.
- What's this?

1268
01:40:21,591 --> 01:40:23,115
lf he comes, everything
will be ruined.

1269
01:40:23,192 --> 01:40:24,250
What paper is this?

1270
01:40:24,527 --> 01:40:26,688
l am telling for your
benefit. Sign this.

1271
01:40:26,863 --> 01:40:28,262
This is a stamp paper, sir.

1272
01:40:28,598 --> 01:40:30,566
Yes! Haven't you ever
signed a stamp paper?

1273
01:40:30,633 --> 01:40:31,827
C'mon, sign this.

1274
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:34,699
Yes, but l should at least
know what is written on it.

1275
01:40:34,771 --> 01:40:36,534
Stupid! l am trying to save
you from the death sentence..

1276
01:40:36,606 --> 01:40:38,130
..and you are asking questions!

1277
01:40:38,207 --> 01:40:40,232
Do you think l am going to rob you?

1278
01:40:40,309 --> 01:40:43,608
No, no, no, sir.
l'll not sign it like this.

1279
01:40:44,881 --> 01:40:45,973
You won't sign?
- No.

1280
01:40:46,049 --> 01:40:47,539
lts ok, l'll call Gadre.

1281
01:40:47,884 --> 01:40:51,615
Why don't you allow me to
see what is written in it?

1282
01:40:51,687 --> 01:40:54,212
And why do you require my
signature all of a sudden?

1283
01:40:54,624 --> 01:40:57,559
Hey you! Just a while ago,
you were begging for your life..

1284
01:40:57,627 --> 01:41:01,290
..and now you are asking
me what's written in it! read

1285
01:41:13,176 --> 01:41:16,236
This.. this is
the power of attorney!

1286
01:41:16,913 --> 01:41:20,781
Yes! Your general power of
attorney in favor of me.

1287
01:41:22,185 --> 01:41:25,586
According to this, you Subhash
Sharma, are giving me..

1288
01:41:25,655 --> 01:41:27,589
..Mr. A. D. Merchant,
the authority to do..

1289
01:41:27,657 --> 01:41:30,649
..all that you can do.

1290
01:41:30,927 --> 01:41:31,985
What do you mean?

1291
01:41:32,061 --> 01:41:34,655
l mean l can even sign on
your behalf.

1292
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:37,331
l can also take the insurance
money on your behalf.

1293
01:41:44,207 --> 01:41:48,735
No, Mr. Merchant, l'll
not sign this. No.

1294
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,244
No?
- No.

1295
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:53,206
lt's okay.

1296
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:05,117
l have no other choice
than shooting you.

1297
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:12,634
l don't think you'll take
the risk of murdering me.

1298
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:14,894
Risk?
- Yes.

1299
01:42:14,971 --> 01:42:18,634
What risk? Milord,
he was tempering with..

1300
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:23,702
..Mr. Adenwala's corpse.
l caught him red handed.

1301
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:26,710
He also threatened to
kill me at gun point.

1302
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,718
But fortunately l got
hold of this gun.

1303
01:42:29,785 --> 01:42:33,118
And unfortunately for him,
the bullet got fired.

1304
01:42:35,057 --> 01:42:37,389
And that's all about the case.

1305
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:43,256
l understand now.

1306
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:49,333
According to the will,
l am entitled to inherit his money.

1307
01:42:50,006 --> 01:42:54,306
When? When it is proved
that he is murdered.

1308
01:42:56,078 --> 01:42:58,410
And now who will be proved
to be Adenwala's murderer!

1309
01:43:00,016 --> 01:43:06,046
l, Subhash Sharma! And you've also
collected the suicide note.

1310
01:43:07,957 --> 01:43:13,054
So l lose the money as well as
my life by signing this paper!

1311
01:43:15,865 --> 01:43:19,995
No way! No! No!

1312
01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:24,433
Shall l ask you a question?

1313
01:43:25,775 --> 01:43:27,436
You know the answer that's
why l am asking.

1314
01:43:28,044 --> 01:43:29,102
l know the answer?

1315
01:43:33,316 --> 01:43:37,218
Less risk and great benefit!

1316
01:43:38,788 --> 01:43:39,948
So what do you say?

1317
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:44,726
O my God!
- Tell me!

1318
01:43:46,195 --> 01:43:51,064
Chance! So you knew everything
beforehand..

1319
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:54,732
The partnership of 240 millions
is not just between..

1320
01:43:54,804 --> 01:43:56,465
..you and sister-in-law.

1321
01:43:57,073 --> 01:44:01,032
You stupid! lt was between
me and Mallika. - What!

1322
01:44:03,312 --> 01:44:04,472
You are only a horse.

1323
01:44:05,815 --> 01:44:09,478
When a horse wins the race,
the owners get the reward!

1324
01:44:09,819 --> 01:44:11,047
Not the horse, you donkey!

1325
01:44:11,387 --> 01:44:13,150
The horse gets only the grass!

1326
01:44:13,356 --> 01:44:15,984
And if the owner wishes,
something more.

1327
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:21,487
But Mr. Adenwala's suicide
note was with me..

1328
01:44:21,764 --> 01:44:23,163
With the help of that,
l could have..

1329
01:44:24,834 --> 01:44:27,826
lt was with you, the suicide note!
Now it's not with you.

1330
01:44:27,903 --> 01:44:29,768
Now it's with me.
lt's enough of playing around.

1331
01:44:29,839 --> 01:44:30,897
Now you sign this otherwise..

1332
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:34,170
Dad..
- Where has she come from?

1333
01:44:35,378 --> 01:44:37,505
No! No! Shanti, run! Run!

1334
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:40,845
Don't harm her. l'll sign
this. l'll sign this.

1335
01:44:41,384 --> 01:44:44,512
Leave her. l'll sign this.
Let her go, please.

1336
01:44:44,854 --> 01:44:49,791
Drop the gun! l say, drop the gun!

1337
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:53,985
Subhash! - Drop the gun.

1338
01:44:58,868 --> 01:45:00,199
Did you inform me?

1339
01:45:00,269 --> 01:45:02,134
Yes, you had given me the card.

1340
01:45:02,972 --> 01:45:05,406
Look, what he has done,
what he has done?

1341
01:45:05,474 --> 01:45:06,805
Me?
- Look at this, sir!

1342
01:45:09,812 --> 01:45:10,870
Look at this!

1343
01:45:10,946 --> 01:45:14,177
Look at this.
- Oh my God, who's this?

1344
01:45:14,383 --> 01:45:16,317
Mr. Mehra this is mr. Adenwala.

1345
01:45:16,385 --> 01:45:18,546
ls Mr. Aden is dead?
- Yes.

1346
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,386
Ask him. Ask him.

1347
01:45:21,157 --> 01:45:22,419
Why did he kill my master?

1348
01:45:22,491 --> 01:45:23,890
Sir, he killed Mr. Adenwala.

1349
01:45:23,959 --> 01:45:27,224
Look, what he's done to
my sir. Just have a look.

1350
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:29,557
Sir, he's the one who
killed Mr. Adenwala.

1351
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:33,897
Last night l heard; when l came
here and saw it was lawyer.

1352
01:45:33,969 --> 01:45:35,027
He's lying.

1353
01:45:35,104 --> 01:45:37,902
He was taking out my master's
corpse out of the deep freezer.

1354
01:45:37,973 --> 01:45:39,838
What?
- He got scared after seeing me.

1355
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:44,073
He says that if l do as he says,
he'll give me rupees 5 lakh.

1356
01:45:44,146 --> 01:45:47,240
Nonsense, scoundrel!
- Stop it! Stay there!

1357
01:45:48,451 --> 01:45:51,113
Sir, believe me. He's
killed both of them.

1358
01:45:51,187 --> 01:45:53,178
When l came here, l caught
him red-handed.

1359
01:45:53,255 --> 01:45:56,918
Yes, l caught him and he threatened
to kill me pointing the gun.

1360
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,357
And threatened Swati too.

1361
01:45:58,427 --> 01:46:01,021
He showed the gun and
threatened to kill me.

1362
01:46:01,097 --> 01:46:02,860
He asked me to help him
to take out..

1363
01:46:02,932 --> 01:46:05,400
..sir's corpse and
keep it in the car.

1364
01:46:06,135 --> 01:46:08,194
He said that he would give
rupees 1 lakh more to me.

1365
01:46:08,471 --> 01:46:10,939
He said that he will get his
daughter married to me as well.

1366
01:46:11,006 --> 01:46:12,940
Daughter? l am not even married.

1367
01:46:13,008 --> 01:46:15,943
So, l got a chance and
called you up.

1368
01:46:16,011 --> 01:46:18,479
Sir, it was his idea.
Now, he is lying.

1369
01:46:18,948 --> 01:46:21,143
Sir, he has some papers in his hand.

1370
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:22,940
Papers? What papers?

1371
01:46:23,018 --> 01:46:25,486
He was saying it as some will.

1372
01:46:26,222 --> 01:46:27,348
Show me the will.

1373
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:29,448
Sir, l..
- Show me the will!

1374
01:46:29,525 --> 01:46:32,494
Mr. Gokhale l'll tell you the whole
story right from the beginning.

1375
01:46:32,561 --> 01:46:34,119
But you please don't listen to him.

1376
01:46:34,196 --> 01:46:36,027
Shut up, show me the papers.

1377
01:46:49,311 --> 01:46:50,471
This is Mr. Adenwala's will.

1378
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:55,174
He's transferred the whole property
in your name. - My name?

1379
01:46:57,253 --> 01:47:00,222
Sir has transferred his
property in my name?

1380
01:47:02,525 --> 01:47:03,992
What are you saying, sir?

1381
01:47:05,261 --> 01:47:08,628
That was the reason, this
man was after me.

1382
01:47:09,265 --> 01:47:11,927
l don't want this will,
give this to him.

1383
01:47:12,001 --> 01:47:13,059
l don't want this.

1384
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,329
Hey, don't play a charade here.

1385
01:47:14,403 --> 01:47:15,927
Sir, he's murdered Mr. Adenwala.

1386
01:47:16,005 --> 01:47:17,438
But why will he murder him?

1387
01:47:17,506 --> 01:47:19,997
He'll murder him for the will,
as he'll get the whole property.

1388
01:47:20,075 --> 01:47:22,009
But l don't know anything
about the will.

1389
01:47:22,077 --> 01:47:24,068
No. You told me about this.
l came to know only then.

1390
01:47:25,014 --> 01:47:27,949
Ok, tell me one thing.
This is the same envelope..

1391
01:47:28,017 --> 01:47:32,010
..that l had asked you to read
in front of me, am l right?

1392
01:47:32,087 --> 01:47:34,351
Maybe.. sometime ago..

1393
01:47:34,423 --> 01:47:36,448
lf you opened it and
read it, am l right?

1394
01:47:36,525 --> 01:47:37,651
Sir, let me explain.

1395
01:47:37,726 --> 01:47:39,956
When l asked you about
Adenwala's will..

1396
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:41,963
..you said you didn't
know anything about it.

1397
01:47:42,031 --> 01:47:43,089
Let me explain. Let me explain.

1398
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:44,223
Am l right?
- Ok! You are right!

1399
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:47,128
But the question is not that
who opened it and who read it.

1400
01:47:47,203 --> 01:47:49,330
The question is who
committed the murder!

1401
01:47:49,405 --> 01:47:50,497
Find that out first!

1402
01:47:51,307 --> 01:47:53,969
Sir! Sir, this is the paper..

1403
01:47:54,043 --> 01:47:57,035
..he was getting me
to sign forcefully.

1404
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:00,039
This is the paper.

1405
01:48:00,316 --> 01:48:03,479
This is the power of attorney
in favor of Mr. Merchant.

1406
01:48:03,552 --> 01:48:06,180
Does the power of attorney
mean some electricity bill?

1407
01:48:06,255 --> 01:48:07,313
No, no.

1408
01:48:07,389 --> 01:48:08,981
This means he can do anything..

1409
01:48:09,058 --> 01:48:11,458
..that you can, on your behalf.

1410
01:48:11,527 --> 01:48:12,585
On my behalf?
- Yes.

1411
01:48:13,062 --> 01:48:15,257
Like there is a mention of
insurance money in this..

1412
01:48:15,331 --> 01:48:17,561
Yes. - He can claim the
money of your insurance.

1413
01:48:18,167 --> 01:48:19,225
lnstead of me?
- Yes.

1414
01:48:19,568 --> 01:48:22,332
l have no insurance..
not even a ration card.

1415
01:48:22,404 --> 01:48:23,462
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1416
01:48:23,672 --> 01:48:26,072
Merchant, can you explain this?

1417
01:48:26,141 --> 01:48:27,199
Yes, l can explain everything, sir.

1418
01:48:27,276 --> 01:48:28,607
How can you explain this?

1419
01:48:28,677 --> 01:48:31,009
Why do you need his sign on
this power of attorney?

1420
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,072
Sir, sir, this is nothing.
He is trying to fool you.

1421
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:36,413
Sir, he is calling you a fool.

1422
01:48:36,485 --> 01:48:38,077
Oh! l am a fool.

1423
01:48:38,587 --> 01:48:42,079
l am looking for the third man,
but he is right here!

1424
01:48:42,157 --> 01:48:43,624
Sir, will you believe this rogue?

1425
01:48:43,692 --> 01:48:45,751
How was your relation with Mallika?

1426
01:48:45,828 --> 01:48:47,523
lt's none of your business, okay?

1427
01:48:47,596 --> 01:48:48,756
l'll take this up to the
higher authorities.

1428
01:48:51,433 --> 01:48:53,264
How was his relation with Mallika?

1429
01:48:53,669 --> 01:48:58,629
How will you catch a person
who is so smart?

1430
01:48:59,608 --> 01:49:01,439
He didn't spare even sister-in-law.

1431
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:04,104
Hey, did they meet each other?

1432
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,043
When he came to drop Swati,
sister-in-law had gone out with her.

1433
01:49:08,117 --> 01:49:09,175
What do you mean?

1434
01:49:09,652 --> 01:49:11,347
Relax! Where did you go?

1435
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,388
l don't have to tell you!
- Reply!

1436
01:49:13,455 --> 01:49:14,649
Chinese restaurant, so what?

1437
01:49:14,723 --> 01:49:16,054
The husband is lying
sick and you went..

1438
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:18,389
..to Chinese restaurant
with his wife!

1439
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,655
Husband, wife and the Manchurian!

1440
01:49:20,729 --> 01:49:22,594
Shut up! You just shut up!

1441
01:49:22,665 --> 01:49:26,123
Sir, he is not as stupid as he
seems to be. He is very smart.

1442
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:28,065
Sir, we headed for
the nursing home..

1443
01:49:28,137 --> 01:49:30,264
..and he went there
instead of Adenwala.

1444
01:49:30,339 --> 01:49:31,533
Adenwala was in the deep freezer.

1445
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:32,665
What do you mean?

1446
01:49:32,741 --> 01:49:35,710
Yes, he had gone wearing
his clothes. Ask him.

1447
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:40,147
Sir, when he went there,
l was here. You can ask Swati.

1448
01:49:40,215 --> 01:49:42,274
Swati, tell them where l was.

1449
01:49:43,652 --> 01:49:44,812
Yes, Subhash was here.

1450
01:49:45,154 --> 01:49:49,147
Swati! So.. sir, she is lying.

1451
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:54,422
Sir..
- Oh!

1452
01:49:56,432 --> 01:49:58,229
Give me the car keys. - Sir..

1453
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,699
Give me the car keys.

1454
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:06,766
Suitcase?

1455
01:50:10,646 --> 01:50:12,113
Sir, we have found this
overcoat, muffler..

1456
01:50:12,181 --> 01:50:13,273
..and the monkey coat
from the car's dickey.

1457
01:50:13,682 --> 01:50:15,616
These clothes were found
in my dickey?

1458
01:50:16,452 --> 01:50:19,182
Not in your dickey, sir,
in your car's dickey.

1459
01:50:20,689 --> 01:50:21,849
What do you think of this?

1460
01:50:22,191 --> 01:50:23,488
How would l know
where they came from?

1461
01:50:24,126 --> 01:50:25,184
This is his ploy.

1462
01:50:25,461 --> 01:50:28,123
Darkness, muffler, overcoat,
monkey coat..

1463
01:50:28,197 --> 01:50:31,462
..everything fits well.

1464
01:50:31,533 --> 01:50:35,401
So what? - l arrest you for
the murder of Adenwala.

1465
01:50:35,471 --> 01:50:38,531
Are you out of your mind?
On what basis?

1466
01:50:38,607 --> 01:50:41,542
ls this a proof? ls this a proof?
l don't understand!

1467
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:42,770
Take him to the police station.

1468
01:50:43,212 --> 01:50:44,645
Come, come, come.

1469
01:50:44,713 --> 01:50:50,879
No! No! l didn't kill anyone. No!

1470
01:50:52,221 --> 01:50:53,745
Adenwala has not been murdered
at all! - What!

1471
01:50:53,822 --> 01:50:54,880
What nonsense are you talking?

1472
01:50:54,957 --> 01:50:57,790
He has committed suicide on his own!

1473
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:00,226
He would certainly commit
suicide on his own!

1474
01:51:00,295 --> 01:51:01,694
He cannot appoint anyone for that!

1475
01:51:01,764 --> 01:51:03,163
Shut up! Shut up!

1476
01:51:03,232 --> 01:51:04,324
What evidence do you have?

1477
01:51:09,171 --> 01:51:10,229
What is this?

1478
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:12,169
Adenwala has written a letter that..

1479
01:51:12,241 --> 01:51:14,300
..he was going to commit
suicide on his own.

1480
01:51:15,611 --> 01:51:16,737
Suicide note?

1481
01:51:25,521 --> 01:51:27,785
And Subhash and Mallika
knew about this.

1482
01:51:27,856 --> 01:51:30,916
They hid it just to claim
the insurance money. Read it.

1483
01:51:34,363 --> 01:51:38,265
Are you out of your senses?
This is a blank paper.

1484
01:51:40,202 --> 01:51:48,803
A blank paper.
l can't read anything.

1485
01:51:49,545 --> 01:51:50,603
You try to read it.

1486
01:51:53,215 --> 01:51:54,842
Subhash!

1487
01:52:53,342 --> 01:52:54,400
Hi!

1488
01:52:56,945 --> 01:52:59,345
Wow! What a color!
- Yes!

1489
01:52:59,414 --> 01:53:00,676
What is the name of the bungalow?

1490
01:53:00,749 --> 01:53:02,842
Subhash Villa or Subhash Sadan?

1491
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:04,813
l haven't yet thought about it.

1492
01:53:04,887 --> 01:53:06,320
And what about the insurance claim?

1493
01:53:06,622 --> 01:53:09,352
lt has passed.
- Wow! Congratulations!

1494
01:53:09,424 --> 01:53:10,482
Thanks. Come.

1495
01:53:10,893 --> 01:53:13,487
ls the phone out of order?
- No, it's working. Why?

1496
01:53:13,562 --> 01:53:15,826
No, l thought the phone
is out of order.

1497
01:53:15,898 --> 01:53:18,366
l think all the phones in
Mumbai are out of order.

1498
01:53:18,801 --> 01:53:20,632
Couldn't you call me even once?

1499
01:53:22,704 --> 01:53:27,641
Swati, l wanted to call
you so desperately but..

1500
01:53:27,709 --> 01:53:28,835
But what?

1501
01:53:30,646 --> 01:53:32,910
You know, Swati,
l want to tell you everything.

1502
01:53:32,981 --> 01:53:34,039
The whole truth.

1503
01:53:34,383 --> 01:53:36,044
l don't want to hear anything.

1504
01:53:37,653 --> 01:53:40,315
Some philosopher has said that..

1505
01:53:40,389 --> 01:53:42,653
..behind every great fortune,
there is a crime.

1506
01:53:43,392 --> 01:53:48,056
Crime? - Yes. Behind every great
fortune, there is a crime.

1507
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:52,962
But l did not commit any crime
to get this fortune.

1508
01:53:53,035 --> 01:53:54,935
l didn't say that you
have committed a crime.

1509
01:53:56,672 --> 01:53:58,503
So you believe me?
- Believe?

1510
01:53:58,574 --> 01:54:01,065
Yes. - l know that you haven't
done any such thing.

1511
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:04,470
Thanks, Swati, really thanks.

1512
01:54:06,014 --> 01:54:08,346
As it is, sometimes behind
a great fortune..

1513
01:54:08,417 --> 01:54:10,851
..there is good luck too.
Good luck!

1514
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:12,945
What do you mean?

1515
01:54:13,021 --> 01:54:17,424
Like my luck!
- l didn't get you.

1516
01:54:18,026 --> 01:54:23,362
Subhash, when Mr. Adenwala headed
for nursing home from here..

1517
01:54:23,432 --> 01:54:29,496
..he was wearing your
shoes. These ones.

1518
01:54:39,982 --> 01:54:41,108
lsn't it my luck?

1519
01:54:43,952 --> 01:54:45,112
lsn't it, partner?

1520
01:55:06,942 --> 01:55:10,469
There is no strength and no speed.

1521
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:18,750
The breath has that feature,
it would take away your senses.

1522
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:22,153
Who is the great one here?

1523
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:48,439
The life is like night.
The night laughs at us.

1524
01:55:49,518 --> 01:55:52,715
Your cards change sometimes.

1525
01:55:53,655 --> 01:56:00,788
The life is like night.
The death laughs at us.

1526
01:56:01,797 --> 01:56:04,925
Your cards change in no time.

1527
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,868
Your heartbeats doubt you.

1528
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:16,042
Neither l call out,
nor do l doubt.

1529
01:56:17,012 --> 01:56:20,539
Who is the great one here?

1530
01:56:21,083 --> 01:56:24,484
Who is the great one here?

1531
01:56:25,053 --> 01:56:28,716
Who is the great one here?

1532
01:56:28,991 --> 01:56:34,088
The great, great, great one!

1533
01:56:49,578 --> 01:56:53,207
Everyone is changed here.

1534
01:56:53,582 --> 01:56:56,915
Everyone changed their ways.

1535
01:56:57,853 --> 01:57:05,123
Don't trust anyone,
you'll be betrayed.

1536
01:57:05,193 --> 01:57:12,827
Neither you are a sage
nor am l a saint.

1537
01:57:13,035 --> 01:57:16,596
Who is the great one here?

1538
01:57:17,139 --> 01:57:20,597
Who is the great one here?

1539
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:24,545
Here, here, here, the great one!

1540
01:57:25,113 --> 01:57:29,573
The great, great, great one!

1541
01:57:29,651 --> 01:57:33,553
Hiding from us, being a beloved..

1542
01:57:33,622 --> 01:57:37,114
..whom are you aiming at?

1543
01:57:37,626 --> 01:57:41,289
Move ahead from losing
and winning.

1544
01:57:41,897 --> 01:57:45,162
You are plotting!

1545
01:57:45,233 --> 01:57:51,172
Who is the great, great one here?

1546
01:57:53,642 --> 01:58:01,174
The life is like night.
The death laughs at us.

1547
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:04,983
Your cards change in no time.

1548
01:58:05,787 --> 01:58:09,154
Your heartbeats doubt you.

1549
01:58:09,224 --> 01:58:16,323
Neither you are a sage
nor am l a saint.

1550
01:58:17,132 --> 01:58:20,761
Who is the great one here?

1551
01:58:21,169 --> 01:58:24,764
Who is the great one here?

Here, here, here, the great one!

1553
01:58:28,877 --> 01:58:32,813
The great, great, great one!

1554
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:41,350
Who is the great one here?
