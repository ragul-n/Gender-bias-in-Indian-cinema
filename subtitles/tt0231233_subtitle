..aforesaid date and
bless the newly-wed couple.

00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:57,173
R.S.V.P. Trideepchandra Sarkar.

10
00:01:57,887 --> 00:01:59,356
Do you understand the condition..

11
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,592
..of this R.S.V.P.
Trideepchandra Sarkar?

12
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:03,372
Only two and half days are left.

13
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:04,843
And you got the cards printed today!

14
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:07,577
Sir, finding the card took time.

15
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,545
Finding the card took
time in the city of Kolkata?

16
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:12,692
No, sir. Had to bring
from Bombay by air parcel, sir.

17
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:15,116
Look here, what a velvet finish, sir.

18
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,963
This kind of card had
come to Kolkata only for once.

19
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,729
For the wedding of sir Gopen's niece.

20
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:23,287
We supplied, it sir.
- Enough! Showing me card!

21
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:26,159
Five hundred cards
have to be distributed now!

22
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,572
They are not Tom,
Dick and Harry like you!

23
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,716
If the least of mistake
happens in the invitation..

24
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,732
..that's it; I won't be getting
even one tender for the year.

25
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:45,514
What's the matter?

26
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,554
Next Wednesday is
my daughter's wedding.

27
00:02:48,798 --> 00:02:52,180
Your presence is requested
at my house that evening, sir.

28
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:58,612
But, I don't go anywhere
for social invitations, Mr. Trideep.

29
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:02,914
You'll have to keep my request, sir.
- You know what.

30
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,102
All the tenders for
next year have been called.

31
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:09,670
Now if I go for any function
to any of the parties (clients)..

32
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,456
..there are other contractors;
they could think otherwise.

33
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,323
Shame.. shame.. shame; even
listening to this is a big sin, sir.

34
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,034
A religious man like you
will go and bless my daughter.

35
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,766
Why is the tender being
involved in this, sir?

36
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:28,181
All right,
I will try but I cannot promise.

37
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,571
No, sir not try you
will have to come for once.

38
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:32,021
My house is towards the station..

39
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:34,768
..from the turning at Dhakuria..
- I know.. I know.'

40
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:36,410
I do visit that place sometime.

41
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:39,640
Okay, sir.
Okay, sir so then I will leave. - Bye.

42
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:48,113
Mr. Chaudhary? - No he
has not come back from court yet.

43
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:48,729
Oh I see.

44
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,115
Well next Wednesday evening is Mr.
Trideep Sarkar's..

45
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:52,838
..daughter's wedding at his place.

46
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:55,642
So the four of you,
means you both and your sons.

47
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:58,878
Be there for the
wedding and have dinner.

48
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:00,831
Here is your card.

49
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:07,155
Oh, next Wednesday evening?
- 'Yes, sir.'

50
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,140
Isn't the next one number forty one;
Mr. Nagen's house?

51
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,649
No, that is seventeen by two;
Sudhanshu Gupta's house.

52
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,642
Oh I see. The numbers are
messy here in your locality.

53
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:19,483
Yes that is. - Okay I'll leave.

54
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:38,666
Gentleman,
where is house number forty one?

55
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,106
No idea.

56
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,257
Gentleman. - Yes tell me?

57
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,736
Where is house number forty one?
- Number forty one?

58
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:10,097
Yes old garden? - Straight
ahead there's a lane on right.

59
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,457
It's on that lane. - On the lane.

60
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,308
Well, number forty
one is found at last.

61
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:46,558
'Who's it?'

62
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,448
As are the streets so are the numbers.

63
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,535
After five is twenty five,
after twenty five is thirty seven.

64
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,615
Next Wednesday, you both husband
wife and both your daughters..

65
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:06,769
Whom do you want?

66
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:11,440
Oh ho. No I mean,
you both sisters, and your parents..

67
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,337
Trideep Sarkar of house number one..

68
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,419
..his daughter's wedding at his house;
you all are invited.

69
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,276
We are invited..

70
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,698
..in Mr. Trideep's house?

71
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,125
Yes.

72
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:29,408
Your card.. Perhaps I've forgotten
the card. Okay I'll bring it later.

73
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:31,368
The thing is that you
all are coming next Wednesday.

74
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,818
And you'll be kind
to have dinner there.

75
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,876
You come inside; I'll call father.

76
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:40,858
Be seated.

77
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,486
Father. - 'What is it?'

78
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,597
Come for a while. - 'Coming.'

79
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:51,166
What's the matter?
- He is saying something.

80
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,203
'Greetings.' - Greetings.

81
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:56,523
But why are you standing?
Be seated. - No I won't sit now.

82
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:58,219
Next Wednesday is Mr.
Trideep's daughter's wedding.

83
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,722
Oh. - You all;
you both husband wife and both..

84
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,203
..your daughters are invited
for dinner at Mr. Trideep's place.

85
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,643
Very well; this is very happy news!

86
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:11,243
But I forgot your card.
- What's the need of the card?

87
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,883
You people have invited
we'll certainly go. - Okay.

88
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:15,941
Mr. Trideep's daughter's wedding?
- Yes, madam.

89
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,723
That house number one? - Yes.. yes.

90
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,723
Are you Mr. Trideep's relative?

91
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:21,203
Yes I am Mr. Trideep's..

92
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:24,482
Means Mr.
Trideep is my uncle. - Oh ho.. ho.

93
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:27,454
Okay I'll leave. - Okay.. okay.

94
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:32,162
It's surprising even to think.

95
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:35,572
A man like Mr.
Trideep has invited you?

96
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:38,972
Even if he is a wealthy man,
he's not proud. - It may be so.

97
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,532
But it doesn't seem that
he would know your name?

98
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,492
Well, he may not know that.

99
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:48,292
But I think he has invited
everyone in the locality.

100
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,212
So he got the names
of everyone from someone.

101
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,378
Would be so.

102
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,218
At least fifty people were
hunting for their daughters.

103
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:59,895
Is it an easy job to
snatch the groom from them?

104
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,218
But I got some relief.

105
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:06,698
I heard that Shaileshwar is a friend
of my sister-in-law's son Ashesh.

106
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:08,777
I took advantage of this opportunity..

107
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:12,658
..and I enticed them that I'll pay
all the money for the foreign trip.

108
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:16,082
That's it; the fish was hooked!

109
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:22,019
Hey, tell aunt to send some tea!
I'm tired of walking.

110
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,703
You got so late? - Won't I get late?

111
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:28,288
The old garden street is a riddle.

112
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,698
And the most difficult was to find Mr.
Nagen of number forty one.

113
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,100
Did you go to Mr.
Nagen's house? - Yes.

114
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,183
You didn't meet him; was Mr.
Nagen's wife at home?

115
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,061
Yes Mr. Nagen's wife was there, Mr.
Nagen's daughter was there.

116
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:39,275
But I didn't meet you?

117
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,333
'I left house just now
and came straight here.'

118
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:48,112
How is this possible?

119
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,123
Did you go to house number forty one?

120
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,516
Yes.

121
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:56,250
I guess you didn't go to
house number one of forty one.

122
00:08:56,595 --> 00:08:58,068
Husband wife and two daughters.

123
00:08:58,618 --> 00:08:59,698
No, sir.

124
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,536
Then I perhaps made a mistake.

125
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,255
Comedy of errors!

126
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,376
Anyway, finally it's
known that the four..

127
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:13,376
..people from my
house have been invited.

128
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:16,889
You do not worry for
the formality in vain.

129
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,923
No.. no, is that ever possible?!

130
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,476
One has to be given the
prestige that one deserves.

131
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,915
Otherwise it is self disrespect.

132
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:25,468
Ashesh, take one more trouble.
- Tell me?

133
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,350
You go to Mr. Nagen's house right now.

134
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,021
Meet his wife and give
the invitation formally.

135
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,390
Well that house number
one of forty one.

136
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,310
Which side is your house from that?
- On the left.

137
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,150
On the left.
- There's a garage on the side.

138
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,310
You'll recognize it on seeing.

139
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,430
Okay then I'll leave, Mr.
Trideep. - Listen.. listen.

140
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,590
Well the gentleman
who got invited by mistake.

141
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,950
I mean who lives in house
number one of forty one.

142
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,829
It seems that you know him.
Who is the man?

143
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,630
I mean is he respectable
enough to have my invitation?

144
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,430
Respectable, means..
- Does he pay income tax?

145
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,030
I mean is he quite well to do?
- Just the opposite.

146
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,590
What?! - You mean a cheap man?

147
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:01,339
Ordinary poor gentleman;
lives in a rented house.

148
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,670
Perhaps he is a teacher.
Okay I'll leave.

149
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,537
Shame, Ashesh.

150
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,332
Did you really mind it?

151
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:13,598
Yes I did a little.

152
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,150
Four cheap people will
come and have dinner at my place.

153
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,898
This is certainly not
any matter of concern for me.

154
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:21,189
The question is about my prestige.

155
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,829
Look, it's my minor mistake.

156
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:27,950
I know perhaps it would
have been laughed at a little.

157
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,069
But you're thinking about prestige..

158
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,130
You're not able to understand, Ashesh.

159
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,990
Why should I invite just anyone?

160
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,229
This Mr.
Nagen, I invited him; but why?

161
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,710
He is the income tax inspector.
So I keep flattering him.

162
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,590
Because it's unpredictable
when I'll need his help.

163
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,950
If I invite someone
in vain whom I don't need..

164
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,709
..then he will think
that I'm flattering him!

165
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,083
What's the harm in that? - Much harm.

166
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,950
It will harm my prestige.
It will harm the prestige of the..

167
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,630
..reputed women who'll
come to my house.

168
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,830
And it will harm the teacher as well.

169
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,829
A false pride will
be injected into him.

170
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:09,469
I didn't know, the rules
of the world are so distinctive.

171
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,670
You didn't know that's
why you made a mistake.

172
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,670
Now go and mend the mistake.

173
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,095
How?

174
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,550
Go to that teacher's house and..

175
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:21,347
..tell him that he
was invited by mistake.

176
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,070
This doesn't look good, uncle.

177
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,333
If you argue I'll again
suffer inconvenience, Ashesh.

178
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,030
Why should I invite someone,
whom I don't need?

179
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,950
Moreover if there is
no motive in the actions and..

180
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,829
..speech of people then
it is considered insanity.

181
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,239
Okay.

182
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,830
All right I'll go and say.

183
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,034
Who's it?

184
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,535
Kindly will you call
your father for once?

185
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:19,775
Father! - 'What is it?'

186
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:25,215
What's the matter? Hey, you?

187
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,694
So why are you standing outside, son?

188
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,255
No I'll say something
and go that's why..

189
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,695
That's why you are standing outside?

190
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:34,895
Well how foolish you are.
Come.. come; come inside.

191
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:37,895
Come.. come. Come and sit. Come.

192
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:42,054
Hey, bring tea. Sit.. sit.. sit.

193
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,163
The reason I came back, is actually..

194
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:56,156
'Why are you being so
impatient?' Have some tea, relax.

195
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:58,269
Then I'll hear everything. - Tea?

196
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:01,283
Yes. - Tea at this unusual time?

197
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,323
Oh no.. no this is
not an unusual time.

198
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,478
The tea was ready.

199
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:10,563
At night I don't take anything
apart from tea and a piece of bread.

200
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,723
You know it's better to
eat the minimum at this age.

201
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:15,992
What you said is almost right.

202
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:19,711
I know a little about all
these matters; I'm a doctor.

203
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:21,536
'Oh I see!'

204
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,411
So; now understand
if I say right or not.

205
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,698
They think that I
eat less deliberately.

206
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,198
But there should be
a limit to eating less.

207
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:34,242
Only a cup of tea and
a bread will increase..

208
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:35,816
..the chances of low blood pressure.

209
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:41,948
Now? - Now what? I can tell
about your bad habit as well.

210
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:45,693
Well I remember.
Your name.. - Ashesh Rai.

211
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:49,243
Okay, Ashesh you say,
is it good for health..

212
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,694
..to keep awake and
study till late at night?

213
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:52,837
Certainly not.

214
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,750
Well what's the reason to keep awake..

215
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,030
..and study so late at night?

216
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,950
She is appearing for B.A.
exams this year.

217
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,978
She's doing her honors in philosophy.

218
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,350
Tea is over.
Now about the disobedience..

219
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,089
..of my younger
daughter Triloka.. - No.

220
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,169
This girl is very
disobedient you know.

221
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:21,885
She can dance very well.

222
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:26,350
So I say that if you dance
like that without drinking milk..

223
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,822
..properly then you'll fall sick.
Isn't it so? - That's true.

224
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:35,820
You know,
son I respect your uncle a lot.

225
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,826
Well, some people say
that he is a very egoistic man.

226
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,706
But I don't feel so at all.

227
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:44,386
If it is so than why
would he invite a man like me?

228
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:47,826
'Like this Biman Chaudhary
an ordinary man..

229
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:50,185
..for his daughter's wedding?'

230
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:56,689
Look, the matter
for which I came, is..

231
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:02,826
..I mean.. I mean..there has
been a very embarrassing mistake.

232
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:13,866
I invited you all by mistake.

233
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,826
You people have no invitation
to Trideep Sarkar's house.

234
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:25,466
I mistook yours for Mr.
Nagen's house.. - 'Oh say that!'

235
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:30,266
What's there to be
so embarrassed, son?

236
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,226
No.. no you don't
be embarrassed at all.

237
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:34,706
Hey everyone could make this mistake.

238
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,826
Look, you go and tell your uncle..

239
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,545
..that we won't mind anything. No.

240
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:43,346
Okay. Okay so I'll leave today.
- Okay, son. Bye.. bye.

241
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:49,266
How funny. Look she's laughing.

242
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:51,466
Come, let's go inside.

243
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,222
'Hey will the tent be done properly?'

244
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,039
'Don't worry at all, sir.'

245
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:24,559
The way I'll make it,
people will be wonderstruck.

246
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,119
Take care, man;
all reputed people have been invited.

247
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,817
Master's reputation shouldn't
get harmed in front of them.

248
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,159
Don't worry at all, you may leave.

249
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,439
Hey Gedu, son, pull it and tie it.

250
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:39,319
'Leave the middle one, son.
Why didn't you bring Korunno?'

251
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,759
'Bring two extra men
and wrap the bamboos.'

252
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,718
'Leave a hole in between;
chandeliers will hang there.'

253
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,959
'Pull a little, son.'

254
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,919
'No matter what you people say,
sister-in-law.'

255
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,039
'I had been to so
many wedding houses.'

256
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:07,039
'But I have not seen anybody
who bought such nice things.'

257
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,884
Look here; this set alone
costs three thousand rupees.

258
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,039
Don't forget whose daughter
is getting married.

259
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:14,559
Brother says;
if people don't get dazzled..

260
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:17,118
..then what is the
need to spend money?'

261
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,919
Here you are, Ashesh.
I was searching for you.

262
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,279
Look, we won't get time
to breathe tomorrow morning.

263
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,559
So I was thinking
of sitting with you and..

264
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:46,359
..decide how to welcome
the guests tomorrow.

265
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,839
Okay, you go I'll come.

266
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,559
And yes look it's
good that you cancelled..

267
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,559
..the invitation to the teacher,
understand.

268
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,799
If a cheap man would have entered
among so many respectable guests..

269
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,639
..the situation would have
become very delicate, isn't it?

270
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,820
Okay then you come.

271
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,975
'Excuse me.' - Who's it?

272
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,380
You; at this hour?

273
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:38,000
I was compelled to
come and disturb you again.

274
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:44,823
I'll say a few simple
words and go away.

275
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,397
People get annoyed
if you come to say..

276
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:49,750
..even a few simple words at midnight.

277
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,192
I know that.

278
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:55,590
And moreover I came prepared
for your rude words.

279
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:58,883
Saying the truth is not rude words,
Mr. Ashesh.

280
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,559
Okay look,
in the time you took to say so much..

281
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,450
..I'd have finished
speaking by that time.

282
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,229
And I could have gone with peacefully.

283
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:26,129
Tell me?

284
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,562
Tomorrow you people please
come to our house in Alipore.

285
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,318
Why? - You people are invited.

286
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:35,210
Invited? - Yes.

287
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:39,264
Why? - Ah..
assume that it's just like that.

288
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:42,657
My sister Sudha's birthday
happened a few days ago.

289
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,857
Anyway I'll make an excuse and say
on the occasion of Sudha's birthday.

290
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,577
Look, Mr. Ashesh perhaps
you think you are very clever.

291
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:55,417
Yes.. yes.. Suddenly?

292
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:58,976
You believe that on getting invited..

293
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:00,777
..at rich people's place like you..

294
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,177
..people like us will
immediately run for eating.

295
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:08,257
Look.. well, people like
you often come to our house?

296
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,462
Now my sister Sudha;
her new friends always keep coming.

297
00:22:11,777 --> 00:22:13,657
And I too go to so
many places and eat.

298
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,057
What's extraordinary about this?

299
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,857
But why are you inviting me?

300
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:21,976
You can understand;
because of my mistake..

301
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:23,521
..the insult you people faced today..

302
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:26,856
Insult?

303
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:28,857
What insult?

304
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,255
I invited and then backed off.
It's a shame.

305
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,057
We'll be belittled on not getting..

306
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,777
..an invitation from
Trideep Sarkar's house?

307
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:39,857
We don't have such strange beliefs.

308
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,457
I'm unable to make you
understand my point properly.

309
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:44,982
What do I gain by
understanding your point?

310
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,097
You'll go to our house.

311
00:22:47,854 --> 00:22:49,577
Look I am just a messenger.

312
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:51,057
It's uncle's daughter's wedding.

313
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,381
He'll decide whom to
invite and whom not to.

314
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:55,657
I'm just supposed
to do as I am ordered.

315
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,777
That's why you got upset. - Correct.

316
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:00,216
So then say that you'll
come to our house.

317
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:07,872
Instead..
instead if I say that rather you..

318
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,657
..come to our house and eat something?

319
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:14,048
Very well, fine.
- Fine. Then you are invited tomorrow.

320
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:15,976
Okay. But tell me that you..
I mean you people..

321
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:18,559
..don't have anymore
misconceptions about me.

322
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,296
No. - Okay then I'll leave.

323
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,612
'Listen, Mr. Ashesh.'

324
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:33,254
Want to say something?

325
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:37,144
Will you surely come tomorrow?
- Yes of course.

326
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,988
But I won't be present tomorrow.
- You may not.

327
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:45,228
But I will come on
time eat and go away.

328
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:50,039
You'll come even after
knowing I won't be present.

329
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,122
Yes, of course.

330
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:03,068
It's very late night, Mr.
Ashesh. - Oh yes; I'll leave.

331
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:22,562
Look at this; this is called fortune.

332
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:25,322
I didn't expect to see
you here and you yourself..

333
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:27,722
..stood beside me
and supervised my meal.

334
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,522
And the people with whom
you hoped to chat so much..

335
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:31,962
..you didn't see them on coming here.

336
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:52,322
Really, I completely
forgot that today we are..

337
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:53,980
..supposed to go to
maternal uncle's place.

338
00:24:54,616 --> 00:24:57,785
But I invited you;
so I was compelled to stay back.

339
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,217
Got punished for inviting by mistake.

340
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,209
Oh wow; why punished?

341
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,513
While going father
and mother told me..

342
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:04,973
..that you shouldn't mind anything.

343
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,013
Oh what a trouble! Why should I mind!

344
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,813
I relished so much with pleasure.

345
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,893
Moreover I got an excuse
for coming once more.

346
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,653
Do you need an excuse
for coming once again?

347
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:17,893
Of course I do.

348
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:20,133
The way you made
me nervous last night.

349
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,812
So tell me what should I do?

350
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:24,170
A gentleman whom I got introduced
to only a few hours back..

351
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:27,413
..if he comes to the
window at midnight, then..

352
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,572
..he should be handed over to police.

353
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,533
You tell me, isn't it suspicious?

354
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,013
Well, I don't understand one thing.

355
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,773
Why did you invite
me after getting angry?

356
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:39,013
When I understood
that you are feeling..

357
00:25:39,093 --> 00:25:40,273
..bad for an ordinary mistake.

358
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:42,113
Just that?

359
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:47,253
Not just that. I saw.. I saw
that you are a very simple person.

360
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:48,464
That means?

361
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:53,099
That means I don't need to be afraid
of hearing anything bad from you.

362
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:55,748
What bad, Aloka Chaudhary?

363
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,502
Something that a person like you..

364
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:03,062
..should not say to a person like me.

365
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:08,562
Now I understand.

366
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:12,202
I see you are a very
serious kind of student.

367
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:15,226
Remains buried in books day and night.
- Certainly not.

368
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:18,741
But these thick books
are not supporting your words.

369
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,821
Shaileshwar Ghosh?

370
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,340
Which Shaileshwar Ghosh is this?

371
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:33,612
Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh.

372
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:36,413
No.. no I too know a Dr.
Shaileshwar Ghosh.

373
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:39,013
Lives on Suresh Mollik street.
- You know the right man.

374
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:43,083
But.. but your
acquaintance with him..?

375
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,158
Is he some relative of yours?

376
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:50,133
Not yet, but soon he will be.

377
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,293
How come?

378
00:26:52,363 --> 00:26:52,995
I mean..

379
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,843
I'll get married to him.

380
00:26:58,772 --> 00:26:59,861
Get married?

381
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:02,256
How come?

382
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:06,088
As every marriage happens.

383
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:08,977
No I mean..

384
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,133
I am Shaileshwar's
friend but I don't know.

385
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:15,573
You will come to know
when the time comes.

386
00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:20,159
Do your parents know about this?

387
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,201
Yes.

388
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:24,493
This marriage is happening
with father's will.

389
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:35,013
May I ask you something? - Tell me?

390
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,572
How long have you known Shaileshwar?

391
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:40,693
How did you come to know him?

392
00:27:42,197 --> 00:27:44,332
Mr. Shaileshwar was
my father's student.

393
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:47,776
Hence he often used
to visit our house.

394
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:50,612
To discuss the thesis.

395
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:54,412
So what if my father
is an ordinary school teacher?

396
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:57,812
In knowledge and wisdom
he is better than many others.

397
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,924
Then?

398
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,715
Father and Mr. Shaileshwar used to..

399
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:04,009
..discuss so much about
the points of the thesis.

400
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:05,773
And I use to sit and listen.

401
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,617
I used to feel..
I used to feel if I could..

402
00:28:08,697 --> 00:28:10,652
..provide any help
in this great cause..

403
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,293
..then I will consider myself worthy.

404
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:14,573
Coming to know about your feelings..

405
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,446
..Shaileshwar must
have jumped with joy.

406
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:18,478
Exactly.

407
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,099
What help did you provide?

408
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,013
I brought so many
good reference books..

409
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,213
..from the National library. - And?

410
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:29,132
Kept awake at night and
copied the notes of thesis.

411
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,087
And? - I even typed
the manuscript of the file.

412
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:36,130
Then?

413
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,397
Then.

414
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,812
Then it was the day
of submitting the thesis.

415
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:45,853
That day we were so happy.

416
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,853
We were returning home in a taxi.

417
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:54,031
'Today everything looks good to me.'

418
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,991
'The evening sky, the trees out there;
everything.'

419
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,351
'You've become a poet in a day I see.'

420
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:02,351
'Why not?' 'Today you've
submitted the thesis.'

421
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:05,151
'And a couple of days later,
you'll be Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh.'

422
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:10,831
'Come on, let's celebrate this day.'

423
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:14,591
'Fine, come to our house;
I'll cook delicious mutton for you.'

424
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:18,471
'Not to your house.
Let's go somewhere else. - Where?'

425
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,908
'Let's go.. to my flat.'

426
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:27,063
'Why there?'

427
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:30,991
'It's so inconvenient to
find you alone in your house.'

428
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:36,631
'Moreover, you never saw
how my house and things are.'

429
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,351
'I will see one day for sure.'

430
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:43,071
'So let your flat remain
unknown for these few days.'

431
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:47,751
'You'll see one day;
but seeing today is all wrong.'

432
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,670
'Moreover,
nobody is there at my house.'

433
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:56,311
'We both could.. chat in privacy.'

434
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:04,951
'What; shall I ask
to turn the car?' - 'No.'

435
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:09,231
'Oh.'

436
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:13,406
'So this is how much you trust me?'

437
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:17,951
'Mr. Shaileshwar,
why are you spoiling..

438
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:20,150
..this very joyous day in this way?'

439
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,791
'That day I could not keep his wish.'

440
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,271
'My heart got filled
with some unknown suspicion.'

441
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:38,827
I could not go. - Then?

442
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:42,763
After that day Mr.
Shaileshwar didn't..

443
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,551
..come to our house even for once.

444
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,440
Didn't you ever go to enquire?

445
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,027
I wrote a letter.

446
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:54,511
Didn't get any reply.

447
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,484
Does your father know this?

448
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:07,235
No.

449
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:12,431
He still believes Mr.
Shaileshwar will keep his promise.

450
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:19,772
Well, you are Mr.
Shaileshwar's friend.

451
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:22,671
If I make you a request..

452
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:26,560
..will you think I'm very shameless?

453
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:28,791
What request?

454
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,684
If you talk to Mr. Shaileshwar..

455
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:39,666
..if you go and tell him,
that Aloka wants to know..

456
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,873
..how long does she need
to keep waiting like this.

457
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:49,215
The marriage could
have happened this month.

458
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:53,870
If the marriage doesn't happen
this month, what's the harm?

459
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:56,325
'If the marriage never
happens?' - Mr. Ashesh!

460
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:25,725
'Wait.'

461
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:33,683
Going away without saying anything?

462
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:39,810
When I won't be of
any help to you; so..

463
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:43,963
You'll say a few words to Mr.
Shaileshwar on my behalf.

464
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,401
Is this very difficult?

465
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:52,326
Yes. Very difficult.

466
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,224
Fried mixture.

467
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,238
Fried mixture.

468
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:01,200
Ashesh you. Come.. come; come in.

469
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:03,068
Come in.. come in.. come in.

470
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,286
So then, what's the news?
You are not to be seen.

471
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:08,726
Whether I'm to be seen or
not you'll see on your wedding.

472
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:12,841
Sit.. sit.. sit. Tell me
what will you have; coffee, tea?

473
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:16,607
No thanks. - Okay, you sit;
I'll come in a moment.

474
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:33,364
So then, Ashesh;
tell me what's the news?

475
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:36,129
Come on, have a cigarette.

476
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:45,849
You look very happy?
- Shouldn't I look happy?

477
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,260
After all I'm getting
a wealthy father-in-law!

478
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:51,969
Well, Shaileshwar. - 'Yes?'

479
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:55,529
Do you know someone called
Biman Chaudhary in Old garden street?

480
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:00,237
Biman Chaudhary?

481
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,763
I heard you were
his student in school.

482
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,048
Oh, teacher? Yes.. yes.. yes; I know.

483
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:15,205
Then you must know his
daughter Aloka Chaudhary?

484
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,757
Why this topic suddenly?

485
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,984
No just like that.

486
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,751
Oh. I know.

487
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,299
I know means,
I used to go to their house sometimes.

488
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,295
'Radio Kolkata.' - Then the
girl served me tea a few times.

489
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,027
'Sitar was being played
by..' - Then we got acquainted.

490
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:37,120
'Indronil Bhattacharya.'
- Nothing else?

491
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:43,525
But Mr. Biman believes
that you will marry his daughter.

492
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:45,786
This is wrong of them, Ashesh.

493
00:35:46,805 --> 00:35:48,404
If I have tea a few
times in some house and..

494
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,285
..they think that I will
relieve them of their daughters..

495
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,725
..then I could not, go anywhere.

496
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,685
And if you yourself have
promised the girl? - That's a lie.

497
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:01,885
They could not prove this anyhow.

498
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:03,885
No, of course they could not.

499
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:07,405
If you had said
something to some girl..

500
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:11,285
..in the colorful light
of a taxi in the evening..

501
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,885
..then only your prudence
could have proven it.

502
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,405
And I feel you've
suppressed that because..

503
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:19,925
..you are getting
a wealthy father-in-law.

504
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:22,415
Okay, I'll leave.

505
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:25,667
Wait, Ashesh.

506
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:32,125
I hope you won't tell your
uncle about these false rumors.

507
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:34,324
No.. no; don't be afraid of that.

508
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:37,205
And even if I say
why should he believe it?

509
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,805
Just as you want to get
a wealthy father-in-law..

510
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:44,485
..he too wants to get
a doctorate son-in-law.

511
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:46,799
So that his reputation
grows a little more.

512
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:48,861
Okay.

513
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:24,555
Greetings. - Greetings.

514
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:26,674
Are you fine?

515
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,645
Come. - Welcome.. welcome.

516
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,932
Welcome.. welcome. Brought your son?

517
00:37:47,012 --> 00:37:48,972
He's out of station.
- Oh I see.. I see.

518
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,132
Welcome.
Welcome. - Has the groom come?

519
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:52,252
It's time now. Welcome.. welcome.

520
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:55,118
Listen, take them inside. Come.

521
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:06,694
Welcome, sir.

522
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,385
I'm so fortunate that
you've come to my house today.

523
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:13,055
But Mrs. Mukherjee didn't come?
- She is not well.

524
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:14,996
Oh ho. Welcome.. welcome.

525
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,519
Come.. come.

526
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:31,927
Come, sir.. come this way. Come.

527
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:37,892
Have a seat.

528
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:45,452
Look at the flattery.
- Flattery! It's grand flattery.

529
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:48,332
Without flattery he
won't be getting that..

530
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,692
..contract worth one lakh rupees.

531
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:54,012
I myself will serve your dinner, sir.

532
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,892
I won't take even a sweet, Mr.
Trideep.

533
00:38:57,476 --> 00:39:00,132
Outside home I don't
eat anything at all.

534
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:03,343
Look at me and have a little pity,
sir. - No, gentleman.

535
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,492
I couldn't kill myself
by taking pity on you.

536
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:10,412
I fall ill even if I smell
the food of a Bengali invitation.

537
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:11,790
So then..

538
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,419
Ah ha.. ha what are you doing,
gentleman?

539
00:39:22,585 --> 00:39:23,942
A fan is already there above my head.

540
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:26,834
No, sir it's very hot.
- Moreover I'll leave in a while.

541
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:29,623
I've to meet an honorable
gentleman in your locality.

542
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,177
You'll meet him here, sir.

543
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:32,977
All the honorable
gentlemen of the locality..

544
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:34,479
..have been invited;
nobody is left out.

545
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,857
Oh, so Mr. Biman is coming here.

546
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:40,305
What's the name you said, sir?
Mr. Biman?

547
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,679
Yes; Biman Chaudhary.

548
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:46,781
But I don't remember
anyone by that name..

549
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:48,179
..who has been invited.

550
00:39:50,857 --> 00:39:52,386
So what's the use of waiting in vain?

551
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,370
Come on; let me bless your daughter.

552
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:55,691
And proceed to Mr. Biman's house.

553
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:57,600
Ashesh.

554
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,723
'Listen.. listen, come here.'

555
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:04,511
Tell me what is the matter?

556
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:06,571
An honorable gentleman
named Mr. Biman..

557
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:08,452
..living in our locality
didn't get invited?

558
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,972
Who Mr. Biman;
that school teacher Mr. Biman?

559
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:12,612
Yes, the school teacher
Biman Chaudhary.

560
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:14,812
I call him Debotullo
(God like) Chaudhary.

561
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,572
Quite a few years ago,
I was coming to..

562
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:19,712
..the Kolkata head office
from our factory in Agartala.

563
00:40:20,372 --> 00:40:21,571
After getting down from
train and boarding the taxi..

564
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,812
..I found my cash bag was not with me.

565
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:27,294
Gentlemen, I kept blabbering
like a mad man whole night.

566
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:29,572
'In the morning I saw
an unknown gentleman..

567
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:32,452
..had come to meet me;
my cash bag was with him.'

568
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:33,859
'Not a paisa missing.'

569
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,852
I wanted to give him a
reward of five thousand rupees..

570
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,852
..and found that such
a man is still there on earth.

571
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:40,812
He must have not taken
that reward money for sure?

572
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:42,569
That's what I am saying.

573
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:46,056
Such a God like man is
in your locality and you don't..

574
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:48,622
..even know about him, Mr.
Trideep? Surprising.

575
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,580
No.. no why wouldn't I know, sir?

576
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,283
I didn't understand
initially that you are..

577
00:40:52,436 --> 00:40:55,087
..talking about our respected teacher.

578
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:57,341
Ashesh himself had
gone and invited him.

579
00:40:58,394 --> 00:40:59,100
No I didn't.

580
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:01,245
What?! What are you saying; why?

581
00:41:02,636 --> 00:41:04,545
You know better why
I didn't invite him.

582
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:11,807
Did you see, sir;
how these boys make mistakes?

583
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:13,007
What a terrible mistake.

584
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:15,160
Anyway, gentleman I'm going to Mr.
Biman myself.

585
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,846
You please sit for
a little while more, sir.

586
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:19,247
I myself will go
to respected Mr. Biman.

587
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:20,527
Ashesh made mistake.
I'll apologize for that..

588
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:22,007
..and bring him here right away.

589
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:23,995
Leave it; you don't need
to take the trouble. Moreover not..

590
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:27,127
..only Mr. Biman;
I need to meet his daughter also.

591
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:28,446
All of them are coming, sir!

592
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,589
I myself will bring them in my car.

593
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:34,127
I'll make them meet you,
will serve dinner myself.

594
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:35,411
And then I'll drop them home myself.

595
00:41:35,491 --> 00:41:37,127
You please be kind and
sit for a little more while, sir.

596
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:48,768
Tables are ready;
should I make people sit?

597
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:49,928
Yes.. yes make them sit.

598
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,608
Welcome, Mr. Biman.

599
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:02,128
'Today I'll introduce
you to such a person..

600
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,808
..that you will be completely
surprised.' - Aloka?

601
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:05,968
'Is it so?'

602
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:10,688
'Aloka.'

603
00:42:12,768 --> 00:42:14,892
That' why I wondered,
who's calling Aloka here.

604
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,999
You people here?

605
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:17,928
Your uncle insisted so much..

606
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:19,540
..that there was no way to refuse.

607
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:21,688
Triloka and mother
have not come back yet.

608
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:25,768
So I had to come with father.
- I have something to tell you.

609
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,368
Tell me? - Can't say it here;
come let's go outside.

610
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,808
Let's go outside; nearby.

611
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:38,008
Come. - Come.

612
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:52,786
Tell me what you want to say.

613
00:42:53,554 --> 00:42:54,779
Come on, let's take a walk.

614
00:42:56,231 --> 00:42:56,778
Suddenly?

615
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,124
Just like that.

616
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:04,250
That means? - No it means.. it means..

617
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:08,014
I have not told my story to you.
But I heard your story.

618
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:12,995
Is this story time?
- When will be the time for it then?

619
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:17,331
But what will you gain
by telling your story to me?

620
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:21,531
So then why did you
tell me your story?

621
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:22,816
What gain did you expect?

622
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,491
My story is full of sorrows.

623
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,677
Your story doesn't have
sorrows for sure I guess.

624
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,251
If I say it does?

625
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:36,731
Then what will I gain
by hearing your sorrows?

626
00:43:37,111 --> 00:43:38,511
I couldn't find any solution.

627
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:56,431
There comes the groom I suppose.

628
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:01,545
Yes perhaps the groom has come.
- Wow; let's go.

629
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,243
I've come to the wedding
and shouldn't I see the groom?

630
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,831
Rather you don't see him.

631
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:08,993
Tell me what your intention is.

632
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:11,367
I request you.

633
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:15,311
You've nothing to do
in the wedding. Rather..

634
00:44:15,871 --> 00:44:18,751
Rather? - Rather if you
trust me and take a walk..

635
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:21,745
..somewhere far off
then you'll be benefited.

636
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:25,051
Mr. Ashesh, you are daring too much!

637
00:44:26,443 --> 00:44:26,968
Let's go.

638
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:29,943
I request you.

639
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,164
What?

640
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:34,471
Come on, let's go to my house.

641
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:39,720
Your house is certainly
a very big house?

642
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:41,795
Not very small.

643
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:45,365
Certainly very beautiful?

644
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:48,271
Yes, you may say that.

645
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:51,751
Decorated with so many
expensive accessories?

646
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,108
Yes that's right.

647
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,750
So you believe that
Biman Chaudhary's daughter..

648
00:44:56,831 --> 00:44:58,587
..Aloka Chaudhary will
get impressed with your house?

649
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:00,314
Certainly not.

650
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:03,314
I don't believe that Aloka
Chaudhary is such an ordinary girl.

651
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:11,471
You.. you've put me at
great inconvenience. - Why?

652
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:16,502
If a girl goes out with a gentleman..

653
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:18,754
..whom she knows for just one day..

654
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:21,194
..then what will the gentleman
think about the girl..

655
00:45:21,274 --> 00:45:22,953
..and what would the
girl think about herself?

656
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:25,866
If you believe me;
that gentleman will..

657
00:45:25,946 --> 00:45:27,953
..not think anything
at all about that girl.

658
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:30,234
And will not say anything as such..

659
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,953
..to the girl which
disrespects her. Then?

660
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:37,074
No, then there's no
point in letting it grow.

661
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:38,794
There is.

662
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:41,954
You don't understand now;
you'll understand later.

663
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:47,074
It seems as if you are
trying to give some news?

664
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:49,553
Yes of course, news.

665
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:52,634
News about Mr. Shaileshwar?

666
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:55,074
Yes.. yes news about Mr. Shaileshwar.

667
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,394
Not bad news I suppose?

668
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:03,474
No why bad news?
- So then? So then did you meet him?

669
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,478
No I didn't meet him but.. - But?

670
00:46:08,883 --> 00:46:11,274
But I got news. - What news?

671
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:13,473
I won't tell the news here.

672
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:17,634
And if you do not agree to me,
then I won't tell at all.

673
00:46:20,963 --> 00:46:22,474
Fine, let's go.

674
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,722
What's the time?

675
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:04,708
Half past seven.

676
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,190
Half past seven?

677
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,630
Yes, perhaps the groom
has now sat on the dais.

678
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,667
Why are you so serious?

679
00:47:18,316 --> 00:47:19,375
I was thinking.

680
00:47:19,732 --> 00:47:20,651
What?

681
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,366
What is it about Mr. Shaileshwar..

682
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:29,630
..that you had to bring
me out of the wedding venue?

683
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,846
If not.. - If not?

684
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,110
No, Mr. Ashesh; I trust Mr.
Shaileshwar.

685
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,510
At least he will not break my trust.

686
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:06,227
He is so shy, what should I tell you?

687
00:48:06,307 --> 00:48:08,881
The day he came to see Nomi, I said;
Shaileshwar..

688
00:48:08,961 --> 00:48:12,397
..ask the girl whatever you
want to ask without hesitation.

689
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:14,987
Oh dear forget about asking.

690
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:18,667
He himself sat quiet looking
downwards as if he is the girl.

691
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,066
Come.

692
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:04,361
Come upstairs.

693
00:49:38,863 --> 00:49:39,942
Come.

694
00:49:52,183 --> 00:49:53,263
Be seated.

695
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:03,942
You sit for a while I'll
come in a moment. - But..

696
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:05,702
You please sit; I'll come in a moment.

697
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:29,369
Why have you brought me here?!

698
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:33,611
What do you want to do?!
- What.. what are you saying?

699
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:36,516
I want to know what is your
motive behind bringing me here!

700
00:55:36,596 --> 00:55:37,554
'Where're you, Ashesh?'

701
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,156
'Here, Minudi.'

702
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:48,132
Look, didn't I guess right?

703
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,764
Really, it seems you got scared.

704
00:55:51,844 --> 00:55:53,769
But it's not my fault;
it's because of them.

705
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:55,543
Said just coming..
just coming and took so long.

706
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:57,743
This Rama takes twenty
minutes only to wipe his face.

707
00:55:57,823 --> 00:55:58,649
Certainly not.

708
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,475
Tell me what to do?
I was cooking; can't leave it halfway.

709
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:08,647
What's your name?

710
00:56:11,664 --> 00:56:12,280
Aloka.

711
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:14,681
Please don't mind, Aloka.

712
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:18,189
No.. why should I mind?
- Seeing Ashesh's deeds.

713
00:56:18,466 --> 00:56:21,912
He has invited you;
but nothing is arranged here.

714
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:24,732
Mother has taken all
the maids and servants..

715
00:56:24,812 --> 00:56:26,658
..with her for working
in the wedding house.

716
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,612
This is Minudi;
sister of our locality.

717
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:31,892
But she is not any
less than my own sister.

718
00:56:32,249 --> 00:56:34,491
And this one is Rama,
and this is Bina.

719
00:56:34,705 --> 00:56:35,770
My sisters from the locality.

720
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:38,132
But in what way are they
less than my real sister?.

721
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:39,732
The thing is that you never forget..

722
00:56:39,812 --> 00:56:41,531
..to bring spiced peanuts for Sudha.

723
00:56:41,612 --> 00:56:43,012
And for us; never ever.

724
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:44,473
Sudha would have answered
this if she had been here.

725
00:56:44,892 --> 00:56:47,026
Anyway, Minudi you take
a little trouble. - What?

726
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:49,612
You make and serve tea to her.
- And both of us?

727
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:53,703
You both.. Okay you go and cook food.

728
00:56:54,212 --> 00:56:55,079
And Rama..

729
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,932
..let Rama sing and impress
Aloka Chaudhary completely.

730
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:01,403
As you wish.

731
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,091
Come.

732
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,693
Tell me why did you get
so impatient and called them?

733
00:57:21,635 --> 00:57:22,932
I called them because I thought that..

734
00:57:23,012 --> 00:57:24,943
..on seeing the house
empty you may perhaps..

735
00:57:25,023 --> 00:57:27,330
You should have told
me for what you've brought me.

736
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,129
Then the trouble would have been over!

737
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,730
Of course I'll say that.

738
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,520
But you came to my
house for the first time.

739
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,610
But the house is empty.

740
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,010
Just so that you don't
feel uncomfortable..

741
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,239
Rather say the truth!

742
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:41,187
Am I not saying that? - No.

743
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:44,829
You've called them because
you'll be uncomfortable.

744
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:51,029
&quot;Who are you, wild deer,
in the garden of the heart?&quot;

745
00:57:51,231 --> 00:57:57,294
&quot;Suddenly you lost
way and came close today.&quot;

746
00:57:57,476 --> 00:58:03,469
&quot;Who are you, wild deer,
in the garden of the heart?&quot;

747
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:09,388
&quot;Suddenly you lost
way and came close today.&quot;

748
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:12,429
&quot;Who are you, wild deer?&quot;

749
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:30,828
&quot;So many women desired;
but couldn't get you.&quot;

750
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,829
&quot;You couldn't be acquired.&quot;

751
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:40,469
&quot;So many women desired;
you but couldn't get you.&quot;

752
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:45,749
&quot;I wonder what the occasion is today..

753
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:48,349
..you offered yourself.&quot;

754
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:55,949
&quot;What language gets written
in both the eyes in your ignorance?&quot;

755
00:58:56,349 --> 00:59:03,629
&quot;What language gets written
in both the eyes in your ignorance?&quot;

756
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:10,191
&quot;Who are you, wild deer,
in the garden of the heart?&quot;

757
00:59:10,469 --> 00:59:16,229
&quot;Suddenly you lost
way and came close today.&quot;

758
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:19,308
&quot;Who are you, wild deer?&quot;

759
00:59:26,053 --> 00:59:32,069
&quot;It feels surprising to think
about the ways of the heart.&quot;

760
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:36,829
&quot;Why does it go missing
ahead of dreams?&quot;

761
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:43,069
&quot;It feels surprising to think
about the ways of the heart.&quot;

762
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:47,549
&quot;Why does it go missing
ahead of dreams?&quot;

763
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:56,629
&quot;A moment brings an
ultimate meeting like this.&quot;

764
00:59:56,909 --> 00:59:58,629
&quot;Brings meeting.&quot;

765
00:59:58,907 --> 01:00:06,189
&quot;A moment brings ultimate
meeting like this.&quot;

766
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:14,029
&quot;Bud-like eyelids preserve
everything within the soul.&quot;

767
01:00:14,371 --> 01:00:21,869
&quot;Tell me where will you
roam with the anklets of love?&quot;

768
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:29,436
&quot;Tell me where will you
roam with the anklets of love?&quot;

769
01:00:29,749 --> 01:00:35,828
&quot;Who are you, wild deer,
in the garden of the heart?&quot;

770
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:41,869
&quot;Suddenly you lost
way and came close today.&quot;

771
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:46,275
&quot;Who are you, wild deer?&quot;

772
01:00:48,029 --> 01:00:51,829
Wow; magnificent!
- 'Hey, you all come to this room!'

773
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:56,909
Come on, dear.

774
01:01:29,261 --> 01:01:31,310
Is Sudha there? I'm Ashesh.

775
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:35,749
Hey Sudha,
listen there's a gentleman..

776
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,797
..named Biman Chaudhary downstairs.

777
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:41,949
Ask uncle, he'll tell you.
He has a thick moustache.

778
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,749
Yes listen, tell him that
his daughter Aloka Chaudhary..

779
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:47,577
..had a headache;
I have dropped her home.

780
01:01:47,742 --> 01:01:49,349
'Aloka Chaudhary; who is she?'

781
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:51,029
I told you Biman Chaudhary's daughter.

782
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:55,189
'What, brother;
love affair or what?' - Being naughty?

783
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:03,267
Ashesh brother,
the tea is getting cold; come quickly!

784
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:06,629
You'll have to eat everything.

785
01:02:10,402 --> 01:02:11,269
For you, Rama.

786
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:17,433
You take.

787
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:18,939
I won't have. - You won't?

788
01:02:22,078 --> 01:02:23,012
Have it, Aloka.

789
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,909
What's the use of
getting angry on Ashesh?

790
01:02:26,214 --> 01:02:29,109
This is his habit.
Forgets even after inviting.

791
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:33,909
Now he does; but he won't
forget anymore after a few more days.

792
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,624
I'll leave now, brother.
- Why so early?

793
01:02:43,704 --> 01:02:45,778
Again it will start raining;
I shall flee before that.

794
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:49,624
And we had tea,
got introduced to Aloka.

795
01:02:49,944 --> 01:02:53,744
I'll leave, Aloka.
Okay? I'm very pleased to meet you.

796
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:56,519
And you also endured
our hospitality with pleasure.

797
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:57,453
'This is what we wished.'

798
01:02:58,544 --> 01:03:00,795
The actual days of
hospitality are still to come.

799
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,824
Ah, don't tell everything now, Rama.

800
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,984
Let the day come, then.

801
01:03:06,968 --> 01:03:09,824
Okay, I'll leave.
- Okay, we'll leave, dear.

802
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,544
Whatever happened
here since I came here..

803
01:03:20,624 --> 01:03:23,866
..I didn't like any of that!
- W.. w.. why.. why?

804
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:25,062
What's the matter?

805
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,161
Your Minudi, Rama, Bina..

806
01:03:27,977 --> 01:03:29,575
..their way of talking
is not good at all!

807
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:31,228
I don't know.

808
01:03:31,602 --> 01:03:33,816
I don't understand why you
didn't like their way of talking.

809
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,544
In my opinion there
is no girl so decent..

810
01:03:36,624 --> 01:03:38,064
..with such a beautiful
nature in our locality.

811
01:03:38,993 --> 01:03:42,417
Did I.. did I say that? - Then?

812
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:44,839
Nothing.

813
01:03:46,744 --> 01:03:47,824
Now if you'll be kind to arrange..

814
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:48,990
..my return, I will be obliged.

815
01:03:50,471 --> 01:03:51,624
You'll go?

816
01:03:55,557 --> 01:03:59,341
But, the sky doesn't seem to be calm.

817
01:04:00,138 --> 01:04:01,424
There may be a storm.

818
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:05,044
Couldn't you stay
back a little more? - No.

819
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,395
I'll have to go right now.

820
01:04:12,903 --> 01:04:14,515
You'll go without the
news about Shaileshwar?

821
01:04:16,723 --> 01:04:18,944
You do not have any news about Mr.
Shaileshwar.

822
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,365
If you had known you'd
have certainly told me by now.

823
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,521
So that means I was
cheating you till now?

824
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:27,890
It's better you yourself decide that!

825
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:31,577
Oh dear! It seems you are very angry.

826
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:34,635
So I must arrange for your return.

827
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:49,691
Rama, how come you're here?

828
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:52,431
I forgot my handkerchief on the table.

829
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,091
Oh you forgot so take it.

830
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:07,771
Will you arrange
for my return or not?!

831
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:10,669
Let's go; my car is parked outside.

832
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,168
Thank you.
Calling a taxi for me will be enough.

833
01:05:14,316 --> 01:05:15,000
Let's go.

834
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:35,250
Ramlal. Ramlal. - 'Sir?'

835
01:05:38,026 --> 01:05:40,357
Didn't I ask you to stay here?
- I was at home, sir.

836
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:41,776
Go and call a taxi. - Okay.

837
01:05:45,771 --> 01:05:48,425
He was at home till now?
- Yes he was here.

838
01:05:48,505 --> 01:05:50,280
The driver was here,
the gardener was here.

839
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:52,196
But..

840
01:05:53,635 --> 01:05:57,766
Did you think that I left you alone
in this unknown house and went away?

841
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:49,721
I need to apologize to you.

842
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:52,708
Apologize for what?

843
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:58,091
I've told you a lot of things
that no gentleman should endure.

844
01:06:59,197 --> 01:07:01,612
You can understand easily
that I am not gentleman.

845
01:07:04,651 --> 01:07:07,734
That means you are still angry.
- Why shouldn't I?

846
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:10,476
I insisted so much that don't go now,
it's going to rain.

847
01:07:10,918 --> 01:07:14,840
But no, you've to go right now.
Go; now go in the rain, huh.

848
01:08:25,658 --> 01:08:30,150
Well.. your Minudi
is also not being serious.

849
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:35,673
About what?

850
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:40,256
'No I was saying..' that
girl Rama is quite good looking.

851
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:44,688
Yes good looking.
- Quite jolly, friendly.

852
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:47,323
Yes that.. is true.

853
01:08:48,662 --> 01:08:52,770
Then why is nobody getting the idea?
- What idea?

854
01:08:54,491 --> 01:08:56,531
Even after knowing
that you are still single..

855
01:08:56,611 --> 01:08:57,656
..Minudi is not making
any arrangement.

856
01:08:58,062 --> 01:08:59,238
Oh. Oh..

857
01:09:03,961 --> 01:09:05,811
No.. no she didn't think at all.

858
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:11,291
And you? Don't you have any..

859
01:09:22,702 --> 01:09:25,901
No, I too do not think about this.

860
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:28,807
That means?

861
01:09:29,448 --> 01:09:31,419
That means there's
no gain in thinking.

862
01:09:33,575 --> 01:09:34,654
I didn't understand.

863
01:09:36,444 --> 01:09:40,303
Actually, even if I wish, she doesn't.

864
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:47,040
How surprising. Why doesn't she wish?

865
01:09:47,993 --> 01:09:49,113
Only she knows that.

866
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:54,633
I'm thinking how foolish that girl is.

867
01:09:57,091 --> 01:09:58,071
Okay.

868
01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:02,475
So then shall I leave? - You'll leave?

869
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:06,693
Yes, Mr. Ashesh.

870
01:10:09,174 --> 01:10:10,671
May I escort you?

871
01:10:13,162 --> 01:10:14,597
That won't be needed.

872
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,661
The time got spent
only in quarrelling.

873
01:10:23,942 --> 01:10:25,334
Did you feel very bad?

874
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:29,254
So then you'll remember Aloka
Chaudhary as a quarrelsome girl.

875
01:10:31,013 --> 01:10:32,321
I'll have to think over that.

876
01:10:35,883 --> 01:10:37,101
You'll go straight home I guess?

877
01:10:39,724 --> 01:10:42,616
I'll have to go to the wedding once.
- You'll have to go?

878
01:10:46,694 --> 01:10:49,986
Why do you ask? - No, just like that.

879
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:02,851
Perhaps we won't meet again.

880
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,100
Perhaps we won't.

881
01:11:06,646 --> 01:11:09,254
Perhaps you may not get a chance
to set foot on old garden street.

882
01:11:10,626 --> 01:11:12,514
I may not. What's the harm?

883
01:11:17,081 --> 01:11:18,880
You'll forget everything I guess?

884
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:21,682
What's the use of remembering?

885
01:11:25,734 --> 01:11:27,972
That's true; what's the use?

886
01:11:30,477 --> 01:11:33,735
Wasting time by remembering an
ordinary girl like Aloka Chaudhary..

887
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,056
..you are not such a cheap man.

888
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:41,691
All this shouldn't be
said to anyone even jokingly.

889
01:11:44,057 --> 01:11:44,971
Jokingly?

890
01:11:45,628 --> 01:11:47,967
If people hear they
may think otherwise.

891
01:11:51,329 --> 01:11:53,054
I don't care for people.

892
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:02,012
What's this; the taxi went away?

893
01:12:04,144 --> 01:12:05,389
Yes it went I see.

894
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:06,331
So then?

895
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:11,069
So then what's the option?
My car is there; come in my car.

896
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:12,813
No.. no.

897
01:12:13,926 --> 01:12:14,667
Why?

898
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:17,525
When I get down from your car at the..

899
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:19,518
..wedding venue then
what will you say to everyone?

900
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:22,583
I understood.

901
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:25,228
Then let's do one thing.

902
01:12:25,714 --> 01:12:28,629
Let the rain stop,
then we'll take Ramlal's help again.

903
01:12:29,632 --> 01:12:31,500
Why would you trouble
the poor one in vain?

904
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:34,977
Rather let's go walking. - Walking?

905
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:38,653
From Alipore to Dhakuria?

906
01:12:40,063 --> 01:12:41,819
Won't we find any taxi on the way?

907
01:12:42,243 --> 01:12:44,621
And what if we don't find?
- Then, a rickshaw.

908
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:46,290
And what if we don't
find rickshaw either?

909
01:12:47,121 --> 01:12:49,050
Then we'll stand on
the road side all night..

910
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,701
..and keep quarrelling
like this, okay?

911
01:13:03,468 --> 01:13:05,988
We're walking for half
an hour and didn't find any taxi.

912
01:13:06,828 --> 01:13:08,948
You are really unlucky. - Unlucky?

913
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,428
Who should be blamed, you or me?

914
01:13:12,682 --> 01:13:14,862
But make some arrangement;
shall we walk all night?

915
01:13:15,108 --> 01:13:17,748
Wow! Just a while ago
it seemed you are prepared..

916
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:20,009
..to walk to the end
of the world along with me.

917
01:13:20,784 --> 01:13:23,748
But really think about this;
not seeing me there at the..

918
01:13:23,828 --> 01:13:25,658
..wedding venue,
father must be worrying by now.

919
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,037
Not worrying at all.
- How do you know?

920
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,748
Because I myself called him and..

921
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,543
..said that his daughter
had a headache and went home.

922
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:35,787
Why did you lie in vain?

923
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:38,937
Because I did not know any
other way of making him worry less.

924
01:13:40,268 --> 01:13:42,468
But what could be the
reason for not going there?

925
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,602
I don't understand it at all.

926
01:13:44,322 --> 01:13:47,123
You didn't go there hence
I got your rare company.

927
01:13:49,028 --> 01:13:49,863
Are you kidding?

928
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:53,272
Tell me honestly,
did you lose much by not going there?

929
01:13:56,748 --> 01:13:58,780
Then why were you
so desperate to go there?

930
01:13:58,918 --> 01:14:01,308
Have to go somewhere;
tell me where should I go?

931
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:03,548
Wherever the heart wishes.

932
01:14:05,804 --> 01:14:09,468
If the heart says to go missing?
Then? - Fine; that will be so.

933
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:10,593
Taxi!

934
01:14:20,908 --> 01:14:23,485
Come. - What's this; where will we go?

935
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:26,462
Wow! You just said you
want to go missing. - But..

936
01:14:27,628 --> 01:14:30,170
Well, only if you do not
feel afraid of going with me.

937
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:53,679
What are you thinking?

938
01:16:56,391 --> 01:16:57,398
Nothing.

939
01:17:00,519 --> 01:17:02,509
A few hours were spent in joy, right?

940
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,730
Get some good sleep on going home.

941
01:17:08,346 --> 01:17:10,271
You'll see you don't remember
anything; you'll forget it all.

942
01:17:13,374 --> 01:17:16,509
And what if I don't forget?
- Certainly you will.

943
01:17:18,749 --> 01:17:22,028
One month, two months..
at the most a year.

944
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:24,821
Then you'll see you've
forgotten everything.

945
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:29,159
You'll be busy with your studies.

946
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:31,959
And I'll be busy with my doctor's job.

947
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,839
Perhaps there would be no
possibilities of meeting again in life.

948
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:42,719
And moreover even if we meet
there'll be nothing to fear then.

949
01:17:44,318 --> 01:17:46,167
Why? - What why?

950
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:48,759
Then you'll have a big
vermillion mark on your forehead.

951
01:17:48,945 --> 01:17:51,839
A huge veil on the face.
With your husband as bodyguard.

952
01:17:52,759 --> 01:17:55,323
If I move ahead to talk
to you he'll come charging at me.

953
01:18:00,773 --> 01:18:02,879
Have you ever seen Kolkata
at night from the Ganges?

954
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:07,242
Will you go, for a boat trip?

955
01:18:11,506 --> 01:18:12,919
Fine, don't go.

956
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,897
But it will feel very good if you go.

957
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,448
It looks very beautiful.

958
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:25,719
If you say, I'll go.

959
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:32,279
If I say then you'll go..
and if I don't say you won't?

960
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:36,059
That has been happening since evening.

961
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:38,679
I have been agreeing to your wishes.

962
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,812
It will be the same this time as well.

963
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:50,239
Wait I'll arrange for a boat.

964
01:18:58,244 --> 01:18:59,107
Will you take us aboard for a trip?

965
01:18:59,187 --> 01:19:00,994
Hey? - Of course, sir.

966
01:19:01,257 --> 01:19:03,249
How much will you charge?
- Five rupees each, sir.

967
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:04,919
No, not five; I'll give you four.

968
01:19:19,277 --> 01:19:21,837
'You have not spoken
at all for so long now.'

969
01:19:26,037 --> 01:19:27,957
No, is it?

970
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:31,077
Shall I say whom
you are thinking about?

971
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:33,637
About Shaileshwar.

972
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:37,317
How did you come to know..

973
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:39,637
..if I'm thinking about
something else or not?

974
01:19:47,477 --> 01:19:51,317
I read in a story;
a man secretly loved..

975
01:19:52,045 --> 01:19:53,837
..a girl of rare beauty.

976
01:19:55,303 --> 01:19:58,776
The man didn't know that
the girl has another lover.

977
01:20:00,277 --> 01:20:01,813
'Both were deeply in love.'

978
01:20:04,055 --> 01:20:04,954
Then?

979
01:20:06,608 --> 01:20:07,384
Then..

980
01:20:09,626 --> 01:20:13,746
Then one day the man stood in front
of the girl with a bunch of flowers.

981
01:20:15,908 --> 01:20:17,490
The girl said not this flower.

982
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,802
Then; which one?

983
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,549
Blood rose.

984
01:20:24,643 --> 01:20:27,643
Then the man searched for blood
rose in the market, in the fields..

985
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:31,318
..in the cities, in the villages, in
the valleys; didn't find it anywhere.

986
01:20:32,435 --> 01:20:34,203
'Again he stood in front of the girl.'

987
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:38,163
'Blood rose doesn't
grow anywhere in the world.'

988
01:20:39,328 --> 01:20:42,323
'The girl got upset and said;
so then you go away.'

989
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,239
'Your love is not love.'

990
01:20:45,395 --> 01:20:46,163
Then?

991
01:20:48,038 --> 01:20:51,723
Then what? The man went
to the forest with his sorrow.

992
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:53,763
And the girl forgot about him.

993
01:20:56,971 --> 01:21:00,843
This could not happen;
the girl could not forget him anyway.

994
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,811
Wow! That's in the story.

995
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,080
The story is wrong.

996
01:21:08,652 --> 01:21:11,766
Fine; so then now I'll
change the end of the story.

997
01:21:14,132 --> 01:21:15,820
The girl didn't forget the man, right?

998
01:21:26,472 --> 01:21:28,312
But you are not saying anything.

999
01:21:28,912 --> 01:21:30,712
Now you tell some story.

1000
01:21:34,432 --> 01:21:36,112
I do not know any story.

1001
01:21:39,232 --> 01:21:40,361
Okay then you sing a song.

1002
01:21:44,976 --> 01:21:48,103
How did you have this
notion that I can sing?

1003
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:53,464
No, I couldn't tell that exactly.

1004
01:21:54,627 --> 01:21:56,301
But I felt you can.

1005
01:22:03,655 --> 01:22:06,443
Perhaps by requesting without
knowing I disturbed you a little.

1006
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:08,672
Don't mind anything.

1007
01:22:13,893 --> 01:22:22,033
&quot;When it shattered,
the illusion of union shattered.&quot;

1008
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:30,884
&quot;When it shattered,
the illusion of union shattered.&quot;

1009
01:22:31,668 --> 01:22:43,213
&quot;I had thought I won't
ever forget the sight.&quot;

1010
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:48,813
&quot;When it shattered,
the illusion of union shattered.&quot;

1011
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:07,032
&quot;Day after day in
the soil of the path..

1012
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:16,339
..flowers fall down
to become garlands.&quot;

1013
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:22,307
&quot;Day after day in
the soil of the path..

1014
01:23:22,513 --> 01:23:29,248
..flowers fall down
to become garlands.&quot;

1015
01:23:30,286 --> 01:23:38,933
&quot;I don't know when the
time of coloring the world came.&quot;

1016
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:41,746
&quot;Got broken.&quot;

1017
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:57,357
&quot;Day after day when the
pain of the heart increased..

1018
01:23:57,919 --> 01:24:05,532
..I had thought my tears
won't be shed anymore..

1019
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:11,259
..won't be shed anymore from my eyes.&quot;

1020

&quot;Day after day when the
pain of the heart increased.&quot;

won't be shed anymore..

1022

..won't be shed anymore from my eyes.&quot;

1023
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:41,533
&quot;On suddenly meeting you on the way..

1024
01:24:41,613 --> 01:24:47,613
..I could not stop crying then.&quot;

1025
01:24:48,013 --> 01:24:59,413
&quot;On suddenly meeting you on
the way I could not stop crying then.&quot;

1026
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:05,533
&quot;I was looking to forget..

1027
01:25:05,853 --> 01:25:11,973
..the play of tears got broken.&quot;

1028
01:25:12,813 --> 01:25:20,413
&quot;I was looking to forget!&quot;

1029
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:36,526
Aloka.

1030
01:25:39,653 --> 01:25:40,677
Aloka.

1031
01:25:55,946 --> 01:25:57,653
Why didn't you let me forget?

1032
01:26:00,901 --> 01:26:02,008
It was..

1033
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:06,843
..it was much better
if we had not met.

1034
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:33,413
Now let me go.

1035
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:39,985
Come.

1036
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,032
Father.

1037
01:27:31,657 --> 01:27:32,755
Oh, what's this?

1038
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,519
You've not gone home yet?

1039
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,939
I came to take you.
Come. - Oh yes that's right.

1040
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,519
Come.. come it's very
late in the night. Come.

1041

'What's this; you are leaving?
- Yes, sir? Yes, sir.

1042
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,107
Look it's very late in the night.
- Have sweets.

1043
01:27:49,187 --> 01:27:51,901
No.. no..
no. I told you I won't eat anything.

1044
01:27:51,981 --> 01:27:53,541
Aha, at least watch the wedding.

1045
01:27:53,907 --> 01:27:56,510
The wedding.. - - Yes.
Come.. come. Come, child.. come.

1046
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,190
You come. - Come.

What's this? Shaileshwar?
- Yes, Dr. Shaileshwar Ghosh.

1051
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,509
Gem of the university.

1052
01:28:22,533 --> 01:28:26,613
'Shaileshwar..what
is Shaileshwar doing here?'

1053
01:28:27,793 --> 01:28:29,652
'Shaileshwar..
- What happened, gentleman?'

1054
01:28:30,362 --> 01:28:31,173

he said.. he'll marry Aloka..'

What are you saying?!

1061
01:28:57,066 --> 01:29:00,955
Come, let's go.
Come.. child.. come; let's go away.

1062

1067
01:31:02,848 --> 01:31:03,370
Hello?

1068
01:31:04,728 --> 01:31:07,368
Ashesh, I'm going to that
teacher's place right now!

1069
01:31:07,448 --> 01:31:08,608
You also be present there!

1070
01:31:08,808 --> 01:31:10,208
You don't know how disgustingly..

1071
01:31:10,288 --> 01:31:13,193
..he and his daughter
behaved here last night!

1072
01:31:13,688 --> 01:31:15,817
They said Shaileshwar betrayed them!

1073
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:18,259
But Shaileshwar says
he doesn't know them!

1074
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:20,208
If the teacher fails
to prove his allegation..

1075
01:31:20,288 --> 01:31:23,067
..then I will see how
he lives in the locality!

1076
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:32,790
What's this?
Shaileshwar, how come you're here?

1077
01:31:33,227 --> 01:31:34,383
Well..

1078
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:36,843
You told me that you didn't know them.

1079
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:12,081
Where is your father?

1080
01:32:13,133 --> 01:32:14,197
Gone out.

1081
01:32:15,347 --> 01:32:19,402
When he comes back tell him,
that he should forgive me for..

1082
01:32:20,059 --> 01:32:22,038
..the injustice I've done
on you people in my ignorance.

1083
01:32:23,055 --> 01:32:26,438
And.. the crime that Shaileshwar did..

1084
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,374
..I am sorry for that.
Okay now I'll leave.

1085
01:33:03,855 --> 01:33:05,272
Do you know?

1086
01:33:06,451 --> 01:33:09,611
Last night,
I just kept thinking about you.

1087
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:12,931
Early morning I got
uncle's phone call.

1088
01:33:14,526 --> 01:33:16,593
While coming all through
the way I was thinking..

1089
01:33:17,553 --> 01:33:19,008
..what I should do.

1090
01:33:22,156 --> 01:33:23,547
Now I have decided.

1091
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:27,414
What have you decided?

1092
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:31,787
I'll have to take up the
responsibility of this foolish..

1093
01:33:32,527 --> 01:33:35,862
..daughter of the simpleton Mr.
Teacher, for all my life.

1094
01:33:40,297 --> 01:33:43,250
What, do you object?

1095
01:33:45,736 --> 01:33:47,773
My agreement will be waiting for you.

1096
01:33:47,853 --> 01:33:49,399
Enough, that's fine.

1097
01:33:50,423 --> 01:33:52,804
Only your father is left,
no point knowing him.

1098
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,955
Stay then. -Hey!

1099
01:33:56,595 --> 01:33:57,350
Where are you going?

1100
01:33:57,723 --> 01:33:59,107
Outside.. to get you tea.

1101
01:34:00,553 --> 01:34:01,148
No?
