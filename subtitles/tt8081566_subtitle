00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:49,403
Oh Lord Krishna!

3
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:53,179
I just hope the mother and daughter
come out of this safe & healthy.

4
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:56,943
I'd be relieved if this damn
‘Pooradam‘ (star sign) gets over

5
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,515
and ‘Uthradam‘ (star sign) starts.

6
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:01,518
It will be ‘Uthradam‘. No
doubt about it. Confirmed!

7
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,053
It will be a boy, right?

8
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,625
'Pregnant with the mischievous Krishna,
the cloud-coloured one, in her womb'

9
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:12,392
Didn't I tell you as soon as
she became pregnant, Venugopalan?

10
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,555
It's definitely a
boy. No doubt about it.

11
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:15,921
Venugopalan Menon?

12
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:17,621
Here he comes!

13
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,433
It's a girl!

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,304
Girl?

15
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,301
Sister, did you check properly?

16
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:30,071
To check so much, it's not
the result of the SSLC exams!

17
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,611
It's a human child,
right? Here you go!

18
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,637
That isn't how it's supposed to be!

19
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,516
'Blossomed with the
beauty of three colours,

20
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:41,610
Pournami (full moon) of the auspicious
month of Chingam‘, goes the saying.

21
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,622
So... Hereafter, let
her be known as Pournami.

22
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:46,681
Pournami born with
star sign of Pooradam!

23
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:49,193
What's the relation
between Pooradam & Pournami?

24
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,686
No relation!

25
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:53,394
Isn't this how certain
relations happen?

26
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:55,693
Still...

27
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,259
Just hold her, please.

28
00:03:58,457 --> 00:04:01,232
‘Pooradam‘ means blessing, right?

29
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,136
Oh Lord Krishna!
Lord Guruvayurappa!

30
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:09,475
'Years back, on an
ordinary Monday...

31
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,045
completely opposite to
predictions and a long wait,

32
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:16,583
a girl child was born to
Venugopalan and Radhamani‘.

33
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,113
'But, in another hospital
in the same city...'

34
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:24,552
(singing the Yesudas
classic Jab Deep Jale Aana)

35
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,125
Chandran...

36
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,027
30 marks out of 50
is not enough, Vijay.

37
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:35,024
It shows your low confidence level!

38
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,155
Come here!

39
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:38,458
Vijay, you have
great self-confidence!

40
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,462
You just need to dig
deep and get it out!

41
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,533
Or else, you won't be able
to study in a good college.

42
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:47,939
You won't be able to roam
around with good girlfriends!

43
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,174
Who is your superhero?

44
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:56,050
That... is Superman!

45
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,087
Superman!

46
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,280
Vijay, you're even more
super than Superman!

47
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:05,081
You have much more potential
than Saddam Hussein, right?

48
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,023
So you should look into the
mirror every morning and say...

49
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,422
'Yes! I can!'

50
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,364
I can do it!

51
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,295
Nothing is impossible for me.

52
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:16,361
Vila)', you're super.

53
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,064
Vijay is super!

54
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:21,031
Vijay super! Vijay super!

55
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:22,072
What is it?

56
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,540
Well, Vijay super...

57
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,067
Vijay is super!

58
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:27,973
That's the name of
Chandrettan‘s vehicle.

59
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:30,012
It's my scooter.

60
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:31,910
It's slightly old.

61
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:33,873
Vijay super-
- Vijay super-

62
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,886
According to the
doctor's instruction,

63
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,982
the hero of our story was trying really
hard to increase his self-confidence.

64
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,527
Vijay, you're super, Vijay!

65
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:47,953
You are an opportunity.

66
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,394
You can do everything
under the sky!

67
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,932
Your potential is unlimited,
and you're super, Vijay.

68
00:05:54,123 --> 00:05:55,100
Why did you stop?

69
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,065
Say the rest too..
You are excellent,

70
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,003
You are excellent, you are
amazing, and you're fabulous, Vijay!

71
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,039
Very good!

72
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:02,199
That's enough for today, son.

73
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,106
You can continue when
you're back from school.

74
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,378
Rest in the evening...

75
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,974
Smart boy! Vij'3V---

76
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,350
Super!

77
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,419
'Years passed'

78
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,379
"At a school in the city,
Pournami who's called Pinky at home'

79
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,923
'Our heroine'

80
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,459
she asked really tough questions,

81
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:27,257
and shocked even the Maths teacher'

82
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:29,520
If you subtract 1 from
9, you will get 10.

83
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,621
Can anyone say how that's possible?

84
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:33,332
Anyone?

85
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,558
No!

86
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:37,169
Okay! We've failed.
You say it, Pinky!

87
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:38,403
Watc h !

88
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:40,340
How much is this?
- Nine.

89
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:41,973
Correct.

90
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:43,633
How much is it now?

91
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,002
Ten!
- Yes! That's it!

92
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:49,574
We are sure! Pinky will
reach great heights!

93
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:52,474
She shocks us by asking
different questions daily!

94
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,382
That's her current hobby.

95
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,886
Does she shock you at home as well?

96
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:58,548
At times...

97
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:01,250
Maths teacher says that if
the logarithm wasn't invented,

98
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:03,088
Pinky would have invented it.

99
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:05,253
Physics teacher says that
if gravity wasn't discovered,

100
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,590
Pinky would have discovered it.

101
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:11,356
'If Columbus hadn't discovered
America, Pinky would have discovered it'

102
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:13,332
'Her class teacher even
bragged on that level!'

103
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:16,563
'It was regular in that school
as well, to invite parents over

104
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:19,967
and tell them that their
children are superhuman,

105
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,940
and accept donations from them.‘

106
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,305
Please accept this...

107
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:27,447
So, after a few years...

108
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:31,047
Look, sir. The engine portion
is in proper condition! - Good.

109
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:34,218
It hasn't had any accidents
or scratches, right?

110
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,583
What are you saying, sir?

111
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:38,357
lam the high priest of
Valanjambalam temple. I won't lie.

112
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,188
Just that I do this
broker's job in the morning.

113
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:41,420
The car is in proper condition!

114
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:43,961
It hasn't had any hits or scratches
ever since it was bought. - Is it?

115
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:45,928
No! No! There has been!
- There he goes!

116
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:49,228
It's a car that runs on the road, right?
It has had its share of hits and scratches.

117
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:50,959
The car is not bad.

118
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,400
Any other major complaint?

119
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,562
No! Nothing!

120
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,531
Nothing at all!
- There is.

121
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:58,439
Once when we took out
the car during the rain,

122
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,009
the engine turned off suddenly.

123
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:02,133
I tried my best to
get it started again!

124
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,277
But when a mechanic from a workshop
came and gave just a small touch,

125
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,870
it started immediately!
- Great!

126
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,175
That hasn't happened after that.

127
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:09,409
This car won't get the
price you asked for.

128
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,145
Along with that, if you say
that the engine also got stuck...

129
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:15,279
if I do a business by saying lies,
I won't be able to sleep. That's why.

130
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,050
You needn't lie. We will
think about it & let you know.

131
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,483
Okay? Isn't that fine?

132
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,019
Sorry.
- Come, bro.

133
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,355
We'll see you soon, Satheeshan.

134
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,395
Sir, 
...

135
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,059
Why did you have to tell them
that the engine gave you trouble?

136
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,565
If you had reduced just 10,000
this deal would have happened.

137
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,594
Just to waste my time!

138
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,903
As if he's the Lord of truth!

139
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,397
It's a car that used to run
without any problems, right?

140
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,840
You needn't tell them
all the truths, right?

141
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:43,008
You lost everything you
had by doing favours, right?

142
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,339
To do a business by lying,

143
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:49,475
is equal to breaking into their house
and stealing, Chetta (elder brother).

144
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,421
And, it wasn't because of my
incompetence that I'm in so much debt.

145
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,224
Did you forget what
happened in my life?

146
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,482
Did they leave?

147
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:00,794
They went their own
way. Give it to me.

148
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,356
I added sugar.
- I don't want it.

149
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,233
Here.

150
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:12,965
Your best friend cheated you and
took away all your financial savings!

151
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,929
To be in a debt of 80 lakhs...

152
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,297
is that a silly matter?

153
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,335
You do one thing.

154
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,139
Don't think about sentiments.

155
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,542
Sell this ancestral house of ours.

156
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:23,575
I don't have a problem.

157
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,410
And don't make moneylenders
keep coming to our house.

158
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,379
As long as I'm alive, I won't
let anyone sell this house.

159
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,286
Hey! Didn't you say that Madhavi‘s
PF got passed & you got some money?

160
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:37,916
Give him some cash from it.

161
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,222
Don't sell this car
for the time being.

162
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,592
Even though it's old, let
it be here at this courtyard.

163
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:44,364
Look at me.

164
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:45,932
I'll tell you one thing.

165
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,497
Vijay‘s marriage. That
should be done immediately.

166
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,035
If an efficient girl
comes into his life,

167
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,037
all his laziness would be gone.

168
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,398
The problems here would be solved,

169
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:59,843
only if a girl with education, lineage
and good dowry comes to this house.

170
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,271
To take dowry?

171
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:04,043
What are you saying, Etta?
- Don't argue.

172
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,217
I'm saying this after
giving it a lot of thought.

173
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,851
Think practically.

174
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,413
ls it intelligent to sell
the house and settle the debt,

175
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,353
or to get your son
married by taking dowry.

176
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,484
I'll send you the money
for the time being.

177
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,300
Don't utter the word
'business' in this house again!

178
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,876
Just because you finished MBA, it's
not like you can't do other jobs!

179
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
Pournami‘s ideas!

180
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,479
Pournami will be a great person!

181
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:42,411
Pournami is something special!

182
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:45,280
Saying all that, so many
evil eyes were cast on you.

183
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:50,184
Otherwise, how can both businesses
you started flop so badly?

184
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:52,549
It means that this
is not meant for you!

185
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:55,425
Hello!

186
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,631
And finally I started a firecracker
company. And it didn't burst!

187
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,991
So at least that's there.
Sell that & pay me back!

188
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,963
It was the crackers
that didn't burst!

189
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,233
When the crackers didn't burst,
that company also flopped.

190
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:08,838
My dad always says this about me...

191
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,035
That my name would come
on the Guinness book.

192
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,073
It's true.

193
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,003
Dad's not saying anything because
he doesn't want you to feel sad.

194
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,547
And not because he's not concerned!

195
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:23,550
Hey!

196
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,976
You are our only child!

197
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,979
Matching the horoscopes properly,

198
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:32,957
only boys with lineage and education and
brought here for the match-making ceremony.

199
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:36,561
Until one is fixed,
proposals would keep coming.

200
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,573
Son, why are you driving so slow?

201
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:57,236
The car won't scream if
you drive a little faster.

202
00:11:57,469 --> 00:12:00,381
Etta, we're already
30 minutes early.

203
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:01,976
Why should he drive fast?

204
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,084
Go slowly.

205
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:06,255
If I have to go somewhere,
I need to reach there early.

206
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,845
Or else, I have some
kind of suffocation.

207
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,924
This is not like going
to any random place, Etta.

208
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,550
We're going for the
match-making ceremony, right?

209
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,919
That's what I said...

210
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,223
Before they get ready
there, if we reach there,

211
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,456
we can understand things
and surroundings much better.

212
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,224
That's true.
- That's all.

213
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:22,427
You're going for a match-making, like
you go for your real estate sales, Etta.

214
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,463
I didn't say anything! Son,
you drive however you want to!

215
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, what happened
to these guys today?

216
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:31,141
Why are you silent?

217
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,535
Nothing, uncle.

218
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,946
We were thinking about his future.

219
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,039
You're big shot music directors,
right? Do you have any work?

220
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,583
We don't have time for
anything apart from work, uncle.

221
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:43,385
We're going for a good deed,
right? What about a song now?

222
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:44,511
That would be great.

223
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:46,054
Keep quiet, mom.

224
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,589
He will say all
that. You guys sing!

225
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,017
Oops! I have throat pain.

226
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:51,252
As if you'd sing if
your throat was okay!

227
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:52,623
Same excuse whenever
you're asked to sing!

228
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,089
We're going for an auspicious
function, right? Sing!

229
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,291
Oh! You've agreed!
- No! I was checking the pitch!

230
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:00,800
Yes.

231
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:05,827
'Why this hide and seek?'

232
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:12,036
'My dear, I an": as
transparent as glass'

233
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,144
'Why this hide and seek?'

234
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,076
What happened, son?

235
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,445
Try starting once more.

236
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,177
Let me check, dad.
- What happened, dude?

237
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,351
What did I do?

238
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,517
The battery must be faulty.

239
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:29,985
And your song's too.

240
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:31,822
What happened?
- Get out and check.

241
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,361
The car didn't have
any problems, right?

242
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,830
Open the bonnet & check. That's
what everyone does, right?

243
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:37,532
Sorry!

244
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:39,099
Sorry?

245
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:55,415
When Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa
Swami was ailing and couldn't move,

246
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,040
God came in his dream and told him,

247
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,241
'Ramakrishna,

248
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,919
'As long as this world exists, you will
live on through people who love you'

249
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:04,320
Pinky!
<i>‘</i> Yes!

250
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,448
Come here. We're
going to get ready.

251
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:07,986
You should watch these kids.

252
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,992
Coming!

253
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,495
Grandma, a family is coming to
see her today, for an alliance.

254
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:14,931
You go there.

255
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,891
Can't you dress up a little better?

256
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:18,900
What for?

257
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,970
I'll be back after my punishment!

258
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,404
Bye!

259
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,238
Come here once you're done.
- Okay!

260
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:33,047
My dear Ganeshan,
don't change your word.

261
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:35,515
4 PM?

262
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:37,580
Okay. Come then.

263
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,221
Sudha‘s children are here.

264
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,085
If it gets closed, it
will be a lot of trouble.

265
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:44,552
So 4 o'clock! Okay?

266
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,120
Menon, aren't you ready yet?

267
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:48,854
They are coming to see you, not me!

268
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,494
Pinky!

269
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,487
Can you take the
milk off the stove?

270
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,162
We'll be right there.
- Okay.

271
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,600
I'll get ready
quickly. You get going.

272
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:07,474
Hello!
- Hello.

273
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,311
The match-making ceremony... Here?

274
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:11,537
Right?
- Yes.

275
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,110
lam the girl.

276
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,341
This is the guy.

277
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:17,180
Our car broke down
on the way.. So...

278
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,318
To freshen up.. Washroom?

279
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,320
Come.

280
00:15:22,178 --> 00:15:23,851
Come.
- You go. I'll come with them.

281
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,924
You carry on.

282
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:26,927
This room?
- No!

283
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:28,892
Mom is changing there.
Let's go upstairs.

284
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:29,895
Come.
- Sorry.

285
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:41,338
Come.

286
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,204
That's the washroom.
- Thank you.

287
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:51,075
Hey! Both of you are sitting here?

288
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,214
Haven't we told you not
to get into this room?

289
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,044
Go! Both of you get going!

290
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,814
I won't talk to you, Pinky. Just
when I was about to win the game..

291
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:01,787
I won't talk to you! Monkey! Pinky!
- Excuse me, towel?

292
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,121
Chinnu! Didn't I tell
you not to close the door?

293
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,130
Sorry!

294
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,129
I forgot!

295
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:15,064
What have you done, dear? Haven't
we told you not to close this door?

296
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,000
Ganeshan just told me that he
would repair it in the evening!

297
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,095
What can I do, dad? She closed it!

298
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,107
Hey! It's not a field!

299
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,039
It's a first rate ground.

300
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:26,908
Please stop it! You've been going
on about fields and grounds for long!

301
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:28,878
Okay! I'll call you back.

302
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:31,309
Isn't your make up done?
- Done. Coming!

303
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:34,045
This house isn't half
as big as we heard.

304
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,814
We didn't come to measure the size of
the house. We came to see the girl, right?

305
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,787
There's parking only for one car.

306
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:44,888
Where is Vijay?
- He just went in.

307
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,155
To wash his hands.

308
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,194
Careful.

309
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:49,829
You are?

310
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,364
No need of any doubts.
We came to see the girl.

311
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:55,299
Chechi, they are here.

312
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:58,438
Please come.
- Come on.

313
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,736
Hi aunty.
- Namaste aunty.

314
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,203
Great!
- The power is gone!

315
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,037
ls it your birthday today?

316
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:07,940
No, it was last week. Why?

317
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:09,379
Well, it should have
been today. Come.

318
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:11,148
Venu Etta, they have reached.

319
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:13,276
I'm coming.

320
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:15,980
They have reached, dear.

321
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:17,986
Why have these
losers come so early?

322
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,055
Culture less fellows.

323
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,887
Scoundrels! Idiots!

324
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,059
Don't they have any...

325
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,453
Coming in early?

326
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,860
Dad!
<i>‘</i> Yes!

327
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:25,894
He is in here.

328
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:26,996
Who?

329
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:28,929
The guy who came to see me.
- The groom?

330
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:30,755
Yes. The groom.

331
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,199
H ow?

332
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:36,304
I just came in to use
the washroom, uncle.

333
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:37,795
Sorry.

334
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:40,433
Sorry... I was talking
about Ganeshan...

335
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,072
That's okay. Understood.

336
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,304
Who else is inside, dear?
- Nehakutty is here, dad.

337
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:48,975
The door got locked.

338
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:51,412
The door got locked.

339
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,184
Locked?

340
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:55,851
It had been faulty.

341
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:58,414
Don't try to open
it. It won't open.

342
00:17:59,013 --> 00:17:59,923
Hold this.

343
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:02,922
Hello! Hello!

344
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,222
It won't open!

345
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:05,896
Didn't I say that it's faulty?

346
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,322
But...

347
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,933
He has called the guy.
Didn't dad mention a Ganeshan?

348
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,430
It will be all right.

349
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,905
‘Vijay Super and Pournami‘

350
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,858
It must be hotter upstairs.

351
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,449
That must be the girl's dad.
- For sure.

352
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,156
Please sit.

353
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:45,965
Well, the car had some
trouble on the way, right?

354
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:47,222
Who told you?

355
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,859
Well, the boy had said...

356
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,836
I had selected an auspicious
time checking the ‘Rahukalam‘.

357
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,406
But you started a little early?

358
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:56,434
Did he say that too?
- No.

359
00:18:56,796 --> 00:19:00,107
I strongly believe in time and omens.
- ls that so?

360
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,970
Was it difficult to find the house?

361
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,341
We went in rounds for a bit.

362
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:06,781
A confusion between Dr.
Rajendran & Ravindran street.

363
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:07,974
That's all right.

364
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,113
There's a small problem.

365
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,754
What happened?

366
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,117
Well... Surya...

367
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,892
went to the washroom
upstairs to freshen up.

368
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:19,459
Surya? Who is that?

369
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,459
Son.. Your son!

370
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,430
My son's name is Vijay.

371
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:27,928
Not Surya.
- on! Vijay.

372
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:30,060
You were saying that
there's some problem.

373
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:35,163
Well, the lock of the
room upstairs got jammed...

374
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,503
Vijay went to the washroom there.

375
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,005
So is he stuck inside?

376
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,308
Well, the carpenter
will come right now.

377
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,510
Who is with him?
- My daughter is with him. Pinky.

378
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:47,249
The girl we were about to see?

379
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:48,851
Definitely.

380
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:51,444
Oh God!

381
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:52,954
It's okay.

382
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:55,854
There's a ritual in which the girl
and boy talk to each other, right?

383
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:57,426
Just consider that
it got over first.

384
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,519
But please call that carpenter
and ask him to come fast.

385
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:00,794
I'll call him.

386
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:02,854
You don't be tensed.

387
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:04,765
Hey!

388
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:07,060
Do you know how to break locks?

389
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,931
Oh no! I don't know
anything about locks, uncle.

390
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:12,406
You guys are good for nothing!

391
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,070
We are music directors, uncle.

392
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,103
Call him on his phone.

393
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:17,501
Call fast.

394
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,970
Call!

395
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,347
Uncle,

396
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,004
his phone is with me.

397
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:24,842
He gave it to me when
we were in the car.

398
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,513
What is this, dear?

399
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:30,549
Haven't we told you to
be careful with this door?

400
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,289
What can I do if
she closes it, mom?

401
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:34,024
Son...

402
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:35,948
ls she calling me? Yes, aunty!

403
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,359
Don't get scared.
- Scared?

404
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:40,121
No!
- Stop it, Chechi.

405
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:43,025
Neha, don't play the video game!

406
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:44,495
I will play the game!

407
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:47,232
Mom, I also want to go inside.
- Shut up!

408
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,268
After causing all this trouble!

409
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:52,167
Pinky, we'll do what's
necessary to open the door.

410
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:53,966
Until then, talk to each other.

411
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:55,541
Know the likes and dislikes!

412
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:58,472
Dear, shall we go downstairs?

413
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:00,111
Okay.

414
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,882
Okay, let's go. Come.

415
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:08,754
Shall I pick this?
- Who is it?

416
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,322
It's Gopiettan. Gopi Sunder.

417
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:12,052
Some musical doubts.
- Yeah right.

418
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:13,790
I'm also coming.
- Hello.

419
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,382
Can you hear me, sir?

420
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,024
Sir, we are in a meeting!

421
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,298
Sheesh!
- The power is back!

422
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,399
Hello!

423
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,860
I have seen you somewhere.

424
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,303
Correct.

425
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:30,538
I have also seen you
somewhere, but...

426
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:32,537
No idea!

427
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,446
This room is full of
AR Rahman & KS Chitra.

428
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:39,446
Are you a big fan?

429
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:40,543
Die-hard fan!

430
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:45,317
I've been wanting to click a picture with
both of them, but it hasn't happened yet.

431
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,082
That's a very easy desire!

432
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:49,855
Hello!

433
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:51,991
Don't mock me!

434
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:53,151
Hey! I wasn't mocking you!

435
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:02,733
Please take it.

436
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,827
Sudha, where's the tissue paper?
- It's over there.

437
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:10,873
This...

438
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:11,941
Grandmother.

439
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,940
I understood that she's a grandmother.

440
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,111
She's old, right?

441
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,074
Whose grandmother?
- Pinky's grandmother.

442
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,181
On the day of her 80th
birthday celebrations,

443
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,375
she ate an amazing feast,

444
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,281
suddenly she fell unconscious
and that was it!

445
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:25,047
Awesome! Super!

446
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,078
What?
- Well...

447
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,452
All relatives could be present, right?

448
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,224
What?

449
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,488
He was saying that it's a great tragedy.
Poor grandmother.

450
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,461
Eat!
- Have an Unniyappam!

451
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:36,492
And shut up!

452
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:38,459
- Dude, I meant...
- Hey Ganeshan!

453
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:39,864
Just a minute.

454
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:41,400
It's Ganeshan.
The carpenter.

455
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:42,467
Ask him to come fast.

456
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:45,294
My dear Ganeshan, the boy who came
to see her is locked in that room!

457
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:46,872
Not 4 o'clock!
- Who is Ganeshan?

458
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:49,772
Reach here immediately.
- He called the carpenter to break the lock

459
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:50,808
You guys can't do it, right?

460
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:52,274
- Don't forget to take the drill.
- Eat!

461
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:54,242
- Okay.
- Eat what you have in hand first.

462
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:56,136
Didn't you take anything?

463
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:57,476
We'll take it.

464
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,310
Did he say where he has reached?

465
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:01,918
He'll be here now.
He is on the way.

466
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:05,986
Have it.
- Okay.

467
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:13,261
Don't worry.

468
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,488
Dad must be finding
ways to open the door.

469
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,099
It's all right.
I'm not in any hurry.

470
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:22,995
ls this your first time?

471
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:25,337
No.

472
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:28,235
When I was studying in fourth grade,

473
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:32,001
I got beaten up by uncle with a
cane, for doing some mischief.

474
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:35,913
In that anger, I got into my room,
and closed it hard like this.

475
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,948
The lock got jammed.

476
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:41,743
Then people from the surroundings came,
broke the roofing tiles, got inside...

477
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:43,378
It was quite dramatic!

478
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:45,181
Not that.
- Then?

479
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:47,224
ls this your first
match making ceremony?

480
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:49,858
Yeah.

481
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:51,857
This is my first time ever.

482
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:54,423
This is usual for me though.

483
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:55,396
Uncle!

484
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:01,236
Fifteenth.

485
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,336
Oh no!

486
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:05,430
Pinky, take it.

487
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:06,469
What is it?

488
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,003
Please take it.

489
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:09,075
Hi Vijay-

490
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Hi.
- Pinky!

491
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,743
Didn't you see that?
- Yes.

492
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:13,905
G01: it!

493
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:15,073
Pinky!
- Got it!

494
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:16,844
Serve it, okay?
- Yes.

495
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:18,350
Don't give too much
ketchup to Neha.

496
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,048
I will eat all the ketchup!

497
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,721
I'm going downstairs, okay!

498
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:23,821
Okay!

499
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,958
Then?

500
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:29,793
Going on!

501
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:32,795
What else?

502
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:33,829
What else?

503
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:35,057
Just like that...

504
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:36,098
Doing good.

505
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,860
All good there, right?

506
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:44,340
Except for the door problem,
it's all good.

507
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:47,433
Does any other door here
have such a problem?

508
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:50,973
Not all doors have such a problem.

509
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:51,979
That's fortunate!

510
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:57,783
Have some samosa.
- No.

511
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:00,276
Actually..
- Actually...

512
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:02,255
Tell me.
- No. You tell me.

513
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,321
No, it's okay.

514
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:04,723
You tell me.

515
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:06,258
Okay.

516
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,060
Can you...

517
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:11,354
Can you stand up, please?

518
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:13,326
How many ever times!

519
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:18,431
see!

520
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,464
We're not at all a good match.

521
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:22,738
Right?

522
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:27,174
ls that so?
What's the problem?

523
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,304
Can't you see?

524
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,244
ls there such a big problem?
- Yes.

525
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:37,383
You turn this side.

526
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,047
Dear, how do we look?

527
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,450
Not a good match, uncle!

528
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,080
Great!

529
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:46,959
Awesome!

530
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,498
Even if we make a good match,

531
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:55,960
now I'm not ready for a marriage.

532
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:02,265
My parents don't
seem to understand.

533
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,275
This match-making drama has
been going on for a while.

534
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,406
I request everyone who come here
to say that they didn't like me.

535
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,713
Even you should say that.

536
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,884
Please.

537
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,686
Okay.

538
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,057
Did you notice serial bulbs
and stars on the way here?

539
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,785
- At the balcony?
- Serial bulbs?

540
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,827
Yes. Illumination lights.

541
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:32,064
Usually dad gives that also as an
identification for people who come here.

542
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:33,099
Didn't he tell you?

543
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:35,367
I didn't pay attention.

544
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:39,329
Dad is adamant that he'd remove
it only after my wedding.

545
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:42,306
Like in the movie ‘Maheshinte
Prathikaram‘ (Mahesh‘s Revenge).

546
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,105
I got relieved only now.

547
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:51,108
To be frank, I became
ready for this ceremony

548
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:52,946
only because of the
pressure from my family.

549
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:55,181
I'm not prepared for a marriage yet.

550
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,857
And yeah, in my house, you won't find
these serial bulbs and such melodrama.

551
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:06,889
What's your future plan?

552
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,291
Actually, my best friends...

553
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:12,801
those two girls in that photo,
are in Australia.

554
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,365
I also want to go there.

555
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,804
But...

556
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,267
I've wasted quite a lot of dad's money
by doing businesses I wasn't good at.

557
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:23,303
There's no point staying here,
if I have to repay that.

558
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,039
Or else, I should do a business again.

559
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:28,210
I actually have confidence.

560
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:31,347
But the Australian Visa
has already arrived.

561
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,448
Since I'm the only daughter,
they're not letting me go.

562
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:37,449
An emotional...

563
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:44,121
I'm really sorry for
the inconvenience.

564
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:46,089
You don't have to say sorry.

565
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:48,254
Anyways...

566
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:50,832
It was wonderful meeting you.

567
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:52,267
Wish you all the best.

568
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,065
Nehakutty,
shall this uncle leave?

569
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,303
Okay?

570
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:58,073
I need to celebrate this
with a couple of beers.

571
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,102
It's my first match-making ceremony!

572
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:03,110
Shucks!

573
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:04,704
This door!

574
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,079
I forgot about that.

575
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,084
This is a massive stuck up situation!

576
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:15,079
Well, didn't you say that
you aren't in any hurry?

577
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:16,253
Well...

578
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,180
I didn't think I would
get stuck like this.

579
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,953
And my phone is with those guys.

580
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,059
What is this?
- Not to get bored.

581
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:36,131
ls it your dad's wedding album?

582
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:38,740
Look.

583
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:48,882
Where do you work?

584
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,982
I don't work anywhere.

585
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,744
I mean, I used to.

586
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,682
But right now...

587
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:56,922
Degree?

588
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,084
I have an engineering
degree which I got

589
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:00,751
by clearing all the supply's
with lots of difficulty.

590
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:03,724
My family tried to inject and
make a broiler engineer.

591
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,053
But it didn't work out.

592
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,856
Are your parents really strict?

593
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:08,626
No! They are very naive.

594
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,161
No parents would be so supportive.

595
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,732
It's actually very funny!

596
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:15,738
Tell me then.

597
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,237
That would take a lot of time.

598
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,367
It's a really long story.

599
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,406
We have at least one hour's time.

600
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:23,873
And we don't have anything
else to talk about.

601
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:29,010
And it's not a small thing to get
someone to listen to you these days.

602
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:30,251
So don't waste time.

603
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,410
Tell me.

604
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,415
Say it, uncle.

605
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:34,888
Come on!

606
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,260
Okay.

607
00:29:41,317 --> 00:29:45,356
On the morning of an exam day,
I was making chits to copy in my room.

608
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:47,200
Didn't he wake up yet?

609
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,768
He went to bed late.

610
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:50,962
Doesn't he have an exam today?
- Yes. It's at 2 PM.

611
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:52,867
He has prepared very well.

612
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:54,703
So?
It's 9 o'clock.

613
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,207
Hey! You don't be
tensed unnecessarily.

614
00:29:57,098 --> 00:29:58,042
Dear...
- Yes.

615
00:29:58,132 --> 00:29:59,202
Bring dad's bag.

616
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:00,845
Viju...

617
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,676
- Yes.
- Open the door.

618
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,179
Dad!
- Were you studying?

619
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:11,787
Yeah.

620
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,446
A little.
It's done.

621
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,952
Didn't you drink tea?

622
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,823
I hadn't finished studying, dad.
That's why...

623
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,964
What's the exam today?

624
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:26,128
Machine design.
- Machine design! Did you study?

625
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:33,239
What is this?

626
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:40,707
Are you sure that you'd
pass if you copy?

627
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:45,478
That...

628
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,146
I mall Pass.
- on!

629
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,785
Then you needn't fail because of that.

630
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:52,916
Tell me whatever your doubts are.
I'll write it for you.

631
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:54,890
Your hands must be sore
after writing so much.

632
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:56,793
Tell me.
I'll write it for you.

633
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:58,287
No...
Dad...

634
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,862
I'm not mocking you!

635
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,697
You wrote a lot, right?
Now you tell me. I'll write.

636
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:04,825
Read everything you have
doubts on and tell me. Here!

637
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,397
Dad,

638
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:10,263
this subject is quite
difficult for me.

639
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:12,002
So?
Should you copy?

640
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,072
If you fail, go ahead
and fail, man!

641
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,935
Have I ever scolded you?

642
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,804
Do you know why I said that
I'll write it for you?

643
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:22,148
Whenever you feel like copying again,
you should remember what I said now.

644
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:26,253
Even if we build a
huge stage with lies,

645
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,686
it won't have the eligibility
to host even an ant.

646
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:33,318
By making mistakes, your life itself
would turn into a huge mistake.

647
00:31:39,286 --> 00:31:41,323
You are my son!

648
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:43,858
Write whatever you know!

649
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:45,101
You will pass today!

650
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:46,863
So sweet!

651
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,140
You're so lucky to get such parents.

652
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:51,206
Thank you.

653
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,739
Actually, me too.

654
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:58,477
But they would bring me under their
control, with emotional dialogues.

655
00:31:59,036 --> 00:31:59,912
It's true.

656
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:01,048
But..
- Wait! Wait!

657
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:03,308
Did you clear that exam?

658
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,954
WOW!

659
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,055
So dad's blessing was
quite something, huh?

660
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:14,660
Did you buy these samosas?

661
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,252
No. Aunt Sudha made them.

662
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,130
It has a slightly sweet taste.

663
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,364
Try it.

664
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,002
It is sweet indeed!

665
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,735
The reason behind you staying here,

666
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:34,840
avoiding all the proposals
coming your way,

667
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,975
saying that you want
to go to Australia,

668
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:38,147
is also something sweet.

669
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:39,680
Right?

670
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,348
That of a major affair?

671
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:43,785
Right?

672
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,721
One doesn't have to be extra
intelligent to understand this.

673
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,016
Just common sense.

674
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:51,920
All those who came and left from here
like me, would have understood that too.

675
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:57,929
Leave that.

676
00:32:58,888 --> 00:32:59,764
What did you study?

677
00:32:59,922 --> 00:33:01,127
Medicine?
Engineering?

678
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:02,667
CA?
- MBA.

679
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:04,035
MBA!

680
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,231
I always wished to do business and
become a successful entrepreneur.

681
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,397
But everything flopped.

682
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:16,804
Dad was expecting a boy child 101%,

683
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:19,148
when I was born, like a
lightning that struck him.

684
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,949
Dad was a close friend
to director Padmarajan.

685
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:28,415
He has worked as an executive producer
for some of his movies as well.

686
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:34,762
WOW!

687
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:37,026
All are epic movies!

688
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:39,428
Long back, an astrologer had predicted,

689
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,432
'Stop this right away, or
you'll lose your shelter too!'

690
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,761
But dad never made any losses.

691
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:47,400
I was the one who did it.

692
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:50,938
What were we beginning to say?

693
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,739
Actually, we hadn't
begun to say anything.

694
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:57,281
Was it while studying for MBA?
That sweetness?

695
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,721
N01: MBA.
While doing IELTS.

696
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:22,218
'Drenched in that incessant rain,
we n1et for the first time on that day'

697
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,959
'With endless words,
our silences united'

698
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:39,300
'Within the mist that disappears
slowly into the cool breeze'

699
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:47,384
'Within the mist that disappears
slowly into the cool breeze'

700
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:51,857
'We are flowers that blossom'

701
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:56,024
'The days don't end,
the fresh rains don't stop'

702
00:34:56,122 --> 00:35:00,127
'We unite, while both
the wings are unaware'

703
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:04,332
'Many colours drift apart,
and new colours bloom'

704
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:08,772
'There's a tune that's born
on its own in the heart'

705
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:51,395
'I kept looking at you, adoring you
just like the very first time I saw you'

706
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:08,142
'We never realized the rainbows
disappearing and the nights passing'

707
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:21,298
'Standing by your side, often'

708
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,634
'Seeing each other,
without exchanging words'

709
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:29,871
'Standing by your side, often'

710
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:33,884
'Seeing each other,
without exchanging words'

711
00:36:34,173 --> 00:36:40,248
'Did they leave on a chariot?'

712
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:44,087
'Did they leave without
saying anything?'

713
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:48,186
'The days don't end,
the fresh rains don't stop'

714
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:52,664
'We unite, while both
the wings are unaware'

715
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:56,864
'Many colours drift apart,
and new colours bloom'

716
00:36:56,993 --> 00:37:02,203
'There's a tune that's born
on its own in the heart'

717
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,672
It's my place, okay?

718
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,737
Hey! Savio bro!

719
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:11,782
Hey!

720
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:12,816
Sir, just a sec!

721
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:16,287
Hey man! What's up?
Long time, huh?

722
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:18,180
This is Pinky, my girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?

723
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,351
So she's girlfriend number?

724
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,191
I think...

725
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:23,692
It's 12th!

726
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:26,319
Aren't you happy?
- Hey bro! I have a presentation.

727
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:27,995
I'll catch you later.
You guys enjoy, okay?

728
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:29,765
Wait! Wait!

729
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,624
Which Savio?
Chef?

730
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:34,266
Yes. From Roger's cafe.

731
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:36,771
Were you a regular customer there?

732
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,998
That was my first time.

733
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:39,632
From then on, I became
a regular buff.

734
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:41,168
But his attitude!

735
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:42,371
Phew!

736
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:46,073
He is one of the very
best chefs in Kochi.

737
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:48,006
He can throw some attitude.

738
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:50,105
Do you know him personally?

739
00:37:51,073 --> 00:37:54,145
Between Savio, me and
that restaurant...

740
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:58,846
there's a strong
relationship of 3 months.

741
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,058
Actually, he's my mentor.

742
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:02,624
Who? Him?
How come?

743
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:05,123
Hey Savio!

744
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,629
Long time, no see!

745
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:09,666
Laurel & Hardy are together, huh?
- Not just us.

746
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,133
Meet Mr. Chaplin!
- Hello!

747
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:14,204
Like I said that day.. for a few days..
until he learns everything.

748
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,704
Just let him be with you.

749
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,640
After studying engineering, why
are you doing this, Vijay?

750
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,707
ls this necessary?

751
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,700
Actually, this is

752
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,901
Passion, right?

753
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:27,005
We usually appoint only those
who have done hotel management.

754
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,217
But I made them a promise.

755
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,352
With the heat in the kitchen,
and all the shouting from the customers,

756
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:36,882
you, who studied engineering,
would run away from here.

757
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:38,189
That I'm sure.

758
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:39,987
No. Never.

759
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:41,082
Let's see.

760
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:28,066
That's nice.

761
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:30,794
Your first preparation is ready to serve!

762
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,662
Give him a big round of applause!

763
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:36,139
Vijay...

764
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,869
Imagine the sight of the entire
audience standing up and applauding,

765
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,979
after a concert by Beethoven.

766
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:47,681
A chef also goes through the
same magical experience.

767
00:39:48,574 --> 00:39:49,847
There's that feeling we get

768
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:53,014
when we see someone relishing
the food we prepared, right?

769
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:54,188
That's it.

770
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:58,324
Look! Your first preparation.

771
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:07,925
Didn't I tell you?

772
00:40:08,124 --> 00:40:09,330
That I've seen you somewhere.

773
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:12,003
Hey! Don't tell me, it was me?

774
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:13,238
Was it?

775
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:17,940
Shouldn't you click a photo and frame
it like this, at that instant?

776
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:31,019
So actually, what's your next plan?

777
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:32,112
Yes.

778
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:33,681
Within one year...

779
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,956
on one of the beach roads...

780
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:37,992
I want to start a small restaurant.

781
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:40,254
Food quality should be our USP.

782
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:43,889
In the present situation,
would your dad agree?

783
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,024
I must make him agree!

784
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,163
Dad!
<i>‘</i> Yes!

785
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,732
How come you're early today?
- Yes.

786
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:55,001
Shall we go to the
Ganapathi temple then?

787
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,074
I was going to say that
to you myself, dad.

788
00:40:58,367 --> 00:40:59,311
Did you hear that, mom?

789
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:00,946
I did.

790
00:41:01,037 --> 00:41:04,210
This devotion is not something that should
come once in a while like the rains.

791
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:06,877
Understood? - Even though it's a little
late, I understood that, grandma!

792
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,577
Hereafter, I will be a regular devotee!

793
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,254
Did you tell him about that?

794
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:13,114
- No.
- Then you must have said it, mom.

795
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:15,259
No! I haven't said anything.

796
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:16,959
What is it, dad?

797
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,084
Bring that cover, dear.

798
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:22,130
You tell me. What's the reason
for this sudden devotion?

799
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:24,132
Dad...

800
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,968
A job that I should be
paying 2 or 3 lakhs for,

801
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,665
the biggest chef here promised to
place me into it for free!

802
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:32,273
To become a chef?
- Yes.

803
00:41:32,597 --> 00:41:33,371
That means, a cook?

804
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:36,238
ls that why I sent you
for engineering? - Dad!

805
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:38,108
It's my dream to
become a big chef

806
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:41,375
and start a beach restaurant
beside some beach here.

807
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:43,344
Your dream! I'll knock your head off!

808
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:44,616
You and your damn dream!

809
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,342
lam all helpless here.

810
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:50,254
Business is meant for people with
intelligence. Bring it here.

811
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:51,855
Here.

812
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:53,792
You should join on Monday morning.

813
00:41:53,915 --> 00:41:56,987
You needn't be in the hot sun or the rains.
Just sit in an AC office & attend calls!

814
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:58,188
Where?
- Our...

815
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,065
Manassery Raghu‘s friend, right?
It's a call centre that he runs.

816
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,132
Dad!

817
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,896
If we get 30,000 per month,
that would be a great relief.

818
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,561
Should I work at a call centre
after studying engineering?

819
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,765
After studying engineering, you want to
wash other‘s plates & serve them curries?

820
00:42:11,297 --> 00:42:13,037
Look who's boasting
about engineering!

821
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,168
Then say the spelling of
Thermodynamics correctly!

822
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,341
He wants to be a chef, it seems!

823
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,241
He wants to open a tea shop!

824
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,783
All parents behave the same way.

825
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,584
Emotional blackmailing.

826
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,980
When I couldn't tolerate the
emotional blackmailing anymore,

827
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,919
I had to go and join that call centre.

828
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:30,848
I found a girlfriend there.

829
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,783
She was my only relief.

830
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:36,763
A typical temple-dweller
type of a girl.

831
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,292
Typical temple-dweller type of girl.

832
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:41,792
It's like the title of
an Arundhati Roy book.

833
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:45,032
So you got a girlfriend.
And then?

834
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:46,932
Tell your mom I said Hi.

835
00:42:47,295 --> 00:42:49,831
Tell her who said Hi?
- Oh! Great!

836
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,801
You should take rest
for 3 days properly.

837
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:54,378
So you forgot
whatever I told you?

838
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:57,881
The main plan is to visit
temples with mom and aunt.

839
00:42:58,103 --> 00:42:59,013
So, no rest.

840
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:00,582
Call me, okay!

841
00:43:00,806 --> 00:43:03,547
Except the temple, I'll pick up
the phone everywhere else I am.

842
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:04,847
Will you call me?
- Of course!

843
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:06,282
Then tell me my number.

844
00:43:06,945 --> 00:43:07,855
Number...

845
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:09,185
It's the number I call
regularly, right?

846
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,589
So if you lose your phone somehow,
you won't call me?

847
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:15,620
Can't you remember at least the phone
numbers of people close to you, Vijay?

848
00:43:16,086 --> 00:43:17,030
Leave it.

849
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,035
Once more.

850
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:28,206
9207066221 .

851
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:30,107
Shall I go?

852
00:43:30,198 --> 00:43:31,108
Hey Reshu!
One minute.

853
00:43:34,134 --> 00:43:35,841
Didn't you say that you'll
be getting your salary late?

854
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,947
Here. Keep this.
- No need, Vijay.

855
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:40,779
You go and have fun
with your mom and aunt!

856
00:43:40,907 --> 00:43:42,079
Give them a surprise!

857
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:46,619
So, to remember me for three days,
keep this.

858
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,657
Until you come back, to remember you,
I will wear this on my neck like this,

859
00:43:51,817 --> 00:43:53,693
and keep it close to my heart.

860
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:55,988
SO 92070?

861
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,192
9207066221 .

862
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:01,227
Shall I go?
- Love you.

863
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:08,297
9207066221 .

864
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,538
What type of call centre was it?

865
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,877
To book hotels to stay
in India or abroad.

866
00:44:14,003 --> 00:44:15,538
You'll get them at best rates there.

867
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:17,310
Such a...

868
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,550
Then?

869
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:22,552
Sir, I don't have any cash with me.
That's why I'm asking for advance salary.

870
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:24,121
Go and work sincerely.

871
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:26,120
There's an inspection.
They will be here now.

872
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:28,750
Please don't compel me to
do anything bad, okay?

873
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:34,324
What?

874
00:44:34,654 --> 00:44:36,564
This is the girl from the
next building, right?

875
00:44:36,888 --> 00:44:38,128
ls your wedding over?

876
00:44:38,256 --> 00:44:39,234
It's my head-ache!

877
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:42,298
Okay.

878
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:44,835
That day, I got a nice phone call.

879
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:47,203
That turned everything
upside down for me.

880
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:48,741
Hello, Namaste.

881
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,112
Hello. My name is Jerry.

882
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:54,606
Thank you for saying your name.
Welcome to Holidays For You.

883
00:44:54,737 --> 00:44:56,683
How can I help you?

884
00:44:56,873 --> 00:45:00,251
I need a room for a quiet stay
at Thekkady or Munnar.

885
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:01,919
It's okay even if it's
a little expensive.

886
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:03,284
Find out..
- Definitely, sir.

887
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,852
Are you travelling with your family?

888
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:07,118
Errr... Yes. I'm travelling with family.

889
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:10,992
Okay. I'll forward the details of
3 resorts to your number, sir.

890
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:12,528
Please tell me your phone number.

891
00:45:12,652 --> 00:45:14,529
Sorry, I can't reveal my number.

892
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:15,792
I'll give you my wife's number.

893
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:17,760
92070. . .

894
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:19,131
66221 .

895
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:21,095
It's correct.

896
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:25,106
9207066221.
It's correct. Very correct.

897
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,631
How did you understand that?

898
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:31,147
9207066221

899
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:33,680
The number is correct.
- Isn't that Reshma‘s number?

900
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:35,882
How do you know Reshma?

901
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,314
Who is Reshma to you?

902
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:40,185
Who are you to ask me that?

903
00:45:40,843 --> 00:45:41,913
Tell me how you know Reshma!

904
00:45:42,311 --> 00:45:44,917
Tell me! You know who I am?
- Who is Reshma to you?

905
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:48,290
I needn't tell you whether she's my
wife or girlfriend, bloody idiot!

906
00:45:48,717 --> 00:45:50,560
ls she standing next to you now?
- If she is?

907
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:52,230
If so, give the phone to her.

908
00:45:52,654 --> 00:45:54,725
Give the phone to her.
I want to talk to her.

909
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:56,566
Give it to her, I say.

910
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:57,792
Give the phone to Reshma!

911
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:00,094
Hello Vijay!
- You liar!

912
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,267
You guys relax.
I'll manage it.

913
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:06,173
Everyone told me that no girl should
be trusted and I didn't listen.

914
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:10,212
'It's like that if you
touch the thorn of love'

915
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,611
'Lost my job,
lost my time'

916
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,217
'Slowly you will be
stranded on the streets, bro'

917
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,684
'She is gone,
that's awesome'

918
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:28,827
'The romance has become a mess, bro'

919
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:36,634
Now you understood
where you've seen me?

920
00:46:36,825 --> 00:46:39,065
Actually, it was Naresh who
showed this video to me.

921
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:43,733
We actually started talking about a big
plan, by talking about this video.

922
00:46:44,732 --> 00:46:47,541
This is called being struck by
lightning and then bitten by a snake.

923
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:50,772
Within a day, he lost his
job and his girlfriend.

924
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:54,684
We can realize what's happening
in outer space sitting here.

925
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:57,687
But we can't understand what's
happening in the mind of people we love,

926
00:46:57,777 --> 00:46:59,778
even if we sit right next to them.

927
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:01,122
Hey!

928
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,052
Stop your philosophy.

929
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:05,855
For God's sake, can you tell me
that business plan of yours?

930
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:09,729
Restaurant.

931
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,930
Restaurant?

932
00:47:11,655 --> 00:47:12,565
Are you mad?

933
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:14,028
One more restaurant in this town?

934
00:47:14,224 --> 00:47:18,195
I thought you were going to say
some new, innovative idea.

935
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:25,676
Hey Pinky!

936
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,081
The first quality a partner needs
is to listen to the whole thing,

937
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,513
and then giving an opinion.

938
00:47:31,672 --> 00:47:32,946
Sorry.
Tell me.

939
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:34,117
Tell me your idea.

940
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:37,711
Have you heard about food trucks?

941
00:47:38,278 --> 00:47:41,088
Like the ‘Khaana-gaadis‘
in Delhi & Mumbai?

942
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,590
Food-vehicle?

943
00:47:43,148 --> 00:47:44,718
Restaurant on wheels!
- Exactly!

944
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:47,254
But ours won't be just
a street food set up.

945
00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:50,598
We will provide the same food
quality as a four star hotel.

946
00:47:50,888 --> 00:47:52,663
We'll set it at a place
which is not so busy.

947
00:47:53,091 --> 00:47:56,163
Working time,
say from... <i>7</i> PM to 12 AM.

948
00:47:56,828 --> 00:48:00,570
People should gradually know
about this and come to us.

949
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:03,233
See. This is just an outline.
- Okay.

950
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,474
We shouldn't just
serve the food somehow.

951
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,509
It's look and feel is important.

952
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,113
AR Rahman‘s songs...

953
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:12,575
Or any melodious song...

954
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:13,947
We would play them in low volume.

955
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:16,054
Those who want to sing,
can sing too.

956
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:19,490
Those who bring violins and guitars,
can play that too.

957
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:21,249
We'll get great support from the media.

958
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:24,056
Youngsters and riders
would also support us.

959
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:27,087
And the most important thing is...

960
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:30,592
This concept would bring
a good name to us.

961
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:32,928
Among the common people.

962
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:41,609
Hi.
- Hi.

963
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:43,771
Pooja was waiting here?

964
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:45,773
She reached quite some time back.

965
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:47,514
Hey bro!

966
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,282
Hi guys! Are you ready?
- Yup.

967
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:50,945
Two minutes!
- Okay!

968
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,020
What is this, dear?

969
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:57,213
It's just a few hours ride
from here to Bangalore.

970
00:48:58,614 --> 00:49:00,116
I'll come back after 2 weeks,
on your birthday.

971
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,220
Let's have lunch together, okay?
- Okay.

972
00:49:02,784 --> 00:49:05,128
I need to tell daddy about our
business and get money from him.

973
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,488
Then...

974
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:09,031
Most important thing...
A next step in our relationship...

975
00:49:09,123 --> 00:49:10,033
I mean...

976
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:12,830
Just an okay from my family's side.

977
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,704
For a namesake.

978
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:16,806
Here.
- What is this?

979
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:17,906
For your parents.

980
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:21,871
Hey Naresh!

981
00:49:22,101 --> 00:49:23,204
Let's move on!
- Okay.

982
00:49:23,702 --> 00:49:24,612
Let's go.

983
00:49:25,036 --> 00:49:28,108
To meet again and again, it's good to
be separated once in a while like this.

984
00:49:29,908 --> 00:49:30,851
Shall I leave?

985
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:33,787
See you!

986
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:45,088
She has come with a new
idea to waste money!

987
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,130
Food business!

988
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:48,497
As if she has a lot of
knowledge about food!

989
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:53,228
I'm asking only for 10 Lakhs from the
money kept aside for my wedding.

990
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:55,835
If you keep wagging your
tongue again, I'll slap you.

991
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:56,973
10 Lakhs?

992
00:49:57,198 --> 00:49:58,733
ls it a small amount?

993
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,673
Are you sure that it
would be successful?

994
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:03,746
Dad!

995
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,210
Are you 100% sure?

996
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:07,951
I haven't asked this the
last 2 times, but...

997
00:50:10,009 --> 00:50:11,989
Dad, trust me.
This time I'll make it happen.

998
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,221
It's fine, right?

999
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,554
Would I sell it to you if
it wasn't fine, Venu Sir?

1000
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:26,197
Shall we sign the sale letter then?
- Let's sit upstairs, sir.

1001
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:27,600
Please.

1002
00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:28,767
I'll sign it and come.

1003
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:29,835
Get in.

1004
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,106
Hello.

1005
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:35,301
Hello!

1006
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:37,973
I haven't been able to
reach you for 3-4 days.

1007
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,576
You're really busy, huh?

1008
00:50:40,102 --> 00:50:41,842
No problem.
I can understand.

1009
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,580
And yeah...

1010
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:46,043
I'm sitting on a hot seat now.
- Hot seat?

1011
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,643
Yeah. I thought I'll say
that to my partner.

1012
00:50:48,776 --> 00:50:49,685
Naresh!

1013
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:51,152
There's a surprise.
- Keep quiet.

1014
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:52,788
Pinky...

1015
00:50:52,979 --> 00:50:54,014
What all are you saying?

1016
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,557
I didn't get you.
- Why do you sound upset?

1017
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:57,820
Anything at home?
- No.

1018
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,860
Nothing.

1019
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,089
Hey Naresh! Don't be
tensed about anything.

1020
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,097
Just be with me, confidently.

1021
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:04,756
What did Pooja say in between?

1022
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:05,899
Some surprise?

1023
00:51:06,023 --> 00:51:06,933
That...

1024
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:09,262
She was just reminding
about the birthday...

1025
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:10,603
Okay.

1026
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:12,035
There are just 5 more days.

1027
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:14,641
Lunch with me.

1028
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:15,642
You had promised.

1029
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:19,742
Hello!
What happened?

1030
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:22,913
I'm telling you! If it's about
the business, don't be worried.

1031
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,876
It will work out, 100%.

1032
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,050
<i>Okay
- Okay?</i>

1033
00:51:26,574 --> 00:51:27,552
Isn't it double okay?

1034
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:28,913
What's there not to work out?

1035
00:51:29,277 --> 00:51:31,279
Actually, your business
is plan is really unique.

1036
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,522
I used to think earlier...

1037
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:36,092
The most expensive
seats on flights...

1038
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:39,526
why they are not called engineer's
class or doctor's class,

1039
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,155
and they are called
business class instead.

1040
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:43,732
Only you businessmen have money!

1041
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:45,167
Hey! Come on!

1042
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,229
Have you ever tried
to do any business?

1043
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,768
Not any business as such.

1044
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,739
But I had worked out an
awesome plan to make money!

1045
00:51:54,932 --> 00:51:55,842
What?

1046
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:58,941
The day I met that
bloody idiot once again.

1047
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:01,613
Hey!

1048
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:03,214
Look! It's him.

1049
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,518
Who?

1050
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:06,745
That scoundrel Cleetus.

1051
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:08,953
The one who put up
my video on YouTube!

1052
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,022
That bloody rascal.

1053
00:52:10,245 --> 00:52:11,952
I don't want your job.

1054
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,755
We are all fools, wasting time here.

1055
00:52:31,864 --> 00:52:32,774
Don't hit me.

1056
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:35,545
Please don't humiliate me
in front of that foreigner.

1057
00:52:35,668 --> 00:52:36,577
Please.

1058
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:37,711
What happened?

1059
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:40,141
Not happened. - What?
- He mistook" I mean..

1060
00:52:40,271 --> 00:52:41,579
He changed the person!

1061
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:43,549
You sit in the chair.
- Okay.

1062
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:45,118
Don't humiliate me.

1063
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,613
What I did to you was
sheer treachery!

1064
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:50,247
Vijay, don't leave him without hitting him.
Or else, we'll hit him.

1065
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:51,886
Are you sure?
- Any doubt?

1066
00:52:53,282 --> 00:52:55,956
If so, do you have any trouble
in taking me away & hitting me?

1067
00:52:56,052 --> 00:52:57,224
You're such a parasite!

1068
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,224
Am I not?

1069
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:01,557
I was just a peon at that call centre.

1070
00:53:01,857 --> 00:53:04,963
I just put up his video on YouTube,
just for fun.

1071
00:53:05,793 --> 00:53:07,466
After a month, I got a mail.

1072
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:09,708
There's a cheque of 10,000 Rupees.
Come & collect it.

1073
00:53:09,797 --> 00:53:11,174
Cheque? - Yes.
- What for?

1074
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:12,804
The video became viral, right?

1075
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:16,174
That's when I knew that, for every
single view, like and share,

1076
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:20,914
YouTube has a strange habit of
paying money to the uploader.

1077
00:53:21,507 --> 00:53:22,815
By going there to
collect cheques,

1078
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:24,620
I got introduced
to this foreigner.

1079
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:26,578
She gave me a job in YouTube.

1080
00:53:27,011 --> 00:53:28,513
Hence I became YouTube Cleetus.

1081
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,950
This is my life story.

1082
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,561
If we spare you without hitting you,
what will you give us?

1083
00:53:32,683 --> 00:53:33,593
Compensation.

1084
00:53:33,884 --> 00:53:34,794
Cash!

1085
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:36,528
Here we go!

1086
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,830
This is my contact.

1087
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:39,499
Just WhatsApp your location...

1088
00:53:39,756 --> 00:53:41,166
I'll reach there with
the compensation.

1089
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:42,167
What else will we get?

1090
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:43,701
Then...

1091
00:53:43,826 --> 00:53:45,499
To make money through
social media...

1092
00:53:45,861 --> 00:53:47,704
there are thousands and
thousands of ways!

1093
00:53:48,163 --> 00:53:50,609
I'll teach you all that.

1094
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,510
H ow?

1095
00:53:54,035 --> 00:53:54,979
Action!

1096
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:58,572
'Wear Kitex Lungis and come'

1097
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:03,213
You guys are good!

1098
00:54:03,509 --> 00:54:04,647
What is this, man?

1099
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:05,721
Trust me.

1100
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:09,648
Here.
25,000 Rupees.

1101
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:11,056
The compensation I told you about.

1102
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:14,496
Viral videos are my daily bread now.

1103
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,993
I just make prank videos, and use my
influence at YouTube to make it a hit,

1104
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,658
and then make money from them!

1105
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,798
If we can make money out of it,
teach it to us as well, Cleetus.

1106
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,496
Dude, prank videos are like...

1107
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,038
making fools out of people...

1108
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,837
It's a shady job!

1109
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,168
But if we do it with the co-operation
of people, it's not like that.

1110
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:33,207
Watc h !

1111
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:38,108
80 Lakh views?

1112
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:40,076
Dude, let's do this.

1113
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:44,148
What if this Cleetus is God's own Cleetus?

1114
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:45,183
He might be.

1115
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:50,220
Even though we
can make money..

1116
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,586
Nothing more.
We're doing this prank video, right?

1117
00:54:52,685 --> 00:54:54,722
Yes. For sure!
- That's it.

1118
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:59,492
Then we will start from a
bus stop auspiciously!

1119
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:02,565
So all of you understood
everything, right?

1120
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:05,602
Just for five minutes,
all of you should act for us.

1121
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:06,931
He is quite smart.

1122
00:55:07,064 --> 00:55:08,941
All of you can reach to
the extent of hitting me,

1123
00:55:09,066 --> 00:55:10,204
but for God's sake,
no one should hit me.

1124
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,638
What if we hit you?

1125
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,141
If you hit, the programme
will be successful.

1126
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:14,176
But don't hit him.

1127
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,140
The camera is over there.

1128
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:17,846
Saw that?
- They are our friends.

1129
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:19,783
Until I say, no one should
look into the camera.

1130
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:22,184
Finish this off before
the bus comes, okay?

1131
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:24,013
Definitely.
- Which channel is this for?

1132
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,887
It's an international channel.

1133
00:55:26,548 --> 00:55:27,754
Then start!
- Okay then.

1134
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:29,593
You don't need this.

1135
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:32,095
Don't take it off. People
will watch this, right?

1136
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:34,096
Don't be like Neymar.
Act naturally.

1137
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,863
So, all the best!
Burn and die!

1138
00:55:37,023 --> 00:55:38,593
I'll rock.
- All the best.

1139
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,795
Son, is this original petrol?

1140
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:41,497
Who will burn petrol like this?

1141
00:55:41,594 --> 00:55:42,572
Well, from the colour...

1142
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:43,605
It's just water.
Smell it.

1143
00:55:43,762 --> 00:55:44,672
True.
- It's water.

1144
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:47,505
What happened? - Have arranged
everything. We just have to shoot it now.

1145
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:48,971
That will be awesome.

1146
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:52,112
Don't forget that this is acting.
Since I'm going to be very natural.

1147
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,516
Beautiful frame.
- Dude, two ladies are coming.

1148
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:55,549
Awesome!

1149
00:55:55,673 --> 00:55:57,515
This will be great. Shoot fast.
- Let's try to work this out with them.

1150
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:00,479
Two people..
Okay, right?

1151
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,819
Two ladies are coming.
All of you should co-operate, okay!

1152
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,825
All the best.
- Just hug me from here.

1153
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:07,859
You should say don't light it, okay?

1154
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:09,156
Leave me!

1155
00:56:10,686 --> 00:56:11,993
O blind world!

1156
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:13,928
Who is that?

1157
00:56:14,088 --> 00:56:15,624
I don't want to live here.

1158
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:16,794
He is rocking.

1159
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:17,802
Listen to us.

1160
00:56:17,892 --> 00:56:19,461
Harthals that come up daily!

1161
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:21,101
The rising fuel prices!

1162
00:56:21,195 --> 00:56:22,868
Notes in green & yellow colours!

1163
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:23,940
I don't want to live here.

1164
00:56:24,031 --> 00:56:26,738
Such lame dialogues.
I'd have done better.

1165
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:28,903
Chet-ta, anyone?
Chechi, please light it.

1166
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:32,106
No one will burn me?
Or else, I'll make those ladies burn me.

1167
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:34,445
Chechis, please burn me.
I don't want to live in this world.

1168
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:39,183
Chechi, how to go to Thoppumpady?

1169
00:56:39,478 --> 00:56:41,616
Where?
- Dude, two guys with helmets.

1170
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:42,723
Look there.

1171
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,124
These 2 are not in the script.
- How many kilometres from here?

1172
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:48,596
Dude, let's go!
Come on, fast.

1173
00:56:49,486 --> 00:56:50,863
Oh no! My chain!

1174
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:54,601
Catch them!
- Stop there!

1175
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:56,864
My chain of 4.5 sovereigns!

1176
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:58,835
Catch them!
- The chain!

1177
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:00,597
Hey! Don't worry, Chechi.

1178
00:57:00,763 --> 00:57:02,173
Your chain hasn't gone anywhere.

1179
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,669
This is a TV programme.

1180
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:05,767
Look at the camera!

1181
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:06,937
Awesome!

1182
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:10,141
My neck is hurting like anything.
I think there's a cut.

1183
00:57:10,537 --> 00:57:12,448
Your damn TV programme!

1184
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:15,452
'Everything has gone for a toss'

1185
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:18,079
Give me my chain!

1186
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,184
Call the chain snatcher.

1187
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,980
Sir, to call the chain snatcher..

1188
00:57:21,113 --> 00:57:22,786
Royally messed up!

1189
00:57:23,948 --> 00:57:26,690
'All the tricks were wasted'

1190
00:57:26,885 --> 00:57:28,887
'Dreams have been
stranded on the streets'

1191
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,522
Escape!
- You too, Cleetus!

1192
00:57:36,793 --> 00:57:37,827
Give her the money.

1193
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:39,071
Here.

1194
00:57:39,862 --> 00:57:42,172
Try to do some decent job, man!

1195
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:43,806
Fooling people?

1196
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:45,502
Then shall we?
- Okay.

1197
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:46,545
Such a disgrace.

1198
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:47,545
Vijay, wait.

1199
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:53,140
I'm not telling this to
Chandran for the time being.

1200
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:55,819
If you're doing this to
repay the debt at home,

1201
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:57,784
you shouldn't be fooling
people for that.

1202
00:57:57,945 --> 00:57:59,446
You should listen to us elders.

1203
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:02,792
We will find a girl
from a rich household.

1204
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:05,091
If you try to object...

1205
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:09,657
Life is not your fun and games!

1206
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:10,933
Remember that.

1207
00:58:11,123 --> 00:58:12,932
So it's for dowry...

1208
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,867
It's not because I'm interested.

1209
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,798
But our situation is such...

1210
00:58:18,096 --> 00:58:22,601
Hey! Even if I do get married one day,
I won't pay a single Rupee as dowry.

1211
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,406
Then why has your dad offered
75 Lakhs or 1 Crore?

1212
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,479
My dad?

1213
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,570
1 Crore?
- Yes.

1214
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:28,880
Dream on!

1215
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,017
The next round is here.

1216
00:58:32,107 --> 00:58:33,085
Pinky!
- Yes.

1217
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:34,710
Take this.
- Okay.

1218
00:58:34,843 --> 00:58:35,753
Hey Vijay!

1219
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:37,888
Hi aunty.
- Not aunty. Chechi.

1220
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,454
You're still there, right?

1221
00:58:39,547 --> 00:58:41,720
Yes.
- Pinky, Ganeshan will come now.

1222
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:42,758
Okay.

1223
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:44,051
Who is this Ganeshan?

1224
00:58:44,485 --> 00:58:45,190
The carpenter.

1225
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:47,598
Shouldn't we get the door open?

1226
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:51,027
That reminds me...

1227
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:53,069
We didn't finish that story...

1228
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,637
The one who said he'll
come on your birthday...

1229
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,441
What happened to your business?

1230
00:59:02,734 --> 00:59:04,940
To give a surprise to Naresh that day,

1231
00:59:05,402 --> 00:59:06,881
I took my parents also along.

1232
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:09,510
When we came here, this
place was quite crowded.

1233
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,079
But now, we are the only ones here.

1234
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,016
It's already 4 o'clock now.

1235
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:14,950
If he's not coming, can't he...

1236
00:59:15,512 --> 00:59:16,582
call and say that?

1237
00:59:16,913 --> 00:59:17,947
It's still switched off.

1238
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,926
Do you still think that
he's gonna keep his word?

1239
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:23,562
Do you...

1240
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:25,061
Uncle!

1241
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,491
Do you want us to wait
till the evening?

1242
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:28,899
Tell me.

1243
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:29,933
We can!

1244
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,662
We'll do what you say for today!

1245
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:34,535
After that, you should
do what we say!

1246
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,735
What kind of a sadist is he?

1247
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:41,839
Today is your birthday.

1248
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:46,606
Has he taken any money from you,
in the name of business?

1249
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:51,979
He's online now.

1250
01:00:00,618 --> 01:00:04,463
The number you're trying
to reach is switched off.

1251
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:17,440
We can tell anyone to learn
by suffering on their own.

1252
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:20,135
But we can't say that
to our own daughter.

1253
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:25,745
Think from our point of view,
just for a second.

1254
01:00:27,974 --> 01:00:29,543
Be a little more softer, Venuetta...

1255
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,515
She has become like this,
because of your pampering.

1256
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,835
You won such a big lottery!

1257
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:52,834
Imagine if you had married him...

1258
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:58,233
Did you notice something?

1259
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,480
Even after we shared so many things,

1260
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,879
there's nothing common between us.

1261
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:07,080
Common...

1262
01:01:07,675 --> 01:01:08,585
Right?

1263
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:10,745
I think...

1264
01:01:16,516 --> 01:01:18,996
Sorry.. Surya... No, Vijay...

1265
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:20,689
You got scared, right?

1266
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:22,530
Sorry, dear.

1267
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:24,531
No, uncle.
We should be saying sorry.

1268
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:26,828
No. We made a blunder.

1269
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,893
Yeah. The door shutting like
that was a big blunder.

1270
01:01:29,026 --> 01:01:29,970
It's not about the door.

1271
01:01:30,628 --> 01:01:31,936
We've come to the wrong house.

1272
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:33,940
We had to go to a
different house.

1273
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,476
I realized the blunder, when
I got a call from there.

1274
01:01:36,566 --> 01:01:41,571
In the tension of this door getting jammed,
we forgot to clear that between ourselves.

1275
01:01:41,804 --> 01:01:43,442
Let's leave then.
Come.

1276
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:45,577
Sorry, my mistake.
- Bye, dear.

1277
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:47,180
Okay then.

1278
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:48,713
I forgot to ask that.

1279
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:47,862
I think this is the place.

1280
01:02:50,997 --> 01:02:51,907
Pournami.

1281
01:02:53,265 --> 01:02:54,335
This is the place.
- Yes.

1282
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,207
Didn't you see those serial lights?

1283
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:57,378
Yes. That's it.

1284
01:02:58,404 --> 01:02:59,905
Nice, right?

1285
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:00,947
Mom, isn't this okay?

1286
01:03:02,139 --> 01:03:03,482
Surya, didn't you
tuck in your shirt?

1287
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:05,053
Didn't you see me when I left home?

1288
01:03:05,243 --> 01:03:07,313
Tuck it in at least when
you're going to see a bride!

1289
01:03:07,544 --> 01:03:09,080
I'm telling you.
Tuck it in!

1290
01:03:09,212 --> 01:03:11,249
Don't waste time arguing.
You do it.

1291
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:13,151
She's obsessive.
- Hey!

1292
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,557
Keeps repeating the same thing!

1293
01:03:14,884 --> 01:03:17,023
This is really a torture.

1294
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:18,196
Tuck it in.

1295
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:19,391
Make it fast.

1296
01:03:19,522 --> 01:03:21,126
Dad, just a minute.
- We're already late.

1297
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:23,395
Why are you irritating me?

1298
01:03:23,525 --> 01:03:24,435
You are?

1299
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,969
We've come to see the bride...

1300
01:03:28,029 --> 01:03:30,167
Referred by Raghu of SBT?
- Yes.

1301
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,174
The same.

1302
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:33,077
You became quite late, right?

1303
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:34,976
It took some time to
cross the stadium.

1304
01:03:35,169 --> 01:03:36,306
There's a match today, right?

1305
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:37,904
Cricket!
- Yes.

1306
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:39,482
Who are we playing against?

1307
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:40,944
America.
- Oh God!

1308
01:03:41,207 --> 01:03:42,584
Mom!
- Against America?

1309
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:44,483
Cricket.
- Isn't that so?

1310
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:46,389
Sri Lanka.
- Yes. Sri Lanka.

1311
01:03:46,578 --> 01:03:47,886
Yeah. Sorry.

1312
01:03:48,013 --> 01:03:49,549
Please come.
- Okay.

1313
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:52,987
Can't you behave properly
at least when we come out?

1314
01:03:53,117 --> 01:03:54,892
Please come.

1315
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:57,396
When you were late, I realized
you must be stuck in some block.

1316
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,363
I don't have the habit
of following up.

1317
01:03:59,489 --> 01:04:01,491
Then he said we should try calling you.

1318
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:02,530
That's why I called.

1319
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:04,167
That was good.
- Please come.

1320
01:04:07,062 --> 01:04:09,099
Hey! What are you thinking about?

1321
01:04:09,398 --> 01:04:10,308
Move.

1322
01:04:11,566 --> 01:04:13,307
Sudha, ask them to bring tea.

1323
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,876
Chechi, bring it.
- Coming.

1324
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:26,021
So Vijay...

1325
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:28,018
You're done with engineering.

1326
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:29,257
okay»-

1327
01:04:29,482 --> 01:04:31,120
And you said that
you're not working now.

1328
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,993
So, tell me Vijay.

1329
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:34,486
What's your goal?

1330
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,030
What's your aim?

1331
01:04:39,924 --> 01:04:41,129
To start something of my own...

1332
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:42,531
Like..
- Business?

1333
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:43,838
Business!

1334
01:04:44,061 --> 01:04:45,438
Good! Good!

1335
01:04:45,996 --> 01:04:50,239
If you have the caliber, starting
something on your own is a very good idea.

1336
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:52,444
Oh sorry! I forgot to introduce.

1337
01:04:52,568 --> 01:04:54,979
This is my cousin and his wife.

1338
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:56,878
Namaste.
- We are basically from Adoor.

1339
01:04:57,072 --> 01:04:57,982
What about your wife?

1340
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:00,076
We are separated.

1341
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,983
I don't like hiding anything.

1342
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:06,051
I've been frank about everything.

1343
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:07,552
Have it.

1344
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:09,892
Okay.

1345
01:05:10,016 --> 01:05:11,927
If they have to ask or talk anything,

1346
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:13,357
let them have some privacy.

1347
01:05:13,586 --> 01:05:15,224
Oh no! ls that necessary?

1348
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:17,824
ls that necessary?
That's the most important thing.

1349
01:05:18,457 --> 01:05:19,595
Go and get to know each other.

1350
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:21,269
Go, Sonam.

1351
01:05:24,896 --> 01:05:25,601
Go, dude.

1352
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:29,572
Don't enter the room.
Go to the balcony and talk.

1353
01:05:29,868 --> 01:05:31,039
Yes! Yes!

1354
01:05:31,234 --> 01:05:32,577
What's the confusion?

1355
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:33,574
Go ahead!

1356
01:05:38,908 --> 01:05:40,182
Your fly is undone.

1357
01:05:41,043 --> 01:05:41,953
Sorry?

1358
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:44,255
Zip.

1359
01:05:50,185 --> 01:05:51,095
Sorry.

1360
01:05:51,486 --> 01:05:52,395
What is it?

1361
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:55,096
Nothing.
- No! There is something.

1362
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:57,168
Nothing, right?
- Then why did you say sorry?

1363
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:00,100
What is this, Surya?
ls this how I have raised you?

1364
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:03,206
When you say sorry to elders,
shouldn't you touch their feet?

1365
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,239
What for?

1366
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,172
Go! Touch uncle's feet.

1367
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:07,834
Mom, please.

1368
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:09,974
What's the need for all that?
- Yes.

1369
01:06:10,302 --> 01:06:12,908
We have raised him in a
very traditional way.

1370
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:15,107
He said sorry because
he did something wrong.

1371
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:16,407
Don't waste time.

1372
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,286
Go ahead, son.
Touch uncle's feet.

1373
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:19,319
What's happening?

1374
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,013
Why should he touch my feet now?

1375
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:24,284
Even though we didn't see it,
I understood that he did something wrong.

1376
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,393
Go, son.
Touch uncle's feet.

1377
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:30,324
Did you forget what I taught you?
- Sorry.

1378
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:31,889
Tell him!

1379
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:33,532
Hey! Your mother is mad.
Do it fast.

1380
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:34,561
Go ahead, son.

1381
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:39,093
This is totally unnecessary.
- Then what!

1382
01:06:41,129 --> 01:06:42,038
Hi.

1383
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:43,940
Sorry uncle.

1384
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:47,005
Oh my dear Lord!

1385
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:51,540
It's all right.

1386
01:06:51,904 --> 01:06:53,144
It's all right.
I can manage.

1387
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:57,451
All is well.

1388
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:06,793
What are you thinking?

1389
01:07:09,453 --> 01:07:11,523
To smoke a cigarette...

1390
01:07:11,954 --> 01:07:12,864
Huh?

1391
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:15,098
To smoke a cigarette...

1392
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:17,293
When I'm tensed..
- Okay. One second.

1393
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:19,971
Hey!

1394
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:22,071
That's okay.
- No, no! That's fine.

1395
01:07:22,364 --> 01:07:23,434
I believe in astrology.

1396
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:25,036
I think it's a science.

1397
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:28,004
That's why I asked for the horoscope
and photo initially itself.

1398
01:07:28,936 --> 01:07:30,381
It's an 8 on 10 match.

1399
01:07:30,871 --> 01:07:31,941
It's really good.

1400
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:33,875
It's not the financial background...

1401
01:07:34,307 --> 01:07:36,810
Progressive attitude,
energetic...

1402
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,045
educated...

1403
01:07:38,411 --> 01:07:40,356
And a boy who has great lineage.

1404
01:07:40,479 --> 01:07:41,958
That's what we were looking for.

1405
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,388
If so, he's a good option, uncle.

1406
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:45,189
We're not saying this
because he's our friend.

1407
01:07:45,317 --> 01:07:47,455
Our parents ask us to
learn from him always.

1408
01:07:47,785 --> 01:07:49,196
Oh, is it?
- Yeah. - No!

1409
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:50,527
Don't take that seriously.

1410
01:07:50,855 --> 01:07:52,835
They are saying that because
they are his friends.

1411
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,026
He has no quality that can
be called extraordinary.

1412
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:56,203
Just an average...

1413
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,297
I like your frankness.
- Thank you.

1414
01:07:59,429 --> 01:08:01,499
My daughter is a little weak in studies.

1415
01:08:02,164 --> 01:08:03,939
She hasn't completed
her post graduation.

1416
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,910
But she's continuing her
studies privately now.

1417
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:08,810
It will be over in four months.

1418
01:08:09,237 --> 01:08:12,013
We can think
about the marriage, after that...

1419
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,051
Well.. But if they like each other.

1420
01:08:14,442 --> 01:08:15,351
Hey!

1421
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:25,989
Uncle is awesome huh?

1422
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:28,091
Daddy doesn't smoke.

1423
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:31,933
Then?

1424
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:39,306
One more thing.

1425
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:41,101
I'm being very frank.

1426
01:08:41,499 --> 01:08:43,775
You didn't ask.
That's your decency.

1427
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:47,108
Everything that's mine,
belongs to my daughter.

1428
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,875
By everything I mean, everything!

1429
01:08:52,908 --> 01:08:54,854
We had never thought about it.

1430
01:08:55,244 --> 01:08:56,450
What's there in all that?

1431
01:08:56,879 --> 01:08:58,516
We just need your daughter alone.

1432
01:09:00,848 --> 01:09:01,758
By the way...

1433
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:05,326
this property where this house is
standing, how many cents would it be?

1434
01:09:08,355 --> 01:09:10,164
Around 50 cents.

1435
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:11,759
What's there in all that, right?

1436
01:09:12,259 --> 01:09:13,532
They are back.
- Phew.

1437
01:09:14,494 --> 01:09:15,837
Yes! Come, come!

1438
01:09:16,062 --> 01:09:17,302
Sit down.

1439
01:09:18,965 --> 01:09:21,001
What can you know about each
other in 5 minutes, right?

1440
01:09:21,132 --> 01:09:23,043
It's just the time to
smoke a cigarette, right?

1441
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:26,113
So...

1442
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:27,507
I'll tell you a plan.

1443
01:09:27,971 --> 01:09:30,008
Let Vijay and Sonam go
for a lunch together.

1444
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:32,045
It can be after 3-4 days.

1445
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:36,222
Then they would be able to talk much more
in detail, and get to know each other.

1446
01:09:36,512 --> 01:09:37,354
What do you say?

1447
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:39,283
That's a good thing.
Nice.

1448
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:42,021
Then, shall we wind up for today?

1449
01:09:42,184 --> 01:09:43,424
Okay! So be it.

1450
01:09:43,752 --> 01:09:44,958
Let's leave then.

1451
01:09:46,188 --> 01:09:48,099
Okay. Nice meeting.
- Same here.

1452
01:09:48,223 --> 01:09:49,132
See you again soon.

1453
01:09:49,257 --> 01:09:50,497
See you, young man!
- Sure.

1454
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,168
So, what do you do?

1455
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,104
Actually we are music directors from
India, Kochi, Palluruthy, Veli..

1456
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:56,405
Interesting.

1457
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,734
So do you do ad film jingles?

1458
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:02,869
Of course! Popy umbrellas, Johns umbrellas,
Scooby Day, Nirapara, Dhathri, etc, etc...

1459
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:04,747
Oh! That's nice.

1460
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:05,813
Just a minute.

1461
01:10:09,841 --> 01:10:10,751
What is this?

1462
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:11,785
This...

1463
01:10:13,278 --> 01:10:15,121
This is a product
marketed by my company...

1464
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:17,215
...to get rid of ringworm
infections on the foot.

1465
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:19,452
Shylac.
Can you make a tune for this?

1466
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,362
Why not!
Of course! Simple.

1467
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:22,930
Fine.
- Shylac. Nice name.

1468
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:24,123
Well, aren't you coming?

1469
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,824
We're just making the time
little more productive.

1470
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,502
3172.

1471
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:33,169
Yes, 3 dozen.
Send it today itself.

1472
01:10:34,062 --> 01:10:34,972
Dad...

1473
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,038
Do you have the address of those
who came with the wrong address?

1474
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,974
Satheesh, one minute. Those
who came with the wrong address?

1475
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:40,077
Do you have their address?

1476
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:43,040
They came to the wrong address, right?
Then how can I have theirs?

1477
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,309
Do you have it or not?
- ls it urgent? I'll search for it.

1478
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:48,343
Would be great if I get it.
- What's the matter?

1479
01:10:48,908 --> 01:10:49,943
That's there!
- Hey!

1480
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,848
Can't you go in an auto?
Why should you go out in the hot sun?

1481
01:10:53,011 --> 01:10:54,115
Hey! Helmet.

1482
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:58,489
Those who ride two wheelers
should wear helmets compulsorily.

1483
01:10:58,984 --> 01:11:00,360
<i>Very funny!
Bye!</i>

1484
01:11:00,484 --> 01:11:03,124
'Oh my Yesudas'

1485
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,130
Yeah! Correct.

1486
01:11:05,456 --> 01:11:08,959
'Apply Shylac to get rid
of ringworm infections'

1487
01:11:09,192 --> 01:11:12,196
'Apply Shylac to get rid
of ringworm infections'

1488
01:11:12,329 --> 01:11:15,935
'To get rid of the infection completely,
Shylac is on my leg'

1489
01:11:16,098 --> 01:11:19,978
'Shylac is on my leg,
Shylac is always with me'

1490
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:21,147
'Oh dear Stephen Devassy'

1491
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,208
We don't need this.

1492
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:24,783
Isn't this Mowgly‘s song?

1493
01:11:24,873 --> 01:11:26,147
Get lost!
This is my original track.

1494
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,209
Bullshit.

1495
01:11:28,443 --> 01:11:30,786
Mr. Vijay, aren't you hearing all this?

1496
01:11:30,944 --> 01:11:32,981
It's a tune he's making for
your future father in law.

1497
01:11:33,113 --> 01:11:34,922
Didn't he find any other
product to market?

1498
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:36,219
Medicine to get rid of infection?

1499
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:37,794
What?
- No. Ringworm infection.

1500
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:38,952
It needs to be cured, right?

1501
01:11:39,051 --> 01:11:39,961
Well...

1502
01:11:40,253 --> 01:11:41,357
you sit here and make music.

1503
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:43,757
I'll go and make some gruel.
Okay?

1504
01:11:45,023 --> 01:11:47,867
Vijay, what are you thinking about?
It's been a long time.

1505
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,968
Dude... She...

1506
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:55,034
Dude, it became all right when I
changed the tempo. 4 by 4. - Get lost!

1507
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,910
Just a minute.

1508
01:11:58,935 --> 01:11:59,845
Yes, dad.

1509
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:01,338
Oh! Family drama.
- Son...

1510
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:06,851
I'll go right away.

1511
01:12:07,943 --> 01:12:08,853
Okay dad.

1512
01:12:15,216 --> 01:12:16,786
Long time, sir.

1513
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:18,486
Isn't uncle here?
- Yes. Go!

1514
01:12:19,953 --> 01:12:21,899
Uncle...
- Oh! You?

1515
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:25,993
Dad said he tried to reach you a lot on
the phone. He couldn't get you. - So?

1516
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,502
I didn't pick up
because I was busy!

1517
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,203
I'll call back when I please.

1518
01:12:29,328 --> 01:12:30,500
That's the routine, right?

1519
01:12:30,996 --> 01:12:32,498
You owe quite a lot of
money to dad, right?

1520
01:12:32,998 --> 01:12:35,807
Dad keeps calling to say that he needs to
do a lot of things after getting that.

1521
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,811
So you've come to teach me justice?

1522
01:12:38,036 --> 01:12:40,914
ls there any proof
that I owe him money?

1523
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:43,017
Uncle, I haven't come for an argument.

1524
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:47,116
After dad's accident,
the situation at home is quite terrible.

1525
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,221
You know without me saying, right?

1526
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:52,254
80 Lakhs is worth more
than Crores to us.

1527
01:12:52,415 --> 01:12:54,224
After losing money because
of his foolishness,

1528
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,760
where can I pay up from?

1529
01:12:56,451 --> 01:12:58,897
We did business together
for 5-6 years. That's all.

1530
01:12:58,987 --> 01:13:00,762
That's why I am talking
so decently now.

1531
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:02,390
Tell your dad that I said so.

1532
01:13:07,027 --> 01:13:08,802
If you want, get
some 5000 or 10,000.

1533
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:11,169
But don't make it a habit.

1534
01:13:15,235 --> 01:13:17,009
Don't you know that
he's a monster, sir?

1535
01:13:17,236 --> 01:13:19,546
He wakes up in the morning
thinking about whom to cheat next.

1536
01:13:30,214 --> 01:13:32,955
I had asked my dad this morning,
if he had your address.

1537
01:13:34,117 --> 01:13:35,323
I think I have a plan.

1538
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:38,926
Didn't you ask that day whether we
had any common factors between us?

1539
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:40,493
There is.

1540
01:13:41,123 --> 01:13:43,763
What both of us need, is cash.

1541
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:49,439
My food truck business that
was stopped temporarily?

1542
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:51,404
Shall we get it started again?

1543
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,380
If Vijay looks after the food section,
we can roll up this business.

1544
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:57,475
What do you think?

1545
01:14:01,007 --> 01:14:01,917
That won't be right.

1546
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:05,417
That alliance is almost okay.

1547
01:14:06,178 --> 01:14:07,520
Where we went from there...

1548
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:08,823
With them.

1549
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:13,751
Did you like each other?

1550
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,432
It's almost okay for the families.

1551
01:14:17,988 --> 01:14:20,025
But they are not the ones
who have to live together.

1552
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,836
That girl's father also
has some big business.

1553
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,174
Even after knowing our
current financial status,

1554
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,467
they are ready to proceed.

1555
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:32,141
So to support your family, a marriage
eyeing at the money in the girl's family.

1556
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:33,311
Right?

1557
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,379
Very sad.

1558
01:14:38,739 --> 01:14:41,276
You would have understood that things
are not that smooth at my house,

1559
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:42,785
from what you heard
today, right?

1560
01:14:43,276 --> 01:14:44,482
I'm meeting them again tomorrow.

1561
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:45,721
For lunch.

1562
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:47,187
You have a great talent.

1563
01:14:47,414 --> 01:14:48,893
Can't you use that
to make money?

1564
01:14:49,748 --> 01:14:52,194
Instead, it's quite cheap to
get married taking dowry.

1565
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:54,796
Hey!

1566
01:14:55,187 --> 01:14:56,165
Some people...

1567
01:14:56,488 --> 01:14:57,990
Some people work to make a living.

1568
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:00,030
Some people think
work is their life.

1569
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:01,368
There are some others.

1570
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:03,234
People who don't do any work.

1571
01:15:03,827 --> 01:15:05,067
People for whom,
nothing works out.

1572
01:15:06,029 --> 01:15:07,201
I belong to that category.

1573
01:15:08,732 --> 01:15:09,904
Nothing is okay around me.

1574
01:15:16,105 --> 01:15:17,015
Mobile!

1575
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:25,188
This is my number.

1576
01:15:25,379 --> 01:15:27,950
If you have a change of heart about
the food truck, let me know.

1577
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:36,059
Hey! It's because you don't feel okay
inside, that nothing feels okay around you.

1578
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:50,472
Hey Vijay!

1579
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:53,280
You? You work here now?
- Yeah.

1580
01:15:53,704 --> 01:15:54,875
That's nice.
- Are you alone?

1581
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:56,942
No. A small meeting.
- ls it?

1582
01:15:57,174 --> 01:15:58,278
Okay. Carry on.
- I'll be here.

1583
01:16:00,343 --> 01:16:01,252
Hi.

1584
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:03,483
Hi.

1585
01:16:06,082 --> 01:16:07,254
Has it been long since you came?

1586
01:16:08,216 --> 01:16:09,388
Around 10 minutes?

1587
01:16:10,185 --> 01:16:11,095
Sorry.

1588
01:16:23,129 --> 01:16:24,836
Shall I use the washroom and come?

1589
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,209
Sorry!
- Dude!

1590
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:40,981
I am sorry.

1591
01:16:41,445 --> 01:16:43,186
Can't you be a little more careful?

1592
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:44,790
l‘m sorry, Vila)!-

1593
01:16:47,217 --> 01:16:48,127
One minute.

1594
01:16:49,252 --> 01:16:50,162
How do you know my name?

1595
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:52,897
I know it.

1596
01:16:54,289 --> 01:16:55,199
What the hell!

1597
01:16:58,693 --> 01:17:00,695
Download these references.

1598
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:02,804
By then, I'll reach there.

1599
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:04,466
This is not drying.

1600
01:17:38,127 --> 01:17:39,037
sir!

1601
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:40,105
sir!

1602
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:55,314
Sir.. Uncle, you were also here?

1603
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:57,716
There was a distributors'
meeting upstairs.

1604
01:17:57,944 --> 01:17:59,287
That's why I fixed this here.

1605
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,386
Why? Did you think that
she would come alone?

1606
01:18:01,748 --> 01:18:02,919
Yes.
No.. I mean...

1607
01:18:03,181 --> 01:18:05,252
No. Anyway, I could
meet you also, right?

1608
01:18:07,386 --> 01:18:09,366
I think Sonam in
some kind of tension.

1609
01:18:09,955 --> 01:18:11,763
She has been on the phone
ever since I came.

1610
01:18:13,324 --> 01:18:14,962
She has several friends.

1611
01:18:15,259 --> 01:18:18,899
So she is always engaged in
WhatsApp, lnstagram, Facebook...

1612
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,804
All of them are in their
extremes for her.

1613
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:23,240
Who is 100% perfect, Vljay?

1614
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,934
Yes, sir.
Very true.

1615
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:28,305
So I am a little conscious about
fixing a partner for her.

1616
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:35,847
My wish is to have a son in law who
will join my business and support me.

1617
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,819
She had received so many proposals.

1618
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:41,281
From families established in business.

1619
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:43,284
But, I don't want it that way.

1620
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:44,422
I think you got me.

1621
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:48,092
If I say it in a typical
Malayali‘s language,

1622
01:18:48,388 --> 01:18:49,696
Consider that I'm scared...

1623
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:52,793
...whether they would completely
loot whatever I've made so far.

1624
01:18:53,325 --> 01:18:54,235
So tell me.

1625
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:56,873
How can you support
me in my business?

1626
01:18:57,396 --> 01:18:58,306
Or...

1627
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,035
what previous experience do
you have in business, Vijay?

1628
01:19:02,366 --> 01:19:03,936
Sir, business...

1629
01:19:05,036 --> 01:19:07,277
My friend and I are doing
a business together.

1630
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:09,281
Food truck.

1631
01:19:09,672 --> 01:19:12,676
Restaurant on wheels,
with good food & good music?

1632
01:19:13,276 --> 01:19:14,186
What is the USP?

1633
01:19:14,743 --> 01:19:15,949
USP...

1634
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:17,055
USP...

1635
01:19:17,813 --> 01:19:18,723
Dine with music.

1636
01:19:19,014 --> 01:19:21,119
So, good food.
Good music.

1637
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,225
Good idea.
What do you say?

1638
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,023
Please don't involve
me in this, dad.

1639
01:19:28,122 --> 01:19:30,294
So what's the turnover
like every month?

1640
01:19:30,957 --> 01:19:32,732
Not the profit..
- Turnover, sir...

1641
01:19:33,193 --> 01:19:34,103
We are just...

1642
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:35,831
We are just going to
start the business.

1643
01:19:36,895 --> 01:19:38,306
It hasn't started yet?
- No, sir.

1644
01:19:38,798 --> 01:19:40,243
We're like, just about to start.

1645
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:42,170
Everything is getting ready.

1646
01:19:42,368 --> 01:19:43,277
Okay.

1647
01:19:43,702 --> 01:19:44,407
Let it start.

1648
01:19:45,003 --> 01:19:46,676
I'll watch the growth.

1649
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:49,281
And let's plan the
wedding accordingly.

1650
01:19:49,874 --> 01:19:50,783
Okay?
- Yeah.

1651
01:19:50,975 --> 01:19:51,885
Shall we eat now?

1652
01:19:52,242 --> 01:19:53,243
I'm really starving.

1653
01:19:53,677 --> 01:19:54,849
You want to start with the soup?

1654
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:01,128
He can't be blamed.

1655
01:20:01,751 --> 01:20:04,357
Any dad would wish that the
guy who's marrying his daughter,

1656
01:20:04,686 --> 01:20:06,188
should be smart enough.

1657
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:09,029
During the Mahabharata war,

1658
01:20:09,224 --> 01:20:12,067
seeing his own uncle Bheeshma
on the opposite side,

1659
01:20:12,193 --> 01:20:14,230
when Arjun was feeling helpless,

1660
01:20:14,395 --> 01:20:15,772
what did Krishna tell him then?

1661
01:20:17,097 --> 01:20:19,167
You can't be confused in war.

1662
01:20:20,266 --> 01:20:23,907
If you have decided to shoot an arrow,
you have to shoot it that very second.

1663
01:20:24,704 --> 01:20:25,739
What does that mean?

1664
01:20:25,872 --> 01:20:28,283
It's not to chop off
your own uncle's head.

1665
01:20:29,274 --> 01:20:30,878
If you take a decision,

1666
01:20:31,143 --> 01:20:34,680
you should not delay its
execution even by a second.

1667
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,386
Hey! You go and meet
that Pournami anyway.

1668
01:20:40,017 --> 01:20:43,190
And tell her that you
agree to do business with her.

1669
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:52,202
No, Bhaiyya. The salary you're
asking for, is too much.

1670
01:20:52,395 --> 01:20:54,965
No, Madam. We've quoted
a really low amount.

1671
01:20:55,163 --> 01:20:56,801
Please do something
from your side.

1672
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:58,203
Please madam.

1673
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,970
I'll tell you in two days.

1674
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:02,273
Okay Madam.

1675
01:21:08,742 --> 01:21:10,948
Wow!
You've brought great luck.

1676
01:21:11,678 --> 01:21:13,658
I just appointed a chef.

1677
01:21:13,813 --> 01:21:14,883
Appointed?
- Yes.

1678
01:21:15,648 --> 01:21:17,149
Then why did you ask me
to come when I called?

1679
01:21:17,249 --> 01:21:18,159
Just like that.

1680
01:21:19,217 --> 01:21:20,821
Nothing is okay for you...

1681
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:23,123
You're not interested in
anything around you...

1682
01:21:23,821 --> 01:21:27,234
And didn't you say that you're going to
run your father in law's business, right?

1683
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:28,728
And what happened now?

1684
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,231
I called you here to ask that.

1685
01:21:31,328 --> 01:21:33,001
You invited me
here to insult me?

1686
01:21:38,267 --> 01:21:39,177
Hello!

1687
01:21:41,804 --> 01:21:44,080
What you need the most to
do business, is patience.

1688
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,249
Do you know that?

1689
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:51,282
I'll take care of the marketing
to take the business forward.

1690
01:21:51,946 --> 01:21:53,390
The maintenance of the food truck,

1691
01:21:53,714 --> 01:21:54,624
purchase,

1692
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:56,326
cooking related stuff,

1693
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:57,660
can you do all that?

1694
01:22:01,921 --> 01:22:02,831
If so,

1695
01:22:02,988 --> 01:22:05,730
we should start the work
tomorrow morning at sharp 9 AM.

1696
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:09,034
Call those music directors as well.

1697
01:22:09,127 --> 01:22:11,107
You don't have any other
friends to help you, right?

1698
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:33,322
'Isn't Pournami superb, dude?'

1699
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,727
'Isn't she beautiful, dude?'

1700
01:22:37,685 --> 01:22:39,926
'When she freaks out, isn't she happy?'

1701
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:43,799
'Isn't she okay to let you join her?'
- Okay!

1702
01:22:44,324 --> 01:22:50,171
'She's a slice of heaven that fell down like
good times, opening the window of dreams'

1703
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:56,307
'Sitting next to you, she studied your
horoscope and tested your worth in Gold'

1704
01:22:57,769 --> 01:22:59,305
Why are you late?
- We became slightly late.

1705
01:22:59,403 --> 01:23:01,906
Won't you go before 9 PM to stand
in the queue at the liquor store?

1706
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,747
Won't you go before the movie
starts, when you go for a movie?

1707
01:23:04,841 --> 01:23:06,286
Then what's the problem when
you come for work alone?

1708
01:23:06,409 --> 01:23:08,286
That's correct.
- We were late to wake up.

1709
01:23:09,012 --> 01:23:09,922
Be on time.

1710
01:23:10,046 --> 01:23:10,955
Work is worship.

1711
01:23:13,149 --> 01:23:14,287
Workshop?

1712
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:16,397
She didn't say that.
'Work is worship'.

1713
01:23:18,186 --> 01:23:20,792
Start!
- 'Isn't Pournami superb, dude?'

1714
01:23:21,456 --> 01:23:24,198
'Isn't she beautiful, dude?'

1715
01:23:24,826 --> 01:23:27,431
'When she freaks out, isn't she happy?'

1716
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:30,833
'Isn't she okay to let you join her?'

1717
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:37,881
'She's a slice of heaven that fell down like
good times, opening the window of dreams'

1718
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:44,745
'Sitting next to you, she studied your
horoscope and tested your worth in Gold'

1719
01:24:12,433 --> 01:24:14,140
Hey! I had an interview in a radio channel today.
- And?

1720
01:24:14,235 --> 01:24:16,305
I might get it mostly.
- My God! Congrats!

1721
01:24:16,403 --> 01:24:18,713
You should have the heart to do any job.
- I have that.

1722
01:24:18,839 --> 01:24:20,944
You should read at least the
newspaper daily. - I will.

1723
01:24:22,142 --> 01:24:23,745
Do you read the
newspaper and all?

1724
01:24:24,343 --> 01:24:25,686
Who is the President of India?

1725
01:24:26,345 --> 01:24:27,255
Mahatma Gandhi.

1726
01:24:27,346 --> 01:24:28,723
That's the Father of the Nation.

1727
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:30,257
Have you heard of Ramnath Kovind?

1728
01:24:31,015 --> 01:24:31,925
No.

1729
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:32,993
Read! Read!

1730
01:24:33,351 --> 01:24:36,355
'So many desires are
coming here, flying'

1731
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:39,725
'They are celebrating
with song and dance'

1732
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:43,031
'The feathers of dreams
are dancing in abandon'

1733
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,299
'They are flying high,
in the midst of these celebrations'

1734
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:49,769
'Some things are working out'

1735
01:24:49,899 --> 01:24:52,378
'All the curses are going away'

1736
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:56,375
'Leaning on the doorstep'

1737
01:24:56,705 --> 01:24:59,810
'The spring season is singing'

1738
01:24:59,941 --> 01:25:05,754
'She came like a breeze,
stroked you and sharpened you'

1739
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:12,960
'She did all the tinkering and
polishing work, and made you superb'

1740
01:25:23,194 --> 01:25:25,800
Hey! Move!
- Move and watch this.

1741
01:25:43,678 --> 01:25:45,282
I had already given it
to a catering company.

1742
01:25:45,614 --> 01:25:48,254
But she was adamant that we
should give the first job,

1743
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,158
when her best friend is
starting a business.

1744
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,160
That's why...

1745
01:25:52,352 --> 01:25:55,333
Actually, we didn't
have catering plans.

1746
01:25:55,855 --> 01:25:58,859
Yes. So along with the first business,
we've given you a new plan as well.

1747
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:01,099
So that's all. I trust you.

1748
01:26:01,227 --> 01:26:02,137
Thanks.

1749
01:26:02,728 --> 01:26:04,707
Impress everyone with delicious food.

1750
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,637
Sure, uncle. We will.
- Okay.

1751
01:26:08,967 --> 01:26:11,344
Uncle, please drop me to the library.
- Why not?

1752
01:26:11,836 --> 01:26:14,112
Hey!
- Uncle, this is Vijay. Pinky's partner.

1753
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:16,251
This is my uncle.
- Hi gentleman! See you tomorrow.

1754
01:26:17,008 --> 01:26:18,145
To mo rrow?
- Okay?

1755
01:26:18,975 --> 01:26:19,885
See you tomorrow!

1756
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:21,086
To mo rrow?

1757
01:26:22,712 --> 01:26:23,417
Who's that gentleman?

1758
01:26:24,414 --> 01:26:26,916
We got our first order even
before our official launch.

1759
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:28,293
It's a catering job.

1760
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:29,923
Consider it a trial.

1761
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:31,222
Let it be an experience.

1762
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,992
Catering is not part
of our plan, right?

1763
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,133
Who knows what's
going to succeed?

1764
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:36,866
It came to us, right?

1765
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,129
He's a big event manager.

1766
01:26:38,825 --> 01:26:41,135
But the food should reach
there at 11 AM tomorrow.

1767
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:43,341
But if it's tomorrow,
what about the menu?

1768
01:26:43,763 --> 01:26:44,673
There's no menu.

1769
01:26:44,831 --> 01:26:46,332
There's a main catering
company for that.

1770
01:26:46,732 --> 01:26:48,302
We've got the order
only for the starters.

1771
01:26:48,601 --> 01:26:49,636
So don't take a risk.

1772
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:52,340
Just order it from some good
hotel and take it there.

1773
01:26:52,838 --> 01:26:53,747
I will be there.

1774
01:26:54,806 --> 01:26:56,342
Don't forget to fill diesel in the van.

1775
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,281
Everything should be perfect.

1776
01:26:58,676 --> 01:27:00,279
Still.. Why should we order from a hotel?

1777
01:27:00,778 --> 01:27:01,688
I can cook it!

1778
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:03,255
Just starters, right?
- Vijay!

1779
01:27:03,914 --> 01:27:05,655
There's not even 24 hours
left for the event.

1780
01:27:05,816 --> 01:27:07,124
Why do we need
unnecessary tension?

1781
01:27:07,617 --> 01:27:09,858
Let's study how to serve it
elegantly first. - Okay.

1782
01:27:15,157 --> 01:27:16,067
Stand up.

1783
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:18,069
Stand up!

1784
01:27:21,663 --> 01:27:22,367
Seventy Five Thousand.

1785
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:26,072
Will there be a margin?

1786
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:28,637
Around 20,000?

1787
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:31,640
Let's start with starters!

1788
01:27:33,173 --> 01:27:34,083
That's a good one.

1789
01:27:34,808 --> 01:27:36,650
So let me go and start the planning.

1790
01:27:36,975 --> 01:27:37,885
See you!

1791
01:27:42,281 --> 01:27:44,760
This is the first ball of the innings.

1792
01:27:44,882 --> 01:27:48,261
On the crease, is India's very own,
Roshan!

1793
01:27:48,886 --> 01:27:49,956
Hit it, dude!

1794
01:27:51,355 --> 01:27:54,700
Out! Out!

1795
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:57,134
I'm not out!

1796
01:27:57,294 --> 01:27:58,772
It was a trial ball.

1797
01:27:58,861 --> 01:28:00,602
It was a trial ball. Leave me.

1798
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,334
If it was a trial ball, why did
you hit it with so much force?

1799
01:28:02,665 --> 01:28:04,338
That's because I didn't touch the ball.
If I had, it would have gone there.

1800
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:06,077
Have you seen Dhoni
playing trial balls?

1801
01:28:06,201 --> 01:28:07,236
Or Kohli?

1802
01:28:07,902 --> 01:28:09,882
We don't play around daily
like Dhoni and Kohli.

1803
01:28:10,004 --> 01:28:12,176
We are music directors.
We make music!

1804
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,276
Go and bowl!
- Idiot!

1805
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:15,785
Th row!
- Th row!

1806
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:17,651
Let all three stumps fly!
- Throw the ball.

1807
01:28:18,913 --> 01:28:20,289
Here you go!
First ball again.

1808
01:28:20,613 --> 01:28:21,819
Th row fast.

1809
01:28:21,915 --> 01:28:22,825
Look!

1810
01:28:23,349 --> 01:28:24,851
The first advance.
- Good.

1811
01:28:24,984 --> 01:28:25,894
I need a help.
Come.

1812
01:28:26,085 --> 01:28:27,893
No helping.
Let me play.

1813
01:28:28,687 --> 01:28:31,293
So you're not having the beers I bought?

1814
01:28:31,623 --> 01:28:32,693
Get lost, Vijay!

1815
01:28:36,627 --> 01:28:38,766
Oh! It's all about temptation!

1816
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:41,133
Bloody fool!

1817
01:28:41,264 --> 01:28:42,174
Can you believe this?

1818
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:44,835
Can you believe this?
- You will come back here, right?

1819
01:28:44,935 --> 01:28:46,312
Give our ball and go!

1820
01:28:47,671 --> 01:28:48,648
Pinky!

1821
01:28:49,104 --> 01:28:50,583
Come fast.
- What happened?

1822
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:51,616
Come fast.

1823
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:55,052
What?
Chechi is not listening to me.

1824
01:28:58,045 --> 01:28:59,115
Chechi, what are you doing?

1825
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,190
Shut up and go!

1826
01:29:00,615 --> 01:29:01,320
Mom will wake up.

1827
01:29:01,616 --> 01:29:02,753
Chechi, this is not right.

1828
01:29:02,883 --> 01:29:05,887
I can pay the EMI for
two months with this.

1829
01:29:06,153 --> 01:29:07,723
Chechi, she's an old woman.

1830
01:29:07,854 --> 01:29:10,697
Yes. That's it.
Why does an old woman need gold?

1831
01:29:13,159 --> 01:29:14,763
I'm in dire need of money.

1832
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:16,168
Chechi, please.
Don't take it.

1833
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:18,636
You don't interfere
in the things here.

1834
01:29:19,864 --> 01:29:20,865
Chechi..
- Leave me.

1835
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,906
Why does a person on deathbed,
need chains and bangles?

1836
01:29:33,943 --> 01:29:36,253
After everyone becomes happy
after having the food,

1837
01:29:36,379 --> 01:29:38,119
all of them would come
and appreciate Pinky.

1838
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:40,091
Then they will say...

1839
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:43,894
Pinky, the starters were so amazing.
So extraordinary!

1840
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:45,190
Then you will say...

1841
01:29:45,286 --> 01:29:48,290
Shall I tell you a truth?
I didn't order this from anywhere.

1842
01:29:48,623 --> 01:29:51,331
I cooked it myself taking
a lot of effort, right?

1843
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:52,636
Then she would say...

1844
01:29:52,792 --> 01:29:57,673
Oh my God, Vijay! You are so sweet, and
so beautiful, and an amazing chef!

1845
01:29:57,864 --> 01:29:59,036
Right?
- Correct.

1846
01:29:59,665 --> 01:30:00,575
Hey!

1847
01:30:00,733 --> 01:30:03,043
Until I make this whole
thing and pack it,

1848
01:30:03,135 --> 01:30:05,081
don't tell me that you want to sleep.
Understood?

1849
01:30:05,237 --> 01:30:06,238
Come on! Take this.

1850
01:30:06,904 --> 01:30:08,178
No! - Have it.
- I don't want it.

1851
01:30:08,573 --> 01:30:10,575
Drink it. - No, dude. - Have a little.
Only then you'll get a kick to make all this.

1852
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,779
Shall I tell you a truth then?

1853
01:30:12,944 --> 01:30:15,048
I've stopped boozing
for the time being.

1854
01:30:15,145 --> 01:30:17,091
Sheesh!

1855
01:30:17,214 --> 01:30:18,750
Sheesh!
- What is this?

1856
01:30:19,716 --> 01:30:22,059
Dude, until things
get settled at home,

1857
01:30:22,618 --> 01:30:25,098
if I don't become serious,
I might end up in a lot of trouble.

1858
01:30:26,322 --> 01:30:27,767
This is her.

1859
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:29,100
It's Pinky.

1860
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:31,101
Give it.

1861
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,269
Yes, Pinky.

1862
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:35,707
I've sent the location map
for tomorrow on WhatsApp.

1863
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:36,905
I got it.

1864
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:37,974
I know that place.

1865
01:30:38,098 --> 01:30:39,736
Which hotel have you
given the order to?

1866
01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:41,744
Hotel...

1867
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:42,978
Hotel Casilo.

1868
01:30:43,269 --> 01:30:45,545
Oops! Isn't that quite expensive?

1869
01:30:45,805 --> 01:30:46,749
That's okay.
I can manage.

1870
01:30:46,939 --> 01:30:48,213
Then it's okay.
Fine.

1871
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,577
See you tomorrow then.

1872
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:52,555
Go to sleep fast.
And yeah...

1873
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:54,854
pray before leaving in the morning.

1874
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,090
It's our first venture.

1875
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:57,591
All right!

1876
01:30:57,949 --> 01:30:58,859
Okay. Bye.

1877
01:30:59,083 --> 01:31:00,562
Good night.
- Good night.

1878
01:31:03,888 --> 01:31:06,891
(chanting prayers to Lord Vishnu/Krishna)

1879
01:31:16,565 --> 01:31:17,976
Oh Lord Krishna!

1880
01:31:39,818 --> 01:31:42,628
Yes, Pinky. - I've been trying
for quite some time now.

1881
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:44,266
It kept saying not reachable.

1882
01:31:46,892 --> 01:31:48,598
Not reachable?
- Yes.

1883
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:50,634
You could have called
me when you woke up.

1884
01:31:50,794 --> 01:31:53,035
Since I was busy with
getting everything ready,

1885
01:31:53,163 --> 01:31:55,108
It's okay. Everything is ready, right?
Where have you reached?

1886
01:31:55,632 --> 01:31:56,542
I have just left.

1887
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:58,178
No. I am leaving.

1888
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:00,175
Didn't you leave yet?

1889
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:03,641
There's one more hour, right?
I'll reach soon.

1890
01:32:03,772 --> 01:32:05,115
Look, there will be a lot of traffic.

1891
01:32:05,908 --> 01:32:08,911
If you don't start now, we might not
able to take it there at the right time.

1892
01:32:09,043 --> 01:32:10,283
Don't be tensed!

1893
01:32:10,611 --> 01:32:11,715
As soon as I leave from here,
I'll reach there.

1894
01:32:11,812 --> 01:32:12,916
We're serving starters.

1895
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,787
We can't be late even by five minutes.

1896
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:16,291
No! No! We won't be late.

1897
01:32:16,649 --> 01:32:17,559
I know.

1898
01:32:19,286 --> 01:32:20,629
Dude, get up.

1899
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,830
Help me out, man!

1900
01:32:22,155 --> 01:32:24,191
Dude, there are only 2O boxes.
Help me with them.

1901
01:32:38,101 --> 01:32:40,047
Hi Pinky. Good morning.
- Hello. Good morning.

1902
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:41,740
Everything is ready, right?
- All set.

1903
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:44,646
Once the baptism starts inside,
then it would take only 15 minutes.

1904
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:46,343
We should serve starters
at sharp 11 AM.

1905
01:32:46,642 --> 01:32:47,882
Uncle, trust me.

1906
01:32:48,044 --> 01:32:49,284
Everything will be perfect.

1907
01:32:49,578 --> 01:32:50,283
And Pinky,

1908
01:32:50,613 --> 01:32:51,852
if you do this event well,

1909
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,987
I'll be giving 4-5 more events to you.

1910
01:32:54,349 --> 01:32:56,295
Thank you so much.
- Hari, just one second.

1911
01:32:56,951 --> 01:32:57,861
Be here.
- Okay.

1912
01:33:16,702 --> 01:33:17,612
Oh God!

1913
01:33:23,207 --> 01:33:25,187
Hey, Pinky! Where?
Have the starters reached?

1914
01:33:25,643 --> 01:33:26,348
It's very close by.

1915
01:33:26,844 --> 01:33:27,787
Don't worry.
- Okay.

1916
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:36,629
Pinky!
- Vijay!

1917
01:33:36,685 --> 01:33:37,823
Don't make me tensed like this.

1918
01:33:37,953 --> 01:33:39,557
Where have you reached?
How much time will you take exactly?

1919
01:33:39,688 --> 01:33:41,292
Pinky, I'll reach there in 15 minutes.

1920
01:33:41,622 --> 01:33:42,566
Oh my God!

1921
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:43,794
Which route have you taken?

1922
01:33:43,925 --> 01:33:44,835
Pinky, I...

1923
01:33:45,026 --> 01:33:45,936
lam driving.

1924
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,767
There's a lot of traffic.
I'll call you back.

1925
01:33:47,895 --> 01:33:49,168
Vijay, why are you always late?

1926
01:33:49,563 --> 01:33:50,871
Okay! Okay!
I'll see you there.

1927
01:34:10,714 --> 01:34:11,624
Chet-ta, please hold him.

1928
01:34:11,982 --> 01:34:13,120
There's a vehicle.
Stop!

1929
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,160
Stop!
Come on!

1930
01:34:14,284 --> 01:34:15,592
Just a minute.

1931
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:16,955
Chet-ta, the child...

1932
01:34:17,587 --> 01:34:18,361
Please move.

1933
01:34:18,688 --> 01:34:19,723
Open the door.

1934
01:34:19,856 --> 01:34:21,893
Please move.

1935
01:34:22,759 --> 01:34:25,136
Sir, a car hit him and
went without stopping.

1936
01:34:25,227 --> 01:34:27,036
Let's take him to the hospital quickly.

1937
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:28,699
He's not talking.
Please, make it fast.

1938
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:30,141
Go! Go!

1939
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:35,238
What the hell are you doing, man?
- They got stuck in the block.

1940
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:36,780
ls this how you do a programme?

1941
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:38,247
Everything will be
here in 5 minutes.

1942
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:40,017
Why are you so irresponsible?

1943
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:41,244
ls there any hospital nearby?

1944
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:43,247
Just 2 kilometres from here.
It's close by.

1945
01:34:45,145 --> 01:34:47,215
It's been a while since you've
been saying that he'll reach now,

1946
01:34:47,546 --> 01:34:48,957
5 minutes, he is right here and all that!

1947
01:34:49,081 --> 01:34:50,253
You're going to repeat that again, right?

1948
01:34:50,582 --> 01:34:52,152
No, no! This area.
Very close. Just 5 minutes.

1949
01:34:52,284 --> 01:34:53,318
I deserve this.

1950
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:54,561
I deserve it!

1951
01:34:55,019 --> 01:34:56,089
I'll never trust you, Pinky.

1952
01:35:01,758 --> 01:35:03,237
Chet-ta, please drive fast.

1953
01:35:05,128 --> 01:35:06,971
Chet-ta, I needn't get down, right?
- You should.

1954
01:35:07,097 --> 01:35:08,734
We don't have any cash.

1955
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,770
Take him fast.
- Where is the casualty?

1956
01:35:16,638 --> 01:35:18,777
Hello!
- Hey! You spoilt everything!

1957
01:35:18,973 --> 01:35:20,111
Hello Madam!
- Huh?

1958
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:22,948
Madam, I got this
mobile from the floor.

1959
01:35:26,614 --> 01:35:27,888
It's a hospital.
- Where is Vijay?

1960
01:35:28,015 --> 01:35:30,153
When you took that boy inside,
this phone fell down.

1961
01:35:30,283 --> 01:35:31,626
Someone wants to speak to you.

1962
01:35:31,784 --> 01:35:32,694
Hello!
- Move the vehicle.

1963
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,731
If you don't reach here within
a minute, we'll lose this event.

1964
01:35:35,955 --> 01:35:37,729
Pinky, listen to me.

1965
01:35:37,856 --> 01:35:40,063
You don't have to
say anything more.

1966
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,638
Can't you hear that car honking?
- Just listen to me.

1967
01:35:42,728 --> 01:35:44,570
Why are you always late like this?
- Excuse me.

1968
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:46,234
Uncle..

1969
01:35:47,064 --> 01:35:48,771
You needn't stay here anymore.
You may leave.

1970
01:35:49,133 --> 01:35:50,578
I heard quite a mouthful from them.

1971
01:35:50,734 --> 01:35:51,644
Uncle, I beg of you.

1972
01:35:51,868 --> 01:35:53,279
I don't want to put you in a problem.

1973
01:35:53,703 --> 01:35:54,807
Aren't you ashamed?

1974
01:35:55,538 --> 01:35:56,812
I thought you had some integrity.

1975
01:35:57,073 --> 01:35:58,847
Don't stay here anymore.
Didn't I tell you?

1976
01:35:58,974 --> 01:35:59,884
I'll manage.

1977
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:02,180
Now, this is my ego.

1978
01:36:02,845 --> 01:36:03,755
You can go.

1979
01:36:03,913 --> 01:36:05,914
I won't give business to
anyone I know hereafter.

1980
01:36:06,881 --> 01:36:07,791
Bullshit.

1981
01:36:26,598 --> 01:36:27,303
Hey Pinky!
I'm sorry.

1982
01:36:27,632 --> 01:36:28,975
I'll get everything
ready in 5 minutes.

1983
01:36:31,336 --> 01:36:32,246
Start the vehicle.

1984
01:36:32,671 --> 01:36:33,581
Wait! Wait!

1985
01:36:35,673 --> 01:36:36,583
What?

1986
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,048
Can you come and start the vehicle?

1987
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:41,117
What?
- Let's leave from here.

1988
01:36:41,778 --> 01:36:42,688
Start the vehicle.

1989
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,523
So shouldn't we take these out?
- No. - Why?

1990
01:36:45,648 --> 01:36:46,956
I'll set everything
up in 5 minutes.

1991
01:36:47,684 --> 01:36:48,991
Please. Start the vehicle.

1992
01:36:53,255 --> 01:36:54,962
Pinky...
- Please!

1993
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:58,636
l..
- Why are you irritating me?

1994
01:36:59,126 --> 01:37:00,571
After spoiling everything...

1995
01:37:09,635 --> 01:37:11,911
If the one who's hearing makes
up her mind that it's a lie,

1996
01:37:12,271 --> 01:37:14,182
one can't convince even
if it's a big truth.

1997
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,047
The mistake is mine!

1998
01:37:19,644 --> 01:37:20,884
The mistake is indeed yours.

1999
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:22,558
No one is saying otherwise.

2000
01:37:33,589 --> 01:37:34,294
What?

2001
01:37:36,258 --> 01:37:37,498
You didn't fill diesel, right?

2002
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:43,774
So you decided to spoil everything.

2003
01:37:44,999 --> 01:37:48,138
Even after failing in 2 businesses,
I ventured into a 3rd one,

2004
01:37:48,769 --> 01:37:50,271
to answer the questions
of many people.

2005
01:37:51,772 --> 01:37:54,843
To show them that life is not about
hiding in fear, when faced with failure.

2006
01:37:57,544 --> 01:37:58,249
Pinky...

2007
01:37:58,678 --> 01:37:59,951
What's the point
sitting in that now?

2008
01:38:03,015 --> 01:38:03,925
Pinky!

2009
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:07,661
Pinky...

2010
01:38:08,586 --> 01:38:10,998
Even if you keep shouting
'Vijay Super' at the top of your voice,

2011
01:38:11,088 --> 01:38:12,066
you won't be super.

2012
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,534
To become super,

2013
01:38:13,957 --> 01:38:15,937
you need a big D within you.
Discipline.

2014
01:38:16,626 --> 01:38:18,264
Pinky, I got stuck on the way here.

2015
01:38:18,628 --> 01:38:20,835
Should I not stop after seeing an
accident? You should have left early.

2016
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:23,102
What would have gone wrong if you
had started half an hour early?

2017
01:38:23,999 --> 01:38:26,843
Now you would say that the hotel was
late in giving the starters, right?

2018
01:38:28,237 --> 01:38:29,146
Okay.

2019
01:38:29,537 --> 01:38:30,242
Where's the bill?

2020
01:38:32,607 --> 01:38:34,814
Where's the bill from the hotel
where you bought this?

2021
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:40,050
If we return the stuff in the vehicle,
I can at least get 25% of the cash back.

2022
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,684
With that, I can settle
uncle's account today itself.

2023
01:38:42,882 --> 01:38:43,826
Give me the bill.

2024
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,255
Where is the bill?

2025
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,724
These are not from a hotel.

2026
01:38:49,688 --> 01:38:50,597
Then?

2027
01:38:51,122 --> 01:38:52,032
Pinky...

2028
01:38:52,557 --> 01:38:54,559
I made all this last night,
without sleeping.

2029
01:39:00,798 --> 01:39:03,005
Have you given any
value to what I said?

2030
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,109
It's not that, Pinky...

2031
01:39:08,838 --> 01:39:11,579
If there's any money left, fill
diesel and bring the vehicle there.

2032
01:39:11,907 --> 01:39:12,942
That's the last job for you.

2033
01:39:13,909 --> 01:39:17,220
'Going away like a day'

2034
01:39:17,846 --> 01:39:21,054
'Disappearing like a night'

2035
01:39:23,151 --> 01:39:24,824
Pinky, I'll book a cab.

2036
01:39:30,023 --> 01:39:31,696
Hey! Give me the phone.
- Venu Etta..

2037
01:39:31,825 --> 01:39:33,098
Look who's here.

2038
01:39:33,993 --> 01:39:35,563
Hey Govindan!

2039
01:39:35,728 --> 01:39:37,071
How come you're here
all of a sudden?

2040
01:39:37,863 --> 01:39:41,605
It was her cousin's daughter's
engagement at Thripunithura yesterday.

2041
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:42,609
We came for that.

2042
01:39:42,867 --> 01:39:43,777
Please sit.

2043
01:39:46,571 --> 01:39:48,072
I forgot your name..
- This is Vishal.

2044
01:39:49,106 --> 01:39:52,178
He is working in in an
lndo-American company in Delhi.

2045
01:39:52,809 --> 01:39:57,188
And now he has got a very good job offer
from a similar company in Australia.

2046
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:01,218
Both of us are determined that we
should find a nice girl for him,

2047
01:40:01,549 --> 01:40:04,860
and get them married,
before sending him away.

2048
01:40:04,986 --> 01:40:07,592
Well, where's the daughter
of this house? Pournami?

2049
01:40:07,689 --> 01:40:08,894
She is upstairs.
I'll call her now.

2050
01:40:09,023 --> 01:40:09,933
Pinky, dear...

2051
01:40:16,796 --> 01:40:17,706
Who is it?

2052
01:40:18,164 --> 01:40:19,142
It's daddy.

2053
01:40:21,067 --> 01:40:22,808
Hello dear.
Where are you?

2054
01:40:22,968 --> 01:40:24,845
I had sent you a message, right?

2055
01:40:25,203 --> 01:40:27,547
I came to the parlour with Shreya.

2056
01:40:27,806 --> 01:40:29,752
Okay, okay.
Come fast.

2057
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:31,849
I don't feel too well.
- What happened?

2058
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:33,922
Come soon. - Just half an hour.
I'll be right there.

2059
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:35,682
Okay?
- You're leaving now?

2060
01:40:35,813 --> 01:40:37,190
Yes. Daddy is not feeling well.

2061
01:40:37,947 --> 01:40:38,857
Okay.

2062
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:41,155
I'll text you?

2063
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:42,862
Bye .

2064
01:40:52,961 --> 01:40:55,134
Hey! Did you think
I won't know anything? - Please!

2065
01:40:55,496 --> 01:40:56,634
Don't create a scene here.

2066
01:40:56,764 --> 01:40:58,710
Who are you trying to fool?
- Consider it a blunder.

2067
01:40:58,832 --> 01:40:59,970
Blunder? ls this a blunder?
- Listen to me.

2068
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:01,545
We'll convince her.

2069
01:41:02,136 --> 01:41:03,046
Shucks.

2070
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:10,645
Okay then.
- Bye Radha.

2071
01:41:10,743 --> 01:41:12,689
We'll come again next week.
- Okay.

2072
01:41:12,945 --> 01:41:13,854
My grandmother.

2073
01:41:14,646 --> 01:41:16,091
Venugopalan?
- Menon.

2074
01:41:16,815 --> 01:41:17,725
Shucks!

2075
01:41:22,186 --> 01:41:23,529
Pinky!
<i>‘</i> Yes!

2076
01:41:23,987 --> 01:41:24,897
Please sit.

2077
01:41:25,623 --> 01:41:26,727
Dear...

2078
01:41:27,057 --> 01:41:28,967
Ever since his grandfather died,

2079
01:41:29,192 --> 01:41:32,139
I don't usually go to any
houses or functions.

2080
01:41:33,229 --> 01:41:35,606
But when I saw him being
all sad and gloomy,

2081
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:36,833
I felt that,

2082
01:41:37,566 --> 01:41:39,739
I should come along
with him and see her.

2083
01:41:40,836 --> 01:41:41,745
Hey!

2084
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:43,147
Give it to her.

2085
01:41:45,873 --> 01:41:46,783
Here.

2086
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:48,079
I've filled up the diesel tank.

2087
01:41:49,142 --> 01:41:50,052
Here's the money.

2088
01:41:51,578 --> 01:41:52,750
If I send him alone,

2089
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:56,482
he'll just give that money and key,
and leave without saying anything.

2090
01:41:56,816 --> 01:42:00,457
And he doesn't have the smartness
to win an argument with anyone.

2091
01:42:03,955 --> 01:42:07,232
I understood that it was a match-making
party who just left from here.

2092
01:42:08,025 --> 01:42:08,935
He told me...

2093
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:12,633
that she's not at all interested
in getting married now.

2094
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:17,905
As far as I've heard,

2095
01:42:18,134 --> 01:42:20,978
she has quite a lot of dreams.

2096
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:24,674
At least sensible people like you
should be able to understand that,

2097
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:27,150
she would tell you when
it's time to get married.

2098
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:36,190
It's not in getting them married
like finishing off a duty,

2099
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,086
but in understanding what's
in their mind very well,

2100
01:42:39,218 --> 01:42:42,165
and giving their hand to someone,
that you should see greatness.

2101
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:43,229
So...

2102
01:42:43,556 --> 01:42:47,526
there's this ritual called divorce that
happens soon after marriage, right?

2103
01:42:47,759 --> 01:42:49,636
That will not happen at all.

2104
01:42:51,163 --> 01:42:52,642
And one thing to you, dear...

2105
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:57,577
He also did what anyone with a
little compassion would do.

2106
01:42:59,137 --> 01:43:01,275
If you startjudging each other,

2107
01:43:01,605 --> 01:43:03,778
you would lose this affection
between yourselves.

2108
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:04,950
It's like that.

2109
01:43:07,144 --> 01:43:08,645
Shall we leave?
- Yes.

2110
01:43:08,945 --> 01:43:09,855
I'll get you tea.

2111
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,557
There's still time for all that.

2112
01:43:14,249 --> 01:43:16,250
You will always
be blessed, dear.

2113
01:43:27,928 --> 01:43:29,600
Bye then.
- Bye.

2114
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:36,010
'The dark blue clouds
are ready to shower'

2115
01:43:36,635 --> 01:43:39,775
'To swing on the branches
of the flowering tree'

2116
01:43:39,904 --> 01:43:44,079
'To know without words'

2117
01:43:44,608 --> 01:43:48,215
‘Someone‘

2118
01:43:48,612 --> 01:43:56,120
‘Someone‘

2119
01:43:56,486 --> 01:44:00,194
So today we learned how to
make chicken drumstick.

2120
01:44:00,689 --> 01:44:04,637
'Wobbling on the edge
of little red seeds'

2121
01:44:04,726 --> 01:44:07,831
'A breeze is caressing
my heart today'

2122
01:44:07,962 --> 01:44:11,068
'It turned into a flower'

2123
01:44:11,499 --> 01:44:12,670
Didn't you fill petrol in this?

2124
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,644
I did, for 50 Rupees.

2125
01:44:15,068 --> 01:44:15,978
Who is it?

2126
01:44:16,202 --> 01:44:17,146
It's from home.

2127
01:44:18,671 --> 01:44:20,513
Enough, dear.
Now you also take a seat & eat.

2128
01:44:21,941 --> 01:44:22,851
Did you like it, mom?

2129
01:44:23,943 --> 01:44:25,081
It's amazing, dear.

2130
01:44:25,211 --> 01:44:26,121
very tasty.

2131
01:44:26,778 --> 01:44:28,086
What's that continental smell?

2132
01:44:28,279 --> 01:44:29,223
WOW!

2133
01:44:29,581 --> 01:44:30,821
What timing, aunty!

2134
01:44:31,582 --> 01:44:32,287
Grandma!

2135
01:44:32,617 --> 01:44:33,959
Did you smell the food from afar?

2136
01:44:34,117 --> 01:44:35,562
Where are you even coming from?

2137
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:36,694
Easy, grandma!

2138
01:44:37,654 --> 01:44:38,962
Why didn't you pick up my call?

2139
01:44:39,589 --> 01:44:40,499
I was coming here.

2140
01:44:41,624 --> 01:44:43,900
Hey!
She made it herself and brought it.

2141
01:44:44,026 --> 01:44:46,063
It's really tasty. You sit there.

2142
01:44:46,195 --> 01:44:47,105
I don't want it.

2143
01:44:47,229 --> 01:44:48,138
Sit there, I say.

2144
01:44:48,496 --> 01:44:49,236
Sit and eat.

2145
01:44:51,232 --> 01:44:52,711
Uncle, you didn't say anything.

2146
01:44:52,834 --> 01:44:53,744
Here, mom.
- Dear...

2147
01:44:54,102 --> 01:44:56,707
it's been really long since
I had such tasty food.

2148
01:44:57,471 --> 01:44:59,508
Did you make this by seeing
it in some cookery show?

2149
01:44:59,773 --> 01:45:00,945
It's from a cookery show"

2150
01:45:03,142 --> 01:45:07,750
I made it looking at a chef's video
which has only 1500 views on YouTube.

2151
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:11,151
Failed chef, right?

2152
01:45:12,017 --> 01:45:13,826
Mom!
- Failed for the time being.

2153
01:45:13,919 --> 01:45:16,058
But in a few months, things would
change drastically.

2154
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:21,802
Uncle...

2155
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,802
The business that Vijay
and I are doing together,

2156
01:45:25,562 --> 01:45:28,566
I am thinking about restarting
it soon, on a good date.

2157
01:45:29,599 --> 01:45:30,873
We need your blessings, uncle.

2158
01:45:31,901 --> 01:45:33,710
You will always have my blessings.

2159
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:35,513
But that alone is not enough.

2160
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:38,909
The excitement, dedication and
determination that you're showing now,

2161
01:45:39,007 --> 01:45:40,486
should always be there.

2162
01:45:40,575 --> 01:45:41,485
G01: it?

2163
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:43,520
Eat, all of you.

2164
01:45:47,715 --> 01:45:48,625
Hey!

2165
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:52,228
If you pay money, you can get other
chefs from Bombay or Bengal.

2166
01:45:52,819 --> 01:45:55,459
They are better to fire and
call back at your convenience.

2167
01:45:55,721 --> 01:45:56,631
Leave me alone.

2168
01:45:57,456 --> 01:45:58,491
Food truck is our baby.

2169
01:45:59,625 --> 01:46:01,501
I cannot leave it just like that.

2170
01:46:02,694 --> 01:46:04,230
And you are my last ray of hope.

2171
01:46:08,499 --> 01:46:09,204
It's my mistake.

2172
01:46:09,867 --> 01:46:10,811
I am sorry.

2173
01:46:11,468 --> 01:46:19,467
'What's so special today,
that this silence has faded away?'

2174
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:28,808
'What's so special today,
that this cloud is raining incessantly?'

2175
01:46:29,684 --> 01:46:34,190
'At the shore of this night,
where we become one'

2176
01:46:34,522 --> 01:46:39,129
'Golden stars are arriving, to stay'

2177
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:47,658
'Someone is singing a beautiful song...
The sky is resting on my chest'

2178
01:46:49,001 --> 01:46:57,000
'Whose heart is the full moon
searching for, hiding from everyone?'

2179
01:46:58,442 --> 01:47:06,441
'What's so special today,
that this silence has faded away?'

2180
01:47:07,684 --> 01:47:15,683
'What's so special today,
that this cloud is raining incessantly?'

2181
01:47:17,859 --> 01:47:22,170
'The sun rays are departing'
(Song from 'Niranf - 1999)

2182
01:47:22,763 --> 01:47:26,869
'The blue sky has become lonely'

2183
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:35,199
'Someone sang in pain,
searching for some intense love'

2184
01:47:53,857 --> 01:47:58,532
'Oh my love, oh my love'
(Song from 'Duet' - 1994)

2185
01:47:58,761 --> 01:48:03,175
'What are you going to do to me?'

2186
01:48:03,465 --> 01:48:07,914
'Despite knowing that I an": an artist'

2187
01:48:08,102 --> 01:48:12,743
'Why do you ask for my eyes?'

2188
01:48:13,473 --> 01:48:19,684
'O bird with a feather on the forehead,
and golden wings'

2189
01:48:19,945 --> 01:48:24,586
'Why don't you sing?'

2190
01:48:32,723 --> 01:48:40,722
'Who is it, spreading light, at the
shore of pain, when the flames go out?'

2191
01:48:41,798 --> 01:48:49,797
'Who is it, as an inseparable companion,
during the rains and the cold breeze?'

2192
01:48:51,573 --> 01:48:56,112
'Let's search for the
bygone melodies, together'

2193
01:48:56,410 --> 01:49:00,789
'Let's make a thousand poems to sing'

2194
01:49:00,914 --> 01:49:05,090
'The illusion of silence
has disappeared somewhere'

2195
01:49:05,652 --> 01:49:13,650
'Someone is singing a beautiful song...
The sky is resting on my chest'

2196
01:49:15,059 --> 01:49:23,058
'Whose heart is the full moon
searching for, hiding from everyone?'

2197
01:49:24,568 --> 01:49:32,567
'Someone is singing a beautiful song...
The sky is resting on my chest'

2198
01:49:33,743 --> 01:49:36,746
'Whose heart is the full moon
searching for, hiding from everyone?'

2199
01:49:36,978 --> 01:49:38,389
Hey! Vijay! Vijay!

2200
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,059
Look! Look at this!

2201
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:41,957
Chitra Chechi (singer) has messaged us.
- Who?

2202
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:43,686
WOW!

2203
01:49:44,485 --> 01:49:46,158
Manu, look around! An E Class.
- Whose is it?

2204
01:49:46,587 --> 01:49:47,930
Whose car is it?
- Who knows?

2205
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:52,028
All of you are here, huh?

2206
01:49:52,926 --> 01:49:54,564
Your business is rocking, right?

2207
01:49:54,694 --> 01:49:55,638
Am I right?

2208
01:49:58,630 --> 01:49:59,574
Pournami?

2209
01:49:59,732 --> 01:50:00,642
That's your name, right?

2210
01:50:01,667 --> 01:50:02,975
I saw you both on the news.

2211
01:50:03,102 --> 01:50:04,739
Very happy.
- Thank you.

2212
01:50:05,002 --> 01:50:06,811
I didn't know that I would
see you today, dear.

2213
01:50:07,005 --> 01:50:08,109
Everyone is here now, right?

2214
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,448
All of them know that I
am a very frank person.

2215
01:50:11,742 --> 01:50:13,153
Still, let me ask since I saw you...

2216
01:50:14,044 --> 01:50:15,751
No formalities, sir.
Please ask.

2217
01:50:16,413 --> 01:50:18,858
Can you give us your share?

2218
01:50:25,086 --> 01:50:26,690
Business is an addiction for me.

2219
01:50:27,655 --> 01:50:29,532
However much your investment was,

2220
01:50:29,658 --> 01:50:31,467
I'll pay you thrice that amount.

2221
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,468
Vijay is my future son in law.

2222
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,803
If I don't invest in his business,
then who will?

2223
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,610
What say?

2224
01:50:42,435 --> 01:50:43,937
I haven't thought about it, sir.

2225
01:50:45,104 --> 01:50:46,446
Think about it and tell me.

2226
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:48,817
I don't have the habit
of hiding anything.

2227
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:50,044
That's why I asked.

2228
01:50:53,078 --> 01:50:53,987
So...

2229
01:50:54,078 --> 01:50:54,988
Next Sunday.

2230
01:50:55,579 --> 01:50:58,423
It's the pre-engagement party,
between my daughter and him.

2231
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:00,523
It's not such a huge party.

2232
01:51:00,817 --> 01:51:02,797
Maximum 10-15 people.
That's all.

2233
01:51:02,953 --> 01:51:04,455
You should definitely come, dear.

2234
01:51:04,654 --> 01:51:05,655
No excuses.

2235
01:51:05,855 --> 01:51:06,765
Sir...

2236
01:51:07,157 --> 01:51:08,157
Pre-engagement party?

2237
01:51:09,057 --> 01:51:10,400
I wasn't told about this!

2238
01:51:11,993 --> 01:51:13,597
I came here to tell you about that.

2239
01:51:14,162 --> 01:51:16,004
And to give this cheque.

2240
01:51:17,998 --> 01:51:19,534
Here. Keep this.

2241
01:51:19,968 --> 01:51:20,878
What is this for?

2242
01:51:21,536 --> 01:51:23,572
I know that you have a lot
of needs now, Chandran.

2243
01:51:24,538 --> 01:51:27,485
The value of cash increases, when it
comes of help during emergencies!

2244
01:51:30,643 --> 01:51:33,089
Come, Chandran.
Show me around this place.

2245
01:51:42,754 --> 01:51:43,664
Come!

2246
01:51:47,725 --> 01:51:48,635
Grandma...

2247
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:49,702
I'm leaving then.

2248
01:51:50,394 --> 01:51:51,098
Sit, dear...

2249
01:51:51,394 --> 01:51:53,533
It's not that. I need to go
to a couple of other places.

2250
01:51:57,133 --> 01:51:58,076
Hey! Pinky!

2251
01:51:58,901 --> 01:51:59,811
Pinky!

2252
01:52:00,469 --> 01:52:01,743
Just because he said something...

2253
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:02,747
It's okay.

2254
01:52:02,904 --> 01:52:04,406
Pinky, I didn't know...

2255
01:52:37,834 --> 01:52:38,744
What is it?

2256
01:52:39,736 --> 01:52:40,680
I'm sorry.

2257
01:52:41,704 --> 01:52:42,648
Anything else?

2258
01:52:43,773 --> 01:52:45,150
From my family's side,

2259
01:52:46,041 --> 01:52:47,145
I had a lot of pressure.

2260
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:50,020
Dad...

2261
01:52:51,012 --> 01:52:54,653
I couldn't say no to a proposal
dad had given his word for.

2262
01:52:56,016 --> 01:52:56,926
But...

2263
01:52:57,684 --> 01:52:58,662
Somehow...

2264
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:00,790
That didn't happen. - Oh!

2265
01:53:01,421 --> 01:53:02,660
Then you remembered me suddenly?

2266
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:04,700
It's not that.

2267
01:53:04,991 --> 01:53:06,698
I thought about calling
you several times.

2268
01:53:07,726 --> 01:53:09,069
But I didn't have the
courage for that.

2269
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:11,539
Later...

2270
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:13,905
I saw the news of your
business on Facebook.

2271
01:53:15,167 --> 01:53:16,703
Then I wanted to
come and meet you.

2272
01:53:17,935 --> 01:53:18,879
To...

2273
01:53:19,937 --> 01:53:21,644
I just felt like
appreciating you in person.

2274
01:53:23,441 --> 01:53:24,145
Done?

2275
01:53:25,208 --> 01:53:26,118
Then leave.

2276
01:53:26,609 --> 01:53:27,917
Don't get late. - Pinky...

2277
01:53:29,446 --> 01:53:30,857
You're lucky that we're
in front of my house.

2278
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:33,084
Or else, I would have slapped
you hard on your face!

2279
01:53:33,882 --> 01:53:34,792
You know for what?

2280
01:53:36,051 --> 01:53:38,053
The courage you
showed while proposing?

2281
01:53:38,586 --> 01:53:40,088
For not showing that
while breaking up!

2282
01:54:06,744 --> 01:54:07,847
Why are you looking so gloomy?

2283
01:54:08,445 --> 01:54:09,150
Eat this.

2284
01:54:10,414 --> 01:54:11,119
I'll eat it.

2285
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:14,493
Dear...

2286
01:54:15,518 --> 01:54:18,089
Dad's friend and family came
that day to see you, right?

2287
01:54:19,188 --> 01:54:21,134
As far as we enquired,
that boy is good.

2288
01:54:21,924 --> 01:54:22,902
Good character.

2289
01:54:24,059 --> 01:54:25,129
And he's in Australia.

2290
01:54:25,627 --> 01:54:26,867
That's a major attraction.

2291
01:54:28,662 --> 01:54:29,606
To them...

2292
01:54:30,498 --> 01:54:31,875
What should we tell them, dear?

2293
01:54:33,501 --> 01:54:34,206
Your choice.

2294
01:54:34,835 --> 01:54:36,040
I said no to them.

2295
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:40,747
Don't stare! I'm serious.

2296
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:44,020
You should be living your life.

2297
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:48,415
If you had liked that proposal, you would
have told that to us that day itself.

2298
01:54:49,682 --> 01:54:55,791
When daughters grow up,
parent's hearts will be on fire.

2299
01:54:56,687 --> 01:54:59,860
As they are of marriage-able age,
it would just flare up!

2300
01:55:00,424 --> 01:55:03,667
It's not out of the anxiety
whether she would get a boy

2301
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,898
with a good character,
job and lineage.

2302
01:55:06,696 --> 01:55:10,974
When we think that the child we brought up
like this, has to be sent to another house,

2303
01:55:11,666 --> 01:55:14,510
When we realize that she's not going
to be ours alone hereafter...

2304
01:55:16,104 --> 01:55:19,107
You just need a ticket alone,
to go to Australia, right?

2305
01:55:20,107 --> 01:55:21,711
Your intuitions won't go wrong.

2306
01:55:29,883 --> 01:55:31,829
Mom won't force you for
anything hereafter, dear.

2307
01:55:33,619 --> 01:55:34,791
Your decisions...

2308
01:55:37,489 --> 01:55:39,594
will be the decisions of all
three of us from now on.

2309
01:56:07,047 --> 01:56:09,526
I'm joining the radio channel
officially on Sunday.

2310
01:56:09,683 --> 01:56:10,593
Evening show live.

2311
01:56:10,884 --> 01:56:11,828
I need a treat for that!

2312
01:56:12,052 --> 01:56:13,087
This treat is for that.

2313
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,555
Order anything you want.

2314
01:56:15,522 --> 01:56:17,626
On Sunday, both of you
should be on my show.

2315
01:56:18,524 --> 01:56:19,434
On radio?

2316
01:56:19,892 --> 01:56:21,030
Why are you talking as if you're
hearing this for the first time?

2317
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:22,571
Didn't I tell you earlier itself?

2318
01:56:22,728 --> 01:56:25,105
I called you both here
to discuss about that.

2319
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:27,073
The name of the show
is 'True Stories'.

2320
01:56:27,432 --> 01:56:28,604
<i>Pooh, no way!</i>

2321
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,106
No way!
- Just 10 minutes.

2322
01:56:30,434 --> 01:56:31,640
You need not come
to the studio even.

2323
01:56:31,769 --> 01:56:33,077
You just have to
talk over the phone.

2324
01:56:33,804 --> 01:56:35,181
It's his engagement
on Sunday, right?

2325
01:56:35,506 --> 01:56:36,416
That too, in the evening.

2326
01:56:36,707 --> 01:56:37,912
I know..
But Vijay...

2327
01:56:38,541 --> 01:56:39,576
ls there any way?

2328
01:56:39,776 --> 01:56:41,551
I had already told them.
Please!

2329
01:56:41,744 --> 01:56:43,087
Hey! You don't have to say please.

2330
01:56:43,779 --> 01:56:44,689
If Pinky is okay,

2331
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:45,990
I am also okay.

2332
01:56:46,081 --> 01:56:47,651
Now you don't say no.

2333
01:56:47,983 --> 01:56:48,893
Okay?

2334
01:56:49,417 --> 01:56:51,090
I'll go order something special.

2335
01:56:55,756 --> 01:56:57,758
Pinky, we didn't open the
food truck even yesterday.

2336
01:56:58,092 --> 01:56:59,502
The regular customers would be...

2337
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:02,071
Your father in law has quoted
a price for my share, right?

2338
01:57:02,762 --> 01:57:03,672
Are you serious?

2339
01:57:03,763 --> 01:57:05,003
Wasn't he serious?

2340
01:57:05,398 --> 01:57:06,774
If so? - I'll sell it.

2341
01:57:08,467 --> 01:57:09,844
No regrets? - Why?

2342
01:57:11,003 --> 01:57:12,505
It's just a food truck, right?

2343
01:57:15,573 --> 01:57:16,745
Uncle had called me yesterday.

2344
01:57:17,108 --> 01:57:18,712
Asking whether I got
any reply from you.

2345
01:57:19,444 --> 01:57:20,820
But I didn't call you because...

2346
01:57:21,044 --> 01:57:22,114
Why didn't you call me?

2347
01:57:24,047 --> 01:57:26,926
His plan is to buy other bigger
vehicles and re brand the whole thing.

2348
01:57:27,551 --> 01:57:28,756
So what about this food truck?

2349
01:57:28,985 --> 01:57:29,929
He might sell it.

2350
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:31,530
Or else...

2351
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,858
He might make it an ambulance.

2352
01:57:35,424 --> 01:57:37,563
Or else, he might get it crushed!
- Get it crushed?

2353
01:57:38,459 --> 01:57:39,699
It's just a food truck, right?

2354
01:57:43,097 --> 01:57:44,075
Naresh had come.

2355
01:57:46,467 --> 01:57:48,606
So you have to say a
lot of things to me.

2356
01:57:49,369 --> 01:57:50,677
Do you say everything to me?

2357
01:57:51,104 --> 01:57:52,742
Had you told me about
your engagement?

2358
01:57:53,406 --> 01:57:55,750
Pinky, it's just a
pre-engagement party.

2359
01:57:56,675 --> 01:57:57,915
I didn't know about that.

2360
01:57:58,510 --> 01:58:00,751
I also heard about it for the
first time, when you heard it.

2361
01:58:01,447 --> 01:58:02,653
And why should I hide from you?

2362
01:58:03,415 --> 01:58:04,654
He came and said sorry to me.

2363
01:58:06,684 --> 01:58:07,594
Isn't he ashamed?

2364
01:58:08,653 --> 01:58:09,927
He is better than you anyway.

2365
01:58:10,554 --> 01:58:12,533
At least he is showing
his emotions outside.

2366
01:58:12,689 --> 01:58:13,793
Don't compare me with him.

2367
01:58:13,957 --> 01:58:15,561
Okay?
- I don't feel any difference.

2368
01:58:15,658 --> 01:58:16,796
Even after saying
something from my heart,

2369
01:58:16,926 --> 01:58:18,370
why is it so difficult
for you to believe it?

2370
01:58:18,494 --> 01:58:20,132
My intention is not an argument.

2371
01:58:20,429 --> 01:58:21,134
Then?

2372
01:58:21,463 --> 01:58:23,704
I just wanted to meet you once,
and say a bye cleanly.

2373
01:58:25,033 --> 01:58:26,773
We met each other drinking a coffee,

2374
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:29,945
and now let's go our separate ways,
the same way.

2375
01:58:42,982 --> 01:58:44,393
I just have one thing to tell you.

2376
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:46,896
Don't become your
father in law's puppet.

2377
01:58:48,953 --> 01:58:50,023
Find your own space.

2378
01:58:50,455 --> 01:58:53,664
'Going away like a day'

2379
01:58:54,325 --> 01:58:55,668
'Disappearing like a night'

2380
01:58:55,826 --> 01:58:56,736
Where is Pinky?

2381
01:58:57,527 --> 01:58:58,437
She left.

2382
01:58:58,529 --> 01:59:04,570
'The words which never sprouted,
are departing'

2383
01:59:06,369 --> 01:59:09,542
'Staying away'

2384
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:12,918
'Coming closer'

2385
01:59:13,075 --> 01:59:15,953
'All that has become a story'

2386
01:59:20,781 --> 01:59:27,994
'We n1et each other,
just to drift apart from each other'

2387
01:59:28,421 --> 01:59:35,360
'As a memory of a shadow'

2388
01:59:36,562 --> 01:59:44,560
'There are a thousand stories
left in the heart, to tell you'

2389
01:59:55,344 --> 01:59:56,049
Namaste.

2390
01:59:56,579 --> 01:59:57,489
Come inside.

2391
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:58,714
Please sit.
Come.

2392
02:00:09,523 --> 02:00:10,661
Hello Vljay!

2393
02:00:11,058 --> 02:00:12,866
Why are you standing here,
all gloomy?

2394
02:00:13,025 --> 02:00:14,868
Hey! I was just..
- You are the hero of the day!

2395
02:00:16,095 --> 02:00:18,939
Were you thinking that you lost the
business for the day? - No, uncle.

2396
02:00:19,065 --> 02:00:21,340
Say yes. I'll be happy to hear that.

2397
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:23,811
Have a drink.
- Vijay!

2398
02:00:24,036 --> 02:00:26,539
Vijay, it's time for
that radio interview...

2399
02:00:26,838 --> 02:00:28,544
I have a radio interview, uncle.

2400
02:00:28,673 --> 02:00:30,983
ls there any room with privacy upstairs?
- Oh yeah. Chandran told me.

2401
02:00:31,809 --> 02:00:34,118
Go right upstairs.
First door on the left.

2402
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:35,480
There's no one there.
Go ahead.

2403
02:00:35,545 --> 02:00:36,785
Okay. Best of luck.
- Shall I go?

2404
02:00:36,847 --> 02:00:38,690
Escaped! Or else, he'll keep bragging.
- Hello!

2405
02:00:39,349 --> 02:00:40,054
You guys!

2406
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,686
Do you do only music,
or anything else?

2407
02:00:42,818 --> 02:00:44,491
No. We do write a bit.

2408
02:00:44,653 --> 02:00:45,631
We're writing a novel.

2409
02:00:45,788 --> 02:00:47,426
Novel? Oh my God!
- Yeah.

2410
02:00:47,622 --> 02:00:48,759
What's the name of the novel?

2411
02:00:49,524 --> 02:00:50,730
A terrorist inside a jetty!

2412
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:53,764
Excuse me. What?

2413
02:00:53,895 --> 02:00:54,999
A terrorist inside a jetty!

2414
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:58,833
Actually, it's the story of a boat
jetty being attacked by a terrorist.

2415
02:00:58,966 --> 02:01:00,036
It's a terrorist attack.

2416
02:01:00,367 --> 02:01:01,402
Yes.

2417
02:01:01,568 --> 02:01:02,978
Okay.
What's the status of my music?

2418
02:01:03,302 --> 02:01:04,406
We're making it. We'll give it.

2419
02:01:04,537 --> 02:01:05,447
Make it!

2420
02:01:05,638 --> 02:01:06,548
We will make it.

2421
02:01:06,672 --> 02:01:08,049
Okay sir. - Cheers!

2422
02:01:08,875 --> 02:01:09,978
Novel, it seems!

2423
02:01:10,442 --> 02:01:11,386
Idiots!

2424
02:01:11,576 --> 02:01:12,486
Sit here, Hariettan.

2425
02:01:13,812 --> 02:01:15,416
Didn't you recognize Hariettan?

2426
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:17,386
No.
- He's a family friend of ours.

2427
02:01:17,715 --> 02:01:18,819
He's a major businessman.

2428
02:01:19,516 --> 02:01:21,359
He owns four elephants!

2429
02:01:21,418 --> 02:01:23,420
Haven't you heard of
‘Aana‘ (Elephant) Hari?

2430
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,056
No. I've heard of Haryana!

2431
02:01:28,525 --> 02:01:29,868
Aren't you ready yet?

2432
02:01:30,426 --> 02:01:31,699
Everyone is asking for her.

2433
02:01:31,894 --> 02:01:34,704
She's getting her make-up done,
getting ready, will be ready now...

2434
02:01:34,796 --> 02:01:36,833
There's a limit in
managing saying all that.

2435
02:01:37,799 --> 02:01:38,742
It's okay.

2436
02:01:38,966 --> 02:01:40,274
You go downstairs.
- Okay.

2437
02:01:40,401 --> 02:01:41,311
I'll take care of it.

2438
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:43,041
Hey!

2439
02:01:43,437 --> 02:01:44,882
You can't be upset
like this anymore.

2440
02:01:44,972 --> 02:01:46,575
Come on!
You're the centre of attraction!

2441
02:01:46,673 --> 02:01:48,380
Daddy, I told you so many times.

2442
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:49,982
If I'm going to have
a married life,

2443
02:01:50,277 --> 02:01:51,915
it will be with someone I love!

2444
02:01:52,012 --> 02:01:53,957
Don't make me raise my voice.

2445
02:01:54,279 --> 02:01:55,553
Come on! Get ready!
Come.

2446
02:01:55,681 --> 02:01:57,820
Where is she? Didn't see her yet.
- She is getting ready.

2447
02:01:57,916 --> 02:01:59,896
Let's sit downstairs.
- Come. Let's sit downstairs.

2448
02:02:00,019 --> 02:02:02,692
When he came to see me,
and when I met him at the restaurant,

2449
02:02:02,787 --> 02:02:05,859
I told you many times,
don't put this poor guy in trouble!

2450
02:02:06,491 --> 02:02:10,336
I played along for all this only because
of your threat that you'll commit suicide.

2451
02:02:11,295 --> 02:02:12,933
Now I must move practically.

2452
02:02:13,764 --> 02:02:14,741
Salman loves me.

2453
02:02:15,398 --> 02:02:16,342
That's enough for me.

2454
02:02:16,732 --> 02:02:20,874
I very well know that this
pre-engagement drama is to influence me.

2455
02:02:22,704 --> 02:02:23,739
Pre-engagement!

2456
02:02:23,972 --> 02:02:25,952
Yeah right! As if we're
living in America!

2457
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:28,612
And so many buffoons to come
running as soon as they are invited.

2458
02:02:28,742 --> 02:02:30,551
Enough!
- Daddy, my matter.. - Enough!

2459
02:02:35,649 --> 02:02:36,592
Shucks!

2460
02:02:42,088 --> 02:02:43,725
Vijay is an amazing guy.

2461
02:02:44,856 --> 02:02:47,097
He is going to be a very
successful businessman.

2462
02:02:47,392 --> 02:02:49,394
You can do business
with him then, Daddy!

2463
02:02:49,595 --> 02:02:51,835
Why should you compromise
my life for that?

2464
02:02:52,396 --> 02:02:53,807
Dear... ls your father inside?

2465
02:02:57,967 --> 02:02:58,945
Oh! Chandran?

2466
02:02:59,069 --> 02:03:00,605
What was that noise I heard?

2467
02:03:00,704 --> 02:03:01,705
What noise?

2468
02:03:02,338 --> 02:03:03,476
We didn't hear anything.

2469
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:06,681
ls there any problem?

2470
02:03:07,743 --> 02:03:08,983
Any other issue or grievance?

2471
02:03:09,745 --> 02:03:12,020
That happiness that's usually
there on your face is missing.

2472
02:03:12,347 --> 02:03:13,121
That's why I asked.

2473
02:03:13,448 --> 02:03:15,689
See Chandran, you should
be having a drink.

2474
02:03:16,650 --> 02:03:19,459
My only confusion is that why
you haven't taken it yet.

2475
02:03:24,858 --> 02:03:26,495
You said that frankly, right?

2476
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:27,769
Of course.

2477
02:03:39,571 --> 02:03:40,674
Hello Pooja?
- Hello?

2478
02:03:41,038 --> 02:03:42,073
Hi. You're ready, right?

2479
02:03:42,339 --> 02:03:43,841
- Yes, I'm ready.
- I know you're busy.

2480
02:03:43,941 --> 02:03:45,682
I'll finish it off
quickly in ten minutes.

2481
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:47,011
No. That's okay.

2482
02:03:47,543 --> 02:03:48,521
Just a minute.

2483
02:03:48,611 --> 02:03:50,420
I'm adding her also on
the conference call.

2484
02:03:50,913 --> 02:03:51,823
Okay.

2485
02:03:55,451 --> 02:03:56,896
I don't want to insult you, Dad.

2486
02:03:57,385 --> 02:03:58,090
I'll come downstairs.

2487
02:03:58,420 --> 02:03:59,558
Just to save your face.

2488
02:03:59,755 --> 02:04:00,790
But, from tomorrow...

2489
02:04:01,423 --> 02:04:02,901
don't force me for this alliance.

2490
02:04:13,466 --> 02:04:16,639
Just 10 minutes and we'll finish
everything quickly, okay?

2491
02:04:17,035 --> 02:04:18,708
Hey! Hey!
Don't overdo it.

2492
02:04:18,837 --> 02:04:20,976
Take your own time.
- Okay. I'm going to switch over.

2493
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:22,045
Four..

2494
02:04:22,474 --> 02:04:23,383
Three...

2495
02:04:23,474 --> 02:04:24,578
Two...
One.

2496
02:04:25,777 --> 02:04:28,587
Namaste. You're listening
to 'True Stories'.

2497
02:04:28,713 --> 02:04:30,714
<i>And this is RJ Pooh.</i>

2498
02:04:30,881 --> 02:04:35,489
In today's 'True Stories', two people are
here to share their true stories with us.

2499
02:04:35,685 --> 02:04:37,358
Vijay Super and Pournami.

2500
02:04:37,621 --> 02:04:40,499
The amusement when your hear these
names, is there in their lives as well.

2501
02:04:41,357 --> 02:04:42,961
They met through a
match-making ceremony,

2502
02:04:43,292 --> 02:04:44,464
then went their own ways,

2503
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,867
then they met again,

2504
02:04:45,994 --> 02:04:48,736
and today, they are the entrepreneurs
of the restaurant on wheels,

2505
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:52,333
'Good food, Good music', known
to all the foodies in Kochi.

2506
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:53,537
First you tell me, Vijay...

2507
02:04:53,801 --> 02:04:55,872
Your made Pinky, whom you went to see
for an alliance at a wrong address,

2508
02:04:56,003 --> 02:04:57,311
your business partner.

2509
02:04:57,437 --> 02:04:59,882
And you're going to make another
girl your life partner now.

2510
02:05:00,072 --> 02:05:02,313
Did you find that girl
on your own or...

2511
02:05:02,375 --> 02:05:05,356
I mean... Was it love?
Or did your parents find her for you?

2512
02:05:06,346 --> 02:05:08,484
Hello? I'm asking you, Vijay.

2513
02:05:08,546 --> 02:05:09,490
Tell me.

2514
02:05:09,814 --> 02:05:10,724
Hello Pooja...

2515
02:05:10,882 --> 02:05:11,826
Yes, tell me.

2516
02:05:11,950 --> 02:05:14,930
If Vijay has to do something,
he needs to ask so many people.

2517
02:05:15,319 --> 02:05:17,890
He's the type who is very scared
to take a decision on his own.

2518
02:05:18,889 --> 02:05:22,335
How did you make a person with so much
fear, your business partner, Pinky?

2519
02:05:23,926 --> 02:05:24,961
What do you feel, Vijay?

2520
02:05:25,595 --> 02:05:26,539
Hello Vijay?

2521
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:29,736
- I can hear you.
- Don't just hear me. Open up!

2522
02:05:29,865 --> 02:05:30,935
This is 'True Stories'.

2523
02:05:31,066 --> 02:05:32,477
You can say anything that's true.

2524
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,370
What Pinky said is correct.

2525
02:05:36,404 --> 02:05:37,610
Pinky is not afraid of anything.

2526
02:05:38,706 --> 02:05:39,650
Pinky...

2527
02:05:40,408 --> 02:05:42,444
Pinky is not scared about how
to impress her parents...

2528
02:05:43,877 --> 02:05:46,687
Pinky is not scared whether someone
would hurt her emotions...

2529
02:05:47,681 --> 02:05:49,785
If she is asked to dress up
for a match-making ceremony,

2530
02:05:49,916 --> 02:05:51,452
she's not at all
scared of that too.

2531
02:05:51,817 --> 02:05:53,626
But I am really the
opposite of that.

2532
02:05:54,753 --> 02:05:55,697

...

2533
02:05:56,355 --> 02:05:57,890
I can't take up any
kind of tension!

2534
02:05:59,691 --> 02:06:01,671
When I went to meet her that day...

2535
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:03,804
the first thing Pinky
told me was that,

2536
02:06:04,295 --> 02:06:05,638
we're not at all a good match.

2537
02:06:06,864 --> 02:06:08,070
When that door got locked there,

2538
02:06:08,532 --> 02:06:11,068
and I sat there and talked to
Pinky for a long time, I realized...

2539
02:06:11,467 --> 02:06:15,745
that people like me, who had no vision
or ambition in life, are just big zeroes!

2540
02:06:16,539 --> 02:06:19,678
Despite chanting that
'Vijay is super' like a prayer always,

2541
02:06:20,075 --> 02:06:21,577
I'm someone who could
never be super.

2542
02:06:22,077 --> 02:06:23,021
Still...

2543
02:06:23,612 --> 02:06:24,852
lam doing a business today...

2544
02:06:25,946 --> 02:06:28,620
Pooja is taking an interview of mine,
sitting at a radio station.

2545
02:06:30,451 --> 02:06:31,429
The reason for all that...

2546
02:06:34,688 --> 02:06:35,632
I'm sure about one thing.

2547
02:06:36,522 --> 02:06:37,432
If Pinky goes back,

2548
02:06:38,491 --> 02:06:39,560
within very few days,

2549
02:06:40,326 --> 02:06:41,600
I'll become that old Vijay.

2550
02:06:44,997 --> 02:06:47,272
What's that confusion within you?

2551
02:06:48,433 --> 02:06:49,434
Okay. One second.

2552
02:06:49,534 --> 02:06:51,275
Someone here is not saying anything.

2553
02:06:51,469 --> 02:06:53,380
Pinky, are you there?
- Yeah, Pooja. Tell me.

2554
02:06:53,471 --> 02:06:54,414
Okay, Pinky.
Tell me.

2555
02:06:54,604 --> 02:06:55,912
To someone who's come to
see you for an alliance,

2556
02:06:55,973 --> 02:06:58,613
the first thing you say is 'We're
not a good match', or what?

2557
02:06:58,742 --> 02:07:00,278
I always follow my heart.

2558
02:07:00,677 --> 02:07:02,349
It's true that I said so.

2559
02:07:02,945 --> 02:07:04,481
But when he left that room that day,

2560
02:07:05,581 --> 02:07:06,924
it wasn't like that in my mind.

2561
02:07:16,056 --> 02:07:18,866
Certain things would be new
information for you, Vijay.

2562
02:07:19,059 --> 02:07:21,869
Anyway, let's listen to
a superhit melody now.

2563
02:07:21,962 --> 02:07:25,067
After that, Pinky's
Australian travel dreams...

2564
02:07:25,431 --> 02:07:27,468
Vijay‘s engagement news...

2565
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:29,546
Then you would both go
your own separate ways.

2566
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:34,472
Both of you have
exactly one minute.

2567
02:07:34,673 --> 02:07:36,516
You can say anything that's special.

2568
02:07:36,575 --> 02:07:37,678
Anyone can start.

2569
02:07:37,909 --> 02:07:38,819
Come on!

2570
02:07:39,477 --> 02:07:40,387
Hello?

2571
02:07:40,979 --> 02:07:42,856
Hello? We don't have time.

2572
02:07:43,748 --> 02:07:44,657
Give it to me.

2573
02:07:44,981 --> 02:07:46,460
Hello? Hello? - Dad...

2574
02:07:46,549 --> 02:07:47,789
Why aren't you saying anything?

2575
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:49,521
Hello. - Hello?

2576
02:07:49,886 --> 02:07:51,024
I am Chandramohan.

2577
02:07:51,854 --> 02:07:52,798
Vijay‘s father.

2578
02:07:53,322 --> 02:07:54,630
Can I talk for a minute?

2579
02:07:56,925 --> 02:07:58,699
Of course, Uncle. Tell me.

2580
02:07:58,926 --> 02:08:00,837
I want to talk to Pinky.

2581
02:08:01,495 --> 02:08:02,405
Are you listening, dear?

2582
02:08:02,697 --> 02:08:04,301
Uncle. - Dear...

2583
02:08:04,465 --> 02:08:05,841
You are a very bold girl.

2584
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,879
You have efficiency and smartness.

2585
02:08:09,736 --> 02:08:10,840
Vijay is not like that.

2586
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:14,580
Considering that,
like you told him...

2587
02:08:15,041 --> 02:08:16,714
you both are not at
all a good match.

2588
02:08:17,343 --> 02:08:18,048
But..

2589
02:08:18,577 --> 02:08:19,884
have you noticed one thing, dear?

2590
02:08:20,645 --> 02:08:22,283
When we look from outside,

2591
02:08:22,547 --> 02:08:24,288
those who don't seem
to be good matches,

2592
02:08:24,716 --> 02:08:27,321
have achieved the
most success in life.

2593
02:08:29,954 --> 02:08:35,460
Marriage life is like people who don't
know to make coffee, trying to make it.

2594
02:08:35,992 --> 02:08:37,699
Sometimes the bitterness
might become too much.

2595
02:08:38,728 --> 02:08:40,332
Sometimes, it might
become too less too.

2596
02:08:40,863 --> 02:08:41,863
But one day...

2597
02:08:42,631 --> 02:08:44,304
one day, the measure
will be just perfect.

2598
02:08:45,801 --> 02:08:47,678
Once you understand
that perfect measure,

2599
02:08:48,303 --> 02:08:49,508
it will be very easy to live.

2600
02:08:51,905 --> 02:08:54,613
It was two people who conquered
Mount Everest for the first time.

2601
02:08:55,742 --> 02:08:58,018
But, until they died...

2602
02:08:58,578 --> 02:08:59,886
they never revealed one truth.

2603
02:09:00,547 --> 02:09:03,493
Who was the first one who set foot
on Everest, among the two of them.

2604
02:09:04,716 --> 02:09:07,390
That's what partnership
should be all about.

2605
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:14,427
I barged in, grabbed the phone
from him, and said so much to you...

2606
02:09:14,692 --> 02:09:15,966
because of my selfishness.

2607
02:09:16,828 --> 02:09:19,899
If you leave one fine day,
leaving everything to him,

2608
02:09:20,030 --> 02:09:22,636
when I heard him say that he would
become the old Vijay again...

2609
02:09:23,567 --> 02:09:24,840
I felt a heart-burn within me.

2610
02:09:25,835 --> 02:09:26,745
That's why...

2611
02:09:29,739 --> 02:09:30,649

...

2612
02:09:30,806 --> 02:09:32,785
I am giving the phone to Vijay.

2613
02:09:34,342 --> 02:09:35,047
Thank you, Uncle.

2614
02:09:35,343 --> 02:09:38,449
For blessing the first episode of
'True Stories' with such good words.

2615
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:40,957
Like someone had written somewhere,

2616
02:09:41,248 --> 02:09:43,353
'Stars are always in the sky'

2617
02:09:43,451 --> 02:09:44,930
'But we don't see them in the morning'

2618
02:09:45,219 --> 02:09:46,561
The debts we have to repay...

2619
02:09:46,786 --> 02:09:48,561
We can repay them,
even by selling our house.

2620
02:09:50,223 --> 02:09:52,897
House is a place where we should
be living happily with our family.

2621
02:09:53,458 --> 02:09:54,630
Or else, it's just a building.

2622
02:09:56,561 --> 02:09:58,905
Don't do anything,
by sacrificing your happiness.

2623
02:09:59,798 --> 02:10:00,741
Now..

2624
02:10:01,365 --> 02:10:04,471
when a flood happened,
even though everyone struggled a lot,

2625
02:10:04,836 --> 02:10:06,474
didn't we overcome all that?

2626
02:10:07,437 --> 02:10:08,575
It's even more difficult,

2627
02:10:09,239 --> 02:10:12,516
to take certain crucial decisions
at certain crucial moments in life.

2628
02:10:15,377 --> 02:10:16,321
Think about it, son.

2629
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:18,019
Okay?

2630
02:10:18,647 --> 02:10:19,557
It's not late at all.

2631
02:10:29,456 --> 02:10:31,629
When uncle came to the
programme unexpectedly,

2632
02:10:31,925 --> 02:10:34,838
said a lot of meaningful things,
and handed over the phone,

2633
02:10:35,629 --> 02:10:39,542
it feels like you have left something to
say, at the brim of whatever you said.

2634
02:10:39,699 --> 02:10:41,542
I think it's like this.

2635
02:10:41,767 --> 02:10:44,508
Too late is far better than never.

2636
02:10:44,669 --> 02:10:45,579
Am I right?

2637
02:10:46,404 --> 02:10:48,645
What do you say, Pinky and Vijay?

2638
02:10:50,407 --> 02:10:51,317
Hello?

2639
02:10:52,776 --> 02:10:55,586
Come on, speak up! This is 'True Stories'.
Come on!

2640
02:11:05,955 --> 02:11:07,730
Come on! You have to speak up.

2641
02:11:09,558 --> 02:11:10,468
Say it!

2642
02:11:10,826 --> 02:11:11,770
Come on, say it!

2643
02:11:15,763 --> 02:11:16,707
Okay then.

2644
02:11:21,635 --> 02:11:25,879
'As the ray of sunlight disappears'

2645
02:11:26,471 --> 02:11:30,578
'As the cool breeze covers you'

2646
02:11:31,243 --> 02:11:35,247
'As the ray of sunlight disappears'

2647
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:40,195
'As the cool breeze covers you'

2648
02:11:40,650 --> 02:11:48,466
'As you go alone, on the
path where darkness falls'

2649
02:11:48,858 --> 02:11:56,857
'To cure the pain of
this throbbing night'

2650
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:06,599
'Shining far away,
there's a star that you embraced'

2651
02:12:08,542 --> 02:12:13,251
'On the lap of the heart,
filled with tender leaves'

2652
02:12:13,413 --> 02:12:17,588
'Sleep, my little one'

2653
02:12:18,283 --> 02:12:22,857
'I shall caress your eyes with dreams'

2654
02:12:22,988 --> 02:12:26,958
'Sleep, my dear'

2655
02:12:27,492 --> 02:12:31,564
'On the lap of the heart,
filled with tender leaves'

2656
02:12:32,362 --> 02:12:36,606
'Sleep, my little one'

2657
02:12:36,966 --> 02:12:41,573
'I shall caress your eyes with dreams'

2658
02:12:41,703 --> 02:12:45,912
'Sleep, my dear'

2659
02:12:46,441 --> 02:12:52,413
'Sleep, my dear'

2660
02:13:35,516 --> 02:13:36,551
Pass it, dude.

2661
02:13:36,651 --> 02:13:37,994
Vijay!
- Dude, come on!

2662
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:39,229
Don't play alone.

2663
02:13:39,386 --> 02:13:40,660
Dude, over here.

2664
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:44,760
Don't hit it to the water.

2665
02:13:47,393 --> 02:13:48,303
Look at this!

2666
02:13:48,428 --> 02:13:49,770
Try this, man!

2667
02:13:49,895 --> 02:13:50,930
Pass it!
- Hey! Catch it.

2668
02:13:51,864 --> 02:13:52,865
Pass it, dude.

2669
02:13:53,232 --> 02:13:54,233
I heard everything.

2670
02:13:54,299 --> 02:13:55,334
Don't hit it outside.

2671
02:13:55,567 --> 02:13:57,637
I didn't think that We
would meet so soon.

2672
02:13:58,236 --> 02:13:58,976
Hello!

2673
02:13:59,237 --> 02:14:00,511
I am Naresh.
- on!

2674
02:14:00,605 --> 02:14:02,346
She wouldn't have told
you about me, right?

2675
02:14:02,473 --> 02:14:04,850
Oh! No!
- When you get time, just ask her.

2676
02:14:05,408 --> 02:14:06,318
Okay.

2677
02:14:07,244 --> 02:14:08,314
Pinky, I got married.

2678
02:14:09,246 --> 02:14:09,986
The girl...

2679
02:14:10,447 --> 02:14:11,584
is not as hep as you are.

2680
02:14:11,948 --> 02:14:12,858
She's quite traditional.

2681
02:14:13,416 --> 02:14:14,451
A sharp contrast to you.

2682
02:14:14,684 --> 02:14:15,594
But I am really happy.

2683
02:14:15,852 --> 02:14:16,762
She is better for me.

2684
02:14:17,486 --> 02:14:18,429
Come out.

2685
02:14:18,686 --> 02:14:19,892
I'll introduce you to someone.

2686
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,934
9207066221 .

2687
02:14:29,597 --> 02:14:31,406
You should call me, okay?

2688
02:14:31,665 --> 02:14:33,871
If I get time, I'll call you back.

2689
02:14:36,502 --> 02:14:37,446
Reshma?

2690
02:14:37,604 --> 02:14:38,514
Yes.

2691
02:14:38,805 --> 02:14:39,714
Why are you laughing?

2692
02:14:39,805 --> 02:14:40,749
Her?

2693
02:14:43,341 --> 02:14:44,285
Hey!

2694
02:14:46,445 --> 02:14:47,479
Congratulations.

2695
02:14:47,611 --> 02:14:48,521
Peace, bro!

2696
02:14:51,783 --> 02:14:53,421
Didn't I tell you?
God is there, dude.

2697
02:14:53,551 --> 02:14:56,292
Even though she's traditional, she's
okay, dude. Why are you laughing?

2698
