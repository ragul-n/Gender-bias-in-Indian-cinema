the past 5 years. l have all records.

190

l was playing marhles when

l picked up the hen so
the cat wouldn.t eat her!

why did you eat the evidence?

714
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:28,929
l interrogated the thief.
but he couldn.t recall the owner.

715
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,929
so l decided to eat it lest
anyone else steals it again.

716
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,994

My mother and grannie

817
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,530
and grannie tells me
that the thakur will...

818

827
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:36,807

ahle men from 16 villages around here

829
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:49,013

839
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,872
ho! don.t! please!

840
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,761
l.m willing to do whatever
you want me to do!

841
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:04,898
..please let me visit my mother,
wife and child. for once, please!..

842
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:17,607
..for the sake of your family, you
must work without uttering a word!..

843
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:20,143
slaves! Listen carefully
to what l have to say.

844
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:27,616
Memhers of your families live
as long as you work for me.

845
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:32,821
and your lives depend on whether your
folks hack home keep their traps shut.

846
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:44,530
people in your villages will die
if anyone speaks of my mines.

847
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,746
y ou guessed it right!
the soil here is laden with silver.

848
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,882
take a look at this sample.

849
01:30:57,084 --> 01:31:01,043
l told you so.
these lands are full of silver.

850
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:06,021
at least 680/o silver!

851
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:12,198
y ou.ve done a fine joh of assaying.
but your estimates are wrong.

852
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:19,969
the percentage of silver
isn.t 68. lt is 860/o

853
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:24,474
but l must congratulate you
for doing a thorough joh.

854
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:28,671
but whatever you are doing
is patently illegal.

855
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:35,289
.y ou might he educated, professor.
but you are a fool nevertheless!..

856
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:41,554
.these lands are my ancestral
property. today, they are mine...

857
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:46,332
does the government have any
rights over these lands now?

858
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:53,169
.the peasant who farms a land,
owns the produce...

859
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:59,104
.the farmer who digs a well on his
land, has the right to his water...

860
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:04,179
why then should l not have a right
to the silver that my lands yield?

861
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,118
how come the government
has the right to my silver?

862
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:10,347
the government owns all properties
that may he excavated from the earth.

863
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:21,190
please don.t kill me!
l have a wife and children!

864
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:24,805
l shall not speak of
it to anyone! l swear!

865
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:29,932
l won.t make a widow of your wife.
l won.t orphan your children.

866
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:33,877
vikram... cut his tongue out.
and cut off his hands.

867
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:38,345
don.t! please! l have a wife!
l have little children!

868
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,148
what have you in mind
for this new lnspector?

869
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,758
lt.s heen 2 days since
he has taken charge.

870
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,757
but he hasn.t yet come to see you.

871
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:51,256
spare him for the day. for today we
pay oheisance to the goddess bhawani.

872
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:54,464
but make sure you see him tomorrow.

thakur...? oh l see. thakur!

886

01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:11,135
...in this village?
the thakur.s wish is the law here.

888
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:19,010
..lnspectors who come here, pay
oheisance to the thakur first of all...

889
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,814
the law pays oheisance to none.

890
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:26,517
..lnstead, the mightiest of men and the
toughest of criminals how hefore it...

891

980
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:21,994
this passage is onlyfor me.
ho one else can use it.

981
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:27,263

in hy the darkness of the night.

982
01:48:31,204 --> 01:48:32,865

983
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:38,738
My silent soldiers. should someone
even manage to slip past...

..
everything l do, is done in style...

987
01:49:06,573 --> 01:49:07,801
lt might he a heautiful house.

988
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:09,876
but the person who lives here

1009
01:50:43,236 --> 01:50:46,330

1010

l.ll serve you faithfully
all my life. don.t worry.

1016
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:14,730
but l.d like greenhacks for hiscuits.

1017
01:51:18,738 --> 01:51:22,731
y ou.re the first dog l.ve seen
which hehaves like a monkey.

1018
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:26,373
here... eat a hiscuit.

1019
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:33,145
.why are you running,
guddu? walk slowly...

1020
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:36,878
l don.t want to talk to you!

1021
01:51:37,057 --> 01:51:38,786
- why?
- why not?

1022
01:51:38,892 --> 01:51:42,487
thakur.s men fought with you. and
they threw my chick peas away!

1023
01:51:42,662 --> 01:51:48,396
and they made me cry! and you took
his money! and you apologised to him!

1024
01:51:48,568 --> 01:51:50,798
and you talk to him!
l don.t want to talk to you!

1025
01:51:51,171 --> 01:51:54,937
l did all that on purpose. l wanted
to see that thakur for myself.

1026
01:51:55,108 --> 01:52:02,276
..besides, it.s important to gauge
the strength of an adversary...

1027
01:52:03,116 --> 01:52:05,084
d.you have any idea the power
that this uniform exudes?

1028
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:07,016
- ho.
- heither did l.

1029
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,886
but l have understood how valuahle
it is ever since l wore it.

1030
01:52:11,124 --> 01:52:13,752
how wait and watch what
l do to that thakur.

1031
01:52:16,296 --> 01:52:19,993
Me too! l have a hig stick!
l.ll hash him with it!

1032
01:52:23,103 --> 01:52:27,938
that.s the spirit! had everyone else
in the village understood that...

1033
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:40,813
a ray of hope has shone upon the
dark lives of people in this village.

1034
01:52:41,988 --> 01:52:49,156
the new lnspector. he wants to free
your hrother and the others...

1035
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:54,593
...from the clutches of the thakur.
and happiness will he ours again.

1036
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:56,996
Mother... who is he?

1037
01:52:57,237 --> 01:53:03,437
My son. he wanted to stay with me.
he didn.t want to serve the thakur.

1038
01:53:05,044 --> 01:53:06,944
thakur killed him.

1039
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:16,948
l cannot hring hack the past.

1040
01:53:19,926 --> 01:53:25,956
..but the times to come, will
he hetter. that l promise...

1041
01:53:59,365 --> 01:54:02,391
- where.s the police station?
- what? the police station?!

1042
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:04,497
over there.

1043
01:54:09,409 --> 01:54:11,934
..-what.s happening around here?
- what.s it. grannie?..

1044
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:15,205
.the other day, someone in the
village stole the lnspector.s pants...

1045
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:18,009
her clothes must.ve heen stolen
hefore she entered the village.

1046
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:20,219
she must.ve gone there
to lodge the complaint.

1047
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,520
My love!

1048
01:54:30,296 --> 01:54:32,230

- who are you?

1050
01:54:42,308 --> 01:54:44,276
l.d like to ask you
the same question.

1051
01:54:45,245 --> 01:54:48,214
My mistake. l.m commissioner
khush-haal singh.s daughter. kajal.

1052
01:54:49,315 --> 01:54:51,078
l thought you are the lnspector.

1053
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,209
do l look like a thief?

1054
01:54:54,454 --> 01:54:57,423
l meant lnspector amar.
l am here to meet him.

1055
01:54:57,924 --> 01:55:00,324
he.s the one who was
transferred here. who are you?

1056
01:55:01,761 --> 01:55:05,663
l.m the senior lnspector here. amar
is my assistant. the junior lnspector.

1057
01:55:06,432 --> 01:55:08,161
..

1058
01:55:08,368 --> 01:55:09,300

1059
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:11,096
- he is looking for a huffalo.
- a huffalo?!

1060
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:13,431
but the huffalo wasn.t stolen.
someone lost the huffalo.

1061
01:55:13,606 --> 01:55:16,370
there have heen no thefts in
this village since l took over.

1062
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:18,577
thank god that king doesn.t
know ahout this village.

1063
01:55:20,546 --> 01:55:25,882
a notorious hurglar. and he.s giving
a tough time to the police in bomhay.

1064
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:31,550
lt.s hecause of him that amar has
heen transferred here. and here l am.

1065
01:55:31,724 --> 01:55:35,387
how did you pick up courage to travel
down such a lonely stretch?

1066
01:55:35,662 --> 01:55:37,596
l haven.t come here alone.

1067
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:40,088

1068
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:43,533

y ou have to do some acting

l have it in my hlood.

1088
01:56:59,712 --> 01:57:03,478
swine! there were two of them!

01:57:03,583 --> 01:57:06,347
and you took a heating hefore
turning tail! what did you expect?!

1090
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:08,682

1091
01:57:08,788 --> 01:57:11,757
..

1092
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:16,662
hear me out...

1093
01:57:17,663 --> 01:57:19,858
My sister has come to this village.

1094
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:23,196
she had fallen in love
with a guy called amar.

1095
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:26,270
..
do you know what..love.. means?..

1096
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:30,808
y es! and l have fallen

1097
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:39,242
..for once, guddu! please try to

1098
01:57:39,519 --> 01:57:42,852
forgive me. My mistake.

1099
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:46,217
amar used to he a police
officer. just like l am.

1100
01:57:49,629 --> 01:57:53,565
but he looked like you.

1101
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:02,737
kajal used to love lnspector amar
dearly. but he deserted her.

1102
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:07,209
My sister was shocked.
she had hecome insane.

1103
01:58:07,713 --> 01:58:12,412
l like to see mad people!
- shut up! she isn.t mad anymore.

1104
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:16,212
she might think that
you are lnspector amar.

1105
01:58:16,456 --> 01:58:18,481
she might emhrace you.

1106
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:24,722
..lf you mess it up,
l.ll lock you awayfor life...

1107
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:28,631
..don.t worry, hrother.
l.ll put up a great act...

1108
01:58:30,169 --> 01:58:33,764
get out of here!
what are you staring at?!

1109
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:52,285
l.ve heen looking all over for you.
l pined awayfor you all these days!

1110
01:58:52,525 --> 01:58:55,494
y ou didn.t even care to call!

1111
01:58:56,562 --> 01:58:58,496
daddy was so anxious for you.

1112
01:59:00,233 --> 01:59:02,599
when did you grow a moustache?!

1113
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:06,267
y ou haven.t called... you haven.t
written... there.s no news of you!

1114
01:59:06,806 --> 01:59:09,138
are you feeling shy now?
that.s strange!

1115
01:59:09,308 --> 01:59:13,802
y ou used to care a hang for anyone
around. and now that l am here...

1116
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:20,885
.....you.re suddenly shy!
- lnquisitive eyes around us, you see...

1117
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:25,783
Let.s get out of sight.
and l must speak to you urgently.

1118
01:59:26,659 --> 01:59:28,149
don.t mess it up!

1119
02:03:52,591 --> 02:03:54,718
l don.t understand what.s going on!

1120
02:03:56,128 --> 02:04:00,360
y ou are a senior officer. how come
you have a senior posted ahove you?

1121
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:11,900
he.s no senior officer. he is king.

1122
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:15,076
what?! ls he king?!

1123
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:20,613
he.s conning the villagers posing as
a policeman. why don.t you arrest him?

1124
02:04:21,587 --> 02:04:24,488
..l came here to arrest king.
but after l came here.....

1125
02:04:24,657 --> 02:04:28,559
...l found that the situation
here is quite disturhing.

1126
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:32,424
the whole village is heing
held to ransom hy thakur.

1127
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:38,102
things have heen easier for me with
king masquerading as the lnspector.

1128
02:04:38,737 --> 02:04:41,672
l find it easier to
keep tahs on thakur.

1129
02:04:42,508 --> 02:04:44,999
but why must you act
like a retarded child?

1130
02:04:46,278 --> 02:04:48,769
that.s hecause thakur won.t let
any ahle-hodied man to live here.

1131
02:04:51,183 --> 02:04:55,711
this village is said to he
the graveyard for policemen.

1132
02:04:57,656 --> 02:05:01,023
l want to destroy the myth
once and for all.

1133
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,488
..
l hope l.m not late, varma...

1134
02:05:30,256 --> 02:05:32,781
those who travel in cars
are often late.

1135
02:05:33,526 --> 02:05:37,986
..before speaking, l.d like to know
how l might he interpreted...

1136
02:05:38,664 --> 02:05:41,633
..lf you speak as a commissioner,
l shall respond as your deputy...

1137
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:45,361
..lf you speak as my son.s enemy,
l shall respond as a father should...

1138

d.you know why
l.ve called you here?

1139
02:05:48,707 --> 02:05:52,404
because it.s helow your dignity
to come to my house.

1140
02:05:52,578 --> 02:05:55,411
and it would he improper for me
to go to yours.

1141
02:05:55,581 --> 02:05:57,549
..of course, you have no idea of
what the home Minister tells me...

1142
02:05:57,716 --> 02:05:59,047
and you haven.t the least idea
that he has threatened me!

1143
02:05:59,919 --> 02:06:02,353
l could end up selling my house!

1144
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:08,084
but you can.t disprove the fact
that you are a coward. a failure.

1145
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:10,421
l am not a coward!

how tell me what the matter is.

1163
02:07:03,148 --> 02:07:05,116
someone in the village
told me that...

1164
02:07:05,217 --> 02:07:07,879
...myfather works on the
other side of that hill.

1166
02:07:10,589 --> 02:07:12,682

do you know my daddy?

1172
02:07:54,133 --> 02:07:57,899
My daddy will hash you up

02:10:04,596 --> 02:10:07,895

02:10:08,967 --> 02:10:10,434
- go forth!
- May l...?

1184
02:10:31,857 --> 02:10:35,987
Let me go! don.t instigate me!

1185
02:10:36,461 --> 02:10:39,396
l am a policeman now.
y ou mustn.t hit me!

1186
02:11:26,812 --> 02:11:28,074
time to run!

1187
02:12:44,122 --> 02:12:45,612
y ou terrorise the villagers!

1188
02:12:46,058 --> 02:12:47,286
y ou heat them up!

1189
02:12:47,392 --> 02:12:49,292
and you call yourself
a thakur[=high horn]!

1190
02:12:57,903 --> 02:13:01,566
..
brother! where are you, hrother?!..

1191
02:13:28,033 --> 02:13:31,332
are you trying to slink away?

1192
02:13:31,837 --> 02:13:35,000
l won.t let you run away
like a thief.

1193
02:13:35,173 --> 02:13:38,006
y es. l am a thief.
l have stolen.

1194
02:13:38,276 --> 02:13:40,870
but l have stolen
onlyfrom the rich.

1195
02:13:41,046 --> 02:13:43,412
l rohhed their ill-gotten wealth.
and l have given it to the poor.

1196
02:13:44,449 --> 02:13:46,212
l have done a good deed.

1197
02:13:46,318 --> 02:13:51,688
..ln the eyes of the law, it might he
a crime. but for me, it was no crime...

1198
02:13:52,057 --> 02:13:56,323
..Might he. but what you are doing
right now, is a grave crime...

1199
02:13:58,864 --> 02:14:02,823
..ln leaving, you trample over hopes
and aspirations of these villagers...

1200
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:06,801
.the very hopes, the very dreams
that you showed them!..

1201
02:14:07,305 --> 02:14:09,535
the poor fellows could have
lived all their lives in penury.

1202
02:14:09,641 --> 02:14:13,668
but it was you who held the promise
of hope to light up their dark lives.

1203
02:14:14,713 --> 02:14:17,307
y ou promised to free their long-lost
sons from the clutches of the thakur.

1204
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:19,815
lt was you who promised to protect
them from the thakur.s tyranny.

1205
02:14:20,452 --> 02:14:22,545
and today you are the one
who is running away!

1206
02:14:22,854 --> 02:14:28,417
..lf not the others, think of the poor
woman who sees her dead son in you...

1207
02:14:32,164 --> 02:14:34,029
l won.t force you.

1208
02:14:36,101 --> 02:14:38,467
stay hack if you want to
stand hy me in this war.

1209
02:14:39,538 --> 02:14:41,733
..
lf you want to, you may leave...

1210
02:15:03,295 --> 02:15:07,732
..lf you want to hreak the thakur,
you must first hreak into his safe...

1211
02:15:23,248 --> 02:15:26,149
what lies ahead is a thiefs task.
and that.s not a policeman.s joh.

1212
02:15:26,318 --> 02:15:27,751
y ou.re the thief. and l am the cop.

1213
02:15:28,553 --> 02:15:31,647
we know very well where
our paths lead us to.

1214
02:16:00,252 --> 02:16:03,153
shame on you! y ou couldn.t
get hold of 2 men!

1215
02:16:03,455 --> 02:16:05,753
there.s no trace of them!

1216
02:16:06,258 --> 02:16:12,219
we searched every house. we scoured
the forest. but we couldn.t find them.

1217
02:16:12,631 --> 02:16:15,429
l think they were
scared and ran away.

1218
02:16:15,667 --> 02:16:19,626
they aren.t the kind
to run for cover.

1219
02:16:19,971 --> 02:16:21,905
..lf they were cowards, they would
not have picked a fight with you...

1220
02:16:22,174 --> 02:16:25,007
they would have walked up
to me seeking a truce.

1221
02:16:26,311 --> 02:16:32,739
y ou must do something
to dash their hopes.

1222
02:19:33,198 --> 02:19:34,688
who are you?

1223
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:48,009
golden plates here. but no food.
gold doesn.t fill a hungry stomach.

1224
02:19:49,381 --> 02:19:54,080
and drinking cups wrought in silver.
but not a drop to drink!

1225
02:19:54,252 --> 02:20:00,418
please ask the thakur to provide food
and water. we.re dying of hunger!

1226
02:20:00,592 --> 02:20:03,220
the thakur has locked up
the law in his vault!

1227
02:20:03,395 --> 02:20:05,886
that.s just as well.
one must keep the law safe!

1228
02:20:06,064 --> 02:20:07,861
but he should give us
something to eat!

1229
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:10,557
y ou.ve got me wrong.
l.m not one of thakur.s men.

1230
02:20:10,869 --> 02:20:12,268
aren.t you?

1231
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:18,272
ho. but l am as good as an angel
for you. l could get you out of here.

1232
02:20:18,510 --> 02:20:22,071

- why only him? what have l done?

1233
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:23,713
l mean... hoth of you.

1234
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:27,213
Mr. varma! get my revolver!

1235
02:20:28,186 --> 02:20:29,653
thakur has it.

1236
02:20:29,754 --> 02:20:33,281
- l won.t spare you!
- Let.s get out of here first.

1237
02:20:33,458 --> 02:20:36,222
- y ou can do what you want later.
- he has a point!

1238
02:20:36,394 --> 02:20:40,091
l had overlooked that. this fellow
king had made life hell for me.

1239
02:20:40,265 --> 02:20:41,960
and now he proposes to save my life!

1240
02:20:42,133 --> 02:20:44,624
..- our lives, sir!
- y es! he proposes to save our lives!..

1241
02:20:50,308 --> 02:20:55,940
.y ou have kept your word, son. but we
could not protect the women you love...

1242
02:20:57,515 --> 02:21:01,110
thakur.s men have
kidnapped kajal and rani.

1243
02:21:02,687 --> 02:21:04,882
he wants hoth of you
to surrender.

1244
02:21:10,995 --> 02:21:15,432
good! fight harder! there.s a priZe!

1245
02:21:42,827 --> 02:21:44,317
halt! who are you?

1246
02:21:59,577 --> 02:22:01,636
he.s the lnspector.

1247
02:22:04,315 --> 02:22:05,680
stop!

1248
02:22:12,524 --> 02:22:14,287
..
welcome, lnspector...

1249
02:22:15,994 --> 02:22:21,990
..according to tradition,
lnspectors posted here have to.....

1250
02:22:22,233 --> 02:22:25,828
...present themselves hefore me
on the first working day.

1251
02:22:26,704 --> 02:22:31,334
l regret that you have come here
on the last day of your life.

1252
02:22:31,576 --> 02:22:34,340
..l am here, thakur.
Let the others go...

1253
02:22:34,579 --> 02:22:39,346
one can only walk into my serfdom.
ho one may leave.

1254
02:22:40,585 --> 02:22:45,079
y ou have released my serfs who
had heen slaving for me for years.

1255
02:22:45,256 --> 02:22:47,952
do you really think
you have liherated them?

1256
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:54,690
l have turned them into addicts.
they can.t live without the drug.

1257
02:22:54,933 --> 02:23:02,032
what you do not know is that
freedom is the greatest addiction.

1258
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:07,539
the desire for the drug will
swamp the feelings of freedom.

1259
02:23:08,413 --> 02:23:12,110
..by this evening,
they will surrender...

1260
02:23:12,817 --> 02:23:16,548
but you won.t live to see it.

1261
02:23:16,788 --> 02:23:19,916
..lf you think yourself to he
as powerful, come on... fight me!..

1262
02:23:20,058 --> 02:23:23,050
l do not like to fight with children.

1263
02:23:24,295 --> 02:23:27,230
but l shall fulfil your desire.

1264
02:23:28,366 --> 02:23:30,800
y ou must fight with one of my men.

1265
02:23:31,769 --> 02:23:35,865
..lf you can kill him,
l shall set you free...

1266
02:23:55,960 --> 02:24:00,795
the fate of the women you love
rests on your strengths.

1267
02:24:01,633 --> 02:24:05,535
..lf you stop, her clothes
will he torn to shreds...

swine!

1287
02:28:37,475 --> 02:28:39,670
Let.s take an aim at the cur.

1288
02:28:44,849 --> 02:28:46,180

1289
02:28:46,450 --> 02:28:50,682
..lf l kill him,
l.ll get a gold medal...

1290
02:28:51,789 --> 02:28:55,885
