1
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,157
Mumbai.

2
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,493
Electric energy.And
the charm offrenzy.

3
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,558
Monsoon sweptstreets. Neon lights.
And impossibledreams.

4
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,169
Hearts carelessly
crushed under stilettos.

5
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,241
Career escalators
moving at break-neck speed.

6
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,568
Mumbai! Buzzing by day.
Pulsating bynight.

7
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,510
Where every young
woman can livethe...

8
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,378
...quintessential
free independentlife.

9
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,318
Thecity l adopted. And
the city that adopted me.

10
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,920
Thecity where l
struggled to find my feet.

11
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,850
Thecity where l
discovered who l was...

12
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,861
and began to dream about
where l wanted my life to go.

13
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,391
Brick bybrick l built mylife here.

14
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,524
And now with two weeks to
go for my 30th birthday...

15
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,865
...l finally feel likel'vearrived.

16
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,268
Nainal'm cooking for you tonight.

17
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,464
Not again, Rishabh!

18
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,809
Every girl fancies aboyfriend,
who could cook her ameal...

19
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,812
but you on the otherhand...

20
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,211
l am happy to order in!

21
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,940
l'm a low maintenancegirl.

22
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,616
That we'll know post marriage.

23
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,895
Lets figureout what babies eat.

24
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,958
Aren'twejumping thegun, Mr. Puri?

25
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,758
Can't wait...

26
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,647
So ifyou ask me... don't let
Jamieget thebetter of you.

27
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:48,784
Your campaign's going to rock!
Stop trusting people so easily.

28
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,385
Just see people for
what theytruly are.

29
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,685
Pass metheoliveoil please.

30
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,259
That's thewrong recipe.
You can't heat olive oil.

31
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,989
Trust me... when it comes to
cooking food, and managing money.

32
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,791
The onlytwo things you can do right.

33
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,460
Really, andwriting poetry?

34
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,267
Correction. Writing bad poetry.
And singingterribly.

35
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,472
Obviously, you'renot going to marry
a boring banker boynow, are you?

36
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,277
lt's also becausel'm also a chef,
apoet and a singer...

37
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,009
...that works in my favour.

38
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,286
lt does... doesn'tit?

39
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,667
Hey, Cheers Naina!

40
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,796
Hey Rachna!

41
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,669
Hey! Comehere... let
me pour you aglass.

42
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,536
What's theexcitement all about?

43
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,672
Aha... the Bru campaign!

44
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,409
We'vewon the silver
lion at Cannes for it.

45
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,541
Wow!

46
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,018
Jamie is goingto France ...
to accept the award.

47
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,957
-Heywhere's your glass? -My glass?

48
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,092
Cheers is never enough.

49
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,037
Hey!
- Cheers.

50
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,836
-Aren't you happy? -Of course!

51
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,179
Looks like they didn't enter
your nameas thecopywriter.

52
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,461
You know thatJamieand l
both worked on this campaign.

53
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,588
lt's his baby...

54
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,927
And he was making no headway...

55
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,864
till l was roped in.
And l crackedtheidea.

56
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,199
You know Jamie's stand
on this issue!

57
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,940
Anyway, itwas Rathorewho sent
in theentry. So it's his call.

58
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,600
Weall know why Rats would do that.

59
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,735
Naina please...

60
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,869
Don't Naina me.

61
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,013
Now... Naina calm down... leave
all thebitchingto old Jamie.

62
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,486
Fuck OffJamie!
You shouldtake the award for...

63
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,814
...themost ethical copywriter.

64
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,752
Let's face it. l do havean edge...

65
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,757
Bull shit!
What you have is atool...

66
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,883
that you give out on hire.

67
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,554
Well who says it doesn't
help to swing both ways, honey?

68
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,164
Theold man Ogilvyhimself said,

69
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,898
''Thereare very few men of
genius in advertising agencies.

70
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,766
But weneed all wecan find.

71
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:03,034
Almost without exception they are
disagreeable. But don't destroythem.

72
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:07,511
They lay golden eggs.'' Eggs
of gold Naina... Eggs ofgold ''.

73
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,104
But Mr. Golden Goose,
Ogilvy also says,

74
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,776
''Our business is
infestedwith idiots who try...

75
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,716
...and impress using
pretentious jargon.''

76
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,846
Hey Naina, saw your U'va
hoarding campaign in the morning...

77
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,517
amazing, really eye-catching stuff!

78
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,184
So Jamie, do you want to
take credit forthat as well?

79
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,526
No honey, U'vais all yours.

80
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,533
You can have all the Golden Lions
andtheircubs and brouhaha with it.

81
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,002
We've lost the contract, again.

82
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,865
Becausewehaven't
upgraded ourmachinery.

83
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,540
Why is itso difficult
to upgradethemachinery?

84
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,545
l mean, you're
losing so much business...

85
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,671
...becauseofoutdated
infrastructure right?

86
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,545
You need a lot ofcapital...

87
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,550
l'm telling dadto
takea loan but...

88
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,551
with the recession and returns
to the investmentbeing so low...

89
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,883
...its not feasible

90
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,687
But l'm sure there's something
else that wecan do. l mean...

91
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,027
threebig factories...
a sheer waste.

92
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,833
Arethings really that bad?

93
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,571
Worse!

94
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,168
And l feel so helpless, you know.

95
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,312
l'm busy making money forthebank.
And doing nothing for my family.

96
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,584
Don't beso hard on yourself.

97
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,917
You havea right to do
what you enjoy doing.

98
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,056
lsn't your car due for servicing?

99
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,129
Yes baby...take it next week.

100
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,656

101
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,330

00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,069

00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,599
Goodnight baby.

104
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,729
-Bye. -Bye!

105
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,950

Turned back halfway.

106
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,216

00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,147
Did you just call mea fuddy-duddy?

156
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,823
Well, you're not a style icon!

157
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,752
Neither am l a fashion disaster.

00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:22,161
But you've got this
boring-serious-corporate-typelook.

00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,246
stylist or something.

167
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,324
Hey, l enjoy fashion.

168
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,325
Butl don't want to
do it professionally.

169
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,928
A lot ofmy friends are
designers or opening stores...

170
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,396
So what do you want to do?

171
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,127
Someserious, hardcorebusiness.

172
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,334
Dad's told me to figure
it out, he's willing to...

173
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,530
...invest oncel'vedecided.

174
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,867
lnteresting!

175
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,479
You know... l didn't
want to comeback.

176
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,879
l wantedto chill in
New York fora few years.

177
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,941
Why didn't you?

178
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,146
My parents wanted meback.

179
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,415
And family matters to me
more than anything else.

180
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,824
l'd do anythingto
see mom and dad happy.

181
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,088
That's pretty surprising...
l mean, look at me,

182
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,490
l'm just doing my own thing,

183
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,901
l'm least bothered about
whatmy family expects from me.

184
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,230
So in your mind, what you wantand...

185
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,104
...what your family wants,
are two differentthings...

186
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,167
Aren't they?

187
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,904
Maybe not...

188
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,852
Your girlfriend?

189
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,917
Yeah...

190
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:56,985

191
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,594
lt's okay. l'll call back.

192
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,595
You'rebeing abad boy!

193
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,596
Am l? And are you agood girl?

194
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,602
l wouldn't bethe
best judgeofthat...

195
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,275
What does your boyfriend feel?

196
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,139
lfl was dating somebody...

197
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,544
l wouldn't behere, right?

198
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,481
So you're giving me
lessons in moral science?

199
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,212
No. l am just
announcingthat l'm single...

200
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,019
You'renotthinking ahead, Rishabh!

201
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,890
Business, family... You need

202
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:37,901
But you will only do as

Look l'm not denying any ofthat...
but things have changed.

00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,464
So how long have
you been seeing her?

243
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,672
l've not been seeing her Naina.

244
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,070
Yeah... right!

245
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,747

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,715
No, obviously it doesn't mean
you haveto look for anew guy.

272
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,380
No...

273
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,582
l know mom it'll become more
difficult oncel turn 30...

274
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,217
but l'm turning 30 in a week!

275
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,292
Yes, l know that the astrologer
said it could happen anytimenow...

276
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,836
but he's been sayingthat for years!

277
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,807
Okay mom, l have to go...
l am getting late forwork.

278
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,776
Yes... and l'm absolutely fine.

279
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,972
Thereis no need for you to flyto
Bombay. Yes! l am absolutelyfine.

280
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,884
Yes...okaymom bye, love you!

281
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,393

when hebreaks up with you...

282
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,493
but says,thathe still
loves you and always will?

283
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,461
lfhemeans what he's saying...

284
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,771
...why would he break up
with you in the first place?

285
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,574
ls it just a way ofmaking you
feel better about being dumped?

286
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,441
Or is there a faint
possibilitythat hemay comeback...?

287
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,357
TheSales of U'va
haveactually fallen.

288
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,795
l mean this campaign
is a total disaster.

289
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,931
We'rethelaughing stock of
theentire magazine industry.

290
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,772
We needto withdraw
all our ads, immediately!

291
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,033
Andwehaveto cancel
our contract with ADZ.

292
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,369
No! Seeweunderstand...

293
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,977
and wetake full
responsibility forthe loss.

294
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,050
And l'll puta new
creativeteam on U'va.

295
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,382
Giveus a chanceto come
up with an alternative.

296
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,044
l'm sorry, but we'retaking
this brandto another agency.

297
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,830
Naina, would you
stay back fora minute?

298
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:51,960
You'refired!

299
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,837
What? l'm fired because
the campaign has bombed?

300
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,073
lt was an important campaign.
lt's an insult.

301
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,874
We've lost facein the industry.

302
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,742
Oh and fortherecord...

303
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,506
this is the first time in
history of our agency that...

304
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,083
we've lost such a
high profilecampaign!

305
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,510
l still stand bythe
fact that it's agreat idea.

306
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,418
And it can happen to thebest ofus.

307
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,514
Sometimes ideas work
and sometimes they don't.

308
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,494
And you know that theidea was
pre-tested and everybody approved...

309
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,620
including you.

310
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,694
l agree. But as...
the creativehead...

311
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,097
it is your responsibility.

312
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,036
lt is myresponsibility. But
you can't fireme forthis!

313
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,103
lt hasn't worked, we'll try again.

314
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,564
There's no again, Naina.

315
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,669
You know, you haven't a clue
ofwhatworks forthe youth.

316
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,905
You don't have
apulseon the segment.

317
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,438
And yourthinking is...

318
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,506
too out-of-the-box.

319
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,517
And itis exactlymy
'out-of-the-box thinking ...

320
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,677
... that got us
the award at Cannes...

321
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,379
forwhich ofcourse,
l'm getting no credit!

322
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,514
You've got amonth...

323
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,118
find yourselfa new job.

324
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,466
Of coursel'm fine... l know
logicallywhy he wants to marry her.

325
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,437
She's rich as hell,
heiress to agoldmine...

326
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,009
andthen she's young and
ithelps that she's so hot.

327
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,134
His family gets themoney...

328
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,610
... his parents arehappy and
he gets himself atrophywife.

329
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,078
lt's thewhole package that works!

330
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,709
God knows how long
he's been planning this.

331
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,415
l don't think hewas
seeing her beforethis...

332
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,679
...but we can check if you like.

333
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,483
-That's notthepoint...
-What's thepoint?

334
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,717
Thesolution to one
man is another man.

335
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,090
With God's grace,we'll soon
find another guy for Naina.

336
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,956
Ruksana... there's
moreto life than men!

337
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,897
What do you want us to
do for your birthday?

338
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,659
l don'tknow... whatever, anything!

339
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,898
30 is notjust any age
you know, it's special!

340
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,508
You'renota genius if you
haven't proved it by 30.

341
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,904
-l think 35 is the
new 30...-40, l think.

342
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,811
lt's killing me... l can't
believe Rishabh would do this to me.

343
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,518
And l keep thinking of
Rishabh and Yamini together.

344
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,522
And to top it up l'm
turning 30, fucking hell!

345
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,519
Jobless and man-less!

346
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,960
Naina, l'm 30, l'm not married...
it's no big deal, seriously.

347
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,828
Not everyone's as crazy as you.

348
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,663
l would have died ifl was
turning 30 and l wasn't married yet.

349
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,469
Thankfully Sahil and l got
married at theright time.

350
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,198
Check.

351
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,556
To cheer meup..

352
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,559
..Ruksana's husband Sahil took
thethree ofus outto dinner.

353
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,497
Sahil is a sweetheart.
And Ruksanais onelucky girl.

354
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,760
Some collegeromances
lasta lifetime.

355
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,577
As theevening
progressed l feltbetter.

356
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,809
At least for sometime. ln
this city friends are family.

357
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,794
Back home, it's lonely.
And l'm scared.

358
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,865
Butl'm going to put on
abrave front.

359
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,763
And hopefullytherain will ease...

360
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,584
Should l get you a drink?

361
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,212
No thanks.

362
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,751
l haven'tbeen ableto
organize yourstuff...

363
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,149
lt's okay.

364
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,821
-Should l help? -l'll manage.

365
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,693
-How far have you gonewith her?
-lt's none of your business Naina.

366
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,846
Stop it Naina...what are you doing?

367
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:21,856
So...

368
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,132
when did you first sleep with her?

369
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,067
Rishabh...

370
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,359
Naina...

371
00:28:58,803 --> 00:28:59,827
Yeah baby...

372
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,299
Oh yeah...

373
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,438
Stop!

374
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,241
l'm leaving!

375
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,116
She'll help out forthe
birthday party. lt's too much work!

376
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,419
Oh, you remember...
but there's no party.

377
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,355
You'll be30, right?

378
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,255
Don't cook meany dinner!

379
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,364
Rats can'tbeserious about
firing me. lt's probablyillegal.

380
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,268
He's pretty serious.
Check your contract.

381
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,032
And in case you've forgotten,
thereis a recession...

382
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,507
and weareplanning to downsize.

383
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,935
l'm goingto talk to Alfred.

384
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,980
Gettingthe New York officeinvolved
might notbethebest thing to do.

385
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,049
After all you don't want to
belabeled as atrouble maker.

386
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,378
l don't think l care.

387
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,010
Well start looking for your next job.
lf you can find one, that is.

388
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,055
Sagging huh?

389
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,793
Even minestartedto
hang when l hit 30.

390
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,869
All the firmness was gone. But
now l am saving fortheboob job.

391
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,938
l want to surprisemyhusband...
for ourwedding anniversary!

392
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,067
Wow!

393
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,538
Yours aren't that bad.

394
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,011
They'll last another 2-3 years.

395
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,813
And then, you'll also
haveto get it done...

396
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,545
to keep your husband happy.

397
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,890
You must bewhatnow... 30?

398
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,557
Turning 30 in fivedays.

399
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,827
Tension-tension, is it?

400
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,059
Well not really. l'm actually
quite okay aboutturning 30!

401
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,894
What's thebig deal? lt's
just another yeargoneby.

402
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,200
But you do need to settle down.

403
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,832
You know what, my cousin got a
perfect match on shaadi.com.

404
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,570
Veryhandsome guy, tall,
great body...

405
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,209
l could get you registered.
Justtell me... yourtype.

406
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,112
l was justtrying to help.

407
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,589
Every agencyis laying offpeople.
No oneis hiring.

408
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,295
But you can always try at...

409
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,095
Butl'll still only behired as
an AssociateCreative Director...

410
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:47,865
To be the National Creative
Director l'll haveto provemyself.

411
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,872
lt's not goingto be
easyhereeither.

412
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,534
After Anirban, Jamiewill
besitting on that chair...

413
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,236
But l can'tletthem just fireme!

414
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,604
Hey, Sahil! How're you doing?

415
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,073
Hi...

416
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,207
This is Shalini. Wework together.

417
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,219
This is Sahil, my friend Ruksana's
husband. Why don't you join us?

418
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,219
You guys carry on... l
will catch up with you later.

419
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,482
Okay.

420
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,974
Hi this is Rishabh Puri. l'm sorry

So that's it...

424
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,314
Rishabh never called meback and
l justkept waiting andwaiting.

425
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,983
Talkingto me is not
going to kill him right?

426
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,993
l don't know...like
why he's being so weird.

427
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,654
Focus on shopping. No more
talk of Rishabh or your job.

428
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,394
What the fuck is this?

429
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,939
You'returning 30... you need
new lingerie! Quickly now...

430
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,600
Wonder Bra!

431
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,006

432
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,137

your birthday present!

434
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,032

Heyit's looking lovely. Anywaythe
solution to abreakup is ahaircut.

We've got somegreat vibrators

439
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,379
..ifyou're interested...

440
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,382
Does itlook like
l'm not getting any action?

441
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,579
ls it written on my face?!

442
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,588
Just felt like you needed it..
..normallyl know

443
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,590
when someone's deprived.

444
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,059
Middle-aged housewives,
30 plus working ladies...

445
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,722
Just onelook, and l can tell.

446
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:55,333
What on earth is a pussy pamperer?

447
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,595
What on earth is a pussy pamperer?

448
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,363
Wouldn'tknow honey...
Sahil is my pussy pamperer!

449
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,998
Guess it's a device for
thelesser privileged..

450
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,505
..celibatespinsters likeme.

451
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,632
Shutup!

452
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,074
That reminds me, l saw him at
Prithvi. Didn't hetell you?

453
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,073
Really? Who was hewith?

454
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,272
Somechick.

455
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,142
Are you okay Ruks?

456
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,079
What happened?

457
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,247
lt's been on for eight months.

458
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,590
She was a... part ofhis work thing.

459
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:29,293
Shewas firstan intern and then,
she is apart ofhis team now...

460
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,030
l've just been ignoring it.
You know how itis!

461
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,039
l keep pretending it's not happening.

462
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,338
You should talk to him Ruks.
Have you tried?

463
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,304
You know seeingthetwo of
you together...

464
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,439
l would never have believed it.

465
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,041
You guys arelike
theperfect couple.

466
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,420
Are all dreams justillusions?

467
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:02,132
ls marriage really so
fragile arelationship?

468
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,234
Then why do wecovetit so much?

469
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,432
Sahil or Rishabh.
Thestory is the same.

470
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,206
Younger women just
seem to be more desirable.

471
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,076
Have soul and substance, depth
and commitment ceasedto matter?

472
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,206
Maybereal women likeus need real
men... and that is arare species.

473
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,478
96.1 Fun FM. Hi,this is Rahul!

474
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,610
Good morning...

475
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,349
This show is
especially for you youngsters,

476
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,756
may you be forever young,
make the most of your youth!

477
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:33,095
So calling out to all those who
arestill in theirtwenties...

478
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:35,563
Do you wakeup alone every morning?

479
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,730
Are you looking for your soul mate?

480
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:48,707
Forget abouttherest... Findthe
love of your lifeon, tietheknot.com.

481
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,409
lt's an account we've
gotwithout pitching.

482
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,474
We'veto launch the
Celebrate Women Spa chain .

483
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,449
lt's specifically
aimed at middle-agedwomen.

484
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,489
So that means you've
decided not to fire me.

485
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,854
lt also means that you don't
getthe New York officeinvolved.

486
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,427
lfthat's thecase, let mechoose
theaccounts l want to work on.

487
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,322
You don'thave a choice Naina.

488
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,625
lf you'rewilling to
work on this brand...

489
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,324
you stay.

490
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,458
lfnot, you leave.

491
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,863
Let's face it. You're not really
up to handling abig youth brand.

492
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,804
And this,
is a small-budget campaign.

493
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,171
lt's not very complicated.

494
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,369
Maybeit's betterto befired.

495
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,208
Theball's in your court.
Heybythewaynice hair-cut!

496
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,837
So got anew hair cut?

497
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,244
Didn't expect to see you here.

498
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,582
Where's Yamini?

499
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,382
Well shewas busy.

500
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,783
So how... how's work?

501
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,261
l've been great...work's great!

502
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,194
So when are you comingto
pick up therest of your stuff?

503
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,729
No, that's not necessary...

504
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,532
just discard it.

505
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,807
Just discard the stuff, he says.

506
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,778
Justas hehas discarded me,
and our relationship.

507
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,480
But l can't discard my feelings.

508
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,546
l want Rishabh back... desperately!

509
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:39,288
Everything's a burning crisis...
my lovelife, work,

510
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,347
and even Ruksana's marriage.

511
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,787
l'm pregnant.

512
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,556
Have you told Sahil?

513
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,765
lt'll help us start afresh.

514
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,230
And suddenly all my
problems with Sahil...

515
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,965
... don'tseem that
important anymore.

516
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,243
l also wantto havea child.

517
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,738
My career is heading nowhere.

518
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,371
Maybemotherhood is my truecalling!

519
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,245
Then you betterdo it fast honey.

520
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,284
Your biological clock
is ticking away.

521
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,454
Heis from Wharton business school.
Settled in Mumbai.

522
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,723
Seems quite good looking...
familylives in Delhi!

523
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,987
Helikes art, literature, music...

524
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,859
Mom, get alife!

525
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,994
Your friends are
having children Naina...

526
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,866
and your boyfriends areflaky.

527
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,005
Do you wantto spend the
rest ofyour lifealone?

528
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,809
You need to get
serious about marriage.

529
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,272
l'll think aboutit when l'm ready.

530
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,672
Your papa and l are
not getting any younger.

531
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,577
Who will look afteryou?

532
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,744
God forbid, if something
wereto happen to us...

533
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:43,877
My friends!

534
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,957
Notifthey'rebusy
with their babies!

535
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,488
This one is nice.

536
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,494
Nainal've alreadytold you,
l'm notinterested in thestuff.

537
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,664
Listen l think it's best ifwe
stay out of each other's lives.

538
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,703
And there is nothing
to talk about Naina.

539
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,484
Bastard... doesn't
even want to talk to me.

540
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,445
Three years...

541
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,522
three years ofmy life l've
invested in this relationship.

542
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,056
Somewomen make great girlfriends.

543
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,532
Butthey're justnot
good enough for marriage.

544
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,559
l am oneofthem.

545
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,061
No, please don't cry baby.

546
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,472
Mothers and daughters have
intriguing relationships.

547
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,407
Arvind is alawyer,
just back from New York.

548
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,742
And mom has got herway... again!

549
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,815
-Bye. -Byeaunty.

550
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,684
Arvind, honestly... l'm
not readyto getmarried.

551
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,088
l'm doing this just to
givemom somepeaceofmind.

552
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,653
She's been insisting.

553
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,487
-Hey, l'm so glad to
hearthat!-Really?

554
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,656
You know what? l'm
already dating somebody.

555
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:06,425
The thing is, she's African-American,
so mum's not readyto accept her.

556
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,437
And l wantto settledown with her.

557
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,770
So, l'm here justto
pleasemum and aunt Rita.

558
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,366
So, you bettertell your mum...

559
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,808
... you thoughtl wasn't
suitable and ''reject'' me.

560
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,504
She's notgoing to buythat.

561
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,842
You haveto do something!

562
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,109
Just say ''Arvind isn't good enough.''

563
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,510
Still better ''Arvind
is aloose character!''

564
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,586
So that's how l rejected
Arvind and mom's goneback to Delhi.

565
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,555
You and your mother areboth crazy.
You should havehit on him...

566
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,823
even ifhe was half decent.

567
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,598
Please Ruksana,
whereare your ethics?

568
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,400
Anyway,
l'm still hung up on Rishabh.

569
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,463
Ladies and gentlemen,

570

Jai,who?

581
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,071
How many'Jais' do we know? The
one and only, college sweetheart!

582
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,038
Crazy orwhat? Last l heard he

583
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,110
-Hi...-How're you? -Hi...

00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,439

585
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,447
-Hi.-Hi.

586
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,743
What are you doing here?

587
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,515
Well, my exhibition's on next hall.

588
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,459
Yourwork has becomeeven better.

589
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,627
l'll believeit, if
you buy one Ruksana!

590
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,457

591
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,057
-Take...take your pick. -All!

592
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,897
This is stunning... it's beautiful.

593
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,836
So you'reback in our city for good?

594
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,136
lf your city wants me.

595
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,480
l havea few exhibitions here,
so let's seehow it goes.

596
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,645
And l think l'm donewith London.

597
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,148
They'reso perfect together,
aren't they?

598
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,488
-You saythat about every man
Nainahas been with...-Shut up.

599
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,027
So that's it! My
career is in the doldrums...

600
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,222
and Rishabh has leftmeto
havean arranged marriage...

601
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,498
That pretty much sums up my life.
l still haven't quite ''made it.''

602
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,898
So that's your idea ofmaking it?

603
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,503
Marrying arich,
smart, eligible guy and...

604
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,099
creatingwaves in theadworld...

605
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,974
Pretty clear cutand simplel'd say.

606
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,609
Pretty conventional
and boring l'd say.

607
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,513
So you think l'm
unconventional and interesting?

608
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,047
You'll haveto letmefind out.

609
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,519
Andwhywould l do that?

610
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,185
Because, you could do with some...

611
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,519
More beer!

612
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,984
Cheers!

613
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,534
So you think it's okay
that l haven'tmade it?

614
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,527
Well l think it's great
that you haven't madeit!

615
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,929
Andwhat about you?
Have you madeit?

616
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,599
The avant gardephotographer,
therestless traveller.

617
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,274
Have you found what
you'relooking for?

618
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,074
Well l'vealways said
it's aboutthejourney...

619
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,278
So are you travelingwith someone?

620
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,786
As amatterof fact,
yes l am... with mybeer!

621
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,079
Cheers to that! Bottoms Up!

622
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,291
Good morning...

623
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:23,925
Teais ready.

624
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:30,196
Naina... wake up!

625
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,074
Whatever your reasons
are formarrying Yamini...

626
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:16,743
frankly l don't care. l still
love you and l want you back.

627
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,841
Call off your engagement.

628
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,817
l'vemade a decision.
And l'm sticking byit.

629
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,348
We're through.

630
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,831
Don'tmake this harder than itis.

631
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,314
You know... it's tough
for meas well.

632
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,982
l'm livingwith the guilt of,
having let you down...

633
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,182
but what else could l do?

634
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,200
Please bestrong and mature
and understand.

635
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,733
Wenever reallyhad a future.

636
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,362
We do... you just don't
want to give ita chance.

637
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,742
Hi, listen
tomorrow's the 28th, remember?

638
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,287
So you have to tell us
whetheryou'redoing..

639
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,754
..thespa campaign or quitting.

640
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,816
l will let you know.

641
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,761
Everyone grows up with fairytales.

642
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,356
lmagining magic
wands and happy endings.

643
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,997
l'm turning 30.

644
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,065
Aloneand out ofwork.

645
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,365
This is never how
it was meant to be.

646
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,771
l guess it's timeto stop
believing in fairytales.

647
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,177
My 30th birthdayis
going to betheworst ever!

783
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,954
About sinking into yourdimples.

784
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,721
How much have you had to drink, Jai?

785
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,966
Naina l know l walked out
of your life.

786
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,362
But l also know that
l was immature.

787
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,433
l didn't know where l was headed,
didn't know what to do with you.

788
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,368
Financiallyinsecure.

789
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,904
l mean for a guy at 26
spendingtherest of your life...

790
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,777
...with onewoman can be scary.

791
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,748
l was afraid of commitment.

792
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,388
You're veryhigh... veryhigh Jai.

793
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,683
Will you just listen to me.

794
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,524
lt was four years ago...

795
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,719
so much has happened since then.

796
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:13,887
lt doesn't reallymatter.

797
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,125
ltmatters to me.

798
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,799
l realized what an idiot l had been.

799
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,998
But you werealready
with Rishabh bythen.

800
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,414
And l thought l had no right.

801
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,140
And now you do?

802
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,551
Well l thought l lost my chance...

803
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,522
but life throws you a second
chance when you least expect it.

804
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,615
That doesn't answer my question.

805
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,428
Well Nainal never
stopped loving you.

806
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,066
Andwhen l saw you yesterday...

807
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,504
-it just took meback to... -Jai.

808
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,513
Will you marry me?

809
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,506
M'am the door is locked inside.

810
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,648
Lalita, come back later...

811
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,774

00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,750
What's with all this hotlingerie?

814
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:26,584
What to do? One has to do all
this to trick men into bed now...

01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,297
l'm still waiting
for you to say yes.

819
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,635
Just becausel slept with you,
doesn't mean l want to marry you.

820
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,200
That used to bemyline.

821
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,300
l'm not tryingto get
back at you or anything.

822

01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,785
-Two minutes.-Two minutes.

Thank you. l'm sure you know Jai.

864
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,768
Rishabh
- Jai...

865
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,863
Jai
- Rishabh... Rishabh- Jai.

866
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,737
Congratulations!! -Thank you.

867
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,807
So where's the young,
gorgeous brideto be?

868
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,140
Yamini!

869
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,477
Yes?

870
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:12,815
-Hi! -Hi.

871
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,916
-Yamini that's Naina and Jai.

872
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:18,288
-Congratulations.
-Oh thank you so much...

873
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:19,418
l'm really happy...

874
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,295
l'm reallyhappy for you.

875
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,366
Oh! Let's seethis...
no that's thehand...

876
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:32,171
Butl must saythat Rishabh is quite
apain in theass... literally!

877
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,277
Sorry, lets go get anotherdrink...

878
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,039
Come on.

879
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,458
Why did you do that?

880
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:01,994
l don't know.

881
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,406
Drop me home.

882
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,484
l'm sorry...

883
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,891
andthank you for beingtheretoday.

884
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,508
l'll see you tomorrow...

885
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,011
l just need some timealone...

886
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,581
Good night.

887
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,602
Why do wealways want
themen who don't want us?

888
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,436
And neverwant the men who want us?

889
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,475
How can l still want Rishabh?

890
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,578
Why am l still trying?

891
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,955
And what on earth was l thinking
taking Jai for Rishabh's engagement?

892
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,619
Maybel justbelieve in miracles.

893
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,555
And l think l can turn back
theclock and rewritethe ending.

894
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,023
l don't know whatl'm doing.

895
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:41,569
And l can hardlytell the
differencebetween rightandwrong.

896
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,374
Targetted at middle agedwomen...

897
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,914
the aim ofthe
Celebrate Women spa chain...

898
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,644
is to revitalize and
rejuvenatewomen...

899
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,180
l think we've got thepicturehere.

900
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,649
So anyideas?

901
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,517
Not yet.

902
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:08,519
Okay... so Naina will presentthe
campaign idea atthenext meeting.

903
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,656
Okay.

904
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:12,992
Great!

905
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:01,981
l havea theorythatthebest
ads come from personal experience.

906
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,978
Someofthegood ones l
have done, havereally...

907
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,577
...comeout ofthereal
experienceofmy life.

908
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,656
And somehow this has comeover,
as true and valid and persuasive.

909
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,188
But real life is confusing
and nothing is black orwhite.

910
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,059
Ex-boyfriends are irresistible.

911
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,067
Rishabh is engaged to somebody else.

912
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:23,529
l'm 30.

913
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:27,073
And a onenight stand on the rebound
seems to beturning into manymore.

914
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,085
Basically the ideais to shoot
them going about their dailylives...

915
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:40,279
Wewanta peep into whattheir
normal everydaylifeis like.

916
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,283
As forthequestions
and interviews...

917
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,424
justgetthem to open up
with you and behonest.

918
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:50,021
Thereis no hard and fast
ruleabout the guidelines.

919
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:52,032
Just use your own
judgement and ask thequestions...

920
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:53,158
...that you feel areright...

921
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,759
and most importantly remember...

922
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,397
that we are looking
only attheSEC A...

923
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,237
ideally the SEC A
- 30 plus women...

924
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,777
So come on outthere...
go and have fun!

925
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,711
Hi... sorryl'm late.

926
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,708
l'vehad likethe
craziest day in office, today.

927
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,787
This spa campaign presentation
is driving meup thewall.

928
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:13,485
And to top it all l
just started chumming.

929
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,516
Poor baby. Thanks forcoming.

930
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,786
Thethings women go
through to producebabies!

931
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,527
Waittill you have yours.
lt's all worth it.

932
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,189
Where's Sahil?

933
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,527
Not coming, busy with work.

934
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,398
Don't worry. l'll manage.

935
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,069
l'm tired oftrying...

936
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,503
ifl'm not pregnant this time,

937
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,336
then l'm not going to take
anymorebloodyinjections.

938
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,809
At therateatwhich mylifeis going
l'll also haveto go in for lVF...

939
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,138
Any progress with Jai?

940
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,411
l'm okaywith justletting
things be thewaythey are but...

941
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,542
But?

942
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,214
l can'tbelieveJai actuallywants to
marry me. l feel he's notserious...

943
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,349
he'll run out on me, again.

944
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,562
Ofcoursehe's serious. You'rethe
onewho's not making up her mind.

945
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,163
l can't marry him justbecause l'm
30 and it's timeto getmarried.

946
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,596
And l'm scared of
test-tube babies...

947
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,226
You'renot still holding a
candle for Rishabh, are you?

948
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,494
Ruksana...?

949
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,136
The ifs and buts oflife.

950
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,837
Areall men essentiallymama's boys?

951
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,839
How well do wereally
know the men in our lives?

952
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,186
So how manywomen have you
been with since webrokeup?

953
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,848
Hardly any...

954
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,552
What's hardly any?

955
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,191
Three... if you insist.

956
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:36,670
Onehad somepotential, but the
othertwo were just timepass...

957
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,797
Basicallythings didn't
work out with any ofthem...

958
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,375
so you turned up at my doorstep...

959
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,467
...now that your parents
also want you to settledown.

960
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,480
Notlike your parents
don'twant you to settledown.

961
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,627
l found two moregrey
strands today...

962
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,227
Listen, l hope this evening
isn'ttoo tiring for you...

963
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,390
Chill. l am just two months pregnant.

964
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,524
l'm fine.

965
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,758
Where's Malini,
are wepicking her up?

966
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,294
She's coming by herself.

967
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:10,762
And Ramona?

968
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,664
She's not coming...

969
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,436
l just don'tget this
Malini and Ramonathing...

970
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,438
l don'tknow what to think.

971
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,578
l'm justamazed she
didn'ttell us all this while.

972
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,481
And like fools we're tryingto set
her up with oneguy after another.

973
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,713
Do l havelipstick on my teeth?

974
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,687
No... actually you do!

975
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,724
No,just kidding!

976
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,624

Maybeit's just apassing phase...

988
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,019
lt's not.

989
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,464
Maybe Ramona is like
influencing you.

990
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,366
lt's not like you'vehad
any experiencein thepast...

991
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:21,927
Or have you?

992
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,695
Of coursenot!

993
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,039
Otherwise
l would have known before...

994
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,436
What the...!

995
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,371
Besides l'm not the one
living a sham, Ruksana.

996
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:35,507
What?

997
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:38,313
-Whatis thatsupposed to mean?
-Ok guys chill... enjoy theshow!

998
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,428
Cheers!

999
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:27,429
Weshould have a club forwomen
over 50... to celebrate womanhood.

1000
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,560
Yes.

1001
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:31,537
Or a club for old
girls who need new lays...

1002
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,805
We're young at heart, you see!

1003
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,705
Greyhair, wrinkles,
sagging breasts...

1004
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,839
they are all signs
ofa life well lived.

1005
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,110
We'rematuring likewine...

1006
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,514
Now better marry this second boy.

1007
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,191
l am happythatJai has
proposed to memom. l do like him...

1008
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,464
l don't know about spending
therest ofmy life with him.

1009
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,468
lt's notthatsimple...

1010
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,096
l know l should forget Rishabh.
l'vereached office. Bye.

1011
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:13,598
l am still single,

1012
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,710
and a 30 year old single girl
is a big deal for my family.

1013
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,809
Everyonewanted me to get married.

1014
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,844
But nothingworked out.

1015
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:26,087
l felt terrible for 2-3
years after l turned 30.

1016
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,850
But life goes on and you
haveto accept yourself.

1017
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,687
Myhusband also lost
interest in me...

1018
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,153
after l turned 35.

1019
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,694
Now l am trying to
focus on my career.

1020
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,999
l am multi tasking all thetime.

1021
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,004
l need atleast 48 working
hours in a day.

1022
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,165
And l've lostmy sex drive.

1023
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,869
l wantedto learn music,
but where's the time?

1024
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,510
l am divorced and now in
anew relationship.

1025
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:53,513
l haveneverbeen happier.

1026
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:57,676
l justthink women need to let their
hair down and start having fun.

1027
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:05,559
Weshould havea club for all women
over 50... to celebrate womanhood.

1028
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:16,729
Oh my god! l haven't
donethis in ages.

1029
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:20,597
The last bikel rode
was yours in college.

1030
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:21,733

thewedding band.

1051

Are you advertising

''Errant photographer son
ofCivil Services' family...

1056
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,685

your parents to place that.

1057
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,881
l think it's agreat idea.
What say Ranjeet?

1058
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,356
Okay Naina. Go ahead and
makethepresentation.

1061
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,802
A place where shecan
connect with otherwomen...

1062
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,706
A placewhich is beyond
massages and aromatherapy.

1063
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,242
A placewherewhilesipping
juiceand getting acupressure...

1064
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,370
she can also havean art class,
or get investment advice.

1065
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,879

great brand equity!

1067
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,815
l think wehavea seed ofan
ideahere... lt might just work!

1068
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,313
Thank you Mr. Desai.

1069
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:18,726
That's fine. My only concern
is the budget, you know...

1070
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,121
Let me get back to you with
amoredetailed presentation.

1071
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,993
Copy, hoardings, TVC samples...

1072
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:27,091
the exact campaign plan, a
tentativemediaplan with costing.

1073
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,396
And you takea decision afterthat.

1074
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,399
Sounds good. And another thing...
don't worry about thecost.

1075
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:36,738
Wecamewith a small budgetbut now,
we are goingto do this in abig way.

1076
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,746
So we'relooking at the
inaugural budget of 100 crores...

1077
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,272
and an annual budget of 35.

1078
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,147
Wow! -That's great...

1079
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:48,246
lt's just that...

1080
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:51,223
l wish we had known
aboutthis earlier, you know.

1081
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:57,361
Jamiel didn'tknow. l really
didn't know. l swear to God.

1082
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,229
l didn't know it was
such abig campaign.

1083
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,098
-You didn't know? -Yeah.

1084
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,227
And l had my constraints.

1085
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,098
You know the New York office
would haveraised hell...

1086
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,231
had l fired her forthe U'va
campaign. You know that...

1087
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:07,706
Boo fucking hoo.

1088
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:11,239
That's when l realized a side
campaign would be the bestsolution.

1089
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,837
-l needthis brand. -l know!

1090
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,177
Listen, put her on something else...

1091
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:16,910
l can't. - This is your love?

1092
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,782
Oh pumpkin please understand.
- This is how you show me.

1093
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,719
Yeah! l sent you to Cannes...
didn't l?

1094
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:22,847
So what?

1095
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,721
-Oh c'mon! -What the hell!

1096
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,917
lt is temptingto giveup.

1097
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:28,989
But l must believe in myself...

1098
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:30,991
And l must believein my product...

1099
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,123
To my darling...

1100
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:34,395
who will one daymake
Ogilvy very proud!

1101
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,868
Love Rishabh.

1102
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,739
Somegifts areinvaluable
and timeless...

1103
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,470
Ogilvy has never failed me.

1104
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,003
Miss you Rishabh.

1105
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,084
What were you doing?

1106
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,352
Nothing really...

1107
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,093
What happened?

1108
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:11,767
Nothing.

1109
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,501
Tell me...

1110
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,442
How do you feel about me?

1111
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,519
Naina you can't keep
evading this issue.

1112
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,464
l mean it's not like weare
just sleepingtogether.

1113
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,458
l can understand you not
wantingto get married.

1114
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,531
Butl think, l deserveto
know how you feel aboutme.

1115
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,273
l really care about you Jai...

1116
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,137
l really do...

1117
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:58,346
But it's hard because l have
all this stuffin my head..

1118
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,545
..that l need to sort out...

1119
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,488
l just need some time.

1120
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,090
You'releading a doublelife...

1121
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,566
You'renotbeing fairtoJai.

1122
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:17,499
l'm not committedto Jai.

1123
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,903
Anyway, l'm not cheating on him...

1124
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,376
Maybenot physically...
but you are emotionally.

1125
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:29,241
l am messed up. l am on the rebound.

1126
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:31,377
AndJai knows that.

1127
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,115
l told him rightat the beginning...

1128
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,514
And hewalked into this
with his eyes wide open.

1129
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,918
But you can't expect
him to hang around...

1130
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,588
while you wait for Rishabh to
miraculously getback with you.

1131
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:47,530
He's engagedto Yamini. He's
not getting back with you.

1132
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,533
You just needto move on...

1133
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:52,864
Do you think it's
so easy to moveon?

1134
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,207
Am l supposedto just,
switch on and off?

1135
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,542
ls it so technical? lfnot Rishabh...
then just replace the guy?

1136
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,411
ln my head l was married
to Rishabh...

1137
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:02,949
Do you know how that feels?

1138
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,208
No...

1139
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:05,343
But it's over...

1140
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,619
You justhave to letgo...

1141
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,957
Letgo...? Why should l
let go ofwhat's mine?

1142
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:14,356
At work l'm expectedto let go.

1143
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,893
Put in all thehardwork
andtheeffort...

1144
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,898
and when it's time for awards
and promotions...

1145
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:20,629
l'm supposedto let go?

1146
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:26,103
l'veput in years ofmytimeand
effort into this relationship.

1147
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,502
and when the timecomes to
actually get married...

1148
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:31,441
the guyleaves me... and
l'm supposedto let go?

1149
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,444
l'm 30... not 22.

1150
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:38,645
Thetimeto letgo is over.

1151
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,316
Forgetit... you guys are
not goingto understand.

1152
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:43,982
Nobody does.

1153
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:57,327
l was sleepingwith Jai, but l was
still in lovewith Rishabh. So what?

1154
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:03,944
But then...Jai was getting hurt in
theprocess. And l couldn't help it.

1155
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,947
l realized l had reached
a pointin my life,

1156
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,676
wherenobodyin the world
understood me...

1157
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:13,412
notmy friends, not mymother,
notJai, not Rishabh.

1158
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,486
But then who has ever
really understood..

1159
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,150
..a woman's wounded
and broken heart?

1160
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,293
And who has ever known, how
long itwill taketo heal?

1161
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:24,695
l was truly alone.

1162
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,697
And it didn't matter anymore.

1163
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,388
Lights... roll camera... action!

1164
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,993
Hi, l am Rajni Sharma, l'm
38. l am a housewife...

1165
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:59,600
So this is little Naina working
hardto crack the big fish!

1166
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:00,725
Shouldn't l?

1167
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:02,660
l wouldn't ifl were you...

1168
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,729
You'd justgetsomebody else
to do it and takethe credit.

1169
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:07,598
Touchy!

1170
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,602
l don't know abouttouchy. The
''touch'' is definitely your forte.

1171
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,410
And he never recovered
from that insult...

1172
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:21,278
Listen,this is an auspicious
timeto get married.

1173
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,025
You needto decidenow.

1174
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:27,624
Or it'll be another four years.

1175
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:32,633
Anyway, the girl is unlucky.

1176
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,367
You came from Delhi to Mumbai...

1177
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:37,768
justto convinceme to marryJai...

1178
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,573
lt's been over amonth...

1179
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,039
sinceheasked you.

1180
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:44,043
And you still haven't
given him an answer!

1181
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,512
You can'tbe so busywith
your new campaign...

1182
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,048
that you don't have
timeto makesuch..

1183
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,583
..an important decision
in your life.

1184
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,709
l am busy.

1185
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,118
This is Malini's dream come true.

1186
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,114
Wow!

1187
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,248
Our Mal's a star!

1188
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,786
l just don't want her
to drift away from us.

1189
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,798
Yeah sheis really caught
up with that Ramona.

1190
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:07,793
Or maybewe'recreatingthe
distance... l don't know...

1191
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,472
Don't worry...we'll befine, we've
been together sincecollege!

1192
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:15,472
-Look who's on Page 3? -Who?

1193
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:24,743
She's just... she's just too thin
. Too thin... who is this thin?

1194
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,757
Okay no more lusting
afterthat jerk.

1195
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,444
That's great ma'am... spotlight's
on you, good show!

1196

This is brilliant!

1231
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:17,448
-Thank you.-But...

1232
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,786
theother idea...

1233
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:23,328
recommended by your agency head,
that's more viable.

1234
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,330
l think abetter way of
communicating..

1235
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:27,333
..our entry into the spa market.

1236
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,880
l guess therewas no need for
meto makethis presentation.

1237
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,746
The decision was already made.

1238
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:51,759
Rats obviously gotJamie to present
an alternativeto Celebrate.

1239
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,623
This timeto the CEO,who he had
already wined and dined...

1240
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:57,493
and l'm sureShalini
would haveknown.

1241
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:05,838
l am tired of your manipulative
games...

1242
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:06,964
Sit down.

1243
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:10,636
You'reactually saying something!

1244
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,370
You spineless bastard!

1245
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,708
All you can do is lick
their combined asses,

1246
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,908
whiletrying to keep
your position secure.

1247
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,044
We'll accept your resignation, okay!

1248
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,581
You mean you'll welcomeit.

1249
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:20,778
Whatever you think.

1250
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:23,652
Jamieis justusing you to get ahead
while you'velost your marbles...

1251
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,453
trying to appease your love
interest. Can't you see that?

1252
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,993
Listen, lets get on with
the formalities...

1253
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,325
because wecan do without
your ranting and raving.

1254
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:30,855
Fuck you all.

1255
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:32,794
You're justmissing atool honey!

1256
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,329
Yeah that's theone!

1257
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:43,807
Being impulsiveis underrated.

1258
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:46,342
l think thebest decisions
areoften the ones..

1259
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:48,347
..wetakeon the spur ofthemoment.

1260
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,346
But then sometimes the
biggestmistakes of ..

1261
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,011
..our lives aremade on impulse.

1262
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:57,614
Havel just madethebiggest
mistakeofmylife?

1263
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,356
Thrown awaymy chances atsuccess?

1264
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,421
lmpulse.

1265
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,095
ls that whyl'm with Jai...?

1266
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,966
ls that why Rishabh
is marrying Yamini?

1267
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,109
Aunty, don't you think what
you did to meis unfair?

1268
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,440
Unfair...?

1269
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:23,915
C'mon aunty, stop pretending.

1270
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:26,043
Till two months ago, Rishabh
was going to marryme.

1271
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,520
Then suddenly he dumps
me to marry Yamini.

1272
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:32,582
The decision was Rishabh's. We
don't interferein his life.

1273
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:35,992
Ofcourse you did. He was so upset
becauseof yourbusiness problems.

1274
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:38,462
Marrying Yamini will fix
everything, right?

1275
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:40,056
Her millions will revitalize
your company.

1276
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,863
l think you should mind
your own business.

1277
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,398
ltis my business!

1278
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,995
lf Rishabh wanted to marry
you... hewould have.

1279
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:48,472
And... you know he's
engaged already.

1280
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,602
l don't care. l know heloved
me and wantedto marryme.

1281
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:53,680
He was under pressureto please you.

1282
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,477
lfhewas under pressure, wouldn't
hehave joined the business?

1283
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,677
At therateat which he's going,
l'm surehewill.

1284
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:04,486
Naina...whatare you doing here?

1285
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:05,957
Tryingto sort out my life.

1286
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:09,425
Shesays we pressurized
you into marrying Yamini.

1287
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:11,563
Whatis wrong with you, Naina?

1288
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,895
We'vebeen over this
a million times.

1289
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:15,434
Then onelast timewon't hurt!

1290
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:17,902
Then lets you and l talk... Don't
drag mom and dad into this.

1291
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,563
Aren'ttheyresponsible?

1292
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:20,698
Responsible forwhat?

1293
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,435
Forwhat?

1294
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,443
For getting you to marry that
filthyrich bimbette...

1295
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:25,773
only for her money.

1296
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:26,904
Take it easy Naina.

1297
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,914
She's beautiful and young,
that's abonus for you.

1298
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,916
Have you killed yourconscience?

1299
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:32,451
Naina stop it. l am warning you.

1300
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:35,454
Your greed masquerading as
obligation makes mesick Rishabh.

1301
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:36,580
What's wrong with you?

1302
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:37,715
What's wrong with you?

1303
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:38,849
What's wrong with me?

1304
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,121
The truth fucking hurts.
That's your problem.

1305
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:44,130
You... all of you are
fucking hypocrites,

1306
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,460
with not an ounceofintegrity.

1307
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:48,000
Naina stop it. You know what..
-Get thehell out ofhere.

1308
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,468
God will punish you! lt'll
all come back to you...

1309
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:51,595
you haveno idea. You will rot in...

1310
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,469
You will rot in fucking
hell. Fuck you all.

1311
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:57,010
You'll bemiserable forthe rest
ofyourlives. Mark my words!

1312
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,900
Your idea was rejected. You felt
desperate, you quit your job.

1313
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:26,630
That's no excuse. Lifeis
full ofups and downs.

1314
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,100
You need to grow up
and deal with them.

1315
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:30,702
What's thematterwith you?

1316
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:34,974
You still wanthim back...

1317
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:37,775
l don'tknow...

1318
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:43,722
lt's high time you know Naina.

1319
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:46,725
l can't be your rebound
sex toy forever.

1320
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:48,859
Even l want the real thing!

1321
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,668
l know you keep trying to
get in touch with him...

1322
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:59,064
l don'tsay anything because you
said you wanted moretime.

1323
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,538
l'm trying mybest, Naina,
but you're...

1324
01:33:02,643 --> 01:33:05,134
Jai... you'vealso suddenly
appeared in my life,

1325
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,874
wanting to start off from exactly
where you left off four years ago.

1326
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,210
lt's not so simple.

1327
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:11,217
l was on the verge of
marrying Rishabh.

1328
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:16,080
Wewere...we weretogether in a
way that l havenever been with you.

1329
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:19,817
l got usedto theidea
ofhaving him around.

1330
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,690
Of... ofhim beingthere for me.

1331
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:24,094
Nainal don'twant to know
how good it was with him.

1332
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:26,562
You need to start living
in the present,.

1333
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:28,225
and stop running away from
whatis real in your life

1334
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:30,566
Jai you walked out on me
when it suited you...

1335
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:32,161
andwalked right back
in when itsuited you.

1336
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,571
lt can't always beabout
your convenience, Jai!

1337
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:37,172
And it's very easy for you to
accuse meofbeing commitment phobic,

1338
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:38,575
what was thestrength of your
commitment four years ago..

1339
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,237
..when l wanted to settle down?

1340
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:42,248
You just ran away... disappeared!

1341
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,914
l said l madea mistake.

1342
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,253
But l'm here now.
And l want you now.

1343
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:50,987
Naina l am ready to start afresh.

1344
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:53,250
But you're obviously not.

1345
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:58,660
l just needed closure. l needed
to confront them onelast time.

1346
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:15,875
You don't needto confront them.
You needto confront yourself.

1347
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:17,075
And figureout what you want...

1348
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:31,626
l can't do this anymore.

1349
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,360
Call me...

1350
01:34:37,204 --> 01:34:38,296
when you sort your lifeout.

1351
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:21,882
Ah... so listen, Shalini
will be taking over...

1352
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:24,750
so you can, you know,
hand over to her.

1353
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:26,276
Okay?

1354
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,957
l had to think about
my career Naina...

1355
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:57,893
lt's all over. The
dream is shattered.

1356
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:00,960
Ofloveand ambition...
nothing remains.

1357
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:07,240
Naina!

1358
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:13,578
Open thedoor, Naina!

1359
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,373
Naina...

1360
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:21,922
You've got everyoneso worried.
Nottaking anyone's calls.

1361
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,046
Cutting yourself offlikethat!

1362
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,926
Ruksana was goingto cancel
her doctor's appointment..

1363
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:27,186

1381
01:40:18,078 --> 01:40:20,046

Hello,what are you doing?

l thought you were
checking your mail.

1388
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:51,335
When have you been writingthis?

1389
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:54,078
Stop it Malini. lt's just
somepersonal crap.

1390
01:40:54,181 --> 01:40:55,205
Pleasedon'tread it...

1391
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,484

1392
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:00,018
-Malini! -Go takea shower.

1393

Okaynow enough! Stop prying.

1395
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:12,698
l'm not prying... l'm just reading.

1396
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:15,158
Shit man!

1397
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:16,566
This is amazing.

1398
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:18,635
l can't believe you've
written this...

1399
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:20,163
seriously!

1400
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:29,375
Right, l had a look at the material.
lt seems we'vegot abook here!

1401
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:31,577
-l knew that...
-l don't know...

1402
01:41:31,685 --> 01:41:34,051
-Naina.
-l'vejust been writingto unwind.

1403
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:38,054
Justrelax.
What we havehere is fabulous!

1404
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:41,227
Seeit does need alittle bit
ofwork... tweak the shape...

1405
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:43,524
alterthe structure abit...

1406
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:46,190
...context and yet
what wehave is great.

1407
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:47,798
Here's whatl propose, okay!

1408
01:41:47,901 --> 01:41:50,335
Let mespeak to my London office,
and get their approval.

1409
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:53,071
ltwon't be aproblem.
ln factthey'll loveit.

1410
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:55,064
Then we commission you to write it.

1411
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:59,802
l'm not sure... l've...

1412
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,173
- Listen... - Comeon, Naina.

1413
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:03,306
lf you don'twant to write it...

1414
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:05,385
wecan always buythe
raw material from you...

1415
01:42:05,486 --> 01:42:07,249
...and commission
somebody elseto do thejob.

1416
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:10,619
But you know what, ideally
that's notthebest option.

1417
01:42:11,859 --> 01:42:15,795
Listen you'vequit your job.
Just givethis a shot!

1418
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:17,363
You might actually enjoyit Naina.

1419
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,294
Let me think about it...

1420
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:23,770
Peopledieto get
their book published.

1421
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:25,099
Like this one?

1422
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,100
lt's the chanceof alifetime.

1423
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:29,573
And you haveto get your
mind off Rishabh and thatJai.

1424
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,448
Chapter one. lt's monsoon in Mumbai.

1425
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:45,121
Therain is
splashing across the roads.

1426
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:50,126
A youngwoman in abright red car,
drives through thegreylandscape.

1427
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,741
You areusing my Post-30
club idea, after all...

1428
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:06,142
Well listen the Celebrate
guys liked your idea, better.

1429
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:08,407
And sincethedetailing
had been done... you know.

1430
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:10,142
But it's completely unethical.

1431
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,274
Well l'm really sorry...

1432
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:12,676
No, you're not.

1433
01:43:15,722 --> 01:43:18,213
Don't worry we'll be
ablesortthis out.

1434
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:21,351
But whatl am goingto
need from you..

1435
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:23,361
..is as much documentation
as possible.

1436
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:25,460
l will give you everything
l'vegot.

1437
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:29,397
Good. Now, l'll sit with my
team andwe'll figureout...

1438
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:31,164
thebest way forward in this case.

1439
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:36,335
Copyright law enforcement in lndia,
is at a very early stage.

1440
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:39,645
So harassment and malpractice
is probably..

1441
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:41,338
..the onlywaywecan nail them.

1442
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:43,410
-Ok? -Yeah.

1443
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:46,317
You've just started
writing your book.

1444
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:48,613
There's no need to
go on this crusade.

1445
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,789
You'vequit. Now let it go...

1446
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:54,194
Listen,writing is your priority...

1447
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:56,919
but it's important for you
to get your due, l think.

1448
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:59,597
l'm so angry.
How can l not speak up?

1449
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,861
l know l'm taking on
amajor battle,

1450
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:07,504
but...there's no other option.

1451
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:30,950
Lets settlethis. 20 lakhs
and you withdraw the case.

1452
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:32,579
l'm notinterested in settling.

1453
01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:33,710
Not enough?

1454
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:37,685
We cannot get a stay
order forthis event.

1455
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:38,815
l'm not giving up.

1456
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,486
Do you want to filean appeal?

1457
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:49,368
TheCelebrateSpa Chain welcomes you
to thelaunch of The Post 30 Club.

1458
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:52,905
So let's gettogetherand

l am very grateful to the ADZ team.

1467
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:23,898
The Post 30 Club... l
think it's a fabulous idea.

1468
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:27,066
You know,weatADZ, have

1469

01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:35,643
Yes, yes! The Post 30 Club
was definitelymybrain child.

1472
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:39,079
l did alot ofresearch and it
took a lot ofthought to comeup...

1473
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:40,653
...with theCelebrateSpa campaign.

1474
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,946
Ofcourse with the
launch of The Post 30 Club...

1475
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:53,893
Sometimes, even though wedon't
want the samethings anymore...

1476
01:47:54,201 --> 01:47:56,726
yesterday's broken
dreams still hauntus.

1477
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:15,111
Can l... meet Naina?

1478
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:16,513
Wait aminute.

1479
01:48:24,731 --> 01:48:27,199
She's busy, she
won't beable to see you.

1480
01:48:27,801 --> 01:48:28,825
Sorry.

1481

Her nose is just
like yours. Same nose!

1492
01:49:37,637 --> 01:49:39,537
So, mommy Ruksana...
how does it feel?

1493
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:43,075
lt's the best feeling in the world!
Both of you should feel this.

1494
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:45,677
Hopefully... someday,

1495
01:49:46,046 --> 01:49:47,172

1496
01:49:49,849 --> 01:49:51,544
So how are things with Sahil?

Maybethat's how you feel right now.

As long as you'rehappy Ruks.

Thehappiestl'veever been...
divorce just seems pointless now.

01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:11,696
And Noorwill need her daddy...

1503
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,932

And ofcoursemy parents,
especially my mother.

1538
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:06,739

1539
01:53:06,846 --> 01:53:08,404

think l'vefinally cometo terms...

1541
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:13,752
with turning 30!

1542
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:23,491
Mirrors lieand ask difficult
questions. Am l beautiful still?

1543
01:53:24,397 --> 01:53:26,365
Will hestill loveme
when l havewrinkles?

1544
01:53:27,033 --> 01:53:28,933
Am l only what l do orwho l love?

1545
01:53:30,136 --> 01:53:31,398
Havel missedthebus?

1546
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:34,364
Whyis turning 30 so hard?

1547
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:39,506
Myth - 30 year oldwomen
find 40 year old men attractive.

1548
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:44,773
Fact- 30 year oldwomen find 22
year old boys more attractive.

1549
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:49,178
lt's calledthe ''he's been
with anotherwoman radar''.

1550
01:53:49,556 --> 01:53:51,854
Except it's not always reliable...

1551
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:54,453
because wesee only
what we chooseto see.

1552
01:53:55,562 --> 01:53:57,792
Broken hearts can bemended.

1553
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:00,797
All it takes is few
nights ofdrunken revelry...

1554
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,425
and manynights of
tear stained pillows.

1555
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:12,803
The real solution to abroken
heartis of courseanother man...

1556
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:14,974
well other men!

1557
01:54:15,448 --> 01:54:17,473
or better still
- ahair cut.

1558
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:22,286
A red dress and stilettos and..

1559
01:54:22,388 --> 01:54:25,289
..you feel like all your
dreams can come true.

1560
01:54:30,597 --> 01:54:32,155
Then you wakeup thenext morning...

1561
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:35,063
...and realize, it's
just another regular day...

1562
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:38,036
and you put your lifeon hold,
until thenext time...

1563
01:54:38,137 --> 01:54:40,002
...you takeout that red
dress from your closet.

1564
01:54:42,475 --> 01:54:44,841
Thirty or not,we are
all looking for happiness,

1565
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:46,841
but perhaps in thewrong places.

1566
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,848
-Such a wannabe signature.
-Teach meabetter one.

1567
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:04,587
l don't know whatto say...

1568
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:07,860
You don'thave to
say anything Rishabh...

1569
01:55:08,968 --> 01:55:11,869
-l didn't want itto turn
out this way. -lt's okay.

1570
01:55:12,272 --> 01:55:13,398
l am sorry Naina.

1571
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:18,000
l just...wish l
hadn't been such a bastard.

1572
01:55:18,444 --> 01:55:19,877
Thepast is over Rishabh.

1573
01:55:23,516 --> 01:55:24,881
l am not marrying Yamini.

1574
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,051
lt was all forthe
wrong reasons Naina...

1575
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:32,323
What you and l had was real.

1576
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,223
lt's time fornew beginnings.

1577
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:46,902
So you'll give me another chance?

1578
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,441
Find yourselffirst Rishabh...
and you'll find love.

1579
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:02,079
Read mybook,
ithas all theanswers.

1580
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:22,942
Jai!

1581
01:56:38,257 --> 01:56:41,693
l'vesorted out my life now.
l'vedonewhat l had to do.

1582
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,554
Will you marry me?

1583
01:57:17,397 --> 01:57:21,993
After rain comes sunshine.Just
as winter always turns to spring.

1584
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:24,332
But thespring blossom depends
on how well..

1585
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:26,337
..we are ableto usethewinter.

1586
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:29,137
l guess l had learnt
to brave the winter.

1587
01:57:30,109 --> 01:57:33,010
And it was finally
timeto greet spring!
