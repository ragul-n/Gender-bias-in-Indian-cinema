1
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,343
Come on!

2
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,111
I'm scared.

3
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,416
At least tell me why
you've brought me here.

4
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,724
Wait for it. It's a secret.

5
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,526
Bilal!

6
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,897
WOW!

7
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,609
This is so beautiful.
Why are we here?

8
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,575
It's beautiful, isn't it?

9
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:24,416
This place is gorgeous.
- Did you like it?

10
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,791
Look at this. - Yes.

11
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:35,732
You like it?

12
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,207
Bilal, I'm scared.

13
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,316
Bilal. Bilal. Where are you?

14
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,746
You know I'm scared.

15
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,799
Rukhsar Sheikh, will you marry me?

16
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,659
I feel like the queen today.

17
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,905
The queen is coming
to our wedding, too.

18
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,271
I've booked the entire
place for our reception.

19
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,304
The musical ceremony
will happen in that hall.

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,380
We'll get married
in that beautiful hall.

21
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,482
All the important people
in the city are going to be there.

22
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,208
The mayor,
MPs, businessmen and also the queen.

23
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,754
This is going to be the
biggest wedding in the city.

24
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,586
I love you. - I love you, too.

25
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,692
Please don't do this, Bilal.

26
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,893
You know I'm scared of the dark.

27
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,369
Please don't do this again.

28
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,605
Bilal. I'm scared.

29
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,750
You won't stop being a prankster.

30
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,950
Come on. I'm scared. Let's go.

31
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,647
Sorry, darling.
I had gone to get the torch.

32
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,431
Ghost! Ghost!

33
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,753
Sir, I beg your pardon,
but we can change the venue.

34
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,683
Let's do it in Karachi.

35
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,927
Just forget everything
and have some sweets, dad.

36
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,430
It seems like the world
has come to know that..

37
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,624
...the queen is coming
to our wedding.

38
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,660
What will people think?

39
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,929
That the queen got
scared of a ghost?

40
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,005
And even we changed the venue,
fearing the ghost.

41
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,632
Think about it, or you'll
have to apologize to people later.

42
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,036
Please, uncle.

43
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,943
<i>Sh', the queen's adviser
is here to see you.</i>

44
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,406
The queen's adviser?

45
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,721
Mr. Chaudhary? - Yes.

46
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,887
Richard Bakshi, personal
security advisor to Her Highness.

47
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,054
...the queen of England.

48
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,000
Mr. Chaudhary,
the queen rarely attends weddings.

49
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,496
And it was your good luck that she
decided to attend your reception.

50
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,597
It's all over the
newspaper and TV that..

51
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,845
...the queen is attending
your reception.

52
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,644
The bottom line is,
you can't back out now.

53
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,682
Don't worry, Mr.
Bakshi. We'll handle it.

54
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,521
You have no other choice.

55
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,861
Mushtaq! - Sir.

56
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,126
Get the top ghost
busters in the city!

57
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,697
Ghost busters?
- Those that catch ghosts.

58
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,929
Let's give you
today's breaking news.

59
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,936
Bilal Chaudhary's
wedding is in jeopardy.

60
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,940
And hence, he's called the
best ghost hunter team in the city.

61
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,840
Come, let's see what
Jack's hunting team does.

62
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,138
Mr. Ghost Buster"
- Okay. This is very simple.

63
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,815
My team and I will have
this ghost within five minutes.

64
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,714
Hunters!

65
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,153
They claimed to catch
the ghost in five minutes.

66
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,894
Let's see how long they take.

67
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,898
Five, four, three, two, one.

68
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,162
Run! Run! - Run! Run!

69
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,598
Jack, who did this to you?
- It's a disaster in there.

70
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,808
I'd suggest this ghost
is very dangerous. Very strong.

71
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,070
The queen should not come.

72
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,077
And you should cancel the wedding!

73
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,081
This time, the Chaudhary family
has hired a ghost buster from..

74
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,451
Nigeria.

75
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,956
Can you believe it? Nigeria.

76
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,959
Let's see if he can
exorcise the ghost.

77
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,930
Five. - Four.

78
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,026
Three. - Two.

79
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,069
One.

80
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:56,519
The ghost threw out ghost
busters from different countries.

81
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,813
I wonder what we're going to do now.

82
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,957
Sir, I would like to say something.
- Yes, tell me.

83
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,222
Sir, there is a community
in the world which is the bravest.

84
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,066
And that is, Sardar.

85
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,271
They are so fearless that
nothing in the world can scare them.

86
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,908
Not even ghosts and witches?

87
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,039
Not even ghosts and witches.

88
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,913
You'll die, Sardar!

89
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,924
Their honor matters
to them the most.

90
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,788
Have you lost your mind?

91
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,566
The situation is
tense inside, Sardar.

92
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,645
'Ji'. Call me 'Sardarji'.

93
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,948
Mind your tongue.

94
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,760
I've been handling
all this since I was a kid.

95
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,558
'I've been trying to
explain such a simple thing..'

96
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,891
'..but no one understands.'

97
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,602
'So, what's your name? - Jaggi.'

98
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,571
'Roll number 18. - Present, sir.'

99
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,010
'Roll number 19.'

100
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,671
'Where the hell is he!'

101
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,049
'I've been calling out to you!'

102
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,213
'Have you become mute
after your parents died!'

103
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,060
'Come on!
- Where are you taking me?'

104
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,758
'Come on!
- Where are you taking me?'

105
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,597
'Come on! - Come on!'

106
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,120
'I'm being polite.
Stop harassing me.'

107
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,153
'I won't. Tell me what
you're going to do, Sardar.'

108
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,797
'Don't forget to
add 'ji' to Sardar.'

109
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,275
Yes, Sardarji.

110
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,758
"They are proud of their
dusky complexion and brown eyes."

111
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,095
"They live in pride.
They are fearless."

112
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:02,673
"They don't spare the
ones that mess with them."

113
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:07,040
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

114
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,445
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

115
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,228
"Youngsters are rebellious."

116
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,268
"The world praises our valor."

117
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,104
"Youngsters are rebellious."

118
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,010
"The world praises our valor."

119
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,415
"We never go back on our word."

120
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,945
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

121
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,357
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

122
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,270
"They know how to
deal with enemies."

123
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,507
"They know how to
love someone truly."

124
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,120
"They know how to
deal with enemies."

125
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,123
"They know how to
love someone truly."

126
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:31,491
"Only a man with
courage could do this."

127
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:37,257
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

128
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,862
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

129
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,535
"People call us
Sardarji for a reason."

130
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,309
<i>Jaw'-</i>

131
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,786
Will you do me a favor?

132
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,526
Just one favor on a Sunday.

133
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,127
I'll always be grateful to you.
I swear.

134
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,275
Sir, your dream is over.

135
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,177
Wake up. Let's get to work.

136
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,581
Did you hear the
phone ringing? - Yes.

137
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:33,582
Answer it.

138
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,418
Okay.

139
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,373
Hello. - Hello,
is it Jaggi the ghost hunter?

140
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,573
No, he's busy.
Tell me what you want.

141
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,009
A ghost needs to be captured.
What else do you do?

142
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:06,556
We're here to capture
ghosts and not humans.

143
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,921
Give me the address.
- Adarsh Public School.

144
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,583
Which school?

145
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,605
Good morning, guys! Good morning!

146
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,176
Get up! Get up! Wake up!

147
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,112
It's morning! - Good morning, Jaggi!

148
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,618
Good morning!
Good morning! - Greetings, Jaggi!

149
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,651
Greetings! Greetings! Good morning!

150
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,084
Come on, wake up! - Jaggi!

151
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:56,973
"You're my bride,
and I'll be your groom."

152
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,600
"Wait for me.." - You
may try your luck, Jaggi.

153
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,406
You won't find the queen witch.

154
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,973
"You're my bride,
and I'll be your groom.." - Jaggi.

155
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,188
What's the matter?

156
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,948
I heard it was difficult
for you to spend the night.

157
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,353
You couldn't sleep.

158
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,619
Don't you like it being
in the bottle anymore?

159
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,595
Yes, Jaggi. You have
no idea how difficult it is.

160
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,599
I miss the village
headman all night.

161
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,033
I don't even know
if he misses me, too.

162
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:31,197
Is the headman's secretary a woman?
- Yes. There is one.

163
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,669
She's his secretary.

164
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,313
Exactly. Which is
that hotel near Malerkot?

165
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:42,109
Ronak! - Ronak!
That's where they're usually found.

166
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,051
They're engrossed into each other.
- Oh, my God!

167
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,126
May you rot in hell!

168
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,697
I'm amazed.
You know a lot about hotels.

169
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,297
You've tied your hair tightly today.

170
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,428
I'm glad that you noticed it.

171
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,600
So, tell me. When do you
plan on wearing the blue turban?

172
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,075
Why would he wear blue?

173
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,080
Jaggi, listen to me.
Always wear only green turbans.

174
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,208
Whenever you wear a green turban,
my heart skips a beat.

175
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,680
Why don't I simply transfer
you into a green bottle.

176
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,152
...you colorful witch!

177
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,558
Long live revolution!

178
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:29,293
Ladies and gentlemen, women haven't
been given the rights they deserve!

179
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,165
Women are still treated
like a machine to wash clothes"

180
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,068
...and give birth to children.

181
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,371
The British have left
the country.. Jaggi.

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,612
Pay attention to
what I'm saying. - Yes..

183
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,581
The British have left the country..

184
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,246
...but women are still
treated like slaves by men.

185
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,550
Long live.. - Revolution!

186
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,057
Long live.. - Revolution!

187
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,521
I regret capturing you.

188
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,188
Jaggi! Jaggi!
- Yes, Mr. Pritam. Tell me.

189
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,132
Jaggi, you never talk to me.

190
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:12,401
No one even treats strangers in
this manner, the way you treat me.

191
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,806
What can I do for you, Mr. Pritam?

192
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,046
Jaggi, I need to get
out of here for two days.

193
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,643
This is not a government job!

194
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,276
Don't be angry. - You always
make me angry, Mr. Pritam!

195
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,352
Sir..

196
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,212
Watch out!

197
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,722
Sir, someone's here to see you.

198
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,384
I've told you this before.

199
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,627
I don't work on Sundays.

200
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,655
I'm on a holiday today.

201
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,363
Don't let go of
this opportunity, sir.

202
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,558
You might find your queen witch.

203
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,172
You make me emotional
talking about the queen witch.

204
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,202
I wish I find her.

205
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,144
God doesn't think
about holidays. - Yes..

206
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,478
So, what are you waiting for?
Make arrangements to leave.

207
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,518
Okay, sir.

208
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,788
Jaggi, listen to me.
You won't find your queen witch.

209
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:04,088
I have an idea. Why don't you
transfer me into that big bottle?

210
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,753
Preeti, you can't
become the queen witch..

211
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,762
...if you've hung yourself
from the ceiling fan.

212
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,492
She wants to be the queen!

213
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,435
"Wait for me.
I'm going to come to.."

214
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,634
III-get you."

215
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,108
"You're my bride.."

216
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,821
There he is!

217
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,455
So!

218
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,123
Buddy, you're here to capture
a ghost. Where are your tools?

219
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,689
He's so silly.

220
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,433
You need tools for manly ghosts and
not for the respected lady ghosts.

221
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,732
Looks like he needs
some mental treatment first.

222
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,140
Jaggi, the flower won't work here.

223
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,840
Master Amrik Singh died 3-4
years ago. I think the ghost is him.

224
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:03,750
What nonsense! You ruined my Sunday!
I was relaxing.

225
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,917
I didn't like going
to school even on weekdays.

226
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,589
...and you've called me on a Sunday!

227
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,321
You told me it was a lady ghost!
- They didn't tell me.

228
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,727
Whether it's a ghost or a witch,
how does it matter?

229
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,231
It may not matter to you.

230
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,766
I'd be traumatized if
you told me that Sunil Shetty..

231
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,802
...and Shilpa Shetty were siblings.

232
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,802
Of course.

233
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,431
Take the money from them.
I'll get the ghost.

234
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,337
Here you go, sir. Do it.

235
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,839
Hey! Where do you
think you're going?

236
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,506
It's not a free show!

237
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,517
I haven't witnessed it. What
made you think you could witness it?

238
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,779
Back off!

239
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,584
Duffer!

240
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,818
I'm not a duffer.

241
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,724
I've passed 12th
grade by third class.

242
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,486
If you don't believe me, then
let me narrate an essay on 'My Cow'.

243
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,459
'I love animals.
My favorite animal is cow.'

244
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,763
'My cow has several names, a few of
which are Dabkhadabi and Vilaitan.'

245
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,931
Be a man!

246
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,643
I wouldn't let someone
writing such an essay pass!

247
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,341
Now you're talking, master.

248
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,345
Now, let me finish my essay.

249
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,910
'Dabkhadabi has almost four legs,
and has no tail.'

250
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,257
I'll thrash you if you
try to act smart with me.

251
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,984
What do you mean almost four legs?

252
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,692
Didn't you count her legs properly?

253
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,695
Even if the cow doesn't have a tail,
why did you have to mention it?

254
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,424
You don't look good anyway. At least
your essay would have looked good.

255
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,502
Okay. 'I take Vilaitan
to the playground.'

256
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,505
'He eats grass while I play around.'

257
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,599
You idiot!
A cow is female, not male.

258
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,768
Don't interfere.

259
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,607
My father nurtured it like
a son and so it's male. - Oh.

260
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,976
'What's special about him is that..

261
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,778
...it gives fresh,
white milk daily, for dairies.'

262
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,444
What kind of a cow
gives milk for dairies?

263
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,920
Does she sell her
milk in packets, too?

264
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,391
You can find faults in my language,
but don't interfere in our business.

265
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,655
The milk has to be sent to dairies.

266
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,855
If children are given
such fresh milk directly..

267
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,023
...they'll have loose motions.

268
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,664
Along with the children..

269
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,599
...if their parents fall ill as well,
then we'll be doomed.

270
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,069
Children these days get
loose motions because of milk!

271
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,306
As if you never had loose
motions because of milk. - No.

272
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm constipated.

273
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,502
That's even worse!

274
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,040
What's my fault if I'm constipated?
I belong to Sangrur.

275
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,079
Don't talk about Sangrur, master.
I love Sangrur.

276
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,453
Your only fault is
that you ruined my Sunday.

277
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,393
How do you feel, master?
- What have you done!

278
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,366
You captured Amrik
Singh in the bottle.

279
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,801
You're misunderstanding, dear.
Get me out of here.

280
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,998
I've always served Punjab.

281
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,041
You haven't served Punjab,
but its children, by thrashing them.

282
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,437
Let me give you your pension.
You were the master.

283
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,842
I've caught him, Chundi!

284
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,623
Your job is done. Have fun.

285
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,623
You captured the
master's ghost so soon!

286
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,695
There was nothing
much to do inside anyway.

287
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,524
All I had to do is capture
him inside the bottle.

288
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,557
But we can't see him.

289
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,060
By the way, it's a ghost,
not a cat whose tail I can show you.

290
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,633
I'm telling you,
the ghost is inside the bottle.

291
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:43,838
I can't see him.

292
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,472
Give me the money.
Take Rs. 500 from them.

293
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,636
Yes, pay us. - Give him the money.

294
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,443
Come on, hurry up. 300..

295
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,847
This is just Rs.
400! We decided on Rs. 500.

296
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,648
This is all we have. Take
it if you want to, or else get lost.

297
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,777
You scoundrel.

298
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,020
We are artists.
Learn to talk to people first.

299
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,754
Here's your money. We don't want it.

300
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,153
Let's go.

301
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,761
You.. - Don't fight. Forget it.

302
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,890
Hold on..

303
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,534
You insulted me and
didn't even pay me.

304
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,008
Sir, we had fun today!

305
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,138
Slowly. I haven't been
a pillion on a motorcycle before.

306
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,149
He's solved all the
cases successfully.

307
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,017
He captures ghosts for Rs. 500.

308
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:30,950
He's solved all the
cases successfully.

309
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,087
He captures ghosts for Rs. 500!

310
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:36,815
He can capture ghosts!

311
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,589
He doesn't seem to be capable
of even boarding a bus in time.

312
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:53,669
Sir, give me pleasure, not pain.

313
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,068
You seek pleasure in this cheap oil.

314
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,679
It's an unknown number.
Answer it, sir.

315
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,458
I'm on a holiday today.

316
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,719
Hello. This is Jaggi.

317
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,822
Hello, Mr. Jaggi. This is
Bilal Chaudhary, from Leicester.

318
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,162
We need a ghost to be
captured from a building.

319
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,736
I can't capture
ghosts via telepathy.

320
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,170
It's important for
me to be at the spot.

321
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,867
Give me your address. Where
exactly is your village located?

322
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,634
According to Punjab,
it's towards the north.

323
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,804
Towards the north.

324
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,949
We'll have to go to
Chandigarh for that, and..

325
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,177
Jamuna Nagar. -Jamuna Nagar.

326
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,482
Jamuna Nagar from Chandigarh,
and then, via Badrinath..

327
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,518
Which way do we go from Badrinath?

328
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,219
Who told you that you have to
cross Badrinath to come to the UK?

329
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,996
No one in this village
can give me advice.

330
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,031
I like to roam around.

331
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,533
Mr. Jaggi, please don't bother.

332
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,228
I'll get you a special visa
from the British government.

333
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,664
...and send you a ticket, too.

334
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,602
You just have to come.
- Where do I have to go?

335
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,139
England.

336
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,880
England! That's great!

337
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:05,879
How much will I get paid?

338
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,781
Just get the job done.
I'll pay you as much as you want.

339
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,784
Millions, in pounds.

340
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:11,946
Millions in pounds!

341
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,819
We'll be paid millions in pounds.

342
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,758
Hello. I hope this is not a joke.
My blood pressure shoots up.

343
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,758
Right. I'll call
you once your visa and..

344
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,093
...ticket have been
arranged for. Okay?

345
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,968
So, should I start
multiplying rupees? - Yes.

346
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,730
Are you sure? - I'm sure.

347
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,103
Okay. bye-

348
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,702
Sir, we've gotten lucky!

349
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,181
We'll be wealthy now!
We'll be wealthy!

350
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,912
Who are you? - I'm Chundi.

351
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,179
What do you do?
- I'm your assistant, sir.

352
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,722
Sir, we're going to be wealthy now.

353
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,164
Can I invest in a big committee now?

354
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,066
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

355
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,273
So, I'll start packing your clothes.
- Go ahead.

356
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,312
Master, Pritam, don't be
so shocked or you might die again.

357
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,951
Jaggi, dear, since the ghost
is abroad, they might speak English.

358
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,054
How will you understand?

359
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:23,149
I'm not afraid. I'm an educated man.

360
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,091
That's not what I meant.

361
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,752
All I'm trying to say is that..

362
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,831
"Since you're going to
deal with Englishmen there..

363
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,033
...why don't you take
an English teacher along?

364
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,296
Anyway, before my death,
I had prayed to the Lord of death..

365
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,838
...that since I couldn't
go abroad while I was alive..

366
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,738
...I would like an opportunity
to go abroad after my death.

367
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,668
'He won't need a ticket.'

368
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,268
'I can speak English, too.'

369
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,739
'But since he's educated,
he might give me some good advice.'

370
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,981
Master. - Yes?

371
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,181
My dear Jaggi!

372
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,315
Jaggi darling,
I won't need a ticket either.

373
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,894
Take me along, too. - Ma'am.

374
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,657
When you're going to Nagpur,
you don't take oranges along.

375
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,698
I'll hit you!

376
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,805
<i>Chum“. - Yes'!?</i>

377
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,636
I'm going because this is important.

378
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,641
I don't feel like leaving you alone.

379
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,812
Concentrate on your work.

380
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,376
Watch out!

381
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,880
Watch the road! What are you..

382
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,080
Why are you turning the car?
- Stop screaming!

383
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,747
We're going to die!

384
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,289
Chundi, I want to board
the flight safely. - You will.

385
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,940
Hello, handsome. - Need a ride?

386
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,306
Don't smile unnecessarily.
It won't work out. Do you get it?

387
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm here on a different mission.

388
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,994
Welcome, sir.

389
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,370
How are you?

390
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,234
Sit down.

391
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,145
Don't act smart. I'm watching you.

392
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,963
Bilal Chaudhary. - Yes.

393
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,828
Your aunt is beautiful.

394
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,766
She's not my aunt.
She's Queen Elizabeth.

395
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,498
Who? - She's the queen.

396
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,905
She's supposed to
come to my wedding, too.

397
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,369
I'm really tense.

398
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,813
Discuss the queen later.
Get me out of here first.

399
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,383
Hold on. Let me discuss the payment.

400
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,986
Sure, go ahead. Be my guest.

401
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,089
You're offering two
slices to your guest.

402
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,123
Mr. Jaggi, just get this done.

403
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,261
We'll pay you as
much as you ask for.

404
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,062
Bilal Chaudhary, to be honest,
I don't know numbers beyond 900.

405
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:24,000
Can I get paid in pounds daily?
- As you wish.

406
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,904
That means it's a
celebration for my pockets.

407
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,007
What do you mean?

408
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,942
I mean, my pockets never
had money in them before.

409
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,542
But now, they'll have pounds.

410
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,278
Right.

411
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,279
Okay, tell me something.

412
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:43,251
Is the ghost that you
want me to capture, a female?

413
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,789
How does that matter?
It's the same thing.

414
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,865
You're strange.
Of course it matters.

415
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,830
I'd be traumatized
if you told me that..

416
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,095
...Babbal Rai and Aishwarya
Rai were siblings.

417
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,398
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Who's Mr. Rai?

418
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,438
It was just an example.

419
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,035
Don't talk too much. I like peace.
I'm usually very quiet.

420
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,241
Okay, tell me something.

421
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,142
Am I supposed to sleep here
or do you have a room for me?

422
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,442
There is a room for you.
Come with me.

423
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,880
Is there a toilet? - What?

424
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,208
Is there a toilet?

425
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,048
Of course.
It has a bathroom attached. - Okay.

426
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,848
Right.

427
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,484
You see, I like rooms that
have toilets attached to them.

428
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,528
Right. Right. - Easy approach.

429
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,893
Right. - Let's go.

430
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,590
Come.

431
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,357
I'm suffocating in the bag.

432
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,903
Jaggi! Where the heck are you!

433
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:34,169
You travelled in business class and
I was suffering inside the bottle.

434
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,438
Open it! My head is hurt.

435
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:40,072
Stop your nonsense
and get me out. - I am.

436
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,482
Thank you.

437
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,351
You won't die again, master.
Look, we're abroad.

438
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,884
I don't see beautiful girls around.

439
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,083
Wait for it.

440
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,058
People have jetlags,
but I've had a bottle-lag.

441
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,152
You're great, JKQQ"

442
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,227
Let's look around the country.

443
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,504
Here you go, master.

444
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,006
You can't drink, nor can you bathe.
Just sniff it.

445
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,316
These foreigners are weird.

446
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,352
They bathe where they eat.

447
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,553
Bilal Chaudhary was saying that..

448
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,423
...a girl jumped off
the roof of the castle"

449
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,519
...and died four years ago.

450
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:33,434
Do you know the name, address or
family of the girl? Any information?

451
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,526
We won't find any information
if we continue chitchatting here.

452
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,508
I think the girl was setting the
television antenna on the terrace.

453
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,940
She slipped and fell.

454
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,207
They don't have the Jalandhar
Doordarshan channel here.

455
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,475
I don't think she
was setting the antenna.

456
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,078
She must have touched the cable
wire, got electrocuted and fell.

457
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,558
Master, one thing is for sure.

458
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,990
The girl seemed to be adventurous.

459
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,460
Go away!

460
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:05,490
Master, it'll be fun to capture
a white witch. - That's true.

461
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,071
Really? - Can't
I even think about it?

462
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,138
Go ahead.

463
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:19,676
Golden hair,
blue eyes, fair complexion.

464
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:25,286
She'll look like
thunder in the bottle.

465
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,249
She'll converse with me in English.

466
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:34,228
'Jaggi, please let me go.
Jaggi, leave me, please.'

467
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,025
There are so many
legends about this"

468
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,698
A ghost hunter has been called.
- From Punjab, he's just arrived.

469
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,134
Sardarji! - Sardarji!

470
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,610
What's your special
plan to catch the ghost?

471
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,975
Sardarji! - Please tell us.

472
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,140
Sardarji.. - Sardarji!

473
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,740
How do you think you're
going to succeed when others"

474
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,986
Sardarji..
- Sardarji, what's your plan!

475
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,682
Sardarji, what's the bottle for?
How are you going to..

476
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,353
All the ghost hunters
that had gone into the castle"

477
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,520
...failed in their mission.

478
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,530
They had to run out of
the castle to save their lives.

479
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,362
If I can't do it, nobody can do it.

480
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,063
I've worked for the Discovery
Channel for 10 years!

481
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,070
I bet he won't even
get a chance to run out!

482
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,663
Let's see your Sardar!

483
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,645
Jaggi, why did you hit him?

484
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,675
His English was fine,
but he didn't add 'ji' after Sardar.

485
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,129
The witch has done the right thing.

486
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,591
It's a beautiful castle.
Who wouldn't want to live here?

487
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,581
Sweetheart.

488
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,813
Sweetheart.

489
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,113
You're short-tempered.

490
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,790
You seem to be very angry.

491
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,560
Both are broken.

492
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,324
Sweetheart.

493
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,538
She seems to be reserved.

494
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:45,887
Ma'am, if you don't
want to meet me..

495
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,157
...then stop looking
at me secretly, too.

496
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,228
Talk on my face.

497
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:02,361
The slap was on your face,
not anywhere else.

498
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,568
A Punjabi witch!

499
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,600
Oh, my!

500
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,227
The queen witch.

501
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,297
I'm done for. I'm done for.

502
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,464
"Where are you?"

503
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,297
"This is the time of
my life and I know that.."

504
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,840
"..you will be with
me all the time."

505
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,287
You've come to your
senses with just one slap.

506
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,928
Ghostbusters like you come here
and leave disappointed every day.

507
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,362
Tell the one who's sent you that my
name is Pinky and this is my home.

508
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,643
Pindky.

509
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,481
Idiot. It's Pinky, not Pindky.

510
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,952
I'm letting you go
because you're a Punjabi.

511
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,392
If it was someone else..

512
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,927
...I would have torn their
clothes and thrown them out.

513
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,327
Do you understand? - Yes.

514
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,828
Get lost.

515
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,884
Breaking news.
Sardarji's clothes are intact.

516
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,648
Let's talk to him. - Sardarji!

517
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:11,825
Jaggfl

518
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,722
Do you see this? He's the man!

519
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,559
<i>Jaw'-</i>

520
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:19,893
You're amazing!

521
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:25,834
Jaggi, I'm so happy
to see you in your clothes.

522
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,033
Really, you look great.

523
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,412
Chaudhary Bilal. - Yes?

524
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,615
Are you sure you want to marry her?

525
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,580
Yes. Why do you ask?

526
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,115
She sounds weird.

527
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,627
She said she's happy
to see me in my clothes.

528
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,431
When did she see me without clothes?

529
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,630
No, no. She means that all
the ghost hunters that went in..

530
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,164
...came out with their clothes torn.

531
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,072
You're the only one
who has his clothes intact.

532
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,040
So, she's happy.

533
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,538
That's why they call me an expert.

534
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,674
The situation is under control.

535
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,615
Very soon, the castle
will be under control, too.

536
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,621
It's an innocent lady ghost.
There's no need to be scared.

537
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,621
We'll do it.

538
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,619
Thank you, Jaggi.

539
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,626
Does she have any demands?

540
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,628
All she needs is love.

541
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,827
And she will get it.

542
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,167
Bilal. - Yes.

543
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,871
Find out where this girl
Pindky lived, who fell off the roof.

544
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,471
Jaggi, her name must be Pinky.

545
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,937
It's Pindky.
Just tell the cameramen.

546
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,840
There they are. - All right.

547
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,175
Thank you.

548
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,640
Sardarji.

549
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,578
You're a sensible man.

550
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,924
Jaggi, I've found
out about Pinky's mother.

551
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,694
She lives 50 kilometers
away from the city.

552
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,163
I've also learnt that
she doesn't like socializing.

553
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,474
Who is it? Who do you want to meet?

554
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,543
What do you want?

555
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,684
I'll clear the newspaper
bill next week.

556
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,214
Ma'am, I'm Pindky's friend.
I think you didn't recognize me.

557
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,688
No.

558
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,057
The mother and daughter
are short-tempered.

559
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,610
I'm Pindky's friend, ma'am.

560
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,602
I shifted to Punjab for a few years.

561
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,240
When I came back,
I learnt that Pindky..

562
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,577
Give me some ice.

563
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,624
Give me some ice. - Yes.

564
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,126
Go, get a glass for yourself.

565
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,761
No, I'm fine.
- You think this is wrong.

566
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,970
Here you go. Have a sip.

567
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,669
No, ma'am. I prefer milk and curd.

568
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:15,140
Curd? Fine, I'll get you some curd.

569
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,079
Add some sugar to it.
It enhances the flavor.

570
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,686
Here, have some curd.

571
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,320
Hans Curd.

572
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,998
Is it good? - It tastes
just like the one I eat at home.

573
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,931
I wonder what Chundi feeds me.

574
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,731
How do you know Pinky?

575
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,270
Everyone knows Pindky.

576
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,644
Yes, she was my Bebo.

577
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,679
My Kareena Kapoor.

578
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:59,788
She liked to get decked up, wear
good clothes and visit good places.

579
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,917
When she was in college"

580
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,753
...she started learning
dance alongside her studies.

581
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,928
She would win every competition.

582
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,264
She became famous.
People would take her autograph.

583
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,095
They would click pictures with her.
She was very talented.

584
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,861
Yes, absolutely.

585
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,768
You might know it.
- I know everything.

586
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,596
She was a little crazy.

587
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,871
She would quarrel with
people for no reason.

588
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:28,341
One night, when she went to a party,
she never returned.

589
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,915
Some say that someone pushed her..

590
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,986
...while the others
say that she slipped.

591
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,019
But I don't know
what exactly happened.

592
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:41,653
She got me my pension
before leaving.

593
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,162
She was so fond of music!

594
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,373
She would listen to Muhammad
Sadiq's songs all day.

595
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,141
No. She liked Kumar Sanu.

596
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,336
Yes, she liked Sanu, too.

597
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,110
She was crazy about roses.

598
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,347
Red roses.. - White. White roses.

599
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,813
She loved to eat.

600
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,350
I remember, she stuffed herself
with 'Chhole Bhature' once.

601
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,725
No. She only liked
pancakes and cupcakes.

602
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,354
She hated Indian food.

603
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:20,128
Get up. Put the curd down. Come on.

604
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,097
Get lost. Get out of here.

605
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,069
You call yourself her friend.

606
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,799
You know nothing about Pinky.

607
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,398
Leave.

608
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:34,142
Listen. Do come home
sometimes. - Sure.

609
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,081
We'll talk about Pinky.

610
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,217
Her taste in music wasn't good.

611
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,810
What do you know about her?

612
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,817
No, it was good. - Crazy boy.

613
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,391
Pindky.

614
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,358
My dear Pindky.

615
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,238
Do you want to be insulted again?

616
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,376
I already told you yesterday.

617
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,776
And my name is Pinky,
darn it, not Pindky.

618
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,442
I call you that with love.

619
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,243
By the way, I'm here to talk to you.

620
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,481
Don't act smart.
Say what you have to, and leave.

621
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,452
What I was trying to say is..

622
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,957
...if you want, we could get
you a house outside of the city.

623
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:25,327
A closed down warehouse
or a years old mansion.

624
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,197
We need this castle forjust a day.

625
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,905
Bilal and Rukhsar will get married.
People will be happy.

626
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,731
Didn't you understand
what I told you yesterday?

627
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,741
This castle is mine. Only mine.

628
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,309
Why are you risking
your life for the others?

629
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:41,212
Listens, Sardars are always ready
to risk their lives for people.

630
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,015
These are deep talks.
You won't understand.

631
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,248
Let's talk about something sweet.

632
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,821
How do you know I like pancakes?

633
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,497
They call me an expert for a reason.

634
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,167
I had been to your house.

635
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,839
Really? How's mom? Is she all right?

636
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,972
Does she still drink
or has she quit?

637
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,349
Your mom can never quit drinking.

638
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,187
But, you know what?

639
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,154
She was telling me
that she can't sleep.

640
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:26,552
It kills her.

641
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,830
She never loved me when I was alive.

642
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,366
Don't try to make me emotional.

643
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,992
I won't get emotional either.

644
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,897
Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes.

645
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,500
Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes..
- If you want me to leave the castle..

646
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,405
...then I have a condition.

647
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,506
Just order me, Pindky.

648
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,381
It's Pinky.

649
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,189
You know what?
Call me whatever you want.

650
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:57,419
Listen to me. - Tell me.

651
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,287
There's a girl named
Jasmine Gill. - Okay.

652
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,261
She dances in London. - Okay.

653
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,557
Find out about her
and bring her here.

654
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,270
If I bring Jasmine Gill here,
you'll leave the castle. - Right.

655
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,839
Consider it done!

656
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,406
Just tell me if she's dead or alive.

657
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,339
Stupid! She's alive.

658
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,910
How would you have brought
her here if she was dead?

659
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,109
That's what I do.
I'm not capable of anything else.

660
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:20,909
What did you say?

661
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,585
You'll leave the castle
if I bring Jasmine Gill here.

662
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,947
My second condition is
that you won't ask any questions.

663
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,858
You behave just like a housewife.

664
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,259
Listen"

665
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,327
You have nothing else to do.

666
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,297
Why don't you see
me off till the door?

667
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:39,998
For what?

668
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,637
Let the others know
that we're friends now.

669
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,267
Shut up and get lost!

670
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:52,174
So, Pinky has laid a condition
that she will leave the castle..

671
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,341
...if you bring her
a girl named Jasmine Gill.

672
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,646
But why do you want to
get involved into all of this?

673
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,079
Just capture her in the bottle.

674
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,950
You take five minutes
to capture ghosts.

675
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,648
No, master. I can't do this in love.

676
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,955
And anyway, it's not
about Bilal's wedding anymore.

677
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,157
I'm of a marriageable age as well.

678
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,268
Really? You still act immature,
and you want to get married.

679
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,167
I think this is going
to go on for a long time.

680
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,134
I think I should
settle down here, too.

681
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:34,487
Bilal, find out if
he's human or a ghost.

682
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,525
Cheers!

683
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,320
Master, you're so funny!

684
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,103
They look like ghosts to me.

685
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,456
Don't buy the grapes.
They look sour.

686
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,251
Those look okay.

687
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:49,088
Get the bag doubled. Doubled..

688
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,209
You shouldn't eat ketchup.

689
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,476
You don't know what kinds
of tomatoes are used for it.

690
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,686
I have a flourishing
business in Punjab.

691
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,247
I've come here on a holiday.

692
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,693
I thought I should advice you.

693
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,787
By the way, I like your earrings.

694
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,099
I chose them for a very
close friend of mine last week.

695
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,135
But I forgot the shop.

696
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,269
Get out of the store and go left.

697
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,342
There's Burberry store" - Oh, yes!

698
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,641
I got them from the Burberry store.

699
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,475
It has other branches. Burberry!

700
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:40,611
Really?

701
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,240
I think you missed
the floor upstairs.

702
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,416
I've heard that there
are no lights there..

703
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,814
"As the shine of the gold is more
than enough to lighten up the place.

704
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,389
Listen, mister"
whatever your name is..

705
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,425
JaggL. - Whatever.

706
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:56,553
Jaggi. - Burberry is a clothes
store. They don't sell jewelry.

707
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,392
You don't have to lie.
I'm not interested.

708
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:17,350
"Before my eyes.."

709
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:21,583
"Close to my heart."

710
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:28,721
"Someone resides."
- Can't you talk normally?

711
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,731
Why do you have to
exaggerate everything?

712
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,726
"It's you."

713
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:38,534
Sometimes I feel like forgetting
everything else and killing you first.

714
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,434
Finally you spoke your
heart out in a fit of rage.

715
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:44,441
Wait and watch.

716
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,708
Very soon, you'll ask me what I want
to have for dessert after dinner.

717
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,214
I'll say I want a hug.

718
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,415
Abuses are not enough
for what you've done.

719
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,616
Your idea failed and
you're getting angry at me.

720
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,420
You can only get your pajama
stuck in the chain of a cycle.

721
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,789
You can't entice a girl.

722
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,627
Put it down.

723
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,190
I said, put it down and leave.

724
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,358
What's wrong?

725
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,901
This is what you were capable of.

726
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,833
You've challenged Jaggi.

727
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,705
Now, I'll make sure
I entice the girl.

728
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,547
My way.

729
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,715
I'll finish this.

730
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,662
Enough, Derrick.
Stop learning with the girls, Ryan.

731
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:48,834
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

732
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,744
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

733
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,712
Poise. Keep the poise.
- Sorry to disturb..

734
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:58,581
...but I would like to introduce a
new student, Mr. Jaggi from Punjab.

735
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,387
Oh, God! He's going to kill me.

736
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,661
Ms. Sharma,
the second semester has begun.

737
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,202
How can we include him?
-Jasmine, l..

738
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,738
I told him the same, but he
says he knows how to do basic Salsa.

739
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,504
See, Salsa is a Spanish dance.

740
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,776
I don't think he can do it.

741
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,975
Ma'am, you haven't
seen me dance yet.

742
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,378
We're talking about Salsa here,
Mr. Jaggi.

743
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,886
Ma'am, it's about passion.

744
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,421
I give the orchestra
at weddings a tough time.

745
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,492
Listen. The bride's
family is waiting..

746
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,391
...while people can't
get enough of my dance.

747
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,554
"The first blow scared me."

748
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,654
"The second blow helped me."

749
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,358
"The third blown" - Stop it!

750
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:47,961
Discipline.

751
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,904
Excuse me.

752
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,905
This is how much I love to dance,
Ms. Sharma.

753
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,401
There's no girl available
to pair with him.

754
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,845
Jasmine, he's made the payment.
You'll have to manage.

755
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,445
As far as pairing is concerned..

756
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:10,889
"Let's mix alcohol
in everyone's cold-drinks.

757
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,018
No one will know who
they're dancing with.

758
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,430
And I could pair with her, too.

759
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,565
Good idea, Mr.
Jaggi. - Go ahead. Talk to her.

760
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,838
Okay, Ms. Sharma. I can give
him admission on one condition.

761
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,034
Let's test him on
basic Salsa tomorrow.

762
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:30,970
If he passes the test,
he can continue.

763
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,904
Yes, go ahead. You can take my test.

764
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,540
Of course.
He'll pass with flying colors.

765
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,410
I'm sure.
- Good luck for tomorrow, Mr. Jaggi.

766
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,286
Good luck.

767
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,457
You have to learn Salsa by tomorrow!

768
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,688
Salsa is not a big deal.

769
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,629
I've seen that people
just move fonlvard and backward.

770
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,700
I've done Salsa in government buses.

771
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,735
When the driver brakes,
we move fonlvard.

772
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,531
When he accelerates,
we move backwards.

773
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,469
If a person like me is
travelling without a tic:ket..

774
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,007
...and the conductor comes,
turn around.

775
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,975
This is Salsa.
Everyone in Punjab does Salsa.

776
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,945
Idiot! You won't even learn
holding the girl until tomorrow.

777
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:09,950
You know, you can learn Salsa
only when you love your partner.

778
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,485
When you're affectionate
towards them.

779
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,616
Then, Salsa is the
best dance for us.

780
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,351
We should do it.

781
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,086
Our deal is over.

782
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,393
I don't want Jasmine, nor
will I leave the castle. Understand?

783
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,490
Pindky.

784
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,666
My sweetheart.
- Don't talk to me. I'm very angry.

785
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,762
You look like a human
when you're angry.

786
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,706
Don't be angry.
You know I don't like humans.

787
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,103
You're useless.
All you can do is talk.

788
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,904
I can cook well, too.

789
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,449
Keep smiling. You look like a witch.

790
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,723
Now you look like the queen witch.

791
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,017
Queen witch.

792
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,761
Just wait and watch
what I do now. - What?

793
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,023
It's nothing. I'm making a call.

794
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,061
Hello.

795
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:10,103
Yes, listen. I need five Salsa CDS,
a suit with tie and a CD player.

796
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,744
Salsa!

797
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:31,089
"When the rainbow ribbon
starts to play, dance with me."

798
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,492
"Make me sway."

799
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,060
"Like the lazy action
holds the song."

800
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,438
"Hold me close. Sway with me."

801
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,707
"Like a flower bent
in little breeze."

802
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:48,874
"In the breeze, sway with me."

803
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,085
"While we dance,
you have a way with me."

804
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,082
"Sway with me. Sway with me."

805
00:56:56,646 --> 00:57:00,184
"All the dancers
may be on the floor."

806
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,188
"But my eyes see only you."

807
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:08,158
"Only you have the magic to please."

808
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:12,138
"When we sway, I go.."

809
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:19,137
"I can hear the sound of
violins on the floor, every day."

810
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:24,712
"Makes me think that only
you know how to make me sway."

811
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,054
"You are swaying me."

812
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:35,689
"Like me. Kill me. Hold me."

813
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,690
"Dance with me. Tease me."

814
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:11,964
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

815
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,728
Do your turns. Take your turns.

816
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,772
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

817
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,637
Smile, everyone.

818
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,574
It seems okay. - One, two, three.
And one, two, three.

819
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,907
Chin up. Chin up.

820
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,676
It doesn't seem that difficult.
- Why don't you go and dance?

821
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:35,181
Why should I dance? - Come, let's
do the Salsa! You want to dance!

822
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,848
You come, too. Come on.

823
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,152
Come on. Come on. Come. You come,
too. I'll make you dance as well.

824
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,094
Come, let me show you what Salsa is.

825
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,061
Mr. Jaggi.

826
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:54,041
One, two, three.
One, two.. One, two, three.

827
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,643
Salsa. - What's this?

828
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,110
Salsa.

829
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:03,978
Take it off. Discipline. Quickly.

830
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,813
She's jealous because
I'm looking handsome.

831
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,115
Partners, everyone.

832
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:09,813
Hello.

833
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,851
Ma'am, please ask
them to come one by one.

834
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,595
Come back. Girls, get back.

835
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,066
Amy. Go.

836
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,294
What's wrong with you?

837
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,565
Come on. - Centre.

838
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:27,868
Position.

839
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:30,310
Position.

840
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,239
Really?

841
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,748
Okay. Five, six, seven, eight.

842
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:43,221
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

843
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,284
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

844
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,056
Take the lead, Mr. Jaggi.

845
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,061
It's all right.
You'll learn. Don't give up.

846
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,793
You'll learn. You'll learn.

847
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:05,243
Ma'am, she's new. She'll
take time to learn. She can't do it.

848
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,184
Don't touch me.

849
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,286
One, two, three.

850
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:20,286
Two, three. One, two, one, two,
three. One, two, one, two, three.

851
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:21,987
One, two, three. One, two, three.

852
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,621
One, two, one, two, one, two, three.

853
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,393
One, two, three. One, two, three.

854
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,738
Your admission, Mr. Jaggi.

855
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,949
Class over, guys.

856
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,462
"I'm a fan of yours."

857
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,366
"Tell me what your situation is."

858
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,838
"ls your lover upset with you?"

859
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:50,746
"When you start dancing,
people go crazy."

860
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:57,113
"When you start dancing,
people go crazy."

861
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,862
"You seem to be punctual."

862
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,909
"You seem to be too disciplined."

863
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,946
"You seem to be punctual."

864
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,983
"You seem to be too disciplined."

865
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:27,046
"You'll kill me."

866
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:32,823
"When you start dancing,
people go crazy."

867
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:39,058
"When you start dancing,
people go crazy."

868
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,046
"The relations formed in youth.."

869
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,179
"..stay with you for a lifetime."

870
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:06,219
"The relations formed in youth.."

871
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:09,057
"..stay with you for a lifetime."

872
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:13,456
"My heart beats for you."

873
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,330
"When you start dancing,
people go crazy."

874
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:25,538
"When you start dancing,
people go crazy."

875
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,527
What do you think
about learning Salsa?

876
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,931
Yes!

877
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,234
Salsa is a difficult dance form.

878
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,567
It can be performed only
by the educated people of England.

879
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,547
Even mares at fares
can perform Bhangra.

880
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,085
The point is that
I can't learn Salsa.

881
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:11,090
I can teach you Salsa,
but I really need to know..

882
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,221
...why you want to learn Salsa.

883
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,170
Lucy Spanish.

884
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,234
What? - Lucy Spanish
is my girlfriend.

885
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,473
We're going to get married. - So?

886
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,239
She's laid a condition that..

887
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,443
...I have to perform Salsa
with her on the wedding.

888
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,455
Okay. - I love her a lot.

889
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,287
You know to what..

890
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,984
...extent a person can go when
he's truly in love with someone.

891
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,651
I hope you're not lying this time.

892
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,087
When have I lied before?

893
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,500
All right,
whoever lies now will be punished.

894
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,569
What are you doing?

895
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:09,514
Salsa.

896
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,017
But I must say that you
perform Bhangra very well.

897
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,222
And I'm sure you'll
learn Salsa very soon.

898
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,390
Are you sure? - I'm sure.

899
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:20,653
Are you sure?

900
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,323
9 o'clock. Sharp.

901
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,299
Are you sure? - Sure.

902
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,270
They call me an expert for a reason.

903
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,406
"Sardarji."

904
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,479
"Sardarji."

905
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:49,290
Bilal, will our problems be solved?

906
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:55,558
It was very difficult to convince
our families for our marriage.

907
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,098
And we have this new problem now.

908
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,699
Only seven days are left, Bilal.

909
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,131
We will get married, won't we?

910
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,137
What is Sardarji up to?

911
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,106
Mr. Jaggi.

912
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:19,616
What's this?

913
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:24,257
I gave the Bhangra
group some 'Laddusi

914
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,657
I've brought some for you as well.

915
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,493
As a token, ma'am.

916
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,000
Thank you.

917
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,363
Anyway, my dance
class has some rules.

918
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:43,705
Come on time,
learn dedicatedly and talk less.

919
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,337
What nonsense! - What?

920
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,537
Ma'am, the group isn't here.
Where are the other students?

921
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,583
They've joined Bhangra classes.

922
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,585
They say Salsa is no fun.

923
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,147
That's a loss for us.

924
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,586
We shouldn't lose our customers.

925
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,717
I'll teach them
Bhangra and you sing.

926
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,296
We can benefit that way.

927
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:04,731
Let's start Salsa.

928
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,232
Let's learn Salsa today.

929
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,292
You have to take four steps.

930
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,200
One, two, three, four.
Four, three, two, one.

931
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,409
Do this. Close your eyes.

932
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:20,375
Assume a situation.
Something that's a routine.

933
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,346
It helps the body form a rhythm.

934
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,183
I need to form a rhythm.

935
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,177
A routine. - Yes.

936
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,813
Okay.

937
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:33,383
Here it is.

938
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:40,129
Put the bike on gear,
release the clutch..

939
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,132
...accelerate and brake.

940
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:47,574
I get down and park the bike.

941
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:51,108
I'm playing with my key.
- What's wrong?

942
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,779
I cannot go pass
a girl standing alone.

943
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,216
I must get down
and offer her a lift.

944
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,784
Stupid! Couldn't you have
assumed a better situation?

945
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,812
Get out. - Relax. Don't be angry.

946
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,681
I'm a villager.
This is howl understand.

947
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,417
I have another idea. Hold the key.

948
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,622
Okay, forget the key.

949
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,529
You sing and I'll perform Salsa.
Just wait and watch what happens.

950
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,824
You cannot sing while
performing Salsa.

951
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,862
I'll have to do that as well?

952
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,564
All right, let's do it. Come on.

953
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,399
"Don't wear black slippers."

954
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,565
"..and go to the city."

955
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,368
"Look at your sway."

956
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,573
"it'll drive people
crazy in the city."

957
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,244
Is it working?

958
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,475
"I went to the market
to get something."

959
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,610
"My friends winked at
a girl who studies with me."

960
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,381
"She's fair}.

961
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:35,747
What are you doing?

962
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,590
It's a long song.
I'm making adjustments.

963
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,852
"She's fair}.

964
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,389
"She's beautiful.
My friends will entice her."

965
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,521
"She's the one.
My friends will entice her."

966
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,724
"She's the one.
My friends will entice her."

967
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,767
"She's great!"

968
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,862
Did I manage to do Salsa?

969
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,670
To heck with Salsa.
I was just being nice.

970
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,369
Let's try together.

971
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,146
Let's try together.

972
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,142
This means I'm not good enough.

973
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,183
You will be.

974
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,228
You're doing good.

975
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:01,968
Come, let's try again.

976
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:03,934
Come.

977
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,786
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you run away from there?

978
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,351
Women in the village"

979
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,586
...don't let boys like you
even stand next to their kids..

980
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:21,627
...or you might spoil their kids.

981
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,330
And the girl was willingly
dancing with you here.

982
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,958
Will you come down?
Don't try to be Aladdin.

983
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:29,702
Tell me.

984
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,772
You're concerned about the dance.
I was about to faint.

985
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,737
Why would you faint?
What's wrong with you?

986
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:34,864
Don't try to act smart.

987
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:37,945
I've been through it,
so I know better.

988
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,343
What did you go through?
Tell me. - I'm telling you.

989
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:45,649
Listen. I went close to her.

990
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,378
She came close to me.

991
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,547
We made eye contact.

992
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:52,817
Her hands were in mine.

993
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,018
We held each other tightly.

994
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,531
What are you doing? - It's Salsa.
Will you let me finish?

995
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,497
Tell me.

996
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,029
Then, she took my hand..

997
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,665
...put it around her waist
and pulled me towards her.

998
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,465
Then?

999
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:08,766
I could feel her breaths. - Then?

1000
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,875
Then I froze. I don't
know what happened after that.

1001
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,778
Did she make you dance
on ice that you froze?

1002
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,509
You're too much. You've never
been this close to a girl before.

1003
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:18,050
I have.

1004
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,388
I haven't.

1005
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,619
I don't get involved with girls.

1006
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,626
You don't have to, either..

1007
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,890
...as you're surrounded by
ghosts and witches all the time.

1008
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,799
Listen, love demands sacrifice.

1009
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,630
If you can't make sacrifices,
then forget about Pinky.

1010
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,665
You want me to forget Pindky. - Yes.

1011
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,340
You want me to forget
my queen witch! - Yes.

1012
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,999
I can even give my life for her!

1013
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:51,784
Master, I'm scared.

1014
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,650
If I don't become
a ghost after death..

1015
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,957
...then I might not see Pinky again.

1016
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,627
Be strong.

1017
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:04,061
I can sense that you will
be successful in attaining Pinky.

1018
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,721
Are you sure? - I'm sure.

1019
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,466
Are you sure? - I'm sure.

1020
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,333
Are you sure? - I don't know.

1021
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,733
No, I know you're sure.

1022
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:25,112
Oh, hi! I was waiting for you.

1023
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,779
I'm Shahina, your new Salsa trainer.

1024
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:30,413
Shall we start?

1025
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:33,790
Come.

1026
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,507
Hello!

1027
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,606
Hello, Jasmine! Hello! Hello!

1028
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,144
Don't be under this illusion"

1029
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,021
...that you're so pretty that
I'd go looking around for you!

1030
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,521
You think you're stylish!

1031
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:07,692
God has blessed you with
a face to smile sometimes.

1032
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,091
Why do you sulk all the time?

1033
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:16,902
What are you doing here?

1034
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,595
This is my house.

1035
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:20,937
What are you doing here?

1036
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:23,771
This is not fair.

1037
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,971
You told me you'd quit after
you're done teaching me Salsa.

1038
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,609
I know, but Shahina is a much
more experienced trainer than me.

1039
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,845
You want to learn Salsa, right?
Let her teach you.

1040
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,956
But I gifted you the 'Laddus',
and not her.

1041
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,714
Don't make me spend more.
You train me. You're my teacher now.

1042
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,888
What happened yesterday?
You left the dance halfway and fled.

1043
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,660
Go ahead.
Make an excuse for that as well.

1044
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:50,000
You never tell the truth, do you?

1045
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:56,975
So?

1046
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,046
If you really want
to know the truth..

1047
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:04,483
I fled because.

1048
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:11,819
I don't know what happened..
I felt that way..

1049
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,488
Because I've never
touched a girl before.

1050
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,062
Hold on. Let me get this straight.

1051
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:24,001
You ran away because you've
never touched a girl before!

1052
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:25,904
You've never touched a girl before!

1053
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,600
I've never touched a girl..

1054
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,975
...but I have touched witches before.

1055
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,775
You're crazy.

1056
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,011
Funny crazy.

1057
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,748
You're doing this for
your girlfriend, aren't you?

1058
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,848
This is not what
lovers do these days.

1059
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,652
But I believe this
is how love should be.

1060
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:56,093
And if love is not like that,
then it's not love at all.

1061
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,028
Okay.

1062
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:05,941
Are you sure?

1063
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:07,911
Come.

1064
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:11,681
Come.

1065
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,558
Five, six, seven, eight.

1066
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:27,563
One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1067
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,601
One, two, three.

1068
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,556
<i>Jaw'-</i>

1069
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,021
Yes? - Excuse me.

1070
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,292
Yes.. -Get up..

1071
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,899
You'll have to get up.
You're on top of me.

1072
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:17,615
My clothes are wet. I'll go change.

1073
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,850
Coffee? - Yes, I'll have some.

1074
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,312
Come in.

1075
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,798
I'll be right back.

1076
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:43,200
What's going on? - We're having fun.

1077
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:47,973
It doesn't seem like you're
interested in learning Salsa.

1078
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,648
Stay away from my daughter,
or I'll kill you.

1079
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:56,345
Let it go. Why are you after him?

1080
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,019
He seems to be a nice guy.

1081
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,756
Nice. - Nice.

1082
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,704
Your father seems to be
a short-tempered man, Jasmine.

1083
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,045
He was short-tempered.
But how did you know?

1084
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,250
The fathers of beautiful daughters
are usually short-tempered.

1085
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,792
So, where did you meet Lucy?
- Who's Lucy?

1086
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,955
Lucy, your girlfriend.
Your Spanish girlfriend.

1087
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,832
Actually, I call her Mithi. - Mithi!

1088
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,667
That's so sweet! - Yes.

1089
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:47,797
We met via Facebook.

1090
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,836
I was looking for my friend Lucky.

1091
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:52,002
I missed a 'K'.
It was a spelling mistake.

1092
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,102
That's how I found Lucy.

1093
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,846
I forgot the world when I met her.

1094
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,908
Where is Lucy?

1095
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,383
I wonder why I feel
as if you only lie.

1096
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,190
Are you sure? - Yes.

1097
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:07,350
But I'm not lying.
I can even swear to God.

1098
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,327
No, that's not what I meant.

1099
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,255
Actually, no one loves
their partner these days..

1100
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,799
"As much as you love Lucy.

1101
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,000
See.

1102
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:19,197
Does Lucy love you a lot,
too? - Lucy!

1103
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:21,001
She wears Punjabi dresses for me.

1104
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,076
She insists on covering
her head with a heavy veil, too.

1105
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,905
But I asked her not to, as she's
so delicate that she might fall.

1106
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,949
Lucy respects Punjab
and its people a lot.

1107
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,015
Why don't you ask
her to learn Bhangra?

1108
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,288
She has a bad throat.
She can't learn.

1109
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,085
What has the throat
got to do with Bhangra?

1110
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,783
You need to scream
while performing Bhangra.

1111
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,086
It's not easy to learn Bhangra.

1112
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,991
Bhangra can't be learnt on counts.

1113
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,291
This is what you do in Bhangra.

1114
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,330
How can she learn Bhangra?

1115
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,491
I'll talk to Lucy.

1116
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:51,030
I think Salsa will
affect your relationship.

1117
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,436
No, don't worry. I'll learn
Salsa in minutes. Don't worry.

1118
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,803
I don't want..

1119
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,104
...such a beautiful relationship
to be ruined because of a dance.

1120
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:59,210
I want to meet Lucy.

1121
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,302
No, you're getting serious now.

1122
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:03,042
I'll talk to her. Why do you bother?

1123
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,084
I have to worry as it's
not easy to teach you Salsa.

1124
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:12,189
I want to meet Lucy,
tonight, at 8 p.m.

1125
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,187
Are you sure? - I'm sure.

1126
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,064
I wear cheap vests, but I
had to choose a Spanish girlfriend.

1127
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,234
You did a great job, Jaggi.
Hats off.

1128
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,403
Hello, Bilal. - Yes, Jaggi.

1129
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,175
I need a girl,
or your marriage is in trouble.

1130
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:33,975
What's the matter?
Tell me what happened.

1131
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,878
Bilal, don't ask questions.

1132
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:39,316
I need a Spanish girl by 8 p.m.
tonight. Someone whose name is Lucy.

1133
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:42,479
Okay. Spanish. Done.

1134
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:09,941
I'm starving!
What have you cooked? - No!

1135
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,143
We'll eat together. Let Lucy come.

1136
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:15,952
Strange. Let me check
if the spices are proper.

1137
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,025
I've checked it. It's fine.

1138
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,257
Lucy.

1139
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:25,463
Lucy.

1140
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:34,032
Hi! - Hi,
I'm Cindy, Sardarji's girlfriend.

1141
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,066
Oh, come in. - Hi. Thanks.

1142
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,312
Here comes your girlfriend
wearing a Punjabi dress.

1143
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,380
My sweetheart!

1144
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,122
You said her name was Lucy.

1145
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:51,446
She says her name is Cindy.

1146
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,459
Her maternal name is Cindy.

1147
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,990
She's so upset that she's
changed her name to Cindy.

1148
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,928
My sweetheart was upset.

1149
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,327
My darling girlfriend!

1150
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:06,530
Get off me.
I'm Sardarji's girlfriend.

1151
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,432
I see. So, you want to
play that game. You're so silly.

1152
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,308
I am Sardarji. I am Sardarji.

1153
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:16,478
Oh! Yes..

1154
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:21,148
Come, give me a hug.
- Darling, I love you.

1155
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,257
She's upset now.

1156
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,256
But, when she's in a good mood..

1157
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,122
...she caresses me for
at least half an hour.

1158
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,093
Girlfriend, let's eat dinner.

1159
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,431
Oh, yes, let's eat. Let's eat.

1160
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,971
My Lucy is here. My Lucy is here.

1161
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,132
I'm starving!

1162
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,911
What nonsense.

1163
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,275
What, darling? - Eat, darling.

1164
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,117
Okay.

1165
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:02,484
So, Cindy, how do you
like Punjab and Punjabi people?

1166
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:03,927
Punjab!

1167
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,225
Oh, Punjab!

1168
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,068
Lots of things to see.

1169
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:10,463
Bhangra.

1170
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:14,630
Green fields.

1171
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,435
She's calm now.

1172
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:18,210
Handsome men.

1173
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,505
Poor people.

1174
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,141
Hungry people. Is that a problem?

1175
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:35,056
Here.

1176
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,325
Drink some.
- No, my sweetheart will drink.

1177
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,525
My little,
delicate girlfriend will drink.

1178
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:46,262
So, Cindy,
would you like to live in England"

1179
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:50,002
...or would you move
to Punjab after marriage?

1180
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,707
Why the heck would
I leave my country?

1181
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:55,605
Like, why?

1182
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:00,650
Jaggi, let her talk.
- She's not talking sense anyway.

1183
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:02,988
You're drinking my
alcohol and humiliating me.

1184
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,485
Why are you asking
her so many questions?

1185
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,219
She's angry.
Let her eat. - Okay. Okay.

1186
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,123
I'll feed her.

1187
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:11,764
L.. Give her some rice.
- Wine.. Wine..

1188
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,691
Have some rice. - Bottle..

1189
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:18,468
Dal, some rice, mix..

1190
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,731
Peas"

1191
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,706
No.. No..

1192
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:30,310
I can't..
No.. I don't like Indian food.

1193
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:35,314
Don't you have pizza,
or chicken, or burritos, or like..

1194
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,657
Jaggi, you told me
she likes Punjabi food.

1195
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:41,785
She's very angry.
She's not in a good mood.

1196
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,594
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1197
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:47,522
Let's go out.

1198
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:05,443
Never mind. Let's eat out tonight.

1199
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,148
Can I tell you something?

1200
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,157
She's not fit for you.

1201
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:24,228
Someone else is fit for me.

1202
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:34,541
"When your bangles chime.."

1203
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:39,619
"..it feels like
the stars come on land."

1204
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,820
"When your bangles chime.."

1205
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:54,857
"..it feels like
the stars come on land."

1206
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:20,816
"You mesmerize me."

1207
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:26,297
"Your beauty is enchanting."

1208
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:35,832
"You mesmerize me."

1209
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:41,270
"Your beauty is enchanting."

1210
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:46,316
"We'll stay awake when
everyone falls asleep."

1211
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:51,253
"We'll stay awake when
everyone falls asleep."

1212
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:56,358
"When your bangles chime.."

1213
01:25:56,618 --> 01:26:01,692
"..it feels like
the stars come on land."

1214
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:27,291
"Your looks kill me."

1215
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:32,422
"I feel at peace
when you look at me."

1216
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:42,603
"Your looks kill me."

1217
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:47,646
"I feel at peace
when you look at me."

1218
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:52,616
"When you're with me,
I forget the world."

1219
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:57,587
"When you're with me,
I forget the world."

1220
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:02,691
"When your bangles chime.."

1221
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:08,263
"..it feels like
the stars come on land."

1222
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:12,794
"When your bangles chime.."

1223
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:18,004
"..it feels like
the stars come on land."

1224
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,604
"When your bangles chime.."

1225
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:22,975
<i>Lucy"</i>

1226
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:25,848
"..it feels like
the stars come on land."

1227
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:26,645
Lucy!

1228
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:29,811
Look, I was paid till 8.
Your time's over.

1229
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,355
Hey. you paid rm s p.m_!

1230
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,478
I'll tell you everything.

1231
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:05,887
You don't have to say anything.

1232
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:07,884
Be brave.

1233
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:13,330
How can I be brave! -Jaggi, wait..

1234
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:16,300
Oh, God! Lucy, may you rot in hell!
- Jaggi! Jaggi, move your hand.

1235
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:18,400
JaggL. don't cover your face.

1236
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:21,472
It's okay.

1237
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,303
I was feeling a little restless
for the past few days, Jasmine.

1238
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,676
I thought it was my blood
pressure that was fluctuating.

1239
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:29,043
It would be fine.

1240
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:34,548
But.. Oh, God! I didn't know
my heart was signaling me, Jasmine.

1241
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:35,983
Jasmine, I want to die. - No..

1242
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:41,050
It's okay. - Jasmine, let me die.

1243
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:44,728
Have faith.
- How can I have faith, Jasmine?

1244
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:49,332
Jaggi, get up. - Lucy!
May you rot in hell, you witch!

1245
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,932
Jaggi, get up. Get up. It's okay.

1246
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:53,096
Everything will be all right.
Get up.

1247
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,429
Should I get up? - Get up.

1248
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,040
Taxi. - Come.

1249
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:57,941
Oh, God!

1250
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,579
Sardarji, are you all right?
- Oh, God!

1251
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,378
Oh, God! - Sardarji.

1252
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,376
Sardarji? - Yes.

1253
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,111
You added the 'ji',
didn't you? - Yes.

1254
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:10,889
That's important. Oh, God! - Okay!

1255
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,989
You know what? There are
many more nice girls in the world.

1256
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:17,120
I'm sure you'll soon
find a loving girl.

1257
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:21,997
Are you sure?

1258
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,102
I'm sure.

1259
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:27,762
Excuse me.

1260
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,604
Can we get two Cokes, please?
- Two Cokes, sure.

1261
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,006
Two Cokes, table number five.

1262
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,444
Can I get two rum
and Cokes for table nine?

1263
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:37,038
Lucy? The name doesn't
sound that great.

1264
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:38,910
She doesn't match your level.

1265
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:41,783
Two Cokes, table 5.
Two rum and Cokes, table nine.

1266
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:47,989
Don't mind, but can I say something?

1267
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:51,959
Punjabi boys are idiots.

1268
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,794
I mean, why did you have
to go crazy about that silly girl?

1269
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,799
It took me three hours
to cook all of that..

1270
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,901
...and that Lucy
didn't even taste it.

1271
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,579
Do you have an answer to that?

1272
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,653
Lucy was a drunkard.

1273
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:21,023
Tell me.
Do you have an answer to this?

1274
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:23,425
I do, but I can't say it.

1275
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:27,193
How will you say it?
I'm sure you don't have an answer.

1276
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,092
What nonsense!

1277
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:33,765
How can I answer you?
You didn't leave any drinks for me.

1278
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,972
Where are you, waiter?

1279
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:37,734
Remember your questions.

1280
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,103
You'll get the answers
in a while. - Okay.

1281
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,209
I need Coke. - Hold on.

1282
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:45,549
Hello, waiter.
- Vodka, rum, whiskey?

1283
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:46,749
Give me everything.

1284
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:55,090
Hello!

1285
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:02,091
Show me.

1286
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:06,128
Is that me?

1287
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:09,558
'You listen to me, people.'

1288
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:12,671
'I don't give a damn!'

1289
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,037
'I'm going to live my life my way!'

1290
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:22,007
Go back.

1291
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:28,244
'Ask me now.'

1292
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:31,551
'Lucy didn't eat because
she may not have liked the food.'

1293
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:34,058
'Why should I be punished for her?'

1294
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,856
'What do you think of yourself?'

1295
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,590
'Salsa is no big deal for me!'

1296
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:41,724
'Here you go! One, two, three, four.
Four, three, two, one.'

1297
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:44,996
'Let me click a picture.
Here you are.'

1298
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:18,599
Oh, Shit!

1299
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:50,194
We won't take any more selfies.

1300
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:53,672
I'll delete these.

1301
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:59,235
Bye. - Bye.

1302
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:15,421
You can keep them.

1303
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:18,855
They're memories.

1304
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:31,004
He's having an affair. Do you
think you can get married at all?

1305
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:37,246
Jaggi, only five days
are left for my wedding.

1306
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:41,015
And, my family doesn't
feel like you can do it.

1307
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,345
Forget about your family.
What do you think?

1308
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:49,317
I feel that it's only
you who can resolve this.

1309
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:53,329
I've given you my word. Have faith.

1310
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,706
I trust Sardarji's word.

1311
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:12,112
Hello, ma'am.
Greetings. - Greetings, Jaggi dear.

1312
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:15,717
Can you come home today?
It's Pinky's birthday.

1313
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:20,189
I called all her friends,
but everyone's busy.

1314
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:23,785
Even her cake is..
- Can I come tomorrow?

1315
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:25,958
I have something
important to do today.

1316
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:28,893
I'll come tomorrow for sure.
You take care.

1317
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,125
Okay, dear.

1318
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:38,332
Happy birthday.

1319
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:46,180
Ready. One, two, three, four!

1320
01:35:58,552 --> 01:35:59,997
How do you like the arrangements?

1321
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:04,458
Someone has celebrated my
birthday after a very long time.

1322
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:06,469
Hold on. That's not all.

1323
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:09,872
Come on!

1324
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,138
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1325
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:17,412
You can pay us a few pounds less,
but don't scare us.

1326
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:18,811
Who are you talking to?

1327
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:22,087
What's your problem?
They've been playing quietly, too.

1328
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:25,051
They are foreigners.
They won't understand you anyway.

1329
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:26,784
I'm petrified.

1330
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,191
Please pay us and let us go.

1331
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:31,858
How much do I have to pay you?
- 50 pounds.

1332
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:34,326
Here you are.
Here are 50 rupees, too.

1333
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:36,465
You're Punjabi. Be brave.

1334
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:38,232
I'm friends with the witch.

1335
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:42,064
Witch! Run! Run! Run! Run!

1336
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:50,978
How did you know
that it's my birthday?

1337
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:56,082
They call me an expert for a reason.

1338
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:59,158
You overpaid him. He cheated you.

1339
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,325
Oh, my!

1340
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:04,155
You're trying to save my
moneyjust like a housewife does.

1341
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,128
Pinky, it's been four
years since you died.

1342
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,563
Things are expensive these days.

1343
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:09,129
Nothing is so expensive.

1344
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:11,897
Grocery has gotten expensive.

1345
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:14,070
A bottle of orange
juice costs Rs. 150..

1346
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:15,435
...and two boiled eggs cost Rs. 15.

1347
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,440
What? - Yes.

1348
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:18,237
Just plain, without chutney.

1349
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:19,834
The fares of mini
buses have increased"

1350
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:21,242
...and the government
doesn't issue permits.

1351
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,939
There are no mini buses in England.

1352
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:25,139
Once Punjabis arrive here,
they'll start.

1353
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:27,450
All you do is talk.

1354
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,420
What about the task
that I had given you to do?

1355
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:34,492
You were gone for three days.
I was waiting for you.

1356
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,223
Were you waiting
for me or missing me?

1357
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:43,358
You've started again!

1358
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:46,164
I asked you to do something.
What about that?

1359
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,873
Why do you get angry, sweetheart?
I was busy doing that.

1360
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,034
Look.

1361
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:52,639
Look at this.

1362
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,002
What's this? - Pictures.

1363
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,179
That's all right,
but why are you so close to her?

1364
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:03,883
I was quite drunk.

1365
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:08,023
And then?

1366
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:11,061
And then, I got high.

1367
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:15,557
What's this? - I don't
remember what happened then.

1368
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:18,000
Did you come here to do all this?
- Hold on. What's wrong?

1369
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:20,663
After seeing these pictures, I
think this is what you intend to do.

1370
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:28,606
Why do I feel like someone
is jealous in spite of being dead?

1371
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,086
How many candles?
- Do whatever you want.

1372
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:43,523
Why do you ask me?

1373
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:47,555
Is 34 fine? - That's too much.

1374
01:38:47,688 --> 01:38:48,496
28?

1375
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:52,936
All right, 16 is fine.

1376
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:57,531
Okay. As you wish.

1377
01:38:58,966 --> 01:38:59,569
What?

1378
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:03,012
One thing's for sure.

1379
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:07,110
Whether a girl or a witch, women
don't want to reveal their real age.

1380
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:10,945
All right, let's take a selfie.

1381
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:14,148
Come on.

1382
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:37,976
Forget about the picture.

1383
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:40,016
Cut the cake.

1384
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:52,758
No.. Sorry.

1385
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:55,530
Okay, tell me something.

1386
01:39:55,723 --> 01:40:02,231
If I go to Punjab with you,
where will you take me?

1387
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:03,733
To the palace.

1388
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:07,238
Oh! You have a palace, too?

1389
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:10,042
It's bigger than this castle.
- Really?

1390
01:40:10,804 --> 01:40:13,444
But, only two rooms have
roofs on them. The rest is open.

1391
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:18,281
And, what if you
fall for another witch?

1392
01:40:18,379 --> 01:40:20,359
I have the queen witch.
Why would I fall for someone else?

1393
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:27,461
What if you fall for a girl?

1394
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:30,165
Mission impossible.

1395
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:49,344
'She got me my pension
before her death.'

1396
01:41:54,842 --> 01:41:56,253
Pinky!

1397
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:06,694
Jaggi, I called you a liar.

1398
01:42:09,823 --> 01:42:13,862
But I've hidden the
truth from you, too.

1399
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,311
Five years ago..

1400
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:25,678
...there was a girl who was
famous all over in Birmingham.

1401
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,282
Pinky.

1402
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:30,188
The dance queen, Pinky.

1403
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:37,227
And then, she had a competitor,
and that was me, Jasmine.

1404
01:42:38,585 --> 01:42:41,498
Of course,
it was very difficult to beat Pinky.

1405
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:44,561
So, I lost the first year.

1406
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,896
Pinky had a lot of fans.

1407
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:50,368
But it's a rule of nature.

1408
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:54,210
New flowers blossom every year,
while the old ones wither.

1409
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:58,782
Gradually,
people started to like me, too.

1410
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,354
Pinky was worried about this.

1411
01:43:04,444 --> 01:43:06,685
She knew who would win next year.

1412
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:10,359
Competition turned into hatred.

1413
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:42,926
'Competitions are
won not by bragging.'

1414
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:45,322
'..but with the help of skills.'

1415
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:50,994
'And you very well
know who is more skilled.'

1416
01:43:52,593 --> 01:43:55,972
'You lost last year.
You'll lose this year as well.'

1417
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:01,839
'Because there can only be one star,
and that's me.'

1418
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:08,885
'Yes, you are a star,
but a shooting star.'

1419
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,318
'Now you see me, now you don't.'

1420
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:12,446
'Get off my face!'

1421
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,960
'Don't push me again!'

1422
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:38,978
It was an accident.

1423
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:43,716
But I feel guilty about it.

1424
01:44:44,077 --> 01:44:48,025
I couldn't apologize to anyone,
nor could I ever forgive myself.

1425
01:44:48,849 --> 01:44:53,298
I thought I should at least
apologize to Pinky's mother.

1426
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:56,696
But I couldn't muster the courage.

1427
01:44:57,057 --> 01:45:01,665
I thought of killing myself,
but that wasn't easy either.

1428
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,436
Pinky left, and took along my life..

1429
01:45:06,533 --> 01:45:09,707
...my happiness,
my dancing, everything.

1430
01:45:10,704 --> 01:45:14,049
Instead of suffering
like that each day..

1431
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:16,681
...I wish I had died
instead of Pinky that day.

1432
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,924
Breathing alone
is not called living.

1433
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:27,725
You know,
Jaggi, whoeverl loved in life..

1434
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:31,958
...either left me, or I left them.

1435
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:35,071
People say I'm so ill-fated
that my parents died because of me.

1436
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:45,543
'Where are your parents?
- I have no one.'

1437
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:49,754
'People abuse me.
They hit me. They torture me.'

1438
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:52,952
'Did your parents
take your voice along!'

1439
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:17,838
I thought my life
had come to a standstill.

1440
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:25,716
And then, you came.

1441
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:41,966
My life started to move on.

1442
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:46,735
I want to be honest with you.
I love you a lot.

1443
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:53,508
But that doesn't mean
I expect you to love me, too.

1444
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:57,681
But I have the right to wait.

1445
01:47:29,176 --> 01:47:32,521
'What if you fall for a girl?'

1446
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:34,151
'Mission impossible.'

1447
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:50,641
Go home and sleep if you're sleepy.

1448
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:55,905
I'm not sleepy.

1449
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:03,618
You're in love.

1450
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:45,729
Are you sure?

1451
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:06,141
Jasmine" No.

1452
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:08,951
Jasmine"

1453
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:11,954
<i>'n.</i>

1454
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:14,558
I love you.

1455
01:49:21,855 --> 01:49:22,697
Is that okay?

1456
01:49:30,096 --> 01:49:33,270
Listen, this won't help. Take this.

1457
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:50,760
Jasmine!

1458
01:49:52,886 --> 01:49:55,833
Jasmine! My sweetheart!

1459
01:49:58,625 --> 01:50:00,332
Hello! - Why did you flee earlier?

1460
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:03,737
Are you drunk?
- What's the matter, Jaggi?

1461
01:50:03,964 --> 01:50:07,173
I haven't been caught at the border.
Why are you interrogating me?

1462
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:09,042
I'll answer your questions.
Let me speak first.

1463
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:11,911
Okay, I'm coming downstairs.
Come inside.

1464
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:14,015
Talk right here.

1465
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:18,714
I'm talking right here!
Move aside or you'll fall. - What?

1466
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:20,719
I wonder what nonsense he's talking!

1467
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,885
Jasmine, I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

1468
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:26,224
I don't think I'll be
able to say the whole thing.

1469
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:28,196
I'll come straight to
the conclusion. Here you are.

1470
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:32,733
I'm in love with you. - What?

1471
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:33,935
I love you.

1472
01:50:34,995 --> 01:50:36,065
Hello, Jasmine. Hello.

1473
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:38,403
I don't know how it happened.
I have no idea.

1474
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:42,305
I feel nervous.
But it's done now.. - Jaggi.

1475
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:45,246
Jaggi! - Jasmine,
let me speak. Hello.

1476
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:48,414
When I close my eyes,
I see you with your hair open.

1477
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:50,312
When I open my eyes,
your hair is tied.

1478
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:51,650
I want to say something, too.

1479
01:50:51,945 --> 01:50:54,186
I won't spare you, Jasmine.
Won't you let me finish?

1480
01:50:56,449 --> 01:50:57,894
Hello, Jasmine. Hello.

1481
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,821
Jasmine, I'm hungry,
but I don't feel like eating.

1482
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:05,834
L.. I'm sleepy,
but I can't sleep, Jasmine.

1483
01:51:07,193 --> 01:51:10,003
I used to drink milk and
I don't know what I'm drinking now.

1484
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:12,442
The world seems beautiful now.

1485
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:15,378
I'm in love with you, Jasmine.

1486
01:51:19,472 --> 01:51:21,748
Will you speak or do
you only want me to talk?

1487
01:51:24,077 --> 01:51:25,818
I love you, too.

1488
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:28,020
APDlaud now!

1489
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,130
Who do you keep talking to?

1490
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:38,068
Jasmine, I love you. I love you.

1491
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:40,032
I love you, Jasmine. I love you.

1492
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:41,466
And I love you.

1493
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:53,416
"I can't sleep.
I miss you all the time."

1494
01:51:57,110 --> 01:52:04,995
"I can't sleep.
I miss you all the time."

1495
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:08,465
"My heart keeps saying.."

1496
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:10,498
"I love you."

1497
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,301
"I love you."

1498
01:52:12,459 --> 01:52:15,099
"I like you."

1499
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:17,099
"I love you."

1500
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,834
"I love you."

1501
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:20,976
"My heart keeps saying.."

1502
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:22,910
"I like you."

1503
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:25,004
"I love you. I love you."

1504
01:52:25,105 --> 01:52:26,311
"I love you."

1505
01:52:57,203 --> 01:53:04,451
"When you travel around
the city on your scooter.."

1506
01:53:04,878 --> 01:53:11,454
"..l feel like being your pillion."

1507
01:53:11,551 --> 01:53:14,225
"But I'm scared of your father."

1508
01:53:14,854 --> 01:53:16,265
"I love you."

1509
01:53:16,356 --> 01:53:17,858
"I love you."

1510
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:20,900
"I like you."

1511
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:22,797
"I love you."

1512
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:24,432
"I love you."

1513
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:26,434
"But I'm scared of your father."

1514
01:53:26,533 --> 01:53:28,308
"I like you."

1515
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:30,540
"I love you. I love you."

1516
01:53:30,837 --> 01:53:32,407
"I love you."

1517
01:53:59,032 --> 01:54:06,280
"Let's take a selfie for memories."

1518
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:13,357
"I plan on taking you
for a movie tomorrow."

1519
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:16,052
"My wallet isn't hidden from you."

1520
01:54:16,516 --> 01:54:18,052
"I love you."

1521
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:19,925
"I love you."

1522
01:54:20,153 --> 01:54:22,633
"I like you."

1523
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:24,533
"I love you."

1524
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:26,495
"I love you."

1525
01:54:26,626 --> 01:54:28,401
"My wallet isn't hidden from you."

1526
01:54:28,494 --> 01:54:30,371
"I like you."

1527
01:54:30,463 --> 01:54:32,500
"I love you. I love you."

1528
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:34,272
"I love you."

1529
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:47,957
I've told you so many times
to knock before opening the bottle.

1530
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:49,583
I get sentimental sometimes.

1531
01:54:49,682 --> 01:54:51,127
I was daydreaming.

1532
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:06,577
I'm very happy today, master.

1533
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,543
All the problems
will be solved today.

1534
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:11,240
I'll clear the misunderstanding
between Pinky and Jasmine.

1535
01:55:13,606 --> 01:55:15,210
Bilal will get married.

1536
01:55:15,608 --> 01:55:19,920
Do you have the courage
to tell the truth?

1537
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,319
I'm going to Pinky.

1538
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:28,262
I'm not talking about Pinky.
I'm talking about Jasmine.

1539
01:55:29,389 --> 01:55:32,632
Does she know why you're here?
Why you were learning Salsa?

1540
01:55:33,092 --> 01:55:35,231
Does Jasmine know that
Pinky had sent you to her?

1541
01:55:35,461 --> 01:55:37,031
Does she know who you are?

1542
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:04,993
My dear Jaggi.

1543
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:13,403
I love you.

1544
01:56:16,002 --> 01:56:17,606
I love you. - Come.

1545
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:23,051
What's the matter?
Are you in a bad mood?

1546
01:56:29,782 --> 01:56:32,194
There's something I
need to tell you. - What?

1547
01:56:35,488 --> 01:56:37,525
I never had a Spanish girlfriend.

1548
01:56:42,628 --> 01:56:44,266
I didn't even know her name.

1549
01:56:44,597 --> 01:56:48,511
The other day, when you were
leaving money for Pinky's mom..

1550
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:52,141
...I had just left from
there after meeting her.

1551
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,280
Did you know Pinky?

1552
01:57:01,514 --> 01:57:02,549
I know Pinky.

1553
01:57:07,053 --> 01:57:10,227
Actually,
this is what I do in Punjab.

1554
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:15,231
Bilal had called me up.

1555
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:20,509
I came to England because
Bilal was to get married.

1556
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:47,437
My job was to take
you inside the castle.

1557
01:57:49,328 --> 01:57:51,433
Everything was going perfectly.

1558
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:54,273
And then?

1559
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:02,609
I fell in love.

1560
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:07,287
With you.

1561
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:18,428
Jasmine,
I know you're very angry at me.

1562
01:58:20,293 --> 01:58:22,569
But please don't be quiet.
Scold me if you want to.

1563
01:58:23,396 --> 01:58:28,402
If you wanted to get me killed,
then why did you pretend to love me?

1564
01:58:30,670 --> 01:58:33,344
All you had to do
was ask me for my life.

1565
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:38,716
I wouldn't have refused.

1566
01:58:41,481 --> 01:58:42,892
This will be the
last lie of my life.

1567
01:58:43,382 --> 01:58:45,623
There is a difference between
a lie and deceit, Jaggi.

1568
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:47,454
Please forgive me.

1569
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:53,801
Get out. - Jasmine,
I'll set everything right.

1570
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:55,471
Get out!

1571
01:59:25,224 --> 01:59:28,899
Dear, you lost your love
because you told the truth.

1572
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:31,439
Lying was better.

1573
01:59:33,533 --> 01:59:34,876
Are you happy now?

1574
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:40,909
Jasmine had started to
smile after a very long time.

1575
01:59:43,476 --> 01:59:49,256
I told you that this
boy wasn't right for Jasmine.

1576
01:59:50,783 --> 01:59:53,821
We're dead. We can't even help you.

1577
01:59:55,221 --> 02:00:00,261
Come on, pack your
bags and go back to Punjab.

1578
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:24,786
JaQQi. are you all right?

1579
02:00:29,755 --> 02:00:30,825
Don't talk to me!

1580
02:00:32,325 --> 02:00:34,396
My mission was almost accomplished.

1581
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:37,301
I was singing love
songs and having fun.

1582
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:39,535
But you told me that
I was in love with Jasmine.

1583
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:41,368
She left me.

1584
02:00:43,502 --> 02:00:45,504
You knew I don't like humans.

1585
02:00:46,839 --> 02:00:48,546
Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

1586
02:00:49,041 --> 02:00:50,281
As long as I was lying..

1587
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:51,719
...she was performing
Salsa and Bhangra with me..

1588
02:00:51,811 --> 02:00:52,516
...and clicking selfies with me.

1589
02:00:52,612 --> 02:00:55,354
But when I told the truth,
she asked me to get lost.

1590
02:00:57,483 --> 02:00:58,689
This is not how love is.

1591
02:01:03,356 --> 02:01:04,266
Are you sure?

1592
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:10,903
Jaggi. - What?

1593
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,037
Answer your phone. - It's my phone.
I don't wish to answer it.

1594
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:15,840
Don't talk to me. I'm warning you.

1595
02:01:19,705 --> 02:01:20,479
Hello.

1596
02:01:20,706 --> 02:01:23,915
JaggL. Where are you?

1597
02:01:24,076 --> 02:01:27,057
It's my wedding day.
We're waiting for you outside.

1598
02:01:27,446 --> 02:01:30,518
Please tell us if we can go inside.

1599
02:01:32,852 --> 02:01:37,767
Please, Jaggi. At least tell me
whether Pinky is inside or has left.

1600
02:01:52,605 --> 02:01:54,676
Listen. Where is the Sardar?

1601
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:57,650
I think he's concerned about
his marriage more than yours.

1602
02:01:57,743 --> 02:01:58,847
Uncle!

1603
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:05,459
Who's she?

1604
02:02:05,551 --> 02:02:08,760
The wedding can't happen now.
The witch has relatives.

1605
02:02:10,489 --> 02:02:12,765
Jaggi, you won't let us go inside"

1606
02:02:12,858 --> 02:02:15,361
...but the girl you were
dancing with is going inside.

1607
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,470
Pinky.

1608
02:03:57,663 --> 02:03:59,574
You wanted me here, right?

1609
02:04:02,468 --> 02:04:03,503
Here I am.

1610
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:12,817
You think I killed
you to win the competition.

1611
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:15,454
But I was never that selfish.

1612
02:04:15,748 --> 02:04:21,198
Perhaps, losing wouldn't have
pained me as much as your death has.

1613
02:04:21,587 --> 02:04:23,498
Stop giving false explanations.

1614
02:04:24,089 --> 02:04:25,932
I died because of you.

1615
02:04:27,159 --> 02:04:28,968
You have to die, too.

1616
02:04:31,764 --> 02:04:34,472
Let's go. I don't think
the wedding is going to happen.

1617
02:04:35,201 --> 02:04:36,646
To heck with the Sardar!

1618
02:04:37,536 --> 02:04:39,709
Sardarji! - Sardarji!

1619
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:42,115
Sardarji. He's here.

1620
02:04:45,511 --> 02:04:47,013
I know you want me dead.

1621
02:04:50,082 --> 02:04:51,254
I'm ready.

1622
02:04:53,152 --> 02:04:54,529
I'm ready, Pinky.

1623
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:00,797
I have no reason
left to remain alive.

1624
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:03,799
I'm ready, Pinky.

1625
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:12,274
Hello! Stop! Move!

1626
02:05:13,038 --> 02:05:14,949
Why are you in such
a hurry to die? Come on.

1627
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,646
Why do you sympathize with her?

1628
02:05:17,977 --> 02:05:19,786
Because she's here for me.

1629
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:22,186
Is Pinky here?
Who are you talking to?

1630
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:24,192
The one you were talking to.
Stand quietly.

1631
02:05:24,283 --> 02:05:26,559
Jaggi, let her die. She killed me.

1632
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:28,962
She is not capable
of killing anyone.

1633
02:05:29,054 --> 02:05:32,092
I've found out everything.
She didn't push you on purpose.

1634
02:05:32,157 --> 02:05:35,070
You fell by mistake.
- Please let me die, Jaggi.

1635
02:05:35,327 --> 02:05:37,068
Everything will be fine once I die.

1636
02:05:37,162 --> 02:05:40,041
Are you out of your mind!
Just stand quietly!

1637
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:44,670
Pinky, I've found out.

1638
02:05:44,803 --> 02:05:46,840
She is a very nice girl.

1639
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:47,883
Pinky, please forgive her.

1640
02:05:47,973 --> 02:05:49,850
She couldn't live in
peace after your death.

1641
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:50,784
She quit dancing.

1642
02:05:50,876 --> 02:05:52,287
You love your mother the most,
don't you?

1643
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:53,884
Don't you?

1644
02:05:54,046 --> 02:05:56,083
She sends money to
your mother every month.

1645
02:05:58,884 --> 02:05:59,760
Yes.

1646
02:06:02,955 --> 02:06:04,559
What? Have you forgiven her?

1647
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:07,000
All right, it's sorted!
She has forgiven you.

1648
02:06:07,092 --> 02:06:09,902
Jasmine, Pinky has forgiven you.
-Jaggi, I haven't forgiven her.

1649
02:06:09,995 --> 02:06:10,973
You're just assuming things.

1650
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:13,270
Thank God! Now hug each
other and finish it off.

1651
02:06:14,934 --> 02:06:17,005
All right, don't hug each other.
It's over now.

1652
02:06:17,102 --> 02:06:19,582
Jaggi, she killed me.
I haven't forgiven her.

1653
02:06:19,672 --> 02:06:21,310
Let me clear your misunderstanding.

1654
02:06:21,774 --> 02:06:23,811
Come, let me tell you
what must have happened.

1655
02:06:23,943 --> 02:06:25,650
I've found out what
happened that day.

1656
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:28,918
Look, Pinky was here
and Jasmine was here.

1657
02:06:29,048 --> 02:06:30,254
Where was Jaggi?

1658
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:34,227
You weren't there.
- Of course I wasn't! Stand quietly!

1659
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,664
Don't confuse me! All this wouldn't
have happened if I was there.

1660
02:06:36,755 --> 02:06:38,063
I'll tell you what
happened that day.

1661
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:41,165
This is Jasmine, and I'm Pinky.

1662
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,864
No, this is Pinky and I'm Jasmine.

1663
02:06:42,962 --> 02:06:45,033
Pinky pushed Jasmine.

1664
02:06:45,364 --> 02:06:47,241
Push me. You're Pinky.

1665
02:06:47,366 --> 02:06:49,368
And that's why Jasmine pushed Pinky.

1666
02:06:50,002 --> 02:06:51,037
She fell!

1667
02:06:52,404 --> 02:06:55,851
I know she fell,
but it's not her fault.

1668
02:06:58,310 --> 02:07:00,984
Jaggi! - Hold on, let me finish.

1669
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:03,353
Stupid, Jasmine fell.
Go and save her.

1670
02:07:08,187 --> 02:07:08,961
Jaggfl

1671
02:07:11,056 --> 02:07:12,364
Jaggi, please help me.

1672
02:07:12,758 --> 02:07:14,760
You didn't listen to me. You jumped.

1673
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:16,871
Jaggi, please save me.

1674
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:20,636
You said you wanted to die.
You were trying to be a hero.

1675
02:07:21,266 --> 02:07:24,076
Jaggi, if something happens to me,
I won't spare you.

1676
02:07:24,236 --> 02:07:27,706
Don't threaten me.
- Give me your hand.

1677
02:07:27,873 --> 02:07:30,080
She was trying to act smart.
Come on. - Give me your hand.

1678
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:31,954
Pull me up.

1679
02:07:32,044 --> 02:07:35,082
The witch may not come out, but
the girl will lose her arm today.

1680
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:38,284
Jaggi, I hope Pinky has forgiven me.

1681
02:07:38,984 --> 02:07:42,227
If the witches stop obeying me, then
my business will be shut. Come on.

1682
02:07:42,388 --> 02:07:43,059
Oh, God!

1683
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:44,429
Don't let her die, Jaggi.

1684
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:47,133
I'm saving her.
And why are you so concerned?

1685
02:07:47,226 --> 02:07:48,671
Is she your long lost relative?

1686
02:07:48,827 --> 02:07:51,967
If she dies, then she'll become
a witch and be my competitor again.

1687
02:07:53,899 --> 02:07:55,139
Jaggi, I lost my grip.

1688
02:07:55,234 --> 02:07:56,804
Women confuse me.

1689
02:07:56,902 --> 02:07:57,903
First you told me that
you wanted to kill her..

1690
02:07:58,003 --> 02:07:58,913
...and now you want me to save her.

1691
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:00,745
Please. - Don't make me the bad guy.

1692
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:04,444
Jaggi! - Jaggi! - Sardarji!

1693
02:08:04,977 --> 02:08:06,923
Jaggi! Jaggi! Jaggi! Jaggi!

1694
02:08:09,348 --> 02:08:10,258
Jaggfl

1695
02:08:11,016 --> 02:08:12,825
Jaggi, I'm losing grip.

1696
02:08:12,918 --> 02:08:15,797
I don't want to die. - Jasmine,
listen to me. Let go of me.

1697
02:08:15,954 --> 02:08:18,264
You'll die, but I'll find you.

1698
02:08:18,924 --> 02:08:23,100
No, no, no! -Jasmine, my leg hurts.
I'm losing grip, too.

1699
02:08:24,296 --> 02:08:26,833
Stop making faces. Use your powers.

1700
02:08:26,932 --> 02:08:28,969
Of what use is a witch? - Yes.

1701
02:08:50,355 --> 02:08:52,335
That's it? - That's it.

1702
02:08:52,424 --> 02:08:53,334
Is that all you've got?

1703
02:08:53,826 --> 02:08:55,499
You make some efforts, too.
I can't do everything.

1704
02:08:55,794 --> 02:08:57,796
Jaggi! - Hold on.

1705
02:08:57,863 --> 02:09:00,742
_ Jaggi, please.
I m losing my grip Jaggi

1706
02:09:06,205 --> 02:09:07,411
Be careful.

1707
02:09:12,511 --> 02:09:14,081
Try to come up. Hold my hand.

1708
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:17,226
All right,
Jasmine, Pinky, I'm going.

1709
02:09:18,484 --> 02:09:21,931
Bilal, listen!
I'm dying! - Be careful, Jaggi!

1710
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:25,001
Take a few lakh pounds from
Bilal and let go of the castle.

1711
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:27,192
Send a few pounds to Chundi as well.

1712
02:09:27,326 --> 02:09:29,067
He won't survive without me.

1713
02:09:29,361 --> 02:09:31,272
Donate some pounds to
the Gurudwara in the village.

1714
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:34,136
Jaggi, hold my hand, please.
Come up.

1715
02:09:34,233 --> 02:09:37,908
I bought some new stuff
which I haven't even used.

1716
02:09:38,337 --> 02:09:39,907
Give it to some needy.

1717
02:09:40,139 --> 02:09:42,312
Stupid, he'll be fine.
Pull him up. - Hold my hand.

1718
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:44,013
Hold my hand, please.

1719
02:09:44,877 --> 02:09:48,222
Jaggi, please come up.
I have no one else but you.

1720
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:51,917
Give me your hand.

1721
02:10:19,211 --> 02:10:22,385
Why are you crying?
I'm fine. - Sorry.

1722
02:10:23,148 --> 02:10:24,525
You threw me out of your house,
didn't you?

1723
02:10:25,851 --> 02:10:27,057
I helped you today.

1724
02:10:27,886 --> 02:10:28,330
Thanks.

1725
02:10:28,453 --> 02:10:29,329
Idiot.

1726
02:11:07,159 --> 02:11:08,035
Shall we?

1727
02:11:33,418 --> 02:11:35,455
Did Pinky forgive me?

1728
02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:46,341
Sardarji?

1729
02:11:49,534 --> 02:11:50,274
Yes!

1730
02:11:51,403 --> 02:11:52,211
He's done it!

1731
02:11:52,537 --> 02:11:55,017
Mr. Bilal, what would
you like to say about this?

1732
02:11:55,140 --> 02:11:56,346
Did Sardarji fulfill his mission?

1733
02:11:56,441 --> 02:11:59,513
Sardarji fulfilled
his promise! - Yes!

1734
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,921
Sardarji.. - Sardarji..

1735
02:12:04,049 --> 02:12:06,928
Sardarji,
will the wedding happen now?

1736
02:12:07,019 --> 02:12:09,431
Sardarji, will the queen arrive?

1737
02:12:26,605 --> 02:12:27,675
Have you forgotten something?

1738
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:44,430
Pindky. Pindky.

1739
02:12:49,728 --> 02:12:51,002
Pindky.

1740
02:12:53,098 --> 02:12:54,042
Hello, Pindky.

1741
02:12:55,534 --> 02:12:57,707
What are you doing here? Leave.

1742
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:01,415
LWill.

1743
02:13:02,441 --> 02:13:04,079
Let me look first.

1744
02:13:05,277 --> 02:13:07,518
I might never come
back to England again.

1745
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:11,323
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about the castle.

1746
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:12,994
Why don't you leave?

1747
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:14,995
Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?

1748
02:13:15,554 --> 02:13:16,760
Why are you hiding your feelings?

1749
02:13:17,556 --> 02:13:18,660
I have no feelings.

1750
02:13:19,191 --> 02:13:20,499
And I don't need to hide them.

1751
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:24,331
If this is how ghosts behave with
me, then my business will be doomed.

1752
02:13:26,031 --> 02:13:28,170
Ghosts and witches are
mere business for you, right?

1753
02:13:29,134 --> 02:13:30,306
Nothing more than that.

1754
02:13:31,036 --> 02:13:33,141
You don't care about
anyone's feelings.

1755
02:13:34,506 --> 02:13:36,486
You've got what you wanted.

1756
02:13:38,110 --> 02:13:42,252
You're a witch for namesake.
You behave just like any other girl.

1757
02:13:43,348 --> 02:13:44,691
Stop beating around the bush.

1758
02:13:45,083 --> 02:13:47,393
Can't you simply say that
you feel like coming with me?

1759
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:51,565
You won't take me along anyway.

1760
02:14:03,668 --> 02:14:04,612
Are you sure?

1761
02:14:09,808 --> 02:14:10,752
Jaggfl

1762
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,155
JQQQL let go of me!

1763
02:14:23,321 --> 02:14:24,163
JQQQL let go of me!

1764
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:25,064
Were you always this heavy..

1765
02:14:25,157 --> 02:14:26,329
...or did you put on weight
after becoming a witch?

1766
02:14:26,425 --> 02:14:27,233
Shut up!

1767
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:30,265
I'm going to teach you
a lesson in the village.

1768
02:14:32,264 --> 02:14:34,107
Very funny! - Quiet.

1769
02:14:34,266 --> 02:14:35,074
Photographs.

1770
02:14:35,267 --> 02:14:37,304
Smile.

1771
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:41,214
What happened? - What happened?

1772
02:14:43,375 --> 02:14:44,547
The ghost has been exercised.

1773
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:46,453
Everything is under control.

1774
02:14:50,449 --> 02:14:52,258
The field is clear.
I repeat, it's clear.

1775
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:54,091
Just waiting for the
arrival of Her Highness.

1776
02:14:54,286 --> 02:14:55,458
Sardarji has done it.

1777
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:08,639
Ladies and gentlemen..

1778
02:15:08,733 --> 02:15:10,440
Her Royal Highness. - Highness.

1779
02:15:12,871 --> 02:15:16,683
Greetings, Sardarji.
- Greetings, aunt.

1780
02:15:16,775 --> 02:15:19,187
Young man, you saved our honor.

1781
02:15:19,478 --> 02:15:22,459
If there is anything
I can do for you? Anything.

1782
02:15:22,714 --> 02:15:25,285
Anything? - Anything means anything.

1783
02:15:26,418 --> 02:15:30,457
You took something from
us a long time ago. Return it.

1784
02:15:31,723 --> 02:15:34,431
Oh, really? What is it?

1785
02:15:36,528 --> 02:15:38,701
The Kohinoor. - Oh.

1786
02:15:43,435 --> 02:15:44,573
Think about it, aunt.

1787
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:49,448
So, Richard.

1788
02:15:50,308 --> 02:15:52,310
No, buddy. Ravinder Bakshi.

1789
02:15:52,677 --> 02:15:54,281
I've learnt a lot from you.

1790
02:15:57,415 --> 02:15:59,361
Stop hiding your
face and go and dance.

1791
02:15:59,451 --> 02:16:00,452
You're the son-in-law of the family.

1792
02:16:06,825 --> 02:16:09,169
Jaggi, you did it.

1793
02:16:09,661 --> 02:16:11,436
She still talks weirdly.

1794
02:16:40,625 --> 02:16:42,764
Wow! - She's pretty!

1795
02:16:43,228 --> 02:16:45,265
The queen is beautiful.

1796
02:16:51,403 --> 02:16:53,679
The milk is lukewarm.

1797
02:16:54,606 --> 02:16:57,712
It's a steel glass.
We might burn our tongues.

1798
02:16:57,876 --> 02:16:59,549
Here, you drink the first half.

1799
02:17:01,646 --> 02:17:05,423
I can't control myself.
Once I start drinking, I can't stop.

1800
02:17:09,354 --> 02:17:13,268
Why did Chundi keep it here? He's
trying to be an interior decorator.

1801
02:17:15,827 --> 02:17:17,397
So sweet!

1802
02:17:17,862 --> 02:17:19,864
Drink it.
Drink milk to your heart's content.

1803
02:17:20,632 --> 02:17:22,009
What am I going to do now?

1804
02:17:22,734 --> 02:17:24,839
You would run after me in England.

1805
02:17:25,036 --> 02:17:28,882
Birthday celebrations,
pancakes, the band guys"

1806
02:17:28,974 --> 02:17:30,954
Everyone has to get married
and settle down eventually.

1807
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:33,745
I can't be flirting all my life.

1808
02:17:33,845 --> 02:17:34,653
Did you say something?

1809
02:17:34,946 --> 02:17:37,825
I will drink the other half.
Leave some milk for me.

1810
02:17:39,918 --> 02:17:42,592
You're not ashamed, are you?
- I'm not.

1811
02:17:42,887 --> 02:17:45,629
I'm not a guest here. I'm the groom.

1812
02:17:45,724 --> 02:17:48,534
Jaggi, I don't understand
what you're saying.

1813
02:17:48,927 --> 02:17:50,838
Darling, these are romantic talks.

1814
02:17:50,929 --> 02:17:53,307
You'll understand them gradually.

1815
02:17:53,932 --> 02:17:54,910
Go.

1816
02:17:56,001 --> 02:17:57,810
Why should I go?
I'll sit right here.

1817
02:17:57,969 --> 02:18:01,439
Jaggi, take off my veil.

1818
02:18:02,607 --> 02:18:04,484
Hold on, Jasmine. I will.

1819
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:06,751
We have all night.

1820
02:18:07,912 --> 02:18:10,791
I'll take you around the
village tomorrow morning. - No.

1821
02:18:11,449 --> 02:18:13,690
I feel homesick.

1822
02:18:14,653 --> 02:18:15,688
Talk to me.

1823
02:18:20,859 --> 02:18:25,330
"Every night in my dreams."

1824
02:18:25,764 --> 02:18:31,476
"I see you. I feel you."

1825
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:35,679
Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

1826
02:18:50,855 --> 02:18:53,096
Jasmine. Jasmine.

1827
02:18:55,794 --> 02:18:56,864
Jasmine"

1828
02:18:58,797 --> 02:18:59,639
Are you sure?

1829
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,776
Pindky.

1830
02:19:04,703 --> 02:19:05,511
Sweetheart.

1831
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:16,652
"My beloved looks beautiful."

1832
02:19:17,849 --> 02:19:19,988
"My beloved.."

1833
02:19:22,887 --> 02:19:25,561
"When you fall in
love with a Jatt.."

1834
02:19:25,623 --> 02:19:28,866
"..keep this in mind."

1835
02:19:31,062 --> 02:19:34,373
"When you fall in
love with a Jatt.."

1836
02:19:34,466 --> 02:19:37,106
"..keep this in mind."

1837
02:19:37,168 --> 02:19:41,378
"He follows just two things."

1838
02:19:42,874 --> 02:19:46,378
"He can't live without his beloved."

1839
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:49,015
"He resists on a Thursday."

1840
02:19:49,147 --> 02:19:52,060
"He can't live without his beloved."

1841
02:19:52,183 --> 02:19:55,062
"He resists on a Thursday."

1842
02:19:57,422 --> 02:20:00,562
"The complexion is dusky.."

1843
02:20:00,658 --> 02:20:03,036
"..but beautiful."

1844
02:20:03,128 --> 02:20:06,575
"I've lost my slumber."

1845
02:20:06,664 --> 02:20:09,508
"I only keep thinking about you."

1846
02:20:09,667 --> 02:20:12,773
"He doesn't follow horoscopes."

1847
02:20:12,871 --> 02:20:15,852
"A Jatt has a lot
of principles in life."

1848
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:18,716
"What the world
is afraid of doing.."

1849
02:20:18,877 --> 02:20:22,484
"..he does it every day."

1850
02:20:22,747 --> 02:20:27,719
"He's not scared of anything."

1851
02:20:28,853 --> 02:20:32,062
"He can't live without his beloved."

1852
02:20:32,157 --> 02:20:35,001
"He resists on a Thursday."

1853
02:20:35,093 --> 02:20:38,006
"He can't live without his beloved."

1854
02:20:38,096 --> 02:20:41,077
"He resists on a Thursday."

1855
02:20:41,166 --> 02:20:44,010
"He can't live without his beloved."

1856
02:20:44,102 --> 02:20:46,878
"He resists on a Thursday."

1857
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:49,884
"He can't live without his beloved."

1858
02:20:49,974 --> 02:20:53,012
"He resists on a Thursday."
