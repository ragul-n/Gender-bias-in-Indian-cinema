00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:22,644
Years ago, in southern Kerala,
a marriage in a remote village...

2
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,755
Mayilathamma, Mayilathamma, come come...
come soon. They've arrived.

3
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,046
Muthulakshmi....

4
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,912
lndira chechi(Sister), my son...

5
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,953
Don't think about anything now.
lt is great fortune.

6
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,053
Still.....

7
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,395
Say no more you are a widow

8
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:14,290
You've no way to live.
When time comes,

9
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,298
l'll tell him everything.

10
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,802
He is a man who understands.
So forthe time being,

11
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,805
keep aside the thoughts of your son.

12
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,470
Anyway, he is a boy.

13
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,571
Wow! Good smell! Janu chechi,
why yellow rice is prepared today?

14
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,976
Wedding of someone?

15
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,153
You like yellow rice very much.

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,478
lsn't it? Eat your bellyful.

17
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,496
Janu chechi(Sister), l am going to my mother.
l feel sleepy.

18
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,823
At this part of night? Don't go now.

19
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,826
Come, Janu chechi will give you a present.

20
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,492
See this...a new dress.

21
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,666
What happened?
- ls he asleep?

22
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,841
Just slept.

23
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,510
Oh! Goddess saved!
They are just leaving.

24
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,504
Oh! God!

25
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,891
l don't like, l don't like
- Son what do you say?

26
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,722
That is your mother.

27
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:51,722
Selvam!

28
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,558
Go away. l don't want to see you.

29
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,737
When my son Rajaselvam was

30
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,574
two years old, his motherJanaki died.

31
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,909
God takes back good persons soon.

32
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,086
A motherfor selvam,
ljust wanted that.

33
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,654
lt is not because l wished a second marriage.

34
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,329
From today Muthulakshmi,
you should become his mother.

35
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,330
Who?

36
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,212
Who are you?

37
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,111
What do you want?

38
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,119
Varghese, who is this boy?

39
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:52,950
That is...

40
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,691
My mother is inside. Call her.

41
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:58,960
Your mother?

42
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,464
Yes l saw. Call her.

43
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,471
Muthulakshmi!

44
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:18,813
Mother!

45
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,482
Do you know him?

46
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,755
No.

47
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,165
ls this your mother?

48
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,335
Yes.

49
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,672
Don't you know him?

50
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,784
Telling lies?

51
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,749
Knocking at the door after walking
all the distance at night, it is sure

52
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,683
You've given birth to him.

53
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,019
Besides, he is not old enough to insult you.

54
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,206
Where to?

55
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:21,872
l am going.

56
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,883
You've come here without my permission

57
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,979
but if you want to go back you must get it.

58
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,553
You are a smart boy.

59
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,325
What's your name?

60
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,561
My mother calls me Muthu.
Now l don't want that name.

61
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,122
You are not Muthu

62
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,901
Hereafteryou are Manikyam! Rajamanikyam!

63
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,596
You've given me everything l requested.

64
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,935
This is my great wish,

65
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,871
l request for admission for engineering
for my Kanakambaram.

66
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,044
You must fulfill my request.

67
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,618
Chechi, it is getting late.
lf we delay further....

68
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,619
lt's all right even if we are late.

69
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,722
Don't worry about anything when
Muthulakshmi amma(Mother) is there.

70
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,897
Malli, how are you?
- l am fine grandma.

71
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,728
You give wedding feast soon.

72
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,572
Aha! Malli? l don't see you now-a-days

73
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,571
Amma(Mother), l don't get spare time
from flower market.

74
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,574
Forthis girl there is no time after studying.

75
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,242
Good l am happy.

76
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,346
Varghese.
-Yes!

77
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,243
You ring up and find out whether
everyone has come for meeting.

78
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,253
Here...

79
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,085
Aren't there servants here to prepare this?

80
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,589
Why you do it unnecessarily?
- That can be after my death.

81
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,194
Whatever l say this is your reply always.

82
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,763
Just wait and see. Even after our death,

83
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,435
the people of this place will remember us.

84
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,006
l know you don't like it.
But l like it.

85
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,943
See, Malli and Kanakambaram have come.

86
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,208
What is the matter?

87
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,541
She wants a seat in our engineering college.

88
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,449
She is a good student.

89
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:24,286
Not only that, when they come here
and request for something,

90
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,455
how can we refuse it?

91
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,552
Who are all these?

92
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,463
Yes. Come...Come

93
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,464
l heard that Malli has taken on lease
all the flower gardens in Udayakovil.

94
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,471
Not like that, only some.

95
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,476
Yes. You prosper. Let my flower man
Sankaran's daughters prosperthis way.

96
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,145
Everyone has arrived there.

97
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,918
Yes, Varghese, you keep those certificates.

98
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,045
l'll tell Ramesh about the admission.

99
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,653
He is in charge of the college.

100
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,320
l will go now.

101
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,829
Blessings for a bright future.

102
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:11,166
So, as a result of our prayers and hard work,

103
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,403
Thiruvengadam business group got sanction
from Govt. for starting a medical college.

104
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,653
We don't want any profit from selling needles

105
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,788
and threads meant for operations.
Nor by selling the organs of the patients.

106
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,661
Free treatment forthe poor.

107
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,995
Free education for poor students.

108
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,334
Remaining profit,

109
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:50,571
l want to give as monthly pension for all
retired employees of my institutions.

110
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,911
Long ago, l started a tea stall in the foreyard
of Udayakoil Temple with Rs.500/-.

111
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,317
lt was in my father's name
'Thiruvengadam Tea Stall'.

112
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,418
Then, followed by a lot of institutions.

113
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,591
For everything, name was Thiruvengadam.

114
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:12,754
But there is a specialty for
this new institution.

115
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:19,933
lt is not in my father's name but in
the name of my wife Muthulakshmi.

116
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,441
Muthulakshmi lnstitute of Medical Science!

117
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,012
l decided this not for anything else.

118
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,113
l had only prosperity after her coming.

119
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,119
But for her, only tears.

120
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,453
Now another specialty.

121
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,786
This is the last attempt in my business life.

122
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:43,962
lt is enough.

123
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:49,457
So the foundation stone ceremony
on the 10th should be grand.

124
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,966
We must make it grand.

125
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,397
lt will be grand.

126
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,173
l am Rajaselvam. This proprietor's only son.

127
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,184
ln your language, the prodigal son.

128
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,114
l did not call any son here.

129
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,687
lt is long time since decisions are
made after consulting everyone.

130
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,358
Son, don't want, don't want it here.

131
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,355
You old man stand aside.

132
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,924
When people like me collected money

133
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,597
from pawn brokers for
interest and tried to

134
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,426
get sanction forthe hospital
to earn some money,

135
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,759
there also preference for
Thiruvengadam Group!

136
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,930
Ok. Let it be, but one thing.

137
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,602
Forthe institution you are starting,

138
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,704
it's not the name of your living wife,

139
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,274
it should be in the name
of my dead mother

140
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,878
''Janakiammal lnstitute of medical science''

141
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,383
Let it be a memorial for remembering
my mothertill your death.

142
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,782
To rememberyour mother,
there is a living memorial

143
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,285
a cursed memorial... you.

144
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,122
l know to correct myself. Get lost.

145
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,387
Then it is so. Listen if you don't want

146
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,895
my mother's name, you put the name
of any street dog l'll bear,

147
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,864
But that woman,

148
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,800
if your plan is to put that dirty woman's
name forthis charitable institution

149
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,577
then what you said earlier
''this is the last attempt''

150
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,140
it will become true. LAST attempt.

151
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:15,577
lt will not work out even if l have to die.
l won't allow.

152
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,322
l am a ruined person.
l'll destroy everything.

153
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,860
Hi brother! What happened?

154
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,695
Going back as soon as you came.

155
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,371
You must've got it written completely isn't it?

156
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,475
ls anything kept forthis second one born
to Muthulakshmi?

157
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,301
Go away.

158
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,641
Ha! Why going like this brother?
Go aftertelling.

159
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,974
Otherwise no need.

160
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,150
l'll say. The institution will be
in my mother's name.

161
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,577
Management rights for me.

162
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,045
l'll decide which beggars are
to be given the dividend.

163
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,823
l'll give one share to you also.

164
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,152
You will make me eat the remains
kept for some beggars. lsn't it?

165
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,157
Hey, you! Selvam, leave her.

166
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,725
Hey, she has seen only husband like you
who is neither a man nor a woman.

167
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,668
l have come prepared. ln the meantime
if you stand against me...

168
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,665
Certainly l'll obstruct,

169
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,829
lf you want to beat me, you've to be born again.
Otherwise l should die.

170
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,841
l want to win. Even if l've to kill you forthat,
it's alright. l'll kill.

171
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,843
To defeat me if you take the side of my
fatherto make your mother richer,

172
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:17,743
l'll kill everyone.

173
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,678
Stop it.

174
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,644
lf there is bullet inside you shoot me.

175
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,883
Two blunders

176
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,783
l've made! One in the form of a man
and the otherthat of a woman.

177
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,894
lf this is due to the arrogance
of being my children, no need of it.

178
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,226
From today, l don't have such children.

179
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,397
What are you telling?

180
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,566
Then why such children?

181
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,335
lsn't it due to the property?

182
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,733
lf they were children of a pauper, they would've
worked and earned forfood.

183
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,809
One thing l tell you.

184
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:55,583
lf they come there to obstruct
the function on the 10th,

185
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,915
l'll forget the sentiments.

186
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,253
Come.

187
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,435
Hasn't the Governor started?

188
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,935
Started already Sir.

189
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,267
He has arrived.

190
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,449
What! What's the problem?

191
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,852
Sir, a bomb blasted at that place.

192
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:34,949
Turn back. Hurry up.

193
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,645
These are all sample bombs.

194
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,318
lt's a forewarning before trying
the most powerful one.

195
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,654
l said it will not happen.
lt didn't happen.

196
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,330
The blow hit right on my father's head.

197
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,499
Good morning! Alagesan.

198
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,666
Oh! l you've ruined.
Bomb blasted like children's crackers.

199
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,243
The bomb should've shattered
the whole village.

200
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,347
With that he and his hospital
should've been destroyed.

201
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,677
Selvam, it was only people
who ran away.

202
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,683
lt wasn't yourfather Rajarathnam Pillai.

203
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,515
Now, this Alagesan has come
with his coterie

204
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,692
For reprimanding or standing by us?

205
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:47,355
Playing politics it was he who said he'll get
sanction for a medical college here.

206
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:54,028
Believing him, l've taken crores from
Pandi pawn brokers.

207
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:59,376
Those crores changed into foreign currency
& reached Germany for hospital equipments.

208
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,547
So Alagesa, l tell you one thing,

209
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:08,375
if he starts to build the charitable
institution without any formalities,

210
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,549
the work for 3 of us will increase.

211
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,554
Those who gave us money
will make trouble us. That's all.

212
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,727
Hey, don't speak foolishly. Shut up.

213
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,386
When the by-election result comes tomorrow,

214
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,896
Alagesan will be minister,
Health minister.

215
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,731
l'll decide who should build
and who should not.

216
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:32,070
l'll tearthe sanctioned papers into
pieces and crush under my feet.

217
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:38,948
This Alagesan will build a no.1 Hospital
in Asia here.

218
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,243
lf it doesn't happen

219
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,752
l'll throw away this khadar dress & wash
Rajarathnam Pillai's underwear.

220
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,660
After making yourfather ashamed
before the villagers,

221
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,529
you are celebrating in this cemetery?
lsn't it?

222
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,768
See, don't want these things here.

223
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,094
This is Simon Nadar's ground.

224
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,436
Good for nothing. Doing cashew-nut
business yourfather reached here

225
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,102
And married a Nadar woman. Did he get this
ground then as dowry?

226
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,774
No, you made it by teaching
my son crookedness

227
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,112
And by pimping this political leader.

228
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,948
You are belittling me before my people.

229
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,283
lf you say such things...

230
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,619
You who washes the underwear
of ruling ladies!

231
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,455
Hey, beat him and send him away.

232
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:29,460
l will shoot, whether it is my son, minister
or anyone, it's the same for me.

233
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,962
Hey, Simon Nadar!

234
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,802
When my son beat and killed a boy
in a playground you clapped

235
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,239
and encouraged him. You came into
his life as a shadow of disaster.

236
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,977
lf you, such a mean person, grown
enough to blast a bomb in my chest,

237
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,650
l've come to see that growth personally.

238
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:51,050
And, to invite all of you forthe foundation
stone ceremony of the hospital.

239
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,048
lt will take place on the 3rd
day with much splendor.

240
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,825
You must come with most
powerful bomb in the country.

241
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,496
Hey, to win over Rajarathnam Pillai
in business,

242
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,993
neither is your growth enough noryour age.

243
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:23,882
Elders! Ladies! Our leader Alagesan is on
the way to see you who voted for him.

244
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:29,220
He'll serve you from today.

245
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:36,732
Sir, please help. l want to go to hospital.
What a crowd!

246
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,899
Get in. - Thank you very much.
-Varghese, take the car.

247
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,237
l've win.

248
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,919
Oh my God!? Boss...

249
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,757
He's the killer, don't leave him.

250
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,598
Boss, You've gone making us orphans.

251
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,166
Come out.

252
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:25,444
Hang the killer! Rajarathnam Pillai.

253
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,119
Don't do anything to him,
he is a good man.

254
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,285
On the basis of witnesses and evidence

255
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,626
and considering the good name
among the public of the deceased,

256
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:40,628
This court orders to keep the accused
Rajarathnam Pillai in remand for 14 days.

257
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:48,305
Please don't punish him...leave him,
leave him...

258
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,305
Respected court should not mistrust me.

259
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,304
lt is not me who's done it.

260
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,541
This is an act of treachery by some
persons to defeat me.

261
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:03,312
l'll accept any punishment
if the court finds me guilty.

262
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,487
Just one day...
tomorrow l may be allowed.

263
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,485
This is my request.

264
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,560
l am defeated.

265
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,838
You and your laws defeated me.

266
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,168
l'll bring you out even if l've
to make any sacrifice.

267
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:29,679
What's the use?
Even if 10,000 years are allowed,

268
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,509
its value will not be equal as
fortomorrow just one day

269
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,026
Why did you come here?

270
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,028
Didn't l tell you l don't need anything.

271
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,034
This is all forthat reason

272
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,069
l've seen yourtears only

273
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,870
Don't want, not only foryou.

274
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,371
For me also. Nothing.

275
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,975
Our children have grown up
enough to win over us.

276
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,147
Now to punish us also.

277
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:14,722
Sir, nothing will happen to you.
l am also here.

278
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,898
Why are you crying?

279
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,966
Varghese has slept only where you were.

280
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,298
l wish to come with you.

281
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,735
Hang Rajarathnam Pillai.

282
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,401
Forthat you are not the
defendant....lt's me.

283
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,414
Don't you hearthe slogan
against the killer?

284
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:50,585
Hang Rajarathnam Pillai.
- Move...make a move.

285
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:51,428
Move on.

286
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:03,438
Didn't l say give way?
You won't obey?

287
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,276
Hang murderer Rajarathnam Pillai.
- Move on.

288
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,174
l Rajarathnam Pillai, son of
Thiruvengadam Rajasekharan Pillai

289
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,175
Attest the will written in my
own handwriting the properties

290
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:36,662
immovable and moveable in my ownership
are entitled to my son Rajaselvam,

291
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,867
my second wife Muthulakshmi and
to Rani Rathna, daughter born to her.

292
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,544
While this fact exists, after my death...

293
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:12,467
Authorize another person all the ownership
& rights for management for 25 years.

294
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:20,233
He will manage and enjoy the
properties till the time expires.

295
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,078
Afterthat he will decide

296
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,410
how and to whom it to the shared.

297
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,419
Stop it . His reading of the Will!

298
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,421
So that father of mine died after leaving
the entire property to someone?

299
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,084
Hey, tell me, which son of a bitch
is going to rule me.

300
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,565
l won't leave you with out telling it.

301
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,935
A bullock traderfrom Bellary,
Karnataka state.

302
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,768
His name is Raja. Bellary Raja.

303
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,076
We caught the man.

304
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,482
When our Kintel gave him a blow on
his stomach that pig said everything.

305
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,154
Hey, you veterinary doctor speak out.

306
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,654
Sir, don't do anything to me.
l am a poor vet doctor.

307
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,860
What sir? - Move to the right side.

308
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:53,698
Sir, spare me. lt was me who injected
and killed your 300 bullocks.

309
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,705
l did it because that Chamiar
told me to do it.

310
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,209
Hey, what's all this?

311
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,544
Bellary Raja.

312
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:15,048
Not Bellary Raja. Elloori Raja.
- l've come to pick out your bones.

313
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:21,725
What? First beating.
Then talking. Come.

314
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,732
What l've done is wrong.
Here after l won't do anything.

315
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:43,397
To do anything, you need
to be alive first, you Chamiar.

316
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:52,646
You know l started my trade in Bellary
with just 6 Bullocks and 3 cards.

317
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,886
Now l've not 6 but 6000 loads'
business you hear?

318
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:59,716
lf you try anything again, you fool.
l'll crush you under my feet.

319
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,050
What did you think?

320
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,727
You thought that if you give money
to the vet to kill my 300 bullocks,

321
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:07,887
by injecting anthrax, l'll close
my business and go to Kasi?

322
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,226
Phew! You are wrong.

323
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:17,401
You know l invited all my business
dealers from outside,

324
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,501
and gave them a big feast
of 30 vessels of biriyani.

325
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,182
Whatever it is, since you made me
come here.

326
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,851
l'll go only after shutting your business
and taking the keys.

327
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:32,011
Rajutta make him hand over his
entire earning to us.

328
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,521
Anthrax, Kunthrax! His mothers....

329
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,354
Phew....can't get over my anger.
Get lost.

330
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,413
How generous some people are!

331
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,611
To authorize someone to look after all
his earning after his death!

332
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,285
For 25 years means...

333
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:05,945
that too all those institutions,
but what about our business here?

334
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:10,287
That's true. But this is written
in the Will.

335
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,462
That too, by such a great man...

336
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,464
Say something.

337
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,795
l must go. No other way.

338
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:24,134
Whenever he came to this hill,
he had called me but l didn't go.

339
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,642
l didn't know that his last visit
would be such...

340
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,313
Manickam!

341
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,444
Why at this time. Without informing?

342
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:41,114
Long ago one midnight you knocked
at my door.

343
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,953
Was it after informing me?

344
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:47,828
Another midnight, you ran away
without informing me...

345
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,330
That was also covering
your left eye which has lost sight.

346
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,245
What happened now to talk of old stories.

347
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,984
Not only old stories.

348
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,354
l've new stories also to tell. Come.

349
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:21,031
l may be rich in wealth but
poor in mental peace.

350
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,200
l am fed up. Can't go on like this.

351
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,235
Those two greedy children are never
satisfied whatever l give them.

352
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:32,068
Quarreling overthe properly they
took the gun in front of me.

353
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,541
lf they fight like this,

354
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:38,716
whatever l've earned all these years
will go to someone else.

355
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,042
That's certain.

356
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,151
Even if you are not my blood relation,
you are the only son l've.

357
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:50,689
You've filled my heart with love
though you are farfrom me.

358
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:56,022
But l didn't get it from
my own children.

359
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,566
l couldn't teach them that but you can.

360
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,469
They must learn at least by seeing you.

361
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:13,381
l've great wish to see them both
live as siblings before l die.

362
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,212
Not because l've lost my vigour.

363
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:22,548
But l feel that you must be with me in future.

364
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,562
When l see the turmoil,
l've an innerfear of death.

365
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,692
What's the reason to think like that?

366
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,932
Father, your wish will be fulfilled.

367
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,766
lf any necessity arises am l not here?

368
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,805
Are you staying here or want to go?
- Today l stay with you.

369
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,584
Go and bring dragging that woman.

370
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,757
What's it? Why all of you've come?

371
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,897
Before that bullock trader comes & takes
overthe charge,

372
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,128
l wanted to do some work.

373
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,264
This is my father's chair.

374
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:12,773
From today this son will sit on it.
l am enough forthis palace.

375
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,274
The rest can go out.

376
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,850
Leave her. l say leave her.

377
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,014
Beggars like you have
no rights to touch her.

378
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,587
Leave heryou dogs.

379
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,094
l wished forthis moment from the day
you came here as my father's bride.

380
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,942
Just as l expected junior proprietor has started
a cleansing work.

381
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,449
Mother, are you going out on your own
or are you being sent out?

382
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,779
Either way, it is your wish.

383
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,456
But this daughter's wish is to
stay here from today.

384
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,788
You can enter if you want to lie
on your back,

385
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,961
wrapped in new clothes
with camphor burning near.

386
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,960
Camphor and new clothes will suit also,
not only for her.

387
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,796
Don't stand watching.
Beat and make them flee.

388
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,112
Hey! Don't show such mean tactics.

389
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,256
lt is common to have differences of opinion
between mother & children.

390
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,424
Forthat you don't have to push your mother.

391
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,187
Who are you to come here and talk
about justice and injustice?

392
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,022
l am only a passer by.

393
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,529
But lf l see fighting,
l will interfere, brother.

394
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,530
This is this boss's philosophy.

395
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,363
He will interfere whenever he sees fighting.

396
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,671
Hey! Do you act like this when we talk
important matters...

397
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,141
Dasappa...

398
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,866
Brother, is it right to beat and send out those
who have come to settle the quarrel.

399
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:24,700
Then we will push and send you out.

400
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,876
Push both of them out.

401
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,380
Hey! Don't press the throat.
l will die.

402
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,210
lt seems we will go reverse and reach
the same place from where we started.

403
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,048
Phew! The advocate has come,
what a relief!

404
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,554
What happened?
Any trouble?

405
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,727
No such thing, just an introduction
after coming.

406
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,728
With their help his specs
is lying on the ladder.

407
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,560
There it is.

408
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,735
Selvam, what rowdyism
are you all doing?

409
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,568
l know how to behave with those
who come here.

410
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,573
That can be after knowing the
greatness of the man.

411
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,747
You know who is this?
Bellary Raja!

412
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,754
Hereafter, he is the rightful heirfor all
the properties of Rajarathnam Pillai.

413
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,088
That is it.

414
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,764
Advocate is a tiger, you see.

415
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,263
Then, advocate how are the things?

416
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,765
Who are all these? What? How?

417
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,938
This is Rajarathinam Pillai's
son Rajaselvam.

418
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,107
ls it? He is also a tiger, you see.

419
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,435
You will soon know whether
l am a tiger or a bullock.

420
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,271
Pew! But there is one thing.

421
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:40,176
Both of them something hanging
behind them...tail! tail!

422
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,786
Then, go on advocate.
This is daughter Rani Rathna.

423
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,954
ls it?

424
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,621
This is Muthulakshmi Amma,
Rajarathnam Pillai's...-Yes...

425
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,452
l am Varghese, manager of this house.

426
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,457
Then, let the managertell.

427
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,458
Just tell.

428
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,962
Do all these people live here?

429
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,135
No. Mother is here.
The others live separately.

430
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,636
Phew! Then why quarrel.
Let things be as it is.

431
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,966
Why not? Let it be as it is.

432
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,142
That is it. Why not!

433
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:09,402
Then don't waste time.
All of you go home before it rains.

434
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,472
Disburse everybody. - Otherwise we will have
to start shooting at the sky.

435
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,481
Disburse everyone.

436
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,947
Go away, Go away.

437
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,158
Hey you come here.
l want to ask ...

438
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,496
ls it monthly wages foryou?

439
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,289
That is l get Rs.75/-for one blow.

440
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,830
The hospital expenses extra.

441
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,667
ls it? But don't take money for
beating we give free.

442
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,848
Now only it has become OK

443
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,676
Just as we say a sword fighter
will fall by a sword,

444
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,011
so will a cooling glass fighter
by a cooling glass.

445
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,690
A bullock trader! A pucca
bullock trader!

446
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:58,191
Cooling glass is his weakness.
He wears it even while sleeping.

447
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,855
lt seems yesterday,
as soon as he came,

448
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,691
he showed some magic
with his cooling glass.

449
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:05,697
l doubt that he is an imposter.

450
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,536
Otherwise, would Pillai Sir entrust all
his property to such an idiot?

451
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,208
But he came in a Benz car.

452
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,709
These days one can hire
even a Rolls Royce.

453
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,710
What can a mere
bullock merchant do,

454
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,213
where Rajarathnam pillai
himself was defeated?

455
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:25,813
Excuse me. l am Raju.

456
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,724
l am Dasappan.
We came with Bellary Raja.

457
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,727
Where is he?

458
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,334
He will come. Before that we want to
change this set up.

459
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,399
All of you sitting on the left side
go to the right side.

460
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,571
Why this change?

461
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,741
All these years we've been sitting like this
for round table meeting.

462
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,409
Then only we can see face to face
and speak.

463
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,406
That maybe foryou.

464
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,738
But he who is going to come now
has to see all yourfaces.

465
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,574
So sit there.
- l won't move...

466
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,077
Get up...get up...
Take it on your head.

467
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,583
Playing with us...

468
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,258
Ready boss...please come on.

469
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,762
Greetings..

470
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,940
What wondering?
Bullock trader!

471
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:33,720
Sit down, don't we all say this fool
has won the lottery?

472
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,221
The same story here.

473
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,886
To tell the truth, this is the first time
l am attending a congress.

474
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,324
Not congress sir... conference.

475
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:47,835
Oh! Yes, to tell the truth,
l studied only second standard.

476
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,165
l don't know any language
otherthan Malayalam.

477
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,171
What to say? l am ignorant.

478
00:41:54,044 --> 00:42:00,005
But one thing this boy speaks
English fluently.

479
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,013
He is M.B.B.S.

480
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,683
Not M.B.B.S., MBA.

481
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:07,182
Whatever. Leave it.
So long as you speak English.

482
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,693
Now, let us talk.

483
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,692
That is not a spittoon. lt's an ash-tray.

484
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,695
O! l understood Sir.

485
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,373
Today l'll adjust with this.

486
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,173
Here afteryou bring
spittoon from home.

487
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:31,044
Not only for me, we can all sit around,
spit and play.

488
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:41,818
Varkicha, he is a tiger.
No not just a tiger, a lion!

489
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:47,723
Now let's do one thing.
We'll finish that work first.

490
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:53,233
l mean the work of foundation stone.
All this trouble was due to that.

491
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,564
So, all of you co-operate.

492
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,401
l will deal with the rest of the
arrangements later. What, Varkicha?

493
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,576
Sure.

494
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,746
To fulfill Pillai sir's wish, we will be
with you day and night.

495
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,411
But do you think those children
will keep quiet?

496
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,074
He died just because they didn't
keep quiet, isn't it Varkicha?

497
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,253
Yes.

498
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,921
Leave it. Silly cases.

499
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,131
So, the foundation stone ceremony
on the fourth day.

500
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,396
No change in name.

501
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,833
Ownership and managing rights
are for me.

502
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,169
Anotherthing, change the chief guest
who came last time.

503
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,746
He is a coward.
We want ''Amma'' instead.

504
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,572
Amma?

505
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,408
Yes. Who is 'Amma' in Tamilnadu?

506
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,084
Oh! Chief MinisterJayalalitha.

507
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,254
Whew! You said it.
Your stomach is full of brains!!

508
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,751
lf she is there, the security tigers
are sure to come.

509
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,427
They won't stop to see.

510
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,258
Even if somebody sneezes,
they'll start shooting.

511
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,432
How's my brain?

512
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,937
Then invite everybody. Tell everyone.

513
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,432
Then let the work begin in style.

514
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,439
Rajutta, anything else to say?
- Nothing more.

515
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,941
Then we'll go.

516
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,943
Yes. The congress is dissolved.

517
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:11,811
All go go go...

518
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,874
Hey, you, come here.
l want to ask something

519
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,079
What?
- ls it monthly or daily wages foryou?

520
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,286
l don't understand.

521
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,617
Oh, you don't understand, is it?

522
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,797
l'll blow your head off, if you show
such tactics.

523
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,464
Varghese Sir, what is his department?

524
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:33,634
Finance manager.

525
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:39,465
Whatever manager he may be give his wages
and dismiss him today itself.

526
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:46,310
He and his mobile! Get lost.

527
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,821
When Pillai sir was there,

528
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:55,220
we have done money transactions from his
account many times without his knowledge.

529
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,688
But now...

530
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,361
One thing is certain.

531
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,860
That bullock trader who has come to
rule sure knows his job.

532
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,533
Account freezing means still dead freezing.

533
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:09,294
Attached civil court order and that bullock
trader's direct entry.

534
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,238
How smart he is!

535
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,373
Don't waste time, praising him.

536
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,705
Tell me if there is any way to
reopen the account.

537
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:21,542
Not at all. Neitherforyou norforyour
lifelong enemy Rani Rathna.

538
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:28,353
As far as l know you're still under
the influence of Saturn.

539
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,686
Tomorrow, if he brings chief minister
Jayalalitha here,

540
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,691
and gets the claps of the people,

541
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,696
and finishes the work of foundation stone,
then your life is a waste.

542
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,697
On top of that, this account freezing!

543
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,529
lf our debtors know about this...

544
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,036
No. before that l'll make him
understand.

545
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,868
Then l'll make the people understand
about his death.

546
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,202
l'll kill that pig.

547
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,709
Now you're talking, Selva!

548
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,878
l don't just talk. l do.

549
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:57,213
ln quarrel between father and son about
property rights beating & killing is injustice.

550
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,889
But interference by a stranger is justice!
- That's true.

551
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:10,394
l'll kill him. l'll go home only after
making preparation forthat.

552
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,898
Good night.
-Very very good night.

553
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,406
Start the car.

554
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,733
Where to, Sir?

555
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:26,747
Hey, Haven't l told you before not
to show such tactics?

556
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,577
l have only just arrived.

557
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,583
Don't plan to kill me so soon.

558
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,418
What do you call that written on the screen
when we go to drink tea in theatres?

559
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,752
lnterval.

560
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,757
Ya, that one. Wait at least till that
before you kill me.

561
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,090
Don't play with me. l've seen
many such games before.

562
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:48,261
My dear brother, now l haven't come to play
but to invite you forthe ceremony.

563
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,940
Then l overheard you planning
to kill me.

564
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,769
So l changed my plan also to be
on the safe side.

565
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,275
Varkicha, how is the diesel in the car?
- Full!

566
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,276
Rajutta, what time is that foundation stone
ceremony tomorrow?

567
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,346
Sharp 10 o' clock.
- Then the diesel is enough.

568
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,951
Now if you start straight from here,
it'll suffice forfifteen hours.

569
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,954
You go for sight seeing.

570
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,952
These brothers will give you company.

571
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,456
This Varkichan is not as he appears to be,
he will sing good songs.

572
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,452
This is best tape-recorder.
But it is fixed on a tractor.

573
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:15,857
That's the problem.

574
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,793
Varkicha, take this.
Buy him Bonji if he feels thirsty.

575
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,471
What is bonji?
- Lemon juice.

576
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,138
Varkicha, you must stop the vehicle now
and then for him to pass water.

577
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:25,967
For what?

578
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,470
Oh, that!

579
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,645
Now good going! Right!

580
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,050
Thus that bull got into the car.

581
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,153
Now we can make a grand success
of tomorrow's ceremony.

582
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,654
Watch out! Keep an eye on all sides.

583
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,490
No one should come here
and show off.

584
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,663
lf anyone tries anything,
just teartheir heads off.

585
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,892
Has Kuppan come?

586
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,937
Yes. Our black cats have come
along with him.

587
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,000
Not black cats. 'Bellary cats''.

588
00:47:56,206 --> 00:48:00,506
Look at them standing like the hero & heroine
of 'Titanic' and smoking beedis.

589
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,049
They are standing in the same position
from that time.

590
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,718
Poorthings. Their mothers won't bear it.

591
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:22,227
Mother, get down.

592
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,027
l...

593
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,362
Say no more.

594
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,538
These are all decisions by the man
whom Pillai sir has authorized.

595
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:38,512
So this decision is his also, we should not
stand against it. Get down mother.

596
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,722
Come mother!

597
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,897
What? ls this the 'Amma' you said
will attend the function?

598
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,061
The hospital is in this mother's
(Amma's) name.

599
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,734
So let her inaugurate.

600
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:03,396
We said the other 'Amma' will come,
to keep away the troublemakers.

601
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,235
lt was just a trick. Like some trick of
our bullock trade.

602
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,910
How's our brain? brain! brain!

603
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:22,292
Oh! Everyone has arrived.
Then don't delay.

604
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,753
Rajutta, let the function take place
according to custom.

605
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,190
Mother.

606
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,629
We've come.

607
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,132
Mother Mary! What's this we're seeing?

608
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,137
Selvam sir coming to attend the function!

609
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,810
Of course he is. He has to.

610
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,680
He is a bit late, but
anyway he has come.

611
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,645
As perfather's wish, when the mother
is putting the foundation stone,

612
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,478
the son must be present.
lt is the tradition, isn't it?

613
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,915
lt would've been grand if his daughter
had also come.

614
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,326
Whatever it is, hereafter, you are
enough for us, sir.

615
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,326
You are a tiger.

616
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,658
Not tiger Madhavetta,
a 'Titanic' Tiger,

617
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,666
Then Rajutta, Varkicha,
without wasting time,

618
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,966
start blasting the Bellary bombs.

619
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,223
Rustic music, songs
and dance....

620
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,899
Rhythmic drumbeats,
Accompaniments

621
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,728
Rejoice... singing rural idylls!

622
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,280
He is a lion, is our leader

623
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,629
On either side, the cattle run shaking their bells.

624
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:25,473
Don't dance with fire

625
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,143
We will attack and
vanquish you

626
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:31,639
Crush you underthe hoofs
and suppress.

627
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,976
Rain down on earth as
a lightning cloud,

628
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,154
And catch the stream fish in a basket!

629
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,822
A meddling medley,
muddling melody,

630
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,490
Raging rivalry,
raving revelry!

631
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,659
Pazhani Muruga, protect us!

632
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,660
Appearing before our army,
bestow on us boons!

633
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:13,014
The venomous serpent
raises its hood,

634
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:18,525
and hearts shudder...
Oceans quake!

635
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,361
Will the wounded birds flee to roost?

636
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,535
And beetles carry crabs
on their backs?

637
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,030
Spears, clubs, torches, battle cries...

638
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,905
Total chaos, magic, turmoil!

639
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,873
O! Jewel of the serpents, protect us!

640
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,874
Let us rush, jump ahead and conquer!

641
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,483
Cool down. Please listen
to what l say.

642
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,311
Silence.

643
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:21,654
lf lecturer Ramesan had misbehaved
with that girl,

644
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:26,989
l, the principal and my subordinates
are ready to take action.

645
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,496
Forthat our new chairman
is coming here.

646
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,925
Brother, l told you, they are
college students.

647
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,356
lnterfere carefully.
-Why so?

648
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,531
Not because of anything.

649
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,699
lf you quarrel they will act
recklessly.

650
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,527
That's all. So don't want the trial
of strength, heave a sigh.

651
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,034
Ok. l will. But one thing
l don't understand.

652
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,537
What is written in English
on the boards?

653
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,872
They are all slogans
against Ramesan.

654
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,204
lt is not against us then.
- Not at all, you come.

655
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,380
Whatever comes,
let is be there.

656
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,512
The fact that he tried to molest
that girl is confirmed.

657
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,252
But where did he touch her?

658
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:23,048
That's what l am
unable to understand.

659
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,083
Sure enough, that is known to
the man who seized her.

660
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:28,214
ls it? - Then college and all are like this?
- Oh. Let it be.

661
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,558
Why do you stand here sir?

662
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,252
We will go to the office. - Ok.

663
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,237
Sir, what has happened?

664
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,231
Where is my Kanakambaram?

665
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,241
Who has done this to my girl?

666
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,069
Nothing happened to worry like this.

667
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,744
Nothing has happened to that girl.

668
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,243
She is sitting in the office, go there.

669
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:57,249
l see! She is the daughter of this woman?

670
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,921
Whew! such a big daughterfor her?

671
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,749
Not daughter, she is
her sister.

672
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,591
Rajarathanam pillai sir had another
sentiment regarding this girl.

673
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,088
What is that?

674
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,595
There is a rumorthat long back
Pillai sir's foster son Manikyam,

675
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:13,929
had absconded after killing
this girl's brother.

676
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,457
Why are you crying?

677
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,966
Please call that Remesan sir here.

678
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,294
l've not left the place to send for me.

679
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,303
You sit here. Sit here.

680
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,980
lf you want to see, just remove
your cooling glass.

681
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,648
Whew! So you also know.

682
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,476
This cooling glass is such
a complaint about me.

683
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,152
There are many complaints against me.

684
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,481
That is only jealousy.

685
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,815
But it is not the problem here.

686
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,821
That is it. What is this all Sir?

687
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,323
ls this the way to teach students?

688
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:16,828
Whew! Raju he again started...

689
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,680
That is it. That. Now how is it?

690
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,850
So sir, don't waste time
in speaking English.

691
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,519
We will settle the matter here.

692
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,018
Nobody should get less.
Nobody should get more.

693
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,191
lt is usual for anyone
to commit a mistake.

694
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:48,353
Hence sir, you ask this girl in
good Malayalam to forgive you.

695
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:50,858
My job is teaching.

696
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,366
When l do my work, l may touch others
hands or legs by mistake.

697
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:58,530
lf she takes it in bad meaning
it is herfault.

698
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,041
ln that name, if someone who has not
even seen the school,

699
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:07,376
comes & asks me to beg forgiveness,
my dog will come.

700
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,059
lt is just lnterval. lnterval.

701
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,220
Doing vulgarism,

702
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,556
you are coming to say about
justice to me who has not seen school?

703
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,723
What did you say?

704
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,235
To beg pardon your dog will come, is it?

705
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,903
Then bring it.

706
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,231
Afterthat you can do your job.

707
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,566
Headmaster...
- l am here...

708
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:36,575
After getting the papers signed by him & settling
his dues, dismiss him today itself.

709
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:37,905
This is my order.
- Ok.

710
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,741
He will bring his dog it seems.

711
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,247
l'll beat and shatteryou dirty...

712
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,921
Rajutta, now can l strike a pose?

713
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:46,747
Why not? Come brother.

714
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,633
As if what has happened is not sufficient,
you are crying now. lsn't it?

715
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,502
You came here telling about
your poverty and got admission.

716
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,734
That time l didn't know your
sister has grown so much.

717
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,846
ls this the way to show
your gratitude to us.

718
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:16,747
lf you have some good advice,
advise your husband to behave properly.

719
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:21,754
She and her sister were
grown up here; l know them.

720
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,391
Go child.

721
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:29,761
Her crocodile tears, and
on top of it your consolation.

722
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:30,660
All are same.

723
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,926
Otherwise, to fulfill the wish
of the newcomer

724
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,502
you wouldn't have gone forfoundation stone
ceremony before one year of father's death.

725
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:41,337
l didn't go to make others happy,
but to give some relief to yourfather's soul.

726
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:46,477
l've no time now to hearyou
if you've come to talk nonsense.

727
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:50,585
You must've time. Otherwise you'll have
to see this daughter's dead body.

728
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:54,052
When that arrogant one took
possession of the Bank and car,

729
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,724
l only have the value of a servant.

730
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,894
Also, the disgrace of beating
and expelling my husband.

731
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,226
See this mother, these are ornaments
bought on credit when father was alive.

732
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,661
As the account is freezed,

733
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:09,463
there is no way to repay and the jewel shop owner
keeps calling me to return the jewels as it is.

734
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:15,307
lf l, Rajarathnam Pillai's daughter have
to sufferthis shame, l will die.

735
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:19,771
Here, there are people to see
others' tears but not mine.

736
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,586
What did you say?
What should l do?

737
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,122
Come, mother.

738
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:45,931
Mother...l've come early.

739
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:55,279
l am happy to know that something that's
impossible here is going to happen today.

740
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,916
Long back, my father gave you a present without
anyone's knowledge a house & the compound.

741
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:06,926
The private property does not come under
the limit of authority of that ruler.

742
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,599
When Rani wept, you decided
to sell it, isn't it?

743
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,429
Mother, l am happy.

744
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,028
You may wonder how l came to know it.
ln the time of poverty,

745
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:21,973
God has appeared in the form
of broker Nanappan. Mother, l am happy.

746
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:26,111
lf you've come to share
this happiness, don't delay. Go.

747
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,875
l'll go back only after
getting half of this deal.

748
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:33,784
Otherwise l'll go empty handed,
not only me all of us together.

749
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,091
You tried to grab all foryourself
but what happened now.

750
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,420
He came and swallowed
everything in one gulp.

751
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,358
So, no need of competition between us.

752
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:42,553
Otherwise the situation
will deteriorate.

753
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:46,496
Enough! Both of you don't
quarrel about this now.

754
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,404
Don't think it is my selfishness
for not informing you earlier.

755
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,131
Whatever we get both
of you share equally.

756
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:57,244
That's enough.
l am happy, mother, happy.

757
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,971
Come Mother.

758
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,413
Sir, good morning.
-Yes.

759
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,350
This is Muthulakshmi Amma.
She's come to sell the land.

760
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,321
Hey, Hey. Which land?

761
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:17,096
And you leaving the teaching
job started broker's job.

762
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,096
This property was given to
our mother by ourfather.

763
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,327
Whew! What party?

764
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,004
No. Property. Land, land.

765
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,195
Oh! That! Go on.

766
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,806
l tell you don't interfere.

767
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,533
My dear, who interfered?

768
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,939
lt is my decision.

769
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:33,081
l'll give to my children
the land in my name.

770
01:02:35,129 --> 01:02:37,927
That doesn't come in
underyour authority.

771
01:02:38,132 --> 01:02:39,861
Sir, you tell them.

772
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:41,728
What you say is right.

773
01:02:41,936 --> 01:02:50,844
But it is in the original document, that
Rajarathnam Pillai has also a share in the property.

774
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:57,315
That's it. Rajutta show them.

775
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:00,077
This is the Xerox of the document.

776
01:03:00,721 --> 01:03:04,316
What Sir said now is marked
here in red ink.

777
01:03:08,128 --> 01:03:13,532
Nothing wrong in selling it.
But the buyer will have some difficulties.

778
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:21,307
He has got the Power of Attorney of 25 years.

779
01:03:22,076 --> 01:03:25,341
So if he file an injunction
suit in civil court,

780
01:03:26,213 --> 01:03:29,842
it'll take minimum six or seven years
to finalize about the buyer's matter.

781
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,018
That is it. lnjection, injection.

782
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:34,678
So what do you want to do now?

783
01:03:34,888 --> 01:03:37,948
Take the injection on your shoulder now
or on your buttocks after 6 or 7 years.

784
01:03:38,726 --> 01:03:40,284
Velayudha, come here.

785
01:03:41,662 --> 01:03:42,458
What?

786
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:44,127
You son of a bitch.

787
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:53,805
Now l'll announce my decision in this matter.
l am leaving the field.

788
01:03:55,175 --> 01:03:56,199
Poorfellow!

789
01:03:57,344 --> 01:03:59,471
See, Velayudham has left.

790
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,979
Now what've you decided?
To sell or leave?

791
01:04:05,386 --> 01:04:06,148
Tell...

792
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:13,519
Whatever it is since you all've come together
it is shameful to go back empty-handed.

793
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:15,718
Hey give me that document.

794
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:19,831
l'll take it for pawn and give you 10 or
15 thousand for meeting some expenses.

795
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:22,662
Rajarathnam Pillai's children don't
need your crumbs to live.

796
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,565
The tiger has jumped.
- Come...

797
01:04:24,772 --> 01:04:28,299
Since all of you've joined together
go aftertaking a group photo.

798
01:04:28,509 --> 01:04:29,237
What Varkicha?

799
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:30,375
You can frame it.

800
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:33,239
What?
- l said frame it.

801
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:40,746
Bellari Raja! The very name sounds odd-made up.

802
01:04:40,954 --> 01:04:42,478
He is a born criminal.

803
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,690
Otherwise, how does he know all this?

804
01:04:44,992 --> 01:04:50,362
From the day he came, he knows about
the movements of you and your sister.

805
01:04:50,564 --> 01:04:52,225
He and his cheap cooling glass!

806
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:55,493
And his country language!

807
01:04:55,769 --> 01:04:58,363
And his appearance, a mixture of
Kottayam Kunhachan and Adu Thoma.

808
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:02,668
l know. l'm sure nothing is his own.
He's not what he appears to be.

809
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:04,366
Who is he, then?

810
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:08,537
l'll tell you, when yourfathertraveled around,
he made friends with him,

811
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:10,876
giving him liquor and women.

812
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:16,318
At last locked him in a room,
and forced him to write the will at knife-point.

813
01:05:16,657 --> 01:05:18,181
Why can't it be so?

814
01:05:19,026 --> 01:05:20,960
Forthat he got the
help of family advocate.

815
01:05:22,029 --> 01:05:26,466
Selva, these days,
thieves are very shrewd.

816
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:30,331
But you know there is a vehicle in
our country which any thief has to get in.

817
01:05:30,904 --> 01:05:35,932
Afour wheeler.
The 'Police Jeep'.

818
01:05:50,524 --> 01:05:53,357
Police! What Sir, petrol over?

819
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:58,155
Not over, l wantedly stopped it.
Where's that Bellari Raja?

820
01:05:58,565 --> 01:05:59,896
l am here, Sir.

821
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:01,931
Oh! Come out.

822
01:06:02,136 --> 01:06:03,603
What's the matter, Sir?

823
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:06,431
Only if l tell the matteryou
will get out of this?

824
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,599
Yes. And also if l want
to tell something.

825
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:13,939
But just now l am on my way
for another matter.

826
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:18,048
Forthe time being, you change the
route and come to the station.

827
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:21,719
Which station, Sir?
Railway station or Police station?

828
01:06:21,922 --> 01:06:23,480
No. Radio Station!

829
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,180
You just get out.

830
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:27,722
Whew! You were a tiger?

831
01:06:33,834 --> 01:06:39,704
Sir, please. What's the problem?
What's your complaint against him?

832
01:06:39,907 --> 01:06:42,137
Without telling any reason,
if you ask us to come to the station...

833
01:06:42,342 --> 01:06:43,639
Who are you to ask?

834
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:45,038
His manager.

835
01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:49,310
That's great! Thieves and robbers
having managers!

836
01:06:49,516 --> 01:06:52,644
Son of a pig! Don't point yourfingers
at my face and talk.

837
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:54,115
Oh Sir, don't! Don't beat him! Sir!

838
01:06:54,321 --> 01:06:56,812
He said something in English
and you didn't understand.

839
01:06:57,024 --> 01:07:00,721
ls that all? Hey, hereafter if you speak
to him English without my permission,

840
01:07:00,928 --> 01:07:03,396
l will, mother promise, heat a spatula and
smack your bottom with it. Go, go, go!

841
01:07:03,597 --> 01:07:04,529
Get lost.

842
01:07:05,032 --> 01:07:06,431
Silly boy. Leave him.

843
01:07:09,236 --> 01:07:10,567
Varkicha.
-What?

844
01:07:10,771 --> 01:07:12,068
Give me five hundred rupees.

845
01:07:20,881 --> 01:07:25,011
Sir, as soon as l saw you coming
and your sudden brake l knew it.

846
01:07:25,886 --> 01:07:27,353
That someone sent you after me.

847
01:07:27,921 --> 01:07:30,890
Whatever may be the job,
money is important.

848
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,355
This is a practice of us
bullock traders, you know

849
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,528
to make a deal covering with a towel.

850
01:07:35,996 --> 01:07:38,863
Take this, Sir! There is five hundred.

851
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:42,035
You will insult me in public, won't you?

852
01:07:47,574 --> 01:07:49,838
This is the problem with the police.

853
01:07:50,043 --> 01:07:53,274
As soon as they get the money,
they start giving jobs there itself.

854
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,710
How mean! One thing is settled then.

855
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:57,816
Eitheryou will take me
and go or go aftertaking.

856
01:07:58,185 --> 01:08:00,779
Either is shameful.
So let's go, Sir.

857
01:08:00,988 --> 01:08:02,114
Varkicha, start the car.

858
01:08:06,493 --> 01:08:09,428
Not in this. ln that.

859
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:12,758
Whew! There he goes again! Not in that, Sir! ln this!

860
01:08:12,966 --> 01:08:16,060
A no.1 car, l bought this for many lakhs.

861
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,237
You also come, Sir!

862
01:08:17,437 --> 01:08:22,067
Let us all go in style, enjoying the cool
AC and listening to songs.

863
01:08:22,276 --> 01:08:22,833
Varkicha!
-Yes!

864
01:08:23,043 --> 01:08:27,207
That song ''Fatima, you are in my heart...''
is there in the car, isn't it?

865
01:08:27,414 --> 01:08:28,403
Of course.

866
01:08:28,782 --> 01:08:30,750
Come along, then!

867
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,215
To make criminals like you to come to station,

868
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,753
do you want Tamilnadu
Government install AC in police jeep?

869
01:08:36,957 --> 01:08:39,425
l, Circle inspector Vikraman will
take you in this vehicle.

870
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:46,524
Stand this side. Move to the right, you pig.

871
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:51,160
l didn't want to create a cinema
scene like this here.

872
01:08:51,371 --> 01:08:53,999
That's why l thought of coming with you
without even asking for a warrant.

873
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:55,765
But then you got wild.

874
01:08:55,976 --> 01:08:57,500
Hereafter if you want me to come with you,

875
01:08:57,711 --> 01:09:00,771
you must bring all those things and
walk at least 10 times to my house.

876
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:03,074
Now l am going another way.

877
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:07,016
When this Bellary Raja sets off for some place,
he will go there only.

878
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:08,347
That is my habit.

879
01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:12,953
Showing off the muscles, he has come
to play thief and police. Dirty Pig!

880
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:29,966
Catch that son of the pig and bring him out

881
01:09:32,746 --> 01:09:34,043
What sir, what's the matter?

882
01:09:34,247 --> 01:09:36,579
l've brought the warrant to take him.

883
01:09:36,783 --> 01:09:38,842
Where is that rowdy Raja who
doesn't get in to Police car?

884
01:09:39,052 --> 01:09:40,280
He is not here. Out of station.

885
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:42,114
Sir! He is not here.

886
01:09:42,623 --> 01:09:45,251
Whichever station he is in,
he will come to police station.

887
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:47,484
Forthat you are enough for me.

888
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,826
Don't beat me any more.

889
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:56,162
You'll startle police people by speaking
English isn't it you rascal?

890
01:09:58,672 --> 01:10:04,736
Your master knows that if this Vikraman
gets one blow, in return he will give 10.

891
01:10:12,519 --> 01:10:15,386
He will come. l will make him come.

892
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:19,158
lf that is to see your dead body, it will be so.

893
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:36,537
No.. No.. Don't. You just sit here.

894
01:10:36,743 --> 01:10:39,075
These are all silly things l'll manage.

895
01:10:42,516 --> 01:10:44,450
Sir, what's the problem?

896
01:10:44,651 --> 01:10:48,712
What? Asking what's the problem,
after doing Rowdysim?

897
01:10:48,922 --> 01:10:50,253
You send out that Rajuttan.

898
01:10:50,457 --> 01:10:51,219
Sir, this is...

899
01:10:51,425 --> 01:10:52,449
Go fast.

900
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:00,958
My god! What've you done?

901
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:04,035
When buffaloes like you take the law in your hands,

902
01:11:04,237 --> 01:11:05,898
lock up murders happen.

903
01:11:06,106 --> 01:11:09,872
Then, that headache will fall
on ruling minister like me.

904
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:12,271
Hereafter if the police do
like this without seeing who it is,

905
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:15,539
neitheryou will have your hat nor head.

906
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:27,089
Vikraman Sir has played nastily?

907
01:11:39,139 --> 01:11:42,540
Sir, who is behind these activities?
Whose order is this?

908
01:11:42,743 --> 01:11:45,940
The complainant is Rajarathnam Pillai'
son Rajaselvam.

909
01:11:46,313 --> 01:11:50,010
He wants to know about Bellary Raja
who has come to rule overthem.

910
01:11:50,217 --> 01:11:52,185
ls that all? l will inform him.

911
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:56,845
l'll personally go and show him
who l am and where l came from.

912
01:11:58,325 --> 01:12:04,389
Whatever it is, since Vikraman sir has shown
such aggression, we may have to meet again.

913
01:12:04,998 --> 01:12:07,364
Now l'll go and see that complainant.

914
01:12:10,203 --> 01:12:13,969
Brother, thank you very much for
keeping aside some time for me.

915
01:12:14,174 --> 01:12:17,302
Thanks? Your vote only made me leader.

916
01:12:17,511 --> 01:12:21,880
Go and see those you want to see
and give them what you want to give. Go...

917
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:15,131
You'll make the police beat my boy? lsn't it?

918
01:13:17,404 --> 01:13:19,463
Stop. l tell you to stop.

919
01:13:20,907 --> 01:13:24,035
lf you've come to kill everybody and bury,
you kill me first.

920
01:13:24,244 --> 01:13:27,577
Nobody has authorized anyone to torture anybody

921
01:13:27,781 --> 01:13:28,770
Why this fighting?

922
01:13:28,982 --> 01:13:32,179
lf it is because he complained to
police to know who you are,

923
01:13:32,385 --> 01:13:34,216
then l too have that complaint now.

924
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:35,820
These are my children.

925
01:13:36,022 --> 01:13:39,890
l am the wife of that great man.
l am asking you. Who are you?

926
01:13:44,598 --> 01:13:46,498
Who are you?
What do you want?

927
01:13:55,008 --> 01:13:58,842
l see. Then you want to
know who l am. ls that all?

928
01:13:59,946 --> 01:14:05,179
l heard this question forthe first time
when on a midnight l knocked at a door.

929
01:14:05,785 --> 01:14:08,151
Who are you? What you want?

930
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:11,280
l said l want my mother.

931
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:15,822
Then that mother said she
doesn't know that son.

932
01:14:17,898 --> 01:14:18,762
Mother.

933
01:14:20,367 --> 01:14:21,732
Do you know him?

934
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:23,629
No.

935
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,009
With that l lost everything
my name, place and all.

936
01:14:31,778 --> 01:14:35,179
There he is! What are you looking at?

937
01:14:35,382 --> 01:14:37,282
l told you that day itself that l don't want anything.

938
01:14:37,651 --> 01:14:45,751
That great man named me
Manikyam...Raja Manikyam.

939
01:14:51,631 --> 01:14:57,968
lf you've any doubt whether
l am that boy, l've a mark to show.

940
01:15:00,106 --> 01:15:01,903
Do you remember long ago you beat and

941
01:15:02,108 --> 01:15:04,770
killed this girl's brother in playground
listening to the Nadar boy?

942
01:15:06,513 --> 01:15:10,210
Beat. Beat. Leave him, leave.

943
01:15:12,552 --> 01:15:24,828
Leave me...
- Beat. Break his head.

944
01:15:34,941 --> 01:15:38,672
Go, run. lf you stay here,
police will catch. Run away.

945
01:15:54,394 --> 01:15:56,862
Mother...

946
01:16:03,403 --> 01:16:07,499
That day it became dark on my left side.
Still it is like that.

947
01:16:07,907 --> 01:16:08,703
Do you want to see?

948
01:16:09,409 --> 01:16:11,206
Then see.

949
01:16:20,787 --> 01:16:22,448
l ran that day.

950
01:16:22,989 --> 01:16:26,584
But he knew how far a
10 year old boy can run...

951
01:16:26,793 --> 01:16:27,987
He came following me and called.

952
01:16:28,194 --> 01:16:29,525
l told him l won't come.

953
01:16:29,863 --> 01:16:34,562
Now l've come not to take away something,
telling these old relationships.

954
01:16:34,768 --> 01:16:38,898
He authorized me to do one thing.
l've come forthat. To correct you all.

955
01:16:41,341 --> 01:16:44,139
l'll go only after doing
that properly.

956
01:16:44,444 --> 01:16:49,381
Then l've experience with
4 legged bullocks only.

957
01:16:49,783 --> 01:16:54,152
lf l've to deal with 2 legged bullocks
like you, then let it be like that.

958
01:16:56,856 --> 01:16:59,757
Be prepared.
Prepare for a fight with Manikyam.

959
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:25,182
You could've told me.

960
01:17:26,486 --> 01:17:30,946
You could've gone aftertelling me
you brought him up without showing me.

961
01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:34,052
You gave him everything which l couldn't give.

962
01:17:35,161 --> 01:17:38,221
At last you've authorized him for everything.

963
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,927
l couldn't recognize my child, oh God!

964
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,296
What is this mother?

965
01:17:45,672 --> 01:17:48,766
All these years yourtears were
for not seeing him.

966
01:17:49,809 --> 01:17:53,438
Whatever it is, god has sent him
here within earshot.

967
01:17:54,414 --> 01:18:04,619
Varghese chetta, you told me to keep
my child aside; knowingly, l did it.

968
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:19,504
Obeyed. l am requesting the same person to
get permission for me to see him.

969
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:34,444
What is there even if we give in lakhs
these bulls are great. Super!

970
01:18:34,654 --> 01:18:38,283
Even then, 5 lakhs is too much.
Whatever it is, they are only bullocks.

971
01:18:38,491 --> 01:18:40,288
Hey! Don't say foolishness.

972
01:18:40,827 --> 01:18:43,523
ls it the same value for actress lshwarya rai
and our maidservant Annamma?

973
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,788
Aren't both women?

974
01:18:45,331 --> 01:18:48,300
Whether it is bullock or a woman,
the value is forthe behavior. What Varkhicha?

975
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:49,627
Then what?

976
01:18:49,836 --> 01:18:51,030
But giving food is difficult.

977
01:18:51,237 --> 01:18:53,899
Let them eat. Let them eat.
Dumb creatures.

978
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:57,975
l wish to be born as a Jallikattu bullock
at least in my next birth.

979
01:18:58,178 --> 01:19:01,045
Eat bullocks, eat. See this.

980
01:19:01,848 --> 01:19:07,047
Hey, Hey. Don't do like that.
Don't be violent. What happened?

981
01:19:07,253 --> 01:19:09,278
Bullock became mad.
Haven't you heard about mad cows?

982
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:17,385
My God! Ditched!
That woman is wearing red sari.

983
01:19:18,865 --> 01:19:22,266
Varghese Sir, Stop.
Whew! l'll come there.

984
01:19:22,702 --> 01:19:24,897
l told to stop not for anything else.

985
01:19:25,338 --> 01:19:27,568
When they see the red color,
they will become violent.

986
01:19:27,774 --> 01:19:29,571
Just one knock is enough.

987
01:19:29,776 --> 01:19:33,405
You'll be shattered to pieces.
Why did you come Varghese Sir?

988
01:19:33,613 --> 01:19:34,409
To see.

989
01:19:34,614 --> 01:19:35,876
Varghese chetta! Go and see.

990
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:38,676
Let her stand here.
Hey show him the bullock's antics.

991
01:19:38,885 --> 01:19:40,443
We've come not to see the bullocks.

992
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:43,053
We've come to see Manikyam.

993
01:19:44,123 --> 01:19:48,321
Mother sent me here. She wants to see you.

994
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:51,491
Long back it happened like that.

995
01:19:51,698 --> 01:19:53,427
lt was only because l told your mother
to do like that.

996
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,798
Forthat, l'll touch you feet.

997
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,765
l've come here because Pillai Sir
wanted me to do some work.

998
01:20:00,974 --> 01:20:03,306
ln the mean time
no need of such things.

999
01:20:03,509 --> 01:20:04,771
What wrong have l done?

1000
01:20:04,978 --> 01:20:06,775
She asked who am l.

1001
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,912
l told here who l am. That's all.

1002
01:20:08,114 --> 01:20:09,046
Varghese sir can go.

1003
01:20:09,249 --> 01:20:11,114
Let the things happen as it should be.

1004
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:22,452
Chellakkili, come here.
Let me ask. What is your job?

1005
01:20:22,662 --> 01:20:24,960
l am doing flower business
in flower market

1006
01:20:25,164 --> 01:20:29,191
Whew! Will anyone do fish business
in flower market?

1007
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:34,965
What are you telling?
Go, and go what ever job you have to do.

1008
01:20:38,845 --> 01:20:40,312
He does not even show a
sign of old acquaintance.

1009
01:20:40,513 --> 01:20:41,810
Really a bullock!

1010
01:20:51,357 --> 01:20:53,882
Dear Selvam, this is day time.

1011
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:57,025
Don't drink too much and spoil your health.

1012
01:20:57,363 --> 01:21:01,493
Tomorrow if you don't have money
you may have to do some coolie work.

1013
01:21:02,602 --> 01:21:05,298
Your dead father Nadar
will go forthat work.

1014
01:21:06,139 --> 01:21:07,697
You were out of range for some days?

1015
01:21:07,974 --> 01:21:12,411
l was trying to find the range
of your one-eyed mentor.

1016
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,146
l wandered from out of station
to out of nation level.

1017
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:21,853
Dear Selva, our old playmate is roaming
international roaming.

1018
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:27,518
ln Bellary, he is ''Bellary Raja'',
just a bullock merchant.

1019
01:21:27,727 --> 01:21:31,686
ln Saudi, he is ''Diamond Raja'',
famous diamond merchant.

1020
01:21:31,898 --> 01:21:34,867
When he chartered flights,
played flash and accumulated lakhs

1021
01:21:35,068 --> 01:21:36,695
his nick name was ''Gambler Raja''.

1022
01:21:36,903 --> 01:21:41,033
When he stood as middleman to
settle the quarrels of rich man,

1023
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,707
his name was ''Mediator Raja''.

1024
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:47,976
His passion for Benz car made him
''Benz Raja'' among his friends.

1025
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:50,211
Thus names are many for him.

1026
01:21:51,217 --> 01:21:56,211
Yourfather Rajarathnam Pillai's property
will not be even half of his.

1027
01:21:57,223 --> 01:22:00,681
That financier Perumal.
l can't stand these men anymore.

1028
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:05,523
You attend. lsn't through your account that
Perumal gave crores forthe hospital?

1029
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:08,030
Why should l attend them?
l've taken only 50 lakhs.

1030
01:22:08,234 --> 01:22:09,895
The rest 4 ½/2 crores by you.

1031
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:12,999
l didn't take it for my mother-in-law's treatment.

1032
01:22:13,206 --> 01:22:15,970
l gave it to the Germans
to import hospital equipments.

1033
01:22:16,175 --> 01:22:18,905
lf we inform them that this project is cancelled,
won't they understand?

1034
01:22:19,112 --> 01:22:20,704
l wonder if there is any such person.

1035
01:22:23,316 --> 01:22:25,580
Are you doubting me?

1036
01:22:25,785 --> 01:22:29,312
Yes, l know that everyone joined me and

1037
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:34,585
used my account freely
seeing my father's wealth... you also?

1038
01:22:35,895 --> 01:22:39,695
ls that so? Then you think like that.

1039
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:44,359
The financial problem that l keep reminding
you would soon turn up real.

1040
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:46,401
Everyone is beginning to understand now that

1041
01:22:46,606 --> 01:22:49,473
you don't have money
to buy even a naphthalene ball.

1042
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:52,401
So, if he calls again,
you do whateveryou want.

1043
01:22:53,146 --> 01:22:56,946
Hey! When a friend's house is burning,
if you take fire from it to light your beedi...

1044
01:22:57,316 --> 01:23:00,251
Take off your hand.
- Hey, Selvam. What is this?

1045
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,450
Pah! Both of you like street boys.

1046
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:06,352
lt's not the time to fight like this.

1047
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:08,857
The reason for all this is that fellow Manikyam.

1048
01:23:09,061 --> 01:23:11,029
You took money from us, went to control him,

1049
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:13,357
came back receiving blows.
Nothing else happened.

1050
01:23:13,566 --> 01:23:15,625
Oh! ls it so? Now, you jump on me.

1051
01:23:15,835 --> 01:23:17,530
Hereafteryou decide among yourselves.

1052
01:23:17,737 --> 01:23:19,204
Don't forget one thing.

1053
01:23:19,405 --> 01:23:23,136
That encounter helped to reveal
the identity of Bellary Raja, as Rajamanikyam.

1054
01:23:23,843 --> 01:23:26,937
That case alone is enough for me to nab him.

1055
01:23:29,015 --> 01:23:31,813
We'll meet only afterthat.

1056
01:24:09,489 --> 01:24:13,789
Where are those scoundrels
who look afterthese dirty animals?

1057
01:24:30,176 --> 01:24:33,373
Akraman Sir, Welcome Welcome!

1058
01:24:35,581 --> 01:24:39,039
Coming with any new quotations?
What happened?

1059
01:24:40,386 --> 01:24:41,614
Did the bullocks give you trouble?

1060
01:24:42,455 --> 01:24:45,390
Generally we say that a person
who doesn't listen is a bullock;

1061
01:24:45,591 --> 01:24:46,717
you are an example forthat.

1062
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,829
But these bullocks are not like that,
they are obedient type.

1063
01:24:51,264 --> 01:24:54,722
Manikyam's bullocks.
They listen to what l say.

1064
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:58,495
Don't think too much of yourself just because
you've a minister in your pocket.

1065
01:24:58,704 --> 01:25:01,229
lf you show off with these animals,

1066
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,567
l'll tie you to scaffold and flog you till you piss.

1067
01:25:03,776 --> 01:25:05,403
Whew! Good.

1068
01:25:05,945 --> 01:25:08,743
When there are so many four-legged ones here,

1069
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:10,575
why do you need a three-legged scaffold to piss?

1070
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:12,747
Anyway you've come urgently.

1071
01:25:13,286 --> 01:25:20,590
So, Rajutta go and make our Sir Piss. Go.

1072
01:25:31,404 --> 01:25:32,928
Rajuttan is ready.

1073
01:25:33,806 --> 01:25:36,366
l am not playing in this pissing game.

1074
01:25:36,576 --> 01:25:40,103
l'll be the referee.
Let the game start - in style.

1075
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,468
Hey, don't make me ashamed.

1076
01:26:04,003 --> 01:26:06,301
Brother, don't worry. l'll manage it.

1077
01:26:06,505 --> 01:26:08,973
Yes, yes. You are the manager.
Go and beat.

1078
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,151
Though our chap slipped in the beginning,
he is picking up.

1079
01:26:55,621 --> 01:26:57,748
Why this one is suddenly looking pale?

1080
01:26:58,057 --> 01:26:59,183
Pregnant again?

1081
01:27:00,393 --> 01:27:03,419
Whew. No doubt, it is that.
ln this matter she is also a tiger.

1082
01:27:33,592 --> 01:27:38,052
Hey, not so fast. Sir beat you till morning.

1083
01:27:38,264 --> 01:27:41,563
You also can take yourtime. Slowly.

1084
01:28:27,313 --> 01:28:27,779
Beat him.

1085
01:28:29,815 --> 01:28:30,440
Beat him

1086
01:28:31,884 --> 01:28:33,112
Break his head.

1087
01:28:39,158 --> 01:28:40,625
Oh! Who is this? Manikyam!

1088
01:28:40,993 --> 01:28:43,291
You know the way to my arena?

1089
01:28:43,662 --> 01:28:47,792
Friend there are so many ways to the
arena and attic in the world.

1090
01:28:48,501 --> 01:28:51,629
To tell the truth, you are a tiger.

1091
01:28:52,404 --> 01:28:56,465
Brother, in a forest full of big tigers,
one should at least be a small tiger.

1092
01:28:56,675 --> 01:28:58,643
But, this is too much.

1093
01:28:58,844 --> 01:29:02,143
Just because they've a lot of money,
will anyone varnish their body?

1094
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:05,544
Pooh! What a bad smell!

1095
01:29:06,786 --> 01:29:10,381
Who is this girl? ls she your wife or keep...

1096
01:29:11,023 --> 01:29:11,648
You go.

1097
01:29:11,857 --> 01:29:14,155
That's it. Then sisteryou go. Go.

1098
01:29:15,194 --> 01:29:18,163
l expected you earlier.
- Oh! Really!

1099
01:29:18,597 --> 01:29:20,656
But, friend, how can l come empty handed?

1100
01:29:20,866 --> 01:29:23,994
Aren't we old friends?
Parted somehow.

1101
01:29:24,703 --> 01:29:27,831
How can l come without a small present at least?

1102
01:29:28,207 --> 01:29:31,768
Then l found a big thing.
l've brought it. Shall l bring?

1103
01:29:32,044 --> 01:29:33,511
Varkicha, bring that here.

1104
01:29:33,712 --> 01:29:34,508
Look at it.

1105
01:29:42,288 --> 01:29:43,516
Here, keep it on this table.

1106
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:50,185
l can do only this much.

1107
01:29:51,397 --> 01:29:53,865
Now you tell. What are your news?

1108
01:29:54,066 --> 01:29:57,866
l don't have any news. You only have news.

1109
01:29:58,237 --> 01:30:00,865
Oh! ls that why you are enquiring about my news?

1110
01:30:01,407 --> 01:30:04,205
You traveled by flight to know who l am, isn't it?

1111
01:30:04,743 --> 01:30:08,543
Whatever it is, since you're getting
more and more arrogant, l'll tell straightaway.

1112
01:30:09,081 --> 01:30:12,710
From childhood, you whistled and
encouraged him to do wicked things.

1113
01:30:13,018 --> 01:30:16,044
You are getting older, so at least from now on

1114
01:30:16,255 --> 01:30:18,052
you stop your indecent work and
mind your own business.

1115
01:30:18,257 --> 01:30:22,717
l'll whistle, clap and even beat
if anyone stands in my way.

1116
01:30:22,928 --> 01:30:26,887
That is my sportsman spirit,
l know what to do.

1117
01:30:27,266 --> 01:30:30,235
l've come knowing what all you can do.

1118
01:30:30,436 --> 01:30:33,405
One thing let this be our last meeting.

1119
01:30:34,106 --> 01:30:37,564
Covering with a towel we'll decide
to close the deal between us.

1120
01:30:37,943 --> 01:30:41,970
But if you make mischief and
show your spos-span spirit, instead of this towel,

1121
01:30:42,348 --> 01:30:44,509
l'll bring a new cloth to coveryour body.

1122
01:30:44,717 --> 01:30:50,417
l will settle yourfinal deal.
Don't fight, it will damage your body.

1123
01:30:50,623 --> 01:30:53,421
That's what l also want to tell you.
lt will damage.

1124
01:30:53,626 --> 01:30:54,422
That is it.

1125
01:31:00,032 --> 01:31:05,868
Varkicha, he is a tiger.
We'll have to come again.

1126
01:31:16,048 --> 01:31:17,675
Have we reached, Nadar?

1127
01:31:18,717 --> 01:31:21,686
We have reached. Sit down here Ramesh.
We'll go and talk.

1128
01:31:22,454 --> 01:31:25,355
lf they agree, the rest as l told before.

1129
01:31:36,835 --> 01:31:38,132
Hey, Vellangiri stop playing.

1130
01:31:39,772 --> 01:31:44,038
Selvam, This is Cheriachan.
Advocate Lal Cherian.

1131
01:31:45,878 --> 01:31:48,972
Till now no case has failed
which advocate Cherian attended.

1132
01:31:49,548 --> 01:31:52,984
To say in his language,
he is a tiger in court.

1133
01:31:53,686 --> 01:31:55,313
But he is expensive.

1134
01:31:56,355 --> 01:31:59,984
Though he smokes beedis,
he gets lakhs for one sitting.

1135
01:32:00,793 --> 01:32:04,820
Money is not a problem, my aim is
to deport him from this country.

1136
01:32:05,297 --> 01:32:06,821
Whether legally or illegally.

1137
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:12,831
Ok. Agreed. But l far as l know this subject
is a bit complicated.

1138
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:17,168
For one thing, the will written in his own writing
by your own father

1139
01:32:17,643 --> 01:32:21,670
Anotherthing, this Manikyam is not an outsider,
he is the son of that lady.

1140
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:27,784
Therefore, to make any movement against
the existing power of attorney,

1141
01:32:27,987 --> 01:32:31,013
l need a blood-relation power.

1142
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:34,017
Rajarathnam Pillai has only two children.

1143
01:32:34,393 --> 01:32:37,851
One is you, and other is... Nadar,
what's here name? - Rani Rathna

1144
01:32:38,063 --> 01:32:39,030
Ah! She.

1145
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:41,356
Both of you must stand together.

1146
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:42,865
That is the power.

1147
01:32:43,068 --> 01:32:45,866
The power of blood relation.
lf it is so, we can go head.

1148
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:47,299
lt won't happen in the birth.

1149
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,871
Than l am sorry, no chance.
Nadar, you can leave me.

1150
01:32:52,077 --> 01:32:52,702
Wait

1151
01:32:53,178 --> 01:32:57,774
Dear Selvam. At present,
she is not your enemy. He is.

1152
01:32:58,417 --> 01:33:01,716
You must be ready to face
any hardship to ship him away.

1153
01:33:02,588 --> 01:33:09,221
That rascal threatened to kill me
if ljoin you. l want to see him dead.

1154
01:33:09,862 --> 01:33:12,057
So it is betterto agree with Cheriachan.

1155
01:33:13,432 --> 01:33:14,660
Forthat she must also agree.

1156
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:18,136
She and Ramesh are suffering
more than you with his rule.

1157
01:33:18,437 --> 01:33:21,463
To solve the problem l've brought
Ramesan here.

1158
01:33:24,109 --> 01:33:26,407
Then let it be so.

1159
01:33:29,448 --> 01:33:31,075
How many lakhs are there on the whole?

1160
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:34,248
57,67,312...

1161
01:33:34,453 --> 01:33:37,251
So the amount is excellent.
lsn't it auditor?

1162
01:33:37,456 --> 01:33:40,584
To say the truth, there was no such growth
in income even when Pillai Sir was there.

1163
01:33:40,793 --> 01:33:43,921
This is really a record for
Thiruvengadam Group. -ls it?

1164
01:33:44,129 --> 01:33:48,088
So our brother can manage any business.
All of you understand? -Yes.

1165
01:33:48,467 --> 01:33:51,595
Then Rajutta. You deposit the money before
the Banks are closed.

1166
01:33:52,071 --> 01:33:52,935
Auditor, you also go.

1167
01:33:53,305 --> 01:33:54,272
Wait fortaking the money.

1168
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:59,441
The money kept in your chest.
So far is enough. Here, you read this..

1169
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:10,044
Advocate, he is illiterate, so tell him
in pure Malayalam

1170
01:34:10,756 --> 01:34:14,453
This is Court's stay orderfor stopping
temporarily the right

1171
01:34:14,827 --> 01:34:18,786
and authority that Manikyam
got through the Will.

1172
01:34:23,102 --> 01:34:29,735
You thought you can enjoy for 25 years after
giving us injunction and account freezing?

1173
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:32,968
Rajutta, is it true. What this
advocate has said?

1174
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:37,476
Don't be perplexed. You tell your master.
-Yes. lt is stay order.

1175
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,150
Hm.. You came and asked me
to prepare for a fight.

1176
01:34:40,352 --> 01:34:41,819
Yes. This is fight. lf it will end with
your death, till such time.

1177
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:45,421
This fight to defeat you started
on the day you intruded,

1178
01:34:47,025 --> 01:34:52,895
got sympathy of my father
and became his foster son.

1179
01:34:53,532 --> 01:34:54,829
That is my complex

1180
01:34:55,267 --> 01:34:59,169
The wealth of Rajarathnam Pillai should be
enjoyed only by his blood related children.

1181
01:35:00,706 --> 01:35:05,234
That is both of us.
She is my own sister.

1182
01:35:09,148 --> 01:35:10,172
My father's blood.

1183
01:35:12,784 --> 01:35:16,015
Hence you must leave today itself.

1184
01:35:16,221 --> 01:35:19,349
Hello. No such orderto leave is in this paper.

1185
01:35:19,825 --> 01:35:24,524
lf we file a counter affidavit, it will work.
That's all.

1186
01:35:24,730 --> 01:35:25,355
That is enough.

1187
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:30,191
Even if Rajarathanam Pillai's foundations
are locked up and workers die of starvation,

1188
01:35:30,569 --> 01:35:32,867
l want to put an end to your rule.
This is enough for me.

1189
01:35:33,071 --> 01:35:35,869
Forthat if it is necessary this Selvam
will even go to Supreme Court.

1190
01:35:36,074 --> 01:35:37,041
Whew! Good.

1191
01:35:37,242 --> 01:35:40,700
As they say-even if the brother dies,
the sister-in law should shed tears.

1192
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:45,207
Dasappa, there is not any stay order
for our Bullock trade?

1193
01:35:45,417 --> 01:35:48,716
No use telling stay order in bullock's ear.

1194
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:52,550
That is. Whatever it is, as the bitter enemies
have become friends,

1195
01:35:52,858 --> 01:35:55,884
we can go after having tea, little Parotta
and meat curry.

1196
01:35:56,361 --> 01:35:57,623
What say, sister?

1197
01:35:57,863 --> 01:35:59,728
The feast you gave so far is
more than enough.

1198
01:35:59,932 --> 01:36:01,900
The rest can him after
the court's decision.

1199
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:05,228
Enough. Let rest of the things
be decided by court.

1200
01:36:05,604 --> 01:36:08,903
So, will you go back there after
the court's decision?

1201
01:36:09,107 --> 01:36:11,234
Not there or anywhere else.

1202
01:36:12,377 --> 01:36:14,174
ln that case, let us see.
- l'll show you.

1203
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:15,405
Come

1204
01:36:16,848 --> 01:36:19,078
When l heard stay order,
l became 'angoush'

1205
01:36:19,685 --> 01:36:20,913
He means unconscious.

1206
01:36:32,397 --> 01:36:32,988
Who is that?

1207
01:36:34,566 --> 01:36:35,362
l am Malli.

1208
01:36:35,567 --> 01:36:38,934
Whether it is Malli or chilli,
no one is in there. Look here.

1209
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,598
Tomorrow you take them to the grazing field.
Let the rehearsal be done in style.

1210
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,770
Money is not our aim, it is the cup, trophy.
You know. Go.

1211
01:36:50,983 --> 01:36:54,282
Why Chellakili, this way to see this bullock?

1212
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:59,350
What? Bullock? - Oh yes.
That day, you referred me as that.

1213
01:37:01,827 --> 01:37:05,354
To tell the truth, only my left eye is damaged.

1214
01:37:05,597 --> 01:37:06,962
My ears are sharp you know.

1215
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:13,294
l said that because you behaved
like that if even after knowing who l' am.

1216
01:37:13,672 --> 01:37:17,972
That is because l don't want to
remember old happenings.

1217
01:37:18,176 --> 01:37:20,644
Both of us suffered loss. Forget it. Ok.

1218
01:37:20,846 --> 01:37:22,143
Why did you come Chellakili?

1219
01:37:23,348 --> 01:37:25,316
Mother would've wept again. lsn't it?

1220
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:27,981
Don't take it lightly.

1221
01:37:29,488 --> 01:37:32,889
l know l've no right to tell this.
But l know that mother.

1222
01:37:33,425 --> 01:37:36,986
Forthe mistake committed once,
that poorthing has suffered so much.

1223
01:37:37,362 --> 01:37:39,990
l've come again because l don't want
to see it any more.

1224
01:37:41,767 --> 01:37:44,327
When she knew about the stay order,

1225
01:37:44,536 --> 01:37:47,835
she is worried that you'll go back
without even informing her.

1226
01:37:48,707 --> 01:37:54,009
That is it. Whatever it is there
are people to see it.

1227
01:37:54,212 --> 01:37:56,009
But to see the tears in my one eye,

1228
01:37:56,381 --> 01:38:00,681
there is only sky above and
some bullocks.

1229
01:38:00,986 --> 01:38:03,853
Because l realized this fact from childhood,
l take tears lightly.

1230
01:38:04,556 --> 01:38:06,524
Anyway you've come again.

1231
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:08,521
So go and tell that l don't've
any complaint.

1232
01:38:08,994 --> 01:38:11,963
Still can't you come to make here happy.

1233
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:16,199
l am still afraid to knock at the
door with a son's right.

1234
01:38:17,135 --> 01:38:21,196
But she can come here.
She need not fear anyone.

1235
01:38:21,406 --> 01:38:25,035
ls it enough? Then how is your
flower business?

1236
01:38:25,243 --> 01:38:26,471
Now it is season.
-What's that?

1237
01:38:27,012 --> 01:38:28,639
Good business.
- Oh! That.

1238
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:31,540
Then Chellakilli, go..
- Not Chellakili. l am Malli

1239
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:32,717
Then Mallikili go.

1240
01:38:53,605 --> 01:38:55,903
Why did you stab me from behind?

1241
01:38:57,209 --> 01:38:58,904
By whose order is this
playing with knife?

1242
01:39:00,112 --> 01:39:04,014
lf you don't tell, l will cut yourthroat.
Tell.

1243
01:39:04,216 --> 01:39:05,581
Rajaselvam sir.

1244
01:39:20,465 --> 01:39:22,933
This wound will heal with
some herbal juices.

1245
01:39:23,201 --> 01:39:25,101
Why do you want to inject with
needles all that.

1246
01:39:25,303 --> 01:39:26,429
All because of you.
You brought me here.

1247
01:39:26,638 --> 01:39:28,265
This is to prevent Tetanus.

1248
01:39:28,473 --> 01:39:31,442
Sister, whether it is titanic
or anything else, pain is pain only.

1249
01:39:34,312 --> 01:39:35,939
What happened brother?

1250
01:39:36,314 --> 01:39:40,114
Some one came and stabbed me.
That's all

1251
01:39:40,318 --> 01:39:42,286
Forthis there is no need for
everybody to come.

1252
01:39:42,487 --> 01:39:43,613
Then didn't you catch him?

1253
01:39:43,822 --> 01:39:45,619
How can l catch him without
seeing him?

1254
01:39:45,824 --> 01:39:47,291
He came to my left side

1255
01:39:48,326 --> 01:39:49,793
Wasn't this girl with you?

1256
01:39:49,995 --> 01:39:50,791
You too didn't see him?

1257
01:39:51,329 --> 01:39:52,626
lf you ask me...

1258
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:55,299
She didn't see him.
How could she see?

1259
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,127
The incident happened while she was leaving.

1260
01:40:01,006 --> 01:40:03,474
By the grace of God only this much happened

1261
01:40:03,675 --> 01:40:06,803
lf anything serious happened. Malli, tell the truth.

1262
01:40:07,012 --> 01:40:07,637
Dey! Why are you asking her?

1263
01:40:07,846 --> 01:40:10,474
lt's me who is wounded.

1264
01:40:10,849 --> 01:40:11,816
Why don't you believe what l say?

1265
01:40:12,384 --> 01:40:14,181
l am seeing you from the age of ten.

1266
01:40:14,352 --> 01:40:15,649
l can understand when you lie.

1267
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:16,980
Forthat who said lies?

1268
01:40:17,189 --> 01:40:20,647
No. Once when you saw the marks
of beating by my teacher on me,

1269
01:40:20,859 --> 01:40:23,987
feeling sad, you went to fight
with him that night itself.

1270
01:40:24,196 --> 01:40:31,329
To understand that you are lying l don't need
the brain from the education you gave me.

1271
01:40:31,536 --> 01:40:33,003
Hey! What is the necessity
of telling here now?

1272
01:40:33,205 --> 01:40:34,331
Now what has happened?

1273
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:36,832
Dasappa, you escort her home.

1274
01:40:37,542 --> 01:40:39,339
Enough of medicine and all.
Let us go.

1275
01:40:40,045 --> 01:40:41,012
Then you go.

1276
01:40:41,379 --> 01:40:43,506
l'll search forthe pig who did this.

1277
01:40:43,715 --> 01:40:45,512
Leave it Varkicha, Silly cases.

1278
01:40:45,717 --> 01:40:48,845
For Manikyam it may be silly.
But for me it is a failure.

1279
01:40:49,054 --> 01:40:52,353
l've been guarding from left and right
for a long time.

1280
01:40:53,058 --> 01:40:55,185
Till now there was not even
a bruise on your body.

1281
01:40:55,393 --> 01:40:56,360
l didn't allow it to happen.

1282
01:40:56,561 --> 01:40:57,357
But today it happened.

1283
01:40:57,562 --> 01:40:59,189
That is a defeat for me.

1284
01:40:59,397 --> 01:41:01,194
lt's alright if you haven't seen the man,
l'll find him out.

1285
01:41:01,733 --> 01:41:06,033
Once upon a time we were able to find
whose knife was that

1286
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:08,536
from the depth of the wound and from
the number of stitches.

1287
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:11,038
l haven't forgotten the skill even now.

1288
01:41:11,409 --> 01:41:13,536
Enough said. We'll decide the rest.

1289
01:41:13,745 --> 01:41:15,542
Decide anything you want.

1290
01:41:15,747 --> 01:41:17,874
But the world is not going to end tonight.

1291
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,877
Our world is you only.

1292
01:41:20,085 --> 01:41:23,054
lt is shame on us if we give time forthem
who came to harm you.

1293
01:41:23,255 --> 01:41:24,051
Come Varkicha. - Come.

1294
01:41:24,256 --> 01:41:25,223
Hey! Listen!

1295
01:41:26,424 --> 01:41:32,727
When everything was going to settle down,
that donkey had this stupid idea.

1296
01:41:33,265 --> 01:41:36,234
Oh God! what are those three
going to do now.

1297
01:41:58,957 --> 01:42:00,754
Hey, what is this? Leave me.

1298
01:42:10,268 --> 01:42:10,734
Mother!

1299
01:42:10,969 --> 01:42:13,597
No use of coming here now and shouting

1300
01:42:13,805 --> 01:42:15,773
Why Verghese chetta,
she is shouting?

1301
01:42:16,641 --> 01:42:18,268
Somebody kidnapped Selvam

1302
01:42:20,045 --> 01:42:22,513
l came to know this when Madhavan
rang up from the company

1303
01:42:23,048 --> 01:42:25,175
l didn't tell you because you will worry.

1304
01:42:25,383 --> 01:42:29,012
Not somebody, it is he your
millionaire son Manikyam.

1305
01:42:29,387 --> 01:42:31,855
When we both joined together,
he lost his role.

1306
01:42:32,057 --> 01:42:35,686
To take revenge he gave money
to goondas and got it done.

1307
01:42:35,894 --> 01:42:41,025
How can you be sure? Your dear brother
has no dearth of enemies.

1308
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:44,869
l don't think Manikyam will do this.

1309
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:48,870
Oh! God!
- No use of calling God from here.

1310
01:42:49,074 --> 01:42:51,542
Go and tell him to release Selvam.

1311
01:42:51,743 --> 01:42:55,702
lf you want to get the dear brother... go.

1312
01:42:55,914 --> 01:42:59,873
Go and fall at his feet that
Millionaire's son feet.

1313
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:03,880
He was born to your mother
so he is your brother.

1314
01:43:04,089 --> 01:43:05,386
One thing l tell you.

1315
01:43:06,391 --> 01:43:12,489
With money and might, only one person can save
Selvam now, Rajamanikyam.

1316
01:43:37,055 --> 01:43:44,018
l kept aside my son who wanted me, to become
mother of a boy who didn't want me.

1317
01:43:45,296 --> 01:43:48,026
Today somebody kidnapped him.

1318
01:43:48,233 --> 01:43:50,701
Your sister says that they are your men.

1319
01:43:55,273 --> 01:44:00,711
l want him. This mother has only
one person to request, you.

1320
01:44:20,432 --> 01:44:23,890
lt is true that we found in Wynad
the man who stabbed you and beat him.

1321
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:27,402
But we didn't do anything to the person
who ordered him to do that.

1322
01:44:27,605 --> 01:44:28,572
Then who nabbed Selvam?

1323
01:44:37,615 --> 01:44:41,073
l am Perumal speaking.
What's the problem?

1324
01:44:41,786 --> 01:44:44,584
When l asked Selvam forthe money,
he wants to ask Nadar.

1325
01:44:45,123 --> 01:44:48,092
He says, you only handled it.
ls it so?

1326
01:44:50,628 --> 01:44:55,258
l handled the money?
No sir, he is lying.

1327
01:44:57,469 --> 01:44:58,436
Lord Muruga promise.

1328
01:44:59,337 --> 01:45:01,100
l didn't take a single Paisa from it.

1329
01:45:01,306 --> 01:45:02,933
He only squandered it all.

1330
01:45:04,309 --> 01:45:07,767
How can l take money from
his account sir?

1331
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:09,246
He only took everything

1332
01:45:09,814 --> 01:45:13,079
Did you hear what Nadar said.
What are you saying now?

1333
01:45:18,823 --> 01:45:19,790
Perumal this is cheating.

1334
01:45:19,991 --> 01:45:23,290
What he said is not true. l'll bring him here
and make him tell the truth.

1335
01:45:23,495 --> 01:45:24,962
Shut up.

1336
01:45:25,163 --> 01:45:29,122
Both of you pocketed my money
and cheating me now?

1337
01:45:29,334 --> 01:45:31,131
Do you think l am a fool?

1338
01:45:31,669 --> 01:45:33,967
Legally the deal is
between you and me.

1339
01:45:34,172 --> 01:45:36,640
Nadar is only a mediator.

1340
01:45:37,509 --> 01:45:38,476
You are enough for me.

1341
01:45:38,676 --> 01:45:42,305
lf you've any desire to live,
call everybody you want to call.

1342
01:45:42,847 --> 01:45:49,480
lf you've a long life somebody'll bring
the money in the from of God.

1343
01:45:51,689 --> 01:45:52,815
You go now.

1344
01:46:07,205 --> 01:46:09,332
l am Manikyam. Rajamanikyam.

1345
01:46:10,074 --> 01:46:10,836
What do you want?

1346
01:46:11,042 --> 01:46:13,510
l've come for Selvam.
He is my younger brother.

1347
01:46:16,781 --> 01:46:17,679
l want him.

1348
01:46:20,885 --> 01:46:24,343
Whetheryounger or elder,
l don't care.

1349
01:46:24,556 --> 01:46:29,357
Money. That is important.
Whoever brings it, can take him.

1350
01:46:29,561 --> 01:46:31,028
All together how much?

1351
01:46:31,229 --> 01:46:33,697
lncluding interest total
will be 2 1/2 Crores.

1352
01:46:34,732 --> 01:46:35,528
ls it possible to give?

1353
01:46:35,733 --> 01:46:39,032
Now l'll give 50 lakhs as cash.

1354
01:46:39,637 --> 01:46:42,333
Balance l'll write in paper.
- Paper?

1355
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:43,866
He means promissory note.

1356
01:46:44,075 --> 01:46:47,203
Oh! Promissory note.
Enough quite enough.

1357
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,707
Rajutta, write it.
Varkicha!

1358
01:46:58,423 --> 01:47:03,884
Oh! God! How soon it is settled.
Here you sign.

1359
01:47:17,275 --> 01:47:21,405
Manikyam your are really
a loving brother. Sit down.

1360
01:47:21,613 --> 01:47:22,580
Call him first.

1361
01:47:23,114 --> 01:47:26,083
Selvam, come here your brother
has come.

1362
01:47:35,126 --> 01:47:36,593
What are these marks Perumal?

1363
01:47:36,961 --> 01:47:38,758
Those are my boy's play

1364
01:47:39,631 --> 01:47:41,758
These boys? -Yes.

1365
01:47:48,473 --> 01:47:50,100
Selvam, you go
and sit in the car.

1366
01:47:56,648 --> 01:48:01,449
My beating business is like
your money lending business.

1367
01:48:02,487 --> 01:48:06,116
Even if l don't get back what l gave,
l will give back what l got.

1368
01:48:06,658 --> 01:48:11,960
Whether it is for Perumal or
anybody else. l will go.

1369
01:48:25,343 --> 01:48:26,139
Get down...

1370
01:48:38,222 --> 01:48:39,814
Here he is...your son.

1371
01:48:40,024 --> 01:48:41,821
To show your motheryou are
making a sacrifice,

1372
01:48:42,026 --> 01:48:43,653
You kidnapped him
by sending your men.

1373
01:48:46,197 --> 01:48:48,324
The answerforthis, should l tell her
or will you tell.

1374
01:48:53,204 --> 01:48:54,171
lt is a sacrifice.

1375
01:48:54,372 --> 01:49:01,676
Giving crores of rupees from his hard-earned
money to save your brother is a sacrifice.

1376
01:49:03,381 --> 01:49:06,839
Do you know mother, he had arranged
a man to kill Manikyam.

1377
01:49:11,389 --> 01:49:12,856
Nothing to wonder.

1378
01:49:13,124 --> 01:49:16,355
From childhood killing is his habit
then someone else has to take the blame.

1379
01:49:18,062 --> 01:49:20,189
Now do you all understand who is right
and who is wrong?

1380
01:49:20,398 --> 01:49:22,525
Varghese chetta! what is right and wrong.

1381
01:49:22,734 --> 01:49:26,534
His hatred form started from his 5th year.
Leave it.

1382
01:49:26,904 --> 01:49:32,865
But when did you become an enemy of me
who shared the same womb.

1383
01:49:34,078 --> 01:49:39,539
l thought you'll come running calling me brother
when you knew the truth. But you didn't.

1384
01:49:40,918 --> 01:49:42,385
How'll you come?

1385
01:49:42,587 --> 01:49:47,047
When you are busy building palaces,
you've no time to think about your brother,

1386
01:49:47,258 --> 01:49:49,385
father and other relations.

1387
01:49:51,963 --> 01:49:55,899
Though they wanted to deport me,
l am glad to see them both in good terms.

1388
01:49:57,769 --> 01:49:59,396
l came here forthat only.

1389
01:50:00,438 --> 01:50:05,569
Whatever it is, this foster son who intruded
doesn't want yourfather's wealth.

1390
01:50:06,277 --> 01:50:09,906
l never wished that. Leave alone wealth.

1391
01:50:10,615 --> 01:50:14,073
l was not able to ask and get even
a little affection from my own mother.

1392
01:50:24,962 --> 01:50:25,758
Come, brother.

1393
01:50:25,963 --> 01:50:29,091
Don't belittle yourself before these people
who don't understand. Come.

1394
01:50:34,872 --> 01:50:39,673
Hey, l've taken him from cattle bazaar
and brought him up instead of you.

1395
01:50:39,877 --> 01:50:41,003
He'll die for me.

1396
01:50:41,212 --> 01:50:43,009
But you send people to kill me.

1397
01:50:43,214 --> 01:50:44,511
lf either happens,

1398
01:50:44,715 --> 01:50:51,018
lt's is a defeat not only for me but also
for my father who told me to come here.

1399
01:50:53,391 --> 01:50:56,019
So, l am leaving.

1400
01:51:02,333 --> 01:51:06,292
But Brother, l've a lot of sorrows.

1401
01:51:06,904 --> 01:51:09,964
l've kept aside my left eye's
defect foryou.

1402
01:51:10,341 --> 01:51:13,640
Now l have enough and more
money to rectify it.

1403
01:51:14,178 --> 01:51:19,480
But, to rememberyou till my death,
l keep it as it is.

1404
01:51:21,018 --> 01:51:28,151
Still, didn't you tell the man you sent to
kill me that my left side is dark?

1405
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:29,485
Very good?

1406
01:51:29,694 --> 01:51:31,992
Even after suffering floggings from
the grazerfor a whole life time,

1407
01:51:32,196 --> 01:51:36,826
at last the slaughterer's knife
will be on its neck. l leave.

1408
01:51:37,368 --> 01:51:41,668
Either educated people must
decline to my level

1409
01:51:41,873 --> 01:51:45,673
or Manikyam who has not seen
any school grow as you.

1410
01:51:45,877 --> 01:51:51,008
Till any of this happens, the best thing
for me is to live with bullocks.

1411
01:51:51,215 --> 01:51:54,184
So, Manikyam is going. Come.

1412
01:52:30,254 --> 01:52:34,213
Wanted to see you at once,
though l told him many times it is not necessary.

1413
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:42,222
l fell at this feet many times there itself
confessing the sins l committed.

1414
01:52:42,433 --> 01:52:47,063
l don't want anything the rights, authority
and all that you returned.

1415
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:56,244
The rest of my life l want to live
as your brother don't go.

1416
01:52:57,048 --> 01:52:59,573
Leave it.

1417
01:53:05,957 --> 01:53:09,757
Poorthing. He is tired. Rajutta,
you make him sit in the car.

1418
01:53:16,634 --> 01:53:20,934
Varghese chetta, did you hear him
calling me, brother.

1419
01:53:22,974 --> 01:53:26,774
To see and hearthis, father is not with us.

1420
01:53:27,912 --> 01:53:30,676
But he departed from us little early.

1421
01:53:30,982 --> 01:53:33,280
He didn't die. He was killed.

1422
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,316
Who killed?

1423
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,298
l told everyone what l saw.

1424
01:53:51,502 --> 01:53:53,470
But the court, police, no one listened.

1425
01:54:48,893 --> 01:54:52,693
You killed him.
Who asked you to kill?

1426
01:55:11,582 --> 01:55:14,710
Don't kill. Nadartold me...
Simon Nadar.

1427
01:55:29,433 --> 01:55:35,565
Good. He is searching for me
with a flaming torch.

1428
01:55:35,773 --> 01:55:37,240
That is Visual impact.

1429
01:55:37,942 --> 01:55:43,403
When those two have joined their hands,
one thing is certain.

1430
01:55:43,614 --> 01:55:45,582
l am the Villain. Lazar!...

1431
01:55:46,617 --> 01:55:50,917
When l am feasting
with the Germans,

1432
01:55:51,288 --> 01:55:54,746
l'll expect a roaming call...yours.

1433
01:55:55,626 --> 01:56:01,428
That should be after keeping a wreath
on my old friend Rajaselvam.

1434
01:56:01,699 --> 01:56:10,437
You should do this because other wise he'll
kill me even if l am in a palace underthe sea.

1435
01:56:12,009 --> 01:56:16,969
Then you know that l'll come
whereveryou hide. lsn't it?

1436
01:56:17,181 --> 01:56:20,810
l know it before itself that you
are a roaming rascal.

1437
01:56:21,018 --> 01:56:23,987
l adjusted with you because
l too was worse.

1438
01:56:24,355 --> 01:56:28,314
Your deception reached its climax
at Perumal's place.

1439
01:56:29,193 --> 01:56:33,493
So you can go to live in your palace
after settling the account.

1440
01:56:33,697 --> 01:56:39,158
Considering the friendship between us
it is necessary to settle the accounts.

1441
01:56:39,370 --> 01:56:40,166
Yes.

1442
01:56:40,538 --> 01:56:44,998
Otherwise we'll both go together.
lf even hell, till that.

1443
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:00,987
Leave me. lf you are a man
come alone.

1444
01:57:01,926 --> 01:57:04,053
lf you are born for one man,
come alone.

1445
01:57:07,097 --> 01:57:08,564
Leave him.

1446
01:58:17,434 --> 01:58:19,061
Then don't forget what l said.

1447
02:01:37,534 --> 02:01:41,163
That day itself l told you that one meeting
is enough for us.

1448
02:01:42,206 --> 02:01:43,503
You didn't listen.

1449
02:01:44,041 --> 02:01:50,002
You think l don't know you killed my father
cunningly without the knowledge of even Selvam.

1450
02:01:51,882 --> 02:01:55,841
That day when you killed Pillai sir
in the court compound, l lost my life.

1451
02:01:56,253 --> 02:01:58,517
lf l go without seeing the person
who took away my life,

1452
02:01:59,056 --> 02:02:01,024
l'll become a mere bullock.

1453
02:02:01,225 --> 02:02:03,523
A bullock which even a butcher
doesn't want.

1454
02:02:04,728 --> 02:02:10,189
That l day l told you l'll bring
a new cloth to coveryou.

1455
02:02:10,734 --> 02:02:18,368
But since you are a tiger, l've brought
not a new cloth but a red cloth.

1456
02:03:27,244 --> 02:03:31,374
Such incorrigible two legged ones
require four legged bullocks.

1457
02:03:31,582 --> 02:03:32,879
Nobody can hang them.

1458
02:03:34,918 --> 02:03:40,379
Varkicha, now l can see my both
sides left and right.

1459
02:03:41,258 --> 02:03:44,557
Besides bulls are there bullocks
also here Varkicha?

1460
02:03:44,761 --> 02:03:46,729
Certainly. There are more bullocks here
than in Bellary.

1461
02:03:46,930 --> 02:03:50,229
So, from now on let all our business be here.

1462
02:03:51,101 --> 02:03:54,070
Mother and siblings are here...
What?

1463
02:03:54,771 --> 02:03:57,740
He is a lion, is our leader,
Superb and smashing!

1464
02:04:01,445 --> 02:04:03,709
He is a lion, is our leader,
Superb and smashing!

1465
02:04:03,981 --> 02:04:08,111
One either side, the cattle run,
shaking their bells.

1466
02:04:08,318 --> 02:04:10,786
Rustic music, songs and dance
Rhythmic drumbeats, accompaniments.

1467
02:04:10,988 --> 02:04:13,957
Rejoice, singing rural idylls!
