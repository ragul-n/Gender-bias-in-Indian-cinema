1
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,916
<i>Sleep climbs over the walls</i>
<i>Of time and lands in a dream</i>

2
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,833
<i>On waking, a tail twirls between his legs</i>

3
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,666
<i>A cigarette-burnt finger</i>

4
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,083
<i>A forgotten dream</i>

5
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,541
Where did this tail come from?

6
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,000
How can I go out with this?

7
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,625
Maybe only I can see it!

8
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,708
Be quiet, boy.

9
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,333
Shut up.

10
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,458
Get inside. Come on!

11
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,958
Yes.

12
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,916
A tail has grown out of nowhere.

13
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,750
Everyone's staring at me!

14
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,958
Can women ever
have peace of mind?

15
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:47,916
-Hey!
-Hey!

16
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,583
-Pervert! Who do you think you are?
-Catch hold of him!

17
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,500
What do I do now?

18
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,958
Last night, I went to sleep.

19
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,750
I don't know what
happened when I was asleep.

20
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,875
I woke up with a tail grown on me.

21
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,000
But I won't meet a psychiatrist.

22
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,958
Whatever comes in
my sleep is just a dream.

23
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,083
But I can't remember anything!

24
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,666
Is the dream a problem?

25
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,125
<i>My strange dream has</i>
<i>caused me a lot of suffering.</i>

26
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,916
<i>It has left me confused.</i>

27
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,125
<i>The dreams within</i>
<i>dreams has crippled me.</i>

28
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,166
<i>The taste of madness is stuck to my tongue</i>

29
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,458
<i>and I would often</i>
<i>grind my teeth at night.</i>

30
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:15,125
<i>My wife complained that she</i>
<i>couldn't sleep peacefully at night.</i>

31
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,375
{\an8}<i>I will still not meet the psychiatrist.</i>

32
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,291
<i>If I meet the psychiatrist and</i>
<i>tell him about my dream,</i>

33
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,125
<i>they'll just make up some disease,</i>
<i>chain me up…</i>

34
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,125
<i>and brand me a madman.</i>

35
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:34,916
<i>I was tortured by the dream's evil</i>
<i>energy and consumed by darkness.</i>

36
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,416
<i>At that time, I saw a titled</i>
<i>house under a banyan tree</i>

37
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,166
<i>near the Kelambakkam Bus stand.</i>

38
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,500
<i>There lived a soothsayer</i>
<i>who interprets dreams.</i>

39
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,125
<i>My wife's younger brother said that</i>

40
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,916
<i>her predictions always come true.</i>

41
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,250
Grandma.

42
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,083
Grandma.

43
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:10,875
Who's that?

44
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,166
I came to see you.

45
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,916
Why did you come to meet me?

46
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,750
I heard that you interpret dreams.

47
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,833
That's what the blog said.

48
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,458
What does a "blag" mean?

49
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,708
It means, a computer.

50
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,166
Why do they write about all this?

51
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,666
No one needs to know.
We want to stay hidden.

52
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,041
I heard that your interpretations
are always correct.

53
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,875
If my children found out, they'd kill me!

54
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,458
Why are you squirming?

55
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,666
That's my problem.

56
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,666
That's why I came to see you.

57
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,541
What is your problem? Tell me.

58
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,000
Do dreams come true, Grandma?

59
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,041
Of course!

60
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,708
Dreams are nothing
but the world's desires.

61
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,833
By interpreting dreams…

62
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,833
they were able to save an
entire country from famine.

63
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,041
What are you saying?

64
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,458
During Biblical times,
there once lived a king.

65
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,708
He had a strange dream.

66
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:43,416
He dreamt of seven fat
buffaloes who were grazing in a field.

67
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,208
And out of nowhere, seven
famished-looking buffaloes appeared…

68
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,250
and swallowed the
seven healthy buffaloes.

69
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,333
No one knew its meaning.

70
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:06,291
The ministers racked
their brains but it was of no use.

71
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,750
Then, a fortune-teller…

72
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,458
who had heard of the
king's predicament…

73
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,750
listened to the dream
and gave an interpretation.

74
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,791
The seven fat
buffaloes signified…

75
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,916
seven years of prosperity.

76
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,500
The seven starving
buffaloes represented…

77
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,625
seven years of famine.

78
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,208
The past seven prosperous years…

79
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,000
will be swallowed by seven
years of famine.

80
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,666
Through this, they were
able to prevent the famine.

81
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,000
Instead of looking at
dreams as disorders,

82
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,458
they searched for its meaning
and solved many problems.

83
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,708
Why are you squirming continuously?

84
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,541
That's the problem, Grandma!

85
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,041
I was sleepy last night.

86
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,833
I fell asleep.

87
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,750
I think… I had a dream.

88
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,250
I woke up with a startle!

89
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,083
I woke up and realized…

90
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,458
that I'd grown a horse's tail.

91
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,541
Look here!

92
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,458
What?

93
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,458
Yes, Grandma!

94
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,041
There's no tail!

95
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,041
What are you saying, Grandma?

96
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,208
Can't you see the tail?

97
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,333
It's right here!

98
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,791
It isn't visible to me!

99
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,708
Really?

100
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,416
Even while you are talking to me,

101
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,416
the tail is thrashing from head to toe!

102
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,875
How did the tail grow?

103
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,708
What was your dream?

104
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,458
I can foretell only if
you tell me your dream.

105
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,625
I can't remember anything.

106
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,041
Close your eyes and think.

107
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,583
See if you remember anything.

108
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,875
{\an8}"Atop an endless wall,
embedded with shards of glass,

109
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,666
{\an8}walks elegantly, a word called "cat".

110
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,208
Yes, a word.

111
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,958
When it is followed for a while,
it turns into a sentence.

112
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,208
And if the sentence's motion,
were pierced by a shard of glass,

113
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,291
{\an8}the blood that trickles down
the wall and can be read like a poem.

114
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,916
If you expect it to be a poem
about a cat, you will be fooled."

115
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,083
<i>In an affluent apartment</i>
<i>building in West Mambalam,</i>

116
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:35,958
<i>a middle-aged man was found</i>
<i>dead along with 200 syringes of blood.</i>

117
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,750
<i>The man, identified as Babu,</i>

118
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>is survived by his</i>
<i>wife and daughter.</i>

119
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:30,291
<i>I am the oasis</i>
<i>That quenches thirst wherever you go</i>

120
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,416
Hello, sir. Are you off to work?

121
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,166
<i>I am the tune sung by waterfalls</i>
<i>In the mountains</i>

122
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,291
Look at them.
The dogs aren't like humans.

123
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,125
They express their
deepest feelings by licking.

124
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,958
That's the reason why
their tongue is always moist. Hey!

125
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,541
-Hey.
-Give me a clove cigarette.

126
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:57,708
-<i>I survive with whatever I find next</i>
-Hey!

127
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,750
Where are you going?

128
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:03,250
-<i>And satiate my hunger everyday</i>
-Hey!

129
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,500
<i>The scene changes even as we see it</i>

130
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,000
<i>How mysterious is this life?</i>

131
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,125
<i>With no goal or yearning</i>

132
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,750
<i>I am the wonder that lives on</i>

133
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
{\an8}Don't get me wrong, sir.

134
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,916
{\an8}I didn't steal the flame.
I just shared it.

135
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,875
{\an8}Loneliness is not a good feeling.

136
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,166
We only see doors having
conversations in apartments.

137
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:49,000
Loneliness is a never-ending spiral.

138
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,166
It goes on and on.

139
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,291
{\an8}Once when I was sleeping,

140
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,833
{\an8}I woke up and saw that all
the loneliness in my heart

141
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,666
{\an8}overflowed in the form
of tears from my eyes.

142
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,333
{\an8}That's when I got the frog.

143
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,083
{\an8}By "frog", I don't mean
the actual frog but him.

144
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,333
{\an8}This leash…

145
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,625
{\an8}is not meant to control him.

146
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,250
{\an8}This is the bond between us.

147
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,583
{\an8}Let's go.

148
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,166
Sir.

149
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,416
You haven't filled the
account holder's name.

150
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,291
What's the account holder's name?
Please fill it.

151
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,208
Name?

152
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,916
Why do you need the name?

153
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,041
Why are these stupid formalities needed?

154
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,125
I can tell you the account
number, and you can verify it.

155
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,041
I've filled the branch
name correctly, right?

156
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,416
You can check it with the same.

157
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,000
Why do you need the name?

158
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,375
You've labelled everything
with numbers, right?

159
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,458
If I deposit a large sum of cash,
you'll ask for my PAN number.

160
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,291
If that isn't enough,
you'll ask for ID proof as well.

161
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,125
Everything is marked in numbers anyway.

162
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,416
<i>Token number--</i>

163
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,333
Isn't name a pointless identity?

164
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,250
Counter number two!

165
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,583
Sir…

166
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,333
aren't you Professor Stuart Koteeswaran?

167
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,708
Sir, I'm your student!

168
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,208
How are you?

169
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,250
I tried to draw your name

170
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,333
from the vault of my lost memory
by scratching my head.

171
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,833
It's been ages, right?

172
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,125
One minute, sir.

173
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
Get back to work now.

174
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Visit me at home later.

175
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,250
Definitely, sir.

176
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,041
See you, then.

177
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,041
There is a gap over there.
Why isn't a gap here?

178
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,458

<i>seeing everything through a window.</i>

<i>Counter number two.</i>

183
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,291
The account number is wrong.

184
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,166
The account number is wrong!

185
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,916
Did you hear what I said?

186
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,333
{\an8}Hello, Mr. Saravanan?

187
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,500
{\an8}Sorry, wrong--

188
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,541
{\an8}Sir, isn't this flat 11-B?

189
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,583
What do you want?

190
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,958
Sir, I'm from IDB Life Insurance.

191
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,083
-Okay.
-Don't your remember me?

192
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,250
No.

193
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,041
Sir, the nameboard
reads Saravanan a well.

194
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,708
Is today a holiday?

195
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,458
I'm a bit stressed.

196
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,333
I can see that, sir.

197
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,416
Sir, we had a premium plan six months ago

198
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,333
and I had come as a
representative of my company.

199
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,916
-Sorry. Something seems wrong.
-No.

200
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,291
-There's no one here by that name.
-No, sir.

201
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,750
I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.

202
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,625
Excuse me. Didn't you
explain this yesterday?

203
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,250
Tell me the formalities.
Let's get it over with.

204
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,291
Definitely, sir.

205
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,166
Sir… "Saravanan."

206
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,583
You need to fill the name as "Saravanan."

207
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,333
Please fill the application…

208
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,666
and sign on the places I've marked.

209
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,791
I think you don't remember it.

210
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:39,583
It's Saravanan, sir!

211
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,083
Sir, you had filled your
name as "Saravanan"

212
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,708
in the previous year's
application as well.

213
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,333
I remember it.

214
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,958
My name is Freud!

215
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,250
No, sir. Your name is Saravanan.
I'm sure about it.

216
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,375
<i>Counter number five.</i>

217
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,166
Sir!

218
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,750
Sir!

219
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,500
Sir!

220
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,333
Mrs. Kowski Kirupaakaran,

221
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,000
can you manage my
counter for ten minutes?

222
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,916
-Sir.
-Wait a minute.

223
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,250
Please process my transaction first.

224
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,250
Token number one--

225
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,833
I got a call from the apartment.

226
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,500
I forgot to close the tap.

227
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,791
Can I go out for ten minutes?

228
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll just close it and come back.

229
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,708
Okay, who will look after your counter?

230
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,041
Mrs. Kowski Kirupaakaran
said that she will handle it.

231
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,250
Okay, make it quick.

232
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:57,958
Thank you, sir.

233
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,125
He is always careless!

234
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:04,250
<i>Token number one.</i>

235
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,416

00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:22,166
<i>In the fire accident that occurred</i>
<i>at Ervadi's private sanatorium,</i>

237
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,125
<i>more than 30 mentally</i>
<i>challenged patients were killed.</i>

238
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:31,333
<i>After this, the High Court passed a rule</i>
<i>to not chain the patients.</i>

239
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:36,166
<i>Though the practice was abolished,</i>
<i>but situations have changed recently.</i>

240
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,500
<i>The practice of chaining patients</i>
<i>in mental institutions is resurfacing.</i>

Oh, no!

246
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,375
I'm late.

247
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,458
Ms. Kowski.

248
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:38,833
<i>Token number three-six--</i>

00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,375

250
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:58,375
Hello?

251
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,041
Saravanan?

252
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,208
Hello?

253
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,375
Sir, I'm at a client's place.

254
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,875
The client's name is Saravanan, sir.

255
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,250
But he says it's Freud!

256
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,000
His previous application
reads the name as "Saravanan."

257
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,333
I think maybe he changed his name.

258
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,291
What's your name, mister?

259
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What's your name?

260
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,916
Would you like it if
I changed your name?

261
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,875
Sir.

262
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,916
You're trying to
destroy my identity.

263
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,708
-Sir? You're getting me--
-You're all in on this together.

264
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,375
No, sir. I'm just a marketing--

265
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,583
What proof do you
have that I'm Saravanan?

266
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,666
-Aadhaar-- Sir!
-Tell me!

267
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,250
I have your government ID!

268
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,291
If you show me your Aadhaar card,
we can clarify this once and for all.

269
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:51,541
Sir, I'll call you back.
No problem, sir.

270
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,500
Here. Have a look at it.

271
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,583
Sir!

272
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,541
The cheque will bounce!
What are you doing?

273
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,833
You're filling it wrong--
It says "Saravanan" here!

274
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:14,666
Your company is trying
to erase my identity.

275
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,708
-Come on, sir--
-You're trying to erase my identity.

276
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,125
You're that company's henchman.

277
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,250
How would you feel if
I changed your name?

278
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,666
That's not possible--

279
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,000
Do you think you can band
together, erase my identity,

280
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,500
and turn me into a madman?

281
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,958
Of course not, sir!

282
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,875
I think you're worked up.

283
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,791
You're worrying for no reason.

284
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,250
Are you making me a
refugee in my own country?

285
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,583
Sir!

286
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,750
Sir, I think you're upset.

287
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,958
Sir, I work for the private sector.
You can't treat me this way.

288
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:03,000
I can't hear you!
Speak a little louder.

289
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,125
Listen to me, sir!

290
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,416
Saravanan!

291
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,416
-I've been waiting for so long.
-Sir, listen to me.

292
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,958
-Sir?
-The manager will be here.

293
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:16,500
-Saravanan, everyone's watching!
-Sir, what are you doing?

294
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,916
-Stop that.
-He is not answering me.

295
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,250
What the hell!

296
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,750
The customers are waiting here,
and he's playing with a ball!

297
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,083
Sir!

298
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,125
Sir!

299
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,291
What's happening here?

300
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,625
Customers are waiting
and he's playing!

301
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:45,750
Saravanan!

302
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,041
Saravanan? Do you
know what you're doing?

303
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,291
Can you hear me?

304
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,041
Saravanan!

305
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,583
Why are you doing this?

306
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,208
Please maintain the decorum
of the bank, Saravanan!

307
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,916
This is definitely going to be
a black mark on your track record.

308
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,625
Saravanan, this is incorrigible.

309
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,000
Just give me the ball!

310
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:07,958
Saravanan!

311
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,625
Saravanan, this is incorrigible.

312
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,000
Saravanan, just give me the ball!

313
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,166
Saravanan!

314
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,166
Hey!

315
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,291
-What happened?
-You don't know?

316
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,708
What do you think?

317
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,666
-It's nothing, sir.
-Where's the security?

318
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,291
Did he call the police?

319
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,416
-Security!
-What are you doing? Call the police.

320
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,708
Where the hell were you?

321
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,416
I am coming, sir.

322
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,208
Slave of America's autocracy!

323
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,500
You traitor! I'll kill you!

324
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,708
Burn to ashes!

325
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,541
Stop mumbling! I can't hear you!

326
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,750
Do you think you can drive me crazy?

327
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,000
You American mercenary!

328
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,208
You erase my name and wage psychological
war for the sake of an incentive!

329
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,958
I'll meet you at
the International Court of Law.

330
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,166
-This is a psychological war.
-You shouldn't be spared!

331
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,375
Psychological war.

332
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,916
I'll win this war against
the multinational corporation.

333
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,625
I'll sue this establishment
for defamation.

334
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,791
Conspiracy! Betrayal! Psychological war!

335
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,250
Psychological war!

336
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,625
Sir, calm down.

337
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:40,791
Take this pill.

338
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,625
-Sir, please don't. Don't play here.
-Dude. Stop that!

339
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,833
-Please stop playing here.
-What is wrong with you?

340
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,458
Please don't, sir. Calm down, sir.

341
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,041
-Just watch what I do to you.
-Listen to me.

342
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:51,583
-I can't wait to kick you out of here!
-Sir!

343
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,333
Catch that mad dog!

344
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,416
If you try to lift me,
you'll be here all day.

345
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,541
Go, catch him instead!

346
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:03,041
-Sir, please give me that ball.
-Call the police.

347
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,250
{\an8}Wait right there!

348
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,166
Get hold of him
and take him to the police.

349
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,541
Call the police.

350
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,666
Get a hold of him!

351
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:33,416
-Sir, why are you behaving like a child?
-I won't spare you!

352
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,541
-Mr. Saravanan.
-Get him!

353
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:38,291
Holy Mary Mother of God.

354
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,000
What did he do?

355
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,583
Sir, he was playing with a ball.

356
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,166
What? Playing with a ball?

357
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,166
-Is this why you called the station?
-No, sir.

358
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,833
-You have--
-Sir, excuse me.

359
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,083
We have a final process to complete.

360
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,791
Confiscate his ID card.

361
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,833
Sir, hand over your ID card.

362
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,708
Sir, this is your dismissal order.

363
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,875
I had a steady income of 35,000 rupees.

364
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,916
Why did I do that?

365
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,875
What will I do for a living now?

366
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,666
It's good that the police
let me go with a warning.

367
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:23,125
Or else I don't know what
would've happened.

368
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,375
Psycho!

369
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,708
Don't you dare come here again.

370
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,791
Go and bounce that ball
on your father's head.

371
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,375
Sir! I'm the policeman here.
Let me do my job.

372
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,541
Would they have hung me?

373
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,083
Give me the ball!

374
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,500
Hello, Mr. Babu! Sir!

375
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:14,291
Sir! Mr. Saravanan!
He's angry. Please leave.

376
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,583
Ask him to give me my ball.

377
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:16,958
Go there.

378
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,791
-Don't let him in! Throw him out!
-I need my ball, sir.

379
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,958
-I'll take my ball and leave.
-Sir.

380
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,666
-I need my ball.
-Are you listening to me or not?

381
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,833
-Don't try to pacify me.
-Why aren't you listening to me?

382
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,000
Throw him out of office!

383
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:31,375
-Can you please stop shouting?
-You scum! Get out!

384
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:34,333
You only have the right to fire me,
not to confiscate my ball.

385
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:35,625
-Give my ball back. I'll leave.
-Hey!

386
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:36,916
To heck with you!

387
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,916
Hey!

388
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:40,666
Sir!

389
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:43,250
Now you're here?

390
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,208
Chase him out!
Don't ever let him come in again!

391
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,250
I can see what I missed.

392
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,541
But I just saw it!

393
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,250
How can it go missing?

394
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,083
What are you looking
for outside, Mr. Babu?

395
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,833
Frog and I had been
for our evening walk.

396
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,041
You came walking in
the opposite direction.

397
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,250
I greeted you…

398
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,875
but you must've
been lost in thought.

399
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:21,250
There's scotch. Will you have a drink?

400
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:26,458
It all depends on the accompaniment.

401
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,583
It's nothing great.
We will have a conversation.

402
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,250
Should I mix water?

403
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,041
Have you heard of the
Irish actor Barry Fitzgerald?

404
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,375
Do you know what he said?

405
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,583
"When I drink water, I drink plain water.

406
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,416
When I drink whisky,
I drink whisky alone."

407
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,416
Thank you!

408
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,291
What are you searching for, Mr. Babu?

409
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,125
The moon disappeared, sir.

410
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,500
That's not something you
should search outside…

411
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,375
but in phantasm.

412
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:44,750
Now…

413
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,041
the way the "person" Babu
hidden in the name Babu…

414
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,625
is personified by you.

415
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,250
When I see myself in the
mirror, I only see my opposite.

416
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,541
That's the case with those
who see face-to-face as well.

417
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,666
That's how you appear to me.

418
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,000
That's because…

419
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:15,666
seeing me in you,
and you in me

420
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,333
is why all of this is happening.

421
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,083
Where's Frog, sir?

422
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,958
Oh! She's sleeping.

423
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,000
I am sorry to have disturbed you.

424
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Can you hear it speak to you?

425
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,666
Can you understand what it says?

426
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,666
You told your memories.
Now tell me your dreams.

427
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,416
I can't remember anything.

428
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,750
The termites of time aren't satisfied by
just eating our corpse.

429
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:53,125
So they gobble up our
stories and manuscripts…

430
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:59,291
and all the hidden
papers and burp it out!

431
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:02,000
As though that wasn't enough…

432
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,250
they've started to eat
our dreams as well.

433
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,250
How can they eat that?

434
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:14,291
An unplucked fruit has
worms inside it, right?

435
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,541
It's the similar case.

436
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,083
Others may not believe
that you have grown a tail.

437
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,166
But I believe you!

438
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,125
Your tail and dreams are connected.

439
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:35,166
You were a horse in your previous life.

440
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,291
What are you saying?

441
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,708
This tail has grown
to remind you of that.

442
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,833
So? Why would a tail grow?

443
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:56,291
You've wanted to turn into a horse.

444
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,375
That's why the tail has grown.

445
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,500
And now in a few days, you'll
turn into a horse!

446
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,500
Earlier you used to
sit up straight, right?

447
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,583
-Now you sit hunched, right?
-Yes.

448
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:11,083
Yes, Grandma.

449
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:15,708
Now, your hands
and legs will shrivel up…

450
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,000
and turn into a horse entirely!

451
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,041
What do I do now?

452
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:26,666
What if her words were to come true?

453
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,333
I used to walk straight.

454
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,750
Now I walk with a hunch.

455
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:36,333
I don't know if others can see
this tail or not…

456
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,208
but…

457
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,541
the tail has indeed grown.

458
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,166
I won't turn into a horse.

459
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:44,833
Why would you say such a thing?

460
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,708
You mad dog! How dare you do that!

461
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,083
Get out!

462
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:52,166
-Useless fellow!
-How can you say that?

463
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,125
Lunatic! Good-for-nothing!

464
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,666
Get out!

465
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,791
Come this way again
and I'll cut your tail off.

466
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:58,916
Shit-eater!

467
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,541
<i>If it is true that a tail has grown,</i>

468
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,666
<i>my prophecy will come true.</i>

469
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,583
Such a beautiful horse!

470
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,750
How does this
horse not have a tail?

471
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,083
This horse is so beautiful.

472
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,250
But it doesn't have a tail.

473
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,625
What happened to its tail?

474
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,041
I lost something in my memory,
and am searching for it in dreams.

475
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,083
Excuse me.

476
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,208
What was my question?

477
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,458
I asked why there's no tail.

478
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:28,583
And you're saying
something completely random.

479
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:33,083
I just said I'm searching for
my lost memories in my dreams.

480
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:37,708
Maybe…

481
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,833
this could be a hybrid horse.

482
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Is this a hybrid horse?

483
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:12,625
Hey, who are you?

484
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:15,833
How did you enter my house?

485
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:20,416
Who said this is your house?

486
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:24,375
How could this
house be only yours?

487
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,125
I've been here for ages.

488
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,958
Get out of my house!

489
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:37,625
I just told you.

490
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,625
How could this house be only yours?

491
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,916
The rat that preys at night,
the cat that hunts them,

492
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,291
the moth that circles the
light, the lizard that eats them,

493
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,916
the cockroach that
comes seeking novelties,

494
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,375
the spider that casts its net
and makes a home in the nooks…

495
00:44:55,458 --> 00:45:00,750
all these lives have been living here
a long time before you came along.

496
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,166
Yeah.

497
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,125
I…

498
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,416
I've seen all of these before…

499
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,791
but… I've never seen you.

500
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:19,708
You have just seen the
world behind mirages.

501
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,958
That's why you can see me.

502
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,666
Why does your ear look so grotesque?

503
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:30,291
You all are the cause for that.

504
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,791
Us?

505
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,000
My name is Vaanavil.

506
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,791
People call me Van Gogh.

507
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:37,875
That's me.

508
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:42,291
I announce the joy of rain to people.

509
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:46,500
When it rains, thunder
and lightning scare you.

510
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:49,666
It is I who shows that
there's nothing to fear.

511
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,791
That rain makes the earth colorful.

512
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,541
I express this through the
seven vibgyor colours.

513
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:00,583
Only if I hear the
sound of rain will I arrive.

514
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:05,875
But now the trees and
mountains have all been destroyed.

515
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:11,375
One of my ears got burnt because
of global warming and pollution.

516
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,208
Even now I'm listening
to you with only one ear.

517
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,000
Who's there?

518
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:51,083
I came to see
Professor Stuart Koteeswaran.

519
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,041
Who are you?

520
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,416
I am one of his old students.

521
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,208
Did you study in the school
where he taught for six months?

522
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,583
What did you see in him
that you've come this far?

523
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:05,875
For 20 years, he's been
scribbling numbers everywhere

524
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:09,791
in the name of Maths research,
and talking to himself like a lunatic.

525
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,625
All this while I've been
running the house.

526
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,583
Who's there?

527
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,625
It's one of your student.

528
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,416
Who?

529
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:19,000
Freud.

530
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,166
Someone called Freud!

531
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,125
Freud?

532
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:25,958
I never had a student called Freud.

533
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,791
I remember all my students' names.

534
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,208
Okay, send him down.

535
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:32,625
Go on.

536
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:17,458
Sir, remove the lens and look!

537
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,250
Saravanan.

538
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,375
How did you find your way here?

539
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,625
My name isn't Saravanan, sir.

540
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:27,625
It's Freud.

541
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,333
Freud?

542
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,291
Hey, your name is Saravanan.

543
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:35,500
I remembered only after I
returned from the bank that day.

544
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,916
This is my problem, sir.

545
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,500
For a while now,
everyone's been saying this.

546
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,875
Didn't you say that Math
has the solution to everything?

547
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,041
That's why I came to see you.

548
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:47,750
What are you saying?

549
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:50,583
When did I say that Math
has a solution to everything?

550
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,833
Sir, you said every problem in
the world has a solution in Math!

551
00:48:56,125 --> 00:49:00,916
Yes. Every problem in the
world has a solution but--

552
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:04,458
Hey! Come this way.

553
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:09,958
If you're able to identify the problem,
then Maths will have the solution.

554
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,750
Maths isn't what you think it to be.

555
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:18,166
There's an entire illusion
theory running inside it.

556
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:25,833
All deemed me unfit for society and
ostracized me just because I said this.

557
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,666
That's not right.

558
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,083
There's only one thing I can do.

559
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,250
I'm… I'm going to
create a new world.

560
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:42,333
Maths will be the only language there.

561
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,333
What? Why are you squirming?

562
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,875
That's my problem, sir.

563
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,833
That's why I came to see you.

564
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,375
No, thanks.

565
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,208
Is there a solution for
my dream in Maths, sir?

566
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,208
I saw a horse in the dream.

567
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,583
The horse was so beautiful.

568
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,416
Everything was fine
until I went behind…

569
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,500
and saw that the horse had no tail!

570
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,208
I was confused. So, I asked this
girl who was around

571
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,916
as to why such a beautiful
horse had no tail.

572
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,833
And she threw a tomato at me!

573
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,375
I suddenly woke up.

574
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:58,708
Okay.

575
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,333
What's the problem here?

576
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,708
I told you the horse
didn't have a tail, right?

577
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,500
When I woke up, that
tail had grown for me, sir.

578
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,833
Every time I think, it
keeps thrashing about.

579
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,833
That's why I'm squirming so much.

580
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:24,166
Where? There's no tail!

581
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,333
Sir!

582
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,416
A tail's grown on my back, sir!

583
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,458
Others may not believe you.

584
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:34,500
But I believe you.

585
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,875
Maths is…

586
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,875
an illusion theory!

587
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,125
The psychology of dreams
is also an illusion theory!

588
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:46,958
You won't understand all this.

589
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,208
What you've got is… an illusion theory.

590
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:59,041
If you find out what your
tail is… you'll reach eternity.

591
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,416
You know what eternity is, right?

592
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,291
An endless world!

593
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:10,250
I didn't understand any of this, sir.

594
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:13,750
It's simple.

595
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,208
Where do numbers begin?

596
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:22,916
It begins with one!

597
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:25,541
Really?

598
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:29,083
Okay. Where do they end?

599
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:32,916
Sir…

600
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:35,875
it goes on and on.

601
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,083
How far does it go?

602
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,333
It goes beyond what
the eyes can see, sir!

603
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,208
It keeps increasing.

604
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,416
It keeps going on and on.

605
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,375
What does that mean?

606
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,833
Maths has no end.

607
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,750
We don't know where
it begins or ends.

608
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:15,541
If you understand this,
you can see everything.

609
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:28,625
Has it arrived?

610
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,000
Has what arrived?

611
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,541
Your dream has
arrived inside this.

612
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,708
Your dream has arrived in Maths!

613
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,250
You drew it, sir!

614
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:01,458
We have arrived at
a solution to your dream problem.

615
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,750
What solution has arrived?

616
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:08,291
The horse is here.

617
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:11,791
Well, yes, sir…

618
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:15,166
but you drew it!

619
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,750
So what if I drew it?
Has it arrived or not?

620
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,541
Yes, sir.

621
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,708
But I don't see a tail.

622
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,708
If you'd connected
it with that number "two"

623
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,333
the tail would
have appeared as well.

624
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,083
"Two" is all the way over there!

625
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,791
A horse's tail should be like this.

626
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,416
How can it connect there?

627
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,125
A horse's tail should be here!

628
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:49,375
This is your dream!

629
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:08,791
As per Darwin's theory,
humans evolved from monkeys.

630
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:15,083
We grew hands, legs and even a face.

631
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,333
But what about the tail?

632
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:23,625
Yes, sir.

633
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,916
As per Darwin's theory we
should've gotten the tail, right?

634
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,458
Where did the tail go?

635
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:38,541
We got hands and legs with the
help of evolution but not the tail.

636
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,541
What does everyone say when
children are too naughty at home?

637
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,250
"Too much of a tail."

638
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,916
When they get too naughty…
they say "Cut the tail clean".

639
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,625
Why? They could have said
anything else, right?

640
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,750
The tail is an illusion.

641
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,750
Maths is also an illusion.

642
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,750
Your subconscious is the tail.

643
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,708
You talk in riddles, sir.

644
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:12,791
The horse is a symbol of sex.

645
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,250
How is the horse a symbol of sex?

646
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:21,458
Have you seen that Tamil song
video that goes "Hold me, hold me."

647
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Yes, I have.

648
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:26,875
Why is there a horse neighing
in that song for no reason?

649
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:29,541
Yes, sir!

650
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:32,458
A horse is a symbol of sex!

651
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:34,333
In a way, it's a symbol for a girl.

652
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,208
The girl is the horse.

653
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,125
That's why it's standing there.

654
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:42,083
Have you seen
a horse's tail closely?

655
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,666
A falling cascade of hair.

656
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:46,916
It's like the hair of a beautiful girl.

657
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:53,916
So…

658
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,833
the horse is a symbol…

659
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,041
for a girl you have
forgotten in your life.

660
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,416
She's waiting for you somewhere.

661
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:06,875
And through this dream…

662
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:11,625
she's reminding you of her
in the form of a horse.

663
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,666
Have you read the book
<i>Interpretation of Dreams</i>?

664
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:18,083
Yes, sir.

665
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,208
What does it say?

666
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:22,666
Everything in real life comes to you

667
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,333
in the form of symbols
in dreams. Correct?

668
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:26,958
Yes, sir.

669
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,666
The tail that's grown…

670
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:35,583
Your desire for that girl
has grown out as a tail!

671
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:43,208
I soar through the sky without wings

672
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:50,666
<i>I become a poem with no words</i>

673
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:56,375
But there's no girl in my life, sir!

674
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:25,291
Hey.

675
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,041
Think again! I'm sure there's someone!

676
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:32,750
Maybe this tail is a sign that
you should go look for her.

677
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:41,291
<i>I come by myself</i>

678
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:44,875
<i>I give without asking</i>

679
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:47,250
Why are you singing now?

680
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:01,916
No, sir.

681
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:04,500
There's no girl in my life, sir.

682
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,333
You've forgotten your own name!

683
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,166
How would you remember the girl?

684
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:18,791
Hey.

685
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,583
Someone is calling you…

686
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,125
to an eternal world.

687
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:27,083
If you figure it out,
you can solve anything.

688
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:30,750
Are you mad?

689
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,000
Who's that?

690
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:51,708
Who are you?

691
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:56,666
I met Mr. Babu.

692
00:59:57,791 --> 01:00:00,708
He said he could see me as Mr. Babu.

693
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:06,250
He kept a conch to my ear
and asked me to listen.

694
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:08,666
I could hear the waves.

695
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:12,291
I tried to separate
the words from that noise--

696
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,708
His life was the three knots
of matrimony around my neck.

697
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,875
But now those knots
have come undone.

698
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,291
<i>I have become a colorless rainbow</i>

699
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:24,250
Sorry!

700
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,916
Sorry. Forgive me
if I said something wrong!

701
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:32,208
<i>When your memories wash over me</i>

702
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:36,958
<i>I blossom everywhere</i>

703
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:46,291
When did you see my dead father?

704
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,208
My mother had finally
started to forget him.

705
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,375
But then you mentioned him
and she's miserable again.

706
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:53,958
She's crying!

707
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:57,125
I just saw him!

708
01:00:58,041 --> 01:00:59,375
How could he be dead?

709
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:04,916
We've just realized
the "him in me" and "me in him" theory.

710
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,166
You bloody asshole.

711
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,333
What the fuck do
you think about yourself?

712
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,000
Because of you,
my mother is crying.

713
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:40,416
Why do you always look
at normal things so intently?

714
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,291
I'm looking at the world
that runs within me.

715
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,916
How? I don't understand.

716
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:59,625
"The whole can be seen in its parts."

717
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:03,666
I finally understand
what Siddha is saying.

718
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,916
<i>Water flows beneath the earth's skin.</i>

719
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,708
<i>Blood flows under the human skin.</i>

720
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:17,166
<i>Just like the mountains</i>
<i>and trees support the earth,</i>

721
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:23,958
<i>bones and nerves</i>
<i>support the human frame.</i>

722
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:31,166
<i>Just like the ocean breathes</i>
<i>the waves in and out,</i>

723
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,958
<i>human lungs breathe air in and out.</i>

724
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:50,750
<i>When the earth opens its eyes,</i>
<i>it becomes green and colorful.</i>

725
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:57,208
<i>Only when humans open their eyes,</i>
<i>will the world seem colorful.</i>

726
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,541
Where did Van Gogh go?

727
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,541
I don't know, you mongrel!

728
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:14,041
Did she tell me?

729
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,958
Or did I tell her?

730
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,250
I need to speak to her about that.

731
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,083
You piece of shit!

732
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,125
My mother is weeping!

733
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,333
Look at her crying! Can you hear her?

734
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:28,458
One second!

735
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,333
Have you looked at a candle?

736
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,625
Look at it!

737
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,791
You can see the sunset in it.

738
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,750
I'll bring a compass
and stab you to death!

739
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,000
I have the compass that killed Pinky.

740
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,875
I'll bring a needle and
stitch your mouth shut.

741
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,125
I will kill you!

742
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:53,208
Bastard! I will kill you! I will kill you!

743
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,666
She has the compass
that killed Pinky.

744
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,500
She'll kill me with it.

745
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,916
<i>I open myself when the sun smiles</i>

746
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:24,416
<i>I let go of myself in the raindrops</i>

747
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:30,375
<i>Rivers from the past</i>

748
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:35,041
<i>Might break down barriers</i>

749
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:39,416
<i>Reality of the dreams</i>

750
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:43,833
<i>Might seek answers in the wind</i>

751
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:47,916
<i>I become the hills that stretch</i>

752
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:52,583
<i>I become the seed that sprouts</i>

753
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,458
<i>Roots might search for me</i>

754
01:04:57,166 --> 01:05:00,750
<i>And the wind might turn into a cyclone</i>

755
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:01,916
Grandma.

756
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,708
<i>There's a big forest</i>

757
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:06,458
MGR won the elections here, right?

758
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,458
Did he come to your house often?

759
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,125
Apparently he used to eat here.

760
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,541
They said he used
to talk to you freely.

761
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:23,375
MGR! Grandma, MGR!

762
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,208
When villains like Nambiar
return, MGR will return as well.

763
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,416
I saw myself in him,

764
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,166
and he saw himself in me.

765
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,916
That's what I told her.

766
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,250
Why would she kill me for that?

767
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:49,708
The mind is the cause for everything.

768
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:55,666
Is the demon's head hanging
from the building next door?

769
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,625
That doll is to ward off the evil eye.

770
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:03,125
No, that's no doll.
It's a demon's head.

771
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:05,000
A demon?

772
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:07,041
In the war between the
Pandavas and Kauravas,

773
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,458
a demon fought bravely for the Kauravas.

774
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,041
Lord Krishna appeared

775
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,541
and asked for his head as a boon.

776
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:22,125
The demon offered it to
Lord Krishna, and said…

777
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:31,416
"I'll give my head but I want
to witness the war till its end."

778
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:37,416
Then, they went to the tallest
mountain and planted his head there.

779
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:41,791
He's still watching the war
in the form of the evil-eye doll.

780
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,125
The war is still going on.

781
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,916
The mind is the
cause for everything.

782
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,583
Hello!

783
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:55,708
Is it Mr. Varuna Sidhar?

784
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:57,000
<i>Live long and prosper.</i>

785
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,291
I saw your number on TV.
Are you Mr. Varuna Sidhar?

786
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,791
<i>Live long and prosper.</i>

787
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:07,791
Sir, I heard you interpret the
significance of lizard falling on humans,

788
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:10,375
crow droppings and
dreams, that's why--

789
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:12,958
Can you come at 4:30 p.m.?

790
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,375
Okay, sir.

791
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,416
Oh, our guardian angel!

792
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,833
Our leader!

793
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,041
Oh, my dearest!

794
01:07:32,541 --> 01:07:36,750
My leader has disappeared!

795
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:49,666
<i>Hold me, hold me!</i>
<i>Hold my body tight, baby</i>

796
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:54,583
<i>Which is the spot</i>
<i>Where you feel most pleasure?</i>

797
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:59,708
<i>Oh, I've found it</i>
<i>I have found it, girl</i>

798
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,208
Live long and prosper!

799
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,250
Live long and prosper!

800
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,250
What are you looking at?

801
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:30,333
Look over here.

802
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,541
What's happening?

803
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:57,500
You're digging your ears, scratching
and, constantly tossing about.

804
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,291
Just say, "Live long and prosper."

805
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,958
All the problems in
the world will come to end.

806
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,041
If I say, "Live long and prosper",
will I stop hearing this symphony?

807
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:09,666
"Om" and symphony are merging!

808
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:12,625
What? Merging?

809
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:13,583
Yeah.

810
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:20,500
Okay, sit.

811
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,625
Come. All your
problems will get solved.

812
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,625
Live long and prosper.

813
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,541
Give me your horoscope.

814
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,458
Sir!

815
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,583
When there's a
tongue sticking out…

816
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,250
isn't that a symbol for suicide?

817
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,666
This demon, and Goddess Kali
always have their tongues sticking out.

818
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,875
Give me your horoscope.

819
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,000
I sneezed even on that day.

820
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:20,583
A thousand legged centipede…

821
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,625
I saw it move.

822
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,458
My mother's tongue was sticking out…

823
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:31,750
and she was hanging on the noose.

824
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:34,291
Oh, was it a dream?

825
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,250
This was no dream. This is real.

826
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,041
Then tell what the dream was.

827
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:43,625
The dream is stuck
somewhere in memory.

828
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,166
Give me your horoscope, please!

829
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:04,500
Sir…

830
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,708
could you please
turn off that sound?

831
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:10,333
What? Turn off the mantra? Get out!

832
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:11,666
Get out!

833
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:13,208
What did you think?

834
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:15,541
That's my mantra!

835
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,000
Get out of here!

836
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,875
Dogshit! Mad dog!

837
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,041
I remember the dream now!

838
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,500
<i>A brown horse was grazing.</i>

839
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:26,791
<i>The horse's legs were white!</i>

840
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:29,291
<i>Like it had socks on with shoes.</i>

841
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:32,291
<i>MGR was petting</i>
<i>it and went behind--</i>

842
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,041
<i>What? MGR?</i>

843
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,958
Why is the horse's tail missing?

844
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:48,458
I'm talking to you.

845
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:52,583
The horse is so
beautiful but it has no tail.

846
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:53,916
Where is the tail?

847
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,750
I lost something in my memory and am
searching for it in dreams.

848
01:11:57,166 --> 01:12:00,125
She randomly said that and
threw a tomato at MGR's face!

849
01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:01,291
Then I woke up.

850
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:05,125
Then I saw that the
horse's tail had grown on me!

851
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,083
See?

852
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,541
There's no tail!

853
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,333
Memory must have
swallowed the dream.

854
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,458
You have to separate
the dream from memory.

855
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:32,416
Sit down.

856
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:39,041
<i>Are you angry?</i>

857
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,458
<i>Why should I get angry?</i>

858
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,208
Watch it.

859
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:49,625
<i>I'm trying but…</i>

860
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,125
<i>But I'm not able to…</i>

861
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:02,666
<i>If you feel a gap in your body's</i>
<i>sensations due to weakness,</i>

862
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,125
{\an8}<i>then Musli-Prash is for you!</i>

863
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,625
{\an8}<i>The complete solution to</i>
<i>all your sexual problems.</i>

864
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,458
{\an8}<i>Well, are you satisfied?</i>

865
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:14,791
{\an8}<i>What a player you are!</i>

866
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:20,541
{\an8}<i>Only if we play Cupid's game</i>
<i>do you accept us as men.</i>

867
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,041
{\an8}<i>Super Musli-Prash.</i>

868
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:24,083
{\an8}<i>Super Musli-Prash.</i>

869
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,666
{\an8}What did you see in this?

870
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:29,208
{\an8}A man and a woman
are trying to have sex.

871
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,916
{\an8}I know that. What else do you see?

872
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,291
{\an8}Next to that,
there's a box of pills.

873
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,041
{\an8}Forget about the box!

874
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,625
Something related to you
is running! What's that?

875
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,458
A horse is running!

876
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:46,125
What is a horse?

877
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,458
I don't know.

878
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:51,708
You don't know what a horse is?

879
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:53,708
The horse is a sex symbol.

880
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,833
Are you talking about that?
I know that!

881
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:58,958
I thought you'd
say something else.

882
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,708
You said MGR came in your dream.

883
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:03,875
MGR represents you.

884
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,791
You mentioned a hybrid horse, right?

885
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:09,291
Hybrid means gene recombination.

886
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:12,458
Gene recombination
means becoming a woman.

887
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:16,375
Hybridization in you means you're
turning into a woman from within.

888
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,625
This means your penis will twist and
fall off. That's what this dream means.

889
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,791
What are you saying, sir?

890
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,458
Will I become a eunuch?

891
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:27,666
Yes, that's why your
wedding is getting delayed!

892
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,375
You're 38 now, right?

893
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:35,250
At this age, you're still not married
because of erectile dysfunction.

894
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,333
You desire every
woman you lay eyes on.

895
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:38,916
But you can't do anything about it.

896
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,375
No. You've got it wrong.

897
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,333
Wrong.

898
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:43,291
Wrong.

899
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:44,333
Wrong.

900
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,833
-Aren't you one?
-No!

901
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,333
No. Wrong!

902
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,416
I'm not wrong. You are that!

903
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,583
You scum!

904
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:02,958
Do you dare to hit me!

905
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,750
Get out.

906
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,916
Out!

907
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,583
You devil! Mongrel!
Give me my money.

908
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,416
Get out!

909
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,166
Get out, you mongrel!

910
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:17,000
Out!

911
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,833
Could "eunuch" signify
a persona without lust?

912
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,541
According to the professor…

913
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:48,833
a forgotten girl…

914
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:05,208
a childhood affair can
only be love without lust.

915
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,166
That bird outside the window
must be flying in that same spot now.

916
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:33,750
I got burnt!

917
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:45,500
That same bird…

918
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,875
it's still flying out there now.

919
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:56,625
<i>God caused him to</i>
<i>die for a hundred years…</i>

920
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,083
<i>then raised him up and asked,</i>

921
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:02,208
<i>"How long have you been here?"</i>

922
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:06,291
{\an8}<i>"A day or part of a day", he replied.</i>

923
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:13,083
{\an8}QURAN 2:261 VIA BORGES
TRANSLATED BY BRAMMARAJAN

924
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,666
<i>Things were different back then.</i>

925
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:35,000
<i>Back then there were</i>
<i>mountains stuck to the village.</i>

926
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,458
<i>The sun would rise from the</i>
<i>mountains and set in the mountains.</i>

927
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:46,666
<i>When the sun rose over the mountains,</i>
<i>the villages got abundant rainfall.</i>

928
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:48,375
<i>The water was free to flow.</i>

929
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,208
<i>But when the man touched</i>
<i>the mountains and the rains stopped.</i>

930
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:57,083
<i>The sun got angry</i>
<i>and ran to the skies.</i>

931
01:17:57,708 --> 01:18:02,500
<i>When it got angry, the ozone got</i>
<i>punctured and the rains stopped.</i>

932
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:37,333
<i>The navel and the spider are one.</i>

933
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:42,750
<i>The spider, perched on its</i>
<i>intricate web, waits for the prey.</i>

934
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,416
<i>And so does the navel.</i>

935
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:49,458
<i>A human's first</i>
<i>creation is the navel.</i>

936
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:54,083
<i>Like the web has convoluted weaves,</i>
<i>the human body has clusters of nerves.</i>

937
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,333
<i>Like the linear weaves on the web</i>
<i>are the bones supporting the body.</i>

938
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:03,125
<i>All that touches the center of the web,</i>

939
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,625
<i>become the spider's prey…</i>

940
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:11,250
<i>much like the food that touches</i>
<i>our body's center, the navel.</i>

941
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:00,416
You came to fetch water,
but left the pot behind, sister!

942
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:04,875
Here you go.

943
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,875
Shameless!

944
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,250
You useless woman!

945
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,416
Who will ever respect me again?

946
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,083
Don't hit my sister, father!

947
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,958
Stop lamenting first
thing in the morning!

948
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:14,916
All this is happening because of you!

949
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,250
She's just standing
there like she's stone deaf!

950
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,000
Can't you speak?

951
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,625
Son, let her go.

952
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:24,958
Let go!

953
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,625
This is not her fault.

954
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,541
All this has already been
written in the manuscripts.

955
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,416
Who are we?

956
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:37,291
A dynasty of soothsayers!

957
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,208
Fool!

958
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:51,166
Even incarnations like Jesus
were conceived through dreams.

959
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,541
Look how arrogant she is!

960
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:57,083
You didn't raise her right!

961
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:59,708
I wonder who she slept with!
She is just like you!

962
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:01,625
Not everyone is like you.

963
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,875
Abandoning the family
to be with the mistress!

964
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:08,125
I'll slap you! That was my past!
Why bring it up now?

965
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:12,583
She's pregnant and apparently
the answer to it is in dreams!

966
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:15,458
-Die, you wretch!
-Don't hurt her, father!

967
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:17,708
Father, please don't hit her!

968
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:22,000
Tell me who you slept with!
I'll get you married to him!

969
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:29,916
You can't figure out
whose child it is, right?

970
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,125
I'm leaving.

971
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:35,333
This is wrong.

972
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,583
I can't be here any longer.
I'm leaving.

973
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:46,333
Where are you going?

974
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:48,833
There's no place for me where a
soothsayer's words aren't heeded.

975
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:51,833
I am leaving.

976
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:54,833
-Where would you go? Please stop!
-I am going.

977
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:03,375
Don't cry. Even I feel like crying.

978
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:06,166
My father has bought candy.

979
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,583
Come, let's go eat it.

980
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:09,250
Die, you bitch!

981
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:25,750
My love, my lord!

982
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:31,583
We can't bear hunger!

983
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:36,375
This crazy woman lives only for you.

984
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:41,458
Why have you left me
alone, and left, my dearest?

985
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:48,458
Even if it pains your heart, I
thought you will forgive your son!

986
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,500
You have abandoned me with no warning!

987
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:55,916
When you spoke, the whole
village was under your spell.

988
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,333
Mother! Come inside and eat.

989
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:04,541
My son has now struck my dearest.

990
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:07,458
He'd be lying somewhere
in the forest. He'll come back.

991
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,125
Stop blabbering and eat.

992
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:12,125
Who do I have left in this world?

993
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,916
Without food or water
you roam the forests.

994
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:18,666
Father, that girl is
eating with her left hand.

995
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:27,583
Father, she's eating
with the wrong hand!

996
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:30,375
What do you care which
hand she eats with?

997
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:43,416
My dearest! My Lord!

998
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,708
Is she awake?

999
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:46,750
Did she eat anything?

1000
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,583
She is giving us the silent treatment.

1001
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:58,125
He'll be fine. You eat.

1002
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,791
Are you going to eat or not, Mother?

1003
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:13,041
It's been 15 days since she came
here, but she doesn't speak to anyone.

1004
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:15,416
Come, let's try speaking to her.

1005
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,041
What's your name?

1006
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:19,458
-Ramu. What about you?
-Neeli!

1007
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:22,250
You're cheating! How long
will you keep the same name?

1008
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:24,333
I kept my favorite name.

1009
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,500
Isn't that what we agreed on?

1010
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:30,458
Neeli fell into the well,
grew wings and flew away!

1011
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:32,291
I want to fly into the sky as well.

1012
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,958
What's your name?

1013
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:36,791
Irusaayi.

1014
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,666
Is that a God's name?

1015
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,041
No, it's the name of a place.

1016
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:52,541
A place? Where is it?

1017
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,041
That's what I'm searching for.

1018
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,583
Where did you lose it?

1019
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:00,333
I lost something in my memory,
and am searching for it in dreams.

1020
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,041
I don't understand, sister.

1021
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,250
I ate with my right hand,
but it looked different to you.

1022
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:10,333
Why are you always
looking at the mountains?

1023
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,041
If we climb the mountains,
we can touch the sky.

1024
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:16,375
If we climb the mountains,
can we touch the sky?

1025
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,000
How's that possible?

1026
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,666
Do you see that mountain over there?

1027
01:27:20,666 --> 01:27:22,083
Isn't the sky stuck to it?

1028
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:23,375
Oh, yes!

1029
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:26,583
Neeli, she's lying!

1030
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,791
She's just bluffing.

1031
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:32,875
I came here to climb the
mountain and touch the sky.

1032
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:36,708
How can you touch the sky?

1033
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:38,583
You can't touch it!

1034
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,000
If you climb that mountain, you can.

1035
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,208
But there's a catch.

1036
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:48,458
When humans try to touch it,
the mountain moves further away.

1037
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:50,666
How can mountains move?

1038
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,333
She's lying!

1039
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:58,583
Why don't you climb the
mountain and try touching the sky?

1040
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,375
Do you see that
beech tree over there?

1041
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,916
The sky is just behind that tree.

1042
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,375
Let's go touch it! It's right here.

1043
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,291
She's been lying all this time!

1044
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:49,041
We sent her to school to study,
but instead she got pregnant.

1045
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:53,333
And now she's had a miscarriage as well.

1046
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,250
So humiliating!

1047
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:00,500
She was with me all day yesterday.

1048
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:04,000
I even comforted her
when she was tossing in her sleep.

1049
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,875
I'm sure she was home the whole time.

1050
01:29:06,291 --> 01:29:08,333
She never left home.

1051
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,500
I don't know how she managed to do it.

1052
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:14,083
I don't know what's happening.

1053
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:15,250
How did this happen?

1054
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:18,833
Did you do it out of fear?

1055
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:23,958
-Tell me!
-Open your mouth! Speak up!

1056
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:32,291
Why is all this happening to me?

1057
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:48,000
The old man's words have come true!

1058
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,041
Everything is already written.

1059
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:54,125
She slept with
someone in her dreams…

1060
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,833
so she delivered the baby
in her dreams!

1061
01:29:58,166 --> 01:30:02,333
Her swollen belly is proof that
she slept with someone in her dreams.

1062
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:06,000
Listen to me.

1063
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:11,541
This is just like a dream
that gets stuck in the memory.

1064
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,500
The old man disappeared somewhere!

1065
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,208
Why don't you get lost as well?

1066
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,166
Weaving stories all the time!

1067
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:24,458
Do you know why this village
is called Yaazhi Mandapam?

1068
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,083
During the Chola rule…

1069
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,625
they made up the creature Yaazhi…

1070
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:34,500
and would battle with it in their dreams.

1071
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:40,083
What do you think of yourself?

1072
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:44,291
We belong to a caste of soothsayers,
who interpret dreams.

1073
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:50,833
It's not right for us to speak like this.

1074
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,750
Have you gone mad, Mother?

1075
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:55,041
This is not the time or place!

1076
01:30:55,958 --> 01:30:57,375
Who will marry her now?

1077
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:31,291
Yes, that girl was telling the truth.

1078
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,458
The mountain is indeed
moving further and further away.

1079
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:43,833
So, we can't touch the mountain?

1080
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:54,041
Father must be looking for us. Let's go.

1081
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,166
Someone's going to get it today.

1082
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:31,458
Child!

1083
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:32,916
Coming, Mom!

1084
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,750
Hey, come here.

1085
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:55,791
Your sister died

1086
01:32:55,875 --> 01:32:58,500
and you weren't even here! You dog!

1087
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,416
Ever since this girl came here,
he's been running around with her.

1088
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:25,083
Where did she go?

1089
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:26,666
Where did she disappear now?

1090
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,875
This is a miracle!

1091
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:32,875
She just disappeared,
like an illusion.

1092
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:18,708
That girl came from a dream.

1093
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:20,708
She vanished as soon as she woke up.

1094
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:23,375
Oh, stop that, Mother!
You'll drive me crazy.

1095
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,833
Everyone's weaving stories.

1096
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:34,416
Ramu, we are going to watch
MGR's film again. Will you come?

1097
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,583
Get lost! As if there isn't
enough to mourn here.

1098
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:39,458
I'll come there and spank you!

1099
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:40,583
Stay away!

1100
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,583
She has spoilt you.

1101
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:45,250
You're always roaming around!

1102
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:48,333
Your sister died and
you were out gallivanting!

1103
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,833
You dog!

1104
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:56,541
Why are you behaving like this?
Why don't you listen to us?

1105
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:05,333
Can you please fetch
water from the well?

1106
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:08,708
Please get it.

1107
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:12,958
I'm going to the Radio tree.

1108
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,875
Fetch me some water, please.

1109
01:35:15,958 --> 01:35:20,041
No, sister loiters as a ghost
near the well. I won't go!

1110
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:23,000
There are no ghosts there.
I'll give you money for sweets.

1111
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,541
Hurry up!

1112
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:27,541
There are ghosts, granny! I won't go.

1113
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,000
I'll take the money though.

1114
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,166
My darling, haven't
I told you the story?

1115
01:35:32,625 --> 01:35:37,083
Those who fall in the well turn
into Neeli, grow wings and fly away?

1116
01:35:37,541 --> 01:35:40,541
-Then how can there be ghosts?
-Oh, yes.

1117
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:43,666
Take your friend and go, child…

1118
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:54,583
Granny!

1119
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:05,291
Neeli?

1120
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:07,625
Neeli?

1121
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:10,000
Neeli?

1122
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:15,208
We saw an MGR film yesterday!

1123
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:34,625
Here!

1124
01:36:40,291 --> 01:36:42,541
Come, let's go to the
well and fetch some water.

1125
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,625
I won't come!

1126
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:47,750
It is said that those who go
there, will vomit blood and die!

1127
01:36:47,833 --> 01:36:50,125
Hasn't your father
told you the story?

1128
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:54,083
Those who fall in the well,
they turn into Neeli and fly away!

1129
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:55,750
Yes!

1130
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:58,458
Isn't that why you call yourself Neeli?

1131
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:00,416
Yes.

1132
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,625
Then let's go!

1133
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,625
Guess how many stones do I have?

1134
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:25,500
Two in this hand, one in the other.

1135
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:27,666
Didn't you see the
ghost near the well?

1136
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,875
Hasn't your father
told you Neeli's story?

1137
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:33,958
Those who fall inside the well turn into
Neeli, grow wings and fly away!

1138
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:38,291
But didn't we see his sister's corpse,

1139
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:41,041
covered in sores where
fish had bitten her?

1140
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:42,541
They're lying.

1141
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:44,041
No, we don't believe you.

1142
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:46,750
His sister grew
wings and flew away!

1143
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:49,541
Why didn't you jump
and fly away then?

1144
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:51,958
We'll jump! We will
grow wings and fly away!

1145
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,375
We're going to jump tomorrow.

1146
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:55,666
If you jump, you'll die!

1147
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:58,541
Tomorrow, you and
I will jump together.

1148
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:01,958
You and I will go over
there and get married.

1149
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:07,166
Don't talk to these guys.

1150
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:10,208
Oh! These two are
going to get married!

1151
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:16,750
To a dog, a bone has
more value than a pearl.

1152
01:38:16,833 --> 01:38:18,125
Neeli, my foot!

1153
01:38:18,208 --> 01:38:20,791
Chinnasami! Ayyadurai!

1154
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:25,458
Our leader is no more! Everyone, come!

1155
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:30,583
What? The "revolutionary leader" is dead!
It can't be true.

1156
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:34,000
What? MGR died?

1157
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:36,500
But I saw him on the
screen only yesterday.

1158
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:45,041
Everyone's going to the
Radio tree. Come, let's go.

1159
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:49,833
<i>The man who was so generous</i>

1160
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:53,333
<i>our revolutionary leader,</i>
<i>MGR passed away</i>

1161
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:58,208
<i>at his residence in Ramavaram</i>
<i>due to cardiac arrest.</i>

1162
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:04,208
<i>His body is kept at his residence for</i>
<i>the public to pay their final respects.</i>

1163
01:39:04,666 --> 01:39:07,416
<i>Tamil Nadu is immersed in grief.</i>

1164
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:10,708
They are lying on the radio!

1165
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,333
We saw him yesterday on the screen.

1166
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:14,541
Don't cry!

1167
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,250
-Old lady! Keep quiet.
-He even sang and danced.

1168
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:21,083
How could he have died?
They're lying on the radio.

1169
01:39:21,958 --> 01:39:23,000
Shut up!

1170
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:26,208
If you say anything more
I'll cut your tongue off!

1171
01:39:26,291 --> 01:39:31,583
Yeah! Even we saw the film yesterday.
How could MGR be dead?

1172
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:34,500
Yeah, even I saw the film yesterday.

1173
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:37,625
MGR was singing and
dancing and fighting on screen.

1174
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:39,250
How could he be dead?

1175
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:46,083
Yeah! Even I saw.
MGR didn't die.

1176
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:49,875
These people are jobless.

1177
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:51,916
They are blabbering some rubbish.

1178
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,583
Oh, leader!

1179
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:57,833
They're believing the lady
on the radio and weeping!

1180
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:05,291
<i>To pay final respects to MGR</i>

1181
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:09,875
<i>Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi,</i>
<i>is coming by chartered flight.</i>

1182
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:14,500
How could MGR have died?

1183
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:17,541
Maybe he fell in our well,
grew wings and flew away?

1184
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:20,458
They've got it all wrong.

1185
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:23,833
Neeli?

1186
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:26,708
Neeli!

1187
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:35,125
Yes, MGR's cap and
glasses are right here!

1188
01:41:35,208 --> 01:41:38,666
See! Even the bullet that was
struck in his throat is now in this glass.

1189
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:42,916
After growing wings and flying, he
must've screamed in happiness

1190
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,500
and this must've been in the
way, so he must've coughed it out!

1191
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:49,000
Yeah!

1192
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Okay, come. Let's go down.

1193
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:05,208
Wait here. I will go ahead. Follow me.

1194
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:18,708
Let's also grow
wings and fly away!

1195
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:22,291
Of course! If we wear
that cap and glasses,

1196
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:25,500
even we'll grow wings,
and fly above the sky!

1197
01:42:25,916 --> 01:42:26,833
Come, let's get it.

1198
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:42,041
Why does it keep
going further away?

1199
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:45,625
Maybe it isn't our time yet,
that's why it's going away.

1200
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:50,958
The sun has gone down.
That's why it won't come.

1201
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:54,583
Let's come back tomorrow
and see if our time has come.

1202
01:42:56,791 --> 01:42:59,083
My father will get worried. Let's go home.

1203
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:02,208
-Will we grow wings tomorrow?
-We'll even fly!

1204
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:11,541
It's getting late. Let's go home.
Father would get worried.

1205
01:44:22,291 --> 01:44:27,666
<i>Oh, tender spring</i>
<i>That shows its face in a wavy mirage</i>

1206
01:44:28,291 --> 01:44:34,500
<i>The mirage that recedes into</i>
<i>The distance with every step</i>

1207
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:45,666
<i>The soul here stands</i>
<i>Taking pain as its shape</i>

1208
01:44:46,458 --> 01:44:52,208
<i>Should the high skies be</i>
<i>Searched for a glimpse of you alive?</i>

1209
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:03,666
<i>To divide the lands, the heart shrinks</i>

1210
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:09,916
<i>I survived, recite the dead people</i>

1211
01:45:13,416 --> 01:45:17,666
<i>The dead people</i>

1212
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:26,458
What's your name today?

1213
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:28,708
-Ramu. Yours?
-Neeli!

1214
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:43,500
You're cheating! How long
will you keep the same name?

1215
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:45,791
I kept my favorite name.

1216
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:48,125
Isn't that what we agreed on?

1217
01:45:50,166 --> 01:45:53,916
Neeli fell into the well,
grew wings and flew away!

1218
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,666
I want to fly into the sky as well.

1219
01:46:00,125 --> 01:46:01,875
No one should mourn this death.

1220
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:03,625
Oh, God!

1221
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:05,791
It was jouissance that caused this death.

1222
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:11,208
She died because she
felt intolerable happiness.

1223
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,750
Her nerves have popped from sheer joy.

1224
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:21,833
This is how saints attain nirvana.

1225
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:26,416
One in a million people
get this good fortune.

1226
01:47:17,541 --> 01:47:19,458
There was a girl in my life as well.

1227
01:47:41,375 --> 01:47:43,750
We were going to fly
away and be happy.

1228
01:47:45,458 --> 01:47:46,416
Yes.

1229
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:01,250
Is all this real or a phantasm?

1230
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:41,791
He said he'll come…

1231
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:43,416
but he still hasn't.

1232
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:46,625
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1233
01:48:59,208 --> 01:49:00,291
Who are you?

1234
01:49:25,833 --> 01:49:27,375
It's me you were waiting for.

1235
01:49:31,333 --> 01:49:33,125
No, you're lying.

1236
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:38,875
He doesn't look like you.

1237
01:49:45,875 --> 01:49:48,166
You're big, like a buffalo!

1238
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,583
He will be here now.

1239
01:49:53,041 --> 01:49:54,833
But your tail is pretty.

1240
01:49:56,583 --> 01:50:00,250
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1241
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:04,041
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1242
01:50:05,541 --> 01:50:08,791
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1243
01:50:08,875 --> 01:50:11,541
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1244
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,583
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1245
01:50:14,666 --> 01:50:17,208
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1246
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:20,125
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1247
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:22,958
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1248
01:50:23,041 --> 01:50:25,791
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1249
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:28,625
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1250
01:50:28,708 --> 01:50:31,625
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1251
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:34,208
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1252
01:50:34,291 --> 01:50:37,208
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1253
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:39,750
Perhaps his father
gave him some work.

1254
01:50:40,083 --> 01:50:42,916
He said he'll come,
but he still hasn't come.

1255
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,791
Her age will not accept me now.

1256
01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:46,750
He said he'll come--

1257
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:21,666
What is it?

1258
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,708
Why have you come
unannounced now?

1259
01:51:42,375 --> 01:51:44,708
You're always acting weird.

1260
01:51:58,125 --> 01:51:59,125
If you have nothing--

1261
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:01,333
Killing someone with syringes

1262
01:52:01,416 --> 01:52:04,000
isn't something a
thug or a thief would do.

1263
01:52:04,416 --> 01:52:05,750
He must have done it himself.

1264
01:52:08,166 --> 01:52:09,416
So, you're saying it's suicide.

1265
01:52:11,541 --> 01:52:13,166
Two hundred
syringes? All by himself?

1266
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:15,333
ATTACK IN AN APARTMENT. OLD MAN LEFT
BLEEDING DUE TO TWO HUNDRED SYRINGES.

1267
01:52:15,416 --> 01:52:17,208
The cop who closed the
case was better than you.

1268
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:19,041
You're a fake detective!

1269
01:52:19,125 --> 01:52:21,416
Sorry. Hear me out.

1270
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:24,375
I didn't mean "him".
I meant the "him within him".

1271
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,708
"Him within him"?

1272
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:30,708
Do you still mean suicide?

1273
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,750
Leave before I throw you out.

1274
01:52:34,833 --> 01:52:37,875
No. It's not just that.
Hear me out completely.

1275
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:40,666
When I say "him" I don't mean him.
I mean his reflection.

1276
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:44,291
You sound like an idiot!

1277
01:52:53,916 --> 01:52:55,125
Get this straight.

1278
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:57,458
By reflection, I don't
mean your husband.

1279
01:53:01,166 --> 01:53:02,750
Are you saying he
killed my husband?

1280
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:05,208
Yes!

1281
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:33,250
How is it stuck in the same place?

1282
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:06,666
The other day, the moon
was moving when I saw it.

1283
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,625
I saw it so clearly!

1284
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:20,000
Do you hear it speak to you?

1285
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:26,000
Can you understand what it says?

1286
01:54:31,333 --> 01:54:36,166
You just said reflection, now
you're saying something else.

1287
01:54:39,208 --> 01:54:40,208
I am correct.

1288
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:42,250
Your husband's name was Babu, right?

1289
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:47,000
What is the connection between
Babu's murder and this man?

1290
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:50,333
I made this connection based on
what he said to you the other day.

1291
01:54:52,708 --> 01:54:54,125
<i>Me. Babu had come.</i>

1292
01:54:55,291 --> 01:54:58,333
<i>He said he could see</i>
<i>me in the name "Babu".</i>

1293
01:54:59,875 --> 01:55:03,208
<i>He kept a conch to my</i>
<i>ear and asked me to listen.</i>

1294
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:06,458
<i>I could hear the waves.</i>

1295
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:10,750
<i>I tried to separate</i>
<i>the words from that noise--</i>

1296
01:55:12,416 --> 01:55:13,291
So?

1297
01:55:14,333 --> 01:55:16,083
How does that make him a murderer?

1298
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:18,833
Are you crazy?

1299
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,833
According to Jacques Lacan's
concept of the mirror stage,

1300
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:28,000
when a child sees
a mirror for the first time,

1301
01:55:28,333 --> 01:55:31,375
its psyche sees its reflection
as someone just like itself,

1302
01:55:31,458 --> 01:55:33,458
but which can survive destruction.

1303
01:55:34,416 --> 01:55:38,291
So when two entities
face each other,

1304
01:55:38,375 --> 01:55:40,416
one will kill the other.

1305
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,041
So, that's my basis.

1306
01:55:43,041 --> 01:55:46,666
He came here as Babu
and left because you cried.

1307
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:50,666
The two of them had referential mania.

1308
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:57,625
That's why they listened
to the conch and felt the same things.

1309
01:56:12,791 --> 01:56:14,625
<i>You don't get to</i>
<i>decide my name! How--</i>

1310
01:56:14,708 --> 01:56:16,125
<i>Loneliness is so cruel.</i>

1311
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:17,375
<i>Have you grown a tail?</i>

1312
01:56:17,458 --> 01:56:20,708
<i>The tail is your subconscious.</i>
<i>If you find out what your tail is--</i>

1313
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:23,541
<i>The mind is the cause for everything.</i>

1314
01:56:23,625 --> 01:56:26,250
With my imagination,
I'm able to stop the moon from moving.

1315
01:56:28,041 --> 01:56:32,875
Similarly, I can construct
my childhood from my thoughts.

1316
01:56:40,541 --> 01:56:44,791
<i>Should I be stick with the dream?</i>

1317
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:50,125
<i>Or should I lose myself in the memories?</i>

1318
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:58,333
<i>To glow with color?</i>

1319
01:57:00,916 --> 01:57:03,625
<i>Glimmer in the dark</i>

1320
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:07,666
<i>Get lost in the mirage</i>

1321
01:57:08,416 --> 01:57:13,083
<i>Or stay in the present?</i>

1322
01:57:14,166 --> 01:57:18,083
<i>And blossom in</i>

1323
01:57:18,166 --> 01:57:22,083
<i>My flawed existence</i>

1324
01:57:45,083 --> 01:57:46,416
You are here!

1325
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:49,583
I was scared that you'd never come.

1326
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:53,750
Father had given me some work.

1327
01:58:22,416 --> 01:58:23,791
Can we pull it now?

1328
01:58:33,916 --> 01:58:35,833
Come, let's try to pull it.

1329
01:58:41,791 --> 01:58:43,125
What's your name today?

1330
01:58:43,208 --> 01:58:44,083
Freud.

1331
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:47,208
Your name?

1332
01:58:47,625 --> 01:58:49,875
My name is always Neeli.

1333
01:58:49,958 --> 01:58:52,041
I am always Neeli.

1334
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:20,500
<i>How I wish to</i>

1335
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:25,916
<i>Liberate my thoughts</i>

1336
01:59:46,958 --> 01:59:51,208
<i>Do I surrender myself to you?</i>

1337
01:59:52,041 --> 01:59:56,291
<i>Or open my wings wide</i>

1338
01:59:57,375 --> 02:00:03,875
<i>To fly like a bird?</i>
