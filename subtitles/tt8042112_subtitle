In a shivering cold, holding our lives...

128
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,640
...with your mom and dad...

129
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
...For the whole night we were hiding
inside a tunnel.

130
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,720
They are interfaith couple.

131
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,080
My body trembles when I think about it...

132
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,520
Some masked men...

133
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,720
...In a flick of second shot them cold blood.

134
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,160
Listen! This human race...

135
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,920
...It's the earth's worst race.

136
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,080
When you die.

137
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,040
A face of someone remains with us.
That's True.

138
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Only for that love...

139
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,640
...we travel, create music, everything...

140
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I have missed someone long back.

141
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,560
Even now, her memories...

142
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,440
...still burning inside me.

143
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,360
Will it not perish after forty years?

144
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,800
You will find someone like that.

145
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,800
God has already created her.

146
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,880
You'll come across her.

147
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,600
Don't miss it.

148

Don't miss it for anything.

149
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,440
You will live like a tree.

150
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,480
You will live like this tree.

151
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,640
Like a tree...

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,200
I feel like laughing and crying same time.

153
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,160
Che...

154
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,280

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,560
It's getting late for Arabic school.

184
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Accompany two of them drop them...

185
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,160
...and then bring them back.
Quick...

186
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,040
'Nagore, Tamil Nadu'

187
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,120
No rations from July
If Aadhar card not linked.

188
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
Aadhar card for cows too.

189
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,240
Indian government wants to
protect each cow.

190
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,240
Ram...Have you got Aadhar card?

191
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,080
I don't even have a residence address.

192
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,160
Hanuman?

193
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,560
- Enrolled...
- Very Good

194
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,280
They have issued Aadhar for Hanuman.

195
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,360
But I am his master...

196
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,480
My land records...

197
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,040
...were denied for past ten months.

198
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,800
Why not a chariot procession to explain this?

199
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,920
Certainly.

200
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Does a cow require an Aadhar id?

201
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
Che...

202
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,760
You can poop in this country
only if you have a Aadhar id.

203
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,120
What would you do?

204
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,400
Shit...

205
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,080
You Anti Indian!

206
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,640
Here is it...Thanks.

207
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,120
Che...I should buy you an adult diaper
from Japan.

208
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,960
You poop everywhere.

209
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
We all live here.

210
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,800
You should hold your horses
You can't poop around.

211
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,520
Aren't you listening?

212
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,360
Awe...It's a Horse...

213
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,720
- Must have came for Dargah Festival.
- Yes it seems.

214
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,760
Gypsy...

215
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,200
Gypsy...

216
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
Welcome...Boot legged Gypsy.

217
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,000
- How long will you stay here?
- Four months

218
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,320
Look at its happiness.

219
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,400
- Didn't we meet last year in Delhi?
- hmm

220
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
You guys were in Delhi
to meet the Prime minister...

221
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,080
- What happen?
- We even protested nude...

222
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,840
...he never showed any interest.

223
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,360
Cancelling your appointments...

224
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
...he scheduled it with Priyanka Chopra.

225
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,200
Next day he flew to Papua New Guinea.

226
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
What?

227
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
That's the name of a country.

228
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,200
He's is on a tour

229
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
Aren't you listening to his radio program?

230
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,440
I end up here losing my land.

231
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,840
Forget it.

232
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,920
Gypsy...where is our senior?

233
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,480
Where is he?

234
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,560
They haven't evacuated it yet.
Inquire them.

235
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,880
Yes sir.

236
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,200
Didn't you people vacate the place?

237
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,280
In spite of our warning
You people are still here.

238
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,680
We will detain everyone...

239
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,480
For what?

240
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,680
To unveil the leader's statue...

241
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,320
...our deputy chief minister is paying visit.

242
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,320
Didn't we ask you clear the platform?

243
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,720
Let them witness this.

244
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
Incredible India!

245
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,120
Without noticing this...

246
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,960
They assume that we are prospering.

247
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,720
A voracious reader of newspaper.

248
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
That's why you orate.

249
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,280
Detain all this land grabbers.

250
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,440
Let God avenge these policemen...

251
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,760
...for having arresting us for no reason.

252
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,520
- Sir...
- What is it?

253
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,160
I thoroughly inquired.

254
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,800
Not even a single one has Aadhar card.

255
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
All unidentified mobs.

256
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,680
That too this Horse lad.

257
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,120
Chances he might be a terrorist.

258
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,800
What?

259
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
They are not interested on our Aadhar cards.

260
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
Do you have ATM cards?

261
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,240
They take bribe through swiping machine.

262
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
Why were you arrested?

263
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,040
Last night I went to watch movie
at a Cinema Hall.

264
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,960
I couldn't stand up
for the National Anthem.

265
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,840
They brought me here,
torturing to pay hundred rupees.

266
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,200
What's wrong is with you guys?

267
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
You don't have any rights to arrest.

268
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,480
Why him?

269
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,200
Regarding National Anthem...

270
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,320
...Supreme Court exempted disabled persons
from standing for National anthem.

271
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,920
Is that so?

272
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,960
Dude...This guy has no idea on
what's happening around.

273
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,800
- Complete nonsense
- I know pretty messed up!

274
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,320
Court instructs the police.
The Police ignores the Courts

275
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,800
None of them listens
to the voices of citizens.

276
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
- Head Constable
- Sir

277
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,000
You are right.

278
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,600
He is for sure a terrorist.

279
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,960
The lord of Nagore...!

280
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
Shut your mouth...

281
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,920
They got rifle to shoot you on your mouth.

282
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,920
Why do you make so much noise?

283
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,080
Thief...

284
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,640
Thief...

285
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,920
- Thief
- Don't laugh

286
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Calm down parrot.

287
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
I will thrash you beggars.

288
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh...my beloved!

289
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,160
Useless tramps.

290
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Bloody hell...
Who cares who unveils whose statue?

291
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,960
Why should we suffer here?

292
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,640
Very very bad.

293
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,360
"Very very bad."

294
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,480
"Bad to the core."

295
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
"Very very bad."

296
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,560
"Bad to the core."

297
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,040
"Khaki Color...
Khaki Color..."

298
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
"Why do you smack us?"

299
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,160
"Khaki Color...

300
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,120
"Why do you strangle us?"

301
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,320
"Opening statues for those of dead."

"Why do you repeatedly kick
the decrepit people like us?"

303
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,320
"Why do you hold kangaroo court
in the police station?"

304
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,520
"Why do you grovel over the bones
thrown by wealthy dogs?"

305
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,600
"Why service the accused those covetous
for power and position?"

306
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,680
"Why do you trample people like us.
Is this democracy?"

307
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,400
"Very very bad"

308
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
"Bad to the Core."

309
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,360
"Very very bad..."

310
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,440

roaming in their cars."

"Even scoundrels big banners
are erected in this town."

316
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
"Do you have the guts
to put them all behind bars?"

317
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
"Then why you trample people like us.
Is this democracy?"

318
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,080
"Very very Bad."

319
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
"Bad to the core..."

320
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,760

345
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,920
Clear them away.

"Very very bad."

347
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,760
Drove them quickly...

348
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,040
Gypsy...Your song went viral.

349
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,280

Stop it.

366
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,880
Do this later.
Muslim Head is arriving.

367
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,760
- Ask him to stop the smoke.
- Take it away

368
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,920
Spread the holy smoke.

369
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,680
Horse is suffering from cold.

370
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,680
Dad is here.

371
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,560
Any disease get cured with this holy smoke.

372
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,760
Stop the smoke,
He might kick you.

373
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,960
Calm down Che...

374
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,280
[Inaudible]

375
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,080
Green Turban. Get lost.

376
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
Poor Muslim head.

377
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,560
You guys will be dead
If our Head-man is not OK.

378
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,840
I said it already that my horse hates smoke.

379
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Why did you do it?

380
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,240
What is he blabbering on?

381
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,680
Uncle...He looks suspicious.

382
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
He already troubled the police men.

383
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,400
Does he have any connection
with other organizations?

384
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,920
Does he have any secret assignments?
Inquire it.

385
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,000
- What's your name?
- Gypsy.

386
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,920
Gypsy...!
Whose is the head?

387
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
Including Che totally five head counts.

388
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,560
He doesn't get any respect.

389
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,880
which religion does your name belong to?

390
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,720
I am human
who is out of religious insanity.

391
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,320
- Knock him down...!
- Wait a minute.

392
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,440
Whom do you worship?

393
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,640
You.

394
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,280
Seems problematic...

395
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,160
Tie him up in the backyard.

396
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,800
Inquire him everything.

397
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,400
- We shall discuss this after the festival.
- Sure

398
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,040
After all these chaos...

399
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,920
...look how he pretends.

400
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,520
I am going to hospital
to inquire Head man's health.

401
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,160
Mommy will arrive shortly.

402
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
Close the door and get inside.

403
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,400
Let's move...

404
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,600
Have an eye on them.

405
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,040
We shall return in the morning.

406
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,400
On return we shall hand over them
to the police.

407
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
Police station...!

408
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,160
Brother...We are feeling thirsty.

409
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,640
- Fajila...Give us some water.
- OK

410
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
Here it is...

411
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
Untie this knot.

412
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,680
For uncle?

413
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,840
Get back in there.
Not a drop to anyone.

414
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,880
Brother...At least for the Horse.

415
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,600
He can't resist thirst.

416
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
- Hello...Where are you?
- Here we are.

417
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,880
Look here...

418
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,120
Follow me...

419
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,200
Imported booze.

420
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,280
I will be around here, give me a call.

421
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,360
Those of who have to sail in the sea
for the big fish.

422
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,920
What shall they bring on return?

423
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,280
Boat full of...

424
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
Empty bottles .

425
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,040
- Water to drink?
- Yes

426
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,640
- Can you make your horse dance?
- If I ask him.

427
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,920
Will it dance now?

428
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,480
Ask him to dance.
We will fetch you water.

429
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,880
Fetch me water, then I will make him dance.

430
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,960
Aroma of beef rice spreads into my nostril.

431
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
Yes...Food and water.

432
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,320
How come with hands tied?

433
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,040
Then untie the knot...

434
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
You will run away.
If we do so...

435
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,840
Promise on Allah...We will not.

436
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,360
- Fajila
- Huh?

437
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,720
This is just the quick release knot.

438
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
- Pull it.
- Sure.

439
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,600
Now we know why you
promised on Allah.

440
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
Make it fast...

441
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,080
We will all be in trouble if dad arrives.

442
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,160
"Floral fragrance in the air.
Fish giggles in the sea everywhere."

443
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,120
"Like a fountain your beauty.
Intrudes in me."

444
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,000
"Unseen gleams are,
Witnessed in your face."

445
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,440
"Why are you inside the dark clouds?
You silver moon!"

446
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,480
"Show me..."

447
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,080
"...the path..."

448
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,320
"Redefine..."

449
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,160
"Redefine the music
on earth."

450
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,400
"Your eye lids.
Turns as Wings"

451
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,640
"Why can't I grab you?
My golden moon..."

452
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,000
"In the streets of milky Way.
Your face dipped in nectar."

453
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,800
"Looking at you.
Won't time freeze?"

454
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,880
"Do not conceal your light.
Don't veil yourself crescent moon."

455
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,000
"Like a crawling sea wave.
Will you embrace me, My beloved?"

456
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,960
"Like you who shall accompany me?
Till my last breath."

457
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,480
"I am a gypsy.
You accepting the same..."

458
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,280
"Show me..."

459
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,200
"...Show me the path."

460
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,960
"Redefine..."

461
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,840
"Redefine the music
on earth..."

462
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,160
"Yours eye lids
Turns as wings"

463
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,520
"Why can't I grab you?
My Golden Moon..."

464
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,760
"Learning bird's language.
We shall become as a forest."

465
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,160

Music fills the nest."

00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,480
"Without address, Without names..."

472
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,480
"We shall travel without footprints."

473
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,720
"Show me..."

474
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,400
"...Show me the path."

475
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,320
"Redefine..."

476
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,120
"Redefine the music on earth."

477
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,720
"Yours eye lids
Turns as wings."

478
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,240
"Why can't I grab you?
My golden moon."

479
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,680
Waheedha...Get inside.

480
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,040
Fajila...Your dad is on his way.
Go tie them.

481
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,680
Sit down.
Trouble if dad arrives.

482
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,760
Sit down.

483
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,640
Sit down.
Trouble if dad arrives.

484
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,400
- We are done if dad knows this.
- Alright.

485
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,720
Sit down.

486
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
Make it fast.

487
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,680
Head man is safe...

488
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,960
...else you guys will be in trouble.

489
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,160
I have inquired.

490
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,360
He is just a homeless guy.

491
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,360
God's willing.

492
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,840
At least train your horse.

493
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,920
Che...Are you satisfied now?

494
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,840
Buraq a horse who has taken prophet Nabi
to Paradise.

495
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Excuse Che by remembering Buraq.

496
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,760
Uncle. He will not stop his lectures.

497
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,760
- Send him away.
- Send them away these evils.

498
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,680
Go away...
I don't want to see you again.

499
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,400
- Teach your horse some manner.
- He will salute you with legs.

500
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,640
- Never take horse booking from mosque.
- Sure

501
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,280
Brother...Prepare tea for us

502
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,320
One of his anklet is missing...

503
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,640
Che...
Where's the anklet dude?

504
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,640
- Will they offer charity food at Dargah?
- Sure

505
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,240
- Find a leg piece?
- Just a sec.

506
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,480
Hello...

507
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,720
Did you see any anklet
at the backyard of your house?

508
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,560
One of Che's anklet is missing.

509
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
- Hello
- Let's go

510
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,360
Gypsy...Have you gone nuts?

511
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,520
You're not allowed to talk
with them in public.

512
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,440
Gypsy...Are you crazy?

513
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,440
At dawn you dress up like Lord Ram.

514
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,360
At dusk you line up before beef stall.

515
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,240
Ask him.

516
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,120
If they notice this...

517
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,160
You'll be laid under for a chariot procession.

518
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,960
You make me nervous every day.

519
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,640
- Where is the horse man?
- You mean Gypsy?

520
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,560
Who knows his whereabouts?

521
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
This is festive season.

522
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,920
He must have gone town to town.

523
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
Why is your sister standing there?

524
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,760
Sister...Any bookings for the horse?

525
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,120
He is not here.

526
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,960
Sister...It's not our dad.

527
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,160

528
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,120
Hello.

529
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,840
Hello...

530
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Who is this?

531
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Who are you?

532
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,760
Isn't is you who called?

533
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Isn't it you who woke me up?

534
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,400
Who are you?

535
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,520
Gypsy. The Horse man.

536
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,360
Yourself?

537
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,760
Fancy store owner.

538
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,760
Isn't your horse kicked our Muslim head?

539
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,440
Why are you troubling me?

540
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,600
Is this revenge by disturbing my nap?

541
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,480
You are the one who called?

542
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,400
Those who believe in resurrection...

543
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,520
...will never bear malice
in their mind, says Qur'an.

544
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,040
I am follower of Qur'an.

545
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,080
Nonsense.

546
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
Waheedha...

547
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,960
Dad.

548
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,600
Switch off this nuisance
and put it on charger.

549
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
Hosanna...Victory.

550
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,760
Hosanna...Victory is ours.

551
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,760
Ticket.

552
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,360
Tender change for ticket.

553
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,280
Do not stand in the doorway.

554
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,040
Fajila...We got to go.

555
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,480
We don't stop here...

556
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,800
...next stopping at hospital.

557
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,160
What's wrong?

558
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,760
- Where are you taking me?
- Just follow me...

559
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,840
Here it is.
Our dancing horse.

560
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,000
Yes, it is.

561
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,400
Sister.
There he is.

562
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,880
Let's move.

563
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,280
Bye.

564
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,400
- What's wrong.
- He's got his anklet back.

565
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,600
Yes.

566
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,680
How come?

567
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,440
- Who did this?
- I have no idea.

568
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,240
Lord said, "I will let you to witness wonders".

569
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,880
Is that it?

570
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,160
Oh Lord...

571
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,280
...signs are there for your return.

572
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,600
Amen...!

573
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,280
Let's move on.

574
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Hello.

575
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,080
- He is walking into a female store.
- Is his horse a mare?

576
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,320
[Humming]

577
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,280
- You song is very soothing.
- Thank you.

578
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,600
- Ask him?
- What do you like to buy?

579
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,480
Need a silk cloth...

580
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,440
Bangalore make with roses.

581
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,560
- Ask him...What color?
- Color?

582
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,080
Che is white and red would make
a good combo.

583
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,480
Red would be fine.

584
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,360
Old one was torn at your place.

585
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,040
I'll get it.
Look out for his horse.

586
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,320
OK

587
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,040
Yes. His horse is here.

588
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,880
- Look out for the anklets.
- Sure.

589
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,160
This one.

590
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,080
Yes...Anklet is there.

591
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,240
- Good...You carry on.
- OK Sister

592
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,800
Look at your father-in-law.

593
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,360
She will pop out now.

594
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,160
Why are you here?

595
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,560
I asked only her to come?

596
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,680
She was alone.

597
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,320
What do you care about?

598
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,000
Go back home.
Now.

599
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,840
I will take care...
Clear off.

600
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
It's three hundred.

601
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,760
Sir...Receipt?

602
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,280
Bye.

603
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,880
Thank you.

604
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,720
Che...
Let's move.

605
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,120
Why has it lifted up its legs suddenly?

606
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,600
'Gypsy.'

607
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,320
'You will find someone.'

608
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,640
'God has already created her.'

609
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,280
'You'll come across her.'

610
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
'When you die...'

611
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,360
'...Only one face of someone
remains in your memory...'

612
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,280
'That's True.'

613
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,360
'Only for that love...'

614
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,120
'...we travel, create music, everything...'

615
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,800
'Don't miss it.

616
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,200
'Don't miss it for anything.'

617
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,880
It's our horse uncle.

618
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,320
- Is he still following us ?
- Yes, he is...

619
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,280
- Excuse me
- Don't talk back

620
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Hello.

621
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,880
Excuse me.

622
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,840
Wait a minute.

623
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,000
I want to say something to you.

624
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,600
Thank you very much for...

625
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
...returning Che's anklet.

626
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,800
Thank you for that.

627
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,040
I didn't say this...

628
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,680
Che himself asked to thank you.

629
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,440
You speak Urdu?

630
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,440
Little girl...
Love has no language.

631
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,080
Get inside.

632
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,160
I also thank you for returning it.

633
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,720
Waheedha...

634
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,320
What's going on?

635
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,360
Come here

636
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,640
May the peace, mercy, and
blessings of Allah be with you.

637
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,680
In the name of God, most gracious,
most compassionate.

638
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,680
It's an engagement agreement.

639
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,120
[Reading the Agreement...]

640
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,960
'Turkey hens are bought here alive'

641
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,560
Welcome Uncle.

642
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,960
- What is it?
- Where is your mother?

643
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,200
She is too old now.

644
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,880
She is not active like before.

645
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,880
She will be alright.
If Waheedha is married into.

646
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,320
Marriage hall is booked in advance.

647
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,560
I arranged chef for the banquet.

648
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,480
Yet to invite my relatives in Calicut.

649
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,640
That's the only thing left.

650
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,960
Let me know.
If I had missed out anything.

651
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,320
Things are fine with me.

652
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Horse for the bride procession.

653
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,480
Can I arrange this myself?

654
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,360
I will take care of it.

655
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,480
For wedding purchase...

656
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,160
...Can I send Waheedha with your mother.

657
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,160
You want to join them?

658
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,320
Its alright.
Let them go.

659
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,760
I've got other things to do.

660
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,760
Then I'll leave now...

661
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,280
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

662
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,040
- I saw a big fish.
- What type of fish.

663
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,800
Here comes fancy store girl.

664
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,000
Welcome.

665
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,840
What's the matter?

666
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,800
Came to visit Che?

667
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,800
Look Che who has come to visit you?

668
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,000
He greets you.

669
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,560
Come in...

670
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,600
Sorry.
I got to go.

671
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,280
Come on.
You don't want to see my place?

672
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,040
Look after Che...

673
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,680
This is our hang out place.

674
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,880
This is farmer.

675
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,880
Beloved farmer?

676
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,480
Gypsy.

677
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,200
- This is Waheedha.
- Hello.

678
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,720
This way.

679
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,200
Out of many...

680
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,640
...this palace is among.

681
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,280
Everything is handmade crafts.

682
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,840
Here it is.

683
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,880
Bible. My foreigner friend...

684
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,320
...Samuel gave it to me.

685
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,360
This Holy Quran.

686
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,560
In Ajmer a Muslim saint gave it to me.

687
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,240
This Bhagvat Gita,

688
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,360
In Haridvar a Hindu pilgrim gave it to me.

689
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,480
All holy books preach the same.

690
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,400
Only the name and covers are different.

691
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,280
That's Me and Senior.

692
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,960
Have you been to Tajmahal?

693
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,200
I have got a house near Tajmahal.

694
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,120
Is that so?

695
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,800
I have also got house near parliament.

696
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,560
Qutub Minar, Charminar, Mysore maharaja palace...

697
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,880
...Tanjore Big temple,
I got houses everywhere.

698
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,960
I found it in the streets of Kashmir.

699
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,840
I felt something personal...

700
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,480
...it's been with me for many years.

701
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,880
Do you want this?

702
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,280
Take it.

703
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,600
Take this with you.

704
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,880
Fancy store owner is here
to meet you.

705
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,280
Stay right here.

706
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,320
- May Peace be upon you.
- Peace

707
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,840
Is the horse of yours still continues
the habit of kicking?

708
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,960
Not anymore.

709
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,840
What is it?

710
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,400
It's about my daughter's marriage.

711
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,440
It's on the third of this month.

712
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
- Come early as possible.
- Sure.

713
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,520
We need your horse for
the bride's procession.

714
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,320
I'll bring him.

715
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,160
Be careful with your horse this time.

716
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,200
- Got it.
- Yes.

717
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,160
- I will be there.
- Show up without fail.

718
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,320
We got a lot of work.
Note down the date...

719
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,120
Good news.
I will not forget it.

720
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,880
Alright. I'll wait.

721
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,280
Let's move before they look for you.

722
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,400
- Still awake?
- Dad.

723
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,680
Go get some sleep.

724
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,600
Peace.

725
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,200
That can't be predicted.

726
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,680
Hameed...
Have you given the headcounts for the feast?

727
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,440
- One thousand. Informed.
- OK

728
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,320
I am visiting the marriage hall.

729
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,000
- Take care of the house.
- Oh yes.

730
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,440
Ram. Find the best spot.

731
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,160
Buddy What a shot...!

732
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,320
Smashed it.

733
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,880
Gypsy. Take your seat.

734
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,920
It's a marvelous shot.

735
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,480
Knock it out.

736
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,680
Just he has told
Now he is out

737
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,560
Who is that?

738
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,040
Why are you cheering for Pakistan?

739
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,840
Ok...I am leaving...

740
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,720
Where?

741
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,160
To Fancy store owner's house...

742
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,600
...to tie up our Che.

743
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,320
Makes our job easier in the morning.

744
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,680
Excuse me...

745
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,840
Why are you crying?

746
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,520
Don't worry you're on a winning side.

747
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,680
Easy target to chase.

748
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,800
Your team's batting lineup is very strong.

749
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,800
Which team?

750
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,040
It is not Pakistan?

751
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,160
Who said?

752
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,280
We support Indian team.

753
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,680
This is our country.

754
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,480
Are you fools?

755
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,560
I consider both teams the same.

756
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,280
Wickets or sixes.
I enjoy the game of the cricket.

757
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,800
I am resting the horse here.

758
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,040
Look after him.

759
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,640
He is here for your marriage.

760
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,240
I will be back in the morning.

761
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,400
Wait a minute.

762
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,520
What is it?

763
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,680
Will you do me favor?

764
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,080
Sure. Why not?

765
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,680
Will you give me a ride on your horse?

766
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,000
Now?

767
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,720
Yes.

768
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,720
Please come.

769
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,400
One minute.

770
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,480
Please come.

771
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,040
Take care of your legs.

772
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,240
Careful Che.

773
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,680
One small ride before the epic night.

774
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,600
- Watch it...
- Careful.

775
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,920
Hold it tight.

776
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Waheedha...

777
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,400
Shall we go back?

778
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,200
Little further.

779
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,440
Waheedha...

780
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,600
Where is she?

781
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,120
She was in the other room.

782
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,920
- Hameed get up...
- What's wrong?

783
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,560
Saira...Wake up.

784
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,040
What happened?

785
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,720
Shall we go back?

786
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,000
Little further more.

787
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,240
Waheedha...?

788
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,120
Put on the lights.

789
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,040
Waheee...

790
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,520
Oh My God...!

791
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,760
Shall we go back?

792
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,640
Take me far away from here...

793
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,360
"I oscillate like a magical swing."

794
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,640
"With your love."

795
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,960
"Like rain pours from clouds."

796
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,560
"Your love drizzles over my soul."

797
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:37,120
"Without witnessing summer and winter
Like a Tree."

798
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,880
"With your presence.
Sprouts sky high."

799
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,840
"As I lay down on to your shoulders..."

800
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,080
"...stars sprinkles golden flowers."

801
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,920
"When we stretch our feathers in air."

802
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,120
"The earth becomes a dot."

803
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,920
"If we fill this earth with love."

804
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,320
"This will surpass God's act."

805
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,880
"Like a magical swing."

806
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,560
"I oscillate with your love."

807
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,120
"Like rain pours from clouds."

808
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,560
"Your love drizzles over my soul."

809
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,920
"Kisses even in summer."

810
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,400
"Hugs even in sweat."

811
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,000
"Before your foot prints."

812
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,520
"Is where I see my home land."

813
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:14,040
"Like a fish in the fountain.
You fathom my soul."

814
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,800
"Like rain embracing mud.
We became inseparable."

815
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,720
"When we stretch our feathers in air."

816
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,000
"The earth becomes a dot."

817
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,720
"If we fill this earth with love."

818
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,120
"This will surpass God's act."

819
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,800
"Like a magical swing."

820
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,080
"I oscillate with your love."

821
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,160
"Like rain pours from clouds."

822
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,640
"Your love drizzles over my soul."

823
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,000
Will you marry me?

824
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,680
We are like the married.

825
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,840
What shall I do?

826
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,080
Marry me according my tradition.

827
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:27,160
Therefore my dad will
never separate us.

828
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,200
- May peace be upon you.
- Peace

829
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,680
This is my friend Gypsy and his fiancée.

- They want to get married.
- Glory be to Allah.

831
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,440

834
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,560
- I accept this marriage.
- I accept this marriage.

835
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,280
This is Bant Singh.
A revolutionary singer.

836
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,960
"Tree creates music with bird."

837
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,080
"Even budding seed makes sound."

838
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,680
"Sea waves are music"

839
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,320
"Our whole body makes music."

840
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,480
"In the forest filled moon light."

841
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,800
"Birds sing their motherhood
with harp."

842
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,120
"Even the breathe of birds feathers..."

843
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,640
"...Blows thousand flutes."

844
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,000
"Honey droplets in each of your words."

845
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,320
"The air smells like nectar around me."

846
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,480
"Isn't it from you...?"

847
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,040
"When we stretch our hands in air"

848
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,560
"The earth becomes a dot."

849
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,320
"If this world is filled with love."

850
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,600
"This will surpass God's act."

851
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,160
"Like a magical swing."

852
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,920
"I oscillate with your love."

853
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,720
"Like rain pours from clouds."

854
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,000
"Your love drizzles over my soul."

855
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,680
- Gypsy...I want to say something.
- Go on.

856
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,400
Only for few months.

857
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,920
Delivery date is nearing.

858
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,360
Due date in two months.

859
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,960
Doctors insisted us to avoid traveling.

860
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,720
Let's stay here at least for five months.

861
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,360
We need to rent a house.

862
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,440
We have two vacant houses here.

863
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,720
We shall inquire.

864
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,080
It's a no entry zone.

865
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,000
It's a familiar spot.

866
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,520
We will find our house here.

867
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,400
Election is round the corner...

868
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,800
...5000 rupees for a vote. Isn't it?

869
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,000
Nobody should to stick bills...

870
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,440
Sabnam,Our House owner.

871
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,200
Come in.

872
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,720
You should abide my rules.

873
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,960
- Do you like this house?
- OK.

874
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,240
Come in.

875
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,000
Come aside. Sit here.

876
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,320
Che.
This is my new chapter of life.

877
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,880
Get use to it.

878
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,320
We shall find a mare for you.

879
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,280
- He got offended.
- Che...Want something to eat?

880
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,760
My sweet cutie pie.

881
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,080
He is angry.

882
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,280
How does our baby look?

883
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,600
Like you or me?

884
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,000
Like you.

885
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,080
This is the face that I like the most.

886
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,440
Like your Eyes, Nose, Lips

887
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,720
My child will be exactly like this.

888
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,720
Gypsy.

889
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,120
Coming...

890
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,520
Its election time.

891
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,600
Our horse will be on demand.

892
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,640
Gypsy...Hurry up.

893
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,600
I'll be back soon.

894
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,720
I'll be right back soon.

895
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,280
- Party leader has arrived already.
- I'm ready.

896
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,560
Come on Che.

897
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,920
"This is a great nation."

898
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,160
"Tricolor flag is our pride."

899
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,120
"It's a identity for...
The citizen of this nation."

900
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,720
"Let's demolish the fortified barrier of
numerous caste and creed."

901
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,080
"We will rewrite the history
by abolishing the curse of untouchability."

902
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,520
"Come all brothers
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christians."

903
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,120
News channels take sides on opinion polls.

904
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,480
They opinion polls are confusing us.

905
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,240
Whoever wins the election.
It is voters who are losers.

906
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,440
"With our pure souls.
And the truth on our lips."

907
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,360
Brother. I need half kg of beef.

908
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,520
We have conquered.
The heart of even our enemies.

909
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,960
Whose horse it is?

910
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,040
Stop the horse.

1096
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,440
The one who got exposed in media...

1097
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,840
...their party's cadre.

1098
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,280
He is in our custody now.

1099
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,200
Lock him up and leave now.

1100
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,240
Anyways they will bail me out tomorrow.

1101
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,240
Until then take care of us.

1102
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,680
- Get us dinner from Gupta restaurant.
- Shut up.

1103
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,440
Don't forget to buy smokes.

1104
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,640
Are we getting biriyani?

1105
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:18,360
Victory to our leader.

1106
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,040
Victory to our leader.

1107
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,120
Come on...Get blessings.

1108
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,640
These are our soldiers.

1109
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,240
They will even die for us.

1110
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,520
We are responsible
to safeguard our country.

1111
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,160
From now you will have an upper hand.

1112
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,120
Praise the one and only God.

1113
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,760
Wahee...

1114
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,360
Waheedha.

1115
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,520
'One year later'

1116
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,520
We are Right to know the truth
organization.

1117
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,720
Only after collecting the evidence
about this riot...

1118
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,400
...we are here to help you.

1119
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,600
Listen carefully.

1120
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,280
You'll be produced before the judge...

1121
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,080
They'll ask if about police conduct.

1122
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,280
Nobody will speak against us.

1123
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,880
Did you all understand?

1124
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,760
Nobody will speak up.

1125
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,240
Those who speak against us...

1126
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,800
...will be linked with bomb blast case.

1127
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,840
All get into the vehicle leaving
your thumb impression.

1128
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,840
Go straight.

1129
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,000
Get in.
Now.

1130
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,840
- Lets start.
- Go straight.

1131
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,520
Hurry up.

1132
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,840
Were you all beaten in police custody?

1133
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,720
Don't be scared.
Speak out.

1134
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,800
- Experienced any custodial violence?
- No

1135
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,000
Look at those scars.

1136
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,520
Silence.

1137
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,040
Provisional detention of these accused...

1138
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,160
...without judicial trail for past one year.

1139
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,960
...considered to be unlawful.

1140
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,640
Custodial torture on defenseless citizen
violates fundamental rights.

1141
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:01,160
Only because of Right to know the Truth

1142
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,880
...and its member has brought this case
to court's notice.

1143
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,320
This act of brutality by the police
saddens me.

1144
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,560
This court strongly condemns the officials
for the abuse of power.

1145
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,840
Court acquits all the detainees
at once.

1146
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,160
and orders to provide
sufficient medical assistance for them.

1147
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,520
"My Heart melts.
Oh lord Muruga!"

1148
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,720
"When I behold your feet."

1149
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:03,720
"My Heart melts.
Oh lord Muruga!"

1150
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:08,200
"When I behold your feet."

1151
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,720
"When I grab and embrace you."

1152
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,640
"When I grab and embrace you."

1153
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,560
"When I grab and embrace you."

1154
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:27,320
"Oh Lord Muruga...!
Joy abounds in me."

1155
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:33,440
"Oh Lord Muruga...!
My Heart melts."

1156
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,960
Waheedha go away...

1157
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,440
I have not seen her
ever since then.

1158
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,400
"Singing with excitement about you."

1159
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,520
Our entire livelihood was burnt
in that riot.

1160
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,040
If we are forced out of the country
then...

1161
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,440
...they'll feel much relieved.

1162
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,160
"Singing with excitement about you."

1163
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,200
"Makes us to long for your appearance."

1164
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,480
"Riding the dancing peacock..."

1165
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,960
"Riding the dancing peacock..."

1166
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:35,240
"My desire grows large..."

1167
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,040
"My Heart melts.
Oh Lord Muruga..."

1168
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,280
"When I behold your feet."

1169
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:51,280
"My Heart melts.
Oh Lord Muruga..."

1170
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,880
"When I behold your feet."

1171
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,400
No one knew your whereabouts.

1172
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,880
With this photograph.
I went on to search your wife.

1173
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
She lives with her father
in Calicut.

1174
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,960
We went there and,
we couldn't speak to her.

1175
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,400
Her Father stopped us.

1176
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,680
About Waheedha...

1177
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,840
...and including other victims...

1178
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,760
...I thought of organizing
a concert called Where is God.

1179
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,720
But, government authorities
stopped me.

1180
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,160
It's a big surprise in meeting you again.

1181
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,680
You're wife will be even more pleased
in meeting you.

1182
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,080
You should go right away meet her.

1183
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,200
That shall bring her back alive.

1184
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:56,840
'Kozhikode, Kerala'

1185
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,760
Way to Muthalippu house.

1186
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,640
- Go straight and turn left.
- Thanks.

1187
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,240
Wahee...

1188
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,400
I am home.

1189
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,040
Honey...

1190
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,240
Waheedha...

1191
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,360
Ma...!

1192
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,400
Why do you come?

1193
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,680
You come here to disturb her peace?

1194
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,440
Where here after being shamed in Nagore.

1195
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,760
Why did you come here?

1196
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,000
Do you want to drive us away
elsewhere?

1197
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,160
They killed my horse in the riot.

1198
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,440
I was jailed.

1199
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,160
Waheedha...I'm alive only through
your memories.

1200
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,840
I knew I can get you back.

1201
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,600
This Our baby.

1202
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,040
Come lets go...

1203
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,560
Don't you touch her?

1204
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,720
She is half dead because of you.

1205
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,120
She is done with you.

1206
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,320
God has given my daughter back.

1207
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:55,320
It's the forgiveness of the Nagore saint.

1208
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,600
It's a sin for her to see you again.

1209
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,120
Get lost...Get lost.

1210
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,840
Get away from here.

1211
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,400
Let me talk to her.

1212
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,840
Waheedha.

1213
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,040
Waheedha come with me.

1214
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,120
He ruined my daughter's life.

1215
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,760
Now he is trying to kill her.

1216
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,760
- Please calm down.
- Don't

1217
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,360
I'm going to call the cops.

1218
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,120
Scoundrel...I thought he was dead.

1219
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,360
Get out.

1220
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,920
- Police station...
- Yes.

1221
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,440
Long live the revolution...!

1222
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:46,240
Long live the revolution...!

1223
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,040
Gypsy.

1224
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,720
When did you come?

1225
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,440
You look lifeless.

1226
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,040
Where is your horse?

1227
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,880
Let's go inside.

1228
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,960
Long live the revolution...!

1229
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,240
Long live the revolution...!

1230
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,920
We held several meetings
condemning the riots.

1231
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,360
I didn't know you were also a victim in it.

1232
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,840
They destroy people polarizing them
by their caste and religion.

1233
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,640
Throughout the country...

1234
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,480
...prisons are filled by detaining innocents.

1235
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,440
Your wife...

1236
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:40,400
After the riots this photo was circulated
in every magazine.

1237
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,120
This man whose is raising sword...

1238
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,440
...also circulated along...

1239
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,720
Face of the victim.

1240
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,960
Face of the violence.

1241
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,160
These two photos were projected
as the faces of the riot.

1242
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,920
They remembered this riot...

1243
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,320
...Only through your wife's photograph.

1244
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,360
I came to know that
she lives in this locality.

1245
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,520
We tried to organize a meeting
with the victim.

1246
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,720
It didn't happen.

1247
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,240
But her father denied.

1248
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,920
Didn't let her out.

1249
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,200
He refused to talk to media.

1250
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,840
Her father is a fundamentalist.

1251
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,960
Look at her eyes...

1252
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,920
I think.

1253
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,600
She is yet recover from the tremors
of violence.

1254
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,040
It needs time to heal.

1255
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,560
Her father takes advantage
out of it.

1256
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,200
Don't worry.
This is our place.

1257
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,200
I will try to convince her father.

1258
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,560
When you leave you this place.

1259
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,000
You'll be accompanied by
your wife and daughter.

1260
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,360
Got it.

1261
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,400
- Biju...
- Coming.

1262
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,080
- Can't I tune this peacefully?
- Shut up.

1263
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,760
You must be knowing him?

1264
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,120
Gypsy...The best singer.
I have ever witnessed.

1265
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:56,240
It's not that simple
to meet such talents.

1266
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,320
Make arrangements for his stay here.

1267
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,160
"The palm wine we drank yesterday."

1268
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,240
"Is what makes me sing now."

1269
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,360
"Five bottles of wine with six eggs."

1270
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,600
"We drank it in one sitting."

1271
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:17,760
"When my dude came by the river."

1272
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,240
"We partied together."

1273
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,840
This is my bed.

1274
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,000
Out of generosity.
I'm giving it to you.

1275
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,480
Balan said you're a popular singer.

1276
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,760
I doubt it.

1277
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,320
If dare to open your mouth
in this place.

1278
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,160
I will break your teeth.

1279
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:35,760
Understood.

1280
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,960
Don't dare to touch my guitar.

1281
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,560
This is not just another
instrument.

1282
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,160
Worth it more than
my wife.

1283
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,680
I warn you...

1284
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,120
"When my dude
burst into tears."

1285
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,960
"Oh! Girl.
My heart broke into pieces."

1286
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,040
"The palm wine we drank yesterday..."

1287
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,160
"...Is what makes me sing."

1288
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,320
"Five bottles of wine with six eggs."

1289
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,600
"We drank it in one sitting."

1290
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,640
Who are you?

1291
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,600
Where are you from?

1292
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,040
Do you have any identity?

1293
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,560
I was told that my parents were killed
by a Muslim.

1294
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,120
My horse was killed,
My wife was separated...

1295
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,400
...by a Hindu.

1296
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,480
- This is all that I remember.
- Listen.

1297
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,080
We are Urdu Muslims.

1298
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:22,520
We offer prayer five times a day.

1299
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,280
If a women don't abide
by the religion.

1300
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,040
She must pay heavy price for it.
We have suffered enough.

1301
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,400
He left her in the streets.

1302
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,800
Why do you dwell in the past?

1303
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,520
Gypsy is the husband of your daughter.

1304
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,760
This marriage was performed according
to Muslim law.

1305
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,120
Sir...This is not your party office.

1306
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,560
He was married to my daughter
and they have a child.

1307
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,160
And I will not offend the Muslim law

1308
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,240
So according to Muslim law.

1309
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,560
My daughter needs a divorce agreement.

1310
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,200
Prophet should arrange this.

1311
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,040
Failing to see his wife over a period
of one year.

1312
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,400
And if have not provided
for her maintenance.

1313
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,280
Then this woman can dissolute
her marriage.

1314
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,560
It's in the rule book.

1315
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,320
One month from now...

1316
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,560
...we will meet again in this court.

1317
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:02,840
To pronounce khula
to this dissolute marriage.

1318
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,440
Then you don't have rights
to trespass my house.

1319
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,720
Is that clear?
Our decision is made.

1320
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,480
- Whose decision is this?
- My decision.

1321
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,520
Who else then?

1322
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,800
I need my wife's consent.

1323
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,760
A woman cannot overturn a man's decision.

1324
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,480
My daughter hates you.

1325
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,680
Let my wife to say this to me.

1326
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,560
Muthalippu...Bring your daughter.

1327
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:25,760
Stay here.

1328
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,800
My daughter is here.

1329
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,280
Your decision for this divorce agreement.
Speak out.

1330
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,760
Child...Do you agree to this?

1331
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,760
Say it.
What's your decision?

1332
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,040
Waheedha.

1333
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,320
Four weeks from now.

1334
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,520
We will meet again
to end this settlement.

1335
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,160
I will pronounce talaq myself.

1336
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,880
'The most hated of
the lawful things to God...'

1337
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,720
'...is talaq (Divorce)' , says Quran.

1338
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:51,920
The most hated word by God...

1339
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,480
...is now being offered
to my beloved wife.

1340
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,200
Prophet said, 'Separation of two hearts...'

1341
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:59,560
'...shakes the very throne of God'.

1342
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,240
With these conflicts...

1343
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,440
...you may belittle your own God.

1344
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,800
He has agreed to pronounce talaq.

1345
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,920
Give him the period of waiting.
(i.e) 3 months.

1346
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:10,040
You have asked for khula
behalf of your daughter.

1347
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,120
We want to consider his concerns too.

1348
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,600
If a women pronounces khula once.
their relationship will cease forthwith.

1349
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,040
However for men to pronounce talaq thrice,
there is a waiting period.

1350
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,280
Hence we should address
his concerns too.

1351
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,960
This council will meet again next Friday
for the first talaq.

1352
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,240
This is our resolution.

1353
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:45,640
"Little smile of you."

1354
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:51,400
"Sketches your face in me."

1355
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:56,920
"Wheel of my life."

1356
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:02,080
"Revolves around you."

1357
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,680
"Like the flesh and bone."

1358
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,440
"Like the ceaseless waves."

1359
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,040
"Like a mother to daughter."

1360
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:13,240
"Come back to me."

1361
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,960
"An irreplaceable relationship."

1362
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,720
"An undying music."

1363
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,640
"An inseparable daughter."

1364
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,680
"Come back to me."

1365
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,760
"Before the sky dawns."

1366
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,880
"Come back.
My little girl."

1367
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,800
April 27 riots is an unforgettable event.

1368
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:45,120
Waheedha's photo became the face of the violence.

1369
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,800
April 27 riot shocked the whole country.

1370
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,000
Waheedha became a photographic evident
in this riot.

1371
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:53,760
Post riots she lives with her family
in Calicut.

1372
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,760
Yesterday a mysterious man came
to her residence with guitar.

1373
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,400
Performed a song in front of her house...

1374
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,640
...that disturbed the peace of the locals.

1375
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,160
On receiving a complaint
Calicut police intervened.

1376
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,800
Later arrested the man for trespassing.

1377
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:10,440
According to Muthalippu's complaint.

1378
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,160
His name is gypsy.

1379
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,920
Aforesaid man is the husband of Waheedha.

1380
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,720
He had already traveled
to several parts of the country...

1381
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,720
...performed music that made controversies.

1382
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,720
Kerala police sources confirmed.

1383
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:26,120
This incident has raised tension
in and around Calicut.

1384
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:28,600
If you want to lock him up
for singing.

1385
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,080
You should start with K.J. Yesudas.

1386
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,520
Gypsy is just a beginner.

1387
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,960
We shall deal with it later.

1388
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,800
Don't you dare to disturb him again?

1389
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,800
Release him now.

1390
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,640
Comrade.

1391
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,960
To rescue your wife.
I am risking my wife.

1392
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,280
Go for it.

1393
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,360
His songs are not just a personal outcry.

1394
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,240
It's a loud cry for the whole society.

1395
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,040
Gypsy's song must go viral
throughout the country.

1396
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,280
- This is our political activity.
- OK Comrade.

1397
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,720
Movie songs and other videos
trends in internet.

1398
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,240
This must reach the people.

1399
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,640
This is also a form of protest.
Got it.

1400
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:59,680
"Like a rainbow your smile.
Whose almighty wiped it?"

1401
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:09,760
"Like long wings your freedom.
Whose almighty clipped it?"

1402
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:16,600
"To see my beloved."

1403
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:21,800
"I crossed the sea and mountains."

1404
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:24,560
"To Show your milky face."

1405
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:29,640
"Come back.
My little girl."

1406
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,600
Would you like to continue
this relationship?

1407
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,240
Aren't they asking you?
Say it.

1408
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,280
She is not willing
to come with you.

1409
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,040
You may pronounce
the first talaq.

1410
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:51,960
In front of this council...

1411
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,640
...I am pronouncing the first talaq...

1412
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:57,520
Talaq.

1413
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,920
First talaq is pronounced.

1414
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,000
You will pronounce the second talaq
in due course.

1415
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:33,200
"In an immoral nation."

1416
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,360
"Whose blood fills the street?"

1417
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:43,880
"Setting fire on our diversity."

1418
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:49,400
"Whose peace is burning alive?"

1419
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:55,120
"On to your folding hands."

1420
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,960
"I fill my breath by screaming."

1421
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,240
"Keeping my last breath."

1422
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:08,680
"It's for you.
My beloved daughter."

1423
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,560
She agrees for the second talaq.

1424
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,400
You may pronounce the second talaq.

1425
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:20,640
"A year of separation already."

1426
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:23,160
"Is unbearable."

1427
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,000
Talaq.

1428
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:31,320
"Come fall in my shoulder."

1429
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,400
"To shed tears."

1430
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,600
Everybody should disperse.

1431
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:39,200
Gypsy was detained
in his wife resident.

1432
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:43,000
Yesterday near writer

Gypsy was arrested by
Calicut police for unlawful assembly.

1434

He has been continuously performing
around Kerala mostly in public places.

1435
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,160
He not only writes songs for his wife...

1436
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:57,600
But also for all social injustice
across the country.

1437

1438
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,400

...unlawful assembly and he was booked
under several other sections.

1440
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:09,520
What?

1441
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,200
Sir. He wants to piss.

1442
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,360
Do you want to piss?

1443
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,360
Drink this...

1444
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,360
Drink it.
Scoundrel.

1445
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,120
Drink it.

01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,120
You wanted to piss. Right?

1447
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,320
He says he wanted to piss.

1448
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,840
Give him water.

1449
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,720
Gypsy

1450
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,800
What crime he has done?
Is it for music?

1451
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,520
We all have freedom of expression.

1452
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,920
It is called democracy.

1453
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,440
- Got it?
- Stop it.

1454
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,280
He sang in public
disrupting law and order.

1455
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:10,480
It's an order from high officials.

1456
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,560
- I'm not answerable to you.
- I know all your foul plays.

1457
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,280
News media is waiting outside.

1458
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,840
Release him before it
becomes a sensation.

1459
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,360
Yes sir.

1460
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,560
OK Sir.

1461
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,040
OK Sir.

1462
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,400
We shall release him.

1463
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,560
Release him.

1464
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,880
Ask him to leave.

1465
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,360
Everybody clear off.

1466
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:33,960
Let's go Gypsy.

1467
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,000
Get lost.

1468
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,760
Comrades...
Wait a second.

1469
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:43,240
Stop him.

1470
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:45,040
You.
Hold on.

1471
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,280
Sir.

1472
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,400
Comrade is really pissed off.

1473
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,240
Comrade is really really pissed off.

1474
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:05,280
You should never forget this.

1475
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,920
Get me some more water.

1476
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:25,800
Long live the revolution.
Long live the revolution.

1477
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,120
Comrade has come.

1478
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,680
- Red salute comrades.
- Red salute comrades.

1479
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,640
Do not disturb him.

1480
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,760
Take your seat.

1481
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,360
- Give us a bottle of palm wine.
- Two bottles?

1482
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,000
Waheedha.

1483
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:54,800
When she agreed for the divorce...

1484
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,880
...She appeared to be a strange person.

1485
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:02,160
Comrade...
I couldn't bear that pain.

1486
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:07,240
I don't know why is she
so scared of me?

1487
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:09,440
Comrade.

1488
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,320
Comrade.

1489
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,200
Senior said, 'Death is a beautiful rest'.

1490
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,600
His death was not that painful to me.

1491
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:20,840
Only two things
I loved most in my life.

1492
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,920
My horse.
My wife Waheedha.

1493
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,400
My horse was dead.

1494
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,840
He was burnt in front of me.

1495
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,600
Now.

1496
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,000
I am only left with Waheedha .

1497
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:37,000
She is burning inside me.

1498
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,280
Right here.
Right here.

1499
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,560
Her face appears to me everywhere.

1500
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,640
If I pronounce the final talaq...

1501
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,040
...then I cannot see her forever.

1502
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,680
Comrade...I want to live with my wife.

1503
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,480
I want to hold my baby.

1504
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,440
She is everything to me.
Only her love.

1505
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,920
If she is beside me.

1506
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,480
Then I am a Millionaire...

1507
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,760
...an Artist,

1508
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,960
A King.

1509
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,920
What is it Comrade?

1510
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,560
Bursting into tears.

1511
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,160
Didn't you marry Waheeda by eloping?

1512
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,040
Then why do you have to worry...

1513
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:37,120
For few people
risk is part of their life.

1514
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,760
But for you.
Life offers nothing but risk.

1515
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,080
Comrade...This is nothing to you.

1516
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:46,720
Why are you hesitant?

1517
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,280
I am on your side.

1518
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:55,880
I'll deal her father with a punch
in his face.

1519
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:00,040
When her father is away from home...

1520
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:01,680
You meet her and...

1521
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,520
...take her far away from his eye sight.

1522
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,200
What are you thoughtful about?

1523
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,360
About the horse?

1524
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,000
Don't worry about it.

1525
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,040
I will be your horse.

1526
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,160
Want to see a horse now?
Speak out Comrade.

1527
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,520
Look at this.

1528
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,520
I will become a horse
If takes to bring your wife back.

1529
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,160
I will be your Che.

1530
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,760
Take your wife and daughter.
Leave as soon as possible.

1531
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,120
Live with them happily forever.

1532
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:42,400
Comrade.
Comrade...!

1533
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,280
Take a look at this.

1534
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,880
Comrade...

1535
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,280
This belongs to friend of mine.
Who lives in Calicut Beach.

1536
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,040
How is it?

1537
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,160
Comrade...Go get her.

1538
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,000
Follow me.

1539
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,800
Comrade...Stay here...

1540
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,160
Her father went outside.
Let's move.

1541
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,400
Obey me Chaplin...!

1542
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,920
Comrade.

1543
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,480
If her father comes back...

1544
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,920
I will shout the God is greater.

1545
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,800
If police arrives,
I will shout long live revolution.

1546
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,360
Go get her Comrade.

1547
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,840
Long live revolution.

1548
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:45,200
Waheedha...
Come out...

1549
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,040
What you want?

1550
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,320
My baby.

1551
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:59,160
Waheedha...Don't be scared.
Let's start fresh.

1552
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,200
Waheedha.

1553
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,760
This is not my horse.

1554
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,520
You have also changed a lot.

1555
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,040
You said it on your
marriage ceremony...

1556
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,200
...to take you away with me.

1557
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,120
Now I insist the same.
Come let's go now.

1558
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,920
Waheedha...

1559
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,800
I will make all your wishes
come true.

1560
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,360
We shall build a house near TajMahal.

1561
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,040
I will stay there to look after...

1562
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,640
...you and our baby.

1563
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,040
I miss you and our baby a lot.

1564
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,080
Waheedha...

1565
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,120
Baby...

1566
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,880
Daddy is here...

1567
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,120
- Leave the baby alone...
- Let me have...

1568
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,320
- Little dove.
- Give her back.

1569
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,080
- Leave the baby.
- Ask Waheedha to come.

1570
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,480
- My sweet pumpkin.
- He took the baby.

1571
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:53,160
- Giver her back or else...
- Ask her to come.

1572
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,720
Give the baby back.

1573
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,800
Give her back.
Call Waheedha out.

1574
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,440
- Do it now.
- Sister.

1575
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:07,480
God is Greater.
God is Greater.

1576
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:13,920
Chaplin...
Run away.

1577
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,440
Bison Brother...
May peace be upon you.

1578
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:19,760
God is Greater...

1579
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:37,920
One more person to come.

1580
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,400
I am your daddy.

1581
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:46,600
It's daddy.

1582
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:00,040
How sad?
I don't even know your name.

1583
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,560
Let me think of a name for you.

1584
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,320
White dove.

1585
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,560
White little dove.
White little dove.

1586
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,280
We shall bring back your mommy soon.

1587
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:20,720
Look here.
Look here.

1588
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,640
We are home.
Little Dove.

1589
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:37,080
Daddy is here.

1590
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:39,040
Let's sit here.
Let's sit here.

1591
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:43,000
Look here.
My little Dove.

1592
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:44,600
Look at here.

1593
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,680
Baby don't cry.

1594
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,800
I am your daddy.

1595
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,280
Look here.
Look here.

1596
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,800
It's a hungry cry of a baby.

1597
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,160
Look here.
My little dove.

1598
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,800
Look at here.

1599
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:03,960
Look at here.

1600
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:06,320
My little bunny.
My Bitsy.

1601
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,440
My Little pumpkin.
My little dove.

1602
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,200
It's alright.
We will be fine...

1603
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:28,840
"Lullaby"

1604
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,560
Rascal, Scoundrel.

1605
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,120
- To the party leader's house.
- OK we will.

1606
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,960
Two of you check in the party office.

1607
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,120
Let's move.

1608
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,560
Daddy.
Daddy.

1609
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,800
Fajila.
Don't.

1610
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:38,240
One minute.

1611
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:47,280
Her father came here with the prophet.

1612
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,000
I have tried to convince him.

1613
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,400
Tomorrow...

1614
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,960
He has asked you to pronounce
the third talaq.

1615
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:56,040
I might have dealt it easily.
If it is not religious.

1616
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,880
They will threaten to politicize
with religious sentiments.

1617
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,960
Your wife is unwell too.

1618
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,240
We have to maintain patience.

1619
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:05,560
Stay calm.

1620
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:07,760
Take a look at this.

1621
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,440
During freedom struggle
many revolutionists were...

1622
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,760
...underground right there.

1623
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:13,120
Stay here for a while.

1624
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:15,600
They can't dissolute your marriage
without your third talaq.

1625
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:16,880
Why should I hide?

1626
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:21,000
'There is politics in the relationships of
human being', says Marx

1627
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:23,720
Politics also distorts the relationships
of human being.

1628
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,480
Comrade.
Follow me.

1629
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,240
You are right.

1630
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,520
Politics distorts the relationships
of human being.

1631
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:38,080
Who does this? Why they do this?
Think about it comrade...

1632
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:39,320
One minute.

1633
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:41,960
She is even scared of me.

1634
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:49,080
I don't know what exactly happened
for her in the riots.

1635
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,680
Ever since then.
She started panicking for all things.

1636
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:02,080
When she left us...

1637
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:05,880
I thought she would get a life outside.

1638
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,800
But she came back like an insane person.

1639
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:12,320
She is even scared of you.

1640
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,320
She is just like an vegetable.

1641
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:16,960
God knows how to cure her illness.

1642
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,240
Everything in the country is politicized.

1643
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,880
In war, riots and in all clashes...

1644
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,760
...women are considered as their honor.

1645
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,440
Women are easy targets to shame.

1646
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,640
In war why do they rape women?

1647
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:30,360
Why a girl is made to run nude?

1648
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,280
Why do they rape a girl
inside the temple?

1649
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,080
Why should a school kid
die in the bomb blast?

1650
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:38,360
Why is your wife separated from you?

1651
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,520
Who masterminds all these?
Think about it.

1652
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,440
Innocent people's Language,Race...

1653
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,240
...Caste, Religion, Land, Hunger, Pain, Love.

1654
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:51,880
He who politicize these things.

1655
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,880
He who mint money
out of everything.

1656
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,360
He is our enemy.

1657
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,960
He who spread hatred amongst us.

1658
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,400
He is our enemy.

1659
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:01,000
He should be destroyed.

1660
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:04,440
It is enemy who decides on our weapon.

1661
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,000
We should snatch that weapon
before he does.

1662
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,520
If innocents were attacked...

1663
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,000
They must realize that
we will also take our revenge.

1664
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,080
Muthalippu...
Aren't they coming?

1665
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,800
We are waiting in the assembly.

1666
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:38,280
Gypsy is missing.

1667
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,240
Don't play your games.

1668
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:42,120
Believe it not.
He is not here.

1669
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:44,160
I am also wondering
where he has gone.

1670
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:58,680
"I found human hated another human.
Feeling the pain of separation."

1671
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,760
"The difference in language,
religion, and race..."

1672
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,800
"...using it to spread hatred.
It is terrorism."

1673
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:07,720
"Disease.
Disease."

1674
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:10,800
"Spreads to divide people
is the disease of terrorism."

1675
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,040
"Disease.
Disease."

1676
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,040
"Spreads to infect people
is the disease of terrorism."

1677
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:20,040
"Disease.
Disease."

1678
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:23,240
"Spreads to divide people
is the disease of terrorism."

1679
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,160
"Disease.
Disease."

1680
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,480
"Spreads into each nation.
Will it not be gone."

1681
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,720
After the riots many were missing.

1682
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,840
The sword man is missing ever since then.

1683
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,200
Sevapuri residents might know about him.

1684
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,840
"Swinging like an axe
I am coming for you."

1685
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:41,000
"Like a roaming militant
from a burnt slum."

1686
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:44,120
He is an Sevapuri resident.
He went missing after the riots.

1687
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,800
"In how many ways these religious goons
can separate people?"

1688
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:48,920
"Retaliating is needed."

1689
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,920
"Using muscles to curb
the free speech is a crime."

1690
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,760
"With all stacked artillery..."

1691
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:54,560
Whose God is accountable?
Yours or mine.

1692
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,640
My dad was burnt alive.

1693
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:59,200
He went to bazaar with his daughter.

1694
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:01,680
We came to know he dead
only through news channel.

1695
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:04,320
They burnt my cat and house.

1696
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:07,280
They killed my mommy to save God.

1697
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,400
I am going to kill him.
I am going to stab him.

1698
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:15,440
"There is no boundary to this land."

1699
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:18,200
"We dig lands only to excavate skulls."

1700
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,200
"I'll come for you.
to revenge with your own weapon."

1701
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:24,840
"In wires of the bomb.
A parting kiss."

1702
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,880
"After many blood sheds.
still roaming to incite riots?"

1703
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,840
"Blood dripping on the floor
belongs to our brothers and sisters."

1704
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:39,080
"Disease.
Terrorism is a disease."

1705
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:41,040
My sister gave birth to a child.

1706
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:41,800
It's our blood.

1707
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,400
One more to strengthen our army.

1708
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:47,160
How are you?
We shall go home soon.

1709
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,080
Sir.

1710
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,800
Many have lost their lives.
Your daughter is lucky to be alive.

1711
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:55,120
Lord Kasi Viswanath had saved your daughter.

1712
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:59,840
"Terrorism is disease.
Terrorism is disease."

1713
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:04,280
"Women are worshipped in this nation.
lustful killing still exists."

1714
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,280
"Arrogance in separatism.
Will it not change?"

1715
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:10,000
"Women are worshipped in this nation.
Lustful killing still exists."

1716
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:13,360
"Arrogance in separatism.
Will it not change?"

1717
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:16,520
"For Food, For Rights.
Kids who long for love in poverty."

1718
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:19,760
"With pride, barbarians
who prey on innocents."

1719
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:22,720
"Disease.
Disease."

1720
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,760
"Spreads to divide people.
The disease of terrorism."

1721
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,840
"Disease.
Disease."

1722
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:32,360
"Spreads to infect people.
The disease of terrorism."

1723
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,920
"Disease.
Disease."

1724
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,400
"Spreads to divide people.
The disease of terrorism."

1725
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:41,080
"Disease.
Disease."

1726
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:43,400
"Spreads into each nation.
Will it not be gone."

1727
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,920
"The disease of terrorism."

1728
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:04,000
What do you want?

1729
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:05,440
Who are you?

1730
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:28,680
Move it.

1731
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:39,040
[Chanting mantra]

1732
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,080
There was a time...

1733
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,280
People were scared even
to pronounce my name.

1734
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:28,800
Now, even street kids call me a psychopath.

1735
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,400
They made me to do all these crimes
in the name of God.

1736
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:34,800
That's why this punishment.

1737
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:38,520
All my sins make me sleepless.

1738
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,880
There isn't any sacred river
to wash away my sins.

1739
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:46,720
Despite doing all these crimes
for the sake of God.

1740
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,480
I went into temple
to worship the very same God.

1741
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,560
My fellow men...

1742
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:56,640
...threw me out of temple
saying, I am a lower caste.

1743
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,320
They chopped both of my hands.

1744
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,760
The man who made me
to participate in this riot...

1745
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,600
...is now the chief minister of this state.

1746
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:11,560
My fellow men had became his ministers.

1747
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:15,280
They all had ignored me.

1748
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,200
I worked for them
when they needed me the most.

1749
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,680
I am not with them anymore.

1750
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:23,880
They threatened to kill my family
by sending goons...

1751
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,320
...fearing that I will be their whistle blower.

1752
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:30,800
I realized this only after being hospitalized.

1753
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,840
Words like Caste, Religion,
Hindu, Muslim are words...

1754
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:35,560
...to divide people.

1755
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:39,080
Who asked to bomb
in the name of Allah?

1756
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,360
Who asked to murder
in the name of Lord Ram?

1757
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:44,160
Do not believe the person
who depict our God as murderers.

1758
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:46,040
This is my wife.

1759
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:51,160
She is the bread winner of my family.

1760
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,920
She is been shamed because of me.

1761
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:57,360
Like her, Many families are suffering
because of me...

1762
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:01,520
I may rot in hell.

1763
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:09,040
I am a rioter one among
who participated in this huge riot.

1764
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:11,520
Like me many where brain washed.

1765
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,280
Being uneducated I have become a criminal.

1766
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:17,240
My children should go to school.

1767
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:18,840
They will get education.

1768
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:20,800
Only then this will all be changed.

1769
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,400
Like Waheeda and me.

1770
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:26,880
...many families across the country living
a sorrowful life.

1771
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,920
Like my horse.
Many lives were burnt alive.

1772
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:31,520
Many children.
Many mothers.

1773
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,960
Many more rioters.

1774
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,640
Sword and Gun hurts another human.

1775
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,680
It is music which heals another human.

1776
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:46,520
Gypsy.

1777
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:48,680
Waheedha's father came to our party's office.

1778
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,560
He wants you
to pronounce the final talaq.

1779
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,840
He threatens to arrange another marriage
for your wife.

1780
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,160
Your wife's mental illness is yet to be cured.

1781
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,240
I am going to take this matter to court.

1782
02:07:58,400 --> 02:07:59,640
Leave it Comrade.

1783
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:01,480
Ask him to bring Waheedha here.

1784
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,920
I will pronounce the final talaq.

1785
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,560
We are not done fighting this.

1786
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:05,760
It's alright Comrade.

1787
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:06,800
According to Muslim law...

1788
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:10,440
Talaq can be pronounced with the council.
Where I was married.

1789
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,800
They can settle this dispute.
Only if they come here.

1790
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,600
At least I may get the final glimpse of
My wife and child.

1791
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,600
Gypsy.
Gypsy.

1792
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:27,880
World needs...

1793
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:30,480
...peace, love and humanity.

1794
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:32,840
The two faces of the riots...

1795
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,960
...Will meet in this concert.

1796
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,640
Presenting...
Gypsy's peace concert.

1797
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,800

Truth is...

1825

I was part of Lallapura Hindu-Muslim riot.

1826
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,560
Everyone knew about it.
It is media who exposed it.

1827
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:27,320
The man who masterminded the riot...

1828
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,240
...is none other than our chief minister.

1829
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,400
I was a cadre in his party

Our countries progress in not his ambition.

1834
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:47,800
One nation, one religion, one language...

1835
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,680
...is his motto to destroy
the plurality of this country.

1836
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:53,280
He wants to polarize people for votes...

1837
02:10:53,320 --> 02:10:56,120
...to gain his political supremacy
is his objective.

1838
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:58,040
He will go to any extreme to achieve it.

1839
02:10:58,080 --> 02:10:59,680
He will kill anyone to get it.

1840
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:01,680

It's a nice to see it on TV.

1848
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,160

- State would have sponsored this event.

1850
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:30,400

We should not react to this now.

1852
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:34,120
We will not harm them now.

1853
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,440
You have to travel to Varanasi...

1854
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:40,120
...for your daughter's final talaq.

1855
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,280
If not...

1856
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,840
This will be dealt only in court.

1857
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,280

02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,360
He is in power.
Hence he will not act directly.

1869
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:28,880
We should accomplish his wish.

1870

Do it.

1871
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,640
For our ideology to survive...

1975
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:37,320
"With different routes and languages."

1976
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:38,520
"With rivers and forest."

1977
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:39,800

1978
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:42,480

1988
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:11,560
"Let's bring peace."

1989
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:20,160
In the name of God.
Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1990
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:22,280
You have already pronounced two talaq.

1991
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,640
Time for third talaq.

1992
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:27,120
God has willed it.
In the name of God.

1993
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,760
If third talaq is pronounced...

1994
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:31,200
...Your marriage will be dissolved.

1995
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,880
Then you will be separated.

1996
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:35,000
You both should find your own ways.

1997
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:38,080
You may now pronounce the final talaq.

1998
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:41,120
"My lost life..."

1999
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:43,680
In front of this council members.

2000
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:49,000
"My dear baby, turned to mother
will you speak to me"

2001
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:51,600
I am pronouncing the...

2002
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:52,600
Third...

02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:54,560
"Music unable to solace me"

2004
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:57,360
"Can't live without you, my baby"

2005
02:23:57,400 --> 02:23:59,520
"Will you join me?"

2006
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,120
Third...

2007
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:06,720
"A year of separation already."

2008
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:09,160
"Is unbearable."

2009
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:16,760
"Come fall in my shoulder."

2010
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:19,720
"To shed tears."

2011
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:28,960
My little dove.

2012
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:46,120
