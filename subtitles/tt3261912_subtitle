00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,439
My God!

KarthimKarthi...

4
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,212
What are you doing Karthi?

5
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,571
Doing a piss.

6
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,203
Sounded like brushing?

7
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,105
What is the time?
- It's only 4. Go and sleep!

00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:25,333
Movie Channel

9
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,509
You timid fellow!

10
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:36,838
Robber...hey girl, look, robber!
- Hey man don't yell Iikethis!

11
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:40,107
Hey Karthi...it's a different case!
Somebody come running!

12
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,906
Which one?
- Hide and seek.

13
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,502
My dignity will be lost
if compatriots hear this!

14
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,113
Somebody catch!
Is it not Kunjam ma?

15
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,180
Look robber!
Had ran to that side.

16
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,109
Here he goes, robber.

17
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,643
My lord robber! Robber!
What is it Kunjam ma?

18
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,043
Came looking out when
someone called robber.

19
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:06,173
You idiot! Who will be responsible
if that person catches you and go?

20
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,305
You must understand Kochuvareeth
and wife has got only dignity as wealth.

21
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,902
That you must understand Kunjam ma.

22
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,912
Robber! Ran to that side
Run fast man!

23
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,671
There he goes robber stop there!

24
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,837
What is the problem? - One robber.
Don't leave him. Catch him.

25
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,980
What we saw there is road side
eatery owner Kochuvareeth's wife...

26
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,274
...Kunjam ma and gold smith Chandran.

27
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,346
Robber! Robber! Robber!

28
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,280
My Jesus! What nonsense
are they saying Karthi?

29
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,878
The one who really robbed is
Kunjamma and Chandran is it not?

30
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,842
Keep quite!

31
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:40,473
Come fast there is also a lady. Robber!

32
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,474
The mighty lord high above...

33
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,407
...help them to reach here
without being caught by anyone.

34
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,910
The hole dug by you,
you will yourself fall in to it.

35
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,044
The stone being rolled
by you will fall on yourself.

36
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,409
So the cross is made sure
is it not Lord?

37
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,610
Jesus! Had reached.

38
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,312
In the name of Jesus
and in thy name..

39
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,107
Come!

40
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,240
Come daughter come fast!

41
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,136
Come!

42
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:51,980
Hey boy look! Even if you
don't feed she must be fed!

43
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,875
Hey boy! These guys are not hearing!

44
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,074
Even if you don't adorn cloths she
must be clothed. I will not say all that.

45
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,074
But should show this love always.

46
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,311
Must not create a chance that
you are fed and she left to hunger.

47
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:10,344
Lord! Save them.
And also myself.

48
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,377
Take the boat fast!

49
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:31,745
What are you thinking?

50
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,568
Anything about the future?

51
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:37,904
- No.

52
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,244
Do you think what is
done by us is wrong?

53
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:44,707
- No.

54
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,007
Then?

55
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,469
We won't have taken that route.

56
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,041
Which route?

57
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:56,242
That is why the Chandran and
Kunjamma got separated in the half way.

58
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:14,333
(A prayer song)

59
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:30,112
(Praising the Lord)

60
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,813
How many times have told you not to
turn on the phone inside the temple?

61
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,173
Swamy, that's your phone.

62
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:39,277
Is that so? Might have happened
something to mother isn't it?

63
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,111
What is it?

64
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,134
Okay will come now.

65
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,238
Father!

66
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,935
What is it Varghese?

67
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,512
Where are you speeding up to?

68
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,705
I have an urgent holy mass"

69
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,007
Is it death? Who is the one dead?

70
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,076
Don't know who and all will die.

71
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:13,968
Mathews...

72
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,774
Anandam...

73
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,842
Where is the money
that was in my pocket?

74
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,934
I don't know.

75
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,845
Before this you had snatched
from my pocket several times.

76
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:29,642
By God I have not seen it.

77
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,013
On placing 500 will becomeloo
on placing 100 it will become 10!

78
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,273
You thief! Other than you
who else is there in the house?

79
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,278
So that means...
I'm the robber is it not?

80
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,441
Look...make it low
other people will hear.

81
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:48,916
Karthimhave you ever told lies to me?
- No.

82
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,073
But I have told.

83
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,540
Tickets...

84
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,744
2 Ooty.
- 2,600.

85
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,611
Balance 4,00.

86
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,270
Rs. 4,00 as tips!

87
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,637
Rs. 4,00 as tips!

88
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:11,575
Keep quite!

89
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,776
Is it honey moon trip?

90
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,242
You smarty? You have found it?
How is my Tamil Karthi?

91
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,308
Original Tamil!

92
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,979
I am going with Karthik.

93
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,876
If she had done this utter cheating,
husband is the reason for this, father.

94
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:33,977
Underthe pretext of combine study,
they two lock up in the room and study.

95
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,206
If I say something against
husband will jump at me!

96
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,608
His belief was
if we doubt young children...

97
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,779
...the respect towards us
by them will be gone.

98
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,141
Then what happened?

99
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,174
How is the relationship
with the boy's family?

100
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,803
Are you in good terms?

101
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,508
For auditingmcoming and
going is in Mathew's boat.

102
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,345
On seeing in the boat or in the jetty...

103
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,141
...just a smile
that is all the relationship.

104
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,737
How daring to write a letter and go?

105
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,337
When the children are lulled so much
this will happen like this only.

106
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,913
Why not shall we go to
house of Mathew's?

107
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,339
Will get some information.

108
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,072
First of all give a complaint
to the police station.

109
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,374
Can give a complaint out of obstinacy.

110
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:20,279
But all the compatriots will
come to know that.

111
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,572
Then don't think ever will
get a good suitable alliance.

112
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,042
Not only that. My Lord if the bishop
at the abbey comes to know this...

113
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,077
Then what to do?

114
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,274
First of all must know
where the children are.

115
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,713
Must conduct a counseling and
make them understand in our...

116
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,510
...country it's very difficult to live
without joining in any religion.

117
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,609
Lucky if we could convert his religion.

118
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,880
When my heart is wounded
thinking about my daughter...

119
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,004
...father are you trying to add
members for the holy community?

120
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,146
What if they are found out
after some days?

121
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,040
Then both might have
started to live like a family.

122
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,544
Then there will be children.

123
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,373
Rita...

124
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,277
In the childhood...

125
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,347
...I and Thandamma at
Malikappuram have played...

126
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:03,380
...father and mother a lot and
have played by baking cakes a lot.

127
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,276
Thinking on that after the mass, when...

128
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:09,008
...Thandam ma comes to receive the holy
blessing can I behave in that manner?

129
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:09,770
What does it mean?

130
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,742
That means it's a child's play by children
for few days, game of baking cakes!

131
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,040
Don't take it seriously.

132
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,044
Not that Mathews...

133
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:25,218
...to elope early in the morning some
one might be there to assist is it not?

134
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:27,873
My dear Lord!

135
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,140
Don't beat me.

136
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,368
Un grateful fellow!

137
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,840
Father, I don't want to
see this devils face...

138
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:36,439
...seen not as a worker
but as a family member.

139
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,344
But still this fellow did this to me..

140
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:41,841
Enough Mathews.

141
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,140
Father, what I did is it a big mistake?

142
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,138
Look I..

143
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,347
Father, is it not in the bible which says...

144
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,913
...the Lord loves
the acts that are justifiable?

145
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,070
He and his bible!

146
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,305
Mathews what wrong did bible do?

147
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,310
Avira...
- Yes.

148
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:57,543
You tell where did that children go?

149
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,044
In the name of Lord
I don't know father.

150
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,741
I only dropped them to
the other shore that's all I did.

151
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,410
What a best match they are!

152
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,308
Father, you move aside
I'll show him today"

153
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,003
Mathews!

154
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,579
You go to the boat
no one should know this.

155
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,943
No father
I'm a grateful person, father.

156
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,272
He and his thankfulness!
Father, what are you saying?

157
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:14,935
Again should I make
him to stay beside me?

158
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:18,914
Yes indeed, otherwise he will
publicize this to the entire country.

159
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,270
<i>Come Narayanan Swamy.</i>

160
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:39,609
Greetings.
- Greetings.

161
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:40,507
Swamy you sit.

162
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,769
We are ready to forgive everything
what had happened till now.

163
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,276
We are ready to believe
that nothing had happened.

164
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,247
But Swamy must tell us
where he had gone with her.

165
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,777
Mathews, I do not know anything.

166
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:06,477
Father, at least once he will
only take food by sitting with me.

167
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,181
If he takes one grub from me
only then my stomach will be full.

168
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:15,306
Mathews, he is not only a son to me
but also a good friend of mine.

169
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,070
Do you know?

170
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,546
If you get any information Swamy
you must let us know immediately.

171
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:21,943
Since they are children...

172
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,313
...must tell them the situation and make
them understand and bring them back.

173
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:28,712
Till then otherthan
these two families of ours...

174
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,246
mothers shouldn't know

No that's not the thing.
- Then what?

179
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,079
In the childhood it reminds me of
how my father taught me to walk like this

He and his home sickness!

181

I have never stayed in a filthy

Whatever that was
purchased was expensive.

Are you telling the
account of expenses?

You calculate and keep what
ever that was spend for me.

245

As there was no money
I sold my cell phone.

00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:11,504
Karthi, there are bangles in the bag!

247
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,240
You go sell those and come. Will
shift to a better hotel and then...

the shower it was there in the bag.

Did you take it?

touch my belongings without asking.

along with papa is it not?

Accepting the tip did it
turn out to be a blunder?

Will give you the money now.

The post named as the husband
of worlds biggest humbug lady!

The boat belongs to
this obstinate lady.

339

When the boat is left to panchayat
it's then a public property.

340

That's also true!

00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,239
Karthi where did you go man?

352
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:48,507
Did you have anything what
had happened to you?

353
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,547
Why did you do like this?

354
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,374
Hey lady don't cry!

355
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:55,348
Don't know whether he had
food or not first give him a coffee.

356
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,208
First bring the child inside.

357
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,170
Father forgive me.

358
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,644
Come son.

359
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,641
Child have gone somewhere and
come. Might have got bad omen!

360
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:20,270
Daughter!

362
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:45,449
What is it lady? Did you miss me?
Are you on animosity with me?

363
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:53,040
Naughty! Are you not
being cared by anyone?

364
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:55,604
Give the coffee?

365
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:57,107
Coffee!

366
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,843
Rita is there ice cream?

367
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,045
Sister have it!

368
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,881
Want some?
No need!

369
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,446
A matured girl going with
a boy whom she liked...

370
00:40:30,534 --> 00:40:32,673
...it's on practice from
the ages of Christ.

371
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:36,773
But in this family including
me where it's possessed

372
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,905
with 2 sisters and 3 fathers.

373
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,913
A girl in this family that too
with a boy from other caste.

374
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:42,945
Can't be pardoned!

375
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,445
Forget about the caste.

376
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,878
Mathews it's not a thing
that can be disdained.

377
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,573
If you liked him why not you could
have told that straight away to me?

378
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,840
Thinking why did you go with him?

379
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,436
At that time felt like that.

380
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:01,373
He told you will not admit our love.
So I asked shall we elope?

381
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:03,846
Then he said okay to it then left.

382
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,711
And now what had happened?

383
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,041
Now I don't like him.

384
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:15,614
After some time after having a
child and felt this dislike means.

385
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:17,169
It's better than that is it not?

386
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,807
Good only after doing the test drive
and if it's liked only then the...

387
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,470
...vehicle has to be
purchased is it so?

388
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,011
Father what are you saying?

389
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:47,302
Take that one.

390
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,142
<i>I will</i> wash.

391
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:05,507
Hey lady ask!

392
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,980
You are a girl who have stayed with
a boy for 3 to 4 days and came back.

393
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,271
If something happened?

394
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,037
Mother do you want to
know whether we have...

395
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,010
...shared the bed together?

396
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,636
Call papa I will tell swearing.

397
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:21,910
Mother whom will you
believe in this world?

398
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,911
If you don't believe
your own daughter.

399
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,880
Susan what is this? A small mistake
that was corrected by her also.

400
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,879
Then how come you behave
with misunderstanding...

401
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:31,843
...and doubts in the mind?

402
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,880
After all you are her mother is it not?

403
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,310
Really it's papa who wants to know.

404
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,678
What?

405
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:49,405
Sister nothing
between you took place?

406
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:58,807
It's good that sister came back.

407
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:10,940
He has been sitting there
alone for a very long time.

408
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,677
Not saying anything also.

409
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,039
Will it be enough that you sit
here and check the accounts...

410
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:19,147
...go and talk to him?

411
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:30,835
Leave!

412
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:40,311
Why? Like a child.

413
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:42,106
Mind is brooding over something.

414
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,576
Mathews what non
sense are you talking?

415
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,477
Father it's because you don't
understand what I mean.

416
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:53,207
Those children have
eloped in a sudden plight.

417
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,677
It's we who have to see that
tomorrow in their life there should...

418
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,611
...not be any complications.

419
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:03,510
For that both families must
talk and unite them!

420
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:07,013
For their marriage I must
undertake the holy role is it not?

421
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,946
I don't have any one in
the position of siblings.

422
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,241
Don't bother what the
men in community says...

423
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,177
...father must come with me.

424
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:24,441
Get in fast.

425
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,001

go taking father Joy?

428
00:44:40,534 --> 00:44:42,536
Is it to fix my marriage?

429
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:46,643
Father joy told me everything when
his grandmother evicted you...

430
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:49,010
...from the house. Father left
without saying anything is it not?

431
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:54,550
Without listening to my denial father
went there and talked just for you.

432
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,137
On coming back did it became a
burden and a dis-fame father...

433
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,543
...tell me that directly?

434
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,074
Are you going to cross papa?

435
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,877
I eloped on that day without
thinking father's dignity and fame.

436
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,743
But never again my papa be
Iittled in front of anyone for me.

437
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:12,476
Are you sure that Karthik will
not be in your mind again?

438
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:22,170
Hey Karthi when Mathews
came and while talking all of a...

439
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:28,309
...sudden grandmother reacted. Father
Joy who was with Mathews fired it up!

440
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,313
Then all of you just like in
market quarreled there!

441
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,008
Mathews is a gentle man. After
leaving grand mother and father to fight.

442
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,307
We walked in to the enclosures.

443
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,576
Do you know? After a gap of 15
years father smoked a cigarette!

444
00:45:41,634 --> 00:45:42,442
You!

445
00:45:43,734 --> 00:45:47,739
That Mathews in a gap of half an
hour finished 4 cigarettes man!

446
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,309
That Mathews has got a doubt
not only for him for me also.

447
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,708
What father?
Do you still love that girl?

448
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,802
Father why are you asking like this?

449
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,881
What is between you and Riya
is actually an ego problem.

now on that chapter is closed.

454

Child, a drunkards mind who takes
medicines to get rid off alcoholism.

455
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:25,439
The mind of a failed lover will be
similar. There won't be any change.

456
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:31,578
Then anger, frustration, the mind is
like a good kite if not controlled...

457
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:35,376
...properly will go somewhere.

458

said it's better to continue in that job.

neglect him without facing him.

situation when you were to see him!

So due to that, in front of him make
it to learn that he is no one to you!

Gone mad! Is it?

523
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,877
Karthik do you know Riya before?

524
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,306
No, since you guys are from
same place simply asked.

525
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:36,268
That is..

526
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,175
While doing this grooming
is it necessary that the...

527
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,370
...girls must be touched?

528
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:46,379
Mustn't take this touch so silly!

529
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:48,038
The bigger things that has to be
expressed to other person can...

530
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,604
...be communicated
through a simple touch.

531
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,974
Haven't you heard?

532
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:54,980
When two people kisses the
entire world gets changed.

533
00:57:55,034 --> 00:57:57,241
There are various kinds of touches!

534
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,973
All the touching has
got it's own meanings also.

535
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:12,876
There is only one thing in this.

536
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:23,338
What is it?

537
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,613
Karthik come. Let's go!

538
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,270
One sec will come now.

539
00:58:57,633 --> 00:59:01,604
Sherin will you drop
me to that bus stop?

540
00:59:17,834 --> 00:59:21,680
Really duped! It seems
it's not getting started!

541
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:24,741
Okay it's urgent for me.

542
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:32,834
Movie Channel

543
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,510
Daughter you drink!

544
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:27,511
Are you on online?
When I said hi hadn't replied!

545
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:32,374
Now I'm chatting with Karthik.

546
01:00:41,467 --> 01:00:46,467
Movie Channel

547
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:23,209
I couldn't get it?

548
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:28,205
Tell Karthik to dress
decently while grooming girls.

549
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:31,540
He hasn't worn nothing at all!

550
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:34,705
Just one shorts!
Shorts are there is it not?

551
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,143
A good friend of mine.

552
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,612
During the time of shooting
he wears only shorts!

553
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:51,046
One wears the dress
which is liked by him is it not?

554
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,976
I've also worn shorts!

555
01:02:12,134 --> 01:02:14,580
For you also from tomorrow onwards
can come wearing a shorts!

556
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:16,045
I won't say anything!

557
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,446
From now on if you come here
by opening this door with silly...

558
01:02:22,534 --> 01:02:24,411
...complaints I will make
'shorts' compulsory!

559
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,140
Why is that girls hate
'shorts' to this extend?

560
01:02:48,467 --> 01:02:49,878
That Karthik is not a good guy!

561
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,439
In the native place he had
eloped with a girl and had...

562
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,946
...come back after three days!

563
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,366
Then that girl might be wrong!

564
01:02:57,367 --> 01:02:59,966
That girl is innocent
she was trapped.

565
01:02:59,967 --> 01:03:02,004
Luckily nothing happened to her!

566
01:03:02,067 --> 01:03:08,882
Well, after staying for 3 days with
a guy like Karthik, don't con!

567
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:10,605
It's true!
Get lost girl!

568
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:11,611
It's true!

569
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:32,441
We'll go.

570
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,608
Bring it nearer man!

571
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,411
See that you don't slip.

572
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,636
Don't splash the water.

573
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,243
What a rain this year?

574
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,546
Leave the slippers here.

575
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,772
Come, come.

576
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:17,869
Greetings!

577
01:04:18,934 --> 01:04:21,039
Last night also it was
heavy rain was it not?

578
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:21,669
Yes, yes.

579
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,370
It's a surprise visit is it not?

580
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,342
Yes, yes.
Please sit!

581
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,242
What is this?

582
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,042
Some homemade food
stuffs, made as a special.

583
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,205
Had not made it un
holy by inter mixing.

584
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,975
For eatables there is no un holiness!

585
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:36,104
When mother gets a
chance will eat fish also.

586
01:04:36,434 --> 01:04:37,242
Is it so?

587
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:42,339
My husband was in Calcutta,
there all the Brahmins take fish.

588
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:45,411
Like that I also got used to it.

589
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:47,708
At Calcutta fish means
'flower of the water'

590
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,973
Anyway that's great
I thought that...

591
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:52,377
...mother will scold me
the moment I came.

592
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,278
That matter is closed
on that day itself.

593
01:04:57,267 --> 01:04:58,041
Has Riya not come?

594
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,169
There are few guests at home stay.

595
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:02,440
Riya has gone for a
boating along with them.

596
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:07,078
We have come to inform
a happy news about Riya.

597
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:12,279
The parents will be happy only if
the daughters gets a good alliance.

598
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,007
Wishes that means the
marriage is fixed for Riya.

599
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:16,671
Yes.
Anyway that is good.

600
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:17,812
The bride is from France,

601
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,280
Oncologist. On fixing,
thought will inform you first.

602
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:24,244
Did the daughter like the boy?

603
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,578
She has got no particular
choice told us to decide.

604
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:29,475
Fine indeed!

605
01:05:30,534 --> 01:05:33,071
For everything you
people must be present!

606
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:35,545
What is there to ask? We
are there for everything!

607
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,707
Serve the coffee to all!

608
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:28,269
Has Karthik not come?

609
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:31,837
A marriage proposal.
Had gone to meet that girl.

610
01:06:57,034 --> 01:07:00,174
If it were to transfer the
same as it is in to the laptop.

611
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:07,305
This is our company's prestigious
project. Is it the new look and feel?

612
01:07:07,433 --> 01:07:08,605
Today before noon..

613
01:07:24,134 --> 01:07:24,669
How?

614
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:27,140
My briefing didn't have the clarity.

615
01:07:31,867 --> 01:07:34,347
Karthi, you seldom
make a mistake like that!

616
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:40,767
Movie Channel

617
01:09:04,034 --> 01:09:05,240
Hi Karthik brother!

618
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:14,737
For undertaking my mistake.

619
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,875
Riya, your marriage
got fixed is it not?

620
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,077
Yesterday Mathews uncle
and aunty had come home.

621
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:38,944
Karthik did you like the girl?

622
01:09:40,867 --> 01:09:42,642
Had heard that in the office.

623
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,972
What is that girl doing?

624
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:55,107
A chef at the star hotel in U.K.

625
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,176
So for Karthik from now
on can take tasty food.

626
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:04,714
Why not that girl try in
some star hotels out here?

627
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,441
In that case Sharavanan will have
to stay there all alone is it not?

628
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,341
I have a cousin Sharavanan
I went to see the girl for him.

629
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,606
He is also working in U.K.

630
01:10:25,834 --> 01:10:28,371
If my marriage is fixed, it will be
Riya who will be informed first.

631
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:44,145
Why are not attending the phone?

632
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:46,441
Mama when did you call?

633
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,540
It was not Mama who called,
It was Jenson Skariya from France.

634
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,166
Your would be why
can't you talk to him?

635
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,272
The marriage was
fixed over the phone.

636
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:59,474
But he has not heard the
voice of the girl whom...

637
01:10:59,534 --> 01:11:00,569
...he is to marry and he is calling me.

638
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,840
Papa I was having hectic
work at the office.

639
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:06,041
I had told when you come,
immediately will make you call.

640
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:08,838
What's this daughter'?

641
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:16,945
Yourtiredness is not going to
become severe on talking once.

642
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:22,112
Look with great difficulty papa had
found out a 'golden treasure'!

643
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:26,513
If I were old enough I would have
adjusted. Sister don't spoil your chance!

644
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:27,145
Get lost girl!

645
01:11:48,101 --> 01:11:52,015
Papa come here don't stay
gasping! Let them belittle romantic!

646
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:52,772
Come, come I say!

647
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,911
Sister on calling what
did your fiancé ask?

648
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:05,210
Do you want to know?

649
01:12:07,301 --> 01:12:11,613
4 questions 4 answers!
What time will you get up?

650
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:12,770
6 o'clock.

651
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:14,413
Which is the favorite food?

652
01:12:14,734 --> 01:12:15,678
Noodles.

653
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:17,304
What is the size of the slippers?

654
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:18,678
.6.

655
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,804
What time will you sleep?

656
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:24,314
On feeling sleepy. Finished the
guy in France wants to know!

657
01:12:24,367 --> 01:12:27,041
How is it? My would be that
was found out by father.

658
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,838
Sister what is it?

659
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Movie Channel

660
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:53,966
Our company has taken up next an
event which all of you might feel strange.

661
01:12:53,967 --> 01:12:58,967
A Tamil Chettiar affluent families
marriage at Kumbakonam!

662
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:02,866
Before that engagement. See a
company like ours all the pettiness...

663
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:05,347
...in it on undertaking
a marriage function.

664
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:12,480
Not only for Karthik but all of you!

665
01:13:14,034 --> 01:13:16,207
It's a comedy when some of us are
engaged to set the tent and serve...

666
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,110
...the food for the marriage.

667
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,408
But this is an opening!

668
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:23,277
A door which opens
for us to entire south India.

669
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,044
Those who attend that wedding.

670
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:28,136
Mostly all of them
will be lofty business men.

671
01:13:28,234 --> 01:13:34,617
It's a big opportunity for us to enter
in to the cooperate world of India.

672
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:44,470
Will your boy friend whack you?

673
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:46,980
Will have to stay away for
some days along with Karthik.

674
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:50,874
Then what about Sherin's child?

675
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:07,276
That is all just your thought.

676
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,143
Mama I'm not simply saying Sherin
is a lady with not bell and brakes.

677
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,841
Now you and brother Karthik are
enemies then what's your problem...

678
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:16,039
...sister when Sherin loves Karthik?

679
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:17,238
What problem to me?

680
01:14:17,701 --> 01:14:21,376
Nowadays instead of young men
the married men are lured to love.

681
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:22,913
Stop you naughty!

682
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:27,740
She has not married and all 'living
together' with a guy. Got a child also.

683
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:34,043
Daughter let anyone do anything!
So is all the packing over?

684
01:14:35,867 --> 01:14:38,643
Get the permission from
Jenson also. Here!

685
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:45,881
Daughter, there's a photo of his in
the computer which Jenson has send.

686
01:14:45,967 --> 01:14:46,468
Is it?

687
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,535
Mummy hold her.

688
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:54,873
Look sister's hero!

689
01:14:54,967 --> 01:14:58,540
A very familiar face though Karthik
is lost the one fetched is...

690
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:00,045
...not that bad at all!

691
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:01,738
But has got the voice of an old man.

692
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:03,745
That may be because it's
heard over the phone sister.

693
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,073
Have you got the consent to go?

694
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:08,136
Got!

But hadn't told

At last had found you.

sweets which you like the most.

01:21:49,834 --> 01:21:51,905
Where has she gone?

778
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,706
Where has she hidden? Was
saying she wanted to see the uncle.

779
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:02,437
Oh! Uncle!

780
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,078
She is shy!

781
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:14,311
Your girl customarily your
bride don't you remember?

782
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,576
Yes, yes.
Met when she was aged 2.

783
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,774
First food and then talk! Come!

784
01:22:22,967 --> 01:22:32,547
"My uncle, had come to see me"

785
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:42,011
Karthik's favorite curries also two
papadams (an accompaniment) in to it.

786
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,774
Varalakshmi see
what your uncle wants.

787
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:45,608
Okay mother.

788
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:53,843
Enough Varalakshmi.
No need. More than sufficient.

789
01:22:53,901 --> 01:22:56,643
Don't say like that. When
taking food m ust eat well.

790
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:00,143
Enough dear!

791
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:05,576
On hearing that Karthik
is going to come...

792
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:07,044
Varalakshmi was totally confused.

793
01:23:07,134 --> 01:23:10,775
Whether to put green
dress or yellow or red.

794
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:14,314
Then after calling the sister
Sita at Kerala and asked...

795
01:23:14,367 --> 01:23:16,210
...which color does the uncle like?

796
01:23:22,534 --> 01:23:25,242
Karthik which color do you like?

797
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,544
Like all the colors.

798
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:44,248
But I like Riya wearing the orange
dress. At that time I feel a great...

799
01:23:44,301 --> 01:23:45,541
...amount of 'covetousness'
towards you.

800
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:50,544
Why dear without taking food simply
staring at her? Did you like her dress?

801
01:23:51,934 --> 01:23:53,572
Is Brahmin food tasty?

802
01:24:04,934 --> 01:24:05,935
Karthik what is the problem?

803
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,300
How come everyone
got up without taking food?

804
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:08,143
Don't know mother.

805
01:24:10,501 --> 01:24:12,538
Karthi what is it? What
is the problem?

806
01:24:13,367 --> 01:24:15,074
Karthik what is it? Tell what it is.

807
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:18,205
The vehicle which was coming
from Chennai met with an accident.

808
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:21,107
What to do next?

809
01:24:21,201 --> 01:24:23,203
What accident? To whom?
What had happened?

810
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:26,578
The vehicle which came with the
artists met with an accident at Trichy.

811
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:29,240
Or have they sneaked out by
getting some other programs?

812
01:24:29,334 --> 01:24:31,245
From where will we
arrange the performers?

813
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,008
Is that all! Is there any performers
that is not available in our area?

814
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,206
Tell which and what are
all required give the details...

815
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:37,507

over the phone.

816

01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:39,666
Okay.

818
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:41,340
Before that there is a
small function at the temple.

819
01:24:41,467 --> 01:24:42,266
Then what about Kolam?

820
01:24:42,267 --> 01:24:43,245
(Drawing designs on the floor by
Brahmin women with rice flour)

821
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:45,813
Why such a big concern over
Kolam this Varalakshmi has got a big...

822
01:24:45,901 --> 01:24:48,347
...team of people who can put
the Kolam all over the temple...

823
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:48,878
...is that enough?

824
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,305
Do it properly here I will go there
and see what is going on there.

825
01:25:18,067 --> 01:25:19,705
Varalakshmi finish it fast.

826
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,801
Okay father's brother.

827
01:25:20,934 --> 01:25:25,212
Do it fast why simply wasting time?
Why are you all like this?

828
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:42,276
Uncle shall I teach you how
to draw Kolam?

829
01:25:43,367 --> 01:25:44,573

01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,376

837
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:04,749
You had loved a girl is it not?
Who is she among those two?

838
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:07,112
Who told you like that?

839
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,374
Grandmother, Sita and had
told that now it's not there.

840
01:26:09,434 --> 01:26:10,378
That is all silly!

841
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,944

had become close is it not?

842

Will tell this to the bride.

875
01:30:58,534 --> 01:30:59,808
This marriage will
end up in a problem.

876
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:01,312
Let it be so. Even then
it doesn't matter.

877
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:01,845
For what?

878
01:31:03,734 --> 01:31:05,509

It's the life of a girl only other
another girl will understand that.

883
01:31:16,467 --> 01:31:18,344
Shouldn't be selfish in this matter.

884
01:31:19,367 --> 01:31:20,903
I'm going to tell that to that girl!

885

From when onwards?

889
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:47,413

taken place in a decent manner'?

being conducted by saying lies?

you lady commission chair person?

897

Riya met at Ooty on an emotion...

happened like that.

Can you come with
me for shopping?

904

I was about to say that
you give the resignation.

912
01:38:59,134 --> 01:39:01,944
Father was more obstinate
that I should work there.

913
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,239
At that time Papa had an aim.

914

Friday Jenson and parents
are coming to see you.

After that formal meeting between
you two can fix the engagement.

916

A small function by calling
up very close relatives only.

Rita take that phone.

Sister call from the office Sherin's
scooter met with an accident.

920

Sherin told didn't get
sister on calling you.

921
01:39:51,567 --> 01:39:53,171
Admitted at the city hospital.

922

Whatever it may be don't go now.

926
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:05,610
You are a girl whose marriage is
fixed. You can't behave as you like.

927
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:09,978
Susan it's her Colleague is it not?
Let her go and see and come back.

928
01:40:10,567 --> 01:40:12,103
Spoil the child by lulling!

01:40:37,467 --> 01:40:38,912
One more!

930
01:40:44,967 --> 01:40:47,038
So that is it, never saw a person
who is lying here is it not?

931
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,242
My scooter just got slipped Karthik
went home at that time itself.

932
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:53,075
It was on my fore head
had to put two stitches.

933
01:41:05,634 --> 01:41:09,548
There is no relationship between
me and Karthik as you think.

934
01:41:11,967 --> 01:41:16,143
But as you two were hailing from the
same place behaving indifferently.

935
01:41:17,734 --> 01:41:19,008
You people had some..

936
01:41:21,068 --> 01:41:21,842
Is it not Romex?

937
01:41:33,634 --> 01:41:35,580
Papa must go to Karthik's place.

938
01:41:40,067 --> 01:41:43,014
All this time I have
heard what daughter says.

939
01:41:43,067 --> 01:41:46,640
From now on daughter
must hear what papa says.

940
01:41:48,534 --> 01:41:51,276
Till the marriage gets over
who and all you will see and...

941
01:41:51,367 --> 01:41:54,246
...not seen will be decided by papa.

942
01:42:01,034 --> 01:42:03,139
Careful boy seems like
will break the fingers.

943
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:04,577
Here mother.

944
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:07,247
Your uncle had
called today also asked...

945
01:42:07,334 --> 01:42:08,836
...whether you liked
Varalakshmi or not?

946
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:16,181
Mother she is only a young child.
Tell uncle to educate her well.

947
01:42:17,134 --> 01:42:19,637
A good girl will definitely come
as a daughter in law for mother.

948
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:24,445
Why are you burning your head now
thinking about that? Is it not grandma.

949
01:42:29,867 --> 01:42:31,744
Grand ma.
What is it deal'?

950
01:42:31,867 --> 01:42:34,108
Have you and grand pa quarreled?

951
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:40,378
Always quarrel. At one
time did not talk for 3 days!

952
01:42:43,834 --> 01:42:44,869
After that.

953
01:42:44,934 --> 01:42:50,407
How can your grand pa
remain without talking to me?

954
01:42:52,334 --> 01:42:53,540
You smarty!
Go man!

955
01:42:55,767 --> 01:42:57,644
How did your love start?

956
01:42:57,767 --> 01:43:00,941
At that time there was nothing
sort of I love you and all.

957
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:04,140
Grand pa was real naughty!

958
01:43:18,134 --> 01:43:18,908
Go man!

959
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:24,541
On the way while going
will see each other.

960
01:43:24,601 --> 01:43:29,141
Don't know why can't
resist without looking.

961
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:38,305
At Kumbakonam there was a place
where we always used to meet.

962
01:43:38,734 --> 01:43:43,979
Once while sitting there,
your grand pa, my hands were..

963
01:43:46,767 --> 01:43:49,304
I remained with out
letting out the breath.

964
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,442
What had happened?

965
01:44:08,567 --> 01:44:09,978
Can't let out the breath!

966
01:44:12,467 --> 01:44:13,172
Why?

967
01:44:14,567 --> 01:44:18,208
Can't you understand?
Fool that's the real love!

968
01:44:18,267 --> 01:44:19,871
What happened?

969
01:44:23,367 --> 01:44:26,246

Won't you come?

973
01:45:24,634 --> 01:45:25,772
Is the tourism course over?

974
01:45:26,067 --> 01:45:26,909
Left that.

975
01:45:27,734 --> 01:45:29,577
Now undergoing fashion
designing at Coimbatore.

976
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:33,281
Tourism, fashion designing
no connection at all.

977
01:45:36,734 --> 01:45:38,475
Management? Then Engineering?

978
01:46:06,467 --> 01:46:09,505
I must leave. Came without
informing the parents.

979
01:46:09,634 --> 01:46:11,011
Then go!

980
01:46:12,967 --> 01:46:14,605
Don't you have any
thing else to say?

981
01:46:16,067 --> 01:46:17,512
Had several things to say.

982
01:46:22,267 --> 01:46:24,941
Must tell what is there to say at the
right time. You don't know that.

983
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,707
Certain things must be
understood without saying.

984

I don't posses any
mystic powers for that.

985

On getting a better life...

986
01:46:29,968 --> 01:46:32,175
...can pretend those things
understood as un known.

987
01:46:33,234 --> 01:46:37,239
If it were to avoid me completely
why did you follow me all these days?

988
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,573
Me..Never!

989
01:46:40,167 --> 01:46:42,204
At the office while I was
grooming the models...

990
01:46:42,267 --> 01:46:43,541
...when I was interacting with Sherin.

991
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:47,171
Why not? While I was talking to
Varalakshmi at Kumbakonam!

992
01:46:47,834 --> 01:46:49,871
That is all Karthik's mere thought!

993
01:46:50,367 --> 01:46:52,404
There is always a childish
ego inside you.

994
01:46:53,267 --> 01:46:54,575
You also have that ego!

995
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:59,405
You agreed on the marriage with the
Jenson out of obstinacy towards me.

996
01:47:02,467 --> 01:47:04,140
I don't posses any obstinacy
towards anyone.

997
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:10,344
What was in between us was it
hatred? It was only love!

998
01:47:10,434 --> 01:47:13,040
Then why did you hide it from me?
Can't you say that?

999
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:20,648
Was prepared to say that at that
time uncle and aunty came to...

1000
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,270
...my house on deciding your marriage.

1001
01:47:24,901 --> 01:47:28,974
Then on looking"
Then why should I say my love?

1002
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,179
Then we can reveal
everything to parents.

1003
01:47:37,234 --> 01:47:38,713
Karthik I don't have the guts for that.

1004
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,572
Must possess the guts!

1005
01:47:44,001 --> 01:47:48,450
On the day of fixation what you are
going to say to Jenson will be no!

1006
01:48:01,167 --> 01:48:02,805
It was here we first met each other.

1007
01:48:04,734 --> 01:48:07,544
It was here when we came
to know we weren't just friends.

1008
01:48:09,467 --> 01:48:11,310
May be it will be here we depart!

1009

This place will have
lot to say about us.

01:53:47,034 --> 01:53:51,642
"I have seen you my lover"

1038
01:53:51,801 --> 01:53:57,251
"Was waiting for him till now"

1039
01:53:59,501 --> 01:54:04,501
Movie Channel

1040
01:55:12,667 --> 01:55:15,614
Avaracha! Why did you
stop the boat?

1041
01:55:16,468 --> 01:55:17,674
Good!

1042
01:55:22,301 --> 01:55:26,875
I had expected you will do the same.

1043
01:55:28,634 --> 01:55:34,585
Daughter you had defeated me
once again you had cheated me.

1044
01:55:34,734 --> 01:55:36,680
Avira didn't do that!

1045
01:55:38,567 --> 01:55:41,605
Avira sail the boat to the shore!

1046
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:50,741
Whenever on asking about Karthik
you had told me that you had hated him...

1047
01:55:50,867 --> 01:55:52,437
...that's what you told me.

1048
01:55:53,234 --> 01:55:56,681
Karthi I never expected
Karthi will do this.

1049
01:56:48,267 --> 01:56:50,645
Didn't you used to say
that father is a best friend?

1050
01:56:50,867 --> 01:56:53,211
You could have told
me at least Karthi.

1051
01:56:54,934 --> 01:56:58,575
From now on everything will take
place as we have decided.

1052
01:56:58,767 --> 01:57:02,544
You will marry the
boy whom I have fixed.

1053
01:57:07,767 --> 01:57:08,939
Not possible!

1054
01:57:09,734 --> 01:57:11,179
It was not like the
previous eloping on that day...

1055
01:57:11,934 --> 01:57:13,470
...it was decided after
several thoughts.

1056
01:57:15,801 --> 01:57:16,836
Again we will never depart!

1057
01:57:17,434 --> 01:57:21,678
So that means what we
have done so far is futile!

1058
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:23,141
Is it not Karthik?

1059
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:24,770
Uncle if you want you
can take her now...

1060
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:28,279
...but she will not permit to
marry another person.

1061
01:57:29,168 --> 01:57:30,476
I have that firm belief!

1062
01:57:32,867 --> 01:57:37,338
Good! Karthi you will never
understand a father's heart!

1063
01:57:38,867 --> 01:57:42,815
What was there between
us was merely an ego!

1064
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:45,779
Enough! Don't be smart like
that by out beating the parents!

1065
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,613
Here take a look at her
engagement invitation!

1066
01:57:58,867 --> 01:58:00,039
Read it and see!

1067
01:58:14,801 --> 01:58:15,438
Here!

1068
01:58:40,067 --> 01:58:41,842
You guys decide the date.

1069
01:58:42,501 --> 01:58:44,674
It was I and Mathews
who first understood that...

1070
01:58:44,734 --> 01:58:47,772
...you people never can depart!

1071
01:58:57,434 --> 01:59:02,884
It was a flake marriage planned
by us to bring the love outside...

1072
01:59:02,967 --> 01:59:04,173
...which was inside you.

1073
01:59:07,101 --> 01:59:07,636
Yes.

1074
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:10,143
Have you planned all this?

1075
01:59:10,268 --> 01:59:13,374
In this play which was not known
to your mothers there is one more...

1076
01:59:13,467 --> 01:59:14,775
...person who had helped you.

1077
01:59:17,067 --> 01:59:19,673
Your Skariya uncle at France.

1078
01:59:23,134 --> 01:59:25,512
Actually whose idea was it?
Is it father's or uncle's?

1079
01:59:25,601 --> 01:59:26,773
Both of them!

1080
01:59:28,834 --> 01:59:29,869
Sir surely I will manage.

1081
01:59:36,167 --> 01:59:37,737
Chettiarfrom Kumbakonam
is calling the girl...

1082
01:59:37,834 --> 01:59:39,836
...who saved his
daughter's life on that day.

1083
01:59:39,967 --> 01:59:42,447
That same lady must again
directly come and conduct...

1084
01:59:42,534 --> 01:59:43,444
...the marriage of his daughter.

1085
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:46,936
Both of them are not
picking up the phone.

1086
01:59:48,034 --> 01:59:50,207
<i>Sheri“ this is a door'.!</i>

1087
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:58,911
Riyal had told a lie to you!

1088
02:01:02,134 --> 02:01:04,671
On that day at Ooty..Your bangles!

1089
02:01:07,634 --> 02:01:10,877
"In the eyes..Looked in to the eyes"

1090
02:01:11,367 --> 02:01:14,837
"In the ears..Uttered in the ears"

1091
02:01:14,967 --> 02:01:17,166
"How much I liked"

1092
02:01:17,167 --> 02:01:20,239
"How much I liked"

1093
02:01:20,367 --> 02:01:23,678
"Just hymned a poetry of love"

1094
02:01:24,334 --> 02:01:27,838
"Just swinged in the
unending dreams"

1095
02:01:27,934 --> 02:01:30,312
"How much I liked"

1096
02:01:32,768 --> 02:01:37,217
"Like a kite wafted in the wind"

1097
02:01:37,301 --> 02:01:40,942
"Without limits
swimmed in the winds"

1098
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,881
"Like a kite wafted in the wind"

1099
02:01:45,967 --> 02:01:49,847
"Without limits
swimmed in the winds"

1100
02:01:52,334 --> 02:01:54,507
"Without anyone noticing"

1101
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:57,809
"In the eyes..Looked in to the eyes"

1102
02:01:58,534 --> 02:02:01,947
"In the ears..Uttered in the ears"

1103
02:02:02,067 --> 02:02:07,039
"How much I liked"
