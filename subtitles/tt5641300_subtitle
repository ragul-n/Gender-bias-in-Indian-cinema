1
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,410
What did the lawyer say?

2
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,540
He is asking for
another thirty thousand.

3
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,960
But we have already
paid his fees.

4
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,960
He said he spent it on our case.
I am not sure how true that is.

5
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,540
Don't drop your
food on the floor.

6
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,840
Why don't you come with me?

7
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,500
He missed you
on my last visit.

8
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,770
No.

9
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,260
You carry on.

10
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,010
Do you have enough
money for the bus?

11
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,630
Sarsu's husband is going
that way; I'll go in his rickshaw.

12
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,960
What a mess!

13
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,300
Wash your hands properly.

14
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,420
And don't roam
around in the sun.

15
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,250
Come back soon.

16
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,790
Don't pick a
fight with anyone.

17
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,170
Are you even listening to me?

18
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,710
Did you hear me?

19
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,810
You leaking tank!

20
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,670
You pee in your bed every
night and hide your dirty pants!

21
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,750
Where will you go?

22
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,320
Hey, wait for me.

23
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,130
I'll deal with you when you're
back home, you leaking tank.

24
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,250
I'll make you sleep
on the roof tonight.

25
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,380
Pee all you want up there.

26
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,880
Your idea was a total flop.

27
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
You should have hidden
your pants on the roof.

28
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
She would have
never found it there. -Shut up.

29
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,590
You sneak rice
from home everyday.

30
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,960
Should I tell Mummy?

31
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,500
Sure, go tell her.
Leaking tank.

32
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,360
All grown up but you
still wet your pants.

33
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,460
Shut up and hurry up.

34
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,590
Run... run.

35
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,670
Two more runs.

36
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey, 'Crow Eggs'.
Come play with us.

37
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,210
Caw...caw...caw...caw...caw...caw.

38
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,590
Any eggs in there?

39
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,280
Yes.

40
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,630
How many?

41
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,920
Three!

42
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,840
Get them all.

43
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,840
No. Let's divide them equally.

44
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,210
One for you, one for
me and one for the crow.

45
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,250
Ok.

46
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,800
Bhai... I don't think Nana
will come now. Let's leave.

47
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,260
Are you going on a 'hot date'?

48
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,210
No.

49
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,490
Then shut up and stay put.

50
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,000
Nana is here!

51
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,420
Hurry up.

52
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,670
Good morning.
Hello Nana … How are you?

53
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,920
Namaste Nana

54
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,250
Hey Pokya, how is it going?

55
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,920
Fine Sir.

56
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,630
Chillar?

57
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,750
Sir these boys are
from our neighbourhood.

58
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,420
Hello Nana ...

59
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,800
They run the cable network.

60
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,900
If you want to run an advertisement
for your store, just tell them.

61
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,250
They will get it done.

62
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,670
They are useless Nana.
Good for nothing.

63
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,740
Keep quiet.
- Sir,

64
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,590
this hardly looks like
ten thousand square feet.

65
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,630
Yes it is… you can
check the documents sir.

66
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,920
Documents can
be easily forged.

67
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,050
Look at our Vashi plot
documents, Sir got it forged.

68
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,980
Sorry Sir.

69
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,880
Come on kids ... Let's go.

70
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Hurry up!

71
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,130
Sir, our documents are clear.

72
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,880
It's very hard to find such
an open, clear plot in Mumbai.

73
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,950
You are quite lucky
to have found this one.

74
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,000
Ask Papa for a mobile.

75
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,090
Why should I?
Ask him yourself.

76
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,420
Why are you telling
me to ask him?

77
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,550
Don't you want one?

78
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,250
Oh yeah! As if you would
let me play games on it.

79
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,000
Of course I will. Trust me.
But you ask Papa for it.

80
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,180
You ate a crow's egg,
didn't you?

81
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,800
No.

82
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,090
Wait here. He will come.

83
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,400
How are you?

84
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,270
Are you taking your
medication on time?

85
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,140
You don't seem
too well yourself.

86
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,850
I am fine.

87
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,770
How is mother?

88
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,140
She is fine.

89
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,930
She wanted to come along,
but I asked her not to.

90
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,720
Are the kids here?

91
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,600
Yes, downstairs.

92
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,470
They aren't letting
the kids in.

93
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,810
It's them isn't it?

94
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,100
Yes.

95
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,600
Hey, Boys!

96
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,720
That is Papa's voice.

97
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,020
What are you doing there?

98
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,810
We are playing with a cat.

99
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,810
They are playing...

100
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,930
Hey! What do you
think you are doing?

101
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,310
This is a police station.

102
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,470
Sir ... They are my kids.

103
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
So, What's the big deal?

104
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,060
Don't shout out
to them from here.

105
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,560
Papa, when will you
get us a mobile phone?

106
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,600
Bloody brats... Bhandare
tell them to shut up.

107
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,390
Shinde, shut those kids up!

108
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,020
Do they go to school?

109
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,810
How did your father
land up in jail?

110
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,690
I don't know.

111
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,890
Why do they call
you 'tutti frutti'?

112
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,720
As a child I used to
work at a paan stall.

113
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,290
I used to eat all the 'tutti frutti'
instead of putting it in the paan.

114
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,950
One day the owner thrashed me.

115
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,830
Since then everyone
calls me 'tutti frutti'.

116
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,450
Have you got 'tutti
frutti' for lunch too?

117
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,410
No, bread and vegetables.

118
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,080
Want to eat some?

119
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,410
No. Yuck.

120
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,990
My name is 'Crow Egg'.

121
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,120
Wow!

122
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,200
'Crow Egg'... 'Tutti Frutti'.

123
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,990
I'm "Little Crow Egg".
He's "Big Crow Egg".

124
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,870
Just shut up or
else I'll tell mummy.

125
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,700
Amazing!

126
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,790
What is in it?

127
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,570
Coal.

128
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,720
What?

129
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,240
Train coal... we pick
it from the tracks everyday.

130
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,490
Oh, coal!

131
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,580
But what do you do with it?

132
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,990
We sell it.

133
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,620
Three rupees a kilo.

134
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,870
Sarang!

135
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,860
Whom are you talking to?
Time up! Let's go!

136
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,040
Ok. Bye.

137
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,160
Bye.

138
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,410
Five kilos.

139
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,430
It is right.

140
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,410
Here.

141
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,480
Go get cake from Aunty.

142
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,700
Kesha Darling!
... How are you dude?

143
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,410
You buggers. Where
did you get this from?

144
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,580
None of your business.

145
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,740
Just weigh it and
give us the money.

146
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,870
This will bring the
municipality to my door.

147
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,580
Kesha don't worry,
we'll take care of it.

148
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,460
Idiot, will you be
here if they come for me?

149
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,960
Of course! Tell him.

150
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,830
We have a lot of
clout with the cops.

151
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,790
You know the cops?

152
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,580
Yeah.

153
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,460
Did they invite him to
inaugurate the new lock up?

154
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,040
Don't bring
such stuff to me anymore.

155
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,620
Kesha Darling ... give
us the money and just chill.

156
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,460
Come in the evening...
let's have 'little-little'.

157
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,550
Have some cake.

158
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,000
Aunty, can I have this watch?

159
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,330
Yes, take it.

160
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,250
Mummy when will we buy a TV?

161
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,830
We'll get one only when
you stop peeing in your pants.

162
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,120
Why do you keep
nagging him about it?

163
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,570
He'll stop when he grows up.

164
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
How much did you get today?

165
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,830
Fifteen rupees.

166
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,710
Mummy tell Papa
to give us a mobile.

167
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,500
Once Papa is free, he'll
get you one, sweetheart.

168
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,220
Ever since your visit to the
jail you look quite upset.

169
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,270
What is the matter?

170
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,100
He has lost so much
weight. I am worried.

171
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,890
Oh you're worried about him!

172
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,390
Shouldn't you be mad at him?

173
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,220
He landed himself in jail.

174
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,310
What is the point
in getting mad?

175
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,140
I must get him out of jail.

176
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,720
Tell me if you know a
way to get him out.

177
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:41,810
Go meet Chamdi. He is
Nana's man but what a lech!

178
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,560
Nana is a busy man.

179
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,180
You think he'll see you just
because you are here?

180
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,720
Mangya!

181
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,060
Is that your brother?

182
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,640
Hey! Nana is calling you.
Can't you hear him?

183
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,890
Yes Ma'am.

184
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,640
Wait here, I'll be back.

185
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,100
Careful you idiot.

186
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,640
I have to manage the
entire neighbourhood.

187
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,060
All thanks to me, or else they'll bring
your shop down in a single night.

188
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,680
Give it to him.

189
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,890
Keep it inside.

190
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,390
Is that all of it?

191
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,470
These are four bundles.

192
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,390
Mr. Mujumdar, the boys tell me that your
shop has many branches across Mumbai?

193
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,790
Not just Mumbai, we have
branches in Pune, Satara, Navi Mumbai, Thane...

194
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,830
I guess you must be making at least
twenty million every month!

195
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,370
Twenty... huh... It's forty just
in Mumbai... and in Thane...

196
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,660
This is our man.

197
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,950
Get the tea.

198
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,690
What are they doing?

199
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,290
Cheering.

200
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,870
It's coming down.

201
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,160
Cheering.

202
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,450
Grandma... you know the
whole tree fell down!

203
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,540
In a minute!

204
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,080
Never mind that tree. Remember there
is another one near the temple!

205
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,870
It is huge. The crow
will go to that tree.

206
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,700
They chopped
that one long ago.

207
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,660
They have put up Nana's
statue over there.

208
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,330
The crow doesn't lay
eggs over there.....

209
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,410
... and when the crow
lays eggs, you steal them!

210
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,790
They eat crow eggs; I can't hear
enough of it from Sarsu.

211
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,370
The whole neighbourhood talks about
it, but these brats are shameless.

212
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,700
Let them have it.

213
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,870
Can we afford to give
them chicken eggs?

214
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,160
Let them have it ...
It'll help them grow.

215
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,490
Doesn't matter if the crow is
black... after all it's a bird.

216
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,700
It'll give the children
strength to fly!

217
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,790
Don't defend them.

218
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,290
If I ever catch you eating crow eggs
again, I am going to thrash both of you.

219
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,370
And you ... are you done?

220
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,770
No, not yet.

221
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:31,520
I slogged so hard for this deal...
but Nana doesn't care.

222
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,220
Why does this always
happen to you Bhai?

223
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,890
Why Bhai why?

224
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:47,350
(Reciting poetry)

225
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,470
Bloody poet!

226
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,640
Mummy... what is that?

227
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,970
You wanted a TV didn't you?

228
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,390
TV! Awesome!

229
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,560
Mummy, you said you'll get a TV
only if he stops peeing in his pants.

230
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,680
I got it in a lucky draw.

231
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,850
You should've got
a mobile instead.

232
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,100
During the elections they will
distribute mobile phones and sim cards.

233
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,020
You'll get one then.

234
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,220
Till then watch TV.

235
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,430
It's mine, I won't let him.
- Shut up.

236
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,020
'Wet-pants'.
- Go get the cable guy.

237
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,430
Grandma...
mummy has brought a TV.

238
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,600
Cheering

239
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,020
Didn't I tell you about
the lucky draw?

240
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,520
Sarsu got a mixer.

241
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,610
Pull!

242
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,280
Let it loose.

243
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,980
Mummy do you know why
everyone has a belly button?

244
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,400
Why?

245
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,570
The baby comes out
of the belly button.

246
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,980
Who tells you all this?

247
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,150
Tutti frutti!

248
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,280
Tutti frutti?

249
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,940
He is my friend.

250
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,610
He is tutti frutti and
I am Crow Egg.

251
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,730
Crow Egg?

252
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,940
Yes. My name is Crow Egg.

253
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
He is Big Crow Egg and
I'm Little Crow Egg.

254
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,780
Useless... don't run away.

255
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,940
Look. I have a watch.
Just like yours.

256
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,980
This is a toy watch.

257
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,070
Look this one is an original.

258
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,230
You think wearing a watch
will make you a big shot!

259
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,780
Yes it will. Wait and watch.

260
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,960
Mummy... There he goes again.

261
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,880
Tell me ... What is your name?

262
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,630
Crow Egg.

263
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,920
Dad bought him.

264
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,090
For how much?

265
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,590
Twenty five thousand!

266
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,290
Mummy you know our
friend Sarang?

267
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,540
He bought a dog for
twenty five thousand!

268
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,290
Its face is like this...

269
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,750
Shall we buy one?

270
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,170
Hey Crow Eggs!

271
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,840
Mummy...
How did Papa land up in jail?

272
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,290
Sir, these film actors
never show up on time.

273
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,340
I have heard that this particular actor
always arrives late to the shooting as well.

274
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,210
Shilwant, will you shut up?

275
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:05,960
Sir!

276
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,880
I have just spoken to Nikhil.

277
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,980
The car will be
here in 5 minutes.

278
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:16,230
But Sir, the auspicious time will be
gone in 5 minutes. It is a bad omen.

279
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,520
Sorry sir.

280
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,520
Where did you find this one?

281
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,480
He is from my wife's town.

282
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,900
Cheering.

283
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,480
Cheering.

284
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,940
Cheering.

285
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Cheering.

286
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:57,020
Cheering.

287
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,820
Grandma.

288
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,320
Hmm...

289
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,270
The pizza comes in a parcel
by plane everyday!

290
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,230
From abroad!

291
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,730
What is it called?

292
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,020
Pizza!

293
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,860
Pizza!

294
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,230
Look pizza!

295
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,320
It looks so tasty!

296
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,690
Must be sweet.

297
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,070
Mummy I want the pizza.

298
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,170
You keep asking for stuff.
Every new thing that you see.

299
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,670
Do you think money
grows on trees?

300
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,210
Don't scold them.
They are just kids.

301
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,120
Please stay out of this.

302
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,710
They have turned
into spoilt brats.

303
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,330
Their mother tries to
save every penny...

304
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,710
...knocks on every door to get
their father out of jail ...

305
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,620
... but do they care?

306
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,170
I want pizza... not Papa.

307
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,830
Did you hear that?

308
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,670
If you say that again... I'll
burn your tongue, mind you!

309
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,460
What is your name?

310
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,920
'Little Crow Egg'

311
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,170
My name is 'Big Crow Egg'.

312
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,920
Hey!

313
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,120
Come here.

314
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,830
Isn't there a shorter route
here to get to the main road?

315
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,450
Is that a pizza?

316
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,500
Yes.

317
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,370
Is there a way to
get to the main road?

318
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,620
Go straight, then turn left, then
right, you'll come to a signal...

319
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,550
Turn left at the signal.

320
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,200
Ok.

321
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,290
Not left...
turn right at the signal.

322
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,000
Turn left.

323
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,910
Your hand is signaling
a right turn.

324
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,200
But there used to
be a shorter route right here.

325
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,660
Show us the pizza and we'll
show you the shorter route.

326
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,080
Just once ... please.

327
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,250
Please.

328
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,500
Pizza!

329
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,290
Now show me the shorter route.

330
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,540
Is that a pizza?

331
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,950
This is what Ankush
Chaudhari eats?

332
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,000
His wife doesn't cook for him?

333
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,870
Have you ever had pizza?

334
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,260
No.

335
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,000
299! ... 300 rupees!
For such a small pizza?

336
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,700
Yes, but we are still
going to eat this pizza.

337
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,500
Mr. Little Crow Egg...
to buy this pizza...

338
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:18,950
See that wagon ... you will have
to collect a wagon full of coal.

339
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,870
We will do it!

340
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,230
Bye!

341
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,200
This is from the new shop.

342
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,910
You must have had pizza.

343
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,250
Yes. Several times.

344
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,830
Look at this... If you call this number,
the pizza gets delivered directly to your house.

345
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,750
At home?

346
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,660
Yes. Home delivery.

347
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,910
Even in our neighbourhood?

348
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,870
Yes why not?

349
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,290
But you have to pay for it.
Once the pizza is delivered.

350
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,830
You have money don't you?

351
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,620
We are going to collect a
wagon full of coal for the pizza.

352
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,870
A full wagon? How much
do you make in a day?

353
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,950
10 rupees.

354
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:16,160
10 rupees... So for
300 rupees ... 30 days!

355
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,500
That is only one month!

356
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,000
Whom are you calling?

357
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,750
The Pizza Shop.

358
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,540
Pizza shop!

359
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,370
How will you pay him?

360
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,040
Remember the pizza
guy who came here?

361
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,790
We'll ask him to deliver
the pizza to our house.

362
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,000
Once he does, we'll ask him to note
it down; we'll pay him in a month.

363
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,290
Hello, good afternoon.
Pizza Café.

364
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,330
We want to have a pizza.

365
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,540
Yes Sir.
Please tell me your address.

366
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,200
Hello are you on the line sir?

367
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,950
Near the Kartik temple.

368
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,830
"Ok ... Go on."

369
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,500
Your building name sir?

370
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,200
Your flat number sir?

371
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,660
Any landmark sir?

372
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,540
Yeah! You can ask anyone, "Which
one is Little Crow Egg's house?"

373
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,410
They'll tell you.
Are you crazy?

374
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,410
Grandma...
What is our address?

375
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:46,250
Lane next to Kartik
temple, Bhimnagar.

376
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,950
Yes that is what we told him.

377
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,160
But he wanted to know more.

378
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,370
Who?

379
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,500
The pizza fellow.

380
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,700
How much is it for?

381
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,450
300 rupees!

382
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,040
Huh! 300 rupees!

383
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,250
So expensive!

384
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,370
We are still going to have it.

385
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,250
Yeah. And you can have some
of your mother's thrashing as well.

386
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,250
If we save money for a month,
we shall have 300 rupees.

387
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,830
Why do you want to
give them the money?

388
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,200
Give it to me.

389
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,200
Take this and get
the things that I tell you.

390
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:43,120
Onions, tomatoes, chillies.

391
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,450
Uncle... Onions,
tomatoes and chillies please.

392
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,910
And some bell peppers too.

393
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,750
Bell peppers! Hurry up please!

394
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,750
Grandma... is it done?

395
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,950
Not yet.

396
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,250
Your pizza is ready!

397
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,810
But this doesn't
smell like pizza.

398
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:29,720
Don't smell your food.
Dogs smell their food not men.

399
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,560
There are no strings in it.

400
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,020
Strings! Rotten food
has strings in it.

401
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,970
You said it would be sweet!

402
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,100
Bread isn't sweet.

403
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,810
Bread! ... yuck.

404
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,140
Do you think we are fools?

405
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,310
We don't want your pizza.

406
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,350
We'll buy our own pizza.
The ‘real' pizza.

407
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,850
Are you sure about this?

408
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,350
Homemade pizza won't do?

409
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,270
This is what you want?

410
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,690
Come, I'll take
you to a treasure.

411
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,770
But you can't tell anyone.

412
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,480
Sure?

413
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,890
Promise me.

414
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,440
Promise!

415
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,600
Promise!

416
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,440
Why didn't you
bring us here before?

417
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,230
You didn't tell me before.

418
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,390
Did you find a
treasure chest of coal?

419
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,060
Hey Eggs!

420
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,520
See you tomorrow ...
we're busy today.

421
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,690
Come on ... hurry up!

422
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,640
Shh. Not so loud.

423
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,580
Are we stealing this coal?

424
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,870
We are just taking our share.

425
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,870
Bonnie and Clyde!
What is with all this coal?

426
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,000
They are making money...
why are you so jealous?

427
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,160
All you do is drink all day.

428
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,600
Tonya.
Here come the Crow Eggs.

429
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,730
Hey Crow Eggs!
Look at my mobile!

430
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,770
You can click photos
and shoot videos!

431
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,690
You said your father is
going to give you a mobile.

432
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,980
Where is your mobile?

433
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,390
We don't want a mobile.

434
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:36,770
We are going to have pizza.

435
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,600
Liar!

436
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,060
You think you're
some kind of a big shot?

437
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,350
Come on.

438
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,020
They are going to have pizza!

439
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:47,440
140 ... 150 ... 225 ...
230 ... 240 ... 300 ... 310.

440
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,560
How much?

441
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,770
310!

442
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,520
What will you do
with all that money?

443
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,810
We're going to eat pizza.

444
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,940
Pizza?

445
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,980
Does your mother know?

446
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,690
Yes she knows.

447
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,140
Come on.

448
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,770
Hey!

449
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,520
Where are you going?

450
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,310
To eat pizza.

451
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,390
Pizza?

452
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,980
There is no pizza here.

453
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,270
Get lost.

454
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,440
Yes there is.

455
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,020
We saw Ankush Chaudhari
eating pizza here.

456
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,980
Hey... 'Ankush Chaudhari!'

457
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,730
Go home.

458
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,980
Security!

459
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:36,600
What is going on?

460
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,730
Nothing Sir. These kids
are from the slums.

461
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,890
They were barging in.

462
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,940
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

463
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,520
Go back. Go home.

464
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,770
He called us 'beggars'.

465
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,190
How did he know we
are from the slums?

466
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,140
Your clothes.

467
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,440
Clothes?

468
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,350
Oh yes.

469
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,520
Your clothes give away
that you live in the slum.

470
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,730
How do you know everything?

471
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,890
Once I gate crashed a wedding.

472
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,980
I thought no one would
notice me in the crowd.

473
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,480
But one look at my clothes and
they knew. I was kicked out.

474
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,020
That is when I realized. A man
is known by the clothes he wears.

475
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:29,510
I ignore the children's needs to
give all the money to the lawyer.

476
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,180
Now he says it's not enough.

477
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,220
Bloody ********

478
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,890
They are nothing
but scavengers.

479
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,470
Never mind.

480
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,310
Why don't you go
to another lawyer?

481
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,810
If we do that then this
lawyer's fees are wasted.

482
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,930
The new lawyer will
ask for more money.

483
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:58,760
When I go visit their father,
his eyes constantly question me.

484
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,390
"When will I be free?"

485
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,470
And this rascal of a lawyer
can't even get him out on bail.

486
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,100
You are doing this
all by yourself.

487
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,600
I am sorry that I cannot
help you in your hardship.

488
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,430
I am of no use
to anyone anymore.

489
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,260
Mother, that is not true.

490
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,060
I am able to do everything only because
I know you'll take care of the children.

491
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,010
What would happen to
our home if not for you?

492
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,810
Grandma, we had been
to the pizza shop today.

493
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,680
But they didn't let us in.

494
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,350
Tutti frutti said it's because
of our clothes... Is it true?

495
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,850
Yes my dear. It is true.

496
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:03,260
Those who wear dazzling
clothes are rich...

497
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,600
And the ones in dirty
clothes are paupers.

498
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,100
But we had money
for the pizza.

499
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,340
What?

500
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,020
He won't come today. Let's go.

501
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,810
Hey Eggs! Wait up!

502
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,730
Sorry I am late.

503
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,690
But look what
I have got for you!

504
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,060
Abracadabra!

505
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,060
Pizza!

506
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,270
Have it.

507
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:57,190
Didn't you want to have pizza?

508
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,400
I have brought this
specially for you.

509
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,770
No thanks.
We'll buy our own pizza.

510
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:07,520
But... have it!
I have got it for you.

511
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,850
Where did you get
these clothes from?

512
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,900
From the mall.

513
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:13,810
Which mall?

514
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,020
City Centre Mall. M.G. Road.

515
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,940
City Centre Mall. M.G. Road.

516
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,600
Come on.

517
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,690
City Centre, M.G.
Road… City Centre, M.G. Road.

518
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,440
Why didn't you
let me eat the pizza?

519
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,980
We'll buy it with
our own money.

520
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,670
Where is Tutti frutti?

521
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,580
Who?

522
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,630
The fat guy who
used to work here.

523
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:36,790
He used to steal coal. He is fired.
I don't know where he is now.

524
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,290
What is his name?

525
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,580
Tutti frutti

526
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,460
What a weird name!

527
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,040
Poor Tutti frutti, I
wonder where he is.

528
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,750
He was fired thanks to us.

529
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,790
Now we can't
get any coal here.

530
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,880
Now we can't even
buy the pizza.

531
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,290
Don't you want to have
the pizza like Ankush Chaudhari?

532
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,880
Let's go.

533
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,540
Have you seen my
husband anywhere?

534
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,170
No.

535
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,790
For the past whole week you haven't
been bringing home any money.

536
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,830
Don't you pick
the coal anymore?

537
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,080
No. We play all day.

538
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,670
We are going to see your
father in a couple of days.

539
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,130
I'll tell him
what you are up to.

540
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,210
We don't want to visit Papa.

541
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,630
Why do you say that?

542
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,380
She works so hard.

543
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,040
You must try to help her.

544
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,040
You shut up.

545
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,040
All you do
is sit at home and eat.

546
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,810
Mind your tongue or
you'll get it from me.

547
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,480
You should have taken
Sarang's pizza.

548
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,350
He had already
eaten half of it.

549
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,560
You want his leftover pizza?

550
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,770
Singing to himself.

551
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,190
Aunty!

552
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,730
What is it?

553
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,980
He is drunk.

554
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,520
Let's go.

555
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,850
Wait.

556
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,730
He is going to die drinking.

557
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,690
Here. Both of
you have some cake.

558
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,480
Is that how you talk
to a customer?

559
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,850
What about 'customer care'?

560
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,100
Get lost you drunk.

561
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,730
Uncle, where is your home?

562
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,730
Why?

563
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,600
Give us 10 rupees
we'll take you home.

564
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,090
How many rounds was it?

565
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,760
5.

566
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,470
Don't touch the car.

567
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:32,720
Done!

568
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,180
Two days makes it 20 rupees.

569
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,390
410. Another 100 and we
shall buy us some new clothes.

570
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
Ok?

571
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,840
Ok ok.

572
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,090
Let's sell Tommy!

573
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,640
Dog for sale!

574
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,050
Sir, would you
like to buy a puppy?

575
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,470
You guys have begun selling
dogs at signals now!

576
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,430
How much?

577
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,640
25 thousand.

578
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,590
How much?

579
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,550
25 thousand.

580
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,050
What a scam... get lost!

581
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,640
Brother, this one won't work.

582
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,590
Why not?

583
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,970
It is torn.

584
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,680
Never mind, it's fine.

585
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,760
Hey fatty... hurry up.

586
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,390
Shut up skinny freak.

587
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,220
Tonya look at them.

588
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,680
Hey Crow Eggs!

589
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,470
Did you have the pizza?

590
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:31,200
430 … 440 … 450 … 460 …
470 … 480... 490 … 500 … 510.

591
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:32,950
How much is it?

592
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:34,570
520.

593
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,610
We have enough money now!

594
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,320
Ticket!

595
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:17,450
Where are you going?

596
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:18,860
To shop for new clothes!

597
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,240
Sir of course you are!

598
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,360
But where exactly
are you going?

599
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,740
City Centre... M.G. Road.

600
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,610
2 'half tickets'.

601
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,530
City Centre!

602
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,570
Sir, City Centre Mall?

603
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,030
Here it is.

604
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,820
Whoa!

605
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,860
They are never going
to let us in there.

606
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,240
Do you like your new clothes?

607
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,660
Yes..

608
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,320
Dad… panipuri!

609
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:19,740
Dad... panipuri!

610
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:22,740
No my dear. It's not hygienic.

611
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,450
It'll make you sick.

612
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,570
You never give us
what we really want.

613
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,280
Don't say that. Look we bought
such lovely clothes for you.

614
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,200
We have spent 4 thousand
rupees on them.

615
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,110
But we never asked
for new clothes.

616
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,700
Let's go home. I'll ask mummy to
make some instant noodles for you.

617
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,240
No. I want to have paanipuri.

618
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,820
No you won't get it.

619
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:45,070
Let me call your mother, we
are leaving immediately...

620
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,860
My mobile!

621
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,700
Stay here. I'll be right back.

622
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,950
Do you want to have paanipuri?

623
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,440
Do you like them?

624
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:28,740
They are awesome!

625
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:36,860
Did you just throw them out?

626
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,990
Yes!

627
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,730
"I'll have a word
with him... yes"

628
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,440
Didn't I tell you not to
have this paanipuri!

629
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:49,560
Where are your bags?

630
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,690
We sold them.

631
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:52,400
Sold them?

632
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,100
Cheering.

633
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,060
Hey! Where do you
think you're going?

634
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,810
Didn't I tell you
not to come here?

635
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,020
Get lost!

636
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,520
But look ...
We have new clothes.

637
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,150
So you think new clothes
will let you in?

638
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,560
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

639
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:28,770
Security!

640
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,270
What is the matter?

641
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,440
What do they want?

642
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,100
Sir these kids are from the
slum ... they keep coming back.

643
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,940
What is your problem?

644
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:39,900
We haven't done anything.

645
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:40,900
So?

646
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,270
We are here to have pizza.

647
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,690
But this bugger ...
he is abusing us.

648
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,520
How dare you abuse? Next time I
see you here I'll break your bones.

649
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,020
Bloody beggars.

650
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,270
Go beg on the streets.

651
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,270
I better not see
you here again.

652
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:03,650
Get lost.

653
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,310
Beggars.
You dare not come back.

654
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,650
Pizza is not for you.

655
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,560
Get lost.

656
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,690
Brother, let's leave.

657
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,730
She is no more!

658
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:09,680
This won't even buy the wood.

659
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,470
This is all I have.

660
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,810
You don't even have enough
money for the funeral?

661
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,060
Ok. This will do.

662
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,430
Come on.

663
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,390
Tell me the truth.

664
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,680
Where did you
get so much money?

665
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:42,350
We were'nt playing all these
days. We were selling coal.

666
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,890
We found a whole lot of coal.

667
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,720
We sold it and
bought these clothes.

668
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,930
Chanting

669
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,850
Hey Crow Eggs!

670
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,850
Want some more pizza?

671
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:55,470
What was that about?

672
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,390
Both of them went
to have pizza yesterday.

673
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,010
They got beaten up instead.

674
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:00,850
Where?

675
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:04,010
At the new pizza shop.

676
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,510
They were beaten?

677
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,810
Yeah! It was so funny!

678
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,260
Who beat them?

679
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:13,100
The pizza guy.

680
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,430
Why?

681
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:16,850
Of course they'll get thrashed
if they ask for free pizza.

682
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,220
No. They had money.
They even wore new clothes.

683
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,930
But still that guy hit them.

684
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,220
Here.

685
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:26,010
What is it?

686
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,350
Just take a look at this.

687
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,740
Fine. Go home.

688
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:50,910
Come back tomorrow
for your mobile.

689
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,660
It's my father's mobile.
He'll yell at me.

690
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:57,040
Oh Daddy's darling. Get lost.

691
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:59,040
Let's go fatty.

692
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,370
Chillar ... This mobile... it's
going to make us rich ... very rich.

693
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,200
Bhai it's an outdated model.
You won't get anything for this.

694
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:14,330
Forget about the model ...
watch this.

695
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:15,910
What?

696
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:20,830
This.

697
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,790
How will that make us rich?

698
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,200
Idiot ...

699
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,830
But... Bhai...

700
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:32,740
Fool.

701
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:34,540
I'll finish this.

702
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:14,740
What is this?

703
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,990
The kids are from our slum.

704
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:23,800
If this is exposed ... if
the media gets hold of this clip...

705
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,830
We have already discussed
this over the phone.

706
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,410
What do you want?

707
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,120
Well ...
I'll take what you can offer.

708
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:40,790
I'll let you know.

709
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,120
Ok.

710
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:44,370
Bye.

711
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,620
Ok sir.

712
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:56,200
Here. Once you decide,
just give me a call.

713
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,160
Keep it.

714
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:04,330
Ok sir. Bye.

715
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,450
Bhai he has
such a hawk like nose.

716
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,160
Don't worry, this hawk is
going to sing like a canary.

717
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:18,160
Instead of getting involved in it why
don't we just sell the video to Ashok?

718
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:18,790
To Ashok?

719
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,240
Yeah, we can easily
make money out of it.

720
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,330
If we sell it to him,
he'll sell it to the media.

721
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,290
We won't get much out of it.

722
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:29,990
Instead if we cut a deal with the
owner, he'll give us five thousand.

723
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,290
Five thousand!

724
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,040
We'll get 2500 each!

725
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,720
Five thousand is too much,
let's ask for two thousand.

726
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:37,890
Just two thousand?

727
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,390
You fool!
That is way too less.

728
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,010
Just two thousand?

729
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,720
Think big ... don't get
stuck in trivial deals.

730
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:47,640
Sir don't waste any time.
Call him.

731
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,350
Call them!
I am not calling those fools.

732
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,970
Sir they are no fools.
In fact they are quite smart.

733
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:59,060
They have only given
us a copy of that video.

734
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:01,760
If the media gets
hold of this clip...

735
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:05,760
... the human rights activists will cry
ill treatment of slum children..

736
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:08,890
..atrocity even child abuse...

737
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,390
... and force us to shut shop.

738
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,100
In my opinion we should
call Nana Jagdale.

739
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,060
He is their leader.

740
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,970
Nana Jagdale! He is a con man.

741
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:24,600
He'll take our money and still have
the people in the slum at our throats.

742
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,760
Hello who is this?

743
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,010
Shilwant here.

744
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,060
Who?

745
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,350
Shilwant.

746
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,680
Yeah.

747
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:42,930
Who is it?

748
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:45,500
Yes sir.

749
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,420
This is a small matter.

750
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:52,250
Let us not blow it out of
proportion. Name your price.

751
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:56,420
Sure, I have already said I'll
take what you offer.

752
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,590
In that case we'll give you
fifty thousand rupees at the most.

753
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:07,250
Bhai don't ask for 3 thousand.
Just settle for 2.

754
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:13,750
Ok. It's not much
but I'll accept it.

755
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:19,130
Ok. Bring the original
clip and take your money.

756
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:21,590
Ok sir.

757
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:26,250
Sir you are a very lucky man!

758
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,500
What did he say?

759
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:34,710
Idiot. You wanted to ask for just 2
thousand. 3 would be too much huh?

760
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,210
Do you know what
I have settled for?

761
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,320
How much?

762
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,380
4 thousand!

763
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:41,710
4 thousand!

764
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,920
You are the best!

765
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:49,590
These kids are
our lottery ticket!

766
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,550
Mummy! No wet pants today!

767
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,050
Little Crow Egg
is all grown up!

768
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,170
Sorry sir I am late.

769
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,710
Original video?

770
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,920
Sir give me the money
and take your video.

771
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:47,320
You may be smart enough to make money...
but to spend it you need to stay alive.

772
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,480
I better not see
you here again.

773
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:52,270
Of course sir.
This matter is over forever.

774
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,650
Ok sir.

775
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:54,900
Just a minute.

776
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:57,570
Are you sure there is
no other copy of this video?

777
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:02,770
No sir.
I swear. This is all I had.

778
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:06,820
Well known pizza chain - Pizza Café
have recently inaugurated a new branch.

779
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:11,610
A manager from this pizza shop has been caught
on video brutally assaulting two young children.

780
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:14,360
The reason behind it being
they wanted to have pizza.

781
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,070
In fact the children had enough
money to buy their own pizza.

782
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:18,690
The children are from
the neighbourhood slum.

783
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:22,110
This incident has once again
brought to the fore the rift in society.

784
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:26,110
Our news correspondent has captured
this incident on his camera.

785
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,400
Let us take a look at it.

786
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:41,980
Hello.

787
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:44,230
Bhai you have no
idea what I have done!

788
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,070
Forget the pizza shop owner.
How much was he offerring us?

789
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:48,520
4 thousand?

790
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:54,770
You want to know how much Ashok
gave me for that video? 5 thousand!

791
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,320
I am sure it is already on TV.

792
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,940
I got us a much better deal!

793
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,520
Bhai drinks on me tonight!

794
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,610
I am waiting.

795
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:29,650
Why is he late?

796
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,940
Bloody fool!

797
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,980
What is it?
Why are you beating me?

798
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,690
You think you are a smart ass?

799
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:47,400
You can have your 50%

800
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,650
Shove those 50% ....

801
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,400
Do you have any idea
how much they were offering?

802
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,520
How much?

803
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:03,980
How much?

804
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,020
He was ready to
shell out 50 thousand.

805
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,520
50 thousand!

806
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:15,820
What a waste ... they
beat me up instead.

807
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,610
Bhai you were going
to double cross me?

808
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,090
Does it hurt?

809
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:42,050
Yeah. They really went for it.

810
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:56,090
But wait and watch ...
I'll make them pay for it.

811
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,930
Yes of course.

812
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,720
Call for it.

813
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,180
One soft drink
for my friend here!

814
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,890
Soft drink?

815
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:11,800
Well, get a beer.

816
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,800
Two young children
living in a slum.

817
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:22,890
They were barred from entering Pizza
Café in spite of having enough money.

818
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:27,390
In fact the boys were even brutally
thrashed by a Pizza Café manager.

819
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:30,550
Our correspondent tried to speak
to the owner of the pizza café ...

820
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,390
...but he seemed reluctant
to comment on this issue.

821
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:37,840
The identity of both the
kids still remains unknown.

822
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,550
What do you think? Will such kinds
of incidents keep happening in our society?

823
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,590
I condemn this government.

824
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:04,640
We need to look at this incident
with a specific political point of view.

825
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,050
Just a minute Ma'am.
I must interrupt you.

826
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,340
We are taking a break here. But don't go
anywhere and keep watching News 21.

827
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:14,430
Our topic of discussion
is Pizza vs. Bhakri.

828
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,930
Send in your views
at #pizzavsbhakri

829
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:24,050
Brother,
let us earn a lot of money.

830
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,390
We'll give it all to mummy.

831
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:28,510
It'll help Papa
come out of jail.

832
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:34,800
Thousands of families live in these slums
that are completely ignored by our society.

833
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:40,430
Hundreds of children from these families
work on daily wages to help run their houses.

834
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,550
The two innocent children
are from one such family.

835
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:47,550
Their only crime is their desire to eat a
pizza which is a symbol of a lavish lifestyle.

836
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:53,510
The dreams of many such children are crushed
before they blossom. When will this end?

837
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,590
With Cameraman Rakesh, I am
Gayatri Bapat for ABP Majha.

838
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,090
We must do something.

839
01:28:58,390 --> 01:29:00,470
They have attacked these
children from our community.

840
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,890
I raised my voice
to get justice.

841
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,300
But they beat me up.

842
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:05,510
You went asking for justice?

843
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,430
Yes he went by himself.

844
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:11,180
But look what they did to him.

845
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,180
Do as I say.

846
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,430
Gather all the women from
the neighbourhood. Right now.

847
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,140
We'll march to their doors.

848
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,390
You are right Nana.

849
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:28,390
We'll do as you say.

850
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:30,390
I'll call the news channels.

851
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,140
Let's make it huge!

852
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:35,390
Ok Nana. We need your support.

853
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,680
Nana.
Never mind.

854
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,680
What have you done?

855
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,840
Pokya has
been looking for you.

856
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:52,180
Why?

857
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,890
It seems the pizza
shop owner beat you up?

858
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,840
They said they
are showing it on TV.

859
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:01,640
Don't scare the kids.

860
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:07,260
These tiny little rug rats...
but they are so brave! Bravo!

861
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:10,090
How did we turn up on TV?

862
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,890
I don't know.

863
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,720
Hand me my mobile.

864
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,140
I'll tell Pokya
the kids are here.

865
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,260
They are leaving!

866
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:25,760
Hey, take your money.

867
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,660
Sarsu, are you coming
to the protest march tomorrow?

868
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:35,490
They are giving us
one meal and 100 rupees.

869
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:36,990
What is this march for?

870
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,360
Apparently some one thrashed
some kids from the slum.

871
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:40,740
Our slum?

872
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:44,070
I am sure they must
have done something.

873
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:45,200
Will you be there?

874
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,320
No.

875
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,070
Yes Mr. Mujumdar.

876
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,820
I am sure you have heard
about the whole incident.

877
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,910
Yes I saw it on TV.

878
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:58,410
But sir, you should have called me
before this whole episode blew up.

879
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,240
The kids are from my slum,
from my community.

880
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:05,110
What if you get charged
under ‘atrocity'?

881
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,360
I want to put an
end to this immediately.

882
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,410
Please help me.

883
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,530
What?

884
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,360
Please help me.

885
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:14,950
Help?

886
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:17,530
Of course I'll help you.

887
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:23,910
In a country where the poor struggle
to have two square meals a day...

888
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:27,320
... two poor children
dreamt of having a pizza.

889
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:31,700
But they had to pay a
heavy price for their dream.

890
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:37,910
Let us take a look at what the
people have to say about it.

891
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,740
Who shot our video?

892
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:48,280
Have they turned on the water?

893
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,410
I'll be right there.

894
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,240
Why are you staring
at a blank screen?

895
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:11,160
Mummy!

896
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,700
Huh?

897
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,950
No... nothing.

898
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,410
I know you are
up to something.

899
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:29,360
Amma hurry up or
you won't get any water.

900
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:33,280
The pizza shop
owner has it coming.

901
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:35,820
He has no clue what
is going to happen.

902
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:37,950
He'll see what I am all about!

903
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:41,950
There she is!

904
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:43,990
I have been looking
for you all over.

905
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:46,530
I even went to your factory.

906
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,240
Me?

907
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,360
Yes you!

908
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,280
Never mind.

909
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,320
I want you right at
the front of the march.

910
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:54,030
Me?
- Yeah.

911
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,660
Why?

912
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:59,970
Why? We are doing this for your children
and you want to just sit at home?

913
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,890
Don't you watch TV?

914
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:03,800
Your children
are all over on TV.

915
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:07,510
The pizza guy beat them
and the matter has heated up.

916
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,760
Hit them?

917
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:12,390
They hit my children?

918
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:34,840
Where are the kids?

919
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:37,300
There were right here.

920
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:38,640
Here?

921
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,760
Where are they now?

922
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:41,140
Oh my god.

923
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,430
Kidnapped.

924
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:43,890
They have kidnapped the kids.

925
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:45,390
Kidnapped?
- Yes.

926
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,550
They kidnapped my children?
Who are they?

927
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:51,140
Don't worry. The news
channels are supporting us.

928
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,840
Nana is standing by us.

929
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:55,340
You don't worry.
We'll find the children.

930
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,680
Chillar...
Let's go look for them.

931
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:13,590
Have you seen my children?

932
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:15,510
They just went this way.

933
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,090
Have you seen my boys?

934
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:37,300
They must have
gone to have pizza.

935
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:07,800
Boys!

936
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:46,680
Little Crow Egg!

937
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:16,180
I know everything...
about your boys, your husband.

938
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:19,300
It'll be alright.

939
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,010
Don't you worry.

940
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:23,720
I have spoken to a lawyer.

941
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,550
Nana is standing by you.

942
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:31,590
They are just children.
How far could they go?

943
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,260
They'll be somewhere
around here.

944
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:38,590
Will you have
something to drink?

945
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,390
I have looked everywhere
for the children.

946
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,760
Everyone has
a different story.

947
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:57,430
Your children are
like my children.

948
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:04,090
Rest assured... Nana will make sure that the
men who are behind this will pay for it.

949
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,140
They cannot get away with
treating our children like this.

950
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:16,140
You go home.

951
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,840
When the children come home,
bring them here to me.

952
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:26,510
This incident took place outside a branch
of the famous pizza chain - Pizza Café.

953
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,340
This video has gone
viral across social media.

954
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:36,050
When will such brutality
come to an end?

955
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:44,550
We are getting reactions
to this incident from far and wide.

956
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:50,970
This incident of brutality against children
has enraged the people from all over.

957
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:54,390
It has created a stir
even in the government.

958
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:57,010
Let us take another
look at this video.

959
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:03,510
Don't worry sir.

960
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:07,260
Give me some time. I'll
bring the children to you.

961
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:39,520
Sister, this is for you
and the rest of the ladies.

962
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:43,310
Create such a ruckus that
the pizza shop falls apart.

963
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,230
Don't you worry.

964
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,770
The cops are already here?

965
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:55,350
Shut up.

966
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:57,310
Hello Sir.

967
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:00,480
Are you the mother
of those children?

968
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,980
Yes sir.
You are right on time.

969
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:06,190
She is the mother and
this is ‘the Eggs' nest.'

970
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:10,350
Where are your children?

971
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,850
I don't know sir.

972
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:15,940
They have been missing
since yesterday.

973
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,230
Do you know where the
frogs hide after the rains?

974
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,150
Where?

975
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:27,270
In the clouds.

976
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:31,100
When the sun is
out they evaporate.

977
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,690
When it rains they
come down again.

978
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:36,690
No way! Liar.

979
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:38,770
I'm not lying. I swear.

980
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:40,350
Hey.

981
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,770
Have you seen the
kids from the pizza shop?

982
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:46,480
The kids from the TV news.

983
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,480
They are right here.

984
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:58,230
Sir. They are getting away.

985
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:59,400
Don't run away!

986
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,400
Boys!

987
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,350
Mummy!

988
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:18,230
Where were you
the whole night?

989
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,650
They showed our clip on TV.

990
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,480
Everyone was looking for us.

991
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:27,020
We got scared.

992
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,400
Come with me.

993
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:15,620
Pokya... when is your march?

994
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:22,420
Bhai! You're a fool.

995
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:39,360
Good morning sir.

996
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:41,450
We have found the children.

997
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:43,450
Sir.

998
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:45,780
I am bringing them
to you right now.

999
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:46,910
Yes sir.

1000
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:48,530
Thank you sir.

1001
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:53,700
Look! I guess Ankush
Chaudhari is back.

1002
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:12,280
Cheering.

1003
01:45:15,570 --> 01:45:17,490
It is cold in here.

1004
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,610
Do you like our shop?

1005
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:37,610
Get the pizza.

1006
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:41,320
But we don't have any money.

1007
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:42,950
Doesn't matter my dear.

1008
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,360
It is free for you today.

1009
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,610
Sir why don't you
feed them yourself?

1010
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:01,050
I apologize to everyone
for the unfortunate incident.

1011
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:05,470
Are you sure this wasn't just another
marketing ploy to promote your business?

1012
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,760
No, not at all.

1013
01:47:07,180 --> 01:47:08,890
What happened
is indeed very sad.

1014
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:12,340
I do not discriminate
between rich and poor.

1015
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:15,370
Sir, tell them about
the 49 rupees' pizza.

1016
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:23,290
Soon we are going to introduce a
pizza for just rupees 49 at this branch.

1017
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:39,210
Do you like the pizza?

1018
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,790
Not at all. You?

1019
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:44,830
No.

1020
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,960
It's disgusting.
So dry and flaky.

1021
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,290
And sticky too.

1022
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:56,210
The pizza that grandma made
was so much better than this one.

1023
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:09,170
How do we finish
the rest of this pizza?
