1
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,077
Please come in. Didn't
Mr. Girdharilal come along?

2
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,277
He never accompanies me.

3
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,279
He accompanied me only on his
second marriage with me.

4
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,563
Thereafter' he has
been busy working.

5
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,080
It's good to be busy working.

6
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,277
Nonsense!
It was Pappu's birthday.

7
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:24,085
I asked him to get
many toys for Pappu.

8
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,278
But he bought some stupid toy
from somewhere' which also broke.

9
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,682
Since then' he's been
pestering me . . .

10
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,280
to come to your
shop and buy toys.

11
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,717
Come' Pappu.
Move! What are you waiting for?

12
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,518
Careful' Pappu.

13
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,278
Take whatever you like.

14
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:45,437
Gaikwad' show some
toys to the kids.

15
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:49,280
Want this elephant' kid?
Take.

16
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:53,282
See this jeep'
it runs very fast.

17
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:58,282
Take it' son.
- See this train.

18
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:01,883
It goes chuk-chuk.
Want this too? Take.

19
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,919
What do you want' kid?
- Mom' shall I buy this horse?

20
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,281
Shut-up! You have grown so big
and still want to play with toys?

21
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,482
I won't buy it for you !
Pappu' buy that one too.

22
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:18,880
Madam' your packets.

23
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:22,281
Take this horse.
- But. . .

24
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:25,279
It's a gift from me.
- You are spoiling him.

25
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,878
Though you spoke in his interest
that he is a big boy now . . .

26
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:32,077
and therefore should
not play with toys . . .

27
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:34,277
but why are you giving
the world a chance to say . . .

28
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:36,437
that he is your step-son?

29
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,278
Take it.

30
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:44,677
Pappu' carry the parcels.
Move!

31
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,681
The elephant died'
how can he fight now?

32
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:07,285
The elephant broke his
leg and fell down.

33
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,278
Papa has come!

34
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,884
What have I bought for you?
- What have you bought' papa?

35
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,917
First give me a kiss.

36
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:21,278
Look.
- What a lovely toy.

37
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,677
Shall I show it to mom?

38
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,882
Mom look' papa has
bought such a lovely toy.

39
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,923
Isn't it lovely?

40
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:44,275
People talk to God' and my
Bitto talks to her dead mother.

41
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,680
Wish my Bitto could
get a real mother.

42
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,684
But if that real mother
is not good' . . .

43
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:52,915
her life will
become miserable.

44
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,281
My daughter
doesn't lack anything.

45
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,478
I am her mother' I am her
father. Right' child?

46
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:04,476
Master' my hand !

47
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:20,879
''With small dreams in her eyes''

48
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:26,880
''And wings of sleep on her arms''

49
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:32,680
''My darling daughter
swings on the moon''

50
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,282
''O moonlight' rejoice! ''

51
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:24,879
''She is the only
bloom in my garden''

52
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:30,280
''She is the only pearl
I found in the sea of life''

53
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:36,280
''I will give her so much love'
it will become a phenomenon''

54
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,279
''O moonlight' rejoice. . . . ''

55
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:23,877
Elephants' horses' palanquins.
Hail Kanhaiyalal !

56
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,879
Master' she is a kid now'
so you can dress her up.

57
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,917
You are giving her a bath'
changing her clothes.

58
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,678
But when she grows a
little older' . . .

59
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,677
how will you perform
a mother's duty?

60
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:44,481
I understand' Dayal.

61
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:48,285
When you do understand'
when will you get married?

62
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:50,877
Papa' when will I get married?

63
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,080
Now give her an answer.

64
00:08:54,287 --> 00:09:01,362
First papa will get married.
A new mother will come for you.

65
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:08,879
When will I get a new mother?
- First papa will select a mom.

66
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:12,875
A procession will be taken out.
The band will play.

67
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:19,275
Then' your mom will come home.
And you will be very happy.

68
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:22,279
Enough of day dreaming.
Now go and cook.

69
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,916
Give it to me.
It's my brother's letter.

70
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,085
And the other one is for master.

71
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:46,684
Manmauji. . . . .come here
and listen to me.

72
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:53,675
Go to the grocer and
buy two kilos of lentil.

73
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:57,874
What lentil?
- Yellow lentil.

74
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:02,281
Tell him he is adulterating
his products these days.

75
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,077
He adds red colour
to red chillies.

76
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:06,918
Adds yellow colour to turmeric.

77
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,884
If he doesn't give quality
species' I'll grind him to spice!

78
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,883
Go and tell him that!

79
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,077
He adds stones to the cumin.

80
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,997
My brother's letter.

81
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,678
' Hello' brother. '

82
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:33,078
Hello.

83
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,278
' I am fine and happy here'
- As if I am unhappy.

84
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:40,283
' I hope you' Mr.Amar
and Aarti must be fine'

85
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,277
Yes' everyone is fine.

86
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:46,884
' I am sorry to
write this' . . . '

87
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,284
' but please send me
Rs. 100 more this month'

88
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:54,719
I am more sorry to hear that
I should send you Rs. 100 more.

89
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,283
I don't own the Reserve bank to
just withdraw money and send you.

90
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:00,277
Send what?
- Sir.

91
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:02,277
My brother has asked
for Rs. 100 more this time.

92
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,841
How can I send him more
money when I don't have any?

93
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:07,277
If he has asked for it'
you'll have to send.

94
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,479
He is doing his graduation'
and Bombay is not a small town.

95
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,677
Even water is bought
with money there.

96
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,484
Did the dog
give you the letter?

97
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,080
Yes. It was from Kamla.
She is coming for tea tomorrow.

98
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:19,282
Kamla is coming?
Surprising.

99
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,884
Avoiding the issue will not do.
We won't take no for an answer.

100
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,917
You will have to marry.

101
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:29,282
That is my opinion too.

102
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,880
A man cannot take a
girl's responsibility.

103
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:34,317
Having a lady in the
house is very necessary.

104
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,276
Aunty' shall I feed
a biscuit to the dog?

105
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,278
Yes' sure.

106
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:44,280
Sister' having a lady in
the house is very necessary.

107
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,084
Even I am of the same opinion.

108
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,277
You are asking me
to commit suicide.

109
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,285
Is getting married committing suicide?
You are always talking nonsense.

110
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,676
I'm not talking nonsense'
it's a fact.

111
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,885
Lord Ram went into exile
because of his stepmother.

112
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,880
Kunal's stepmother
snatched his eyesight.

113
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,686
Take our neighbour
Girdharilal's son.

114
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,877
How much his
stepmother troubles him.

115
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,874
Do you know' the cruel lady once
burnt his hand with a hot spoon.

116
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:15,481
Amar' all stepmothers
are not alike.

117
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,283
Even I had a stepmother.

118
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,283
She had given me so much love'
perhaps my own mother would not.

119
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:27,676
Even today when I think of
her' my eyes brim with tears.

120
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,276
He weighs everyone
in the same scale.

121
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,084
I wouldn't tell him
if he had many children.

122
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:35,084
But she's an only child.
Besides' you are still young.

123
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:38,279
That is why I'm insisting.
The house seems so desolate.

124
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,284
Master leaves for his office
and Bitto goes to school.

125
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,876
And I am left
alone in the house.

126
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:49,279
When I get fed-up' I start
barking at the other servants.

127
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,361
Good you only bark'
don't bite.

128
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,285
See! He never takes
anything I say seriously.

129
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:57,876
Even I give an
ultimatum today.

130
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,280
Ultimatum?

131
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,679
Yes! I want madam'
and Bitto wants a mother!

132
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,881
I know Bitto needs a mother.
Even I need a wife.

133
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:11,275
But I fear she may
make your life miserable.

134
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:16,682
If you keep her in control'
why will she?

135
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,282
An then' that will come later.
I'll manage. Right' brother-in-law?

136
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,878
Yes' we'll get a nice
girl for your master.

137
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:27,676
I have a friend' Shantiswaroop
in Bombay' who has two daughters.

138
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,879
They are very nice girls.
I have met them.

139
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,441
You can marry
any one you like.

140
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:38,279
There is a difference of about
a year or so in them.

141
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,883
Both are beautiful' educated'
and good natured.

142
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,675
Write to them saying Amar
is coming to see the girls.

143
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,885
Do write in the letter that
the prospective groom has a kid.

144
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:52,084
Why should we hide'
we'll take Bitto along.

145
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:56,279
I have already told them this.
Just tell me when you are going.

146
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,678
A few days before
Holi festival.

147
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:03,078
I'll call them and inform them.
- Have sweets for this good news.

148
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:08,677
I'll serve him.

149
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,875
Dayal.
- Yes' master?

150
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,282
Do you know
what is the deepest?

151
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:20,277
The ocean' master.
- Wrong.

152
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,683
The depth of the
ocean can be measured.

153
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,279
Then who' master?

154
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,284
A woman's heart. It's
depth can never be measured.

155
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:33,284
Master' what's the need to get so
deep into anyone heart or brain?

156
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:37,276
There is. I will
marry only that girl . . .

157
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:41,679
who will love my daughter.

158
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:46,283
How will you know that?
- By posing as a servant.

159
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,517
I will come to see the girl
posing as a servant.

160
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:53,281
And who will be the master?
- You.

161
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,278
Me?
- Yes' you.

162
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:58,875
You will come as Amar'
and I as Dayal.

163
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,917
What kind of a joke is this?

164
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:06,278
I am not joking. I need
a good mother for Aarti.

165
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,478
And this is the only
way to check her out.

166
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:10,398
Why do you need to
pose as a servant?

167
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,278
I am a real servant.

168
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:16,475
I will check her out.
- You are good only in the kitchen.

169
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,079
Girls are different.

170
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:21,676
Before marriage' all girls
pretend they are very innocent.

171
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,917
It's only after marriage that
their true colours become obvious.

172
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:28,484
Tell me' if kept on the head'
will this shoe turn into a crown?

173
00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:32,874
This shoe cannot become the
crown'but can help get the crown.

174
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,879
And it can also make
one lose his crown.

175
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,917
But master'
how do I forget my place?

176
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:40,883
If you want me to
come and see the girl' . . .

177
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:44,681
you'll have to do what I say.
- But master' I am your servant.

178
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:46,917
How can I order you
around in their presence?

179
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,924
Alright' forget it then.
- No master. . .

180
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:51,281
we'll go. Bitto needs a mother.

181
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:53,280
Here she is.

182
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,283
Papa' when will we
bring the new mother?

183
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,880
From now on' call him papa.
- Him?

184
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,680
Yes' for a few days.
Or you won't get a new mother.

185
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,484
Say you will.
- Okay.

186
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:04,682
Good girl !

187
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:10,682
Master' come and take
this juice from me.

188
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,478
Come and give it to me.
- I am standing on the 2nd floor.

189
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,075
2nd floor?
- Not 4th master' 2nd floor.

190
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,924
Look down.

191
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:32,284
If you are laughing'
what will they do?

192
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:35,675
Come here.
- How can I? I cannot walk.

193
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,880
Seeing this gait of mine'
they will kick me out.

194
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,075
Master.

195
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:45,677
What are you doing?
Remove your hands.

196
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,877
After wearing such clothes'
I feel I have worn nothing.

197
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,675
Unless I don't wear what I
normally do' I feel I'm nude.

198
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,282
Move your hands. Rehearse for
15-20 minutes and you'll manage.

199
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:57,677
And don't call me master.
Get used to calling me Dayal.

200
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,283
Alright' master.
- Not master' Dayal.

201
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,883
That is what I'm saying'
Dayal master.

202
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:06,283
Only Dayal' not master.
- Yes master' Dayal.

203
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,277
Only Dayal !

204
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,880
Master. . . master.

205
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,916
Sit down.
Drink this.

206
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:34,677
Oh God' I committed no sin.

207
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:38,682
Yet why did God give
me this punishment?

208
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,077
We are going to have
guests in the house today.

209
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,880
And I had to get
this pain today!

210
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,684
Press harder.

211
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:59,679
The knot has gone.
- It has? Leave my leg !

212
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,277
Get up! Go!

213
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:06,681
Go!

214
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,682
Oh God' you are the only
one who I can tell my sorrows.

215
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:17,883
Despite having You'
I am an orphan.

216
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:21,884
Am I not destined for
even one day of happiness?

217
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,884
There was no salt at all.

218
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,884
But Shibban' without cream. . . .

219
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,282
Yes' madam?
- You know we have guests today.

220
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:38,282
Look' cook food
for Amar in butter.

221
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:41,882
And if a servant comes along'
cook food for him in oil.

222
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,485
You understand?
- Yes' madam.

223
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:46,678
Bansi' add bathing salts
to Amar's bath water.

224
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,282
And for his servant?

225
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,876
Tell him there is a
shortage of water in Bombay.

226
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,878
That he can go home and bathe.

227
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,879
And put him in the
room adjacent to Geeta's.

228
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,276
But madam' there is
no tube light in that room.

229
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:03,278
Shall I fix a bulb?
- Nonsense! We're having power cuts.

230
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,084
He'll stay in the dark.

231
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,277
What are you
making for breakfast?

232
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:09,278
Whatever you say.

233
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:14,674
Pattice' samosas' almond sweets'
and whatever else you like.

234
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:16,917
Hurry up' the guests
will be here any time.

235
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:20,884
Don't mess up the sweets.
- You make the sweets.

236
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,075
Move that knife!

237
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,880
I'll make the pattice.
- Then come.

238
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:38,279
Oh mummy' master has
come to teach me. . .

239
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:43,885
how to walk with an
enticing gait before the guests.

240
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,675
Enough of your gait!
Go and get dressed.

241
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,077
Master' you please leave.
Come!

242
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:59,284
I have never come
across a girl like you.

243
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,881
Does anyone take so
long to get dressed?

244
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:04,686
I don't know what to wear.

245
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,281
Wear anything' dear.
You are so beautiful.

246
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:12,283
Take' wear this.
Wow' this looks good.

247
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,683
It does?
- Yes.

248
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:16,877
Wear it and come down soon.
- Alright.

249
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:28,678
You are still here?

250
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,877
And I thought you must
have reached the station.

251
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:33,677
Tiwari is not accepting defeat'
what do I do?

252
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:35,478
I have a good deal today.

253
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:38,883
Do you have a family or not?

254
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,078
Madam' master'
the guests have arrived.

255
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:43,277
They have! Tiwari' you
continue' I'll join you.

256
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:44,885
Hurry!

257
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,278
Welcome! Welcome!

258
00:20:58,447 --> 00:21:01,279
I am Shantiswaroop'
and she is my wife' Durga.

259
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,278
He is my master. . .servant'
Mr. Dayal.

260
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,883
Not mister' only Dayal.
Master' seek blessings.

261
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:16,676
Not me' seek their blessings.
-You have a good sense of humour.

262
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,678
I'll take your blessings too.

263
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:21,121
Come in.

264
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:29,076
She is my elder
daughter' Shobha.

265
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:32,076
And she is my younger
daughter' Sheela.

266
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:35,884
And she?
- She is our maid.

267
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:38,279
Come.

268
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,280
What arrangements
have you made for Dayal?

269
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:47,278
Geeta' put his servant in the
room adjacent to yours. Go.

270
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,277
Please come.

271
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,077
This is your room.

272
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:23,681
Here's the broom.
Sweep the floor with it.

273
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,917
Then put a mattress on
the floor and take rest.

274
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,837
I live in the room
adjacent to this one.

275
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,037
My name is Geeta.
What is your name?

276
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,278
What a strange girl !
She gave me a broom and left?

277
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:42,281
She could have swept. . .
- Did you say something?

278
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,484
No.
I'll sweep the floor.

279
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,881
If you need anything'
call me.

280
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,278
She talks so sweetly.

281
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,717
First eat something'
then drink milk.

282
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:07,280
Amar' I hope you
are comfortable here.

283
00:23:08,127 --> 00:23:11,675
Don't embarrass
me by saying that.

284
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,884
Fragrant water for bathing'
wine for drinking.

285
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:22,279
Saffron paste instead
of ordinary soap.

286
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:25,279
I have no problems here.
Right' dear?

287
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:32,875
Take' mom.
- Shobha has made this pattice.

288
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,283
Please taste.

289
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,283
Wow' it's tasty!

290
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,277
I feel like
staying here forever.

291
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:56,283
Sheela has made these samosas.

292
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,277
Take' eat.

293
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:05,885
It's pungent.
- Then have this sweet.

294
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,878
My wife has made this.

295
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,286
Almond sweet.
- You have made it?

296
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,081
Yes.
- What has your cook made?

297
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,280
Just the side dishes.

298
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:23,276
How smart.
One must respect a good servant.

299
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:31,277
Shobha' serve Aarti.
- Mummy. . . me?

300
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:35,278
Shall I serve you' Aarti?
- I'll serve myself' thank you.

301
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:44,279
Madam. . .
- Madam? Call me mother.

302
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,277
Mother' have you given my
servant Dayal something to eat?

303
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:53,281
I'll send something. Shobha' ask
Geeta to give some tea to Dayal.

304
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,880
Who can I complain to?
This was my idea.

305
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:03,884
Tea.
- Wow' tea !

306
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,883
It's hot.
- It's tea' not a cold drink.

307
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:13,923
Drink it slowly.

308
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,083
Sit down.

309
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,883
I wanted to ask you something.

310
00:25:23,087 --> 00:25:25,680
The two girls my master has
come to see' are they good?

311
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,282
They are very nice.
You saw them.

312
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:32,680
I am not talking of looks.
What about their nature?

313
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:34,878
They are good natured.

314
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,286
Among the two'
who is better?

315
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:41,277
Both are good.

316
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:43,681
One of them must
be a little bad?

317
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,684
No' both of them
are equally good.

318
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:48,275
Shall I ask you something?
- Yes.

319
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:51,281
Is your master stupid?

320
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,077
What is this you are saying.

321
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:57,284
See! You cannot hear
your master's criticism

322
00:25:57,487 --> 00:25:58,885
Even I cannot.

323
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:01,281
My master's daughters are
much better than your master.

324
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,885
No' you misunderstand me.
- I understand everything.

325
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:09,677
What is this?
Only tea?

326
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,281
Do you serve only tea
to guests in Bombay?

327
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,683
Where is the samosas & pattice?
- I'll get it.

328
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:18,678
Be quick.

329
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,275
Master.

330
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,279
This maid is good.

331
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:28,082
Forget her. Who do you
like among Shobha and Sheela?

332
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:30,078
Who do you like?

333
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,277
Master' how does
my opinion matter?

334
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:34,881
You should like the girl.
Who do you like?

335
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,277
We'll see. We'll test.

336
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,283
You go and rest.

337
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:42,684
Master' I'll sleep there'
and you will sleep here?

338
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,682
My heart breaks
just thinking about it.

339
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:47,837
No Dayal' it's just a
matter of a few days.

340
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,277
Go and rest.
- Shall I massage your legs?

341
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:51,919
No.
- Just a little.

342
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,314
I'm not in a mood for it.
- Just little?

343
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,084
Go!

344
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,284
I'm sorry' Basmati.

345
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,876
My name is not Basmati'
it's Geeta.

346
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:13,881
But every fragrant thing
has a special name.

347
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:16,482
Because there is a special
fragrance about you . . .

348
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,881
I have named you Basmati.

349
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:20,924
Shall I say something more?

350
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:24,283
You'll make an ideal wife.

351
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:29,283
You have gone nuts.

352
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:34,078
Look. . .go and get
your brains checked.

353
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:39,877
Where do I have brains
to get them checked.

354
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:43,681
I only have Basmati !

355
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:48,278
Be careful in the dark.
If you trip and fall. . .

356
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,678
I can see very
well in the dark.

357
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,282
Sleeping in the dark?

358
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:58,281
What are you doing?
- There is no bulb in this.

359
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,477
I've brought a bulb.
Take.

360
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:04,278
Be careful' or you'll
get an electric shock.

361
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,284
Bansi' switch it on.

362
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:10,279
All the darkness in this
house is for the servants.

363
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,477
Go and get some cold
water from the fridge.

364
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,676
Switch the torch off now'
the bulb is on.

365
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:22,685
Oh yes.

366
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:25,679
Butter for themselves
and oil for the servants.

367
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:30,881
But she doesn't know that
I can ignore her orders.

368
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,277
Eat well. I have cooked
it in butter for you.

369
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,683
But that's deceiving
your master.

370
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,882
The master is himself
under a deception.

371
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:41,077
Madam rules the roost here.

372
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:46,884
What is the time in this watch?
- 1 1 : 15 pm.

373
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,882
It's so late!
Go to sleep.

374
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,765
I'm not sleepy.

375
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,917
That's the problem.
Even I am not sleepy.

376
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,281
How do the rich sleep
on these soft beds?

377
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:58,084
Even a donkey
cannot sleep on it.

378
00:28:58,287 --> 00:29:00,083
Sing me a lullaby.

379
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:03,278
My mom never sung me a
lullaby to put me to sleep.

380
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,077
Sing !
- Alright.

381
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,276
What happened?
- Sing properly.

382
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:17,681
Okay.

383
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,684
Don't moo like a buffalo.
Sing like my papa.

384
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:26,680
I cannot sing like your papa.

385
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:29,884
I'll do one thing.
I'll take you to your papa.

386
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,883
He'll sing you a lullaby
and put you to sleep.

387
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,281
I'll go myself.
- You know where he is?

388
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:36,677
Yes.
- Then go.

389
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:42,680
Even the young ones
have started teasing me now.

390
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:48,282
How do I go to sleep?
What have I got myself into.

391
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:28,876
''She is the only
bloom in my garden''

392
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:34,879
''She is the only pearl
I found in the sea of life''

393
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:40,280
''I will give her so much love'
it will become a phenomenon''

394
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:44,275
''O moonlight' rejoice. . . ''

395
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:57,679
''With small dreams in her eyes''

396
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:03,275
''And wings of sleep on her arms''

397
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:08,681
''My darling daughter
swings on the moon''

398
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:13,279
''O my moonlight' rejoice! ''

399
00:31:55,447 --> 00:32:00,281
''I masquerade for you''

400
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:06,281
''I have suffered so much'
yet I keep you happy''

401
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:12,286
''I wander streets for you''

402
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:16,280
''O my moonlight' rejoice. . . ''

403
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:29,278
This is chess' wife!
Chess!

404
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,679
It can make the best
of men taste defeat.

405
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:36,276
Knock off the best of men.

406
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:45,683
That stupid Tiwari has never
been able to win against me.

407
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:48,680
Save your knight.

408
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:56,683
What fate! He dreams
of chess even in his sleep.

409
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:58,275
Listen !

410
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,881
Shibban' Bansi !
Get up!

411
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:08,283
Why are you up?
- I accept defeat!

412
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:13,076
Only in my dream.
- I am not careless like you.

413
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,761
I was dreaming
of Shobha's marriage.

414
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,718
What did you see?

415
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:21,680
I saw Shobha is already
married to Amar.

416
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:25,276
Congratulations!
Morning dreams always come true.

417
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,876
You'll see'
Amar will marry Shobha.

418
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:34,276
But will Shobha be able
to adjust with Amar?

419
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,278
Why not?

420
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:41,084
Amar is a very straight guy.
Infact' he's dumb.

421
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:45,281
Whereas our Shobha is educated'
smart' fashionable.

422
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,677
How will their natures match?
- Like ours have.

423
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:54,680
Was I fashionable?
- No' but I was dumb.

424
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,678
I am dumb' and always
will be' a henpecked husband.

425
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:10,685
The damned milkman
comes so early.

426
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,879
I've told him so many
times not to come so early.

427
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,683
Come after half an hour'
then I'll take the milk.

428
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,285
You !
I messed it.

429
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:35,885
I thought I was in Bhopal.
The milkman came early there.

430
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:38,881
One does miss home.

431
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,675
Did you sleep well?
- No. . .yes.

432
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,002
You were comfortable?
- Absolutely.

433
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:46,277
That is what I came to ask.
Please go and rest.

434
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:59,280
Here's your tea.
- Good. Biscuits too today.

435
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:01,277
Yes.
I'd been scolded that day.

436
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:05,274
Sit and have tea.
- Won't you have tea?

437
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,675
This. . .
- Is tea' not a cold drink.

438
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,439
Where had you gone
early in the morning?

439
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,278
I'd gone to your
room looking for you.

440
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:18,086
Aarti slept in my
room last night.

441
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:20,283
I went to leave her in
master's room.

442
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,282
Aarti loves you very much.
- Even I love her very much.

443
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,278
How many children do you have?

444
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:33,676
Children?
I myself am a child still.

445
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,277
Oh' so you are not married yet.

446
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,286
No' but I do
intend to get married.

447
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,284
But I still haven't
found a girl who I like.

448
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,277
What kind of a
girl do you want?

449
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:54,274
A girl who doesn't let Aarti
feel that she's her stepmother.

450
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,276
One who looks
after the house' . . .

451
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:01,279
and gives all the happiness
in the world to Aarti.

452
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,285
The way you are talking like
as if Aarti is your child.

453
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:12,876
She is. . .I mean' my master's
daughter is like my own daughter.

454
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:18,077
Yes. Besides' Aarti is a
sweet girl' and very lovable.

455
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:21,277
Some people are like that.

456
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:23,875
So lovable that you have to
give your heart to them.

457
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,880
Yes. . .that's true.

458
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:41,684
Shobha' our culture
and values teach us . . .

459
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,084
that a guest
is an image of God.

460
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:47,676
To look after him
well is our duty.

461
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:51,075
Who knows in what form
one may come across God.

462
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:55,478
And then' Amar
has come to see you.

463
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:59,080
Me?
- Yes. You and Sheela.

464
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:03,474
Whoever he likes among you two'
we'll get her married to him.

465
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:08,678
Daddy' who he likes is important.
Isn't even our opinion important?

466
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:13,284
When has our opinion ever
been important in this house?

467
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,124
It is your mother's
opinion that is important.

468
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:21,077
Ensure that the guest
is well looked after.

469
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:24,718
Is the guest caged?
- What do you mean?

470
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,282
It's animals who
are looked after.

471
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:29,283
Shut-up!
Don't talk rubbish.

472
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:31,881
Mummy' his first
wife is dead.

473
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:33,525
Now he wants to
cause another wife's death.

474
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,483
Moreover'
he even has a daughter.

475
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,880
So what?
He is moneyed.

476
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,080
Mummy' money is not
everything in life.

477
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,877
Then what is?
- Love.

478
00:38:46,887 --> 00:38:48,604
That will happen after marriage.

479
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:51,684
And where his kid is concerned'
she'll get married and leave.

480
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,278
Then you will rule the roost.

481
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:59,281
''It's a tradition''

482
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:04,283
''Lose your life'
but don't break your word''

483
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:15,683
Why are you sitting on the
floor? Sit on the sofa.

484
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,924
Come on.

485
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,874
What are you doing' sir?
You'll land me in a soup.

486
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:26,760
You are the master'
I am just a servant.

487
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,878
Times have changed.
Everyone is equal now.

488
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:35,877
You cook so well.
How much do you get paid?

489
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:38,276
I feel embarrassed
even it to tell you.

490
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:40,278
You'll feel sad when you know.

491
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:42,879
Only Rs. 50.

492
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,680
In a city like Bombay' where
everything is so expensive?

493
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:49,765
I have requested madam several
times to increase my pay.

494
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:52,281
But she is unmoved.

495
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,676
What moved?
- Unmoved.

496
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:57,483
Give me some tobacco.
- Take.

497
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:03,679
Is there no union
of cooks in Bombay?

498
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:08,084
What union' sir?
To each his own.

499
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,886
I'll teach you how
to get a raise.

500
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:16,283
When some guest comes home' tell
your master to give you a raise.

501
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,284
Or else. . .
- Stop work?

502
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:19,845
A complete strike!

503
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:40,878
What act is this?

504
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:43,281
It's not an act'
we are on strike.

505
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:45,917
Strike?
What do you mean?

506
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,882
Hey!
The milk is boiling over.

507
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:52,675
So let it.We went on strike after
keeping the milk for boiling.

508
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:54,882
Give us a raise!
- Increase our salary!

509
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:57,280
You'll get a raise.

510
00:40:57,487 --> 00:40:59,681
Today itself!
- Yes!

511
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:02,884
Let the guests leave'
then I'll give you a raise.

512
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,281
Then even the food will be
cooked after the guests leave.

513
00:41:05,487 --> 00:41:07,283
The house chores will be
done after the guests leave.

514
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:08,720
What nonsense is this!

515
00:41:08,887 --> 00:41:10,877
Give us a raise!
- Increase our salary!

516
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:13,281
Shut-up!

517
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:16,883
You are pressurizing me at
a time when I have guests.

518
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,680
Give us a raise!
- What if I don't?

519
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:23,284
Give us a raise.
- Increase our salary!

520
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:28,276
How dare you ! Just you wait!
Listen ! . . . Listen !

521
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:32,281
Coming !
What is the matter?

522
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:36,874
Settle their account
and dismiss them!

523
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:40,677
What happened' Shibban? Why are
you carrying that pan' Bansi?

524
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,683
We want a raise!

525
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:44,279
Alright.

526
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:48,075
They are right. These are inflationary
times. Give them a raise.

527
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:50,083
Even we are living in
inflationary times.

528
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,675
Give us a raise!
- Stay quiet!

529
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,276
Try and reach a compromise.
- I will not compromise!

530
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,882
Dismiss these disloyal men !

531
00:42:00,847 --> 00:42:04,680
Give us a raise!

532
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,917
Take your money and leave.

533
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:22,283
The flavor of a local cigarette'
and the joy of your own room . . .

534
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:27,476
cannot match this imported
cigarette and this bungalow.

535
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:33,876
This Dayal. . .can he cook?

536
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,717
Ofcourse' mother!

537
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:41,675
When the royal family
is having a feast' . . .

538
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:43,683
they call Dayal
to cook for them.

539
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:48,676
He cooks so well' people
chew their fingers too.

540
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,275
Enough !
How much you are praising him?

541
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:56,884
People like you give
these servants airs.

542
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:58,679
Gosh !

543
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:00,915
Gosh !

544
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:08,075
Listen.

545
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,485
Dayal.
- Yes' madam?

546
00:43:11,687 --> 00:43:16,282
Until your master is here'
you will have to cook.

547
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,482
Me?
- Yes' you.

548
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:22,276
You are no king. You will be
a servant wherever you go.

549
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:24,881
But madam' I. . .
- No buts.

550
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:28,478
Amar says you are
a very good cook.

551
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:31,884
Mr.Amar said that?
- Yes' he did.

552
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:34,277
Now go and cook.

553
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,080
And listen.
Fry the ' puris' well.

554
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:54,083
Yes' mother?

555
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:58,281
I have asked
Dayal to cook food.

556
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:01,286
Keep an eye on him.
He may steal something.

557
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:04,918
He's not like that.
- Is he related to you?

558
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:08,483
His master is a simpleton'
but he seems to be very smart.

559
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:11,686
I doubt whether he will
be able to cook or not.

560
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:15,278
Amar himself told me
he is a very good cook.

561
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,278
You go and do
the house chores.

562
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:21,276
And listen !
Keep an eye on him.

563
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:25,885
He may add butter to his food.
Go.

564
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:38,924
What have you done to the flour?

565
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,917
I added a little
more water perhaps.

566
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,485
Little more water?

567
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:45,280
Mr.Amar has told mother
that Dayal cooks very well.

568
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:48,275
Yes' that Dayal cooks very well.

569
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,677
That Dayal? Are there
two Dayal's in your house?

570
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:53,515
No' I am that Dayal.

571
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:56,277
My master loves
to pull people's leg.

572
00:44:56,487 --> 00:44:59,876
He sometimes asks me to
exchange roles with him.

573
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,437
You wash your hands
and cut the vegetables.

574
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,077
Let's cut the vegetables.

575
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,284
You cut your finger!

576
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,438
It's not too bad.

577
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:39,678
How compassionate you are.

578
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:42,275
Humans should be compassionate'
or they are not humans.

579
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:44,444
Our association of
just a few days . . .

580
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:48,082
Just a few days? I feel
it's an association of years.

581
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,077
That's how
good natured people are.

582
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:54,642
You find me good natured?
- An angel.

583
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:56,885
Why are you fooling me?

584
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,681
Why should I?
I said what I feel.

585
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:03,681
What else does your heart feel?

586
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:07,877
My heart believes
you are very helping.

587
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,881
Forget it.
Why are you buttering me?

588
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:17,680
Butter is not applied
to people' but on bread.

589
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:26,884
After seeing your looks' I feel
like asking you two a question.

590
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:29,284
Go ahead.

591
00:46:29,447 --> 00:46:32,882
You know what bitter gourd is?
- Yes.

592
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:35,677
How do you cook it?
- What?

593
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:40,083
We don't know.
- You don't?

594
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:43,881
Every woman must know this.
Cooking is an art.

595
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:46,476
Art? It's a fine art.
- Absolutely!

596
00:46:46,687 --> 00:46:51,885
A woman who cannot cook is like
a buffalo without a tail & horns.

597
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,278
First saute the
lady fingers in oil.

598
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,877
I will learn to
cook with your help.

599
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:06,917
And I will find life
with your help.

600
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:11,837
Shall I put the
lady fingers in the pan?

601
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:28,283
Wait. . .wait.

602
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:34,679
I asked you how bitter gourd
is cooked and you are laughing.

603
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:39,077
How is bitter gourd cooked?
- The cook cooks it for us.

604
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:42,279
What if the cook falls sick?
- We'll eat in a restaurant.

605
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,880
What if the
restaurants are on strike?

606
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:47,281
So?
- So?

607
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,879
The kids will go hungry.

608
00:47:49,087 --> 00:47:50,883
We'll think about it
when we get married.

609
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:53,281
But kids will be
born after marriage.

610
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:55,283
And in my case'
I already have a daughter.

611
00:47:55,447 --> 00:47:56,879
Dayal uncle!

612
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:59,077
She sometimes
calls me Dayal uncle.

613
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:01,277
What happened to
your Dayal uncle?

614
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:03,284
What?. . . Really?

615
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:13,284
Mother' why did you
ask Dayal to cook?

616
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,876
The poor guy is sick.
- He's sick?

617
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:18,285
What's wrong with him?

618
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:21,683
His leg. . . his head. . .
he has an upset stomach.

619
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:24,276
The doctor has
told him not to cook.

620
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:30,080
What a strange doctor? He's
forbidden cooking'but not eating?

621
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,514
He's our family doctor.

622
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:36,282
If you didn't have anyone'
you should have asked me to cook.

623
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:39,880
You?
- Yes' I know to cook.

624
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,077
I'll cook food today.

625
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:48,878
Great!
You make wonderful ' puris'

626
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,280
Whether round or whatever shape'
what difference does it make?

627
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,677
What are you doing' Mr.Amar?

628
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,275
It's me who has cooked
all his life . . .

629
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:05,274
Master' that
harsh teasing hurts.

630
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:07,277
Let Dayal be Dayal here.

631
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,875
But' Mr.Amar. . . Mr. Dayal. . .

632
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:15,477
It's mother who has
played this joke' not me.

633
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:17,876
She is not making Dayal'
but Amar cook food.

634
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,077
One who comes along with
the guest is also a guest.

635
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:23,278
You are not well' you go.
I'll manage the kitchen.

636
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:30,874
Great cook! Is this a
' puri' or the map of India?

637
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:33,281
What are you doing !

638
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:37,077
Cooking' and making
designer ' puris' for you.

639
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:39,437
You don't bother'
I'll make them.

640
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:43,275
I am not just your guest'
but also your cook.

641
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:48,880
I am sorry' Amar.
I made a mistake.

642
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:53,085
I'll cook.
- If you say so.

643
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:56,878
Dayal' you go'
you are not feeling well.

644
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:59,242
Take rest.

645
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,275
Geeta' you roll the ' puris''
I'll fry them.

646
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:08,076
Mother' I bathe before eating.

647
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:11,882
If Geeta rolls ' puris''
who will ready my bath?

648
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:15,282
Go and get his bath ready.

649
00:50:20,927 --> 00:50:23,076
There she comes!

650
00:50:28,287 --> 00:50:32,677
What's up?
- Help mother make ' puris'.

651
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,083
Mother' what should I do?

652
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,278
Dance on my head !
Roll the ' puris'' I'll fry them.

653
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:50,278
Dayal has an upset stomach.
Just give him boiled rice.

654
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:52,279
Don't give him anything else.

655
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:06,283
Boiled rice.
- Boiled rice?

656
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:08,517
But I ate that
even in the afternoon.

657
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,678
You have an upset stomach.

658
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:13,684
I have an upset stomach?
Says who?

659
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:16,923
Your master.
- Master.

660
00:51:18,487 --> 00:51:20,875
When he has an upset stomach'
he says I have it.

661
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:26,678
What is this?
Oil in boiled rice?

662
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:31,275
Then will servants be given
butter in their boiled rice?

663
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:36,877
Such discrimination has erased
the love between master & servant.

664
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,242
There is no compassion
left between them.

665
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:41,280
Come to Bhopal and see.

666
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:43,277
Both master and servant
are treated alike.

667
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:45,277
There is no discrimination.

668
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,437
Oh yes' I can see that.

669
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:50,081
You live here' and your
master sleeps in the AC room.

670
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:54,281
I am staying
here of my own will.

671
00:51:55,127 --> 00:51:57,082
Or master wanted me
to stay with him.

672
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:01,285
Eat the rice.
- I don't like it.

673
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:05,283
But I'm eating it to show respect
to a servant's helplessness.

674
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,278
I was also hungry.

675
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:20,683
Why did you tease me that day?

676
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,883
Am I crazy
to tease you' master?

677
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:27,277
Master' how many stumps down?

678
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:30,275
What?
- I mean' wickets?

679
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:32,765
Four wickets.

680
00:52:32,927 --> 00:52:34,917
Why did you say I
have an upset stomach?

681
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:36,883
I said it in fear.

682
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,277
Do you know what I had to suffer?
- What?

683
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,277
What our cricketers are suffering.

684
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:43,277
What happened?
- Rats kept running all night.

685
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:45,676
In the stadium?
- No' in my stomach.

686
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:47,877
Out of hunger.
- I'll cook something for you.

687
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:49,684
You want our secret to be out?

688
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:52,883
I will not cook. I will make
some family member cook for you.

689
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,884
Not family. . .

690
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,281
Did any stump fall?
- Stump?

691
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,076
No' wicket.
So where were we?

692
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,279
Family. . .
- Not family. . .yes. . .

693
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,917
You are not ready yet?
We have to go for a movie.

694
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:21,680
Master. . . . Dayal. . .she says
I have to go for a movie.

695
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,277
How do I go?
- Then go!

696
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:26,717
Master' please go.

697
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:34,281
Dayal'don't you know what happens
to me after having asafoetida?

698
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:36,284
I get a headache.
- You have a headache?

699
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:38,283
I'll get medicine for you.

700
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:41,277
Dayal' a little harder.
Come down.

701
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,277
Any more fall of wickets?

702
00:53:55,287 --> 00:53:56,958
What is it?

703
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,283
Dayal' what are you
doing on the bed?

704
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:03,076
Master' I was
massaging your legs.

705
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,277
Get down and do it.

706
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:10,281
Is the pain severe?
- Pain? Oh' headache. It's bad.

707
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,084
Shall I massage it?
- No.

708
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:15,676
How did you get a headache?
- It's due to change of weather.

709
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:19,080
The food you cooked
has given me an upset stomach.

710
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:22,278
You are right. An upset stomach
does give one a headache.

711
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,676
I've brought medicine.
- He doesn't need medicine.

712
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:27,679
I have brought castor oil.
- No' not castor oil !

713
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:30,680
Drink this' it is very
good for the stomach.

714
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,677
Drink it' master.
- My husband takes it every day.

715
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:37,277
It is very good for the stomach.

716
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:40,281
And look'
don't have dinner tonight.

717
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:42,717
Won't I even get dinner?

718
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:45,281
And take' you also have it.
Even you have an upset stomach.

719
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:47,877
Master' it is very
good for the stomach.

720
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:51,278
I'll take it later.

721
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,077
Master' my leg !

722
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:02,283
My leg !

723
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:08,880
Master' it's come.

724
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:12,880
Not from there' from here.

725
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,278
Alright' go then.

726
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:20,277
Just keep coming and going now.

727
00:55:21,687 --> 00:55:23,677
Nothing happened here'
but his wicket fell.

728
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,283
Strange are your ways' God.

729
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:32,557
Sometimes there is sorrow'
and sometimes' happiness.

730
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:34,837
You are aware of everything.

731
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:41,882
Since Dayal has come here' I have
a strange feeling in my heart.

732
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:45,076
Even mother's harsh tongue
doesn't hurt me anymore.

733
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:50,285
I have never asked you
for anything until today.

734
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:56,280
Is it possible
that even Dayal feels . . .

735
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,677
Who is it?
- It's me' Dayal.

736
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:55,077
I cannot sleep.

737
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,482
So what can I do about that?

738
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:04,683
I think there is some
feeling which I am suppressing.

739
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:09,677
If I reveal it'
I'll probably be able to sleep.

740
00:57:10,287 --> 00:57:12,481
Shall I say it?

741
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:15,675
Yes.

742
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:20,877
Actually'
since I have seen you . . . .

743
00:57:21,727 --> 00:57:24,684
I feel something.

744
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:27,278
What do you feel?

745
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:30,876
I don't know.
It's. . . it's. . .

746
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:34,281
Don't you feel anything?
- Feel what?

747
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:38,678
It's. . . .forget it. . . .I think
I'll have to stay up all night.

748
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:41,275
No.
Tell me what's on your mind.

749
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,281
Geeta' I feel I will go mad.

750
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:51,885
I see stars during day
and the sun at night.

751
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:54,277
I see you all around.

752
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:58,274
All the time' I hear only
these words from my heart.

753
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:01,678
What?
- Geeta' I love you !

754
00:58:01,887 --> 00:58:04,684
I cannot live without you.
. . . .I want to marry you.

755
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:07,277
Will you marry me?
- Quiet!

756
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:14,282
Dayal' madam will get up.
Mr.Amar will get up.

757
00:58:14,687 --> 00:58:16,881
Let them get up'
I don't care for anybody!

758
00:58:17,287 --> 00:58:20,278
I will scream and ask
you only one question !

759
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:22,557
Do you love me?
- Yes!

760
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:28,885
Yes Dayal' I love you.

761
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,879
But how do I believe it?

762
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:37,283
I will do whatever you say.

763
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:39,283
You will do whatever I say?

764
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:41,875
Alright' then come to the
garden with me right now.

765
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:46,278
You go' I'll join you.
- Feeling shy to come with me?

766
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:48,278
No.
- Then?

767
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:50,477
The form in which I want to
present myself before you . . .

768
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:53,277
to see that'
you'll have to wait.

769
00:58:56,487 --> 00:58:58,477
Wait?. . . .okay.
But you will come?

770
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:09,083
This is Your miracle.

771
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:12,676
Dayal is asking me whether
I'll really come or not.

772
00:59:13,727 --> 00:59:16,877
I can go anywhere in
the world with him.

773
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,924
I'll just be back.

774
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:51,279
''My veil hangs''

775
00:59:57,087 --> 01:00:01,876
''Bend a little my beloved'
my veil hangs''

776
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:07,282
''My heart pounds' my beloved''

777
01:00:12,327 --> 01:00:19,880
''Straighten up my beloved'
my heart pounds''

778
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:58,882
''That is why I
am wearing a veil''

779
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:04,080
''Or you will pierce my
heart with your look''

780
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,675
''Bend a little. . . . ''

781
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:52,082
''Lips like rubies'
and fair cheeks like pearls''

782
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:57,076
''Lift your veil
and let me see this treasure''

783
01:02:40,487 --> 01:02:42,477
''Straighten a little. . . . ''

784
01:02:42,847 --> 01:02:45,679
''The beauty of the city I am
has become famous for me''

785
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:49,674
''Come into my arms' and I'll
see the whole world here''

786
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:55,280
''Straighten a little. . . . . ''

787
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,477
What are you doing
with this fellow here?

788
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,481
God !

789
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,677
Tell me' why are you quiet?

790
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,277
I will break your legs!

791
01:03:49,607 --> 01:03:51,676
You didn't care
for our prestige?

792
01:04:19,287 --> 01:04:21,880
Hello.
- Bless you.

793
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:30,880
I am going to meet Gopinath.

794
01:04:32,687 --> 01:04:37,282
Gopinath? And even Tiwari
lives along that route.

795
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:40,280
If I meet him'
I'll have to say hello.

796
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:42,365
How cruel can you get?

797
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:44,557
Will you do me a favour?
- Tell me.

798
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:49,283
Check with the grocer why he
hasn't sent oil and butter yet.

799
01:04:49,447 --> 01:04:50,720
We have guests at home.

800
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,275
Hello' madam.
- There he comes. I'm leaving.

801
01:04:56,287 --> 01:04:59,676
I seek your blessings.
- Bless you.

802
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:02,677
Have you brought all the
things in the list?

803
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:06,482
I have brought
more than what you wanted.

804
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:10,284
Nonsense!
A grocer never gives more.

805
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:13,876
I have brought pure butter.

806
01:05:14,287 --> 01:05:16,277
Alright' go and
keep it in the kitchen.

807
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:20,278
Madam.
- What is it now?

808
01:05:21,487 --> 01:05:24,478
Do give a thought to me.

809
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:28,077
Alright' I'll give you a
good tip during festival time.

810
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:33,880
Not during festival' I'll ask for
a tip on an auspicious occasion.

811
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:36,676
Alright' go and keep the
things in the kitchen.

812
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:57,281
Where has everyone gone?

813
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,077
They have quit and left.

814
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:02,481
Quit and left?
And Geeta?

815
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:06,681
She's here.
- Thank God she's here!

816
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:09,681
Whether the others are there
or not' who cares!

817
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:14,278
Who are you?

818
01:06:15,447 --> 01:06:16,674
The new servant?

819
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,679
No' I'm a guest.
- Oh' guest.

820
01:06:20,087 --> 01:06:22,680
Guest? Whose guest?
Geeta's?

821
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:24,878
No' master's.

822
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:28,880
Oh. Then it's okay. That means
you'll be here only for a few days.

823
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,885
She's come.

824
01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:41,274
My eyes were craving to see you.

825
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:43,280
I'll break your eyes!

826
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:48,075
Even after being blinded'
I'll look for you.

827
01:06:49,087 --> 01:06:51,077
Hey mister!
Keep the groceries and leave.

828
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:53,279
What is your problem?

829
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:55,283
Geeta and me have always
been teasing each other.

830
01:06:56,687 --> 01:06:58,677
Right' Basmati?

831
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:00,958
Jaggu' stop your
nonsense' or I. . .

832
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:03,282
Or will you break my head?

833
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:06,077
I will break your head !

834
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:10,280
Mr. Guest' you break a coconut.

835
01:07:10,927 --> 01:07:12,882
That auspicious
moment is very near. . .

836
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:17,279
I forgot to get the coconut!
I'll get it right away.

837
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:34,281
Hurry up. If madam comes'
we'll have a problem.

838
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:36,283
What problem can be greater than
the one we already have on hand?

839
01:07:43,687 --> 01:07:45,278
Are you hurt?

840
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,038
Walk straight!

841
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:02,282
Shall I come?
- Yes.

842
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,681
Thank you God'
for saving my reputation.

843
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:28,719
Had anything happened to you'
what would I tell madam?

844
01:08:52,487 --> 01:08:54,283
What is Vijay's room number?

845
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:02,277
This is 4 2.

846
01:09:03,846 --> 01:09:05,278
This is 4 1.

847
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:08,284
This is 40.

848
01:09:10,687 --> 01:09:15,680
But this is locked. Where has he
gone? Where do I look for him?

849
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:20,878
Vijay has gone out.

850
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:23,281
If you have any message'
I can convey it to him.

851
01:09:23,487 --> 01:09:25,283
I don't want any massage.

852
01:09:25,926 --> 01:09:27,881
I said message.
I can convey it to him.

853
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:45,284
So you have come?
- How would I not?

854
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:47,881
Where were you
since so many days?

855
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:51,278
A boy has come to see me.
We have guests at home.

856
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:54,274
To see you.
- Yes. Worried?

857
01:09:55,087 --> 01:09:57,680
Shobha has chosen him' not me.

858
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:02,281
But the man is pretty rich.

859
01:10:02,487 --> 01:10:07,082
Is it?
What if he chooses you?

860
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:09,917
Will you change your mind?

861
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:14,083
Where are you going?

862
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:16,277
Annoyed?
- You say such annoying things.

863
01:10:16,527 --> 01:10:18,881
Alright' henceforth I won't.
Come' sit down.

864
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:32,284
How are you' master?
I mean' Dayal.

865
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:39,276
I'm fine' but in bad shape.
This charade is too much for me.

866
01:10:39,927 --> 01:10:43,680
You got me into it. Now
we'll have to continue with it.

867
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:49,684
Master' what are you doing?
- It's become a habit.

868
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:51,878
It may become an obsession.

869
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:54,685
So better select a wife for
yourself soon' and let's leave.

870
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:57,878
It's not the selection'
I want to test her nature.

871
01:10:58,247 --> 01:11:02,285
Do it'
but make it fast.

872
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:07,685
However long it takes' until
Aarti selects her mother . . .

873
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:09,877
we'll have to stay here.
- Alright.

874
01:11:10,887 --> 01:11:14,276
Bansi ! Is anyone around?
- Coming !

875
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:19,445
Poor master!

876
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:23,285
Can I come in?

877
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:27,477
I have brought tea.
- Keep it here.

878
01:11:38,247 --> 01:11:42,285
Ms. Shobha' if you don't mind'
shall I ask you something?

879
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:46,276
What do you think of Aarti?

880
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:51,484
She's very cute. I feel I
should keep her with me always.

881
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:54,283
And Aarti's father?

882
01:11:56,287 --> 01:12:00,279
When I like his daughter'
why won't I like him?

883
01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:03,278
That means you
like Aarti's father?

884
01:12:05,327 --> 01:12:10,275
But I don't know whether
he likes me or not.

885
01:12:10,687 --> 01:12:12,677
I'll ask him.
- Okay Dayal. . .

886
01:12:16,927 --> 01:12:18,917
You ask him and let me know.

887
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:34,480
Your books' Ms. Sheela.

888
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:37,276
I brought all of them.

889
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:43,277
Why are you standing?

890
01:12:47,687 --> 01:12:50,883
If you don't mind'
shall I ask you something?

891
01:12:51,127 --> 01:12:52,275
Yes.

892
01:12:52,447 --> 01:12:57,281
What do you think of Aarti?
- She's a cute girl.

893
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:00,117
That means you like her?
- Yes.

894
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:03,483
And Aarti's papa?
- Mom likes him.

895
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:07,077
You mean' you don't like him?

896
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:09,477
Who cares about
what I like or not?

897
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:12,283
But he likes you very much.

898
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:18,675
He likes me' he likes Shobha'
he likes Geeta' he likes mom.

899
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:21,482
You want to ask anything else?

900
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:34,678
Tell me Aarti' why has your
papa pampered Dayal so much?

901
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:38,277
You are not to be told that.
- Why not?

902
01:13:38,487 --> 01:13:41,478
Come on' tell me.
I'll get you a nice frock.

903
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:46,284
I'll buy you sweets'
and a lovely doll. Tell me.

904
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:50,281
You won't tell anyone?
- No' it will be our secret.

905
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:52,678
My papa. . . .

906
01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:57,074
You brazen fellow!
How dare you beat the child.

907
01:13:57,407 --> 01:14:00,284
I'll go and complain to your master.
Get out of my sight!

908
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:02,882
Come' Aarti.

909
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:12,517
Mr.Amar' do you
know what happened?

910
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,278
Dayal slapped Aarti?

911
01:14:14,487 --> 01:14:16,078
Madam didn't tell
you anything else?

912
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:17,924
No.
What happened?

913
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,680
She slapped Dayal.
He is crying.

914
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:27,276
That old woman slapped my
Dayal? I'll teach her a lesson !

915
01:14:28,087 --> 01:14:29,075
Master!

916
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,917
She slapped you?

917
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:41,084
Tell me' have we come here for
an alliance or to get slapped?

918
01:14:42,087 --> 01:14:44,281
Today she has slapped you'
tomorrow she will slap me.

919
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:46,882
And then Aarti.
- Listen' Dayal.

920
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:48,678
We will not stay here any more.

921
01:14:48,847 --> 01:14:51,076
If you don't come'
I'll break my head.

922
01:14:52,887 --> 01:14:56,879
There is no need to get angry.
So what if she slapped me?

923
01:14:57,087 --> 01:14:59,077
She is elder to me'
just like my mother.

924
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:02,684
I understand your pain. But
don't do anything stupid now.

925
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:04,074
Or Aarti won't
get a good mother.

926
01:15:04,287 --> 01:15:07,676
Master' the world is so vast.
There are so many other women.

927
01:15:07,927 --> 01:15:09,917
We'll choose someone else'
but let's leave from here.

928
01:15:10,287 --> 01:15:12,675
There is no
need to make an issue.

929
01:15:12,927 --> 01:15:14,439
I understand your pain.

930
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:17,683
But one has to sacrifice
to get something in return.

931
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:19,678
Now you calm down.
- Master. . .

932
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:21,279
Calm down !
- Alright.

933
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:32,884
Aarti. . .come to me.
- I won't' you beat me.

934
01:15:44,567 --> 01:15:47,285
Now what?
- Sleep is eluding.

935
01:15:47,727 --> 01:15:49,876
Go and tell your Dayal uncle.

936
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:53,478
Not me' my doll cannot sleep.

937
01:15:56,527 --> 01:15:57,675
Come.

938
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:01,277
How do we put her to sleep?

939
01:16:05,287 --> 01:16:10,280
''With small dreams in her eyes''

940
01:16:11,127 --> 01:16:16,280
''And wings of sleep on her arms''

941
01:16:17,087 --> 01:16:21,876
''My darling daughter
swings on the moon''

942
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:26,280
''O moonlight' rejoice! ''

943
01:17:38,127 --> 01:17:43,280
''She is the only
bloom in my garden''

944
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:48,879
''She is the only pearl
I found in the sea of life''

945
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:54,275
''I will give her so much love'
it will become a phenomenon''

946
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:57,877
''O moonlight. . . ''

947
01:18:06,727 --> 01:18:11,720
''With small
dreams in her eyes. . . ''

948
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:14,885
''Along with the sleep'
a prince will come''

949
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:20,275
''He will put a vermilion dot'
and garland you''

950
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:26,286
''And then kiss
your pretty face''

951
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:30,275
''O moonlight . . . . ''

952
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:06,284
Then what happened?
- I didn't know what to do.

953
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:10,281
But then I remembered
I had my exam after two days.

954
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:13,275
On the pretext of
going to the library . . .

955
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:17,485
I fooled both Shobha and the
guest from Bhopal' and came here.

956
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:23,279
Fair maidens.

957
01:20:26,687 --> 01:20:29,280
Big mansion.
- Not mansion' hotel.

958
01:20:29,687 --> 01:20:32,678
Hotel? Where one eats?
- Yes. Sit down.

959
01:20:34,927 --> 01:20:38,077
You want water?
- No. Don't you want to eat?

960
01:20:43,807 --> 01:20:46,684
It is good Sheela
didn't come with us.

961
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:51,277
You don't understand.

962
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:54,281
Mom is right'
you are a simpleton.

963
01:20:57,287 --> 01:21:01,074
Do you have a match?
- I have this lighter.

964
01:21:04,487 --> 01:21:06,477
People in Bhopal
don't think I am one.

965
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:10,277
Forget what
people say in Bhopal.

966
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:16,675
What is the matter?
You look scared.

967
01:21:18,527 --> 01:21:20,278
What happened?
- Nothing.

968
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:28,077
That's Sheela !

969
01:21:28,887 --> 01:21:31,480
But who is with her?

970
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,283
Sheela' let's go.

971
01:21:35,447 --> 01:21:37,277
Yes' let's go!

972
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:39,963
Sheela' what are you doing here?

973
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:43,880
I was going to the library
when I came across Vijay.

974
01:21:44,287 --> 01:21:46,083
He is a fellow student.

975
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:48,277
Vijay' she is my
elder sister' Shobha.

976
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:52,274
And he is Amar'
a rich man from Bhopal.

977
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,484
He's the one I'd
mentioned about to you.

978
01:21:56,607 --> 01:22:00,884
Oh' so you are that man.
Hello.

979
01:22:03,567 --> 01:22:06,683
When in college' even we used to
go to the lavatory like this.

980
01:22:06,887 --> 01:22:08,877
What?
- He means library.

981
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:12,880
It's great weather for studying.

982
01:22:14,287 --> 01:22:17,278
Yes.
- We'll be going.

983
01:22:17,447 --> 01:22:19,277
We're getting late.

984
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:33,279
What is the matter?
Why are you upset?

985
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:36,884
Let's go home.
- But we have just come.

986
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:41,282
What do I say?
I am feeling uncomfortable.

987
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:45,285
Alright' let's go home.

988
01:22:53,287 --> 01:22:56,278
I've been waiting for you.
- I was with master.

989
01:22:58,127 --> 01:23:00,082
Take' I've bought you
Bombay's special sweets.

990
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:02,284
For me?
- Yes.

991
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:05,679
I'd gone to the market' saw the
sweets and was reminded of you.

992
01:23:06,127 --> 01:23:09,675
It's a speciality of Bombay.
- This must be expensive.

993
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:12,682
So what?
I have bought it with my money.

994
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:18,678
Take' eat.
- Keep' I'll eat it.

995
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,276
Why? Any problem if
I put it in your mouth?

996
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:23,756
I didn't say that.
- Then eat.

997
01:23:27,607 --> 01:23:29,278
Like it?
- It's good.

998
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:33,676
Got my money's worth. I was
thinking if you don't like it. . .

999
01:23:36,927 --> 01:23:38,678
It's sweet too.

1000
01:23:39,327 --> 01:23:42,284
Tell me' what is the sweetest?

1001
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,277
Don't know?
Shall I tell you?

1002
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,075
Love.

1003
01:23:50,727 --> 01:23:53,684
You'll have to eat all of this.
- Don't you have?

1004
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,963
You ate it' I ate it!

1005
01:23:58,607 --> 01:24:00,483
This old woman won't even
let me serve you sweets.

1006
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:02,443
Finish it'
I'll be back.

1007
01:24:19,927 --> 01:24:21,678
Brother' you?

1008
01:24:24,087 --> 01:24:26,281
How are you?
- I am fine.

1009
01:24:26,447 --> 01:24:28,437
But when did you come here?

1010
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:31,280
About 10- 15 days ago.

1011
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:34,481
Shall I ask you something?
- Yes.

1012
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,877
How did you forget that you
are a servant's brother?

1013
01:24:40,887 --> 01:24:44,481
The path you have taken'
is it the right one for you?

1014
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:47,686
Before trying to
reform the young' . . . .

1015
01:24:47,847 --> 01:24:51,282
the elders themselves must reform.
- You are being rude to me!

1016
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,875
Did I send you here to study
or to romance?

1017
01:24:55,807 --> 01:24:57,683
It's no sin to love.

1018
01:24:58,287 --> 01:25:00,675
What is a sin is to masquerade
as a rich man and cheat someone.

1019
01:25:01,487 --> 01:25:03,477
To ruin some
innocent girl's life.

1020
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:06,675
You tell me'
are you a rich man?

1021
01:25:07,287 --> 01:25:09,880
Have you won a lottery?
What money do you have?

1022
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:15,476
Your brother has won
a lottery of loyalty.

1023
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:19,484
This shine you see
on a poor man . . .

1024
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:23,080
is all for my master's sake.

1025
01:25:23,847 --> 01:25:27,077
Master has come
to test Shobha and Sheela.

1026
01:25:27,567 --> 01:25:31,878
He is going to marry one of them.
I don't know who.

1027
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,717
He is posing as a servant
and has put me in a soup . . .

1028
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:36,882
asking me to
pose as master.

1029
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:39,882
And I cannot do a thing.

1030
01:25:40,527 --> 01:25:44,678
Vijay' I have never
cheated anyone so far.

1031
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:47,440
Nor have I ever
ruined any girl's life.

1032
01:25:56,487 --> 01:26:00,274
I accused such a good man !
I should be beaten.

1033
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:03,684
Don't be stupid.

1034
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:12,083
It's not your fault. Anyone in
your place would think I'm bad.

1035
01:26:12,287 --> 01:26:16,074
Forgive me.
- Listen to me.

1036
01:26:16,287 --> 01:26:21,076
Do me a favour.
- Just order me.

1037
01:26:21,487 --> 01:26:25,479
Not order' I request you.

1038
01:26:25,927 --> 01:26:29,282
Don't say that'
I can even give my life for you.

1039
01:26:29,527 --> 01:26:32,279
Don't say that.
May you live long.

1040
01:26:34,687 --> 01:26:40,875
What do you want me to do?
- My heart breaks saying this.

1041
01:26:41,087 --> 01:26:43,077
I am snatching your
happiness from you.

1042
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:48,283
But I have to give preference
to my master's happiness.

1043
01:26:49,327 --> 01:26:51,282
You move out of his way.

1044
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:57,877
So that master gets a wife
and Aarti' a mother.

1045
01:26:59,287 --> 01:27:04,280
Forget Sheela.
Forget her forever.

1046
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:15,677
I promise you' brother.

1047
01:27:17,647 --> 01:27:22,879
I will sacrifice my love for
the sake of Mr.Amar's happiness.

1048
01:27:25,327 --> 01:27:29,285
Look' this is the groom'
and this is the bride.

1049
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:34,881
They are going
to get married today.

1050
01:27:35,087 --> 01:27:37,281
This is mom' and this is dad.

1051
01:27:38,087 --> 01:27:40,680
This is grandma'
and who is this?

1052
01:27:40,887 --> 01:27:41,875
Grandpa.

1053
01:27:43,607 --> 01:27:45,278
Damn your play!

1054
01:27:46,567 --> 01:27:48,477
Will you make her a maid too?

1055
01:27:50,127 --> 01:27:54,677
You have grown so big'
and are playing with toys?

1056
01:27:55,287 --> 01:27:56,480
I was only
entertaining Aarti.

1057
01:27:56,687 --> 01:28:00,884
Shut-up!
Don't try to act smart with me.

1058
01:28:01,887 --> 01:28:04,081
Come' dear.
Come with me.

1059
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:09,677
Don't you dare play
with the kid again !

1060
01:28:24,207 --> 01:28:29,883
God' what sin have I committed
for which I am being punished?

1061
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:34,286
Am I so lowly . . .

1062
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,076
that I cannot even
express my love to someone?

1063
01:28:50,687 --> 01:28:52,278
I have come!

1064
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:54,917
You should not come here.
- Why?

1065
01:28:55,087 --> 01:28:57,077
Because madam doesn't like it'
she gets angry.

1066
01:28:57,367 --> 01:28:59,755
Then let her be.
I'll come here a 100 times.

1067
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:02,685
No' you will not come
here at all. Go away.

1068
01:29:29,287 --> 01:29:34,280
''Don't come to me' my doll''

1069
01:29:35,087 --> 01:29:40,285
''My sorrow will sadden you''

1070
01:30:10,687 --> 01:30:16,682
''I am the one who has
come into this world . . . ''

1071
01:30:17,127 --> 01:30:20,880
''only to cry''

1072
01:30:22,687 --> 01:30:27,885
''What is my life''

1073
01:30:29,247 --> 01:30:32,875
''I only exist''

1074
01:30:34,927 --> 01:30:40,284
''I have no dream'
nor any hope''

1075
01:30:40,527 --> 01:30:45,281
''Don't come to me. . . ''

1076
01:31:16,647 --> 01:31:22,278
''Your eyes craving for love . . . ''

1077
01:31:22,847 --> 01:31:26,680
''make me anxious''

1078
01:31:28,287 --> 01:31:34,282
''I cannot give
you a mother's love''

1079
01:31:34,687 --> 01:31:38,281
''Even though I want to''

1080
01:31:40,607 --> 01:31:45,885
''I have nothing to give you''

1081
01:31:46,287 --> 01:31:51,280
''Don't come to me. . . ''

1082
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:20,901
Hello.

1083
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:27,302
Greetings.
- Greetings. Come' Dayal.

1084
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:29,302
Take.

1085
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,701
The ' paan' is good.

1086
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:42,303
I have come to take leave.
- Leave? For what?

1087
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,980
We want to return
back home tomorrow.

1088
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:47,300
But you hardly
stayed any days here.

1089
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,701
Have we offended you
that you want to leave?

1090
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:55,102
No' we enjoyed our stay here.
But there is a saying. . .

1091
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:58,706
' Guests are
never welcome too long'

1092
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:02,701
What is the matter?
- They want to go back tomorrow.

1093
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:05,300
Want to go back?
Why?

1094
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:10,502
It's not proper
for guests to stay so long.

1095
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:13,020
People will wonder if we have
come here to select a girl . . .

1096
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:14,702
or stay forever.

1097
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:17,099
On reaching home' master
will convey his decision to you.

1098
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:21,297
Why? Is he embarrassed to
convey his decision here?

1099
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:25,304
Look' it's my silver
anniversary on the 25th.

1100
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:30,305
We'll think after that.
- What is on the 25th?

1101
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,707
Her silver anniversary.
- And not yours?

1102
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:38,704
It's the same thing. We will
complete 25 years of marriage.

1103
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:40,707
She wants to celebrate.

1104
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,698
Is that so?
Then I'll ask master to stay.

1105
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:48,300
We will surely join the
silver anniversary celebrations.

1106
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:56,899
Bhopal may be a small town'
but it's a lovely place.

1107
01:33:57,310 --> 01:33:59,698
Every person there is nice.

1108
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:06,701
Everything about
that place is lovely.

1109
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:09,060
And what do you think of Bombay?

1110
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:13,104
If I say anything about Bombay'
a bomb will explode here.

1111
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:16,985
So let it explode'
but you do tell us.

1112
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,497
Then listen.

1113
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:22,901
In Bhopal' when we have a guest'
we give him a warm welcome.

1114
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:26,301
We offer him everything
that we have.

1115
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:30,304
Over here'you ask a guest whether
he'd like something hot or cold.

1116
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:32,904
How can a guest
say what he wants?

1117
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:36,304
Master' our departure
date has been fixed.

1118
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:38,904
When master. . . Dayal?

1119
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:44,302
After the silver anniversary
celebrations of master.

1120
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,067
I don't understand.

1121
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:48,940
It's mom's silver jubilee
anniversary.

1122
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:51,300
And that too'
on the 25th of this month.

1123
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:54,304
Hublee?
Can't you pronounce Hublee?

1124
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:57,698
Not Hublee' it's jubilee.

1125
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:00,304
What an illiterate man you !

1126
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:06,303
Will you have a party?
- Yes.

1127
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:09,060
And music and dance?
- Yes.

1128
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:12,706
Then your party
will be a memorable one.

1129
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:17,699
How is that?
- My master dances very well.

1130
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,299
Is it?
- He sings very well.

1131
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:24,307
He's a great dancer.

1132
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:27,698
Yes' I break the floor.

1133
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:31,106
He's joking.

1134
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:35,906
And when he sings'
he receives accolades!

1135
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:41,302
Music is in his genes.

1136
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:48,307
See how well he sings.

1137
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:51,297
What note was that?

1138
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:59,305
Angry note.
- I think it the note of ruin.

1139
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:16,303
''I have been to many parties''

1140
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:26,307
''But this is
something different''

1141
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:39,308
''I have seen several beauties''

1142
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:42,309
''But your style is
something different''

1143
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:34,303
''This evening is an
evening of revelry''

1144
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:50,303
''It's a celebration to remember''

1145
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:53,303
''An enchanting night''

1146
01:38:17,710 --> 01:38:23,306
''O bartender' I
got a drink from you''

1147
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:35,306
''But also let me
drink from your eyes''

1148
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:47,307
''Let me drink from
your eyes today''

1149
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:53,103
''Your eyes are more
mesmerizing than any drink''

1150
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:05,306
''I have been to
many parties. . . . ''

1151
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:58,583
''You are asking for a heart
that is not worthy of anything''

1152
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:10,901
''Your heart craves for
something it can never get''

1153
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:35,306
''All your fantasies. . . ''

1154
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:43,103
''will find a cure'
just let that day come''

1155
01:40:55,310 --> 01:41:00,303
''Let that day come' my beloved''

1156
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:03,100
''My heart is not the cure''

1157
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,703
''Your cure lies
with someone else''

1158
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:26,943
''I have been to
many parties. . . ''

1159
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:47,700
''It is my desire' that
I see you always''

1160
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:58,305
''It's all in the hands of fate'
you or I cannot do a thing''

1161
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:11,299
''My eyes say there
is no one like you''

1162
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:16,305
''There are so many beauties
here' but you are different''

1163
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:20,304
''There is no one like you
in the whole world''

1164
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:27,586
''How do I say''

1165
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:28,738
''What are you''

1166
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:29,858
''My beloved''

1167
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:31,908
''I swear! ''

1168
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:42,301
''What you have. . . ''

1169
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:45,300
''You understand?''

1170
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:51,704
''What you have is
something out of this world''

1171
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:55,021
''I have been to
many parties. . . ''

1172
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:47,301
Basmati. . . no. . . . Geetu.

1173
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:52,904
You have addressed
me so lovingly!

1174
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:57,903
Where has everyone gone?

1175
01:43:58,110 --> 01:44:00,703
For an outing.
- Wish they never return.

1176
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:04,108
Then it will be just you and me.

1177
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:05,628
What do you mean?

1178
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:10,101
I mean' that we can openly and
without caring for the world . . .

1179
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:12,905
talk of love.

1180
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:15,505
Really?
We'll talk of love?

1181
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:21,705
Yes Geetu' we have both' the
atmosphere' and the opportunity.

1182
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:24,106
You brazen fellow!

1183
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:26,265
So you'll act tough?

1184
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:32,106
Jaggu' leave me!
- I'll show you how to love.

1185
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:45,304
Jaggu' leave her!
I said' leave her!

1186
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:53,106
You?
- Yes' me.

1187
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:56,301
How did you dare to come here?
- How dare you misbehave!

1188
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:00,304
No one dares to
cross swords with me.

1189
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:01,943
It is better that you leave.

1190
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:05,107
And no one dares to misbehave
with a woman in my presence.

1191
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:07,699
If you care for your life'
just go away.

1192
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:10,060
Don't forget that you
are a guest in this house.

1193
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,106
I have been coming to
this house since 10 years.

1194
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:13,298
No one has objected.

1195
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:15,903
And then' this is my personal
matter. She is my fiancee.

1196
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:19,306
I am going to marry her.
Who are you to interfere?

1197
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:22,304
Stop your nonsense or
I'll punch you in the face!

1198
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:25,302
Your threats don't scare me.

1199
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:26,741
I will not spare you !

1200
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:37,620
Are you badly hurt?
- No' it's nothing.

1201
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:40,898
Show me. You are bleeding
and say it's nothing?

1202
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:43,699
I'll clean it.
- No' it's a minor injury.

1203
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:47,909
You unnecessarily made
enemies with him because of me.

1204
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:52,498
After seeing his behavior'
any decent man would do the same.

1205
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,867
He will never dare
to tease girls again.

1206
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:00,500
I'll never forget this favour.

1207
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:03,504
It was no favour'
it was my duty.

1208
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,701
This milk is for who?
- For me.

1209
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:14,100
No' it's for me.

1210
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,100
I'll ask you something. Will
you give me an honest answer?

1211
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:29,701
Yes.
- Look at me and say yes.

1212
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:31,298
Yes.

1213
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:34,899
What do you think of me?
- I like you very much.

1214
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:37,947
Very much?
- Yes.

1215
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:40,304
And what does Dayal think of me?
-I don't know.

1216
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:44,301
You don't know?
But I like Dayal very much.

1217
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,308
And my papa?

1218
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,906
Not your papa'
I like your servant' Dayal.

1219
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:53,105
He is my papa.

1220
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:55,903
Dayal is your papa?
. . . .And Amar?

1221
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:58,307
Amar is the fake papa.

1222
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,020
Why so?
You won't tell me?

1223
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:02,178
No.
- Why?

1224
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:05,108
I won't get a
new mother otherwise.

1225
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:12,897
Not papa' call me Dayal uncle.

1226
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:20,297
Aarti' does Sheela love you?

1227
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,303
Yes' she does.
- You like her?

1228
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:25,500
I like Geeta.

1229
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:28,304
Geeta?
Yes' she is a nice girl.

1230
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:31,308
You like her?
- Yes' I like her.

1231
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:33,307
Then make her my mummy.

1232
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:36,906
How is that possible?
- Why not?

1233
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,905
She will marry someone else.

1234
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:43,301
She is a maid after all.
- Can't she become mummy?

1235
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:49,186
Yes' she can.

1236
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:56,458
I'm busy.

1237
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,097
You can work later.
I'll only take two minutes.

1238
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:02,106
Tell me.

1239
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:05,507
Children are so innocent.

1240
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:12,306
They don't discriminate
between class or status.

1241
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:14,900
They treat everyone equally.

1242
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:18,703
And in their innocence'
they speak without thinking.

1243
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:24,900
She was telling me yesterday
that she'll make you her mother.

1244
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:31,306
So what did you say?
- I. . . .I. .tried convincing her.

1245
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:35,306
That we are only employees.

1246
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:40,305
If you don't mind'
I know of a good boy. . . . .

1247
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:45,105
Enough ! I don't need
anyone's pity or favour.

1248
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:52,306
Okay' so I saw a dream.
Where I saw my destiny shine.

1249
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:55,905
But when my eyes opened' . . .

1250
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:58,700
I realized that a
dream is only a dream.

1251
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:04,107
Thank you very much' Mr.Amar.

1252
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:07,660
You don't need
to worry about me.

1253
01:50:08,910 --> 01:50:10,865
Leave me to my fate.

1254
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:29,303
''I masquerade for you''

1255
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:43,303
''I have suffered so much'
yet I keep you happy''

1256
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:51,660
''I wander streets for you''

1257
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:56,308
''O moonlight' rejoice. . . ''

1258
01:51:11,110 --> 01:51:14,306
I seek your blessings' madam.

1259
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:22,902
Madam' your silver anniversary
was celebrated with elan.

1260
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:28,298
But I didn't get anything.

1261
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:32,501
What do you want?
Shall I give you Rs. 2 1?

1262
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:35,902
No' madam.
- Shall I give you Rs. 5 1?

1263
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:39,300
No' madam.
- Then what do you want?

1264
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:43,901
Just give me
Geeta in marriage.

1265
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:46,304
Geeta?

1266
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:49,706
Yes' or that Dayal will
take her away . . .

1267
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,940
and I'll be left
standing and staring.

1268
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:56,107
What is this you are saying?
- That's what is going on.

1269
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:58,300
She wants to marry Dayal.

1270
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:02,309
If she wants to
marry a petty servant . . .

1271
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:04,107
I'd rather get
her married to you.

1272
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:08,700
Madam' thank you ! May you
celebrate a golden anniversary.

1273
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:11,304
Shall I fix up a
date for marriage?

1274
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:13,302
Go ahead.

1275
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:26,900
Did You watch me being made
fun of? Are you happy now?

1276
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:31,305
Are You satisfied'
or do You want some more?

1277
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:35,106
If You want some more fun'
have it.

1278
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:41,897
You are a spectator. You love
watching people being humiliated.

1279
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:46,907
A poor girl is being tormented'
and You do nothing about it?

1280
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:54,298
If You are God'
show me your miracle.

1281
01:52:55,190 --> 01:53:01,298
What will You do? You are
deaf' dumb' a stone idol.

1282
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:04,704
Even Your heart is stoned.

1283
01:53:05,590 --> 01:53:08,945
You have no love' pity'
mercy for anyone.

1284
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:14,303
Listen. . .

1285
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:22,420
Doesn't my leaving hurt you?

1286
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:29,304
It hurts me.
I have no one but You.

1287
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:36,706
You are my mother' my father'
my friend' my guardian.

1288
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:40,700
You mean everything to me.

1289
01:53:45,310 --> 01:53:50,303
Alright' don't speak.
Even I won't beg before You.

1290
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:53,900
I won't plead for mercy.

1291
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:58,300
Even I won't cry before You.

1292
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:10,301
O stone statue'
I am leaving.

1293
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:23,307
Madam' I am leaving.

1294
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:29,097
Where are you going?
- Wherever my legs take me.

1295
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:36,099
I know. You want to run
away with a petty servant.

1296
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:39,098
Neither with the master'
nor with the servant.

1297
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:43,703
I am going alone.
- No' you cannot go anywhere.

1298
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:46,699
Your mother had put
you in my care.

1299
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:48,940
Made you my responsibility.
Made you dependent on me.

1300
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:51,899
My mother may have made
me dependent on you.

1301
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:58,306
Maybe she put me in your care'
but only to serve you.

1302
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:00,899
Shut-up!
What nonsense are you talking !

1303
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:04,978
I am not talking nonsense'
I am asking you.

1304
01:55:05,470 --> 01:55:07,699
Who are you to fix
my alliance with Jaggu?

1305
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:12,705
What right do you have?
-You are talking to me like that!

1306
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:15,460
You dare to argue with me?

1307
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:22,622
What are you doing !

1308
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:24,700
You are saying this?
- Yes.

1309
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:27,300
Now you are speaking for her?

1310
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:30,299
When torture goes
beyond tolerance' . . . .

1311
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:32,505
even stones
break into speech.

1312
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:36,106
Geeta's mother didn't tell
you to get her married . . .

1313
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:38,106
to some idiot like Jaggu.

1314
01:55:38,350 --> 01:55:43,707
I will get her married to Jaggu.
I have given my word to him.

1315
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:48,102
Over my dead body!

1316
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:54,299
I will get her married to Jaggu.
Let me see who can stop me.

1317
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:58,900
Master' Geeta
was going that way.

1318
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,100
She was even carrying baggage.

1319
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:04,300
She should have left long ago.

1320
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:05,704
Why?

1321
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:10,706
God should
never orphan any child.

1322
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:14,303
Geeta is the daughter
of Durga's friend.

1323
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:18,304
She was only 2 years old
when her father died.

1324
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:21,540
And after a few days'
even her mother died.

1325
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:25,104
Before dying' she put
Geeta in Durga's care.

1326
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:29,304
This shameless woman
promised the lady . . .

1327
01:56:30,070 --> 01:56:32,299
that she'll rear Geeta
like her own daughter.

1328
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:36,302
But she has tormented the
poor girl in so many ways.

1329
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:40,304
Where will the poor girl go?
I'll go and get her.

1330
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:42,744
You don't brother'
I'll go and bring her back.

1331
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:54,304
Are you inspector Wagle?
. . .I am Durga Mathur.

1332
01:56:55,190 --> 01:57:00,946
My maid Geeta has eloped
with the servant of my guest.

1333
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:06,302
His name?
His name is Dayal Thakur.

1334
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:11,504
I don't know what she has taken.

1335
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:16,307
But she has run away. Catch
her and bring her back to me.

1336
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:25,305
Vijay' come and tell Sheela
that you cannot marry her.

1337
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:28,303
Even I will tell Shobha
that I don't like her.

1338
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:31,303
Then master will
marry any one of them.

1339
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:33,302
Come on.

1340
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:40,701
Have you changed your mind?
- No' not at all.

1341
01:57:57,550 --> 01:57:59,904
Where are you going?
- Wherever my legs take me.

1342
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:02,902
The world is vast.
- I won't let you go like that.

1343
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:08,304
I don't want anyone's sympathy.
And then' who are you to stop me?

1344
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:11,899
I may not mean
anything to you . . .

1345
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:15,501
but I have realized today
that you mean everything to me.

1346
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:18,300
You are imposing yourself on me.

1347
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:20,705
I don't want to do
anything with a lair.

1348
01:58:21,310 --> 01:58:23,300
Let me go.
- No' Geeta.

1349
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:27,498
It's true that I am a lair'
but my Aarti is honest.

1350
01:58:29,110 --> 01:58:31,100
And she has accepted
you as her mother.

1351
01:58:31,790 --> 01:58:33,780
Won't you return
even for her sake?

1352
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:43,105
Amar' am I dreaming again?

1353
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:45,301
No' Geeta.

1354
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:56,905
Oh great!
You two look like one.

1355
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:03,702
Dayal' you bashed me up that day.

1356
01:59:04,830 --> 01:59:07,297
Today' I have brought
so many people to bash you.

1357
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:12,306
You were you a grocer.
Since when did you become a goon?

1358
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:14,068
I'll teach you a lesson !

1359
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:09,300
Police! Run !

1360
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:11,306
Where are you going?

1361
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:21,305
Inspector' that goon is
eloping with my fiancee.

1362
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:29,060
Why do I see only half of you?

1363
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:31,300
Because your one eye is shut.

1364
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:34,901
Is your name Dayal?
- Yes' and she's Geeta.

1365
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:38,108
I've received a complaint that
you are eloping with the girl.

1366
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:39,578
Come with me.

1367
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:41,740
Why did you have to
call up the police station?

1368
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:43,098
Did Geeta steal anything?

1369
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:45,300
She has quit the job.
It's her wish.

1370
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:49,300
Whatever I have done is correct.

1371
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:51,306
You don't need to worry.

1372
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:53,108
What is it?
- Look who's here.

1373
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:55,300
Who is it?
- Kamla aunty.

1374
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:57,904
Welcome.
- Welcome.

1375
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:07,103
Where is Amar?
- He has gone out.

1376
02:01:09,110 --> 02:01:12,306
Who did my brother select?
Shobha or Sheela?

1377
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:16,101
He hasn't told us anything yet.

1378
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:19,699
Kamla' Shobha has given
her consent to marry Amar.

1379
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:25,102
But that servant of yours
has brought Amar disgrace.

1380
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,700
Disgraced Amar?
What did he do?

1381
02:01:28,470 --> 02:01:30,460
It's nothing'
she's talking rubbish.

1382
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:34,742
Oh yes! He'd complain only
if Dayal had eloped with Shobha.

1383
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:37,698
Who did Dayal elope with?
He is a very decent guy.

1384
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:42,302
That decent guy has
eloped with our servant.

1385
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:46,901
Mother. . . .sister' greetings.

1386
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:49,300
Where is brother-in-law?
- He's on tour.

1387
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:53,697
You have become a gentleman
coming to Bombay' Dayal !

1388
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:59,298
What game is this?
- It's no game.

1389
02:01:59,790 --> 02:02:01,905
I am Dayal'
Amar is my master.

1390
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:04,905
He asked me to
pose as master . . . .

1391
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:07,265
and he posed
as the servant.

1392
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:09,900
But why?
- I'll tell you.

1393
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:12,899
To test our daughters.

1394
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:16,902
So that Aarti
gets a good mother.

1395
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:23,302
Madam' Dayal was
eloping with Geeta.

1396
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:27,308
Tell them'
isn't Geeta my fiancee?

1397
02:02:27,910 --> 02:02:29,706
What are you talking?
Dayal is my brother.

1398
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:34,300
And the one who he is calling
Dayal is my master' Amar.

1399
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:39,703
Inspector' Geeta is not
his fiancee' he's lying.

1400
02:02:40,190 --> 02:02:41,702
Put him behind bars!

1401
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:44,298
Madam' why don't you say
something? She is my fiancee!

1402
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:47,100
You claim anyone
to be your fiancee!

1403
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:54,897
Brother' you had come
here to select a wife.

1404
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:58,301
Then why this charade . . .

1405
02:02:58,510 --> 02:03:00,500
of you being the servant'
and Dayal the master?

1406
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:03,901
I did all this to select a girl.

1407
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:08,699
So who did you choose'
Shobha or Sheela?

1408
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:13,901
Sister' Shobha likes Dayal.

1409
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:18,703
And Sheela loves Vijay.

1410
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:24,309
Shobha likes Dayal
thinking he is you.

1411
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:27,297
And who is Vijay?
- Dayal's younger brother.

1412
02:03:27,910 --> 02:03:30,104
Damn !
Even he is a servant's brother?

1413
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:33,303
He's doing graduation.
- So what?

1414
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:37,862
I cannot tolerate my
daughter loving a servant.

1415
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:39,701
Whether you tolerate
it or not . . .

1416
02:03:39,910 --> 02:03:42,104
ask your daughters
what they want.

1417
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:44,702
Why are you two quiet?
Speak!

1418
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:49,303
Yes' I have accepted
him as my husband.

1419
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:52,304
Even I want to marry Vijay.

1420
02:03:53,710 --> 02:03:55,745
Shut-up!
Quiet you brazen girls!

1421
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:58,903
I'll kill you both !

1422
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:02,302
See what your brother has done?

1423
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:04,904
Why don't you
marry this servant?

1424
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:08,107
Yes' I will marry Geeta.

1425
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:12,901
But I will not get my
daughters married to any servant.

1426
02:04:14,110 --> 02:04:16,304
Shobha will not marry Dayal.

1427
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:18,301
Dayal chose to be a servant.

1428
02:04:19,110 --> 02:04:21,304
But you have forced
Geeta to be a maid.

1429
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:24,300
Geeta is your
friend's daughter.

1430
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:28,426
And Dayal's father
was my father's friend.

1431
02:04:30,230 --> 02:04:32,220
As luck would have it'
my father became a rich man . . .

1432
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:36,862
whereas Dayal's father
died a poor man.

1433
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:42,500
With his death' Dayal was left
with no means to progress.

1434
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:49,305
He has worked hard to
make something of his brother.

1435
02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:52,306
I wanted to help him.

1436
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:57,308
But he became my servant
instead and supported me.

1437
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:03,268
I love Dayal more than
I would my own brother.

1438
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,700
That's absolutely true' Durga.

1439
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:12,906
Sister' I'm telling you today.
Even Dayal doesn't know this.

1440
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:17,901
I have transferred my toy factory
in Dayal and Vijay's name.

1441
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:22,899
All the income of the factory
will belong to them.

1442
02:05:25,630 --> 02:05:29,099
Master. . .
- Call me Amar.

1443
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:50,705
Mother' Dayal is a man who
is rich and compassionate.

1444
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:56,108
I ask for Shobha's hand
for my brother Dayal.

1445
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:03,301
And ask for Sheela's hand
for my younger brother Vijay.

1446
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:06,300
No. . never!

1447
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:11,458
I will never get my daughters
married to these paupers.

1448
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:13,302
I will !

1449
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:15,899
I will get Shobha
married to Dayal . . .

1450
02:06:16,190 --> 02:06:17,907
and Sheela married to Vijay.

1451
02:06:18,190 --> 02:06:21,704
Forget it! Who are you to
get my daughters married?

1452
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:26,300
Who I am? I'll have to
tell you today who I am.

1453
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:30,306
After 25 years of marriage
you ask me who I am?

1454
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:34,907
I am the father of these girls.
And your husband !

1455
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:38,460
What are you doing !
Who are you to say anything?

1456
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:41,701
I am not saying anything'
the father of these girls is.

1457
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:43,901
Your husband is saying this!

1458
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:57,100
What are you doing !
- You don't interfere.

1459
02:06:57,310 --> 02:07:02,303
What do you want? You want
Geeta to marry that rogue Jaggu?

1460
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:06,304
You want to reject
these good men's proposals?

1461
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:08,708
What are you doing !

1462
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:11,509
What I should
have done long ago.

1463
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:17,103
What do you think? I don't know
how much torture you suffered?

1464
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:21,703
I ignored everything she did'
but she thought I was meek.

1465
02:07:22,910 --> 02:07:25,707
But things have
crossed limit now.

1466
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:27,707
I'll skin her alive!

1467
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:34,701
Beat me if you like.
But please forgive her.

1468
02:07:36,270 --> 02:07:37,907
No dear' she will
seek your pardon today.

1469
02:07:38,190 --> 02:07:39,702
Come on' go ahead !

1470
02:07:43,590 --> 02:07:45,307
Please forgive me.

1471
02:07:46,110 --> 02:07:52,708
I have troubled you all'
troubled my children.

1472
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:57,702
Now' in your
happiness lies mine.

1473
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:00,306
Yes.

1474
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:09,305
''O my moonlight' rejoice! ''
