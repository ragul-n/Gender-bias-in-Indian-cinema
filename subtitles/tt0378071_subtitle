00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,669
Cheers!

2
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,506
Sir!!

3
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,907
Greetings!!

4
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,655
Sir! Madam has called you.

5
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,515
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,623
Excuse me!! I will just come!!

7
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,024
Mr. Jackson where is Thakur going?

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,467
Commissioner sir, I think
his wife has called him.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,632
Nowadays there can be
a child in their house.

10
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,765
Oh!! I see!! Jolly good.

11
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,704
From that party why
have you called me?

12
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,367
Do you know tomorrow morning...

13
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,878
...I am going to my mother's house.

14
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,540
I thought your party will
be getting over soon.

15
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,616
Thakur's party will get over
only after Thakur death.

16
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,388
And in today's party commissioner
sir has come...

17
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,550
...how can I leave
him alone and come.

18
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,752
And I!!

19
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,385
To give birth to your first child...

20
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,693
...you will go to your
father's house.

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,558
And small Thakur!!

22
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,600
Son or daughter this is all
in the hands of destiny.

23
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,768
Destiny is the servant
of this house.

24
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,405
If I want, I can make thousand
of people's destiny.

25
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,999
And destroy it also.

26
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,742
Village all well has
been dry, chief.

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,005
Children are restless
with out water.

28
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,778
Just look at my Ramu, Chief.

29
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,681
He is taking his last breath.

30
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,813
Give him water to drink.

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,482
Brothers give water to drink.

32
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,718
But where is water, chief.

33
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,086
Water! Water is not there.

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,889
I will give water to your son.

35
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,626
It's wrong, chief.
- I will give!!

36
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,500
Water! Water!!

37
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,740
What are you doing brother-in-law
your child is coming?

38
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,604
My sister is restless.

39
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,576
If we require from where
will water come.

40
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,511
He is coming, being
alive he will die.

41
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,111
Water!!

42
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,680
Take!!

43
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,722
But we have to arrange water.

44
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,955
Arre!! In Thakur's electric
well water is coming.

45
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,623
From there we will bring water.

46
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,526
Ferrari dog, with love they

47
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,833
Bablu! Paplu!! Bablu!!

48
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,474
You have so much of guts
that you have come...

49
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,910
...to Thakur's well to take water.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,546
You know that this water
is not for you.

51
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,674
Go!!

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,149
In this well all of them
have the right in it.

53
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,648
This water is not your sarkar, it's
that sarkar who makes this world.

54
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,949
Come and take water.

55
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,492
Sarkar!! To make this
world He is there...

56
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,654
...but to make a well, I am there.

57
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,164
Thakur sir in village all
over there is famine.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,794
Only in your well there is water.

59
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:59,895
Thakur sir, have mercy on us.

60
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,670
Chief, how did you have the courage
to touch the well water.

61
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:10,579
Thakur sir we are poor,
but we are human being.

62
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,741
We are not worse than dog.

63
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,944
Dogs are more faithful than you.

64
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,052
Manager from our well a single
drop of water they can't touch.

65
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,182
Yes!! Sir!!

66
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,718
You have heard it.

67
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,698
Arre what are you looking
at my face, go from here.

68
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,605
I will see who will stop
us from taking the water.

69
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,603
Come take the water.

70
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,837

We will take water.

73
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,908
Stop it!!

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,178
Madam you!!

75
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,714
Yes, go away from their way.

76
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,082
Madam what are you telling.

77
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,819
That one mother is doing
for his children.

78
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,561
From children milk...

79
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,655
...and from men nobody can
snatch water from them.

80
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,631
Madam!! Hurray!!

81
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:02,759

Mr. Jackson before they

86
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,803
...gives coldness to their veins.

87
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,239
Set ablaze that village with fire...

88
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,182
Rahim uncle!!

89
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,222

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,799
Chief there is a disaster I was
taking madam to Balarampur.

92
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:34,991
On the way she is getting trouble...

93
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,092
...she is going to give
birth to a child.

94

00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,973
Sir! Greetings!! Sir!!

100
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,109
How did you come so early, Rahim?

101
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,713
While going through the village
we had to stop the travel.

102
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,839
Why!!

103
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,846

00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,106
Your daughter!!

128
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,916
Your daughter, sir.

129
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,025
Gulabo!! Gulabo!!

130
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,364
Malka sister!! Malka sister!!

131
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,161
This daughter, Thakur sir daughter.

132
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,931
Where is my child?

133
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:34,905
By mistake Thakur sir
you're your son.

134
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,173
Where is Gulabo?

135
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,942
Where is Gulabo?

136
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,278
Gulabo she burnt and dead.

137
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:47,452
This Thakur family's God sign.

138
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,188
This is the person.

139
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,957
Arrest him.

140
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,795
Bastard, to take revenge
from Thakur...

141
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,171
...you burnt the whole colony.

142
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,879
Thakur did not give you water,
so you burnt madam alive.

143
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,278
No!! Sir!! No!! These are all wrong.

144
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,408
These are all wrong!!

145
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,886
See I have saved Thakur's daughter.

146
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,917
This is his second conspiracy.

147
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,959
Put him the handcuff, and give
the child to someone else.

148
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,989
Good!!

149
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,893
I wanted the same thing
from my legal advisor. Thank you.

150
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,930
Do you know that Adivasi bad
man was trying one more plot?

151
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,174
He was telling that by mistake
Thakur sir left his daughter.

152
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,301
And took away my son.

153
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,242
As he told this, I gave
him a tight slap.

154
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,372
Very good!!

155
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:47,043
By Thakur's witness, it is proved
that you are a criminal.

156
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:51,847
That's why in the charge of
killing Thakur sir's wife...

157
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:57,089
...alive, court is giving you
life time imprisonment.

158
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,925
No judge sir!! No!!

159
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,465
This is notjustice.

160
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,035
If you have closed your
eyes then no matter.

161
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,229
I will do the justice; I will
do it with my own hands.

162
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,867
Yourjustice can be
purchased by money...

163
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,937
...but His justice cannot
be purchased, judge.

164
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,410
See Thakur last time I help you.

165
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,952
Commissioner sir doesn't
tell last time.

166
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,452
If you will not help me than
who will do justice for us.

167
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:31,322
In your house, your
country will be free.

168
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,091
I will go to back to England.

169
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,898
But you think the person who
is inferior and low caste...

170
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,198
...he will demand his
rights from you.

171
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,071
He will go to your temple.

172
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,366
He will go to your house.

173
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,976
And they will be marrying
with your children.

174
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,175
And at that time like me
nobody will help you.

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,980
Than we will not live
in this country.

176
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,009
If you are going London, than
I will also go with you.

177
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,912
Listen! Lmmediately
make arrangements...

178
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,116
...to sell our properties.

179
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,190
Go inside!!

180
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,228
So many times you tried to
run away from the jail.

181
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,135
Every time your punishment
went on increasing.

182
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,571
And now only three months
are left for your realise.

183
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,540
After all what happens to you?

184
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,404
Jailer sir, you won't under stand.

185
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,778
I can feel the fire; one-one
moment is restless.

186
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,494
Congratulation!!

187
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,799
Congratulation!!
- Thakur sir!!

188
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,174
Our Anand has passed first
class in the university.

189
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,770
But I am happy more than you.

190
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,637
Anand!! No!! No!!

191
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,544
I mean Dr. Anand F.R.C.S.

192
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,115
From today onwards his name
will be in world's...

193
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,650
...biggest surgeon's list.

194
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,117
Why not he is from Thakur families...

195
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,347
...and in his veins my
blood is running.

196
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,547
But I have got a plan.

197
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,282
What?

198
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,258
Dr. Anand will become surgeon,
what he will do.

199
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,724
He will do treatment, operation
will do to cut and tear.

200
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,357
Why don't we use him
for world's progress?

201
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,466
World's progress, I
can't under stand it.

202
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,136
I mean to say on his name
in England and America...

203
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,638
...why don't we open
medicine factory.

204
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,199
In few days you will
become in a crore's.

205
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,245
I like your idea, I
like it very much.

206
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,745
Sir on my every idea you
have earned money.

207
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,548
Where is my son, why has
he not reached here?

208
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,680

00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,814

00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,390
...from it you have not got relief.

214
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,666

shake hands my boy.

215

families' tradition alive.

00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,703
You are a golden boy.

219
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,837
Thank you uncle!!

230
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,271
Who had kept these flowers?

231
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,842
These flowers your employee
has brought, sir.

232
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,604
For youngest sir.

233
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,281
How dare you keep these
flowers with these?

234
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,376

Today is very happiest day...

239
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,360
...that's why I am not
telling any thing.

240
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,954
Pick up this wastage.

241
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,389
Come Jackson.

242
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:22,544
Rahim uncle, you know
father before my birth.

243
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,712
Till now you must be habituated.

244
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,915
This flower place is near my heart.

245
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,424
God will give more progress
to you, sir.

246
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,696
What happened father?

247
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,934
Lolita do you know Anand
has come back.

248
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,772
This time you must
be there not here.

249
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,335
To give him congratulation
for his gold medal.

250
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,374
He has to get gold medal.

251
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,540
He is book worm.

252
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,276
That book worm is
Thakur Vikram Singh...

253
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,376
...wealth's only owner.

254
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,284
In Balarampur, he
is the only taker...

255
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,583
...of his grand father's properties.

256
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,517
I have taken hold of this father.

257
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,553
But son!!

258
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,687
Don't worry father.

259
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,561
My net is more strong
then your hold.

260
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,358
Ones anyone comes in it, he
will not be able to go out.

261
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,495
Are you sure.

262
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,464
Dead sure!!

263
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,966
What is this nonsense?

264
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,433
India's one normal doctor
has called you to India...

265
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,909
...and given you invitation
to come to India.

266
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,411
And you're ready to go.

267
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,805
Who is this doctor Pradhan?

268
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,371
He is very famous doctor father.

269
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,545
First he was teaching
in Oxford university.

270
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,386
Now a days he India's
biggest hospital dean.

271
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,388
As an ordinary surgeon he has
called me for six months.

272
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,717
This is very self respect matter.

273
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,986
Arre!! That country India what
he will give you self respect?

274
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,954
In that place if you will stay,
you will become a mad.

275
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,856
There by drinking that water...

276
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,025
...you will suffer from
cholera, Jaundice.

277
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,426
In the air, tuberculosis
germs are there.

278
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,835
Arre!! In that country there is
nothing else than sickness.

279
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,409
But father, it is the duty of a
doctor to fight with sickness.

280
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,668
In this world's goodness is there.

281
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,406
See world's goodness
will not happen.

282
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,840
Ours bad will happen.

283
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,006
How it is!!

284
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,779
I have thought of opening a
medicine hospital what about it.

285
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,419
But to build, it will
take 8 to 10 months.

286
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,613
I will come within 6 months.

287
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,416
In which country we are born
for that we have some duty.

288
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,455
Why are you not under
standing my matter?

289
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,920
I can all under stand, father.

290
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,522
But I have said them yes.

291
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,558
What?

292
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,426
I am sorry!!

293
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,927
I have made this mistake.

294
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,469
Mistake!! It's a blender!!

295
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,965
It is a foolish mistakes
how could do this.

296
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,100
How could you!!

297
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,873
But father if I will not go.

298
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,479
What will happen to Thakur
families self respect?

299
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,713
Next time they will not
believe in our words.

300
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,877
That's a point.

301
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,544
That is only the point that you
have stake our self respect.

302
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,054
That mean I have to
send you forcibly.

303
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,888
Only for 6 months.

304
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,789
Six months!! Ok!!

305
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,590
Six months not one day more.

306
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,827
You are thank you.

307
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,961
Thank you father!!

308
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,935
Ooh!! Anand!!

309
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,571
I am so happy.

310
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,773
Leave me what are you doing.

311
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:10,906
Leave me!!

312
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,675
When you have told.

313
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,882
Go you are forgetting all.

314
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,955
Until now where you were, why
you didn't come in convocation.

315
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:22,016
In temple I was lighting the
candle and praying for you.

316
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,519
You was praying in the temple
you and in temple.

317
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,821
First time I hear it.

318
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,491
For your success every
day I was doing pray.

319
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,758
Now the pray days ends.

320
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,496
Now an enjoyment day has come.

321
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,501
Now you and me we both
will go for world tour.

322
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,107
Germany, Paris, Rome, France,
Italy and all over.

323
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,537
What is your opinion about India?

324
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,048
Ssh!! Dirty place I hate it.

325
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,916
There what we will get
snake and saint.

326
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,919
If any body will give me lakh
pound I will not go there.

327
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,547
Ok!! You should not go there.

328
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,588
But I am going to India.

329
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,655
Oh!! No!!

330
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,131
Without you alone what
I will do here.

331
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,069
You do one thing, in the
temple light the candles.

332
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,636
Attention, passengers.

333
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,680
Very hearty welcome to India, sir.

334
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,711
Dr. Anand you are coming first
time in your country.

335
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,842
How are you feeling?

336
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:20,976
I am very thrilled, sir.

337
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,543
Really I am very thrilled. Good.

338
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,779
I was very eager to
see my birth place.

339
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,721
But I didn't know that a famous
doctor like you will invite me.

340
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,554
I have to come here
it's my pleasure.

341
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,891
No!! No!!
- I am very honoured, sir.

342
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,555
Arre!! This is your greatness.

343
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:37,199
It's true that India needs
doctorjust like you.

344
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,661
Sir!!

345
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,100
He is Mr. Mukherjee my class mate.

346
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,505
Only for one year, you have
gone ahead and for 4 years.

347
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,770
...I was flying away the flies.

348
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,109
Now he is my secretary.

349
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,808
Sir time is very less he
has to go to Balrampur.

350
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:51,940
Arre!! Yes!!

All the arrangement has done.

You have written it you
want to go to Balrampur.

353
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,954
I thought that you first
meet your grand father...

354
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,922
...after wards you take
the charge of hospital.

355
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,186
Sir time is very less he
has to go to Balrampur...

356
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,989
...if train will leave
he has to walk and go.

357
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,087
Come on!! Come on!!

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,236
"You and I we are lost in

A bigger blessing then this will
not be given by God also.

00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,752
See fault is not your and mine.

524
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,384
Come on I will leave you.

525
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,655

527
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,689
...than also you are
going on shouting.

528
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,062
Why do you talk so much?

529
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,191
Go and sit comfortably.

00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,695
10 kms will walk.

531
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,330

Go inside.

533
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,679
You are sleeping in this van.

Why you are not sleeping
in the house.

535
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,286
That in the house there is no place.

536
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,252
Air also smells like liquor.

537
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,423
Liquor furnace you
have in your house.

538
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,225
In my house liquor is
not been prepared.

539
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,090
Liquor consumption is there.

540
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,761
Your mother and father
are not there.

541
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,701
This you know what you will do.

542
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,265
Than also!!

543
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,501
I have no mother and father.

544
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,100
That's why I am staying
at uncle's house.

545
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,444
Every night he will drunk
and make mischief.

546
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,307
That's why I am sleeping
in this van.

547
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,233
Wickedness where you
were from morning?

548
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,708
When you will pluck the flowers
and when you will sold.

549
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,440
Your father has not left any
treasure for your meal.

550
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,584
Arre! You are not
bother of my meal...

551
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,175
...you have bother of your drink.

552
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,378
You are arguing with me.

553
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,887
Wickedness!! Where you
were from morning.

554
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,784
Where you have gone tell.

555
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,156
Tell!!

556
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,161
You don't have shame

557
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,355
Tell!!

558
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,454
Arre!! Arre!! Leave her!!

559
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,589
Leave her!!

560
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,224
What type of man you are,
raising your hand in woman?

561
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,359
You don't have shame.

562
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,561
Why don't you ask her in
which difficulty she was?

563
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,773
This poor was in difficulty
with you in this situation.

564
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,904
For that reason you came
here to help her.

565
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,770
Shut up!! What are you telling?

566
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,439
Very baseless person you are.

567
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,714
You don't think about your self
respect or others self respect.

568
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,648
Sir, who are you to talk in
between uncle and nieces.

569
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,484
He is your father!!

570
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,518
Grand child of palace's Thakur.

571
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:13,523
Sir, if this girl will ruin my self
respect for that I am asking her.

572
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,760
See this way it not good to
raise hand on a young girl.

573
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,669
Next time this should not happen.
- Sir!!

574
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:22,865
Other wise it will be very bad.

575
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,203
Not happen!! Not happen!!

576
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,241

00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,454
Wickedness, give me this purse.

580
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,354
I will not let you to touch purse.

581
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,355

I am telling you that

603
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,019
She has taken your purse.

604
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,580
Go away from my way.

605
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,316
I don't talk to robbers.

606
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,517
What are you telling, sir.

607
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,456

00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,326
But you are bad tunnel worm.

Go and enjoy robber money in fair.

What I thought and what you are?

614
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,477
Stupid!! All the man

615
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:56,350
You and I closed in the bathroom

616
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,553

621
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,364
Count it 5 rupees will be less.

622
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,374
That her uncle has spent it.

623
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,410
Instead of that she has
given these flowers.

624
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,479
Oh!! My God!!

625
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:30,644
"Dance with joy.

626
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,117
Dance by moving your body.

627
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,119
Dance by making sound
with your anklet.

628
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,718
Dance! Dance!

629
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:47,460

We are beautiful birds.

634
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:47,521
We will not remain in one branch.

635
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,193
Just as the waterfall...

636
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:56,536
...which does not make
the edges of mountains.

637
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:02,110
Today I will not let anyone sleep
nor will I sleep the whole night.

638
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:06,946
Today I will not let anyone sleep
nor will I sleep the whole night.

639
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:11,148
We will meet legs by legs
and clap hands with hands.

640
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,658
Dance! Dance!

641
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,625
Dance with joy.

Dance! Dance!

646

Those who stay in the palace.

647
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:06,268
Why does he fall us from his eyes?

648
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:15,177
I don't care he calls me a
thief or calls me ajungle.

649
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,014
Neither do I adore palace
nor do I love wealth.

650
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:25,756
Neither do I adore palace
nor do I love wealth.

651
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,994
We pluck flowers from the jungle
and make our garland.

652
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,630
Dance!

653
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:13,268
What we got to do, so that I have
to go to rich people's door.

654
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:22,184
We have seen those people,
who are poor then them.

655
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,823
They value the heart
by gold and silver.

656
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:32,420
They value the heart
by gold and silver.

657
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,154
Our treasure is just some
loving sweet words.

658
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,032
Dance!

659
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:51,705

Ramkali! I!!

663
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,968
Sir, why are you talking
with robber?

664
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,343
Ramkali listen to me.

665
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,749
Now is there anything
remaining to tell?

666
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,146
I have come to say sorry.

667
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,345
No!! Sir why are you saying sorry?

668
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,922
Tell more bad words and
quench your thirsty.

669
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,352
I am a worm of mud.

670
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,120
You are getting angry.

671
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,755
I have come to tell you
sorry by my heart.

672
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,061
If you will not for give me...

673
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:50,964
...than whole life I will feel that
I hurt one innocent girl's heart.

674
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,973
What is this Ramkali,
you are crying?

675
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,778
Have I said something wrong?

676
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,787
No!! Sir!!

677
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,788
I am crying on my destiny.

678
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,958
When I lost from my destiny.

679
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,858
Than what mistake does
anyone else have done?

680
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:14,989
No!! Ramkali!!

681
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,858
Man should never loose
from his destiny.

682
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,927
In fact with guts, he should
change his destiny.

683
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,064
These are all false.

684
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,801
Destiny does not change.

685
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,206
In which house I was born,
can that be changed?

686
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:32,075
My uncle his torturing situation,
can I change this?

687
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,485
Yes!! We can change it.

688
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,817
How!!

689
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,855
Sit! Sit no!!

690
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,823
See Ramkali you can learn
and stand in your leg.

691

Do some service, your destiny
will obviously changed.

Who will teach me?

694
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,501
No one will teach you,
than I will teach you.

695
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,002
I will teach you who to read.

696

And service also you

00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,847
Which service you will give?

698
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,846
If you come to city...

00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,283
...after studying I will give
you the job of a nurse.

700

Bombay's address.

Very beautiful.

718
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,994
My father was unnecessarily talking
this and that about India.

719
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,727
I didn't know here so good
hospitals are there.

720
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,059

...our hospital will
become very good.

722
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,063
You are doing so much praise of
me, this is your greatness.

723
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,505

No! Sir!!

730
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,449

Dr. Anand one emergency has come.

734
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,760
One prisoner got hurt and the
bullet is trapped near his heart.

735
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,696
Will you do the operation?

736
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,097
Why not, sir.

737
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,072
Good! Come!!

738
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,571
Is he a dangerous criminal?

739
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,215
No!! He is gentle man person.

740
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,678
Bullet's poison is spreading.

741
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:30,644
Immediately we have to do operation.

742
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:24,665

00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,740
...has to wait two hours for train.

749
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:06,781
Sister sees this and read my
sir address and tells me.

750
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,312
I am not an educated.

751
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,212
Than why are you looking?

752
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,818

Now whom should I ask the address?

755
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,200
You have knocked me down.
You can't see it.

756
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,401
What a wonder?

757
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,534
Greetings, beautiful!

758
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,201

Very good! Very good!

768

What a poem you have said?

769
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,195
If a beautiful girl
is in front of me...

770
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,565
...then a beautiful poem
can be said. - Yes.

At least listen to the
poem which I have made. Yes!

775
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:13,213
"She came like a dream and
incited love in my heart."

776
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,910
You have seen me alone and
you are catching my hand.

777
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,379
Don't you know me,

00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:20,714
Anarkali!!

779
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,782
Not Anarkali, Ramkali.

780
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:23,917
Don't dare you to change my name!

781
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,591
Stupid!! - Wait.

782
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,287

783
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,964
If he is Nawab or else Kabab.

784
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,692
I am not kabab, I am Nawab.

785
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,597
Don't spoil my name.

786
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,398

00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,518
Big hidden person is he.

820
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,699

00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,401

822
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:13,727
I am telling lies.

823
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,396
Do you know the meaning
of the matter?

824
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,336
You had told me come to the
city I will educate you...

825
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,535
...and make you wife.

826
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,805
Not wife I told you mid-wife.

827
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,379
Mid-wife means Mid-wife,
wife means wife.

828
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,715
Hai!! What I have done it.

829
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,910

831
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,517
...he will make me middle wife.

832
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,651
Come on!!

833
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:38,819
Where are you going let it be?

834
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,791
Genda!! Genda.

835
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,955
I am coming, sir.

836
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,561
Take her inside and arrange
for her stay. - Yes, sir. - Go.

837
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:46,693
Ok!!

838
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,428
Come with me.

839
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,377
Arre!! Where are they gone?

840
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,503
They have gone.

841
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,638
Why!!

842
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,511
They didn't want to interfere
in your romantic affair.

843
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,710
No!! No!! Not any romantic affair.

844
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,044
No romantic but affair is there.

845
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,580
No!! No!! Doctor sir
nothing is there.

846
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,685
Actually Ramkali is village
innocent girl. Yes!

847
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,517
Her uncle is drunker.

848
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,496
Daily at night he used
to drink and bit her.

849
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,435
I thought to bring her in city
and give her education.

850
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,431
After that I will give her
ajob of mid-wife or nurse.

851
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,633
That's why she was
telling about wife.

852
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,442
Very innocent girl.

853
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,410
You have thought this
very good, Anand.

854
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,846
Arrange one good lady teacher for
her, her life will be changed.

855
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,747
Teacher I don't know how many
days I have to keep her.

856
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,110
That's why I was thinking...

857
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,521
...I should admit her
to some girls hostel.

858
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,683
See Anand this is very big city...

859
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,826
...in this wolf is more
and men will be less.

860
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:50,789
If you really want to help her
than let her stay at home...

861
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,625
...and arrange one good
lady teacher for her.

862
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:55,862
Ok!! Sir!!

863
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:57,831
This is your room.

864
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,032
You will stay here.

865
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,167
Take!!

866
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:22,632
Ghost!! Ghost!!

867
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:26,799
Sir! Inside ghost!!

868
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,131
This is not ghost this is skeleton.
- Dye!!

869
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,470
I am feeling afraid.

870
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,600
Ok! Ok!

871
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:34,735
Arre!! Genda!!

872
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:35,869

873
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:37,537
Take her to another room.

874
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,772
Yes! Sir!!

875
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,040
Come with me!!

876
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,520
You will stay in this room.

877
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,990
Mother in this room
no ghost is there.

878
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,890
No here no one will come here.

879
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,019
Lock the door.

880
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:53,687
Ok!!

881
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,169
Now how will you go from here?

882
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,567
You have come in my hold.

883
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,807
Come near me.

884
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:12,980
Who are you!!

885
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,046
What you want?

886
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,714

887
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:30,795
Showing me eyes, I will
remove your eyes.

888
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,227
You will not listen like this.

889
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,805
You are showing me knife.

890
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,004
See I will show you now.

891
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,711
Hai!! Ram!! What you have done.

You have broken the T.V.

893
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:52,979

894
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,948
Where did that man go?

895
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,825

01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,438
I take care of you so much.

1072
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,376
Arre! Don't take care of me.

1073
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,376
Leave me on my condition.

1074
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:00,673
I am fed up of your care.

1075
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,808
Where are my shoes?

1076
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,409
Will take care of me?

1077
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,616
Hello! Dr. Pradhan!

1078
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:41,982
I am Genda speaking.

1079
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,992
Is sir there?
- Yes!

1080
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,351
Anand your phone from home.

1081
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,889
Sir, I am Ramkali speaking.

1082
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,696
That mother has come under the car...

1083
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,525
...she has got hurt.

1084
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:54,827
Lot of blood is coming out.

1085
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,664
Blood! Is she conscious?

1086
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,339
Yes, she is conscious.

1087
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,338
But she is lying on the
street and crying.

1088
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,501
You come quickly!

1089
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,904
Ok! You do one thing,
bring her inside.

1090
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,415
Inside the house! Ok!
I will bring just now.

1091
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,541
What happened, Anand!?

1092
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,809
Accident!!

1093
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:11,444
Any car has dashed someone
and went away.

1094
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,578
Whose accident was it?

1095
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,750
Ramkali was saying, mother.

1096
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,915
Some old lady may be.

1097
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,083
Mother! Come on let's go! - Come.

1098
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:30,564
Arre mother! Don't cry.

1099
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:31,731
The doctor has arrived.

1100
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,634
What is this nonsense?

1101
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,035
Is this my house or a zoo?

1102
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,977
You had told that mother
had an accident.

1103
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,009
She is the mother.

1104
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,947
And she her injury.

1105
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:43,643
In front of my eyes...

1106
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,380
...the truck driver dashed
her and went away.

1107
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:46,746
Am I telling lies?

1108
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:47,880
Just see!

1109
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:51,450
You see uncle!

1110
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,026
And he told that bring
mother inside.

1111
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,588
And on top of that
he is scolding me.

1112
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,664
Yes! Yes! Ramkali, it is my mistake.

1113
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,858
Forgive me and go back
to your village.

1114
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,130
World's no man can improve you.

1115
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,762
Anand! A man's pain a
man can understand...

1116
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,099
. but who can understand
the pain of an animal.

1117
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,401
He is bigger than a human being.

1118
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,536
Enough! Enough! Professor.

1119
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,671
Enough of it!

1120
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,745
By applying soap to a donkey,
it cannot be a horse.

1121
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:18,543
But a man can become a man.

1122
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,446
But she can never become
a human being.

1123
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,852
Nobody can make her human being.

1124
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,154
If he can make, then I am
ready to pick his shoes.

1125
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:28,492
Take this money and get out of here.

1126
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:36,796
Will you shut up!

1127
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,873
Junglee! You have made my
drawing room a stable.

1128
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,633
Neither she knows to
drink nor to life.

1129
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,986
He is really angry, uncle. Yes!

1130
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:53,452
Now, do I have to go from here?

1131
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,753
Take this luggage and
get out from here.

1132
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:58,517
Now we have to go.

1133
01:09:58,594 --> 01:09:59,652
Come on!

1134
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,187
I have to go!

1135
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:08,459
Uncle you make him understand.

1136
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,829
I have done a mistake.

1137
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,567
I will never do such
a mistake again.

1138
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:16,205
He is an English man; there
is no use of explaining him.

1139
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:17,603
Come on!

1140
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,738
Come!

1141
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,109
Yes! We have to go.

1142
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,955
I was mad that I told her.

1143
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,760
I will improve her future.

1144
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,162
Oh, no! It's all muddy.

1145
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:44,764
She destructed my house.

1146
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,539
Wonderful! Very good! I like it.

1147
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:51,137
Come on the model of
the factory has come.

1148
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,842
But when will the owner
of the factory come?

1149
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,182
Don't know what is there in India?

1150
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,086
Whenever I call him,
he neglects my talks.

1151
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,579
I am suspicious.

1152
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,153
I have heard that in India,
girls trap boys by magic.

1153
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,018
Lolita is also worried.

1154
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,063
No problem! Tell her she got
nothing to worry about.

1155
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,154
Tell her! I have given her my words.

1156
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,794
Anand's relation will
be with him only.

1157
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,126
He is a young boy, then also.
- Impossible!

1158
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,963
In our family, whatever I say,
only that happens, Jackson.

1159
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,731
I am calling Anand, just now.

1160
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,071
Gene! Book a call to Dr. Anand.

1161
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,205
Urgent please!

1162
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:28,841
He is alright now.

1163
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,676
You can take him now.

1164
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,118
Lots of thanks, doctor.

1165
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,191
You gave me some more life.

1166
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:37,616
Why for some days, father?

1167
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,285
You will live for many days.

1168
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,128
No! Not for many days, doctor.

1169
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:44,229
After realising from Jail, I want
to murder a sinful person.

1170
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,134
And after that I will be hanged.

1171
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:54,269
They are shooting me with
the bullet, you saved me.

1172
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,144
I have nothing to give you for this.

1173
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,915
But whatever hard work
I do in the jail.

1174
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,016
After realising from the jail,
I will give you all the money.

1175
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,587
See father! If you will take out
the behaviour of revenge...

1176
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,713
...from your heart.

1177
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:09,955
Then I will think I
have got everything.

1178
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,617
Arre! How can I take out
this feeling, doctor?

1179
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:13,753
With love everything can happen.

1180
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:16,127
It is very easy to give
the lecture of love.

1181
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,289
It is very easy.

1182
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,599
Tell me, the sinful person
who burnt my wife...

1183
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,970
...alive in the fire and put me
in the jail for false crime.

1184
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,608
How can I forgive him?

1185
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:28,834
How can I forgive him?

1186
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,603
See doctor see!

1187
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:37,046
Since 24 years I have kept
this revenge in my heart.

1188
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,347
I can't forgive him.

1189
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:43,250
And now I have to save
my son from him.

1190
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,017
Do you have a son also?

1191
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:51,925
Yes! That bad man took my son
instead of his daughter.

1192
01:12:54,636 --> 01:13:03,010
Doctor, if my son would
be with me then...

1193
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,712
Sir, you father's phone
has come from London.

1194
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,646
Ok father! After coming
out of the jail...

1195
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,708
...come to me then we will talk.

1196
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,321
Hello father! How are you?

1197
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,130
I am fine! When are you coming back?

1198
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:25,724
Your time limit is over.

1199
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:28,194
Father I have increased some time.

1200
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,034
Some of my operations are booked.

1201
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,740
Arre foolish! To start the factory,
we are waiting for you.

1202
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,278
And Jackson and Lolita
are also worried.

1203
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,806
Father, these works can wait.

1204
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,681
Here the patients need me.

1205
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,846
Anand, I am not ready to hear no.

1206
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:45,211
Father I am not refusing.

1207
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,345
I am requesting you.

1208
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:47,813
Give me some more time.

1209
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,688
After completing the important
work, I will inform you.

1210
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:51,817
You are impossible.

1211
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,285
Just take it away.

1212
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,420
Hello father!

1213
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,257
Has the phone been cut?

1214
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,691
No! Father has...

1215
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:01,827
...disconnected it. Why!?

1216
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:04,328
He wants me to come back.

1217
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,900
He wants me to get married there.

1218
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,770
And you want to remain
a bachelor like me.

1219
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,708
No! No! Sir! The matter is that...

1220
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,940
Arre! Your photograph.

1221
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,452
And whose letter is this?

1222
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,848
Whose letter is it, sir?

1223
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:25,791
Poor girl Ramkali's!

1224
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,856
She had taken your photo,
she has sent it.

1225
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:30,789
Why had she taken my photo?

1226
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:32,791
This you will not understand, Anand.

1227
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,730
Actually you are a foreigner.

1228
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,469
You will not be able to understand
an Indian girl's love.

1229
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,199
Love!

1230
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,467
Yes Anand!

1231
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,042
That girl loves you from
the bottom of your heart.

1232
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,750
From her every sight,
from her every talk...

1233
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,875
...love can be noticed.

1234
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,110
But sir!

1235
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,853
I have never seen her
with this sight.

1236
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:57,190
To look at her a person should
have such a eyes, Anand.

1237
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,919
You can only see a
heart of a person.

1238
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,759
He should not notice her
richness, poorness...

1239
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:02,888
...her caste and religion.

1240
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:04,823
But sir, I!

1241
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,958
Let it be, Anand!

1242
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,267
Whom you have removed
from your house...

1243
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,828
...you also will remove
her from your heart.

1244
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,908
In fact, what is the use of talking
about an ordinary girl?

1245
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,879
Arre! Yes! You have not heard

1246
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,005
What sir!?

1247
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,779
In our Mukherji's house
seventh child is born.

1248
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,252
Seven wonders of the Mukherji's

1249
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,988
Doctor, it is not my fault.

1250
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,257
It happened, what should I do?

1251
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,794
In the evening a party
has been given by him.

1252
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:36,922
Isn't it?

1253
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,496
Dr. Anand, you surely come.
- Please!

1254
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,531
Alright! I will be there!

1255
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:43,963
Should I keep this photo
or you will keep.

1256
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,802
No! You keep. She has given it back.

1257
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,933
Ok! Bye!

1258
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,149
Hello! Good evening everybody!

1259
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:00,145
Hello doctor!

1260
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,381
Hello!

1261
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,386
Dr. Anand why are you
sitting like this.

1262
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:05,517
Drink some whisky.

1263
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,885
Arre Waiter!

1264
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,420
Yes sir!

1265
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,895
Bring three whiskies! Yes sir!

1266
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,223
Arre Leave whisky...

1267
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,131
...here an important discussion
is going on.

1268
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,033
Anand you are a very big surgeon.

1269
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,839
In my house, the birth of
children is not stopping.

1270
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:19,965
Then do one work.

1271
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,100
What! Tell!

1272
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:22,933
You report in the police station.

1273
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,146
Dean has not come yet.

1274
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,921
How can we believe him that
old man is still a bachelor.

1275
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,848
He must have stuck in
some girl's romance.

1276
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:35,981
What are you talking, yaar?

1277
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,116
I respect him a lot.

1278
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,250
I also!

1279
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,985
Here he is!

1280
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,932
And along with him respect
is also there.

1281
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:58,175
Uncle these shoes are
creating problem.

1282
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,372
Catch my arms. Ok!

1283
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,510
Do you remember all the lessons?

1284
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:04,943
Come on!

1285
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,279
Good Evening, sir!!

1286
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,550
Good evening!! Good evening!!

01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,154
Excuse me! Please!!

1292
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,288
Sir, won't you sit on that table?

1293
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,423
No thank you!!

1294
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,557
Our table is reserved.

1295
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,958
Come!!

1296
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,400
Girls don't pull the chair.

1297
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,533
Don't pull!! It's ok!!

1298
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,633
Sit down!!

1299
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,482
What you will take?

1300
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,656
'Ragda patice', 'bhel puri', 'ussal
paw', 'missal' any thing.

1301
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,057
You won't get all these
things in this hotel.

1302
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,056
What a big third grade
hotel it's looking?

1303
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,472
Yes, here we are.

1304
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,144
Thank you!!

1305
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,449
Drink, not like this.

1306
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,580
Dash the glass.

1307
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,322
Should I dash it? It will break.

1308
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,450
Dash it.

1309
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,585
Tell cheers!!

1310
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:20,685

1311
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:22,020
Not like this!!

1312
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,155
Smile and say!!

1313
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,289
Cheers!!

1314
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,521
That's daddy cool!!

1315
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,726
Uncle, what is this devil
singing by taking stick.

1316
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,264
That is not a stick
that is a microphone.

1317
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,495
What Mia, Mica phone.

1318
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:04,336
Arre!! There is a phone
in our house also.

1319
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,265
That is telephone.

1320
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,666
This is microphone.

1321
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,543
With this we can hear sound loudly.

1322
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,614
Arre!! Without this also
I can sing more loudly.

1323
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,340
Can you sing?

1324
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,475
With lot of fun.

1325
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:17,609

1326
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:18,744
Sing!!

1327
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:24,557
No! Uncle!! That Sir will be angry.

1328
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:28,091
He will tell I am very shameless.

1329
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,160
In this society who is shameless...

1330
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,756
...only they are called modern.

1331
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,225
Than should I sing!?

1332
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:35,098
No! No!! Wait I will announce.

1333
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,637
Yes!!

1334
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,169
Daddy! Daddy cool!!

1335
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:43,602
That's daddy cool.

1336
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:44,736
Excuse me please!!

1337
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:50,112
Sir! Two minute sir!!

1338
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,652
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time...

1339
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,751
...a very good singer is with us.

1340
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,120
Would you like to hear her song?

1341
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,196
Friends, this great singer's
voice only echoed...

1342
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:13,207
...in the valley of Himalaya.

1343
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:14,701
I have bought her to Bombay.

1344
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,273
So that in this lifeless city
of cement and stones...

1345
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,780
...mountainous springs sweet
song starts echoing.

1346
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,141
Let me present to you
the great folk singer...

1347
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:36,954
"There is no peace in my body.

1348
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:42,831
There is no sleep in my eyes.

1349
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:55,110
It surrounds your attraction,
day or night.

1350
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:14,126
Just smile and talk,

1355
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:04,575
Can't bear the pain of my body.

1356
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:08,912
Lava is boiling in my heart.

1357
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:17,965
It bites me just as a
Scorpio bites anyone.

1358
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:21,867
These silk clothes.

1359
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,165
These silk clothes.

1360
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:30,202
Just keep your hand on my body.

1361
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:34,542
Just keep your hand on my body...

1362
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,210

Yes, yes! I am your beloved,

1365
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:03,070
And good luck Ramkali, carry on!

1366
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,577
Carry on!

1367
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:13,977
By seeing your handsome face...

1368
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:18,659
...it is doing all type of theft.

1369
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:27,591
What does your mischief heart know...

1370
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:31,264
...will come on which girl.

1371
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,008
Will come on which girl?

1372
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:39,744
May be someone else
will take you away.

1373
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:43,879
May be someone else
will take you away...

1374
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:46,614
...as I am you're beloved.

1375
01:23:47,021 --> 01:23:53,153

1376
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:57,826
Yes, yes! I am your beloved,
yes you're beloved.

1377
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:13,071
Young age's love is also young.

1378
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:18,141
And old age's love is quite old.

1379
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:30,187
Whoever accepts us, they
will not get any dash.

1380
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:33,896
Love increase along with age.

1381
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:38,068
Love increase along with age...

01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,972

1383
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:47,275
Just smile and talk,
as I am your beloved.

1384
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:52,052
Yes, yes! I am your beloved,
yes you're beloved.

1385
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:12,324
In young age I loved and
made this mistake.

1386
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:20,972
Who is the bad man, who
did not know your value?

1387
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:24,978
He is absolutely just
like you, yes like you.

1388
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:29,983
He is absolutely like
you, my beloved.

1389
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:38,157
Someone is just like me,
I knew this today it.

1390
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:43,423
I see your face in everyone's face.

1391
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:47,993
These eyes have become mad.

1392
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:51,004
These eyes are mad.

1393
01:26:52,340 --> 01:27:00,008
I came to know you know
how to make talks.

1394
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:04,343
You know how to make talks.

1395
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:08,185
May be a matter does not
break after being done.

1396
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:12,158
May be a matter does not
break after being done...

1397
01:27:12,226 --> 01:27:15,093
...as I am your lover.

1398
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:21,324
Just smile and talk,
as I am your beloved.

1399
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:27,830
Yes, yes! I am your beloved,

I am your beloved!!

1402
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,013
What an artist is this girl?

1403
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,147
This is called art.

1404
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:17,282
Terrific!

1405
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:18,416
From where have this doctor...

1406
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:19,551
...brought this diamond?

1407
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:21,089
As beautiful she is, she
sings more beautifully.

1408
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,220
Thank you!

1409
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:25,265
Anand! Sometime a donkey
can also be a horse.

1410
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,391
Thank you!

1411
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,401
Yes sir! And that too of
one which runs in race.

1412
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,027
Doctor! Just now a phone
came from Pune...

1413
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:32,572
...your patient Daulatram
is very serious.

1414
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,034
He will not live till
tomorrow morning.

1415
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:36,167
My God! So I have to
go to Pune just now.

1416
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,575
Daulatram is my best friend.

1417
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:40,039
Doctor! Will this Ramkali
go along with you?

1418
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,347
Arre yes! Where will
this poor girl stay?

1419
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:45,243
Anand! Can you give her some
place in your house...

1420
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:46,377
...for her to stay tonight.

1421
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:48,246
Ok sir!!

1422
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,983
Thank you! Thank you!

1423
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,116
Catch!

1424
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,250
Yes sir!

1425
01:28:52,326 --> 01:28:53,384
See my child!

1426
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:54,519
But uncle!!

1427
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,187
There is nothing to
fear like, my child.

1428
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:57,526
Today he will not remove
you from his house.

1429
01:28:58,066 --> 01:29:00,125
And by morning, I will come back.

1430
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:01,259
Ok!!

1431
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:02,393
Ok! Good night!

1432
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,528
Come Mukherji!!

1433
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,405
Let's go!

1434
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,950
Very good Mukherji! You have
done very good acting.

1435
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,080
You have also thrown what a net.

1436
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,382
Mukherji! The net is very strong.

1437
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,152
But this Anand is a
very slippery fish.

1438
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:26,454
Let's see he will be trapped or not.

1439
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:30,258
But sir, have you explained
Ramkali properly or not.

1440
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:31,389
Yes!

1441
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,093
If she will say any
improper talks then.

1442
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,192
Then the whole plan
will be disclosed.

1443
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,437
Arre! She won't do just a mistake.

1444
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:42,067
Sir! You didn't like all this.

1445
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,371
Are you too angry with me?

1446
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:52,175
Won't you talk with me ever?

1447
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,049
But it is not my fault in this.

1448
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,654
Uncle told me to do
all these things.

1449
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,123
He said that Anand is a very
pleasure loving person.

1450
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:04,494
To impress him you have
to do all this.

1451
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:06,324
Promise!

1452
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:08,196
He made me practice for two months.

1453
01:30:09,003 --> 01:30:10,994
Wear hill shoes and walk like this.

1454
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,130
Turn like this.

1455
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:13,264
Wear sari like this.

1456
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:14,399
Shake hand in this way.

1457
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:15,533
Tie your hair like this.

1458
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,134
Move your eyes in this way.

1459
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:20,070
Promise, sir! Just for you,
I have not slept properly...

1460
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:21,672
...for these two months.

1461
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,213
The whole night he would
make me practice.

1462
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:29,683
Uncle told, if you love sir
than you have to do all this.

1463
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,426
I can also live my life for you.

1464
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:34,689
But you are not happy, sir.

1465
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,356
I have made a very big mistake.

1466
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,592
No Ramkali! I have done a mistake.

1467
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,464
What!?

1468
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:48,103
I was too late to recognise you.

1469
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,303
You are diamond! A diamond!

1470
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,171
Sir!!

1471
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:58,316
You go and have rest,
you are very tired now.

1472
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,444
We will talk in the morning.

1473
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:02,380
Sir!

1474
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:07,456
What happened!?

1475
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,290
Good night!

1476
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:58,610
Why!? Don't you feel like sleeping?

1477
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,614
No!

1478
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,309
I am also not feeling sleepy.

1479
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,540
Kalia!!

1480
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:29,667
Ramkali!

1481
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:32,637
No! No!

1482
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:52,831
Anand!!

1483
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,469
Why sir, by seeing us
you are surprised?

1484
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,600
There in the village you
were acting too smart.

1485
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:04,440
You were giving big-big lectures.

1486
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,742
And you brought my girl here.

1487
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:10,175
No uncle! No one brought me here.

1488
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:11,676
I myself came here.

1489
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:16,719
Kalia! Take her away.

1490
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,759
Why you stupid!? Running
away with the girl.

1491
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,771
She is my wife.

1492
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:32,863
Is she your wife?

1493
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,198
Yes!

1494
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:35,799
That city boy has come after
us. Please save us!

1495
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:38,276
What are you telling? Come
on we will help you.

1496
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:39,404
Yes! Yes! Come!

1497
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,538
You take care of the girl...

1498
01:33:40,614 --> 01:33:41,774
...and rest of the work
I will complete here.

1499
01:35:37,598 --> 01:35:39,998
After all where have
this Anand taken her.

1500
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:42,331
He must have gone to
make his honeymoon.

1501
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,462
Mukherji! When they
are not married...

1502
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:45,596
...then how will they
do their honeymoon?

1503
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:47,470
Sir, the generation has changed.

1504
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:50,533
Now look at me, after two
children where born...

1505
01:35:50,611 --> 01:35:51,669
...I got married.

1506
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:54,337
He is not like you.

1507
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:57,680
He is not like you; he can't
be a bachelor forever.

1508
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,742
You! Go in your room and sleep.

1509
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:53,002
Sir, how did you come so soon?

1510
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:54,665
You had gone to Pune.

1511
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:56,537
That I had gone yesterday night.

1512
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:57,838
Now it's already going
to be morning.

1513
01:36:57,912 --> 01:37:00,403
So I came here straight from Pune.

1514
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:02,607
I know how much difficulty
you feel...

1515
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:03,741
...to keep Ramkali in this house.

1516
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:09,019
Yes! Yes! For my sake you
kept Ramkali in this house.

1517
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:10,880
For that lots of thanks.

1518
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,755
Tell Ramkali to get ready soon.

1519
01:37:12,826 --> 01:37:14,691
But sir! What's the hurry?

1520
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:16,555
You have come from such a far place.

1521
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:17,688
You may be tired.

1522
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:18,823
Have breakfast and then go.

1523
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:20,866
I am telling Ramkali
to make omelette.

1524
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:21,993
Omelette!

1525
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:24,697
Arre Mukherji! This man is not
that man, he is changed.

1526
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:25,830
Yes sir!!

1527
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:26,964
I feel so!

1528
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,099
Which man?

1529
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,570
That man who use to hate Ramkali.

1530
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:33,442
I never use to hate her.

1531
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:34,572
Then did you love her?

1532
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:36,878
Actually the matter is that
I misunderstood her.

1533
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:38,009
Me that!!

1534
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:40,447
Do you have the intention
of marrying her?

1535
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,579
What!?

1536
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:46,454
Yes! If you give the blessing then!

1537
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:47,824
Very good!

1538
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:50,458
You have also taken the decision
in the right time.

1539
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:52,465
Your father is coming tomorrow.

1540
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:53,795
He will be happy to hear this.

1541
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:55,793
Father is coming!

1542
01:37:55,869 --> 01:37:56,927
No! No!

1543
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:58,733
Yes! This telegram!

1544
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,671
In the hospital's address,
his telegram came.

1545
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,037
Arre! Arre! This is...

1546
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,541
Anand, are you doing
modern exercise?

1547
01:38:08,616 --> 01:38:09,742
No! No! Father is coming.

1548
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:10,875
Yes!

1549
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:12,919
And if will know about
Ramkali then...

1550
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:16,155
Then if you have loved
then why do you fear?

1551
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:19,017
I don't fear love but
I fear father's gun.

1552
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:20,484
He will shoot me.

1553
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,619
Arre no!

1554
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,692
See Thakur sir should
not suspect anything.

1555
01:38:27,935 --> 01:38:29,562
All of you have understood
your part.

1556
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:30,695
Yes sir!

1557
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:32,568
It is the examination of
everyone's capability.

1558
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:33,933
You don't worry, sir.

1559
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:35,032
We are all ready.

1560
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:36,635
But pay attention on one thing...

1561
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:40,070
...if father will suspect anything
then he will shoot.

1562
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:43,074
Don't worry, boy! We also
don't play carelessly.

1563
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,174
You are?

1564
01:38:44,518 --> 01:38:45,951
Yogipur's king, Uday Singh.

1565
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,078
And you?

1566
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:49,088
Jaslokpur's prince,
Chandrabhan Singh.

1567
01:38:49,156 --> 01:38:50,180
And you?

1568
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:51,515
Chandra Devi Maharani of Devgardh.

1569
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:52,650
Right!

1570
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:53,784
Pratapgadh's king. Shamsher Singh.

1571
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:09,734
Suddenly I got your telegram.

1572
01:39:10,077 --> 01:39:11,738
I have come here leaving
an important operation.

1573
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:13,006
I was quite worried.

1574
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,547
I am worried, son.

1575
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:15,673
Since you are gone...

1576
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:16,807
...you were not taking the
name of coming back.

1577
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:17,942
That's why I had to come forcibly.

1578
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:19,610
Jackson and Lolita
were also with me.

1579
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:20,745
Where are there?

1580
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:21,879
They are in the custom lawn...

1581
01:39:21,955 --> 01:39:23,013
...they are clearing their luggage.

1582
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:24,682
And I have come to take you.

1583
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:26,225
You do your preparations
and come with us.

1584
01:39:26,827 --> 01:39:27,885
But father!

1585
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:29,690
But- Vat nothing! There
are many work held up.

1586
01:39:29,763 --> 01:39:30,821
The factory is also ready.

1587
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,968
And Jackson is forcing
to the marriage.

1588
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,229
But what is the hurry of marriage?

1589
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:37,695
I have not thought
about this matter.

1590
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:39,705
Son, in our family the
matter of marriage...

1591
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:40,899
...is thought by elders.

1592
01:39:40,974 --> 01:39:42,032
Children don't think about it.

1593
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:43,167
Arre! Princess has arrived.

1594
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:48,639
Your highness!

1595
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:51,150
Today your first appointment
in the Taj hotel.

1596
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:52,708
And your second appointment is with

1597
01:39:52,786 --> 01:39:54,777
...the general manager
of shipping company.

1598
01:39:54,855 --> 01:39:55,913
Thank you!!

1599
01:39:58,992 --> 01:40:00,584
Our state welcomes you.

1600
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:01,923
Thank you!

1601
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:04,789
Hello!

1602
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:07,259
Princess welcome!

1603
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:17,272
Princess, I had sent you
a letter in your favour.

1604
01:40:17,544 --> 01:40:18,602
For donation.

1605
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:19,873
Yes! Yes! That building
is being made for that.

1606
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,743
You give him Rs.1lakh.

1607
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:23,840
In the evening you come
in the palace...

1608
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:25,009
...and take the cheque
from Mr. Pandit.

1609
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:26,677
Thanks a lot!

1610
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:27,812
Hye Anand!

1611
01:40:27,888 --> 01:40:29,048
Hye!!

1612
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:30,816
You and here!

1613
01:40:31,058 --> 01:40:32,286
What are you doing in India?

1614
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:33,890
When did you come from London?

1615
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:35,019
Few months ago!

1616
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:36,289
And I don't even know it.

1617
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:39,123
I am tired of writing letters
to the University.

1618
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:41,733
And queen also was remembering
you too much.

1619
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:43,827
With the help you had done
during her operation...

1620
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,031
...due to that happiness, she
gave you this diamond.

1621
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:47,904
It cost Rs.1.50 lakhs.

1622
01:40:47,975 --> 01:40:49,033
Bad manners!

1623
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:50,940
Present are things of sentiments.

1624
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:52,069
It has no value.

1625
01:40:52,146 --> 01:40:53,204
I am sorry, your highness.

1626
01:40:53,781 --> 01:40:54,839
Take this Anand.

1627
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:57,139
You never accept anything from me.

1628
01:40:57,918 --> 01:40:59,852
You show off your father's wealth.

1629
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:02,080
But this is sent by mother.

1630
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:04,048
But your highness.

1631
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:07,124
See, in this matter we have
fought so many times.

1632
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:09,185
That you will not call
me your highness.

1633
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:12,023
For you I am only Sanjogta,
only Sanjogta!

1634
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:13,157
Ok! Alright!

1635
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,666
But Sanjogta that...

1636
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:16,202
See if you don't want to take,
then don't take.

1637
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:18,729
I will tell mother that
Anand's intelligence...

1638
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:19,966
...has gone to high.

1639
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,268
Anand, you should do like this.

1640
01:41:21,608 --> 01:41:23,041
It's not done! You should accept it.

1641
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,168
What is his introduction?

1642
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,973
Why is he interfering in our matter?

1643
01:41:26,046 --> 01:41:27,343
He is my father.

1644
01:41:28,115 --> 01:41:30,675
O! I am glad to meet you.

1645
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,343
Entirely my privilege,
your highness.

1646
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:38,155
Anand, you should accept it.

1647
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:39,283
Ok father!

1648
01:41:39,626 --> 01:41:40,684
Thank you!!

1649
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:41,819
Your highness, the time of
your going has arrived.

1650
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:43,089
Sir is waiting
for you for lunch.

1651
01:41:43,697 --> 01:41:45,824
Offf Oh! Why do you take
so many appointments?

1652
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:48,094
Why don't you call them
for tomorrow's party?

1653
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:49,226
Yes!

1654
01:41:49,303 --> 01:41:50,770
Yes Anand! Tomorrow we
are having a party.

1655
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:51,896
You surely have to come.

1656
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:54,907
And Thakur sir, I will
be happy if you come.

1657
01:41:54,975 --> 01:41:57,102
In fact, you bring
your friends also.

1658
01:41:57,177 --> 01:41:58,235
Thank you!

1659
01:41:58,312 --> 01:41:59,370
Ok! Bye!

1660
01:41:59,646 --> 01:42:00,704
Bye! Bye!

1661
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:16,053
Who is she!?

1662
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:18,993
Father, she is the princess
of Gulabgardh.

1663
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:20,124
Gulabgardh!!

1664
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,258
Yes!

1665
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:22,734
Thakur sir! Greetings!

1666
01:42:23,003 --> 01:42:24,300
Greetings Nawab sir!

1667
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:25,861
You have come after so many years...

1668
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:26,997
...I welcome you.

1669
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:28,132
Thank you very much, Nawab sir!

1670
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:30,073
I am sorry to be late; actually
I was coming out...

1671
01:42:30,143 --> 01:42:33,169
But in the path a poem was
made and I sat there.

1672
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:35,339
You know everything, I am sorry.

1673
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:37,274
You went abroad and forgot us.

1674
01:42:37,885 --> 01:42:39,318
Son, say greetings to Nawab uncle.

1675
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:40,751
Greetings Nawab uncle.

1676
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:41,947
Your son!

1677
01:42:42,022 --> 01:42:45,082
Son, you have got what
beautiful height.

1678
01:42:45,158 --> 01:42:47,149
Beautiful girls are being
flattered on you.

1679
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:49,752
Yes! Absolutely! Just now
I have seen a sight.

1680
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:50,888
Father!

1681
01:42:50,964 --> 01:42:53,023
Nowadays, he is sitting between...

1682
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,158
...high standard people.

1683
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:55,292
Why not! Why not!

1684
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,961
Tomorrow night you sure
come in our place.

1685
01:42:57,037 --> 01:42:58,095
I will introduce to
you to a princess.

1686
01:42:58,171 --> 01:42:59,900
Of course! I will surely come.

1687
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:01,031
You told that after reaching
India we will be married.

1688
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:02,166
Of course it will happen.

1689
01:43:02,242 --> 01:43:03,300
Hye Jackson!

1690
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:04,435
Hye! Hye!

1691
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:05,837
Hello!

1692
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:06,971
Greetings!

1693
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:09,113
Arre! Introduce me, who are they?

1694
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,108
He is prince Devendra Singh.

1695
01:43:12,786 --> 01:43:15,254
He is the king of Vilaspur,
Raj Bahadur.

1696
01:43:15,322 --> 01:43:16,380
How do you do?

1697
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:18,856
And he is Jaslokpur's prince...

1698
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:20,416
...prince Chandrabhan Singh.

1699
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:21,853
Your highness!

1700
01:43:23,063 --> 01:43:26,362
You are the queen of Ramgadh,
Chandradevi.

1701
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:27,457
Hello!

1702
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:29,199
How do you do?

1703
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:31,237
And he is the Nawab
of Samundrabadh...

1704
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:32,465
...Turkaman Ali Begh.

1705
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:33,865
Greetings!

1706
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:34,999
It's alright...

1707
01:43:35,075 --> 01:43:37,407
...otherwise the kingdom
has gone with my father.

1708
01:43:37,945 --> 01:43:41,403
What is there Nawab sir, today
also you are present.

1709
01:43:44,818 --> 01:43:46,410
Princess Sanjogta!

1710
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,158
Your highness!

1711
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,365
Greeting Nawab uncle!

1712
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:09,336
Bless you, child! May you live long?

1713
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:10,433
Thank you, Thakur sir.

1714
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:12,973
By coming here, you have raised...

1715
01:44:13,046 --> 01:44:14,343
...the brightness of the party.

1716
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:15,972
Your highness, your invitation...

1717
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:17,983
...is the matter of pride for me.

1718
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:19,382
Where is Anand?

1719
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:21,445
Anand! There!

1720
01:44:23,123 --> 01:44:25,853
Oh! Excuse me!

1721
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,453
Hello! Hello!

1722
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:33,190
Hello Mr. Anand!

1723
01:44:33,266 --> 01:44:34,494
Yes Princess!

1724
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:35,859
How are you?

1725
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:36,994
Fine!

1726
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:40,369
I think that you are feeling
quite bore in my party.

1727
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,498
O No!

1728
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:42,866
I was talking to...

1729
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:45,104
He is Mr. Jackson,
our legal advisor.

1730
01:44:45,178 --> 01:44:46,236
Greetings!

1731
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:48,144
And she is his daughter, Lolita.

1732
01:44:48,215 --> 01:44:49,273
Hello!

1733
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:50,407
Hello!

1734
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:53,016
Yes Anand! Today morning I
had talked to the queen...

1735
01:44:53,086 --> 01:44:54,485
...on the phone in Paris.

1736
01:44:55,022 --> 01:44:56,114
Again she is having cold.

1737
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:58,357
Again she is having cold.

1738
01:44:58,425 --> 01:45:01,019
In this matter, it's very
important to take advice.

1739
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:02,152
Come! Come!

1740
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:03,287
Excuse me!

1741
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:04,421
Again she is having cold.

1742
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:09,093
Until now everything is
going fine, isn't it?

1743
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,096
Afterwards also, everything
will be fine.

1744
01:45:18,178 --> 01:45:19,236
Hello pretty girl!

1745
01:45:19,312 --> 01:45:20,370
Hye!

1746
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:22,438
I am called Chandrabhan Singh
of Jaslok hospital...

1747
01:45:22,516 --> 01:45:24,040
...no! No! I mean Jaslokpur.

1748
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:25,345
Prince of Jaslokpur!

1749
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:27,377
I am Lolita!

1750
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:28,512
Hello!

1751
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:34,353
I have not seen you
in anyone's party.

1752
01:45:34,428 --> 01:45:35,918
I came yesterday from London.

1753
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,054
From London!

1754
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,188
Yes!

1755
01:45:38,265 --> 01:45:39,323
How romantic!

1756
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:40,457
Hello prince!

1757
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:41,592
Hello!

1758
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:43,199
Don't you have a drink in your hand?

1759
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:44,328
No, thank you!

1760
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:45,462
Waiter!

1761
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:46,597
Yes queen!

1762
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:48,265
Queen!

1763
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:50,002
Of Pratapgadh.

1764
01:45:50,077 --> 01:45:51,339
O! Greetings!

1765
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:54,471
Who is this boy?

1766
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:57,082
He is too stuck to the princess.

1767
01:45:58,218 --> 01:45:59,549
I have heard that he is a doctor.

1768
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:02,444
He is too friendly
with the princess.

1769
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:06,091
What nonsense! What
generation is this?

1770
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,024
In the party of king and queen...

1771
01:46:08,095 --> 01:46:09,357
...an ordinary doctor is called.

1772
01:46:12,432 --> 01:46:14,024
Don't you know him Nawab sir?

1773
01:46:14,234 --> 01:46:16,031
He is our Dr. Anand.

1774
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:17,297
He is the son of Thakur sir.

1775
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:21,031
That's why I am saying
by his style...

1776
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:23,167
...we can know his elegance.

1777
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:25,040
He may be from a big family.

1778
01:46:25,412 --> 01:46:28,176
Yes, we also are related
to Suryavanshi family.

1779
01:46:28,515 --> 01:46:30,244
Very good! Very good!

1780
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:32,112
May the evil eye be far removed?

1781
01:46:32,185 --> 01:46:33,243
He looks so handsome.

1782
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,411
Please introduce me to him.

1783
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:37,449
Why not! Why not! Come!

1784
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:39,583
They are coming here.

1785
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:42,119
Which conspiracy is this?

1786
01:46:43,196 --> 01:46:45,255
It may be Mukherji's new plot.

1787
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:50,262
Son, meet him.

1788
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:53,063
He is Nawab Turkaman Ali
Begh of Samundrabadh.

1789
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,334
He was praising you too much.

1790
01:46:54,407 --> 01:46:55,465
Thank you!

1791
01:46:55,542 --> 01:46:59,342
This face and style cannot
be seen in a high family.

1792
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:02,506
Nawab uncle, you are
only praising him.

1793
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:04,072
Is there nothing in me?

1794
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:07,314
I was going to say, can
anyone praise sun.

1795
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:11,081
You are a moon, your
beauty as well as...

1796
01:47:11,158 --> 01:47:12,216
...your behaviour is excellent.

1797
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:15,420
On that her voice is excellent.

1798
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:18,692
Really! Then sing a
lovely song for us.

1799
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:22,226
O no, uncle! Nawab uncle
is just saying like this.

1800
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:24,327
I just murmur something.

1801
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:26,096
Are you married?

1802
01:47:26,173 --> 01:47:27,231
No!

1803
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:28,467
O! How lucky I am?

1804
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:29,702
I am also not married.

1805
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:31,238
Let's have a drink.

1806
01:47:34,481 --> 01:47:35,539
Saw Thakur sir!

1807
01:47:36,316 --> 01:47:37,715
By getting the signal, she said yes.

1808
01:47:38,585 --> 01:47:40,644
Is the matter of their
marriage fixed?

1809
01:47:40,987 --> 01:47:42,477
No! Still now there
is no such matter.

1810
01:47:42,556 --> 01:47:44,456
If it is not done then go
ahead with this matter.

1811
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:47,459
Everyday fortune does
not knock the doors.

1812
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:51,462
I was saying that your son
has already done his work.

1813
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:53,328
Now the other work is yours.

1814
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:57,129
Is this possible?

1815
01:47:58,071 --> 01:48:00,733
Her secretary, Pandit
Dayashankar Kaur...

1816
01:48:01,007 --> 01:48:02,269
...you impress him.

1817
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:06,067
Only this man can turn
impossible to possible.

1818
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:11,143
Mirza Nawab Bahadur, Daulawalia...

1819
01:48:11,218 --> 01:48:12,480
...Riyasat Danepur.

1820
01:48:14,554 --> 01:48:16,146
Come Nawab sir!

1821
01:48:16,223 --> 01:48:17,281
What is your introduction?

1822
01:48:17,357 --> 01:48:18,415
This simple person is known as...

1823
01:48:18,491 --> 01:48:19,549
...Pandit Dayashankar Kaur.

1824
01:48:19,626 --> 01:48:21,218
This simple man is called as...

1825
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:23,159
Who doesn't know you?

1826
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:24,288
Come!

1827
01:48:24,364 --> 01:48:25,422
Thakur sir has already come.

1828
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:28,425
Sir!

1829
01:48:28,501 --> 01:48:29,627
Greetings!

1830
01:48:30,303 --> 01:48:33,101
Pandit sir! Introduce
me to the host.

1831
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:35,471
You please wait here; I will
just inform the princess.

1832
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:38,502
Your highness, Nawab Daulawalia...

1833
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:39,636
...wants to meet you.

1834
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:45,174
Nawab sir, I think
here we can talk...

1835
01:48:45,252 --> 01:48:46,480
...about Anand's marriage.

1836
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:49,386
Really! Very good! This
is indeed very good news.

1837
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:51,117
Congratulations in advance.

1838
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:55,322
Nawab sir, her highness
princes Sanjogta.

1839
01:49:11,478 --> 01:49:13,810
You are princess Sanjogta.

1840
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,206
Yes!

1841
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:16,340
Yes!

1842
01:49:17,684 --> 01:49:20,152
Have you seen me before?

1843
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,278
No!

1844
01:49:21,354 --> 01:49:22,412
No!

1845
01:49:25,358 --> 01:49:27,417
You look after him,
I am coming just now.

1846
01:49:27,494 --> 01:49:28,552
I will come just now.

1847
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:34,292
Wait! Princess Sanjogta!?

1848
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:37,361
Yes!

1849
01:49:38,305 --> 01:49:40,364
I am reminding you, that
where have I seen you?

1850
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,839
You must have seen her in Paris.

1851
01:49:42,108 --> 01:49:43,769
Yes, you must have
seen her in Paris.

1852
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:45,168
No! Not in Paris.

1853
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,303
I have seen her somewhere here.

1854
01:49:46,379 --> 01:49:47,505
And that too before two
or four months before.

1855
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,572
Nawab sir, you clean your specks.

1856
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:53,175
Princess has come to India
after seven years.

1857
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,311
And yesterday itself...

1858
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:55,445
...she landed in front
of me from the plane.

1859
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:56,648
My specks are clean but
the matter is not clear.

1860
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:59,715
Somewhere else there is
some kind of fault.

1861
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:02,654
I remember slightly, where
I have seen her.

1862
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:03,787
Where have I seen her?

1863
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:07,330
Your highness wants
to speak to you...

1864
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,458
...regarding some business.

1865
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:09,593
Of course!

1866
01:50:10,337 --> 01:50:11,565
Yes! I am remembering you.

1867
01:50:12,205 --> 01:50:14,332
Before two or four months,
I have seen her...

1868
01:50:14,407 --> 01:50:15,465
...on the platform.

1869
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:19,273
Princess was may be
in some fancy dress.

1870
01:50:19,346 --> 01:50:20,506
In the railway station!?

1871
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:23,208
Princess and that too
in an ordinary station.

1872
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:25,843
Arre sir! For her special
trains are arranged.

1873
01:50:26,152 --> 01:50:27,210
Special trains!

1874
01:50:28,221 --> 01:50:29,586
Are you trying to fool me?

1875
01:50:29,656 --> 01:50:32,420
I think in this matter there
is lot of confusion.

1876
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:33,686
In this surely there is
some deep conspiracy.

1877
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,489
I am telling you what
is the real matter?

1878
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:36,620
Come there!

1879
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:38,288
Yes, just come here.

1880
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,358
Listen son!

1881
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:43,560
She is not a princess.

1882
01:50:43,636 --> 01:50:45,695
She is an illiterate village girl.

1883
01:50:45,772 --> 01:50:48,297
By saying two words of
English as yes and no...

1884
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:49,433
...a crow does not become a sawn.

1885
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:51,670
Uncle, he is confusion.

1886
01:50:51,745 --> 01:50:52,803
Why!

1887
01:50:52,879 --> 01:50:54,676
I had beaten this Nawab
on the station.

1888
01:50:55,248 --> 01:50:56,840
This stupid knows me.

1889
01:50:57,183 --> 01:50:58,309
Really!

1890
01:50:58,385 --> 01:50:59,443
Don't worry!

1891
01:50:59,519 --> 01:51:01,316
For sometime you try
to hold the party.

1892
01:51:01,388 --> 01:51:02,514
I will take care of him.

1893
01:51:02,589 --> 01:51:03,647
Ok!

1894
01:51:03,723 --> 01:51:05,714
Son! I know her reality very well.

1895
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:07,726
She can't speak properly in English.

1896
01:51:07,794 --> 01:51:09,455
They are trying to fool you.

1897
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:11,929
Nawab Sir! Now it's too much.

1898
01:51:12,265 --> 01:51:15,257
You are our guest, I can insult you.

1899
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:17,326
But I can give you the permission
to insult anyone.

1900
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:19,596
Whom you are saying illiterate
and village girl...

1901
01:51:19,672 --> 01:51:21,867
...she can speak eight
languages fluently.

1902
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:23,402
She can also say poem.

1903
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:25,335
This you are telling me.

1904
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:26,709
Go and say someone else.

1905
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:28,338
Nawab sir, he is telling the truth.

1906
01:51:28,415 --> 01:51:29,643
You are highly mistaken.

1907
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:31,411
Mistaken! How can Nawab Daulawalia...

1908
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:32,951
...make mistakes about girls.

1909
01:51:33,219 --> 01:51:34,277
From when do you know her?

1910
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:36,413
Since seven to eight years.

1911
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:37,786
May the evil eye be far removed?

1912
01:51:37,857 --> 01:51:38,949
Since seven to eight years.

1913
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:42,424
That means along with them...

1914
01:51:42,495 --> 01:51:44,588
...you are trying to fool Thakur sir.

1915
01:51:44,731 --> 01:51:46,858
But son, I won't let this happen.

1916
01:51:46,933 --> 01:51:47,957
I am going just now...

1917
01:51:48,234 --> 01:51:49,292
...and telling Thakur
sir to be careful.

1918
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,427
There is surely some confusion.

1919
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:51,561
Nawab sir.

1920
01:51:53,740 --> 01:52:00,703
"Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1921
01:52:01,448 --> 01:52:05,509
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1922
01:52:05,585 --> 01:52:06,643
It is difficult!

1923
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:11,850
May be the whole matter
will be disclosed.

1924
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:17,596
May be the whole matter
will be disclosed.

1925
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:23,528
Eager sight may drown us.

1926
01:52:24,337 --> 01:52:29,468
Eager sight may drown us.

1927
01:52:29,776 --> 01:52:34,804
May be it will take
you along with me.

1928
01:52:35,548 --> 01:52:40,485
May be it will take
you along with me.

1929
01:52:41,354 --> 01:52:45,791
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1930
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:47,827
It is difficult!

1931
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:27,060
I have put the boat of emotions
on the situation.

1932
01:53:35,408 --> 01:53:40,471
I have put the boat of emotions...

1933
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:45,416
...on the edge of situation.

1934
01:53:48,688 --> 01:53:53,990
May don't the situation
turn its face.

1935
01:53:57,697 --> 01:54:02,634
May don't the situation
turn its face.

1936
01:54:02,869 --> 01:54:08,034
May be our emotions
will have to die.

1937
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:13,805
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1938
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:18,908
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1939
01:54:18,985 --> 01:54:21,044
It is difficult!

1940
01:54:45,745 --> 01:54:50,739
Just as we went of till now.

1941
01:54:51,484 --> 01:54:56,683
In the same way may it
goes on just like that.

1942
01:54:56,756 --> 01:55:01,750
Just as we went of till now.

1943
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:07,091
Just as we went of till now.

1944
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:13,569
In the same way may it
goes on just like that.

1945
01:55:16,042 --> 01:55:21,810
To come near the main path

1946
01:55:24,851 --> 01:55:30,050
To come near the main path...

1947
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:35,788
...just see the heart gets separated.

1948
01:55:35,962 --> 01:55:41,525
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1949
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:46,738
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1950
01:55:46,806 --> 01:55:48,535
It is difficult!

1951
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:13,758
In this path, don't know how many...

1952
01:56:15,835 --> 01:56:25,836
...till now just like these
difficulties is yet to come.

1953
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:32,078
In this path, don't know how many...

1954
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:37,656
...till now just like these
difficulties is yet to come.

1955
01:56:40,927 --> 01:56:46,593
The game of love which
we have already won.

1956
01:56:49,736 --> 01:56:54,969
The game of love which
we have already won.

1957
01:56:55,041 --> 01:57:00,206
Does not get check and mate.

1958
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:05,817
Now it is difficult
to hide the secret.

1959
01:57:05,885 --> 01:57:06,943
It is difficult!

1960
01:57:07,019 --> 01:57:11,046
May be the whole matter
will be disclosed.

1961
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:16,895
May be the whole matter
will be disclosed.

1962
01:57:17,163 --> 01:57:22,157
"Eager sight may drown me."

1963
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:23,960
Where are you taking me?

1964
01:57:25,104 --> 01:57:27,698
What is the matter?
- What are you doing, in this party?

1965
01:57:27,774 --> 01:57:28,832
What in the party?

1966
01:57:29,108 --> 01:57:30,700
A beggar is presented
like a princess.

1967
01:57:30,777 --> 01:57:31,971
And you are telling me that
I am spoiling the party.

1968
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:33,305
Slowly sir! Slowly!

1969
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:36,112
Should I tell you a family secret?

1970
01:57:36,649 --> 01:57:37,980
Family secret!
- Yes!

1971
01:57:38,184 --> 01:57:39,242
Hers!
- Yes!

1972
01:57:39,652 --> 01:57:40,778
Promise!
- Yes!

1973
01:57:42,722 --> 01:57:45,054
Come! Tell! What is that secret?

1974
01:57:45,591 --> 01:57:47,855
This secret is not to be said,
it is to be shown.

1975
01:57:47,927 --> 01:57:49,861
If it is to be seen then
I will see tomorrow.

1976
01:57:49,929 --> 01:57:52,659
Sir, we will see today and
will be unconscious today.

1977
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:53,790
What are you talking, sir?

1978
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,058
When I see a beautiful face...

1979
01:57:55,134 --> 01:57:58,069
...neither do I get unconscious
nor do I forget.

1980
01:57:58,337 --> 01:57:59,599
I remember very nicely that
I had seen that girl...

1981
01:57:59,672 --> 01:58:01,333
...in a village girls dress.

1982
01:58:01,674 --> 01:58:03,198
Yes! Now I understood.

1983
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:05,671
You must have seen Ramkali.

1984
01:58:06,679 --> 01:58:07,737
Yes!

1985
01:58:08,948 --> 01:58:10,006
Ramkali!
- Yes!

1986
01:58:10,216 --> 01:58:11,274
Who have reminded me
exactly the same?

1987
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:12,612
Yes, she is that girl.
- Now itself I will go...

1988
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:14,880
...and tell the whole
story to Thakur sir.

1989
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:16,285
Wait a bit! Come here!

1990
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:18,816
She is not Ramkali!

1991
01:58:19,225 --> 01:58:20,817
Ramkali is her sister.

1992
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,354
Sister! What do you mean?

1993
01:58:22,962 --> 01:58:26,159
This is the family secret,
which I want to show you.

1994
01:58:26,232 --> 01:58:28,223
Very good! Then let's go!

1995
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,228
From Guladgadh you brought me...

1996
01:58:32,305 --> 01:58:33,363
...to the horse stable.

1997
01:58:33,706 --> 01:58:34,764
Are your intentions right?

1998
01:58:34,907 --> 01:58:36,841
Don't get afraid and see the drama.

1999
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,914
Daughter Ramkali!

2000
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:54,383
Say uncle! How come you are here?

2001
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:04,993
Stupid! How did you come here?

2002
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:08,666
Daughter, I brought me here.

2003
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:09,799
You make her understand.

2004
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:11,673
O Mr. Nawab, have you forgotten...

2005
01:59:11,744 --> 01:59:12,870
...the beating in the station.

2006
01:59:13,212 --> 01:59:14,736
Now again should I beat you.

2007
01:59:15,214 --> 01:59:16,272
What are you telling?

2008
01:59:16,749 --> 01:59:17,807
He is our guest.

2009
01:59:17,884 --> 01:59:19,749
Take away your guest from here.

2010
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:21,753
Otherwise I will beat him again.

2011
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:22,947
Run away!

2012
01:59:23,022 --> 01:59:24,956
Self respect is in danger, run.

2013
01:59:34,967 --> 01:59:36,025
Mr. Pandit Dayashankar.

2014
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:37,160
Yes!

2015
01:59:37,236 --> 01:59:39,227
Now we should change this
friendship to relationship.

2016
01:59:40,106 --> 01:59:41,767
And this work can be
done by only you.

2017
01:59:41,841 --> 01:59:43,172
The work is little difficult
Thakur sir...

2018
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:44,971
...but I can try my best.

2019
01:59:45,244 --> 01:59:47,371
I know that you have the solution
for all the problems.

2020
01:59:48,047 --> 01:59:50,174
And I have heard that the
queen never says no to you.

2021
01:59:51,717 --> 01:59:54,709
And I have written some
of the share of London...

2022
01:59:54,787 --> 01:59:56,254
...in your name.

2023
01:59:56,789 --> 01:59:57,847
Really!

2024
01:59:58,057 --> 02:00:00,992
If you have done so many things
on this simple man...

2025
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:02,254
...then I have to do this work.

2026
02:00:03,262 --> 02:00:05,924
But once they say yes,
and then don't be late.

2027
02:00:05,998 --> 02:00:07,056
Then for what we will be late.

2028
02:00:07,133 --> 02:00:08,191
Quickly we will do the engagement...
and then the marriage.

2029
02:00:09,135 --> 02:00:10,466
You are very intelligent,
Thakur sir.

2030
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:13,470
I am talking in the phone to
the queen in Paris just now.

2031
02:00:14,073 --> 02:00:15,938
And once I get the news,
I will inform you.

2032
02:00:16,008 --> 02:00:17,066
You are very kind.

2033
02:00:21,347 --> 02:00:22,871
What are you doing, Thakur sir?

2034
02:00:23,282 --> 02:00:25,477
Anand's marriage has
been fixed to Lolita.

2035
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:26,944
Talk in senses Jackson.

2036
02:00:27,019 --> 02:00:28,486
Where is Lolita and where
is the princess.

2037
02:00:28,821 --> 02:00:29,879
If I will get such a big relation...

2038
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:31,014
...then should I leave it.

2039
02:00:31,424 --> 02:00:33,016
Then what will happen to Lolita?

2040
02:00:33,292 --> 02:00:35,954
Jackson, you yourself have
taught me one thing.

2041
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:38,155
By giving money, we can buy
anything of this world.

2042
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:40,362
I will spend five to seven lakhs...

2043
02:00:40,433 --> 02:00:43,231
...and will find a small
prince among them.

2044
02:00:44,103 --> 02:00:45,161
That's alright, but!

2045
02:00:45,237 --> 02:00:47,296
Listen! You don't fear.

2046
02:00:47,907 --> 02:00:49,306
I will arrange your
daughter's marriage.

2047
02:00:52,244 --> 02:00:53,836
Nawab uncle, you and here.

2048
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:57,508
Yes son, I was watching the palace.

2049
02:00:58,317 --> 02:01:01,377
Nawab uncle, didn't
you like my song?

2050
02:01:01,454 --> 02:01:03,854
No! No! I liked the song
very much, child.

2051
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:05,116
Actually it happened that...

2052
02:01:07,126 --> 02:01:09,458
You were trying to remind
me something.

2053
02:01:09,795 --> 02:01:12,787
Yes! Whatever I wanted
to remind you...

2054
02:01:12,865 --> 02:01:16,858
...that Nawab TurkamanAli
Begh reminded me.

2055
02:01:18,137 --> 02:01:21,129
Let us sit with the old man
and let the children play.

2056
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:32,411
Today, you are being realised.

2057
02:01:32,885 --> 02:01:35,012
When you came here, these
things were with you.

2058
02:01:35,154 --> 02:01:36,212
Just look at it.

2059
02:01:36,956 --> 02:01:40,289
And yes, this is the wage of
the work you did in the jail.

2060
02:01:42,428 --> 02:01:43,486
Give your thump mark.

2061
02:01:46,032 --> 02:01:48,364
And this locket was found
from your pocket.

2062
02:01:56,442 --> 02:01:57,500
Congratulation for the engagement.

2063
02:01:57,576 --> 02:01:59,908
Congratulations!!
- Congratulations!!

2064
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:01,105
Congratulations, Thakur sir!!

2065
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:03,375
Congratulations, Thakur sir!!

2066
02:02:06,052 --> 02:02:11,388
"Hurray! We have won the game.

2067
02:02:13,325 --> 02:02:15,259
We have won the game.

2068
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:19,054
How was the plan?

2069
02:02:21,067 --> 02:02:23,126
Our plan was excellent.

2070
02:02:23,936 --> 02:02:26,871
Very good uncle and niece...

2071
02:02:26,939 --> 02:02:29,999

2072
02:02:30,209 --> 02:02:31,403

We have won the game.

Have seen what this world is?

2078
02:03:20,993 --> 02:03:23,985
And what are the people
of this world?

2079
02:03:24,997 --> 02:03:26,931
With the golden key...

2080
02:03:26,999 --> 02:03:31,993
...everyone's lock of
heart can be opened.

2081
02:03:32,404 --> 02:03:33,928
Whoever knows this secret...

2082
02:03:34,006 --> 02:03:36,133
...only he can put everyone
in his pocket.

2083
02:03:36,408 --> 02:03:38,137
Whoever knows this secret...

2084
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:40,201

We have won the game.

2090
02:04:34,667 --> 02:04:38,467
The difference in caste and
the fight of religion.

2091
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:41,401
All these matters are
only to be said.

2092
02:04:42,675 --> 02:04:46,270
The one who has more money...

2093
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:49,542
...only that person's
caste is very big.

2094
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:52,014
Arre! In the front goes money...

2095
02:04:52,084 --> 02:04:54,075
...and after that all
the groom's people.

2096
02:04:54,286 --> 02:04:56,015
Arre! In the front goes money...

2097
02:04:56,088 --> 02:04:58,215
...and after that all
the groom's people.

2098
02:04:58,490 --> 02:05:04,622
By looking at the label,
the food has been cooked.

2099
02:05:04,697 --> 02:05:06,221
You are right, my love.

2100
02:05:06,498 --> 02:05:12,437
By looking at the label,
the food has been cooked.

02:05:14,106 --> 02:05:15,630

How was the plan?

2104
02:05:25,584 --> 02:05:27,643
Our plan was excellent."

2105
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:53,673
Kalia! See! See! See
the photo of Ramkali.

2106
02:05:54,346 --> 02:05:56,143
Arre! Uncle is the Ramkali's
marriage photo.

2107
02:05:56,482 --> 02:05:57,676
If the photo is there then the
address must also be there.

2108
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:58,808
See!

2109
02:05:59,084 --> 02:06:00,142
If the photo is there then the
address must also be there.

2110
02:06:00,219 --> 02:06:01,277
Uncle come, let us ask from someone!

2111
02:06:02,154 --> 02:06:03,815
Ramkali is the daughter
of that baseless chief.

2112
02:06:04,089 --> 02:06:05,147
Yes sir!

2113
02:06:05,691 --> 02:06:08,091
Why sir didn't he give
his daughter to me...

2114
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,151
...and went with the police.

2115
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:11,287
Do you remember?

2116
02:06:11,363 --> 02:06:12,557
Yes I remember.
- Saw sir!

2117
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:14,360
But she came from London with me.

2118
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:15,758
Do you have some more proof?

2119
02:06:15,834 --> 02:06:17,233
What are you talking about proof?

2120
02:06:17,369 --> 02:06:19,098
If you will present
her in front of me...

2121
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:22,163
...by hitting her with shoes, I will
force her to tell the truth.

2122
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:24,299
Otherwise you can ask your son, sir.

2123
02:06:24,576 --> 02:06:27,101
I was under his shelter,
sir from there...

2124
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:29,841
...your son fled away with
my would be wife.

2125
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:33,379
This means, I have been cheated.

2126
02:06:33,452 --> 02:06:34,510
Yes!

2127
02:06:34,586 --> 02:06:35,848
This marriage will not be done.

2128
02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:37,847
Where is Dr. Anand?

2129
02:06:38,123 --> 02:06:39,590
Dr. Anand is busy with
the operation...

2130
02:06:39,658 --> 02:06:40,852
...you can meet Dr. Pradhan.

2131
02:06:41,126 --> 02:06:42,184
Dr. Pradhan!

2132
02:06:42,261 --> 02:06:43,319
Yes, on the first floor.

2133
02:06:43,395 --> 02:06:44,453
First floor! Thank you!!

2134
02:06:52,471 --> 02:06:53,529
Thakur sir!

2135
02:06:53,605 --> 02:06:54,663
You!

2136
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:56,399
What are you doing here?

2137
02:06:58,544 --> 02:07:00,273
I am the dean of this hospital.

2138
02:07:00,346 --> 02:07:01,404
Dr. Pradhan.

2139
02:07:02,147 --> 02:07:04,877
O! So you are also an actor.

2140
02:07:05,818 --> 02:07:06,876
Where is Anand?

2141
02:07:07,686 --> 02:07:08,744
He is doing an operation.

2142
02:07:08,821 --> 02:07:09,879
He will come just now.

2143
02:07:10,155 --> 02:07:11,213
Why don't you sit down?

2144
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:12,348
What hospitality should I do?

2145
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:15,489
Why? Is some more hospitality
has to be done?

2146
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:16,886
What have I done?

2147
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:18,487
What have you done?

2148
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:23,166
You have tried to stitch silk
cloth on a cotton cloth.

2149
02:07:23,235 --> 02:07:25,760
...You tried to ruin
our self-respect.

2150
02:07:26,705 --> 02:07:29,173
You tried to make a baseless
and casteless girl...

2151
02:07:29,241 --> 02:07:31,232
...as the daughter-in-law
of the Thakur family.

2152
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:33,837
Of which generation you are
talking about, Thakur sir?

2153
02:07:34,913 --> 02:07:36,175
All this caste, creed and religion...

2154
02:07:36,248 --> 02:07:38,443
...all these things are
of 16th century.

2155
02:07:39,318 --> 02:07:41,183
Nowadays, a person can be
identified by her excellence...

2156
02:07:41,253 --> 02:07:42,584
...and not by her caste.

2157
02:07:43,322 --> 02:07:44,721
Diamond remains a diamond...

2158
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:46,382
...may be it is fallen
in the muddy water.

2159
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:49,186
If you believed in the
truth of your diamond...

2160
02:07:49,261 --> 02:07:52,389
...then why didn't you bring
us in her real face.

2161
02:07:53,532 --> 02:07:56,194
I only want to know that
with this marriage...

2162
02:07:56,268 --> 02:07:57,860
...how much will you gain.

2163
02:07:59,405 --> 02:08:00,804
I am a doctor, Thakur sir.

2164
02:08:00,873 --> 02:08:02,932
I am not a business who thinks
about loss and gain.

2165
02:08:04,276 --> 02:08:05,675
By meeting two good hearts...

2166
02:08:05,744 --> 02:08:07,336
...I feel hearty happiness.

2167
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:09,211
For your happiness...

2168
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:10,805
...I can't put my self-respect
in danger.

2169
02:08:11,283 --> 02:08:13,410
That's why, this marriage
cannot be done.

2170
02:08:14,286 --> 02:08:15,412
This marriage will happen, father.

2171
02:08:16,555 --> 02:08:17,613
Anand!

2172
02:08:19,558 --> 02:08:20,752
This marriage will surely happen.

2173
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,352
No son, we have been cheated.

2174
02:08:25,364 --> 02:08:27,958
No father! We have not been cheated.

2175
02:08:28,233 --> 02:08:29,291
But that girl.

2176
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:30,960
That Ramkali is an ordinary
village girl.

2177
02:08:31,837 --> 02:08:32,963
This is what you want to tell?

2178
02:08:33,839 --> 02:08:34,897
I know!

2179
02:08:34,973 --> 02:08:36,702
And then also you want to marry her.

2180
02:08:37,643 --> 02:08:38,701
Yes father!

2181
02:08:39,311 --> 02:08:41,506
Your sight has always seen
her poor condition.

2182
02:08:42,781 --> 02:08:44,373
I have peeped into her soul.

2183
02:08:45,584 --> 02:08:46,983
I have loved her.

2184
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:48,581
This love is just timely thing...

2185
02:08:48,654 --> 02:08:49,985
...they can be purchased, Anand.

2186
02:08:50,789 --> 02:08:53,519
Remember, to led your life...

2187
02:08:53,592 --> 02:08:55,992
...you need the support of money.

2188
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:59,260
No father! To remain
alive a person...

2189
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:01,993
...needs food for two times.

2190
02:09:02,601 --> 02:09:04,000
And you giving me education...

2191
02:09:04,336 --> 02:09:05,997
That you can slap on my face
in front of everybody.

2192
02:09:08,474 --> 02:09:10,806
Son, I am your father.

2193
02:09:12,411 --> 02:09:13,537
In which thing your
goodness is there...

2194
02:09:13,612 --> 02:09:14,670
...to think about it is my work.

2195
02:09:14,746 --> 02:09:17,271
Then I am also your son,
in what my happiness is...

2196
02:09:17,349 --> 02:09:19,544
...isn't this your work
to think about it?

2197
02:09:20,285 --> 02:09:21,479
Anand, you are misbehaving.

2198
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,746
You are forcing me.

2199
02:09:33,499 --> 02:09:37,765
Father, you have fulfilled
all my wishes.

2200
02:09:39,371 --> 02:09:40,702
Fulfil my happiness also.

2201
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:45,298
I'll make you believe that
Ramkali is capable...

2202
02:09:45,377 --> 02:09:48,039
...of being the daughter-in-law
of this family.

2203
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:53,042
Ok son!

2204
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:56,511
If your happiness is in this...

2205
02:09:57,923 --> 02:10:00,448
...then I will put this false
coin in your arms.

2206
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:04,324
I have never bowed my head
in front of anyone...

2207
02:10:04,396 --> 02:10:08,799
...but today I had to loss
in front of my son.

2208
02:10:09,668 --> 02:10:13,604
I knew father, you are
having a loving heart.

2209
02:10:13,672 --> 02:10:14,934
You will surely accept it.

2210
02:10:15,674 --> 02:10:16,732
But son.

2211
02:10:17,476 --> 02:10:18,534
I have two conditions.

2212
02:10:19,811 --> 02:10:20,869
First condition is that...

2213
02:10:21,947 --> 02:10:25,075
...Ramkali will not know the truth.

2214
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:27,078
She will be just like a princess.

2215
02:10:27,886 --> 02:10:29,080
And the second condition is that...

2216
02:10:29,888 --> 02:10:30,946
...this marriage will
be held tomorrow.

2217
02:10:31,823 --> 02:10:35,623
Day after tomorrow, I will
leave India forever.

2218
02:10:36,828 --> 02:10:38,352
So that when this secret
will be disclosed...

2219
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,625
...then I don't have to hide
my face from people.

2220
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,558
I accept it!

2221
02:10:45,637 --> 02:10:46,695
Father, thank you!

2222
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:48,497
It's alright!

2223
02:10:55,914 --> 02:10:57,381
To buy the things of marriage...

2224
02:10:57,449 --> 02:11:00,111
...for the princess,
you will need this.

2225
02:11:00,652 --> 02:11:01,710
Mr. Secretary.

2226
02:11:10,929 --> 02:11:12,521
Will you tell where that Dr...

2227
02:11:24,409 --> 02:11:25,467
Is this true?
- Yes!

2228
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:27,739
He wants to marry
that baseless girl.

2229
02:11:27,813 --> 02:11:28,871
Then!!

2230
02:11:29,481 --> 02:11:32,678
Jackson, I want to win this
lost game in any condition.

2231
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:35,016
Forever make Ramkali...

2232
02:11:35,087 --> 02:11:36,611
Should I make her sleep forever?

2233
02:11:37,556 --> 02:11:38,614
Do you have any person?

2234
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:39,948
I have everything.

2235
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:42,626
But for this, I need money.

2236
02:11:42,828 --> 02:11:45,422
Jackson, family's respect...

2237
02:11:45,497 --> 02:11:46,964
...cannot be weighed with money.

2238
02:11:56,441 --> 02:11:58,500
This amount is not sufficient.

2239
02:12:01,647 --> 02:12:02,705
No!

2240
02:12:06,718 --> 02:12:07,912
Your work will be done!

2241
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:41,009
Who is it!?

2242
02:12:41,086 --> 02:12:42,144
Who are you!?

2243
02:12:43,622 --> 02:12:45,556
See me properly, Thakur.

2244
02:12:46,758 --> 02:12:50,489
You will see the same
flame in my eyes...

2245
02:12:50,562 --> 02:12:57,559
...by which flame you had burnt
my wife 24 years ago.

2246
02:12:57,969 --> 02:12:59,698
Beware! Don't come forward.

2247
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:02,564
Otherwise I will snatch
you by my hunter dogs.

2248
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:03,699
No!

2249
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:09,970
Today your hunter dogs
will snatch you.

2250
02:13:11,049 --> 02:13:13,574
Arre! I have come here without
the fear of death.

2251
02:13:33,605 --> 02:13:35,072
Have ever any dog killed a tiger?

2252
02:13:36,608 --> 02:13:37,870
Before 24 years...

2253
02:13:38,677 --> 02:13:40,076
...you should be given the
punishment of hanging.

2254
02:13:40,879 --> 02:13:42,744
The court had not done justice.

2255
02:13:44,216 --> 02:13:46,548
May be that is why,
because the justice...

2256
02:13:46,618 --> 02:13:48,142
...was to be done by my hands.

2257
02:13:49,688 --> 02:13:53,089
Dog, you will be please to know...

2258
02:13:53,892 --> 02:14:01,094
...that here you will die and
there your daughter will die.

2259
02:14:01,633 --> 02:14:02,691
My daughter!

2260
02:14:02,768 --> 02:14:04,292
Yes, your daughter Ramkali.

2261
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:09,640
Who wanted to cheat me
and marriage my son.

2262
02:14:10,175 --> 02:14:12,166
But I came to know her reality.

2263
02:14:12,644 --> 02:14:15,579
And now my men have surrounded her...

2264
02:14:15,647 --> 02:14:16,978
...in Gulab Mahal in such a way.

2265
02:14:17,315 --> 02:14:19,783
Just like a rabbit is
trapped by hunter dogs.

2266
02:14:20,118 --> 02:14:21,244
And they kill her.

2267
02:14:41,807 --> 02:14:43,001
Why are you laughing, you fool?

2268
02:14:43,809 --> 02:14:46,004
For your daughter's death,
at least cry a little.

2269
02:14:46,745 --> 02:14:48,212
If my daughter was going to die...

2270
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:49,679
...then I would had not cried.

2271
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:51,807
I would have shed
your blood, Thakur.

2272
02:14:52,083 --> 02:14:55,678
I am laughing because that
Ramkali is not my daughter.

2273
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:58,018
Then whose daughter is
that baseless girl?

2274
02:14:58,690 --> 02:15:02,353
In that baseless girl, the
blood of Thakur flows.

2275
02:15:02,694 --> 02:15:04,958
Thakur! Which Thakur's blood?

2276
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:06,959
That baseless Thakur is you! You!

2277
02:15:07,766 --> 02:15:08,824
It's lie! It's nonsense!

2278
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:10,158
You are not telling the truth.

2279
02:15:10,302 --> 02:15:12,361
It is the truth, Thakur.

2280
02:15:12,704 --> 02:15:14,035
This is not the justice of man.

2281
02:15:14,105 --> 02:15:15,299
This is the justice of God.

2282
02:15:15,373 --> 02:15:17,364
And you cannot buy his justice.

2283
02:15:17,843 --> 02:15:19,367
Ram kali, can't be my daughter.

2284
02:15:19,778 --> 02:15:22,372
I myself had saved my
son from the fire.

2285
02:15:22,914 --> 02:15:23,972
This is your conspiracy.

2286
02:15:24,049 --> 02:15:25,380
Your conspiracy will
not be succeeded.

2287
02:15:25,717 --> 02:15:27,651
Thakur, this is not my conspiracy...

2288
02:15:27,719 --> 02:15:28,913
...this is God's conspiracy.

2289
02:15:29,254 --> 02:15:32,985
By mistake you took my son
instead of my daughter.

2290
02:15:33,792 --> 02:15:35,657
I shouted and told your
bastard lawyer...

2291
02:15:35,727 --> 02:15:37,922
...if he wished, he
would had told you.

2292
02:15:38,797 --> 02:15:43,928
What was that bad man saying?

2293
02:15:44,202 --> 02:15:46,670
He was saying that Thakur
sir by mistake...

2294
02:15:46,738 --> 02:15:49,400
...left his daughter
and picked up my son.

2295
02:15:49,808 --> 02:15:51,742
He told this and I gave
him a tight slap.

2296
02:15:53,211 --> 02:15:56,339
No! This is lies! This can't
be true. This is lies.

2297
02:15:57,816 --> 02:15:59,750
Still you did not believe, Thakur.

2298
02:16:00,151 --> 02:16:01,948
Then take! See this!

2299
02:16:09,094 --> 02:16:14,157
This locket was put my dieing
mother of your child.

2300
02:16:15,367 --> 02:16:17,699
Today a alive father will put it...

2301
02:16:17,769 --> 02:16:20,294
...on his daughter's dead body.

2302
02:16:21,306 --> 02:16:22,830
Jackson will kill my daughter.

2303
02:16:23,708 --> 02:16:24,766
He will kill her.

2304
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:26,168
I will stop him.

2305
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:29,838
I will stop him.

2306
02:16:34,185 --> 02:16:35,243
They will kill my daughter.

2307
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:36,446
Yes Thakur!

2308
02:16:36,788 --> 02:16:40,918
Those faithful dogs will kill
herjust like a rabbit.

2309
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:53,329
What the hurry!?

2310
02:17:54,199 --> 02:17:55,928
Don't get afraid, Thakur.

2311
02:17:56,935 --> 02:18:00,530
Until you hear the news of
your daughter's death...

2312
02:18:01,072 --> 02:18:02,403
...I will not kill you.

2313
02:18:03,341 --> 02:18:06,071
Come on go inside and take rest.

2314
02:18:06,878 --> 02:18:07,936
Come on!

2315
02:18:09,948 --> 02:18:12,280
Close the door! So that
she cannot go out.

2316
02:18:15,286 --> 02:18:17,880
She will not come out alive.

2317
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:23,484
For God sake, let me go.

2318
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:26,894
Only one time you will
go out, to God!

2319
02:18:26,965 --> 02:18:28,899
They will kill my daughter.

2320
02:18:42,247 --> 02:18:44,579
In such a little time, you
became so restless Thakur.

2321
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:46,842
With this restlessness...

2322
02:18:46,918 --> 02:18:49,580
...I have lived for 24
years in the jail.

2323
02:18:50,188 --> 02:18:51,246
What happened, father!?

2324
02:18:51,856 --> 02:18:52,982
Who shoot the bullet?

2325
02:18:58,263 --> 02:18:59,321
You!

2326
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:04,864
Ok! I had saved your life so that...

2327
02:19:04,936 --> 02:19:06,403
...you can take my father's life.

2328
02:19:07,472 --> 02:19:11,135
You are his son.

2329
02:19:11,209 --> 02:19:12,267
Yes!

2330
02:19:14,345 --> 02:19:17,143
No! No! You are not his son.

2331
02:19:17,482 --> 02:19:19,347
You are that flower...

2332
02:19:19,417 --> 02:19:22,011
...who has been brought
up by this man.

2333
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:23,278
You are my son.

2334
02:19:23,354 --> 02:19:24,412
Yes, my!

2335
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:25,547
I am your son!

2336
02:19:25,623 --> 02:19:26,885
What nonsense are you speaking?

2337
02:19:28,026 --> 02:19:31,018
If you don't believe
me then ask him.

2338
02:19:31,429 --> 02:19:32,623
Whom you think as your father?

2339
02:19:33,231 --> 02:19:34,289
Tell!

2340
02:19:35,433 --> 02:19:36,559
Father, what does this man say?

2341
02:19:36,634 --> 02:19:37,896
Tell!

2342
02:19:39,170 --> 02:19:41,968
Anand, my son save Ramkali.

2343
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:44,301
What happened to Ramkali?
- Arre! What you are asking him?

2344
02:19:44,375 --> 02:19:45,433
Ash me!

2345
02:19:45,510 --> 02:19:46,909
He promised to marry you with her...

2346
02:19:46,978 --> 02:19:49,572
...and now he is going to
kill her by cheating.

2347
02:19:52,517 --> 02:19:58,319
Father! Father! Is this true?

2348
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:00,448
Why you are silent, father?

2349
02:20:03,261 --> 02:20:05,661
But son, save my daughter's life.

2350
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:07,056
Those bad men will kill her.

2351
02:20:07,999 --> 02:20:09,125
Will kill her!?

2352
02:20:09,267 --> 02:20:10,325
But where is she?

2353
02:20:11,069 --> 02:20:12,127
In Gulab Mahal.

2354
02:20:12,203 --> 02:20:13,261
In Gulab Mahal.

2355
02:20:13,338 --> 02:20:16,933
No! To save this cruel
man's daughter's life...

2356
02:20:17,008 --> 02:20:18,669
...I will not let you go.

2357
02:20:19,544 --> 02:20:22,672
You want to punish innocent
Ramkali for his deeds.

2358
02:20:22,947 --> 02:20:25,211
Yes! I want life in
exchange of life.

2359
02:20:25,283 --> 02:20:26,682
And I want blood in
exchange of blood.

2360
02:20:27,152 --> 02:20:29,086
Only then the fire of my
revenge will blow off.

2361
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:33,350
In your fire of revenge, I will
not let an innocent girl burn.

2362
02:20:33,558 --> 02:20:36,686
Stop! Otherwise, I will
also shoot you.

2363
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:46,568
Shot! So that in your hatred both
your children are killed.

2364
02:20:54,112 --> 02:20:57,445
Chief! They are very rude killers.

2365
02:20:58,316 --> 02:21:00,045
Both of us children's
life is in danger.

2366
02:28:06,744 --> 02:28:08,006
I have done lot of torture on you.

2367
02:28:09,547 --> 02:28:10,605
I am your criminal.

2368
02:28:11,482 --> 02:28:12,813
Love! Hurray!

2369
02:28:13,618 --> 02:28:15,415
Today two loving hearts...

2370
02:28:15,486 --> 02:28:19,081
...have finished the
hatred of two men.

2371
02:28:24,629 --> 02:28:29,692
"Humanity has won.

2372
02:28:33,504 --> 02:28:39,170
The bond of injustice has broken.

2373
02:28:41,579 --> 02:28:54,185
The new generation has
shown new life to all.

2374
02:28:56,460 --> 02:29:07,530
Caste, creed and religion
are invaluable.

2375
02:29:12,076 --> 02:29:18,538
The relation of love
is the true relation.

2376
02:29:19,950 --> 02:29:25,820
"Other relations are false."
