00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,828
'News'

2
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:26,534
Faiza,

3
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,959
Nothing, I was saying that...,

4
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,895
It was during the last
monsoon season,

5
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,903
I came here for the
very first time.

6
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,951
Then, the river had
completely overflowed.

7
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,600
Moreover, you could see
fish literally this huge,

8
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,131
wriggling awfully on the banks.

9
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,743
Is this Yamuna?

10
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,101
Which Yamuna?

11
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:45,418
Yes mam, it's The Yamuna.

12
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:47,509
Oh, the river's name, huh?

13
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,676
It's Yamuna.
You didn't know that?

14
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,985
Mister,

15
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,384
You'd better drive, and
not neck into our talk.

16
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,450
What?

17
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,072
Don't interfere, that's it.

18
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:01,246
You can't survive here without
knowing the (Hindi) language.

19
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,614
These people will dance
on your head.

20
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,891
Brother,

21
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,208
We're here for an admission
in this college.

22
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:15,425
Oh, That side?

23
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,485
Alright.

24
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,222
I'll see to this.

25
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,608
Faiza, stay inside. Better keep
yourself away from the sun.

26
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,067
- I'll speak to him.
- Tell me

27
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:32,052
I want to go to the
Admission Department.

28
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:33,755
- Sure, you may go inside.
- Here is the letter.

29
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,655
Alright, please sign here.

30
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,448
Sign here.

31
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,856
Be careful.

32
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,056
- Make it fast.
- Yeah, you have to fill this first.

33
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:51,935
Oh, classrooms here
look like tent houses.

34
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,942
- This is correct, I believe?
- Fill this one, OK?

35
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:54,895
Hi,

36
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,085
May I help you?

37
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,973
Hi.

38
00:05:56,998 --> 00:05:57,998
Hi.

39
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,559
I've come for admission.

40
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,917
Where do I go?

41
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,549
Give us your mobile number.

42
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,050
Please write it over here.

43
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:05,697
98954

44
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:06,848
721

45
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:07,873
84

46
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,363
Faiza Sufiya.

47
00:06:10,388 --> 00:06:12,430
S-U-F-I-Y-A.

48
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:23,443
I've been pondering over something
since I read your proposal.

49
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,885
Why Abdur Rahiman Sahib?

50
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:27,531
Sir,

51
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,458
The very first book I got to
read in my life is

52
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:32,548
the autobiography of Abdur Rahman Sahib,
written by my own grandfather.

53
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:34,786
Of course, no other book could
be a better choice for

54
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,214
the granddaughter of Palliath Alikoya
Mussaliar to start off with.

55
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,700
Even now, I suggest Alikoya Mussaliar's
books as a credible source

56
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:42,491
for knowing more about
Abdur Rahman Sahib.

57
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,661
How is Mussaliar's health now?

58
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,363
Even though he faces some health
challenges due to aging,

59
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:50,184
he still can do his
chores independently.

60
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,668
He still reads and writes actively.

61
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,814
Let me ask you, where exactly are
you focusing in this subject?

62
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:00,605
Sir, during the Indian freedom
struggle, on the basis of religion,

63
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,942
there was an active demand
for a separate state of Pakistan.

64
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,755
Even people of Malabar were
emotionally supporting that movement.

65
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,105
During then, it was Abdur Rahman
Sahib who convinced the public

66
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,870
for an undivided India where both
Muslims and Hindus live peacefully.

67
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,144
That is where I'm
going to focus.

68
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:19,902
Later, he had to suffer a lot of torture
from religious extremists for the same.

69
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,135
- Am I right?
- True.

70
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,225
Then, they used to have a slogan.

71
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,126
Do you know it, Faiza?

72
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,277
"Will use our sharp knives
to claim our Pakistan."

73
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:30,010
- ..Pakistan".
- Yes.

74
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,946
Moreover,

75
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:34,903
When Khilafat Movement of
Malabar was turning violent,

76
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,263
It was Sahib who kept
down these Muslims.

77
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:40,519
There's a famous speech made
by him standing on a bullock-cart,

78
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:43,786
addressing those weapon-baring Muslims.

79
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,310
His words were truly a
realization for the people

80
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:48,602
who had turned blind because
of their insane ideologies.

81
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,746
All of them put down their
weapons as the speech concluded.

82
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,900
Despite all this, I wonder

83
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:58,445
how many in this new generation
know about Abdur Rahman Sahib?

84
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,720
That's very true.

85
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,331
Now a days, secularism is
diminishing in our country.

86
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:04,075
In this scenario,

87
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,786
I wish if the new generation people could
know more about Abdur Rahman Sahib.

88
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:12,186
That is why I decided to choose
his life as my research subject.

89
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:13,503
Very good.

90
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,931
A research on the very first
book you've read, isn't it?

91
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,164
Very Interesting.

92
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,552
In fact, I'm not your guide
but your own grandpa.

93
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,852
I'll be just a facilitator.

94
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:26,035
Well,

95
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,936
Since 'Religious Identity' is also
a part of the subject,

96
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:31,019
You will have to use new
research methodologies.

97
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,472
Ok, sir

98
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:35,435
There's a book called
'Muslims Against Partition'.

99
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,708
- Written by Shamsul Islam.
- Shamsul Islam.

100
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,869
- Exactly.
- You may refer that.

101
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,702
In fact, you are going to do an
intense research for your project.

102
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,410
- You should never let the fire subside.
- Sure, sir.

103
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:48,147
Moreover, research is a difficult task.

104
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,284
You will be all alone
most of the times.

105
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,994
You shouldn't even think
of a part time job.

106
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:54,464
Huh... sir,

107
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,426
But, you wouldn't need to
work since you have a JRF.

108
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,118
Yes, that's also why I'm here.

109
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:59,733
Moreover I know that
if I stay home,

110
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:02,130
my marriage is going to
be an international issue.

111
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,879
They will not think of it
once I'm out of station.

112
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:07,914
So you've formed a
super plan, huh?

113
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,005
Nothing like that.

114
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,442
I was just kidding.

115
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,180
Another thing is, hostel allotments
are going to get late.

116
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,747
Anyways, I've made an
interim arrangement.

117
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:18,848
OK.

118
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,057
Hello Amal,

119
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:23,999
- No one here is your kin.
- No one here is your kin.

120
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:28,333
- VC is a weakling.
- VC is a weakling.

121
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:32,489
- Campus is full of thieves.
- Campus is full of thieves.

122
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:36,708
- VC is a weakling.
- VC is a weakling.

123
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,966
- Campus is full of thieves.
- Campus is full of thieves.

124
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,911
- VC, you have distanced yourself.
- VC, you have distanced yourself.

125
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:46,527
- Nobody here is your kin.
- Nobody here is your kin.

126
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,044
- Rohan is the light of our campus.
- Rohan is the light of our campus.

127
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,723
Amal, hey,

128
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,552
- Now, VC, its your turn.
- Now, VC, its your turn.

129
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:55,731
- Pothuval sir sent her here.
- What?

130
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,482
Pothuval sir sent her here.
Meet her.

131
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,411
- Where is she?
- She's here.

132
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:02,144
Hi, just a minute, I'll introduce
someone to you.

133
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,253
Thulsa, you remember Pothuval sir
talking about a girl?

134
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,487
Just talk to her for a
minute and be back.

135
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:10,399
- Students' Unity Zindabad.
- Zindabad...

136
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:14,216
- Go back, Vice Chancellor!
- Go back, Vice Chancellor!

137
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,659
- VC should Resign.
- VC should Resign.

138
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,700
- Hi, I'm Thulsa.
- Hi, I'm Faiza.

139
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,325
Did you know Pothuval sir
from back home?

140
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,450
No, I've only heard about him.

141
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,434
He's an extraordinary genius.

142
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,067
He's one of the living authorities of
Indian Political History, you know?

143
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,489
- This is ready.
- Thank you.

144
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:33,972
- It's yours.
- Thank you.

145
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:37,752
That is why I wanted to come to this
university to do research, you know?

146
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,318
Who's that student leader?

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,568
- Oh, that's Amal.
- Amal?

148
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:45,097
He's the University Union Chairman.

149
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,645
And he is also my best friend.

150
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:49,943
We want justice.

151
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:51,735
- Justice for...
- Rohan.

152
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,093
- Zindabad Zindabad...
- Zindabad Zindabad...

153
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:58,168
- Students' unity Zindabad.
- Students' unity Zindabad.

154
00:10:58,193 --> 00:10:59,901
Students' unity Zindabad.

155
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:04,379
- Students' unity Zindabad.
- Students' unity Zindabad.

156
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,309
- We want Justice.
- We want Justice.

157
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,075
Justice for Rohan.

158
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,966
- We want to meet VC.
- He's not inside.

159
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:13,241
- We want to talk to VC.
- He's gone out for a meeting.

160
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,970
Stop, Stop, Stop, one second.
Stop!

161
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,661
I'm telling you he's not here.

162
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,715
He's not here.
He's gone for a meeting.

163
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:22,074
- Who else shall we speak to?
- PVC called him for a meeting.

164
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,766
He's not here.

165
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:27,030
Sir,

166
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,265
Rohan's issue.

167
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:34,911
Sir, this is not the first
issue of this kind.

168
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:38,614
The University has been showing a
bad face to backward Dalit students.

169
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,036
This is part of a clear
political agenda.

170
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:43,302
There is a deliberate attempt
to wipe off students

171
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,738
of a particular community
from the campus.

172
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,664
Sir, you yourself know how difficult it
would be, when a student like Rohan

173
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,677
is deprived of his stipend.

174
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,911
Isn't it cruel to behave like this to him
after knowing his financial condition?

175
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,035
You are deliberately taking
away the security

176
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,144
that has been offered to
him by the constitution.

177
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:05,377
See, this is not an issue that can
be decided at our own discretion.

178
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,656
It's beyond our control.

179
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:13,294
Better you may approach
higher authorities.

180
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:17,053
Sir, if you're not empowered
to take a decision to solve

181
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,953
issues of a poor student
of this University,

182
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:23,727
Then, what is the use of
holding on to this chair?

183
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,608
Listen,

184
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,174
I know very clearly what
to do, and what not to do.

185
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,449
You needn't teach me,
you may go now.

186
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:35,874
We really don't want to stir up the
campus into an agitated mood.

187
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,649
But you're forcing us to do it.

188
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,655
Same way, don't think that this issue
will be confined to this University alone.

189
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,475
The entire country is going
to take it over.

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,936
And we'll make it happen.

191
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:47,663
Come, there's no use
of talking to him.

192
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:48,896
Get going.

193
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,444
Try and put me also in
some sports quota.

194
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:54,927
Sushil bro,

195
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,730
We have shown the power of
our leadership once again.

196
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,022
The Students Union strike has absolutely
no effect on the grip of PVC.

197
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,090
You see.

198
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,147
- They can't do anything.
- True.

199
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:07,088
Our national leaders right,

200
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:10,261
they know exactly how
to tackle this issue.

201
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:14,530
These issues in the name
of Dalits, minorities...

202
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,077
Everything will be dusted off.

203
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,977
This campus needs to be disciplined.

204
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,589
These South Indians right,

205
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,225
they are the biggest
problem here.

206
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,342
Specially, those people from Kerala.

207
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,700
First of all, they easily pass
all of their examinations.

208
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,178
Secondly, they...

209
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:33,537
So, we're also anti-nationalists
who cleared the entrance exam?

210
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,553
No,

211
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:36,426
I was not talking about
you. Sorry guys.

212
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,811
- You guys are exception.
- Oh, isn't it? - But it is true.

213
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:41,114
They are using our campus for
conducting anti national activities

214
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,556
for getting support from the youth.

215
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,103
They are even recruiting
candidates from this campus.

216
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:48,085
It is our responsibility to
identify and rip them apart.

217
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,490
- Yes, mom.
- Faizu,

218
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,473
- Hearty greetings, mom.
- Bless you, my girl.

219
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,835
What's up honey?
Did you take bath?

220
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,749
Yes, I took bath and,
I'm done with the prayers too.

221
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:13,952
Did you eat anything?

222
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:15,478
Nope, just going to have food.

223
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,366
Mom, let me switch to a video call?
Don't you want to see my room?

224
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,788
Oops! No need of a video call.

225
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:23,124
I'm all dirt and sweat.

226
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:25,534
C'mon mom, that's OK.

227
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,514
You're beautiful, as always.

228
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,163
Wait, wait, wait,

229
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,717
Let me wear the shawl properly.

230
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:36,179
Mom, see,

231
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,475
this is my five star hostel room.

232
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,625
Good.

233
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,225
Just a moment.

234
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:45,272
This is my room mate, Thulsa.

235
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:46,850
- Hi Mom,
- Hi.

236
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,541
How are you?
[Speaks Malayalam]

237
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,788
I'm good, dear.

238
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,438
Thulsa is not from here,
but Utharakhand.

239
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,725
But, she has a lot of
Malayali friends here.

240
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,139
Thus knows Malayalam very well.

241
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,241
- Where is grandpa?
- He's here.

242
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,183
I'll just give the phone to him.

243
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:14,020
Just a second.

244
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,780
Dad, it's Faizu on call.

245
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,230
Yes, Faiza,

246
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:20,835
Hearty greetings, Grandpa.

247
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,402
Bless you, my girl.

248
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:24,831
How's you knee pain?

249
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,831
I'm alright.

250
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:30,663
- How's your stay and food?
- All good.

251
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,405
I met the Professor.

252
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,178
He asked about you.

253
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:37,038
I'll call you sometime, when the
Professor is there with me.

254
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,530
Grandpa, I'll introduce
my room mate to you.

255
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,471
- Thulsa, she's Thulsa Chakma.
- Alright.

256
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,808
Hi grandpa, how are you?

257
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,999
Hi Thulsa, I'm fine.
How are you?

258
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,940
- I'm fine.
- Where are you from?

259
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:52,578
I'm from Utharakhand.

260
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:53,687
Bachavar.

261
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:55,796
Wow! The heaven on earth.

262
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,006
And which part of Utharakhand?

263
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,725
Bachavar, it's a small village.

264
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,960
It's very near to Mussorie.

265
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,826
Oh, Mussorie?

266
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,802
I've been to Mussorie once.

267
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:07,869
Great.

268
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:10,060
People there are very good.

269
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:14,855
- It's true.
- And the place is amazing.

270
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,398
OK, then...,

271
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,560
- Grandpa,
- Yes, honey,

272
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,005
You may hang up.

273
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,560
OK Mom, Grandpa,
I'll call later.

274
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,036
- OK Then,
- Peace be upto you.

275
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,091
And unto you peace.

276
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,439
''VC is a weakling.''

277
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:31,200
''VC is a weakling.''

278
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,817
''Camous is full of thieves.''

279
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:33,948
Thulsa,

280
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,098
There...

281
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:36,998
What's happening there?

282
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:38,190
Song!

283
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:39,857
We often have Hartal at night.

284
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,897
Our campus is much
active at night.

285
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:43,674
- Harthal?
- Yes.

286
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:48,474
You're really blessed to
have such a grandpa.

287
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,974
I've not seen my dad.

288
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:53,134
So, he is my everything;

289
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,437
my dad, grandpa, best friend...

290
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:56,629
Nice.

291
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,374
My mom's wish was to
see me as a doctor.

292
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:07,372
But my grandfather could
sense my area of interest.

293
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,624
And he supported me for...

294
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:12,481
Oh, I'm so sorry, I was
speaking in Malayalam.

295
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:14,468
From Medicine to History?

296
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,243
A drastic shift, dear!

297
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,394
My mom didn't like me going
too far for my studies.

298
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,557
So, she didn't let me go alone
any where for my PG.

299
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,040
But later,

300
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,328
She let me come
here only because of

301
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,670
my Grandfather's
strong recommendation.

302
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:32,394
I had always dreamt of
studying in this campus.

303
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,085
And my brother, Vilas.

304
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,169
He's my biggest supporter.

305
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,252
And you know,

306
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:40,161
It's my brother who wishes to see my
name written as 'Dr.Thulsa Chakma',

307
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:42,626
even more than I do.

308
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,859
And I will fulfill his dream.

309
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,311
Faiza, do you know?

310
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:51,001
I'm the first research student
from my community.

311
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,903
So you're going to be the first
Doctor from your community?

312
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:56,680
Yeah, like Dr.Bhim Rao Ambedkar.

313
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:58,118
Wow!

314
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,227
So, you're going to make
history, Thulsa?

315
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,863
Yes.
Finally.

316
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:07,685
- 'VC is powerless.'
- 'VC is powerless.'

317
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,544
'The system is full of thieves.'

318
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:16,911
- VC, you're the darkness.'
- VC, you're the darkness.'

319
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:22,724
'Rohan is the light
of our campus.'

320
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,786
Thank you, Very good,
very good, very good.

321
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:29,856
Thank You, Thank you.

322
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,288
I want to salute you all
for coming here today,

323
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,856
to fight for 'Justice for Rohan'.

324
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,255
But, I've a few things
more to tell you.

325
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,317
I want it to be more
or less informal.

326
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,527
This struggle is not just
for 'Justice for Rohan'.

327
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:49,630
Whatever happening with Rohan can't
just be seen as a one time incident.

328
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:51,780
It's visible in every university,

329
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,372
every educational institution in India.

330
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:56,036
This is all coz of Caste Discrimination.

331
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,994
The authorities had now
criminalized dissent.

332
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,419
And against this,
we need to fight.

333
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:03,856
So, from now,

334
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:07,396
our movement is going to
go forward ever stronger.

335
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:09,981
And remember one thing,

336
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:12,552
If we stay united,

337
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:15,739
we can show everyone, what
is right, and what is wrong.

338
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:18,825
If we all fight together,

339
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,325
Victory is ours.

340
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,434
So guys, what I want to say is,

341
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,459
If you still have faith,

342
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:25,747
If you still have belief

343
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:30,021
in democracy, in this University, in me,
and most importantly in yourself.

344
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,599
Please stay with me,

345
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:34,373
and shout out loud
with zeal and zest;

346
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:39,341
- 'Stop Caste Discrimination.'
- 'Stop Caste Discrimination.'

347
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:43,864
- 'Let casteism die.'
- 'Let casteism die.'

348
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:47,239
- 'Zindabad, Zindabad, '
- 'Zindabad, Zindabad, '

349
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:50,430
- Student's Unity Zindabad.
- Student's Unity Zindabad.

350
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:54,373
Dear Amal,

351
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,794
I'm very tired of
chanting slogans.

352
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:59,536
- Buy me something to eat.
- OK, move.

353
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:01,849
Who is this new follower?
Hi, Faiza,

354
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,457
- Hi,
- I'm Haibi Chamman.

355
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,927
I'm a poor Christian
guy from Trissur.

356
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,661
Didn't you tell her everything?

357
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:10,278
Dude, it's fine, I can
explain it to her.

358
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,724
Normally, new comers ought
to sponsor dinner for a week.

359
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:15,750
It's been a custom of our
University for years.

360
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,785
It goes unsaid that the Customs
are to be followed at any cost.

361
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,841
Yes, we know, we know.

362
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:24,521
- Do you really know Malayalam,
Thulsa? - Of Course!

363
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,388
She is considered as the
'Mother of Malayalam' here.

364
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:28,317
In fact, she had tried
to teach me Hindi.

365
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:29,630
But to our surprise,

366
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:32,161
she started speaking good
Malayalam in just three months.

367
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:34,893
Now, many people are approaching
her for learning Malayalam.

368
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,286
Yeah,

369
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:40,591
What Haibi taught me initially
was to swear in Malayalam.

370
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,993
To swear?

371
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:44,768
- To swear?
- Yes, minimally.

372
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,466
What cuss words?

373
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:50,442
Patti, Chetta, Nari...
[Cuss words in Malayalam]

374
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,099
These stunning words are
my contribution.

375
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:54,825
But not the ones coming up.

376
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,130
- OK, get going you dumbass.
- Stop it.

377
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,780
But, you only taught me these.

378
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:02,536
Didn't you go home yet?

379
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,126
Sit, Thulsa.

380
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,075
I'll order the
food, and be back.

381
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,134
Hi bro,

382
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,156
What's Rohan's issue all about?

383
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:13,931
Oh, you haven't met
Rohan, Have you?

384
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:16,419
He'll be here in some time.

385
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:19,189
He's one of the Dalit
activists in our group.

386
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:22,722
He's from a very poor
family in Andhra.

387
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:25,341
Haven't you heard of Ambedkar
Student's Movement?

388
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:26,408
Yes.

389
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:31,037
One of the strongest voices of the
movement in our University.

390
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:35,988
So, he's always been in the black
list of High Caste Fascist.

391
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:39,443
Did you meet Sushil?

392
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:40,802
No, who's he?

393
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:42,383
You should meet him.

394
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:45,244
He's leading BVS here.

395
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,436
He posted some content
on Facebook,

396
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,483
speaking ill of Ambedkar
Student's Union.

397
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,333
Rohan questioned him about it.

398
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:56,441
But his response was kinda bad.

399
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,591
Naturally, Rohan reacted.

400
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,090
It almost ended up
in a fist fight.

401
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:01,883
The real issue here
is something else.

402
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:03,641
After the incident,

403
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,165
a fake criminal case was
filed against Rohan by them.

404
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:08,773
Sighting this as a reason,

405
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,065
the University withheld his stipend.

406
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,508
It's been three months since then.

407
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,965
Rohan is devastated.

408
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:20,065
His hapless family,

409
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,090
the humiliation he faces here,

410
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:23,947
University's attitude...

411
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:25,049
Yeah,

412
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:28,132
They are suppressing our
voices in our own land.

413
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:30,202
If this is what we get
from the University,

414
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,090
where else are we going
to get justice from?

415
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,934
Hey, C'mon, join us.

416
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,692
- Hi Vyshnav,
- How are you?

417
00:22:37,717 --> 00:22:38,843
Come, sit.

418
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:40,949
- He's Rohan.
- Sit, chap.

419
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:42,883
He's Vyshnav.

420
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:44,549
He's from Rajasthan.

421
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:47,508
The one and only rebellious son of

422
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,674
a super rich gold merchant
of Rajput Dynasty.

423
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:55,466
Hey, brother, Vyshnav
 will pay you.

424
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:57,713
Rohan,

425
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,425
Vyshnav gave it for you.

426
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,241
How long is this possible?

427
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,182
Don't feel that you're alone.

428
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,305
Don't even think about it.

429
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,330
OK?

430
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:13,090
Come.

431
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,024
I am Faiza's...

432
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:16,549
Local Guardian.

433
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:19,357
- What?
- Oh god,

434
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:23,399
How do I make him understand
that I'm her local guardian.

435
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:24,925
Hey, hello...

436
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,174
It's nothing.

437
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:28,943
I'm Faiza's

438
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:31,177
'Local Father'.

439
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,372
Local Daddy.

440
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:33,497
Local Daddy?

441
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,279
- Yes, Local Daddy.
- Local Daddy?

442
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:37,103
Are you still laughing?

443
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:40,019
Let her come. Then you will
understand who am I to her.

444
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,575
You're not a cop, are you?

445
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,379
Haris, what happened?

446
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:44,958
Finally, you're here.

447
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:47,296
I told him that I'm
your local guardian.

448
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:48,862
He doesn't understand it.

449
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:52,070
He neither knows Hindi nor
English, he must be Bengali.

450
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:54,212
- Man, understand one thing,
- Please come here.

451
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:55,987
- What's it?
- Just come.

452
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,458
Haris, don't make it an issue.

453
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:02,184
I have to study here for
another 2-3 years.

454
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,747
Alright, I am leaving it
just because you asked.

455
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,585
I'm dangerous otherwise.

456
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,068
By the way, Faiza, what's
wrong with you?

457
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,888
You look terrible in just
two days of stay here.

458
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:11,356
Don't you like the food here?

459
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:13,606
Nothing like that. I don't have
any problem here.

460
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,208
Can't believe that.

461
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:16,614
Anyways, let's go out.

462
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,208
There's a famous hotel here.

463
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,911
You'll get to eat yummy
Mutton chaps and Porotta.

464
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,146
I'm not dressed up
for an outing, Haris.

465
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,213
I came down just because you called,
thinking there's something urgent.

466
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:26,082
What's there to dress
up so much?

467
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,567
Just wear the scarf...

468
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:31,122
You just have to wear the scarf
properly, and you're ready.

469
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:32,248
Come, hurry up.

470
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:34,064
Come, Faizu.

471
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,480
Come Faizu, get inside.

472
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:39,716
First of all, I'd like to say that

473
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,533
We shouldn't approach this issue

474
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:45,052
as a one time incident happened
in the purview of this campus.

475
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,283
And you all must be knowing

476
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:49,051
and feeling that enthusiasm,

477
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:51,784
that the new leadership has
brought in to National politics.

478
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,059
The leadership has conveyed
its willingness

479
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:57,225
to take part and take
responsibility of this strike.

480
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,266
Even by making its presence
in this campus.

481
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:03,101
And it has requested that

482
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,909
in this fight for 'Justice for Rohan',

483
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,673
All of you;

484
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:11,115
that is all the secular forces
should stay united

485
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,867
and fight for this cause.

486
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:14,642
And our promise to you is,

487
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,860
We are there with
you in this fight,

488
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:19,468
and will be too.

489
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,672
We will win for sure.

490
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:23,644
Jaihind.

491
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,638
In fact, it is unbelievable that

492
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:30,204
a person like Rohan
is being harassed

493
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,938
in a campus like this.

494
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:36,716
This is the university in India,
famous for total freedom.

495
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:38,721
If heinous things like this
happen in such a campus...

496
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,689
Those good old days
saw its end long back.

497
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:43,797
The Fascists are overpowering
the campuses using power.

498
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:44,966
To be frank,

499
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,910
It's now we understand the heights of
freedom we had enjoyed in our times.

500
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:51,642
The critiques then are now
aware of the truth.

501
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,513
Anyways, I appreciate the
decisions taken at our meeting.

502
00:25:56,538 --> 00:26:00,771
A strategy where all the student
organizations hold hands together...

503
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,731
Not just in our college,

504
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:04,974
this should spread across
the country.

505
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:06,017
There you are!

506
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:09,161
Oh Faizi, you were here?

507
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:10,310
Adharsh,

508
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,552
From whatever I've heard
about her, she's a genius.

509
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:15,872
Just that she sips
coffee with us.

510
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:19,367
I'm afraid whether you would
lure her to your group.

511
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:21,183
But, I'm not afraid of it.

512
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:23,732
She was our magazine editor
at Devagiri college.

513
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:24,950
Yeah, I know.

514
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:27,356
Now listen, the thing is,

515
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:28,763
Regarding Rohan's issue,

516
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,538
nothing favorable to us
has happened till now.

517
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,800
As far as I know,

518
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,560
their next step is his dismissal.

519
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:40,598
We should be taking a very strong
initiative against this immediately.

520
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:41,707
Very much.

521
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,574
Our party's senior leadership has already
decided to take over this strike.

522
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,114
Yes, that's what even
I had in mind.

523
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,489
I've a suggestion too.

524
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,294
For the movement to be strong,

525
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,271
the followers should also be strong.

526
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:54,138
So, let's eat something,
and then...

527
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:56,106
You may continue your
serious discussion.

528
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:57,798
I'm hungry.

529
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:01,810
See, what we need right now is

530
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:06,617
form a coordinated group of all the anti
fascists associations in our campus.

531
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,059
To begin with.

532
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,918
That's a great idea.

533
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:13,652
What I feel is like...

534
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:19,076
It's better to exclude organizations
running along religious line from this.

535
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:23,075
Moreover, subjects like religion and
faith are strictly personal matters.

536
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
It is dangerous if we mix
them along with this.

537
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:31,337
This movement should strictly
be seen from a secular perspective.

538
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,158
That's what I think.

539
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:34,573
That's true.

540
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:37,032
So, I gave it to him for review.

541
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,492
And he said he will send it.

542
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:41,638
- Asslamu Alaikum (Greetings among Muslims)
- Wa Alaikum Assalam

543
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:42,856
I'm Hana Fathima.

544
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:44,797
We work for 'Campus Fronts'.

545
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:47,442
Faiza, are you busy
to talk for a while?

546
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,685
That is...

547
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,418
You guys carry on.
I'm going to my room.

548
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:51,802
- OK.
- Bye.

549
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:54,675
I'm Jamal, Jamal Hussain.

550
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,130
From Thikkodi, Kozhikode.

551
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:57,614
She's Hana from Thiruvananthapuram.

552
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,157
He's Jafry and she's Mushra.

553
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:00,867
Both of them from UP.

554
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,684
Faiza, how's your hostel?

555
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,084
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

556
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:06,444
If not, you can share
any one of our rooms.

557
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:09,011
No, it's fine. I'm comfortable
with Thulsa. Thank you.

558
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:10,077
That's fine.

559
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:13,488
Though less in numbers,
we're very active here.

560
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:17,402
Despite this, we have Quran
class on every Friday.

561
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:19,720
There's a forum for discussing
social issues.

562
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,262
But not politics.

563
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,349
You should come for the class.
We're here to invite you.

564
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,349
We have Saifudin Ali Naqvi's
class next week.

565
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:27,458
Faiza would've heard of him.

566
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:28,958
It's highly intellectual.

567
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:31,646
Moreover, you can meet our people
when you come to the class.

568
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:34,356
This would be a protection for
you in a non-native place like this.

569
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,380
Something like safeguarding
our identity, am I right?

570
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:38,781
Nope... that is...
next week..

571
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,450
I'm sorry, I don't think I can make
it next week. Anyways, I'll update.

572
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,888
Don't worry.
You're not alone.

573
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:45,700
We can go together.

574
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,786
- OK, See you.

575
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:49,153
- Alright.
- Catch you later.

576
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:50,685
Yup.
OK.

577
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,449
Let's go.

578
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:57,074
Rohan,

579
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,001
Your phone is ringing.

580
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,294
Rohan,

581
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,022
Pick the call.

582
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:25,038
It's my dad.

583
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,260
To speak about stipend.

584
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:28,866
What could I tell him?

585
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:31,386
C'mon, just talk to him.

586
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:32,995
Why getting tensed?

587
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,544
Hello,

588
00:29:39,397 --> 00:29:40,522
Yes, dad.

589
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,624
It will take a week more.

590
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,833
He will give it to you
by next week.

591
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:52,101
OK.

592
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,909
OK, dad, I have a little
to study.

593
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:56,278
I will call you back.

594
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,794
OK.

595
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,498
He says that he's received
a bank notice today.

596
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,792
My house has been
under mortgage.

597
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:12,151
That's why...

598
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:14,759
Dad is not working now.

599
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,225
If I fail to give money,

600
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:19,932
we'll lose our roof.

601
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,826
The partition of Indian
mind was first achieved

602
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:29,242
through the writing of history
known as ' Historiography'.

603
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,810
They wrote a history of India

604
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,341
by dividing our Indian
history into three parts.

605
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,151
Hindu India, Muslim India,

606
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,092
and British India.

607
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:43,473
This categorization was
historically crucial

608
00:30:43,498 --> 00:30:47,550
for the construction of
religious Identity of India.

609
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:50,780
They reduced the people into
their immediate identity.

610
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:53,305
That of Hindus or Muslims,

611
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,455
in an attempt to rule Indians.

612
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:59,480
These historians had no idea about

613
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,885
Indian history or reality.

614
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:06,316
James Stuart Mill, who
gave us grand theories

615
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:09,310
pitting Indians against
fellow Indians

616
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,544
hadn't visited India ever.

617
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,961
They had only looked
at colonial sources

618
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,685
to make these theories
about hundreds of years

619
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:20,301
in the lives of millions of people.

620
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:22,534
They looked at everything

621
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,059
from a religious perspective.

622
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:27,659
Another important thing is,

623
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:29,242
one second,

624
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,642
Muhammed of Ghazni,

625
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,292
the Muslim king has
attacked temples

626
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:44,287
for the wealth accumulated
in the temple those days.

627
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:48,350
Only for the wealth
accumulated in the temple.

628
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,292
They made this economical
interest invisible,

629
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:54,446
and projected only the
religious identity of the king

630
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,221
which was unknown here.

631
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:01,563
Thank you all, thank you.

632
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,159
Thank you.

633
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,107
Done for today.

634
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,966
Hi, how are you?

635
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,764
Ah, good, good.
You noted everything.

636
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,497
You try to write it.

637
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:16,169
Refer good books.

638
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:18,509
Study well, have a good day.

639
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:19,701
Thank you.

640
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,404
- Sir,
- Yes Adharsh,

641
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,326
We'll conveniently talk later.

642
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:26,364
OK, done.

643
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:27,966
Faiza,

644
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:32,511
- Sir, it was interesting.
- Thank you, Faiza.

645
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,619
As if I confronted with some
bare truths from the history.

646
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:39,261
It is truth for some people,
and untruth for others.

647
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:40,859
Greetings Sir,

648
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:43,433
Sir, but I have a doubt.

649
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:47,095
Have the kings had any agenda
of promoting their religion?

650
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,829
No, nothing of that sort.

651
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:52,484
They were more fond of
wealth and power.

652
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:56,259
Muslim kings hardly addressed the
poor Muslims of their kingdom.

653
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,915
They socialized more
with wealthy Hindus.

654
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:01,304
The same was the case
with Hindu kings.

655
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:03,222
Wow, amazing.

656
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,205
Now I've a clearer picture of it.

657
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:07,743
In fact, we have a wrong
understanding of our own History.

658
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:11,084
The truths have been manipulated
by people with vested interests.

659
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:12,484
True.

660
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:13,868
Sir,

661
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,238
Sorry, I was a little busy.

662
00:33:15,263 --> 00:33:16,492
It's all right.

663
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:20,058
How far along is United Student's
Movement relating to Rohan's issue?

664
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,409
We feel more confident after
all the anti fascist forces

665
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,574
have united for this cause.
- Good.

666
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,333
And we've decided to stay
together in future also.

667
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:29,442
Very good. And the
time demands it, right?

668
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,824
Yes.

669
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:33,207
- Have you enrolled Faiza
in your gang? - Long back...

670
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:35,650
We were short of an NSO
activist. Now, it's done.

671
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,575
So, now you've affiliates
from all the parties?

672
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,403
Yes, now it's like a United
Student's Movement.

673
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:41,739
Very good.

674
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:44,849
What is your plan
for the evening?

675
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,606
- Nothing.
- Nothing in particular.

676
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:50,213
If so, let's huddle at my
house this evening.

677
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:53,800
It's been 30 years since we
started tolerating each other.

678
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,497
- Your wedding anniversary?
- Yes.

679
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:57,355
And you're telling this
in the eleventh hour?

680
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,547
You know me, Amal, I'm least
interested in celebrations.

681
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,448
Varsha arranged everything.

682
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,075
OK Sir, I'll definitely come.

683
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,036
- See you there.
- Sure.

684
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:15,868
We were waiting for you.

685
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,024
- Where were you?
- I was here only.

686
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,399
- You like the food?
- Yes, very good.

687
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:25,216
- Hi.
- Mam, it's you?

688
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:26,610
- Come.
- Please sit.

689
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:28,760
It's OK. It's OK.
Sit down.

690
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,467
Comfortable?

691
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,875
Thank you.

692
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:38,359
Faiza,

693
00:35:38,384 --> 00:35:40,431
How are you? Did you visit
places in Delhi?

694
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:43,376
Yes, she has a rocking local
guardian here.

695
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:46,796
So, we covered almost all the
Malayali restaurants in Delhi.

696
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:48,077
Who's that?

697
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:51,024
Mam, they are just kidding.

698
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,423
Not many places...

699
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,155
There's ample time for it.

700
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,347
Faiza, Mam is working in SBI Bank
as Deputy General Manager.

701
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:59,649
Mam, how is banking
sector going on?

702
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:01,008
Very strong.

703
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,575
Indian economy is very strong
after demonetization.

704
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,067
Since you say, our economy
is very strong,

705
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:10,601
can you waive off my
educational loan of 5 lakhs?

706
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,876
- Isn't it just a petty amount?
- Zip your mouth.

707
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:15,196
Around 10 farmers are committing
suicide everyday in our country.

708
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:16,938
Even their loans are
not being waivered.

709
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,095
Then why talk about
educational loan?

710
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,548
Waiving off loans can't be considered
as a good economic policy.

711
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:24,782
Yes, that's true.

712
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,579
But our banks can waive off

713
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,157
billions and trillions of money

714
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:33,478
availed by big shot
corporate companies.

715
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:36,003
That is a very brilliant
economic policy.

716
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,868
Our country is in peril.

717
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:41,329
Reserve Bank governors are
scooting off their positions.

718
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:44,032
Is this the strong economic
condition you're talking about?

719
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:46,946
See Amal, study the matter
first, and then talk.

720
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,915
Yes, the government can't
afford to pay back my loan.

721
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,399
It's OK, we understand.

722
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:54,168
- Mam, you explain on the basis of
your studies. - Can you just stop it?

723
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,336
Hi sir, when did you come here?

724
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:57,657
Faiza, don't get scared
hearing all these.

725
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,087
They fight whenever they meet.

726
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:01,899
You eat.

727
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,430
Thank you
Thank you so much.

728
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:13,872
Hope you all enjoyed the song.

729
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,954
All of us have gathered here is
to recollect the memories of

730
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:19,604
a happy love story, dating
back to 30 years.

731
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:24,829
As this is a night, all wet
in lovely memories,

732
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:27,267
Let's listen to a Malayalam
song next.

733
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,993
Another specialty of
the song is...

734
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:31,532
It is composed by...

735
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:33,774
our dearest..

736
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:36,196
Professor, Shri. Satish Pothuval.

737
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:59,081
"Love."

738
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:02,914
"Oh, my love..."

739
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:12,726
"You are an ever-flowing
river of love."

740
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:20,563
"You are a chilling rain
in the desert."

741
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:26,845
"You are the light of my life,
like the sun rays in the morning."

742
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:34,212
"You are the rhythm of
my nights."

743
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:40,142
"You are the colorful dreams
of my heart."

744
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:46,032
"And that's the essence of
happiness in my life."

745
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:55,747
"You are an ever-flowing
river of love."

746
00:38:55,788 --> 00:39:03,622
"You are a chilling rain
in the desert."

747
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:59,614
"The sun rays climb up the steps."

748
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:05,798
"And the streets of my mind
is all crowded."

749
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:12,756
"The light just fades away."

750
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,290
"The birds fly away."

751
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:20,803
"Was it a shadow or broken dreams?"

752
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:28,163
"The light just fades away."

753
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,767
"The birds fly away."

754
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:36,488
"Was it a shadow or broken dreams?"

755
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:41,726
"Sailing through the depths of life,"

756
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:47,407
"You shower me with the
fragrance of happiness."

757
00:41:04,353 --> 00:41:06,522
It's just a matter of 5
minutes more, know?

758
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,922
They have been saying
it from the morning...

759
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:18,121
- I'll be right back.
- How beautifully are they making it!

760
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,292
- Will it get late?
- Yes.

761
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:24,560
Simply standing and staring at
it will not help. This is an art.

762
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,782
Get me some paint, dude.

763
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,600
- How is it?
- It's really good.

764
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:34,238
You can almost see the
fire in his eyes know?

765
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:35,017
Yeah.

766
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:37,228
It's better to apply
a dark shade there.

767
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:39,632
These are allowed here only.

768
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:42,597
It seems they have started
removing the statues out there.

769
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,055
And for which they're
suffering now.

770
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,120
The entire country collapsed.

771
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:48,163
Yeah.

772
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:51,617
They should think along his line
if at all they're to have a hope.

773
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,975
OK, no comments.

774
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:55,344
Well,

775
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:58,805
You've been a staunch advocate of
Nehru's Economic Policies.

776
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,055
Then why this silence?

777
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,898
You people never bothered
Nehru when he is alive.

778
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:05,297
And now you hail him.

779
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:07,680
It's true.
It's true.

780
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:09,663
If his economic policy
wasn't there,

781
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,767
our country would've
had a tough time.

782
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,296
I can't completely agree
to it. But, in a way...

783
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,391
I don't mind you continuing
with your theories and stretch.

784
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,016
But one thing, Leader,

785
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,142
Unni's hotel will close shortly.

786
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:30,467
[Indistinct Chattering]

787
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:35,316
Shucks!

788
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:37,167
Hey, Haibi,

789
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:38,234
Yup.

790
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,622
Can you just move
your ass a bit?

791
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:40,962
Ass?

792
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,328
Shucks! I could've worn
something inside.

793
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,031
Shove off, you dumbass.

794
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:47,220
Dang! An idiot who doesn't
value artists.

795
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:48,328
Cool, OK.

796
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:50,958
That's nice.

797
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:57,092
Faiza, you know, this
place is not like ours.

798
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:59,568
We have total freedom
in this campus.

799
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:02,760
But, a mistake that everyone
makes is their friends.

800
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:04,178
Faiza, don't get offended.

801
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:08,037
None of your friends
align to our beliefs.

802
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:10,639
They believe in Materialism.

803
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,805
I'm sorry.

804
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:16,732
I've my own stance
on these topics.

805
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:19,535
They were not formed overnight.

806
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,662
For the very same reason,

807
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:23,529
I'm not afraid that I might
lose it somewhere.

808
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:27,185
Regarding my friends,

809
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,893
Whether or not they are believers,

810
00:43:28,918 --> 00:43:31,299
it is not going to affect my
friendship with them.

811
00:43:31,324 --> 00:43:33,532
They are good people.

812
00:43:34,149 --> 00:43:37,771
Friendship is as simple
as that, isn't it?

813
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:39,553
OK Then. Have a good day.

814
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:40,725
Yeah.

815
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:46,685
Hello Thulsa, how are you?

816
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,974
- Hi bro, how are you?
- I'm good.

817
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:51,423
- What about you?
- I'm good too.

818
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:53,615
- And how's mom?
- She's fine.

819
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,973
Well, where are you now?

820
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:56,876
I'm here at hostel.

821
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,959
Good. Good. How's your
studies going on?

822
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:01,100
- Good going.
- Great.

823
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,678
Had food?

824
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:03,953
Yes.

825
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:06,353
- Where is Faiza?
- She is here.

826
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:07,810
With me in the hostel.

827
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:10,014
Say my Hello to Faiza.

828
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:12,756
Faiza, brother is saying
a 'Hi' to you.

829
00:44:12,781 --> 00:44:13,912
Hi,

830
00:44:13,937 --> 00:44:15,643
She's saying 'Hi' to you.

831
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:18,475
A mere 'Hi' will not do.
Let me speak to her.

832
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,503
Faiza, he wants to talk to you.

833
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:23,153
One minute, bro.

834
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:26,357
Hi bro,

835
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:29,287
How are you?

836
00:44:30,283 --> 00:44:32,295
She's asking how you are.

837
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,445
Good. Good.

838
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:35,957
What else?

839
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:38,701
We... Your wedding...
[Tries to speak Hindi]

840
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,170
We're coming.
We're all coming.

841
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:44,201
She says that they will be
joining us for your marriage.

842
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:45,350
Sure.

843
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:48,498
- OK. Take care. Bye.
- Bye.

844
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:50,870
OK Bhaiyya.
Bye.

845
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:53,115
OK, Bye Thulsa, Take care.

846
00:44:54,473 --> 00:44:56,162
Everything good at home?

847
00:44:56,187 --> 00:44:57,812
All good.

848
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:00,568
Mom asks me always.

849
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,758
Have you heard this song before?

850
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:30,436
This song was composed within days
of Mahathma Gandhi's demise.

851
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:35,068
Muhammed Rafi was just 24
when he sang this song.

852
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:38,981
Jawaharlal Nehru broke into
tears hearing this song.

853
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:41,483
Sir, we're going to
Jamiamilia, right?

854
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:42,997
Yes.
Yes.

855
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:45,115
Jamiamillia University
can be traced back

856
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,443
from the history of our
Freedom Struggle.

857
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,346
During the Indian Independence
movement,

858
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:53,514
the British lured some
Muslim Scholars.

859
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:56,654
They also provided educational
institutions for the Muslims

860
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,342
to impart colonial education.

861
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:03,784
They asked these scholars to issue
Fatwa in favour of British Rule.

862
00:46:04,276 --> 00:46:08,521
A few people like Syed Ahmmed
Khan got slipped into their trap.

863
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:12,256
Sir, But we know Syed Ahmmed
Khan as Renaissance leader.

864
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:13,782
Yes, that's true.

865
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:16,826
But he was against
Indian Freedom Struggle.

866
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:19,107
He believed that only if he
held hands with the British,

867
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:20,757
he could help the community.

868
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:25,928
But, majority of the Muslim
scholars were against it.

869
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:28,828
They issued Fatwa
against British rule.

870
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,593
Jamiamillia University was an
institution started by them

871
00:46:33,618 --> 00:46:37,160
with the support of Congress.

872
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,660
Britishers had tried to demolish
this institution several times.

873
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:13,485
Then, leaders including Gandhiji
strived hard to retain the institution

874
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,885
They even sought contribution
from the public for the same.

875
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:21,975
Jamiamillia University has a big role

876
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,583
in imparting secularism
in young minds.

877
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,558
This is where Abdur Rahman
came for pursuing his studies.

878
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:39,033
This is the room Abdur Rahman
occupied in this hostel.

879
00:47:46,048 --> 00:47:47,153
Faiza,

880
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:48,178
Yes, sir.

881
00:47:48,203 --> 00:47:50,120
You may present the next seminar.

882
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:52,095
Oh sir, me?

883
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,578
It's a part of your research.

884
00:47:53,928 --> 00:47:55,623
Isn't it too soon...?

885
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:58,407
You've been researching on the subject
since you started learning alphabets.

886
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,191
So, won't this time
enough for you?

887
00:48:00,216 --> 00:48:02,550
- Sir, don't make fun of me.
- No, no, no, no. I'm serious.

888
00:48:04,784 --> 00:48:08,492
It's Thulsa's brother's
marriage next week.

889
00:48:08,517 --> 00:48:11,467
- So, can I do the seminar...
- Yup, you can do it after you're back.

890
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:14,632
- OK, Sir.
- OK.

891
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:15,907
Come.

892
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,592
OK guys, tickets confirmed.

893
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:20,049
Good, What time?

894
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:21,657
10.30 PM.

895
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,110
OK.

896
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:25,970
Huh, don't we have to buy a
gift for Thulsa's brother?

897
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:27,411
Ops, Need it all?

898
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:28,520
Yes, of course.

899
00:48:28,545 --> 00:48:29,905
- Why not?
- Really?

900
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,375
Come, let's go out,
and buy something.

901
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,528
Let's go and buy it right
now. We have time.

902
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:35,459
- Let's go?
- Yep.

903
00:48:35,484 --> 00:48:37,614
You may go.
I want to take rest.

904
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:39,215
It's fasting from tomorrow.

905
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:40,882
What? What fasting?

906
00:48:40,907 --> 00:48:42,490
If you're lazy to come,
just tell that.

907
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:43,982
That's not it.

908
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:45,549
I'll get hungry quickly.

909
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:47,740
And I know that you don't
have a single penny with you.

910
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:53,519
My comedy would be a flop.
But, look there.

911
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,472
A real comedian is coming to us.

912
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,246
Why aren't you picking my calls?

913
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:58,438
How long have I
been calling you?

914
00:48:58,463 --> 00:49:00,563
I forgot my phone at the hostel.

915
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:02,873
What happened?
Why are you here?

916
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:05,401
I thought of taking you out.

917
00:49:06,061 --> 00:49:09,186
We are going out now.
So, I can't come with you.

918
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:11,404
We? Who all?

919
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:13,264
We all.

920
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:15,389
This isn't your place.

921
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,771
This is Delhi, a very
dangerous place.

922
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:19,896
Someone well informed
has to accompany you.

923
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:23,729
You needn't go alone with them.

924
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:25,453
I'll also join you.

925
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:28,075
Haris, we're a lot of people
all together.

926
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,357
How come you come along with us?

927
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:32,646
That's OK. I'll come.
Don't go alone.

928
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,717
Faiza, why worrying?
Let him come with us.

929
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:36,268
Isn't it, Haris?

930
00:49:36,293 --> 00:49:37,334
You just come.

931
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,537
Amal, we're having food
before or after shopping?

932
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,279
- The first option would be fine.
- Cool.

933
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:46,054
So, let's eat first.

934
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,725
You come along with me.

935
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,115
What the heck?
You walk.

936
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,264
Come, let's go.

937
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,967
Come.

938
00:49:56,855 --> 00:49:58,459
What is it, Haris?
I'm heavy?

939
00:49:58,484 --> 00:50:00,024
What a question?

940
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:01,633
I can sit in the back
seat if you want.

941
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:04,076
No, he isn't heavy.

942
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,537
As if I've kept some
sponge on my lap.

943
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:08,228
Aren't you eating at all?

944
00:50:08,253 --> 00:50:11,560
By the way, I've something
to tell you all.

945
00:50:11,585 --> 00:50:13,700
Our lovely Haris will decide

946
00:50:13,725 --> 00:50:16,584
from where to eat,
and what to eat.

947
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:18,150
No one should interfere in it.

948
00:50:18,175 --> 00:50:19,771
I will not allow it also.

949
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:21,212
What you say, Haris?

950
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:25,574
Delhi isn't familiar
to us as you do.

951
00:50:25,616 --> 00:50:28,506
I know Delhi. Moreover you
don't go out that much.

952
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:30,090
I'll take you.

953
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:31,950
We go out very often.

954
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:33,496
This may be Your first outing.

955
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:39,341
But Faiza wouldn't be
accompanying you, right?

956
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,178
We never go out without Faiza.

957
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:44,245
As if you're ignorant.

958
00:50:45,745 --> 00:50:47,389
Ops, don't sleep on me.

959
00:50:47,414 --> 00:50:48,956
Sit properly.

960
00:50:52,576 --> 00:50:53,868
It can be this way also.

961
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:55,309
Food has come.

962
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:05,485
Excuse me,

963
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,303
The Steam Cake is crumbled.

964
00:51:07,328 --> 00:51:08,745
I want a perfect one.

965
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:12,019
This Steam Cake... is crumbled.
[Tries to speak Hindi]

966
00:51:12,044 --> 00:51:13,975
Which means... Er...

967
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,646
- Just tell him.
- This is broken.

968
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:17,615
He doesn't want broken ones.

969
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:20,162
One new...

970
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:21,959
Steam Cake.

971
00:51:23,332 --> 00:51:24,787
Pass it.

972
00:51:25,576 --> 00:51:27,092
The thing is,

973
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,639
I don't eat crumbled Steam Cake.

974
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:30,600
That's my habit since childhood.

975
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,958
- Faiza knows about it.
- Yes, yes.

976
00:51:32,983 --> 00:51:34,650
At his place,

977
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,506
the Steam Cake from the maker
is directly pushed into the mouth.

978
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:40,342
You'd better zip your Big Mouth.

979
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:43,097
- You understand one thing,
- Anyways, we eat it after crushing it.

980
00:51:43,122 --> 00:51:44,206
So what?

981
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:46,373
How do we eat rice?
By mixing it, right?

982
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,451
But the supplier doesn't
mix it for us.

983
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:50,126
That's true.

984
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:51,451
That's....

985
00:51:51,952 --> 00:51:54,107
Don't you ever talk to me.

986
00:51:54,132 --> 00:51:56,216
Gobble the food and leave.

987
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,948
Whatever, I'll only eat
unbroken Steam Cake.

988
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:07,553
Pass it, Pass it, what the heck,
Haibi? Pass it man.

989
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,326
Pass it.

990
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:10,727
Give it to Rohan.

991
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:18,855
Give it to me.

992
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:20,600
But, isn't it crumbled?

993
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,958
That's OK. Once in a while,
I eat crumbled ones also.

994
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:25,955
May be their Steam Cake
maker is not good.

995
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,740
It's not good to blame
them every time.

996
00:52:33,356 --> 00:52:35,498
What the crap is he doing?

997
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:49,803
"Oh, my friends."

998
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:57,403
"Oh, my friends."

999
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:08,873
"To fly along the sweet
blowing wind."

1000
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:12,576
"With colorful dreams
inside the eyes."

1001
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:18,642
"We travel through the same
path of life."

1002
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,545
"The dusk is coming in."

1003
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:27,217
"It's the wave of darkness
everywhere."

1004
00:53:27,242 --> 00:53:33,115
"Come to me, as the light
of moon."

1005
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:40,467
"I search for you over the trees,
over the skies."

1006
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:47,826
"You are the rhythm
of my heart."

1007
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:50,494
"Life looks so alive."

1008
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:52,412
"My ways are more easy
with you."

1009
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,193
"We will stay like this, always."

1010
00:53:55,218 --> 00:53:59,550
"We will be friends forever."

1011
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,912
"We listen to the rhythm
of winds..."

1012
00:54:06,937 --> 00:54:09,865
"Blowing in the fresh morning."

1013
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:14,217
"Let's live every moment
of happiness."

1014
00:54:14,242 --> 00:54:18,367
"Everyday, every moment."

1015
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:46,553
"The breezy wind comes chuckling
and giggling."

1016
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:53,618
"To spread colours into our lives,
like the colorful threads."

1017
00:54:55,002 --> 00:55:01,332
"Oh, the lovely rainbow, you
journey through our minds."

1018
00:55:01,357 --> 00:55:07,653
"Filling droplets of love
and joy inside us."

1019
00:55:08,402 --> 00:55:11,903
"This is a moment of jubilation."

1020
00:55:12,028 --> 00:55:15,864
"And, the waves of life
moves in track."

1021
00:55:15,889 --> 00:55:23,152
"You all make my life, today."

1022
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:49,944
"To fly along the sweet
blowing wind."

1023
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:53,778
"With colorful dreams
inside the eyes."

1024
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:59,111
"We travel through the same
path of life."

1025
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:06,861
"I search for you over the trees,
over the skies."

1026
00:56:06,903 --> 00:56:13,778
"You are the rhythm
of my heart."

1027
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,653
"Life looks so alive."

1028
00:56:16,653 --> 00:56:18,402
"My ways are more easy
with you."

1029
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:21,710
"We will stay like this, always."

1030
00:56:21,735 --> 00:56:26,152
"We will be friends forever."

1031
00:56:29,778 --> 00:56:31,444
"Life looks so alive."

1032
00:56:31,486 --> 00:56:33,111
"My ways are more easy
with you."

1033
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:36,070
"We will stay like this, always."

1034
00:56:36,111 --> 00:56:40,736
"We will be friends forever."

1035
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:47,753
"We listen to the rhythm
of winds..."

1036
00:56:47,778 --> 00:56:51,028
"Blowing in the fresh morning."

1037
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,319
"Let's live every moment
of happiness."

1038
00:56:55,361 --> 00:57:00,152
"Everyday, every moment."

1039
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:10,876
- I can't do this.
- Hey, listen,

1040
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:12,477
I'll go home, and take
bath in the morning.

1041
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:14,378
- Amal, are you cold?
- Yes, a bit.

1042
00:57:17,953 --> 00:57:19,578
Look at Sindh, wow!

1043
00:57:19,642 --> 00:57:21,367
What a beautiful place?

1044
00:57:21,392 --> 00:57:23,517
What are you doing there?

1045
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:25,404
You also come.

1046
00:57:25,429 --> 00:57:27,539
Do you know what I'm
thinking right now?

1047
00:57:27,564 --> 00:57:29,523
Our Thulsa, right?

1048
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:32,340
How painstakingly she comes to the
University from such a remote place?

1049
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,220
We at least got a tractor
to reach Thulsa's house.

1050
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:42,352
We had to walk nearly 3 hours
to reach Rohan's house.

1051
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,665
Enough, buddy.
Let's go.

1052
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:46,918
Where are you going?

1053
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,985
- You'll fall down.
- What happened?

1054
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:49,860
Got scared?

1055
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:51,426
How crazy are they?

1056
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,556
- Have your tea.
- Thank you.

1057
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:58,690
Did you have tea?

1058
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,192
Yes, I did.

1059
00:58:00,217 --> 00:58:01,260
You'll be feeling cold.

1060
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:02,687
No, no.

1061
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,985
Sitting near this is warm.

1062
00:58:05,684 --> 00:58:06,893
Have it.

1063
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,876
- Thank you.
- OK, OK.

1064
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:15,817
OK, How many times?

1065
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:21,501
How many more Rotis needed?

1066
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:24,985
That's what they do to get
 rid of the cold here.

1067
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:29,517
Thulsa always speaks about you.

1068
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,946
She doesn't even think of
us when you're around.

1069
00:58:32,978 --> 00:58:35,227
Faiza, take care of Thulsa.

1070
00:58:35,864 --> 00:58:38,610
She doesn't give a second
thought to anything.

1071
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,149
In my opinion, she
is very brave.

1072
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:46,239
Yes, yes, she...

1073
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,564
Your support is what makes
her brave.

1074
00:58:49,606 --> 00:58:51,009
You rightly said it.

1075
00:58:51,034 --> 00:58:52,331
She is very naughty with us.

1076
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:54,149
What's happening here?

1077
00:58:54,174 --> 00:58:56,642
Whom are you talking about?

1078
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,998
Wow! Faiza,

1079
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:01,432
You learnt to make Roti
in such a short while?

1080
00:59:01,457 --> 00:59:03,432
It's amazing.

1081
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,540
See,

1082
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:18,493
Excuse me, pencil please?

1083
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,087
Thank you.

1084
00:59:37,023 --> 00:59:39,263
- Yes, Faiza.
- Sir, sorry, sir.

1085
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:40,998
Did I trouble you calling
at late night?

1086
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:42,938
No way, tell me.

1087
00:59:42,963 --> 00:59:44,712
Just one doubt;

1088
00:59:44,737 --> 00:59:47,170
Can we use videos for seminars?

1089
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:48,648
Why not? You can.

1090
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,107
Yes? Great, great.

1091
00:59:50,148 --> 00:59:52,023
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much. OK.

1092
00:59:52,065 --> 00:59:53,272
Are you tensed?

1093
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:54,492
Yes, a little.

1094
00:59:54,517 --> 00:59:59,071
This is my first time presenting a
seminar in such a big university.

1095
00:59:59,814 --> 01:00:03,855
Seminars are very common here.

1096
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,880
You needn't get tensed.

1097
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:09,750
OK, sir. Thank you, sir.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1098
01:00:09,775 --> 01:00:11,942
- OK, good night.
- Good night, sir.

1099
01:00:28,275 --> 01:00:29,984
- Grandpa,
- Yes, kiddo,

1100
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:31,977
I'm preparing for the seminar.

1101
01:00:32,002 --> 01:00:34,384
- Let me just read out the points?
- Yes.

1102
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:40,421
The biggest advantage of the first
war of Independence, 1857 was

1103
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,610
the establishment of Hindu-Muslim unity.

1104
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:44,427
The British was threatened by it.

1105
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:48,485
Lord Curzon was their trump
card to breakdown this unity.

1106
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,011
His policy was to
'Divide and Rule'.

1107
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:54,280
One second.

1108
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:58,780
The Bengal Split and Pakistan formation
were the fruits of that policy.

1109
01:00:58,805 --> 01:01:01,555
Lord Curzon died in the year 1825.

1110
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,580
The repercussions of his policies are
evident in Indian politics even now.

1111
01:01:06,306 --> 01:01:08,839
It divides us again and again
in the name of religion.

1112
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:12,368
We have to understand that all
these are for gaining power.

1113
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:15,220
Abdur Rahman Sahib, known
as the Heroic Son of Kerala

1114
01:01:15,274 --> 01:01:18,798
is one of the leaders of renaissance
who stood against it.

1115
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:22,848
He was tortured both by the extremists
belonging to his own community,

1116
01:01:22,873 --> 01:01:28,165
and the British rulers, for
the very same reason.

1117
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,335
Pampering their memories at
heart will definitely provide us

1118
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,777
the strength to face the
challenges of today.

1119
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:37,525
But deliberate attempts are being
made to obliterate them.

1120
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:40,588
Even new historical narratives
are being constructed

1121
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,652
for this purpose.

1122
01:01:41,677 --> 01:01:45,500
Resistance is crucial for the
survival of our country.

1123
01:01:45,525 --> 01:01:49,433
The stories of those people who
sacrificed their entire lives

1124
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,959
in the names of clans and
tribes to which they are born

1125
01:01:52,984 --> 01:01:54,900
are extremely saddening.

1126
01:01:54,925 --> 01:01:57,625
Some people are conspiring
against freedom,

1127
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,775
democracy and secularism.

1128
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:04,250
Won by heroic sons of our
land like Abdur Rahman Sahib.

1129
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:06,984
To safeguard the freedom
and unity of our land,

1130
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:10,900
we must resist and defeat
these forces of darkness.

1131
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:13,883
Thank you.

1132
01:02:22,684 --> 01:02:24,851
A political speech in the name
of seminar? Ridiculous!

1133
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:26,863
We should never be a mute
witness to this absurdity.

1134
01:02:26,888 --> 01:02:28,375
What Deepthi said is true.

1135
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,459
People from our place
are the haughtiest.

1136
01:02:30,484 --> 01:02:32,068
These are the recruits
of Pothuval.

1137
01:02:32,109 --> 01:02:33,400
Everyone has a stand.

1138
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:36,480
There is no need of
complaining anyone.

1139
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,542
We shouldn't allow such
anti-nationalists here.

1140
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,734
We ourselves will do
whatever is necessary.

1141
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:43,605
True.

1142
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:46,630
The system is not going
to change for better.

1143
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,679
Even if we go and complaint,
what is the use?

1144
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:58,363
Hey, Faiza Madam, greetings.

1145
01:02:58,388 --> 01:02:59,972
I got to hear your seminar.

1146
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:01,580
It was fun.

1147
01:03:02,142 --> 01:03:03,850
Open your ears, and listen.

1148
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:06,599
This is Hindustan.

1149
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:09,166
Evil or Virtue,

1150
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,308
We'll do it, understood?

1151
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,839
If you don't agree to it,
just leave the country.

1152
01:03:14,864 --> 01:03:16,030
Understand?

1153
01:03:16,055 --> 01:03:18,513
Such a ridiculous seminar
and research of yours.

1154
01:03:20,827 --> 01:03:22,058
Faiza,

1155
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,584
Politics here is different from
that of our native place.

1156
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:26,761
Here, we should be very careful
while making statements.

1157
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:29,542
We're here with a warning just
coz you're a Malayali too.

1158
01:03:29,582 --> 01:03:31,415
They are Dare Devils.

1159
01:03:31,522 --> 01:03:33,106
But, I didn't say anything
that isn't there.

1160
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:34,480
Are you sure, you didn't?

1161
01:03:34,505 --> 01:03:36,574
Dang. What did you say?

1162
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,785
She's saying that she
only said the truth.

1163
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,972
What truth?

1164
01:03:40,997 --> 01:03:42,121
Whose truth?

1165
01:03:42,146 --> 01:03:43,688
Who told you that
they are truths?

1166
01:03:43,713 --> 01:03:46,001
You'd better respect our
country and its culture,

1167
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:47,818
or else we won't sit quiet.

1168
01:03:47,843 --> 01:03:49,026
- Bro,
- Understand?

1169
01:03:49,068 --> 01:03:51,667
- Bro, she's a kid. Leave her.
- What kid?

1170
01:03:51,692 --> 01:03:53,605
Go Faiza, quick.

1171
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,839
You may study if you want to.

1172
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,808
And don't dig grave
for yourself.

1173
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:01,199
Faiza,

1174
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:04,589
Faiza, C'mon, be bold.

1175
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:09,358
Faiza, Amal is calling.

1176
01:04:11,397 --> 01:04:12,856
Faiza,

1177
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:16,753
- Hello, Amal.
- Why didn't you come to the square?

1178
01:04:16,778 --> 01:04:18,334
Thulsa here.

1179
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:19,943
Where's Faiza?

1180
01:04:20,305 --> 01:04:22,210
Er... Amal, she's here.

1181
01:04:22,235 --> 01:04:23,818
But she's totally upset.

1182
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:25,526
The PVS gang?

1183
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:27,262
- Yeah.
- OK.

1184
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:28,620
You ask her not to get upset.

1185
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:30,021
Tell her I'm coming
to meet her in a bit.

1186
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:31,046
OK.

1187
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:36,291
This University has a good culture.

1188
01:04:36,316 --> 01:04:37,964
It doesn't mean that
we'll always stick to it.

1189
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:39,831
- You'd better not provoke us.
- What did I do for it?

1190
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:42,386
Why the hell did you intimidate
students in the name of politics?

1191
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:50,411
[Indistinct chattering]

1192
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:02,799
He initiated the problems.

1193
01:05:04,413 --> 01:05:06,620
Haibi, take him away.

1194
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:13,099
[Indistinct chattering]

1195
01:05:13,124 --> 01:05:14,959
Hey, act with decorum.

1196
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:16,901
Do you remember any such issue
happening in the campus before?

1197
01:05:16,943 --> 01:05:19,267
They initiated the problems.
You'd better counsel them.

1198
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:21,581
We didn't do anything.
He initiated the issue.

1199
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:22,815
That's OK.
Sit, Hari.

1200
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,965
What the heck?

1201
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,115
See him.

1202
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:30,696
Faiza,

1203
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:32,429
You made a mess out
of it, didn't you?

1204
01:05:32,557 --> 01:05:34,640
Honey, couldn't you
tell me, at least?

1205
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:36,124
I would've dealt it wisely.

1206
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:37,918
Or else you could've told them.

1207
01:05:37,943 --> 01:05:39,959
I know it only when
they told me.

1208
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:42,442
- Haris, we can't blame Faiza.
- That's fine.

1209
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:43,917
She's new to this place.

1210
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:47,334
Didn't I warn you
about your friends?

1211
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,859
Honey, your family
is all tensed up.

1212
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:51,691
I somehow have managed
to calm them down.

1213
01:05:51,716 --> 01:05:54,001
Faiza, leave it.
We'll handle the rest.

1214
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:55,886
You needn't bother it at all.

1215
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,410
You don't have to handle it.

1216
01:05:58,435 --> 01:06:02,185
I know what you're saying,
and what you're going to say.

1217
01:06:02,974 --> 01:06:04,432
I'm not your puppet.

1218
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,604
Well, Haris,

1219
01:06:07,629 --> 01:06:10,230
I heard how you
calmed my family.

1220
01:06:10,255 --> 01:06:12,761
Don't make me swear.
See you later.

1221
01:06:13,276 --> 01:06:15,888
OK, C'mon, let me say...

1222
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:17,330
She's in a bad mood.

1223
01:06:20,904 --> 01:06:21,945
Hello, sir.

1224
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:24,830
How's your health?
Are you fine?

1225
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,688
I'm alright.

1226
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:32,980
Just that I'm upset about
my grand daughter.

1227
01:06:33,005 --> 01:06:35,081
Oops, take it easy, sir.

1228
01:06:35,106 --> 01:06:37,535
That's just a small quarrel
between the students.

1229
01:06:37,856 --> 01:06:39,313
We're here to support her.

1230
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,105
You don't have to get tensed.

1231
01:06:41,151 --> 01:06:43,292
I'm positive about it.

1232
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:47,151
I know she'll not neck
into unwanted things.

1233
01:06:47,176 --> 01:06:48,527
Yes, true.

1234
01:06:48,552 --> 01:06:50,719
Please hang on, I'll give
the phone to Faiza.

1235
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:56,524
He's tensed.

1236
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:57,949
Yes, mom.

1237
01:06:57,984 --> 01:07:00,675
Mom, don't get tensed
for what others say.

1238
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,331
Still, when you hear
many things...

1239
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:06,142
I hope you're calm now.

1240
01:07:07,818 --> 01:07:09,359
- Call later.
- OK.

1241
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
OK.

1242
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,317
OK mom, Peace be upon you.

1243
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:14,193
- And unto you peace.
- Is it a serious issue?

1244
01:07:34,674 --> 01:07:37,753
Thulsa, Thulsa, Get up.

1245
01:07:37,778 --> 01:07:39,902
Your brother is calling you.

1246
01:07:39,927 --> 01:07:41,160
Pick it.

1247
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:47,065
Hello,

1248
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:50,106
Yes, I was sleeping.
What happened?

1249
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,609
Yes, I was sleeping.

1250
01:07:59,637 --> 01:08:00,804
What?

1251
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:01,652
How?

1252
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,343
When did the accident happen?

1253
01:08:03,368 --> 01:08:05,201
What is his condition now?

1254
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,460
Brother, my brother.

1255
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,814
Brother,

1256
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,184
Thulsa,

1257
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:19,626
My brother...

1258
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:23,566
Hello, hello,

1259
01:08:24,611 --> 01:08:26,581
Thulsa's friend,

1260
01:08:34,423 --> 01:08:35,590
Thulsa,

1261
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:39,151
My dear brother,

1262
01:08:53,188 --> 01:08:55,322
In another event of Sawaj violence,

1263
01:08:55,406 --> 01:08:57,074
one more person has been murdered

1264
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,890
in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.

1265
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:00,863
A group of local goons beat

1266
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:05,085
a young man Vilas Chakma to death
accusing him of killing cattles.

1267
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:08,101
Vilas Chakma reportedly
used to skin dead animals

1268
01:09:08,126 --> 01:09:10,900
and sell it to leather
companies for his living.

1269
01:09:10,925 --> 01:09:12,800
We're waiting for more
details on the news.

1270
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,813
Yeah, we'll be there right now.

1271
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:50,149
Brother,

1272
01:09:50,174 --> 01:09:53,715
My dear brother...

1273
01:10:01,165 --> 01:10:03,483
Vilas is accused of stealing cows.

1274
01:10:03,508 --> 01:10:06,204
He, who was beaten up
from Utharakhand,

1275
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:10,121
was caught many times
for stealing cows.

1276
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:12,271
When he got caught this time,

1277
01:10:12,305 --> 01:10:14,946
he was slaughtering a cow.

1278
01:10:14,971 --> 01:10:17,721
When the villagers saw
him do this,

1279
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:20,138
they attacked him.

1280
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:26,427
Hello,

1281
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,667
'Vilas is still alive'

1282
01:10:31,692 --> 01:10:33,859
'He lives in me',

1283
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,138
'He lives in all of us',

1284
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,386
'He's still alive',

1285
01:10:38,428 --> 01:10:40,361
'He lives in me',

1286
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:42,922
'He lives in you',

1287
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,155
'He lives in me',

1288
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,428
'He lives in you',

1289
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:49,804
'He's still alive',

1290
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,363
'He lives in us',

1291
01:10:52,388 --> 01:10:54,463
'He lives in you',

1292
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:56,572
'Vilas is still alive',

1293
01:10:56,597 --> 01:10:58,637
'He lives in me',

1294
01:10:58,662 --> 01:11:00,961
'He lives in you',

1295
01:11:00,986 --> 01:11:02,967
'He is still alive',

1296
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:05,370
'Vilas is still alive',

1297
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:07,426
'He lives in me',

1298
01:11:07,451 --> 01:11:09,659
'He lives in you',

1299
01:11:09,684 --> 01:11:12,320
'Vilas is still alive'.

1300
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:14,378
Friends,

1301
01:11:15,265 --> 01:11:19,265
These people have been suppressing
Dalit voices in this University for years.

1302
01:11:19,915 --> 01:11:22,372
They were even pushing
him to commit suicide.

1303
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:27,879
Now they have started murdering
Dalit people in rural India.

1304
01:11:28,634 --> 01:11:30,088
And why?

1305
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:31,728
For what reason, brothers?

1306
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,442
In the name of job,

1307
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:35,802
that they do for their living?

1308
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,139
In the name of job,

1309
01:11:38,164 --> 01:11:39,872
that he had been
doing for years?

1310
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,542
This is their master plan
to split us.

1311
01:11:44,104 --> 01:11:46,466
The dirty plan to split
our country.

1312
01:11:46,491 --> 01:11:49,117
And we cannot afford
to be quiet, brothers.

1313
01:11:49,545 --> 01:11:51,296
This is not happening
anywhere else.

1314
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:55,475
But here and now.

1315
01:11:56,035 --> 01:12:00,743
Vilas bro, who has given up
his life for these fascists...

1316
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:03,328
He's not just Thulsa's brother.

1317
01:12:04,823 --> 01:12:07,521
Vilas is a symbol for every
Dalit in this country,

1318
01:12:07,548 --> 01:12:10,048
for every minority community
in this country.

1319
01:12:10,522 --> 01:12:13,545
Brothers, these authorities are
not going to find the culprits.

1320
01:12:14,187 --> 01:12:15,436
They will protect them,

1321
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:17,336
praise them, worship them.

1322
01:12:20,349 --> 01:12:23,840
So, let's not ask
for whom the bell tolls.

1323
01:12:24,651 --> 01:12:27,027
This is an attack on
mankind, friends.

1324
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:29,388
As John Donne said,

1325
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:31,655
The bell is tolling for us.

1326
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:36,818
We're the last of us.

1327
01:12:36,843 --> 01:12:39,009
Who all among us will remain?

1328
01:12:39,428 --> 01:12:42,638
All of you were able to come
here on such short notice.

1329
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:44,205
We're all that's left.

1330
01:12:44,821 --> 01:12:46,821
Uncorrupted and Sane.

1331
01:12:48,637 --> 01:12:50,993
So, unite and fight, we shall.

1332
01:12:51,437 --> 01:12:53,562
Unite and fight, we must.

1333
01:12:53,982 --> 01:12:55,731
So, say along with me, brothers.

1334
01:12:56,074 --> 01:12:58,322
'Shout out loud'.

1335
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:01,101
'Stop Caste Discrimination'.

1336
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,571
'Stop, stop'.

1337
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:08,090
- 'Stop Fascism.'
- 'Stop Fascism.'

1338
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:10,473
Now, my brother Adharsh
will talk to you.

1339
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:13,554
Friends,

1340
01:13:14,096 --> 01:13:15,388
Like what Amal said,

1341
01:13:16,221 --> 01:13:18,096
The attack on minorities and Dalits

1342
01:13:18,138 --> 01:13:19,888
are going on in all directions.

1343
01:13:19,915 --> 01:13:22,998
They try to suppress our voices.

1344
01:13:23,995 --> 01:13:26,828
And when they fail to,
they finish them off.

1345
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,367
How pathetic!

1346
01:13:30,718 --> 01:13:34,487
Even Hitler or Musollini would be
taken aback by our condition.

1347
01:13:34,512 --> 01:13:36,055
Hey, what's happening
in our country?

1348
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:37,620
Now they are onto us.

1349
01:13:39,049 --> 01:13:40,422
Yesterday it was Rohan,

1350
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:41,971
Now, it's Thulsa.

1351
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:43,516
Next, you, me.

1352
01:13:43,768 --> 01:13:45,144
Are we slaves?

1353
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:46,512
We're not slaves.

1354
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:51,887
We need to fight for our freedom
to live freely in our country.

1355
01:13:52,337 --> 01:13:53,545
In Our country.

1356
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:57,118
We aren't giving up to
these fascists, are we?

1357
01:13:57,598 --> 01:13:58,882
Are we?

1358
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:00,445
I need a 'No'.

1359
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:06,131
We need to sustain and retain
what we achieved

1360
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:09,094
through the pain and struggle
of our fore fathers.

1361
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:12,396
We are not scared of
their bullying.

1362
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:14,048
- Am I right?
- Yes.

1363
01:14:14,073 --> 01:14:15,875
- Am I right?
- Yes.

1364
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,358
- Jaihind.
- Jaihind.

1365
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:20,010
'Vilas is still alive'.

1366
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:22,538
'He lives in me',

1367
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:25,063
'He lives in you',

1368
01:14:25,088 --> 01:14:27,398
'He lives in all of us',

1369
01:14:27,423 --> 01:14:29,535
'He's still alive',

1370
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,784
'Vilas is still alive'.

1371
01:14:31,809 --> 01:14:34,184
'He lives in you',

1372
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:38,644
I invite Faiza to talk to
you for five minutes.

1373
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:41,723
Come on.

1374
01:14:44,592 --> 01:14:45,728
Do it,

1375
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:46,920
Faiza,

1376
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,401
I...

1377
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,608
I don't know what to say...

1378
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:57,320
particularly.

1379
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:02,366
I mean,

1380
01:15:02,391 --> 01:15:03,600
Amal, you...

1381
01:15:04,153 --> 01:15:05,694
Whatever Amal said...

1382
01:15:06,755 --> 01:15:07,964
In Hindi or English.

1383
01:15:07,989 --> 01:15:09,239
English.

1384
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:14,597
I mean, whatever Amal said,
and Adharsh said

1385
01:15:16,575 --> 01:15:18,389
We know all that.

1386
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:20,372
I mean, we know all of that.

1387
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:24,675
But do we really know
what happened?

1388
01:15:26,734 --> 01:15:29,044
And he was doing his job.

1389
01:15:31,991 --> 01:15:33,490
And some people,

1390
01:15:34,555 --> 01:15:36,656
they just decided that

1391
01:15:37,764 --> 01:15:39,430
he shouldn't live anymore.

1392
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:43,658
They just decided he
shouldn't live anymore.

1393
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:46,025
I, I, It doesn't make sense to me.

1394
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,175
Doesn't... I'm sorry.
I...

1395
01:15:48,825 --> 01:15:50,617
Does it make sense to you?

1396
01:15:51,408 --> 01:15:52,658
Does it?

1397
01:15:53,497 --> 01:15:55,009
So, if they think

1398
01:15:55,034 --> 01:15:57,159
that we don't know what
they are doing to us.

1399
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:58,719
They are wrong.

1400
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:01,800
If they think

1401
01:16:01,825 --> 01:16:04,472
that we're blind to what
they are doing to us.

1402
01:16:04,497 --> 01:16:05,664
They are wrong.

1403
01:16:07,909 --> 01:16:09,408
We're not blind.

1404
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,732
And we will not let them win.

1405
01:16:13,288 --> 01:16:14,871
We are not blind.

1406
01:16:15,372 --> 01:16:16,956
We are not blind.

1407
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:19,563
Everyone, not let them win.

1408
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:21,265
We will not let them win.

1409
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:24,501
- We are not blind.
- We are not blind.

1410
01:16:24,526 --> 01:16:27,453
- We will not let them win.
- We will not let them win.

1411
01:16:27,478 --> 01:16:29,953
Say it along, 'Vilas is still alive',

1412
01:16:29,978 --> 01:16:32,020
'He lives in me',

1413
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:34,089
'He lives in you',

1414
01:16:34,114 --> 01:16:36,486
'He lives in all of us,

1415
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:38,855
'He's still alive'.

1416
01:16:40,765 --> 01:16:42,390
Let's disperse, all.

1417
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,816
Vilas is Thulsa's brother.

1418
01:16:49,841 --> 01:16:51,804
Thulsa is my room mate, so,

1419
01:16:51,829 --> 01:16:53,204
Is it a fake case?

1420
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:55,480
- I'm sorry, what?
- Is it a fake case?

1421
01:16:55,505 --> 01:16:58,029
Aren't you ashamed to
ask such a question?

1422
01:16:58,889 --> 01:17:00,358
No, it's murder.

1423
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:03,072
Vilas death is real.
But that can be fake case by you.

1424
01:17:03,097 --> 01:17:05,787
You should be ashamed yourself.
We've nothing to say to you.

1425
01:17:05,812 --> 01:17:09,450
We're not going to give you bytes so
that you can make money out of it.

1426
01:17:09,475 --> 01:17:10,911
Get lost now.

1427
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:21,254
This is going out of our hands.

1428
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,712
We've to do something about it.

1429
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:25,105
This girl is becoming so
famous these days.

1430
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,463
No it's murder.

1431
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:29,899
If we don't react, everything's
going to get messed up.

1432
01:17:30,486 --> 01:17:31,599
Sushil bro,

1433
01:17:31,624 --> 01:17:33,166
See her adamance.

1434
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,026
You understand why she's here?

1435
01:17:35,706 --> 01:17:36,975
Yes, ask now.

1436
01:17:46,023 --> 01:17:49,260
Hey Amal, They are knocked
down by Faiza's speech.

1437
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:50,861
All of them have gone mad.

1438
01:17:50,886 --> 01:17:52,551
No wonder.

1439
01:17:52,576 --> 01:17:54,582
How many did you say, 50,000?

1440
01:17:54,607 --> 01:17:57,770
Bro, it's 52k likes since
such a short time.

1441
01:17:57,795 --> 01:18:01,115
And this is the biggest publicity we can
ever get for our Fascist movement.

1442
01:18:01,263 --> 01:18:02,777
That's true enough.

1443
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:05,085
Now itself, almost all the
main channels had called

1444
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,693
asking for an interview
with Faiza.

1445
01:18:08,006 --> 01:18:10,006
But her family is bit
concerned and tensed.

1446
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:11,945
We should consider that as well.

1447
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,977
True.

1448
01:18:27,147 --> 01:18:28,272
Thulsa,

1449
01:18:33,653 --> 01:18:36,755
I rang you up several times,
but didn't connect.

1450
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,821
You do one thing.

1451
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,949
You take rest.

1452
01:18:54,588 --> 01:18:55,551
Sleep.

1453
01:18:55,576 --> 01:18:57,321
You'll feel fresh, then.

1454
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:59,096
We can talk afterwards.

1455
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:00,535
Faiza,

1456
01:19:01,287 --> 01:19:03,176
I've to return today itself.

1457
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:08,373
What are you saying, Thulsa?

1458
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:12,049
I'm leaving campus for
a while, Faiza.

1459
01:19:12,904 --> 01:19:14,446
What are you saying?

1460
01:19:16,831 --> 01:19:19,081
Mom has not come
out of the shock.

1461
01:19:19,526 --> 01:19:21,530
She just sits still.

1462
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:23,847
Somebody has to feed her.

1463
01:19:24,986 --> 01:19:26,070
Sister-in-law,

1464
01:19:27,516 --> 01:19:31,184
Even she is worried about
what's going to be next?

1465
01:19:32,255 --> 01:19:33,975
In this situation, how...

1466
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,583
how can I continue here?

1467
01:19:36,882 --> 01:19:39,299
So, what about your research?

1468
01:19:39,789 --> 01:19:41,956
I'll try to continue somehow.

1469
01:19:45,977 --> 01:19:47,061
Thulsa,

1470
01:19:48,774 --> 01:19:51,857
Aren't you a person who has a
positive attitude to everything?

1471
01:19:53,049 --> 01:19:54,676
Let's bring your mom here.

1472
01:19:54,702 --> 01:19:56,244
And consult a doctor here.

1473
01:19:56,634 --> 01:19:57,634
What you say?

1474
01:19:58,029 --> 01:20:00,321
Everything will be OK.
We're...

1475
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:02,624
We're here to support you.

1476
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:04,631
You're not alone.

1477
01:20:04,656 --> 01:20:06,698
You understand that, right?

1478
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:23,672
Can't we do anything about it?

1479
01:20:27,002 --> 01:20:28,418
Other than being passive like this?

1480
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:14,179
I feel that you should make
your Anti-Fascist campaign

1481
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:16,453
a bit more aggressive.

1482
01:21:16,827 --> 01:21:17,706
I mean,

1483
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:20,383
you should lift it up to different
realms possible.

1484
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,706
That's true, Sir.

1485
01:21:21,731 --> 01:21:26,522
Sir, what you say about using the
possibilities of theater for this movement?

1486
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:28,233
Excellent.

1487
01:21:36,576 --> 01:21:38,452
It's a Bollywood mood over here.

1488
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:50,594
If Pothuval sir give it a try,

1489
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:52,619
even our drama can
be staged here.

1490
01:21:53,911 --> 01:21:56,869
But, I wonder if we can recreate
the street play impact here.

1491
01:21:57,966 --> 01:21:59,464
To be frank,

1492
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:01,952
if we alter the play a bit,
we can stage it here itself.

1493
01:22:01,977 --> 01:22:03,019
Exactly.

1494
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:06,775
Great, if we could do it here.

1495
01:22:08,785 --> 01:22:11,259
But, it's not going to happen
in the proper way.

1496
01:22:11,284 --> 01:22:13,326
No, there's an idea.

1497
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,380
Listen,

1498
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:24,000
How about our central
character, a chieftain?

1499
01:22:24,304 --> 01:22:26,929
Nope, that's a common pattern.

1500
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:28,987
Yes, true...

1501
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:31,179
but a chieftain himself
is our problem now.

1502
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:36,272
What if he has a horn?

1503
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:38,100
Horn? Where?

1504
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:40,459
Let me see it?

1505
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:41,567
Look,

1506
01:22:50,394 --> 01:22:51,928
Amazing.

1507
01:22:51,953 --> 01:22:53,232
Nice.

1508
01:22:53,257 --> 01:22:54,884
See,

1509
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:56,034
Nice, know?

1510
01:22:56,924 --> 01:22:59,132
A strange being with
a horn, and a hoof.

1511
01:23:00,171 --> 01:23:02,546
Faiza, could you give a try
writing the scenes of it?

1512
01:23:02,927 --> 01:23:04,676
No way. How come me?

1513
01:23:05,642 --> 01:23:08,018
You have a little experience in
writing, don't you?

1514
01:23:08,203 --> 01:23:09,553
Dare to write it.

1515
01:23:09,578 --> 01:23:12,590
But, you need the dialogues
in Hindi, right?

1516
01:23:12,615 --> 01:23:15,245
That's OK. We'll translate
it afterwards.

1517
01:23:16,269 --> 01:23:17,810
Write, dear.

1518
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,363
Yeah, I'll try.

1519
01:23:19,388 --> 01:23:20,598
- That's it.
- Perfect.

1520
01:23:21,048 --> 01:23:22,131
C'mon.

1521
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:23,986
Positions!

1522
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:25,916
This is My country.

1523
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:30,293
So, your culture, your customs,
your beliefs are My choice.

1524
01:23:31,251 --> 01:23:34,513
I decide on what you should
know, and what you shouldn't,

1525
01:23:34,755 --> 01:23:38,172
what you eat, and
what you wear...

1526
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:43,641
I'm your master, and
this is my stern order.

1527
01:23:44,803 --> 01:23:46,270
Can you duck down a bit,
and do it?

1528
01:23:46,295 --> 01:23:47,944
I mean, can you
bend down a little?

1529
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:49,215
We just have to stand
still, right?

1530
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,101
Yup, just thought
of not blocking them.

1531
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,751
It's you! They come
later only.

1532
01:23:52,776 --> 01:23:55,553
You have to keep the side,
and bend a little.

1533
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:06,393
Faiza, congrats.

1534
01:24:07,482 --> 01:24:10,061
Both the concept and the
dialogues are amazing.

1535
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:13,308
I suggest if we could add
more of visual elements,

1536
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:15,708
and reduce the dialogues
where ever possible.

1537
01:24:16,235 --> 01:24:19,292
That's just my suggestion.
Director's decision shall be the final.

1538
01:24:19,317 --> 01:24:21,667
Sir, I have already taken
a few references.

1539
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:23,650
Very good.
One second.

1540
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,520
Hello, yes...

1541
01:24:30,015 --> 01:24:31,215
What?

1542
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,489
What is it, sir?

1543
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:36,580
Gauri Lankesh, the editor
of Kannada Tabloid,

1544
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:39,251
Gauri Lankesh Patrike,
who is also known for

1545
01:24:39,276 --> 01:24:40,973
her criticism on religious politicism

1546
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:43,429
is shot dead by three
men in Bangalore.

1547
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:46,424
The unknown assailants
fired four bullets

1548
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:48,489
at point blank range.

1549
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:51,931
As she is saying out
loud some bare truths,

1550
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:53,948
two strange figures having
horns and hoofs appear

1551
01:24:53,973 --> 01:24:57,063
on both sides of Gauri Lankesh.

1552
01:24:57,088 --> 01:24:58,691
Full of zeal and zest,

1553
01:24:58,716 --> 01:25:01,904
those strange figures vociferously
approach Gauri Lankesh.

1554
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:35,732
Good morning, sir.

1555
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:37,549
Good morning, sit.

1556
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,448
They have lodged a complaint
to VC,

1557
01:25:42,473 --> 01:25:45,282
saying that this drama
is Anti-National.

1558
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:48,132
Since this program is hosted by us,

1559
01:25:48,157 --> 01:25:50,426
the VC forwarded it to
me asking for a report on it.

1560
01:25:51,123 --> 01:25:54,401
This is clearly an attempt by
the Fascists to halt the play.

1561
01:25:54,426 --> 01:25:56,636
We should somehow overcome it.

1562
01:25:57,004 --> 01:25:58,753
Sir, how long have we
been working for it?

1563
01:25:58,978 --> 01:25:59,720
Yeah.

1564
01:25:59,745 --> 01:26:02,245
We'll never abandon the play.
Don't worry.

1565
01:26:02,499 --> 01:26:03,499
OK.

1566
01:26:04,043 --> 01:26:05,960
Then, there is an idea.

1567
01:26:06,318 --> 01:26:09,235
You ask us for a copy
of the script.

1568
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:11,421
And we submit it.

1569
01:26:11,907 --> 01:26:14,365
You can file your
report based on it.

1570
01:26:15,932 --> 01:26:18,098
You mean a diluted script.

1571
01:26:19,151 --> 01:26:20,492
That's enough.

1572
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:21,643
But,

1573
01:26:21,873 --> 01:26:23,706
don't underestimate them.

1574
01:26:24,306 --> 01:26:26,072
If you're there with us,

1575
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:27,544
we can face anything.

1576
01:26:27,569 --> 01:26:28,985
Am I right, Faiza?

1577
01:26:29,206 --> 01:26:31,705
Sir, the entire college supports us.

1578
01:26:31,855 --> 01:26:33,814
So, we're not worried like that.

1579
01:26:35,998 --> 01:26:37,498
- Let's see.
- Yeah.

1580
01:26:37,956 --> 01:26:39,539
- Thank you, sir.
- Carry on.

1581
01:26:45,457 --> 01:26:47,226
Sir, didn't you see it?

1582
01:26:47,251 --> 01:26:48,789
This play is anti-national.

1583
01:26:49,115 --> 01:26:51,448
And it is against an establishment
even you are a part of.

1584
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:54,780
Moreover, the play was scripted
by Pothuval sir himself.

1585
01:26:54,805 --> 01:26:56,888
And VC has asked report from
the very same person.

1586
01:26:57,271 --> 01:26:58,701
Pothuval...

1587
01:26:58,726 --> 01:27:00,852
he's the mastermind
behind all these.

1588
01:27:00,877 --> 01:27:03,169
The script they have given
to the VC is fake.

1589
01:27:04,098 --> 01:27:06,932
OK, OK, I'll discuss this with VC.

1590
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:09,344
We can find out a solution.

1591
01:27:09,751 --> 01:27:10,664
Sir,

1592
01:27:10,689 --> 01:27:15,315
This drama is officially banned
inside the campus.

1593
01:27:15,942 --> 01:27:17,567
Still, if they want to stage it,

1594
01:27:17,662 --> 01:27:19,489
they would do it on the roads.

1595
01:27:19,514 --> 01:27:21,265
Even then, the public
would watch it.

1596
01:27:22,005 --> 01:27:24,520
Sir, I can assure you one thing.

1597
01:27:25,182 --> 01:27:28,409
If they stage the drama here,
the campus will burn.

1598
01:27:28,782 --> 01:27:29,907
That's for sure.

1599
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:33,432
C'mon.

1600
01:27:37,964 --> 01:27:39,047
Good morning.

1601
01:27:46,473 --> 01:27:48,178
- Namaste Pothuval sir.
- Namaste.

1602
01:27:48,203 --> 01:27:49,577
- How are you?
- Namaste.

1603
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:51,353
He is party's District Chief
in Delhi.

1604
01:27:51,856 --> 01:27:53,773
- Namaste Pothuval.
- Namaste.

1605
01:27:54,605 --> 01:27:56,522
Sir, did we ever trouble you?

1606
01:27:56,666 --> 01:27:58,498
Why are You troubling
us so much?

1607
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:00,564
What did I do?

1608
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,818
He's talking about the drama.

1609
01:28:03,304 --> 01:28:05,298
What's wrong with the drama?
What's the issue?

1610
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:07,179
This is an anti-national drama, sir.

1611
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:08,873
We won't allow this
in the campus.

1612
01:28:08,898 --> 01:28:10,398
Who are you to decide that?

1613
01:28:10,676 --> 01:28:12,176
You're not a student
in the campus.

1614
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:13,565
You're an outsider, right?

1615
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,509
Then how can you
detect this to me?

1616
01:28:15,678 --> 01:28:16,814
Pothuval sir,

1617
01:28:16,839 --> 01:28:18,895
Sir, don't you belong
to a good family?

1618
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,504
Then, why are you with
such naive students?

1619
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:22,404
So, that's the thing.

1620
01:28:22,707 --> 01:28:24,748
Since I'm from a good family,

1621
01:28:24,773 --> 01:28:27,900
I should keep my eyes shut at
the crimes committed by nobles.

1622
01:28:27,925 --> 01:28:28,748
Am I right?

1623
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:31,089
Talking about nobility and royalty,

1624
01:28:31,114 --> 01:28:32,904
I'm the son of a great leader,

1625
01:28:32,929 --> 01:28:37,514
who faced intimidation from nobles
for unveiling the crimes they did.

1626
01:28:37,539 --> 01:28:39,413
Better make your leader
know of it.

1627
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,349
Such a show-off.

1628
01:28:42,374 --> 01:28:43,790
You're a professor.

1629
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:46,248
And that is why we were
giving you respect till now.

1630
01:28:46,437 --> 01:28:50,679
But we understood that
it is of no use.

1631
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:53,560
Listen, no matter you go any
extent against our country,

1632
01:28:53,585 --> 01:28:55,395
we will be there
to watch over it.

1633
01:28:55,423 --> 01:28:58,006
Hereafter, we will not talk, but
show it through our actions.

1634
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,083
Who did you say he is?

1635
01:29:00,108 --> 01:29:01,589
District Chief.

1636
01:29:01,614 --> 01:29:03,839
Just make him understand that

1637
01:29:03,864 --> 01:29:06,454
not even a National Chief, superior
to him can move Pothuval.

1638
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,261
Otherwise, I can say it myself.

1639
01:29:08,286 --> 01:29:09,411
Listen,

1640
01:29:09,495 --> 01:29:11,870
Not your Party office
is paying me salary.

1641
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:14,051
Here comes big-wig nationalists.

1642
01:29:14,637 --> 01:29:17,842
When hundreds of leaders were
dying for India's Independence,

1643
01:29:17,867 --> 01:29:20,445
You were licking the boots of British. Is
it the nationalism you're talking about?

1644
01:29:21,135 --> 01:29:23,907
Is worshiping the murderer of our
Father of Nation called Nationalism?

1645
01:29:24,483 --> 01:29:26,235
Stop your blabbering.

1646
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,153
Get lost.

1647
01:29:33,276 --> 01:29:34,608
He's speaking too much.

1648
01:29:34,633 --> 01:29:36,343
We'll strike back later.

1649
01:29:36,929 --> 01:29:40,579
As an Anti-National content has been
noted in the above mentioned drama,

1650
01:29:40,604 --> 01:29:44,773
its performance presentation has been
forbidden and banned in the university.

1651
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:49,854
Everyone at campus now, knows
that our drama has been banned.

1652
01:29:49,879 --> 01:29:52,039
So, making it happen
is our prestige issue.

1653
01:29:52,064 --> 01:29:53,981
I don't think we can make it.

1654
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:56,412
We will do it for sure.

1655
01:29:57,352 --> 01:29:59,772
I don't think we can do
the rehearsals here.

1656
01:29:59,797 --> 01:30:00,880
Yeah.

1657
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,870
We'll have to find another
place for it.

1658
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,723
I can arrange it.

1659
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:06,290
- OK.
- Are you sure?

1660
01:30:06,516 --> 01:30:08,392
Yes, don't worry about it.

1661
01:30:08,893 --> 01:30:10,067
So, that means,

1662
01:30:10,092 --> 01:30:12,693
we're continuing with
the drama, right?

1663
01:30:12,718 --> 01:30:14,760
- Yes.
- Let's face it all.

1664
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:16,900
- Definitely.
- Will see.

1665
01:30:28,462 --> 01:30:30,409
One second, relax, relax.

1666
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:33,535
Amal, where are you right now?

1667
01:30:33,839 --> 01:30:34,997
I called you many times.

1668
01:30:35,022 --> 01:30:36,438
I'm in between the
rehearsals, Sir.

1669
01:30:36,676 --> 01:30:38,427
Here, the network is not proper.

1670
01:30:38,452 --> 01:30:39,868
Is there any problem?

1671
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:43,306
Yes, Amal, there are some
problems.

1672
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,540
What they are trying is not to
confront you on political terms,

1673
01:30:46,565 --> 01:30:49,885
but to kill your confidence by
mentally torturing you.

1674
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:51,231
What happened now?

1675
01:30:51,256 --> 01:30:52,714
Faisa is their target.

1676
01:30:53,098 --> 01:30:56,053
For them, she's a prey who doesn't
deserve any kind of consideration.

1677
01:30:56,078 --> 01:30:57,703
They are moving things
to get Faisa arrested.

1678
01:30:58,273 --> 01:31:00,097
Arrest?
What are you saying?

1679
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:01,656
She must do something if at
all they have to arrest her.

1680
01:31:02,422 --> 01:31:03,725
These days, even innocents
can get arrested.

1681
01:31:04,447 --> 01:31:07,175
She's alleged to have chanted
anti-national slogans.

1682
01:31:07,481 --> 01:31:08,897
This is a fabricated case..

1683
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,564
But, they must not get hold
of Faisa at the moment.

1684
01:31:11,589 --> 01:31:13,468
We must hide her somewhere.

1685
01:31:13,964 --> 01:31:16,381
Faisa must be protected
at any cost.

1686
01:31:16,981 --> 01:31:18,828
I have sent Adharsh to you.

1687
01:31:18,853 --> 01:31:20,281
OK! OK, Sir.

1688
01:31:20,306 --> 01:31:21,930
- OK.
- Bye.

1689
01:31:30,884 --> 01:31:32,551
Amal, stick to the by roads.

1690
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:34,730
Get in.

1691
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,839
- Faiza, cover your face.
- OK.

1692
01:31:39,142 --> 01:31:40,557
Let's go.

1693
01:31:53,795 --> 01:31:56,024
A case has been filed against a
student from University campus

1694
01:31:56,049 --> 01:31:58,058
accusing her of treason.

1695
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,933
The Delhi police registered
the case against Faiza Sufiya,

1696
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:03,899
a Malayali who is doing research
at University campus

1697
01:32:03,924 --> 01:32:06,311
accusing her of treason.

1698
01:32:16,885 --> 01:32:18,552
What's going on?

1699
01:32:25,588 --> 01:32:26,922
- Come inside.
- Yeah.

1700
01:32:27,653 --> 01:32:29,903
- Come.
- Namaste.

1701
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:33,002
- Sit.
- Come, please sit.

1702
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:36,858
I'll get you something to drink.

1703
01:32:42,869 --> 01:32:44,869
I could accommodate
her in my house.

1704
01:32:45,186 --> 01:32:48,133
But, you know Padmakumar, right?

1705
01:32:48,535 --> 01:32:49,443
Yes.

1706
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:52,574
His camera is always watching us.

1707
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:53,799
Yeah, I know.

1708
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:56,327
Pothuval sir told me everything.

1709
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:58,164
You seem to be too tired.

1710
01:32:58,383 --> 01:33:00,716
Take a shower, and you
will feel fresh.

1711
01:33:02,807 --> 01:33:05,283
See, I've kept the towel
and soap here.

1712
01:33:07,636 --> 01:33:09,969
Tell me if you need anything else.

1713
01:33:11,816 --> 01:33:13,358
Don't worry dear,

1714
01:33:13,383 --> 01:33:16,341
Your family will accept this
in the course of time.

1715
01:33:18,948 --> 01:33:21,074
How do you know Gazal Raza?

1716
01:33:21,624 --> 01:33:23,649
We met at a function.

1717
01:33:23,674 --> 01:33:26,108
Bincy, you come here.
Let them take rest.

1718
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:28,383
OK then, good night.

1719
01:33:28,758 --> 01:33:30,217
- OK.
- Good night.

1720
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:41,096
Faiza, you freshen up.

1721
01:33:41,605 --> 01:33:43,105
I'll be there outside.

1722
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:45,201
Amal,

1723
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:50,274
What happened?

1724
01:33:50,299 --> 01:33:53,117
I want to make a call home.

1725
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:55,319
What's the big deal?

1726
01:33:57,251 --> 01:33:58,251
Take it.

1727
01:33:58,987 --> 01:33:59,903
Thanks.

1728
01:33:59,928 --> 01:34:01,095
I'm outside.

1729
01:34:08,487 --> 01:34:09,989
Nadira, you have a call.

1730
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:14,981
Hello.

1731
01:34:15,006 --> 01:34:16,048
Mom.

1732
01:34:16,341 --> 01:34:17,841
Faizu, my daughter...

1733
01:34:21,341 --> 01:34:23,383
What all things I'm hearing
about you?

1734
01:34:24,772 --> 01:34:26,481
Don't you know me?

1735
01:34:26,506 --> 01:34:28,507
This is a fake case.

1736
01:34:30,516 --> 01:34:32,196
Police had come here too.

1737
01:34:32,938 --> 01:34:35,639
Faizu, what is it that we can do?

1738
01:34:37,142 --> 01:34:39,808
Mom, don't worry.

1739
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:42,502
There are a lot of people
here taking care of me.

1740
01:34:42,527 --> 01:34:44,877
The professor has arranged
an advocate too.

1741
01:34:44,902 --> 01:34:47,089
Everything will settle in two days.

1742
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:48,917
I'll meet you thereafter.

1743
01:34:48,942 --> 01:34:50,440
If Allah wills.

1744
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:53,877
We haven't hurt anyone.

1745
01:34:54,888 --> 01:34:56,679
So, god will save us.

1746
01:35:00,229 --> 01:35:02,149
I'll call you later, mom.

1747
01:35:02,732 --> 01:35:03,774
OK.

1748
01:35:16,915 --> 01:35:18,958
- Thanks.
- How are things at home?

1749
01:35:19,384 --> 01:35:20,384
Sit.

1750
01:35:25,362 --> 01:35:26,569
Everyone OK?

1751
01:35:29,712 --> 01:35:30,870
It's worse.

1752
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:33,542
Police had visited my house.

1753
01:35:38,221 --> 01:35:39,846
I was expecting it.

1754
01:35:40,089 --> 01:35:41,256
Until today,

1755
01:35:42,502 --> 01:35:44,536
that was a home of
a freedom fighter.

1756
01:35:45,868 --> 01:35:46,958
But now,

1757
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,849
that is a house of a traitor.

1758
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:54,560
Grandpa,

1759
01:35:54,585 --> 01:35:56,710
Faiza, what crap are you saying?

1760
01:35:57,507 --> 01:35:59,750
You yourself know that
this is a fabricated case.

1761
01:36:00,835 --> 01:36:04,542
The video of you shoving off the
Public TV reporter got viral.

1762
01:36:04,635 --> 01:36:06,593
They were humiliated by it.

1763
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:09,710
This case is just a revenge for it.

1764
01:36:11,445 --> 01:36:13,974
We have with us, the original
footage that exactly prove

1765
01:36:13,999 --> 01:36:16,457
what our protest and slogans were.

1766
01:36:17,019 --> 01:36:18,955
We can easily prove it in the court.

1767
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,163
For now, you shouldn't
get caught.

1768
01:36:21,188 --> 01:36:22,188
That's all.

1769
01:36:28,178 --> 01:36:30,261
But, how long...?
Like this?

1770
01:36:31,943 --> 01:36:33,193
Faiza,

1771
01:36:35,776 --> 01:36:38,026
It's just a matter of 2-3 days.

1772
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:41,224
Venugopal, the advocate
picked up by Pothuval sir

1773
01:36:41,249 --> 01:36:43,033
is one of the senior
lawyers in Delhi.

1774
01:36:43,475 --> 01:36:45,309
Moreover, he's an activist too.

1775
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:50,408
He's handled numerous
cases of this kind.

1776
01:36:50,433 --> 01:36:52,221
He'll be able to help us out.

1777
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:54,887
All these years...

1778
01:36:56,135 --> 01:36:59,274
The protection I received
from my family,

1779
01:37:01,651 --> 01:37:04,458
was my strength.

1780
01:37:04,483 --> 01:37:05,627
But now...

1781
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:07,693
I feel weakened.

1782
01:37:11,574 --> 01:37:12,574
Buddy,

1783
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:16,205
Hope you know that
you're not alone.

1784
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:08,643
Faiza, good morning.

1785
01:38:08,668 --> 01:38:09,793
Good morning.

1786
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:14,877
Amal,

1787
01:38:15,235 --> 01:38:16,235
Amal,

1788
01:38:16,692 --> 01:38:17,733
Good morning.

1789
01:38:18,276 --> 01:38:19,276
Good morning.

1790
01:38:19,535 --> 01:38:20,910
Have your tea.

1791
01:38:21,282 --> 01:38:22,282
Thank you.

1792
01:38:24,563 --> 01:38:25,688
Faiza,

1793
01:38:29,626 --> 01:38:31,502
It's the lead news in
media today.

1794
01:38:32,688 --> 01:38:33,896
Faiza's issue.

1795
01:38:34,517 --> 01:38:35,858
That too with her photo.

1796
01:38:35,883 --> 01:38:37,633
We need to do something
immediately.

1797
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:40,602
Otherwise...

1798
01:38:40,627 --> 01:38:42,086
things will go out of our hands.

1799
01:39:04,713 --> 01:39:05,838
Oh, god.

1800
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,635
Sir, we're going to
a nearby place.

1801
01:40:14,621 --> 01:40:16,062
Take off your Burka.

1802
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:19,118
Remove it.

1803
01:40:22,646 --> 01:40:23,938
Can't you hear me?

1804
01:40:33,962 --> 01:40:35,045
OK, go.

1805
01:40:51,556 --> 01:40:52,596
Faiza,

1806
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:56,350
I don't think it's safe to
travel anymore tonight.

1807
01:41:00,313 --> 01:41:03,171
Listen, what about we
stay here tonight?

1808
01:41:11,493 --> 01:41:12,534
Get down.

1809
01:41:20,553 --> 01:41:21,553
Come.

1810
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,570
What's wrong?

1811
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:37,625
Can I get some drinking water?

1812
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:41,121
Uncle,

1813
01:41:42,231 --> 01:41:44,273
Do you have some drinking water?

1814
01:41:44,468 --> 01:41:45,679
Yes. I have.

1815
01:41:45,704 --> 01:41:48,163
- Will you drink tea?
- That's cool.

1816
01:41:48,188 --> 01:41:49,313
Tea is ready.

1817
01:41:49,338 --> 01:41:50,387
Have it if you wish to.

1818
01:41:50,424 --> 01:41:51,715
OK, thank you.

1819
01:41:58,101 --> 01:42:01,006
Our campus is stirred up
over Faiza's issue.

1820
01:42:01,765 --> 01:42:03,432
They completely support us.

1821
01:42:06,358 --> 01:42:08,025
What about our drama?

1822
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:11,490
That's not our priority for now.

1823
01:42:11,515 --> 01:42:12,848
That's not it, Amal.

1824
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:18,484
We must stage the drama
at any cost.

1825
01:42:19,593 --> 01:42:20,802
Otherwise...

1826
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:23,479
it would be like an
absolute surrender.

1827
01:42:23,925 --> 01:42:25,096
After fighting so much...

1828
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,551
There is no word 'Surrender'
in our dictionary.

1829
01:42:29,747 --> 01:42:32,913
It's equivalent to giving away
the entire University to them.

1830
01:42:34,098 --> 01:42:36,223
Pothuval sir had called 2-3 times.

1831
01:42:36,507 --> 01:42:39,091
He has moved for an
anticipatory bail.

1832
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:43,113
I'll have to go and
meet him tomorrow.

1833
01:42:46,853 --> 01:42:49,375
I'll come back soon.

1834
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:04,326
Mom... mom,

1835
01:43:08,681 --> 01:43:09,806
What's wrong?

1836
01:43:21,753 --> 01:43:23,003
What's wrong?

1837
01:43:23,903 --> 01:43:24,903
Mom...

1838
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:30,122
Amal, would they hurt my
mom and grandpa?

1839
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:48,175
This is a criminal case
registered under

1840
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:51,425
Sections 124 A, 141, 142 and 146.

1841
01:43:51,669 --> 01:43:55,578
It's a bit difficult to get
anticipatory bail for such cases.

1842
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:58,954
We have with us, the original
footage of Slogans.

1843
01:43:59,437 --> 01:44:01,150
Can't we present
it in the court?

1844
01:44:01,175 --> 01:44:02,342
Yes, we can.

1845
01:44:02,517 --> 01:44:03,499
Sir,

1846
01:44:03,524 --> 01:44:06,565
Faiza is highly secular,
moreover...

1847
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:11,096
Her enemies are those extremists
belonging to her own community.

1848
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:14,731
But, what the court
needs is Proof.

1849
01:44:15,192 --> 01:44:16,946
Sir, Faiza is a person who
unfailingly posts her opinion

1850
01:44:16,971 --> 01:44:18,784
about various social issues
on Facebook.

1851
01:44:18,809 --> 01:44:21,516
You can very well understand
it from her FB posts.

1852
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:30,012
We can present all these at the
court at the time of hearing.

1853
01:44:30,037 --> 01:44:33,734
But, can't say how far it is helpful
for getting the anticipatory bail.

1854
01:44:35,156 --> 01:44:37,546
Anyways, let me talk
to Venugopal sir.

1855
01:44:37,942 --> 01:44:39,359
I'll do my best.

1856
01:44:39,542 --> 01:44:41,126
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1857
01:44:41,543 --> 01:44:42,710
So, let's leave?

1858
01:44:42,906 --> 01:44:43,947
OK.

1859
01:44:44,267 --> 01:44:45,559
Thank you.

1860
01:44:49,577 --> 01:44:52,600
Sir, he talks as if he
lacks confidence.

1861
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,506
We can't blame him, Amal.

1862
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:59,306
This case is more serious
than we think it is.

1863
01:45:00,147 --> 01:45:02,800
Get the documents signed from
Faiza, and bring it here now itself.

1864
01:45:02,825 --> 01:45:04,331
I'll do it now itself, sir.

1865
01:45:04,356 --> 01:45:06,575
I've an important meeting now.

1866
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,522
- Adharsh, you join me.
- Sure.

1867
01:45:08,884 --> 01:45:10,676
- I'll be back.
- Thanks dear.

1868
01:45:11,601 --> 01:45:13,546
Rohan, l'm leaving.

1869
01:45:14,904 --> 01:45:17,018
We've just 4 days left
for our drama.

1870
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:19,359
There's no problem at all.

1871
01:45:19,728 --> 01:45:20,698
We'll make it happen.

1872
01:45:20,723 --> 01:45:22,890
On the very same day as decided.

1873
01:45:23,481 --> 01:45:25,441
We'll manage to get
the bail before that.

1874
01:45:26,063 --> 01:45:27,022
And listen,

1875
01:45:27,047 --> 01:45:29,421
You must take care of the pending
works regarding costumes.

1876
01:45:29,446 --> 01:45:30,418
- OK?
- Fine.

1877
01:45:30,443 --> 01:45:32,414
And you should continue
with the rehearsals.

1878
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:34,297
Please fix all the problems
as needed.

1879
01:45:34,322 --> 01:45:35,902
I must finish some work
immediately. Be back soon.

1880
01:45:35,927 --> 01:45:36,927
Sure.

1881
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:58,242
Faiza,

1882
01:45:58,901 --> 01:46:01,276
- Where had you gone?
- To a nearby place, why?

1883
01:46:01,301 --> 01:46:04,259
Police took away our dad
and the girl with them.

1884
01:46:04,753 --> 01:46:06,100
What are you saying?
When...?

1885
01:46:06,128 --> 01:46:07,545
Some time back.

1886
01:46:09,181 --> 01:46:12,056
- Where is the police station?
- It's nearby, please inquire.

1887
01:46:21,609 --> 01:46:23,402
Sir, just a minute.

1888
01:46:26,932 --> 01:46:29,016
Hello Sir, I'm Amal.

1889
01:46:29,043 --> 01:46:31,797
- Didn't you bring any girl
here, today morning? - No.

1890
01:46:32,081 --> 01:46:33,789
From under the Lohapool bridge.

1891
01:46:33,814 --> 01:46:36,148
She carried a backpack,
name is Faiza.

1892
01:46:36,173 --> 01:46:37,922
No, no, no such person
was brought here.

1893
01:46:37,947 --> 01:46:41,275
I inquired at the other police station,
they told that she would be here.

1894
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,672
No brother, don't waste time.

1895
01:46:42,697 --> 01:46:44,364
No one was brought here.

1896
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:49,318
OK, Thank you, sir.

1897
01:47:16,665 --> 01:47:18,372
- Hello,
- Amal,

1898
01:47:18,397 --> 01:47:20,604
I'm waiting here at
the hotel, Queens.

1899
01:47:21,094 --> 01:47:22,884
Faiza's grandpa will be
here in a while.

1900
01:47:23,451 --> 01:47:25,956
Amal, you come here with the
documents signed by Faiza.

1901
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:28,266
We'll meet him first, and then
move to advocate's office.

1902
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:30,872
Sir, there's a problem. I...

1903
01:47:31,851 --> 01:47:32,781
I shall explain it there.

1904
01:47:32,806 --> 01:47:34,431
What's it?
What's the matter?

1905
01:47:34,456 --> 01:47:35,772
Sir, Faiza...

1906
01:47:36,828 --> 01:47:39,712
When I got back, she wasn't
there at the place I left her.

1907
01:47:40,969 --> 01:47:43,375
Amal, what are you saying?

1908
01:47:43,474 --> 01:47:46,534
A lady over there said that, she
was taken away by the police.

1909
01:48:02,379 --> 01:48:03,502
Please come.

1910
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:05,182
Where's my Faiza?

1911
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:06,603
She'll be here in some time.

1912
01:48:06,628 --> 01:48:08,873
Till then, you can take
rest here in a room.

1913
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,837
Which group do you belong to?

1914
01:48:12,337 --> 01:48:14,647
Tell the truth, who sent you here?

1915
01:48:14,999 --> 01:48:16,643
Which group do you belong to?

1916
01:48:16,668 --> 01:48:19,097
You'd better confess everything.

1917
01:48:19,122 --> 01:48:21,105
We'll soon present you
in the court.

1918
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:23,418
You'll get bail too.

1919
01:48:23,443 --> 01:48:25,563
Then you can meet your family.

1920
01:48:25,588 --> 01:48:28,169
Otherwise you'll never get
back to them.

1921
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:29,747
I hope you understood.

1922
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:31,346
Don't act up.

1923
01:48:31,371 --> 01:48:32,807
What's your intention?

1924
01:48:33,029 --> 01:48:36,196
It was my dream since childhood

1925
01:48:36,221 --> 01:48:39,057
of pursuing my studies
and research here.

1926
01:48:39,082 --> 01:48:41,325
That's only why I'm here.

1927
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:43,600
And I wanted to be on
Abdur Rahman Sahib.

1928
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:45,541
Abdur Rahman Sahib, who's that?

1929
01:48:45,904 --> 01:48:46,838
No idea.

1930
01:48:46,863 --> 01:48:49,207
The country doesn't even
know his name.

1931
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:52,438
And you've come here to do
research on His life?

1932
01:48:53,013 --> 01:48:54,657
You can pursue this
in your village.

1933
01:48:56,485 --> 01:48:57,444
What is this all about?

1934
01:48:57,469 --> 01:48:59,345
How long since you know him?

1935
01:48:59,717 --> 01:49:02,508
He, who protects the nexalites
and terrorists of the place

1936
01:49:02,537 --> 01:49:05,253
helped you go into hiding.
Am I right?

1937
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,500
Come on.

1938
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,500
Sir.

1939
01:49:21,428 --> 01:49:23,569
How many years since
you know her?

1940
01:49:23,594 --> 01:49:26,986
I've told you several times
that I don't know her.

1941
01:49:27,011 --> 01:49:29,446
I'm telling you again
I don't know her.

1942
01:49:30,557 --> 01:49:31,932
You're lying.

1943
01:49:32,515 --> 01:49:34,355
Sir, sir, please don't thrash him.

1944
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:36,952
- We know everything.
- Please leave him. - Shove off.

1945
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:43,486
Make him also understand.

1946
01:49:43,511 --> 01:49:45,114
Why are you smacking her?

1947
01:49:45,139 --> 01:49:46,594
Coz you people are liars.

1948
01:49:46,635 --> 01:49:48,676
Don't act innocent.

1949
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:50,482
You yourself chose
your destiny, isn't it?

1950
01:49:50,507 --> 01:49:52,610
We'll make your life difficult.

1951
01:50:00,326 --> 01:50:01,662
What's the matter?

1952
01:50:01,687 --> 01:50:04,020
Sir, I'm Rajeev Menon from
Venugopal Associates.

1953
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,054
He's Mr.Mussaliar.

1954
01:50:06,101 --> 01:50:08,486
He's from Kerala, and
he has a complaint,

1955
01:50:08,765 --> 01:50:09,974
Show me.

1956
01:50:14,324 --> 01:50:15,449
Sir,

1957
01:50:16,074 --> 01:50:21,523
Your police illegally arrested
my grand daughter.

1958
01:50:21,923 --> 01:50:23,839
I want to meet her.

1959
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:27,920
Sir, he came all the way from
Kerala only to meet her.

1960
01:50:29,196 --> 01:50:30,404
Sorry, sir.

1961
01:50:30,429 --> 01:50:32,673
We haven't arrested
any such person.

1962
01:50:33,573 --> 01:50:35,157
Our records say it all.

1963
01:50:35,466 --> 01:50:37,238
Go ask her friends.

1964
01:50:37,789 --> 01:50:40,217
Who knows, she might have
ran away with her lover.

1965
01:50:40,242 --> 01:50:41,997
Girls these days are like that.

1966
01:50:42,022 --> 01:50:44,310
Sir, sir... please,

1967
01:50:44,335 --> 01:50:47,613
Sir, this took place within
your police station area.

1968
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:52,129
And you're duty bound
to conduct an inquiry into this

1969
01:50:52,154 --> 01:50:53,737
and accept my complaint.

1970
01:50:54,559 --> 01:50:56,207
Don't waste my time.
Get out.

1971
01:50:56,232 --> 01:50:58,817
Sir, I'm not here for taking
any favour from you.

1972
01:50:58,842 --> 01:51:01,238
This place is about
Law and Order.

1973
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,648
That is why I'm telling you.

1974
01:51:02,685 --> 01:51:05,529
Please understand your responsibility
and do your duty.

1975
01:51:05,554 --> 01:51:07,548
Don't you have to
teach me my duty.

1976
01:51:07,573 --> 01:51:08,892
Who the hell are you?

1977
01:51:08,917 --> 01:51:11,460
Show me your identity card.
C'mon, take out your ID card.

1978
01:51:11,485 --> 01:51:13,018
Show him the ID card.

1979
01:51:13,043 --> 01:51:14,709
Sir, he's a freedom fighter.

1980
01:51:17,752 --> 01:51:19,102
Hey sir, please sir,

1981
01:51:19,127 --> 01:51:21,502
- Get out, will you?
- Sir, what are you doing?

1982
01:51:21,527 --> 01:51:24,686
Son of a dog, I'll put
you behind bars.

1983
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,055
- You'll never see the world outside.
- Playing with Delhi police, huh?

1984
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:27,908
He's such an old man.

1985
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:30,042
Take him out, will you?

1986
01:51:30,912 --> 01:51:32,912
If you dare mess up with police...

1987
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:35,530
Read the news once in a while.

1988
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,035
I'll call you back.

1989
01:51:47,411 --> 01:51:50,002
Please don't disturb
him, he's so tired.

1990
01:51:50,027 --> 01:51:53,096
You can ask questions, but
 don't disturb him, please.

1991
01:51:53,121 --> 01:51:54,845
What do you have to
say about Faiza?

1992
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:57,639
- See, see, the fact is,
- When did you speak to her last time?

1993
01:51:57,664 --> 01:51:59,395
See, the police arrested her.

1994
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:01,224
The police arrested her...

1995
01:52:01,249 --> 01:52:03,120
Now, but, they're denying that
they have not arrested her.

1996
01:52:03,145 --> 01:52:04,889
No one is missing here.

1997
01:52:04,914 --> 01:52:06,192
She has been arrested.

1998
01:52:06,217 --> 01:52:07,883
But, he's denying that
she has been arrested.

1999
01:52:07,908 --> 01:52:11,542
See, he's a freedom fighter.
He has the right to see her.

2000
01:52:11,567 --> 01:52:13,065
He's asking that where is she?

2001
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:14,909
That's the treatment a
man like him is getting.

2002
01:52:14,922 --> 01:52:16,818
What happens to regular people
who're walking to a station?

2003
01:52:16,843 --> 01:52:18,700
And we have taken...
We've proof.

2004
01:52:18,725 --> 01:52:20,112
We have the original
video with us.

2005
01:52:20,137 --> 01:52:22,304
You... you've to search
and find her.

2006
01:52:23,268 --> 01:52:24,642
Hello, sir.

2007
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,611
Hello.

2008
01:52:27,637 --> 01:52:29,475
Have you arrested the girl?

2009
01:52:30,548 --> 01:52:33,447
We'll not move from here,

2010
01:52:33,472 --> 01:52:35,693
until and unless we
know the truth.

2011
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:38,906
If at all you've arrested the girl,

2012
01:52:39,294 --> 01:52:42,709
you should've presented her
at the court immediately.

2013
01:52:44,254 --> 01:52:46,981
What is this? Are you taking
the law into your hands?

2014
01:52:48,186 --> 01:52:51,737
If not..., you'll have
to arrest us also.

2015
01:53:00,189 --> 01:53:01,855
Please, please, please.

2016
01:53:03,394 --> 01:53:05,103
See, see, see, see,

2017
01:53:05,128 --> 01:53:07,253
Ms.Faizal Sufiya is in our custody.

2018
01:53:07,278 --> 01:53:09,027
We will produce her in the court.

2019
01:53:21,621 --> 01:53:22,746
Faiza,

2020
01:53:25,363 --> 01:53:27,440
We're going to produce you
in the court tomorrow.

2021
01:53:27,465 --> 01:53:30,143
Don't think you can
talk crap there.

2022
01:53:30,168 --> 01:53:32,306
Remember that you're
coming back here itself.

2023
01:53:32,675 --> 01:53:35,618
We've been very friendly
with you so far.

2024
01:53:36,569 --> 01:53:38,212
Let her take bath
and freshen up.

2025
01:53:38,237 --> 01:53:40,570
We need to take her
to the court.

2026
01:53:42,307 --> 01:53:44,140
Get up, Faiza, hello...

2027
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:47,709
The charges against the
accused, Faiza Sufiya is

2028
01:53:47,734 --> 01:53:50,866
anti-national activities, and today she
has been brought to the court...

2029
01:53:50,891 --> 01:53:52,456
They will delay it to
the maximum.

2030
01:53:52,472 --> 01:53:54,297
Faiza Sufiya is being brought
 to the court today...

2031
01:53:54,322 --> 01:53:56,250
Will she get bail or not?

2032
01:53:56,275 --> 01:53:58,317
Everyone is anxiously waiting
 to know about it.

2033
01:54:36,966 --> 01:54:38,592
Grandpa,

2034
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:40,142
Faizu,

2035
01:55:07,234 --> 01:55:08,442
Hearing is over.

2036
01:55:08,689 --> 01:55:10,731
The verdict will come
at 4.00 pm.

2037
01:55:11,145 --> 01:55:12,168
Let's wait.

2038
01:55:12,193 --> 01:55:13,359
Hope for the best.

2039
01:55:13,751 --> 01:55:16,162
Amal, no problem there, right?

2040
01:55:16,187 --> 01:55:18,438
We're almost set.

2041
01:55:19,572 --> 01:55:20,572
OK.

2042
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:23,092
Oh, it's tight for me.

2043
01:55:24,349 --> 01:55:26,349
- Let's go?
- Yes, quick.

2044
01:55:27,536 --> 01:55:29,987
The University has banned
the drama.

2045
01:55:30,431 --> 01:55:32,375
Police will not let it happen,

2046
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,606
We should make sure that
they have all our support.

2047
01:55:34,631 --> 01:55:36,466
Will the audience be quiet?

2048
01:55:36,785 --> 01:55:38,832
Anyways, we will plan everything.

2049
01:55:38,857 --> 01:55:40,150
What you say?

2050
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,029
Gandhi.

2051
01:55:56,118 --> 01:55:57,202
Nehru.

2052
01:56:02,235 --> 01:56:03,235
Tagore?

2053
01:56:04,782 --> 01:56:06,698
Oh, Vivekanandji,

2054
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:13,154
Ambedkar.

2055
01:56:16,688 --> 01:56:18,189
By the by, who's this?

2056
01:56:21,898 --> 01:56:23,315
Who is this?

2057
01:56:23,872 --> 01:56:24,997
What?

2058
01:56:27,159 --> 01:56:28,867
Oh, Kalburgi.

2059
01:56:29,252 --> 01:56:30,502
Good.

2060
01:56:31,657 --> 01:56:33,032
Kalburgi.

2061
01:56:36,109 --> 01:56:38,847
Well, all the celebrities
come here.

2062
01:56:38,872 --> 01:56:40,584
Now, note your name, sign,

2063
01:56:40,609 --> 01:56:42,612
and remove your fancy dress.

2064
01:56:42,637 --> 01:56:44,150
And take your positions there.

2065
01:56:44,175 --> 01:56:45,591
Just open it.

2066
01:57:02,853 --> 01:57:04,103
Ashok Sir,

2067
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,794
We are lucky people.

2068
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:11,498
Being able to spend a night with such great
people is definitely a matter of luck.

2069
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:24,452
Dear ones,

2070
01:57:24,687 --> 01:57:28,078
I apologize for not being
able to stage the drama.

2071
01:57:29,334 --> 01:57:31,793
Weak people always fear others.

2072
01:57:32,312 --> 01:57:34,143
They even engage in bullying.

2073
01:57:34,504 --> 01:57:38,218
Being the victims of Fascism,
our drama crew and actors,

2074
01:57:38,243 --> 01:57:40,331
are behind the bars now.

2075
01:57:40,482 --> 01:57:43,565
Only a few of us escaped
their notice.

2076
01:57:49,901 --> 01:57:51,566
I'm Vilas Chakma.

2077
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,967
Your college mate Thulsa
Chakma's brother.

2078
01:57:55,836 --> 01:57:57,212
I'm a black.

2079
01:57:58,038 --> 01:58:00,330
I skin dead animals for my living.

2080
01:58:01,027 --> 01:58:03,444
I eat them to suppress my hunger.

2081
01:58:04,056 --> 01:58:07,181
I bury the stinking dead
bodies of animals.

2082
01:58:09,036 --> 01:58:11,370
I facilitate public hygiene.

2083
01:58:12,023 --> 01:58:14,814
Whipping scars, made by the
nobles just bulge out of my back.

2084
01:58:15,177 --> 01:58:16,947
Hey, stop.

2085
01:58:16,972 --> 01:58:18,390
Police has come, C'mon.

2086
01:58:18,415 --> 01:58:20,306
Stop, you stop there.

2087
01:58:20,331 --> 01:58:21,506
Stop there, I say.

2088
01:58:21,531 --> 01:58:24,698
My death will hunt you down
inside your palaces.

2089
01:58:25,712 --> 01:58:29,072
My death will consistently boil over
under your feet.

2090
01:58:30,955 --> 01:58:33,331
My name is Vilas Chakma.

2091
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:35,231
They are the people
who killed me.

2092
01:58:37,507 --> 01:58:38,631
Move.

2093
01:58:41,346 --> 01:58:42,596
Catch him.

2094
01:58:42,622 --> 01:58:44,372
Catch him, catch...

2095
01:58:50,786 --> 01:58:51,995
Catch him.

2096
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,890
Catch him.

2097
01:58:59,116 --> 01:59:00,531
Adharsh,

2098
01:59:03,471 --> 01:59:05,762
I'm Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

2099
01:59:07,168 --> 01:59:09,222
Their bullets can't pierce
into my chest.

2100
01:59:09,247 --> 01:59:11,009
My life is my message.

2101
01:59:11,034 --> 01:59:13,201
You're the Crown of
Thorns of religion.

2102
01:59:13,514 --> 01:59:15,340
You're the devil tooth
of Varna system.

2103
01:59:15,365 --> 01:59:18,969
You spit on the freedom we earned
through a lot of sacrifice, and ordeal.

2104
01:59:18,994 --> 01:59:22,050
Switch off the lights.
Stop your drama.

2105
01:59:22,075 --> 01:59:23,162
Leave me.

2106
01:59:23,187 --> 01:59:25,115
They're strange beings
with horns and hoofs,

2107
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:26,847
who savagely suppress freedom.

2108
01:59:26,872 --> 01:59:28,212
- Catch him.
- Leave me.

2109
01:59:28,237 --> 01:59:29,700
Leave me.

2110
01:59:29,725 --> 01:59:30,775
Catch him.

2111
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,684
They are the ones who
slaughter freedom.

2112
01:59:32,709 --> 01:59:34,397
Democracy will never forgive you.

2113
01:59:34,422 --> 01:59:35,754
You should not forgive them.

2114
01:59:40,681 --> 01:59:42,932
You'll surely get the
answer for it.

2115
01:59:46,775 --> 01:59:48,900
Leave me, I'll not do anything.

2116
01:59:51,866 --> 01:59:59,866
[Indistinct chattering]

2117
02:00:15,477 --> 02:00:16,810
I'm Gauri.

2118
02:00:18,421 --> 02:00:20,171
You can kill me.

2119
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:22,634
But, you can't defeat me.

2120
02:00:22,872 --> 02:00:26,586
I will expose the disgusting
truths to the world

2121
02:00:26,611 --> 02:00:28,611
through my writings.

2122
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,293
I will continue doing it.

2123
02:00:31,318 --> 02:00:35,159
But, everyone of you sitting
in front of me...

2124
02:00:36,712 --> 02:00:39,359
Your silence make me scared.

2125
02:00:40,042 --> 02:00:42,292
Your muteness makes me scared.

2126
02:00:43,529 --> 02:00:45,284
Not only me...

2127
02:00:45,309 --> 02:00:47,628
They will come in search
of every one of you;

2128
02:00:47,653 --> 02:00:49,278
to your kitchens,

2129
02:00:49,303 --> 02:00:51,137
to your privacy,

2130
02:00:51,716 --> 02:00:54,534
They will come, and
destabilize you.

2131
02:00:55,327 --> 02:00:57,077
Will you let that happen?

2132
02:00:57,736 --> 02:00:58,986
Tell me,

2133
02:00:59,782 --> 02:01:01,366
Will you let that happen?

2134
02:01:02,658 --> 02:01:04,033
Tell me.
