Did you bring it?-yes

122
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,227
Suppose our theft
is detected.

123
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,225
One who is caught
is a thief.

124
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,057
Conspirary between grandfather
& grandson!

125
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,229

00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,248
You may lock the door but I've
the master key.

132
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,754

You have advanced
diabeties-That too 320.

135
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,856
Uncle,it's a sin for you to even
touch sweets.

136
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,594
You're taking medicine
and sweet also.

137
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,433
And I'm scolded that I've eaten
all the sweets.

138
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,794
Dad,if you're not thinking about
you.Atleast think about us.

00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,937
Enough. All of you have ganged
against a sick old man.

140
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,606
At least ask me why
I got the sweet?

141
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:12,667
One wrong girl'll come &
nullify everything.

142
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,776
Why did you get the
sweets?- why?

143
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,106
Because Raj has said yes.

144
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,283
He has said yes.

145
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,785
For what?

146
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,116
For the marriage.

147
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,457
What're you doing? He is tired
let him take rest.

148
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,122
I'll talk to him & tell you

00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,489
Take the sweets and all
of you eat it,go....

150
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,137

To save yourself you've
put me in a soup.

153
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:45,971
And what sort of a
grandson you are?

154
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,972
To save the prestige
of their grandpa-

155
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,477
Grandsons sacrifice their
lives also.

156
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,306
And you are not agreeing
to get married also.

157

Until I get a nice handsome boy
like you,I won't get married.

176
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,058
And don't get married
miss Barucha.

177
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,122
What are you seeing.

178
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,564
Son Raj,I am doctor
Balraj speaking.

179
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:21,595
Yes doctor uncle.

180
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,399
Son you come to my
nursing home immidiately.

181
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,407
Your Grandpa is slightly
unwell.

182
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,611
Not slightly but
very unwell.

183
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,243
Yes Yes,he is very ill.

184
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,085
But he was alright in
the morning.

185
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,245
In this age one can get unwell
at any time.

186
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,255
Okay I'm coming.

187
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,254
He is coming.

188
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,936
Mother was there any
phone from doctor uncle!

189
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,438
He was here only.

190
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,438
He did the routine
check up of Grandpa!

191
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,636
And Then both of them
went for a walk.

192
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,773
But why are you asking?

193
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,280
Nothing mother. Okay, Bye.

194
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,615
Act in such a way that
it should look real.

195
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,285
You don't worry Kailash

196
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,454
You know that I used to come
1st in college in acting.

197
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,659
Grandpa,Raj has come,
lie down,lie down.

198
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,297
After giving you 2
Injections also!

199
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,130
Your pulse is not becoming
normal

200
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,339
What is your worry after all?

201
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,134
You still have 1 years life.

202
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,308
In 1 year all the wishes of a man
can be fulfilled.

203
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,343
What's that? You tell me I'll
fulfill his wish.

204
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,144
I've only one wish.

205
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:47,482
To see the face of my great grand
son before,I die.

206
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:54,159
But Raj doesn't love his grandpa
but he loves his freedom.

207
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,826
Open your eyes kailash
Raj has come

208
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,337
where are you,Raj?

209
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,005
I am here,Grandpa

210
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,835
With a suit on,You're lying on
the hospital bed.

211
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,172
I had to lie in emergency-

212
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,349
And You had to act
also in emergemcy

213
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,343
Doctor uncle you also joined hands.

214
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,019
What could I do? Your grandpa made
me to do all this.

215
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,021
Grandpa,why are you doing
all these things?

216
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,199
You know how valuable you
are to me!

217
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:29,863
I'm valuable,isn't it?

218
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,067
Then fulfil my wish.

219
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,871
Tell me when'll you come to see
the girl? come on tell me!

220
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:36,699
Whenever you say.

221
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,719
Priya,it seems they've come.

222
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,056
Come come Mr. Malhotra.

223
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,228
Greetings Mr. Kapoor.

224
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,899
Mr. Kapoor,he's my
grandson Raj.

225
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,429
May you live long.

226
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,297
He is the same person who I had
met in Suman's marriage.

227
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,908
I understood the situation,when
I saw you both there.

228
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,407
That's why we've asked
for this alliance.

229
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,246
I've already liked
your daughter.

230
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,415
We wanted Raj to see
her today.

231
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,591
Come daughter,come.

232
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,265
Greetings

233
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,104
God bless you,sit down!

234
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,612
How do you like her!

235
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,284
Grandpa,don't you find
her age a little more.

236
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,958
What are you talking
I've
seen her horoscope.

237
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,622
Her age is perfect.

238
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,033
It seems grandpa has seen the
horoscpe without glasses.

239
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,800
Her cheeks are so fat

240
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,305
That is the symbol
of rich people.

241
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,507
See her beautiful smile
How beautiful!!

242
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,978
The girl next to her
looks better.

243
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,653
She is the mother
of a child.

244
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,989
This girl looks like the
mother of 4 children.

245
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,929
What are you talking? She doesn't
look like that at all.

246
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,829
Son if you wish to ask
her anyting then go ahead.

247
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,834
Yes,Yes,if you want
you ask her.

248
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,348
Me! I have studied upto
7th standard-

249
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,015
But she is a double
graduate.

250
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,353
She is an expert in
domestic chores-

251
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,523
All these savories & sweets are
prepared by her.

252
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,189
That means she doesn't
know anything.

253
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,024
She knows all these
what else do you want!

254
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,532
Why is he asking these
questions to me?

255
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,031
He is still looking at you

256
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,528
Be ready. He'll ask
one more question..

257
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,365
What are your hobbies?

258
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,211
These are all her hobbies.

259
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,375
she always praises others.

260
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,042
She herself is a gold medalist
in ''KABBADI''

261
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,720
IN KABBADI!

262
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,985
Now child I also want
to ask you something.

263
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,722
Tell me what's most important to
keep the family happy?

264
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,392
It is love

265
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,734
Let the number of members
be more or less

266
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,730
But if eveyone loves each other
then the household becomes heaven.

267
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,410
Very good. What noble
thoughts!

268
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,405
Why bother about her
noble thoughts?

269
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,077
Ask her noble thought

270
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,412
Why do you want to know the noble
thoughts of her sister-in-law?

271
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,578
Sister-in-law?'' - Yes

272
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,422
Don't cry child. Madam your
son was crying?

273
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,760
Come,Come,my son.

274
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,768
Congratulations Mr. Kapoor
Raj has liked the girl.

275
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,772
From our side the alliance
is confirmed.

276
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:35,435
Now you fix the marriage date
-Sure,have sweets

277
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,529
Doctor Uncle,There's no differnce
between love & photograph

278
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,203
How's it?

279
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,372
Both are developed in Darkness!

280
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:44,374
Shameless fellow!

281
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,537
Hey! look at Raj's photograph!
Who had taken it?

282
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,871
Look....Look at this!

283
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,548
Mother,I had taken this photo!

284
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,209
Raj was unaware,when I took
this photograph!

285
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,385
I feel you both have liked
Switzerland very much!

286
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,552
If that's true,why don't you & Raj
settle there for few years!

287
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,722
Absolutely no,they both are
not going anywhere!

288
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,225
Till now,I was worrying for son
after sending him abroad!

289
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,055
Now,even Daughter-in-law
no way!

290
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:07,230
When I sent you to Oxford
for Higher Studies!

291
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,560
You cried mad!

292
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:11,765
You too father!

293
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,237
Grandpa,You could've told me!

294
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,566
...I would've talked with foreign Minister
and opened a Oxford's Branch we!

295
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,243
You donkey! You were not even
born at that time!

296
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,412
This is our country's
ill fortune!

297
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,094
Okay!......one second!

298
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,110
I'll call you later,okay!

299
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,119
Whose phone was it,that you had
to move away from me!

300
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,125
Come on tell. what's
the matter?

301
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,966
You're correct!

302
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,963
First,I thought I'll hide
this from you!

303
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:22,973
..But these things never
remain secret!

304
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,639
If you come to know...

305
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,817
...That there's someone else to share
my love with you!

306
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,582
What will you do then?

307
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,652
I'll kill myself!

308
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,392
Raj,do you love anyone else?

309
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,659
I haven't done it,I think
I'll start now...

310
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:48,661

00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,115
All this is the Magic of
the daughter-in-law

349
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,279
Grandpa,when talks were on for
my marriage in this family!

350
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,719
I was scared!
-why?

351
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,787
I had once seen your photograph
in the Newspaper!

352
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,790
I thought,one who had such
menacing Monstache!

353
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,633
He'll definitely be strict and
will be like Hitler!

354
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,469
I've to be scared & put
the veil!

355
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,139
But after coming here,I came to
know that you're very Modern!

356
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,973
Now,I feel that you're not Raj
but my grandfather!

357
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,648
Madam,this time,we had a
great crop this reason!

358
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,647
Each branch bearing
100's of Mangoes!

359
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,819
Hey! were you plucking mangoes
or counting it?

360
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,492
Hey! Stop this fight and carry
on with your work!

361
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,654
This will go to Sharma's,keep
this in that basket!

362
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,663
And sister-in-law,this is
for kumar's!-Please give!

363
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:34,693
Put into that basket!

364
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:35,227
Madam,please take this!

365
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:40,664
Oh! My child,how many times I had
warned you not to lift heavy articles?

366
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,506
Take away those unripe mangoes!

367
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,010
Where did you go early
in the morning?

368
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,178
I went out for shopping!

369
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:48,674
What for?

370
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:49,842
For Maharana Pratap!

371
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,175
....I mean for the photo
of Maharana Pratap!

372
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:52,678
Why?

373
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:58,177
Because if a six months pregnant woman
whatever she watches more!

374
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,380
..The child will imbibe
those qualities!

375
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:07,186
If we keep this photograph
in Priya's bed room!

376
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,367
Then the coming child will also be
courageous like Maharana Pratap!

377
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,035
Have you gone mad?

378
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,696
If he becomes like RanaPratap!

379
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,200
...He'll be fighting with a sword
all his life in Jungles!

380
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,469
We must make the child a
great cricketer only

381
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,706
What will he do becoming
a circketer!

382
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,713
Unnecessarily he will get trapped
into match fixing!

383
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,716
Our child should become a
great leader!

384
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,054
...One who'll march this
nation towards progress!

385
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,049
So,In the bedroom of Priya...

386
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,719
What happened?....
Have you slept?

387
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,393
...I am thinking about which leader's
photograph should I hang there?

388
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,232
Can this humble man suggest
a thing?

389
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:42,899
Come on tell?

390
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,734
It can solve the problem of
all the three!

391
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,737
Keep some film Actor's
photograph in her room!

392
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:52,231
He can do,Leader's role cricketer's
Role,& even Rana Pratap's Role!

393
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,908
How good had it been
if you were quiet?

394
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,414
Leader's photograph-
Leader's photograph!

395
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,252
Why are you unnecessarly
fighting anmong yourselves?

396
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:10,751
Yes,my child,come on tell!

397
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,597
Why are you getting tensed
up for me?

398
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,105
I've already hanged the photograph
which I like the most!

399
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:27,268
what?

400
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:15,714
Oh!

401
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:37,407
Catch it!

402
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,571
Oh! I've broken my back!

403
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,081
What's this Bansi?

404
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:48,915
How can it be out,Grandpa!
this was a six!

405
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,354
Out means ...out!

406
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:51,583
What's this?

407
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,414
Mother,Grandfather's cheating!

408
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,928
My dear,It's our family Rule,one who
crosses beyond the bundary is out!

You go and bat,I'll do

Anyhow,you'll be out at the first ball

414
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,937
I've seen many who had
dared to bowl me out!

415
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,442
How fast you're bowling?

416
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,779
Before I could lift my bat the ball
whizzed part me,I am not out!

417
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:25,785
Hey! come on give him out!

420
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,629
What an umpire you are?
Father's certainly out!

421
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,129
Hey! You're not my friend!
you're a Traitor...Traitor!

422
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,971
What did we fix
earlier between us?

423
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,640
What could I do? when all of them
joined together,I had to give out!

424
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,309
What do you mean by saying
that you had to give out?

425
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,808
Fixing matches even in family!

426
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,978
I'll telephone and inform
sports minister! Right now!

427
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,483
Let it go my friend,
I'll not bat!

428
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,479
Now,its my chance to bat!

429
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,084
Okay....Okay...give me the ball!

430
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,647
Welcome...Welcome to bat!

431
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,364
Don't know to play cricket,still
wanting to keep Tendulkar's photo!

432
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,996
Watch,how I am going to
hit a six next ball?

433
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:14,837
Hit a six!?!

434
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,690
Daughter-in-law!

435
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,717
Not able to understand
anything!

436
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,556
It's already 2 hours,why doesn't
anyone tell me anything?

437
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,391
This Balraj also went inside,and
still hasn't come out!

438
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:25,571
What happened,uncle?

439
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:27,573
Everything's alright
isn't it?

440
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:34,744
She had miscarriage! The still born
died in the womb only!

441
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,413
,.....And priya!
-She is alright

442
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,588
.....Out of Danger!

443
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,421
God's great! Thanks!

444
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,421
...That our daughter-in-law
is safe!

445
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:49,591
Can me meet priya now?

446
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,597
It isn't good to disturb her
for 7-8 hours!

447
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,109
I feel,we all go home!

448
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,271
Since the accident no body's
peacefull!

449
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,944
You all go home I'll
stay here only.

450
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,278
No,Aunty! you go home,we
both will stay here!

451
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,114
Mother,I'll stay here!

452
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,117
But,son!

453
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,618
As soon as priya gets consious
I'll give you a call!

454
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,454
Come on.....Come.....come....Come!

455
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,963
A mother losing her child is
a great Disaster!

456
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,529

Come Raj! come....Sit down!

459
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,208
Son!

460
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,550
In the accident priya's womb got
ruptured and became sceptic!

461
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:11,070
Because of which,priya can never
become a mother in future!

462
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:20,279
Even the Modern Technology can't
be of any help to her!

463
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,919
Son,you've to keep this as a secret
form your family!

464
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,426
If your Grandfahter comes to
know about this!

465
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:40,092
He already had two Heart attacks
He'll not be able to bear a third one!

466
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,276
But can I tell this to priya...

467
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,995
..That we'll keep away the
tears from us!

468
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:48,503
Shall we go?

469
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:03,849
Children have come!

470
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,523
I don't want any cries
& Cadoleaves!

471
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,692
Everyone will behave as if
nothing has happened?

472
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,027
Undersatood!?!
-Yes!

473
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,353
Go...Go back to your
normal work!

474
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,694
Welcome...Welcome my children!

475
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,197
What a long life my daughter-in-law
has been blessed with?

476
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,528
Think of her, & she's here!

477
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:21,367
Long live my child!

478
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:26,370
Watch out in a year owr house
will reverberate with a child's cries!

479
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,888
Be happy with family
and kids!

480
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,565
Enough!....No....
priya...no...

481
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,895
No...My child! please
don't cry!

482
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:57,100
Why this sorrow for a still born?
Cool on down!

483
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,072
Oh! My child miscarriage is
an ordinary matter!

484
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:05,578
My friend too had a miscarriage
But now she's mother to 4 kids!

485
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,579
What? In this time of family
plannings 4 children?

486
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,580
Pappu,register a complaint aganst
her friend with the police!

487
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,588
Why police,I can now call family planning
Minister and put her in jail

488
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,260
Hey! Her husband himself is
the family planning minister!

489
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,090
You can't touch him!
Call the Prime Minister!

490
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:21,760
Where will he be?

491
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,768
Why are you laughing? I can call
even Bill Clinton

492
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,939
What's happening here? why are you
talking own problems? busy with your

00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,936
No body's concerned about daughter-in-law

00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,111
Yes my child,go

What happened?

502
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,150
Did you see the eyes of
your family members?

503
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,323
There's an expectation
in every eye!

504
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,826
...That in the near future,I'll present
them with a heir to this family!

505
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,161
One day they'll definitely come
to know that...

506
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,996
We have deceived them! What will
happen at that time?

507
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,336
You don't worry about that
I've a plan...

508
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:42,334
Come on tell,how do you feel
if we adopt a child?

509
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:48,678
Look! Father always tells me to
go abroad to look after business!

510
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,218
If you agree,we'll go abroad
for a year or two!

511
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,188
We'll adopt a child there!
Okay?

512
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,525
And,I'll explain everything
to Doctor uncle!

513
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,031
We've been left with no choice!

514
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,220
Grandpa!

515
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:28,716
Come...my child...come!

516
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,391
My respects to you grandpa!

517
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:31,060
Bless you my child!

518
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,224
Come sit,my child!

519
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:35,894
Were you crying?

520
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,402
No!...these are tears of
happiness,my child!

521
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,405
While reading the newspaper
I fell asleep!

522
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,741
...And in that sleep I had a
very nice dream!

523
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,076
...That I've become
great grandfather!

524
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,904
A small child was playing
in my lap!

525
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:58,753
...And was laughing!
Exactly like Raj!

526
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,584
Similar eyes...similar smile!

527
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,927
As I bent my head to
fondle the child!

528
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,023
..that rogue caught
my monstache!

529
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,434
In that happiness tears
rolled out of my eyes!

530
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:16,271
Do you know my child,the morning
dreams will always come ture!

531
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:24,439
I'll give myself entirely to
my husnabd only!

532
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,629
Look will you give if I
ask you anything today?

533
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,127
Why do you ask?
Everything is yours!

534
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,299
If I wish to give it to some one
else which is mine!

535
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,142
Give it what's
the problem in it?

536
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,885
You marry again!

537
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:08,820
What?!!

538
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:15,658
Today,grandfather dreamt of a Raj
a replica of you! Playing in his lap!

539
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,991
He doesn't want anyone,he wants
your progeny only!

540
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:20,666
Now you only tell!

541
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,499
How can we play on their sentiments
by calling an adopted as your son!

542
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,012
I am at the disadvantage!
I can't become a mother!Raj

543
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,847
But you can become a
father,isn't it?

544
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,345
Agree to it. Raj.please!

545
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,856
The accident which you had,
If it had happened to me!

546
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,023
Would you've married again?

547
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,695
Look!

548
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,577
Raj. I want to meet
you immediately!

549
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:36,746
What's the matter?

550
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,577
I can't tell it on phone!

551
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,450
Do one thing come to lndia Gate
I'll also come there!

552
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,414
Alright,I'll come!

553
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:56,424
Read this news!

554
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:07,098
How lucky that woman would've been
who was like me,but now has a child!

555
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,278
The only differece is that the womb
was of a different woman!

556
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:10,609
You mean test tube Baby?!

557
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,440
No,our family is so famous that this
test tube matter will never be a a secret!

558
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:17,612
That's means you
want me to.....

559
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:22,622
Yes Raj,if we get a girl who
could give birth to our child!

560
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,788
Look,If I wanted to beget a child
from some other woman!

561
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,299
Why would I have refused
for the marriage?

562
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,634
Why would I have talked about
adopting a child?

563
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,633
Because,I love you so much!

564
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,632
..And I don't want to share
it with anyone

565
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,638
Raj! We'll get difficulties
freely!

566
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:43,140
For your child I am ready to share
your love with other woman also!

567
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:53,311
Priya,even if I accept,where would
we get such a woman?

568
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,656
If It's written in my fate
to become a mother!

569
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,326
We'll definitely find a woman!

570
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,840
The contract which you entered
with your  friend...

571
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,009
Will she help me?

572
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,845
..This is your Air Ticket
to Mumbai

573
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,346
What happened? You seem to
be very disturbed!

574
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,185
Nothing Ms.Bharucha! -
Please sit down! A small problem!

575
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,350
You tell me your problem,I'll
solve it,just like that!

576
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,526
Ms.Bharucha,this problem can't be
solved just like that

577
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,365
It'll take minimum 9 months!

578
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:37,691
What?
-yes!

579
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,862
One of my friend needs
a girl

580
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,537
Is it? Is he handsome
like you?

581
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,876
Yes he's handsome,Rich and ready
to give everything!

582
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,441
...A house, a car,everything! But,all he
needs is just a child!

583
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:58,049
First let them get marry,I'll have
a cricket team ready

584
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,755
Problem is that he's
already married!

585
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,723
...And he doesn't want
a second marriage!

586
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:03,592

Any problem?

589
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,332
You've mistaken me!Am I
so cheap?

590
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,733
No...No...Ms. Bharucha
You've mistaken me!

591
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,632
I am not that sort of a guy I was just
discussing about my friends problem
that's all!

592
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:21,106
Let your friend and his
problem go to hell!

593
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:25,414
Understood ?

594
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,297
Till now our relationship was
restricted to freindship!

595
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,296
But from today,it has entered
even in our business!

Raj! Mrs. Kapoor is asking about your
opinion in the product!

605
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,456
Yes! sir,I was asking,which product
should be launched first?

606
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,322
Actually,I was thinking
something else!

607
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,224
Can we discuss it in
next meeting?

608
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:29,666
Where do you want to go?

00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:30,168

Is your house here? I don't
find anything here!

614
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,458
Why do you need a house?

615
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:55,831

The shop on the other side of the
street,that big shop

853
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:19,389
What did he say?

854
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,395
He misbehaved and called me cheap!
Now..even you too!

855
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:29,730
I had forgotten that you've come
from a different world!

856
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,235
I didn't come,you brought
me here!

857
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,736

I'll not come there!

862
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:00,267
What happened?

863
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,763

868
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:35,135

879
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,830
I had come here decided that...

01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,504
...I'll buy your entire shop!

881
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,836
But,your shop doesn't have
anything like that!

882
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,007
Which will look beautiful
on her!

883
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:18,175
And you like anything?

884
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:20,671

other big shop?! come.

01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,852
You're too hot! Have
this cold drunk!

886
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,182
Oldy,don't do anything
like this next time!

887
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:41,869
What are you doing?

888

This is small bottle!

890
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:50,707
This small bottle will make
a big hole in the liver!

891
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:51,541
Give it to me!

892
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:57,208

Hey! what are you doing?Are you

895
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,274
How am I going to repay

896
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:58,770
Oh! come,leave it!

897
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,275

the sorrow of a woman!

924
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,587
Only a woman can understand
a woman's sorrows!

925
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:17,408
Come Madhu

926
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,394

This time also we'll have
to stay seperately

01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,381
Because office is very close
to Banglow!

935
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:57,953
And there is plenty of work in
the office this time

936
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,553

01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:36,424
Seeing the snow

946
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:45,934

954
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:57,440

If you like it then you stay here
I'll go to your room

I'll bring my things

965

Madhu liked this room,so I gave it
to her I'll stay in the guest room

966
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:36,717
That's right

971
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:48,761
Same way I'll take you to
the guest room

972
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,674
This is my room,not yours
that's your room

973
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:08,543
I know it,but my wife

975

And all roads'll
be closed

980
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,707

You do one thing

982
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:35,392

You bought things for the
whole year,Oh!

984
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,670
Where is Priya,still
shopping?

985
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,741
No,she went away home

986
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,380
What! doesn't she know there is going
to be snow storm here

987
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:58,150
She knows

988
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:00,483
She had to buy certain things from
near the house

989
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,655
That's why she went away,by now
she must've reached home

990
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:05,155
Keep the trolly,come
I'll do it!

991
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:07,987

993
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:56,376

Take it that way

1002
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,062
But if you two are
not alone

1003
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:26,069
How'll we get rid of
our lonliness

1004
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:06,443
I am sorry,I had mixed a little
Vodka in coca cola

01:38:08,115 --> 01:38:10,242
Alright don't come!

1016

Don't bring the

01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:30,099
Wish you a long happy life
don't lift heavy things

1025
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:30,766
Yes yes

1026
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:34,274
And the Charan that I had given you
tie it on the wrist

1027
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:35,601
Tie it on your hand

1028
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:47,946
And take care of
daughter-in-law

1029
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,958
Congratulations,kept
the phone down

1030
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:18,147
What's this? It has
sacred flowers in it

1031
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:20,153
Mother-in-law has given me for
the protection of the child

1032
01:39:23,691 --> 01:39:25,318
Always keep it on your hand

1033
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:27,319
It'll protect the child

1034
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:18,944
See it's months,there is no
bulge on the stomach

1035
01:44:23,156 --> 01:44:26,284
It won't come in 3 months only
after 5 months it'll show

1036
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:30,293
When I was expecting last time
I was also worried like you

1037
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:31,957
Mother-in-law had told me

1038
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:36,963
Mother-in-law! she's a
dangerous creature!

1039
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:40,306
No,my mother-in-law
is not like that

1040
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:42,975
She is very nice,she loves
me a lot

1041
01:44:43,677 --> 01:44:44,803
And grandpa of Raj...

1042
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,806
He doesn't consider me as daughter-in-law
I am the grand daughter to him

1043
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,645
Who else is there
in your family?

1044
01:44:50,017 --> 01:44:52,144
Grandpa's friend,
Doctor Uncle!

1045
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:55,977
Uncle,Auntie &
one Pappu brother

1046
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:57,983
He has very high contacts

1047
01:44:58,358 --> 01:44:59,985
If any phone goes out of
order in the house

1048
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,327
He won't phone the mechanic

1049
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:03,322
He'll phone the telecome
minister directly!

1050
01:45:05,532 --> 01:45:09,332
And his winking habit puts every
new person in a quandry

1051
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:11,997
Your inlaws place would be very
interesting,isn't it?

1052
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:15,007
Day must be passing off
very quickly

1053
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:18,845
It was like that earlier,but
since that happened with me

1054
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:24,847
But those days'll
return again

1055
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:31,687
Congratulations Raj!

1056
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:34,027
Our company has crossed the sales
of 10 millions

1057
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:37,526
It's nothing,It'll cross more than
10 millions,100 millions

1058
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:40,700
Hello sister-in-law,how
are you?

1059
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:41,367
I am fine

1060
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:43,036
She's my friend,Madhu

1061
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:46,869
And he is Ajay,friend of Raj
and a businessman

1062
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:09,895
Come Madhu

1063
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:16,736
Yes Madhu,you are our VIP

1064
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:36,414
Hey son,come here!

1065
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:53,265
Raj,Vicky brother
has come

1066
01:46:58,145 --> 01:46:59,271
Brother,sister-in-law
hasn't come

1067
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:01,113
Day after tomorrow,my son's head
shaving ceremony is there,isn't it?

1068
01:47:01,481 --> 01:47:03,608
That's why she is busy there
but I've come,isn't it?

1069
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:05,952
And I've come to remind
you people

1070
01:47:06,153 --> 01:47:08,621
That both of you must come for the
ceremony day after tomorrow

1071
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:14,961
I was thinking for a long time
as to where I had seen you

1072
01:47:16,163 --> 01:47:16,629
Wonderful

1073
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:18,627
What a great change
has come over

1074
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:21,793
After seeing you nobody can say
that you're a prostitute

1075
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:28,804
Who told you?

1076
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:31,636
There is no secret
between me & Raj

1077
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:41,320
I also appreciate good things

1078
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:44,490
If the commodity is good
I don't bother about money

1079
01:47:46,359 --> 01:47:48,156
As soon as you're free
from Raj,come over!

1080
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:52,491
What ever Raj is paying you
I'll give you double than that

1081
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,027
Why did you come away
from the party?

1082
01:48:25,398 --> 01:48:27,525
I don't want to stay here
I'm going back

1083
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:30,699
What happened? did any one
say something?

1084
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:33,205
All rich people like you
are alike

1085
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:35,534
You play so many games
for your selfish ends

1086
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:38,203
First you gave me so much respect
elevated me to the sky

1087
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:41,039
And with one jerk you pulled me
back to earth

1088
01:48:42,415 --> 01:48:43,541
You wanted only a child
isn't it?

1089
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:46,215
That I would have produced on
the road also

1090
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:48,880
What was the need to mature me
for your society

1091
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:52,054
When you had to tell your friends
that I'm a prostitute

1092
01:48:57,597 --> 01:49:00,896
I never felt so cheap,when I was
in the proffession

1093
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:02,565
The way I am feeling
today

1094
01:49:03,603 --> 01:49:04,570
Did Ajay say anything
to you?

1095
01:49:08,275 --> 01:49:09,401
Madhu,I haven't said anything
to anybody

1096
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:17,250
Ay Madhu,where are
you going?

1097
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:20,419
I am going back,he told
his friend that I....

1098
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:26,922
That I am pregnant
Ican't dance

1099
01:49:28,628 --> 01:49:32,257
Madhu Raj & I are your friends
your well wishers

1100
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,599
We'll never say anything
that'll hurt you

1101
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,097
You want to dance,come..

1102
01:49:39,472 --> 01:49:41,269
I don't want to dance

1103
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:57,449
A person who thinks someone
as his own

1104
01:49:57,991 --> 01:49:59,788
He get's hurt by trifles

1105
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:05,457
Priya,I didn't tell you one thing
about Madhu

1106
01:50:05,999 --> 01:50:08,467
I know,I have heard
everything

1107
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:16,634
You did the right thing by
not telling me this earlier

1108
01:50:17,677 --> 01:50:21,807
May be after knowing the truth
I might not have accepted Madhu

1109
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:23,975
But today,I can say

1110
01:50:24,684 --> 01:50:26,311
To give birth to our child

1111
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,487
There couldn't have been a
better girl than Madhu

1112
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:30,989
Isn't it?

1113
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:49,166
How is Madhu?

1114
01:50:51,211 --> 01:50:54,180
I'm just coming from her room
she's still angry

1115
01:50:55,048 --> 01:50:57,175
If we both go for the head shaving
ceremoney without her

1116
01:50:57,717 --> 01:50:58,843
Then she'll feel very bad

1117
01:51:00,053 --> 01:51:00,849
Then we'll also not go

1118
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:03,519
No..No..Vicky brother will be offended

1119
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:08,020
We'll do onething,I'll go for the
function,you stay here

1120
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:11,189
I'll give the excuse that you couldn't
come because of business compulsions

1121
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:16,524
Okay,pack your things,I'll drop
you at the station,come

1122
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:31,213
Drink this juice

1123
01:51:43,763 --> 01:51:46,231
Cigarette is healthy to your
and child's health

1124
01:51:49,769 --> 01:51:51,896
Madhu I know you're upset

1125
01:51:53,106 --> 01:51:54,573
But,when you came to
the Bombay confrence

1126
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:58,407
The way you had dressed up
the way you had behaved that...

1127
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,406
Ajay was also present there

1128
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:06,078
When I didn't tell this to
my wife Priya

1129
01:52:07,454 --> 01:52:08,580
Then why would I tell
it to Ajay?

1130
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:13,926
Even then if you feel I've
made a mistake

1131
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:24,937
Smoke the cigarette

1132
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:17,823
You were bathing?

1133
01:53:19,192 --> 01:53:21,160
Raj is not at home,he has
gone to the office

1134
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:22,658
Yes I know Raj has gone
to the office

1135
01:53:22,862 --> 01:53:24,159
And,he'll come back late

1136
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:26,999
And Priya is also not at home
she has gone to her cousin

1137
01:53:27,534 --> 01:53:28,330
That's why I've come!

1138
01:53:32,705 --> 01:53:34,172
From the time,I saw you at
the party

1139
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:36,342
I couldn't control myself

1140
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:38,670
That's why I came here at the
very 1st opportunity

1141
01:53:40,046 --> 01:53:43,174
I've enjoyed with
every type of Girl

1142
01:53:44,217 --> 01:53:47,846
But,the attraction that you have
nobody else has it

1143
01:53:48,388 --> 01:53:49,514
You please go away
from here

1144
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:52,354
Yes,I have understood

1145
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:55,687
You're in contract with Raj that's
why you're in tension

1146
01:53:56,729 --> 01:53:58,026
There is no problem between
me and him

1147
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:02,030
He is not only my business partner
but my childhood friend also

1148
01:54:03,236 --> 01:54:04,533
He'll have no objection

1149
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:15,710
You cheap prostitute
you slapped me!

1150
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:36,728
Come on,get up...get up
over here..

1151
01:54:42,942 --> 01:54:44,068
You're pretending to be
very decent,isn't it?

1152
01:54:44,611 --> 01:54:45,908
I'll smash your decency

1153
01:55:29,322 --> 01:55:31,620
Raj I had thought,that....

1154
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:33,284
What did you think?

1155
01:55:33,993 --> 01:55:35,790
That,you'll rape her?
you'll rape her?

1156
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:38,130
Raj,what are you doing you'll rape
her?listen to me

1157
01:55:38,831 --> 01:55:39,627
Raj listen to me

1158
01:55:39,832 --> 01:55:40,628
You'll rape her

1159
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:44,629
Raj,listen to me

1160
01:55:52,345 --> 01:55:55,803
Raj,what are you doing for a cheap
prostitute you're beating me

1161
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:00,812
Does she look a cheap
prostitute to you?

1162
01:56:02,522 --> 01:56:03,318
I don't find her that way

1163
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:10,318
How did she look like
that to you....?

1164
01:56:12,865 --> 01:56:15,993
Raj for such a girl you're beating
your childhood friend

1165
01:56:21,374 --> 01:56:23,842
Childhood friend!

1166
01:56:26,045 --> 01:56:30,846
Even if you were my brother
I would have killed you

1167
01:56:34,887 --> 01:56:38,846
Raj for her you're endangering
partnership worth 500 crores

1168
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,357
Why 500 crores for her

1169
01:56:43,396 --> 01:56:45,694
For her,I'll forsake the entire
wealth of the world

1170
01:56:48,568 --> 01:56:53,028
Do you know,why? because she
is priceless for me

1171
01:56:54,907 --> 01:56:58,536
You're my friend,isn't it? that's
why you leave from here

1172
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:01,547
Otherwise I'll kill
you,understod

1173
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:03,711
Go..go..

1174
01:57:33,946 --> 01:57:34,742
I'll bring medicines

1175
01:58:09,315 --> 01:58:11,613
If you need anything
call me

1176
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:13,481
Madhu,take this

1177
02:07:24,703 --> 02:07:25,499
What were you thinking?

1178
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:29,337
I was remembering my
childhood

1179
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,347
When I was a kid

1180
02:07:36,215 --> 02:07:38,342
My mother always used to
tell me a story

1181
02:07:39,885 --> 02:07:40,852
That,there was a poor girl

1182
02:07:42,721 --> 02:07:45,189
Oneday a prince came to her
on a white horse

1183
02:07:46,892 --> 02:07:48,519
And took away his bride

1184
02:07:50,396 --> 02:07:52,193
And then,all her dreams
came true

1185
02:07:54,233 --> 02:07:57,202
Even I used to see this same
dream all the time

1186
02:08:02,241 --> 02:08:03,208
When I grew

1187
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:08,870
Instead of white horses many
white cars came

1188
02:08:10,416 --> 02:08:12,384
Many princess got down
from them

1189
02:08:15,754 --> 02:08:17,722
But nobody came to
take me with him

1190
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:20,888
All came to purchase me

1191
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:25,727
Then I realized

1192
02:08:27,266 --> 02:08:30,064
That it was a fairy tale for
children in their childhood

1193
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:33,237
It doesn't happen like that
in reality

1194
02:08:44,616 --> 02:08:47,585
Raj & Priya will be shocked
to see us

1195
02:08:47,786 --> 02:08:50,254
Ay Chotu,take down the
luggage quickly

1196
02:08:50,456 --> 02:08:51,582
How can I take
down so much?

1197
02:08:52,458 --> 02:08:52,924
Come with me

1198
02:08:59,798 --> 02:09:01,095
Priya,grandpa has come with
the entire family

1199
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:01,595
What?

1200
02:09:02,301 --> 02:09:03,268
Is that your family?

1201
02:09:05,304 --> 02:09:07,272
Priya,it'll be a catastrophy,they think
that you're pregnant

1202
02:09:08,974 --> 02:09:09,440
One second

1203
02:09:11,977 --> 02:09:13,274
No no,it'll be too big!

1204
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:14,775
This....

1205
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:16,607
Yes,this is alright

1206
02:09:16,815 --> 02:09:17,782
Wear this charma also

1207
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:18,950
But there are sacred
flowers in it...

1208
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:22,609
Yes yes,I know,give her the flowers
and you wear the charm

1209
02:09:22,821 --> 02:09:23,116
Yes

1210
02:09:23,655 --> 02:09:25,452
Daughter-in-law,we have
come

1211
02:09:26,325 --> 02:09:28,452
Where are you,you'll be
overwhelmed

1212
02:09:30,829 --> 02:09:32,956
Oh Grandpa,Mother

1213
02:09:35,834 --> 02:09:36,300
Grandpa

1214
02:09:36,835 --> 02:09:37,961
May you live long

1215
02:09:40,506 --> 02:09:41,973
Mother....
-we surprised you,isn't it?

1216
02:09:42,508 --> 02:09:43,805
God bless you,my son

1217
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:48,976
You came without
informing

1218
02:09:50,682 --> 02:09:55,142
We couldn't wait to see Priya,so
we have come-where is Priya?

1219
02:09:55,687 --> 02:09:56,312
She is tying the pillow

1220
02:09:56,855 --> 02:09:58,152
Tying the pillow!

1221
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:00,317
Tying the pillow! what did
you all hear?

1222
02:10:00,526 --> 02:10:01,322
What did you say?

1223
02:10:01,527 --> 02:10:02,323
She is changing her dress

1224
02:10:09,535 --> 02:10:11,162
Come my child,come....

1225
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:11,995
My child....

1226
02:10:12,204 --> 02:10:12,670
Blessings mother

1227
02:10:13,539 --> 02:10:16,167
God bless you,you have given us the
entire happiness of the world

1228
02:10:17,709 --> 02:10:20,837
No..no child don't bend
down,God bless you

1229
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,006
Let me stop the evil eye
falling on you

1230
02:10:23,215 --> 02:10:24,011
Oh! Grandpa...

1231
02:10:24,383 --> 02:10:25,008
How are you my child?

1232
02:10:25,217 --> 02:10:25,683
I am fine

1233
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,187
How are you,Pappu brother

1234
02:10:29,721 --> 02:10:30,517
Hai! Uncle

1235
02:10:30,722 --> 02:10:31,848
How are you Priya child?

1236
02:10:32,391 --> 02:10:37,021
Didn't I tell you that you'll
be pregnant within a year,isn't it?

1237
02:10:39,231 --> 02:10:42,689
What mother,why did you all
give us such a surprise?

1238
02:10:59,084 --> 02:11:00,051
What happened?
what happened?

1239
02:11:13,098 --> 02:11:14,565
She is the wife of my
friend,Madhu

1240
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:18,566
Her husband generally stays away
for business

1241
02:11:18,937 --> 02:11:21,405
There is no one else in the house
that's why she stays with us

1242
02:11:21,773 --> 02:11:22,569
I see....

1243
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:24,906
You did the correct
thing my child

1244
02:11:25,444 --> 02:11:27,241
At this time you shouldn't
live alone

1245
02:11:28,614 --> 02:11:29,410
Come...come here

1246
02:11:32,117 --> 02:11:32,583
Blessings....

1247
02:11:32,951 --> 02:11:33,918
Always be happy

1248
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:35,750
I'm Priya's mother-in-law

1249
02:11:36,121 --> 02:11:36,917
I know

1250
02:11:37,289 --> 02:11:39,086
Priya daily tells me
about you all

1251
02:11:39,958 --> 02:11:43,758
You are auntie,you are uncle
and you are Pappu brother

1252
02:11:44,963 --> 02:11:45,759
And you're grandpa

1253
02:11:46,632 --> 02:11:46,927
Blessings

1254
02:11:47,132 --> 02:11:49,259
Don't bend down
blessings

1255
02:11:49,468 --> 02:11:50,264
And you are the father

1256
02:11:51,803 --> 02:11:54,271
Grandpa won't you take away
the evil eye frome me?

1257
02:12:00,212 --> 02:12:04,478
Why not,may you live long
and married

1258
02:12:10,455 --> 02:12:13,288
It's not surprising why our
dark hero Mithun stays in Ooty

1259
02:12:13,659 --> 02:12:15,889
So that,he looks fair among
the people who stay there

1260
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:18,825
Grandfather....Biscuts

1261
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:25,028
Madhu my child,what is
your Husband's business?

1262
02:12:27,005 --> 02:12:27,334
He!....

1263
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:29,004
He is into Import & Export

1264
02:12:29,675 --> 02:12:32,701
Yes grandpa,that's why he is sometimes
in UK,Austrlia!....

1265
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:33,907
He's always out of station

1266
02:12:34,579 --> 02:12:35,136
I see...

1267
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:37,639
Whatever it may be business
will anyways go on

1268
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:40,280
But in such times,a husband should
necessarily be with his wife

1269
02:12:40,452 --> 02:12:41,885
Daughter-in-law,no problem

1270
02:12:42,754 --> 02:12:44,915
Like the way,we'll take
care of our Priya

1271
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:46,817
In the same way,we'll
take care of her too

1272
02:13:11,049 --> 02:13:13,847
After listening to this God Vishnu
started crying after becoming a child

1273
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,847
And after seeing that beautiful
face of him

1274
02:13:17,556 --> 02:13:21,356
Tears of affection & happiness rolled
out from mother Kausalia's eyes

1275
02:13:22,227 --> 02:13:25,526
They say,if the description of
God Rama's birth

1276
02:13:26,064 --> 02:13:27,691
Is heard by a pregnant woman

1277
02:13:28,233 --> 02:13:29,700
Even her child likes it

1278
02:13:30,402 --> 02:13:31,869
You just feel and watch

1279
02:13:33,071 --> 02:13:35,198
There definitely would be some
movement going on inside

1280
02:13:49,755 --> 02:13:53,555
Madhu child,why are you
standing there,come here & sit

1281
02:13:54,426 --> 02:13:56,894
Come....come...sit

1282
02:14:00,098 --> 02:14:03,898
Listen,at the time of
God Rama's birth

1283
02:14:04,436 --> 02:14:06,233
The condition of
his father Dashrath

1284
02:14:06,938 --> 02:14:10,567
Because,the amount of happiness which
the mother undergoes in delivering it's child

1285
02:14:10,942 --> 02:14:12,739
The father feels
twice of her

1286
02:14:16,782 --> 02:14:18,249
Child,what are
you thinking?

1287
02:14:20,452 --> 02:14:22,579
That your husband is not
with you,isn't it?

1288
02:14:24,623 --> 02:14:26,750
He definitely would be
helpless about this

1289
02:14:27,459 --> 02:14:31,418
But he always would be thinking
about you & your child

1290
02:14:32,464 --> 02:14:34,261
Poet Tulsidas said....

1291
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:47,441
Priya,my child
-yes mother

1292
02:14:48,313 --> 02:14:49,610
Child,this is that
spicy sweet

1293
02:14:50,148 --> 02:14:50,944
Do you remember?

1294
02:14:51,483 --> 02:14:52,950
I have brought it for you
from Delhi

1295
02:15:05,497 --> 02:15:06,122
Madhu come...

1296
02:15:08,667 --> 02:15:10,635
Mother has brought for me spicy
sweets from Delhi

1297
02:15:10,836 --> 02:15:12,963
You'll really be benefitted
if you eat it..eat.....

1298
02:15:19,845 --> 02:15:20,311
It's spicy,isn't it?

1299
02:15:21,179 --> 02:15:24,148
Last year,when I was expecting even
I found them very spicy

1300
02:15:24,349 --> 02:15:27,147
That's why mother forcibilly made
me eat,making me sit infront of her

1301
02:15:28,019 --> 02:15:28,485
Will you have one more?

1302
02:15:30,522 --> 02:15:32,149
Mother is coming,don't say
that I had it

1303
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:36,156
Yes mother

1304
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:40,031
Oh! you are here,I was searching
you in your room

1305
02:15:40,031 --> 02:15:41,328
I was sitting with
Grandpa

1306
02:15:42,868 --> 02:15:45,336
What's the matter,you
are crying?

1307
02:15:45,537 --> 02:15:50,998
No...I was watching a melodramatic
film,that's why

1308
02:15:51,543 --> 02:15:52,339
Come with me

1309
02:15:55,213 --> 02:15:56,680
Sit down,carefully....

1310
02:15:58,049 --> 02:16:00,517
Madhu child,these are
spicy sweets

1311
02:16:00,886 --> 02:16:04,014
After eating it,both the mother & the
child are benefitted a lot

1312
02:16:04,389 --> 02:16:05,185
Come on eat it....

1313
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:07,358
Mother,no I'll eat it later

1314
02:16:07,726 --> 02:16:10,854
No....not later,you'll have to eat it
before me,otherwise,you'll not

1315
02:16:11,062 --> 02:16:13,530
No...mother.-I know it's a little
spicy that's why

1316
02:16:13,732 --> 02:16:19,193
Come on,open your mouth
open...good-No...

1317
02:16:26,244 --> 02:16:29,543
Madhu,there's a lot of
swelling on your feet

1318
02:16:31,683 --> 02:16:34,481
I had told the Doctor about it
but he said,it's quite normal

1319
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:37,849
It definitely happens,but a
lot of swelling is not good

1320
02:16:38,657 --> 02:16:41,353
I'll apply oil on your feet
made of 7 herbs

1321
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:42,527
It reduces the swelling

1322
02:16:43,795 --> 02:16:44,318
Yes madam

1323
02:16:44,529 --> 02:16:45,962
Bring that oil made
of 7 herbs

1324
02:16:46,164 --> 02:16:46,596
I'll get it

1325
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:48,856
Keep it

1326
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:50,726
Show me my child

1327
02:16:50,936 --> 02:16:54,770
No..No mother,I'll not like
you touching my feet

1328
02:16:55,307 --> 02:16:56,740
But,I'll like it

1329
02:16:57,409 --> 02:16:58,603
Once,that I have adressed
you as my daughter

1330
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:00,502
I also mean it
from my heart

1331
02:17:00,946 --> 02:17:02,743
You are my daughter
isn't it?

1332
02:17:16,328 --> 02:17:18,091
Who all are there in
your family?

1333
02:17:20,432 --> 02:17:21,421
Mother,I have no one

1334
02:17:23,535 --> 02:17:24,433
There must be someone in
India,isn't it?

1335
02:17:28,573 --> 02:17:29,267
I have no one
in the world

1336
02:17:36,414 --> 02:17:41,374
Hereafter,don't ever say,that
I have no one in the world

1337
02:17:44,055 --> 02:17:45,784
From now,this entire
family is yours

1338
02:18:07,345 --> 02:18:08,812
Greetings Mr.Priest
how are you?

1339
02:18:09,581 --> 02:18:10,377
Yes one minute

1340
02:18:11,016 --> 02:18:12,176
Grandpa...it's Mr.Priest's
phone from Delhi

1341
02:18:12,851 --> 02:18:14,478
What's the number of
the facility Minister over here?

1342
02:18:16,721 --> 02:18:18,348
Yes Mr.Priest...greetings

1343
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:19,318
Whose phone is this?

1344
02:18:19,791 --> 02:18:21,156
What was he saying?-I don't know

1345
02:18:22,794 --> 02:18:23,954
Alright we'll do exactly
as you say

1346
02:18:24,529 --> 02:18:27,327
You make the arrangements
yes.. okay...

1347
02:18:28,033 --> 02:18:29,000
Grandpa, what
arragements?

1348
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:34,160
Raj, Mr.priest has chosen 18th as the
date for priya's lap filling ceremony.

1349
02:18:34,372 --> 02:18:34,838
Congratulations.

1350
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:36,837
We''ll go to Delhi tomorrow itself,
okay

1351
02:18:40,712 --> 02:18:43,681
Raj, how can we go
back to India?

1352
02:18:44,215 --> 02:18:45,512
Even Madhu has to be with us,
isn't it

1353
02:18:46,384 --> 02:18:50,184
Because,18th has been fixed as
priya's lap filling ceremony

1354
02:18:51,723 --> 02:18:55,181
You go along with Raj to the
office, call for a board meeting

1355
02:18:55,393 --> 02:18:56,519
And make everyone understand
-yes father

1356
02:18:57,395 --> 02:18:59,863
Grandpa,is it not possible,if
you call Mr.priest here itself?

1357
02:19:00,065 --> 02:19:01,362
And acomplish the ceremony
here itself.

1358
02:19:02,067 --> 02:19:02,362
Why?

1359
02:19:03,068 --> 02:19:04,695
Because, Priya's delivery date
is also of this month

1360
02:19:05,570 --> 02:19:07,367
And ...,the medical facilities
over here are also very good

1361
02:19:07,906 --> 02:19:09,373
What are you talking
about facilities?

1362
02:19:09,574 --> 02:19:12,372
I'll make one phone and get
all the facilities transferred to Delhi

1363
02:19:14,746 --> 02:19:16,873
There is no facility of a
minister itself over here

1364
02:19:17,082 --> 02:19:19,209
I see..., Bihar is a
better place than this

1365
02:19:20,418 --> 02:19:23,216
Raj my son. We''ll get all the
madecal facilities in Delhi

1366
02:19:23,421 --> 02:19:25,389
And such a ceremony is done
at that place

1367
02:19:25,757 --> 02:19:27,384
Where there are friends,
relatives etc.

1368
02:19:28,093 --> 02:19:30,391
Mother, you are right.
We''ll all go to lndia.

1369
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:35,396
Madhu, I had promised
your husband.

1370
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,726
That I'll take
care of you.

1371
02:19:37,102 --> 02:19:37,568
But,we are all going to India
for the lap filling ceremony

1372
02:19:38,103 --> 02:19:40,071
Because, your's of Priya's delivery
date,fall on the same day.

1373
02:19:42,941 --> 02:19:44,568
And I can never go
against Grandpa.

1374
02:19:44,776 --> 02:19:48,405
But, I'll do all your hospital
bookings etc

1375
02:19:48,613 --> 02:19:50,740
And whenever you get the
labour pain.you yourself go.

1376
02:19:52,283 --> 02:19:53,910
Have you gone out of
your brains?

1377
02:19:54,619 --> 02:19:57,087
How will this poor go alone to the
hospital in such a condition?

1378
02:19:57,789 --> 02:19:59,586
Grandpa, she does'nt have
any other alternative also,isn't it?

1379
02:20:00,125 --> 02:20:03,094
Who is with her,and she also can't
come to India with us.

1380
02:20:03,294 --> 02:20:04,090
Why can't she come?

1381
02:20:04,796 --> 02:20:06,764
You had promised her husband
isn't it

1382
02:20:07,132 --> 02:20:07,928
Yes, I had

1383
02:20:08,133 --> 02:20:10,931
Everybody listen,this is
my decision,

1384
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:13,263
That, Madhu will come
to Delhi along with us

1385
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:19,776
Greetings...

1386
02:20:24,149 --> 02:20:25,616
Greetings...

1387
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:28,111
He is my father, and they
are my brother & sister-in-law

1388
02:20:28,653 --> 02:20:29,779
What have they brought?

1389
02:20:29,988 --> 02:20:30,454
An auspicious offering

1390
02:20:30,989 --> 02:20:32,957
In the lap filling ceremony,
the pregnant woman.

1391
02:20:33,158 --> 02:20:34,284
Wears clothes brought only from
her parent's house

1392
02:20:34,659 --> 02:20:36,786
Great..., Is this such
a big ceremony?

1393
02:20:37,662 --> 02:20:38,128
Blessings...

1394
02:20:38,496 --> 02:20:41,294
Come... come...
Greetings... come

1395
02:20:41,666 --> 02:20:43,793
Pappu,Just listen, Mr.Priest
is asking for rice

1396
02:20:44,002 --> 02:20:44,627
Please make the
arrangement

1397
02:20:45,003 --> 02:20:45,799
should I call the
food minister

1398
02:20:46,004 --> 02:20:46,800
Tell me,how many bags
you want?

1399
02:20:47,005 --> 02:20:49,132
Oh god,for a handful of rice,
will you call up the minister

1400
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:50,967
Handful..
Bring it from the kitchen

1401
02:20:51,176 --> 02:20:51,801
Allright

1402
02:20:54,179 --> 02:20:56,147
Have you seen Bhati uncle
somewhere?

1403
02:20:58,016 --> 02:20:59,142
I haven't,but,what's
the matter?

1404
02:21:00,852 --> 02:21:01,978
Are you immitating me?

1405
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:08,989
Did your mother ever come & go
at fathehpur's red bungalow?

1406
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:13,656
Fathepur's Red bungalow, No,
my mother never went

1407
02:21:14,866 --> 02:21:16,163
My father freequently
visited there

1408
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:26,169
Father always used to say
that son,you have one sister

1409
02:21:27,045 --> 02:21:27,670
Father...

1410
02:21:32,217 --> 02:21:35,675
Priya, your auspicious dress has come,
now soon get ready

1411
02:21:36,888 --> 02:21:39,516
Mother, you go down, I'll
make Priya get ready

1412
02:21:42,227 --> 02:21:44,855
No Daughter, you can't
come down

1413
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:48,858
Look,I wanted both of yours
ceremonies to be performed together

1414
02:21:49,567 --> 02:21:51,535
But Mr.Priest said,that two
pregnant women together

1415
02:21:51,903 --> 02:21:53,871
Can't participate in
this function

1416
02:21:54,572 --> 02:21:55,197
Allright mother

1417
02:21:57,242 --> 02:22:03,203
And Priya my child,today get ready
exactly like a bride,fully decked up.

1418
02:22:03,414 --> 02:22:03,709
Allright

1419
02:22:04,916 --> 02:22:08,215
This ceremony is a very important
event in any woman's life

1420
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:12,389
Because a woman does'nt have
one birth,but she has 3 births

1421
02:22:13,758 --> 02:22:16,556
The first when she becomes someone's
daughter & comes into this world

1422
02:22:17,929 --> 02:22:19,897
The second,When she becomes
someone's wife.

1423
02:22:21,766 --> 02:22:23,734
And the third,when she
becomes a mother

1424
02:22:25,937 --> 02:22:28,906
And why this ceremony is performed bofore
a woman becomes mother is because

1425
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:32,068
That the forthcoming child gets
so many blessings & prayers

1426
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:34,237
that its birth is not
with pains

1427
02:22:34,779 --> 02:22:36,246
But its with
happiness

1428
02:22:40,952 --> 02:22:44,080
Now, soon get ready & come down
the time for the ritual is nearing.

1429
02:22:44,289 --> 02:22:45,085
Allright

1430
02:22:47,625 --> 02:22:50,753
Raj,you here,now don't
involve priya in your talks-

1431
02:22:50,962 --> 02:22:52,589
She has to get ready & come down
allright

1432
02:22:53,631 --> 02:22:55,428
Raj,I can't come in this
function

1433
02:22:55,733 --> 02:22:56,097
Why?

1434
02:22:56,801 --> 02:22:58,598
Mother said, that this is
not any ordinary ritual-

1435
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:02,599
All these prayers etc are for the
well-being of our child

1436
02:23:03,474 --> 02:23:06,102
Madhu should sit in this
ritual instead of me

1437
02:23:07,478 --> 02:23:08,604
But,how is this possible?

1438
02:23:08,980 --> 02:23:10,777
If madhu wears my
Bridal dress-

1439
02:23:11,149 --> 02:23:12,275
The veil would be there
isn't it?

1440
02:23:12,984 --> 02:23:15,282
And nobody will come to know
that she is Madhu

1441
02:23:32,003 --> 02:23:34,972
Madhu,will you wear the
auspicious dress?

1442
02:23:37,175 --> 02:23:37,641
Allright

1443
02:23:58,029 --> 02:24:00,497
Sister-in-law,just see if priya
has got ready or not?

1444
02:24:00,698 --> 02:24:01,323
Bring her at once

1445
02:24:01,532 --> 02:24:01,998
Allright sister

1446
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:03,997
Aunty,I'll go & see
-mother,I'll go

1447
02:24:04,202 --> 02:24:05,829
Saw,allright,you
itself get her

1448
02:24:14,379 --> 02:24:14,674
Who's it?

1449
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:15,846
It's me

1450
02:24:21,886 --> 02:24:22,682
Has madhu got ready?

1451
02:24:23,388 --> 02:24:24,013
Yes

1452
02:24:25,556 --> 02:24:26,523
Girls...

1453
02:24:28,393 --> 02:24:29,189
The auspicious thread...
I forgot

1454
02:24:29,394 --> 02:24:31,191
Listen.. I'll make her wear
you go

1455
02:24:31,396 --> 02:24:32,522
Alright,I'll go that side

1456
02:25:09,767 --> 02:25:11,064
make it fast...

1457
02:25:36,627 --> 02:25:40,757
The one who is going to furnish
my clan with a heir,I salute you

1458
02:25:42,133 --> 02:25:44,101
May God let your child
live forever

1459
02:25:45,303 --> 02:25:47,771
And the way, how sun shines
the entire world-

1460
02:25:48,973 --> 02:25:51,271
In the same way,your child
should shine my entire generation

1461
02:26:00,985 --> 02:26:02,953
May god, my age should add
to your child

1462
02:26:04,155 --> 02:26:06,123
And he brings so much
happiness in your life

1463
02:26:07,158 --> 02:26:09,456
That no happiness of the world
can match against it

1464
02:26:14,832 --> 02:26:18,962
Priya,Great,the color of heena has
blended so thick on your hands-

1465
02:26:19,837 --> 02:26:22,965
This means,Raj loves
you a lot

1466
02:29:27,358 --> 02:29:31,988
We have to take a family
photograph,come everyone come

1467
02:29:36,367 --> 02:29:37,334
Yes, take the photograph

1468
02:31:14,298 --> 02:31:15,765
Mr.priest, you start
the prayers

1469
02:31:15,966 --> 02:31:16,432
Allright

1470
02:31:24,308 --> 02:31:26,435
What is the name of the
child's great grand father?

1471
02:31:29,313 --> 02:31:34,114
May this great grandchild receive
all the happiness of the world

1472
02:31:34,485 --> 02:31:36,112
What is the child's
grandfather's name?

1473
02:31:39,156 --> 02:31:42,956
May this child receive
all the fame

1474
02:31:43,828 --> 02:31:45,295
What is the child's
grandmother's name?

1475
02:31:47,331 --> 02:31:50,129
May god bless this child

1476
02:31:50,501 --> 02:31:51,968
What is the child's
father's name?

1477
02:31:55,506 --> 02:31:58,475
May god make this
child live forever

1478
02:32:50,895 --> 02:32:51,520
Mother...

1479
02:32:51,896 --> 02:32:52,863
Today's function was great
isn't it?

1480
02:32:53,063 --> 02:32:54,860
Excellent, what was
the best among it?

1481
02:32:55,232 --> 02:32:56,699
Great grandfather's Dance,
what do you say?

1482
02:32:58,068 --> 02:33:01,196
What stromy winds are blowing
I'll get these windows closed

1483
02:33:01,739 --> 02:33:04,537
Look,it's too late,
you go and sleep

1484
02:33:05,743 --> 02:33:06,539
God bless you

1485
02:33:55,292 --> 02:33:56,259
Did you see Madhu
anywhere?

1486
02:33:58,462 --> 02:33:58,757
What?

1487
02:34:19,149 --> 02:34:21,447
Madhu,where are you going?

1488
02:34:22,987 --> 02:34:26,286
This child's mother is not
Priya Malothra,its me

1489
02:34:27,825 --> 02:34:35,960
This is my child,I'll not give my child
forgive me,I can't give this child

1490
02:34:36,500 --> 02:34:37,797
Madhu, don't say like this

1491
02:34:38,168 --> 02:34:40,636
For the last 9 months I have
undergone penance for its birth

1492
02:34:40,838 --> 02:34:42,806
Everyday I have weaved one new
dream for this child

1493
02:34:43,173 --> 02:34:44,140
At this time, not
only me or Raj-

1494
02:34:44,508 --> 02:34:48,137
But our entire family is counting
days for the childs birth

1495
02:34:48,512 --> 02:34:50,639
Madhu,all our happiness
is linked with it

1496
02:34:51,181 --> 02:34:53,979
I'll kill myself,but I'll
not part with my child

1497
02:34:54,685 --> 02:34:58,644
Madhu, you don't lack anything
unlike me,you can get married

1498
02:34:58,856 --> 02:34:59,982
You can again experience
motherhood

1499
02:35:00,357 --> 02:35:04,817
But I... I am incomplete,
I can never become a mother

1500
02:35:05,696 --> 02:35:08,995
Madhu,I beg of you,please
give me this child

1501
02:35:10,367 --> 02:35:13,165
In return of it,I'll give you
what ever you want

1502
02:35:17,875 --> 02:35:20,673
Allright,I am prepared to
give you my child

1503
02:35:21,545 --> 02:35:23,012
Can you give me
your husband?

1504
02:35:34,391 --> 02:35:36,018
After all,you showed your
true colour

1505
02:35:37,227 --> 02:35:40,025
I thought even a prostitute
was a woman

1506
02:35:41,398 --> 02:35:45,698
But you've proved that a prostitute
can never do good to anyone

1507
02:35:46,403 --> 02:35:48,030
She can only destroy
houses

1508
02:35:49,073 --> 02:35:50,700
I asked you your
husband from you

1509
02:35:51,241 --> 02:35:53,038
You made me remember
my status

1510
02:35:53,577 --> 02:35:55,704
You are asking form
a mother,her progeny

1511
02:35:56,413 --> 02:35:57,539
Mother,whether she is
a prositute

1512
02:35:57,748 --> 02:35:58,874
Or a daughter-in-law
of a house

1513
02:35:59,249 --> 02:36:00,716
Mother is only a mother

1514
02:36:02,252 --> 02:36:08,213
I'll not... I'll not give
you my child, I'll not...

1515
02:36:09,259 --> 02:36:13,218
Raj,she is refusing to
give us our child

1516
02:36:13,430 --> 02:36:14,397
Priya,but first look
at her condition

1517
02:36:19,937 --> 02:36:20,904
Immediately call up
doctor uncle

1518
02:36:32,282 --> 02:36:33,078
Everthing wil get allright

1519
02:36:53,971 --> 02:36:55,268
Madhu's scanning is
in progress

1520
02:36:55,806 --> 02:36:58,104
In a very short while,we'll
come to know the complications

1521
02:37:01,645 --> 02:37:02,270
It's mother's phone..

1522
02:37:03,814 --> 02:37:04,280
Yes mother

1523
02:37:04,481 --> 02:37:06,449
You,priya,Madhu all the
three of you are not in house?

1524
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:07,446
Where are you all?

1525
02:37:07,818 --> 02:37:08,785
Mother,we're all
at the hospital

1526
02:37:09,153 --> 02:37:10,620
Madhu and priya had
developed labour pains-

1527
02:37:10,988 --> 02:37:11,784
So,I've brought them here

1528
02:37:14,825 --> 02:37:15,951
We all are reaching
the hospital

1529
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:21,621
No mother no,you come at ease
okay,doctor uncle is with us

1530
02:37:21,999 --> 02:37:23,296
Oh god! I am
just coming.

1531
02:37:25,335 --> 02:37:26,461
Doctor has called you in.

1532
02:37:33,343 --> 02:37:34,469
The child in the stomach
has turned around-

1533
02:37:34,845 --> 02:37:36,472
That's why the child is not
at it s normal position.

1534
02:37:38,515 --> 02:37:39,140
All right,go ahead.

1535
02:37:39,349 --> 02:37:40,475
But,the condition
is serious.

1536
02:37:40,851 --> 02:37:44,309
I can either save the mother
or child in this operation

1537
02:37:47,024 --> 02:37:48,491
We'll have to take the decision
at the earliest

1538
02:37:55,032 --> 02:37:58,832
Doctor,you save
the mother.

1539
02:38:03,207 --> 02:38:05,175
Make arrangements to take
her to the operation theatre.

1540
02:38:05,375 --> 02:38:07,002
Nurse,take Raj's signature
-okay

1541
02:38:17,221 --> 02:38:20,520
Take her in,
careful....

1542
02:38:52,923 --> 02:38:56,222
This happens very rare,the
operation was sucessful.

1543
02:38:57,094 --> 02:38:58,891
Both Madhu and
child are safe.

1544
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:10,736
Congratulations,its
a boy baby.

1545
02:39:40,637 --> 02:39:41,604
How sweet child it is.

1546
02:39:45,642 --> 02:39:47,269
You wanted to save the mother
Isn't it.

1547
02:39:49,646 --> 02:39:50,442
Even the mother
got saved.

1548
02:39:51,148 --> 02:39:52,274
And your child too.

1549
02:39:55,652 --> 02:39:59,952
I got carried away for a while
and became selfish.

1550
02:40:02,326 --> 02:40:04,624
You are this
child's mother.

1551
02:40:08,832 --> 02:40:09,799
He is only yours.

1552
02:40:28,352 --> 02:40:30,320
Give me my Grandson...

1553
02:40:34,358 --> 02:40:37,486
Look....Look I am your
Great Grandfather.

1554
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,828
Oh yes,what about our madhu
a boy baby or a girl baby?

1555
02:40:48,872 --> 02:40:50,840
That poor girl's child
at its birth....

1556
02:40:58,715 --> 02:41:01,183
No child,don't get
disheartened.

1557
02:41:02,052 --> 02:41:03,519
Think that it was
not yours.

1558
02:41:04,721 --> 02:41:06,518
The same thing happened
even with our priya-

1559
02:41:07,724 --> 02:41:11,023
But did you see,in 1 year's time
god blessed her with another child.

1560
02:41:12,229 --> 02:41:12,854
Yes daughter

1561
02:41:37,254 --> 02:41:41,714
Madhu,don't go I'll disclose
the truth to my family members.

1562
02:41:44,094 --> 02:41:47,063
When two Brother's can stay
together,under one roof.

1563
02:41:48,265 --> 02:41:49,562
Then why can't two
sister's stay?

1564
02:41:52,602 --> 02:41:54,069
I have got my complete
family here.

1565
02:41:55,272 --> 02:41:56,739
I only lacked
a sister.

1566
02:41:58,608 --> 02:41:59,575
Today,I even
got that

1567
02:42:01,611 --> 02:42:03,078
Let this sister remain
as sister.

1568
02:42:04,948 --> 02:42:05,915
Don't make her
a co-wife.

1569
02:42:07,617 --> 02:42:12,077
Otherwise,no woman would ever
have belief on another woman.

1570
02:42:16,126 --> 02:42:19,926
Only you have rights on
this family,and on Raj.

1571
02:42:21,965 --> 02:42:25,594
My rights are only on those
remembrabces,which I got here.

1572
02:42:35,979 --> 02:42:36,946
What more do
I want?

1573
02:42:50,494 --> 02:42:54,294
Madhu,you have been checked-in
This is your boarding pass.

1574
02:42:55,332 --> 02:42:56,629
Your bags have been sent
into the luggage.

1575
02:42:58,502 --> 02:42:59,799
In this,there are keys
of your new house-

1576
02:43:01,671 --> 02:43:03,969
And some blank cheques
on your name.

1577
02:43:06,676 --> 02:43:08,303
The deed which you have done
for me and for priya.

1578
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:11,977
For that,even if I give you
my entire wealth-

1579
02:43:13,016 --> 02:43:13,641
Even then,its less.

1580
02:43:15,685 --> 02:43:22,318
Just consider this to be a
small gift from me & priya.

1581
02:43:22,692 --> 02:43:25,490
I have taken my gift,
look at this-

1582
02:43:27,697 --> 02:43:29,824
I am taking my entire
family along with me

1583
02:43:31,034 --> 02:43:34,162
Other than this,If I take
anything else,it'll look as though-

1584
02:43:35,372 --> 02:43:37,340
A mother has taken a price
for her child.

1585
02:43:38,208 --> 02:43:39,175
But Madhu,you....

1586
02:43:39,543 --> 02:43:43,502
I'll not return back to that world
from where you had brought me.

1587
02:43:48,051 --> 02:43:51,851
You had touched me once,here after
no one else can touch me!
