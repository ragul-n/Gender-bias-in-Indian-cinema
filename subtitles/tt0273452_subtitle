1
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,864
- Look! Mom and Dad are working
over there. - Where?

2
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:24,298
- Mom! - Hello, dear. - It's ready.
- We'll have it there. - Okay.

3
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:29,665
I'll give you some money.
Get some groceries.

4
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:34,172
Give me some extra money.
I want to buy a shirt for Raju.

5
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:39,140
- Why does he need to cover
himself? He's a boy. - Mom!

6
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,803
My brother goes about shirtless.
It pains me to see that.

7
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:49,906
- We're saving for your marriage.
- Then I won't get married!

8
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:55,034
- There! - Okay. I'll give you
the money to buy a shirt.

9
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:04,037
It's so late.
Why isn't Raju home as yet?

10
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:14,200
Help me with the basket, please.
Is the dinner ready, my dear?

11
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,469
Where are you, my dear?
I'm asking about the dinner.

12
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:24,540
You and your dinner!
Raju hasn't returned from the tailor.

13
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:28,066
And till you see that shirt
on him, you won't be at ease!

14
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:32,564
- I've yet to see a sister
so mad about her brother! - True.

15
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:42,531
Why so late? Do you know,
I was so worried about you?

16
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,841
Let's see how my brother
looks in a new shirt.

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,007
What's this? I gave this
to stitch a shirt.

18
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,804
- And you got a blouse made?
- It's for you, sister.

19
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:12,639
Nobody bothers if I go bare, but
everybody eyes your torn blouse.

20
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,902
That's why I got a blouse
made instead.

21
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,166
Bless you. What about that
case concerning your inheritance?

22
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:58,404
Lt'll be decided today. I hear
this Goddess is powerful.

23
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,097
That's why I came to
take her blessing.

24
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:01,771
- What are you saying?
- It's true.

25
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:06,599
It was a very auspicious time
when he saw your daughter.

26
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:12,036
That's why he won the case
which was going on for years.

27
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:17,137
Then naturally, he who was
a confirmed bachelor for years...

28
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,804
...decided there and then, that
if he weds, it'll be your daughter.

29
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,297
I've come here with his proposal!

30
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:29,730
- Mom, look what...
- Hello, dear. You're so lucky.

31
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:33,699
Suraj Pratap of Chandanpur,
has asked your hand in marriage.

32
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:01,803
Sir, your marriage heralds
nothing but success.

33
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:08,007
If we poor have erred in
any way, please forgive us.

34
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:13,568
- Oh come on, you're like a father
to me. - I'll just come.

35
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,307
It's time to bid goodbye
to the bride. - I'll just come.

36
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:24,007
What's this? You're giving
these old things in her dowry?

37
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,940
- Then shall I send her empty handed?
- Silly!

38
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:31,836
All these broken things are
in our poor lot! Not hers.

39
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:36,400
Look. There's so much love
in this gift of a poor mother...

40
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:41,270
Nothing in this world can
buy it! - So okay, but hurry!

41
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:46,534
You're always in a hurry. You tend
to guests, leave this to me

42
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:57,404
Excuse me...

43
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:04,904
- What is it?
- I want to say something.

44
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,907
Okay.

45
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:13,967
My parents wish to give you
as a dowry...

46
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,007
...this whole village!

47
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:21,205
But they've nothing.

48
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:28,064
But there's an invaluable
thing in this house.

49
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:34,307
If you don't mind,
may I take it with me?

50
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:40,174
If it's so dear to you,
why should I mind? Take it

51
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,406
This is that dear thing.
My brother, Raju.

52
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:11,101
So!
This is that invaluable thing!

53
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:17,374
Listen, Raju. From today,
he's the world to me.

54
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,102
- You'll do as he says,
- So brother-in-law...

55
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:26,065
...will you come with us?
- Whatever you say, is fine with me.

56
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:27,998
Bless you.

57
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,098
This is my sister, Jyoti.

58
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:07,201
She was just 6 months old
when our parents died.

59
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:12,774
She has never known parental love
she doesn't even know a mother.

60
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:18,675
Or mother's love. A girl, who
loves her brother so deeply...

61
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:22,670
...can also love my sister
just as much.

62
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:28,135
When on that day, I saw you
at the temple, I felt...

63
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,704
...as though God had sent
mother's love to my Jyoti.

64
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:40,265
Jyoti, she's your sister-in-law.

65
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:48,005
- Who's he?
- He's my brother-in-law, Raju.

66
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,665
So!
You're here to play with me, eh?

67
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:36,130
- Where are you, Raju?
- I'm here.

68
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:43,237
- Why are you making a noise?
- I've come to show you magic!

69
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:47,363
- Now close your eyes.
- But why?

70
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:50,138
Close your eyes first, please.

71
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:53,736
Okay. Here you are.

72
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:06,899
Now open your eyes.

73
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:23,632
Wow! It's just for you.
And it took me 3 days.

74
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:28,699
Wonderful! It's marvelous.
Well done, my boy.

75
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,474
His name is, "HIRA".
Salute them, Hira!

76
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,263
Hira, will you take us all
for a ride?

77
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,969
Will you dance at a marriage?

78
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,473
Will you eat peanuts
from our fields?

79
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:53,239
Then how about eating
from other people's fields?

80
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,634
He's such a faithful soul,
I've made half a man out of him.

81
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,963
- Why not fully? - If I had,
he'd have become disloyal.

82
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:12,299
You did this for me,
by toiling night and day?

83
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:16,299
I've but one duty for 24 hours.
To obey you...

84
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:21,272
...to do your work, serve you,
and to take care of you.

85
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:26,869
How many times do I tell you, that
your place is not at my feet...

86
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,905
- It's in my heart.
- Can't help it. It's a habit.

87
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:33,667
Will you just chat, or
come to the temple too?

88
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:37,304
Forget it! Until you both go
there, everything will be held up.

89
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:43,203
- How I wish Jyoti was here!
- When her exams get over, she will.

90
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,632
- Very soon, too. - Ready?
- Yes. - Come, Hira.

91
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,602
- Greetings sir.
- How are you? I'm fine, sir.

92
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:59,239
- Hello, sir, - How was your cane
this year? - Good, by god's grace.

93
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:04,936
- Are your kids admitted in school?
- Yes, thanks to you.

94
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,538
Not really.
It's all due to the Holy Mother.

95
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,998
- Greetings, sir. - Greetings.
- You too, Madam. - Greetings.

96
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:17,103
- Is everything ready?
- Nearly. Like every year...

97
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,431
...l've to take the cloth from
your wife and put it on the Mother.

98
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:39,470
- Here I am. Yes?
- My sister's coming!

99
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:44,873
- What's the matter?
- Jyoti's coming.

100
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:50,097
- So why are you shouting?
- Till I don't tell this to others...

101
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:53,601
...this stomach of mine
will not stop aching.

102
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:59,733
Listen, this wire is late.
She must be at the bus stop.

103
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:02,473
- Go and get her quick!
- Okay. I'll tell people enroute

104
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:11,335
- What is it?
- Your darling Jyoti's coming.

105
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:16,103
- So why yell the place down?
- Ramdin, did you hear?

106
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,096
Jyoti's coming home.

107
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,505
- Have you seen my brother-in-law's
sister. - Your brother-in-law?

108
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:50,303
You mean you don't know him?
Who made you a conductor, eh?

109
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:11,831
- I think I've seen you before.
- I'm Jyoti!

110
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:15,733
- You've seen me since I was a kid.
- Remove those glares.

111
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:23,636
- What happened to you?
- You're a big shot's sister...

112
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,837
...and you wear such short clothes?
Were you short of money...

113
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,573
...or did the tailor steal
the cloth? Pull it down!

114
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:36,104
- What are you doing?
Somebody may see. - Really?

115
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:40,371
Even a blind man will stare
at you in this attire!

116
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:45,867
- This is the latest fashion.
- Not fashion, but, "tension"!

117
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:49,432
Oh sweet pudding of mine!
You're so lovable.

118
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:53,069
Get lost! Pudding of mine!
Will you eat me up then?

119
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,136
- One day I will for sure!
- Your brother and my sis await you.

120
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,873
Wonderful! You whistled
and the horse came in reverse!

121
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:19,205
I obey my brother-in-law, and,
Hira does, what I tell him to.

122
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,595
Now sit in the buggy which
I made with my own hands.

123
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,296
Because this is a village,
not the city. Understand?

124
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:38,166
- How were your exams?
- Ist class, I'm asking my sis.

125
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:42,596
I asked her the same on the way.
She said "Ist class"

126
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:46,405
So I told you the same.
That is, Ist class. Right?

127
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,366
- Tell him. - Yes, brother.
100°/° Ist class. - Good.

128
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:57,237
- Come inside. - No!
- Why not? - Just a minute.

129
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,899
May no evil eye be cast
from here, there...

130
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:10,037
...inside, outside or anywhere
Now spit! On this, silly.

131
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,599
- Now go in without looking
here and there. - What's all this?

132
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:20,730
You don't know it but
all the evil eyes...

133
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:23,405
...from this village
have been cast on Jyoti.

134
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:28,131
Has it been seen to?
Then shall we go in? Looking back?

135
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:31,730
No, no. Look ahead.
Ahead. Not behind?

136
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,401
Then let's go in.
Hurry.

137
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:42,567
Jyoti has put on weight in quintals.
So I think...

138
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:45,567
...from today she should
stop eating rice and rotis!!

139
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,899
I think there's trouble ahead.

140
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:55,304
- You sit here, I'll go...
- No!

141
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,797
You wait here.
I'll find out.

142
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,334
I'll do whatever
he tells me to.

143
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,965
- Stop!
- Sir, have mercy and save us.

144
00:20:13,474 --> 00:20:18,668
These police are forcing our men
to work at illicit liquor joints.

145
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:22,196
Today they are forcing our men
to make illicit liquor...

146
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:25,835
If a case comes up tomorrow,
they'll have our men jailed!

147
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:32,569
Well Constable, what's going on?
Keepers of the law making hooch?

148
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,035
Who are you to question this?

149
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:40,400
- Great! That's the way.
- Look, whoever you are...

150
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,306
...you better keep far away
from this matter.

151
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:47,763
I think you're new here...

152
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:51,798
Else you wouldn't dare
be so insolent with me.

153
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:57,205
- This is Sir Suraj Pratap
- I see.

154
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:03,336
What will he do to us?
Will he set the sun forever?

155
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:07,569
Will he darken our lives?
What will he do?

156
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm respecting you because
you're wearing a police uniform.

157
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,962
- Learn to respect others.
- He wants respect. Okay.

158
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,903
Here it is...
Go on...

159
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:09,432
- He lifted his hand at you.
- Let him go, didn't you say...

160
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:14,304
...that you do as I tell you to?
Then let him go.

161
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:20,496
You escaped this time because
I do what he tells me to.

162
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,663
Welcome. Welcome...
She has come to your village.

163
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:35,800
The Sheen of Beauty...
The very pulse of the youth...

164
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:38,637
An action of grace...
"Vaishali."

165
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:44,535
One good news for all.
After her colorful dance...

166
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,564
Vaishali will throw a garland.
In who's ever neck...

167
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,168
...that garland falls, will
brighten his luck with Vaishali

168
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:59,067
Come one, come all.
Hurry up and come.

169
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:18,534
Wow! One dance from my sis...
It has rained money for me.

170
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:25,170
- You're right. There's lots of money
here. - That's why I fixed this.

171
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:29,264
I'll see that we empty the safe
of every rich man here

172
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:33,601
- No trouble, I hope.
- This uniform commands power.

173
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,228
- Me first. - No, me...
- don't invite trouble.

174
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:49,938
- Don't threaten! - I'll break your
bones. - I'll unscrew your head.

175
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,299
- Who is it?
- It's us. - I'm Millu.

176
00:29:56,074 --> 00:30:01,405
- A big landlord from Millupur.
- I'm Tillu. - A small man.

177
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:06,702
The garland is around your neck.
So, come on over.

178
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,505
- You've seen the dance. So what
do you want? - I've come to put on.

179
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:27,804
- What! - A ring. May I?
- Where will you put it on?

180
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,532
- There's no room.
- I'll make a place for it.

181
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:37,001
- I'll put it on your toe.
- Oh? And what if it doesn't fit?

182
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:42,296
- I'll try. - Try, eh?
Come outside. I'll fry you!

183
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:47,504
Your wish. Hurry up though.
But where do I put my foot?

184
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:51,965
- Here, like this.
- Go on, put it on.

185
00:30:58,474 --> 00:30:59,666
Does it hurt?

186
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:10,204
My dear, this ring
is a good omen.

187
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:16,433
I'll will all my money,
property on your name.

188
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,631
- Really?
- Please don't leave this village.

189
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:23,665
We both shall...

190
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:34,139
This guy's turned to statue
at her mere touch!

191
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:39,237
What will he do further?
If I get a chance I'll crack bones!

192
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:41,367
Out with you!

193
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,897
Where are you off to?

194
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:57,396
I want to meet your folks.
Take me to your village

195
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,063
- Now? - Yes.
- Sorry. I've a lot of work to do.

196
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:06,164
- We'll hurry there and back.
- I don't have the time.

197
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:10,939
I've got to attend to the fields.
If you want you go.

198
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:15,538
Kallu, what are you doing?
Give water to the buffalo

199
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:21,132
Go, keep this.

200
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:29,999
- Yes? - Leave everything and take
my sis to your parents.

201
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:34,736
- Yes. - Hurry up now.
- Sure. I'll do whatever he says.

202
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:44,003
- What is it? - Come on.
You wanted to meet my parents.

203
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,070
No, not now. You've to attend
to the fields, markets...

204
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:54,105
- You've a lot of work, right?
- Work will never stop.

205
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,401
Come along, your brother
has ordered me. So go we must.

206
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:01,070
- He and his brother-in-law!
- What? - Nothing. Come along.

207
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:06,832
Where are you going?

208
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,697
Raju was feeling homesick.
So he asked me to tag along too.

209
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:15,037
So I said okay. Isn't it?

210
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,671
- Have you just come?
- Yes. Why?

211
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,465
She impersonated your voice
and made a fool out of me.

212
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,699
She wants me to take her to my
parents. How can I, with this work?

213
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:33,661
Look, brother, I've brought some
presents for his parents.

214
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:38,038
I've been requesting him for ages.
Please ask him to take me.

215
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:42,639
- Go, but hurry back.
- I won't go if you say so - Go!

216
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,963
- You've got presents for my folks
but what about me? - For you...

217
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:55,796
...l've got such a nice one
that you'll sway all your life!

218
00:33:56,407 --> 00:34:00,031
I know. You've got a necklace
of huge beads for my bullocks!

219
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:04,966
- I don't know when you'll mature.
- Why? - You don't understand!

220
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,768
As if you do! We'd have reached
earlier had we crossed the river.

221
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:13,839
- You made me take the longer route.
- We can talk more that way.

222
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:17,800
Sweet nothings.
But I won't let you go.

223
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,931
- Why did you stop the cycle?
- I can't control it any more.

224
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:29,472
- You better sit on the bar.
- Why? Did something happen?

225
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,235
- Nothing. Only the air is leaking
by and by. Sit here. - Okay.

226
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,372
- What now?
- Get down. - Tell me.

227
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:49,498
- The point is, the village is here
Let's walk. - Walk?

228
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:54,801
- Yes - It was fun sitting
in the front. - For you, not me.

229
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:56,897
I was feeling tensed.
Now let's move!

230
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,796
Look! Cold drinks.
Let's have one.

231
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,730
Wait. Why waste money on this?
We'll go home and drink butter milk.

232
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:13,368
- You're a scrooge? A miser!
- I'm not a miser.

233
00:35:13,907 --> 00:35:15,373
I think about the future.

234
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:22,435
If a landlord proposes to you,
he'd want 2 million as dowry.

235
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:26,736
If a doctor is approached
he'll ask for 11/2 million. And...

236
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:30,403
...if you waste money on drinks
what will we give?

237
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:31,667
This?

238
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:42,003
I see! So you'll get a groom
for me, eh? We'll see about that.

239
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,971
- Our Jyoti is grown up now.
- Yes.

240
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:59,632
- She must get married too.
- But Raju's also eligible.

241
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:04,464
- Why don't you get him married?
- We will, if he'll listen.

242
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:09,466
- He just runs away!
- Won't do! He must wed this year.

243
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:12,804
You're right. Find a girl.

244
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,604
- Which girl? - You make all the
arrangements. The girl will agree.

245
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:24,303
There must be a girl
in our relatives.

246
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,463
Where is such a girl
in our relations?

247
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:33,407
May be in far off relation,
or even a near relation.

248
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,900
- Or your own daughters?
- Our daughter's family?

249
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,605
- Is there such a girl?
- There must be!

250
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,367
Must have gone to the city
for studies, and come home too.

251
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:50,231
- And she must be pining
to get married! - I know!

252
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:55,671
- Who is it?
- Our daughter's village...

253
00:36:56,807 --> 00:37:00,569
She's talking about that
school master's daughter. Right?

254
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:06,464
That black kettle married 3 years
ago and has 6 kids already!

255
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:10,405
- My God! 6 kids in 3 years?
- Yes. Twice in a year!

256
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,868
- Goodness!
- Which girl do you mean?

257
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,463
- How do I tell you now?
- You're sitting here? Come on.

258
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:25,798
- I don't know when you come
and when you go! - Hug me, Mom.

259
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,103
- My respects, father.
- Bless you. Son, - Come on, you!

260
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:35,203
- What's that in the bag?
- Veg. Seeds. I bought some here.

261
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,538
- They're for your garden...
- Yes. Come on, you!

262
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:42,600
- Eat something and go.
- No, sis will be waiting for me.

263
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:46,302
- Have one morsel from my
hands too. - Okay, feed me.

264
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:53,961
Mom, takes so much time in feeding.
That's why I avoid coming.

265
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:58,301
- Son, this is your home too.
- Oh yes! I forgot completely.

266
00:37:58,707 --> 00:38:01,968
- Give me some more then.
- Here.

267
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,863
And what about, sis?

268
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:10,434
This is for your, Sis?
My dear...

269
00:38:10,939 --> 00:38:15,305
...he went to your house and
he has forgotten us! - Don't worry.

270
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:20,200
- I'll remind him!
- My foot, you will!

271
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,868
- Hold this. It's for your
sis-in-law. Bye, Dad. Come on.

272
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:31,202
I'm not a miser at all.
I think of the future ahead.

273
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:38,934
Some landlord may ask for 2 million
for your hand in marriage.

274
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:42,497
A doctor may demand 11/2 million.
And if...

275
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,863
...you waste money like this,
what will we give him? This?

276
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:15,202
Ghost! A Ghost!

277
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:24,501
Jyoti! I wondered how a ghost
weighing 350 Kgs fell on me?

278
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,468
- But why are you here now?
- Don't yell, if brother finds out...

279
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:35,703
...we'll be in trouble. - What!
- To hear what I've to say...

280
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,972
...you'll have to brace yourself.

281
00:39:38,273 --> 00:39:42,797
Brace myself? This brawn you see
is a facade. I'm a real softy.

282
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,733
- What's the problem?
- The problem is, I...

283
00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:52,835
...for the past 3 months I...
- What! What the hell, Jyoti...

284
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,963
We never expected this from you.
Your family will be devastated!

285
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:01,835
- It's not what you think!
- Then what is it?

286
00:40:02,773 --> 00:40:07,171
For the past 3 months,
after 7 P. M...

287
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,298
...I can't see anything

288
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,203
Night blindness!
O dear God...

289
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,903
...how did this happen to Jyoti?
What a catastrophe!

290
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:24,201
I'm not understanding at all.
I'll go and tell your brother.

291
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:27,635
- Let go of my neck!
- Don't tell him about this.

292
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,538
- Why not?
- He'll get a shock of his life!

293
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:35,667
Don't be afraid.
I've heard...

294
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:39,471
...there's a doctor in the city.
Dr. Shyam Bajaj - Him?

295
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:43,601
I've gone to other
famous doctors too.

296
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:47,835
They all said the same thing.
There's no cure to this ailment

297
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,506
O Lord! Why this...

298
00:40:55,939 --> 00:40:58,201
Now that I've got
this night blindness...

299
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,832
...will anyone marry me?
- Why not, damn it? Just say yes...

300
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:07,165
I'll have those landlords standing
in a line. But later, they'll say...

301
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:13,969
...bloody blind, unfortunate girl.
Then you'll go to jail.

302
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,706
- I'll kill them if they do that.
- Then you'll go to jail.

303
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,363
Even get hanged.
Then all of us will cry.

304
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:26,965
- The best thing will be that,
you marry me! - Me?

305
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,267
- Yes. - How can that be?
You're a city-educated girl.

306
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:35,535
And I'm a son of the soil.
This can never happen.

307
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:39,597
I know why you're refusing
to marry me.

308
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:45,335
- What? - Because I'm blind
and can't see at night. Isn't it?

309
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:50,105
- I don't mind marrying a blind girl.
- Then you will marry me, won't you?

310
00:41:50,673 --> 00:41:54,968
If nobody else marries you,
I'll think about it.

311
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:58,970
What! You'll think about it,
only if others refuse me?

312
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:03,400
Okay, Okay I'll marry you.

313
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:13,671
- Enough! Go upstairs and sleep.
- I'm very sleepy; I'll sleep here.

314
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:19,005
- Cool breeze, darling Raju...
- Go and sleep upstairs

315
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:25,205
- I'm blind, how can I go up?
- Go up as you came down.

316
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:28,667
- Now even I'm going blind.
- I won't go up.

317
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:32,497
- Shall I holler for your brother?
- I'm going... - Go!

318
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,265
Nobody helps a blind person.

319
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,662
O Father in Heaven.
Why do you distress us earthlings?

320
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:50,164
Give Jyoti her sight again.

321
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,933
Hey Vaishali, we're waiting here.
When will you come out?

322
00:43:06,906 --> 00:43:12,168
I never saw so many oxen
ever after my buffaloes!

323
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:17,102
And look at them!
They're out before the sun rise!

324
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:21,637
- Yes?
- Are all these Vaishali's fans?

325
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:24,564
No. They're all street dogs.
Like you!

326
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:29,898
...I'll break your bones,
you son of a gun!

327
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:43,397
Who the hell is this?

328
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:50,866
Hey gramophone, what happened
to the Chillu from Chillupur?

329
00:43:52,206 --> 00:43:53,695
He drowned in a cup of water!

330
00:43:56,106 --> 00:43:58,901
This voice, this tone,
seems familiar.

331
00:44:07,473 --> 00:44:08,836
Saved!
He didn't recognize me.

332
00:44:11,006 --> 00:44:13,801
- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings!

333
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,434
So! You're Chillu. The
landlord of Chillupur.

334
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:21,402
- How did you guess?
- By your style of sweeping!

335
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:26,530
Cad! Your body is
like a tar-drum.

336
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:30,196
Your walk like some boar
covered... with mud!

337
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:33,897
How will I not recognize you?
I'll break your bones yet!

338
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:38,605
Believe me Millu, I gave this
ancestral house of mine...

339
00:44:38,973 --> 00:44:43,735
...and 60 acres of land to Vaishali.
That's why I'm like this.

340
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:47,664
- Else I'm the same Chillu landlord.
- Shut up!

341
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:53,729
A man who stole shoes from temples
calls himself landlord Chillu!

342
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:57,871
- Whom are you talking to?
- I'm praising you to the public.

343
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,563
- Public? Where is it?
- Right here!

344
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:24,902
Well, sister... see how
they bleat like goats!

345
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:28,068
Tell me. Whom do you choose?

346
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:33,671
- My whole baby is gold!
- Tarnished type!

347
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,497
- Who's this bird-brain?
- Millu. A landlord from Millupur.

348
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:42,469
He's the lone owner of 700 acres.

349
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:47,803
Then keep the basket of
flowers in his carriage.

350
00:45:52,006 --> 00:45:55,768
- See Chillu? - What?
- The power of 700 acres!

351
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:58,766
I'll break her bones today!

352
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,571
Give alms to the blind.

353
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:08,304
Stop! My Vaishali will offer
prayers at this temple.

354
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:10,637
Welcome, welcome.
It's old me. Come...

355
00:46:10,939 --> 00:46:15,200
Welcome...

356
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:34,803
Hey, look! It's Vaishali! Look!

357
00:46:41,872 --> 00:46:43,735
Give alms to the lame.

358
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:59,066
- Why did you hit me?
- You can ogle at my Vaishali.

359
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,131
- And on seeing us, you become blind.
- To see a thing like Vaishali...

360
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:08,496
...one needs to have eyes!
Not to see ugly ducklings like you!

361
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,232
- He's calling you ugly.
- Not me, but you! - Quiet!

362
00:47:15,306 --> 00:47:16,499
I mean the both of you!

363
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:24,860
- Give alms to the blind.
- To the lame.

364
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,799
- Give alms to the blind.
- He beats even us at this game.

365
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,102
- Whose buggy is this?
- A landlord from this village.

366
00:47:59,607 --> 00:48:03,403
He just went in. He's the
patron of this temple.

367
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:06,304
He's no man, but a
reincarnation of God!

368
00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:11,661
He didn't give me a
second look even!

369
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:17,104
My horse is white. Not
a black one like this.

370
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,372
I know. You both go, and sit
in the carriage I'll just come.

371
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:22,936
Go on!

372
00:48:50,872 --> 00:48:52,235
- Let's go, Biharibabu.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,765
- What's the matter?
- He won't move. - Hira! Go!

374
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:11,637
Let's go now.

375
00:49:16,672 --> 00:49:18,900
Hey... Go slowly, will you?

376
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:45,039
What happened, sir?

377
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,363
- My buggy over-turned.
- Not the buggy.

378
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,533
But it seems, the man certainly has!

379
00:49:56,806 --> 00:50:00,738
- You're seriously hurt.
- No. I'm alright.

380
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:02,595
Careful now.

381
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:09,767
- Come, I'll give you a lift.
- No. I'll go on my own.

382
00:50:10,172 --> 00:50:14,195
How will you go in this condition?
Such adamancy is not nice.

383
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:16,566
Come along... Oh, come on.

384
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:34,628
Stop! Get down!

385
00:50:36,572 --> 00:50:40,629
You both get his buggy
repaired. Come on, driver.

386
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,871
Your carriage, and her passenger!

387
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:55,269
I'll break your bones! Come on.

388
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:06,728
This is my house. Please come in.

389
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:12,832
- No. I'll go now.
- Why? Is my house out of bounds?

390
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:17,605
Nothing like that. I'll
come some other time.

391
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:22,502
You'll have to come now!
You're badly hurt.

392
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:25,064
I'll have to put something
on it. Please come in.

393
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,169
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing. - Then come on in.

394
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:44,296
Please sit here. Go on.

395
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,968
What will you have?
I said, what will you drink?

396
00:51:53,973 --> 00:51:57,803
You're staring as though
you'd like to eat me!

397
00:52:08,373 --> 00:52:10,099
- Let it be.
- Why?

398
00:52:10,706 --> 00:52:16,036
See how it's bleeding.
Let me... serve you a little.

399
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:30,632
- What are you looking at?
- I... Nothing.

400
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,872
Liar! You saw alright.

401
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:41,026
Your stare has pierced my breast.

402
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:45,406
My beauty lies in my body.
And yours...

403
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:50,867
...in these moustaches!
I've liked you very much.

404
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,571
I'm such a lovely trouble.
I'm surrendering myself to you.

405
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:59,404
And there you are...
Hesitating!

406
00:52:59,939 --> 00:53:02,871
Why? Have you lost your virility?

407
00:53:19,939 --> 00:53:24,598
O Lord, what a calamity.
Take my sight if you want.

408
00:53:25,072 --> 00:53:27,766
But give Jyoti hers.

409
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:43,330
How did this happen to you?

410
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:48,661
Never mind, if that's what
God wants. Who can defy it?

411
00:53:50,472 --> 00:53:53,438
I believe you didn't eat
anything today. - Not a thing.

412
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:57,030
You poor thing... Let's go.

413
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:08,302
Jyoti! Get up.

414
00:54:12,138 --> 00:54:15,832
- What happened?
- You can't see, so you slipped.

415
00:54:17,373 --> 00:54:19,668
Then I must have mud
all over my body.

416
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:25,765
- Since you fell in mud, it can't be
cream on you! - Then clean me up.

417
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:30,367
- Me? No I can't do that.
- Then I'll go in like this only.

418
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:32,738
Okay, I'll clean you up. Sit down.

419
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:54,401
- My God! - What is it?
- You're uncovered. Sit properly.

420
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:58,430
- I'm blind. - But I'm not!
Now cover yourself.

421
00:54:59,038 --> 00:55:01,800
- Okay. I'm respectable now.
- Let's go.

422
00:55:03,172 --> 00:55:07,264
- Now what? - You pulled my "lungi".
- I thought it was a towel.

423
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:10,567
Being blind you can make errors.
You want a towel? Here.

424
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:16,403
O Holy Mother... by
hook or by crook...

425
00:55:16,905 --> 00:55:19,428
...let Jyoti get back her sight.

426
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:29,229
- Hey, come here.
- What is it?

427
00:55:30,138 --> 00:55:33,934
- Take matches from my pocket, and
light this camphor. - No, I won't.

428
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:35,493
Light it!

429
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:13,138
- What's the matter?
- The temple. Raju... - What happened?

430
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:54,729
- Come, Jyoti.
- Wait, Raju.

431
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:00,030
Wait, Raju!

432
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:37,262
Why did you do that?

433
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,634
- Forgive me, Raju.
- What are you saying?

434
00:57:45,038 --> 00:57:48,334
I lied to you.

435
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:52,899
- Lied to me?
- Yes. That night blindness.

436
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:56,130
That ailment. It was all a lie!

437
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:04,629
I've loved you since I was a child.

438
00:58:05,238 --> 00:58:09,694
But you always said you'd
get me married to some landlord!

439
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:14,968
Thus, to marry you, I did all this.

440
00:58:16,672 --> 00:58:18,570
For that you told me
such a blatant lie!

441
00:58:20,572 --> 00:58:24,901
Do you know how worried I was!
The night I came to know...

442
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:30,302
...I didn't sleep a wink!
I spent the whole night thinking.

443
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:35,466
I went to every temple to pray.
Then I heard about this.

444
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:39,562
That by climbing the steps on
ones knees, one can ask anything.

445
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:43,731
All the ailments are cured.
That's why I climbed for you.

446
00:58:44,806 --> 00:58:48,636
- And you lied to me!
- But Raju, I...

447
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:51,903
I don't want to hear anything.
I can endure anything.

448
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:56,732
But not lies and dishonesty.
I don't want to see your face!

449
00:58:57,472 --> 00:59:00,597
- But didn't you promise
to marry me? - Yes, I did.

450
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,366
Thinking that you're struck
with blindness!

451
00:59:04,038 --> 00:59:09,971
You mean you'd marry me
if I became blind. Right?

452
00:59:12,706 --> 00:59:16,001
Okay. I need you, Raju.
Not these eyes of mine.

453
00:59:45,938 --> 00:59:48,336
Let go of me! Let go!

454
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:45,970
- You won't forget, will you?
- No, I won't. I'll bring it...

455
01:05:46,472 --> 01:05:50,063
...and put it in your nose myself.
It'll be a balm to my eyes!

456
01:05:53,271 --> 01:05:56,466
- Why are you sitting in this?
- Why? How does it upset you?

457
01:05:56,771 --> 01:06:00,203
- Because this buggy belongs
to my brother-in-low. - Oh, I see.

458
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:06,566
Brother-in-law, eh?
That makes you my relative too!

459
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:12,494
- Come on then. You are entitled.
- That's my sister's place.

460
01:06:13,138 --> 01:06:17,070
How did you dare to sit there?
Will you get down or do I pull you?

461
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:21,263
So... you were just wanting
an excuse to touch my hand!

462
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:25,796
I can't help it.
People just long to touch me.

463
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:30,403
Yearn to possess me!
Anyway one more to that list!

464
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:33,595
- Let's go! - Stop!
Where are you going? Get off!

465
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,100
- Poor girl...
- He threw her down!

466
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:46,398
Why you!
You dare throw my sister?

467
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,494
If you had been a man,
today I'd have!!

468
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:15,497
Raju! What the hell did you do?

469
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:24,829
Don't you know we respect ladies?
You throw Vaishali down in public?

470
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:29,995
I can't bear it see any other
woman sitting in my sister's place.

471
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:33,964
I'll decide who's
to sit in my buggy.

472
01:08:35,371 --> 01:08:37,234
Go and apologize to Vaishali
this very moment.

473
01:08:41,304 --> 01:08:44,202
No! I won't go and
apologize to her.

474
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:48,832
Where has Raju erred for
him to apologize to her?

475
01:08:49,705 --> 01:08:52,694
He had made that buggy
for you both to see...

476
01:08:53,237 --> 01:08:58,226
...a where sitting...
- Shut up! City education, eh?

477
01:08:59,038 --> 01:09:02,128
You argue with your brother?
You side with Raju?

478
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:06,935
Wonderful, dear wife!
What an upbringing you gave!

479
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:11,067
Not just your brothers, but
you made my sister rude too.

480
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:13,600
My word has no value
in my own house!

481
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:28,266
- Where are you going, sister?
- To apologize to Vaishali. - What!

482
01:09:28,871 --> 01:09:33,132
That down whore, Who can't hold a
candle to you. You're going to her?

483
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:40,371
You may be feeling humiliated
to go at her door, but I don't.

484
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:45,763
Somebody has to respect your
brother-in-law in this house.

485
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,570
No, sister!
I won't let you go there.

486
01:09:49,304 --> 01:09:53,431
- I'll go and apologize.
- Raju! How can you!

487
01:09:56,137 --> 01:09:59,331
Whatever...
Whatever I've done till today...

488
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:03,231
...has always been to save
the honor of this household.

489
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,765
I've nothing to lose.

490
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,802
I don't even have the guts to
talk against my brother-in-law.

491
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:19,268
Whatever he orders me
to do, I'll do it.

492
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:24,661
I'll do it.
Whatever he tells me to!

493
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:02,832
- Why did you lock the door?
- The door to my heart opened...

494
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:06,027
...that's why I shut this door.

495
01:11:09,871 --> 01:11:13,303
You bashed up my brother
I didn't feel angry at all.

496
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:15,804
In fact, I fell in love.

497
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:21,162
Your passionate outburst...
your strength...

498
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:25,433
Your manliness. I simply loved it!

499
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:31,394
And whatever Vaishali fancies...

500
01:11:34,204 --> 01:11:36,636
Vaishali makes sure she gets it!

501
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:50,865
I came to apologize because I was
asked to. But let alone a "Sorry"...

502
01:11:51,371 --> 01:11:53,234
...you are not worth talking to!

503
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:07,564
Have you returned apologizing
to that great woman?

504
01:12:09,571 --> 01:12:12,696
How long will you live
like some puppet?

505
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:15,632
Will you go on doing
whatever he tells you to?

506
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:26,660
Yes! I can do anything.

507
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:32,961
For my sister's sake even if
I'll have to risk my life...

508
01:12:34,338 --> 01:12:37,236
...I won't think twice. Know why?

509
01:12:38,338 --> 01:12:41,566
How will you know? Even Sister
doesn't know this secret.

510
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:45,871
When God brought my sister
into this world...

511
01:12:47,171 --> 01:12:52,126
He thought over it,
said, how did I err here?

512
01:12:53,838 --> 01:12:57,531
I've made this girl so simple,
and innocent...

513
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:03,668
How will she survive in the world?
He then sent me to earth...

514
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:06,664
...and said, "Look, Raju..."

515
01:13:08,171 --> 01:13:12,797
Stay with your Sister like a
shadow, be her guardian.

516
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:17,703
See that she doesn't
have to toil and sweat.

517
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:20,296
I've come in this world
with such a big responsibility.

518
01:13:21,738 --> 01:13:23,533
I was born for my sister.

519
01:13:26,237 --> 01:13:29,432
Jyoti, I can bear anything.

520
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:35,129
But I can't bear to see tears
in my sister's eyes. I can't!

521
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:53,901
- What if I take a peep?
Okay I won't. You can if you wish.

522
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,797
Look! That idiot is coming.

523
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:05,795
It's really very shameful.
Very shameful indeed!

524
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:12,231
That Raju, he beat up my man.
Like a dog, and humiliated me!

525
01:14:12,638 --> 01:14:15,536
- He's coming...
- And these village folks...

526
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:18,968
...they listened to all this
like some film story.

527
01:14:19,304 --> 01:14:22,134
If the one who was bashed up
isn't bothered, why should we?

528
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:28,301
How can I just forget you?
I'll choke him with my stick!

529
01:14:29,037 --> 01:14:32,162
My Gajendra's...
you've come?

530
01:14:33,438 --> 01:14:37,063
- I've not only come, but,
I've heard it too, - Don't mind...

531
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:40,902
He insulted you, and
my blood boiled!

532
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:46,435
- I got scalded!
- Forget that Raju.

533
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,494
That landlord Suraj Pratap...
Did he show them any respect?

534
01:14:52,004 --> 01:14:56,528
No! He's always coming at
night and going in the might.

535
01:14:57,037 --> 01:14:58,526
He comes and goes.

536
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:00,727
That too...
- Secretly.

537
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:05,328
- Did he go round the village
with Vaishali? - No.

538
01:15:05,705 --> 01:15:08,865
If I had been
in his place...

539
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:15,764
I'd have taken them around with great
regards to Vaishali and brother.

540
01:15:16,037 --> 01:15:19,094
And I'd have declared openly
that Vaishali is my world!

541
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:22,536
And this stud-bull here,
is my future brother-in-law!

542
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:26,528
Caretaker to my estate.
I'd have made Vaishali a mother...

543
01:15:26,937 --> 01:15:30,426
...and made this goon
my partner! - He has gone!

544
01:15:39,438 --> 01:15:42,461
Now it's my turn.
That landlord is in bad books!

545
01:15:45,571 --> 01:15:48,628
- What you're doing is bad.
- Meaning?

546
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:53,136
You come here, and go back
every night, on the sly...

547
01:15:53,638 --> 01:15:56,229
Have you even taken her
our for a ride, even once?

548
01:15:57,504 --> 01:16:01,630
She's eager to go out with you
but she feels shy to tell you.

549
01:16:02,237 --> 01:16:06,431
- Go on, Sister. Tell him.
- Forget it, brother.

550
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:11,632
If he roams around with me
his reputation will go to dogs.

551
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:16,363
That's not it. When the time
comes, I'll take her out for sure.

552
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:25,335
Hurry up!
He's waiting in the temple.

553
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:28,833
- You're always in a hurry.
- Come on, now. Hurry!

554
01:16:47,805 --> 01:16:50,998
See? He has come
without that Vaishali.

555
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:56,303
- Now he and her brother
will fight! - And she'll be yours!

556
01:16:57,104 --> 01:16:59,195
Don't laugh! The
Goddess will get scared.

557
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:04,629
- You came alone, sir?
- She's coming.

558
01:17:05,071 --> 01:17:09,867
- He said "She's coming".
Who's coming? - His wife.

559
01:17:12,738 --> 01:17:14,396
- What's the matter?
- Look over there.

560
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:29,730
We're here, Sir. Hey, Sister...

561
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,468
...stand here next to him

562
01:17:33,404 --> 01:17:34,369
Take this.

563
01:17:38,037 --> 01:17:40,765
Take this and start the prayers.

564
01:17:46,304 --> 01:17:49,963
- Vaishali, give it to him.
- Stop!

565
01:17:56,404 --> 01:17:59,302
This cloth will not be offered
to the Holy Mother! That's the one.

566
01:17:59,937 --> 01:18:04,960
- Take it and start. Come, Sister.
- Every cloth is the same to Mother.

567
01:18:05,904 --> 01:18:07,335
Today Vaishali will have the honor.

568
01:18:11,004 --> 01:18:14,493
- Whatever you are doing is wrong!
- Stop Raju! - Why should I?

569
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,327
I've always done whatever
he has asked me to do.

570
01:18:17,738 --> 01:18:23,466
He asked me to apologize to her
I did. And today, before my eyes...

571
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:26,302
...when my Sister is being insulted
so badly, I can't bear it.

572
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:33,065
Today, I'll not obey him.
In fact, he'll have to obey me!

573
01:18:34,937 --> 01:18:37,994
- You bite the very hard that
fed you? - It's true you fed me.

574
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:42,164
- That's why I'm stopping you.
- Who are you to stop me?

575
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:48,063
- Gajendra...
- Yes, Sir...

576
01:18:50,538 --> 01:18:54,436
- You dare step forward and
I'll cut you up! - Really?

577
01:18:55,638 --> 01:18:58,468
Do you have the guts?
Then go ahead and cut me up!

578
01:19:09,705 --> 01:19:12,603
What's this, Sir?
What's going on?

579
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:17,533
- It's none of your business!
Keep quiet! - Why should I?

580
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:22,362
You'll come to this Holy shrine
and fight. And we'll just watch?

581
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:28,003
- This is not your private matter.
- Agreed you're the patron here...

582
01:19:28,538 --> 01:19:32,402
But that doesn't mean you let this
fallen woman offer the prayers!

583
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:37,364
We won't allow it!
We won't let this happen.

584
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:43,727
Having such a pure and pious wife,
you come here with this whore?

585
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:46,032
We won't allow her to
offer prayers here!

586
01:19:54,738 --> 01:19:59,693
Comes to pray with Vaishali!
Great in name, petty in deeds.

587
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:51,167
Stop!
If you take another step...

588
01:20:52,337 --> 01:20:55,065
- Brother-in-law...
- What! Whose brother-in-law?

589
01:20:59,236 --> 01:21:01,169
You're just a servant
of this household.

590
01:21:09,504 --> 01:21:12,765
You had nothing to eat.
Nothing to wear.

591
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:18,536
I took pity on you, and,
gave you a place to stay here.

592
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:22,965
You forgot your manners?
Your status around here?

593
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:27,959
You insulted me in public?
You dared to do this?

594
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:30,967
- No... It's not like that.
- Don't say a word!

595
01:21:31,737 --> 01:21:34,602
Else, I'll kill you.
Now, get out of here!

596
01:21:39,737 --> 01:21:43,328
Okay. If that's how it's to be,
then send Jyoti with me.

597
01:21:46,571 --> 01:21:48,002
She can't live without me.

598
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,563
My sister, with you?
You scoundrel!

599
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:08,792
Jyoti, come with me.

600
01:22:15,236 --> 01:22:16,635
Where shall I go with you?

601
01:22:20,438 --> 01:22:24,927
Why should I come with you?
Who are you to order me?

602
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:27,500
I'm not your wife, you know.

603
01:22:29,037 --> 01:22:30,663
I'm your Master's sister!

604
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:38,067
Brother, this man has served us.
We fed him 3 times a day.

605
01:22:38,904 --> 01:22:43,893
I think that wasn't enough.
Give him some cash. He'll go!

606
01:22:52,538 --> 01:22:55,402
Hear that?
She's my sister!

607
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:09,137
Heard what your husband
said to me, sister?

608
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,693
He called me a servant
of this household.

609
01:23:17,203 --> 01:23:19,829
Am I really a servant here?

610
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:25,394
- Tell me, Sister. Am I a servant?
- Yes!

611
01:23:26,538 --> 01:23:28,730
You were a servant.
And he is the Master.

612
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:34,169
He kept you because your services
were needed. Today it's not so.

613
01:23:34,904 --> 01:23:39,893
That's why you're thrown out!
Didn't you hear what Jyoti said?

614
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:45,369
Why harbor dreams about her?
What's keeping you here?

615
01:23:49,104 --> 01:23:54,798
It was my fault. Just as things
are brought as a dowry...

616
01:23:55,804 --> 01:23:58,532
...I brought you along like that.

617
01:24:00,571 --> 01:24:05,127
I've been most unfair to you.
What haven't you done for us all?

618
01:24:06,104 --> 01:24:09,070
You toiled to your bones.
What award did you get?

619
01:24:09,804 --> 01:24:12,395
Why are you still standing
before me? Get going!

620
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:16,503
Forget this unfortunate sister!

621
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:23,035
Leave me to my lot.
And don't ever come here again.

622
01:24:24,203 --> 01:24:28,158
Now go away!
For God's sake, go Raju.

623
01:24:29,037 --> 01:24:30,366
Go, I say!

624
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:11,861
See Hira?
They threw me out of the house.

625
01:25:13,004 --> 01:25:17,629
I didn't mind that. But then
my own sister threw me out too!

626
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:22,968
I'm going now. But I'm going
with a big burden on you.

627
01:25:24,603 --> 01:25:27,728
Take care of my sister,
and her husband.

628
01:25:29,236 --> 01:25:32,794
Okay then. I'll go now.

629
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:47,135
Isn't there any difference between
men worth 70 acres and 700 acres?

630
01:25:48,738 --> 01:25:53,601
Gajendra, don't I have anything
better to do than play cards?

631
01:25:55,004 --> 01:25:59,936
- When will my 'inside' job be done?
- My sister is having a cold bath.

632
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:03,431
I think you stand
a chance this time!

633
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:21,230
- Come, son, eat something.
- No, Mom, sister must be...

634
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:33,096
After all that's happened.
You still pine for your Sister

635
01:26:34,004 --> 01:26:35,197
Silly boy!

636
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:40,667
Our son-in-law and Jyoti
have insulted you so badly.

637
01:26:42,004 --> 01:26:45,801
Anyway, they're not of our blood.
But your sister is, isn't she?

638
01:26:46,804 --> 01:26:50,633
She should've taken your side.
But she yelled at you instead!

639
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:52,562
Didn't you feel hurt?

640
01:26:55,470 --> 01:27:00,368
It wasn't just me who was hurt.
Sister must've been hurt too!

641
01:27:06,237 --> 01:27:10,999
Jyoti, I can endure anything,
but not my Sister's tears!

642
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,394
I just can't!

643
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:43,797
- What is it? - Do you know
what I've got for you? - What?

644
01:27:45,336 --> 01:27:47,894
But first keep your foot
on my Jeans. - Why?

645
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,963
- Go on, keep it.
- Okay.

646
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,759
- Silver anklets!
- There! I've put them on you.

647
01:28:00,403 --> 01:28:03,426
How lovely!
Now put the other one on too.

648
01:28:04,503 --> 01:28:05,731
Go on, put it on.

649
01:28:08,237 --> 01:28:12,101
- What is it, Raju?
- I've brought just one! - What!

650
01:28:12,536 --> 01:28:18,435
I had gone to the city and there
I saw this sparkling anklet.

651
01:28:19,104 --> 01:28:21,433
I went in the shop,
and asked its price.

652
01:28:22,004 --> 01:28:27,062
He said Rs. 400/-
Now, I had just Rs. 200/- on me.

653
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:32,160
Then I got an idea!
I kept the 200/- on the counter...

654
01:28:32,536 --> 01:28:36,662
...took the anklet and ran out!
- Why? - He can't sell one anklet!

655
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:42,096
Now, when I have he money,
I'll buy it and put it on you!

656
01:28:42,771 --> 01:28:46,634
- How do like my idea?
- I like it!

657
01:29:09,037 --> 01:29:12,969
You left me! Now have you
come to return my gift too?

658
01:29:14,037 --> 01:29:16,798
This is not the one you gave.
It's the anklet...

659
01:29:17,536 --> 01:29:22,525
...which you were to get for me.
I want you to put it on me

660
01:29:24,903 --> 01:29:27,994
A new act, eh? Aren't you satisfied
by insulting me that day?

661
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:36,063
This is no act.
What I did that day, was an act.

662
01:29:37,403 --> 01:29:41,267
I've come to apologize.
Seeing my brother's wrath then...

663
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:45,225
...and that sword, I got scared.
That's why I had to abuse you!

664
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:48,336
Tell me truthfully.
Did I do anything wrong?

665
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,735
No, you didn't.
You behaved the way...

666
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:58,630
...a master's sister should,
with an ordinary servant.

667
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,996
It's my fault.
I had crossed my limits.

668
01:30:04,603 --> 01:30:08,660
- Try to understand...
- I've understood everything.

669
01:30:09,803 --> 01:30:11,133
- No more.
- Raju...

670
01:30:20,436 --> 01:30:22,299
Was I wrong in doing
what I did then?

671
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:25,668
- No, my dear. You did right.
- No...

672
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:29,268
Don't cry like this. Look...

673
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:34,529
Dark clouds will go away.
The tears on your lashes will dry.

674
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:40,266
- It'll rain happiness... - When?
- That only time will tell.

675
01:30:44,436 --> 01:30:48,300
This girl is crying her eyes out
and you talk all nonsense?

676
01:30:49,004 --> 01:30:52,164
But what did I say?
I rightly said...

677
01:30:52,803 --> 01:30:57,667
- Time will tell what'll happen.
- Time, my foot! I'll decide!

678
01:30:58,104 --> 01:30:59,535
Come, my dear.

679
01:31:01,903 --> 01:31:04,391
- Where are you taking me?
- Just come with me.

680
01:31:05,704 --> 01:31:08,635
- What will we do here?
- Do you love Raju? - Yes!

681
01:31:09,004 --> 01:31:12,231
- Are you sure? - Yes.
- Then go drown!

682
01:31:14,004 --> 01:31:17,436
- Jyoti's drowning? Anyone there?
- Why did you push me?

683
01:31:18,203 --> 01:31:20,726
Go down in the water girl!
Pretend you are drowning.

684
01:31:22,803 --> 01:31:28,065
Raju! Jyoti's in the water!
It's going over her head!

685
01:31:28,637 --> 01:31:32,296
- Hurry up, son. She's drowning.
- I'm coming. Hold on.

686
01:31:33,203 --> 01:31:36,761
- Save her, son.
- I'll save her! I'll dive in...

687
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:40,393
- You will, eh?
- If you say so, dear...

688
01:31:41,004 --> 01:31:43,299
Trying to be young, eh?
Get aside!

689
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:48,066
You go under the water.
She's going...

690
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:52,696
Hey Raju... your Sister's
sister-in-law is drowning!

691
01:36:57,103 --> 01:37:00,467
I've signed the stamp paper.
Go and tell your brother...

692
01:37:01,203 --> 01:37:04,657
...and get my 20 acres of
mango-orchards done on your name.

693
01:37:12,136 --> 01:37:16,034
- Millu! Come here.
- What is it?

694
01:37:16,737 --> 01:37:23,135
See this! Suraj Pratap has signed
all his estate on my name.

695
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:28,793
You thought I was a fool, eh?
Now see what I do!

696
01:37:30,403 --> 01:37:34,358
What will be do?
Now we'll do something!

697
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:40,766
I'll fix it in such a way, that
Vaishali and the Thakur will split.

698
01:37:44,004 --> 01:37:47,560
Raju! We're in trouble...

699
01:37:48,036 --> 01:37:50,935
- It's time to decide!
- Gajendra has thrown us out!

700
01:37:51,569 --> 01:37:55,003
He says he's in-charge of your
brother-in-law's estate now!

701
01:37:55,535 --> 01:37:59,195
That where is the root of all this!
She's eating us all like a termite.

702
01:37:59,903 --> 01:38:04,995
And this won't stop here.
It'll continue to grow.

703
01:38:05,602 --> 01:38:10,433
First, because of her,
you were thrown out!

704
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:14,632
And today, these poor laborers
were evicted from their fields.

705
01:38:15,136 --> 01:38:18,899
If you continue to do nothing,
one day, your Sister...

706
01:38:19,336 --> 01:38:22,325
...and then Jyoti, will both
be shown the door too!

707
01:38:25,837 --> 01:38:29,064
- I'll kill them both!
- No, Raju.

708
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:34,261
Don't take such a drastic step.
We've to kill the foe with brains!

709
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:41,627
Yes! That Vaishali is
practicing prostitution!

710
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:46,267
You report to the police, and
she and her brother will be jailed.

711
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:48,665
And the whole village
will be rid of her!

712
01:38:50,236 --> 01:38:53,464
And your sister's home will
be saved from ruin.

713
01:38:58,569 --> 01:39:02,558
Today, your brother-in-law
has gone out of town.

714
01:39:03,136 --> 01:39:05,125
You won't get a better chance.

715
01:39:20,602 --> 01:39:23,763
- Police! Police!
- Get up, silly.

716
01:39:24,436 --> 01:39:27,959
- We were gambling for fun.
- We don't have the money for it.

717
01:39:28,303 --> 01:39:32,462
- Why are you here, Inspector?
- Look, Gajendra...

718
01:39:33,103 --> 01:39:37,467
...there's a complaint, that you're
forcing your sister in prostitution.

719
01:39:40,937 --> 01:39:42,492
Prostitution? In my house?

720
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:46,099
That's a dirty
allegation, Inspector.

721
01:39:48,669 --> 01:39:51,295
- But if you've a doubt, search
the place. - We will!

722
01:40:06,403 --> 01:40:09,960
- What is it?
- You are practicing prostitution!

723
01:40:10,469 --> 01:40:11,868
That's the complaint made.

724
01:40:16,003 --> 01:40:18,367
- Anybody else in there? Come out.
- Yes, come on out.

725
01:40:21,837 --> 01:40:23,495
What's the matter?
Why all the noise?

726
01:40:27,535 --> 01:40:31,161
So! It's you who's with her!

727
01:40:32,535 --> 01:40:35,730
- Arrest him, Constable.
- Arrest? Why?

728
01:40:36,136 --> 01:40:39,659
For being caught red-handed
with a prostitute!

729
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:44,161
- A prostitute? - Yes!
The one who wears your ring...

730
01:40:44,502 --> 01:40:46,661
...and lives with you,
is known as one's wife.

731
01:40:46,969 --> 01:40:51,526
But this kind of relationship
is known as an illicit relation.

732
01:40:52,936 --> 01:40:56,595
- You're insulting me because
of an old feud. - Why should I?

733
01:40:57,136 --> 01:40:59,431
To do that, there's your
dear brother-in-law here!

734
01:41:03,236 --> 01:41:08,168
Yes! He only complained that you
should be arrested for debauchery.

735
01:41:11,103 --> 01:41:15,035
No. I didn't even dream
that he'd be here tonight.

736
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:19,200
- I'll take my report back.
Finish this case here. - Why?

737
01:41:20,803 --> 01:41:23,666
Is the law for your brother-in-law
different from other people?

738
01:41:24,303 --> 01:41:27,201
The law is same for all.
Constable! Arrest him!

739
01:41:30,902 --> 01:41:33,959
When I take you around town
with handcuffs on your wrists...

740
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:38,132
...your wife will be cut to size.
Come here!

741
01:41:39,136 --> 01:41:42,659
- What are you waiting for?
- Stop!

742
01:42:09,535 --> 01:42:13,195
No! Listen to me. Don't do this
injustice to sister. I beg you.

743
01:42:13,636 --> 01:42:17,865
- Get lost!
- My sister's life will be ruined.

744
01:42:18,502 --> 01:42:20,525
You are the root of
all this! You!

745
01:42:55,837 --> 01:43:01,030
Didn't you say our relationship
was illicit without "Mangalsutra"?

746
01:43:02,269 --> 01:43:05,962
I've made it legal now.
What do you have to say now?

747
01:43:18,303 --> 01:43:21,133
Come on everybody. With
you all being here...

748
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:24,764
...my daughter is being
treated so callously.

749
01:43:25,236 --> 01:43:30,066
And you all keep quiet?
Nobody has the guts to question him?

750
01:43:30,869 --> 01:43:33,926
- Does he think he's not
answerable to anybody? - Mom!

751
01:43:35,036 --> 01:43:39,298
Shut up! What do you know?
How your sister must be suffering!

752
01:43:39,969 --> 01:43:43,366
Hey you, Richie Rich...
Come on out!

753
01:44:17,402 --> 01:44:23,097
Coming here like this at your age.
Gathering people and making noise.

754
01:44:23,969 --> 01:44:27,766
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Who should be ashamed, I say?

755
01:44:28,069 --> 01:44:30,228
The one who gave you her lovely
daughter in marriage...

756
01:44:30,602 --> 01:44:36,058
...or the one who illegally wedded
a whore on the sly? - Wrong!

757
01:44:37,069 --> 01:44:40,933
I married her in your son's
presence. Didn't he tell you?

758
01:44:41,535 --> 01:44:44,501
He did. That's why we're
here to question you.

759
01:44:45,969 --> 01:44:50,833
Where did my daughter err?
Which rule did she break?

760
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:54,267
Did she ever raise her voice
in your presence?

761
01:44:55,203 --> 01:44:58,965
She looked upon you as
God Almighty and served you.

762
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:02,860
How could you do such
enormous injustice to her?

763
01:45:03,836 --> 01:45:04,631
Enough!

764
01:45:07,802 --> 01:45:11,200
Just because I'm keeping quiet,
you can't go on raving like this!

765
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:17,326
- Son-in-law... - Really?
If you really cared about me...

766
01:45:18,036 --> 01:45:19,968
...would you have insulted
me like this?

767
01:45:22,669 --> 01:45:28,261
I've brought up your son.
If he truly cared for me...

768
01:45:28,869 --> 01:45:32,267
...would he have reported
against me to the police?

769
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:36,664
The people who, at one time,
didn't dare to stand before me...

770
01:45:37,269 --> 01:45:41,133
...you brought them all here?
Trampled my prestige?

771
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:44,968
A house, which couldn't even
afford a decent meal...

772
01:45:45,502 --> 01:45:49,434
I made an alliance with it.
Is this how you reward me?

773
01:45:50,502 --> 01:45:53,491
No! I don't want such relatives.

774
01:45:54,369 --> 01:45:58,301
I don't want such relations.
Our relation is over from today!

775
01:46:01,535 --> 01:46:04,763
- Sir, how can you say that?
- Shut up! It doesn't concern you.

776
01:46:06,236 --> 01:46:09,861
Didn't you say that day, that it
was not a private matter?

777
01:46:10,802 --> 01:46:15,393
Well, today it's a personal
matter. A private matter.

778
01:46:16,369 --> 01:46:20,995
Nobody need interfere in this.
Now go! Get out of here...

779
01:46:27,969 --> 01:46:31,401
Please forgive me.
I made a grave mistake.

780
01:46:35,336 --> 01:46:36,892
Your brother-in-law is dead!

781
01:46:43,036 --> 01:46:44,592
Your sister is a widow!

782
01:46:50,535 --> 01:46:52,092
All the bonds are broken!

783
01:46:57,702 --> 01:47:02,464
Now there's just one rite remaining.
When a woman becomes a widow...

784
01:47:03,236 --> 01:47:06,202
...her father gives her a
white sari to wear.

785
01:47:07,836 --> 01:47:12,461
Take this as that white sari,
and take your sister and get lost!

786
01:47:25,635 --> 01:47:28,363
I admit that I've committed
a grave mistake.

787
01:47:29,903 --> 01:47:33,027
But don't punish my sister for it.

788
01:47:34,236 --> 01:47:37,861
I'll leave right now.
And never come back.

789
01:47:41,303 --> 01:47:44,700
But, this sari...
With my own hands...

790
01:47:46,369 --> 01:47:48,164
...how can I... to my sister?

791
01:47:49,869 --> 01:47:54,131
Brother-in-law...
Sister! Sister!

792
01:47:54,502 --> 01:47:55,763
Make him understand.

793
01:47:56,669 --> 01:48:02,499
If you love your people more than
you love me, then you may go.

794
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:08,432
But if you wish to remain my wife
then take that sari and come in.

795
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:14,034
Also! You'll never go to your
parents house again!

796
01:48:14,902 --> 01:48:18,096
Nor go to their village,
or even utter their name!

797
01:48:19,136 --> 01:48:22,227
Think hard and decide.
Come, Jyoti. Come along!

798
01:48:38,303 --> 01:48:42,030
What's the point in
staying here now?

799
01:48:43,569 --> 01:48:45,898
Come, my dear. Let's go home.

800
01:48:53,336 --> 01:48:56,325
A girl leaves her parents'
home in a palaquin.

801
01:48:57,069 --> 01:48:59,092
...and leaves her husband's
home on a bier!

802
01:49:00,369 --> 01:49:02,766
That's the only journey a
woman takes in her lifetime.

803
01:49:05,702 --> 01:49:08,964
Her honor lies in staying at her
husband's home as his wife.

804
01:49:12,368 --> 01:49:14,391
I can't come with you.

805
01:49:16,702 --> 01:49:18,066
Forgive me, please.

806
01:49:32,136 --> 01:49:33,624
What kind of a justice is this?

807
01:49:39,102 --> 01:49:43,363
- Come, Father...
- Widow's weeds?

808
01:49:45,269 --> 01:49:47,393
Widow's weeds for her?

809
01:49:48,169 --> 01:49:51,101
Let's go. Let's go from here.

810
01:49:55,735 --> 01:49:58,293
No, no! Listen to me, please.

811
01:50:00,336 --> 01:50:05,996
You're uprooting such a long life
for that slut Vaishali?

812
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:13,292
Anyway, it's your funeral.
Since you're bent on it, Amen!

813
01:50:14,102 --> 01:50:17,262
Hey Millu!
I've just had a brain-wave.

814
01:50:18,902 --> 01:50:23,096
Look, your life has been
a waste anyway.

815
01:50:24,069 --> 01:50:26,863
But I won't let
your corpse go waste.

816
01:50:27,969 --> 01:50:31,163
I'll take it to
a Government hospital.

817
01:50:32,136 --> 01:50:37,068
I'll donate your eyes to someone.
And your heart to another.

818
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:40,967
Even your kidneys to somebody.
And also your... No!

819
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:44,363
That is totally useless.
Nobody will accept it.

820
01:50:45,802 --> 01:50:50,996
I'll donate every part of your
body with my own hands.

821
01:50:51,868 --> 01:50:54,131
Don't you worry.
But die in a hurry!

822
01:50:54,868 --> 01:51:02,393
What's this? So much time,
for such a small job?

823
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:04,992
One shouldn't waste time.
I'll fix...

824
01:51:06,136 --> 01:51:10,329
...this noose for you.
It'll hold.

825
01:51:11,203 --> 01:51:14,691
Right. This is your correct size.

826
01:51:16,769 --> 01:51:20,224
By giving me a 3rd rate idea...

827
01:51:20,702 --> 01:51:24,327
...you forced that Thakur
to marry my Vaishali?

828
01:51:25,435 --> 01:51:28,333
You'll send my body to
a Government hospital, eh?

829
01:51:30,002 --> 01:51:33,729
I'll not send your rotting
body to a hospital.

830
01:51:34,569 --> 01:51:36,398
I'll throw it in a gutter instead.

831
01:51:38,835 --> 01:51:42,269
Crows and kites
will eat your eyes!

832
01:51:42,902 --> 01:51:46,595
And your tongue will be
chewed by a black dog!

833
01:51:47,936 --> 01:51:51,333
- And what about my brain?
- Brain? You don't have one!

834
01:51:52,036 --> 01:51:55,468
Watch. I'll put some sense
in your head. Watch!

835
01:52:01,736 --> 01:52:08,828
Pooja! My dear daughter.

836
01:52:09,401 --> 01:52:14,459
Pooja... dear child.

837
01:52:15,702 --> 01:52:16,725
Father!

838
01:52:18,002 --> 01:52:19,059
Father!

839
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:20,732
Stop, Pooja! You'll never step
in your parental home again.

840
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:24,627
You won't go to their village,
nor utter their name!

841
01:53:25,803 --> 01:53:27,358
Think very hard and decide.

842
01:53:54,935 --> 01:53:57,561
Is anybody else expected
for a final goodbye?

843
01:54:06,102 --> 01:54:07,261
She hasn't come.

844
01:54:09,169 --> 01:54:12,692
It's getting late. It's better
we don't wait any longer.

845
01:54:19,468 --> 01:54:22,367
You took her name
till your last breath.

846
01:54:23,468 --> 01:54:26,593
But she didn't even come
to bid you a final farewell.

847
01:54:36,568 --> 01:54:40,864
Father! O, Father!

848
01:54:41,136 --> 01:54:42,601
I've come, Father...

849
01:54:54,702 --> 01:54:57,997
Father! I've come, father.

850
01:55:03,202 --> 01:55:06,827
- Forgive me, father.
- Listen.

851
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:10,125
Remove the wood from his face.
Let her see him once.

852
01:55:10,568 --> 01:55:15,000
It's written that once the wood
is placed, it can't be removed.

853
01:55:15,668 --> 01:55:18,963
A daughter has come to see
her father for the last time.

854
01:55:20,035 --> 01:55:23,832
Why talk of scriptures?
Please remove the wood.

855
01:55:24,802 --> 01:55:26,268
Let her see him.

856
01:55:39,635 --> 01:55:43,658
Look, my dear. See your
father for the last time.

857
01:55:46,702 --> 01:55:50,498
He's gone! He left me
alone and went away.

858
01:56:39,934 --> 01:56:43,866
Son, a person who does the
last rites is presented...

859
01:56:44,202 --> 01:56:49,566
...with a new cloth from his
sister's house to ward off evil.

860
01:56:50,302 --> 01:56:51,562
Has that cloth come?

861
01:56:58,568 --> 01:57:01,897
That cloth will never come.
Better carry on with the rites.

862
01:57:05,868 --> 01:57:06,856
Immerse this, son.

863
01:58:49,102 --> 01:58:52,159
- Accept it, Raju.
- Yes, take it.

864
01:59:09,602 --> 01:59:12,965
I awaited March most eagerly.
Now will I be an April-fool?

865
01:59:13,435 --> 01:59:18,458
Why do you fret so? You'll
get my sister for sure?

866
01:59:18,768 --> 01:59:23,258
When? When I'm gone?
Will she dance on my grave?

867
01:59:30,402 --> 01:59:31,992
It's my turn to dance for now.

868
01:59:36,668 --> 01:59:39,792
If you sit in the sun
you'll get dark. Come on.

869
01:59:41,335 --> 01:59:43,563
Mind your tongue.
I'll break your jaw!

870
01:59:44,102 --> 01:59:47,931
- Break my jaw, but not my heart.
- Why do you waste time?

871
01:59:48,335 --> 01:59:51,392
- Just pull her and dump her
in the jeep! - Let me go!

872
02:00:53,235 --> 02:00:58,429
How dare you touch Jyoti!
She's my would-be wife.

873
02:05:58,435 --> 02:06:03,059
- Is what you're saying the truth?
- Yes, sir.

874
02:06:04,035 --> 02:06:08,091
I swear on my sister's head.
Raju abused you most filthily.

875
02:06:08,567 --> 02:06:11,692
And he respects you so much
that his blood boiled.

876
02:06:12,368 --> 02:06:15,697
But that scoundrel Raju,
beat him into a pulp!

877
02:06:18,268 --> 02:06:20,665
Not only that. He has
challenged you, that...

878
02:06:21,101 --> 02:06:25,624
...he'll marry your sister!
- Hey softie...

879
02:06:26,301 --> 02:06:30,630
- Tell him everything he said.
- I can't!

880
02:06:31,067 --> 02:06:32,931
I'll tell him then. I'm
not a coward. Sir...

881
02:06:33,402 --> 02:06:38,629
He said even if you interfere
in their love affair...

882
02:06:39,101 --> 02:06:41,726
...he won't think twice
to chop you to pieces!

883
02:06:46,634 --> 02:06:50,294
Jyoti will marry you!

884
02:06:51,634 --> 02:06:53,157
Tomorrow you'll be betrothed.

885
02:06:54,402 --> 02:07:00,630
- Coming... - Pooja...
- What is it?

886
02:07:01,402 --> 02:07:03,231
Today Jyoti is getting betrothed.

887
02:07:04,834 --> 02:07:07,595
Get her ready and bring her down!

888
02:07:18,468 --> 02:07:22,729
- My respects, sir. - Be seated.
- Sit down everyone.

889
02:07:33,634 --> 02:07:36,499
What's going on, Brother?

890
02:07:38,201 --> 02:07:42,258
- You're getting engaged to Gajendra.
- Engaged? Without telling me?

891
02:07:43,567 --> 02:07:47,624
In our family we don't seek
the girl's opinion about marriage!

892
02:07:48,067 --> 02:07:52,000
You'll have to change all that
now. I'll never agree to it!

893
02:07:53,901 --> 02:07:57,856
- I'll marry only Raju!
- Stop this nonsense!

894
02:07:59,368 --> 02:08:01,799
Don't utter that
ungrateful boy's name.

895
02:08:03,368 --> 02:08:08,095
I hate him many times more
than I love you!

896
02:08:09,034 --> 02:08:12,626
- But that won't lessen my love
for him! - What was that?

897
02:08:13,768 --> 02:08:18,201
Stop it! Whatever you've
done to me till today...

898
02:08:18,834 --> 02:08:24,494
...l've endured it. But if
anyone does injustice to her...

899
02:08:25,067 --> 02:08:27,727
...I won't keep quiet.
- What will you do?

900
02:08:28,934 --> 02:08:33,093
- I won't allow this marriage!
- With what right?

901
02:08:34,968 --> 02:08:40,333
- The right of a mother's love!
- Are you the only one who loves her?

902
02:08:40,868 --> 02:08:43,300
- Don't I love my sister?
- If you had an iota of love...

903
02:08:43,667 --> 02:08:48,861
...would you have fixed this?
Did you ask our opinion about it?

904
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:56,024
Did you ever think what we undergo
because of your decisions?

905
02:08:57,801 --> 02:09:01,256
What haven't you done, by letting
your temper get the better of you?

906
02:09:02,734 --> 02:09:06,995
I lost my very dear brother.
I didn't say anything.

907
02:09:08,701 --> 02:09:11,895
You hurt my parents so badly!
I kept quiet.

908
02:09:13,534 --> 02:09:18,194
But I won't keep silent today.
Because it doesn't concern me.

909
02:09:19,101 --> 02:09:25,398
It concerns Jyoti's life, and
I'll never give her to this butcher!

910
02:09:25,901 --> 02:09:28,765
- You call me a butcher?
- You shut up! Listen...

911
02:09:29,168 --> 02:09:34,328
This man is a rascal! A man
who sells his sister...

912
02:09:34,701 --> 02:09:38,861
...can make his wife a slut too!
Do you wish...

913
02:09:39,201 --> 02:09:40,928
...that tomorrow your sister
also becomes a prostitute?

914
02:09:47,467 --> 02:09:52,366
A man who sells his own sister,
will make his wife a prostitute!

915
02:09:53,067 --> 02:09:55,261
You want your sister to
become a prostitute?

916
02:10:06,868 --> 02:10:11,732
Listen. The whole village
looks up to you in reverence.

917
02:10:13,933 --> 02:10:16,661
You've given shelter
to a lot of lives.

918
02:10:18,567 --> 02:10:21,590
Don't turn your innocent
sister's life into devastation.

919
02:10:23,933 --> 02:10:26,230
Don't let anger force you to
take a wrong decision...

920
02:10:26,734 --> 02:10:29,961
...which will make us repent
all our lives.

921
02:10:31,467 --> 02:10:35,264
Sir, this woman's just blabbering.
Why listen to her?

922
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,433
We are getting late.
Start the betrothal ceremony.

923
02:10:40,034 --> 02:10:42,500
- Come, sir. You too, girl.
- Gajendra!

924
02:10:45,235 --> 02:10:47,427
How dare you touch my sister?

925
02:10:48,901 --> 02:10:52,799
If you stay here a minute more,
I'll kill you! Now get out!

926
02:10:55,335 --> 02:10:57,698
See? I was right, wasn't I?

927
02:10:58,667 --> 02:11:04,225
Sir, if anybody has to leave
this place, it's you. Not me!

928
02:11:05,434 --> 02:11:08,696
- This house is mine now!
- I'll kill you!

929
02:11:13,101 --> 02:11:15,294
No! No! Don't, brother.

930
02:11:20,667 --> 02:11:23,098
- No! No, please.
- Let me go!

931
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:27,094
Prancing about, isn't he?
You'll shoot us all, eh?

932
02:11:27,768 --> 02:11:33,530
Go on, shoot! I'll get you too!

933
02:11:34,734 --> 02:11:38,893
I'm Millu, remember.
I always knew it...

934
02:11:39,601 --> 02:11:43,364
...that you'll create a ruckus.
So I also brought the papers.

935
02:11:43,967 --> 02:11:46,627
Look! This is a stamp paper.

936
02:11:47,101 --> 02:11:51,430
In it you've stated that all
your estate is Gajendra now.

937
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:58,129
And you're turning him out?

938
02:11:59,501 --> 02:12:05,024
Hey, you literate Headman.
Come here and read this.

939
02:12:11,067 --> 02:12:15,897
It states that all your wealth,
property, now belongs to Gajendra.

940
02:12:17,101 --> 02:12:22,431
It's written here very clearly
that he's the owner now.

941
02:12:22,768 --> 02:12:25,200
Make him understand this.

942
02:12:26,701 --> 02:12:29,633
Did you hear?
Now get lost from here!

943
02:12:30,567 --> 02:12:33,829
Such treason! I won't spare you.

944
02:12:34,601 --> 02:12:39,397
- Don't do that.
- It's all Vaishali's fault.

945
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,864
- I won't let her get away.
- No, don't... - Listen to me.

946
02:12:45,401 --> 02:12:47,334
Whatever has happened...
for God's sake just forget it

947
02:12:47,701 --> 02:12:51,190
We want only you, not
this wealth and estate.

948
02:12:52,401 --> 02:12:55,492
- Are you listening? Let's go.
- Come, brother. - Let's go.

949
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:04,697
- This house is ours now.
- What a magnificent house!

950
02:13:56,168 --> 02:14:00,065
- Sister! O, Sister!
- Raju...

951
02:14:03,601 --> 02:14:06,465
Why are you weeping, sister?
I'm here for you.

952
02:14:11,867 --> 02:14:24,563
Come, brother-in-law.
All will be fine.

953
02:14:30,801 --> 02:14:33,426
- O Mom!
- Dear child...

954
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:41,458
Son-in-law! Please come in.

955
02:14:43,701 --> 02:14:46,098
Please forgive me.

956
02:14:47,867 --> 02:14:53,061
Don't say that, son.
That was just a bad phase.

957
02:14:54,135 --> 02:14:57,101
It's over now. My daughter
got you back...

958
02:14:57,534 --> 02:15:00,022
...l'm very content.
Please come in.

959
02:15:03,334 --> 02:15:05,664
Sit down please. Jyoti,
get some water.

960
02:15:06,334 --> 02:15:10,891
Raju, come here.
Please be seated.

961
02:15:14,401 --> 02:15:18,424
There's nothing in the house, so
I'm going. Look after them.

962
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,628
- Okay. Don't you worry.
- Take care.

963
02:15:51,367 --> 02:15:53,390
Raju! Wait, son.

964
02:15:54,467 --> 02:15:56,524
My God!

965
02:16:00,434 --> 02:16:03,128
- Pooja... - Yes Mom?
- Raju has taken a big sickle...

966
02:16:03,601 --> 02:16:07,055
- I think he'll kill Vaishali.
- Hush, Mom.

967
02:16:07,501 --> 02:16:11,456
If he hears, there'll be trouble.
I'll go and get Raju.

968
02:16:16,434 --> 02:16:19,991
Shut up! You threw
that great man out?

969
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,289
How dare you!

970
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,960
Prostitutes don't talk
about morality.

971
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:33,234
Even though I was a fallen
woman he married me.

972
02:16:34,101 --> 02:16:36,895
Having a wife at home, he
gave me the status of a wife.

973
02:16:37,833 --> 02:16:41,425
I can never pay him back
for this obligation.

974
02:16:42,101 --> 02:16:47,465
Sister, we conned many people.
He was one of them. So what?

975
02:16:50,234 --> 02:16:53,098
We never met a man
like him before.

976
02:16:54,567 --> 02:16:58,294
Had I met anyone like
him in the beginning...

977
02:16:59,767 --> 02:17:01,995
I'd not be a prostitute!

978
02:17:03,201 --> 02:17:08,656
I'll return all his papers,
and beg his forgiveness.

979
02:17:09,667 --> 02:17:17,157
Come on, sister. You really
took your marriage seriously, eh?

980
02:17:17,967 --> 02:17:18,830
Let go of me!

981
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,728
Sister, he tied this little
black thread in your neck...

982
02:17:28,034 --> 02:17:31,592
Put a pinch of vermilion on
you, and you became totally his?

983
02:17:33,467 --> 02:17:35,296
You've become very dangerous.

984
02:17:37,634 --> 02:17:42,498
That man had threatened
to kill you in public.

985
02:17:44,767 --> 02:17:49,496
Now I'll kill you, and
he'll get arrested.

986
02:18:22,267 --> 02:18:23,960
That woman's escaping. Catch her!

987
02:18:25,967 --> 02:18:29,491
That Raju's after your life.
Our men stopped him...

988
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,457
...but he started
beating everybody!

989
02:19:38,101 --> 02:19:41,498
Your brother-in-law is arrested
for the murder of Vaishali.

990
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:51,394
Hello... Anybody home?

991
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:54,198
Bad news, my dear! On a
charge of Vaishali's murder...

992
02:19:54,467 --> 02:19:56,796
...they arrested your husband!
- What!

993
02:19:58,501 --> 02:20:01,228
No, Mom. He didn't murder her.

994
02:20:04,634 --> 02:20:07,099
Where are you going, dear?
Stop her, Jyoti.

995
02:20:12,134 --> 02:20:18,260
Inspector... Please release him.

996
02:20:19,267 --> 02:20:23,665
What! Release him?
Are you crazy?

997
02:20:24,434 --> 02:20:31,356
That man inside has killed
a dancer by the name of Vaishali.

998
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,091
No, sir.
He didn't kill her. I did!

999
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,126
He had hit me! Now he's trapped.

1000
02:20:46,034 --> 02:20:48,398
This time I'll beat
the breath out of him.

1001
02:20:50,434 --> 02:20:54,423
- Constable! - Yes?
- Release that man.

1002
02:20:55,434 --> 02:20:56,763
And lock this one up.

1003
02:21:12,666 --> 02:21:14,257
Why did you murder her?

1004
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,160
You're so matured. Why did
you kill Vaishali?

1005
02:21:22,534 --> 02:21:25,795
Well son, why did you do this?

1006
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:31,166
So that you and sister can
live happily ever after.

1007
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,296
Where is she going? Stop her!

1008
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:01,223
Stop my dear, stop!

1009
02:22:06,099 --> 02:22:07,861
- Can you hear me?
- Hey, brother...

1010
02:22:11,334 --> 02:22:14,959
- Let go of me?
- Where have they brought us?

1011
02:22:25,700 --> 02:22:33,861
Let go of my daughter.
Let go, I say!

1012
02:22:42,401 --> 02:22:46,992
- Hello! How was the journey?
- No trouble enroute, I hope.

1013
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:51,798
- Don't laugh! Let us go, I say!
- Shut up, you old hag!

1014
02:22:52,134 --> 02:22:55,691
- Else I'll throttle you.
- Throttle me, my foot!

1015
02:22:56,167 --> 02:22:59,031
If my son comes to know.
He'll mince you!

1016
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:04,662
May you rot away!
May maggots eat you!

1017
02:23:05,134 --> 02:23:08,725
May you gasp and die of thirst.
May you sprout skin disease.

1018
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,995
- May you die issueless!
- May you be born as a pig!

1019
02:23:12,867 --> 02:23:16,060
May your corpse be kicked by dogs
and eaten by crows and kites.

1020
02:23:16,401 --> 02:23:19,231
May you have kids who are
lame, blind and bald.

1021
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:24,792
May you go to dogs in next birth...
Of course I'm not saying all this.

1022
02:23:25,167 --> 02:23:27,463
It's what this old hag
wishes to say!

1023
02:23:28,367 --> 02:23:32,322
Had she said this long
dialogue in one breath...

1024
02:23:32,733 --> 02:23:37,029
...she'd have died and stopped
the wedding. That's why I said it.

1025
02:23:39,099 --> 02:23:44,031
If she starts off again
I'll join her. Don't mind.

1026
02:23:44,401 --> 02:23:46,832
Let him speak, else
the wedding will be held up.

1027
02:23:47,134 --> 02:23:55,055
Dear old hag, I mean... where did
you learn such vintage abuse?

1028
02:23:55,900 --> 02:23:57,923
- In which school?
- The one your father attended!

1029
02:23:59,066 --> 02:24:07,693
No tantrums now, dear bride.
I had come at your door to wed you.

1030
02:24:08,234 --> 02:24:13,257
But you created chaos!
Now I'll wed you forcibly.

1031
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,796
Aren't you ashamed to force
yourself on a girl?

1032
02:24:18,467 --> 02:24:22,490
Shamelessness is in their genes.
I was just mouthing her thoughts.

1033
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,462
- Now don't interrupt. Else
I'll suffocate you! - Great!

1034
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:30,496
Why should I get blamed? Why
will I open my mouth?

1035
02:24:32,733 --> 02:24:34,562
- No!
- Hey you mad girl...

1036
02:24:35,334 --> 02:24:39,323
Do you think he's marrying you
to take you on a honeymoon?

1037
02:24:39,833 --> 02:24:43,890
No! This sister-in-law of yours...

1038
02:24:44,234 --> 02:24:50,189
...who goes on jabbering all day.
It's to shut her trap.

1039
02:24:51,633 --> 02:24:54,497
Well, jabber now
dear sister-in-law.

1040
02:24:55,234 --> 02:24:59,495
How you ran with these 2, to the
police station to report!

1041
02:25:00,999 --> 02:25:05,489
Run now. Go on. But
the time is passing.

1042
02:25:06,633 --> 02:25:09,827
First let him put this symbol
of marriage round her neck.

1043
02:25:10,267 --> 02:25:13,562
Let him be your son-in-law,
then go and make a report.

1044
02:25:14,066 --> 02:25:15,657
Two birds with one stone.

1045
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:23,894
He'll get hanged and your lovely
Jyoti will have no husband.

1046
02:25:24,566 --> 02:25:27,657
She'll be a widow,
like this rotten hag here.

1047
02:25:29,367 --> 02:25:32,231
Why are you standing around?
Put that thing round her neck.

1048
02:25:33,334 --> 02:25:37,959
- No! - Jyoti.
No... let me go!

1049
02:27:55,733 --> 02:27:59,756
Vaishali was murdered by her
own brother, not my husband.

1050
02:28:01,733 --> 02:28:06,825
In the temple on the hill, Gajendra
is forcibly marrying Jyoti.

1051
02:28:07,999 --> 02:28:10,931
Wherever you are,
come and save us.

1052
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:22,860
My husband's in severe trouble.

1053
02:28:24,767 --> 02:28:30,200
- Mom and Jyoti are also...
- Cut that wire and get her!

1054
02:28:30,767 --> 02:28:40,564
- Hurry! Come quickly.
- Shut that door!

1055
02:30:02,433 --> 02:30:04,831
- Talk over the microphone eh?
- Wonderful! Great!

1056
02:30:05,466 --> 02:30:09,263
First your husband was to kill
us all! Look, we're dead!

1057
02:30:09,833 --> 02:30:11,957
And now your brother will
come and break our bones!

1058
02:30:12,433 --> 02:30:17,298
Now hurry up and put that
necklace round her neck!

1059
02:30:17,932 --> 02:30:22,195
- Go get that necklace from there.
- How can I get it?

1060
02:30:22,832 --> 02:30:26,424
It fell in a snake-hole.
I think they got married.

1061
02:30:26,966 --> 02:30:31,661
- And now they have a baby
too, I suppose? - Baby...

1062
02:30:34,733 --> 02:30:37,460
Why get another one?
There's one right here.

1063
02:30:42,999 --> 02:30:47,160
Great! What an eye-sight.
Right on the target.

1064
02:30:47,932 --> 02:30:50,330
Snatch from her, and grab her!

1065
02:30:56,466 --> 02:30:59,057
You wretch! Don't
you touch my daughter.

1066
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:01,325
The Holy Mother won't spare you.

1067
02:31:25,366 --> 02:31:28,093
It slipped from my hands.
Look over there.

1068
02:32:54,899 --> 02:32:57,661
Why are you twisting her wrist?
Go and break his bones.

1069
02:32:59,466 --> 02:33:00,795
I'll break your bones now.

1070
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:19,097
- Got bashed?
- Not at all.

1071
02:33:19,832 --> 02:33:22,594
- Then how did you fall?
- What happened was...

1072
02:33:23,066 --> 02:33:27,862
...there was a banana peel there.
I slipped on it and fell.

1073
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:34,094
But I just saw a young girl
and a beautiful old woman...

1074
02:33:34,732 --> 02:33:37,755
...beating you like a pile
of clothes. - That was Jyoti...

1075
02:33:38,167 --> 02:33:41,724
...and that rotten old hag
and that coy coquette...

1076
02:33:42,134 --> 02:33:46,031
They all begged and
asked for forgiveness.

1077
02:34:10,932 --> 02:34:16,331
Don't kill him. Just shower
your choicest abuses.

1078
02:34:17,566 --> 02:34:21,089
- He'll die right here.
- You worm from a gutter...

1079
02:34:21,633 --> 02:34:25,087
...may you be infested
with maggots which have rotted.

1080
02:34:46,233 --> 02:34:50,222
Enough. He can't live
with those abuses.

1081
02:34:56,799 --> 02:34:58,595
See? He really has gone nuts!

1082
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:22,729
Kill!

1083
02:36:24,966 --> 02:36:27,455
I'll do whatever he tells me to.

1084
02:37:16,466 --> 02:37:19,693
- Stop Raju! Else I'll shoot.
- No, Inspector.

1085
02:37:20,566 --> 02:37:23,498
My brother didn't murder Vaishali.
This Gajendra killed her.

1086
02:37:23,799 --> 02:37:29,027
I'm an eye witness to it.
I'll even tell this in the court.

1087
02:37:29,866 --> 02:37:32,128
But arrest him. He's the murderer.

1088
02:37:37,566 --> 02:37:38,497
Don't come any further.

1089
02:37:42,433 --> 02:37:44,558
Will you stay alive to stand
as a witness in the court?

1090
02:37:48,466 --> 02:37:49,863
You're alright, aren't you?

1091
02:38:08,599 --> 02:38:19,692
It's all right. I just
felt a bit dizzy.

1092
02:38:23,366 --> 02:38:26,593
Don't cry, Jyoti. Nothing
will happen to your Raju.

1093
02:38:28,199 --> 02:38:32,063
We'll give them a grand wedding.
And very soon too!

1094
02:38:38,932 --> 02:38:42,023
I'll do all this.
Go and send Raju in.

1095
02:38:42,899 --> 02:38:47,332
- You're in a hurry, aren't you?
- Today's girls are like this. Go!

1096
02:38:49,766 --> 02:38:51,494
Raju, go inside.

1097
02:39:04,366 --> 02:39:09,264
- Mom, tell him!
- Go in, son.

1098
02:39:10,732 --> 02:39:11,857
No I won't.

1099
02:39:14,333 --> 02:39:15,662
He's my brother-in-law!

1100
02:39:16,266 --> 02:39:20,664
Whatever he tells me to do...
