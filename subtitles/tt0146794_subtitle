1
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,700
Gangaram. Have you put
tea in thermos or not?

2
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,700
Yes, madam.
- Good.

3
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,020
Ok, mother, shall I go now?
- You are leaving..

4
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,860
..without having your breakfast?

5
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,260
Come and have your breakfast.

6
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,420
I have prepared
Kachoris for you. Come.

7
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,220
I don't have the time for breakfast.

8
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,220
Ravi will come at 7 O' clock.
- Let him come.

9
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,460
He will also eat a
couple of them. Come. Come.

10
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,700
You are such a nice girl. Ganga,
bring hot Kachoris.

11
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,180
Sit down, dear. You
shouldn't go out with empty-stomach.

12
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,380
I have also prepared Kheer for you.

13
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,860
Now have a couple of hot
Kachoris from my hand.

14
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,980
Ravi is here. I am leaving.

15
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,100
Lakshmi, at least have your
breakfast. - I am too late.

16
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,420
Lakshmi.. - My college
mates will scold me. Tata!

17
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,220
This girl is such a..
Ganga, bring a box.

18
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,740
I am coming. Why are
you shouting so much?

19
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,180
I thought that
princess is still sleeping.

20
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,460
I am sleeping and you are awake?
- Yes.

21
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,860
Mister, you are three
and half minutes late.

22
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,340
What did you say!
- You are always late.

23
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,820
Miss, have a look at the
watch and then talk to me.

24
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,278
Look here. Just look here.
It's only 3 min. and 14 seconds.

25
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,540
Your watch is lazy just like you.

26
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,260
I am lazy? Miss,
just look at yourself.

27
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,620
You didn't even wash your face.

28
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,500
Last night meal is stuck on your face.

29
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Mother's watching.

30
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,900
You deceiver!
- Thanks for the compliments.

31
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,940
You are here, son.
- Greetings, aunt.

32
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,820
God bless you, son. Lakshmi, I
have put the Kachoris in this.

33
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,740
Mother, I don't have a place for that.

34
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,500
Give it to me, aunty. I have
a lot of place. - Ok, son.

35
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,220
Ok, mother, tata.
- Ok, dear. Be careful.

36
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,740
You don't worry at all.

37
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,260
"This is the weather of life
and this climate is mesmerizing."

38
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,820
"Come, let's turn these
moments into lovely gardens."

39
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,300
"This is the weather of life
and this climate is mesmerizing."

40
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,860
"Come, let's turn these
moments into lovely gardens."

41
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,580
"This is the weather of life.."

42
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,660
"This dancing breeze and
these sights of love."

43
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,100
"This dancing breeze and
these sights of love."

44
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,740
"I wish someone would
call me in such weather."

45
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,420
"I wish someone would
call me in such weather."

46
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,660
"..in such weather."

47
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,260
"My heart went crazy
in this weather.."

48
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,980
"..come, let's turn these
moments into lovely gardens."

49
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,500
"This is the weather of life
and this climate is mesmerizing."

50
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,140
"Come, let's turn these
moments into lovely gardens."

51
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,860
"This is the weather of life.."

52
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,540
"The eyes are wandering at
these wonderful sights."

53
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,260
"The eyes are wandering at
these wonderful sights."

54
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,900
"Those who enjoy
nature are enjoying nature."

55
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,580
"Those who enjoy
nature are enjoying nature."

56
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,900
"..are enjoying nature."

57
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,340
"Somewhere the eyes are hunters.."

58
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,700
"..and somewhere the
heart is the prey."

59
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,340
"..come, let's turn these
moments into lovely gardens."

60
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,980
"This is the weather of life
and this climate is mesmerizing."

61
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,580
"Come, let's turn these
moments into lovely gardens."

62
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,380
"This is the weather of life.."

63
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,200
"..Lakshmi has settled in my heart."

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:21,512
"..Lakshmi has settled in my heart."

65
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:23,842
"..in my heart."

66
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:26,951
"..in my heart."

67
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:30,062
"..in my heart."

68
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,718
What are you doing!
- Daddy, do not disturb me.

69
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,810
I am thinking about Lakshmi.

70
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,490
You will keep on thinking about it..

71
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,210
..and someone else will take her away.

72
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,370
Madam has given Ravi and
Lakshmi so much freedom..

73
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,290
..as if they are about
to get married. - What!

74
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,710
Lakshmi and Ravi's marriage?
That will never happen.

75
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,310
Lakshmi is in my hands.
- You fool, only the photo..

76
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,150
..will be left in your hands.

77
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,270
I have been dreaming
since many years..

78
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,790
..that some day Lakshmi
will get married to you..

79
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,830
..and their property
worth lakhs will be ours.

80
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,630
But today I felt like Ravi
will shatter all ours dreams.

81
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,350
Ravi? I have a plan for Ravi.
- What's that plan?

82
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,990
It's a simple plan. Ravi
himself told this to me..

83
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,070
..that his father is
a very old-world man.

84
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,390
I will write a letter to
that old man that Ravi is..

85
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,190
..getting married to a
girl of another caste.

86
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,830
See what happens then.
- What are you staring at?

87
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,212
Write the letter right now.
- Right now?

88
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,143
Yes, right now. Come.
- Daddy, my fish.

89
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,660
If you want to save your
son and your reputation..

90
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,820
..then find a solution for
this immediately. Your son is..

91
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,900
..about to leave you and
marry a girl of another caste.

92
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,140
Did I bring him up to see this day!

93
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,260
What's the matter,
Thakur Bishan Singh?

94
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,080
What happened?

95
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
Ten years ago I promised to my
late friend at his deathbed..

96
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,080
..about my Ravi's marriage
and today my son is about to..

97
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,400
..get married to a
girl of another caste..

98
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
..and live with their in-laws.
- In-laws?

99
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,890
Then stop him immediately.

100
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,250
Or else Ravi's life will be ruined.

101
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,610
If you want to save your son's life..

102
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,570
..then write a letter to him
and call him here immediately.

103
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,210
And get him married
where you have decided..

104
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,250
..to get him married.

105
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,290
I will have to do something like that.

106
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,290
We must cut the evil from its roots.
- You are absolutely right.

107
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,770
Now take my son-in-law for example.

108
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,410
Ever since I brought him
to live in our house..

109
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,490
..he stopped working at all.

110
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,570
He is enjoying a jobless life
at his father-in-law's house.

111
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,290
Now I have thrown
him out of the house..

112
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,810
..and told him not to show
his face till he gets a job.

113
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,690
Mr. Thakur, the man who
lives in his in-laws' house..

114
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,570
..doesn't have any respect or dignity.

115
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
Father, now you take rest.

116
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,640
But first of all give me that pan.

117
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
Here father.

118
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,440
What happened!

119
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,000
Who's that?
- Father-in-law.

120
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,280
Ram Swaroop, what are you doing here?

121
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,640
Father-in-law,
actually I lost my 5 rupees..

122
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
..so I am searching my money.
- 5 rupees?

123
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,720
Yes.
- But how did you get those 5 rupees?

124
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,240
Saroj, did you give that
money to this lazy person?

125
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,080
No, father, I didn't
give him any money.

126
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Ramswaroop, come in. You come in.

127
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,080
Shall I come in?
- Yes, come in.

128
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,840
Now tell me did you have the money..

129
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,680
..or did you come to
ask money to Saroj?

130
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,680
Tell me honestly.
- Shall I tell you honestly?

131
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Yes. - Father-in-law,
someone picked my pocket.

132
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Really? You are the one who
picks others pockets and now..

133
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,600
..you are telling me that
someone picked your pocket?

134
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,840
You traitor! I told you
repeatedly not to come..

135
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,600
..to this house till you get a job.

136
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,760
Get out. Now get out.
- I'm leaving.

137
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,360
Give me 10 rupees.
- 10 rupees? - Yes.

138
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,200
Do you think that I have a
machine of printing notes?

139
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040
Why don't you try to understand it!

140
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,280
My pocket has been picked.
Where will I eat now?

141
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,800
Go to hell.
- Father!

142
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,360
Dear, you do this all the times.

143
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,080
Ok, take this.

144
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,240
But remember one thing,
don't come to this house..

145
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,880
..till you get a job or else
you will regret it. - Ok, fine.

146
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,520
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

147
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Father, at least you would
have let him have dinner.

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Dear, whatever I am doing I
am doing it for your welfare.

149
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,960
If I don't be strict right
now then he won't work..

150
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
..for the rest of his life.

151
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,755
Shall I bring some food
if you hungry?

152
00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:21,751
My hunger to see you is
more than my hunger for food.

153
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,290
Dear, come near me. Come.

154
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,730
You are looking so beautiful.

155
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,730
What are you doing!
What if father sees us!

156
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,410
What's wrong if your
father sees us! We are married.

157
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,890
I didn't elope with you.

158
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,930
Saroj, after thinking for a
long time I came to a conclusion.

159
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,450
What's that?
- That a person should only love..

160
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,610
..but never get married.
- Why so?

161
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,530
Marriage brings the
burden of responsibilities.

162
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,370
We have to do a job! Then we
have to earn for the family!

163
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,770
Then we need to bring all
the requisites for the family.

164
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,570
The teenage love is so special.

165
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,490
There is no worry to
bring rice or wheat to home..

166
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,370
..nor we are afraid of anyone.
We meet each other..

167
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,450
..away from everyone's sight.
We sing love songs.

168
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,330
We just enjoy life.

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
"Our eyes came in contact."

170
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,120
"Two flowers blossomed."

171
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,960
"And the spring came to this world."

172
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,640
"It brought a new color to our lives."

173
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,440
"It brought a new color to our lives."

174
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,320
"The heart started singing.
The heart started dancing."

175
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,040
"The love started blossoming."

176
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,680
"The shehanais started blowing."

177
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,120
"The shehanais started blowing."

178
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,240
"Our eyes came in contact."

179
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:06,560
"O dear, don't look at me
with the desires in your eyes."

180
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,320
"I fear if the love would get angry."

181
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,080
"The world is bad. Be
afraid of this world."

182
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,840
"The world is bad. Be
afraid of this world."

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,640
"I am not afraid of this world."

184
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
"The world is cynical."

185
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,080
"And love is revolt."

186
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,560
"And love is revolt."

187
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,600
"Our eyes came in contact."

188
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,640
"O dear, let me live under the
shadow of your silky hair.."

189
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,960
"..for a moment."

190
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,920
"O dear, let me get
intoxicated through your eyes."

191
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,640
"Let me drink through your eyes."

192
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,280
"Drinking is not such a
wrong thing, O merchant of love."

193
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,000
"But if totter then it
will be a wrong thing."

194
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,800
"But if totter then it
will be a wrong thing."

195
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,760
"Our eyes came in contact."

196
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,600
"Two flowers blossomed."

197
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,440
"And the spring came to this world."

198
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,160
"It brought a new color to our lives."

199
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
"It brought a new color to our lives."

200
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,720
"Our eyes came in contact."

201
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,800
Mr. Ravi.

202
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,680
There's a letter for you.
- Letter?

203
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,800
Whose letter is it? - My
father's condition is very serious.

204
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,880
They called me there immediately.

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,560
What happened to him all of a sudden?
- I don't know.

206
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,240
He wrote me last week that he's well.

207
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,520
Don't worry. Everything will
be alright. Come, sit down.

208
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,800
No, Lakshmi. I don't have time now.

209
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,480
I can catch the train tonight.

210
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,280
I am leaving.

211
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,080
Listen.

212
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,880
I will be very worried. Give
me a call when you reach home.

213
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,560
Ok, I will.

214
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Excuse me, is this your Attache?
- Sorry!

215
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,799
Is this your Attache?
- Yes.

216
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,799
When does the train reach Allahabad?

217
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,120
Tomorrow at 10 O'
clock in the morning.

218
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,800
Are you going there for
the first time? - Yes.

219
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,839
There's my friend's sister's marriage.

220
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,000
And where are you going?
- Lucknow.

221
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,320
Do you live there?
- Yes. I study in Delhi.

222
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,880
My father's health
is in poor condition.

223
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,280
That's why I'm going home.

224
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,300
And where's the Banarsi sari.

225
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,060
Bhola, that merchant didn't
bring the Banarasi sari yet.

226
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,020
Go and call him.
- Ok, sir.

227
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,860
Father.
- Ravi, you are back?

228
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,430
God bless you.
- What's all this, father?

229
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,510
And what was that letter about?
- That's all fine.

230
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,350
Son, you came from
such a long distance.

231
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,230
Come inside and have
something to eat. - But..

232
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,990
I said come inside.

233
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,050
Now ask me what you want to ask.

234
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,850
Why did you send that false letter?

235
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,810
Because I wanted to call
here immediately. - But why?

236
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,970
Tomorrow all of us
are going to Allahabad.

237
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,330
Allahabad? What for?
- Because tomorrow..

238
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,130
..you are getting married over there.
- Marriage?

239
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,507
But how did you fix this
marriage without asking me.

240
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,290
When we fixed this
marriage you didn't even know..

241
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,770
..how to speak! How could I
have asked? - But father..

242
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,230
I can't accept this marriage.
- Why can't you?

243
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,690
Because the city-girls
made you blind? - Father!

244
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,290
Shut up! I know everything
about the girl who made..

245
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,090
..you a Romeo.
- Father, you are accusing a decent..

246
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,890
..and well-cultured girl.

247
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,010
My accusing that decent
and well-cultured girl..

248
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,290
..hurt you that much whom
you hardly know since a year.

249
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,930
And it didn't bother you at
all to insult your father..

250
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,250
..who looked after you
like a slave for 26 years..

251
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,930
..who worked in the
piercing sunlight and rainy days..

252
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,090
..and kept you like a Lotus?

253
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,330
Don't you feel sad to
humiliate such a father?

254
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,250
Do you value that girl more
than you value your father?

255
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,090
No, no, father. Why are you saying so?

256
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,530
I didn't mean that. I
was just saying that..

257
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,130
..I promised that girl
that I will marry her.

258
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,050
If I ask you the same
question that why you promised her..

259
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,650
..without asking me,
then you might say that..

260
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,050
..hey, old man, I am not
your little Ravi anymore..

261
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,890
..who would follow your orders.

262
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,650
Now I am young. Now I am independent.

263
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,730
No, father. For God's
sake don't think so.

264
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,970
I'm still the same old little
Ravi for you. I am the same Ravi.

265
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,170
Then why did you promise
her without consulting me.

266
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,930
I thought that my father
who never said no to me..

267
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,970
..ever since childhood will
not say no to me now as well.

268
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,170
I promised her trusting
your love for me, father.

269
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,970
I promised her because I
know that you would sacrifice..

270
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,130
..anything for your son's happiness.

271
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,810
That's why I promised her, father.

272
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,010
That's why you promised her?
- Yes, father.

273
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,890
Ok, then, go and marry her.
- I knew it, father, you'll approve.

274
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,060
But you will have to pay
the price for this approval.

275
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,140
Price? What kind of price?
- A very big price.

276
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,380
Ravi, come here.

277
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Do you know who he is?
- Yes, he's a friend of yours..

278
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,352
..who passed away.
- Do you know how he died?

279
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,800
No, father.

280
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,100
With this gun.
- With this gun? But this is your gun.

281
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,940
Yes, it's my gun.

282
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,040
This is the matter of those
days when I was interested..

283
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,880
..in hunting. A poor
man was my hunter.

284
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,720
Once he fell prey to
my gun accidentally.

285
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,480
While dying he was
worried about his daughter.

286
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,640
At that time I promised him
that I will get his daughter..

287
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,600
..married with my son.

288
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,880
Ram Singh, today I
am helpless, friend.

289
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
I can't keep my word.

290
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,720
Because my son wants
to marry someone else.

291
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,800
But Thakur Bhishan
Singh's promise can't break..

292
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,680
..till he is alive. Ram Singh,
before my promise is broken..

293
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,440
..I will sacrifice my life.
- Father!

294
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,220
Your promise will be fulfilled,
father.

295
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Your promise will be fulfilled.
- Ravi, my son!

296
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,980
Gopal!
- Manohar!

297
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,710
Wow! Your arrival made me so
happy that I can't express it.

298
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,590
Did you think that I
will not come here?

299
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,270
That's not the thing, but I
used to wonder that you became..

300
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,070
..such a big doctor, and
how you would come here..

301
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,350
..leaving your practice in Massouri.

302
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,430
What are you saying! Is
our friendship that weak!

303
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,190
And tell me one thing did
you get the sweets on time?

304
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,790
No. No. There is
time for the marriage.

305
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,350
Come and see the bridegroom.

306
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,910
You are already feeling shy?

307
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,670
Show me your face.

308
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,110
Your bridegroom is here.

309
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,230
Parvati.

310
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,750
Parvati, come.

311
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,950
Mother, give her your blessings.

312
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,830
Her husband should always be with her.

313
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,710
And she should lead a happy
life in her in-laws' place.

314
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:41,110
Chants!

315
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,289
Wait a minute, Mr. Priest. The
marriage can't take place yet.

316
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,110
The bride's brother hasn't
given the complete dowry.

317
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,130
What are you doing,
uncle! I already told you..

318
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,250
..that I will pay you
the remaining money..

319
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,730
..within six months.
- Go and tell that to someone else.

320
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,792
Dowry doesn't run on credit.
- Save my grace for now.

321
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,450
I promise I will pay that money
within six months at any cost.

322
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,790
Please don't play
with my reputation here.

323
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,550
If you really worried that
much about your reputation..

324
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,190
..then you could have got
her married to a beggar's on.

325
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,750
If you wanted an
educated bridegroom who has a..

326
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,150
..government job, then
you should have also had..

327
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,390
..the price ready with you.
There are many matches..

328
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,950
..are who are ready to
pay me 5,000 rupees more.

329
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,150
Did you get me, Manohar?
- Just 5,000 rupees..

330
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,670
..isn't everything,
sir. A person's humanity

331
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,310
..is more value than that.

332
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,310
A brother has so many dreams
about his sister's marriage.

333
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,670
What's there that he
hadn't had done for her!

334
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,470
Please don't ruin someone's life,
someone's happiness..

335
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,790
..for a few rupees.
- Go away, mister.

336
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,910
Don't give me a
lecture about humanity.

337
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,350
I spent 30,000 rupees for his studies.

338
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,670
Who will pay that money?
- Listen to me, Manohar..

339
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,030
..if you pay me 2,000
rupees cash right time..

340
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,390
..then this marriage will happen..

341
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,150
..or else we will
leave this place right now.

342
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,910
No, no, uncle. Please don't
do that. We will be ruined.

343
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,230
If 2,000 rupees is the
price of your goodness..

344
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,950
..then I promise you, I
will send you that money.

345
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,200
Everyone makes promises, but
no one pays the money later.

346
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,160
I have seen the
world more than you did.

347
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,360
Show your suit and
boot to someone else.

348
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
I have seen many people
like you. Get up, Deepak..

349
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
Let's go.

350
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
Get up. What are you staring at!

351
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,400
No, uncle. Please have mercy on me.

352
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,120
If not on me, at least
have mercy on my sister.

353
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,560
If you leave you will
be ruining her life.

354
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,760
Please don't punish
her for my mistake.

355
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,440
Go and act like that on stage.
You will make good money.

356
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,320
No, uncle! Uncle!

357
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,370
Manohar. Get up, friend.
- Gopal.

358
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,690
There is nothing to get upset about.

359
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,810
The people whom you were
sending your sister to..

360
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,650
..has proved themselves to
be animals at the right time.

361
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,530
Assume that your sister's
life is saved. - No, Gopal.

362
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,810
Her life is completely destroyed.

363
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,650
She is ruined forever.
You don't know it, Gopal..

364
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,050
..this is the worst day of our lives.

365
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,730
A brother can't see such a day.

366
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,570
Have courage, Manohan! Have courage!

367
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,130
There is no problem in this
world which doesn't have a solution.

368
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,930
Such a problem
doesn't have a solution..

369
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,890
..in this society and this world.

370
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:24,410
I am telling the truth, my
Parvati's life is ruined forever.

371
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,650
Now no one is going to
marry this unfortunate girl.

372
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,690
No one will marry her.

373
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,850
No one will marry her.

374
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,570
Manohar, if that's the case..

375
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,530
..then I am ready to marry her.

376
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,290
I will marry her.

377
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,650
What! - Yes, Manohar, if
you don't have a problem..

378
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,730
..then I am ready to marry her.
- No.

379
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:57,290
This can't be true, Gopal. My
Parvati is not that fortunate..

380
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,450
..that she would get
a husband like you.

381
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,290
Please don't make fun of me.
- Do you think I will make..

382
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,730
..fun of you during such a moment?

383
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,490
I am telling the truth.

384
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,030
"I don't feel good.."

385
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,830
"..my beloved one didn't come yet."

386
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,870
"I don't feel good.."

387
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,670
"..my beloved one didn't come yet."

388
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,590
"I don't feel good.."

389
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,030
"I have seen your intentions."

390
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,470
"Your promises are all lies."

391
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,750
"I have seen your intentions."

392
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:47,230
"Your promises are all lies."

393
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,630
"I am suffering with your memories."

394
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,710
"My eyes became drenched."

395
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,230
"My eyes became drenched."

396
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:08,190
"I don't feel good.."

397
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,510
"..my beloved one didn't come yet."

398
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,990
"I don't feel good.."

399
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,710
"You have taken away my peace."

400
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:47,350
"You aren't ashamed of
your mercilessness."

401
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,670
"You have taken away my peace."

402
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:58,070
"You aren't ashamed of
your mercilessness."

403
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,710
"Why did you forget me, O tormenter.."

404
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,510
"..after going to the foreign land?"

405
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,230
"..after going to the foreign land?"

406
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,630
"I don't feel good.."

407
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,350
"You have taken away my peace."

408
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:31,070
"I don't feel good.."

409
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,070
Manohar!

410
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,350
Manohar!

411
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,230
Manohar! Manohar!

412
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,870
Manohar!

413
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,390
Parvati. Parvati.

414
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,070
Manohar!

415
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,390
Sheela. Sheela.

416
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,990
Manohar!

417
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,910
Father! Father!

418
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,080
Saroj, father-in-law went
to Ravi's marriage alone?

419
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,800
No one told me about it?

420
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,040
When did father go? He is right here.
- Here's here?

421
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,280
Why are you worrying!
Finish your meals fast.

422
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,240
Saroj.
- Father-in-law. - Father!

423
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,120
The door is closed.
- Escape from this way.

424
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,920
Saroj. - Yes, father.
Shall I serve the meals?

425
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,680
No, dear. Ravi and
everyone else is returning..

426
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,760
..from the marriage. I
am going to receive them.

427
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,480
Why are you going
that way? Go this way.

428
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,720
Dear, it's been many
days since I bathed.

429
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I feel like taking a
bath and going there.

430
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,480
What's the need to bath?
You will catch cold.

431
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,200
No, dear. I will heat the water.
You don't worry at all.

432
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,880
Go and bring the towel for me.
- Father. Father, listen to me.

433
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,320
You will fall ill.
- Dear, you don't worry about me.

434
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,560
God will take care of everything.

435
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,319
Is water there in it?
- No, father, there's no water.

436
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,560
Ok, then, I will start the tap.
You start the fire.

437
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,480
This is such a tight tap.

438
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,120
You are staring at me.
Go and start the fire.

439
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,920
Where's the matchbox?
- Father, the matchbox..

440
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
..is not there. Go and bring
a matchbox from the market.

441
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
Father. Father.

442
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,120
Father. Father, stop it.
The water is boiling.

443
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,640
Go away, dear. I am in a hurry.
You are irritating me.

444
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,440
Father, you will finish the
entire kerosene. - Go away.

445
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,920
Father, stop it.

446
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,040
Enough, father. Enough.

447
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,760
Father.

448
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,640
Uncle, there some bad news.
- What happened?

449
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,640
The train in which Mr.
Ravi and everyone was coming..

450
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,280
..met with an accident.
Our elder sir died..

451
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,400
..and many guests also died.
- O God!

452
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,760
Saroj, let's go there.
- Yes, father.

453
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,360
Come fast.

454
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,160
Ravi. Ravi, my son.
- Uncle.

455
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,240
Where did you leave my brother?
- Uncle!

456
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,280
Don't worry, son. Don't worry.
I'm still alive. I'm still alive.

457
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,160
Mr. Thakur went to bring
such a daughter-in-law..

458
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,320
..who sent him away from this world.

459
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,480
Sister, she is not a daughter-in-law,
but she is a devil.

460
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,000
She devoured her
father-in-law and the other guests.

461
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,600
Rajjo's mother, did you
come here to console them..

462
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,640
..or to blame the daughter-in-law?
What's her fault in it!

463
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,520
Daughter-in-law, don't get
bothered about what they say.

464
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,160
Saroj, take her inside.
- Ok, father.

465
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,080
Sister, why are you upset?
The society always..

466
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,800
..blames one or other. Even
if it's not anyone mistake..

467
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,320
..they will still blame us. You
don't get bothered about them.

468
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,400
You just take care of
your home and your husband.

469
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,800
I wonder what he thinks about me.
- Who? Brother Ravi?

470
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,200
He won't get bothered
about what people say.

471
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,480
When you will meet him
you'll say how good my brother is.

472
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,560
Ok, now remove your
tears and control your heart.

473
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,960
Mother.

474
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,360
Gopal, you are back?
- Yes, mother.

475
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,160
You didn't even inform
me about your coming.

476
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
Since I heard about
the train accident..

477
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,800
..I was worrying about you.

478
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
What's the matter?

479
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
What have you done to yourself?

480
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,000
Where is your luggage? - I lost
everything in the train, mother.

481
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,240
In the train?

482
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,800
You were also there in that train?
- Yes, mother.

483
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,360
My dear, my son, I will
never let you go alone.

484
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,840
I will offer inunctions
to Almighty right now.

485
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,880
Nandu! O Nandu!

486
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,960
Bring Pede of 1.50 rupees.
Gopal is here. - Ok.

487
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,160
Manohar.

488
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,120
What happened? Is Manohar fine?

489
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,080
You went to his
sister's marriage, right?

490
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,000
Then why are you crying
in front of his photo?

491
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,560
I guess he is not there in
this world anymore. - What!

492
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,800
What are you saying!
- After marriage Manohar and..

493
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,280
..his sister were coming
with me in that train..

494
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,240
..but both of them
died in an accident.

495
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,120
How unfortunate her
bridegroom must've been..

496
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,240
..that he devoured the
brother and sister after marriage.

497
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,360
A few grooms are very unfortunate.

498
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,200
I am that unfortunate groom.
- What are you saying!

499
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,240
You got married and
your wife passed away?

500
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,080
How did this happen,
Gopal! How did this happen!

501
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,320
Come and sit here, mother.
I will explain everything.

502
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,480
Saroj.
- What happened now?

503
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,480
I am..
- Nothing to worry, sister-in-law.

504
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,320
Such kind of feeling is
common on the first night.

505
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,360
..the heart beats faster,
but they eyes search..

506
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,334
..the beloved one all over the places.

507
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,389
Look at me.

508
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,240
Are these eyes waiting
for your beloved one?

509
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,560
If this is how you will behave
then brother Ravi is be ruined.

510
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,880
"O beauty, don't hide
your face behind the veil."

511
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,400
"This is the night of
making eye contact."

512
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,680
"O beauty, don't hide
your face behind the veil."

513
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
"This is the night of
making eye contact."

514
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,400
"Don't look at me.."

515
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,160
"Don't look at me with anger."

516
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,800
"This is the night of
smiling and giggling."

517
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,040
"Why are you blushing tonight?"

518
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,920
"This moment doesn't come everyday."

519
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,800
"Your dear one is
about to come to meet you."

520
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,000
"The flowers of your
heart are about to blossom."

521
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,400
"Your beloved one's
eyes will ruin you."

522
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
"Your will quit your shyness today."

523
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,280
"Your heart is somewhere else."

524
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,200
"Your eyes are wandering."

525
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,000
"Don't go away from me."

526
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,800
"This is the night of
meeting your beloved one."

527
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,720
"O beauty, your face.."

528
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,600
"O beauty, don't hide
your face behind the veil."

529
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,360
"This is the night of
making eye contact."

530
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,880
"Stay mum for tonight."

531
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,720
"Don't reveal your
heart to your beloved one."

532
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,600
"If he flirts with
you then turn around."

533
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,320
"Don't fall for his words."

534
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,040
"You don't how these men are."

535
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,040
"They are very smarts jerks."

536
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,800
"He will request you,
he will salute you.."

537
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,400
"..but ask him to get lost."

538
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,120
"This is the night to show attitude."

539
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,120
"O beauty, your face.."

540
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,840
"O beauty, don't hide
your face behind the veil."

541
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,600
"This is the night of
making eye contact."

542
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,240
"Don't look at me with anger."

543
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,080
"This is the night of
smiling and giggling."

544
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,720
Come in. Come in.

545
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,160
Come in, brother.

546
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,410
Saroj is a very naughty girl.

547
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,610
I guess she had troubled you as well.

548
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,810
Sit down.

549
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,330
You were wearing such a
long veil during marriage..

550
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,930
..that I couldn't see your face.

551
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,690
Now remove your veil.

552
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,730
You might have already seen me.

553
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,850
How could I have seen you!
- Why?

554
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:57,290
When the other groom and
his family left I fainted.

555
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,890
If you hadn't had mercy
on this unfortunate girl..

556
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,050
..then my brother and I
would have committed suicide.

557
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,210
What did you say? Your brother?

558
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,690
Brother Manohar.

559
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,170
Now look at me.

560
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,810
Do you recognize him?

561
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,650
What happened?
- Since the accident my head aches..

562
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,290
..continuously and I feel as
if I am forgetting everything.

563
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:01,970
Who I am, who you are, I
don't remember even your name..

564
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,010
Parvati. What is happening to you?

565
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,370
I don't understand what I should do.

566
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:15,490
Everything is becoming dark.
- Then you take rest.

567
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,410
I will tell Saroj to call the doctor.

568
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,690
There is no need to call the doctor.

569
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,130
I will go to him personally.

570
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,690
Uncle. Uncle, I made a grave mistake.

571
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,130
What happened, son?
- Uncle, that girl is not my wife.

572
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,850
What!
- I am telling the truth, uncle.

573
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,330
I brought some other girl
after the train accident.

574
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,450
But how did you that?
- By her talk.

575
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,210
She isn't Thakur's
Ram Singh's daughter..

576
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,970
..she doesn't even know me.
- O God!

577
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,090
How could this happen,
son! What will happen now?

578
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,850
That's what I am
worrying about, uncle.

579
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,410
She is a girl from a decent family.

580
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,170
If she knows that she
went to other man's house..

581
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,370
..due to shyness I fear
she may commit suicide.

582
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,570
Now you tell me what
I shall do, uncle.

583
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,010
You did the right
thing by not telling her.

584
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,010
You did the right thing.
- Uncle, you will have to help me.

585
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,290
Yes, son. I am ready to do
whatever you'll ask me to do.

586
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,810
I am going to search
his brother and husband.

587
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,930
But if people know about it,
then it will be an issue.

588
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,010
You go to Delhi with Ramkush
Saroj and Parvati. - What!

589
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,650
Yes, there is a small
rented house of mine.

590
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,730
You stay there and till then
I'll search her family. - Ok, son.

591
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,650
But uncle, even Ram
Swaroop and Saroj..

592
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,770
..should know about it.
- Don't worry about it, son.

593
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,170
No one other than God, you
and I can know about it.

594
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,250
We will leave by the morning train.

595
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,290
Father.
- Where did brother leave at night?

596
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,290
He had some work, dear.
- What such work, father!

597
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,250
There was some urgent work.
That's why he went there.

598
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,210
Sister-in-law, did he
tell something to you?

599
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,130
No?

600
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,050
He is asking about the
bridegroom's address.

601
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,970
Not only in this locality,
but no one in this city..

602
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,770
..knows his address.
He was Manohar's friend.

603
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,890
We don't know who he was,
where he came from..

604
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,490
This marriage happened
in such circumstances..

605
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:16,650
..that no one had a chance to
ask the groom's whereabouts.

606
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,690
If you don't have any objections..

607
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,170
..may I open his house and check it..

608
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,810
If I am fortunate then I
may get a photo of him.

609
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,010
Why would we have any objection?

610
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,210
Manohar always used
to give keys to Kaka.

611
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,890
Kaka, open the house.
- Come.

612
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,970
Search the house.
This is Manohar's room.

613
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,650
This is Manojar's mother's photo..

614
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,010
..and it's his mother's photo.

615
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,850
We can't see any other photo here.

616
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,410
Is this Manohar's photo?
- Yes, it's his photo.

617
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,890
Excuse me I want to give this
advertisement in your paper.

618
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,490
Also print this photo along with that.

619
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,530
Ok, fine.

620
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,850
Brother, you are back?
- Yes.

621
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,250
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.

622
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,370
Sister-in-law. O sister-in-law.

623
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,570
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.

624
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,210
What's the matter?
- Your beloved one is here.

625
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,970
What's that reaction! My
brother came from such a..

626
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,170
..long distance. He has to get fresh.

627
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,850
He has to change his dress.
Who will help him with that?

628
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,530
I am very busy.
- Why are you making excuses?

629
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,530
Are you busy are you are upset at him?

630
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,170
Why would I be upset?
- I understand everything.

631
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,530
You are upset with him
because he left you alone..

632
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,850
..on the first night.
- Don't trouble me.

633
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,410
Sister-in-law, shall
I tell you something?

634
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,130
Anger won't be of any use for a lady.

635
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,850
To win one's husband anger
or attitude won't help you.

636
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,850
Only service can help you.

637
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,930
If you want to win your husband..

638
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,250
..then always stay
close to your husband..

639
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,490
..with some excuse or other.
Did you get me?

640
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,970
Now go. Go! Go!

641
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:27,650
No.

642
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,690
No, Parvati, you shouldn't
do all this. It's wrong.

643
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,570
Why? - Because I think one
should do his own work..

644
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,490
..as much as possible.

645
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,410
What's the matter,
sister-in-law, so did you meet your..

646
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,890
..beloved one?
- Shut up!

647
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,570
Why should I? You must have
talked to him at least a little.

648
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,010
Nothing.

649
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,130
Sister-in-law! Tell
me at least something.

650
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,050
Don't tell me, sister-in-law.
Even I won't tell you anything.

651
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,450
She's very clever.

652
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,890
Keep it there.

653
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,530
Ok, give it to me.

654
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,210
O dear, Saroj.
- Coming.

655
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,450
What's this?
- I got a job.

656
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,210
Job?
- Yes. - Who is so dumb in Delhi..

657
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,810
..who would give you a job?
- Foolish lady, dumb people..

658
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,970
..don't live in Delhi.
Everyone is a clever person.

659
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,850
The manager whom brother
Ravi asked me to meet..

660
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,730
..with his recommendation letter..

661
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,050
..hired me immediately
after reading the letter..

662
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,770
..and then gave me 50 rupees.
- 50 rupees?

663
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,530
Yes. And I brought the first
sari for you with my first earning.

664
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:09,810
Sari? For me? - Now you will
have to become a Delhi-girl.

665
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,690
Your Bareli shirts
dresses won't work here.

666
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:16,610
Wear it for me. You
are looking so beautiful.

667
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,410
What are you doing! What
if sister-in-law sees me!

668
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,690
So what! You are my wife.

669
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,210
Father is back.

670
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,330
Father-in-law, did you
bring the vegetables? - Yes.

671
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,090
Ravi, when did you come?
- Just now, uncle.

672
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,490
Ravi, thank you. Thank you.

673
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,650
You gave a solid letter.
The moment that manager..

674
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,850
..read that letter he
gave me a job immediately.

675
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,450
Job? You got a job?
- Yes, father-in-law, I got a job.

676
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:44,290
And it's such a great office.
You will faint if you see it.

677
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,330
Really?
- Yes! There are such large windows..

678
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:51,170
..there are many electric fans.
And father-in-law, there are..

679
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,210
..workers even for bringing
files and for bringing water.

680
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:56,130
Father-in-law, there
is dearth of nothing.

681
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,090
But brother Ravi, there
is dearth of one thing.

682
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:03,410
What's that? - There's no cot
over there. If they give us..

683
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,050
..a cot then it will be great
to sleep there under the fans.

684
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:10,490
Son, do one thing.
- What's that, father-in-law?

685
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,730
Tomorrow I will come to your
office along with your cot.

686
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,570
You can sleep there and I
will also sing song for you.

687
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,250
Very good, father-in-law.
Very good father-in-law.

688
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,290
Very good, father-in-law!
Very good, father-in-law!

689
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,010
You fool, the office is
a place where you work..

690
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,730
..but not a place
where you could sleep.

691
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,650
Father. You can fight with him later.

692
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,530
Have your meals first.

693
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:36,050
Meals? Today I came back
from work. I am very hungry.

694
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,450
Excuse me, father-in-law.

695
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,810
Come, son. Let's have dinner.

696
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,930
It's enough. What are you doing!

697
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:55,010
It's alright. Let it be in the plate.

698
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,330
But why should we
waste the rice like that?

699
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,170
The rice won't go waste, brother.

700
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,530
Sister-in-law will eat in that plate.
- Parvati?

701
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:07,450
No. No. Why would
Parvati eat in this plate!

702
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,050
Brother Ravi, you don't
know women like eating..

703
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:15,090
..in their husband's plates.

704
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,450
They are old thoughts. I
don't like them at all.

705
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,250
Ok, sister-in-law, goodnight.

706
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,250
My life is stuck in
strange difficulties.

707
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,290
I wonder when this
puzzle will be solved.

708
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,650
When you are doing good for someone..

709
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,090
..then why are you worried
about such small problems.

710
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,610
I am not afraid of problems, uncle.
- Then?

711
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:24,330
I pity this lady. She's so innocent.

712
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,210
How could her destiny
play such games with her!

713
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,330
Son, I wish God makes
your wishes come true.

714
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,530
Yes, uncle. I wish she
gets her husband back..

715
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,090
..and she lives her
life happily with him.

716
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,330
That is all I want.

717
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,530
That means brother Ravi didn't
sleep in the room last night.

718
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,970
Did he talk to you after marriage?

719
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,770
Saroj, I think I don't deserve him.

720
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,370
I think I am not good enough for him.

721
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:19,490
That's not the thing, but there
is definitely something wrong..

722
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,450
..in Ravi's eyes. He
can't see the beauty in you.

723
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:27,170
Sister-in-law, is
brother upset with you?

724
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,810
I haven't done any such thing.

725
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,690
Sister, you never know these men.

726
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:39,890
Even if it's not our mistake,
they get upset when they wish.

727
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,770
Sister-in-law, do one thing.
- What?

728
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:50,610
Ask him directly why he avoids you.

729
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,690
I would ask him only if he
sits beside me for a moment.

730
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,250
He even runs away from my shadow.

731
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,210
I have a remedy to that too.
- Father is not at home.

732
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,490
And my husband I will
go to watch some play.

733
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:08,130
Then even if stays in the
balcony or even if goes..

734
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:11,530
..upstairs, don't leave
him till you win him over.

735
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,490
Saroj! I am getting late to office.
- Coming.

736
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:19,170
I will tell him and
make all the arrangements.

737
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,330
Listen.

738
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,450
God bless us. Today you
are laughing and coming.

739
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,130
Why dear? Don't you like my laughter?

740
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,650
No, no. This is not the case.
When a woman laughs..

741
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,490
..then a man's pocked is picked.

742
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,250
Really. How?

743
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:45,930
Like this.

744
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,850
This means, she wants a blouse.

745
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,570
What are you doing dear?

746
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,250
This means, she wants a 'Sari'.

747
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,250
But I couldn't understand the
reason for today's laughter.

748
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,730
Look dear. Today you take
me along for watching drama.

749
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,970
Hey. When did you get this interest?

750
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,530
Why don't you understand dear?

751
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,170
Then make me understand.

752
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,170
This is the matter.
- Yes.

753
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,770
Get aside.

754
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,890
50 paisa. Happy. Now you can go.

755
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,290
Hey. Get in queue.

756
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,650
Oh God! This is a long queue.
If I stand in this queue..

757
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,130
..then it will take one hour.
And I am job to do.

758
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,090
Hey. Why are you fighting?
Stand in queue. You idiot.

759
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,730
You do your work.
- Oh shut up.

760
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,170
You shut up.
- Shut up!

761
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,010
Alright. Mr. watchman.
Please do me a favor.

762
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,410
Get in queue.

763
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:59,530
Hey. Why are you pushing?
Showing me knife.

764
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:08,930
What is the cost?
- 25 paisa.

765
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,330
I want 3 tickets. Quickly.

766
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,050
Snake! Snake!

767
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,490
Snake! Snake!

768
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:24,850
Give me 2 tickets.
- But you asked for 3 tickets.

769
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,490
Then give me 3 tickets.
- Here it is.

770
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,330
6 Rupees.
- Here is your money.

771
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,850
Money!
- Yes.

772
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,410
Oh God! Today is a lucky day.

773
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,930
Always show me such days.

774
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,650
Hey. Today is a very bad day.
Is this your father's tickets..

775
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,850
..and your father's money?

776
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,890
Is this your father's tickets?
- No sir, your father's.

777
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:52,490
Yes, it is my father's.
- Come on, give it to me.

778
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,290
You go and ask him
whose money this is.

779
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,650
You go and ask, if you
want to ask. I won't.

780
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:59,290
Get aside.
- Give me my money.

781
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,500
Even a deity will be
enticed by this beautiful face..

782
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,980
..then there is no
question of brother.

783
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,810
I feel as if I should kiss you.

784
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,930
Hey, sister-in-law.

785
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:17,690
Saroj, where are you?

786
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:18,970
Yes.

787
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,770
Hey Saroj. Come fast,
it is time to leave.

788
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,970
Where are they going Parvati?

789
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,850
To watch drama.
- Drama!

790
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,090
Hey Ram Swarop.
- What is it?

791
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,850
You are going alone to watch drama.

792
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,930
Yes. Today we want to go alone.

793
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:57,330
But why?
- This is a secret. I can't tell you.

794
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,970
Hey. Wait. Just listen.

795
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,250
I came here to take you to the drama.

796
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,610
What? Friend, why
didn't you say so before?

797
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:04,690
I have even bought the tickets.

798
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,410
No problem. We will go
there and sell it to someone.

799
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,930
Or I will give you the money.
- Ravi, you are great.

800
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,690
You are great.

801
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,010
Saroj.. Saroj.

802
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,410
Saroj.. Saroj.

803
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,010
What to tell you? Today
my work is done for free.

804
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,930
What happened? - Ravi is
going to show us drama today.

805
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,530
Oh God! You are a fool, dear.

806
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,690
What have I done?
- You have spoilt everything.

807
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,970
How?

808
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:36,090
Oh God!

809
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,610
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

810
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,770
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

811
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:55,690
"If someone falls in love,
then this world hates it."

812
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:59,770
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

813
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:03,570
"If someone falls in love,
then this world hates it."

814
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:08,290
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

815
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:27,530
"One day I met a
lover boy on the way."

816
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:32,370
"One day I met a
lover boy on the way."

817
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:37,250
"He started saying
that he loved my eyes."

818
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:40,490
"I didn't realize that
the world was watching me."

819
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,250
"And I started singing in excitement."

820
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:18,570
"The world started
scaring me and making rumor."

821
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:22,490
"I ran from there, saving my life."

822
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:26,490
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

823
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:30,370
"If someone falls in love,
then this world hates it."

824
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,010
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

825
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:48,090
"One day I met a handsome young man."

826
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:52,970
"One day I met a handsome young man."

827
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:57,810
"He started saying that I was
more beautiful than the moon."

828
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,930
"I didn't realize that
the world was watching me."

829
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:04,050
"And I started singing in excitement."

830
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:40,930
"The world started
scaring me and making rumor."

831
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,890
"I ran from there, saving my life."

832
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:48,890
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

833
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:52,610
"If someone falls in love,
then this world hates it."

834
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:57,290
"Don't fall in love.
This is a cruel world."

835
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,970
"One day I met a
unique man on the way."

836
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,770
"One day I met a
unique man on the way."

837
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:19,730
"He started saying that his
heart was lonely with me."

838
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:22,810
"I didn't realize that
the world was watching me."

839
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:26,370
"And I started singing in excitement."

840
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,500
Taxi!

841
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,100
I don't see any taxi here.

842
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,060
You wait here. I will check that side.

843
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,700
Taxi! Taxi!

844
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:15,300
Ravi!
- Laxmi you.

845
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,020
Greeting mother.

846
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,700
You are in Delhi and didn't inform me.

847
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,750
I have come today Laxmi.
- But for so many days..

848
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,070
..you have neither
informed me nor written letters.

849
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,870
After all, what is the matter?
Is your father well?

850
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,310
I didn't want to trouble
you by giving you the news.

851
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,310
He is.. dead.

852
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:42,950
Oh! I am very sorry, son.

853
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,990
I was telling Laxmi, that
there must be some matter..

854
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,350
..therefore you didn't write letter.

855
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:50,350
Come on. Let's go home.
You look very tense.

856
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,030
Not now. There are few people with me.

857
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,750
But will you come tomorrow morning?
- Yes.

858
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,430
Come early. I will
wait for you at breakfast.

859
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,270
Alright.
- Do come, son.

860
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,510
Yes mother.

861
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,430
Alright sister-in-law. Greetings.

862
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,430
Wait Parvati.

863
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,630
Nothing. I am feeling
giddy by sitting in the..

864
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:39,510
..closed theatre hall. Therefore
I feel like lying in the open.

865
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,670
You go and sleep. Alright.

866
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:36,790
Come. Let's go down.
- No, no.

867
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:43,350
I like to get wet in the rain. But..
why did you.. come here?

868
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:45,510
Go. Go. Go down.. or
else you will fall ill.

869
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:49,910
If you hate me so much
that you don't even want..

870
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:54,390
..to see my face then I
will stay here, you go down.

871
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:57,750
Because of me, why did you
give yourself so much pain?

872
01:08:58,149 --> 01:09:00,349
Hey. What are you doing?

873
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:03,789
If I made a mistake, then forgive me.

874
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:06,830
Alright. I will come down. Get up now.

875
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:24,070
Gopal.

876
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,750
Come.
- Son, have tea.

877
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:35,070
Mother, I forget to tell
you one thing. Tonight I am..

878
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,910
..going to Delhi by train.
So pack my luggage.

879
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:39,470
Delhi. By train again?

880
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,510
All trains don't have accidents.

881
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,470
Alright. Then I too
will come with you.

882
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,550
What will you do there for one day?

883
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:51,390
I was thinking of taking
a bath in 'Ganga' river.

884
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,710
I know mother. I know.

885
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:58,150
No matter what, I will
surely go. And that's final.

886
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,710
Alright dear, alright.

887
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,430
You come too. Pack your
luggage with my luggage.

888
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:04,870
Are you happy now?

889
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:08,710
Wow! See how the
darling son is sleeping.

890
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:11,790
Hey, get up. It is morning.
Get up, Ravi.

891
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,750
Oh my God.

892
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,550
He is having fever.

893
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,190
He is burning like iron.

894
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:24,350
Someone come soon. He is
having 110 degree fever.

895
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:31,110
Saroj. I will get the
medicine and then go to the office.

896
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,670
Alright.
- Take care of Ravi.

897
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,510
There is no need for me to take care.

898
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,830
There is one present to care for him.
- Hey, even then..

899
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:39,630
No, nothing else. It was
nice that God gave poor woman..

900
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,110
..a chance to be with her husband.

901
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:44,910
You just watch. In this fever all
their quarrels will be resolved.

902
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,430
Is it so?
- Yes.

903
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:49,910
Then I too should get such a fever.
- Shut up.

904
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,830
Alright. It should not happen.

905
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,630
It is 9'O clock.
- Don't get up in this fever.

906
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:04,590
I.. - Today I have to go there.
It is very late.

907
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:15,070
Is it really necessary
to go in this fever?

908
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,390
Yes.

909
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:23,430
If I don't allow you to go, then?
- Parvati.

910
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,830
You don't know what
you are doing, Parvati.

911
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:29,550
I know very well. Because of
fever I come close to you..

912
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:33,270
..again and again. Therefore
you want to go away from me.

913
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,190
Isn't it? But I won't let
you go in this condition.

914
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:39,470
Parvati. - Yes. You hate me.
You don't talk to me.

915
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,910
I won't say anything to you.
I don't ask for love.

916
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:46,590
I don't ask for happiness. But
it is my right to serve you.

917
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:50,630
I just ask for this right.
Don't take it away from me.

918
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:53,150
You can take
everything else if you want.

919
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:58,470
What right you have on whom,
this you don't know Parvati.

920
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:02,790
I.. how can I explain it
to you, that whatever..

921
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:05,110
..you are thinking is wrong?

922
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:08,070
I don't know what is
wrong and what is right.

923
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:11,990
I just want to know
what is my fault, that..

924
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:14,070
..you hate me this much.

925
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:18,590
It is not your fault. And
I don't hate you Parvati.

926
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:21,510
Then why do you keep away from me.

927
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,170
If I tell you something,
will you believe it.

928
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:33,220
If I don't trust you
then whom will I trust?

929
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:37,780
Then listen. Whatever I
have done till today..

930
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,660
..has been for your own good.

931
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,210
I am doing this so
that your future life..

932
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:44,090
..will be full of happiness and joy.

933
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,770
The destiny which is playing
a cruel game with our life..

934
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:50,890
..I am fighting that
destiny for you, Parvati.

935
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,850
And if you are innocent
and I am on the right path..

936
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:57,010
..then one day we will
surely win with this destiny.

937
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:59,650
And on that day you will
understand what I said.

938
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,450
Till that time have patience Parvati.

939
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,610
Till that time, trust me.

940
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:09,690
You care for me this much.
Now I don't want..

941
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,770
..anything else.

942
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:22,730
Hey, Ravi. Come in.

943
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,050
Greetings mother.

944
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,850
God bless you son.
- Hello.

945
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:27,850
She is very angry with you.
She didn't eat anything..

946
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,610
..since morning.
- Really.

947
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,410
No problem. I will appease her.

948
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,010
Alright. Sit son. I
will send tea for you.

949
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,930
You are really very angry
with me. What are you reading?

950
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:50,330
Oh boy! Oh boy! Women in love.

951
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:52,410
There must be a trick
written in this book..

952
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:54,330
..for appeasing the
person who is angry.

953
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:55,650
Let me see it.

954
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:01,410
Oh! Such anger! Hm.

955
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:06,610
Alright then. Come on Ravi son,
a palace where there..

956
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,930
..is no hospitality
shown towards a guest..

957
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,970
..is no better than
our poor little hut.

958
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,770
You have made me miss my breakfast.

959
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,570
Now you want me to miss my lunch.

960
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:27,890
Does this mean that I am
given invitation for lunch?

961
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:31,850
Thank you. But the doctor
advised me against eating.

962
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,370
Doctor! Why? What happened?

963
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:37,290
The doctor said that I have fever.

964
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:41,170
You really find great excuses.

965
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:43,130
Let me see, where the fever is?

966
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,050
Hey. You really have fever.

967
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,090
Why didn't you say so, before?

968
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,250
There was not one to listen. And
I don't like talking to walls.

969
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,410
I am sorry. Come on.
Sit here and rest.

970
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,010
I will call the doctor now.

971
01:15:58,090 --> 01:15:59,890
If you had fever,
then why did you come?

972
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,890
Wow! You are really great.

973
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,690
The justice of beautiful
girls is really strange.

974
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,410
If I come then also I am guilty
and if I don't come then too..

975
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,690
..I am guilty.

976
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,810
Save your poem for later.
Now sit comfortably.

977
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,410
Laxmi.
- Yes.

978
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,530
Nothing.

979
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,930
What is the matter?
You look little lost.

980
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,050
Not at all.
- There is something. What are you..

981
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:22,410
..hiding from me?

982
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,650
No, no. There is nothing to hide.

983
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,370
I am stuck in a minor problem.
I want to tell you but..

984
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:32,650
..then I think that I will
just bother you by telling that.

985
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,010
And there won't be any benefit.

986
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,530
Alright. I you think I
don't deserve to hear it..

987
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:38,850
..then don't say.
- Oh no. I said that you will..

988
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,610
..get unnecessarily worried.

989
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,010
I am hopeful that it will
be solved in 2 - 4 days.

990
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,810
Then I will tell you the whole thing.

991
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,250
Now give me a smile.

992
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:52,530
Come, come.
- Ok, Ok, Ok.

993
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:55,330
I think you are an honest man.
At least you have..

994
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,770
..given me the right address.
You are an honest man.

995
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:01,570
Sir, I was born honest.
But yesterday only..

996
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,370
..I made a mistake by mistake.
- Never mind. Never mind.

997
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,570
Will you have tea?
- Its strange.

998
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,890
You have invited me for
tea only and still asking.

999
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,930
You wait. I will get tea for you.
- Alright. Alright.

1000
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,650
Saroj.. the tea drinker is here.

1001
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,410
No chair to sit. What
kind of people they are?

1002
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,730
Good morning madam. Good morning.

1003
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:32,970
Hey, no answer. She insulted me.

1004
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:39,130
Ravi. You are here.
I mean you are here.

1005
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,690
Brother. You have
entered the wrong room.

1006
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:43,890
My room is there. Come.

1007
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:46,010
I am sorry. I am sorry.
This is your wife's room.

1008
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,210
This is your wife's room.
Your wife is very beautiful.

1009
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:51,570
I mean to say that your
wife is very beautiful.

1010
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:53,130
The way she left from here..

1011
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,970
She is not my wife. She
is brother Ravi's wife.

1012
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:59,810
Oh, never mind, never mind.
I thought she was your wife.

1013
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:05,730
You mean Ravi is married to her.

1014
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,530
No, no. She is married to Ravi.

1015
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:12,530
I thought Ravi was married to her.
- No.

1016
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,930
You mean Ravi is married.

1017
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,330
Ravi got married long before.

1018
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:27,410
Ravi.. Very good news, very good news.

1019
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,650
I will see.

1020
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:33,210
I am saying son that there
should be no delay in wedding.

1021
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,170
Nowadays no one cares
for such old traditions.

1022
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:41,410
There is no need to think son.
You just say 'yes'.

1023
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:43,090
And I will arrange for everything.

1024
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,450
What are you thinking Ravi?
- Sorry.

1025
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:54,770
Let him think madam. If he
needs little time to think..

1026
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,450
..then we should give
him time. It is no good..

1027
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,050
..to force a young man into marriage.

1028
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:03,450
Maybe he has some problem.
- No, no. It is not like that.

1029
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,490
I don't have any problem.
I was just thinking that..

1030
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,250
..if few more days..

1031
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,780
Alright. We too would
need a month or so for..

1032
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,300
..making the arrangements.
After all your wedding..

1033
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,060
..won't be done in such a hurry.

1034
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:17,460
It will be a grand wedding.

1035
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,580
Alright mother. I will go now.
- God bless you son.

1036
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:28,140
Who is it? Oh. Ravi. I am sorry.

1037
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:31,100
Watch where you are going.
- Watch.

1038
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,380
I have watched everything.
Thank you very much Ravi.

1039
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,660
Thank you.

1040
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:39,580
Manager, you start the
work from today. - Yes madam.

1041
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,700
Hello father. Hello.. hello.

1042
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,180
Come, Ladle. You
have come on right time.

1043
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,380
I am always right. I mean I
always come on right time.

1044
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:52,260
Son, prepare the guest list.
And don't leave..

1045
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,460
..anyone's name. Or
they will complain.

1046
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,220
But what for? I mean
what is this invitation for?

1047
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,420
For Laxmi's wedding.
- Wedding.

1048
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,780
Wonderful mother, wonderful.

1049
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,540
Son. You make all
the arrangements and..

1050
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,260
..I will do the wedding next month.

1051
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,660
Next month! But I
can't marry next month.

1052
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,860
I don't have leave.

1053
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:12,100
Hey stupid. This is not your wedding.

1054
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,340
But is Ravi and Laxmi's wedding.

1055
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:19,100
What! With that cheater.
Ravi is already married.

1056
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:21,980
Stupid!

1057
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,300
I am not stupid. I
am telling the truth.

1058
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:27,020
If Ravi does second
marriage then he will be arrested.

1059
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,060
What is this nonsense?

1060
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:31,420
Mother, believe me.
Ravi is cheating you.

1061
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,860
He is already married.
- Really son.

1062
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:34,860
Yes.

1063
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,700
Lie. All this is lie. If
you talk like this then..

1064
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,340
..I will remove both
father and son from this house.

1065
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,340
But this is the truth.
I have seen his wife..

1066
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,260
..myself. She is in her house.

1067
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,100
Are you speaking truth, Ladle?

1068
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:47,180
Let's go Laxmi. We will check it out.

1069
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,700
I don't want to go mother.

1070
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,500
I know my Ravi very well.
If you don't trust him..

1071
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,500
..then you can surely check.

1072
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,220
But after that, these both
won't stay in this house.

1073
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,780
I agree. I mean, I agree.

1074
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:00,260
Mother, you come with me now.
I will show you his wife.

1075
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,740
Sitaram. Get madam's shawl.

1076
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,980
There she is. Check properly.

1077
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,900
This is Ravi and that's his wife.

1078
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,540
You go and see for yourself.

1079
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,860
Greetings mother.

1080
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,100
Who is that girl? Is she your wife?

1081
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:32,100
I will tell you later?
What is left to say later?

1082
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,300
You have ruined the
life of my daughter now..

1083
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,140
..do you want to ruin her life too.

1084
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,700
Shameless. Cheater.

1085
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:41,660
Mother. You are
misunderstanding me, mother.

1086
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,820
You are misunderstanding me.
- Shut up.

1087
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,500
There is a limit to everything.
Today only you were talking..

1088
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,500
..about marriage with Laxmi.
Madam thought of you..

1089
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:55,060
..as your son. And you wanted
to bite her like a black cobra.

1090
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,500
I am not, what you are thinking.

1091
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,140
I.. I.. How can I explain it to you?

1092
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,340
This is all a game of destiny.
I have never betrayed..

1093
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,060
..you mother. Never betrayed you.

1094
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,780
Trust me for God's sake.

1095
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,740
Stop telling more lies, Ravi.
You have married..

1096
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:13,340
..a girl secretly and
kept her here like a thief.

1097
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:15,820
And there you want to ruin
the life of my daughter.

1098
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,700
Mother, just listen to me.
- You cheater, you killer.

1099
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,940
Is there no shame left with you?

1100
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,460
What about your shame?
Don't you feel shame..

1101
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,260
..talking in front of a wife
about her husband's love affair..

1102
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,500
..with your daughter.

1103
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,940
Parvati!

1104
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:30,060
It is a sin even to see
the face of such a person.

1105
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:31,580
Let's go manager.

1106
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:36,700
Mother. Mother. Listen to me.

1107
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:46,900
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

1108
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,300
I couldn't bear when
you were insulted.

1109
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,460
Get aside Parvati. Get aside.

1110
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,700
You don't know what you have done.

1111
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:02,260
Sister-in-law. Have patience,
sister-in-law.

1112
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,380
Have patience.
Everything will be better soon.

1113
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,460
I am feeling suffocated Saroj.
Nothing will be better.

1114
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,700
Sister-in-law. Don't cry.

1115
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:15,020
Now I know why he hates me so much.

1116
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,700
He married me because
of pity. But he loves..

1117
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,420
..someone else, Saroj.

1118
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,700
I have come in the way of his love.
What should I do, Saroj?

1119
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:27,220
Sister-in-law. All this is a lie.
All this is a lie, sister-in-law.

1120
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,540
This is not a lie,
Saroj. This is the truth.

1121
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:36,300
No, no. this can't be true.
This can't be true mother.

1122
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:40,180
Tell me, this is not true.
- This is true daughter.

1123
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,100
This is true.

1124
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,470
Laxmi! Daughter!

1125
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:52,630
Someone call the doctor soon.

1126
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,510
Ramu. Go and call
the doctor immediately.

1127
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:57,390
Son Ladle. Pick her up.

1128
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,430
Doctor. When will she
regain consciousness?

1129
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,270
Don't worry. She will
be up after some time.

1130
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,310
She needs complete rest.

1131
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:32,630
Doctor, she can't get rest in Delhi.

1132
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,870
If you agree, then we
should send her to Musorie.

1133
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:38,670
She will get peace and rest there.

1134
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:43,070
This will be the best. You
should take her immediately.

1135
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:46,310
Alright. I will take
her to Musorie today.

1136
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:48,830
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1137
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:00,430
Where are you going like this?
- To see Laxmi.

1138
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:03,590
Laxmi is ill.
- Ill! What happened to her?

1139
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,990
What do you have to do with that?

1140
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:06,470
You just tell me,
what you want with her?

1141
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:08,430
Manager. You people
have misunderstanding.

1142
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:09,910
I am here to talk to
her and clear her doubts.

1143
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,150
Oh. You are still not satisfied.

1144
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:14,750
Manager.
- You are here to play new tricks.

1145
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,870
If there is any shame left,
then leave immediately.

1146
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:19,750
Or else you will be thrown out.

1147
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:22,550
I will go.

1148
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:28,590
Sitaram. Give her this letter.
- Give this to me.

1149
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:34,390
This is a really bad thing.
- He married someone else..

1150
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,150
..and loves someone else. Let him go.

1151
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,150
I will fix him.

1152
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:50,430
Ravi. Ravi, come out.
- What is it?

1153
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,950
What is this joke?
- Joke!

1154
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,990
My life has become a joke.

1155
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:57,710
Shut up. Aren't you ashamed?
You are educated..

1156
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:58,670
..and still you do such things.

1157
01:25:58,750 --> 01:25:59,870
Ram Swarop, you don't know anything.

1158
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:00,870
So please keep quiet.

1159
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:04,550
I don't know. Whole
world knows about your drama.

1160
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,510
You have a wife and
you are preparing..

1161
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,110
..for your second marriage.
Aren't you ashamed?

1162
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:13,990
Answer me. I say, answer me.

1163
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:18,070
Why are you staring at
my face? Say something.

1164
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:20,550
Do you want me to tell everything?
- Yes.

1165
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:22,510
Do you want me to raise the
curtain from this drama? - Yes.

1166
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:24,310
Then listen. This Parvati..

1167
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:25,590
Ravi!

1168
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:30,870
What is this stupidity, son?

1169
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,430
In your emotions, you
have forgot what is right..

1170
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,110
..and what is wrong?
- Uncle.

1171
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,550
Son, did you forget all
that I explained to you.

1172
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,430
Uncle, you don't know
what is happening here.

1173
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:39,670
My life is getting ruined.

1174
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:41,790
Nothing will be ruined son.
Nothing will be ruined.

1175
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:42,790
Come here with me.

1176
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:44,910
Sit comfortably and
then tell me everything.

1177
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:16,790
Dear Laxmi.

1178
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:21,070
The woman whom mother has
seen taking care of me..

1179
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:24,150
..is not my wife.

1180
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:31,190
'She is an innocent
woman who thinks..'

1181
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:33,590
'..I am her husband,
after the train accident.'

1182
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,030
'I am trying my best
to find her husband.'

1183
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:39,790
'When I find him I will
return to him his wife.'

1184
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:44,510
'But if she finds this out before,
then she will commit suicide.'

1185
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:47,430
'That is why, I
couldn't say in front of her..

1186
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:51,150
'..the truth to your mother.
And took the whole blame.'

1187
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,110
Sister-in-law. What is this madness?

1188
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,350
Fights between husband and
wife take place everywhere..

1189
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:08,030
..but the relationship
doesn't break because of it.

1190
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,230
Saroj, he is not my husband.
He is not my husband.

1191
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,230
What are you saying, sister-in-law?

1192
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:15,630
Yes Saroj. Till today I
was leading a life of a lie.

1193
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:18,470
This is not my house. No
thing here belongs to me.

1194
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,430
Saroj, I don't have any
right to live in this house.

1195
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,230
I don't have right
to live in this world.

1196
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:27,350
Get away from my path.
- No sister-in-law.

1197
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:29,830
Father. Father.

1198
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:31,990
What happened, daughter?
- Father, sister-in-law left.

1199
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:33,150
Where?
- I don't know.

1200
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,790
She was saying that
he is not my husband.

1201
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:42,550
Uncle. She read my letter.
- This is very bad.

1202
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:45,470
She will commit suicide.
- Suicide. No.

1203
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,950
She is drowning. She is drowning.

1204
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:52,510
Why did you save me?
- Lie down daughter. Lie down.

1205
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,310
You should have left me to die.

1206
01:29:54,550 --> 01:29:56,950
What is the matter daughter?
Did you have a fight..

1207
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,030
..with your husband?
- Husband!

1208
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,230
No. no..

1209
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:04,550
No problem. We will
take you to your house.

1210
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:08,430
House. I don't have house.
There is no place left for me..

1211
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:12,670
..in this world. There is no
place for me in this world.

1212
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:18,870
You don't have anyone. Will
you come with us, daughter?

1213
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:23,950
'Parvati!'
- Let's go.

1214
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:32,310
What is your name daughter?
- 'Parvati!'

1215
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:35,670
I am Jamuna.
- Jamuna. Ok.

1216
01:30:40,212 --> 01:30:41,460
Oh. I am really fed up. He
has really made mess here.

1217
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:44,300
Jamuna. You only tell me.
Do you think I can do all..

1218
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,660
..this work in this old age?

1219
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,620
Gopal should get married now.
But who will explain..

1220
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,340
..this to him? I am tried
from telling him to bring..

1221
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,740
..a daughter-in-law in the house.

1222
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:55,100
But this boy doesn't listen to me.

1223
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:58,380
Mother, you let it be. I will do it.

1224
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:09,020
I am really tired of him.
Either he will make paintings..

1225
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,340
..or read books all day.

1226
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,620
He doesn't care about
his mother's feelings.

1227
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,500
Alright son. As long as
I am alive you can do..

1228
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:21,980
..as you wish. But after
that who will do the work.

1229
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,000
Mother. This photo..

1230
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:43,360
This photo.. Keep this photo
locked somewhere, daughter.

1231
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,520
Whenever Gopal sees it, he
gets unnecessarily upset.

1232
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:50,200
I am tired of this photo.
- Why? Whose photo is this?

1233
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:54,080
This is photo of Mr.
Manohar. He married his sister.

1234
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,400
Married! Then where is
the daughter-in-law?

1235
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,880
That is a long story.
While returning there was..

1236
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,400
..train accident and she died in it.

1237
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,200
The day he married her,
that same day he cremated her.

1238
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,160
Is this called a marriage?

1239
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:12,160
Give this photo to me Jamuna.
I will hide it somewhere.

1240
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,760
No mother, no. I
will hide it somewhere.

1241
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,080
I will keep it away
from everyone's sight.

1242
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,960
Alright. First finish the work.

1243
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:01,840
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1244
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,600
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1245
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,760
"Today I have met my darling."

1246
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,320
"Today I have met my darling."

1247
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,680
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1248
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,280
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1249
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:37,400
"After a long time I met
the support of my life."

1250
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:41,880
"Today I have found my lost ones."

1251
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:46,280
"After a long time I met
the support of my life."

1252
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:50,680
"Today I have found my lost ones."

1253
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:55,160
"Sometimes I feel happy
sometimes I feel shy."

1254
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:59,560
"Sometimes tears fall from my eyes."

1255
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:03,960
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1256
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,400
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1257
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:12,640
"Today I have met my darling."

1258
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:17,040
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1259
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:21,440
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1260
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,120
"Give me jewelry
made of stars and sun."

1261
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,480
"Someone make me a bride."

1262
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,800
"Give me jewelry
made of stars and sun."

1263
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,080
"Someone make me a bride."

1264
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,240
"I don't have control on my heart."

1265
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:04,760
"It is the magic of my darling,
that I became mad in love."

1266
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:09,240
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1267
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,640
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1268
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:17,880
"Today I have met my darling."

1269
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,240
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1270
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:26,680
"My anklet is making
a melodious sound."

1271
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:20,240
'Hey, why did you stop?
Go and tell him that..'

1272
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,520
'..you are Parvati. He
thinks that you are dead.'

1273
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,840
'Go and tell him
that you are alive. Go'

1274
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,800
This is not right mother.
I will say again mother.

1275
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,880
It is not right to keep this girl,
Jamuna in the house.

1276
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,920
Why is it not right?
- Oh.

1277
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,800
How can I explain to you? It
is wrong for a married girl..

1278
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,920
..to stay in other man's house.

1279
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,160
Wrong for whom?
- For Jamuna.

1280
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,760
The whole world would doubt her.

1281
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,920
Her own husband would doubt her.

1282
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,360
He will be a stupid
to doubt such a girl.

1283
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,680
It is not stupidity. It
is man's nature to doubt.

1284
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,600
Tomorrow when we
will find her husband..

1285
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,040
..and when he would know
that she was in this house..

1286
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:20,240
..with me, then he
will surely doubt her.

1287
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,760
No man would keep a wife in
his house, in this situation.

1288
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,800
This is the rule of the world.

1289
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,520
I don't accept this rule of the world.

1290
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,800
We have to accept mother. If
your own daughter-in-law..

1291
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,680
..would have stayed this
way in someone's house..

1292
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,960
..then wouldn't you
too have doubted her.

1293
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,040
Would you have accepted her?

1294
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,080
Why would my daughter-in-law
stay like that in other's house?

1295
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,960
She is not my daughter-in-law;
she is a poor destitute girl.

1296
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,960
What do we have to do
with this right and wrong?

1297
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,000
Alright. As you say mother.

1298
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,120
'If your own daughter-in-law..'

1299
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,800
'..would have stayed this
way in someone's house..'

1300
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,000
'..then wouldn't you
too have doubted her.'

1301
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,120
'Would you have accepted her?'

1302
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,520
'Why would my
daughter-in-law stay like that..'

1303
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,200
..in other's house?'

1304
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,120
'If even they doubt me, then..'

1305
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:21,080
Show me the way God. Show me the way.

1306
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,600
You have brought me
to my house. Don't..

1307
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,920
..take away my shelter again.

1308
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:32,240
The world can doubt me,
but you know everything.

1309
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,800
Help me God. Let me
stay under the shelter..

1310
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,760
..of my husband. If I can't
stay here as a daughter-in-law..

1311
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,720
..then at least let me
stay here as a maid.

1312
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,000
I don't ask for anything else.

1313
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,200
I don ask for anything else God.

1314
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:38,520
"Oh! The helplessness of a human!"

1315
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:44,880
"Oh! The helplessness of a human!"

1316
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:51,280
"They are far away in
spite of being so near."

1317
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,520
"They are far away in
spite of being so near."

1318
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,680
"Oh! The helplessness of a human!"

1319
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:22,320
"It is hard to see
anything in the dark."

1320
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:27,960
"No star shows the path."

1321
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:37,160
"Don't know where the
destination of hope is."

1322
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:43,760
"Don't know where the
destination of hope is."

1323
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:50,600
"Oh! The helplessness of a human!"

1324
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:13,560
"Who is aware of the
faith of this light?"

1325
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:20,000
"Whether it will
extinguish or burn for whole night."

1326
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:27,160
"Who is aware of the
faith of this light?"

1327
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:35,240
"Whether it will
extinguish or burn for whole night."

1328
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:43,760
"Whether it will
become flame or smoke."

1329
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:51,240
"Whether it will
become flame or smoke."

1330
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:57,120
"Oh! The helplessness of a human!"

1331
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:04,360
"They are far away in
spite of being so near."

1332
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,320
"They are far away in
spite of being so near."

1333
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:13,200
"Oh! The helplessness of a human!"

1334
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,680
What is this? Where are
you going with this luggage?

1335
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,880
Anywhere. But away from this city.

1336
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,080
Son. I can understand your problem.

1337
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,240
But what will you
achieve by wandering..

1338
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,640
..here and there like a mad person.

1339
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,680
But what is left in this city, uncle?

1340
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,800
There is no news of
poor Parvati for whom..

1341
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,920
..we went through all this trouble.

1342
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,240
And God knows where
they have taken Laxmi.

1343
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,680
I don't know. Without her
this Delhi is a ruin for me.

1344
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,360
I can't stay here uncle. I have to go.

1345
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,440
Hello. Yes sir.

1346
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,920
Doctor. Laxmi's
mother is on the phone.

1347
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,240
Hello, greetings.

1348
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,960
Doctor. Laxmi's
health has deteriorated.

1349
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,720
She doesn't even take
the medicine you gave her.

1350
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,720
Really. These girls
increase their problem a lot.

1351
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,720
Actually. There is
no need for medicine..

1352
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,200
..but we need to explain her.

1353
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,640
No, no. Don't worry. I
will come there soon.

1354
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,240
Daughter. Take this.

1355
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,320
Take the medicine.

1356
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,680
I don't want any medicine.
I don't want! I don't want!

1357
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:58,240
Daughter Laxmi. If you
won't take medicine..

1358
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,320
..then how will you get well soon.

1359
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,560
I don't want to get well mother.
I don't want to.

1360
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,280
No daughter. This
stubbornness is not good.

1361
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,120
Oh. If you bother me
like this then go now..

1362
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,520
..and jump from a mountain.

1363
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,280
Laxmi, Laxmi.

1364
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,640
Ganga. Ganga, stop her.

1365
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,480
Leave me. Let me die.

1366
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,480
You are going to die.
- Yes.

1367
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,120
Alright. Go.

1368
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,480
Yes, yes. Go and die.

1369
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,880
But do you have to jump
from the mountain to die.

1370
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,520
I can tell you an
easy method here only.

1371
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,080
I don't need your advice to die.

1372
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,960
Who are you to give me
advice for committing suicide?

1373
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,440
Who called you here?
- Laxmi!

1374
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:48,560
Don't talk to doctor like this,
daughter. I have called..

1375
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,800
..him here for your treatment.

1376
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,480
I don't need any treatment.
I don't need any doctor.

1377
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,480
You think you are doing
a brave thing by trying..

1378
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,640
..to commit suicide.

1379
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,840
Listen Laxmi. Let me
explain you one thing.

1380
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:15,440
Doctor, don't explain me anything.
Just go from here.

1381
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,120
You just know to give advice.
You are happy.

1382
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:21,400
How will you come to
know of others sorrow?

1383
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,920
Who told you that I
don't have any sorrow?

1384
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,440
Laxmi. In this world,
show me one person..

1385
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,800
..who has no sorrow in his life.

1386
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:33,240
The difference is that
few weak people like you..

1387
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,880
..cry because of
sorrow and few people..

1388
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,640
..smile till their last breath.

1389
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,360
Doctor, when the heart is on
fire then it is hard to smile.

1390
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:45,560
You are talking of fire.
Why should a person be like..

1391
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:48,680
..a fire which burns
everything around him?

1392
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,240
He should be like the fire of a lamp..

1393
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,000
..which gives other light by burning.

1394
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,040
A lamp can give light to others.
But an unfortunate girl..

1395
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,800
..like me whose whole life
is full of darkness of grief..

1396
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,880
..how can she give
happiness to others.

1397
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,800
There is nothing left in my life.

1398
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,040
This is your illusion, Laxmi.

1399
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:16,240
Your life which you think
is in vain and want to end..

1400
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,360
..this same life can
give happiness to millions..

1401
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,160
..if you want.

1402
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:26,360
I can bring happiness
in someone's life. I!

1403
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,800
Yes you. If you want.

1404
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,400
How?

1405
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,720
Come at the window
with me. I will tell you.

1406
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,360
Get up.

1407
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:53,640
Do you see that incomplete building?

1408
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:56,200
Do you know what it is?
- No I don't know.

1409
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,800
It is a hospital of blind people.
People who are left..

1410
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,680
..with only darkness in their life.

1411
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,480
They need you. If you
want you can bring..

1412
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,880
..happiness in their life.

1413
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,680
But what can I do for them, doctor?

1414
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,160
Mother said that you are a
good dancer. Is it true?

1415
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,600
Yes. But.. dance!

1416
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,680
Laxmi, we need million
of rupees to complete..

1417
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,840
..this building which we don't have.

1418
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:24,600
If you do a charity
show for the hospital..

1419
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,480
..then it will be great help.

1420
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,440
Million of blind
will give you blessings.

1421
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,480
No doctor. I can't dance.

1422
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,360
I can't dance.
- Why not?

1423
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:38,080
This will not only help them,
but you too would..

1424
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,080
..realize that your
life is not in vain.

1425
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:41,680
It is of use to someone.

1426
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,800
Laxmi, if you bring
happiness in the life of million of..

1427
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,960
..helpless people, then your
life too would become happy.

1428
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,760
You would have peace in your life.

1429
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:29,080
These eyes.

1430
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:42,640
What all scenes do the eyes show?
Sometimes it makes you laugh..

1431
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:50,680
..sometimes it makes you cry, and
sometimes the eyes make you mad.

1432
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,440
What all scenes do the eyes show?

1433
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,480
What all scenes do the eyes show?

1434
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,120
The eyes have a pink thread.

1435
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:28,120
The eyes have a pink thread.

1436
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:31,840
If you see in fun,
then becomes drunkard.

1437
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,720
If it breaks then it
becomes a trouble to the heart.

1438
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:39,920
If it breaks then it
becomes a trouble to the heart.

1439
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:44,880
The eyes drive away
the sleep at night.

1440
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,800
The eyes drive away
the sleep at night.

1441
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,640
Sometimes it makes you laugh..

1442
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:56,320
.. sometimes it makes you cry, and
sometimes the eyes makes you mad.

1443
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,160
What all scenes does the eye show?

1444
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:22,400
In a moment the eyes becomes stranger.

1445
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:29,640
In a moment the eyes becomes stranger.

1446
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,320
It becomes untruthful to us.

1447
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:41,320
Eyelids curse the eyes.
Eyelids curse the eyes.

1448
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:46,640
The eyes aim the target so well.

1449
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:50,320
The eyes aim the target so well.

1450
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:54,120
Sometimes it makes you laugh..

1451
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:57,920
..sometimes it makes you cry, and
sometimes the eyes makes you mad.

1452
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,720
What all scenes the eyes show you.

1453
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:05,160
What all scenes the eyes show you.

1454
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:23,560
Staying in this world
and did not see the world,

1455
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:29,680
what kind of compulsion is this?

1456
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:44,120
Somebody give me eyes
also and fulfill our wishes.

1457
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:58,680
Constraint is a big thing in life,
they got darkness in light.

1458
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,640
They count their days
without a patron, they

1459
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:13,440
count their days without a patron.

1460
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:18,880
The eyes make you
wander and to stumble..

1461
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:23,800
The eyes make you
wander and to stumble

1462
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,160
Sometimes it makes you laugh..

1463
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:33,240
..sometimes it makes you cry, and
sometimes the eyes makes you mad.

1464
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:42,520
What all scenes the eyes show you.
What all scenes the eyes show you.

1465
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,200
Today the Palav is very good.
Who has made it?

1466
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,560
Jamuna has made it, who else.

1467
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:01,640
Is it? Jamuna, how much you work,
alone? How will we repay you back..

1468
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,680
..for whatever you have done for us?

1469
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,080
To work in your own house,
there is no need of payment.

1470
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,640
Mother, since this girl
has come in this house..

1471
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:13,320
..she has changed the
whole structure of the house.

1472
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:15,560
Now you understood?
If there is a woman

1473
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,480
in the house the house becomes heaven.

1474
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:20,000
That is the reason, I
always tell you to get married.

1475
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:23,480
After marrying, you should be happy,
even that is a kind of luck.

1476
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,640
What is the guarantee of
this that after marriage..

1477
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,880
.. you would get a
daughter-in-law like Jamuna?

1478
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:31,760
Why will we not get? That is
the reason I pray to God daily.

1479
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,240
Enough, you always keep
praying for your happiness.

1480
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,640
Pray for her this poor lady also,
so that she gets her husband back..

1481
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,880
..and she stays with
him happily at his house.

1482
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:44,280
I do pray for her
also son, but God knows

1483
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,400
when this poor
lady's luck will strike.

1484
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,800
I feel bad for that
unlucky guy mother..

1485
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,200
..whose wife is like a goddess..

1486
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,520
..and he is unaware from
her helping nature character.

1487
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,920
Hello, can I come inside?

1488
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:10,000
Oh! You? Salutations mother.

1489
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,400
Long live son.

1490
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:13,000
How come you forgot
the way and came here?

1491
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:15,640
We thought, daily
doctor comes to our house..

1492
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,120
..so why not we will
go to his house today?

1493
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,640
Oh! It is nice.

1494
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:22,080
Come, come sister. Today you have
sanctified the poor people's hut.

1495
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,520
Live long daughter, live long.

1496
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:28,480
Come, come. Please sit.

1497
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:30,880
Salutations.

1498
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,560
Live long daughter.

1499
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:39,280
Hey! The house is very beautiful.

1500
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:46,840
Doctor, you have nice
paintings at your house.

1501
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:47,880
Yes.

1502
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:49,800
He is mad about paintings

1503
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,040
Go upstairs and see how
many paintings he has made.

1504
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,160
Doctor, you have painted all these?

1505
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:00,160
No, it is just a hobby. I
just scratch lines zigzag.

1506
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:04,240
Do you call them as zigzag lines?
Let me see, where are those paintings?

1507
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:05,320
It is upstairs.

1508
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,640
It is upstairs? Then
why are we standing here?

1509
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:09,520
Come let's go on the top.

1510
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:12,120
Don't get scared, I will not rob them.

1511
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:14,200
Nothing like that, come, come.

1512
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,760
Go, go.

1513
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,120
Ladies first.

1514
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,480
Oh, thank you.

1515
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,040
Very nice.

1516
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,920
Daughter-in-law, where are you going?

1517
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,200
Yes, nowhere.

1518
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:36,520
Guests have come,
arrange some sweets for them.

1519
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:38,160
Okay, mother.

1520
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:52,880
What to tell you sister. I can
never forget your gratefulness.

1521
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,840
Your son has given
my Laxmi a new life.

1522
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,080
After a decade I am hearing her laugh.

1523
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:00,480
Gopal is also
concerned about Laxmi. He

1524
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:02,680
was getting ready to go to your house.

1525
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,160
He was very impressed by
seeing her dance that day.

1526
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,280
Sister, Laxmi is the one
who should be praised.

1527
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:10,560
She is your daughter only.

1528
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:15,440
Why not. Believe me, since Laxmi
has come my house has enlightened.

1529
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,920
Actually sister, it is a
too big house. Without

1530
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:20,440
daughter-in-law it looks empty.

1531
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:26,280
When I see them together, I think,
how nice couple would they make.

1532
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,160
Sister, ghee and sugar in your mouth.

1533
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:31,200
If a daughter-in-law like Laxmi
comes in this house, what else I want?

1534
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,920
Did you hear that Jamuna?

1535
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:34,120
What mother?

1536
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:39,120
She is talking about Gopal
getting married with Laxmi.

1537
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,640
What!

1538
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,440
Jamuna, Jamuna.

1539
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,320
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

1540
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,840
Gopal, Gopal.

1541
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:58,120
What happened mother?

1542
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,760
She got struck to the lamp.

1543
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:05,080
Jamuna, Jamuna.
Mother, she has fainted.

1544
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,760
She is injured severely,
take her on top.

1545
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,880
Nandu, Nandu, come here a little.

1546
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:11,560
Nandu, lift her a bit.

1547
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:13,560
Move mother, I will lift her.

1548
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,360
There is nothing to worry mother.
She will be okay very soon.

1549
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,720
I am feeling very bad, we have
created a new problem to you.

1550
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,800
No sister, why do you think like that?

1551
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:37,560
You have brought such a
beautiful girl to our house.

1552
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,640
I am sorry. Your
photos are left in between.

1553
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,480
No problem. I will
come to see the photos

1554
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,240
some other time, if you permit me.

1555
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,280
Of course, of course, you
are always welcome here.

1556
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,480
What are you talking dear;
this is your house only.

1557
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,120
Okay sister, we will leave now.

1558
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,440
Let's leave.

1559
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:56,680
Bye.

1560
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:57,800
Bye.

1561
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,120
No, no, no.

1562
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,200
What son, is she conscious now?

1563
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,280
If she would become conscious
then she would have trouble.

1564
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,440
So I gave her an injection,
by which she

1565
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,520
would be unconscious for 2-4 hours.

1566
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,600
Sir, you have got this letter.
- Letter ?

1567
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:29,040
Manohar, mother Manohar is alive.

1568
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:29,920
Manohar?

1569
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,360
Yes mother, our Manohar.
Parvathi's brother.

1570
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,560
What? He is alive?

1571
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,360
Look at this letter. He is
reaching Missouri today.

1572
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:41,040
Now where are you going?

1573
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:43,760
I am going to the motorcar stand.
He would be reaching.

1574
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:50,440
Gopal, Parvati. Is
there anybody at home?

1575
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,160
Manohar!

1576
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,680
Gopal!

1577
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:03,480
Hey brother, where are you? Gopal.

1578
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,760
Manohar, Manohar.

1579
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:11,040
Gopal, at last I came to you.

1580
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,760
What happened to your eyes Manohar?

1581
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,920
Nothing. I met with an accident.

1582
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:22,640
But seeing you happy, I am
not worried about the eyes.

1583
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:24,120
You reached safely, right?

1584
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:28,560
Yes, but where did you go?
I searched you everywhere.

1585
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:33,080
I got a hurt on my head and I
was swept away in the ocean.

1586
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:37,240
Some villagers helped me and
kept me with them for many days.

1587
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:40,920
As soon as I was able to walk
and roam about, I came here.

1588
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,120
You did a great job Manohar.
You did a great job.

1589
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:50,040
Why there is so much
silence in the house.

1590
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:51,800
Why can't I hear anybody else?

1591
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:54,600
Hey brother, where is
Parvathi and where is mother?

1592
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,560
Mother, mother is upstairs.

1593
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:59,840
Come let's go up. Come
let's go. Come here.

1594
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,840
Parvathi.

1595
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,640
Mother, see who has come?

1596
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,280
Salutations mother.

1597
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,520
Hey!

1598
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,920
Salutations mother.

1599
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:29,320
What happened? Manohar, what
happened to your eyes son?

1600
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:32,480
You can get
treatment for eyes also, but

1601
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:35,880
this is a happy news
that his life is saved.

1602
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:39,560
Mother, our Manohar was swept
away in water. Villagers saved him.

1603
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,840
Tell it slowly son, she will wake up.

1604
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:45,080
Who will wake up? Parvathi? Where
is Parvathi? What happened to her?

1605
02:01:45,160 --> 02:01:47,680
She is not Parvathi son.
She is Jamuna.

1606
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:52,400
Jamuna? Gopal who is Jamuna?

1607
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:55,520
No one Manohar. She is
a sad destitute girl.

1608
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:57,520
Mother has made her as her daughter.

1609
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:04,600
Gopal, you get Manohar downstairs.
I will make tea and snacks for you.

1610
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,360
Come Manohar, let's go downstairs.

1611
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:16,640
Gopal, I did not hear
Parvathi's voice. Isn't she at home?

1612
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,320
No.

1613
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,240
Has she gone out somewhere?

1614
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,360
She is not in Missouri Manohar.

1615
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,840
Then where is she?

1616
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,160
You come downstairs.
We will sit and talk.

1617
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,360
Manohar, don't get scared, I will

1618
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:32,320
get your eyes treated
from a famous doctor.

1619
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:40,880
Gopal. Is my Parvathi there are
not there. My swear to you Gopal.

1620
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:48,640
Don't lie to your blind friend.
My Parvathi is there or not there?

1621
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,240
No she is not there.

1622
02:02:55,440 --> 02:03:01,000
Manohar, Manohar, Manohar.
Please become conscious.

1623
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,640
Come let's go down.

1624
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:09,200
Come let's go.
Manohar, Manohar, Manohar.

1625
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:15,640
Manohar, Manohar,
Manohar. Come let's go down.

1626
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:24,120
Manohar, Manohar,
Manohar. Listen to me Manohar.

1627
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:30,000
Manohar, Manohar, Manohar. Listen
to me Manohar. Become conscious.

1628
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,560
Become conscious Manohar.
Don't become mad.

1629
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:36,200
Be brave, Manohar. Be brave.

1630
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,160
It was God's wish.

1631
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:39,920
Why was God's wish something like

1632
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I would have died
and she would be alive?

1633
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:50,240
I sacrificed all my happiness to her,
couldn't I give my life to her?

1634
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:56,360
At least once God would have
asked me. Why doesn't he ask me?

1635
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:57,360
Sit down.

1636
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:59,040
Why doesn't he ask me?

1637
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:00,280
Sit down.

1638
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:18,200
Okay Gopal, I will leave now.

1639
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:21,280
No Manohar, I will not
let you go. You can't

1640
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,320
go from here. I will
get your eyes treated.

1641
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:28,440
I don't was to get treated. I
don't have my Parvathi in this world.

1642
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:33,520
What will I do seeing the world?
Let me go Gopal, let me go.

1643
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,640
The wrights that you
have on Parvathi, you

1644
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:39,440
don't have any wrights on her husband.

1645
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:40,480
Gopal.

1646
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:47,960
Parvathi is no more, but she has
left a relationship tie between us.

1647
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:51,440
For the sake of that relationship,
I tell you

1648
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:53,320
Manohar, this house is
Parvathi's till today.

1649
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,200
Gopal.

1650
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:57,640
I need you for sharing my sorrows.
I need you Manohar.

1651
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:59,520
Gopal.

1652
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,640
Dr. Gopal. I don't
guarantee you that with

1653
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:20,480
operation his eyes
are going to be okay.

1654
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,240
But then to, I will try.

1655
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:28,720
Okay, doctor if you have time,
then do the operation right now.

1656
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,040
Okay, then sent the patient to the
operation theatre. I will get ready.

1657
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:34,840
Nurse.
- Yes doctor?

1658
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,640
You take him to the
operation theatre. - Yes doctor.

1659
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:37,480
Come let's go.

1660
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:38,840
Okay Manohar.

1661
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:54,480
Hey Jamuna, just see whose call is it?

1662
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,920
Tell them, doctor is
not there at home.

1663
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,120
Hello.

1664
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,760
Doctor is not there at home.

1665
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,878
Jamuna, I am Gopal speaking.

1666
02:06:08,213 --> 02:06:09,345
What is the matter?

1667
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:12,120
The matter is nothing;
just tell mother that

1668
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:14,480
Manohar's eyes are getting operated.

1669
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,120
I will come a bit late.

1670
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:18,320
Manohar? Who is Manohar?

1671
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:21,600
You don't know him, just tell mother.
She knows everything.

1672
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:25,820
What? Hello, hello.

1673
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:29,580
Who was it Jamuna?

1674
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:34,020
He had called up mother,
I mean doctor's call.

1675
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:35,780
What did he tell?

1676
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:39,700
He told that Manohar is
getting operated. He would come late.

1677
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:40,580
Okay.

1678
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:42,820
Mother, who is this Manohar?

1679
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:46,340
Hey, the same Manohar, Gopal's
friend, whom we used to think..

1680
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:50,460
..in accident he also would
have died along with his sister.

1681
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:54,340
Mother, is he alive?

1682
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:56,980
He is alive, but he has lost his eyes.

1683
02:06:57,580 --> 02:07:01,740
Poor guy has become blind. Gopal
has taken him to his hospital.

1684
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:19,580
Jamuna, where are you going?

1685
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:22,340
I, potato, potatoes
have finished mother; I

1686
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:24,140
am going to buy them in market.

1687
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:26,700
So, why do you want to go? Send Nandu.

1688
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:31,860
Nandu? Nandu is not there mother.
I will only get it mother.

1689
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:33,740
Okay. Get it fast.

1690
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:45,700
Where is Manohar?

1691
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:46,980
I don't know.

1692
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:50,100
Where is Manohar?

1693
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,060
Who is Manohar?

1694
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:53,340
The one who got operated now.
Has the operation finished?

1695
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:54,300
Yes finished.

1696
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:55,420
His eyes are okay now?

1697
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:56,900
Not now, after 10
days when the bandage

1698
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,860
is removed then we will come to know.

1699
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:59,260
Where is he?

1700
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,740
See there, they are getting him.

1701
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:14,940
Who are you?

1702
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:16,820
I, that..

1703
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,220
Jamuna, how come you are here?

1704
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:22,420
Who, me, I have come to you.

1705
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:24,260
Why, what is the matter?

1706
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,900
Matter? Matter is nothing.

1707
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:30,780
I just came to tell you that, give
me a job as a nurse in your hospital.

1708
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:33,540
Nurse? What will you
do becoming a nurse?

1709
02:08:33,860 --> 02:08:36,940
Here so many helpless people come,
I will look after them.

1710
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:39,020
You know a nurse's job?

1711
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:44,140
I know to look after them.
I will look after them.

1712
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:47,340
I always have very little work
at home. It becomes over soon.

1713
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:49,140
The rest of the day goes waste.

1714
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:53,140
Doctor, can I finish my
house work and can I come here?

1715
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:56,140
Okay dear, okay, but why
you want to plead so much?

1716
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:58,340
If you feel satisfied
by looking after the

1717
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,580
helpless people, then come down.

1718
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:02,340
I will tell mother also. Nurse.

1719
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:03,060
Yes doctor.

1720
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:04,980
This girl whenever she comes,
whomever she wants to help..

1721
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:06,540
..let her do.

1722
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:07,380
Okay doctor.

1723
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:08,940
Now you are happy?

1724
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:11,420
Come let us go doctor.

1725
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:16,980
Look here, you first
want to help him. Sit here.

1726
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:19,380
As soon as he gets consciousness,
tell me.

1727
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:24,340
Yes, if he asks for water, don't
give him water. There ice is kept.

1728
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:26,380
Give him a small ice cube.

1729
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:41,740
Are you having pain? Shall I massage?

1730
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,540
What do you want?

1731
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:53,660
Water.

1732
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:59,380
Water, water. I will get it
right now. I will get it right now.

1733
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:10,540
Take.

1734
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:16,140
Is it paining badly?

1735
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:25,380
Pain, how much will it pain. I
have gone to the extremes of pain.

1736
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:30,060
Who are you?

1737
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:35,300
Me? I am a nurse here.

1738
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:42,700
Oh! Your voice resembles my sister's.

1739
02:10:43,780 --> 02:10:49,340
I feel sometimes as if my
Parvathi is sitting next to me.

1740
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:55,460
For some time think me
as Parvathi, brother.

1741
02:10:56,020 --> 02:11:00,340
Long live, long live.

1742
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:30,020
Laxmi, again the same sadness.

1743
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:34,340
No, not at all. I am not sad. I
was thinking, if I tell doctor that..

1744
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:38,220
..I have collected 32000
as funds, he would be happy.

1745
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:43,420
You can cheat the world with
your laugh, but not your mother.

1746
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:47,340
Mother, I am not
cheating you. I am trying

1747
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:49,540
to keep you happy with my whole heart.

1748
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:52,860
If you really want to keep me happy,
then why don't you listen to me?

1749
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:55,540
Daughter, Dr. Gopal is a nice guy.

1750
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:58,740
Mother. Again you
started talking about marriage.

1751
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:03,220
I laugh for you and sing for you,
that is more than enough.

1752
02:12:03,460 --> 02:12:07,420
Please don't force for marriage.
My heart doesn't agree.

1753
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:12,520
You have mistaken me. I
am treating that girl.

1754
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:14,120
I don't have any
plans of marrying her.

1755
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:16,760
You mean, doctor who treats
the patient, cannot marry her.

1756
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:18,840
I can, but I don't
have any intentions.

1757
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:22,240
Why don't you have intention?
Till when will you remain trapped..

1758
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:24,800
..with these old bones
and this routine Gopal?

1759
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,360
If not about you, at least think
about mother's happiness, son.

1760
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:35,040
For your happiness, why do you
forget that what will Manohar think?

1761
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,920
From this marriage, why you
want to put salt on his wounds.

1762
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:40,680
Mother, forget this matter.

1763
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:45,160
Take, drink the medicine.

1764
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,440
Thank you sister.

1765
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:07,680
Brother, from so many days,
I want to tell you something.

1766
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,120
Me? Tell me what is the matter?

1767
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:15,080
Brother, I am in a big confusion.

1768
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:19,040
I want to tell you my story
and take solution from you.

1769
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:21,640
Yes, yes sister, tell
me what is the matter?

1770
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:27,480
Destiny has played a
big game with me brother.

1771
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:35,080
By fault I am staying with a stranger
man thinking him to be my husband.

1772
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:38,400
But how did this
misunderstanding happen?

1773
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:43,280
It is a matter of those days brother,
when after marriage..

1774
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:46,240
..I was going in a
closed litter, then..

1775
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:47,560
Then?

1776
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,680
In a dense forest, it became night.

1777
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:55,760
That night there was
a strange tornado.

1778
02:13:56,440 --> 02:14:00,720
In that tornado we all
separated from each other.

1779
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:06,160
And wandering I went off
into another marriage hall.

1780
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,480
Then?

1781
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:14,040
The person who was not my husband,
I thought him as my husband.

1782
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:17,640
Hey! Then did the bridegroom
also think you as his bride.

1783
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:24,200
Yes, some days even he had
the same misunderstanding.

1784
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:31,520
But brother, God saved me
from being sacrilegious..

1785
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:34,200
..before that I came
to know the truth.

1786
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:38,280
But world, world will
not believe this truth.

1787
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:41,560
What proof you have
that you are sacred?

1788
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:49,080
Then what happened? Did you come
to know about your husband or not?

1789
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,840
His address, I have come to know his

1790
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:55,320
address, but I am in a big confusion.

1791
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:58,280
This is what I want to ask you.

1792
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:03,440
In these circumstances should
I tell him my reality or not.

1793
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,400
This is a very confusing question.

1794
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:10,840
I would give you a
solution is till the time

1795
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:13,400
you prove your truth and sacredness..

1796
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:15,840
..telling your husband about this,

1797
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:18,960
..only shamefulness and betrayers,
and it would be dangerous.

1798
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:22,160
I feel very pity on your state.

1799
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:29,080
Sometimes I feel, I
have a brother in this

1800
02:15:29,960 --> 02:15:31,440
world, would go and
ask help from him..

1801
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:34,000
No, sister. Never do like this.

1802
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:34,760
Why?

1803
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,600
It is even worst than this.

1804
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,240
Why brother?

1805
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:42,840
Sister, the truth is, in our society,
a woman's reprehension..

1806
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:47,720
..more than husband, causes more
pain to father and brother's dignity.

1807
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:50,520
Husband might even forgive you..

1808
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:55,240
..but father and brother can never
tolerate their girl's reprehension.

1809
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,360
Are you crying sister?

1810
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:02,240
No brother.

1811
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:08,600
You at least asked me. You told
me everything as your brother.

1812
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,729
I know you are innocent, but society

1813
02:16:12,893 --> 02:16:16,305
would not accept this.
No one will accept it.

1814
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:19,360
Manohar.

1815
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:22,160
Mother, salutations.

1816
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,920
How are you Manohar?

1817
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:28,120
What brother, this new
nurse works properly or not.

1818
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:33,640
She is very nice. Gopal,
this poor lady is very sad.

1819
02:16:33,719 --> 02:16:36,559
Manohar, I have come to talk
to you a very important thing.

1820
02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:37,639
Tell me mother.

1821
02:16:37,719 --> 02:16:39,679
Mother, I had told you not to tell.

1822
02:16:39,879 --> 02:16:41,119
You started talking the
same thing with Manohar.

1823
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:43,320
Then whom do I tell.
It is because of him

1824
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:44,760
only you are ignoring marriage, right?

1825
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,040
Manohar, you tell me. Parvathi
is not going to return back now.

1826
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,720
Because of her is he going to
sit like this whole of his life?

1827
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:54,840
Son, I have already given
a word to Laxmi's mother.

1828
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:57,560
It is a nice house.
She is a nice girl.

1829
02:16:57,719 --> 02:17:00,519
If I force him, he tells it
will cause pain to Manohar.

1830
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:02,879
Mother, I won't let you
trouble Manohar like this.

1831
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:06,559
Being a doctor, I again warn you,
don't talk to him all these things.

1832
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:09,480
Hello, doctor.

1833
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:11,960
Hello Laxmi, come.

1834
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:13,440
Come sister.

1835
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:18,959
So, you are here. Look, in
search of you where all we reach.

1836
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:19,920
Thank you.

1837
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,280
I have not yet told you the
real thing of telling thanks.

1838
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:24,520
Do you know, for the blind hospital..

1839
02:17:24,639 --> 02:17:26,639
..how much funds I have collected?

1840
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:27,479
How much?

1841
02:17:27,559 --> 02:17:31,799
32000 rupees. I have wandered in
all the bungalows of Missouri.

1842
02:17:31,879 --> 02:17:34,279
Wonderful. You have done a miracle.

1843
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:36,720
Manohar, this is Laxmi Devi.

1844
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:38,839
We wanted to build a
hospital for blind people..

1845
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,720
..she has done many
shows for that and look

1846
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:43,359
how much funds she has collected.

1847
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:49,400
Laxmi devi, from all the
blind people, I thank you.

1848
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:53,720
Tell thanks to doctor
who showed me this way.

1849
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,680
If you have so much sympathy
towards blind people, then..

1850
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:59,640
..can you give
something to this blind man?

1851
02:17:59,719 --> 02:18:01,119
What do you want?

1852
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:12,760
I want a sister. I had a sister,
which God snatched it from me.

1853
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:18,640
If you think I am worth, then think
me as your younger sister, brother.

1854
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:24,040
Did you tell brother from the
heart or sympathized a blind man.

1855
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:28,520
I have told it from the heart,
from the heart.

1856
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:32,800
If you have told me brother,
then you have to obey your brother.

1857
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,480
Order me brother.

1858
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:43,800
Laxmi, Laxmi, I have a very big
debt on me, please repay that, sister.

1859
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:47,120
Debt, whose debt brother?

1860
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:49,960
Gopal's mother.

1861
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:54,230
Laxmi, I had decided to make my
sister as her daughter-in-law..

1862
02:18:54,309 --> 02:19:00,269
..and give it in her foot steps,
but death took her on the way.

1863
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:04,470
Now that you have become my sister,
please fulfill my decision.

1864
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:05,749
Brother.

1865
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:10,710
Laxmi, in this house my sister's
place is empty. Please fill that.

1866
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:11,504
I can't see this house empty.

1867
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:12,690
Manohar.
- No, Gopal.

1868
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:13,665
What are you talking Manohar?

1869
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:17,630
You have done many favors on me,
please do one more favor.

1870
02:19:17,930 --> 02:19:20,490
Accept this marriage proposal,
for my sake, for me.

1871
02:19:20,730 --> 02:19:25,010
This is my younger sister
and she is only Parvathi.

1872
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:28,370
Accept her Gopal, accept her.

1873
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:48,050
Save my honor, God.

1874
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:57,650
Save my honor, God

1875
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:13,730
Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God

1876
02:20:13,970 --> 02:20:21,890
Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God

1877
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:26,130
This destitute girl has
come under your shelter."

1878
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:34,130
Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God

1879
02:20:43,530 --> 02:20:51,770
Leaving your door God,
who else's door will I go?

1880
02:20:51,850 --> 02:20:59,210
Leaving your door God,
who else's door will I go?

1881
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:07,290
Who else is my support other
than you, whom will I trust.

1882
02:21:07,530 --> 02:21:11,530
Tell this Krishna Murari

1883
02:21:11,610 --> 02:21:19,810
Save my honor, God. Save my honor, God

1884
02:21:31,010 --> 02:21:38,410
"My whole life is
getting ruined in this storm."

1885
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:43,330
"Everywhere there is darkness."

1886
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:46,530
"No one to help me out."

1887
02:21:46,770 --> 02:21:51,250
"There is a great storm."

1888
02:21:55,180 --> 02:22:02,860
"Give me strength.
Give me strength, God."

1889
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:10,900
"Save my honor, God.
Save my honor, God."

1890
02:22:10,980 --> 02:22:14,780
"This destitute girl has
come under your shelter."

1891
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:23,260
"Save my honor, God.
Save my honor, God."

1892
02:22:25,220 --> 02:22:28,180
Hey. We are ruined.
Everything is destroyed.

1893
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:29,980
All my plans have failed.

1894
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:31,780
What happened?
- Nothing, fool.

1895
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:35,260
Madam is marrying Laxmi
with some doctor Gopal..

1896
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:37,140
..in Missouri. And she
has not even called us.

1897
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:38,380
This all is you fault.

1898
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:40,780
What is my fault in this?
- No it is my fault..

1899
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:43,060
..that I gave birth
to a fool like you.

1900
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:31,780
God. I have only one wish,
that he should be happy.

1901
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:33,580
Always happy.

1902
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:39,780
Give me your blessing so
that I can serve him as a maid.

1903
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:42,700
Where is Jamuna?
- I don't know mother.

1904
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:46,140
Jamuna. Oh. Jamuna.

1905
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:49,540
Daughter, what are you doing here?

1906
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:51,540
Take this. I have
brought clothes for you.

1907
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:55,820
For me.
- Yes, get ready soon. You have to..

1908
02:23:55,900 --> 02:23:58,340
..to apply Heena on the
hands of the bride. - Heena!

1909
02:23:58,420 --> 02:24:00,980
Yes. The girls are
waiting for you outside.

1910
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:03,020
Get ready and come soon.

1911
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:28,260
"Oh friend! Get ready and
go to your husband's house."

1912
02:24:28,580 --> 02:24:38,060
"Oh friend! Get ready and
go to your husband's house."

1913
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:50,540
"You be happy and don't
worry about my tears."

1914
02:24:50,980 --> 02:25:00,140
"Oh friend! Get ready and
go to your husband's house."

1915
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:07,020
"One house is getting ruined
and one is getting ready."

1916
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:12,620
"This is the rule of this world."

1917
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:26,260
"Go bride and don't
look back to see.."

1918
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:31,860
"..the conditions of your friends."

1919
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:45,660
"Everyone's destiny is different."

1920
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:52,100
"Someone wins while someone loses."

1921
02:25:52,180 --> 02:26:01,820
"Oh friend! Get ready and
go to your husband's house."

1922
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:15,380
Where is the groom's sister?
- Sister!

1923
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:18,700
Where is Jamuna?
What Jamuna is not here?

1924
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:21,140
You came, daughter.

1925
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:26,340
Come. Come fast.

1926
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:31,260
Hold this plate. And perform
the 'Aarti' ceremony. - I?

1927
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:34,020
Yes, yes. This ceremony is
performed by the sisters.

1928
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:39,220
But I am not a sister. I am a maid.

1929
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:42,300
No, you are just like my daughter.

1930
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,500
Come on. The auspicious
time has come. Do it fast.

1931
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:47,380
No mother, I can't do this.

1932
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:51,780
I can't do this.
Don't force me to do it.

1933
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:56,940
Doctor, I can see. I can
see everything doctor.

1934
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:59,580
Look, this telephone. This book.

1935
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:03,260
This newspaper. I can read.

1936
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:05,860
Look this is 'Times'.
This is 'Statement.'

1937
02:27:05,980 --> 02:27:08,460
This is 'National Age'.
This is 'Navbharat Times.'

1938
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:17,540
What? Parvati is alive. Parvati.

1939
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:19,500
Parvati is alive.

1940
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:22,980
'Your voice is just like my sister.'

1941
02:27:23,210 --> 02:27:25,690
'Think of me, as
your Parvati. Brother.'

1942
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:28,650
'I have a brother too.'

1943
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:31,050
Where are you?

1944
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:38,330
No I can't do this. I can't do this.

1945
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:42,210
Gopal! Gopal!

1946
02:27:44,610 --> 02:27:47,970
Gopal! Parvati is alive.

1947
02:27:48,050 --> 02:27:50,530
Parati is alive.
- Parvati is alive.

1948
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:53,090
Yes, yes. That nurse is Parvati.

1949
02:27:53,170 --> 02:27:54,450
Nurse! Jamuna.

1950
02:27:54,530 --> 02:27:56,530
She is not Jamuna, she is Parvati.

1951
02:27:56,730 --> 02:27:59,490
Where is she?
- She ran from here just now.

1952
02:28:09,650 --> 02:28:13,330
Parvati! Where are you running?

1953
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:16,250
Is Ravi here?
- Ravi!

1954
02:28:16,330 --> 02:28:18,050
Ravi! What is Ravi going to do here?

1955
02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:20,450
We have misunderstood him.

1956
02:28:20,570 --> 02:28:22,930
Ravi is looking everywhere for Laxmi.

1957
02:28:23,050 --> 02:28:25,330
Don't stop me. Let me go. Please.

1958
02:28:25,410 --> 02:28:27,450
For God's sake, let me go.

1959
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:30,250
You listen to me. You are mistaken.
You read this.

1960
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:32,930
Laxmi, Ravi wanted to
give this letter to you.

1961
02:28:33,010 --> 02:28:35,530
You will know the truth
if you read this once.

1962
02:28:35,610 --> 02:28:37,970
Just read it one time, daughter.

1963
02:28:38,290 --> 02:28:40,650
Never. I won't let you go like this.

1964
02:28:43,570 --> 02:28:44,810
Parvati.

1965
02:28:49,970 --> 02:28:51,490
Brother.
- Parvati.

1966
02:28:51,570 --> 02:28:52,850
Brother.
- Parvati.

1967
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:58,410
Brother.
- Parvati.

1968
02:29:01,210 --> 02:29:06,010
Parvati, Why did you lie to
a blind brother? - Brother.

1969
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:08,810
You cared for me as a nurse.
But you didn't tell me..

1970
02:29:08,890 --> 02:29:11,530
..that you were my Parvati.

1971
02:29:11,610 --> 02:29:14,490
Brother.
- Why did you lie to me Parvati?

1972
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:15,770
Why did you lie to me Parvati?

1973
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,490
Brother.

1974
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:20,130
I don't deserve to be
called your sister, brother.

1975
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:22,770
Why not Parvati? Why?

1976
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:25,570
I always thought of myself
as your brother Manohar.

1977
02:29:26,170 --> 02:29:28,370
I kept you in my house as my sister.

1978
02:29:28,930 --> 02:29:30,370
You are without any blemish, Parvati.

1979
02:29:30,450 --> 02:29:31,770
You are without any blemish.

1980
02:29:31,890 --> 02:29:34,010
I can give testimony in
front of the whole world.

1981
02:29:34,130 --> 02:29:36,010
There is no need for any testimony.

1982
02:29:37,690 --> 02:29:40,330
This Goddess is herself
proof that she is pure.

1983
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:44,790
Parvati, I wasn't such a bad man.

1984
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:48,390
Why didn't you trust me? Why
didn't you tell me the truth?

1985
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:53,630
I made a mistake, please forgive me.

1986
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:56,230
No, no. Parvati. Get up.

1987
02:29:58,950 --> 02:30:01,470
Gopal. Is this true?

1988
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:04,510
Yes mother, she is
your daughter-in-law.

1989
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:10,310
Mother.
- My daughter-in-law. God bless you.

1990
02:30:14,710 --> 02:30:16,790
You kept all your
grief inside. You never..

1991
02:30:17,350 --> 02:30:20,190
..said a word to others.
God bless you.

1992
02:30:22,830 --> 02:30:24,550
Look, there is Ravi.

1993
02:30:32,910 --> 02:30:34,030
Ravi-Laxmi.

1994
02:30:34,230 --> 02:30:36,190
Ravi, uncle told me everything.

1995
02:30:36,830 --> 02:30:38,190
Please forgive me Ravi.

1996
02:30:38,270 --> 02:30:40,990
No, no Laxmi. It isn't your fault?

1997
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:45,070
It is nobody's fault, child.
It was just a game of destiny.

1998
02:30:45,510 --> 02:30:49,790
Destiny separated us,
and destiny united us.

1999
02:30:49,910 --> 02:30:53,070
Father. Destiny had nothing to
