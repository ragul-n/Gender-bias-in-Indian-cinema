Pintu!

15
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,332
Is that Bhombol?

16
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,709
Baba?

17
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,961
- Did you call him?
- Who?

18
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,799
I told you a former student of mine
is now an eye specialist.

19
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,136
You think you'll get free glasses

20
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,722
just because he was your pupil?

21
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:44,767
Well, he might take it into consideration.

22
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:48,646
I told you, Baba:
<i>I'll</i> get you glasses...

23
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,150
as soon as things improve a bit.

24
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,445
And what do you want?
- Bus ticket.

25
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,155
Ticket?

26
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:02,368
Here.
One yellow, one black.

27
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,257
Yellow... black.

28
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,557
Why did you take Daddy's pen?

29
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,187
<i>Let gm!</i>

30
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,689
- How long until your exam?
- Six weeks.

31
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,525
Did Baba tutor you?
How long?

32
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,528
- Two hours.
- Did he scold you?

33
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,326
- What's the use of studying?
- What?

34
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:47,413
You'll end up with kitchen duty
like your sister-in-law here.

35
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,624
- Poor girl.
- We learn that too.

36
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,793
- What?
- How to cook.

37
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,671
- What?
- Domestic science.

38
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:01,094
Is this how you neglect the earning member of the family?

39
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,513
He's been home a while now.

40
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,474
What can I do?
We ran out of tea.

41
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,352
I had to run over to the neighbors'.

42
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,063
- You borrowed tea?
- What choice do I have?

43
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:15,566
If you don't have your tea
when you get home, you kick up a fuss.

44
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,568
Of course.

45
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,531
You pay no attention to appearances.

46
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,076
Some tea!

47
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,912
They're misers to the bone.

48
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,168
What was Baba asking about?

49
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,130
Glasses, as always.

50
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,257
Poor man.

51
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,928
He does those crossword puzzles at night.

52
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:49,100
Not only do they cost money,
but he's ruining his eyes too.

53
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,978
The man has to have something to do.

54
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,900
He could tutor private students again.

55
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,780
He's better now.

56
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,952
Thanks to your nursing.

57
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,164
I won't allow it.

58
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,291
Cover my head, please.

59
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,003
You think I want him to work?

60
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:22,216
But when I think of the family -
- By the way...

61
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,720
did you get Ma's scented tobacco?

62
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,975
She reminded you a few times.

63
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,728
Okay.
<i>I'll</i> take care of that.

64
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:37,774
But you handle the problem of Baba's glasses.

65
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,942
After all, he listens to you.

66
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,829
Drink this, Baba.

67
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,124
How much longer must I take
this bitter medicine of yours?

68
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,543
You have to take care of your health.

69
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:03,841
Oh, what use is this old body?

70
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,844
I still won't be able to work.

71
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,055
You could get out a bit

72
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,101
and go visit the park in the morning and evening.

73
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,269
I've gone to that park, my dear.

74
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,356
It's just a lot of rabble who gather to gossip.

75
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,608
Even the older folks there

76
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,445
do nothing but gossip and criticize others.

77
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:38,835
I had no idea Calcutta had changed so much.

78
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,722
Will you talk to Bhombol?

79
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,058
About glasses?

80
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:58,354
Yes. He won't listen
to me these days.

81
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,481
He's changed somehow.

82
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,360
You won't listen either, Baba.

83
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,113
You sit up doing your crosswords every night.

84
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,198
Some water?
- Yes.

85
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,582
Oh, my!
Your eyes are so red.

86
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,418
<i>I'll</i> get some cool water.

87
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,420
These eyes...

88
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,675
I'll get some cool water.
Just splash it on your eyes.

89
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:31,929
Please get up a bit, Ma, or you'll get a backache.

90
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,848
Let me cook the fish.

91
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:37,560
- How are you preparing it?
- The way you like it, son.

92
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,729
- <i>Dum pukhz'?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

93
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,772
Then don't let her cook it.

94
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,359
We only have fish three times a week as it is.

95
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,653
Fine, <i>I'll</i> prepare it.

96
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,574
But she cooks very well too.

97
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,659
All right, Ma,

98
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,995
but tomorrow you rest the whole day.

99
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,300
Are you going out?

100
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,303
Yes, to see my private student...

101
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,390
and see if he can pay up.

102
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,228
Would you get some change from my coat pocket?

103
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,281
How's the household account?

104
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,327
There's enough for three days.

105
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,831
And we still owe two months' tuition for Bani.

106
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:41,958
I know.

107
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,502
- <i>So...</i>
- Listen.

108
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,174
Maybe we could ask your friend Abani for a loan?

109
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,843
Don't you know their situation?

110
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,846
Some relatives came to stay,

111
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,683
so they're both working to make ends meet.

112
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,768
What do you mean, “both”?

113
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,066
<i>I'll</i> be back by 8:30.

114
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't pull so much, Ma.

115
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,490
<i>Am I pulling or are you?</i>

116
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,033
Bani.

117
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,416
Get him to fall asleep in here from now on.

118
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,418
As he gets bigger,

119
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:28,254
carrying him
from room to room -

120
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:32,383
Kids are heavier when they're asleep, aren't they?

121
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,969
- Bani, aren't you cold there?
- No.

122
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,805
If I am, I just roll up in the blanket.

123
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,433
<i>You hear me, dear?</i>

124
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,478
- Ma, Baba's calling you.
- I heard.

125
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,692
- You hear me?
- For heaven's sake!

126
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,578
What are you shouting about?

127
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,957
Have you got any money?

128
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,335
Didn't I give you some the other day?

129
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,420
You don't have any more?

130
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:14,091
I'm not the one who keeps the money around here.

131
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:19,388
I thought maybe you had some set aside.

132
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,099
I suppose it's for another crossword contest.

133
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,976
Addicted to such things

134
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,728
at your age!

135
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,273
I just might win some money.

136
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,027
Don't tell me those stories.
I don't like it.

137
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:34,737
Why?

138
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,322
Why?

139
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:40,201
Do any of your stories make any practical sense?

140
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,372
When did money ever come to us easily?

141
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,751
We're a burden on our son.

142
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,549
If we hadn't come here, they wouldn't be in such straits.

143
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,761
Yet all you can think of is money

144
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,513
and more money!

145
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,640
What am I supposed to do?

146
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:07,228
We have some claim on our son.

147
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:17,905
That's the schoolmaster's lot, I suppose.

148
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,325
That's the way it is.

149
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,829
All your life you sweat,

150
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,164
trying to educate children,

151
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:31,001
sowing the seeds of knowledge in their minds.

152
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,841
Then they go trotting off

153
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,260
to become judges and magistrates,

154
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:43,347
leaving you like an ox yoked to the mill.

155
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,851
So on one level...

156
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,690
I'm proud of my students,

157
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,026
but I'm jealous too.

158
00:12:56,527 --> 00:13:00,573
There's an injustice in it somewhere.

159
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:06,120
The Almighty's accounts are out of balance somewhere.

160
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,009
You're feeling better now, aren't you?

161
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,516
If I get lucky just once,

162
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,811
we'll leave all this behind

163
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,981
and go to Cape Comorin.

164
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,903
There's a bridge there that monkeys built.

165
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,197
We'll go see it with our own eyes.

166
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,412
Are you leaving?

167
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,082
This is the last time I give you any money.

168
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,668
Fine, fine.

169
00:13:56,253 --> 00:14:00,341
Someone can make a million
manufacturing cheap cigarettes...

170
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:05,179
but a bank employee with a BA can only go bald

171
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,598
worrying about finances.

172
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,608
What are you thinking about?

173
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,778
What are you thinking about?

174
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,866
- What does your friend's wife do?
- Why?

175
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,120
Where did that come from?
- Tell me.

176
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,419
She's a schoolteacher. Why?

177
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,463
I couldn't teach!

178
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,300
Teaching isn't -

179
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,648
What job could I get with just one year of college?

180
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,900
Who told you to get a job?

181
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:04,280
So you don't think I can -
as usual! Let me by.

182
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,491
Good heavens!
What did I say?

183
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,245
You don't want me to work?

184
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,250
Answer me. Well?

185
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:22,798
<i>Keep me as your servant, fair lady</i>

186
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,508
Hush!

187
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,309
One good thing about living around here:

188
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,352
no need to buy a radio.

189
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,161
<i>“Mr. Lion...”</i>

190
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,040
Well?

191
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,627
Tell me honestly.
- What?

192
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,880
Do you want me to work or don't you?

193
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,926
- No.
- No what?

194
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,304
- I don't want you to.
- You don't?

195
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,269
If you were a bit less attractive,

196
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,607
I might have wanted you to get a job.

197
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,818
If a girl like you worked in an office,

198
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,906
all the male employees' output would drop.

199
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,583
There's a saying in English...

200
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,968
- You believe that?
- Yes.

201
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:53,263
I'm very conservative, like my father.

202
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,852
A housewife should stay in her house

203
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,147
and not wander about.

204
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,183
Dean

205
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,568
I'm going to get a job.

206
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,992
Did you hear what I said?

207
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,994
<i>I'll get</i> a <i>job.</i>

208
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,626
It's true.

209
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,967
It's not right for you to bear all the responsibility.

210
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,557
I don't know why I didn't see it earlier.

211
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,687
You work so hard...

212
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,232
going to the office

213
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,777
and tutoring private students.

214
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,946
Everything you earn you turn over to me,

215
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,700
keeping nothing for yourself.

216
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,916
And what do I do?

217
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,712
I never saw how you were suffering.

218
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,594
<i>No.</i>

219
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,057
Things can't go on like this.

220
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,728
<i>I'll get</i> a <i>job.</i>

221
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:09,775
Any job I can get with my education.

222
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,238
What do you think?

223
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,783
What on earth?

224
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,118
Let me sleep.

225
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,086
“Wanted:
New faces. Boys...”

226
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,548
- <i>“Wanted:</i> an <i>M.Com.”</i>
- <i>Brother...</i>

227
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,300
<i>your bathwater's ready.</i>

228
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:40,931
“Wanted immediately:
a whole-time lady doctor...”

229
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,600
Your bathwater -

230
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,937
What are you looking at?

231
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,940
<i>“Sultan for a Day,
Robin Hood...”</i>

232
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,193
- You're going to the movies?
- What's it to you?

233
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,362
By yourselves?

234
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,781
Couldn't we all go in two months?

235
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,620
What's it say here?

236
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,795
Listen.

237
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,381
I'm looking for a job -

238
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,634
but not a word to anyone.

239
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:21,013
If anyone finds out -

240
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,516
- You mean Ma and Baba?
- Now beat it.

241
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,853
- What kind of job?
- Nothing's definite yet.

242
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,730
I've got it.

243
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,442
Film star!
You'd be perfect.

244
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,779
Dark glasses, lots of red lipstick,

245
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,240
and 100,000 rupees per picture.

246
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,912
And if it's a Hindi film, we'll all fly to Bombay.

247
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,039
<i>Somethings burning in the kitchen.</i>

248
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,584
- Go on.
- No, you go.

249
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,174
And you study domestic science?
Beat it!

250
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,395
- Listen to this.
- What?

251
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,731
Come here a minute.

252
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,951
Listen.

253
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,036
This might work.

254
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,260
- Salesgirl?
- Hang on.

255
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,472
You wouldn't be hawking wares out in the street!

256
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,809
“To serve as a salesgirl

257
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,019
in a respectable firm.

258
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,481
Must be a matriculate.

259
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,483
Starting salary:

260
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,610
rupees 100.”

261
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,116
You remember my starting salary?

262
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,327
All right.

263
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,746
What's that mean?

264
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,040
It means let's submit an application.

265
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,752
<i>I'll</i> have one typed up at work, and you'll sign it.

266
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,380
- <i>I'll</i> sign it?
- Why not?

267
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,090
Me?

268
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,926
If you don't sign it, who will?

269
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,012
Lady Mountbatten?

270
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,441
Go away.

271
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:52,205
Do you write our last name in English with a J or a Z?

272
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,834
Z - the first letter in “zoo.”

273
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,422
Who's going to the zoo?

274
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,176
Here.

275
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,220
<i>I'll go get some paan.</i>

276
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,473
Who's going to the zoo?

277
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,145
You and Mommy...

278
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,647
and Daddy and Auntie.

279
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,152
- When?
- Sunday after next.

280
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,323
- That long away?
- Daddy's pockets are empty now.

281
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:34,164
Don't chew <i>paan</i> before your interview.

282
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,000
Makes a bad impression.
Understand?

283
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,836
Is there something wrong with red?

284
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,342
Listen.

285
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,594
No, never mind.

286
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,519
Tell me...

287
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,396
what if they call me in for an interview?

288
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,191
- Then you go.
- Yes, but -

289
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,068
But what?

290
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,862
What do I say here at home?

291
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,366
Say you're going to your father's house.

292
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,035
It wouldn't be that far off.

293
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,373
A boss is like a father.
Both are providers.

294
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,084
All right?

295
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,171
I'm off.

296
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,095
Is your father home?

297
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,894
I told you to put “life”
and not “wife.”

298
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,729
See? It was “life.”

299
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,190
I'm just a -
Take these.

300
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:46,736
You may have taught English, but as they say,

301
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,865
common sense is the secret to a crossword.

302
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,244
I only have a FA, and you have an MA and BT.

303
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,997
But you still lost.

304
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,832
What's this all about?

305
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,918
It's checkered like a chessboard.

306
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,630
You have to fit in the right English words.

307
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,759
You can win 7,000 rupees.

308
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,929
- You know anybody who's won?
- People win all the time.

309
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:16,099
Whoever makes the fewest mistakes wins,

310
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:19,269
and if it's a tie, the prize is divided up.

311
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,690
What?

312
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,611
Another near miss!

313
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,872
Looks doubtful to me.
Look at the G.

314
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,000
“S. N. Ganguly.”

315
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,836
Doesn't he live on Heysham Row?

316
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,796
Let's call him.

317
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:50,508
You've approved his checks before.

318
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:55,055
Yes, but never for such a large amount.

319
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,605
- A letter came.
- Already?

320
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,235
Yes. I have an interview
Wednesday at 10:00 a.m.

321
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,402
Very good.

322
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,697
Will you go with me?

323
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,493
Me? Sit around
with a bunch of women?

324
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:21,665
- Won't you take me?
- We'll see. Where's the office?

325
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,750
Mission Row.

326
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,962
And the letter was signed
by a Mr. Mukerjee.

327
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,505
A Bengali!

328
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,009
The signature's very mature, and the firm bears his name.

329
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,511
Very good.

330
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,388
- <i>Tell me...</i>
- What?

331
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,765
Listen, I have clients waiting.

332
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,768
Forget your work for a moment.

333
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:43,436
<i>So...</i>

334
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,731
what kind of questions will they ask?

335
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,653
They'll ask,
”Where does the tree spirit live?”

336
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,282
And you answer,
“In the treetops.”

337
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,033
<i>Understand?</i>

338
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,545
<i>Pintu!</i>

339
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,256
<i>Here's your ticket.</i>

340
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,552
It came.

341
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,241
Didn't I tell you?
The interview was really long.

342
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,661
- Where are you going?
- To see Baba.

343
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,420
Starting next month, right?

344
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,465
Why only 100 rupees?

345
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,134
It should have been more.

346
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,596
Even Dipti's driver -
- Hush.

347
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,849
What's that letter?
I want to see.

348
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,770
Let me see.

349
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:12,484
What now?

350
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,987
First we have to bell the cat.

351
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,156
You mean Baba?

352
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,036
Here.

353
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,212
You want some tea?

354
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,716
Let me tackle this first.

355
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,220
Shouldn't we tell Ma too?

356
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,972
That's a minor obstacle.

357
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,480
Spray under the table too.

358
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,943
Look, now it's run out.

359
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:57,821
Now you deal with the mosquitoes on your own.

360
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,324
What do you want?

361
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,247
Arati got a job.

362
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,041
- Who did?
- Arati.

363
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,336
- What did she get?
- A job.

364
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,380
She got a job?

365
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,924
Yes.
She already accepted it.

366
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,136
It's a very good job.

367
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,680
I mean, with a very good firm.

368
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,099
She applied

369
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,268
and went for an interview.

370
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,479
The appointment letter came today.

371
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,941
She starts next month.

372
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,069
It's a salesgirl position.

373
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,280
She'll make 100 rupees a month.

374
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,699
Salesgirl?

375
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:46,703
My daughter-in-law?

376
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:50,498
I'm trying to find
a part-time job too.

377
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,876
Then she'll quit.

378
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:57,005
I've thought about it a lot.
My salary alone isn't enough.

379
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,965
My daughter-in-law.

380
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,052
I suppose you'll Say

381
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:07,640
you supported a large family all by yourself

382
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:13,062
and that Ma never had to go out and work.

383
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,193
I'm not denying that.

384
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,738
But times have changed.

385
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:27,076
It's a new day, and we have to change.

386
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,163
We have to accept it.

387
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:35,126
Change comes by necessity.

388
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,340
We have no choice but to take this step.

389
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,513
<i>What does Ara“ say'?</i>

390
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,683
She took the job of her own free will.

391
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:53,686
It wasn't a whim.
She had to.

392
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,274
Once I get things straightened out, she'll quit.

393
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,986
<i>Ara“ has changed.</i>

394
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,698
It couldn't be helped.

395
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,729
I suppose you have something to say too.

396
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,148
Ever since we came here,

397
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,484
it's like we've become strangers.

398
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,626
Listen.

399
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,717
The cold war has begun.

400
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,177
I know.

401
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:11,472
You know how long it will last?

402
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,225
HOW long?

403
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:19,689
Till the day you get your first month's pay...

404
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:25,570
and buy Baba a pair of glasses.

405
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:34,287
It would've been nice if no one had objected.

406
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,791
I'm hurting so many people.

407
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,502
Are you upset?

408
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,880
Me?

409
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,385
I'm worried about one thing.
- What?

410
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:53,389
The girls I saw the day of the interview

411
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,226
all looked so fashionable.

412
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,896
So tip-top.

413
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:03,608
How can I go to work in my tattered slippers?

414
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:08,112
Give me a list of what you need to look fashionable.

415
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:11,115
<i>I'll</i> get an advance from the office.

416
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,119
All right?

417
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,189
Arati's looking very nice today.

418
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,608
Don't I look nice every day?

419
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,903
She's fishing for a present from your first month's pay.

420
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:52,198
- You look nice too.
- No! Both of us?

421
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:55,785
Yes, because you're both eating together for once.

422
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,872
Like a bride and groom on their wedding day.

423
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,959
All right.
You needn't go on.

424
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,254
- Where's Pintu?
- Over there.

425
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,384
Pintu, sweetie?

426
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,640
You think he's mad?
- Go and see.

427
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,483
<i>I'll</i> go see.

428
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,492
Why just Pintu?
Someone else is mad too.

429
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,473
You know what Bernard Shaw says about working women?

430
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,188
Forget it.

431
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,373
Are you angry?

432
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,918
Listen to me.

433
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,377
Go away.

434
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,839
- <i>I'll</i> buy you a really nice toy.
- I don't want one!

435
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:35,259
Pintu, <i>I'll</i> buy you some nice toys.

436
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:37,261
Listen to me.

437
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,017
Pintu, listen.

438
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,478
Don't be angry, sweetheart.

439
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,438
Listen to me. Pintu!

440
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,566
No, no, no!
Just go away!

441
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,399
If we don't go now,

442
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,776
the streetcar will be too crowded.

443
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,696
Let's go.

444
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,971
Let's go.

445
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,947
I'm going now, Ma.

446
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,657
Good-bye.

447
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,457
Come on.

448
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,525
What toys?

449
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:06,619
Whatever you want, my child.

450
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,379
<i>What are you thinking about...</i>

451
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,882
<i>“smart and attractive”?</i>

452
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,387
What time is it?

453
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,432
9:30. Why?

454
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,441
It's Pintu's bath time.

455
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,779
Don't worry.
He'll get his bath.

456
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,992
I know.

457
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,329
Are you nervous?

458
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,376
What's this?

459
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:59,505
Your hand's ice-cold!
How can this be?

460
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,469
- It happened once before.
- When?

461
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,349
Our wedding day.

462
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:20,109
I'm more worried about Pintu's mother

463
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,278
than about Pintu.

464
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,450
Can you manage with all this on your mind?

465
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,287
We'll see.

466
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,038
To be married.

467
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,207
Number six -
or is it number seven?

468
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:00,543
Mukerjee & Mukerjee.

469
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,517
A little.

470
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,980
A little.

471
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,611
Mukerjee...

472
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,283
<i>Hello.</i>

473
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,786
I was here before.

474
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,874
- I'm sort of busy now.
- Is the family all right?

475
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,251
Yes.

476
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,837
What have you come for?
To open an account?

477
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,381
That's what I had in mind,

478
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,259
but I'm concerned about something I heard.

479
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,220
What's that?

480
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:37,598
About runs on a few banks recently.

481
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:38,807
That may be.

482
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:43,062
Bengalis love to spread rumors.

483
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,774
A rumor gets started about a bank,

484
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:48,859
and people panic.

485
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:53,656
Especially after that incident
with the Jagat Dhatri Bank.

486
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:56,784
If you're unsure, don't open an account.

487
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:59,620
Wait a while.
- No, no.

488
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,914
If you say so, I trust the position is sound.

489
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:06,335
- Savings or current account?
- Savings.

490
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:11,423
I'm just hesitant

491
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,634
because it's not very much.

492
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:19,848
After you've learned to use it, your job would be

493
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,184
to personally go
door-to-door

494
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,478
and market the machine.

495
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,648
The average household

496
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:31,902
will not be able to afford the Autonit.

497
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:36,532
Your target
is the upper-income group.

498
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:41,245
Each of you will have a zone to cover.

499
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,082
You must knock on every door in your zone.

500
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:49,545
If you can meet the housewives, show them this booklet,

501
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:52,840
talk to them, and demonstrate the machine,

502
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,009
you'll be successful.

503
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:57,511
Now, you may ask,

504
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:01,223
“ls there any guarantee
we'll meet the lady of the house?”

505
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,351
I'd say no, there is no guarantee.

506
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,731
But there's one thing I must tell you clearly.

507
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:13,444
Nobody really likes canvassers.

508
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,241
One more thing.

509
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:24,830
In the afternoon, just when housewives are resting,

510
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:28,417
canvassers knock

511
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,919
and disturb their rest.

512
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:33,213
The women get angry

513
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:38,052
and sometimes treat you badly.

514
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:42,848
This is all part of the job.
There's nothing you can do.

515
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:46,518
But it's not a good idea to be too insistent

516
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:49,271
and make a nuisance of yourselves.

517
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:54,276
But if you can get your foot in the door

518
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:57,654
and speak to the lady of the house,

519
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,741
then with the qualities of the Autonit

520
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,452
and your skills of persuasion...

521
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,749
there's no reason why a successful
transaction shouldn't take place.

522
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,501
Mukerjee.

523
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,086
Yes?

524
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:13,962
Mrs. Mazumdar?

525
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:16,882
Hold on.

526
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:19,093
Are you Mrs. Mazumdar?

527
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:35,984
Hello?

528
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:39,113
- Arati?
- Yes.

529
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,576
No problem, right?

530
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,162
No. I have to go.

531
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:48,664
- <i>Listen.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

532
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:51,542
Wait for me after work.
I'll come by for you.

533
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,671
Okay. I have to go.

534
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:47,264
Sir, is that you?
How are you?

535
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:50,684
It's been ages.

536
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,854
Just look how you've grown!

537
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,064
Please come inside.

538
00:46:58,025 --> 00:47:01,570
You've grown in both fame and appearance.

539
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,658
I wouldn't have recognized you on the street.

540
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,912
But I'd have recognized you.
Come sit down.

541
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:14,208
Have a seat on my throne.

542
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,420
You used to have glasses, didn't you?

543
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:20,547
Yes, I did.

544
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:25,093
I lost them on the train coming to Calcutta.

545
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:27,930
I haven't been able to get new ones since.

546
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:33,560
I've often told my son,

547
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:37,898
“My pupil is now a big eye specialist.

548
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:40,192
Get me
an appointment with him.”

549
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,695
But he just doesn't listen to me.

550
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,822
Where do you live?

551
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,950
Close by, in Kalighat,

552
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:52,454
not far from the cremation grounds by the Ganges,

553
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:59,378
so I'm ready for the Master's call.

554
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:03,298
Lots of boys from our class are here in Calcutta now.

555
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:07,135
You remember Anupam?
Anupam Ray Choudhury?

556
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,304
He's a big barrister now.

557
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:11,974
Then there's Bibhash Chakravarty.

558
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,142
He's port commissioner now.

559
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:16,395
A good job.

560
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,816
Nobendu's a doctor.
They were all your pupils.

561
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:29,575
What's this, sir?

562
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:33,996
Why are your eyes watering?
What is it?

563
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:38,458
Pranab, I'm in dire straits.

564
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:41,044
I have no income,

565
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,589
no money.

566
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,010
Maybe so.
But why get so upset?

567
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:50,679
You can't imagine

568
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:53,515
how embarrassed I am to tell you all this.

569
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,018
You mustn't worry.

570
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:58,020
This is nothing.

571
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:01,690
You simply need glasses.
There's no shame in that.

572
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,526
They won't cost you anything.

573
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:08,113
After all, you have a claim on us.

574
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:12,409
You taught us our first lessons, didn't you?

575
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:17,539
I wonder if the others feel the same way.

576
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,084
I'm just repaying my debt to my teacher.

577
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:23,295
All right?

578
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,214
Well said, my son.

579
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,968
“Repaying my debt
to my teacher.”

580
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,386
Well said.

581
00:52:05,499 --> 00:52:07,501
- Is madame in?
- What do you want?

582
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:10,754
- I'm here on business.
- Come in.

583
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:20,013
Please have a seat.
<i>I'll</i> tell madame.

584
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,791
Sit down.

585
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:20,740
You're being noisy again.
Don't you know someone's sick?

586
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:22,742
Go upstairs now.

587
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,787
Hello.

588
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,957
I've probably come at a bad time.

589
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:32,544
No, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting. Sit down.

590
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,132
Did you embroider this?

591
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:40,677
That was long ago.
I do very little of that now.

592
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,971
What can I do for you?

593
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:46,975
I represent a firm
that makes a machine -

594
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:50,061
- Machine? Electrical?
- No, no.

595
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,567
Oh, a knitting machine.
Very good.

596
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:58,987
You see, I've got little children in the house.

597
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:02,532
You can knit with your own hands.

598
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:06,411
You can knit a sweater in just about an hour.

599
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:08,747
<i>Ma, Nicky wants you!</i>

600
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:11,958
Sit with him for a minute,
darling. I'm coming.

601
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,210
My little one is sick.

602
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:15,837
What is it?

603
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:19,132
He has a constant cough,

604
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:22,177
and yesterday he developed a fever.

605
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,346
Have you tried homeopathy?

606
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:28,683
Sometimes it works rather -

607
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,567
Can this knit different patterns?

608
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:41,947
Yes, you can see a few in the back.

609
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,703
How much does it cost?

610
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,540
Don't worry about that.
You'd hardly notice it.

611
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:56,336
May I come give you a demonstration one day?

612
00:54:57,212 --> 00:54:59,756
<i>Ma, Nicky won't listen to me!</i>

613
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,467
Next Wednesday at the same time?

614
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:06,429
All right, because
until I actually see it -

615
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,892
Good. <i>I'll</i> be back
next Wednesday.

616
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,687
I've heard about this machine

617
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:16,356
but never seen it work.

618
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,567
Your name and address?

619
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:23,738
Mrs. Sinha,
8/7 Alipore Park Road.

620
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,577
At first I didn't understand.

621
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,746
The man said, “Please come in.

622
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,748
<i>I'll</i> tell my Wife.”

623
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:37,335
So I followed him inside.
How was I to know?

624
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,005
Anyone else would have known.

625
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,631
You wouldn't have either!

626
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:44,342
- What did he look like?
- Well -

627
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:48,930
- Was he good-looking or not?
- I don't know. It was very dark.

628
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,268
Dark?
At that time of day?

629
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,104
Maybe you were a bit disoriented.

630
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:59,858
The shutters were all closed.
It was a hot day.

631
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:01,943
Fine.
Then what happened?

632
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,740
Then... I just sat
in the drawing room.

633
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:11,661
What a beautiful room!
On the floor was a -

634
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,705
Get to the point!

635
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,623
I'm getting there.

636
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:19,252
I sat and waited while the man disappeared.

637
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,921
- To get his wife.
- Right.

638
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,840
After some time,

639
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,843
he came back and sat on the sofa near me.

640
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:30,096
Across from you or next to you?

641
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,474
Just keep quiet!

642
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,601
Didn't you ask where his wife was?

643
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:37,687
I kept thinking, “She's coming, she's coming”,

644
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,440
but she didn't come and didn't come,

645
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:42,317
and then the man -

646
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,235
What?

647
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,696
He just kept staring at me.

648
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,491
- Was he smiling?
- Smiling?

649
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:52,827
I could barely stammer,

650
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:54,996
“ls your wife coming?”

651
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:58,166
What a question!
“ls your wife coming?”

652
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,085
Then what?

653
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,337
The man says,

654
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,964
“What wife?

655
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:06,841
I'm a bachelor.”

656
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:09,302
Good heavens!

657
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,346
What did you say?

658
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:13,473
Listen, listen.

659
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,517
Then he says,

660
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:18,019
“And I don't see any vermilion mark

661
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:20,271
on your forehead either.”

662
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,023
What did you say?

663
00:57:25,735 --> 00:57:27,278
What happened?

664
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:32,367
Why?

665
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,543
First he says no, not a paisa.

666
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:53,096
- Say it in Hindi.
- And then?

667
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,861
- That's why we sent you.
- And then?

668
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:18,204
Five percent?

669
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:20,582
Let me finish.

670
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,477
- Me?
- Yes, you.

671
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:45,773
<i>You've done so</i> much <i>for us,
we must get you</i> some <i>rossogo/las.</i>

672
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,026
<i>mate rossogollas.</i>

673
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:52,614
Next para.

674
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:39,619
Miss Simmons was in here earlier.

675
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:47,502
I suppose she was acting as your representative.

676
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,170
Right?

677
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,177
If you have some collective grievance,

678
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:58,263
best to send one person

679
00:59:58,388 --> 01:00:02,141
instead of all of you crowding in here.

680
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:04,519
I have no objection to that.

681
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:07,188
And if your demand is reasonable,

682
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:10,024
I have no problem with that.

683
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:15,697
But there's one thing I don't understand.

684
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,866
There are five of you -

685
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,035
four Bengalis

686
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:24,205
and one Anglo-Indian.

687
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:27,834
So why doesn't one of you four represent the group?

688
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:30,712
Why must that Anglo-Indian
be your leader?

689
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,131
What qualities in her

690
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:35,675
made you make her your representative?

691
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:40,054
Do you think Miss Simmons got you the commission

692
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:42,557
due to some amazing skill on her part?

693
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:45,059
That I lost to her?

694
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:50,023
That's not the case at all,
Mrs. Mazumdar.

695
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,484
I'd already decided to give you a commission

696
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,570
after a month or two.

697
01:00:56,237 --> 01:00:59,574
So it's not as if Miss Simmons

698
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:02,452
is somehow responsible.

699
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:06,998
I had to be a bit harsh with her,

700
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:11,127
because I don't like insolent people.

701
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:15,089
If you'd brought this proposal to me,

702
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:18,259
I know you'd have put it very politely,

703
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:20,928
and there'd have been no argument.

704
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,477
Will you remember that in the future?

705
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:30,730
If there's something to discuss, you come.

706
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:35,109
Then all parties will benefit.
All right?

707
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:42,450
- May I go?
- Yes, of course.

708
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:47,038
How do you like the work?

709
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:49,415
- I like it.
- I like it too -

710
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,793
your work, that is.

711
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:55,922
Some customers have sent letters praising your work.

712
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:58,341
Go on now.

713
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:03,137
Mrs. Mazumdar.

714
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:09,769
Sign here.

715
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:15,233
Would you knit my grandson a sweater on your machine

716
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:18,319
if I bring you the wool?
- Certainly.

717
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:24,325
Miss Simmons.

718
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:29,163
Thank you.

719
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,610
Give me yours, and <i>I'll</i> give you mine.

720
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:45,990
Take them.

721
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:53,915
All right.

722
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,298
Happy now?

723
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:11,516
What?

724
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:18,147
No.
What would I do with it?

725
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,870
I don't know how to use it.

726
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:45,925
Not too much.
Just a little.

727
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,712
Give me a tissue.

728
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:25,172
There'll be trouble if I use my handkerchief.

729
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:45,359
What's going on?

730
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:10,217
A pistol?

731
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:17,141
What's this?
- Open it and see.

732
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:23,314
Bani, come with me.

733
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:42,833
Take it.

734
01:06:54,387 --> 01:06:57,139
Daddy, wind this up for me.

735
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,601
On the bottom.

736
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:05,606
Did you spend your whole salary?

737
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,575
This is my salary...

738
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:18,285
and -

739
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:22,623
- What's that?
- Commission.

740
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,500
- Commission?
- That's right.

741
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,877
You didn't tell me about that!

742
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,964
Remember that Anglo-Indian girl
I told you about?

743
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:35,803
She fought with Himangshu-babu
and got us all a commission.

744
01:07:36,804 --> 01:07:39,181
- Himangshu-babu?
- Our boss.

745
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,642
Give me that.

746
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:50,401
And you know what the boss told me?

747
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:52,153
What?

748
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:55,239
I'm not telling.

749
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:07,668
He said

750
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:10,129
I'm doing very good work.

751
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:19,930
Some scented tobacco for you.
Is it the right kind?

752
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:24,059
I got paid today

753
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:26,395
so I went shopping.

754
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,522
That's why I was late.

755
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,816
WW buy anything for me?

756
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:33,027
Don't say that, Ma.

757
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:38,199
You mustn't think you have to buy me anything special.

758
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:42,286
Your father-in-law's
an old man now.

759
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:45,998
He's devoted his whole life to studying

760
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:48,876
and teaching children.

761
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,837
Now he has no job.

762
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:55,966
Take care of him.
That's enough for me.

763
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:02,014
- Today is Baba's birthday.
- That's right.

764
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:04,433
If he's happy, so am I.

765
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:15,319
I got paid today, Baba.
I brought you some fruit.

766
01:09:23,077 --> 01:09:25,079
Today's your birthday.

767
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:29,583
Leave the fruit, but I won't take your money.

768
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,256
I'd be happy if you would.

769
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:39,802
No, Arati, you can't change my mind so easily.

770
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:44,014
And I'm too old to change my views.

771
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:47,017
Do what makes you happy.

772
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:50,354
I won't stand in your way.

773
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:55,484
But don't try to make me share in your happiness.

774
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,236
I can't.

775
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:02,783
<i>I'll</i> leave the fruit.

776
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,767
Mommy.

777
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:30,644
Yes, sweetheart?

778
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:33,480
Baba won't look at my toys.

779
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:36,066
Go try again.
I'm sure he'll look.

780
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:43,240
Listen...

781
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:45,993
where did Baba get those glasses?

782
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,328
Glasses?

783
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,914
The ones I saw on his table.

784
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:52,666
They must be Mr. Sinha's.

785
01:10:53,876 --> 01:10:55,961
Where else would he get glasses?

786
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,050
Really?

787
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:03,302
What else could it be?

788
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:07,014
Maybe so.

789
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:09,892
I'm just tired of thinking.

790
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:17,232
- Has peace been declared?
- No.

791
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,155
<i>I'll</i> have a bath today.

792
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:31,664
Will we ever get a fan?

793
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:36,877
We can afford one in a month or so, don't you think?

794
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:41,757
At the rate you're earning commissions, why just a fan?

795
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:44,843
We'll soon be able to afford an air conditioner.

796
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,471
I told
Himangshu-babu today,

797
01:11:47,596 --> 01:11:50,015
“I'm scared to come into your office.

798
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,018
It's so cool,
I'm afraid <i>I'll</i> catch a cold!”

799
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:56,522
You know what he said?
- What?

800
01:11:56,939 --> 01:12:00,317
“You ladies have knitting machines now.

801
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:04,571
Knit yourselves some sweaters
to wear in my office.”

802
01:12:06,699 --> 01:12:08,742
Sounds like a very jovial fellow.

803
01:12:10,786 --> 01:12:12,496
<i>Yes...</i>

804
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,832
but he's very strict too.

805
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:18,085
He won't tolerate any slackness on the job.

806
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,129
If we're lax, he really scolds us.

807
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:23,257
<i>I'll</i> have to come meet him sometime.

808
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:28,053
Then stop in.
We leave the office at 10:30.

809
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,806
Find some excuse to call on him after that.

810
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:36,603
Does he ever scold you?

811
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,148
Me?

812
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:42,234
My work is always faultless.

813
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,613
What exactly is your work?

814
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,082
<i>I'll</i> tell <i>you.</i>

815
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,669
I get to the office at 10:00

816
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:02,463
and sign in.

817
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:05,632
Then we decide what area we'll each cover that day.

818
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:09,053
At 10:30 sharp
we start out canvassing.

819
01:13:10,054 --> 01:13:12,347
We go from door to door,

820
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:15,059
talking to housewives

821
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,644
and setting appointments with them.

822
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,980
Then we go back with the machine

823
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:22,816
and give them a demonstration.

824
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:25,319
Then, when the machine is sold,

825
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:29,281
there's the payment,
the invoice, the sales report -

826
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:30,991
The commission.

827
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:34,661
You wouldn't recognize me on the job.

828
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:37,664
What about at home?

829
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,334
Would I recognize you at home?

830
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:53,514
You don't recognize me?

831
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:56,517
Tell me honestly.

832
01:13:57,518 --> 01:13:58,852
Why not?

833
01:14:00,104 --> 01:14:03,273
It all feels a bit unfamiliar.

834
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,110
It feels a bit -

835
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:09,113
What about this?

836
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:11,573
You don't recognize my mole?

837
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:18,372
I'm still the same housewife.

838
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:36,140
<i>Manoj?</i>

839
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:38,142
<i>It's Subrata.</i>

840
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:40,644
I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

841
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:43,897
No, I don't forget you when I need you.

842
01:14:44,106 --> 01:14:45,566
<i>What do you need?</i>

843
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:47,609
I need a favor -

844
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:50,404
that is, if you're a friend in need.

845
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:53,532
Tell me about this favor and this need.

846
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:57,786
They come to the same thing.
I need a job.

847
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:00,080
- <i>A job? For whom?</i>
- <i>For me.</i>

848
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:03,834
- Don't you have a job?
- Yes...

849
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:06,837
but I mean in addition to that.

850
01:15:06,962 --> 01:15:09,882
Anything part-time
that pays 70-75 rupees.

851
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:13,594
You know so many people.
I could use a little help.

852
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:17,097
Who said you can get a job over the phone?

853
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:20,642
No, this is just a warning.
<i>I'll</i> stop by.

854
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:24,813
Then hang up and come straight over.

855
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:28,066
It's already lunch time.
Make a little effort.

856
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:29,943
<i>Pamper me a bit.</i>

857
01:15:30,068 --> 01:15:32,779
Sure, but not today.
Tomorrow.

858
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:36,909
You think there's a chance?

859
01:15:37,618 --> 01:15:39,912
I can't guarantee you a job,

860
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:42,331
but I've got some good American cigarettes,

861
01:15:42,456 --> 01:15:44,124
fresh off the boat.

862
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:47,544
Sounds good.
I'll stop by.

863
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:49,463
Talk to you later.

864
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,867
Pintu.

865
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,495
Pintu has a fever.

866
01:16:21,662 --> 01:16:22,996
A fever?

867
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:25,749
Yes.
We've been waiting for you.

868
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,626
In here.

869
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:29,419
Your mommy's here.

870
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:32,005
- When did it start?
- This afternoon.

871
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,508
He kept saying he didn't want to eat.

872
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:38,512
Mommy's home now.
Let's go to our room.

873
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:41,056
He said he's not talking to you.

874
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:43,684
You're not talking to me?

875
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,018
What?

876
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:49,856
I told him to go play with his auntie.

877
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:52,567
Come, child.

878
01:16:54,528 --> 01:16:58,323
Then he suddenly just lay down on the bed.

879
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:01,952
Then I understood.

880
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,038
I felt his forehead, and he was warm.

881
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,167
He had some milk and barley this evening.

882
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:12,170
All day long it was, “Mommy, Mommy.

883
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:14,756
When is Mommy coming home?

884
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:17,134
Why does she have to go to work?

885
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:18,802
Mommy's mean.

886
01:17:19,386 --> 01:17:22,931
Mommy's naughty.
I'm going to spank her.”

887
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:25,142
And on and on.

888
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:29,479
So You're very angry
are you? '

889
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:33,734
You're going to hit Mommy with your pistol?

890
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:36,778
What if Mommy brings you a new toy?

891
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,363
What toy?

892
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:41,575
What toy?
We'll have to see.

893
01:17:41,742 --> 01:17:43,744
Let me wash up first.

894
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:50,417
Shall we take him to the clinic?

895
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:52,669
<i>Is it a high fever?</i>

896
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:55,797
No, maybe 100.

897
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,966
Shall I go borrow a thermometer?

898
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:01,303
Yes. Tell them
we'll return it in the morning.

899
01:18:02,095 --> 01:18:04,765
Get me a really good toy.

900
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:11,229
The streetcars weren't running.
Did you take a bus?

901
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:18,070
Quit your job.

902
01:18:22,783 --> 01:18:25,285
I'm getting a part-time job.

903
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:29,581
I called a friend today.
He promised to help.

904
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:32,918
You'd be working twice as hard.

905
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:35,712
<i>That' s what we deemed, Ara“.</i>

906
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:39,800
I'd get a part-time job,
and you'd quit working.

907
01:18:40,509 --> 01:18:42,761
- But...
- No buts.

908
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:46,640
I've given this a lot of thought.

909
01:18:47,349 --> 01:18:49,726
Did you think about the money?

910
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:54,648
Peace within the family is more important than money.

911
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:58,443
- Mommy, what toy?
- <i>I'll</i> tell you in a minute.

912
01:18:58,568 --> 01:19:01,988
You realize Baba hasn't spoken to me

913
01:19:02,114 --> 01:19:04,116
in a month and a half?

914
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:07,119
I'm setting it here.

915
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:16,128
I'm doing such good work.

916
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:19,423
Is that bothering you?

917
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:22,676
You know what your good work has done?

918
01:19:22,843 --> 01:19:23,885
What?

919
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:26,513
You're looking thin.

920
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:29,349
There are dark circles under your eyes.

921
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,353
I don't feel bad.

922
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:37,691
Even after working all day, I don't feel tired.

923
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,453
You really don't want me...

924
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,747
to work?

925
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:55,917
No, I don't.

926
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:59,212
And Baba doesn't.
Ma doesn't.

927
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:02,674
Even he doesn't.

928
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:08,305
You'd rather go on making so many others unhappy?

929
01:20:13,018 --> 01:20:15,562
It's not the others that concern me.

930
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,733
What matters is what you want.

931
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,818
Mommy, what toy?

932
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,125
Is that a fever?

933
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,336
Silly!
You think 98 is a fever?

934
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:42,756
Then what is?
Two hundred?

935
01:20:43,173 --> 01:20:45,383
Pintu's fever is gone.

936
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,803
Should I return the thermometer?

937
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:50,555
Yes, do.

938
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:58,563
Do I get a toy even if my fever's gone?

939
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:01,149
Of course, darling.
Now go lie down.

940
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:02,817
<i>Here.</i>

941
01:21:03,777 --> 01:21:05,529
Sign this.

942
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:10,867
Finding a job is hard,

943
01:21:11,326 --> 01:21:13,286
but quitting one is easy.

944
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,372
All it takes is a letter.

945
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,931
<i>There's some trouble at your bank, sir.</i>

946
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:17,517
You should go see.

947
01:22:18,018 --> 01:22:19,352
What?

948
01:22:57,223 --> 01:22:59,059
Since you were late, I -

949
01:23:01,269 --> 01:23:03,021
One minute.

950
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:11,571
Don't go any closer.
The crowd is furious.

951
01:23:19,954 --> 01:23:21,247
<i>Lun.</i>

952
01:23:22,374 --> 01:23:26,252
Mukerjee.
Oh, how are you?

953
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:42,435
All right.

954
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:45,188
Thank you, <i>bhai.</i>
Thank you.

955
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:48,608
Now, then...

956
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:52,779
first, your colleague Miss Simmons isn't coming in today.

957
01:23:52,946 --> 01:23:55,949
She had a demonstration
scheduled for today at 12:00.

958
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:58,827
It's a good prospect.
You'll have to handle it.

959
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,831
If you can manage English, fine.
Otherwise, use Hindi.

960
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:06,292
All right?

961
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,920
Second...

962
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:11,339
I have some plans.

963
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:14,134
Not immediately, but in the near future.

964
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,678
Open the doors!

965
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:31,151
There's the scoundrel!

966
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,280
Come to watch the fun?

967
01:24:35,405 --> 01:24:36,614
Get him!

968
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:40,326
- We're ruined thanks to you!
- What did I do?

969
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,328
Now the scoundrel's making excuses!

970
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:47,500
Why are you hitting him?

971
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:50,170
Will it get you your money back?

972
01:24:51,421 --> 01:24:54,632
We'll be taking on some new salesgirls,

973
01:24:54,758 --> 01:24:58,845
so the nature of your job may change a bit.

974
01:24:59,429 --> 01:25:02,140
- But I -
- Mrs. Mazumdar...

975
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:05,018
I don't like the word “but.”

976
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:07,353
it's a very ugly word.

977
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,356
I'm banking on you.

978
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:14,110
I'd like you to take on more responsibility.

979
01:25:14,235 --> 01:25:16,029
You can handle it.

980
01:25:16,196 --> 01:25:19,032
I've seen your work these last two months.

981
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,868
I want to start working in a group system,

982
01:25:22,035 --> 01:25:24,537
and I want you to be group leader.

983
01:25:24,704 --> 01:25:28,124
You'd no longer have
to go door-to-door.

984
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:31,628
You'd simply coordinate the others' work,

985
01:25:32,212 --> 01:25:34,506
supervise them,

986
01:25:34,631 --> 01:25:36,883
collect the daily sales reports.

987
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:40,303
You'll manage
the day-to-day expenses.

988
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:41,888
But Mr. Mukerjee -

989
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:50,605
- I've told you before.
- For me?

990
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:06,496
Did you give him the letter?

991
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:09,082
<i>No, not yet...</i>

992
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:12,836
Don't. I lost my job.

993
01:26:12,961 --> 01:26:17,465
<i>The bank collapsed.
Don't give him the letter.</i>

994
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:20,969
<i>I'll</i> explain tonight.
Don't be scared.

995
01:26:21,094 --> 01:26:23,471
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

996
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:25,807
<i>Don't worry.
I've got to go.</i>

997
01:26:32,981 --> 01:26:34,566
I wrote it down.

998
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:38,194
Mrs. Benjamin Cohen,
24 Royd Street, 12:00.

999
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:39,863
Okay?

1000
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:15,959
What is it?

1001
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:19,545
Mrs. Mazumdar?

1002
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:24,008
That call earlier was from my husband.

1003
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:27,804
- Yes, I guessed that.
- He lost his job.

1004
01:28:28,554 --> 01:28:31,641
- What?
- There was no warning.

1005
01:28:32,642 --> 01:28:34,477
Where?
What was he doing?

1006
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,562
The New Bharat Bank.

1007
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,732
It's closed down.

1008
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:43,444
- All these banks sprouting up -
- I need a raise.

1009
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:48,700
Didn't you say my work was good

1010
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:51,077
and my future bright?

1011
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:56,416
At least a 50-rupee raise.
I can't manage without it.

1012
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,967
Mrs. Mazumdar...

1013
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:10,096
there's no doubt about your efficiency.

1014
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:15,101
That's why I'm giving you greater responsibility.

1015
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:18,312
But not immediately.

1016
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:20,648
It will take two or three months.

1017
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:27,238
There's a process involved
in raises, and you've only -

1018
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,241
I can't manage
without a 50-rupee raise.

1019
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:33,369
Or <i>I'll</i> have to explore other avenues.

1020
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:38,332
What other avenues,
Mrs. Mazumdar?

1021
01:29:43,463 --> 01:29:46,591
Are there so many just waiting for you to explore?

1022
01:29:48,593 --> 01:29:52,513
I'm asking you:
Please see what you can do.

1023
01:29:56,392 --> 01:29:58,394
Mrs. Mazumdar...

1024
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:02,106
you are too impulsive,

1025
01:30:02,482 --> 01:30:07,195
and impulsiveness can lead to trouble.

1026
01:30:09,363 --> 01:30:12,325
I know, and I apologize.

1027
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:17,997
Very well. <i>I'll</i> give instructions
to Nagen Babu.

1028
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:21,542
But in the strictest confidence.

1029
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:24,670
Your colleagues must never know of this.

1030
01:30:26,506 --> 01:30:29,217
No one will know.
I give my word.

1031
01:30:30,468 --> 01:30:33,513
One more thing:
Tell your husband

1032
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,433
not to get a job with another upstart bank,

1033
01:30:37,558 --> 01:30:40,603
or I'll have to go through this again.

1034
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:45,399
This is unbelievable.

1035
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:48,861
You were in charge of a department,

1036
01:30:48,986 --> 01:30:52,448
yet you had no warning of such a disaster?

1037
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:55,326
You had me open an account there.

1038
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:57,995
“Position sound”, you said.

1039
01:30:58,121 --> 01:31:00,373
Where's that “position sound” now?

1040
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:03,376
Two thousand rupees gone down the drain!

1041
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:06,379
<i>I'll</i> pay back your money over time.

1042
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:09,507
That's not the point.
It's not the money.

1043
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:13,386
Two thousand rupees won't ruin Nibaron Chatterjee.

1044
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:16,889
I'm thinking of you.

1045
01:31:17,932 --> 01:31:20,434
If a run was imminent,

1046
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,728
there was a manager and others

1047
01:31:22,854 --> 01:31:25,064
you could have discussed things with.

1048
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:29,110
They're the ones who said the position was sound,

1049
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:30,903
not me.

1050
01:31:31,195 --> 01:31:34,073
You can't just bury your nose in your papers.

1051
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:37,118
You have to be sharp and alert.

1052
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,246
These aren't simple times.

1053
01:31:41,873 --> 01:31:43,833
What do you think?

1054
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:48,671
Nothing.
My opinion is of no value.

1055
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:50,882
I'm outdated now.

1056
01:32:03,811 --> 01:32:05,938
Daughter...

1057
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:12,361
I never thought you'd have to suffer like this.

1058
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,280
Suffer like what, Baba?

1059
01:32:14,405 --> 01:32:17,658
I'm very disappointed, child.
This is -

1060
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:19,952
Don't worry, Baba.

1061
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:22,121
This isn't anybody's fault.

1062
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:24,957
He didn't do anything wrong.

1063
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:28,753
He just has to find another job.

1064
01:32:28,878 --> 01:32:30,504
I understand that.

1065
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:33,216
But to make you go out and work?

1066
01:32:33,341 --> 01:32:36,260
No one made me go out and work.

1067
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:38,387
It was my own decision,

1068
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:41,307
and I enjoy it very much.

1069
01:32:41,933 --> 01:32:44,560
But now
you're the only one -

1070
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:47,772
Go back inside, Baba.
Your tea's getting cold.

1071
01:32:48,314 --> 01:32:49,857
<i>Sister-in-law.</i>

1072
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:57,823
What's this?

1073
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:59,992
Have my name removed.

1074
01:33:00,243 --> 01:33:02,954
- From where?
- The school rolls.

1075
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:08,084
Have you lost your mind?

1076
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:11,879
You've done well and gotten such good grades.

1077
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:14,131
Why quit school now?

1078
01:33:14,507 --> 01:33:17,009
It's too big an expense for you.

1079
01:33:19,553 --> 01:33:21,138
Poor thing.

1080
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:27,311
What would you do then?

1081
01:33:28,104 --> 01:33:30,106
Can't I work?

1082
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,736
Giving you that sari was a mistake.

1083
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:38,990
You're still just a child.

1084
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:44,787
Then tell me what I should do.

1085
01:33:46,038 --> 01:33:48,874
Will you do what I say?

1086
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:52,712
The potatoes, eggplants, and pumpkin

1087
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:55,214
are chopped and ready in the kitchen.

1088
01:33:56,465 --> 01:34:00,052
Add the spices
and make a curry. Go on.

1089
01:34:00,511 --> 01:34:02,680
I can make the curry?

1090
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,391
But I won't help.
Ma won't help.

1091
01:34:05,558 --> 01:34:07,059
No one will help.

1092
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:09,270
You won't criticize it later, will you?

1093
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:12,064
No, I won't. Go on.

1094
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:36,881
I went to see that friend today

1095
01:34:37,006 --> 01:34:39,592
who talked
about a part-time job.

1096
01:34:39,717 --> 01:34:41,385
What happened?

1097
01:34:41,594 --> 01:34:44,180
He says it will take a month at least.

1098
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,228
Shall I tell you some good news?

1099
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:53,272
Good news?

1100
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,569
I got a 50-rupee raise.

1101
01:35:01,781 --> 01:35:03,699
That's great.

1102
01:35:06,911 --> 01:35:09,080
The wife's a hero...

1103
01:35:09,663 --> 01:35:11,791
the husband's a zero.

1104
01:35:24,095 --> 01:35:26,138
Someone's here to see you.

1105
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:29,225
- Who?
- Some old man. He's waiting.

1106
01:35:29,517 --> 01:35:30,768
All right.

1107
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:34,480
Don't be too long.
The show's at 10:30.

1108
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:37,691
I'm all ready.
- I know, I know.

1109
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,664
How are you, sir?

1110
01:35:51,997 --> 01:35:53,457
Anupam?

1111
01:35:53,582 --> 01:35:56,168
Let me have a look at you.

1112
01:35:56,585 --> 01:35:58,462
Have I changed a lot?

1113
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:01,173
No, I recognize you.

1114
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:04,510
Please sit down.

1115
01:36:10,933 --> 01:36:12,935
So what brings you here?

1116
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:16,397
I got your letter when I got back from court yesterday.

1117
01:36:16,522 --> 01:36:19,900
Who gave you my address?
- Your address?

1118
01:36:20,025 --> 01:36:24,447
The man who gave me these glasses,

1119
01:36:24,572 --> 01:36:26,824
one of your old classmates.

1120
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:30,119
- Pranab?
- Yes. Do you see him often?

1121
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:33,330
Yes. I saw him
for a consultation a while back.

1122
01:36:33,456 --> 01:36:35,875
- I see.
- His practice is going well.

1123
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,044
Yours isn't going badly either, my boy.

1124
01:36:39,837 --> 01:36:42,047
This age belongs to all of you.

1125
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:45,050
It's you who work

1126
01:36:45,259 --> 01:36:47,720
and make our country's future bright.

1127
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:50,389
When I see your achievements,

1128
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:55,227
the heart under this old bag of bones rejoices.

1129
01:36:55,394 --> 01:36:57,688
I trust your health is fine?

1130
01:36:57,813 --> 01:36:59,356
My health?

1131
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:01,901
My generation is no more.

1132
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:05,738
We are dead, crushed into the dust

1133
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:07,865
like reptiles.

1134
01:37:08,157 --> 01:37:11,285
The backbone's broken, my boy.

1135
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:14,663
If we're still here today,

1136
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:18,042
it's only due to our mental strength.

1137
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:19,877
It's very hard.

1138
01:37:20,711 --> 01:37:25,216
If my own son doesn't look after me,

1139
01:37:25,633 --> 01:37:27,218
I know you will.

1140
01:37:27,343 --> 01:37:30,221
After all, you're like my own sons.

1141
01:37:30,346 --> 01:37:33,224
I raised you like my own sons.

1142
01:37:34,225 --> 01:37:36,894
If you're famous today,

1143
01:37:37,019 --> 01:37:40,606
some credit should go to me.

1144
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:44,276
Didn't I contribute to that?

1145
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:46,862
Tell me.

1146
01:37:51,867 --> 01:37:54,370
Are you speaking of financial help?

1147
01:37:54,495 --> 01:37:58,457
I prefer not to use
the word “help.”

1148
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:04,380
Did Dronacharya ask Eklavya for “help”?

1149
01:38:05,172 --> 01:38:07,007
Wait here.
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

1150
01:38:10,761 --> 01:38:12,721
I suppose he's asking for help.

1151
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:17,685
The Bengali community is like that.

1152
01:38:21,272 --> 01:38:22,898
Who is he?

1153
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,152
Our old teacher.

1154
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:32,825
He used to quote Samuel Smiles.
- How much are you giving him?

1155
01:38:33,784 --> 01:38:35,995
Oh! I thought
it was a hundred.

1156
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:38,038
You must be crazy.

1157
01:38:44,128 --> 01:38:47,590
<i>I don't need any fish, Ma.
No need to rush.</i>

1158
01:38:47,715 --> 01:38:50,009
It's ready, child.

1159
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:52,052
Here you are.

1160
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:55,097
I have to be
at work by 9:30.

1161
01:38:56,056 --> 01:38:58,934
The Anglo-Indian girl's
been out for a few days,

1162
01:38:59,059 --> 01:39:01,645
so I have to do her work too.

1163
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:04,648
That's what I'm saying.
You work all day.

1164
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:07,151
If you don't eat well, how will you manage?

1165
01:39:07,276 --> 01:39:08,277
Sister-in-law.

1166
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:12,823
Did you try the spinach?
- Yes.

1167
01:39:13,991 --> 01:39:15,659
HOW did I do?

1168
01:39:18,704 --> 01:39:20,205
You passed.

1169
01:39:21,123 --> 01:39:23,208
Just passed?

1170
01:39:24,918 --> 01:39:26,462
First division.

1171
01:39:28,714 --> 01:39:32,384
Should we keep the maid on or let her go?

1172
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:36,472
How would you manage the whole day?

1173
01:39:36,597 --> 01:39:38,766
You can see how busy I am.

1174
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,977
I get home so late every night.

1175
01:39:42,102 --> 01:39:46,106
It's just that she's been asking
for the rest of her wages.

1176
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:48,567
Oh. In that case -

1177
01:39:49,943 --> 01:39:53,280
Listen, you're not doing anything.

1178
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:56,575
Could you get four rupees from the dresser for the maid?

1179
01:39:58,744 --> 01:40:01,914
- Where's the money?
- In my bag.

1180
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:03,916
In the drawer on the right.

1181
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:17,096
No office again today?

1182
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:19,390
- No.
- Why?

1183
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:22,434
I have the day off.

1184
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,813
Mommy doesn't get the day off?

1185
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:31,694
- Mommy's office is bad.
- Mommy's office is bad?

1186
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:36,407
Did you find it?

1187
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:38,492
There's a 10-rupee bill

1188
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:40,703
and seven one-rupee bills.

1189
01:40:40,953 --> 01:40:42,996
They're all together.

1190
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,802
Here.

1191
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:02,641
Listen.

1192
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:05,144
Where did she go now?

1193
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:09,898
I'm late.

1194
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:13,360
I've been calling you forever.

1195
01:41:13,485 --> 01:41:16,947
Here's your pay.
Where did you run off to?

1196
01:41:21,368 --> 01:41:25,122
Mommy, Daddy says your office is bad.

1197
01:41:26,206 --> 01:41:27,875
Is that so?

1198
01:41:29,168 --> 01:41:30,794
I'm off now.

1199
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:33,964
I'm going.

1200
01:41:34,173 --> 01:41:36,884
Not going to put on your lipstick?

1201
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:58,489
Mommy, what did you throw?

1202
01:41:59,865 --> 01:42:01,366
Listen to me.

1203
01:42:02,284 --> 01:42:03,660
What?

1204
01:42:04,286 --> 01:42:06,288
Do whatever you like,

1205
01:42:06,413 --> 01:42:09,374
but please don't misunderstand me, darling.

1206
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:20,302
Daddy, is Mommy mad?

1207
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:37,194
<i>Edith.</i>

1208
01:42:38,403 --> 01:42:40,614
- <i>Edith.</i>
- <i>Coming, Mummy.</i>

1209
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:10,269
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Sit down.

1210
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:18,861
What happened?

1211
01:43:46,138 --> 01:43:47,723
Inﬂuenza?

1212
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:58,066
- But you're all right now?
- Yes.

1213
01:44:10,412 --> 01:44:14,499
- And now I have to do all your work.
- What work?

1214
01:44:14,917 --> 01:44:18,170
Didn't you schedule a demonstration
today? isn't this Thursday?

1215
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:23,300
And where was it yesterday?

1216
01:44:30,349 --> 01:44:33,685
Don't say sorry. Say thank you.
You'll get the commission.

1217
01:44:40,567 --> 01:44:43,528
And don't you have a sales report to turn in?

1218
01:44:53,163 --> 01:44:54,873
You'll be in tomorrow?

1219
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,125
I must. I haven't got
my wages yet, damn it.

1220
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:03,757
Here.

1221
01:45:05,342 --> 01:45:06,969
Your pay-

1222
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:12,265
Here, sign for it.

1223
01:45:13,642 --> 01:45:15,102
Sign it.

1224
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,563
Try and come in tomorrow.

1225
01:45:19,064 --> 01:45:22,901
Turn in the sales report yourself.
The boss will be happy.

1226
01:45:25,529 --> 01:45:27,572
- <i>I'll</i> be going.
- All right.

1227
01:45:29,408 --> 01:45:31,576
Say good-bye
to your mother for me.

1228
01:46:59,081 --> 01:47:01,208
You thought I was just out shopping?

1229
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,336
Naturally.
That was my first impression.

1230
01:47:07,506 --> 01:47:09,007
Sit down.

1231
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:14,179
What will you have?

1232
01:47:15,555 --> 01:47:18,683
- Tea.
- Nothing else?

1233
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:21,561
Two teas, please.

1234
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:30,028
So you're a salesgirl, eh?

1235
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:33,198
Don't laugh.
It's a good job.

1236
01:47:33,323 --> 01:47:36,159
And we make a good product.
- Is that so?

1237
01:47:38,662 --> 01:47:39,788
Look.

1238
01:47:42,249 --> 01:47:45,377
You have to buy one.
- What? it's compulsory?

1239
01:47:45,544 --> 01:47:46,878
Why not?

1240
01:47:47,003 --> 01:47:49,881
Since you're the husband of a rich friend.

1241
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:52,050
“Autonit.”

1242
01:47:52,384 --> 01:47:54,594
For your wife, of course.

1243
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:08,150
Soon women will have no work to do at all.

1244
01:48:09,276 --> 01:48:10,819
How is Shipra?

1245
01:48:10,944 --> 01:48:13,113
You still haven't come by our place.

1246
01:48:18,243 --> 01:48:20,912
And I've yet to meet your husband.

1247
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:25,000
I hardly see him myself.

1248
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:27,252
Really? Why?

1249
01:48:27,419 --> 01:48:30,338
He's addicted to his work.

1250
01:48:31,173 --> 01:48:33,300
He works a 12-hour day.

1251
01:48:33,508 --> 01:48:37,220
He's gone by 8:00 a.m.
and isn't home till 8:00 p.m.

1252
01:48:37,345 --> 01:48:40,515
Is he an employee, or is it his own business?

1253
01:48:42,809 --> 01:48:44,477
His own business.

1254
01:48:46,062 --> 01:48:48,106
Import-export.

1255
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:51,318
He's responsible for everything.

1256
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:55,280
Set it up all by himself too.
- Very good.

1257
01:48:57,115 --> 01:49:01,036
I insisted on working just for fun.

1258
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:05,290
Otherwise he wouldn't have let me.

1259
01:49:05,457 --> 01:49:09,044
“If you work, people will say
I don't make enough.”

1260
01:49:09,169 --> 01:49:10,754
I see.

1261
01:49:11,046 --> 01:49:13,048
I said, “Why?

1262
01:49:13,465 --> 01:49:17,636
Everyone knows
how much you make.”

1263
01:49:18,261 --> 01:49:21,973
He finally said,
“AII right, but just for six months.”

1264
01:49:23,642 --> 01:49:26,144
There's just one month left.

1265
01:49:27,354 --> 01:49:29,105
Then <i>I'll</i> quit.

1266
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:44,431
My sense of direction is a bit weak.

1267
01:50:44,556 --> 01:50:46,683
- Take a right here.
- Right.

1268
01:50:47,559 --> 01:50:49,394
All right.

1269
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,403
Especially the Kalighat area.

1270
01:50:58,695 --> 01:51:00,780
I've put you to a lot of trouble.

1271
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:05,744
When I see that the streetcars aren't running,

1272
01:51:05,869 --> 01:51:10,415
I give a lift to anyone I see on the road.

1273
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:13,418
To tell you the truth,

1274
01:51:13,752 --> 01:51:16,087
when I see the plight of pedestrians,

1275
01:51:16,212 --> 01:51:18,465
I feel very guilty sometimes.

1276
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:24,888
I had quite an argument about this with my wife.

1277
01:51:25,013 --> 01:51:26,514
Why?

1278
01:51:28,183 --> 01:51:32,187
She said I mustn't stop for everyone I see in the street.

1279
01:51:33,313 --> 01:51:36,524
When I asked why, she said...

1280
01:51:36,649 --> 01:51:39,944
“How do you know they're not carrying infectious germs?

1281
01:51:40,945 --> 01:51:43,615
Disinfect the car
or I won't ride in it.”

1282
01:51:44,699 --> 01:51:46,659
She's crazy.

1283
01:51:47,494 --> 01:51:51,164
Please forgive my saying so,
Mrs. Mazumdar...

1284
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:53,291
but women get these obsessions.

1285
01:51:54,793 --> 01:51:57,295
She's obsessed with germs.

1286
01:51:57,629 --> 01:51:59,631
Three bottles of Dettol per month.

1287
01:52:08,056 --> 01:52:09,891
<i>Bhombol...</i>

1288
01:52:11,976 --> 01:52:15,939
did Arati say she'd be late?

1289
01:52:17,315 --> 01:52:19,526
No, she didn't say anything to me.

1290
01:52:27,826 --> 01:52:30,620
She's never been this late.

1291
01:52:46,344 --> 01:52:49,055
There's a car outside.
Go and see.

1292
01:52:57,188 --> 01:52:58,648
Bhombol.

1293
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,942
Bhombol, are you there?

1294
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,034
What happened?

1295
01:53:21,129 --> 01:53:22,630
What happened?

1296
01:53:22,755 --> 01:53:25,383
Please lie down slowly, sir.

1297
01:53:39,814 --> 01:53:42,066
What happened?

1298
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,903
Don't be upset.
It's nothing to worry about.

1299
01:53:45,028 --> 01:53:48,198
He felt a bit sick, so he came to my office.

1300
01:53:48,323 --> 01:53:51,576
He got dizzy on the stairs and fell.

1301
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:54,746
He walked a lot in the sun

1302
01:53:54,913 --> 01:53:57,081
and has blood pressure problems too.

1303
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:01,544
But there's no need to worry.

1304
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:05,006
I've written him a prescription,

1305
01:54:05,131 --> 01:54:08,092
and he must have complete rest.

1306
01:54:08,259 --> 01:54:10,136
Look after him, all right?

1307
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:13,264
I keep telling you not to go out so much.

1308
01:54:13,389 --> 01:54:16,518
- Have a seat.
- No, I have to rush.

1309
01:54:16,643 --> 01:54:19,395
Sir, <i>I'll</i> be leaving now.

1310
01:54:19,896 --> 01:54:22,857
Don't behave like a little child, all right?

1311
01:54:23,608 --> 01:54:25,902
Remember:
complete bed rest.

1312
01:54:26,778 --> 01:54:28,780
I'm a former pupil of his.

1313
01:54:28,905 --> 01:54:32,659
I haven't seen him
in 25 years. Right, sir?

1314
01:54:34,410 --> 01:54:37,080
I'm afraid
the circumstances weren't -

1315
01:54:38,748 --> 01:54:41,334
I have to be going.

1316
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:43,545
May I have a word?

1317
01:54:54,055 --> 01:54:57,475
I'm not asking for payment,

1318
01:54:57,976 --> 01:55:01,187
but there's something I have to tell you.

1319
01:55:01,646 --> 01:55:05,984
I have a feeling you're all neglecting him.

1320
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:10,655
Otherwise, with a grown son like you,

1321
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:12,865
there's no reason for him

1322
01:55:12,991 --> 01:55:17,203
to be out searching for a doctor on his own.

1323
01:55:17,579 --> 01:55:20,748
I know it's none of my business, but I had to tell you.

1324
01:55:20,873 --> 01:55:22,667
Well, <i>I'll</i> be going.

1325
01:55:38,057 --> 01:55:39,684
Horne.

1326
01:55:54,532 --> 01:55:55,992
No, wait.

1327
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:03,541
I'd never have found this place on my own.

1328
01:56:06,878 --> 01:56:09,047
Thank you very much.

1329
01:56:09,339 --> 01:56:10,673
Would you like to -

1330
01:56:10,798 --> 01:56:12,467
Not today.

1331
01:56:12,592 --> 01:56:17,055
Some other time, if I can remember the way.

1332
01:56:28,066 --> 01:56:29,734
What happened?

1333
01:56:30,234 --> 01:56:32,236
Is that Arati?

1334
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:36,908
I've warned him so often about wandering the streets,

1335
01:56:37,033 --> 01:56:38,826
but he never listens.

1336
01:56:38,951 --> 01:56:41,788
What if you'd hurt your head or something?

1337
01:56:41,913 --> 01:56:43,998
My glasses broke.

1338
01:56:45,083 --> 01:56:47,960
The ones Pranab gave me.

1339
01:56:49,045 --> 01:56:50,505
What happened?

1340
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:53,758
On his way to see a doctor, he felt dizzy and fell.

1341
01:56:53,925 --> 01:56:55,551
Good heavens!

1342
01:56:57,011 --> 01:56:59,055
How are you now, Baba?

1343
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:03,643
I've sinned too much to die just yet.

1344
01:57:03,768 --> 01:57:05,687
Don't say that, Baba.

1345
01:57:06,854 --> 01:57:09,941
I feel no pain physically,

1346
01:57:10,733 --> 01:57:13,736
but my thoughts

1347
01:57:14,445 --> 01:57:16,280
are very disturbed.

1348
01:57:16,948 --> 01:57:19,075
Try not to talk too much.

1349
01:57:19,909 --> 01:57:23,788
I said bad things about you, Arati.

1350
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:26,666
I said...

1351
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:29,335
you'd changed.

1352
01:57:31,254 --> 01:57:34,465
But you know what I did?

1353
01:57:37,051 --> 01:57:39,637
I went around to my pupils...

1354
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:44,559
and spoke ill of my own son.

1355
01:57:45,435 --> 01:57:47,145
I said...

1356
01:57:48,187 --> 01:57:50,440
he wasn't looking after me,

1357
01:57:50,565 --> 01:57:52,525
that you look after me.

1358
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:58,197
Now you must decide my punishment, Arati.

1359
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:02,326
Whatever it is...

1360
01:58:02,869 --> 01:58:05,496
<i>I'll</i> accept it.

1361
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:09,917
You know your punishment?

1362
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:12,795
You have to take all your medications,

1363
01:58:13,171 --> 01:58:16,340
and <i>I'll</i> administer them.

1364
01:58:19,677 --> 01:58:22,096
You're too lenient,
daughter-in-law.

1365
01:59:00,051 --> 01:59:02,011
<i>Listen...</i>

1366
01:59:02,261 --> 01:59:04,931
<i>I've only been late the last few days.</i>

1367
01:59:05,056 --> 01:59:07,642
It doesn't happen every day, does it?

1368
01:59:14,232 --> 01:59:16,734
You always have the Austin.

1369
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:19,153
It's just in the shop for a few days.

1370
01:59:20,154 --> 01:59:23,366
No, why? I'll send
the other car for you.

1371
01:59:24,909 --> 01:59:28,162
In an hour.
Do your shopping,

1372
01:59:28,287 --> 01:59:30,414
then come by my office
around 5:30.

1373
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:32,583
Yes, my office.

1374
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,923
Not even one minute.
Promise.

1375
01:59:47,056 --> 01:59:49,517
All right. But -

1376
01:59:51,435 --> 01:59:53,437
How many busy executives

1377
01:59:53,563 --> 01:59:56,190
would do so much for their wives?

1378
01:59:59,235 --> 02:00:01,445
Okay.

1379
02:00:07,243 --> 02:00:08,619
I've come -

1380
02:00:08,786 --> 02:00:12,123
I recognize you.
Aren't you Arati Debt's husband?

1381
02:00:12,415 --> 02:00:14,750
Unless I'm very much mistaken.

1382
02:00:15,793 --> 02:00:18,129
Yes, but -

1383
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:23,759
There was a snapshot of you in your wife's purse.

1384
02:00:23,885 --> 02:00:27,346
It fell out when she took out a sales report.

1385
02:00:27,805 --> 02:00:30,683
It was taken at the zoo,
in front of a camel -

1386
02:00:30,808 --> 02:00:33,311
- No, a giraffe.
- Giraffe - that's it!

1387
02:00:33,436 --> 02:00:35,980
- Your memory is really -
- Not at all.

1388
02:00:36,147 --> 02:00:38,357
I saw the name “Mazumdar” on my schedule,

1389
02:00:38,482 --> 02:00:41,444
and I've heard your voice on the phone.

1390
02:00:42,987 --> 02:00:45,281
I imagine Arati's out right now.

1391
02:00:45,406 --> 02:00:49,285
Yes, they leave by 10:30.
If you'd come a bit earlier -

1392
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:52,038
- Then <i>I'll</i> be going.
- No, please don't.

1393
02:00:52,163 --> 02:00:53,831
A tea, please.

1394
02:00:54,123 --> 02:00:57,835
What's the hurry?
You're free these days, right?

1395
02:00:58,002 --> 02:00:59,503
Well, yes...

1396
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:08,179
You're originally from Pabna.

1397
02:01:09,347 --> 02:01:12,058
You see, I keep abreast of things.

1398
02:01:13,267 --> 02:01:14,977
What village?

1399
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:18,189
The town of Pabna itself.

1400
02:01:20,024 --> 02:01:21,776
I'm from Sirajganj.

1401
02:01:21,901 --> 02:01:23,903
We're birds of a feather.

1402
02:01:27,782 --> 02:01:29,867
Your office is very nice.

1403
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:33,329
How's your wife enjoying the job?

1404
02:01:33,454 --> 02:01:37,208
She enjoys it, but it's causing a bit of strain.

1405
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:40,670
- But that's only recently.
- She gets home quite late.

1406
02:01:40,795 --> 02:01:43,005
You see, the thing <i>is...</i>

1407
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:45,841
she has
this Anglo-Indian colleague.

1408
02:01:45,967 --> 02:01:47,677
I shouldn't say this,

1409
02:01:47,802 --> 02:01:51,514
but our ex-rulers
left behind quite a clan!

1410
02:01:52,098 --> 02:01:55,601
The girl's been absent
for a few days. Says she's sick.

1411
02:01:55,726 --> 02:01:58,729
The truth may be something else entirely.

1412
02:01:58,854 --> 02:02:02,233
But your wife's had to take on her workload too.

1413
02:02:02,358 --> 02:02:05,903
Otherwise there'd be no question of overstraining.

1414
02:02:10,157 --> 02:02:13,411
Of course, there's no need to tell you.

1415
02:02:13,577 --> 02:02:15,579
After all...

1416
02:02:15,705 --> 02:02:18,416
you know her much better than I do.

1417
02:02:23,921 --> 02:02:26,215
The day of your “mishap”,

1418
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:29,885
she immediately pressured me for a raise.

1419
02:02:30,011 --> 02:02:33,639
In that sense she's certainly a bit impulsive,

1420
02:02:34,515 --> 02:02:36,642
but I couldn't refuse her.

1421
02:02:36,767 --> 02:02:39,061
With a conscientious worker,

1422
02:02:39,186 --> 02:02:43,024
you sometimes have to meet their additional demands.

1423
02:02:46,902 --> 02:02:48,320
Please.

1424
02:02:53,659 --> 02:02:56,245
Have you ever thought about a husband and wife

1425
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:58,497
working in the same office?

1426
02:02:58,664 --> 02:03:00,875
- No, I can't say -
- I have...

1427
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,169
and I don't approve.

1428
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:06,672
So if I'm to do anything for you,

1429
02:03:06,839 --> 02:03:09,550
it has to be somewhere else.

1430
02:03:10,468 --> 02:03:12,511
I didn't come here for a job.

1431
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:17,975
Don't you need a job?

1432
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:22,313
Yes, of course.

1433
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:25,566
Then where's the problem?

1434
02:03:28,277 --> 02:03:29,945
That's very kind of you.

1435
02:03:30,071 --> 02:03:32,114
This isn't about kindness, sir.

1436
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:34,742
I have a job and you don't.

1437
02:03:34,867 --> 02:03:39,789
It so happens I might have some influence that you don't.

1438
02:03:39,997 --> 02:03:42,041
The most important thing

1439
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,585
is that we're both from Pabna.

1440
02:03:45,336 --> 02:03:47,213
Couldn't be simpler.

1441
02:03:57,473 --> 02:03:59,517
Do one thing for me.

1442
02:04:00,226 --> 02:04:03,813
Come see me again
this evening around 5:00.

1443
02:04:03,938 --> 02:04:05,981
Would that be a problem?
- No.

1444
02:04:06,107 --> 02:04:09,443
In the meantime, <i>I'll</i> make a few calls, okay?

1445
02:04:09,568 --> 02:04:10,903
Let's go.

1446
02:04:11,028 --> 02:04:13,614
Should I tell your wife you came by?

1447
02:04:13,739 --> 02:04:16,325
No, you needn't tell her.

1448
02:05:08,961 --> 02:05:10,462
Edith?

1449
02:05:14,633 --> 02:05:16,468
What's going on?

1450
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:30,024
He fired you?

1451
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:36,655
He doesn't believe you?

1452
02:05:50,044 --> 02:05:51,420
Here.

1453
02:06:23,410 --> 02:06:26,163
What did you say to Edith?

1454
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:29,416
What did you say to Edith?

1455
02:06:37,049 --> 02:06:38,801
Did you insult her

1456
02:06:38,926 --> 02:06:41,887
or say something about her character?

1457
02:06:48,352 --> 02:06:52,064
Did you come to fight with me
about that Anglo-Indian girl?

1458
02:06:52,231 --> 02:06:54,275
What did you say to Edith?

1459
02:06:55,734 --> 02:06:58,612
Don't get so excited,
Mrs. Mazumdar.

1460
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:05,327
You didn't insult her?

1461
02:07:09,415 --> 02:07:11,583
Whether I did or not...

1462
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:14,878
I don't have to tell you,
Mrs. Mazumdar.

1463
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,842
You know nothing about her...

1464
02:07:20,926 --> 02:07:23,095
and still you insulted her?

1465
02:07:24,263 --> 02:07:25,973
You dismissed her?

1466
02:07:29,893 --> 02:07:31,937
Look, Mrs. Mazumdar...

1467
02:07:34,106 --> 02:07:36,817
what I do or what I tell

1468
02:07:36,942 --> 02:07:40,738
employees in my office -

1469
02:07:45,409 --> 02:07:47,786
Edith may be your employee,

1470
02:07:48,203 --> 02:07:50,539
but I've worked with her

1471
02:07:50,914 --> 02:07:53,000
for four months.

1472
02:07:54,084 --> 02:07:55,961
She's my friend.

1473
02:07:56,128 --> 02:07:59,757
I know her.
I've been to her house.

1474
02:08:00,299 --> 02:08:03,093
I saw with my own eyes that she was sick.

1475
02:08:06,096 --> 02:08:10,476
I don't know how friendly you are with Miss Simmons.

1476
02:08:14,521 --> 02:08:17,566
But may I ask you

1477
02:08:17,691 --> 02:08:19,985
how much you know

1478
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:22,154
about Anglo-Indian girls?

1479
02:08:23,405 --> 02:08:26,033
I don't know any other
Anglo-Indian girls...

1480
02:08:26,992 --> 02:08:29,286
but I do know Edith.

1481
02:08:29,411 --> 02:08:31,663
And I can tell you

1482
02:08:31,997 --> 02:08:35,918
she doesn't deserve to be insulted.

1483
02:08:36,043 --> 02:08:38,128
I didn't insult her!

1484
02:08:40,798 --> 02:08:43,634
She got what she deserved.

1485
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:48,097
The day I realized
that a Bengali girl, meaning you -

1486
02:08:50,557 --> 02:08:54,395
Why can't you understand I fired her for your sake?

1487
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:58,357
When I realized you could handle
her job, I decided to fire her.

1488
02:08:58,524 --> 02:09:01,902
Only my sense of obligation kept her here this long.

1489
02:09:02,027 --> 02:09:04,863
Why are you interfering?
What do you gain?

1490
02:09:08,575 --> 02:09:11,453
You're jeopardizing your own position.

1491
02:09:14,373 --> 02:09:17,918
Would your friend do the same for you?

1492
02:09:18,752 --> 02:09:21,004
You've gone mad.

1493
02:09:24,883 --> 02:09:27,845
You've no right to say anything about her character,

1494
02:09:28,512 --> 02:09:30,681
especially when it isn't true.

1495
02:09:31,723 --> 02:09:35,018
It's injustice, and it's wrong.

1496
02:09:36,228 --> 02:09:37,938
Mrs. Mazumdar...

1497
02:09:38,313 --> 02:09:40,232
your words

1498
02:09:40,357 --> 02:09:43,444
would be more apt coming from my side of this desk,

1499
02:09:43,569 --> 02:09:45,320
not yours.

1500
02:09:45,446 --> 02:09:47,406
You're overstepping your bounds.

1501
02:09:50,284 --> 02:09:52,077
I think...

1502
02:09:54,037 --> 02:09:56,039
you should apologize to her.

1503
02:10:00,419 --> 02:10:02,588
Will you do that?

1504
02:10:05,048 --> 02:10:06,592
Will you?

1505
02:10:12,598 --> 02:10:16,101
Mrs. Mazumdar,
you don't understand that -

1506
02:10:23,942 --> 02:10:26,278
You don't understand

1507
02:10:26,403 --> 02:10:29,490
that your attitude could have serious consequences.

1508
02:10:29,823 --> 02:10:33,619
You won't apologize?

1509
02:10:34,244 --> 02:10:37,623
If you lose your job, what then?

1510
02:10:37,789 --> 02:10:39,249
Then...

1511
02:10:40,459 --> 02:10:42,461
I'd be very happy-

1512
02:10:50,802 --> 02:10:53,138
Here.
- What's that?

1513
02:10:53,555 --> 02:10:56,642
My resignation.
Change the date.

1514
02:11:45,399 --> 02:11:47,276
What's going on?

1515
02:11:59,538 --> 02:12:01,331
What's going on?

1516
02:12:08,297 --> 02:12:11,383
Don't be angry.
Don't misunderstand me.

1517
02:12:11,508 --> 02:12:15,178
Everyone else will misunderstand.
Don't you too.

1518
02:12:15,304 --> 02:12:17,347
But what happened?

1519
02:12:18,348 --> 02:12:20,225
I quit my job

1520
02:12:21,518 --> 02:12:23,270
You quit?

1521
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:29,192
Himangshu-babu
fired Edith for no reason.

1522
02:12:29,484 --> 02:12:33,322
She'd done nothing wrong, but he wouldn't listen.

1523
02:12:36,366 --> 02:12:39,036
Now she can't get married.

1524
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:42,039
I felt so bad for her.

1525
02:12:42,414 --> 02:12:45,834
It seemed like
such a gross injustice that I -

1526
02:12:52,257 --> 02:12:54,176
You're angry.

1527
02:12:55,218 --> 02:12:57,304
I can tell you're angry.

1528
02:12:58,430 --> 02:13:00,849
Who can I turn to now?

1529
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:09,024
Don't cry.

1530
02:13:09,149 --> 02:13:11,151
I'm not angry, you hear?

1531
02:13:11,276 --> 02:13:13,278
I'm not angry...

1532
02:13:14,029 --> 02:13:16,114
though I can't be too happy either.

1533
02:13:16,281 --> 02:13:18,283
You know our situation.

1534
02:13:18,408 --> 02:13:20,952
I know.
I made a big mistake.

1535
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:22,788
Don't say that.

1536
02:13:22,913 --> 02:13:25,207
Listen to me.

1537
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:29,252
You stood up to injustice.
Was that wrong?

1538
02:13:29,378 --> 02:13:31,672
I could never have done what you did.

1539
02:13:31,797 --> 02:13:33,965
I wouldn't have had the courage.

1540
02:13:34,091 --> 02:13:37,302
Earning our daily bread has made us cowards.

1541
02:13:37,469 --> 02:13:40,931
But you weren't a coward.
Is that a small achievement?

1542
02:13:41,056 --> 02:13:43,600
Why should I be angry with you?

1543
02:13:44,309 --> 02:13:47,062
I feel scared.
Very scared.

1544
02:13:47,187 --> 02:13:49,314
Why? I'm by your side.

1545
02:13:55,654 --> 02:13:58,740
- You're by my side?
- Where else?

1546
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:04,246
You moved so far away from me.

1547
02:14:04,371 --> 02:14:06,415
Don't go any further.

1548
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:08,959
Arati, don't cry.

1549
02:14:09,835 --> 02:14:12,087
This is the time to be strong.

1550
02:14:12,212 --> 02:14:14,589
How will we manage if you break down?

1551
02:14:14,715 --> 02:14:16,508
Don't cry.

1552
02:14:32,149 --> 02:14:33,817
Such a big city.

1553
02:14:35,318 --> 02:14:37,320
So many different jobs.

1554
02:14:40,449 --> 02:14:42,576
Surely one of us can find a job.

1555
02:14:43,410 --> 02:14:45,036
Let's try.

1556
02:14:46,371 --> 02:14:48,373
I'm sure we both will.

1557
02:14:50,584 --> 02:14:52,377
You know...

1558
02:14:52,753 --> 02:14:54,796
even facing this difficult moment...

1559
02:14:55,881 --> 02:14:58,467
not knowing what fate has in store...

1560
02:15:00,051 --> 02:15:02,012
I feel very happy-

1561
02:15:03,013 --> 02:15:05,140
You're not scared anymore?

1562
02:15:05,932 --> 02:15:07,559
Feel.

1563
02:15:13,273 --> 02:15:15,734
- Shall we?
- Let's.

1564
02:15:52,312 --> 02:15:56,441
THE END
