00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:02,368
"Has left you
alone and gone away."

4
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:08,250
"Calls you nearer to
these two eyes from afar."

5
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,245
Meena.

6
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:27,453
Hey, Meena..

7
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:31,036
Get up, it's morning.

8
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:43,245
Look, if you don't stop dreaming..

9
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,411
Then the night will
have to begin again.

10
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:53,536
How did you know I was dreaming?

11
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:58,120
I can understand these
things by gazing at you.

12
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,203
What were you dreaming of?
Let me also know.

13
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,286
You'll get jealous?

14
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,370
I see.

15
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,245
So you were dreaming
about somebody else?

16
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,120
That's nice. My wife has
become a modern woman now.

17
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:23,828
Doesn't matter.. doesn't matter,
I'll reap the benefit.

18
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:30,411
Is it? So,
now time will stop for you?

19
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,953
The train is at 7 o'clock.
At least get up now, Mr. Vinod.

20
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,620
- Bahadur, has the driver arrived?
- Yes, madam.

21
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,995
- Take sir's luggage downstairs.
- Darling tea. Oh.

22
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,895
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

23
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:52,196
- Hey, listen.
- Yes?

24
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:54,620
- Keep the bag in front, not in the dickey.
- Yes, sir.

25
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:56,078
Darling, come on, hurry up.

26
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:03,643
Won't the meeting be
done by tomorrow?

27
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,768
Possible. I may come back
by tomorrow.

28
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:09,351
- Father.
- Mitthu, up so early?

29
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:12,059
Are you ready already?
I, too, will come to station.

30
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:14,351
Oh, lovely.
But I'm leaving in 5 minutes.

31
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,101
I am the boarding champion.

32
00:09:16,184 --> 00:09:18,268
I'll be ready in half that time.

33
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,976
- Bahadur, bring milk for my dear child.
- Yes, madam.

34
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:29,393
And this?

35
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:31,434
Give me.

36
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,684
You are just like Mitthu?

37
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:36,393
Hasn't he become so smart?
And tall as well.

38
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,518
- Just like you.
- What? Smart or tall?

39
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,045
Of course. Mother,
we'll watch Jango today.

40
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,670
No, no, you go along
with Sunil and Mani.

41
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,920
- I don't want to watch Jango.
- No, I won't take Mani along.

42
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:54,003
Why? What's the matter?
Fought again?

43
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:56,878
- Yes.
- What happened this time?

44
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:58,628
Forget it, Mother.

45
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:02,628
Mitthu, until you tell her,
your Mother won't leave you alone.

46
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,336
You know how much your Mother
worries over such small matters.

47
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,878
She worries needlessly.

48
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:12,420
- Yes, tell me.
- The same old thing, Mother.

49
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,711
About the book? Did you apologise?

50
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,503
He uses foul language.
I won't apologise.

51
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,836
No, Mitthu. You were at fault.

52
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,753
- You'll have to apologise.
- But, Mother he's such a fighter.

53
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,211
Is it that right and
wrong argument again?

54
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,086
Mitthu, Mother will never
give you any wrong advice.

55
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,378
- You apologise, okay?
- Okay.

56
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,920
What cinema is Jango running in?

57
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:35,753
- In Shri Cinema.
- Shri?

58
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,295
Years ago, we used to
live in that neighbourhood.

59
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:40,753
What terrible days
we've spent there!

60
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,586
Everyday, we had to deal
with a new problem there.

61
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:47,112
- Vinod, you remember the day, that south Indian..
- Meena, please.

62
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:49,711
Is it necessary to
remember the past? Forget it.

63
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,003
"John Brown's body lies
smoldering in the grave."

64
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:55,253
"John Brown's body."

65
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,586
It's very late.
The train will just be leaving.

66
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,878
You both return from here,
I'll rush.

67
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:05,795
- Bye, Mitthu.
- Bye.

68
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:12,211
- Bye. I'll come soon.
- Come soon.

69
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,586
Yes.

70
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:25,961
"Drops will shower on every leaf."

71
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:31,753
"Monsoon will swing
on every branch."

72
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,920
Bhajji, chop some
more onion and chillies.

73
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:38,878
"Monsoon will swing
on every branch."

74
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:44,128
"Rain will kiss thirsty lips."

75
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:49,295
"Rain will kiss thirsty lips."

76
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:54,670
- "Today, monsoon.."
- Mother, a letter for you, two for Father.

77
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:57,128
For me? Keep them in Father's room.

78
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:02,670
"Today, monsoon will
dance in the eyes."

79
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,586
Call me when the chicken's ready.

80
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:14,920
"Is how the ambience
has transformed into."

81
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,751
'Donald house, Colaba, Mumbai..'

82
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,389
'Mrs. Joshi,
my name is Man Singh.'

83
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,418
'I saw it with my own eyes.'

84
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:34,835
'Subramaniam didn't kill Kale,
your husband did.'

85
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,043
'He gave a false statement and
got that poor man sent to jail.'

86
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:43,585
'With that stolen money, you
people suddenly became rich.'

87
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:46,751
'I've kept the truth hidden
in my heart for 10 years.'

88
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,168
'Perhaps,
it's not possible anymore.'

89
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:52,043
'I think I should go to police.'

90
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:55,960
'What? Death penalty? Vinod?'

91
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,626
'What's he saying?'

92
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,376
'Mrs. Joshi,
my name is Man Singh.'

93
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:03,418
'I saw it with my own eyes.'

94
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,793
'Subramaniam didn't kill Kale,
your husband did.'

95
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,918
'With that stolen money,
you people suddenly became rich.'

96
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,293
- Let loose.
- Slow.. slow, sir. Watch out.

97
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,543
'Why wasn't I shattered
on reading that letter?'

98
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,293
'Neither any blow, nor any shock?'

99
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:24,501
'Somebody has played a
very cheap prank. Disgusting.'

100
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,543
'Man Singh.
Who's this Man Singh?'

101
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:36,376
'Why does Vinod always gets
disturbed about past matters?'

102
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,668
'There's definitely
something wrong.'

103
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:45,710
'No, no. Vinod a thief, a murderer?
It's impossible.'

104
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:51,876
'But if it is true then Mitthu...?
What will he go through?'

105
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,710
'I don't understand what to do.'

106
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,335
'Should I tell this to Vinod, or..'
- Madam, how long until dinner?

107
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:02,394
- We'll eat early tonight. Set the table.
- Lower it.. lower it.

108
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:05,043
- First you let it loose.
- Mitthu, come on, leave the kite.

109
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,871
Look, you have to bathe, too.

110
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,391
- Today, we'll eat early and sleep early, okay?
- Yes, Mother.

111
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,793
- Comics again? Are you going to read or sleep?
- Both.

112
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,668
Okay, but don't stay
up for long, okay?

113
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,460
Son, drink your milk.

114
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,710
Mitthu, don't be obstinate.

115
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:30,751
- Then how will you become like Father?
- Okay.

116
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,710
Mother, Jango was really fun today.

117
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:44,876
He fired pistol and
there was blood everywhere.

118
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,280
'What happened, you got hurt?'
- 'No, no.'

119
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,598
'But this blood? What happened?'

120
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,769
- 'A murder in our office.
- Murder?'

121
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:00,453
'No.'

122
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,453
Hello, Darling?

123
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:26,703
I came early, didn't I?

124
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,994
Hey? Meena?

125
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,453
So much affection?

126
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:45,328
- Hi, Father.
- Mr. Joshi, how are you?

127
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,661
Fine.

128
00:15:47,161 --> 00:15:48,845
- What time shall we fix for fishing?
- Tomorrow.

129
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:50,994
Tomorrow? I have a
lot of work tomorrow.

130
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:06,786
Hey, Meena.

131
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:11,619
Darling, I love you so much.

132
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,911
'This is my Vinod.'

133
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:29,453
'What does a murderer look like?

134
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,119
That's all the love
you've got for me? What?

135
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,494
'Shall I tell him everything?'

136
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:06,703
'No, I should forget that prank.'

137
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:10,494
'Vinod is so nice, so innocent.'

138
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,161
Meena, you look so nice today.

139
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,327
I wonder how I won you over.

140
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:26,743
Honestly speaking, Meena..

141
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:29,369
I can do anything for you.

142
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,953
Hey, don't apply the cream today.

143
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,994
Let's surprise Mitthu tomorrow.
Let's go to the beach.

144
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,744
I'll go to office after lunch.

145
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:55,041
Okay, Mitthu, tell me, how would
six elephants sit in a car?

146
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,536
- It's an old one, Father.
- Do you know it?

147
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,054
This is such an old one.
Third standard.

148
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,131
Then tell me,
if you know how they could.

149
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:02,078
Okay, three in front
and three behind.

150
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:04,909
- Mother must have told you.
- Don't dunk me, Father.

151
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:07,286
What happened? Is the water
going into your mouth?

152
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,411
"When the heart's broken.."

153
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,619
'What happened? What is he doing?

154
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:14,869
' "She" doing.'

155
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:18,453
' "He" doing.
We'll have a son, understand?'

156
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:26,953
'Meena, our son won't live
in these conditions.'

157
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,994
'He'll get everything I didn't.'

158
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,203
One, two, three.

159
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:38,136
- Wait, I'll show you, Father.
- What you'll show me?

160
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:39,536
- I'll turn..
- Hey..

161
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:40,616
No, dad.

162
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,244
- Mitthu, come on, now..
- 'Could Vinod kill for our happiness?'

163
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:48,203
- She won't come.
- She will, come on.

164
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:52,011
Hey, cheater.. cheater, you started
earlier. You started earlier.

165
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:54,369
Cheater.. cheater.. cheater.

166
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,456
Mother, come on, you also join us

167
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:03,494
- Come on, please.
- No, Mitthu, not today.

168
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:07,453
Come on, please. The water's
very cold. It'll be a lot of fun.

169
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:10,828
- Father, tell her.
- Come on. Come on.

170
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:14,328
- No, I didn't bring spare clothes.
- So what? No crowd today.

171
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:16,911
- No.
- No? Mitthu.

172
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,453
- 1..
- No.

173
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:19,653
- 2..
- No.

174
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,286
- 3.
- No.

175
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:25,286
- No. No.. no, not like this.
- Pull her in. Pull her in.

176
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,494
- Come on.
- No, listen. No, Vinod. No.

177
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,578
- Come on.
- What are you doing? No.

178
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,448
What's the matter, Meena?
Come on, relax.

179
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,828
- Look at me, dad!
- Enjoy yourself.

180
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,619
Are you all right?

181
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,244
'I shouldn't think
about it anymore.'

182
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,161
Meena, pass me a
chapatti (Indian bread).

183
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:03,865
Meena, where are you lost?
Pass me a chapatti please.

184
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:20,657
'Vinod is everything for me.
Everything.'

185
00:20:21,407 --> 00:20:23,324
'He's given me so
much of happiness.'

186
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,101
- Father.
- Yes?

187
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,969
Remember, we've to go for
'Guns of Navarone'?

188
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:31,762
- Yes, I remember. We'll go next week.
- Tell uncle Desai..

189
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:32,982
I want to go hunting.

190
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:35,516
You're too young to go hunting.
Right, Mother?

191
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,748
- Yes. No hunting and all.
- Did you hear?

192
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,408
Oh, Mother, I'm old enough.

193
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:40,991
- Bahadur, bring the rice.
- Yes.

194
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:46,991
'I must behave normal.'

195
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,995
'I should get a grip on myself.'

196
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:53,825
- What happened, Meena? Why haven't you eaten anything?
- No, I have.

197
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,158
Father, lentils please.

198
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,341
Yes, bring the bowl.

199
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,166
Meena, where's your nail cutter?

200
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,457
Must be on the dressing table.

201
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,082
Found it?

202
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,374
When did you get this letter?

203
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,249
When you were in Pune.

204
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:29,666
You didn't tell me.

205
00:22:30,627 --> 00:22:33,499
Vinod, I.. I wanted..

206
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:44,374
Vinod, I really..

207
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,041
So, this letter is why you have
been disturbed since so many days.

208
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:53,874
And I thought that you were unwell.

209
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,541
Meena..

210
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,666
Do you believe this letter?

211
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,124
Meena?

212
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,332
Do you think this letter is true?

213
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,041
Meena, you..

214
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,916
Tell me, Meena, tell me.

215
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:30,457
- Oh, darling..
- I would've told you, Vinod.

216
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:33,791
- I didn't believe this.
- Meena, you..

217
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,082
But, my mind..

218
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,791
Meena, you hid the matter
from me that's why your mind..

219
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,832
Okay, now that you're in the open,
your mind will ease up a little.

220
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,082
Okay, please, darling,
stop crying. Please.

221
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:51,082
This is for ice-cream
and anything else, okay?

222
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:54,791
Mother, please give more.
Sunil is also coming along.

223
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,041
- Rs.5 more. Enough?
- Thank you.

224
00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:00,082
- Hi, everybody.
- Father.

225
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,624
- Yes?
- You came early today?

226
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,058
Yes, Son, I didn't
have much work today.

227
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,475
I have to go to Delhi
the day after tomorrow.

228
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:06,916
I thought I'd spend some
time with my family today.

229
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:08,166
Mitthu.

230
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:10,166
Hey, come on, let's go to Alibaug.

231
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,642
We'll be back by
tomorrow afternoon.

232
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,499
No, Dad. Today is last
day of 'Johnny's Revenge'.

233
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:17,041
And Sunil's waiting, too. Bye.

234
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,499
- Mitthu.
- Bye.

235
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:22,457
- Cross the road carefully.
- Yes, Mother.

236
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,666
'Johnny's Revenge'.

237
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,249
You should've called if
you wanted to go to Alibaug.

238
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,957
You're right.
I should've called up.

239
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:07,582
Oh, Madam, it's all right
if Alibaug plan's scrapped..

240
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:09,916
But at least come to me.

241
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:17,916
You're here, I'm here.
We both are here.

242
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,916
Meena, it's been so long, since
your fingers fondled with my hair.

243
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,749
Come on, get started.

244
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:29,166
Lovely.

245
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:37,041
- Vinod, is it true?
- What?

246
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,957
What?

247
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:51,249
Meena, I won't answer
this question, you will.

248
00:25:52,582 --> 00:25:54,916
Do you believe I can do this?

249
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:58,207
What're you thinking?

250
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:02,582
Meena, you know me best.
Could I kill anybody?

251
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:04,166
For money?

252
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:06,416
Could I send an
innocent man to jail?

253
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:10,374
Tell me. Answer me, Meena.

254
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:16,832
- This means, you believe the letter.
- No, Vinod.

255
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,832
- Then why did you ask me?
- Vinod, my hand..

256
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,666
What? You believed
that I'm a killer?

257
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:28,874
No, Vinod, I didn't say that.
It is that letter.

258
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,207
Make me understand,
Vinod, I want to understand.

259
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,416
- What do you want to understand?
- Everything.

260
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,124
Who is Man Singh?

261
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:39,999
Man Singh was a
junior clerk in our firm.

262
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,124
I didn't know him well.

263
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:45,124
He says that he was present
there on the night of the murder.

264
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:46,874
I didn't see him.

265
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,791
After the case,
he tried to blackmail me.

266
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,749
He said that I was the murderer.

267
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:53,791
Why didn't you inform
the police about this?

268
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:56,916
Meena, you know how disturbed
I was during the case.

269
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,832
And if I hadn't done anything,
then why should I be afraid?

270
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:03,416
If this were true,
then why didn't he go to police?

271
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,041
It seems he's here to
harass me again.

272
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,374
Why is he targeting only you?

273
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:14,332
Because, Meena, that
night only Subramaniam..

274
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,457
Kale and I were working overtime.

275
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:18,291
Even the guard was not around.

276
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,541
This wicked man just wants to
threaten me and extort money.

277
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:24,374
- How?
- By taking undue advantage of the opportunity.

278
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:28,541
Had it been someone weak,
he'd have been afraid. But I won't.

279
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,541
After the case,
he suddenly disappeared.

280
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,416
And now, after so many years,
he came to my office last week.

281
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:38,666
I refused to meet him.

282
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:40,832
And now this letter..

283
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,666
Which you believe in.

284
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:49,499
No, Vinod, no. Not anymore.

285
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:54,968
- Mitthu, read the weekly later, first drink your milk.
- Yes, Mother.

286
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,666
This inspection guy
is really in a jam.

287
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,749
Is it necessary to go
to the office today?

288
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,041
Yes. It's better to get as
much work done, before leaving.

289
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,964
Otherwise, I'll suffer
after coming from Delhi.

290
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:11,957
- Dad. - Yes?
- Your office has been mentioned in the weekly.

291
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,082
- Show.. show.
- In weekly? Show me.

292
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,433
- Ladies first.
- I.. I'll read. I'll read.

293
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:18,558
- 'Cases that have baffled the police'.
- Not this, Father.

294
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:20,558
- It's below that. - Mitthu, let me read first.
- Look at the photo.

295
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,600
'We don't like losing, said the
commissioner of Bombay police..'

296
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:24,874
'Mr. Subramaniam an
employee of Ajay Shipping..'

297
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,999
He got arrested
for theft and murder?

298
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:33,582
My goodness, Father.
Even the stolen money wasn't found.

299
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:35,999
Goodness, Rs.100,000.

300
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,332
And all this in your office?

301
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,791
Please tell me, Father.
Were you there?

302
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:43,332
Mitthu, come on. Drink your milk.

303
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:50,249
He really committed murder?

304
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:56,166
- It's all rubbish.
- Then why is he in jail? And is he still in jail?

305
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:58,249
Mitthu, drink your milk.

306
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:05,166
Just imagine, it's been so many
years and the police's still baffled.

307
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:09,374
- Father, you must tell me the whole story.
- Mitthu, drink your milk.

308
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,124
Keep my bag ready
for my Delhi trip.

309
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:26,374
- Bye, Mitthu.
- Bye.

310
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:29,582
It's all rubbish.

311
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,374
Darn it. It had to arrive today.

312
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:56,374
Whenever this matter is mentioned..

313
00:30:57,874 --> 00:30:59,582
You get very perturbed.

314
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,249
Why is it so, Vinod?

315
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:09,166
A part of my life
is connected to it.

316
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,791
It's over now.

317
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:18,707
I don't even want its
shadow to fall on my life today.

318
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:23,041
It's like a nightmare for me.

319
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:29,332
Meena.. Meena, forget that letter.

320
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:31,832
Why can't we live a happy life?

321
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:40,499
Forget it, Meena,
please forget it for my sake.

322
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,041
You've set the alarm?

323
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:22,999
Come on, go to sleep, Meena.

324
00:32:26,707 --> 00:32:28,124
Did you need the pill?

325
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,207
The meeting tomorrow
is very important.

326
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:49,624
"Monsoon will swing
on every branch."

327
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:57,124
"Monsoon will swing
on every branch."

328
00:32:57,451 --> 00:33:02,499
"Rain will kiss thirsty lips."

329
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:07,582
"Rain will kiss thirsty lips."

330
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:11,541
"Today monsoon will
dance in the eyes."

331
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:15,249
'Sleeping pills again?
This will become a daily habit.'

332
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:18,207
'Yes, Meena, it's needed,
otherwise I can't sleep.'

333
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,499
'The case is about to
start and I'm very nervous.'

334
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:29,457
'Vinod would get annoyed on
every matter back those days.'

335
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,541
'Sleeping pills..'

336
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:34,874
'I don't understand anything.'

337
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:47,202
"Clouds have started showering,
tonight."

338
00:33:52,057 --> 00:34:00,057
"Tonight, let the clouds shower."

339
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:10,575
"Let the clouds.. the clouds..
The cloud shower."

340
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:16,832
'Got the money?'

341
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,791
- 'No.
- Then?'

342
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:23,749
'I'll have to arrange
through other means.'

343
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:27,874
- 'Please sell my jewellery.
- Don't be silly. Not at all.'

344
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:32,165
'I know we desperately need money,
and I'll get it somehow.'

345
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:38,082
'Those days we were
always in need of money.'

346
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,416
'I wish, I knew more about it.'

347
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:46,832
'Vinod always kept
the matter to himself.'

348
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:57,688
"Far away from my house,
like a showering cloud.."

349
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,840
"There must be some
relation somewhere for sure."

350
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:16,457
'How did we end up
with so much of money?'

351
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,499
'Immediately after the case?'

352
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,541
'Police didn't find the money.'

353
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,814
'Then?'

354
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,791
'Vinod, who's this
Man Singh after all?'

355
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,166
'Why was he quiet
for all these days?'

356
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,041
'Why didn't he go to police?'

357
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:41,666
'Did.. did you give him the money?'

358
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,624
Father, what was the delay?

359
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,498
The plane arrived late
from Hyderabad, Son.

360
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:54,166
- Isn't that a Jumbo?
- Yes.

361
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,999
- It has a Rolls Royce engine, right?
- Yes, perhaps.

362
00:35:58,478 --> 00:36:01,582
- Which one is your plane?
- That one, Boeing.

363
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:04,499
- Father, look your luggage.
- Mitthu, you'll fall down.

364
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,457
Listen, go and get a
comic for yourself.

365
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,707
Oh, good. One more Astrix.
Thanks, Father.

366
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,541
'I.C. 105 is now ready to
take off for Bangalore.'

367
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,749
'Passengers are requested..'

368
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:18,624
'..to please proceed towards
their aircraft. Thank you.'

369
00:36:22,165 --> 00:36:24,749
Meena, you're still disturbed.

370
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,268
I don't understand, Meena.

371
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:31,476
You're my wife. We love each other.

372
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:34,559
And a letter has made you
question your faith in me?

373
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:37,184
No, Vinod, I want to believe you.

374
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:40,184
After spending 10-12
years together..

375
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:42,559
You are saying you
want to believe me?

376
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:44,785
Meena, after such a long time, you
don't force yourself to believe..

377
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:46,289
It should be your
secondary nature.

378
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,976
Is our love so weak?

379
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:52,351
Can't you throw a
letter out of our life?

380
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:56,434
Vinod, where did you
get that money from?

381
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,643
What money?

382
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,577
The one with which we bought
the house in Alibaug..

383
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:05,893
Bought a car. We became rich
after the case due to that money.

384
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,518
- So, the matter has reached this far?
- Vinod, I just..

385
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:14,559
Meena, I'm no longer a suspect.

386
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:17,351
- You have made me an offender.
- Vinod?

387
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,601
You'll question me on every step.
You'll argue on every matter.

388
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:25,101
Meena, your eyes..

389
00:37:27,183 --> 00:37:29,559
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

390
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:33,393
Anyway, it's a good question.

391
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,184
If it's important for
you to know then listen.

392
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,726
I earned that money
in the share market..

393
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,809
Right after the case.

394
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,518
But this is just a coincidence.

395
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,393
Meena, if you demand
account of each and every rupee..

396
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,393
Then I can't present
it and I wouldn't as well.

397
00:37:52,555 --> 00:37:56,226
Meena, the doubt that
has crept in your belief..

398
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,184
That could pose problems
between us.

399
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:01,684
I know, that you think a
lot about truth and lies.

400
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:04,143
And sometimes, too much thinking..

401
00:38:04,226 --> 00:38:06,184
Forces you to believe
in lies as well.

402
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:11,393
But, Meena, happiness never
come when you request for it.

403
00:38:11,684 --> 00:38:13,393
One has to work on it.

404
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,809
And if we lose it even once..

405
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:18,684
Then neither of us
will be able to recover it.

406
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:22,893
Mitthu is a child now.
If something happens..

407
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,726
Then he'll never forgive us.

408
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:28,768
Why are you silent?

409
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,809
Speak, Meena.
Crying won't help anything.

410
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:35,018
All this should finish
when I return from Delhi.

411
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:37,819
Do whatever you want to, Meena, but
I can't live with you like this.

412
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,893
- Vinod..
- Father.. Father, quick, your flight's been announced.

413
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,601
- Yes, I heard it. Bought comics?
- Yes.

414
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:47,434
- Mother, come on, come quick.
- Okay, Mitthu, bye.

415
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:52,934
Father, you're going for
two days and Mother's crying.

416
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,325
- 1963-64, is it correct?
- Yes.

417
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:40,450
'Vinod, forgive me.
It's important for me to know.'

418
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:10,461
'When we do overtime..'

419
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:13,670
'..the guard brings tea
from downstairs at 8:30pm.'

420
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,128
'I was restless for tea.'

421
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:19,961
'And I looked at my watch.
It was 8:25pm.'

422
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:22,628
'And right then,
I heard a painful scream.'

423
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:25,378
'My cabin was on one
side of the corridor.'

424
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:28,045
About 30 feet away
from Kale's cabin.'

425
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,715
'I came out of the cabin..'

426
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,556
'..and I saw Kale falling down in
the corridor in front of his cabin.'

427
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:35,920
'He was pointing
towards the staircase.'

428
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,378
'He was drenched in blood.'

429
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,018
I took him in my arms.

430
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,526
'He was murmuring, "Subbu..Subbu".'

431
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:44,391
'I kept him of the floor
and rushed towards the staircase.'

432
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:47,282
'Yes, that's my paper knife.'

433
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:49,574
'My fingerprints would be on it.'

434
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:53,480
'I used it everyday in office
for opening letters and stuff.'

435
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:56,397
'This knife would
always be on my table.'

436
00:40:56,564 --> 00:41:00,272
'And my table was in
front of Kale's cabin.'

437
00:41:00,814 --> 00:41:03,189
'The staircase was on
one side of the bathroom..'

438
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,230
'..on one side of the corridor.'

439
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,689
'I left office at 8:15pm.'

440
00:41:07,814 --> 00:41:10,522
'I had told Kale that
I might leave early for home.'

441
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:12,689
'Nobody saw me going home.'

442
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:22,730
'We all knew that there was
money in Kale's cabin that night.'

443
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,272
'And.. and Kale's habit
of going to bathroom..'

444
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:28,439
'..was famous across the office.'

445
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:31,522
'He used to take at least
15-20 minutes in the bathroom.'

446
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:35,064
'But anybody in the
office could've done this.'

447
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:41,230
'I didn't kill anyone.
I don't have the money.'

448
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,522
'How could I kill Kale?
He was my good friend.'

449
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,897
'He'd asked me to open the
safe so many times. But..'

450
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,314
'When I reached the staircase,
there was nobody there.'

451
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,383
'I peeped out of a
window on the second floor.'

452
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:10,832
'There was nobody outside.'

453
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:12,897
'Suddenly. Subramaniam
came out of the building.'

454
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,995
'He was running and looking
here and there in nervousness.'

455
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:17,189
'He was carrying a
paper parcel in his hand.'

456
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:19,272
'All this is lie.'

457
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:22,689
'Joshi was alone with Kale.
He, too, could've done all this.'

458
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:24,605
'He must've done all this.'

459
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:26,522
'Why would I do all this?'

460
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:35,522
'That man was Subramaniam.
I recognised him.'

461
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:37,814
'Who else could it be?'

462
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:41,689
'Average height, well built body,
partially bald.'

463
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,564
'He was someone else.'

464
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:47,272
'I didn't commit the murder.
I don't have the money.'

465
00:42:47,687 --> 00:42:50,105
'The man Joshi saw
was someone else.'

466
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,564
'I told you that it
was bright downstairs.'

467
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:06,105
'I believe,
that man was Subramaniam.'

468
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:07,939
'Kale, too, mentioned him.'

469
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:09,557
'That man has to be Subramaniam.'

470
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:10,939
'Who else could it be?'

471
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,814
'And hence, I sentence you
to rigorous imprisonment.'

472
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:20,814
'No.. no. No, this is all a lie.
This is all a lie.'

473
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:22,431
'Somebody save me.'

474
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:25,855
'No.. no. You can't do this.'

475
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:29,897
'I didn't do anything.
I didn't kill anybody.'

476
00:43:30,064 --> 00:43:33,355
'No.. no.. no. Save me.'

477
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,522
'For God's sake, save me.'

478
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:37,689
'What will happen to
my wife and children?'

479
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,980
'This is sheer damnation.'

480
00:43:45,272 --> 00:43:47,605
'If Subramaniam had really left..'

481
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:50,772
'..then there was some other
man who fled with the money.'

482
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:53,522
'The man who Vinod
saw was Subramaniam.'

483
00:43:53,689 --> 00:43:57,314
'But did Vinod
really see Subramaniam?'

484
00:43:57,689 --> 00:43:59,689
'This is what Vinod says.'

485
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:02,855
'The matter's only
between Vinod and Subramaniam.'

486
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,772
- Mother.
- 'No.. no, this..'

487
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,439
Mother.

488
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:11,272
Shall I invite Sunil for
lunch tomorrow or for dinner?

489
00:44:13,147 --> 00:44:15,897
- Mitthu, won't you drink milk?
- I've finished it, Mother.

490
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,397
Invite him for lunch.

491
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:21,272
'Where was Man Singh then?'

492
00:44:22,105 --> 00:44:23,439
'Where did the money go?'

493
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:26,230
'It's not with Subramaniam.'

494
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:30,314
Mother, these days
you don't talk to me.

495
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,647
- And Father, too, is not here.
- Oh, Mitthu.

496
00:44:34,564 --> 00:44:37,980
Tell me, Lalita, who said that.

497
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:41,272
- Tell me.
- Jairam did.

498
00:44:41,522 --> 00:44:42,689
Jairam?

499
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:44,123
I didn't say anything,
she's lying..

500
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:45,587
You lied again.
I'll break your jaws.

501
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:47,816
- Never lie in front of me, understand?
- Mother.

502
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,189
Yes?

503
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,480
- Who are you?
- I..

504
00:44:56,814 --> 00:45:00,022
- I am Mrs. Joshi.
- Mrs. Joshi?

505
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,397
Mrs. Vinod Joshi.

506
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:06,647
Oh, so you are Mrs. Joshi.

507
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,647
Jairam, go downstairs with Lalita.

508
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,647
- No, I won't go.
- I say go.

509
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,189
- Okay, fine.
- And don't come back until I call you.

510
00:45:16,022 --> 00:45:18,564
Come on, move. Move.. move.

511
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:23,564
And listen, Jairam,
don't go to that hotel. Go.

512
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,814
Yes.

513
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,355
My husband.

514
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,230
Those were happy times.

515
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,689
Our life was like a dream.

516
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,564
But for how long?

517
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:48,730
His sisters had to be married.

518
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:51,939
He had to borrow money.

519
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:54,564
Happiness left.

520
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:58,397
Our Jairam also fell ill.

521
00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:04,230
Then the doctor's fees,
medicines. Money.

522
00:46:05,814 --> 00:46:09,605
All became a reason, for drinking.

523
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,980
But you.. What the
hell are you here for?

524
00:46:18,439 --> 00:46:20,814
- What?
- I..

525
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,855
- I..
- I know, it's reflecting on your face.

526
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:28,230
- Your guilt has dragged you here.
- No.. no.

527
00:46:28,314 --> 00:46:30,355
So, are you here to
laugh at our plight?

528
00:46:30,558 --> 00:46:33,189
See. See.. see.. see
with your own eyes.

529
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:35,772
My children don't go to school.

530
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:39,522
They wander around. They lie.

531
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:43,355
Look.. look at this house.
Look at me, look at my condition.

532
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,522
Neighbours consider us filth.

533
00:46:45,689 --> 00:46:48,189
But still, we are alive.

534
00:46:48,742 --> 00:46:51,272
Ask how. What do we eat?

535
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,022
That same Rs.100,000.

536
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:57,024
Isn't it apparent
when you look around?

537
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:59,355
Don't you see that Rs.100,000?

538
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:05,605
My poor husband,
he never lied in his life.

539
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:10,647
That Kale, his one and only friend.

540
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:14,814
His fingerprints were on
everything that Kale had.

541
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:18,230
But that so called friend..

542
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:21,897
Ruined my husband while dying.

543
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:27,105
And Mr. Joshi's 20 minutes
testimony.. Only 20 minutes?

544
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:31,772
That was an unfortunate day
for my husband.

545
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:34,022
He drank endlessly.

546
00:47:34,564 --> 00:47:36,439
Came home late and that's it.

547
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,147
We didn't even have
anyone to fall back on.

548
00:47:40,897 --> 00:47:43,064
Because we were simple people.

549
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,605
And Mr. Joshi?

550
00:47:46,147 --> 00:47:49,105
He saw him from the second floor.

551
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:51,230
And that, too, in the darkness,
right?

552
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:54,730
And now you've come to see
us in bright glowing light?

553
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:56,605
Open up.. open up the door.

554
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:59,522
The air we live in,
you couldn't even breathe in here.

555
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,480
Come on, open it.
This door always remains open.

556
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,064
The whole world knows
our condition. Open it.

557
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,522
And, Mrs. Joshi, go from here.

558
00:48:07,897 --> 00:48:10,480
Got to your husband, to your child.

559
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:12,439
I'll raise my children.

560
00:48:12,814 --> 00:48:16,189
They need their father,
who you people snatched away.

561
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:19,980
But still I'll raise them.
Ask me how. How?

562
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,947
Where will I bring
money for their upbringing?

563
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,873
How will I bring the money?
Want to know anything else?

564
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:26,480
Want to hear anything else?
Leave after your hearts satisfied.

565
00:48:26,564 --> 00:48:29,022
Ask.. ask more,
otherwise get lost from here.

566
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:30,397
Get out.

567
00:48:30,564 --> 00:48:32,730
Escape from this truth
to your dream world.

568
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:35,189
And all of you just
stand and watch the fun. Yes.

569
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:37,605
Does anyone know any better here?

570
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:51,897
'Mrs. Subramaniam.'

571
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,772
'What would I've done
in her position?'

572
00:48:58,022 --> 00:49:01,897
'Laxmi Building.'

573
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:04,605
'Matunga.'

574
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,564
Driver, ask somebody
the way to Donald House.

575
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,897
- Where's Donald House?
- Go ahead and take left turn.

576
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,439
It's in front of Electric House.

577
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:09,230
Enquire about
Mr. Man Singh's residence.

578
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:21,147
He lives on the first floor.

579
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,592
- What is it?
- Is Mr. Man Singh home?

580
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:15,634
Mother, someone's here.

581
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:21,676
Yes?

582
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:24,134
What is it?

583
00:51:25,676 --> 00:51:27,634
Does Mr. Man Singh live here?

584
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:29,342
Yes, Madam.

585
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:33,676
I want to meet him

586
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:35,426
Come in.

587
00:51:44,842 --> 00:51:47,676
Sit. Sit please.

588
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:51,134
- I'm fine.
- Sit here.

589
00:51:58,259 --> 00:51:59,967
I'll call him.

590
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:04,384
Man, somebody's here to see you.

591
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:10,051
Come.

592
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:14,301
Come in.

593
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:24,426
Please come.

594
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,967
You?

595
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:35,884
- I am Mrs. Joshi.
- Oh yes.. yes.

596
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:41,009
Come.. come. Forgive me,
but I can't even stand.

597
00:52:41,634 --> 00:52:46,467
Sit.. sit. Rosy, give her
a seat. You can sit here.

598
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:53,717
So many years have passed,
I didn't recognise you.

599
00:53:01,342 --> 00:53:03,467
Rosy, go inside,
send tea and snacks.

600
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:05,551
And don't come until I call you.

601
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:08,176
Oh, Man, I won't get in your way.

602
00:53:08,259 --> 00:53:11,387
- Rosy, I have to talk to her in private.
- Okay.

603
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:13,967
- Go and send tea.
- No.. no, I don't want tea.

604
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:15,801
I don't want anything.

605
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,426
Okay, all right.
Take away the radio.

606
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:44,759
You've changed a lot, Mrs. Joshi.

607
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:50,092
I remember,
I saw you during the case.

608
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:55,342
Even Vinod's not the
same old Vinod anymore.

609
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:57,217
Mr. Man Singh..

610
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:01,301
I am unable to
understand your letter.

611
00:54:04,426 --> 00:54:08,259
I was right.
You don't know anything about this.

612
00:54:08,467 --> 00:54:10,967
- About what?
- About the murder.

613
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,134
But I studied the whole case.

614
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:16,676
Studied?

615
00:54:17,551 --> 00:54:20,551
But I've heard and
even seen the whole case.

616
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:24,926
Mrs. Joshi, I even
remember Vinod's face.

617
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:29,176
In the witness box, nervous..

618
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:31,592
Scared.

619
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:34,634
I, too, was in the same condition.

620
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:37,217
I, too, had to suffer a lot.

621
00:54:37,828 --> 00:54:40,259
But Vinod saw Subramaniam.

622
00:54:40,967 --> 00:54:42,092
Really?

623
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:44,801
In the darkness of night?

624
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:47,301
From the second floor?

625
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:50,634
Yes, Vinod saw Subramaniam
and became wealthy.

626
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:53,551
I agree he fed me for a few days.

627
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:57,551
But when I fell sick,
he considered me dead.

628
00:54:57,801 --> 00:55:01,676
Mrs. Joshi, I've been dying
everyday for the past 8 years.

629
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:05,259
And Vinod, he didn't
even care for me.

630
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:07,551
A few days ago I went to meet him..

631
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:09,509
With so much difficulty,
Mrs. Joshi.

632
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:12,051
And he blatantly refused
even to meet me.

633
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:15,051
Now.. now I cannot endure anymore.

634
00:55:15,217 --> 00:55:16,801
But that murder..

635
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:21,592
I can never forget.

636
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:25,801
Mrs. Joshi, that murder
will never let me be at peace.

637
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:28,676
Vinod was prepared
for this in advance.

638
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:32,717
Mrs. Joshi, I cannot forget
that stream of blood..

639
00:55:33,217 --> 00:55:35,009
Painful scream.

640
00:55:35,384 --> 00:55:38,717
I have nightmares every night.

641
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:42,342
I, too, want to sleep peacefully.

642
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:46,384
I, too, need sleep.

643
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,676
What could be worse than this?

644
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:52,676
I'll have to go to jail.

645
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:57,801
- But now, I should go to police.
- No.. no, don't do this.

646
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:02,384
- Please.
- You're stopping me from doing this, Mrs. Joshi.

647
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:07,217
But that murder has been benefiting
you since last 10 years.

648
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:10,967
Have you ever thought
about Mrs. Subramaniam?

649
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,217
But Subramaniam's the murderer.

650
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:18,676
You sound so confident, Mrs. Joshi.

651
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:21,842
I saw that murder with my own eyes.

652
00:56:23,645 --> 00:56:27,301
Vinod and I, we both
needed money desperately.

653
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:31,884
We planned to steal from
accountant Kale's safe.

654
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:34,634
One day, we got the opportunity.

655
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:39,426
Subramaniam, Kale and
Vinod were doing overtime.

656
00:56:40,717 --> 00:56:42,842
The guard went out to bring tea.

657
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:47,051
Fortunately,
Subramaniam left office.

658
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:51,634
As Kale went to bathroom,
Vinod gave me the key..

659
00:56:52,403 --> 00:56:54,842
And asked me to
go to Kale's cabin.

660
00:56:55,213 --> 00:57:00,301
He picked up Subramaniam's paper
knife and guarded the door.

661
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,717
I was shivering with fear.

662
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:08,926
I asked Vinod not to..

663
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:11,384
Not to do anything stupid.

664
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:17,301
We were not finished,
and Kale came out of the bathroom.

665
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:20,592
And before he could
come to know anything..

666
00:57:20,676 --> 00:57:22,342
Vinod shoved the
knife into his throat.

667
00:57:22,426 --> 00:57:26,259
No, this is not possible.
Vinod's not like that.

668
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:31,717
Yes, he is. You don't know
how cunning your husband is.

669
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:33,926
He has a strong presence of mind.

670
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:36,884
He asked me to flee with the money.

671
00:57:37,176 --> 00:57:39,801
I came here somehow and hid myself.

672
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,884
I was very scared.

673
00:57:42,428 --> 00:57:44,717
I didn't even touch the money.

674
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:48,384
After a few days, Vinod came
and took away the money.

675
00:57:48,672 --> 00:57:49,926
He gave some to me as well.

676
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:54,801
I left my job and
started living at home.

677
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:58,301
I used to meet Vinod sometimes.

678
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:01,259
But ever since I fell sick..

679
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:04,672
He refused to help me.

680
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:08,551
I.. I didn't have so much courage..

681
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:11,342
That I could say
anything against Vinod.

682
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:15,134
He's very sharp.
He can do anything.

683
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:20,009
And I also feared,
that I would be jailed.

684
00:58:21,726 --> 00:58:24,176
Now..

685
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:27,092
Now I'm shattered.

686
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:31,467
Now, I don't care
about anyone, Mrs. Joshi.

687
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,092
I don't care about anyone.

688
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:38,009
I want to sleep in peace.

689
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:41,759
I haven't slept in
10 years, Mrs. Joshi.

690
00:58:43,088 --> 00:58:46,051
Murder.. scream..

691
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:49,759
Every night.

692
00:58:51,009 --> 00:58:53,676
Please don't go to the police.

693
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:58,384
I beg of you.
Give us some more time.

694
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,036
Please.

695
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,592
I don't understand what to do.

696
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:07,509
All right. I won't go.

697
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:13,801
But it hurts so much.
I cannot walk.

698
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:17,426
Please, Mrs. Joshi,
help me a little.

699
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,634
Give some money for
going to the doctor.

700
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:22,634
It'll be very kind of you. Please.

701
00:59:56,853 --> 01:00:00,192
- Driver, Mr. Banerjee's place.
- Okay.

702
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,261
"Don't drop down the
curtain now, wait."

703
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:22,321
"There are many
more stories ahead."

704
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:25,714
Hello, Meena my child, come, come.

705
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:29,714
I recorded it yesterday.
Listen to my new song.

706
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:35,672
"Just now the raw soil
has turned fertile.."

707
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:39,573
"And just now,
water has soaked it."

708
01:00:39,653 --> 01:00:41,756
Wow.. wow, what a song.

709
01:00:42,547 --> 01:00:49,922
"Now, I'm feeling sleepy,
wait.. wait.. wait."

710
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:51,464
Wow.. wow.. wow.

711
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:59,881
"Don't drop down the
curtain now, wait."

712
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:04,471
"There are many
more stories ahead."

713
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:11,964
"Don't drop down the
curtain now, wait."

714
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:19,881
"Now, the sorrows of
heart keep fuming."

715
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:30,464
What a note, the way the emotion
of fuming has been mentioned.

716
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:37,047
"Now, the sorrows of
soul keep fuming."

717
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:42,631
"Now, the grief of
an aching heart surfaces."

718
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,710
Oh, the way I've expressed
the feeling of surfacing.

719
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,506
Wow.. wow, what melody.

720
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:55,736
"Now, the sorrows of
soul keep fuming."

721
01:01:55,816 --> 01:02:00,417
"Now, the grief of an
aching heart surfaces."

722
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:08,590
"Now, the feelings are alive.
Now, the feelings are alive."

723
01:02:09,715 --> 01:02:14,047
- "Wait.. wait.. wait."
- Wow.. wow, what a song.

724
01:02:15,172 --> 01:02:20,089
- "Don't drop down the curtain now, wait."
- Perhaps, child..

725
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:21,953
Perhaps, I should've been a singer.

726
01:02:22,033 --> 01:02:24,131
How is it? All right?

727
01:02:24,339 --> 01:02:28,881
- "Lot more.."
- You've turned me deaf..

728
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:31,023
By making me hear it constantly.
At least spare poor Meena.

729
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,672
- When did you come, my dear?
- Just now.

730
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:34,506
And you forgot to go out.

731
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:37,797
Look, how your aunt dominates.

732
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:40,506
You've come after so
many days, my dear.

733
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:42,862
- Tell me, what will you drink?
- No, nothing.

734
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:44,922
- You'll have to take something.
- No, really.

735
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:48,006
- Is it? Okay, how is Mitthu?
- All right.

736
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:49,839
And when is Vinod
returning from Delhi?

737
01:02:50,006 --> 01:02:53,714
- Within a couple of days.
- Yes, he has a very sharp mind.

738
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:57,464
What am I? He used to guide me.

739
01:02:57,756 --> 01:03:02,839
I got three clients like that,
like Vinod. He became rich.

740
01:03:02,922 --> 01:03:05,506
And made us rich as well.

741
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:11,547
- Uncle, you've known him for 10-12 years, right?
- 10 years?

742
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:18,131
Vinod came to us..
In 19.. in 1963, right?

743
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:21,964
'Oh, my God. In 1963?'
- Yes, in 1963.

744
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,297
After a couple of
days of Lopu's wedding.

745
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:26,922
He had so much faith in me.

746
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:28,922
I still remember.

747
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:34,339
It was the month of March in 1963.
It was summer.

748
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:39,006
Vinod came to our office.
He was drenched in sweat.

749
01:03:39,672 --> 01:03:43,839
He said, "Mr. Banerjee,
take this Rs.50,000."

750
01:03:44,214 --> 01:03:48,631
"Rs.50,000 cash. Make me rich."

751
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:51,964
After all, I am a stockbroker.

752
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:55,672
Take money from him,
invest here, and make it grow.

753
01:03:55,922 --> 01:03:58,881
Then withdraw it, invest elsewhere,
and watch it grow.

754
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:02,797
I made him rich. I made him rich.

755
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,422
Where did Vinod
get that money from?

756
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:10,089
Which money?

757
01:04:10,756 --> 01:04:12,839
Rs.50,000?

758
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:14,797
I don't know about it.

759
01:04:15,054 --> 01:04:18,172
He never told me.
I never asked him.

760
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:23,922
He came and kept Rs.50,000 cash
on my table. Cash.

761
01:04:25,256 --> 01:04:26,756
What is the matter, dear?

762
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,528
- Nothing.
- My dear, would you like to listen to another song?

763
01:04:29,552 --> 01:04:34,464
- Forget it.
- Three minutes for the song, two minutes for the Uncle.

764
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:37,498
Dear, you haven't had anything.
I'll come right away.

765
01:04:37,692 --> 01:04:41,047
No, not today.
I'm in a hurry. Bye. Bye.

766
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:43,047
God bless you, dear.

767
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,756
We should've gone to
receive Father, right?

768
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:50,006
How can we, Mitthu?

769
01:04:50,256 --> 01:04:51,756
His secretary had called.

770
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,922
He told us that few people
are coming from Delhi.

771
01:04:54,297 --> 01:04:56,922
- So, he'll go to office straightaway.
- So what?

772
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:00,839
He doesn't like it.

773
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:07,172
- Mitthu, phone.
- Mother, you please.

774
01:05:17,131 --> 01:05:18,964
374832.

775
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:28,214
He's been waiting for you.

776
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:31,297
Everything's fine.

777
01:05:32,756 --> 01:05:36,256
This afternoon?
He'll jump with joy.

778
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:42,464
Vinod, please. Afterwards.

779
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:45,822
Bye.

780
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:51,464
- Father called, right?
- Yes.

781
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,922
What did he say?

782
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:55,006
He's asked you to get ready.

783
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:57,797
- You're going fishing in the afternoon.
- Oh, boy.

784
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:19,589
- Father. Father. Over there.
- Quiet, Mitthu.

785
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,756
There, you scared it away.

786
01:06:23,214 --> 01:06:25,881
Mitthu, the first rule of
fishing is to stay quiet.

787
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:29,381
Second is to wait until
the fish is caught.

788
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:32,047
And pull it when it wants to
run away. Do you understand?

789
01:06:32,214 --> 01:06:34,464
- Yes, Father, sorry.
- It's okay.

790
01:06:35,256 --> 01:06:36,589
Now, keep quiet.

791
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:45,631
- Father. I got one. I got one.
- Oh, lovely.

792
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:49,297
Give me, Mitthu. Give it to me,
Mitthu. Come on, give me.

793
01:06:52,672 --> 01:06:54,272
It should not be made
to suffer too much.

794
01:06:54,297 --> 01:06:55,607
You should kill it by
hitting it on a stone.

795
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:57,381
Father, give it to me, please.

796
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:01,714
Mitthu, not with so
much force. Gently.

797
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:04,089
You should know how
much and where to hit.

798
01:07:12,589 --> 01:07:15,297
Mother, look, my first fish.

799
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:31,506
Meena, what next?

800
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:39,089
I don't understand anything.

801
01:07:39,293 --> 01:07:41,547
Me neither. Meena, we..

802
01:07:45,172 --> 01:07:47,506
Meena, we've been
together for long.

803
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:49,297
We've loved each other.

804
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:52,047
But our life changed
in a single day.

805
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:56,881
I thought it was a dream.
But I was wrong.

806
01:07:57,714 --> 01:08:00,339
Uncle had called.
You had gone to his home.

807
01:08:00,422 --> 01:08:03,172
You asked him where I had
got that much of money from.

808
01:08:03,256 --> 01:08:06,297
I couldn't help it.
I needed to know.

809
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:09,381
Vinod, where did you get so
much money from after the case?

810
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:12,297
Meena, there's a limit
to everything.

811
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:13,922
Until now, the matter
was between us..

812
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,714
But now you've dragged
others in it.

813
01:08:15,797 --> 01:08:17,589
You think that I'm a murderer.

814
01:08:18,881 --> 01:08:21,131
That's it.

815
01:08:22,046 --> 01:08:25,380
Everything's over.
Now, there's nothing between us.

816
01:08:26,546 --> 01:08:29,963
That Man Singh.
I'll deal with him.

817
01:08:30,046 --> 01:08:33,046
No, Vinod. You won't go to him.

818
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:35,506
Promise me. For my sake.

819
01:08:36,256 --> 01:08:38,797
Why? Would I murder him, too?

820
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:44,671
What are you doing?

821
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:49,089
Now, I have no
reason to sleep here.

822
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:51,297
I'll go and sleep with Mitthu.

823
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:54,214
It'll make me feel better..

824
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,631
- And you'll be spared from sleeping with a murderer.
- Vinod.

825
01:08:57,796 --> 01:09:01,880
Yes, Meena. When I look
at your face, you turn it away.

826
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:04,755
When I look into your eyes,
you look the other way.

827
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:08,214
If I touch you,
you feel very distant.

828
01:09:09,452 --> 01:09:13,172
Instead of such intimacy,
it's better if we keep away.

829
01:09:14,714 --> 01:09:15,881
Goodnight.

830
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:28,213
- Hi, Mitthu, you're still reading?
- Father, please let me read.

831
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:30,255
- Today, I'll sleep with you.
- Really?

832
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:32,276
Yes, only two days are left
before the school starts.

833
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,839
And I've not spent much time
with you during the holiday.

834
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,338
- Good idea?
- Great, Dad.

835
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:37,880
Oh, lovely.

836
01:09:39,131 --> 01:09:40,839
But would Mother sleep alone?

837
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:42,421
She sleeps many times, doesn't she?

838
01:09:42,506 --> 01:09:44,672
- Oh, I must tell Mother.
- No, Mitthu.

839
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:46,881
Mitthu, come back here.

840
01:09:46,964 --> 01:09:49,631
Mother, Father is sleeping with me.

841
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:05,006
Don't forget. Today, we have to take
Mr. and Mrs. Choudhury for dinner.

842
01:10:11,589 --> 01:10:14,672
- Is the driver needed?
- No.

843
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:18,381
He's been provided with
a car from the office.

844
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,672
We'll travel by it.

845
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:24,631
Father, please don't go.
I'm going back tomorrow.

846
01:10:25,214 --> 01:10:28,131
I'm helpless, dear. But I promise,
we'll come back early.

847
01:10:28,214 --> 01:10:29,339
- Okay?
- Okay.

848
01:10:29,422 --> 01:10:32,464
- Bahadur.
- He went downstairs with the coat and bag.

849
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:34,464
- Bye, Mitthu.
- Bye.

850
01:10:37,746 --> 01:10:41,714
Mother, you've not prepared
my chocolate cake.

851
01:10:42,797 --> 01:10:45,881
I haven't forgotten, Mitthu.
I'll prepare it today.

852
01:10:54,938 --> 01:10:56,646
Madam, someone's here to meet you.

853
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:58,604
- Who is he?
- Mr. Man Singh.

854
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:04,688
- Seat him downstairs.
- He has come upstairs.

855
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:06,854
He is talking with
Mitthu in the balcony.

856
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:09,188
- You may go, I'll be there.
- Yes, Madam.

857
01:11:12,474 --> 01:11:15,438
- In which school do you study?
- I study in Dehradun.

858
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,854
Really? You stay so far away?
You are brave.

859
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:21,229
Was it your Dad
who hunted that tiger?

860
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:23,229
No, Uncle Desai hunted it down.

861
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:26,104
- Your father cannot hunt a tiger?
- He certainly can.

862
01:11:26,388 --> 01:11:28,896
- Hello.
- Tell me.

863
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:32,771
You're a very kind person,
Mrs. Joshi.

864
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:36,214
I've come to meet you
despite being so weak.

865
01:11:36,294 --> 01:11:38,438
How can you say that
my father cannot hunt a tiger?

866
01:11:39,104 --> 01:11:42,479
No, dear. I made a mistake.
He certainly can.

867
01:11:43,271 --> 01:11:44,562
Why just a tiger,
he can kill anybody.

868
01:11:44,586 --> 01:11:46,563
- Mitthu, go inside.
- Okay.

869
01:11:48,128 --> 01:11:49,563
He's a good boy.

870
01:11:50,729 --> 01:11:52,604
Mr. Man Singh, why are you here?

871
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:55,021
What if my husband finds out?

872
01:11:55,285 --> 01:11:57,146
Don't worry, Mrs. Joshi.

873
01:11:57,382 --> 01:12:02,104
I've come after finding out that
he's in office at this moment.

874
01:12:02,755 --> 01:12:06,938
I know, that he hates me a lot.

875
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:13,313
I'm here to tell you that
I didn't go to the police.

876
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:18,688
After meeting you I thought..

877
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:25,313
That it would not be my regret..

878
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:29,313
But a big crime to take advantage
of the unmentionable past.

879
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:33,563
I saw your son, too.

880
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:36,604
He's a lovely boy.

881
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,188
Now, I'll never be
able to go to the police.

882
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:42,646
- Thank you.
- Why do you need to thank me?

883
01:12:46,388 --> 01:12:49,021
You must be busy. I'll leave.

884
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:54,354
There's just one thing. That
day you visited me as an angel.

885
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:57,771
You gave me money.
I began my treatment.

886
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:00,063
Now, I feel quite better.

887
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:02,389
But the doctor said..

888
01:13:02,469 --> 01:13:04,909
That the treatment should be
continued for two more months.

889
01:13:05,038 --> 01:13:08,979
If you could help me little more,
I'd be grateful.

890
01:13:09,563 --> 01:13:12,396
I'll see. Please sit inside.

891
01:13:20,377 --> 01:13:22,063
Anything else, please.

892
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:26,960
- Sweet dish for you?
- No, she won't have it. She is on diet.

893
01:13:27,933 --> 01:13:29,771
Why do you need to diet?

894
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:33,438
- I've to be careful, you know with my..
- I'll have coffee.

895
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:34,813
Okay.

896
01:13:35,188 --> 01:13:37,646
- What will you have? Ice-cream?
- No, thanks.

897
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:40,729
I must have coffee after dinner.

898
01:13:40,992 --> 01:13:43,771
- Please you, too, have coffee.
- No, thanks. I won't have anything.

899
01:13:44,808 --> 01:13:46,146
- Bring three coffees.
- Yes, sir.

900
01:13:46,313 --> 01:13:48,063
The dinner was very good,
Mr. Joshi.

901
01:13:48,146 --> 01:13:49,835
The food here is always good.

902
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:52,354
Joshi's choice is always good.

903
01:13:52,438 --> 01:13:54,122
- Thank you.
- Ladies and gentlemen, attention please.

904
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:55,746
- The show of the evening..
- Oh, lovely.

905
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:57,383
- Cabaret will begin now.
- For your pleasure.

906
01:13:57,407 --> 01:14:01,749
Presenting lovely,
luscious, Rosita.

907
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,771
"Where have I reached?"

908
01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:26,021
"Only animals are here."

909
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:45,646
"Elephant, tiger and
there's a monkey. too."

910
01:15:16,777 --> 01:15:20,521
"Oh, is that a full
moon on the dark night?"

911
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:24,688
"What shine, what dazzle."

912
01:15:32,906 --> 01:15:35,396
"Oh, what's this? Soda bottle?"

913
01:15:35,815 --> 01:15:38,438
"Now tell me, how do I look?"

914
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,604
"Little or big?"

915
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:43,146
"Away or near?"

916
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:45,896
"No, no."

917
01:15:54,378 --> 01:15:58,354
"Oh, God. Is this
moustache or a sword?"

918
01:16:00,453 --> 01:16:02,146
"No, I don't want it."

919
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:17,313
"Hey, kid, how have you come
alone without your Mother?"

920
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,146
"Dear kid."

921
01:16:21,274 --> 01:16:22,813
"Lovely kid."

922
01:16:22,993 --> 01:16:27,396
"Would you like to grow up?
Come on, close your eyes."

923
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:32,521
"Yes, like that. Okay? Ready?"

924
01:16:36,107 --> 01:16:37,274
"Go."

925
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:18,376
- Superb cabaret.
- I'm glad you liked it.

926
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:20,126
Joshi, I enjoyed it.

927
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,584
This is nothing.
She is a very old one.

928
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:25,792
- Really?
- The new girls do a lot more.

929
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:29,501
- Really? Oh, my. Just imagine. I must see it.
- Excuse me, Madam.

930
01:18:29,752 --> 01:18:31,626
- Mrs. Joshi.
- What is it?

931
01:18:32,338 --> 01:18:35,126
- Rosita's calling you inside for a minute.
- Why?

932
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:38,167
- Rosita?
- Rosy, the cabaret dancer?

933
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:41,792
I do not know any Rosita.

934
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:45,292
She has made a request.
Please come for a minute.

935
01:18:45,709 --> 01:18:49,751
- Yes, please go. We'll have coffee till then.
- Yes, go.

936
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:52,167
I'll be back soon.

937
01:18:56,155 --> 01:18:58,667
Joshi, did you check the
design that was shipped?

938
01:18:59,173 --> 01:19:03,792
Yes, the Yugoslavian
is as per our plan..

939
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:08,751
I don't know how to tell you this.

940
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:13,917
What you'd think about me.

941
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:18,292
But it's very important.

942
01:19:21,002 --> 01:19:24,001
That day you gave money
to Man Singh, right?

943
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:26,209
Yes.

944
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,709
- You paid him again today?
- Yes.

945
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,501
Mrs. Joshi..

946
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:37,542
I don't know
why you are doing this.

947
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,167
Don't give him money again. Please.

948
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:48,417
But he's sick. Doctor's fee..
The money for medicine..

949
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:51,042
Mrs. Joshi..

950
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:54,376
Perhaps you think..

951
01:19:55,355 --> 01:19:59,459
Whatever I'm doing is for myself.

952
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:04,834
Man Singh has been with me
for years, not just today.

953
01:20:05,517 --> 01:20:06,959
He left his job.

954
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,834
I didn't complain.

955
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:18,084
He fell sick.
I didn't lose my courage.

956
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:22,251
Perhaps..

957
01:20:24,405 --> 01:20:30,292
I'll lose something
due to your benevolence.

958
01:20:30,546 --> 01:20:33,126
- That day after meeting you..
- Excuse me.

959
01:20:33,209 --> 01:20:35,417
They must be waiting for me.

960
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:39,542
Oh, yes. I know.

961
01:20:40,626 --> 01:20:45,542
But before you go,
please listen to this..

962
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:48,959
Man Singh is my life.

963
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:55,667
Don't worry about doctor's fee
and medicines. I'll handle it.

964
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:03,751
I'm not asking what
relationship you have with him.

965
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:07,126
I don't want to know either.

966
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:10,584
I just want to live in peace.

967
01:21:14,623 --> 01:21:18,290
- Mitthu, you're still awake?
- Father, I was waiting for you.

968
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:21,873
What's all this? I told you many
times not to read under this light.

969
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:23,623
You'll ruin your eyes.

970
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:25,666
Then you'll have to wear
glasses like your father.

971
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:27,149
Did you eat well?

972
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:31,356
Yes, Mother. Father, they showed
a test match on TV today.

973
01:21:31,436 --> 01:21:34,790
- Did you watch Greg?
- Yes, he is taller than you.

974
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,206
Really? What more did you see?

975
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:39,415
After that,
there was a horrible man.

976
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,748
Like the horrible man
who came today morning.

977
01:21:42,888 --> 01:21:45,623
- Who had come?
- Man Singh. - Man Singh..

978
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:51,206
- What did he say?
- He said you cannot kill a tiger.

979
01:21:53,002 --> 01:21:55,936
- Go to sleep now. Come on.
- Father, piggy ride.

980
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:57,456
Darling, look at the time.

981
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,215
But I'm going back
to school tomorrow.

982
01:21:59,295 --> 01:22:01,123
Father, please just once.

983
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,873
I had forgotten. Come on.

984
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:14,262
Meena.

985
01:22:15,215 --> 01:22:16,548
What's going on?

986
01:22:16,756 --> 01:22:19,090
Man Singh came here.
What did he want?

987
01:22:19,173 --> 01:22:21,631
Who is Rosy? How do you know her?

988
01:22:22,465 --> 01:22:25,006
Why don't you say anything?

989
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:26,673
And what's this?

990
01:22:30,798 --> 01:22:34,006
'I don't want your alms.
Mrs. Subramaniam.'

991
01:22:34,173 --> 01:22:35,465
And this Rs.500.

992
01:22:35,756 --> 01:22:37,923
It was mailed to my office
to be handed over to you.

993
01:22:38,215 --> 01:22:39,815
What's going on, Meena?
Explain it to me.

994
01:22:39,881 --> 01:22:42,090
I want an explanation.

995
01:22:42,298 --> 01:22:43,798
I had gone to her home.

996
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:46,340
What? You had gone to her home?

997
01:22:46,756 --> 01:22:48,156
Where did you get the address from?

998
01:22:48,215 --> 01:22:49,881
From the newspaper archives.

999
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,548
And Man Singh?

1000
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:53,631
I had gone to his home, too.

1001
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:55,965
No, Meena, no. What did he say?

1002
01:22:56,048 --> 01:22:57,965
He told me everything.

1003
01:22:58,423 --> 01:23:00,965
Vinod, what have you done? Why?

1004
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,798
Why?

1005
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:12,590
To purchase the Alibaug house.

1006
01:23:14,506 --> 01:23:16,465
To send Mitthu to the boarding.

1007
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:19,298
For this house.

1008
01:23:20,298 --> 01:23:21,590
For the car.

1009
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:24,381
For all the pleasures.

1010
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:27,798
That's all.

1011
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:31,090
Are you happy now?

1012
01:23:35,715 --> 01:23:37,506
You're not my Meena.

1013
01:23:39,756 --> 01:23:41,840
I had hopes till yesterday.

1014
01:23:42,965 --> 01:23:47,006
But today you've
gone very far from me.

1015
01:23:50,798 --> 01:23:54,006
- I cannot tolerate this.
- I cannot tolerate this either.

1016
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,506
You cannot tolerate it.

1017
01:23:59,006 --> 01:24:00,631
I cannot tolerate it.

1018
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:04,298
Then why doesn't this matter end?

1019
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,090
What have you thought?

1020
01:24:09,006 --> 01:24:10,215
Tell me..

1021
01:24:11,132 --> 01:24:12,631
What do you want to do?

1022
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:14,881
I don't know.

1023
01:24:15,631 --> 01:24:17,256
You don't know?

1024
01:24:18,715 --> 01:24:19,965
Strange.

1025
01:24:20,465 --> 01:24:22,423
You knew about whatever
you've done until now.

1026
01:24:22,798 --> 01:24:26,048
- Please, Vinod, it hurts.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1027
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:29,006
It hurts you. What about me?

1028
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:32,256
But keep one thing in mind..

1029
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:35,215
Mitthu should not
find out about this.

1030
01:24:36,063 --> 01:24:39,298
Until his stay till tomorrow,
even if it's a pretence..

1031
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:44,256
You must act like me Meena.
Do you understand?

1032
01:24:45,328 --> 01:24:46,869
Yes, Father. Father, bye.

1033
01:24:49,978 --> 01:24:52,613
- Mitthu, write a letter as soon as you reach there.
- Okay, Mother.

1034
01:24:52,637 --> 01:24:55,119
- Bye, Mitthu. Cricket team.
- Of course.

1035
01:24:55,203 --> 01:24:56,661
Go carefully.

1036
01:25:17,676 --> 01:25:20,619
You go now.
Don't wait for me for dinner.

1037
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:22,952
What about you?
Where are you going?

1038
01:25:23,487 --> 01:25:25,778
Meena, I don't see the
need to tell you about it.

1039
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:28,820
The things you did so far,
did you ever ask for my permission?

1040
01:25:28,987 --> 01:25:30,237
Did you inform me?

1041
01:25:30,653 --> 01:25:33,153
- Now, give me the key.
- Vinod, please.

1042
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:35,070
Meena, don't harass me anymore.

1043
01:25:35,153 --> 01:25:38,195
From today our ways are different.
Give me the key.

1044
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:41,820
Vinod, please don't do this.
Let's go home.

1045
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,945
Come on, Meena, give me the key.

1046
01:25:44,737 --> 01:25:45,862
Hurry up.

1047
01:25:46,612 --> 01:25:47,862
Driver, go.

1048
01:25:55,362 --> 01:25:58,778
Man is doing all this?
I can't believe it.

1049
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,403
I don't understand..

1050
01:26:02,153 --> 01:26:04,945
Why he is doing all this.

1051
01:26:05,612 --> 01:26:07,070
It's disgusting.

1052
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:10,362
Look, my family's
everything for me.

1053
01:26:10,778 --> 01:26:14,403
I can tolerate anything,
but I cannot see my family ruined.

1054
01:26:15,362 --> 01:26:19,112
Please don't say so,
Mr. Joshi, I promise you.

1055
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:21,320
This won't be repeated ever again.

1056
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:25,070
I didn't know that
he is up to such things.

1057
01:26:25,862 --> 01:26:27,945
It's such a terrible thing to do.

1058
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,820
Man, what's this that I'm hearing?

1059
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:42,980
What?

1060
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,570
Oh, so you were telling her?

1061
01:26:47,112 --> 01:26:48,820
What did I do?
I haven't done anything.

1062
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:50,778
Don't you know what you've done?

1063
01:26:50,987 --> 01:26:53,570
Man, how could you do such a thing?

1064
01:26:54,217 --> 01:26:57,237
What have I done?
I haven't done anything.

1065
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:59,487
What ploy are you
both planning together?

1066
01:26:59,695 --> 01:27:02,445
- You blackmailer. Don't you feel ashamed?
- Oh, God.

1067
01:27:02,945 --> 01:27:07,403
- If you ever do this again, it'll be the worst for you.
- Mr. Joshi..

1068
01:27:07,487 --> 01:27:10,987
Please let him go. I assure
you that he won't do this again.

1069
01:27:13,017 --> 01:27:17,278
Tell him to come with me and
tell the truth to my wife..

1070
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:20,778
And end this sham.
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

1071
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:23,945
Please, Man, go with him.
Man, please.

1072
01:27:24,112 --> 01:27:27,237
Mr. Vinod, what's the use
threatening a poor fellow like me?

1073
01:27:28,195 --> 01:27:31,070
Go and show your
manliness to your wife.

1074
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:32,903
Go and look into her eyes.

1075
01:27:32,987 --> 01:27:36,362
Will she consider you
innocent if I tell her so? Go.

1076
01:27:36,737 --> 01:27:39,528
What's the use of
shouting at me, Mr. Vinod?

1077
01:27:39,737 --> 01:27:43,320
- If you can't handle your wife, why are you showing off here?
- Man.

1078
01:27:43,567 --> 01:27:45,070
You, son of..

1079
01:27:49,362 --> 01:27:50,862
I'll deal with you..

1080
01:27:51,987 --> 01:27:53,487
Man.. Man..

1081
01:27:54,737 --> 01:27:56,153
Stop it.

1082
01:27:56,362 --> 01:27:58,362
- I'll show you my manliness.
- Leave me.

1083
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:02,278
- No one can save you today.
- Move away, Man.

1084
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,237
Stop it, Man. What is happening?

1085
01:28:06,317 --> 01:28:07,980
Move aside.

1086
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:12,070
I won't spare you today.
I won't spare you today.

1087
01:28:12,347 --> 01:28:14,695
- Please don't..
- Leave me.

1088
01:28:14,778 --> 01:28:18,653
He'll do everything
you ask him to. He will.

1089
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:20,403
Please don't kill me.

1090
01:28:20,653 --> 01:28:23,070
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

1091
01:28:29,403 --> 01:28:31,987
- Man..
- Drunkard. Murderer.

1092
01:28:32,237 --> 01:28:34,362
What do you think?
You can scare me?

1093
01:28:34,445 --> 01:28:38,237
I was dead for 10 years.
Now, I'm a different man.

1094
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:40,570
Why just you,
nobody can do anything to me.

1095
01:28:40,653 --> 01:28:42,358
- Get lost. - Man Singh.
- Go home and tell your wife..

1096
01:28:42,382 --> 01:28:44,256
- How you committed the murder.
- What's wrong with you?

1097
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,336
- Go and tell her.
- What nonsense are you talking about?

1098
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:49,403
- Man.
- Something's wrong with him. This man's crazy.

1099
01:28:51,945 --> 01:28:54,362
- Let go of me. Move aside.
- No. Stop it. Stop it.

1100
01:28:56,368 --> 01:28:59,528
- Mr. Joshi.
- If you care for your life, then throw away the knife.

1101
01:28:59,612 --> 01:29:02,945
- Man. Throw it away. Please.
- You can't do this.

1102
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:07,028
- Throw it away.
- You get out of my home.

1103
01:29:07,237 --> 01:29:09,945
- Why are you running inside?
- Mr. Joshi, please don't..

1104
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:11,463
You move aside,
I'll not let him go alive.

1105
01:29:11,487 --> 01:29:13,112
- Come inside.
- Come out.

1106
01:29:13,195 --> 01:29:15,235
- Would you dare come inside? Come on.
- Move aside.

1107
01:29:38,862 --> 01:29:42,862
Sorry, I lost my key.

1108
01:29:47,195 --> 01:29:50,487
It's very late, isn't it?

1109
01:29:51,778 --> 01:29:54,653
Mitthu must be waiting for me.

1110
01:29:55,612 --> 01:29:59,903
I'll go and sleep next to him.

1111
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:04,653
Sorry, please go to sleep.

1112
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:10,112
Vinod.

1113
01:30:28,227 --> 01:30:29,394
Vinod.

1114
01:30:30,686 --> 01:30:31,852
Vinod.

1115
01:30:33,477 --> 01:30:35,686
Please go away from here, Meena.

1116
01:30:35,977 --> 01:30:39,686
- What has happened to you?
- Don't touch a murderer.

1117
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:43,352
- Please listen to me.
- Now, nothing is left to be heard.

1118
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:46,811
- Vinod, please.
- Please. It's all over.

1119
01:30:48,561 --> 01:30:50,436
Leave me alone.

1120
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:53,561
Go away.

1121
01:30:54,936 --> 01:30:56,561
Switch off the lights.

1122
01:32:17,727 --> 01:32:20,519
'You don't find your
destination by just walking.'

1123
01:32:21,061 --> 01:32:23,102
'To stop is a
destination in itself.'

1124
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:25,769
'Yes, I'll stop.'

1125
01:32:27,269 --> 01:32:30,352
'But Vinod won't be able
to bear it ever.'

1126
01:32:31,686 --> 01:32:37,269
'He shouldn't even feel it
that I've committed suicide.'

1127
01:32:37,977 --> 01:32:39,727
'But how?'

1128
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:49,102
'I'll have to say goodbye to
Vinod without raising suspicion.'

1129
01:32:56,477 --> 01:33:00,269
No, Vinod, now don't
be so distant from me.

1130
01:33:02,018 --> 01:33:05,768
It was madness, it has ended.

1131
01:33:07,185 --> 01:33:09,060
Please forgive me.

1132
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:12,310
Am I dreaming?

1133
01:33:14,954 --> 01:33:19,310
This is the problem.
You never dream..

1134
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:23,393
And I'm always lost in one.

1135
01:33:25,018 --> 01:33:28,810
Vinod, I'm nothing without you.

1136
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,768
Meena.

1137
01:33:34,768 --> 01:33:36,935
I've been through so much.

1138
01:33:38,055 --> 01:33:40,143
I was lost in darkness, Meena.

1139
01:33:42,098 --> 01:33:44,685
Loneliness was hurting me.

1140
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:47,768
Everything seemed so empty.

1141
01:33:49,093 --> 01:33:53,643
Perhaps, because
you were not with me.

1142
01:33:55,428 --> 01:33:57,768
Everything's over now.

1143
01:33:59,101 --> 01:34:01,226
Forget the past.

1144
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,851
Let's go to Alibaug.

1145
01:34:07,518 --> 01:34:09,476
- Are you saying this?
- Yes.

1146
01:34:10,393 --> 01:34:11,851
What about the office?

1147
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:14,060
Just for a couple of days.

1148
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:17,518
You and me. Just the two of us.

1149
01:34:19,101 --> 01:34:20,435
Okay.

1150
01:34:22,393 --> 01:34:23,810
Meena.

1151
01:34:43,507 --> 01:34:48,091
"The heart is one,
life is one, my darling."

1152
01:34:48,257 --> 01:34:52,382
"My life is there where you are."

1153
01:34:52,507 --> 01:34:54,841
"Yes, my life."

1154
01:34:55,235 --> 01:34:57,674
"Where? Where?."

1155
01:34:57,884 --> 01:35:02,341
"Leave your footprint
on the this ground."

1156
01:35:02,565 --> 01:35:06,299
"The sky will bow
and kiss that ground."

1157
01:35:06,382 --> 01:35:09,257
"Your footprint."

1158
01:35:14,403 --> 01:35:17,174
"Where are those prints?"

1159
01:35:19,073 --> 01:35:23,679
"The flaring sunlight is
walking under the shadows."

1160
01:35:26,014 --> 01:35:28,174
- "Flaring?
- Yes, flaring."

1161
01:35:28,609 --> 01:35:32,841
"The flaring sunlight is
walking under the shadows.."

1162
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:37,591
"in search of your footprints."

1163
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:40,230
"Tell me, where
the footprints are.."

1164
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:42,559
- Listen, I'm going to the garage for a while.
- Now?

1165
01:35:42,792 --> 01:35:44,382
Yes, I'll be back in 10 minutes.

1166
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,632
- All right. I'm going to the beach.
- Okay, come soon.

1167
01:35:47,873 --> 01:35:51,049
- Vinod, is the player on?
- Yes, I know. Let it play.

1168
01:35:58,257 --> 01:36:03,216
"The rain is kissing thirsty lips."

1169
01:36:03,506 --> 01:36:08,341
"The rain is kissing thirsty lips."

1170
01:36:08,633 --> 01:36:14,168
"Today, monsoon will
dance in the eyes."

1171
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:21,823
"Today, monsoon will
dance in the eyes."

1172
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:28,601
"There is smoke everywhere."

1173
01:36:28,681 --> 01:36:30,025
This is the right time.

1174
01:36:31,846 --> 01:36:34,054
I should end it right here and now.

1175
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:36,804
If I go back,
I'll entangle myself again.

1176
01:37:24,596 --> 01:37:27,138
Vinod will take care of Mitthu.

1177
01:37:28,096 --> 01:37:32,013
It won't be difficult if
I can find the courage.

1178
01:37:41,628 --> 01:37:42,644
Meena!

1179
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:53,173
Meena?

1180
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:56,382
What have you done?

1181
01:38:59,596 --> 01:39:01,132
Oh, thank God!

1182
01:39:02,656 --> 01:39:06,715
You stupid fool!

1183
01:39:19,306 --> 01:39:27,306
"The mind should fly on
the wings of the eyes."

1184
01:39:31,014 --> 01:39:36,690
"Letting go of the hand."

1185
01:39:37,123 --> 01:39:43,977
"He is going away."

1186
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:47,302
Meena!

1187
01:39:48,177 --> 01:39:49,552
Meena?

1188
01:40:01,924 --> 01:40:06,076
"God knows.."

1189
01:40:06,888 --> 01:40:10,555
Meena, you tried to commit suicide?

1190
01:40:11,471 --> 01:40:12,846
Why Meena? Why?

1191
01:40:13,346 --> 01:40:15,055
Why were you doing so?

1192
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,805
Meena?

1193
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,013
Meena, open your eyes.

1194
01:40:23,388 --> 01:40:26,680
Look, I'm near you. Your Vinod!

1195
01:40:26,984 --> 01:40:29,013
Look at me. Please!

1196
01:40:29,805 --> 01:40:31,763
You were leaving me alone.

1197
01:40:32,411 --> 01:40:34,430
- You were leaving me.
- You..

1198
01:40:36,098 --> 01:40:38,013
- Are you crying, Vinod?
- No.

1199
01:40:38,951 --> 01:40:40,596
Please don't cry.

1200
01:40:40,984 --> 01:40:43,096
Vinod, don't cry.

1201
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:47,930
I can't see you like this.

1202
01:40:48,854 --> 01:40:50,930
Don't cry.

1203
01:40:52,138 --> 01:40:54,221
You never thought about me.

1204
01:40:54,638 --> 01:40:56,638
What would happen
to me without you?

1205
01:40:56,971 --> 01:40:58,721
What would happen to Mitthu?

1206
01:40:59,135 --> 01:41:02,138
I cannot even think
of Mitthu without you.

1207
01:41:04,763 --> 01:41:07,388
Both of you are
always happy together.

1208
01:41:08,596 --> 01:41:13,388
Even if I were not here, it
would not have made any difference.

1209
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,930
I thought this
was the only way out.

1210
01:41:18,138 --> 01:41:22,471
You fool!
We are nothing without you.

1211
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:25,221
We need you. Do you understand?

1212
01:41:25,305 --> 01:41:27,513
Look at this. These are
the equity share records.

1213
01:41:27,596 --> 01:41:29,638
The money that I
had given to uncle..

1214
01:41:29,721 --> 01:41:31,971
This is an account
of every penny of it.

1215
01:41:34,513 --> 01:41:39,138
Meena, I tried hard
to prove my innocence.

1216
01:41:39,633 --> 01:41:42,471
But the old
stock-brokering company was closed.

1217
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,305
The records could not be found.

1218
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:47,131
Suddenly I remembered that
my old papers should be in..

1219
01:41:47,211 --> 01:41:50,055
Those boxes which I had
sent here from Mumbai.

1220
01:41:50,388 --> 01:41:51,763
And I found them.

1221
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:53,596
Vinod!

1222
01:41:54,388 --> 01:41:57,211
Meena, do you remember
those difficult times..

1223
01:41:57,291 --> 01:41:59,430
When we were living only on hope?

1224
01:41:59,513 --> 01:42:01,930
I was putting all the
money in the share market.

1225
01:42:02,096 --> 01:42:04,721
Hoping that some day
I'll make profits.

1226
01:42:05,055 --> 01:42:09,638
The day arrived soon. Immediately
after the case, I got Rs.50,000.

1227
01:42:10,055 --> 01:42:12,096
I went to uncle with the cash.

1228
01:42:12,305 --> 01:42:14,096
He did the rest.

1229
01:42:14,763 --> 01:42:18,263
Look at this. These are the
papers accounting for Rs.50,000.

1230
01:42:19,096 --> 01:42:22,346
"In the blue sky."

1231
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:25,430
"In the blue sky."

1232
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:28,513
"The sea is seen."

1233
01:42:28,682 --> 01:42:31,633
"In the blue sky."

1234
01:42:31,713 --> 01:42:34,866
"The sea is seen."

1235
01:42:35,336 --> 01:42:41,066
"The sky in the sea."

1236
01:42:41,146 --> 01:42:46,633
"The sky in the sea."

1237
01:42:47,146 --> 01:42:53,255
"To the unknown.."

1238
01:42:53,471 --> 01:42:59,579
"The mind worries
about the unknown."

1239
01:42:59,659 --> 01:43:05,755
"The mind worries
about the unknown."

1240
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:11,931
"It fears the known."

1241
01:43:12,255 --> 01:43:20,255
"The mind's bird flies
with the wings of the eyes."

1242
01:43:24,769 --> 01:43:30,877
"Leaving the hand it's going away."

1243
01:43:30,957 --> 01:43:36,756
"It calls out from far away."

1244
01:43:36,945 --> 01:43:43,161
"With the wings of the eyes."

1245
01:44:05,363 --> 01:44:06,696
Yes!

1246
01:44:07,391 --> 01:44:08,529
- Mr. Vinod Joshi?
- Yes.

1247
01:44:08,613 --> 01:44:10,279
- Mrs. Joshi?
- Yes.

1248
01:44:10,404 --> 01:44:12,613
- You'll have to come to Mumbai with me.
- Why?

1249
01:44:12,696 --> 01:44:16,154
- Last night Rosy was murdered in Colaba.
- Rosy?

1250
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:18,196
Meena, don't say anything.

1251
01:44:18,738 --> 01:44:22,279
- Are we under arrest?
- No, but it would be better if you come with me.

1252
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:25,863
- May we change clothes?
- Yes.

1253
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:27,863
Come on, Meena.

1254
01:44:44,488 --> 01:44:46,654
Please pass me my glasses
from there. Hurry up.

1255
01:44:46,946 --> 01:44:48,738
But what are you doing, Vinod?

1256
01:44:49,071 --> 01:44:51,071
I know what I'm doing.
It is necessary.

1257
01:45:09,446 --> 01:45:11,238
Vinod, why are you running away?

1258
01:45:11,446 --> 01:45:14,363
- I had gone there.
- Oh, God!

1259
01:45:14,654 --> 01:45:17,154
Last night I had forgotten
my keys there.

1260
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:20,154
My fingerprints are all over the
house as well as on the knife.

1261
01:45:20,321 --> 01:45:22,613
It is necessary for my defence.

1262
01:45:23,446 --> 01:45:25,113
Otherwise they will trap me.

1263
01:45:25,238 --> 01:45:27,196
Don't worry. We are not arrested.

1264
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:28,654
But..

1265
01:46:33,965 --> 01:46:35,757
Meena, don't come with me.
You stay here.

1266
01:46:36,007 --> 01:46:38,423
Vinod, please let me come too.
Please!

1267
01:46:38,590 --> 01:46:40,507
No, Meena.
I'll bring him right now.

1268
01:46:40,798 --> 01:46:42,298
Can you find that person, Vinod?

1269
01:46:42,382 --> 01:46:45,173
Why not? He stays opposite him.
He is his neighbour.

1270
01:47:02,298 --> 01:47:04,965
- Oh, you?
- Listen, this is important.

1271
01:47:05,048 --> 01:47:06,798
You must help me.
You should stand witness.

1272
01:47:06,882 --> 01:47:09,082
- About what happened last night..
- No, I know nothing.

1273
01:47:09,132 --> 01:47:10,840
- I don't want police trouble.
- Please!

1274
01:47:10,923 --> 01:47:12,899
- The police had come today. I didn't meet them.
- Listen to me!

1275
01:47:12,923 --> 01:47:14,340
- I know nothing.
- Please!

1276
01:47:39,975 --> 01:47:41,257
- You can't do this.
- No.

1277
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,340
Why don't you understand?

1278
01:47:42,368 --> 01:47:44,558
- I won't come.
- An innocent life will be destroyed.

1279
01:47:44,638 --> 01:47:47,632
- A family will be ruined.
- I won't come. No!

1280
01:47:47,715 --> 01:47:48,755
- Why won't you come?
- Go!

1281
01:47:48,826 --> 01:47:50,701
You must come with me
or I'll call the police.

1282
01:47:50,785 --> 01:47:52,701
Why do you harass me?

1283
01:47:52,785 --> 01:47:55,243
- You must try to understand..
- Please go.

1284
01:47:55,326 --> 01:47:56,886
- Please forgive me.
- If you don't give your statement to the police..

1285
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:59,285
Go away! Go!

1286
01:47:59,368 --> 01:48:02,451
No! Please! For humanity's sake.

1287
01:48:02,785 --> 01:48:04,701
I assure you that
you'll not be affected.

1288
01:48:04,785 --> 01:48:06,660
You only have to
tell what you've seen.

1289
01:48:06,785 --> 01:48:08,076
You have to tell the truth.

1290
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,743
You have to tell police that
when I left here last night..

1291
01:48:10,826 --> 01:48:11,993
Rosy was alive.

1292
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:13,496
She had closed the door.

1293
01:48:13,576 --> 01:48:16,451
You're right.
But I don't want police trouble.

1294
01:48:16,535 --> 01:48:19,201
- Go away!
- For the sake of my wife and my child.

1295
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:22,660
We'll be ruined. And you'll
be a partner in this sin.

1296
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:27,868
Don't think too much.
Please come with me.

1297
01:48:28,868 --> 01:48:31,243
- All right. Let's go.
- Thank you.

1298
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:33,660
Please hurry up.

1299
01:48:33,743 --> 01:48:35,576
I'll always be indebted
to you, Mr. Bhalekar.

1300
01:48:35,701 --> 01:48:37,451
Hurry up. My car is parked outside.

1301
01:48:37,535 --> 01:48:39,160
Tell the police
whatever you've seen.

1302
01:48:39,285 --> 01:48:43,618
I'm alone.
To get into such matters..

1303
01:48:43,701 --> 01:48:46,243
And did anybody think that
something like this would happen?

1304
01:48:47,201 --> 01:48:50,541
- Come.
- To tell the truth, when you left, I had heard a scream..

1305
01:48:51,307 --> 01:48:54,448
- Hey!
- Man Singh, let him go. Man Singh!

1306
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,070
Your anger has still not subsided,
Mr. Joshi?

1307
01:48:57,513 --> 01:48:58,862
I say, let him go.

1308
01:48:58,942 --> 01:49:00,461
No, don't move forward.

1309
01:49:00,718 --> 01:49:03,624
Oh, he will kill me.
Mr. Joshi, he'll kill me.

1310
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:06,502
Bhalekar, shut up.
Don't make a noise.

1311
01:49:06,846 --> 01:49:11,013
If you want him alive,
move forward.

1312
01:49:11,256 --> 01:49:12,596
- Come on.
- What do you mean?

1313
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:15,596
Please move. Or I'll die.

1314
01:49:15,733 --> 01:49:17,596
Move forward.

1315
01:49:23,046 --> 01:49:26,721
Mr. Joshi, take this.

1316
01:49:28,221 --> 01:49:29,763
Open the door.

1317
01:49:29,929 --> 01:49:34,096
Please open, Mr. Joshi.
Please save me.

1318
01:49:36,455 --> 01:49:37,929
Key, Mr. Joshi.

1319
01:49:39,492 --> 01:49:40,596
Get inside.

1320
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:42,888
Please go inside, Mr. Joshi.

1321
01:49:43,179 --> 01:49:45,239
Don't do anything to him.
If something happens to him..

1322
01:49:45,263 --> 01:49:47,263
I'll not let you go alive.

1323
01:49:51,559 --> 01:49:53,304
- Please get inside quietly.
- Hey!

1324
01:49:53,388 --> 01:49:56,221
Open the door.
I say, open the door.

1325
01:49:56,304 --> 01:49:58,554
- Don't harm him.
- I won't harm him.

1326
01:49:58,638 --> 01:50:01,804
- If something happens..
- Don't scream, Mr. Joshi.

1327
01:50:05,927 --> 01:50:09,095
- I won't scream. Man Singh, listen to me..
- Where are you taking me?

1328
01:50:09,175 --> 01:50:11,735
- Man Singh, please don't do anything to him.
- Please let me go.

1329
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,870
Man Singh! Damn it.

1330
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:15,596
Is anybody there?

1331
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:16,984
Is anybody there?

1332
01:50:17,064 --> 01:50:18,132
- Vinod?
- Open the door.

1333
01:50:18,212 --> 01:50:20,532
- Vinod, what happened?
- Please call somebody immediately.

1334
01:50:20,585 --> 01:50:22,650
- Are you all right?
- His life is in danger.

1335
01:50:22,837 --> 01:50:25,701
I'm locked inside.
Quickly! Somebody is in danger.

1336
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:27,513
- Run!
- Yes, I'll come right away.

1337
01:50:30,263 --> 01:50:32,554
There is nobody over there,
Meena. Go downstairs.

1338
01:50:36,557 --> 01:50:38,554
Hurry up.

1339
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,471
- Inspector!
- Are you alone here? Where is Mr. Joshi?

1340
01:50:45,554 --> 01:50:48,327
Please hurry up. Vinod is
locked in Man Singh's room.

1341
01:50:48,407 --> 01:50:49,717
Please hurry up.

1342
01:50:49,797 --> 01:50:51,780
Locked in Man Singh's room?
What kind of ploy is this?

1343
01:50:51,804 --> 01:50:52,911
Come to the police station with me.

1344
01:50:52,935 --> 01:50:54,846
You can't play with
the law in this manner.

1345
01:51:01,096 --> 01:51:02,525
- Rane!
- Yes, sir.

1346
01:51:02,628 --> 01:51:04,770
- Who went inside the building?
- I was following Man Singh.

1347
01:51:04,794 --> 01:51:06,461
They came here after Man Singh.

1348
01:51:06,544 --> 01:51:09,044
Inspector, Vinod went
in before Man Singh.

1349
01:51:09,258 --> 01:51:11,961
Please listen to me.
Come upstairs and look.

1350
01:51:12,286 --> 01:51:13,886
- He knows nothing.
- Rane, is she right?

1351
01:51:13,919 --> 01:51:15,329
- No, sir. I was following Man Singh.
- You have to come upstairs!

1352
01:51:15,353 --> 01:51:17,253
Don't waste my time and
come with me.

1353
01:51:23,586 --> 01:51:27,003
I'm telling the truth. Please listen
to me otherwise it will be too late.

1354
01:51:27,086 --> 01:51:29,544
Inspector, please help Vinod.

1355
01:51:53,523 --> 01:51:55,253
You have to do everything.

1356
01:51:55,336 --> 01:51:58,211
You have to climb.
You have to fall.

1357
01:51:58,405 --> 01:52:04,044
No! Please don't kill me.
I beg of you.

1358
01:52:08,994 --> 01:52:10,503
Come on.

1359
01:52:27,745 --> 01:52:29,919
Mr. Joshi!

1360
01:52:30,203 --> 01:52:31,503
Mr. Joshi?

1361
01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:35,794
Please don't kill me.

1362
01:52:38,181 --> 01:52:41,169
- Let me go.
- I'll count up to 10.

1363
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,250
One, two, three..

1364
01:52:45,765 --> 01:52:47,544
- Four..
- Don't kill me.

1365
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:50,836
Just a while back there
was sound from inside.

1366
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,419
Please do something.
Break the door.

1367
01:52:53,503 --> 01:52:55,044
Please, Inspector.

1368
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:56,586
Move aside, Rane!

1369
01:52:58,402 --> 01:53:01,294
- Let me go..
- Eight, nine..

1370
01:53:01,751 --> 01:53:04,003
Bhalekar, run.

1371
01:53:11,365 --> 01:53:13,540
Where will you run?

1372
01:53:13,794 --> 01:53:16,057
Joshi, save me!

1373
01:53:16,141 --> 01:53:17,807
Please save me. Save me.

1374
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:21,157
Stop! What's wrong with you?

1375
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:24,100
Have you gone mad?
Why are you after him?

1376
01:53:24,184 --> 01:53:27,627
- To prepare a proof against you.
- What proof against me?

1377
01:53:27,707 --> 01:53:30,059
What was the evidence
against Subramaniam?

1378
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:31,706
Both of you were drunk.

1379
01:53:31,786 --> 01:53:33,793
His fingerprints were
only on the knife.

1380
01:53:33,873 --> 01:53:35,802
Your fingerprints
are all over house.

1381
01:53:35,882 --> 01:53:37,285
Your key is there too.

1382
01:53:37,424 --> 01:53:40,529
Bhalekar saw you running
away after killing Rosy.

1383
01:53:40,609 --> 01:53:42,511
Just as you had seen Subramaniam.

1384
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:44,913
- What nonsense are you talking?
- I'm not crazy.

1385
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:48,393
I'll stand witness against
you that you killed Bhalekar.

1386
01:53:48,518 --> 01:53:51,435
I tried my best to save him,
but I couldn't do anything.

1387
01:53:51,518 --> 01:53:53,036
As if the police will
accept whatever you say.

1388
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,601
Why not?

1389
01:53:54,685 --> 01:53:56,060
- Let go of him.
- I won't.

1390
01:53:56,143 --> 01:53:57,351
- You won't?
- No.

1391
01:53:57,435 --> 01:53:58,441
You won't?

1392
01:54:00,478 --> 01:54:02,643
- Bhalekar, run! Run!
- I'll die.

1393
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,851
- Stop him!
- Run!

1394
01:54:13,893 --> 01:54:16,268
Is anybody inside?

1395
01:54:16,435 --> 01:54:18,976
Please open the door.

1396
01:54:19,276 --> 01:54:22,641
The door won't open, Mr.
Joshi. Nobody is coming.

1397
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:25,284
It is closed so who'll come?

1398
01:54:25,364 --> 01:54:27,616
Now what can I do? Where can I go?

1399
01:54:27,948 --> 01:54:29,948
What do I do, Mr. Joshi?

1400
01:54:30,224 --> 01:54:32,065
Is anybody there?

1401
01:54:32,145 --> 01:54:35,303
Please open the door.
Anybody there?

1402
01:54:43,071 --> 01:54:45,120
What can I do now?

1403
01:55:20,678 --> 01:55:23,030
Inspector,
they must be somewhere else.

1404
01:55:23,551 --> 01:55:24,935
How many doors I'll have to break?

1405
01:55:25,357 --> 01:55:26,731
Enough of your trick. Come with me.

1406
01:55:26,755 --> 01:55:27,915
Something is certainly wrong.

1407
01:55:28,124 --> 01:55:30,044
Vinod had said that
somebody's life is in danger.

1408
01:55:30,437 --> 01:55:31,875
Those people..

1409
01:55:33,194 --> 01:55:36,891
Inspector,
I have never lied in my life.

1410
01:55:37,269 --> 01:55:39,474
Please save Vinod. I..

1411
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:45,074
Rane, search the whole building.
Come on.

1412
01:55:53,873 --> 01:55:55,246
What a path!

1413
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:59,051
I'll show him now.

1414
01:56:06,221 --> 01:56:07,832
Doesn't matter.

1415
01:56:59,335 --> 01:57:03,433
You dare do this?
I'll teach you a lesson.

1416
01:57:04,168 --> 01:57:07,238
Stop, don't run away. Come here.

1417
01:57:16,189 --> 01:57:18,064
No! Stop him!

1418
01:57:18,147 --> 01:57:20,480
Bhalekar, have you gone mad?

1419
01:57:20,564 --> 01:57:23,147
I'll not let him get away.
I'll kill him.

1420
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:24,540
- Come to your senses.
- Let go of me.

1421
01:57:24,564 --> 01:57:26,540
If he dies, then what's the
difference between you and him?

1422
01:57:26,564 --> 01:57:27,855
I won't let him get away.

1423
01:57:27,939 --> 01:57:29,480
I'll kill him!

1424
01:57:29,731 --> 01:57:32,897
Bhalekar, come to your senses.
Today he can't run away from us.

1425
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,897
Mr. Joshi, he has run away.

1426
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,522
He ran away. What have you done?

1427
01:57:36,605 --> 01:57:38,531
Man Singh,
I won't let you get away.

1428
01:57:38,715 --> 01:57:45,807
- Man Singh!
- Man Singh!

1429
01:57:48,109 --> 01:57:49,939
Somebody is coming. Police!

1430
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:51,373
- What is happening here?
- Thank God.

1431
01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:52,522
- Vinod!
- Police is here.

1432
01:57:52,605 --> 01:57:53,939
Meena, I'm okay. He is here.

1433
01:57:54,022 --> 01:57:55,373
Inspector, Man Singh was
trying to kill both of us.

1434
01:57:55,397 --> 01:57:56,956
Please come, Inspector.
He must be nearby here.

1435
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:58,522
- Come on.
- Man Singh, where are you?

1436
01:57:58,605 --> 01:58:00,956
- Man Singh!
- Police have arrived to take you to the gallows.

1437
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:02,602
It is impossible.

1438
01:58:02,682 --> 01:58:06,522
Nobody can hang me.

1439
01:58:06,769 --> 01:58:09,480
- I'll kill myself before that.
- No, Man Singh.

1440
01:58:09,564 --> 01:58:11,730
No! Mr. Joshi, don't come here.

1441
01:58:11,904 --> 01:58:14,647
If you move a step forward,
I'll jump off.

1442
01:58:14,963 --> 01:58:17,480
No, Man Singh.
Please don't do this.

1443
01:58:17,818 --> 01:58:20,218
Man Singh, believe me. Come down.
Nothing will happen to you.

1444
01:58:20,412 --> 01:58:22,314
Look, didn't I save you
from Bhalekar?

1445
01:58:22,397 --> 01:58:23,730
Believe me. Come down.

1446
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:25,758
Please believe me,
nothing will happen to you.

1447
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:27,314
Don't try to trap me.

1448
01:58:27,623 --> 01:58:30,439
Nobody is trying to trap you.
Please come down.

1449
01:58:31,547 --> 01:58:34,189
Man Singh, come down.
Please, come down.

1450
01:58:34,272 --> 01:58:37,980
Don't be a coward.
Tell the police who killed Rosy.

1451
01:58:38,064 --> 01:58:39,415
And why you were trying to kill us?

1452
01:58:39,439 --> 01:58:40,980
Bhalekar, forget all about it.

1453
01:58:41,064 --> 01:58:42,810
Was Man Singh trying
to kill us deliberately?

1454
01:58:42,834 --> 01:58:44,772
He is sick. He needs treatment.

1455
01:58:47,341 --> 01:58:50,522
So you are trying to send
me to mental institution?

1456
01:58:50,605 --> 01:58:52,939
No, Man Singh, to the police
station. Come on. Get down.

1457
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:56,772
Very good, Inspector. You caught
him. I was going to kill him.

1458
01:58:56,855 --> 01:58:59,647
Otherwise he'd have killed me.
And he'd have killed him too.

1459
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:01,689
You are
unnecessarily chasing Mr. Joshi.

1460
01:59:01,772 --> 01:59:05,147
When he left last night,
Rosy was alive. I've seen it.

1461
01:59:08,605 --> 01:59:10,439
She had closed the door.

1462
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:13,355
After that I heard a scream.

1463
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:15,189
But why should I get into trouble?

1464
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,022
Man Singh, what do you want to say?

1465
01:59:17,105 --> 01:59:18,730
I don't want to say anything.

1466
01:59:18,814 --> 01:59:22,230
Why not? Man Singh, tell the truth.

1467
01:59:22,397 --> 01:59:23,689
You were blackmailing us.

1468
01:59:23,772 --> 01:59:26,605
Rosy tried to stop you,
so you killed her. Isn't it?

1469
01:59:26,814 --> 01:59:30,355
Rosy loved you so much.
She lived for you.

1470
01:59:30,647 --> 01:59:32,355
Have you really killed her?

1471
01:59:32,439 --> 01:59:34,564
Crook, you're such a lowly person.

1472
01:59:34,647 --> 01:59:37,814
I've seen since years.
Rosy did so much for you.

1473
01:59:37,897 --> 01:59:40,772
But you? Even the dogs
are more loyal than you.

1474
01:59:40,855 --> 01:59:44,814
No, I didn't kill her.
You don't understand.

1475
01:59:45,094 --> 01:59:48,439
Truly, Mr. Joshi.
I didn't kill him deliberately.

1476
01:59:48,522 --> 01:59:50,814
It just happened.

1477
01:59:51,029 --> 01:59:53,230
Do you remember, Mr. Joshi?

1478
01:59:53,314 --> 01:59:55,605
I went to inside room
to save myself from you.

1479
01:59:55,938 --> 01:59:57,855
And I had switched off the lights.

1480
01:59:58,035 --> 02:00:01,022
Think about Mrs. Joshi.
Please do me a favour.

1481
02:00:01,147 --> 02:00:04,022
Please go to your home.
Please go home.

1482
02:00:04,105 --> 02:00:05,498
All right.
But you must talk to him.

1483
02:00:05,522 --> 02:00:08,480
If you dare, come inside.
Drunkard, Murderer.

1484
02:00:08,605 --> 02:00:12,064
You are in my control.
You can't do anything against me.

1485
02:00:12,272 --> 02:00:16,147
Come inside!
Who do you think you are?

1486
02:00:16,694 --> 02:00:19,105
Don't you fear me?

1487
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:21,897
Come in! I'll show you
the colour of blood.

1488
02:00:28,975 --> 02:00:34,683
Man Singh!
What has happened to you?

1489
02:00:34,882 --> 02:00:39,126
- I'll call the doctor.
- No, I don't need a doctor.

1490
02:00:39,677 --> 02:00:41,829
Give up everything.

1491
02:00:43,515 --> 02:00:47,991
Return their happiness
to them, Man.

1492
02:00:49,958 --> 02:00:56,174
Even if God forgives you..

1493
02:00:57,396 --> 02:01:04,218
Rosy will never
forgive you for that.

1494
02:01:07,201 --> 02:01:08,628
Rosy.

1495
02:01:10,325 --> 02:01:11,569
Rosy?

1496
02:01:13,582 --> 02:01:16,040
For a long time we stayed that way.

1497
02:01:16,332 --> 02:01:18,957
Her life came to an end slowly.

1498
02:01:19,168 --> 02:01:21,707
I too didn't want to live.

1499
02:01:22,082 --> 02:01:27,207
But when it was morning,
again I wanted to live.

1500
02:01:27,634 --> 02:01:31,915
So I wrote a complaint against
Mr. Joshi to the police.

1501
02:01:32,791 --> 02:01:36,540
But now I'm very tired.

1502
02:01:37,277 --> 02:01:40,957
I need sleep very badly.

1503
02:01:41,255 --> 02:01:43,999
Mr. Joshi, I've really
not slept for 10 years.

1504
02:01:44,415 --> 02:01:48,874
Yes, Mrs. Joshi, this is the
only truth that I've told you.

1505
02:01:48,954 --> 02:01:53,749
I had gone to that office
10 years ago only to steal money.

1506
02:01:53,957 --> 02:01:58,332
The work was over so I came out.

1507
02:01:58,582 --> 02:02:03,665
"The man's heart is so unyielding."

1508
02:02:04,877 --> 02:02:06,249
Subbu!

1509
02:02:07,207 --> 02:02:08,374
Subbu?

1510
02:02:08,454 --> 02:02:10,942
Subbu!

1511
02:02:16,393 --> 02:02:20,935
I just stabbed him and I ran away.

1512
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:24,685
I was unfortunate that
Mr. Kale died.

1513
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:29,060
Oh, God! You murdered Mr. Kale too.

1514
02:02:29,185 --> 02:02:33,351
Yes, I did. Subramaniam
had already gone home.

1515
02:02:33,677 --> 02:02:36,101
Mr. Kale thought I was Subramaniam.

1516
02:02:36,347 --> 02:02:37,768
You too thought the same.

1517
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:40,351
And what did you do
with the stolen money?

1518
02:02:40,518 --> 02:02:44,400
I was very afraid, and thought
somebody was following me.

1519
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:49,435
I was hiding near a pool.
And then..

1520
02:03:14,033 --> 02:03:17,935
I'm really unfortunate.
I can't swim.

1521
02:03:18,393 --> 02:03:21,226
When I came back home,
I found out that Mr. Kale died.

1522
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:23,518
After that I stayed at
home as I was afraid.

1523
02:03:23,601 --> 02:03:25,393
And I fell sick.

1524
02:03:26,606 --> 02:03:29,685
But that letter..
After so many years..

1525
02:03:30,143 --> 02:03:36,185
Just like that. A few days ago
I had gone to meet Mr. Joshi.

1526
02:03:36,351 --> 02:03:38,060
He refused to see me.

1527
02:03:38,143 --> 02:03:42,435
So I wrote something in anger.

1528
02:03:42,607 --> 02:03:46,018
I hadn't even thought that
it would affect you so much.

1529
02:03:46,351 --> 02:03:51,976
But you believed that
letter and invited sorrow.

1530
02:03:55,476 --> 02:03:56,935
Vinod!

1531
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:02,685
What a tale.
You are really unfortunate.

1532
02:04:02,893 --> 02:04:04,435
Come on. Rane!

1533
02:04:04,856 --> 02:04:07,268
Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Joshi,
you had to face trouble.

1534
02:04:07,935 --> 02:04:10,369
Mr. Bhalekar, had you informed
the police about this yesterday..

1535
02:04:10,393 --> 02:04:11,827
This drama would not
have occurred today.

1536
02:04:11,851 --> 02:04:13,351
Come on, Rane.

1537
02:04:15,018 --> 02:04:19,685
Inspector, please forgive me.
I made a mistake.

1538
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:21,976
But today I've learnt a lot.

1539
02:04:27,472 --> 02:04:29,018
Mr. Joshi, forgive me.

1540
02:04:29,101 --> 02:04:31,393
You had to face trouble
because of me.

1541
02:04:31,667 --> 02:04:33,893
I'll go now. Bye.

1542
02:04:36,099 --> 02:04:39,393
Vinod, are you all right?

1543
02:04:39,645 --> 02:04:41,643
Let's go to the doctor.

1544
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,143
Meena, I'm a murderer too.

1545
02:04:47,429 --> 02:04:49,685
Man Singh murdered Mr. Kale.

1546
02:04:50,326 --> 02:04:52,226
I did the same to Mr. Subramaniam.

1547
02:04:53,268 --> 02:04:56,435
I gave him ten years
of living death.

1548
02:04:57,428 --> 02:05:00,393
I knew that there was some mistake.

1549
02:05:00,672 --> 02:05:03,476
So I used to get
disturbed by the past.

1550
02:05:04,268 --> 02:05:07,601
But Vinod, you didn't
do that deliberately.

1551
02:05:08,226 --> 02:05:14,560
No, Meena. In those days I was
sure that I had seen Subramaniam.

1552
02:05:15,116 --> 02:05:17,143
And I stood witness
thinking I was true.

1553
02:05:17,893 --> 02:05:21,560
But after the case,
the matter began to disturb me.

1554
02:05:21,851 --> 02:05:23,435
And my frustration increased.

1555
02:05:23,518 --> 02:05:25,976
But there were other
evidences against him.

1556
02:05:26,726 --> 02:05:29,726
Yes, Meena. He too is unfortunate.

1557
02:05:30,186 --> 02:05:33,601
But what can I do about it?

1558
02:05:36,101 --> 02:05:38,101
Please don't get disturbed.

1559
02:05:38,476 --> 02:05:43,268
I'm with you.
Your whole life is ahead of you.

1560
02:05:43,685 --> 02:05:46,601
We'll do our best to ensure that
his family is well off in life.

1561
02:05:47,393 --> 02:05:50,143
Can we do this, Meena?

1562
02:05:50,768 --> 02:05:52,435
Yes, Vinod.

1563
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,310
Meena!
