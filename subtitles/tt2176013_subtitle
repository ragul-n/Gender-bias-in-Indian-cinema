1
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,457
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,207
Bomb suit for Major Anand, sir...

3
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,165
He won't wear it.

4
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,749
But sir... I mean...

5
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,707
Keep watching.

6
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,249
What is it, Dewan?

7
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,624
I can't figure it out, sir,

8
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,457
it looks like a radio
control servo with a switch,

9
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,124
but I can't locate the receiver

10
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,457
and the x-ray hasn't
shown up anything either.

11
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,165
You rest, I'll take a look.

12
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,374
OK, sir.

13
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,624
Sir, is this the
same Major Samar Anand,

14
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,124
who has the record for
the maximum number of bombs defused?

15
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,665
Yup, 97 bombs,

16
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,624
this is the 98th,

17
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,624
and he goes into the lap
of each bomb just like this,

18
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,915
without any protection,

19
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,040
as if it's not a bomb,

20
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,249
but the arms of his girlfriend.

21
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,624
Sir, is that why they call
him 'the man who cannot die'?

22
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,249
Yes, 'The Man Who Cannot Die'

23
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,915
All of us have to die one day

24
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,665
and so will he,

25
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,915
until today I've never seen
the fear of death in his eyes

26
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,124
I can't understand the kind of
fate he's had written for him.

27
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:08,540
They had hidden the receiver within
the RDX and covered it with lead,

28
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,707
that's why the X-ray couldn't catch it

29
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,957
Singh, open up the market.

30
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,040
Okay sir.

31
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,040
Amaanullah, sir, open the market.

32
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,832
Your eyes, impish and mischievous.

33
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,624
Your laughter's nonchalant insolence.

34
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,040
Your hair unfurled their waves undone.

35
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,249
Never shall I forget.

36
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,582
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

37
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,040
Your hand that abandoned mine.

38
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,374
Your shadow that turned away it's gaze.

39
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,165
Your look that never looked back.

40
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,124
Never shall I forgive.

41
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,665
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

42
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,540
Your unabashed dancing in the rain.

43
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,749
Your silly sulkings
at all things small.

44
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,207
Your innocent childlike mischief.

45
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,665
Always I will love.

46
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,040
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

47
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,082
Your false vows and promises.

48
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,874
Your burning scorching dreams.

49
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,249
Your cruel ruthless prayers.

50
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,290
Always I will hate.

51
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,790
Until I breathe this life,
Until I breathe this life.

52
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,707
In the name of God...

53
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,290
Oh shit!

54
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,749
The water is freezing...

55
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,874
Help!

56
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,707
Soldier!

57
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,040
Water... col... cold...
freezing... please

58
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,290
help please...

59
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,624
please...

60
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,499
what if I had died?

61
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,707
Couldn't you have come earlier?

62
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,957
You're a soldier...

63
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,499
you'll... have taken
some oath haven't you...

64
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,707
to save lives of fellow Indians?

65
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,915
I was in such a dangerous situation...

66
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,874
I could have died...

67
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,290
Arsehole!

68
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,040
Nice!

69
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,582
Oh God!

70
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,040
Akira!

71
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,124
I can't believe you actually did it!

72
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,165
Just pay up guys!

73
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,332
I'm going bankrupt because of you,

74
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,874
this is the fifth dare in 3 weeks,

75
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,665
for once can you not complete a dare?

76
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,040
Stop being such a wuss, Sam,

77
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,603
two more days and you all will
be in the London discovery office

78
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,332
and I will be stuck in Delhi,

79
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,178
and then you will miss
me and you'll be like

80
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,165
I wish I had given Akira all my money,

81
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,040
after all she got
paid shit as an intern

82
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,124
I won't miss you.

83
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,124
Alright, you lot listen up,
stop whatever it is you are doing,

84
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,207
it's my day off,

85
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,832
so I don't want to see any
of your ugly faces today,

86
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,957
but tomorrow morning I
want your boney arses,

87
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,874
back here at 7 o'clock sharp.

88
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,290
Aye, aye, Captain

89
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,624
Catherine!

90
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,874
Piss off, Akira.

91
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,790
Did you think about
taking me with you to London?

92
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,957
Yes I did and the answer
is no, so get out of my face.

93
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,540
Bitch!

94
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,957
Oh, God, man...

95
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,082
Arjun, I told you it's
over between us man,

96
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,374
stop calling me...

97
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,374
Arjun,

98
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,832
it's only a 6-month relationship,
why are you getting so hyper?

99
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,540
You still love me but
now I don't, simple,

100
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,207
come on, get over it,
we'll talk later!

101
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,874
Samar Anand...

102
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,415
In a way, I had already
lived twenty-five years,

103
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,915
but my life,
actually began on this day,

104
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,707
The first day of my story,

105
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,082
the first time I saw snow fall,

106
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:22,290
the first time I saw
an angel glide across the snow.

107
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
Did You have to make
the snow fall right now,

108
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,434
couldn't You have
waited 10 minutes more?

109
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,290
Such an expensive dress, it got wet.

110
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,915
Anyway, my results are out,

111
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,665
I topped the university.

112
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,124
Dad is very happy.

113
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,165
Thank You,

114
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,690
and yes, like I promised You,
no more chocolates from today...

115
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,332
never, I promise.

116
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,624
Okay, now listen carefully,
today our work is very important.

117
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,499
There's a music
ceremony at Bina aunty's

118
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,957
and Mrs Sanger wants to hook me
up with her wall street banker son.

119
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,790
Please, please, please make
sure that he doesn't fancy me,

120
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,665
I will also fully
try to make sure but,

121
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:29,040
You know how Indian boys behave
stupid, when they're around me

122
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,082
and in any case,
I am not going to marry an Indian boy,

123
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,957
'remember me telling You this?

124
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,374
Please don't get me married
to any Indian boy,

125
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,915
they are all very brown.

126
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,249
Please find me a
nice handsome white boy,

127
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,624
please, please, please.

128
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,082
But You have to make sure that
Dad doesn't like that banker,

129
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,040
because You know...
I can never fight with Dad.

130
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,207
So please, please, please don't
let this happen and I promise that...

131
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,790
I promise, I will stop
wearing fur coats from today,

132
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,082
and You know how much I love fur.

133
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,082
Okay?

134
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,457
Deal?

135
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,915
Please take care of this.

136
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,832
Thanks.

137
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,040
Wow, sir Jesus,
what specimens You have to bear,

138
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,957
very hard work, sir,

139
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,499
God bless You, sir.

140
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,540
Hey Samar, what you doing man?

141
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,332
You were supposed to be
finished by lunch time.

142
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,290
No worry, Jack Sir,

143
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,165
I finish twenty minutes
fully clean, shaving and shining.

144
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,624
I'm picking you up in half an hour,
make sure it's done.

145
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,624
Done, done, okay,
ta-ta, see you, bye bye,

146
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,582
from the ground in this country
grows snow, grows white white snow.

147
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,207
Come on Zain, it's morning, get up.

148
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,290
London's opened her
arms and is calling you.

149
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,207
Come on, get up, hurry up,
hurry up, hurry up.

150
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,457
Oh man

151
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,790
London is upset with me, my friend,

152
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,874
it does not give me even
a half day of work.

153
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,957
It's rubbish that
she has her arms open for me.

154
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,332
Oh London, do something for me,

155
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,082
it seems I might
have to return to Lahore.

156
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,374
Oh man, Kapoor uncle,
was asking for the rent,

157
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,165
he was saying we have
to vacate the flat today.

158
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,832
You relax and eat your eggs,

159
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,207
I'll handle Uncle.

160
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:50,957
Sure?

161
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,874
Yes, for sure.

162
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,374
You're too good.

163
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,040
- God bless.
- Bye,

164
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,540
we'll meet again.

165
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,040
Rascal... has again left
money for the whole week,

166
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:41,458
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

167
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,499
Where is my home?

168
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,874
He asks every passer-by.

169
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,082
Wanders with a smile...

170
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,082
and a tear.

171
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,332
Wanders aimless from street to street.

172
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,249
Belonging to all.

173
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,249
Yet none to call my own.

174
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,832
Wanders aimless from street to street.

175
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:15,958
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

176
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,082
Where is my home?

177
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,415
He asks every passer-by.

178
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:32,624
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

179
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,207
Dipped in rainbow colours,

180
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,457
with voice of a nightingale.

181
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,707
With steps radiating sunlight,

182
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,499
with palanquin of cooling shade.

183
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,624
Dipped in rainbow colours,

184
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,707
with voice of a nightingale.

185
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,790
With steps radiating sunlight,

186
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,749
with palanquin of cooling shade.

187
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,749
Seeking the moon amidst dark clouds.

188
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,540
Listening for the mute wind's song.

189
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,707
This friend of mine is everywhere.

190
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,999
Unseen to the eye,
fragrant to the smell.

191
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:53,916
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

192
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,957
Where is my home?

193
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,915
He asks every passer-by.

194
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:10,957
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

195
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:49,082
With the beloved, no union,
nor separation.

196
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:57,333
Prisoner of love, never unchained.

197
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:02,165
Your promise of appearing in a dream.

198
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,040
Keeps sleep far from my eyes.

199
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,124
The breath I take quickens.

200
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,957
My pulse becomes fainter still.

201
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:23,291
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

202
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,249
Where is my home?

203
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,457
He asks every passer-by.

204
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,874
Wanders with a smile...

205
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,874
and a tear.

206
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,915
Wanders aimless from street to street.

207
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,999
Belonging to all.

208
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,040
Yet none to call my own.

209
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,832
Wanders aimless from street to street.

210
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:57,916
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

211
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,040
Wanders aimless from street to street.

212
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:14,083
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

213
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,999
Here you go, 1 kilo tiger prawn,

214
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,665
7 sea bass, 6 squids and 1 octupussy.

215
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,999
Excellent, Samar.

216
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,415
And something waiting...

217
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,582
special, see...

218
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,624
Samar, you got my foie gras?

219
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,624
Your - fodegrass? You ask, I get.

220
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Thank you, Samar,
you always come through for me.

221
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,540
Look, if you ever get tired of this,

222
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,499
I have a job waiting for
you in one of my restaurants,

223
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,582
Thank you, sir,

224
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,665
Fodegrass.

225
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,040
Ladies and gentleman,

226
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:34,207
the newly engaged couple Roger
and my beautiful daughter Meera.

227
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,082
Hey, aren't you that guy
who sings that Challa song?

228
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,249
Yes, same to same, ma'am.

229
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,540
What are you doing here?

230
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,915
Madam, in your London it is
very difficult to earn pounds,

231
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,749
it is not possible to buy food
with one job, so double shift.

232
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,499
So, sir Jesus did not listen to you?

233
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:35,999
What?

234
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,915
That day in the church,
you told sir Jesus,

235
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,624
to make that boy not like you,

236
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,290
but today it is your arrangement...

237
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,207
Engagement.

238
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,790
Yes, yes, same.

239
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,790
How do you know all this?

240
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,207
That day outside the church,
I'm cleaning snow.

241
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,374
Listening to others'
confessions is not a good thing,

242
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:05,957
and for your information on that day
it did not work out with that boy,

243
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,457
so sir Jesus did
listen to me like always

244
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,624
I have known Roger for many years,

245
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,749
he's a really nice guy,

246
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:19,999
and I am very happy.

247
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:23,707
It does not look like it.

248
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:24,915
What the f...?

249
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,082
It's the biggest day of my life today,

250
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,290
and I am very, very happy,

251
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,082
got it?

252
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:35,790
Not got,

253
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,540
because when that nice guy,
was making you wear the ring,

254
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,915
you were not looking into his eyes,

255
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,582
you were looking at everyone else...

256
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:49,124
and now, you've left your
own engagement celebration,

257
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,832
and are sitting here alone, why?...

258
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:55,707
and why are you trying to
explain your decision to a stranger?

259
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,790
Go... got it.

260
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,540
Come on Meera uncle's
going nuts looking for you.

261
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,040
Will... I found her.

262
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,915
What the f...

263
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,040
The new logo will reflect
the ideals and images of both chains,

264
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:29,582
a total of 25 new supermarkets
will be opened in six new towns

265
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,540
and the whole merger and
expansion will take six months.

266
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,624
Thank you.

267
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,207
Well done. Roger, you've
thought about everything

268
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,790
I think it's time for me to
think about my retirement,

269
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,457
I am turning 50, best time to retire,

270
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:49,540
When is your Golden Jubilee?

271
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,499
Meera, we should plan a big party.

272
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:54,374
Don't worry, I've been planning
this party for more than a year now,

273
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:57,999
it's going to be the most special
party for the most special father.

274
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,707
Yes, and after that my
daughter will get married and then,

275
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,957
from a very special father
I'll turn into a very lonely father.

276
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,874
But that will only
happen if I leave you alone,

277
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,624
after our marriage
Roger will stay with us.

278
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,707
When did this happen?

279
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,665
Just now, just a small little
clause I've added in the contract

280
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,249
and it's non negotiable.

281
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:23,999
Sorry Roger, she's gone on me,
a very stubborn business woman,

282
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,457
you will have to deal with it

283
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,832
I am trying, I am trying.

284
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,165
Here, 500 pounds,

285
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,999
for an hour of your time
every day, for one month.

286
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,582
Who do I have to kill?

287
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,957
You'll have to teach me how to sing.

288
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,540
Why do you want to
learn how to sing from me?

289
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,707
My Dad's from Jalandhar,

290
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,790
and he's always wished
that I could speak Punjabi,

291
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,249
but I was never able to learn it.

292
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,582
It's his 50th birthday next month

293
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,832
and I want to surprise him
by singing a Punjabi song,

294
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,749
like the kind that you sing,

295
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,999
so will you teach me?

296
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:17,082
That way 500 pounds
will turn my life around,

297
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,945
but if I take these then
I may also completely turn around.

298
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,540
I'll explain.

299
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,249
My mother has taught me,

300
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,499
never take money for teaching someone,

301
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,957
so now you
understanding my problem?

302
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,999
So in that case teach
me without taking money.

303
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,124
Madam, I only look like,

304
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,832
but I am not that
big a fool, not dumbo.

305
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,499
Fine.

306
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,124
Okay, one minute, one second,
can we do a deal?

307
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,749
I teach you beautiful Punjabi song

308
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:50,915
and return gift you teach
me good gentleman's English

309
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,374
this is now fair and
handsome deal ma'am,

310
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:56,082
in one month you singing like
the Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar,

311
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,206
for your father's birthday

312
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,457
and I speak fit-fat constipation
with the white in full tip-top English.

313
00:27:02,291 --> 00:27:03,207
Conversation.

314
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,707
Same to same.

315
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,374
Done, done, London let's do it.

316
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,499
Done, done, London.

317
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,999
Sorry.

318
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,207
Please make sure my Punjabi rocks,

319
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,290
I wish that day to
be Dad's happiest day.

320
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,999
Please help me and I promise...

321
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:39,249
I promise...
I will never smoke again... ever.

322
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:38,707
O good... good morning.

323
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,832
Salmon, salmon... salmon!

324
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:50,207
Salmon... salmon!

325
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,166
SALMON!

326
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:08,874
Steak for the lady and
Salmon for the gentleman,

327
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,124
enjoy.

328
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:26,665
Meera.

329
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,290
Meera listen, I was joking...

330
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,124
Excuse me sir you haven't paid.

331
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:34,499
Meera I don't have money.

332
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,915
Sirsa is the name of
my village, in Punjab.

333
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,874
My father and
forefathers all served in the army,

334
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,499
but in some war or other
they gave their lives fighting.

335
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,124
When it was my time my
mother refused to let me join,

336
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,249
she somehow saved up
money and sent me here.

337
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,374
She had this unsaid faith in me
and felt that I'd do well here.

338
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,290
She says that I can win people's love

339
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,790
and those who can win
love will never lose.

340
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,582
Solid maternal instant.

341
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,749
Instinct.

342
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:10,374
Instant.

343
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,915
Okay, what eves...

344
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:15,040
Come, please come, bon appetite.

345
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,665
Come, come in,

346
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,707
Bon appetite...

347
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,749
Do you come here every Friday?

348
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:28,749
Yes!

349
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,082
Just here?

350
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:35,499
No, there's a Bangladeshi
orphanage that I go to on Mondays.

351
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,749
And...

352
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,374
On Wednesdays
I go to a women's shelter.

353
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:41,749
And...

354
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,249
A senior citizens' home on Sundays.

355
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,207
And...

356
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,624
That's it.

357
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,915
That's it...

358
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,124
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays,
they're all wasted, very bad.

359
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,082
Mother Teresa gave up her whole life,

360
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,499
oye, explain something to this girl.

361
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,499
Oye, fatty, how much
will you eat, start a diet,

362
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,082
come all, free food for everyone.

363
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,624
How much you give is how much you get,

364
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,790
I've learnt this in life,

365
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,040
but if everybody keeps asking
for more and no one gives back,

366
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,040
then how will anything be shared?

367
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,040
To get something you
have to lose something.

368
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,124
So that's why you keep
making deals with sir Jesus.

369
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:25,874
Not deals... prayers
that I make earnestly,

370
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:30,165
and that's why your sir Jesus has
agreed to everything I've told him.

371
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,999
Okay, so tell Him
to teach you how to sing.

372
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:36,040
Don't worry,
I've already spoken to Him.

373
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,082
Really...

374
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,499
Sir Jesus knows Punjabi too?

375
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,999
No friends, do not call me Heer

376
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,707
I am Sahiban now.

377
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:55,041
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

378
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,790
This is so not fair,

379
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,124
I've managed to
improve your English so much

380
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,249
and you're not able to
teach me even one song.

381
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,207
You've already learnt how to sing,

382
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,938
you're also speaking perfect Punjabi,

383
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,957
the tune is also fine.

384
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,165
What's the problem then?

385
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,624
The problem is that there
is no joy when you sing,

386
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,707
only fear,

387
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:25,665
you're scared this white
woman will be disturbed.

388
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,374
Scared that these
guys playing football,

389
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,999
will think you've runaway
from some poor Indian village.

390
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:29,707
Come on,

391
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:31,874
if you can't sing in front
of two or three strangers,

392
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,749
how will you sing to a
hundred people at the party?

393
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:34,874
Oh f... off!

394
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,749
Now this you enjoyed doing.

395
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,707
Miss Meera Thapar, the girl
you are when you act dignified,

396
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,915
you're not,

397
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,915
you're that girl who sneaks out
to smoke a cigarette,

398
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,749
and keeps cussing this what the f...?
What the f...? word.

399
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,082
I am not that girl

400
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,249
I need your phone please,

401
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,540
excuse me,

402
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,582
one second.

403
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,374
Hello Maria, Samar this side,

404
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,415
yes I want you to bring a friend
of mine to the tunnel tonight ok,

405
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,207
she will call you... and Maria...

406
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,957
she is a little shy
type so make her like you,

407
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,165
little sexy, un dos tres, ok bye

408
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,957
Maria works in the restaurant with me

409
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,957
and every Sunday night
all of us party together.

410
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,415
You have the number in your phone,
call her after six.

411
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,582
And no one knows you there...

412
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,499
so forjust one night
listen to your heart.

413
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,790
Why are you doing this?

414
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,415
Because I want to show
you who you really are.

415
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,290
Un dos tres...

416
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,957
Come on babe.

417
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:58,999
Hey Maria!

418
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,249
Oh hi.

419
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,874
What's up?

420
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,874
I'll will be right back.

421
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,415
Go get her tiger!

422
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:22,290
Hey Maria!

423
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,415
Hi...

424
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,249
I'll be right back.

425
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,790
Hello...

426
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:53,790
I'm Raj,

427
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,332
you are?

428
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,124
Tina...

429
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,082
Italian?

430
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,540
Indian.

431
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:09,832
You don't look Indian at all.

432
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,832
And you look completely Indian.

433
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,415
Why?

434
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,207
You don't like Indian men?

435
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,165
They're very boring,

436
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,457
I like a bit of danger in a man.

437
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,665
So then this place is
like a buffet for you,

438
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,999
and in any case since you've come
they're all just waiting for your cue.

439
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,332
Take your pick

440
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,665
I don't see anybody here,

441
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,874
somebody who'd walk
side by side with me,

442
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:41,249
who'd look into my eyes
and steal my heart.

443
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,790
Best of luck, Indian girl.

444
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,707
Raj...

445
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,540
You give up too easily

446
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,707
I wasn't even trying.

447
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:01,332
Why, you don't like me?

448
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,165
I like you, but at the moment
you're looking for something else.

449
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,915
When you get tired
you'll come back here.

450
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,457
And if I don't?

451
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:14,957
You'll come

452
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,207
because for someone
who'd walk by your side,

453
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,582
for someone who'd look into your eyes,

454
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,457
for someone who'd steal your heart,

455
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,874
there's no one else here.

456
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,707
Come on Meera, you've got to see this.

457
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:39,999
Love is all. Love is sweet.

458
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,415
Welcome to the world of love.

459
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,832
Love is all. Love is sweet.

460
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,999
Welcome to the world of love.

461
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:53,040
Come, look me in the eye.

462
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,499
My heart is on fire.

463
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:00,040
Come, just a little closer.

464
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,457
Welcome to the world of love.

465
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,457
Love is all.

466
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,790
Love is sweet.

467
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:13,082
Love is all. Love is sweet.

468
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,790
Welcome to the world of love.

469
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,165
Burning with love is bliss.

470
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:56,665
Let your breath mingle with mine.

471
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,082
Tonight is our night of love.

472
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:03,374
Tomorrow it belongs to another.

473
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,332
Let's toss the moon like a coin.

474
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,957
See what lands, your face or my life.

475
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,665
Love is all.

476
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,957
Love is sweet.

477
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,749
Love is all. Love is sweet.

478
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:23,415
Welcome to the world of love.

479
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,249
Come, look me in the eye.

480
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:29,540
My heart is on fire.

481
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:33,457
Come, just a little closer.

482
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:36,832
Welcome to the world of love.

483
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:39,165
Love is all.

484
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,665
Love is sweet.

485
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:15,040
Love is an unstoppable river.

486
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,665
Float on its waves and see.

487
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,915
Step lightly on a cloud.

488
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:28,207
Your feet will find no ground.

489
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,332
The heart is without borders.

490
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:35,082
No lines can divide it.

491
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,957
Love is all.

492
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,249
Love is sweet.

493
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,749
Love is all. Love is sweet.

494
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,415
Welcome to the world of love.

495
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,374
Come, look me in the eye.

496
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:54,790
My heart is on fire.

497
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,415
Come, just a little closer.

498
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,957
Welcome to the world of love.

499
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,665
Love is all.

500
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,957
Love is sweet.

501
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,874
Love is all.

502
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,707
Love is sweet.

503
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,499
I've had the best
time of my life, Samar,

504
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,707
thank you so much,

505
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:56,457
thank you, thank you, thank you.

506
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,790
You know you're
actually this bad ass girl,

507
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,124
how you were born into such a
fancy family, I can't understand.

508
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,249
If I'm that bad,
don't be friends with me.

509
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,332
Who wants to be friends?

510
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,582
Now that I have fallen for you,
what do I do about that?

511
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:18,915
I'm not joking,
I have really fallen in...

512
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,957
love.

513
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,082
It's this bad ass behaviour of yours,

514
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:30,915
hiding behind this
well behaved suave person,

515
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,165
that's trapped me.

516
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,165
Samar...

517
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:44,874
Yes, I know... you're getting
married to that English guy,

518
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,082
and now our contract is also
over so there's no reason to meet.

519
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,374
So no tension,

520
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:53,165
your train's come,
you go your way and I go mine,

521
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,540
the end.

522
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,790
This train terminates at Stanmore.

523
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,249
Meera...

524
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,332
If I kiss you...

525
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,874
will you slap me?

526
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:10,124
I don't think you will slap me.

527
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,040
You didn't slap me,

528
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,332
you didn't slap me.

529
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:05,332
O friends, do not call me Heer

530
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,207
I am Sahiban now.

531
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:16,625
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

532
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,124
and abduct me.

533
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,957
O friends, do not call me Heer

534
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,749
I am Sahiban now.

535
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:46,208
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

536
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,082
I am just like him. He's just like me.

537
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:13,082
His laughter is like
the morning sunlight.

538
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,040
Soothing darkness falls
when he closes his eyes

539
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,999
I am just like him. He's just like me.

540
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:25,040
His laughter is like
the morning sunlight.

541
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:29,874
Soothing darkness falls
when he closes his eyes

542
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:39,208
I am just like him. He's just like me.

543
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,999
O friends, do not call me Heer

544
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:49,040
I am Sahiban now.

545
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:57,458
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

546
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,790
and abduct me.

547
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:15,707
O friends, do not call me Heer

548
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:18,624
I am Sahiban now.

549
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:26,958
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

550
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,374
Good evening, Meera.

551
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,165
I'm famished.

552
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:55,999
You want to eat?

553
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,832
Chum va fa.

554
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:14,707
So, Miss Meera Thapar,
so you've also fallen in love.

555
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,415
You couldn't live without me
for more than two days, right?

556
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,790
Let's do the done done London deal

557
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,686
I am going to get married... to Roger,

558
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,624
because that's what my father wants.

559
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:34,999
He's always given me
everything I've ever wanted.

560
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,874
This is the first time
he's asked something of me,

561
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,665
I can't say no to him.

562
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:55,290
My mother left my father and
ran away with someone else,

563
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:00,999
I was twelve then.

564
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,665
My father has taken
care of me by himself.

565
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,790
He has always fulfilled my wishes,

566
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,915
we're the only family we have,

567
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,290
there's no one else...

568
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:28,790
I haven't told this to
anyone before now, not even Roger.

569
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:37,290
I'm telling you this
because you have to help me.

570
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,790
Both of us, have to make
a promise in front of Him,

571
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,957
that we'll remain just friends

572
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:07,874
and will never cross this line

573
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,915
and if we break this promise,

574
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,999
He can punish us in any way He chooses

575
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,707
I can't be friends with you, Meera,

576
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,790
but don't worry
I will never cross any line,

577
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:35,332
and for that I don't need to
make any kind of promise to God.

578
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:41,749
This isn't for you, Samar,

579
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:46,040
this is for me,

580
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:51,040
so that I don't make any mistake,

581
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,915
so that I may not grow weak,

582
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:00,957
so that I may not cross the line.

583
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:07,999
Please Samar,

584
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,999
for me.

585
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,874
Walk by my side
leaving a space between us.

586
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,790
Put your heart or hand there

587
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,999
I walk in the shade
cast by your shadow.

588
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,832
Walk by my side
leaving a space between us.

589
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:51,707
Put your heart or hand there

590
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:56,582
I walk in the shade
cast by your shadow

591
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:05,791
I am just like him. He's just like me.

592
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:12,749
O friends, do not call me Heer

593
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,707
I am Sahiban now.

594
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:21,582
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

595
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:24,624
and abduct me.

596
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,457
O friends, do not call me Heer

597
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,290
I am Sahiban now.

598
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:47,666
Let any Mirza come on a horse...

599
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,290
- Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning.

600
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,374
Here is a parcel for you.

601
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:14,874
My dearest Meera,

602
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:20,207
I read about your marriage in
a magazine and couldn't help myself.

603
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:23,040
It's been so many years
and not one day has gone by,

604
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,665
when I haven't thought of you,

605
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:31,624
but I promised your father
that I would never contact you.

606
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:34,165
For all your birthdays.

607
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,957
I'd buy a gift,

608
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,040
and write a long
letter addressed to you

609
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,707
and then put them both
away in the cupboard,

610
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,624
but this time I couldn't stop myself.

611
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,165
Every mother has a dream

612
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,082
to dress her daughter in
her wedding sari herself,

613
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:50,832
but I know that...

614
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:53,790
I lost this right many years ago.

615
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,082
The wedding sari that I wore
and came to your father's house,

616
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:01,790
I've kept very carefully for this day.

617
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:04,832
If you think it is okay, wear it,

618
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:08,665
I will feel like I am also
a part of your wedding

619
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:12,415
I know that you hate me,

620
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:14,999
but I pray to God everyday,

621
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:19,207
hoping that one day you'll forgive me.

622
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,165
Lots and lots of love

623
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,374
and lots of happiness,

624
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,082
your mother, Pooja.

625
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,165
Punjab, as English say,

626
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,290
Bob Dylan was from there,

627
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:37,540
Babbar Singh Dhillon, Bob became Bub.

628
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,040
So now what do you want to do?

629
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,165
I don't know.

630
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,624
Meera doesn't know,

631
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,707
but Tina knows what to do.

632
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:17,332
Should we go?

633
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:09,999
What are you doing?

634
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,457
The same thing you're doing.

635
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,915
Aren't you taking it
a little too easy today?

636
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,457
These days you are so busy

637
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,415
I don't get a chance
to spend time with you.

638
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:23,665
Even with you so close to
me you're still not with me,

639
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,374
awaiting your return
I can't see the end of the day.

640
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:29,707
Stop this boring
poetry of yours, Imran.

641
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,374
- It's annoying.
- Okay.

642
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,415
Hey Miss P! Miss P!

643
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:36,332
Where is the fire, Henry?

644
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:38,707
Someone's waiting for you
at the porch, Miss P.

645
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:39,665
For me?

646
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,665
I've no appointments today.

647
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,040
It's those people from the restaurant

648
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,165
I told them to come
and sample the wines.

649
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,999
So why are they asking for me?

650
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,290
Because they're very boring, like you

651
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:51,290
I told them I'm mostly out
and they should meet you.

652
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,624
It's not funny, Imran.

653
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:55,499
Listen

654
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,165
I love you

655
01:00:58,291 --> 01:00:59,249
I know.

656
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,332
What's so hehehe, kiddo,

657
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,457
you never said I love
you to a girl before?

658
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:58,138
My baby...

659
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,957
I was 19 years old,

660
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,624
when I married your
father and came from India.

661
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,124
Until then I had learnt,

662
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:42,874
that a girl goes from her
father's home to her husband's,

663
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,957
and that becomes her new life.

664
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,790
Your father was a very nice man,

665
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:51,624
but I could never love him,

666
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:55,374
and for a long time I didn't
feel like anything was missing.

667
01:02:55,458 --> 01:03:00,290
He was busy with his business and
I was busy bringing up my daughter,

668
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:02,165
and then one day

669
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:04,874
I met Imran...

670
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,624
and that's when...

671
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,707
you fell in love.

672
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:12,749
Yes, I fell in love.

673
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,665
You were four then
that's why I stopped myself...

674
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,915
but when you turned twelve

675
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:25,207
I gave up

676
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,790
and I went away with Imran.

677
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,999
By then I understood one thing,

678
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,832
if you aren't happy yourself,

679
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:38,999
you can never keep others happy...

680
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,540
never.

681
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:55,707
You know...

682
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,457
When I told Imran

683
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:01,290
I do not want another
child other than you,

684
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,874
he smiled and said that
we didn't need to get married,

685
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:10,415
that he didn't need a piece of
paper or the consent of a priest,

686
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,457
to be with me for life.

687
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:16,290
He's crazy... just like me,

688
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:19,665
that's probably why we can't
survive without each other.

689
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:32,957
For all these years
I've only hated you.

690
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,832
But the fault was also mine...

691
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,707
No...

692
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,124
it wasn't your fault.

693
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:47,665
A 12-year-old girl
could not understand this,

694
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:51,165
but a 21-year-old girl can,

695
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:53,665
that what you did...

696
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,332
was absolutely right

697
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,499
I missed you mama,

698
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,374
I missed you so much.

699
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,874
Oh, do you know,

700
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,639
since, childhood I've wished
someone would give me a doll like this?

701
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,207
Thank you, Pooja, thank you very much,

702
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,957
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

703
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,957
Should I take you for a bike ride?

704
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,332
Come on, let's go.

705
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,415
Thank you,

706
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:37,457
you've given mama so much love

707
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,624
I should actually thank you,

708
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:43,249
it's been many years,

709
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,499
that I've been clowning about,
to make up for your absence,

710
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,749
but now I can retire.

711
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:52,624
Now Pooja will never stop smiling.

712
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:56,749
Thank you for coming
my child, thank you.

713
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:00,665
Can I ask you one thing?

714
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:05,082
Mama told me you
waited eight years for her,

715
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,540
without any promises.

716
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,124
How were you so sure that...
you would be together one day?

717
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,999
Every love has its time.
That time was not ours,

718
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,207
but that doesn't mean it wasn't love

719
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,832
I had faith in my love.

720
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,207
If God can bow down
in the face of love,

721
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,624
how does time stand a chance?

722
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:31,290
It had to change,

723
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,082
thank you darling,

724
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:36,915
thank you.

725
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,749
- Cheers Imran.
- Bye

726
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,124
I love you

727
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:48,749
I know.

728
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,040
Coffee

729
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:23,915
I love you,

730
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,999
I love you Samar,

731
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:39,624
I love you.

732
01:07:47,708 --> 01:07:50,082
You're crossing the line, Meera

733
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:09,957
I love you.

734
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:58,833
As my breath mingles with yours

735
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,957
I can breathe again.

736
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:23,332
As my breath mingles with yours

737
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:26,040
I can breathe again.

738
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,874
The fragrance of your
body touches my soul.

739
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,915
If you come near.

740
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:40,790
How long can I control my senses?

741
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,332
Let them fly if they will.

742
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:52,582
When has the heart walked
the straight and narrow?

743
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:58,207
Let it wander if it will.

744
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:04,082
Lost in thoughts of you.

745
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,040
Solitude pleases me.

746
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:17,875
As my breath mingles with yours,
I can breathe again.

747
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:34,999
If the sweet night
is spent by your side.

748
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:40,499
The dawn will break with light and air.

749
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:46,790
Since my eyes caught sight of you.

750
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:52,624
They brim over with you alone.

751
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:58,374
Touch me again and tell me...

752
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:03,707
what did you wish for?

753
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:09,999
As my breath mingles with yours

754
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,999
I can breathe again.

755
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:27,624
The fragrance of your
body touches my soul.

756
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:30,665
If you come near

757
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:38,332
I can breathe again.

758
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:42,082
If you come near.

759
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:02,749
Wish Charlotte a happy
birthday for me, with a kiss

760
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:07,332
I am going to speak with papa today,
he'll agree, won't he?

761
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:09,207
He'll agree, if he doesn't, call me.

762
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:11,457
I'll convince him with a kiss.

763
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:15,040
I'm leaving now, or because
of your papa I'll loose my job.

764
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,040
Listen, what about mine...

765
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,124
Meera!!

766
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:26,957
I love you.

767
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:29,166
Samar!!

768
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:44,624
Madam!

769
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,457
Madam you cannot go through.

770
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:49,124
Just give me one minute... please,

771
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:50,124
just give me one minute...

772
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:51,832
just give me one minute...
you don't understand...

773
01:14:51,916 --> 01:14:53,415
You cannot come through here.

774
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,874
Stay here please.

775
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,290
Please, please, please...

776
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,707
please God!

777
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,790
Please, please, please...

778
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:08,749
please don't do this,

779
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:10,665
please let him be okay,

780
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,999
don't punish him for my mistake,

781
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:19,957
You keep him alive,

782
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:22,457
don't let anything
happen to him and I promise,

783
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:26,124
I promise I will never meet him,

784
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,457
please God! Let him be okay

785
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:34,957
I promise... I promise...

786
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:36,749
Please bring him back

787
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,665
and I promise You
I will never meet him again,

788
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:42,374
after this I will never meet him,
please, please, please, God

789
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,082
I will leave him forever.

790
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,207
Sir.

791
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:49,290
Please, bring him back...

792
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:52,624
Okay clear. Shock!

793
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,957
Shit ya, I still can't
get through Meera's phone.

794
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:43,207
For four days she hasn't called,
nor did she come to the hospital.

795
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,540
Do you think her
father's upset with her,

796
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,249
did you find out from her store?

797
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:50,249
Yes, the guard was saying that
she hasn't come there either,

798
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,874
I don't know what the scene is.

799
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,124
Son of a... learn to
make a simple cup of tea.

800
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:55,999
My friend, adjust for one more week,

801
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:57,915
after that neither
will I be here, nor my tea.

802
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,790
Why, you've got a job at
Buckingham Palace, as a guard?

803
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:03,040
No, ya, I am going back to Lahore.

804
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,624
Nothing is going to
happen for me in London.

805
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:08,040
Till when will I live off your
money and keep looking for a job?

806
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,832
And now Meera is also coming...

807
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:15,290
so I called my mother and
told her your son is useless...

808
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:16,624
he's coming back.

809
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,624
Oh deal with it, what to do?

810
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:23,915
Kapoor Uncle, come in,
think of it as your home,

811
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:25,665
oh shucks.

812
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,415
Meera!

813
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:31,832
Shucks...

814
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:38,749
I'll... get that tea, that sugar,

815
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:41,165
I'll get something. Hello Meera.

816
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

817
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,874
So papa didn't agree?

818
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:04,457
I didn't speak with him.

819
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:06,790
So what were you doing all these days?

820
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:11,749
I was praying.

821
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,790
To sir Jesus?

822
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:17,874
Was it fulfilled?

823
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:21,415
Of course,

824
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,124
What did you ask for?

825
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,249
Your life.

826
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:30,415
And in return, what did you give up?

827
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:32,957
You!

828
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:39,082
What do you mean?

829
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,707
I prayed that He,
by any means, keep you alive

830
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,665
and in return, the one thing
that is most precious to me,

831
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,082
I will leave that,

832
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,874
forever.

833
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:55,124
You've gone mad?

834
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,624
Samar, please,

835
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,832
it's been very difficult
for me to come here to you

836
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:02,374
I realize that you
think all this is rubbish,

837
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:03,957
you won't understand,

838
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,707
but this is my belief,

839
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:08,290
that you were punished for my faults,

840
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:13,290
that if I remain
with you, your life...

841
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,499
now no one can break this belief,

842
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:21,332
neither you nor God

843
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:25,165
I have come here only to tell you

844
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,999
that I am marrying Roger.

845
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,790
I've come to ask you for one thing...

846
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:38,165
that if possible, leave this city,
and go away somewhere far,

847
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,374
please...

848
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,415
for my sake.

849
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,665
You won't say anything?

850
01:21:05,541 --> 01:21:07,082
Congratulations...

851
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:13,082
Done, done London.

852
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:17,874
- Samar, I'm sorry...
- Don't...

853
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,082
Don't...

854
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:53,165
What's this?

855
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:06,457
Call your mother and tell her
that her son is not useless,

856
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:07,832
that he's not coming back

857
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:11,165
and also tell her that her
other son is going back to India.

858
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:13,249
Ask her to pray for him

859
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,749
I am leaving all my
money for you and going.

860
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:17,499
Now make something big out of it,

861
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,332
I'll come back one
day to take my share.

862
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,499
I'll really miss that tea of yours,

863
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:26,290
your friend, Samar, bye.

864
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,832
This isn't right,

865
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,374
it's all wrong,

866
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,082
completely wrong,

867
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:55,749
the war between you and me has begun.

868
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,582
You stole my love from me...

869
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:04,540
I'll steal her belief from You.

870
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,582
She believes if I am not with her

871
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,332
I will live...

872
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:16,374
So from now on,

873
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,499
I will embrace death every day,

874
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,207
let's see...

875
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,624
till how long You keep me alive.

876
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,415
Thank you...

877
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,415
Samar Anand.

878
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:05,249
If you're Samar that means,

879
01:25:05,916 --> 01:25:07,207
there's also a Meera.

880
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:12,499
Why didn't you go back?

881
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,582
Didn't you meet Meera ever again?

882
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:17,915
Look soldier, I shouldn't
actually involve myself in this,

883
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,874
but I am already involved now.

884
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:23,832
You don't know me,

885
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:25,374
I'm a hardcore, kinda girl

886
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:26,915
I never cry and all,

887
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:29,999
but your love story
made me fully sentimental.

888
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:34,165
Look, I'm this 21 year old,

889
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:35,832
from this instant make out,

890
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:37,957
instant breakup generation.

891
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:40,624
First we have sex and then
we think if it was love or not

892
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:46,082
with these fundamentals of
love there's solid confusion.

893
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:50,207
Soldier, all I want to know is,

894
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,499
is there such kind of love?

895
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:53,874
What I mean is,

896
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:57,707
if it's happened to you it
could happen to anybody,

897
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:00,332
maybe even me?

898
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:05,540
So tell me now,

899
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,415
was all this true or

900
01:26:07,916 --> 01:26:10,124
just a story you wrote to pass time?

901
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,707
What's your name?

902
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:14,082
Akira!

903
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,082
From Japan?

904
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:17,332
Delhi.

905
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:18,832
You're cool...

906
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:22,165
consider this a story and let it go

907
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:24,207
you'll remain cool...

908
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:35,999
Arjun...

909
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:39,082
do you love me?

910
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,415
Can you wait ten years for me?

911
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:46,540
No?

912
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,540
Then you don't stand a chance!
Put the phone down!

913
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:54,082
I give you this, soldier,

914
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,874
if it's love it better be this way!

915
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:12,374
At least let me make
a mock presentation,

916
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:15,165
you're not going to regret this,
please let me do it.

917
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,374
No! No! Akira, I can't allow it.

918
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:19,457
Please, Catherine,
it's the chance of a lifetime.

919
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:20,790
No! It's too dangerous,

920
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,749
you don't have enough experience,

921
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:23,957
so just forget it.

922
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:25,665
C'mon you lot, get a move on,

923
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:28,332
it's a wrap,
we've got a flight to catch.

924
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,582
Please, Catherine,
this is my dream since I was a kid...

925
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:34,665
to work for Discovery Channel...
travel,

926
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,665
make films, features...

927
01:27:36,916 --> 01:27:38,790
please let me do it.

928
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:41,582
Alright,

929
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,082
two weeks, that's it!

930
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:45,499
And you'll be on your own,

931
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,869
you'll have to do the camera
and the sound by yourself,

932
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:49,582
and I'm making no promises

933
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:50,915
I get the first look at the footage

934
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,457
and I get to decide
if it's good enough for the channel.

935
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:55,374
Thank you!

936
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:58,624
Get off me, you mad woman!

937
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:00,874
I'll speak to General Natarajan

938
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:05,207
London! Iraq!

939
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,082
Afghanistan!

940
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:09,624
Drug wars in Mexico!

941
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,249
The whole frigging world...

942
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:14,999
Here comes Akira!

943
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:22,832
General Natarajan called himself.

944
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,832
This documentary will
benefit the Indian Army a lot.

945
01:28:26,166 --> 01:28:30,415
You know how difficult it is to
recruit soldiers for the Bomb Squad.

946
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:33,707
So I felt that by hearing
about stories of your bravery,

947
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:34,915
by seeing you working,

948
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,874
these youngsters will be motivated

949
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:39,290
and want to become like you

950
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,624
and it's only a matter of two weeks,

951
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,249
I appreciate your support on this.

952
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,415
Sir.

953
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:09,999
Akira Rai, Discovery Channel,
reporting for duty, sir.

954
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,415
Is this stolen or for real?

955
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:14,582
It's a 100% authentic soldier,

956
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:18,332
now for two weeks,
wherever you go, I go.

957
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,790
How many more have
come to die with you?

958
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:25,040
Just me, One Woman Crew.

959
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:33,582
C'mon eat...

960
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,082
Hello, I'm Captain Kamal Singh

961
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:36,957
Singh!

962
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,582
And I'm Captain Jagdeep Dewan.

963
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:39,457
Dewan!

964
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,124
Lieutenant Hari Krishnan, madam.

965
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,999
You can stop this
formality of calling me madam,

966
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,082
I'm Akira, short and sweet Akira.

967
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,207
Hello, Akira!

968
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:48,415
Now that's perfect.

969
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:52,665
Now look, for the next two weeks
I am going to trouble you a lot,

970
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,332
so for speaking excessively,
for eating excessively,

971
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:55,656
and for abusing uncontrollably,

972
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,207
I ask you'll to forgive me now

973
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:58,749
I have one question,

974
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,415
I just hope that you
aren't as grumpy as your boss.

975
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,165
No, no, not at all,
we are very jolly guys.

976
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:07,040
Then I am afraid we are
going to have a lot of fun, guys.

977
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,790
By the way,
where do I dump this stuff?

978
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:11,124
I will show you, I will show you.

979
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,624
Make sure the distance is maintained,

980
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,124
Miss Akira Rai.

981
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:29,624
Akira Rai reporting for duty, sir.

982
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,499
This action-packed army
life is really exciting.

983
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:34,082
You will always remain
behind this barricade,

984
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:36,040
and 350 metres behind me.

985
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:40,124
If you break any rule you'll be
sent back to the barracks, any doubts?

986
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:44,957
Can I listen to music on my lpod?

987
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,582
Is that a yes or no?

988
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:00,332
Oh man

989
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:03,207
Daisy Chain...

990
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,290
Yes sir.

991
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,624
Safe to disable cap.

992
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:11,999
Yes sir, I've checked it

993
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,832
I think there might be
another switch Dewan.

994
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:21,999
Quite possible.

995
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:23,790
In sequence.

996
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:26,957
Cut cap.

997
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,665
Go in sequence.

998
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:30,832
Okay sir.

999
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:35,999
Where is this going?

1000
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,582
No idea sir.

1001
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:39,957
Let me check this.

1002
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,249
Lowering seat.

1003
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:55,332
Okay sir.

1004
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,874
There's a switch Dewan.

1005
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:07,207
Be careful sir.

1006
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:42,750
Akira!!

1007
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:20,207
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

1008
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:29,415
What did you think was
going on, some film shoot,

1009
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,457
or some kind of adventure trip,

1010
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:32,957
that you'll go home and
show off to your friends?

1011
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:35,415
We are dealing with bloody bombs here.

1012
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:38,457
Today, because of you, the lives
of my entire team was compromised.

1013
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,040
I'm sorry

1014
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:42,749
350 metres I said.

1015
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:47,290
Now you will not come with us,
you'll go back from here.

1016
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:51,415
No, soldier, I am not going back,
I am coming with you.

1017
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,415
The road ahead is dangerous,
you will not be able to manage.

1018
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,082
Soldier, this is my life's one
and only chance,

1019
01:33:55,166 --> 01:33:56,207
I'll cope with anything.

1020
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:57,165
Please, I am sorry.

1021
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,290
Akira!

1022
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:02,332
Look, you're an okay girl,
you're brave too,

1023
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:05,707
but this is not possible
for untrained girls or boys.

1024
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,124
Listen to me and... forget this story.

1025
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:13,082
If I asked you to forget Meera,
will you forget her?

1026
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:19,040
There is always this one passion,
that a person has

1027
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,040
for you it's Meera,

1028
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,082
for me my passion is your story,

1029
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:24,957
I'm not going!

1030
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:54,457
Sorry.

1031
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:03,374
Oh Krishnan! Where is sir going?

1032
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,165
Sir always goes for some
quiet time after defusing a bomb.

1033
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,332
Quiet!

1034
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:14,874
O Akira, never mess around
with a lion that's sleeping.

1035
01:35:15,166 --> 01:35:18,249
O Singhe, I haven't
come here to shoot birds,

1036
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:19,999
I've come here to shoot the Lion.

1037
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:22,040
And this Lion I will shoot for sure.

1038
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:23,290
- Dewan.
- Yes.

1039
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:25,499
Keep the chicken cooking,
I'll be back in a bit.

1040
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:41,916
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1041
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:48,040
Where is my home?

1042
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:51,290
He asks every passer-by.

1043
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:53,332
Wanders with a smile...

1044
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:55,415
and a tear.

1045
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,707
Wanders aimless from street to street.

1046
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:01,457
Belonging to all.

1047
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:03,457
Yet none to call my own.

1048
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:06,915
Wanders aimless from street to street.

1049
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:16,458
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1050
01:36:18,666 --> 01:36:22,457
Where is my home?

1051
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:25,332
He asks every passer-by.

1052
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:32,707
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1053
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,165
You play around with bombs in the day,

1054
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,915
and sing romantic songs by night.

1055
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,880
How is it possible not
to fall in love with you?

1056
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:46,915
You wait,

1057
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:50,582
in two weeks you will sing
Punjabi songs for Akira,

1058
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,415
this is my challenge,

1059
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,415
good night, sexy.

1060
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:25,125
What the...

1061
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:26,874
Sorry... ball.

1062
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,249
Afzal.

1063
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,332
Oh shucks, the camera broke.

1064
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:04,957
No ya, Akira, now this will not work,

1065
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,915
and we won't get these
parts even in Jammu,

1066
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,957
this can be fixed only in Delhi.

1067
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:14,415
I'm sorry, Akira I'm... I'm...

1068
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,624
Hey it's okay,
Krishnan, it's not your fault.

1069
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:17,874
After seeing my Messi like kick,

1070
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,624
anybody would have dropped the camera,

1071
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:23,624
and in any case where was
Discovery Channel going to take me?

1072
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:25,957
It was just a one-off chance
I was taking.

1073
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,415
Okay good night.

1074
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:37,749
Soldier,

1075
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:41,499
Akira's
entertainment was only till here,

1076
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,790
tomorrow morning it's about-turn,
back to Delhi,

1077
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:45,665
finally you get rid of me,

1078
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,082
at least now give me one sexy smile.

1079
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:52,082
Fine then, remain grumpy.

1080
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:55,415
Oye, Akira, at least eat your food.

1081
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,624
No ya, Singhe, I'm not hungry.

1082
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,290
Both of you'll eat.

1083
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:03,040
No sir.

1084
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:07,790
Fine don't eat.

1085
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:21,915
Akira! Smile...

1086
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,124
And now we have.

1087
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:26,624
Discovery Channel's Oscar-winning
film-maker miss Akira Rai,

1088
01:39:26,708 --> 01:39:27,915
a few words for your fans...

1089
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,082
Hey! How is it fixed?

1090
01:39:29,166 --> 01:39:32,207
Samar did it,
he's an electronics genius,

1091
01:39:32,291 --> 01:39:34,249
he worked all night on it.

1092
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:36,832
Where's that genius?

1093
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:48,332
Why are you so complicated?

1094
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:52,207
Neither can one fully
hate you nor love you.

1095
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:56,415
Actually I've understood now,

1096
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,999
after seeing me in my swimsuit,
you've changed your mind,

1097
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:01,874
now I've started
looking hot to you, right?

1098
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:06,749
Don't give me such
intense looks, soldier,

1099
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:09,499
it fills me with this
weird kind of sensation.

1100
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:12,457
Stop talking rubbish or
I'll break the camera again.

1101
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:16,665
First tell me... why did you
stay up all night and fix my camera?

1102
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:23,040
You spoke about passion.

1103
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:26,999
When someone is passionate
about something and doesn't get it,

1104
01:40:27,333 --> 01:40:30,165
he spends a lifetime
going mad chasing it.

1105
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:33,749
There's one mad man
standing in front of you,

1106
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:37,207
there is no place here
for another mad person,

1107
01:40:38,708 --> 01:40:44,457
so pick your camera,
fulfill your passion and leave.

1108
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:53,249
Try as hard as you can,
you won't save me from going mad.

1109
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:57,499
Towards me, more towards me.

1110
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:59,040
Nice, nice.

1111
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:01,957
A little bit, a little bit.

1112
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:03,915
Let me see the device.

1113
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:04,999
Yup.

1114
01:41:05,041 --> 01:41:06,207
Exactly!

1115
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:12,124
What's happened, Dewan?

1116
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:14,165
Sir, it's bang in
the centre of the bridge.

1117
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:15,082
Any timer?

1118
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:18,332
Yes, sir, and the wires go to
the dynamite through the relay.

1119
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:20,428
They're wrapped around
cans filled with Anfo.

1120
01:41:20,458 --> 01:41:21,332
Ya.

1121
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:24,582
Oye Kurusawa,

1122
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:28,415
come fulfill your passion.

1123
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:33,290
Wow great!

1124
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:41,749
You're not scared?

1125
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:45,040
I'm hanging here with
'The man who cannot die',

1126
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:47,082
literally!

1127
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,415
There's no chance of being scared,

1128
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:52,499
your destiny is working on
a strike rate of 100%, boss.

1129
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,040
In our line of work
destiny betrays you just once.

1130
01:41:56,583 --> 01:41:59,040
Don't worry, today's not that day,

1131
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:02,040
'cause I have no
plans of dying so quickly

1132
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:04,332
I have to make many more documentaries

1133
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:06,249
and show them in every
country in the world,

1134
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:09,249
I have to have sex with
guys with different accents.

1135
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:12,040
Did you grow up
reading the Kama Sutra?

1136
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:13,915
Is this all you think of?

1137
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,415
Soldier, at my age,
this is all we think of.

1138
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,082
When I grow older like you,
I'll start thinking of love,

1139
01:42:20,166 --> 01:42:24,415
being a good citizen,
the ways of God, okay?

1140
01:42:24,875 --> 01:42:25,957
Okay.

1141
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,082
By the way, soldier,

1142
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:34,415
do you plan on being in
love with Meera all your life,

1143
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,874
or is there a chance for
someone else in between?

1144
01:42:39,708 --> 01:42:42,665
There's a mind blowing offer,
do you want to hear it?

1145
01:42:43,666 --> 01:42:44,386
Is there a choice?

1146
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:45,124
No.

1147
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:46,665
Make me your girlfriend.

1148
01:42:48,416 --> 01:42:49,290
Why?

1149
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:53,290
I'm young... I'm entertaining...
I'm sexy,

1150
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,165
you've already checked my body out,

1151
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:57,707
actually I'm like a jackpot for you

1152
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:59,874
it's a limited offer... think about it.

1153
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,624
Soldier, soldier, listen...

1154
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:12,040
I never ask God for anything,

1155
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,540
so by making promises and all

1156
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:15,957
and leaving you is out of the question

1157
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:23,915
I made you laugh, you're mine now.

1158
01:43:56,833 --> 01:44:04,749
Away I go, carried on wings of passion.

1159
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:13,874
Drinking droplets of time.

1160
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:19,290
My heart has flown from its cage.

1161
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:23,124
Falling in love with myself.

1162
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,332
Embracing life with open arms.

1163
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:49,999
Away I go, carried on wings of passion.

1164
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:55,457
My heart has flown from its cage.

1165
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:59,874
Falling in love with myself.

1166
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:02,624
Embracing life with open arms.

1167
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:57,666
Clasping the moment in your
fingertips like a butterfly.

1168
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:06,708
As it takes wing it
leaves traces of colour.

1169
01:46:08,625 --> 01:46:16,625
The moment moves on,
leaving its colour behind, Akira

1170
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:25,415
I clasp another
moment as it takes flight.

1171
01:46:26,208 --> 01:46:28,624
Embracing life with open arms.

1172
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:52,207
Away I go,
carried on wings of passion.

1173
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:57,915
My heart has flown from its cage.

1174
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:02,040
Falling in love with myself.

1175
01:47:06,083 --> 01:47:08,582
Embracing life with open arms.

1176
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:37,040
So Major Samar Anand,

1177
01:47:37,791 --> 01:47:39,915
the last question of our trip,

1178
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:43,040
why haven't you worn
a bomb suit till now?

1179
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,332
Bomb suits are meant to
protect you from danger,

1180
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:54,457
to protect you from
getting hurt, or being wounded,

1181
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,999
but more than bombs
it's life, that hurts you,

1182
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:03,290
at every corner there's betrayal,
some pain...

1183
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:09,749
so if we don't wear bomb suits to
save us from the dangers of life,

1184
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:13,790
what's the point of
wearing it to save us from death?

1185
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:18,707
Every day, life kills us a little,

1186
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:22,124
a bomb will kill us just once.

1187
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:33,957
Okay soldier, that's a wrap,

1188
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:37,624
the end of my film and your torture.

1189
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,165
Are you checking me out?

1190
01:48:46,666 --> 01:48:49,457
I was thinking how
wrong I was about you.

1191
01:48:49,916 --> 01:48:52,665
I'd thought that you wouldn't
last more than two days with us,

1192
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:55,707
but you turned to be really tough boss.

1193
01:48:56,291 --> 01:48:58,957
Have you ever asked me
anything about myself?

1194
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:01,207
All you gave were intense angry looks.

1195
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,124
I'm a national level swimmer,
a state level tennis player,

1196
01:49:05,333 --> 01:49:07,457
I can run a kilometer in four minutes,

1197
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:08,790
I'm a deep sea diver,

1198
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:10,999
basically I'm Super Girl,
make me do anything.

1199
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:14,665
So, there's nothing that you can't do?

1200
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:17,499
There's one thing.

1201
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:19,707
What?

1202
01:49:20,833 --> 01:49:22,332
I couldn't make you fall for me.

1203
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:25,207
There, you've started again.

1204
01:49:27,041 --> 01:49:28,749
I'm in love with you, Samar.

1205
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:38,790
Totally, completely, madly,

1206
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,561
Akira has fallen flat in love with you.

1207
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,040
There's no need to say anything,

1208
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:54,540
I know you're not at all interested,
and it's... it's totally cool.

1209
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:58,374
Until now,
boys have always run after me,

1210
01:49:59,041 --> 01:50:00,957
I've never run after anybody,

1211
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,790
but you're this special piece, ya.

1212
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:11,165
In my generation
I'll never find a lover like you,

1213
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:14,124
and now that I've met you,

1214
01:50:14,708 --> 01:50:16,707
I can't love someone lesser than you,

1215
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:21,999
so basically, I'm screwed, boss.

1216
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:39,165
You deliver dialogues just like me,

1217
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:40,457
just...

1218
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:43,374
don't end up falling
in love like me...

1219
01:50:47,125 --> 01:50:51,540
because if your laughter, this mischief,
this abusive language, stops,

1220
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:56,957
this world will surely lose something.

1221
01:51:18,416 --> 01:51:21,082
Where do these come from?

1222
01:51:24,291 --> 01:51:25,082
Krishnan!

1223
01:51:25,166 --> 01:51:26,332
See you, Akira.

1224
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,082
Dewan!

1225
01:51:30,916 --> 01:51:32,082
Bye Singhe.

1226
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,249
Take care, Akira.

1227
01:51:43,375 --> 01:51:45,749
Don't worry, I'm not going to cry.

1228
01:51:45,833 --> 01:51:48,165
Ya ya, I know, you're super girl.

1229
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:49,540
That I am.

1230
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,499
Take care of yourself,

1231
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,665
don't die or anything like that

1232
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,040
ours is going to be
a deadly love story.

1233
01:51:59,291 --> 01:52:00,499
You're not going to change.

1234
01:52:01,708 --> 01:52:03,374
There's no chance

1235
01:52:07,958 --> 01:52:09,279
I don't want these friendly hugs,

1236
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:10,813
if you want to kiss me, then do that.

1237
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:30,499
This was a kiss?

1238
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:32,457
That's how the army's taught us.

1239
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:34,165
You wait,

1240
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:36,707
let me come back, and show
you how to kiss for real.

1241
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:37,665
Really?

1242
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:40,790
I'll see you...

1243
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,624
Come on, we have to
reach Baramullah in one hour

1244
01:52:58,916 --> 01:53:00,332
control your emotions

1245
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:03,290
otherwise the bomb
will be out of control.

1246
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:18,540
So if we don't wear bomb suits to
save us from the dangers of life,

1247
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:22,707
what's the point of
wearing it to save us from death?

1248
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:27,457
Every day, life kills us a little,

1249
01:53:28,666 --> 01:53:30,624
a bomb will kill us just once.

1250
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:51,874
You made the bitch cry!

1251
01:53:54,583 --> 01:53:55,790
I love it!

1252
01:53:56,291 --> 01:53:57,790
I'm going to make sure they run this.

1253
01:54:00,541 --> 01:54:03,999
Get off me you stupid
girl before I change my mind.

1254
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:06,207
We are going to title it
'The Man Who Cannot Die'

1255
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:08,124
I want it to be the lead
for the September issue,

1256
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:09,832
so Akira, put him on a flight

1257
01:54:09,958 --> 01:54:11,457
and get him to London
as soon as possible,

1258
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:13,624
the big boys will want
to authenticate his story.

1259
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:15,040
Does he have to come here for that?

1260
01:54:15,083 --> 01:54:16,665
I mean, can't we just do this there?

1261
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,124
For a story done by a rookie,
no, just get him here.

1262
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:20,499
He won't come!

1263
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:22,540
Why the hell not?

1264
01:54:22,625 --> 01:54:24,957
He just won't.

1265
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:27,457
Listen girl, I don't run this company

1266
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:30,082
but I do know that if he
doesn't get his arse over here,

1267
01:54:30,166 --> 01:54:32,124
your story stays in the edit room,

1268
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:34,874
you've got 24 hours to get back to me.

1269
01:54:40,833 --> 01:54:42,124
In the name of God!

1270
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:47,165
Soldier, they've flipped
it after seeing your story,

1271
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:50,582
they want to make it the cover
story for the September issue

1272
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:53,082
and sign me for a starting
salary of 25 thousand quid

1273
01:54:53,166 --> 01:54:55,082
and a three-3 year contract.

1274
01:54:55,166 --> 01:54:57,165
Okay congratulations, super girl

1275
01:54:57,625 --> 01:54:59,540
you made me famous before I died.

1276
01:55:00,041 --> 01:55:01,374
But soldier...

1277
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:05,457
there's a small... problem.

1278
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:08,457
What problem can you have?

1279
01:55:08,916 --> 01:55:12,457
The problem is that this story,
this contract,

1280
01:55:12,875 --> 01:55:17,957
all this, will happen only
if you come to London.

1281
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,874
This is my first story and I'm new,

1282
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:27,874
so it's their system
it can't be changed.

1283
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,790
It's only for one day, soldier,

1284
01:55:30,875 --> 01:55:33,076
in twenty-four hours you'll
be back in India, I promise

1285
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:39,749
I know it's not easy for you,

1286
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:41,832
but my life is at stake here,

1287
01:55:42,166 --> 01:55:45,249
my career will get at
least a 5 year kick start,

1288
01:55:45,958 --> 01:55:48,415
please soldier, for me!

1289
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:53,249
I can't come!

1290
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:56,499
Sorry Akira!

1291
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:58,707
It's okay.

1292
01:56:09,291 --> 01:56:10,957
What an arsehole!

1293
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,165
He's not an arsehole, John.

1294
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:14,957
So what's his problem then?

1295
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:20,665
He's just... messed up,
it's a long story.

1296
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:22,457
Are you heading back?

1297
01:56:23,458 --> 01:56:25,207
Ya, I mean,

1298
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:27,665
it's been a week since Catherine's
been trying to convince the bosses,

1299
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:29,540
but... it's not working,

1300
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:32,624
so I guess I'm back to Delhi's belly.

1301
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:34,957
What an arsehole!

1302
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,207
Hello?

1303
01:56:41,291 --> 01:56:43,415
How many offices do these
Discovery Channel guys have?

1304
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,165
I am standing at a cross road,
I can't understand where to go.

1305
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,165
Where are you?

1306
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,207
I am standing somewhere near
the Discovery Channel office,

1307
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:50,665
all the buildings look the same.

1308
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:53,374
You, you wait right there, I'm coming.

1309
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,749
He... is... here!

1310
01:56:55,833 --> 01:56:57,707
I told you he is not an arsehole.

1311
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:31,332
Sorry.

1312
01:57:36,333 --> 01:57:38,499
Thank you soldier, thank you,

1313
01:57:38,583 --> 01:57:40,832
Thank you soldier,

1314
01:57:43,708 --> 01:57:46,499
it's a big deal that you've
come to London, I know this,

1315
01:57:47,416 --> 01:57:51,457
but that you've come here for me
is the biggest thing in my life.

1316
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:54,165
Don't get sentimental,
I haven't come for you,

1317
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:56,499
I've come to set you here,
permanently,

1318
01:57:56,708 --> 01:57:59,082
so that I'm free from you for forever.

1319
01:57:59,166 --> 01:58:01,624
No chance, soldier,

1320
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:04,999
so far this story has
been one-sided,

1321
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:08,124
now it looks like there's
going to be a twist in the story.

1322
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:09,332
Akira!!

1323
01:58:24,666 --> 01:58:25,874
Move, move.

1324
01:58:27,125 --> 01:58:31,040
Samar, Samar, can you hear me,

1325
01:58:31,125 --> 01:58:32,707
Samar... are you a doctor?

1326
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:35,165
Can someone please call a doctor?

1327
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,874
Can someone please call an ambulance?

1328
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,832
Samar, Samar, Samar,

1329
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:41,707
what do I do?

1330
01:58:42,625 --> 01:58:43,207
Samar!

1331
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:11,290
Excuse me, sorry he's asking for you.

1332
01:59:29,458 --> 01:59:30,124
Where's Meera?

1333
01:59:36,916 --> 01:59:38,290
It's okay, Samar.

1334
01:59:41,708 --> 01:59:44,040
Can you call Meera please...

1335
01:59:46,375 --> 01:59:48,957
the other nurse said she
is waiting outside for me...

1336
01:59:49,041 --> 01:59:52,165
Will you call her...
will you call her please.

1337
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,874
Nurse... will you please call Meera?

1338
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,124
You said she is waiting for me...
I... I need to see her now...

1339
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:00,332
Why aren't you going to him?

1340
02:00:00,416 --> 02:00:01,874
I need to see her.

1341
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,290
I'm not Meera!

1342
02:00:04,625 --> 02:00:05,624
What's wrong!

1343
02:00:05,708 --> 02:00:06,749
Why aren't you calling Meera?

1344
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:08,040
Go get Dr. Khan.

1345
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:10,124
Is she okay?

1346
02:00:10,208 --> 02:00:11,999
Has something happened to her?

1347
02:00:12,125 --> 02:00:13,540
Why aren't you saying something?

1348
02:00:13,625 --> 02:00:15,040
Please, I...

1349
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:17,749
Call Meera please

1350
02:00:17,833 --> 02:00:19,790
I need to see Meera.

1351
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:53,290
Good morning, Samar!

1352
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,082
I'm Dr. Zoya Ali Khan,

1353
02:00:56,166 --> 02:00:59,999
Last night I operated on you,
how are you feeling now?

1354
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:04,665
Full name?

1355
02:01:05,166 --> 02:01:06,624
Samar Anand.

1356
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:07,957
Age?

1357
02:01:08,125 --> 02:01:09,624
28 years.

1358
02:01:13,416 --> 02:01:15,874
What year are we in, Samar?

1359
02:01:17,208 --> 02:01:18,624
2002

1360
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:30,124
Has Samar been in an accident or
gone through serious trauma before this?

1361
02:01:31,416 --> 02:01:36,124
10 years ago there was an accident...
here in London...

1362
02:01:36,458 --> 02:01:40,165
after that he's come back
to London for the first time.

1363
02:01:40,541 --> 02:01:42,290
That explains it,

1364
02:01:43,625 --> 02:01:46,874
Samar is suffering
from retrograde amnesia

1365
02:01:46,958 --> 02:01:49,374
he has regressed ten years,

1366
02:01:49,708 --> 02:01:53,499
his memory, is stuck in the year 2002

1367
02:01:55,791 --> 02:01:57,499
the trauma of this accident has

1368
02:01:57,583 --> 02:02:01,040
regressed his memory to
the previous accident,

1369
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:04,165
he remembers everything up
until the previous accident,

1370
02:02:04,333 --> 02:02:07,124
but after that he remembers nothing.

1371
02:02:09,083 --> 02:02:12,207
But he'll... become okay, won't he?

1372
02:02:13,875 --> 02:02:16,249
In cases like these,
it's impossible to say,

1373
02:02:16,625 --> 02:02:21,040
some patients get their memory
back in a day and for some...

1374
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:21,874
never!

1375
02:02:26,875 --> 02:02:28,999
So... now?

1376
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:33,332
Firstly we will have to
bring in the people he knew

1377
02:02:33,541 --> 02:02:36,374
when he is with the people he trusts,

1378
02:02:36,458 --> 02:02:39,707
his shock and trauma will both lessen

1379
02:02:40,083 --> 02:02:42,457
and then we might be
able to bring him back.

1380
02:02:43,166 --> 02:02:46,707
These are some names,
addresses and numbers, Samar has given,

1381
02:02:46,791 --> 02:02:49,082
I don't know if these are still valid,

1382
02:02:49,666 --> 02:02:52,332
but if you find as many as possible,
it will help...

1383
02:02:52,416 --> 02:02:55,540
and yes,
the most important is this girl,

1384
02:02:55,625 --> 02:02:56,540
Meera!

1385
02:02:57,041 --> 02:02:59,374
Samar's been asking
for her, since yesterday.

1386
02:03:08,833 --> 02:03:10,249
Aye soldier,

1387
02:03:10,958 --> 02:03:14,582
why so much drama, just to forget me?

1388
02:03:18,541 --> 02:03:20,207
But now you listen,

1389
02:03:20,708 --> 02:03:22,290
do what you want,

1390
02:03:23,083 --> 02:03:25,749
Akira won't let you forget her.

1391
02:04:35,083 --> 02:04:37,957
Honey, honey look into the camera.

1392
02:04:39,708 --> 02:04:41,540
You look beautiful.

1393
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:44,665
Hi daddy.

1394
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:45,915
Hi...

1395
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,124
Meera!

1396
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:31,832
Yes!

1397
02:05:31,958 --> 02:05:34,499
I need to talk to you...

1398
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:37,915
I'm sorry I... can't seem to place you.

1399
02:05:38,083 --> 02:05:41,040
No... ya... we've never met...

1400
02:05:41,666 --> 02:05:43,999
I'm Akira...
I just need a few minutes.

1401
02:05:44,208 --> 02:05:46,249
You know I'm
extremely late for a meeting,

1402
02:05:46,333 --> 02:05:47,165
I'm really sorry,

1403
02:05:47,250 --> 02:05:49,707
but would you mind making an
appointment with my assistant...

1404
02:05:49,791 --> 02:05:51,499
I'm really sorry!

1405
02:05:53,416 --> 02:05:54,790
It's about Samar!

1406
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:11,332
I know how difficult
this is for you...

1407
02:06:13,041 --> 02:06:15,915
you have a family... a husband...

1408
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,165
a daughter...

1409
02:06:18,416 --> 02:06:21,332
but beside you,
there's no one else who can do this.

1410
02:06:22,625 --> 02:06:25,207
Samar keeps asking for you,

1411
02:06:26,083 --> 02:06:27,957
he only wants to see you.

1412
02:06:30,375 --> 02:06:33,040
The doctor feels
if he see's you just once,

1413
02:06:33,166 --> 02:06:37,540
meets you, he might be
able to hear the truth...

1414
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:40,790
just come once, Meera...

1415
02:06:41,833 --> 02:06:42,832
please...

1416
02:06:44,291 --> 02:06:45,332
for Samar...

1417
02:06:52,541 --> 02:06:55,790
Meera, you'll have to
handle Samar very carefully,

1418
02:06:55,958 --> 02:06:58,665
his mental state is very delicate,

1419
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:04,707
any kind of shock or bad news
could permanently damage his system

1420
02:07:04,916 --> 02:07:07,540
and then bringing him
back may be impossible

1421
02:07:08,416 --> 02:07:11,082
and Meera, just remember...

1422
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:16,707
you are the bridge that
joins Samar to the outside world.

1423
02:07:19,416 --> 02:07:20,415
Are you ready?

1424
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,165
Shall we do this?

1425
02:07:25,083 --> 02:07:26,040
Great!

1426
02:07:26,625 --> 02:07:28,707
I'll just check on him and call you.

1427
02:07:35,791 --> 02:07:37,082
Thank you!

1428
02:07:53,333 --> 02:07:59,249
Seeing you makes me feel.

1429
02:07:59,416 --> 02:08:05,249
A departed dream returns to me.

1430
02:08:08,541 --> 02:08:14,249
Passing through that
century-long night.

1431
02:08:14,416 --> 02:08:20,124
A burst of morning returns to me.

1432
02:08:20,583 --> 02:08:28,583
Keeping awake, crossing miles.

1433
02:08:32,833 --> 02:08:37,665
The dream held me by the hand.

1434
02:08:38,583 --> 02:08:44,707
Breath held for many years

1435
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:47,749
I can breathe again.

1436
02:08:56,708 --> 02:09:03,040
As my breath mingles with yours

1437
02:09:03,208 --> 02:09:05,790
I can breathe again.

1438
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:39,165
Samar, what's the last thing
you remember before the accident?

1439
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,040
Meera...

1440
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:47,707
Meera is dressed in
a sexy pink dress...

1441
02:09:48,125 --> 02:09:49,415
her hair is open...

1442
02:09:49,791 --> 02:09:53,457
she's smiling...
watching me do stunts on my bike,

1443
02:09:54,666 --> 02:09:57,790
and then suddenly a car
slams into me and then...

1444
02:09:58,666 --> 02:09:59,457
Black!

1445
02:10:00,166 --> 02:10:01,374
Full black!

1446
02:10:05,916 --> 02:10:11,832
Samar, the accident you are
talking about happened ten years ago

1447
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:16,415
and we're not in 2002,
we are in the year 2012.

1448
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:20,124
What!

1449
02:10:22,875 --> 02:10:25,165
Meera... this?

1450
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:26,290
Samar!

1451
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:28,665
Just listen to her.

1452
02:10:28,875 --> 02:10:30,082
Let me explain,

1453
02:10:30,166 --> 02:10:34,165
Samar because of the head
injury you have amnesia,

1454
02:10:34,416 --> 02:10:36,040
Retrograde amnesia

1455
02:10:36,333 --> 02:10:38,749
and it is very
common with head injuries

1456
02:10:39,041 --> 02:10:40,999
so please don't worry,

1457
02:10:41,250 --> 02:10:43,915
with time you will
remember everything,

1458
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,165
and you will become absolutely okay

1459
02:10:47,041 --> 02:10:50,665
I know you have a lot of questions
that you want answers for.

1460
02:10:51,625 --> 02:10:53,082
Meera is with you

1461
02:10:53,166 --> 02:10:57,915
and whenever you need me
I'm right outside, okay?

1462
02:11:01,166 --> 02:11:02,540
I'll see you

1463
02:11:12,208 --> 02:11:14,499
I don't understand, Meera...

1464
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:17,040
10 years...

1465
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,540
10 years!!

1466
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,665
Samar It's ok...

1467
02:11:24,625 --> 02:11:25,790
its ok...

1468
02:11:28,583 --> 02:11:30,957
We've been together for 10 years?

1469
02:11:38,916 --> 02:11:41,290
How long have we been married?

1470
02:11:47,125 --> 02:11:48,582
Five years

1471
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:55,499
I want to remember everything...

1472
02:11:56,958 --> 02:11:59,249
everyday, every second
I've spent with you...

1473
02:11:59,333 --> 02:12:01,207
I want to remember everything...

1474
02:12:01,875 --> 02:12:04,999
I... I want to remember everything...

1475
02:12:16,208 --> 02:12:19,124
No, ya Meera, no more...

1476
02:12:20,250 --> 02:12:22,040
you've already done so much and

1477
02:12:22,208 --> 02:12:24,040
to ask you for more of your time,

1478
02:12:24,083 --> 02:12:25,457
to do all this drama

1479
02:12:26,708 --> 02:12:28,082
I don't feel right

1480
02:12:29,250 --> 02:12:32,290
you have a family, a husband,
a daughter.

1481
02:12:32,375 --> 02:12:33,582
Akira...

1482
02:12:36,416 --> 02:12:37,749
I'm not married.

1483
02:12:43,625 --> 02:12:45,624
And nor do I have any daughter...

1484
02:12:52,625 --> 02:12:54,915
I made a promise to leave Samar,

1485
02:12:56,791 --> 02:12:58,540
not to get married...

1486
02:13:01,291 --> 02:13:05,249
Roger is an old friend and
has always remained a friend.

1487
02:13:06,375 --> 02:13:07,290
He is divorced so...

1488
02:13:07,375 --> 02:13:10,249
every year I help him
arrange his daughter's birthday

1489
02:13:13,333 --> 02:13:15,957
I can't bear to see Samar like this,

1490
02:13:17,791 --> 02:13:20,749
and I want to do whatever I can,

1491
02:13:23,458 --> 02:13:25,832
but before that, it was
necessary for me to tell you this

1492
02:13:29,958 --> 02:13:31,540
I love Samar, Akira,

1493
02:13:34,166 --> 02:13:37,249
always have, always will,

1494
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:42,832
but I can never be his.

1495
02:13:46,041 --> 02:13:48,040
Now after knowing all this,

1496
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:50,207
what needs to be done...

1497
02:13:51,708 --> 02:13:53,040
is up to you.

1498
02:14:00,250 --> 02:14:02,040
Samar was right,

1499
02:14:02,625 --> 02:14:06,457
I should have left his love story as
just a story and forgotten about it

1500
02:14:06,708 --> 02:14:09,249
I was cool...
I would've remained cool,

1501
02:14:09,666 --> 02:14:14,249
but I got trapped in his love
so much, now I can't let it go.

1502
02:14:20,791 --> 02:14:26,374
Come... let's get him back
and then beat him up together,

1503
02:14:35,541 --> 02:14:37,957
A nice bottle of Chilean Red?

1504
02:14:38,583 --> 02:14:40,207
Definitely, ya sure...

1505
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,790
Is everything alright sir?

1506
02:14:42,916 --> 02:14:43,876
Yes very well thank you.

1507
02:14:43,916 --> 02:14:44,957
Okay,

1508
02:14:46,708 --> 02:14:47,499
All okay ma'am?

1509
02:14:47,583 --> 02:14:48,999
Thank you

1510
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:53,040
Maria, Mrs. Smith has
been waiting for 45 minutes.

1511
02:14:53,083 --> 02:14:55,124
If she's asked for
Maria's special of the day

1512
02:14:55,208 --> 02:14:57,374
then she will have to
wait for it to be special,

1513
02:14:57,458 --> 02:14:58,790
now leave me alone.

1514
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,249
Superb, here's getting
married to a white...

1515
02:15:05,833 --> 02:15:07,040
Meera...

1516
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:28,624
Zain, if you can't do
this feel free to say so,

1517
02:15:28,958 --> 02:15:31,332
we realize that we're probably asking
for a bit too much.

1518
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,457
Too much?

1519
02:15:33,250 --> 02:15:35,957
No, Akira,
you're asking for too little.

1520
02:15:36,083 --> 02:15:39,832
This restaurant,
my house all of it is Samar's

1521
02:15:40,041 --> 02:15:42,499
I started all this with
the money that he gave me,

1522
02:15:42,833 --> 02:15:46,124
otherwise how would this
Lahori have done all this?

1523
02:15:47,791 --> 02:15:51,207
He told me that he'd come
one day to take his share

1524
02:15:52,208 --> 02:15:53,790
but not like this...

1525
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:00,165
You'll don't worry,

1526
02:16:00,375 --> 02:16:03,915
Maria and I will shift
into our old Wembley flat.

1527
02:16:04,166 --> 02:16:06,915
The restaurant, the house
is all Samar's from now,

1528
02:16:07,166 --> 02:16:09,665
just tell me when are you bringing him.

1529
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:10,749
Tomorrow...

1530
02:16:11,625 --> 02:16:16,082
So as Samar used to say,
done, done, London...

1531
02:16:17,791 --> 02:16:18,957
Done, done, London...

1532
02:16:19,416 --> 02:16:20,624
Thank you, Zain.

1533
02:16:20,875 --> 02:16:22,332
Oh never mind.

1534
02:16:37,125 --> 02:16:38,707
What are you looking at?

1535
02:16:39,625 --> 02:16:40,499
London...

1536
02:16:41,083 --> 02:16:44,499
we're growing older but
this city is getting younger.

1537
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:48,749
What were you saying...

1538
02:16:48,833 --> 02:16:50,540
we have our own restaurant?

1539
02:16:50,791 --> 02:16:52,832
Yes, sir! Samar's Kitchen,

1540
02:16:53,041 --> 02:16:56,457
it's amongst the top
10 restaurants in London.

1541
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:58,870
I'd never imagined, that
we'd have our own restaurant,

1542
02:16:58,958 --> 02:17:00,540
a bungalow, a car...

1543
02:17:01,458 --> 02:17:04,082
Accidently God's been too kind.
I think

1544
02:17:04,458 --> 02:17:06,290
that's why He's making things even now.

1545
02:17:06,375 --> 02:17:09,249
Oye, He is letting you
rest for a while, nothing else.

1546
02:17:09,416 --> 02:17:11,832
Don't get too emotional or
we'll meet with another accident.

1547
02:17:13,375 --> 02:17:15,374
Everything else I can understand.

1548
02:17:15,541 --> 02:17:17,499
One thing I can't understand,

1549
02:17:18,625 --> 02:17:20,415
is how did you hook Maria?

1550
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:27,124
PPK... Pakistani Pathan's charisma.

1551
02:17:27,541 --> 02:17:30,499
So now Lahore's famous because of you.

1552
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:43,040
Here you go, we've come home.

1553
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:02,999
Meera, here, take care
of your prized possession,

1554
02:18:03,125 --> 02:18:06,124
I will come with Maria tomorrow... bye.

1555
02:18:31,625 --> 02:18:33,499
Now you've left Sir Jesus

1556
02:18:33,916 --> 02:18:35,707
and you're making
deals with Shree Krishna...

1557
02:18:35,791 --> 02:18:37,249
So what should I do,

1558
02:18:37,833 --> 02:18:40,499
if you meet with one
accident after another?

1559
02:18:40,708 --> 02:18:43,915
I'll have to, keep all the Gods happy.

1560
02:18:46,416 --> 02:18:49,540
No more accident's, I promise okay.

1561
02:18:52,541 --> 02:18:55,832
Come, my wife, show me my home.

1562
02:18:56,041 --> 02:18:58,707
We live alone in such a big house,

1563
02:18:58,791 --> 02:19:00,624
or is there someone else on rent here?

1564
02:19:02,166 --> 02:19:03,499
Did we win a lottery?

1565
02:19:32,208 --> 02:19:34,124
How is sir Jesus doing?

1566
02:19:35,041 --> 02:19:37,124
How are the deals coming along?

1567
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:40,957
I've stopped making deals and vows.

1568
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:44,082
Now I don't ask for
anything of anybody.

1569
02:19:44,166 --> 02:19:47,040
Wow, how did this happen?

1570
02:19:49,875 --> 02:19:51,415
I got you,

1571
02:19:53,083 --> 02:19:55,415
so there is no need to
ask for anything else.

1572
02:20:05,666 --> 02:20:07,249
You love me that much?

1573
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,040
What?

1574
02:20:19,916 --> 02:20:23,457
Doctor Khan has said,
for a couple of days no...

1575
02:20:30,791 --> 02:20:31,749
Oh man.

1576
02:20:32,166 --> 02:20:33,665
But I've got injured on my head,

1577
02:20:33,916 --> 02:20:37,249
and Dr Khan is a neurologist,
not a sexologist

1578
02:20:38,541 --> 02:20:40,124
I think she's a lesbian...

1579
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:10,582
Meera!

1580
02:21:13,375 --> 02:21:14,499
Come here.

1581
02:21:30,083 --> 02:21:34,457
Have you become more
beautiful than before?

1582
02:21:41,708 --> 02:21:47,040
Why does it feel like
I am meeting you after so many years?

1583
02:21:48,125 --> 02:21:50,290
Touching you after so many years.

1584
02:21:55,291 --> 02:21:57,624
No, no, no, stay here,

1585
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:01,582
just stay here.

1586
02:22:05,083 --> 02:22:08,082
Dr Khan's allowed
this much, hasn't she?

1587
02:23:37,458 --> 02:23:38,624
Dr Khan...

1588
02:23:38,916 --> 02:23:42,124
Dr Khan has become Changez Khan,

1589
02:23:42,291 --> 02:23:43,832
give me her telephone number,

1590
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,499
being a woman,
she doesn't have the heart of a mother

1591
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:04,124
I can't do this any more.

1592
02:24:08,041 --> 02:24:08,999
Please, Meera...

1593
02:24:09,916 --> 02:24:11,749
just a few more days...

1594
02:24:12,541 --> 02:24:15,624
Dr Khan is saying that
Samar is recovering very well,

1595
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,499
his mental condition is very stable

1596
02:24:18,958 --> 02:24:22,082
and that very soon
something may trigger his memory

1597
02:24:22,166 --> 02:24:24,165
I can't go on, Akira,

1598
02:24:27,875 --> 02:24:29,540
doctor, please you...

1599
02:24:31,250 --> 02:24:32,624
I understand...

1600
02:24:33,083 --> 02:24:34,082
I do.

1601
02:24:38,416 --> 02:24:42,290
Ideally I wanted to take
this step after two weeks...

1602
02:24:42,625 --> 02:24:44,707
but maybe this is the right time...

1603
02:24:45,416 --> 02:24:48,165
Akira, you will meet Samar,

1604
02:24:48,791 --> 02:24:52,999
maybe seeing you will
trigger his memory immediately.

1605
02:24:53,125 --> 02:24:55,499
Yes, this is slightly risky

1606
02:24:55,958 --> 02:24:58,624
but at this point it
is our best chance

1607
02:24:59,041 --> 02:25:03,540
I think it's time...
for Major Samar Anand... to meet Akira!

1608
02:25:06,625 --> 02:25:08,582
Zain, I don't want
to do this interview,

1609
02:25:08,666 --> 02:25:09,707
you're unnecessarily forcing me.

1610
02:25:09,791 --> 02:25:11,832
Samar, it's not just any interview,

1611
02:25:11,916 --> 02:25:13,707
these are the Discovery Channel guys,

1612
02:25:13,791 --> 02:25:17,207
they're covering the success
story of 10 Indians in London,

1613
02:25:17,291 --> 02:25:20,707
imagine how good marketing
it is for our restaurant.

1614
02:25:20,791 --> 02:25:21,832
What marketing!

1615
02:25:21,916 --> 02:25:23,076
Instead make me wear a bikini

1616
02:25:23,125 --> 02:25:24,499
and put its photo
outside the restaurant?

1617
02:25:24,583 --> 02:25:25,999
Hey, that is also a good idea.

1618
02:25:26,041 --> 02:25:28,290
You're excited uh Pathan, PPK.

1619
02:25:28,416 --> 02:25:30,040
Hey that's my Bluetooth.

1620
02:25:37,083 --> 02:25:38,582
Here, we've come.

1621
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,415
Why have you stopped here?

1622
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:41,790
The channel guys want to start off,

1623
02:25:41,875 --> 02:25:43,707
from the first place
you worked in London.

1624
02:25:43,791 --> 02:25:46,290
Now go quickly, theirjournalist
is waiting at the entrance for you,

1625
02:25:46,375 --> 02:25:48,832
and I have to go to
the restaurant, okay.

1626
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,124
Bye.

1627
02:25:53,041 --> 02:25:54,540
For one who can't remember anything,

1628
02:25:54,666 --> 02:25:56,290
what interview will she take of his.

1629
02:26:56,583 --> 02:26:58,040
Samar Anand!

1630
02:27:00,791 --> 02:27:04,082
Hi, I'm Akira Rai, Discovery Channel.

1631
02:27:05,916 --> 02:27:07,790
Have... have we met before?

1632
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,874
No! I don't think so.

1633
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,999
I'm sorry, my memory
is on a long break

1634
02:27:15,041 --> 02:27:18,207
so these days every
face looks familiar to me.

1635
02:27:18,458 --> 02:27:19,457
It's okay, Samar,

1636
02:27:19,708 --> 02:27:21,582
I know about your condition

1637
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:23,582
don't worry, I won't trouble you much.

1638
02:27:23,666 --> 02:27:24,915
No, no, no, please trouble me,

1639
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,374
maybe that might help
trigger some lost memory.

1640
02:27:29,833 --> 02:27:32,832
Okay then, get ready for the trouble.

1641
02:27:32,916 --> 02:27:34,207
Make up okay?

1642
02:27:36,416 --> 02:27:37,290
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1643
02:27:37,708 --> 02:27:38,582
Let's go?

1644
02:27:39,958 --> 02:27:40,790
Over here,

1645
02:27:41,041 --> 02:27:42,957
I use to clean snow,

1646
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,874
for 4 pounds per hour for Jack sir...

1647
02:27:48,291 --> 02:27:51,415
this is a very special place
for me Akira... right?

1648
02:27:52,208 --> 02:27:54,457
Not because this was my first job,

1649
02:27:54,666 --> 02:27:57,624
but because this is
where I saw Meera for the first time...

1650
02:27:58,916 --> 02:27:59,999
right there.

1651
02:28:01,291 --> 02:28:02,999
In the middle of white snow,

1652
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:05,665
like a fairy dressed in red,
glide across the snow.

1653
02:28:06,208 --> 02:28:08,124
It took one second and
I fell flat for her...

1654
02:28:08,958 --> 02:28:11,457
you haven't seen my wife, hmm?

1655
02:28:12,750 --> 02:28:15,082
She's the world's
most beautiful woman,

1656
02:28:15,583 --> 02:28:18,457
I have no idea
how she fell for a clown like me.

1657
02:28:25,875 --> 02:28:29,207
Oh wow, this is my favourite bike,

1658
02:28:29,666 --> 02:28:33,040
I had this, I bought it
second-hand from a friend.

1659
02:28:34,208 --> 02:28:36,165
May I ride it, please?

1660
02:28:38,291 --> 02:28:39,624
Thank You,

1661
02:28:42,208 --> 02:28:43,290
you're also coming?

1662
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,540
Come on

1663
02:29:11,125 --> 02:29:14,749
I was a manager in this restaurant,
this whole restaurant.

1664
02:29:19,625 --> 02:29:20,540
Samar!

1665
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:21,999
How are you?

1666
02:29:22,083 --> 02:29:24,249
This is Akira,
Amit I found work in Bollywood.

1667
02:29:24,375 --> 02:29:24,999
- Really!
- Ya.

1668
02:29:25,041 --> 02:29:25,749
No!

1669
02:29:31,208 --> 02:29:32,040
Thank you.

1670
02:29:32,125 --> 02:29:35,374
If it wasn't for Frank sir, I would
probably have gone back to Punjab

1671
02:29:35,458 --> 02:29:38,957
and join the army like
my father and forefathers

1672
02:29:41,041 --> 02:29:45,499
I never told my mother but
bombs and guns really scare me

1673
02:29:45,875 --> 02:29:47,499
Frank Sir, he saved me,

1674
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,457
thank you, Frank sir.

1675
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,874
Samar was my favourite...

1676
02:29:52,416 --> 02:29:54,457
he could charm anyone...

1677
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:57,374
Salmon, my favourite.

1678
02:29:57,458 --> 02:29:58,457
Enjoy.

1679
02:29:58,708 --> 02:30:02,207
He just enjoyed making people happy.

1680
02:30:09,666 --> 02:30:11,790
Okay Akira, I worked double shift here.

1681
02:30:11,875 --> 02:30:12,749
These are my friends,

1682
02:30:12,833 --> 02:30:14,415
- Hi guys.
- Hi
- Hello.

1683
02:30:14,583 --> 02:30:16,499
This is Gabbar, this is Sambha,

1684
02:30:16,583 --> 02:30:17,415
this is me...

1685
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:18,832
and this is Basanti!

1686
02:30:19,916 --> 02:30:21,415
What is wrong with you?

1687
02:30:32,041 --> 02:30:36,040
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1688
02:30:36,375 --> 02:30:40,040
Where is my home?

1689
02:30:40,416 --> 02:30:43,249
He asks every passer-by.

1690
02:30:43,708 --> 02:30:45,665
Wanders with a smile...

1691
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:47,707
and a tear.

1692
02:30:47,791 --> 02:30:51,040
Wanders aimless from street to street.

1693
02:30:51,833 --> 02:30:53,374
Belonging to all

1694
02:30:53,458 --> 02:30:55,457
I wrote this song for Meera...

1695
02:30:55,875 --> 02:30:56,957
and see my fate...

1696
02:30:57,125 --> 02:30:58,124
it was an evening just like this,

1697
02:30:58,208 --> 02:31:00,457
I was singing...
and when I opened my eyes.

1698
02:31:00,541 --> 02:31:02,415
Meera was standing in front of me.

1699
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,957
For who my heart sung this song,

1700
02:31:05,541 --> 02:31:07,290
it reached out and found her heart.

1701
02:31:09,416 --> 02:31:11,999
Isn't it a made-for-each-other
love story?

1702
02:31:12,125 --> 02:31:13,374
Come on guys.

1703
02:31:13,833 --> 02:31:15,915
O dude cool good to see you.

1704
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,040
A note for you.

1705
02:31:19,125 --> 02:31:27,125
What does this crazy wanderer seek?

1706
02:32:06,208 --> 02:32:08,499
Today I met Samar Anand,

1707
02:32:09,750 --> 02:32:12,499
a man who I had never met before,

1708
02:32:13,916 --> 02:32:16,582
the Samar that
I know is like... a ghost,

1709
02:32:16,708 --> 02:32:17,790
a shadow,

1710
02:32:18,083 --> 02:32:19,457
that's not alive.

1711
02:32:21,875 --> 02:32:24,249
Samar lives only to love you,

1712
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:28,415
without you there's
no breath in his life.

1713
02:32:32,708 --> 02:32:33,540
You know!

1714
02:32:34,208 --> 02:32:35,999
I was thinking the whole day

1715
02:32:36,125 --> 02:32:38,290
that if we were in his
life together the same time,

1716
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:39,582
what would happen,

1717
02:32:40,041 --> 02:32:43,249
and even in my dreams,
I was miles behind you.

1718
02:32:46,416 --> 02:32:47,957
You don't know me,

1719
02:32:48,583 --> 02:32:51,540
I've been a topper all my life,

1720
02:32:52,958 --> 02:32:55,415
an honour student,
a gold medalist in every sport...

1721
02:32:56,541 --> 02:32:58,582
I dump my boyfriends
every three months,

1722
02:32:58,666 --> 02:33:00,749
before they leave me,

1723
02:33:02,041 --> 02:33:03,999
because I can't handle rejection.

1724
02:33:07,125 --> 02:33:11,582
So now before Samar recovers and
lectures me on friendship and all,

1725
02:33:12,166 --> 02:33:14,415
I am getting out of this love...

1726
02:33:15,208 --> 02:33:18,832
it'll take time but then I'll be okay,

1727
02:33:21,875 --> 02:33:24,707
So I've come to tell you that,

1728
02:33:25,208 --> 02:33:27,749
if it's because of me that
you're stopping yourself,

1729
02:33:28,250 --> 02:33:29,499
then you're wasting time,

1730
02:33:31,083 --> 02:33:33,749
because I've never
existed in Samar's love story.

1731
02:33:35,125 --> 02:33:39,624
His love story's always had Meera
and will only have Meera in it

1732
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,749
I wasn't stopping
myself because of you, Akira.

1733
02:33:48,875 --> 02:33:51,165
It is because of Samar
I'm stopping myself.

1734
02:33:52,750 --> 02:33:57,207
Everyday I want to break my promise
and fall into his arms,

1735
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:00,915
but what if something happens to him?

1736
02:34:02,625 --> 02:34:05,790
It is this if that scares
me and why I stop myself.

1737
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,749
Everyday I pray for his life

1738
02:34:13,625 --> 02:34:15,874
and every day I die a little.

1739
02:34:19,458 --> 02:34:22,999
Now this... God,
prayers, promises and all,

1740
02:34:23,166 --> 02:34:25,207
I don't understand...

1741
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,499
I really don't pray much...

1742
02:34:28,958 --> 02:34:31,624
but before going there's
one tip I'm giving you...

1743
02:34:33,666 --> 02:34:37,040
You left him so that he stays alive,

1744
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:42,165
but now if you're not with
him he is as good as dead

1745
02:34:43,416 --> 02:34:45,832
maybe your God's trying to tell you,

1746
02:34:46,083 --> 02:34:48,624
Hey Meera, enough is enough,

1747
02:34:49,208 --> 02:34:52,040
now go and live a little.

1748
02:34:57,375 --> 02:34:58,665
See you.

1749
02:35:18,625 --> 02:35:19,457
Ya, Zain.

1750
02:35:19,541 --> 02:35:20,874
Samar, our new restaurant's site

1751
02:35:20,958 --> 02:35:22,749
is in front of
Marble Arch Station, okay?

1752
02:35:22,833 --> 02:35:25,915
Okay, you get there,
I'll catch the train and come.

1753
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,207
Okay come quick.

1754
02:35:31,916 --> 02:35:35,082
Ladies and gents we need to
evacuate this station come this way,

1755
02:35:35,166 --> 02:35:37,915
Everybody come on this way
start moving up this way.

1756
02:35:38,916 --> 02:35:41,790
Everybody up this way - Due to a
reported bomb aboard the train,

1757
02:35:42,125 --> 02:35:45,415
all passengers are requested to
leave the station immediately,

1758
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:47,415
by the nearest available exit.

1759
02:35:47,708 --> 02:35:50,582
Please obey the instructions of
the security personnel.

1760
02:36:12,125 --> 02:36:15,082
Due to a reported bomb... bomb... bomb.

1761
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,499
Three minutes copy.

1762
02:36:34,833 --> 02:36:35,915
Mister you can't be here,

1763
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,207
there's a bomb on board
you need to evacuate now.

1764
02:36:40,375 --> 02:36:42,040
Ten pounds symtex,

1765
02:36:43,083 --> 02:36:44,957
possibly with shrapnel,

1766
02:36:46,083 --> 02:36:47,874
not motion sensitive,

1767
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:49,707
remote detonator

1768
02:36:51,041 --> 02:36:52,207
Charlie...

1769
02:36:54,166 --> 02:36:56,726
this guy might just know what
he's talking about let him through.

1770
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,249
Tango Victor 191 control.

1771
02:38:09,375 --> 02:38:10,957
The bomb has now been defused,

1772
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,124
I repeat the bomb has now been defused.

1773
02:38:15,166 --> 02:38:16,207
Thank you so much.

1774
02:38:16,291 --> 02:38:17,624
What's your name Sir?

1775
02:38:19,125 --> 02:38:20,999
I'm Major Samar Anand!

1776
02:38:22,833 --> 02:38:23,957
Indian Army!

1777
02:38:24,833 --> 02:38:26,374
Bomb Disposal Squad.

1778
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:21,707
Samar,

1779
02:39:27,208 --> 02:39:28,749
what are you doing?

1780
02:39:29,916 --> 02:39:33,415
Why have you called me here?

1781
02:39:50,708 --> 02:39:52,957
For all the moments that
I have lost in the past,

1782
02:39:53,666 --> 02:39:56,457
today I have come to
steal back one moment,

1783
02:39:57,083 --> 02:40:01,540
today I'm going to,
once again, marry you.

1784
02:40:09,416 --> 02:40:11,249
Will you marry me, Meera?

1785
02:40:13,625 --> 02:40:16,207
Stop it, Samar,
we can't just get married like this.

1786
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:18,665
Why, why can't we?

1787
02:40:19,041 --> 02:40:20,790
You'd said this is how we got married,

1788
02:40:20,875 --> 02:40:23,749
no celebrations, just you and me...

1789
02:40:24,291 --> 02:40:26,999
so let's just do it again... for me.

1790
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:30,415
Come on, I'll start.

1791
02:40:31,125 --> 02:40:34,624
I'm sorry,
what I said last time or how

1792
02:40:34,708 --> 02:40:36,290
I don't remember,

1793
02:40:36,708 --> 02:40:39,832
but all I will say this time
is that I love Meera a lot

1794
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,249
and I promise that I will forever.

1795
02:40:43,375 --> 02:40:44,874
Stop it, Samar.

1796
02:40:46,166 --> 02:40:47,707
This is not a joke!

1797
02:40:49,958 --> 02:40:51,374
Wow, this is amazing,

1798
02:40:52,291 --> 02:40:54,582
you've made our marriage
a joke and lied about it

1799
02:40:56,500 --> 02:40:59,040
and I can't even play
a small little prank?

1800
02:41:12,083 --> 02:41:14,290
Memory is such a funny thing...

1801
02:41:15,083 --> 02:41:17,999
we spend a whole lifetime
trying to forget something

1802
02:41:18,166 --> 02:41:19,457
but we can't

1803
02:41:19,875 --> 02:41:22,082
and then if we try to
remember some thing small

1804
02:41:22,166 --> 02:41:23,665
we're unable to.

1805
02:41:24,666 --> 02:41:25,874
You know, Meera,

1806
02:41:26,041 --> 02:41:28,040
everyday in the army I use to think,

1807
02:41:28,541 --> 02:41:30,582
why is it that He keeps me alive?

1808
02:41:31,041 --> 02:41:33,040
Today I figured that out...

1809
02:41:33,625 --> 02:41:36,582
He wasn't fully satisfied
with what He had done to me.

1810
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:39,665
He first tears me away from your life,

1811
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:42,290
He says go... go live without her.

1812
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,624
So I go and everyday...

1813
02:41:44,708 --> 02:41:48,165
I live in the arms of
Death hoping to defeat God.

1814
02:41:48,625 --> 02:41:50,999
But out there also He kept winning,

1815
02:41:51,208 --> 02:41:53,540
He didn't let me die...

1816
02:41:54,958 --> 02:41:58,707
and then one day, like magic,
He brings you back into my life,

1817
02:41:58,791 --> 02:42:00,582
He brings back all my lost memories,

1818
02:42:00,666 --> 02:42:01,665
He makes me fly again

1819
02:42:01,750 --> 02:42:05,665
and then in a flash he slams me
back onto the ground.

1820
02:42:08,125 --> 02:42:10,790
He wakes me up from my
dreams and tells me,

1821
02:42:10,875 --> 02:42:15,290
your life is exactly how it is,

1822
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:20,374
Meera is still Mine,
she will never be yours,

1823
02:42:20,833 --> 02:42:22,790
because even till today,

1824
02:42:23,083 --> 02:42:24,457
the promise she made to Me,

1825
02:42:24,500 --> 02:42:26,832
is greater than the
promise she made to you,

1826
02:42:27,708 --> 02:42:30,707
there's this simple little
thing you don't seem to understand,

1827
02:42:32,791 --> 02:42:37,207
more than you, she's in love with Me.

1828
02:42:41,041 --> 02:42:43,790
If you'd at least left
me for another person,

1829
02:42:43,875 --> 02:42:46,415
I would've felt pity and forgiven him.

1830
02:42:47,250 --> 02:42:51,249
But... how do I feel pity for God?

1831
02:42:55,125 --> 02:42:56,165
I'm going back,

1832
02:42:58,916 --> 02:43:01,124
I spent 10 years without you.

1833
02:43:01,833 --> 02:43:03,624
By loving you every single day,

1834
02:43:03,708 --> 02:43:05,124
I can live for another 100 years.

1835
02:43:05,208 --> 02:43:09,582
Either... either He kills me,

1836
02:43:12,041 --> 02:43:17,124
or then accepts
defeat and sends you to me.

1837
02:43:20,250 --> 02:43:21,665
Samar...

1838
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,499
Your passport, ticket...

1839
02:43:44,583 --> 02:43:45,999
immigration form,
I'll fill it for you...

1840
02:43:46,083 --> 02:43:47,915
but the immigration is there...

1841
02:43:48,625 --> 02:43:51,374
My memory is back now, remember?

1842
02:43:52,958 --> 02:43:55,582
I wish I could
delete you from my memory

1843
02:43:56,916 --> 02:44:00,040
I was such a heartless carefree bitch

1844
02:44:00,791 --> 02:44:03,499
and now see what you've made me.

1845
02:44:06,750 --> 02:44:08,124
Akira, the thing is,

1846
02:44:09,416 --> 02:44:11,540
God and me don't get along too well,

1847
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:15,415
but while dying I believe
He listens even to His enemies,

1848
02:44:15,875 --> 02:44:17,665
so when my time comes,

1849
02:44:18,250 --> 02:44:20,415
I'll ask Him for another life,

1850
02:44:22,291 --> 02:44:24,082
to love you!

1851
02:44:26,750 --> 02:44:29,915
This time around I was
born in the wrong generation,

1852
02:44:30,083 --> 02:44:33,957
I became a bit old fashioned, no?

1853
02:44:35,375 --> 02:44:37,082
But I promise next time.

1854
02:44:37,791 --> 02:44:40,499
I'll come as a modern lover like you,

1855
02:44:41,041 --> 02:44:43,624
and ours will be a full on
English style love story.

1856
02:44:43,916 --> 02:44:45,290
Very good soldier,

1857
02:44:46,166 --> 02:44:49,124
you've made me into a complete
romantic and you're turning modern.

1858
02:44:49,791 --> 02:44:51,711
If you want to come,
come back exactly like this,

1859
02:44:51,916 --> 02:44:53,665
from head to toe,

1860
02:44:54,166 --> 02:44:56,874
Akira will never have a
shortage of boyfriends in any life.

1861
02:44:58,708 --> 02:45:00,374
Don't become like me...

1862
02:45:04,916 --> 02:45:06,749
Too late soldier.

1863
02:45:08,083 --> 02:45:09,165
Too late.

1864
02:45:48,708 --> 02:45:51,707
Inform the other vehicles only
after I give the "All Clear" signal.

1865
02:45:52,541 --> 02:45:54,207
Alright. Over and out.

1866
02:46:52,833 --> 02:46:53,582
We are safe.

1867
02:46:53,833 --> 02:46:54,624
Okay, sir.

1868
02:46:55,375 --> 02:46:56,457
- Krishnan.
- Yes, sir.

1869
02:46:56,708 --> 02:46:57,915
Same again...

1870
02:46:58,416 --> 02:46:59,977
Everything's become
so common these days

1871
02:47:00,041 --> 02:47:01,832
I suggest...
that you support the bridge.

1872
02:47:01,916 --> 02:47:02,582
Okay, sir.

1873
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:41,540
Am I going to die today?

1874
02:47:43,291 --> 02:47:46,415
You didn't bear these 10
years all by yourself Samar,

1875
02:47:47,708 --> 02:47:50,374
I've been dying
everyday along with you...

1876
02:47:53,333 --> 02:47:56,624
it's taken me 10 years to
understand a simple thing,

1877
02:47:59,750 --> 02:48:02,707
that He didn't keep you
alive to be without me,

1878
02:48:05,750 --> 02:48:07,749
He kept you alive to be with me.

1879
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,624
Couldn't you have
understood this a little sooner...

1880
02:48:14,416 --> 02:48:15,707
just a little.

1881
02:48:20,250 --> 02:48:22,415
You knew this from the beginning,

1882
02:48:22,833 --> 02:48:27,165
that I take a little more
time to understand things,

1883
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:32,499
and someone had told me

1884
02:48:33,541 --> 02:48:36,124
that every love has it's time,

1885
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:39,415
that time, was not ours,

1886
02:48:42,041 --> 02:48:43,999
but this, is our time.

1887
02:48:45,083 --> 02:48:48,290
Sir we've located another lED.

1888
02:48:52,625 --> 02:48:54,332
Wait for some more time,

1889
02:48:55,666 --> 02:48:58,124
I'll finish a bit of
work and come back.

1890
02:49:00,333 --> 02:49:01,499
And listen!

1891
02:49:02,500 --> 02:49:04,124
Don't pray for anything

1892
02:49:04,958 --> 02:49:06,499
just love me...

1893
02:49:07,541 --> 02:49:09,124
because there's no bomb,

1894
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:12,874
or God, that can keep me
from coming back to you

1895
02:49:14,375 --> 02:49:15,832
I know.

1896
02:49:22,333 --> 02:49:26,249
Samar Anand, The Man Who Cannot Die!

1897
02:49:26,833 --> 02:49:30,915
He has defused 107 bombs
without a scratch on his body.

1898
02:49:31,250 --> 02:49:35,290
He's right now as we
speak defusing his 108th.

1899
02:49:35,791 --> 02:49:37,915
This is not a story of courage,

1900
02:49:38,291 --> 02:49:40,665
its not a story of... miracles!

1901
02:49:41,541 --> 02:49:44,707
Its just a simple story of love,

1902
02:49:45,791 --> 02:49:48,624
undying love that
a man had for a woman,

1903
02:49:49,166 --> 02:49:52,415
unflinching love that
a woman had for a man,

1904
02:49:52,958 --> 02:49:56,499
and unending faith
that God had on their love

1905
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:59,582
I got into this story thinking

1906
02:49:59,666 --> 02:50:02,165
that this was my big
ticket to Discovery channel,

1907
02:50:02,666 --> 02:50:04,540
I'm going to
discover a story of courage,

1908
02:50:05,041 --> 02:50:08,040
bravery, danger, miracles.

1909
02:50:09,708 --> 02:50:11,665
But I ended up discovering love.

1910
02:50:12,541 --> 02:50:14,332
Love that breaks you,

1911
02:50:14,583 --> 02:50:16,249
but still keeps you together,

1912
02:50:17,083 --> 02:50:18,915
love that creates distances,

1913
02:50:19,583 --> 02:50:21,540
but still brings you closer,

1914
02:50:22,583 --> 02:50:24,124
love that is true,

1915
02:50:24,750 --> 02:50:26,040
and forever...

1916
02:50:26,416 --> 02:50:27,915
and I learnt that,

1917
02:50:28,125 --> 02:50:30,499
if you have the
power to love like that,

1918
02:50:30,708 --> 02:50:33,957
then God makes sure that
your love finds its way.

1919
02:50:34,583 --> 02:50:37,832
All you have to do
is just hang in there

1920
02:50:38,375 --> 02:50:39,624
and wait...

1921
02:50:40,166 --> 02:50:41,665
wait for your time.

1922
02:50:43,333 --> 02:50:44,582
As we speak right now.

1923
02:50:45,250 --> 02:50:48,249
Samar is defusing his 108th bomb,

1924
02:50:49,083 --> 02:50:50,499
his last one,

1925
02:50:51,250 --> 02:50:54,082
its his last not because
he's suddenly scared of dying,

1926
02:50:54,416 --> 02:50:55,707
it's his last,

1927
02:50:55,958 --> 02:50:58,082
because it's his time to live now,

1928
02:50:58,708 --> 02:51:01,290
his wait is finally over...

1929
02:51:01,916 --> 02:51:03,915
his time has come...

1930
02:51:04,666 --> 02:51:06,540
his time to love!

1931
02:51:12,666 --> 02:51:14,707
Will you marry me?

1932
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:16,582
Yes...

1933
02:51:50,083 --> 02:51:52,290
This is not a story of courage!

1934
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:54,874
It's not a story of miracles!

1935
02:51:55,208 --> 02:52:00,707
It's just a simple story of love!
