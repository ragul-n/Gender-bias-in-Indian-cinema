You are a charming person?

57
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:55,135

Iosing this game for sure.

And what's this?

67
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,835
Aagra's Pintoo Shukla made his entry
on last moments....

68
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,800
Mathura's defenders are prepared.

69

And here is Pintoo's attack,

70
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,433

Aagra is upset.

74
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,000
lf Pintoo will lose his stamina,

75
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,401
and Aagra will lose the match.

76
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:50,366
And what's this?

77
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:54,902

00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:16,332
You don't know my name.

But what about that tall guy?

144
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:22,899
He is gone too.

00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,967
And what about that angry fatso?

146

Now my hands will narrate the

148
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,900

Do you know what he does on
the streets?

153
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,734
l caught him thrice a week to
fight with the people.

154
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:23,433

he didn't buy vegetables.

159
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:33,433
He never listen to me,

He is trying since long.

00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:01,733
lf he wanted to arrest me he would
have done it earlier.

167
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,868
Will you let him eat without
staring at him,

You don't study properly in college,

180
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:52,002
My account has gone empty to

Those people are fighting and l just
stood to watch.

184
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:02,266
and he slapped on my face without

192
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,333
lf you want to play Kabaddi,

193
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,432

194
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,935

00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,533
He is such a liar.

201
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:45,765
Look Ghanshyu!

202
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:47,599

This is the last time....

204
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:53,800
After that if he will do
something wrong.

205
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:55,500
then l won't help him.

206
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:58,266

00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,367
Then his room will be mine,

208
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,166
Have your meal.

209
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,733
Why are you making hole in
the roof?

210
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:45,335
She is giving me signals from
Iast three months.

211
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:47,600
She is your sister in law.

212
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,834
She is still giving you signals.

213
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,233
Yes! she is giving me signals.

214
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,366
Now?

215
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:04,199
Yes!

216
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,867
Come to me my friend,

217
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,369

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,834
Did you hear about Rambo?

223
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,268

224
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:45,699
Salman Bhai?

225
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,300
Who doesn't know Salman Khan?

226
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:51,268
I
Put them all in a mixer
Ok!

227
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:55,236
Mix it few times.

228
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:58,501

of that milk shake,

229
00:31:59,466 --> 00:32:00,166

230
00:32:03,165 --> 00:32:04,633
You have ruined my mode.

00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:11,299
Are you coming?
No!

234
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,133
Why? My dad will be angry if l came

235
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,434
and by the way l can't miss my
Kabaddi practice.

236
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,034
You won't miss your practice.

237
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:20,200
and make any excuse to your
family,

238
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:25,366
Speak politely!

239
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:29,133
Speak louder!

240
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,067

then l will go to heaven,

264
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:08,633
What about that reporter?

265
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:13,600

00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:41,167
Have your meal and let her eat as well.

00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:54,967
Why you want to send me USA?

286
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,666
Your uncle is calling you there....

287
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,634
You can finish your study there.

288
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,501
You can do yourjob there,

289
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,067
and you can also find a guy
for yourself.

290
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,767
Some American,

291
00:42:13,132 --> 00:42:14,066
l don't want to go anywhere.

292
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,633
l will complete my studies here,

293
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,667

294
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:20,667

00:43:27,499 --> 00:43:28,099
You go l am coming,

299
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:41,501
Yes my dear!

300
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:44,633
You seems lost from yestreday,

301
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,434
l am in big confusion.

302
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,000

303
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,100
that marry with a girl

304
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:00,335
and it says that go and kill
that reporter.

305
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:03,467
What should l do?

306
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:09,800
May l tell you one thing?

307
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,367
Why don't you talk to her?

308
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:16,335
Nowdays girls and boys decided
their own marriage.

309
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,368
and once you got married.

310
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:21,401
then your brother in law won't say
anything about you

311
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,633
You are absolutely right!

312
00:44:54,332 --> 00:44:55,466
Who is Tau?

313
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,301
You came to my house last night....

314
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,701
l wanted to talk to you,

315
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:13,433
Sit!

316
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:25,333
My name is Gajendra Singh,

317
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:28,500
You must heard about me,

318
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:32,902
Your brother has become a priest
after chanting my name....

319
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,734
Are you Politician Gajendra Singh?

320
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:40,366
Your name?

321
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,366

322
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,367
l wanted to talk to you about marriage,

323
00:45:51,366 --> 00:45:52,300
Whose marriage?

324
00:45:53,366 --> 00:45:54,700
You didn't get married yet....

325
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:57,501
and l am not married as well

326
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:03,234
Thankyou!
But l don't want to marry with you,

327
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:03,733
Why?

328
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:07,232
What's wrong with me?

329
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,835
l looks like a decent guy and
l am a rich man

330
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:12,366
l agreed that l am a Goon,

331
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:14,734
l also admit that l have committed
few murders,

332
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,335
it doesn't mean that l can
fall in love with someone,

333
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:25,468
There is not only an iron factory here

334
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:28,233
you will find a rose garden here.

335
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:29,900
And you must knew about that

336
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,234
Nowadays you used to live here

337
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:37,567
And if you are thinking about
my hooliganism

338
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,735
All goons are the servants in front
of their wives.

339
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:47,533
So make me your servant,

340
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:52,432
And if you don't want to marry me

341
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:54,333
Then....

342
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:57,333
finish the job,

343
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:06,300
l really like the way you are....

344
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:07,800
You are shying in a perFect way.

345
00:47:08,165 --> 00:47:09,266
You didn't kill me

346
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:11,233
and it means you're agreed,

347
00:47:11,399 --> 00:47:12,566
that's fine now l am leaving,

348
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:25,501
l have got a scooter for you,

349
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,734
You don't travel in rikshaw,

350
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:29,265
l won't feel good,

351
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:30,333
Get on the scooter

352
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:33,168
and you can ride anywhere,

353
00:47:34,566 --> 00:47:37,201
l just don't want to see any guy
on the bike,

354
00:47:58,299 --> 00:47:59,166
One minute!

355
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,300
Your scooter keys and your proposal

356
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:12,533

358
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:27,599
She will reform me,

359
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:34,498
Yes!

360
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:38,299
What happen?

361
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:42,167

your new clothes

362
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:44,134
Your brother in law has called us

363
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:46,434

364
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:48,634
Thankyou!
Just get me married,

365
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:01,100
Come!

366
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:01,999
How are you?

367
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:04,133
Fine!

368
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,034
