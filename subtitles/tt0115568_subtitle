1
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,672
Till when will we have to
stay here, brother Khan?

2
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,370
Till things don't cool down.

3
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,412
What?!

4
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,107
Keep brushing your moustache
with coal, it will grow.

5
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,424
Kartar, I feel
suffocated over here.

6
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:57,859
Don't worry.
We'll escape as soon as it is dark.

7
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:02,128
As it is, we have to leave
this city anyhow today.

8
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,635
Kishan, where are you going?

9
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:13,144
I want to enjoy the
freedom outside.

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,874
Kishan, you will
not open that door!

11
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:31,453
We are badly trapped, brother Khan!

12
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,929
- What happened?
- The cops have surrounded us!

13
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,900
Kabir, it's the cops!

14
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,232
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes, run.

15
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,205
lam very disappointed, Ranbir.

16
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,249
And I am astonished.

17
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,880
Its the first time that someone
has escaped from your prison.

18
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:07,289
And that too, not one
but five prisoners.

19
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,576
Well done!

20
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,747
You have achieved the impossible.

21
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,252
For the first time in life,
without my permission...

22
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:42,419
. Somebody has managed
to go out of the prison.

23
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:48,262
Had we taken your permission
would you've allowed us to go?

24
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,798
<i>No! It wasn't my
idea... They told me.</i>

25
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,271
Henceforth, not only you will
stop thinking about escaping...

26
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:02,780
No prisoner will ever
dare to think about escaping.

27
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,315
lnspite of being the
public prosecutor...

28
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,319
What prompted you to
resign all of a sudden?

29
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,321
You did not answer us.
Have you resigned...

30
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,552
Because you lost
that case of homicide?

31
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,787
Madam, please answer our questions.

32
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,832
You are wasting my
time along with yours.

33
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,869
lam not interested in
answering any questions.

34
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,339
I wanted to resign and
I've done so... That's all.

35
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,623
What did the doctor say?

36
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,792
He wants Gayatri to be put in a
mental asylum for a few days.

37
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:34,362
That won't be necessary,
we can take care of her at home.

38
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:39,100
Of course we can... You've ample
time now that you've resigned.

39
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,542
I had never contemplated, Geeta.

40
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:50,076
Someday you, a devotee of law,
will consider it your enemy.

41
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,721
Who made this devotee
of the law, it's enemy?

42
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:01,198
You know the answer...
The law itself is responsible.

43
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,036
N0!... Save me!

44
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,206
lam being hanged.
lam dead.

45
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,418
I don't want do die, I want to live.
lam being hanged.

46
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,214
- What's wrong with you, Kishan?
- I am being hanged... Help!

47
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,786
Hey, get hold of yourself, Kishan.

48
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,121
I was dreaming.
lam alive!

49
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,219
The rasca
's always crying.

50
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,192
If you are to be hanged
then you will be hanged.

51
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,434
Stop dreaming about it
28 times in 24 hours.

52
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,673
It seems the cops have falsely
implicated them in a case.

53
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,437
These eunuchs don't seem to be
capable of murdering somebody.

54
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,037
- You dare call us eunuchs!
- No, Kevin, don't.

55
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,209
Let go of me!
I will teach him a lesson.

56
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,680
I will kill the scoundrel!

57
00:07:55,809 --> 00:08:02,055
Listen jerk, they didn't kill
their wive's lover like you did.

58
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,253
Do you know why they killed him?

59
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,055
Tell him.

60
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,031
The three of us are orphans
belonging to different religions

61
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,536
We grew up together.

62
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,801
We shared whatever food we got.

63
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,076
And do you know what accusations
were made against us?

64
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,740
That we were responsible for the
religious riots in our territory.

65
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,843
We saw devastation all around us.

66
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,287
We saw huts being burnt.
We saw tears.

67
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,222
Widowed women, orphaned children
Can you see that?... You can't!

68
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,297
The woman whom we
used to call mother...

69
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,490
Had committed suicide.
Because She was raped!

70
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,667
That's when we decided...

71
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:53,507
That we'll kill the man clad
in white whom you call leader.

72
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,638
We killed him, we
cut him to pieces!

73
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,513
Were we wrong?
Speak up!

74
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,314
ls it a sin to cleanse society?

75
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,716
If it's a sin then yes,
we are guilty, we are criminals.

76
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,292
Till such a leader is not
killed during these riots.

77
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,928
These riots will not stop.
These riots will happen forever!

78
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:25,829
Rubbing out these lines on the
wall won't change your fate.

79
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,735
And counting days
won't increase them.

80
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,671
The 1st of January will
come when it's supposed to.

81
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,645
Neither a day earlier,
nor a day later.

82
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:41,914
I don't want to die now.

83
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:46,947
I don't want to die... Why now?

84
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,755
I don't want to die, ever.

85
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,887
I don't want to die!

86
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:57,867
We have hardly seen
anything in life.

87
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,402
You are right.

88
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:05,132
We have just come of age...
and are about to die.

89
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,941
Do something, brother Kabir.

90
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,109
- Atleast you do something, please!
- Hey Kishan.

91
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:17,450
lam as helpless
as you are, get it?

92
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,657
Just think.

93
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:24,127
If I c0u
d've done something,
I wouldn't be sitting here.

94
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,766
The jailer has taken strict
security precautions.

95
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:36,065
He has strengthened every
wall and door of this prison.

96
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:41,238
It's not only difficult,
it's impossible get out of here.

97
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,314
But I can make the
impossible... possible!

98
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,878
Because doors of iron may
not break by sheer strength.

99
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,388
But can surely be opened
by using a bit of wit.

100
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,451
I will save you from death
and give you a new lease of life.

101
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,688
But, in return, you
will have to do my work.

102
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,701
lam not obliging you in any way.

103
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:08,238
lam helping you because
I need your help.

104
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,898
Consider it to be a deal.

105
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,207
Of your helplessness and my need.

106
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,275
Can I know why you
need... convicts like us?

107
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,080
I will let you know that
when the time is ripe.

108
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,282
Right now I will tell you that.

109
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,018
On every 2nd October, there's
a celebration in this prison.

110
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:34,225
This year, it will be
your last day in prison.

111
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,590
"Wide streets are absent"

112
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,593
"Away from the
tumult of daily life"

113
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,857
"Nor are there any skyscrapers."

114
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,027
"No arguments or fights"

115
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,195
"There's so much of silence here"

116
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,331
"No riots or fights here"

117
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,602
"People may call it a jail
but we are happy here"

118
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,337
"Come on, give me a hand"

119
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:09,945
"People laugh at us"

120
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,114
"They don't value our words either"

121
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,692
"Nobody knows what brought us here"

122
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,124
"We need money to survive"

123
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,292
"We need money to
keep ourselves alive."

124
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:29,099
"For a job, the
government demands money"

125
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,210
"Even you friends need money"

126
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,708
"The constable demands
money if we drive the taxi"

127
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:42,010
"At home, your family
needs the money"

128
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,353
"l don't have an account
in any of the banks"

129
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,519
" Neither does anyone
give you food in charity"

130
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,258
"We would say, life is
better inside this jail."

131
00:15:55,354 --> 00:16:04,206
"Here our life is just
devoid of tensions"

132
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,665
"Everybody gets a job here
even without a degree"

133
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:12,198
"So do we get the money
as soon as we do the work"

134
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,040
"So do we get the food on time"

135
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:20,448
"Everyone gets an equal share here"

136
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,782
"Neither do we have to pay
the rent for the rooms"

137
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:29,190
"Everybody finds a friend here"

138
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,132
"Today is an auspicious day"

139
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:48,577
"There's a need for people
like you in the outside world"

140
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,307
"Go and convince
the people outside"

141
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:57,049
"Teach them how to lead their life"

142
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,353
"The one who goes out
will repent for life"

143
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:10,530
"There's just hatred out there"

144
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,218
Kishanl... Let's go get him.

145
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:10,284
- Where's he? There he is.
- Over here.

146
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,764
Why did you eat the sweets, Kishan?

147
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,137
- Lift him up.
- Come out I will..

148
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,138
- I want more sweets.
- I will give you sweets too.

149
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:27,337
- 'Give me a clap'
- I will give you a clap too.

150
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,346
I will give you a clap.

151
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:18,223
Inspector, not a single car
should pass unchecked, get it?

152
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,500
Open the gate first.

153
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,536
Constable, open the gate.

154
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,739
What! They are in a police jeep.

155
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,972
Constable, get the
car, follow them!

156
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:17,016
After so many days,
for the first time...

157
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,249
All of us can breathe freely.

158
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:23,350
God forbid that jailer should
never be able to catch us again.

159
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,056
You are right... If the
jailer doesn't catch us.

160
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,862
With God's grace we can live a
pleasant life, right friend?

161
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,718
Come along, Kishan.

162
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,314
This is the perfect place
to hide from the cops.

163
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,381
Nobody frequents this
place even during daytime.

164
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:35,364
The locals say that this
place is haunted by ghosts.

165
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:39,563
Haunted by ghosts!
lam very scared of ghosts.

166
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,905
In this world, no ghost,
no wild animal...

167
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,671
ls more dangerous
than the social animal, man.

168
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:52,115
Only human beings cause
loss and suffering.

169
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,013
That is your room.

170
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,455
I've made arrangements
for your food and drink.

171
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,653
You just have to cook it yourself.

172
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,932
One more thing. I've got everything
I might need in my room.

173
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,564
You need not worry about me.

174
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,011
Does this not look like a set
from the movie 'Bees Saal Baad'?

175
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,644
I just can't understand.

176
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,181
What's the big secret?

177
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,188
Why has she brought us here?
Please explain it, brother Khan.

178
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,487
She wants to put up a
factory to make peppermint?

179
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:42,192
What was that?
A peppermint factory!

180
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,197
What'

 we do in a
peppermint factory?

181
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,397
You fool.
The woman who has taken...

182
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:51,032
such a big risk
and brought us here.

183
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:55,408
This place, the f00d.. Remember
the car hidden in the shrubs?

184
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,209
She's planning something big
and it isn't very simple.

185
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,681
I think she has saved
us from being hanged.

186
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:07,747
So that she can get us
killed in this open air.

187
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,952
- You are right, Kabir.
- Get up.

188
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:16,190
I think she has planned
something dangerous for us.

189
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:23,498
She has planned
something... Not us.

190
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,687
Who's that in my truck?
Chotu, check who's there in the truck!

191
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,916
Hey... Stop!

192
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:25,297
- Somebody took our loaded truck.
- Where have they gone?

193
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,951
- What's this, Kabir?
- Grenades, Kishan!

194
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,887
Open the other box, check it out.

195
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:53,886
These boxes contain the
solution to all our troubles.

196
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,559
This gun, so many grenades!
Nobody can touch us now.

197
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,627
Stop talking rubbish.

198
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,536
If the terrorist to whom
this truck belongs...

199
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:06,075
finds out what you are doing,
then we have had it.

200
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,539
You are right, Kevin.

201
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,546
If we fall into the
hands of terrorists.

202
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,243
While trying to escape from the
cops. We will be in deep trouble.

203
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,680
Don't shoot!

204
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,574
Run Kishan!

205
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:44,910
Jump!

206
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,284
Come... Hurry up!

207
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,084
Check everywhere.

208
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,891
They have escaped...
Let's take the truck back.

209
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,072
So you've returned.

210
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,617
Do you think that
because you've escaped...

211
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,846
you've left death far behind?

212
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,047
Perhaps you don't realise that...

213
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,320
Death still looms
large over your head.

214
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,885
There are only two ways
to escape from here.

215
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,795
One road leads to prison.

216
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,630
Where the cops are searching
for you like hunting dogs.

217
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,897
And the other road leads to death.

218
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,839
There's so much illegal
activity going on here.

219
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:49,777
That a stranger is shot at sight.

220
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,411
If you desert me.

221
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,676
Then life will desert you.

222
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,651
I freed you from prison
and brought you here...

223
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,713
.80 that I can achieve my goal.

224
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,989
I promise you.

225
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,462
After I've reached my goal I'll
see to it that you are set free.

226
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,769
Give me that gun.

227
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,895
We will need it in near future.

228
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,904
By agreeing to an
engagement, immediately.

229
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,039
You've won the game of marriage.

230
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:37,747
I can't help it. I pity my brother's
plight as well as yours.

231
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,087
You can wed my brother only
after I've married your brother?

232
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,286
Shut-up.

233
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:50,356
lam telling you, forget
social work and get married.

234
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,901
Else you will remain a
spinster all your life.

235
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,767
I want to get married.

236
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,033
lam just waiting for...

237
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:01,100
that dam to be built
in Dhanakpur village.

238
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,272
The work which I've undertaken
should be completed.

239
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:11,276
Stop talking now and come
out the guests are waiting.

240
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,586
I can understand why you are
hastening things, brother.

241
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,794
But... Atleast let me get dressed.

242
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:23,093
No. I am asking you to hurry up as
the guests are waiting for you.

243
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,261
So that was the only
reason why you came here?

244
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,336
Yes.

245
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,807
No... Besides that
I also came here.

246
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:36,073
To check whether the Major has
come hereto meet my sister.

247
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,816
I was under the impression that
military men are very punctual.

248
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:46,481
What's the time?
Where's the major?

249
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,875
What happened to Arjun?
What's wrong with the Major?

250
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,944
- Get the doctor... hurry!
- What happened, brother?

251
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:21,458
Tell me, brother... Blood!
How did this happen?

252
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:25,222
- Talk to me, brother!
- Gayatri... My sister.

253
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,059
Ramdheen, get the car. Come.

254
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,466
- Come, let's go to the hospital.
- No... No, Jailer.

255
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,902
It's too late now.

256
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,681
Come here.

257
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,696
Geeta, who can change destiny?

258
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:42,732
Stop hitting somebody
who's already dead.

259
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,340
Major Arjun's won't die that easily.
lam a gallant man.

260
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,435
And the gallant will
take the bride with him.

261
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,446
Come... Come into my arms.

262
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,743
lam feeling cold.

263
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,009
Arjun, how did you become
a major in the army?

264
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,281
You would be better
off in the theater.

265
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,689
Forgive me, Gayatri.

266
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,525
I beg your forgiveness, Geeta.
I bow to you.

267
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:12,501
Please forgive me, Geeta.
I couldn't help it.

268
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,731
I would've come on time but
some terrorists confronted me.

269
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,668
And I knew that all of you will
be very upset because I am late.

270
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,573
Soto reduce your anger
I enacted this scene.

271
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,252
Please forgive me.
Look, everybody is watching us.

272
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,297
Let's get on with the
engagement formalities.

273
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:47,531
If you ever play such a joke again,
I will never speak to you.

274
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,775
Why are you staring at
the ring repeatedly?

275
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,047
lam feeling proud of my fate.

276
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,242
That I am engaged to a sensuous
and beautiful girl.

277
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,841
Arjun please speak quietly.

278
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,247
Why should I speak quietly?
lam not a Parsee.

279
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,414
Do you consider us
Parsees to be cowards?

280
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,549
Can't you see I am
the father of three!

281
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,390
He's telling the truth,
you are scared of mom.

282
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,053
lam afraid during the night,
not during daytime.

283
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:52,329
I just can't understand howl
landed up with somebody like you!

284
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,869
That's because you are lucky.

285
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,631
The thing is that there are
very few valiant men like me.

286
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,801
Look at that, praising
your own self!

287
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,737
I will get it done by others.

288
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:07,079
Why don't we ask the people here?
Everybody is here, we'll ask them.

289
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,416
My fiancee wants to know
whether I am handsome or not.

290
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,489
You are very handsome indeed.

291
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,617
Did you see that? We will ask him too.
Please tell her.

292
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,823
You get drunk after having
only a glass of beer.

293
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:24,891
It's your beauty
which intoxicates me.

294
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,265
Stop trying to be too romantic.
Take your seat.

295
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,571
TryingH am a passionate man.
I've been romantic since childhood.

296
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,704
And remember, I'll sing this
song for you when I am eighty.

297
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,547
Sing with me.

298
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:50,921
Why are you feeling shy?
You are beautiful indeed.

299
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,255
As they say in Punjabi.
What do they say, sir?

300
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,390
- A beautiful babe!
- Right on! Beautiful babe.

301
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,526
'I am a crazy boy and you,
my beautiful babe'

302
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,286
"lam a crazy boy and you
are my beautiful babe"

303
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,609
"O my love, don't
steal my heart so"

304
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,175
"Why do you stop me on my way?"

305
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,274
"And tell me why
you are so stubborn?

306
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,978
"Why do you always follow me?"

307
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:55,180
"You are crazy.
You make life difficult for me."

308
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,777
"How gracefully you walk?"

309
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,447
"Your beauty makes people crazy"

310
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,694
"And your intoxicating eyes"

311
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,365
"She seems to be so
innocent at times"

312
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:20,569
"I've never ever seen
such a crazy man"

313
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:24,078
"Who makes a blunder
every other time"

314
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,373
"He's unaware of my desires"

315
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,076
"He never listens to me"

316
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,287
"He teases me on the roads
on some or the other pretext"

317
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,631
"Oh...she's such a sweet girl"

318
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,861
"How long will you
remain a spinster?"

319
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,831
"I'll come as your groom"

320
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:26,137
"I'll make you my bride"

321
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,636
"I'm all yours, O my love"

322
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:33,113
"I'll be the woman of your dreams"

323
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,080
"Don't be in a hurry.
Don't be so restless"

324
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,413
"l have to spend my
whole life with you"

325
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:44,442
- What's this? Let me go.
- I have married you.

326
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,182
You aren't the first man in
this world to get married.

327
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,016
So what if I am not the first,
this is my first marriage.

328
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,083
Leave me, let me get dressed.

329
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,128
Why? Where are you going?

330
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,221
I ain't going anywhere,
someone is coming.

331
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,490
- Who is coming?
- Why should I tell you?

332
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,866
- Who is coming?
- Somebody my own.

333
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,098
Your own! Who's' it?

334
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,141
Someone whom I've
started loving a lot.

335
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,870
Loving! Who's it, Geeta?

336
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:12,745
The one whose fragrance
has filled me.

337
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,250
ls this some kind of a joke?

338
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,249
And what if I tell you
that it's not a joke?

339
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,580
Then I want to know who it is.

340
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,782
I won't tell you.

341
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,260
- Tell me.
- Shall I tell you?

342
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,462
Yes.

343
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,133
What?... No.

344
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:36,263
- Really?
- Yes.

345
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,996
Let me see.

346
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:43,111
ls it true, Geeta?

347
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,204
Let's try once more,
we might get twins.

348
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:49,598
Hail Lord Shiva!

349
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,640
May you live long.
May you prosper.

350
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,637
- Bless me, Uncle.
- May you live long, Rahul.

351
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,639
Come.

352
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:27,642
- My greetings, sir.
- Hail Lord Shiva.

353
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,405
Mr. Nagraj, My son is very sick.

354
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,840
The doctor advised me to take
him to the city for treatment.

355
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,643
Rahul, give him ten
thousand rupees.

356
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,683
Something was wrong with
the roof of your house.

357
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,982
Has it been repaired?

358
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:42,923
Who can tamper with those
who are protected by you.

359
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,857
Your men came and repaired it.

360
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,462
If we did not have a generous
man like you in this village.

361
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,427
Then who knows what our
plight would've been.

362
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:55,330
Look Bheema, I am not God.
lam an ordinary man like you.

363
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:59,864
All this is by the
grace of Lord Shiva.

364
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,671
He's the one who gives,
I just distribute it.

365
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:08,911
You aren't that generous with me.

366
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,852
If I could get some finance.

367
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,082
I'd convert my small
hotel into a bigger one.

368
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:19,356
This small hotel of yours is
not a hotel, it's a tavern.

369
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,694
The smaller it remains the better.

370
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:29,069
Don't hesitate to come when
your daughter is to be married.

371
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:32,006
I will send her off
as a father does.

372
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,739
You will have to do the same
for this child too, sir.

373
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:40,442
She has grown-up... I was
thinking of getting her married.

374
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,314
That's my problem you
shouldn't worry about it.

375
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,753
Just find a suitable match and
start preparing for the marriage.

376
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,723
- Yes Sir.
- Rahul. - Yes, Uncle.

377
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:50,816
Rahul, give him twenty
thousand rupees.

378
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:55,058
Take this.

379
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:59,191
What's the matter?
I don't see you around nowadays.

380
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,136
<i>Come soon, RahuL.</i>

381
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,800
I've to go to the neighbouring
village for prayers.

382
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,139
lam coming.
Take this.

383
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:14,878
Hail Nagraj!

384
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:55,991
I hope you had no
trouble in getting here.

385
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:59,028
Nothing untoward happened.

386
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,824
Rahul, show them the sample.

387
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:05,300
Take a look.

388
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:15,876
How many of these
guns can you supply?

389
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,540
He's the top supplier of arms
in the international market.

390
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,410
If he wants, he can give
a weapon to every one.

391
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:27,513
You may deposit the advance.

392
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:31,253
You'll get the goods
by day after tomorrow.

393
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,827
Pancham, did you get any
information about the boys...

394
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,632
Who tried to hijack our truck?

395
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,310
No, I think they were some small
time crooks. They escaped.

396
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,347
All this happened because
of the truck driver.

397
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,245
I was bringing him to you.

398
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,841
But fearing your wrath he
shot himself on the way.

399
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,910
And you came to me alive.

400
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:02,856
To get the goods to
the warehouse safely

401
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:07,522
Was your responsibility,
not the truck driver's.

402
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:10,395
I pay you such a
big salary for it.

403
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:15,631
I've made a lot of sacrifices
to make this place my fort.

404
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:22,611
And those who make mistakes
have to pay the penalty too

405
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,684
Pancham, get the corpse thrown
to the other side of the border.

406
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,285
Rahul, you have to
go to the airport.

407
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,696
- Will you not ask why?
- Why?

408
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,425
Bobby is returning
from America today.

409
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,053
Hey you monkey!

410
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,255
What pleasure will you get
from staring at me? Get lost.

411
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,467
Brother monkey, I was just joking.
Did I hurt you?

412
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,698
I just played a joke on you and
you are playing with my honour.

413
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,043
Please forgive me.
Give me my clothes please.

414
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:34,946
N0!... Give me my clothes.
Where are you going?

415
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,215
I will feed you a dozen bananas.

416
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:09,440
How dare you remove the
scarf from her head!

417
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,488
It's not out of courage or heroics,
I did it under duress.

418
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,751
You will become helpless when
Nagraj breaks your limbs.

419
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,583
Take him away.

420
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:21,528
Where are you taking me?
Let me go!

421
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:26,295
Do you recognise me, Madam?
Please save me.

422
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,064
- Who's this reprobate?
- Dad...

423
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,799
He's the one who
removed Bobby's scarf.

424
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,099
I did not do it intentionally.

425
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:39,672
Sir, I think you are the
most benign man here.

426
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:45,009
Before that butcher,
Nagraj, cuts me to pieces.

427
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,545
Please save me from that demon.

428
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,025
I beg of you.
Please save me.

429
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:55,030
Break his limbs and throw
him out of the palace.

430
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:59,831
Yes my boy... I am Nagraj.

431
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,237
Take his full name.

432
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:10,038
Take him away.

433
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,443
This is injustice, it's atrocious!

434
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,482
Will you break my
limbs for a scarf?

435
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,744
Madam, please tell them not to.

436
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,479
What are you doing, Dad?

437
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,580
The position he was in at that
time, he had no other option.

438
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,057
Don't break my limbs.

439
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:26,126
Please let him g0, dad.

440
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,598
I will leave him
because you say so.

441
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,327
Let him go.

442
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:38,873
Then what happened?

443
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:44,402
What happened! Both of us
were staring at each other.

444
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,607
She came near me and said.

445
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:55,820
Stop bluffing.

446
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:01,796
I ain't lying.
They were throwing me.

447
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:07,894
I mean... They were
throwing me on that girl.

448
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:13,234
I was tried to get up but they
forced me to sit near her.

449
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:17,437
I got bugged... I
was about to leave.

450
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,809
Where are you going?
What happened next?

451
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,816
- Do you know what happened?
- What?

452
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:25,911
That girl, in her house,
in front of her dad.

453
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,147
Gave me her scarf as
a token of her love.

454
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:31,693
This is that scarf!

455
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:35,525
All that's fine but
where's her house?

456
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:38,795
- What was that?
- Her house.

457
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,335
Follow me.

458
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:44,668
House... Come here, Kartar.

459
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,298
Coming.

460
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:52,439
Call it a mansion... A palace!

461
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,176
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes.

462
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:56,878
Look there.

463
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:01,183
One day the four of you
will come to meet me there.

464
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,521
My life is well set now.

465
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:07,961
Kishanl... You will never
go towards that mansion.

466
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,163
Why not?

467
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,326
That foundation of that mansion
is laid on the corpses of the poor.

468
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,930
That isn't light,
it's the blood <i>of</i> the poor.

469
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:22,410
You will never go towards
that mansion again.

470
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,777
Never... Remember.

471
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:48,401
WOW!

472
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,199
What a girl!

473
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:59,742
Brother monkey, will you stop
eating bananas and help me?

474
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:02,648
Look, it's not very difficult.

475
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:05,209
Just as you stole Kishan's
clothes yesterday.

476
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,313
Similarly, you've to
steal her clothes today.

477
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,585
You steal her clothes
and I will get mad at you.

478
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:13,753
I mean I will act like I am mad at you.
Don't get upset.

479
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,658
I will get what I want.

480
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:22,500
And I will pray to God that you
find a sweet and beautiful mate.

481
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:30,039
He seems to like the idea!

482
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,908
My clothes, hey you monkey!

483
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,952
My clothes!

484
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,550
Where are you going? Stop!

485
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,452
St0p!... Where are you going?

486
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,255
Although a monkey,
you do the work of humans!

487
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:48,363
Stealing the clothes of an innocent girl!
Give it to me.

488
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,961
You dare tease the girls of
the village while I am around!

489
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:58,063
Here you are, wear your clothes.

490
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,367
I will tie this sari here.

491
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:04,970
You may change over here while
I take care of the monkey.

492
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,082
ls that okay?

493
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,095
I have never seen you
in the village before.

494
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,591
Are you a foreigner?

495
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:25,395
Yes I am... I had
come for an outing.

496
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:28,562
But now I am planning
to settle here.

497
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,967
Why?

498
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,769
Because this village
is very beautiful.

499
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,709
And the people here are
even more beautiful.

500
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,978
Come... I will accompany
you to your house.

501
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:48,421
No, if someone sees us together
people will start gossiping.

502
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,924
And my dad might even shoot you.

503
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:57,523
What if I went and asked
for your hand in matrimony?

504
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,899
I will surely make you mine.

505
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:15,608
I like your family very much.

506
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:19,677
As all of us are present why
don't we finalise something.

507
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,780
Isn't it, Reeta?

508
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:26,895
- Who's it now?
- Go and see.

509
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:35,559
- Who are you?
- DhanajiRa0 BhikajiRa0 Patil.

510
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,503
But who are you?

511
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:42,109
Me!... Don't you recognise me?
lam Kevin's father.

512
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,806
Doesn't even recognise
the father!

513
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:53,888
It's you, Saku!

514
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:54,922
My lord!

515
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:59,393
O God you are still alive!

516
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,532
And did you think that
I had gone to hell?

517
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,402
- What are you saying?
- That's why you got married again.

518
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,772
Isn't it?

519
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:19,177
What can I say?

520
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:26,081
We got separated because of
the cyclone twenty years ago.

521
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:32,890
I was left all alone and
I was carrying your child.

522
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:39,696
To nurture whom god gave
me a husband like James.

523
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:43,432
Because of him I got respect in
society, he gave me his love.

524
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:46,575
He took great care of me.

525
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,440
If it wasn't for
him I would be on...

526
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,812
...the streets along
with your child.

527
00:57:54,872 --> 00:58:00,584
Hey Sakubai... Queen of Kolhapur.

528
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,250
That's enough.

529
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,927
You thought you could fool
me once again, did you?

530
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:10,261
What do you mean, Pascal?

531
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,558
Take this, hold it.

532
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,599
What are you doing?
Can't you handle one orange?

533
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,074
How will I get married now?

534
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,476
A gun!

535
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,683
Speak up now!

536
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:44,499
This is a gun, it's
not meant for kids.

537
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,967
If it goes of it can
make a hole in your head.

538
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:50,299
I intend to make a hole in
a head, not in an orange.

539
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,303
Drop it quietly.

540
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:01,306
The thing is that our friend
loves your daughter.

541
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:06,817
We don't want you to create
trouble, get it? Let's go.

542
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:10,882
Here are your grapes.

543
00:59:17,788 --> 00:59:21,326
This wasn't my idea.
Please forgive me.

544
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,103
That's strange!

545
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:31,303
They came to ask for my daughter's hand
and they intimidate me too.

546
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:36,545
Brother, I am writing this
letter to you because...

547
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,847
The festival of 'Rakhi' is near.

548
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,356
I know that you must
be very cross with me.

549
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,356
Perhaps you may not
accept my 'Rakhi'

550
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,620
But you are aware.

551
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:53,964
What prompted me to help
your five prisoners flee.

552
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,061
But I promise you that...

553
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:59,335
If I am alive after
mission is successful.

554
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,076
Then I will surely hand
myself over to the cops.

555
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:05,136
Your unfortunate sister, Geeta.

556
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:41,216
Where have these fellows gone?

557
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,321
This file contains
sufficient evidence.

558
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,323
To prove that your sister
helped those prisoners flee.

559
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,824
And you helped her in it.

560
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,328
Jailer Raghuveer,
you aren't fit

561
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,830
to hold this
responsible post any longer.

562
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:11,346
What are you doing here?
Get lost!

563
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,849
lam not going to fall for
your tricks like those two.

564
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,852
Get lost or I will bash you up.

565
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:22,356
Help!

566
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,852
So that's it.
Some girl seems to be in trouble.

567
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,374
You scoundrel!
Leave her alone.

568
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,375
I said leave her alone!

569
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:45,869
Who the hell are you?
Get lost... Don't you know me?

570
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,883
You don't know who I am!

571
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:50,384
lam not interested in
knowing who you are.

572
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:22,417
Thanks a million.

573
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,420
You came in time or else.

574
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,422
You were fortunate,
therefore I came.

575
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,916
Else I had no plans to help you.

576
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:35,429
- Then why did you?
- I may be malevolent.

577
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:40,424
But still I can't bear to
see injustice being done.

578
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,935
Who says that you are bad?

579
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:45,440
For me, you are no less than god.

580
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:54,008
"Somethings begun to
happen in my heart"

581
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,010
"Let it happen"

582
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:58,513
"I've begun to lose my composure"

583
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,014
"Let i1 go"

584
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:13,027
"My youth has filled with love"

585
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,530
"Everything seems so beautiful"

586
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:20,034
"The cold winds sent a
wave of heat through me"

587
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:23,037
"O this romantic weather!"

588
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,039
"Somethings begun to happen..."

589
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:05,068

01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:19,583
"Where can one find
such a crazed lover"

592
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:24,598
"Put sense into him,
he may go crazy"

593
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:30,093
"l will do whatever you say"

594
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,609
"l can even give my life for you"

595
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,110
"This is the moment of consent"

596
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:39,113
"Somethings begun to happen..."

597
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:19,642
"lam star number one,

01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:34,157
"Stop being obsessed about films"

600
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:38,662
"Neither am I an actress,
nor are you an actor"

601
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:44,167
"My destiny will shine the day

602

"l will keep you close to

"Please take me in your arms"

612
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,766
"Somethings begun to happen..."

613
01:08:56,833 --> 01:09:02,806
What's the matter?
You are partying during the day?

614
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:07,821
Our friend, Kartar was
planning to leave us.

615
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,323
But he won't now, that's why.

616
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:12,826
Take this.

617
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,829
Hey, what's all this?

618
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,331
You have returned back to my pub.

619
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,835
You snatched my gun
that day, but today..

620
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:26,840
Pascal, we are not here with
a proposal today, get it?

621
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:32,346
We are hereto have a few drinks
and we will pay cash, get it?

622
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:33,847
Cash!... You will pay
me cash, will you now?

623
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:38,341
You don't need to
pay me cash today.

624
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:42,846
Today all the drinks
are on the house.

625
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,360
So that everybody drinks
throughout the year.

626
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:50,854
And thus I get all their cash.

627
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,367
Therefore I forgive my
enemies too on this day.

628
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,370
- You mean, you've forgiven me too.
- Yes.

629
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:02,366
You mean you accept our proposal
But why is this day special?

630
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,378
What a stupid question!

631
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:07,882
Today is the first day of the year.

632
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,383
- ls it?
- It's the 1st of January.

633
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,887
Keep drinking, you don't
know anything about time.

634
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:18,892
The 1st of January!

635
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:24,387
Yes, the day we were
supposed to be hanged!

636
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:28,903
What would have happened
if we had been there today?

637
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,906
Nothing... We would've
been drinking in heaven.

638
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,910
That's fine but... Our
life would've ended.

639
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:42,405
You are right, Kevin.
We should be grateful to Geeta.

640
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:50,414
From today, as long as we live,
we should be grateful to her.

641
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,458
Gratitude!

642
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:01,424
But I won't give you a chance to
repay this debt of gratitude.

643
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:05,440
Beware!... Nobody
should try to escape.

644
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,443
Did you think that
I will let you go?

645
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:15,438
I would've come to get you
even if you had hidden in hell.

646
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,452
The uniform which was my pride.

647
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,455
Which meant more to me then life.

648
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:24,958
I had to remove it because
the five of you fled.

649
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:30,954
And now I will wear it
only after you are hanged.

650
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:40,965
Sir, will you kill the five of
us just to wear your uniform.

651
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,480
Where's my sister?

652
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:47,981
I don't know.

653
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:53,476
You don't know... Well, no problem.

654
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,480
I will make you tell me
once we reach prison.

655
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:01,495
Now, move it... Move it!

656
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,503
Why are you pushing us?

657
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,506
- Open the door.
- I will open it.

658
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,513
- Get inside.
- Shall I close it?

659
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:28,081
Kartar, the jailer has vanished.

660
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:33,087
Kevin, open the door, quick.

661
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,120
Yes.

662
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:38,092
Beware... Don't you try to flee.

663
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,093
Sit where you are.

664
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,095
Yes Jailer, go ahead and shoot.

665
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:47,100
But remember who ever gets
shot will fall towards you.

666
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:50,603
And if the weight on
your side increases.

667
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,106
Then the van will
fall in the canyon.

668
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:57,110
I don't mind losing my
life while doing my duty.

669
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:01,103
Today is the 1st, the day you
are supposed to be executed.

670
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,116
And you will die today.

671
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,119
Your death may be by hanging
or by falling in this canyon.

672
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:16,119
Kevin, open the door,
he won't shoot.

673
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:18,632
Kevin, open the door!

674
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:42,656
What nonsense!

675
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:45,659
If you don't believe me
ask your man, he was there.

676
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:49,663
I have made investigations.

677
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:53,656
They are the same five who
tried to hijack your truck.

678
01:14:57,193 --> 01:15:01,164
And one of the five
took Bobby's scarf.

679
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:05,668
And Rahul too was beaten
up by one of them.

680
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:14,188
They are dangerous criminals
who escaped from prison.

681
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,689
They have been sentenced to death.

682
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,192
It means that the
crazy woman Geeta....

683
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:23,697
...br0ught them here after
helping them escape from prison.

684
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,699
So that she can take her revenge.

685
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:35,199
A woman craving for revenge is
similar to an injured snake.

686
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:41,203
Before that poisonous
snake tries to bite us.

687
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,184
She should be crushed.

688
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:00,734
Where had you been?

689
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:02,736
How many times have I told you

690
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:04,738
that it's dangerous
for you to roam around.

691
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,740
What'

 you do if somebody
recognises you

692
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,742
or the cops spot you?

693
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:10,243
You may even lose your life.

694
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,746
I've been waiting
with this letter

695
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,748
and none of you are to be seen.

696
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:17,250
Letter, whom have you written to?

697
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,753
To my brother... The festival
of 'Rakhi' is on Sunday.

698
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:26,260
Don't worry, I haven't
written the address.

699
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,761
Post it from some other place.

700
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:31,264
Take this.

701
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:53,276
Where should we post
this letter from?

702
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,789
So that it may reach the Jailer.

703
01:16:57,313 --> 01:16:59,293
I don't know what to do.

704
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:21,804
Geeta, come down quietly,
the game is over.

705
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,321
Guys, I think there's
trouble outside.

706
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:28,821
We have to stop them.

707
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,326
Are you coming down
or should I come up?

708
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:02,856
Madam, throw the gun down!

709
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:48,902
Throw the gun, Geeta!

710
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,430
Throw the gun, Geeta!

711
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:26,440
Where are you, Geeta?

712
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:34,448
You scoundrel... I will kill you!

713
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:09,972
You will be fine, don't worry,
nothing will happen to you.

714
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,490
No, brother Khan!

715
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,491
Get out of my way, Kevin.

716
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,493
- No.
- Let me g0, Kevin.

717
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:21,527
NO!

718
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:26,489
Who does she think she is?

719
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:29,503
Are we her puppets?

720
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,505
Aren't we humans? Does our
life not mean anything to her?

721
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:37,010
Khan is right, Kevin.
We will teach her a lesson today.

722
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:39,512
- No.
- Get out of my way, Kartar.

723
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,021
Can she do anything with us?

724
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:51,024
She can leave us unarmed against
enemies so that we die like dogs

725
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,525
And we shouldn't retaliate!

726
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:58,020
Have you gone deaf, you coward?
We have shouted ourselves hoarse

727
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,532
Does she not hear anything?

728
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:09,042
Does she take us to be
lambs meant for slaughter?

729
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:20,053
Today I will teach you a lesson.

730
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:24,057
That you will never
play games with men.

731
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:44,066
Why did you stop?
What do you intend to do?

732
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,080
You want to kill me!

733
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:51,585
Do you want to kill me or rape me?!

734
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:57,090
Do it!... Do whatever
you want to!

735
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,595
You will never get a better chance.

736
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:05,599
When can a woman be so vulnerable.

737
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:13,596
I should be punished for
saving you from the gallows.

738
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:19,613
It wasn't cowardice,
it was my helplessness

739
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,615
That stopped me from
helping you today.

740
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:26,119
I was about to give
you the gun but...

741
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:30,123
But at the same time.

742
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:36,629
Don't come near me!

743
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:43,626
I brought you here considering
you to be humans, not criminals.

744
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:48,642
The two of you have
broken my faith.

745
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:55,638
I don't want to see your faces.
Go <i>away...</i> Get lost!

746
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:08,662
Her condition is very critical.

747
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,664
We've to get a doctor
or a midwife soon.

748
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:34,676
Are you hurt?
Does it pain a lot?

749
01:23:35,211 --> 01:23:38,681
- What makes you so happy?
- Who, me? I am very unhappy.

750
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:41,694
- Then why are you laughing?
- Laughing, who me?

751
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,697
I am crying, do I look
like I am laughing?... No.

752
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,201
You see I've a
problem with my face.

753
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:50,203
When I am laughing,
it looks like I am crying.

754
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:52,705
When I am crying it
looks like I am laughing.

755
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,206
My face is like that.

756
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:57,711
When I was born people said....

757
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:01,213
What a strange boy!
He's laughing instead of crying.

758
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,216
But actually I was crying.

759
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:06,720
But whatever happened to you is
too bad. Does it pain a lot?

760
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:11,224
They will face much more then
what has happened to us, get it?

761
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:23,236
Surround them...
Nobody should escape.

762
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,750
Dad, there's nobody here.

763
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,251
It seems they have fled.
Blow away the place.

764
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,275
Perhaps it's fate.

765
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,781
If Pascal hadn't informed
us and brought us here.

766
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:11,284
Then we too might have
been blown to bits.

767
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:12,785
It would've been better that way.

768
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:16,790
Atleast we wouldn't have
to live with such contempt.

769
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:23,786
Our anger and emotion has made
us commit a grave mistake.

770
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,800
We've made a very big mistake.

771
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:42,806
See how both of them have
started staying away from us.

772
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:45,318
Kishan is right.

773
01:25:46,342 --> 01:25:48,322
They are very repentant
for their mistake.

774
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:50,323
Pardon them now.

775
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,817
Forgive them, how
can I forgive them.

776
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:00,834
I'd never thought...

777
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:05,838
that they could commit such
an ignoble act... Stoop so low.

778
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,341
We know that they acted
in the worst fashion.

779
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:12,345
But to err is human.

780
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:15,848
Yes I thought they were human,
so I brought them here.

781
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:18,851
To seek vengeance from Nagraj.

782
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:26,860
Nagraj ruined my happiness.

783
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:29,863
I lost all my peace
and joy because of him.

784
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:37,359
After marrying Arjun...
I was so happy.

785
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:41,374
I was so happy.

786
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:54,376
Give me half a kilo each of
brinjals, carrots and cabbage.

787
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:56,389
Won't you buy some pumpkins?

788
01:26:56,912 --> 01:27:01,383
Buy some... Major Arjun
Singh likes it a lot.

789
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,396
O wife of Arjun Singh, buy it.

790
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,399
Arjun...You!

791
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:10,392
My darling, I love you a lot!

792
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:11,904
Are you crazy?

793
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,407
If not the pumpkin at least take
me instead... Oh my sweet-heart!

794
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:22,916
- Mother.
- It's not ma, it's grandma.

795
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,919
I know that Arjun
likes pumpkin, right?

796
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,924
Hello! How are you?

797
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,930
lam your lover.

798
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,932
You may take this pumpkin for free.

799
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,934
Take it away.

800
01:27:52,968 --> 01:27:56,438
Look at what you've done!
All the pumpkins have fallen down!

801
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:59,953
What'

 I tell my wife now!

802
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:00,986
Don't touch me.

803
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:04,957
My wife will bash me up if
I don't feed her pumpkin!

804
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:08,962
Who's this Arjun?
I don't know any Arjun!

805
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,463
- Friends please tell her.
- Don't you know Arjun?

806
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,965
I will never speak to you again!

807
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,469
I was just joking.

808
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:19,973
Sorry guys, Please leave,
she's my wife.

809
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:22,475
Go and have your fun in your house!

810
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:23,976
Why create a ruckus in the market?

811
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:33,986
Don't go away.

812
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:50,503
That was the Brigadier.

813
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:52,505
He must've asked you to
join duty immediately.

814
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:56,009
Fine, you may 9°-

815
01:28:57,032 --> 01:28:58,010
Hey love...

816
01:28:58,534 --> 01:29:01,515
Do you think that I feel
like going away from you?

817
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:03,015
What can I do?

818
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,517
Terrorist activities in
Dhanakpur have increased again.

819
01:29:05,574 --> 01:29:07,019
And they have called me urgently.

820
01:29:09,044 --> 01:29:11,024
My love...

821
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:14,027
If you get distraught
I won't be able to go.

822
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:16,528
Look, I will try to
be back in a week.

823
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:18,030
Come now, give me a smile.

824
01:29:20,055 --> 01:29:22,035
That's better...Take care of my.

825
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,536
‘Achiku’, 'Bachiku' and
'Kachiku' while I am gone.

826
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:27,039
What's this ‘Achiku’, Bachiku’,
and 'Kachiku'

827
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,041
These are the code
words of military men.

828
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:31,543
'Achiku' means good, like me.

829
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:35,048
'Bachiku' means a child, like him.

830
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:38,550
And 'Kachiku' means the
most loved one, like you.

831
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:45,046
Enough ofjokes, get serious now.

832
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:46,091
What's it?

833
01:29:46,148 --> 01:29:48,560
For many months now Gayatri
has been in Dhanakpur.

834
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,063
I hope my brother doesn't become
an old man waiting for her.

835
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:54,066
As you are going there, tell her...

836
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:56,068
that if the dam
has been made....

837
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:58,070
then she should
come back home soon.

838
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:00,573
Don't listen to her.

839
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:03,576
You stand to lose
everything you have.

840
01:30:03,632 --> 01:30:05,077
And listen to me, girl.

841
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,079
There will be no dam
built in this village,

842
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:08,580
understand this properly.

843
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:10,082
A dam can't be built!

844
01:30:11,106 --> 01:30:13,086
After days of hard work...

845
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:15,587
I've procured all the
documents from the government.

846
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:18,091
And you say that the
dam can't be built.

847
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:20,093
Why not?

848
01:30:21,116 --> 01:30:23,596
Don't you want this
village to prosper?

849
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:26,099
The land to yield more grain.

850
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:30,102
The farmers get better homes
instead of the huts they stay in.

851
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,605
Factories to be built here
and everybody gets jobs.

852
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:37,599
Nobody is denied a means of income.

853
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:39,612
Do you mean to say that the
people here aren't happy?

854
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:42,114
Cool down, Rahul, be calm.

855
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:47,609
I understand perfectly
what you are trying to say.

856
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:53,115
For the prosperity
of this village...

857
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,127
if I've to
demolish my palace...

858
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,129
I will do it unhesitatingly.

859
01:30:57,653 --> 01:31:00,133
But I won't allow this
age old temple

860
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:03,135
to be destroyed at any cost.

861
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:06,138
But the temple is on a hill-top,
how can it be destroyed?

862
01:31:06,194 --> 01:31:10,142
I've no objection to a dam
being built in this village.

863
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:17,139
But do you know what'

 happen
if the walls of the dam cave in?

864
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:20,653
The force of the
water from the dam

865
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:22,655
will wipe out
the entire village.

866
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:26,159
This temple will drown.

867
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:28,660
Everybody will be annihilated.

868
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:32,165
Do you want this to happen to you?

869
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,666
No, we don't want the dam,
we want the temple!

870
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:36,168
Yes, we want the temple!

871
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:39,171
- Hail Lord Shiva!
- We want the temple!

872
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,670
Why are you standing here now?
Did you hear their decision?

873
01:31:49,204 --> 01:31:51,684
It's no use breaking
your head against a wall.

874
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:54,186
You will only break your head.
Go away now.

875
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:59,191
If I feared for my head then I
wouldn't have taken up this work

876
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:01,193
Remember this...

877
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:04,696
if it's easy to provoke
the innocent villagers...

878
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:07,199
then it's not a difficult
task to make them see reason.

879
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:09,701
A dam will surely be
built in this village.

880
01:32:19,234 --> 01:32:21,714
Let go of <i>me...</i> I
said leave me alone.

881
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:37,230
By sending these ruffians to
forcefully bring me here...

882
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,731
you've changed my
doubt into conviction.

883
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:42,235
That you are no saint...

884
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,736
but a devil in the
guise of a saint...

885
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:46,238
who for his own gain

886
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,740
did not let a dam be
built in this village.

887
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:50,242
You speak a lot.

888
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:55,237
But I am sorry to say that
lam not a good listener.

889
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:57,749
lam the third eye of Lord Shiva!

890
01:32:58,273 --> 01:33:03,245
And when the third eye is
opened... Life turns into death.

891
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:16,759
Teach her such a lesson that
nobody ever dares such impudence

892
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:19,772
Build a dam, will you?

893
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:23,276
You want the welfare of the
village at our expense, do you?

894
01:33:56,331 --> 01:34:00,802
Don't cry, Gayatri.

895
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:03,315
Your brother is here now.

896
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:08,320
This military man puts his
life at stake on the border...

897
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:11,323
...protects the honour of mothers
and sisters in this country.

898
01:34:12,347 --> 01:34:15,328
You dared to molest the
sister of that very man!

899
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:16,361
Don't cry.

900
01:34:17,352 --> 01:34:19,332
I will spare none of you.

901
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:20,832
Brother, you don't know Nagraj is.

902
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:23,836
I know it... I know it now.

903
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,341
He's that traitor...
That terrorist...

904
01:34:28,396 --> 01:34:31,343
whose men carry on smuggling
activities on the border.

905
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:35,837
You are not only my sister's...

906
01:34:35,904 --> 01:34:37,850
you are my mother's
perpetrator too.

907
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:41,843
The mother whom we
know as Mother India!

908
01:34:42,377 --> 01:34:43,355
You scoundrel!

909
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:47,860
You abuse the very womb
which gave birth to you!

910
01:34:47,916 --> 01:34:49,862
Hail Lord Shiva!!!

911
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,970
Don't move!

912
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:40,472
Else I will put a bullet
through Nagraj's head!

913
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:47,969
Don't move else I will kill him!

914
01:36:48,036 --> 01:36:50,983
Killed him!...

915
01:36:51,506 --> 01:36:53,486
They have killed my brother!

916
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:57,489
Nothing will happen to me.

917
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:02,995
Get away from here,
get going, run, run away!

918
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,498
<i>Blood!</i>

919
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:17,499
You want me to hand over the
terrorists to the police,

920
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:18,543
don't you?

921
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,012
- Yes.
- They harassed you so much.

922
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:25,017
Go and get the cops.

923
01:37:25,073 --> 01:37:28,020
Nothing will happen to me,
I will be fine, just go.

924
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:33,514
I am fine, go and get the cops.
I will not die.

925
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:36,528
- Yes, I will get the cops.
- Yes, go.

926
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:39,531
They killed my brother!

927
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:52,539
Nagraj, don't move.

928
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:04,545
He seems to be dead.
Go and check.

929
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:10,563
<i>Check him out... Go.</i>

930
01:38:40,615 --> 01:38:41,593
He's dead!

931
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:44,597
Throw his corpse on the
other side of the border.

932
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,600
A true soldier

933
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:51,102
has become a martyr while
fighting with terrorists.

934
01:38:58,633 --> 01:39:01,113
Hail Lord Shiva!

935
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:09,121
The moon is not to be seen today.

936
01:39:09,644 --> 01:39:11,123
It just won't come
out of the clouds.

937
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:18,190
You should be ashamed
of playing such a joke.

938
01:40:18,713 --> 01:40:21,193
He has a habit of harassing me.

939
01:40:22,717 --> 01:40:24,196
It's 'Karwa Chauth’ today.

940
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:27,199
I've been fasting since morning
and praying for his long life.

941
01:40:27,255 --> 01:40:31,203
And all of you too have
joined in his pranks.

942
01:40:31,726 --> 01:40:33,706
There's a limit to playing pranks.

943
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:37,710
Come on get up Arjun,
enough of your pranks.

944
01:40:40,735 --> 01:40:42,214
Arjun, please get up.

945
01:40:43,738 --> 01:40:45,718
I'd told you that if you
play such a prank

946
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:47,719
I will never speak to you.

947
01:40:48,743 --> 01:40:51,724
What's all this?
Come on get up.

948
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:55,227
I will leave if you don't get up.

949
01:40:57,752 --> 01:41:02,223
It's 'Karva Chauth’ today,
please don't do this today.

950
01:41:02,757 --> 01:41:04,737
I will start crying now.

951
01:41:09,764 --> 01:41:14,736
Arjun will never get up again.

952
01:41:17,772 --> 01:41:21,242
Brother... You too!

953
01:41:21,776 --> 01:41:24,256
lam not going to
fall for your tricks.

954
01:41:24,312 --> 01:41:27,259
- No, Geeta, it's true.
- Enough... You too.

955
01:41:31,286 --> 01:41:36,759
I can't bear it anymore, Arjun.
Come on Arjun.

956
01:42:59,374 --> 01:43:02,844
The deceased, Major Arjun Singh
was murdered in Dhanakpur.

957
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,356
But his corpse was
found on the border.

958
01:43:05,413 --> 01:43:09,361
Then how can you say for sure
that he was murdered by Nagraj?

959
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:11,864
Do you have an eye witness

960
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:13,364
or any concrete
evidence to prove it?

961
01:43:13,421 --> 01:43:13,762
There's proof... This girl.

962
01:43:16,424 --> 01:43:20,372
She saw Nagraj
murdering her brother.

963
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:28,369
My lord, perhaps counsel
doesn't realise that

964
01:43:28,436 --> 01:43:30,882
the court doesn't approbate
the testimony of lunatics.

965
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:36,389
And I've already proved
that this girl is insane.

966
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:39,891
That's a lie.
She wasn't insane.

967
01:43:39,948 --> 01:43:42,394
But the murder of her brother
has turned her insane.

968
01:43:42,917 --> 01:43:43,895
It's a lie!

969
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:45,897
The court isn't concerned

970
01:43:45,953 --> 01:43:48,399
with whether she was
or she became insane.

971
01:43:48,456 --> 01:43:51,403
You just state whether
this girl is insane or not.

972
01:44:09,944 --> 01:44:10,922
No, Gayatri.

973
01:44:20,955 --> 01:44:23,435
But this girl can't say anything.

974
01:44:23,491 --> 01:44:27,940
Her plight says
everything, my lord.

975
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:29,941
But the law doesn't
examine her plight,

976
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:31,943
<i>it looks for conclusive proof.</i>

977
01:44:32,967 --> 01:44:37,939
The public prosecutor has not
shown any concrete evidence...

978
01:44:38,006 --> 01:44:44,446
which proves that Nagraj
murdered Major Arjun Singh.

979
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:48,950
Therefore this court
dismisses the case.

980
01:44:57,491 --> 01:44:59,471
This is injustice!

981
01:44:59,994 --> 01:45:03,464
This verdict is wrong.

982
01:45:03,531 --> 01:45:05,477
Will you teach me the law?

983
01:45:09,003 --> 01:45:12,473
If I wish to, I can dismiss you
from this profession right now!

984
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:14,486
That won't be necessary!

985
01:45:14,542 --> 01:45:17,489
Your decision has broken
my faith in the law.

986
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:19,491
Before you can dismiss me,

987
01:45:19,547 --> 01:45:21,493
I myself resign
from this profession.

988
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:36,507
Congratulations.

989
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:48,520
Calm down, Pancham.

990
01:45:49,043 --> 01:45:53,514
She's a wild cat... She's
bound to use he claws.

991
01:45:54,548 --> 01:45:57,028
She has slapped you today.

992
01:45:58,052 --> 01:46:03,525
But after a few days
she will slap herself.

993
01:46:04,058 --> 01:46:08,029
Why waste your youth behind
somebody who's already dead?

994
01:46:09,063 --> 01:46:15,537
Marry me... I will
make you my queen.

995
01:46:22,076 --> 01:46:25,057
Don't be happy about
your false victory.

996
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:28,059
You may have escaped
from the court of law.

997
01:46:28,115 --> 01:46:32,063
But in my court you were
and are a criminal.

998
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:35,066
Perhaps this court has
failed to do justice...

999
01:46:35,122 --> 01:46:38,569
so that I can deliver a
verdict only you by myself.

1000
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:42,073
You will not die in
any other manner.

1001
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:46,077
I will kill you.
Only I will kill you!

1002
01:47:40,154 --> 01:47:42,134
Are you in your senses?
What are you doing?!

1003
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:43,634
- Leave me.
- No, Geeta.

1004
01:47:43,691 --> 01:47:45,136
- Leave me.
- Your husband is dead.

1005
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:46,637
You can't use this
Vermilion... You can't!

1006
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:55,648
Those demons have snatched
my husband's body only,

1007
01:47:55,703 --> 01:47:57,649
not his memory.

1008
01:47:58,673 --> 01:48:00,653
He's alive!

1009
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:09,651
He lives in my heart,
my breath, my soul.

1010
01:48:11,185 --> 01:48:13,665
In every part of my body.

1011
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:18,170
Do you know what the
people will say

1012
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:19,670
if you wear your wedding chain?

1013
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:22,172
And if I don't wear it the
very people will say...

1014
01:48:22,230 --> 01:48:25,177
that you're young and beautiful,
you need support.

1015
01:48:25,233 --> 01:48:26,211
Be my mistress.

1016
01:48:26,267 --> 01:48:27,245
NO!

1017
01:48:28,202 --> 01:48:29,180
Yes, brother.

1018
01:48:30,705 --> 01:48:34,676
Seeing me widowed has corrupted
the minds of those sinners.

1019
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:41,182
And till I don't kill the
people who killed my husband...

1020
01:48:45,219 --> 01:48:47,199
I will not remove
this wedding chain.

1021
01:48:49,223 --> 01:48:50,702
I will not remove it!

1022
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:59,700
I still feel the fire of my
husband's pyre in my heart.

1023
01:49:00,234 --> 01:49:03,215
And now I will not let
it be extinguished.

1024
01:49:10,244 --> 01:49:12,724
I swear by you today.

1025
01:49:14,248 --> 01:49:17,229
I swear by our child.

1026
01:49:18,252 --> 01:49:21,722
I will reduce those sinners
to ashes with this fire.

1027
01:49:30,264 --> 01:49:31,743
I will incinerate them.

1028
01:49:40,274 --> 01:49:43,255
I wore the wedding chain
inspite of being a widow.

1029
01:49:44,278 --> 01:49:49,250
And swore to kill Nagraj.

1030
01:49:53,287 --> 01:49:55,767
I saw the five of you in prison.

1031
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:58,770
I found that you
too were victimised.

1032
01:49:58,825 --> 01:50:00,771
You hate outlaws.

1033
01:50:03,297 --> 01:50:06,767
I saw a ray of hope
in the darkness.

1034
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:11,772
I felt that if my intelligence
could combine with your strength

1035
01:50:11,839 --> 01:50:13,785
Then we will be an army.

1036
01:50:14,308 --> 01:50:16,288
A powerful army.

1037
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:20,792
With which I can combat that
demon, fight him, break him.

1038
01:50:23,317 --> 01:50:25,797
But these two broke me.

1039
01:50:28,322 --> 01:50:30,302
Fate defeated me once again.

1040
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:33,304
Fate defeated me.

1041
01:50:52,346 --> 01:50:57,318
That woman can prove
to be dangerous for us.

1042
01:50:58,853 --> 01:51:03,324
Do anything... But find
out as soon as p0ssible...

1043
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,837
where the hideout of Geeta
and her accomplices is.

1044
01:51:48,402 --> 01:51:50,882
"Achiku, bachiku, kachiku"

1045
01:51:51,405 --> 01:51:54,386
"You are the best
baby in the world"

1046
01:52:01,415 --> 01:52:04,396
"The moon has come down on earth"

1047
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:07,398
"And brightness' spread everywhere"

1048
01:53:07,481 --> 01:53:10,462
"The day is over,
night has begun"

1049
01:53:10,985 --> 01:53:14,455
"O moon, come!
Feed us sweet milk"

1050
01:53:24,498 --> 01:53:27,479
"Something new happened today"

1051
01:53:27,534 --> 01:53:30,981
"Make mummy dance,
you dance for her"

1052
01:53:31,038 --> 01:53:34,485
<i>“Look, my dear</i>

1053
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:37,988
you have cast
a spell on everyone"

1054
01:53:38,045 --> 01:53:40,491
"Achiku, bachiku, kachiku...."

1055
01:54:30,564 --> 01:54:33,044
"You are my image, fair like me"

1056
01:54:33,567 --> 01:54:37,037
"l will be like papa one day"

1057
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:50,050
"He is with me"

1058
01:54:50,117 --> 01:54:53,064
"There is no other toy like this"

1059
01:54:53,587 --> 01:54:58,058
"Having got you, I have
found all happiness"

1060
01:54:58,125 --> 01:55:00,071
"l have no control over myself"

1061
01:55:00,127 --> 01:55:03,074
"Achiku, bachiku, kachiku

1062
01:56:03,657 --> 01:56:05,637
I understand the fact...

1063
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:08,639
that Geeta hates us.

1064
01:56:09,663 --> 01:56:12,143
Therefore she keeps
that child away from us.

1065
01:56:13,667 --> 01:56:19,140
But I don't understand why
you're so fond of that child?

1066
01:56:24,678 --> 01:56:29,650
I've never wished to
hurt anybody, Kabir.

1067
01:56:32,686 --> 01:56:37,157
I've considered truth and
honesty to be my religion.

1068
01:56:39,693 --> 01:56:41,673
I used to drive a cab.

1069
01:56:42,696 --> 01:56:45,176
I was happy with whatever I earned.

1070
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:49,681
I just wanted to see my child.

1071
01:56:51,705 --> 01:56:53,685
I was taking my wife
to the hospital.

1072
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:59,190
All of a sudden they
attacked me on the way.

1073
01:57:01,715 --> 01:57:04,195
Because I was going to testify
against them in court.

1074
01:57:04,251 --> 01:57:06,697
That they murdered Uncle Shankar.

1075
01:57:08,722 --> 01:57:12,192
They cruelly murdered my
wife in front of my own eyes.

1076
01:57:14,227 --> 01:57:17,697
Yes Kabir... My world was
shattered in front of my eyes.

1077
01:57:17,765 --> 01:57:20,211
They killed my child
in his mother's womb.

1078
01:57:27,741 --> 01:57:29,220
I killed those rogues!

1079
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:38,730
I avenged the death of my wife.

1080
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:41,232
I handed myself over to the cops.

1081
01:57:41,755 --> 01:57:44,235
I got the death sentence
but I wasn't unhappy.

1082
01:57:44,758 --> 01:57:49,229
I had never been as
dejected as I am now.

1083
01:57:49,763 --> 01:57:53,233
I see my child in this child.

1084
01:57:54,768 --> 01:58:00,741
I get furious when that woman
doesn't allow me to touch him.

1085
01:58:00,807 --> 01:58:05,256
I don't know what to do!

1086
01:58:05,779 --> 01:58:08,760
Am I so bad that I can't
even touch the child.

1087
01:58:08,815 --> 01:58:09,793
No, Khan.

1088
01:58:13,787 --> 01:58:15,266
Calm down.
Get a hold of yourself.

1089
01:58:15,322 --> 01:58:18,269
You are not a bad man.

1090
01:58:18,792 --> 01:58:20,772
lam a bad man.

1091
01:58:22,796 --> 01:58:25,276
I used to deal in
death to earn money.

1092
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,279
I used to sell bombs to
terrorists and enemies

1093
01:58:28,334 --> 01:58:29,312
of this country.

1094
01:58:30,804 --> 01:58:35,776
And one day they used
the bombs made by me

1095
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:38,789
to blow up the
area in which I stayed.

1096
01:58:40,814 --> 01:58:45,786
And the first house
which blew up was mine.

1097
01:58:47,821 --> 01:58:50,301
There were thirteen
people in my house.

1098
01:58:51,825 --> 01:58:54,305
But not a single corpse was found.

1099
01:58:55,829 --> 01:58:57,809
Then I realised for
the first time...

1100
01:58:57,864 --> 01:59:02,313
how it feels when
one of our family dies.

1101
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:12,813
If we want to we can
embrace this child.

1102
01:59:13,847 --> 01:59:15,827
We can play with him.

1103
01:59:16,349 --> 01:59:18,829
How can we do it?

1104
01:59:18,885 --> 01:59:22,332
Tell me once... I can lay
down my life for this child.

1105
01:59:22,856 --> 01:59:26,827
You don't need to lay down your
life, you have to kill somebody.

1106
01:59:28,862 --> 01:59:29,840
Yes!

1107
01:59:32,299 --> 01:59:33,277
Let's go.

1108
02:00:27,854 --> 02:00:28,832
Don't move!

1109
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:33,337
You will not escape now.

1110
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:36,340
Shoot him, Khan!

1111
02:00:51,378 --> 02:00:53,358
Shoot them!
Kill both of them!

1112
02:01:20,407 --> 02:01:21,385
Run Khan... Run!

1113
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:46,410
I had removed the
bullets from your gun.

1114
02:01:48,435 --> 02:01:50,915
Because that devil will
be destroyed by me.

1115
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:53,918
Only I will kill him, not you.

1116
02:01:53,974 --> 02:01:54,952
Get in the car.

1117
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:16,440
I want Geeta and her
five companions

1118
02:02:16,496 --> 02:02:19,443
in front of me within 24 hours.

1119
02:02:19,499 --> 02:02:21,945
Or else I will be furious.

1120
02:02:22,469 --> 02:02:24,949
And you know very well...

1121
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:29,953
what happens when
Nagraj is enraged... Go!

1122
02:02:52,499 --> 02:02:54,479
Oh God, this is outrageous!

1123
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:57,981
Who's this woman who's broken an
age old tradition of the village

1124
02:02:58,038 --> 02:03:01,485
Yes, for many years
now only Nagraj...

1125
02:03:01,541 --> 02:03:03,487
and his ancestors have
offered prayers at this temple.

1126
02:03:03,543 --> 02:03:05,989
Nobody can save her from
the wrath of Nagraj.

1127
02:03:09,516 --> 02:03:10,995
Hail Nagraj!

1128
02:03:29,536 --> 02:03:31,015
Hail Lord Shiva!

1129
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:34,518
Who are you?

1130
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:38,522
Who dared to step in
my ancestral temple

1131
02:03:38,578 --> 02:03:40,023
without my permission.

1132
02:03:46,552 --> 02:03:47,530
You!

1133
02:03:48,555 --> 02:03:49,533
Yes, it's me.

1134
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:54,538
Remember I had told you that you
are destined to die by my hands?

1135
02:03:54,594 --> 02:03:56,540
That day is here.

1136
02:03:57,063 --> 02:03:59,543
You forgot what I told you.

1137
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:02,546
Those who try to kill
Nagraj certainly die.

1138
02:04:03,069 --> 02:04:06,539
You don't know that Nagraj has
the blessings of Lord Shiva.

1139
02:04:07,073 --> 02:04:10,054
And you came to the temple
of Shiva to kill Nagraj?!

1140
02:04:10,577 --> 02:04:14,548
I have chosen this place
for you to die so that...

1141
02:04:14,614 --> 02:04:17,561
the villagers may
awaken as soon as you die.

1142
02:04:18,584 --> 02:04:20,063
And they realise that the one

1143
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,565
who they considered
to be a great devotee...

1144
02:04:21,621 --> 02:04:23,567
was in fact a sinner
and an immoral person.

1145
02:04:31,598 --> 02:04:33,578
Arrest this woman.

1146
02:04:36,603 --> 02:04:38,082
I won't spare you!

1147
02:04:41,107 --> 02:04:42,085
Take her away!

1148
02:04:42,609 --> 02:04:46,079
I knew that this woman will
definitely come here, sir.

1149
02:04:46,146 --> 02:04:48,592
Therefore I came
here fully prepared.

1150
02:04:48,648 --> 02:04:51,595
You dare attack a benevolent
person like Mr. Nagraj.

1151
02:04:52,619 --> 02:04:54,599
You are the murderer of
those four bodyguards.

1152
02:04:54,654 --> 02:04:56,099
You can't escape from here.

1153
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:57,133
Take her away.

1154
02:04:58,625 --> 02:05:00,605
Think yourself to be fortunate
that you are saved today,

1155
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:03,106
but remember...

will not let you live.

1156
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:06,611
You will die at my hands,
you scoundrel!

1157
02:05:07,133 --> 02:05:08,612
Imprison her!

1158
02:05:24,651 --> 02:05:27,632
Leave with all the
policemen immediately.

1159
02:05:27,687 --> 02:05:30,133
I want the police
station to be empty.

1160
02:05:30,657 --> 02:05:33,137
Geeta and her aides are
my offenders first,

1161
02:05:33,193 --> 02:05:34,638
then that of the law.

1162
02:05:35,662 --> 02:05:38,142
We will settle our
score with them first.

1163
02:05:38,665 --> 02:05:42,135
They will be punished
for their infringement.

1164
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:45,650
And that punishment will
not be given by the law.

1165
02:05:46,673 --> 02:05:51,144
I will punish them... With my
own hands I will punish them.

1166
02:06:17,704 --> 02:06:20,184
A woman is my weakness.

1167
02:06:24,711 --> 02:06:27,191
But I won't treat
you with affection.

1168
02:06:27,714 --> 02:06:29,694
I will shower you with my hatred.

1169
02:06:32,718 --> 02:06:36,188
If you are man enough
just release me once.

1170
02:06:36,723 --> 02:06:38,202
You will find out....

1171
02:06:38,725 --> 02:06:40,705
whether woman
is your weakness...

1172
02:06:41,728 --> 02:06:43,708
or you are weaker then a woman.

1173
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:44,741
You bitch!

1174
02:06:53,239 --> 02:06:54,718
Our Mr. Nagraj...

1175
02:06:56,743 --> 02:06:59,223
Do you know who he is?

1176
02:06:59,278 --> 02:07:02,225
The topmost terrorist
in this country.

1177
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:07,230
The biggest dealer of
arms and ammunition.

1178
02:07:08,755 --> 02:07:10,234
And you tried to attack him!

1179
02:07:11,758 --> 02:07:14,238
The wounds which you
inflicted on him...

1180
02:07:14,294 --> 02:07:20,734
I will give back those
wounds to you, with interest.

1181
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:26,751
Tell me, where are the other
members of your team...Speak up!

1182
02:07:26,806 --> 02:07:28,752
Here we are, you swine!

1183
02:08:49,856 --> 02:08:52,837
Geeta, the child is all alone.

1184
02:09:24,891 --> 02:09:27,872
You saved the child
from being orphaned.

1185
02:09:28,895 --> 02:09:30,374
Don't you want to embrace him?

1186
02:09:31,898 --> 02:09:35,368
Have you forgiven us?

1187
02:09:36,903 --> 02:09:38,883
If I don't forgive you now

1188
02:09:38,938 --> 02:09:41,885
...G0d will never forgive me.

1189
02:09:43,910 --> 02:09:44,888
Thanks.

1190
02:09:57,924 --> 02:10:02,896
What happened?
Why're you crying?

1191
02:10:02,962 --> 02:10:07,411
Today I've come to know what
type of a person my father is.

1192
02:10:08,935 --> 02:10:10,915
Perhaps to hide this from me,

1193
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:13,416
he kept me away from
him since childhood.

1194
02:10:14,941 --> 02:10:17,922
But till date although
I stayed away,

1195
02:10:17,977 --> 02:10:19,923
I was not as far
away from him....

1196
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:22,926
as I am from him now
although I stay with him.

1197
02:10:25,952 --> 02:10:27,932
I can understand your grief.

1198
02:10:28,955 --> 02:10:31,936
But perhaps this is
what's known as fate.

1199
02:10:32,959 --> 02:10:35,439
That the person whom one
can't bear to stay away from.

1200
02:10:35,495 --> 02:10:37,941
It often happens that one has to
stay away from the very person.

1201
02:10:38,965 --> 02:10:40,444
Did you see it, madam?

1202
02:10:40,967 --> 02:10:43,447
See how happy he is.

1203
02:10:49,976 --> 02:10:54,447
He's happy because... For the
first time his army is ready.

1204
02:10:54,981 --> 02:10:57,461
Perhaps he feels for
the first time...

1205
02:10:57,516 --> 02:11:02,966
that his father's assassins
will surely be punished.

1206
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:06,971
This isn't a smile...
It's a declaration of war.

1207
02:11:08,994 --> 02:11:11,975
The war which was started by
his father, Major Arjun Singh.

1208
02:11:12,999 --> 02:11:14,979
And we will finish it.

1209
02:11:32,018 --> 02:11:36,990
"Our Army is ready!"

1210
02:11:39,025 --> 02:11:44,498
"Our Army will not accept defeat!"

1211
02:12:02,048 --> 02:12:04,028
"Our courage is explosive"

1212
02:12:05,051 --> 02:12:07,531
"Our breaths full of fire"

1213
02:12:09,055 --> 02:12:11,535
"Life was unfair to us"

1214
02:12:13,058 --> 02:12:14,537
"But death indulged us"

1215
02:12:15,561 --> 02:12:21,034
"Our Army is ready!"

1216
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:46,570
"Why are you sitting dejected"

1217
02:12:47,093 --> 02:12:49,073
"Smile, my friend"

1218
02:12:51,096 --> 02:12:54,077
"Pick up a musical instrument"

1219
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:57,080
"And sing a new song"

1220
02:12:59,105 --> 02:13:02,575
"We can stop a storm,
divert a tempest"

1221
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:06,090
"We can defeat the whole world"

1222
02:13:06,145 --> 02:13:11,094
"We will always walk ahead!"

1223
02:13:12,118 --> 02:13:17,591
"Our Army will never stop"

1224
02:13:19,625 --> 02:13:25,098
"Our Army is ready!"

1225
02:13:36,142 --> 02:13:38,622
"More dear than our life

1226
02:13:39,145 --> 02:13:41,625
are dear the
lives of each other"

1227
02:13:43,149 --> 02:13:46,130
"We will sacrifice our lives

1228
02:13:46,652 --> 02:13:49,132
for each other"

1229
02:13:51,157 --> 02:13:53,137
"We have a dream"

1230
02:13:53,192 --> 02:13:54,637
"And courage in our hearts"

1231
02:13:54,694 --> 02:13:56,640
"it's a night of joy"

1232
02:13:56,696 --> 02:13:58,141
"We are all in a daze"

1233
02:13:58,197 --> 02:14:02,646
"It will never turn back"

1234
02:14:04,169 --> 02:14:09,642
"Our Army will return
victorious always"

1235
02:14:12,178 --> 02:14:17,150
"Our Army is ready!"

1236
02:14:53,218 --> 02:14:54,697
- Beware!
- Don't move.

1237
02:15:00,226 --> 02:15:04,697
The boy <i>looks</i> exactly like his father,
he <i>looks</i> like a Major.

1238
02:15:04,763 --> 02:15:08,711
Daddy, I warn you, don't even
think of harming this child.

1239
02:15:10,236 --> 02:15:12,716
A foreign education doesn't mean...

1240
02:15:12,772 --> 02:15:15,719
that you forget your manners.

1241
02:15:15,775 --> 02:15:16,753
Take her away.

1242
02:15:17,743 --> 02:15:18,721
No!

1243
02:15:20,246 --> 02:15:22,726
You instigated my
daughter against me.

1244
02:15:23,749 --> 02:15:26,229
You killed my friend's son.

1245
02:15:27,253 --> 02:15:29,233
Now it's your son's turn.

1246
02:15:29,288 --> 02:15:32,235
If there's a single
scratch on my son's body...

1247
02:15:32,291 --> 02:15:36,239
...then I swear by god,
whose devotee you are...

1248
02:15:36,295 --> 02:15:40,243
I will give you such a death...

1249
02:15:40,299 --> 02:15:43,246
that you will die hundred
times before you pass away.

1250
02:15:43,302 --> 02:15:45,748
Those who try to kill
Nagraj themselves die.

1251
02:15:45,804 --> 02:15:50,253
Tie them up and attach
a time bomb to them.

1252
02:15:59,285 --> 02:16:02,755
Throw the others in the
dark cell, Bobby too.

1253
02:16:02,822 --> 02:16:05,769
No dad, let them g0, please.

1254
02:16:13,799 --> 02:16:15,278
Just shut-up!

1255
02:16:22,308 --> 02:16:24,288
If I could get my hands free...

1256
02:16:24,343 --> 02:16:28,291
Then I will blow Nagraj
to bits with this very bomb.

1257
02:16:32,317 --> 02:16:35,787
Man proposes...

1258
02:16:35,854 --> 02:16:39,802
God disposes.

1259
02:16:39,859 --> 02:16:42,806
YOU!
you're alive!

1260
02:16:42,862 --> 02:16:46,810
It's my good fortune and
your bad fortune that I safe.

1261
02:16:47,333 --> 02:16:50,314
I have fought death to stay alive,
you scoundrels!

1262
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:52,815
And wanted to live

1263
02:16:52,871 --> 02:16:55,818
so that I could bring
scofflaws like you to justice.

1264
02:16:55,874 --> 02:16:58,320
We are prepared to hand
ourselves over to the cops.

1265
02:16:58,377 --> 02:17:00,323
But remove this bomb first,

1266
02:17:00,379 --> 02:17:01,824
which has been
placed here by Nagraj.

1267
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,827
We've to save Geeta and her child.

1268
02:17:05,351 --> 02:17:07,831
- Geeta's child!
- Yes, Geeta's child.

1269
02:17:09,355 --> 02:17:12,336
The place where Geeta's
husband met his death...

1270
02:17:12,391 --> 02:17:14,837
at that place,
was born a child...

1271
02:17:15,361 --> 02:17:17,841
a symbol of her
husband's love.

1272
02:17:21,367 --> 02:17:24,837
Nagraj has kidnapped
Geeta and the child.

1273
02:17:25,371 --> 02:17:28,352
We don't have much time, jailer.

1274
02:17:28,407 --> 02:17:30,353
We don't care about our life.

1275
02:17:30,409 --> 02:17:32,355
But in this war...

1276
02:17:32,411 --> 02:17:36,860
The devil, Nagraj, will die,
not Geeta and her child.

1277
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:39,862
No, not Geeta and the child!

1278
02:17:49,395 --> 02:17:50,874
Hail Lord Shiva!

1279
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:57,870
Your army is annihilated.

1280
02:17:58,904 --> 02:18:01,384
But I will find peace...

1281
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:05,388
Only when she too is
destroyed along with her army.

1282
02:18:06,412 --> 02:18:10,383
I will squeeze the life out
of her with my own hands.

1283
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:11,894
Calm down, Pancham.

1284
02:18:12,418 --> 02:18:14,398
You will get your chance.

1285
02:18:15,421 --> 02:18:16,900
You will kill her.

1286
02:18:17,422 --> 02:18:19,902
But it will not be a simple death.

1287
02:18:19,958 --> 02:18:21,403
We will torture her to death.

1288
02:18:22,428 --> 02:18:23,907
I want to see...

1289
02:18:23,963 --> 02:18:26,910
for how long a
mother's affection...

1290
02:18:26,966 --> 02:18:31,415
can protect the child
from the wrath of Nagraj!

1291
02:18:32,438 --> 02:18:35,908
Get her ready and
bring her to my court.

1292
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:19,451
"It's an old story"

1293
02:19:28,994 --> 02:19:34,467
"Our enmity is age-old"

1294
02:19:42,508 --> 02:19:46,479
"l have to douse this
fire of vengeance in me"

1295
02:19:55,521 --> 02:20:01,494
"Our enmity is age-old"

1296
02:20:51,576 --> 02:20:58,050
"You have made me cry,
you have tormented me"

1297
02:21:07,593 --> 02:21:10,574
"l will humble you"

1298
02:21:10,629 --> 02:21:14,076
"l will burn you alive"

1299
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:17,581
"That's a vow I've taken today!"

1300
02:21:27,612 --> 02:21:33,085
"Our enmity is age-old"

1301
02:22:35,681 --> 02:22:42,656
"l have vowed, and even
your time has arrived"

1302
02:22:52,698 --> 02:22:59,172
"No one will save you,
you will die!"

1303
02:22:59,704 --> 02:23:02,685
"l have to cremate you"

1304
02:23:12,718 --> 02:23:18,191
"Our enmity is age-old"

1305
02:25:20,345 --> 02:25:21,824
Hit him, Khan!

1306
02:25:38,363 --> 02:25:39,341
Sister-in-law!

1307
02:25:55,881 --> 02:25:58,361
In this war, this child won't die!

1308
02:26:26,411 --> 02:26:29,881
You scoundrel,
you killed our friends!

1309
02:26:30,415 --> 02:26:32,895
We won't let you live anymore!

1310
02:26:32,951 --> 02:26:33,929
STOP!

1311
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:36,399
You will not kill him.

1312
02:26:36,922 --> 02:26:39,402
I will kill him at any cost.

1313
02:26:39,457 --> 02:26:43,906
No, Geeta... He has killed
our brothers, Khan and Kabir.

1314
02:26:43,962 --> 02:26:46,408
I will not spare him!

1315
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:50,412
Nol... No, Kartar.
Get back.

1316
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:57,921
Those who try to kill Nagraj,
themselves die.

1317
02:26:58,443 --> 02:27:04,917
What can a vulnerable woman,
a helpless mother, a widow do to me.

1318
02:27:05,951 --> 02:27:09,421
Nobody can face the
wrath of Nagraj!

1319
02:27:09,954 --> 02:27:12,434
I've the blessings of Lord Shiva!

1320
02:27:13,958 --> 02:27:17,929
I will kill you along
with your child today.

1321
02:27:20,966 --> 02:27:25,938
This is the sword with
which he killed my brother.

1322
02:27:35,981 --> 02:27:37,961
You cannot escape today.

1323
02:27:39,984 --> 02:27:44,455
You are an imp0st0r...Y0u don't
have the blessings of any God.

1324
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:47,970
I will offer your
head to God today.

1325
02:27:48,993 --> 02:27:50,973
Nobody can stop her today.

1326
02:30:52,176 --> 02:30:55,157
Now this young Major
is your responsibility.

1327
02:30:56,181 --> 02:30:59,651
Make him fearless
and courageous like Arjun.

1328
02:31:01,185 --> 02:31:05,656
You were disgraced because of me.

1329
02:31:08,193 --> 02:31:10,673
lam your culprit,
please forgive me.

1330
02:31:10,729 --> 02:31:13,175
My mission of killing
this Satan is over.

1331
02:31:13,698 --> 02:31:16,679
Today I hand myself
over to you and the law.

1332
02:31:30,214 --> 02:31:31,693
How are you, my friend?

1333
02:31:39,223 --> 02:31:41,203
Come my queen!

1334
02:31:54,239 --> 02:31:57,220
Munna, that's your mother.

1335
02:31:57,742 --> 02:32:00,723
- Don't you want to meet her?
- Yes, I want to meet her.

1336
02:32:00,779 --> 02:32:01,723
Then go.

1337
02:32:29,274 --> 02:32:30,252
What happened?

1338
02:32:31,275 --> 02:32:32,754
What happened, Munna?

1339
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:49,271
Don't ever play such a joke again.

1340
02:32:49,327 --> 02:32:50,772
I will never speak to you.

1341
02:32:52,297 --> 02:32:53,776
Don't ever do it again.

1342
02:32:58,303 --> 02:33:01,773
'Achiku' 'Bachiku' 'Kachiku' Mother,
you are the dearest.
