1
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,881
What are you doing for Diwali, Amal?

2
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,007


3
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:46,164
Me too.
I double my prices on Diwali.

4
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,326
People will pay anything on Diwali.

5
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,727
You probably make a killing.

6
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,697
No, madam.

7
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,666
Hey sister, spare some change.

8
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,732
Get lost.

9
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,675
- Anything.
- I said get lost!

10
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,779
So you really never charge extra?

11
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,389
And I thought you only gave me
a good price because you liked me.

12
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,798
Thief! Thief!

13
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,564
Don't worry about it.

14
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,001
There's nothing valuable
in the purse.

15
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,470
I have my money. See?

16
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,439
But madam, wait here.

17
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,640
Someone call an ambulance!

18
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,738
Tea.

19
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,006
Hot.

20
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,445
Just tea?

21
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,645
How about some food?
Veg, meat?

22
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,917
Just tea.

23
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,790
Hurry up!
Make the big man his tea, quickly.

24
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,856
Lazy bums.

25
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,363
Standing around, doing nothing.

26
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,899
Hurry up!

27
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,575
What is this? Hey!

28
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,815
You call this Bournvita?

29
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,016
What are you saying?

30
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,713
I asked for Bournvita.
What is this?

31
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,654
You asked for tea.

32
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,182
You're saying I didn't ask for Bournvita?

33
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,058
You asked for tea, "hot."

34
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,690
Really?
So you're calling me a liar?

35
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,200
Calm down and be reasonable.

36
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:40,936
I'm not giving you a penny
until I get my Bournvita, hot!

37
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,205
You said tea and will pay for it!

38
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,475
So you call this customer service?

39
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,879
Don't lecture me.

40
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,376
Get the hell out of here.

41
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,347
Fine.

42
00:05:55,421 --> 00:06:00,051
You'll be out of business in a month.
Remember this.

43
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,194
Remember what?

44
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,096
Fuckin' vagrant can't even remember
an order.

45
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,803
How is she?

46
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:47,931
Not good.

47
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,406
Who are you?

48
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,033
We just brought her in.

49
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,577
Your names?

50
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,839
Amal Kumar.

51
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,814
Pooja Seth.

52
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,010
Did you get the car's licence number?

53
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,450
No.

54
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,217
You can go.

55
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,286
Will she be okay, Doctor?

56
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,228
We won't know until morning.

57
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,357
Thank you.

58
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,881
It wasn't your fault, Amal.

59
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,714
She stole my bag

60
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,321
and ran into traffic.

61
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,684
I know, madam.

62
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,714
Hey.

63
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,017
You brought the little girl?

64
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,146
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,356
I'm Dr. Shiva.

66
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,722
How is she, sir?

67
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,193
She's stable,
but in serious condition.

68
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,662
Listen, does this girl have any family?

69
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,129
Don't know, sir.
Why?

70
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,862
She might be here for a while.

71
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,861
What's the problem, sir?

72
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,769
You're...
What's your name?

73
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,239
Amal Kumar.

74
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,639
What do you do?

75
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,439
Drive a rickshaw.

76
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,179
Don't worry.
I'll do what I can.

77
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,768
But sir, this is only 50.

78
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,569
That's what we agreed on.

79
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,802
We said 70.

80
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,403
Coming from there, we had to take
a longer route because of traffic.

81
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,072
- Longer?
- It was a short cut!

82
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,615
What do you mean short cut?

83
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,651
You're all bloody crooks.

84
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:17,246
We agree on a fare
and you change your mind.

85
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,886
Asshole.

86
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,666
50 rupees.

87
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,798
I brought him here from CP for 50.

88
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,496
It's a fair price.

89
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,973
Auto...

90
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,373
Yes, sir.

91
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,536
Over here.

92
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,381
Madam!
Yeah! Come, come, madam.

93
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,984
Fucker.

94
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,615
Come, sir.

95
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,718
- You're free?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,833
Hey, I don't need your help!

97
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,459
Let's go.

98
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,551
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

99
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,470
CP, Inner Circle.

100
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,897
Yes, sir.

101
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,568
Sir?

102
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,079
Are you feeling okay?

103
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,640
I'm not paying you to talk.
Just drive.

104
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,820
Sir.

105
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,915
- What?
- Cough drops.

106
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,609
What's going on?
Why have we stopped?

107
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,910
Construction, sir.
Metro work.

108
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,382
Get us out of here.
I don't care how!

109
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,560
Go...
Through there.

110
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,760
Faster. Faster!

111
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,734
Faster!

112
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,882
- Who's that?
- Sir?

113
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,352
In the photo?

114
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,312
My father.

115
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,179
Also a rickshaw driver?

116
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,656
Was, sir.

117
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,255
Was?

118
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,526
Someday we'll say the same about you.

119
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:19,166
What will you do
when the metro replaces you guys?

120
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,272
Where in the Inner Circle
would you like to go, sir?

121
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,644
Idiot, you missed the Outer Circle!

122
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,411
Sir?

123
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,116
I told you to take me to the Outer...
Inner... Outer Circle!

124
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,849
Sir, you said Inner Circle.

125
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,954
So I'm lying?
I'm lying?

126
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,120
No, sir.
My mistake.

127
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,597
I'll report you for this.
What's your name?

128
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,497
Amal Kumar, sir.

129
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,899
What?

130
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,108
I'll report you for this.

131
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,872
All rickshaw drivers
are money-sucking leeches.

132
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,144
Turn here!

133
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,088
There. Ahead.

134
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,524
Okay, stop.
Stop!

135
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,630
How much?

136
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,895
47, sir.

137
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,736
I'm giving you 37
because you're such an idiot.

138
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,645
And if you have a problem with that,
I'll keep your cough drops too.

139
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,911
Should I?

140
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,052
Whatever you like, sir.

141
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,997
What kind of a rickshaw driver are you?

142
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,264
Sir, not all rickshaw wallahs are the same.

143
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,328
Where did you learn that?

144
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,203
From my father.

145
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,445
You're an idiot.

146
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,019
You'll die broke.

147
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,015
That should cover it.

148
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,619
Sir?

149
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,764
Keep the three rupees.

150
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,700
I said keep it.

151
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,864
Sir, you said 37.

152
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,168
Consider it a tip.

153
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,266
No, sir.

154
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,916
Listen.

155
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,329
What is your father's name?

156
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,225
Vijay Kumar, sir.

157
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,045
Take care, sir.

158
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,784
Hi, ma'am.
How's it going?

159
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,453
Count these.

160
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,779
Did you go back?

161
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,943
Yes, madam.

162
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,213
How is she?

163
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,283
Getting better.

164
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,154
See, I told you.
No need to feel guilty.

165
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,318
These things happen all the time.

166
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,486
Madam, l...

167
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,030
I couldn't sleep.
Look what I made.

168
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:10,467
It's not the strongest, but it'll hold.

169
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,504
Have you ever had your wallet stolen?

170
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,199
Last night,
I went through everything in my purse.

171
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,606
Most of it was junk.

172
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,372
It was useless for you to run after her.

173
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,812
These beggars are all the same.

174
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,214
My supplier has lots of these losers
around his place.

175
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,584
By the way, if you ever need anything,
he's a good guy to know.

176
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,748
Amal, if you ever need spare auto parts,

177
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,315
Subhash's brother owns a place
in Karol Bagh.

178
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,827
He'll give you a good deal.
Right, Subhash?

179
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,489
- Of course, ma'am.
- Good.

180
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,556
Here.

181
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,066
What the hell is this?

182
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,168
This isn't the same brand.

183
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,469
Why are you giving me this shit?

184
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,974
It's okay.
It's good water.

185
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,069
Good water? But you're charging me
the same for this shit?

186
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,306
But it's all the same.

187
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,111
I know this brand.
It sells for 12 rupees per bottle.

188
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,980
If you're selling for 8, I'll buy.

189
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,021
You sell it for 10.
What will I do with 2 rupees profit?

190
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,556
- But ma'am...
- I'm not paying.

191
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,559
You can't switch brands like that
without telling me.

192
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,460
I came to you because of your prices.

193
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,556
I drive with Amal because of his prices.

194
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,827
Amal, unload the water.

195
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,098
But ma'am, I have higher expenses.
I make nothing.

196
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,731
How long have I been coming to you?

197
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,658
Can't hold it in?

198
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,238
Drive luxury cars, dress in fancy clothes,

199
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,434
and you piss on our streets like a dog.

200
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,034
Fuck off.
Leave me alone.

201
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,052
Just whip it out anywhere and start...

202
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,716
Hey, Tabla Man!

203
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,657
Why are you ruining such a great song?

204
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,523
Old man...

205
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,190
Either listen, or leave politely.

206
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:05,526
If my patrons will allow me to say so.

207
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,539
Yes, go ahead!

208
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,236
Keep singing like this
and your God will never forgive you.

209
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,437
So can you do any better?

210
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,575
Better than this? I've been singing this song
since before he was born.

211
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,347
Please then, Old Timer.

212
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:26,414
Show us how it's done.

213
00:20:50,916 --> 00:21:02,225
<i>My story remained untold in my heart.</i>

214
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:09,091
<i>No one understood</i>
<i>the essence of my expressions</i>

215
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:14,696
<i>in this world.</i>

216
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:26,143
<i>My story remained untold in my heart.</i>

217
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:32,750
<i>No one understood</i>
<i>the essence of my expressions</i>

218
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:38,126
<i>in this world.</i>

219
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,960
Keep going, please!

220
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:57,849
<i>I ended up far from my real purpose.</i>

221
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:10,690
<i>I ended up far from my real purpose.</i>

222
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:22,563
<i>My beloved life has gone wasted.</i>

223
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:29,911
<i>No one understood the</i>
<i>essence of my expressions</i>

224
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:36,352
<i>in this world.</i>

225
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,915
You're welcome to sing here anytime.

226
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,890
I don't sing.

227
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,831
What's he saying?

228
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,503
Don't give him the 30 rupees.

229
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,379
Don't give it to him.

230
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,485
How is she, sir?

231
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,851
She's better.

232
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,686
More alert,
but I'd like to run some more tests.

233
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,055
What's the problem, sir?

234
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,323
She was hit hard on the head.
I'm just being cautious.

235
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,192
In the meantime,
I think she could use some company.

236
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,324
Oh no, sir.

237
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,030
Patients usually make a faster recovery
if they have someone to spend time with.

238
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,773
I have to run.

239
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,757
They treating you okay?

240
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:55,061
Well, they missed breakfast today,
but otherwise it's great.

241
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,862
It's like a hotel.

242
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,632
If I knew hospitals were like this,

243
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,173
I'd have run into traffic long ago.

244
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,773
Do you have any family?

245
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,142
No, just the Godfather.

246
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,114
You work for Thaakur Saab?

247
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,383
Of course.

248
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,011
Don't you?

249
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,554
No.

250
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,847
Who was that cheap bitch
in your rickshaw?

251
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,324
She's not a bitch.

252
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,452
So you admit she's cheap?

253
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,655
I think you should rest, Princess.

254
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,030
I was just kidding.
Come sit.

255
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,959
Sit.

256
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,202
I said sit.

257
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,844
So you drive her every day?

258
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,547
Since when did you start driving her?

259
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,952
You should rest.

260
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,351
She's cute, isn't she?

261
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:57,456
I bet you'd drive her for free if she asked!
She looks like a movie star.

262
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,893
One second.
Nurse!

263
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,662
She didn't get breakfast this morning.
What did I tell you?

264
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,069
Watch her.
Make sure she's fed.

265
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,912
It'll never work.

266
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,520
Hey! Haven't seen you in days.
How are you?

267
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,663
Carburetor's damaged.
I've already tried.

268
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,329
Whose is it?

269
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,493
It's junk.
Abandoned.

270
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:01,629
What's wrong with you?
You look like hell.

271
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,405
I've been working.

272
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,803
Why don't you give this another shot?

273
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,849
First one to fix this piece of junk keeps it.

274
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,679
I already have one.

275
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,444
I haven't seen you in 3 days.

276
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,841
Do you even care
if your mother is alive or dead?

277
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,943
I spent years worrying about your father, and
now you.

278
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,284
What have I done to deserve this?

279
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,756
Look how thin you've become.

280
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,725
You have to take care of yourself.

281
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,963
Go, wash your hands.

282
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,897
Pawan's still trying to fix
that rickshaw outside?

283
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,704
He's been working on it for days.

284
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,308
I told him it's missing a carburetor.

285
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,474
When will you give up that damn autorickshaw?

286
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,145
My brother still says
you can work at the post office.

287
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,951
More pay, less hours.

288
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:31,188
Then we can find a nice girl
to look after you.

289
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,946
Look, I got you this.

290
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,710
Try it on.

291
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,248
Why?

292
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,483
To see if it fits.

293
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,055
Why are you wasting money
on things I don't need?

294
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,494
What are you going to wear for Diwali?

295
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,324
You want to look your best at the temple.

296
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,732
Ma, please.

297
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,939
You haven't gone in over a year.
Come tomorrow.

298
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,635
No, Ma.

299
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,347
I'm working.

300
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:30,879
That autorickshaw killed your father
and will kill you too.

301
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:36,117
Every day I pray for a daughter-in-law
for both our sakes.

302
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,255
Do you know Sumitra Auntie's daughter-in-law
does everything for her?

303
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,663
She lives like a queen.

304
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,763
I ask for one small thing,
then I can go in peace.

305
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:53,438
Either way, what will you do
when the metro comes?

306
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,227
I told you not to touch the flowers!

307
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,402
Sorry, madam.

308
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,596
Are you okay?

309
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,899
I'm okay.

310
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,935
What the hell?

311
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,639
Sorry, brother.

312
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:44,205
Hey asshole, you didn't stop
ten minutes ago when you hit someone.

313
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,543
Can you hurry it up?

314
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,346
Stay out of this.

315
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,920
Amal, look what you did.

316
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,218
Look, look!
Look at the dent!

317
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,791
This'll cost a fortune.

318
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,761
Hello, sweetheart.

319
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,067
Your driver obviously doesn't know
what he's doing.

320
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,129
Why don't you come with me?

321
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,341
Raju, your passenger.

322
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,969
Hey! Sir!

323
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:19,345
Where the hell are you going?
You haven't paid!

324
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,427
Friend of yours?

325
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,633
What's going on, Amal?

326
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,678
I'm sorry about that, madam.

327
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,715
No, I mean with you.

328
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,347
What's wrong?

329
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,941
Nothing, madam.

330
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,011
You've never come close to an accident.

331
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,385
Don't lie to me.

332
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,357
It's nothing, madam.

333
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,586
Just tired.

334
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:07,620
You're working too hard.

335
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,174
What's wrong?

336
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,707
That...

337
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,243
That little girl...

338
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,879
who took your purse.

339
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,857
She...

340
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,189
She's still in the hospital.

341
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,626
Her bills...

342
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,790
You told me she was better.
Why did you lie to me?

343
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,700
Madam, I said she was improving.

344
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,567
You assumed she was okay.

345
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,453
How is she?

346
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,728
She'll be fine, madam.

347
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,764
These hospitals are all the same.

348
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,362
They'll take your money but neglect her.

349
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:26,000
I've taken care of it, madam.
She'll be okay.

350
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:29,739
But why are you taking care of her?
She's not your problem.

351
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,974
Don't worry about it, madam.

352
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,220
Sorry about the accident, madam.

353
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,619
Amal, I'm just trying to understand.

354
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:50,758
She's being looked after.
That's all that matters.

355
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,466
Don't worry about it.
See you tomorrow.

356
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,342
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, ma'am.

357
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,821
- Faster, faster, faster!
- Yes, madam.

358
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,730
- Turn right.
- Yes, madam.

359
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,234
You're too slow.

360
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,735
Sorry, madam.

361
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,362
End of the road.

362
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,165
- What's your problem?
- Sorry, madam.

363
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,870
What sorry?
I'm not paying.

364
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,309
Yes, madam.

365
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,810
Don't you care?
Money is everything.

366
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,214
No kidding.

367
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,746
- She getting on your nerves?
- Who?

368
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,790
That bi...
Your movie star.

369
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,552
You talk too much.

370
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,459
I'm not a mute like you.

371
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:02,232
So tell me...
When are you going to tell her you like her?

372
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,357
Quiet.

373
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,094
Wimp.

374
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm looking for a rickshaw driver
named Amal Kumar.

375
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,490
I don't know him.

376
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,163
There's another rickshaw stand here
and over there, right?

377
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,565
Yeah.

378
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,738
Go that way.

379
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,380
<i>You know any Amal Kumar?</i>

380
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,550
Yeah, that guy there.

381
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,657
That guy?

382
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,675
Hey.

383
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:27,903
Yes, sir.

384
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:32,608
I'm looking for a rickshaw driver
named Vijay Kumar. You know him?

385
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,844
That's my father, sir.

386
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,553
Vijay Kumar's your father?

387
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,918
Yes, sir.

388
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,222
You're free?

389
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,486
Of course, sir.
Come.

390
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,719
- Take me to Raj Ghat?
- Yes, sir.

391
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,026
- How much?
- Meter rate, sir.

392
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,326
Okay.

393
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,601
You always use the meter?

394
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,009
Yes, sir.

395
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,278
Nobody else does.
They're all bloody crooks.

396
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,775
What's your name?

397
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,619
Amal Kumar, sir.

398
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,619
How is your father?

399
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,225
He passed away, sir.

400
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,354
Sorry, sorry.

401
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,599
This is a nice rickshaw.

402
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,134
Thank you, sir.

403
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:28,968
My father spent years saving up for this.

404
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,270
I owe it to him to maintain it.

405
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,609
Where do you live?

406
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,740
Near Chattarpur Mandir, sir.

407
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,681
I see.

408
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,277
You have running water?

409
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,912
Sir?

410
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,957
And?
You have a family?

411
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,652
Live with my mother, sir.

412
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,318
No wife and kids?

413
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,657
No, sir.

414
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,753
Why not?

415
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,263
No time, sir.

416
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,993
No way.

417
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,501
Fine, I'll find you a nice girl.

418
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,332
Sir, that's exactly what my mom tells me.

419
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,376
She would say that.

420
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,650
Whose photo is that?

421
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,084
Sir?

422
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,116
My father, sir.

423
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,493
So, the metro is starting up.
What'll happen to all you rickshaw wallahs?

424
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,257
We'll see, sir.

425
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,162
So what do you do after work,
at night?

426
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,531
Nothing, sir.

427
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,331
Nothing?

428
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,298
Friends, parties, nothing?

429
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:38,898
No.

430
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,539
Just work, that's it?

431
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,242
You're content?

432
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,645
Yes, sir.

433
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,646
Well, then God's been good to you.

434
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:02,196
Sir, tell me how you knew my father.

435
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,098
Ah... it's not important.

436
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,305
My friend Amal.

437
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,364
Here you go.

438
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,068
Thank you, sir.

439
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,509
No, thank you.

440
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,773
Sir...

441
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,441
What's your name?

442
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:01,314
The tests show there's bleeding inside
and it may be getting worse.

443
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,851
She needs urgent surgery.

444
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,183
I thought she was getting better.

445
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,350
Two chais.

446
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,516
See, Amal...

447
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:14,224
Sometimes head traumas improve on their own.

448
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,892
But this isn't the case.

449
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,560
Sometimes she looks okay,

450
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,696
other times she drifts in and out
of consciousness.

451
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,469
We need to operate,
but it doesn't look good.

452
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,737
Why?

453
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:31,474
It's a very expensive procedure.

454
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,745
Whatever you've done for her,
I know it's been difficult.

455
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,314
But...

456
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,723
I can waive the hospital and doctor fees.

457
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:49,424
But medicines, tests,
the kind of care she needs, is expensive.

458
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,724
Maybe 50,000.

459
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,860
It's in God's hands now.

460
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,270
Give me a few days.

461
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:02,308
Will she be okay if we wait that long?

462
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,209
Sure.
We'll monitor her in the meantime.

463
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:16,821
- How was school?
- Good.

464
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,690
How's the play coming along?

465
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,161
I don't like it.

466
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,464
Can I speak with you?

467
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,258
Go ahead.

468
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,305
What can I do for you?

469
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,936
Sir, I hate to ask you,

470
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,446
but could I have an advance?

471
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,046
I'll work as long as you
want to pay you back.

472
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,984
How much do you need?

473
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:48,090
Well, I need 50,000.

474
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,086
50,000?

475
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,219
Sir, even 5, 10, 15.

476
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,729
Whatever you can give would be appreciated.

477
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,666
Even that's a lot to ask for.
You drive a rickshaw, not an airplane.

478
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,100
Yes, sir.

479
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,662
Tell me,
what do you need so much for?

480
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,264
Are you in trouble?

481
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,936
No, sir.
It's not for me.

482
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,002
Let me give you some advice.

483
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,538
I used to be like you.
Didn't have a care in the world.

484
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,983
All I wanted was to play the piano.

485
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,179
Never thought about the future.

486
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,214
I don't think you'll understand.

487
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,159
Find yourself a woman to take care of you.

488
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,857
Spare some change.

489
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,300
You have anybody else you can ask?

490
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:35,336
A few people, sir.

491
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:38,306
I like you Amal.
I'll see what I can do.

492
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,540
Thank you, sir.

493
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,907
Done?

494
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,086
Yes.

495
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,593
Who's that?

496
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,273
Who's that?

497
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,470
What was that noise?

498
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,779
Nothing,
I was just going to the washroom.

499
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,341
You woke me up.

500
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,250
Go.
Bring me some coffee.

501
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:48,982
You okay, Honey?

502
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,969
Kunal misses his mother.

503
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,334
He was asking me
where she's been these past few weeks.

504
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:20,906
So I told him a crazy old millionaire died,

505
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:25,718
so she can't spare any time for us.

506
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,747
Good, makes sense.

507
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,190
Now please let me work.

508
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,628
One more thing...

509
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:41,261
The guy who picks up Kunal
asked for an advance.

510
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,202
So, deal with it.

511
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,933
But he's asking for a lot.

512
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:51,344
Ram, how many times do I have to tell you?

513
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,882
Please, leave me alone.

514
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:18,035
<i>Amal, she's getting worse.</i>
<i>The longer we wait, the riskier it is.</i>

515
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:21,372
Sir, I'll get the money.

516
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,919
<i>What can I do for you, rickshaw wallah?</i>

517
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,193
<i>A young girl named Priya works for you.</i>

518
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,166
She was hurt in a car accident.

519
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:48,135
I told you don't touch the cauliflower.

520
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,128
So what do you want me to do?

521
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,800
She needs money for an operation.

522
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,877
- How much?
- 50,000.

523
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,607
I have hundreds of people working for me,

524
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:02,515
and I don't cover their medical expenses.

525
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:06,043
And you should know better
than to ask for so much money.

526
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:09,114
Sir, she'll die without your help.

527
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,352
So?

528
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,259
Sir, you can't just let her die.

529
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,330
Keep working!

530
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:22,537
Sir, what if I borrowed the money from you,
in my name?

531
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,735
Is she related to you?

532
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,642
She's a friend, sir.

533
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,612
So you want to borrow the money.

534
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,619
<i>Do you have any collateral?</i>

535
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,823
You own your rickshaw?

536
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:53,357
You give me your rickshaw,
you'll get your money.

537
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,873
<i>Fine then.</i>

538
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,477
Shall I call a rickshaw for you?

539
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,620
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

540
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,425
I'm not the one who's worried.

541
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,489
Why are you doing this for me,
rickshaw wallah?

542
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,031
What do you mean?

543
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,537
The doctor told me everything.

544
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,839
When I was your age,

545
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,884
my father was sick.

546
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:37,470
I hope your father feels better.
I'll pray for him.

547
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:42,209
You'll be okay.
That's what matters.

548
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:46,040
You have a good doctor.

549
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,974
It's in God's hands.

550
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,749
It's time.

551
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,736
Clean them and put them back up.

552
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,317
Hi, sweetheart.

553
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:44,875
Where's Amal?

554
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,617
I've taken over his accounts.

555
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,786
For how long?

556
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,524
That depends on you, sweetheart.

557
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,776
I keep asking you,
why can't you give me a stamp?

558
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,817
What's the passport code?

559
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,282
Give me five stamps.

560
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,362
Excuse me.

561
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,600
Do you know where Amal Kumar lives?

562
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,465
Straight ahead.

563
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,765
Thanks.

564
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:46,908
Yes?

565
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,542
Hello.

566
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:53,679
Yes.

567
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,122
He...

568
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,355
I haven't seen him in days.

569
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,420
He's not driving anymore.

570
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:05,365
He took a job at the post office.

571
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,402
And you are...

572
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,027
I'm Pooja.

573
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,631
He...

574
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,469
His rickshaw...

575
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,876
You left something in his rickshaw?

576
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,438
No, no.
He...

577
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,715
Why don't you come in.

578
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,847
Come.

579
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,861
Yes, sir?

580
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:48,994
I need you to take me to
the rickshaw wallah's house

581
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,163
at 6:00 am tomorrow.

582
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,399
Yes, Sir.

583
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,872
Can I get some chai?

584
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,806
There's no water, sir.

585
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,405
Fine.

586
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,496
Hi.

587
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:01,134
- Hungry?
- No, Ma.

588
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,576
How was work?

589
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,473
Good.

590
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:11,918
Uncle said if I keep working hard,
he'll promote me to drive a delivery van.

591
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,413
Really?

592
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,390
Want to go to the temple tomorrow?

593
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,789
Sure, Ma.

594
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,328
Maybe I can get you married?

595
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,920
Sure, Ma.

596
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,000
Tired?

597
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,282
I hate rubbing feet.

598
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,685
When your father and I first got married,

599
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:49,856
he would come home every night
with bloody, blistered feet.

600
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:54,292
After I wrapped them,
he would fall asleep.

601
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:56,490
What was wrong with his feet?

602
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:01,696
All rickshaw pullers had sore feet
after running all day.

603
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:06,933
I kept telling him to buy an autorickshaw.
We could afford it.

604
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,278
But he only got one after you were born.

605
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:14,145
Why did he wait so long,
if he suffered so much?

606
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,741
That's the way he was.

607
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,179
He was obsessed with hard work.

608
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:25,652
You're exactly like your father.

609
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,159
Both stubborn...

610
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,530
fools.

611
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,179
Hi, Amal.

612
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:53,854
Your mother and I have something for you.

613
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,984
Open it.

614
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,162
A carburetor.

615
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,759
It's the right part?

616
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,895
Yes, but...

617
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,396
You don't like it?

618
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,942
It's not that.

619
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,204
It's a gift.

620
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:19,645
Madam, I can't accept this.

621
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,548
Amal, please.

622
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:26,179
I'm sorry for the trouble, madam.

623
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,120
But I can't take this.

624
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,384
Why not?

625
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,426
Ma, I can't.

626
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,157
How can you afford this?

627
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,667
I had some savings.

628
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,730
But this is expensive.

629
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,878
Amal, I was saving up for my dowry.

630
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,187
Take it.

631
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,381
Thank you.

632
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,603
What are you crazy?

633
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:08,155
Thakur-Saab just wanted to remind you
that your debt is due tomorrow.

634
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,056
Don't be late, understand?

635
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,721
I'm sorry about the little girl.

636
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,715
She was so feisty.

637
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:21,695
I'll never forget her.

638
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,155
She deserved better.

639
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:30,203
Whatever happens is God's will.

640
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,707
<i>What is it?</i>

641
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,176
I was thinking about my father.

642
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:47,745
He was sick a long time ago.

643
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:52,551
We needed money for treatment.

644
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:56,294
Ma said we should sell the rickshaw.
It would have been enough.

645
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:00,061
My father said no,
the rickshaw was for Amal,

646
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,729
no matter what happened to him.

647
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,902
Papa said it was God's will he was sick.

648
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:09,136
And when he died,

649
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,074
Ma said it was God's will he die.

650
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:16,615
I never understood
how they could say that until now.

651
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:26,050
Believe it or not,
I know what you mean.

652
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:31,654
You know,
I was saving that money for years.

653
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:36,359
But I'm not sure I ever would have spent it.

654
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,105
Bring the car around.

655
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,863
Have some tea.

656
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:39,059
Cookie?

657
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,734
Not working yet?

658
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,033
You're missing Ganesh-ji's blessing.

659
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,839
Now try it.

660
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,010
Now try.

661
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,550
Ma.

662
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:58,313
Just try it!

663
01:25:58,386 --> 01:25:59,853
Come.

664
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,395
See?

665
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:17,237
Pooja's had a long night.
Drop her home.

666
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,404
Come.

667
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,073
Thank you, Auntie.

668
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,707
Please come visit, anytime.

669
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,543
I will, Auntie.

670
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:08,221
Where's Suresh?

671
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,586
I don't know.

672
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:12,592
I was supposed to drive him somewhere
at 6:00 am,

673
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,821
but he's not here.

674
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:20,726
Has he been okay these past few days?

675
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,394
He seemed okay.

676
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,898
Where were you taking him?

677
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,591
It drives well.

678
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,430
You fixed it nicely.

679
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:58,596
It only has to last a few years.

680
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,279
I rode the metro this week.

681
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:15,179
Things are changing.

682
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:19,215
I'll probably have to get a taxi
when this goes.

683
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:29,134
I thought you dropped my account
because of what I said to you.

684
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:34,239
Madam...

685
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:38,211
I would have never dropped this account
by choice.

686
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,875
I'll see you at 5:30 today?

687
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:48,652
Sure, 5:30.

688
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:13,577
Is this Amal Kumar's place?

689
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:17,607
Yes, but he's working.

690
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:19,277
Where?

691
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,320
He was here earlier.

692
01:29:57,492 --> 01:30:00,393
It's 3:00 o'clock.

693
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:03,589
He'd be picking up kids from school now.

694
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,824
What school?

695
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:09,759
Sacred Heart.

696
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:12,363
Come on.

697
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:53,778
Ram, why didn't you tell me
Kunal's driver's name was Amal?

698
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:57,716
<i>Honey, you never asked.</i>
<i>I hired him six months ago.</i>

699
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:03,214
If Amal gets there before me,
keep him there, understand?

700
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,158
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
<i>And Harish is here.</i>

701
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:07,888
Keep him in the living room.

702
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,327
Can't you go faster?

703
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:23,505
- Hi, Mom.
- Go inside.

704
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:25,905
Yes, Madam.

705
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:28,040
Come inside, please.

706
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:30,276
I'm sorry I wasn't around for a few days.

707
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:31,818
No no no! Not for that.

708
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:34,912
It's something else really important.
Please come inside.

709
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,320
Madam, I'm in a hurry.

710
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,051
So am I.

711
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,688
I'm...

712
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:43,161
G.K. Jayaram's lawyer.

713
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:49,560
Um, you drove him about a month ago.

714
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:50,865
Remember?

715
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:52,669
No?

716
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:58,136
He was really angry...
a little crazy.

717
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,605
Had a beard.

718
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:03,382
No?

719
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,553
Cough drops!

720
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:11,148
You gave him some cough drops.

721
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:14,223
Remember?

722
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,220
Oh yeah.

723
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,356
Listen, I really have to run.

724
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:19,865
I'm also in a rush.

725
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:22,903
Please, I told you
it'll only take a few minutes.

726
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:25,632
Please, please.

727
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,298
Quickly.

728
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:29,575
Don't worry.
I won't hurt you.

729
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:34,037
No, get lost.

730
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:44,487
Madam, can this wait until Monday?

731
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,550
No, it can't.

732
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:50,129
Come.

733
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,360
I can't believe it.

734
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:59,066
You came here every day
and I had no idea.

735
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,941
How long have you been a rickshaw driver?

736
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:04,477
Fifteen years.

737
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:06,178
Really?

738
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:09,908
Have a seat.

739
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:15,250
Come.

740
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,919
Amrita, wait outside.

741
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:21,018
Give me the key.

742
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:23,794
Don't let anyone in.

743
01:33:24,298 --> 01:33:26,163
Close the door.

744
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:27,723
Come.

745
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:36,368
You probably have no idea.

746
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,607
G.K. Jayaram passed away.

747
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:41,812
Oh.

748
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:44,884
Please sit.

749
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:58,031
Mr. Jayaram wanted me
to give you this letter before we talk.

750
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,794
He wrote it for you.

751
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:08,706
Read it carefully.

752
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,609
We'll talk after.
You can ask me anything.

753
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:47,905
I know it seems strange.

754
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:52,583
Now you can ask me anything.

755
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,782
Take your time.

756
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,255
Look...

757
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:04,825
whatever we talk about is just between us.

758
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:13,397
We'll need you to sign some papers.
Hmm?

759
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:15,598
Your autograph.

760
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,368
Do you have any family?

761
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:21,778
What is it?

762
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:32,057
One second.

763
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,027
No. Suresh Gupta...

764
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:44,597
I haven't seen him in days.

765
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:49,671
No, we spoke on the phone last night.

766
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,715
Hold one second.

767
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,509
It's important.

768
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:01,555
Uh, give me one minute, okay?

769
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:09,588
Take him to the living room.
Get him some chai.

770
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:12,523
I'll be right there.

771
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:20,067
No, you keep it.
It's yours.

772
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,583
Have a seat.
I'll get your chai.

773
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,401
Amal, everything okay?

774
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:53,872
Yes, sir.

775
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:55,966
You'll pick up Kunal on Monday?

776
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:57,203
Yes, sir.

777
01:36:57,278 --> 01:37:01,305
Please tell Madam I'll see her then.

778
01:37:01,382 --> 01:37:02,815
I have to run.

779
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:04,111
Sure.

780
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,777
See you.

781
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:38,111
Spare some change.

782
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:45,383
I have pencils,
but I'm out of paper.

783
01:38:17,224 --> 01:38:19,590
Stop! Stop!

784
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,628
Hey, what's wrong?

785
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:26,729
That autorickshaw driver gave me this paper.

786
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,668
But there's something written on it.
You think it's something important?

787
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,330
What difference does it make?

788
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:34,931
Amal can't read.

789
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,355
Where's Amal?

790
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:06,459
