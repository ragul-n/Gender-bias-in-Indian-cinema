1
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,792
The year was 1992.

2
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,292
This story began then.

3
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,542
When the TV serials haven't
come to the Bengali houses.

4
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,292
Televisions had no dish antenna.

5
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,917
There were no mobile phones.

6
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:23,208
Bengalis' spend their time
in a lazy manner.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,833
Life was worry less and stressfree.

8
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:40,500
(screaming sound)

9
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,333
(baby crying)

10
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,542
Who is Dr. Nandalal Ganguly?

11
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,500
That's me.

12
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,292
Congratulations! It's a boy.

13
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,167
Got saved, huh?

14
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,375
You are lucky.

15
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,083
You're going to father a son.

16
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,417
Otherwise, these days
a daughter ...

17
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,750
...comes with huge expenses.

18
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,958
You would've raised her
with all you've got...

19
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:41,417
...and she would've eloped with
some random guy someday.

20
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,708
It would've been the
end of your life.

21
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,708
Also, the end of
your bank balance.

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,958
None would've been there
to take care of you.

23
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,417
That's why I said
you got saved.

24
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,125
Hail the almighty!

25
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,875
(baby crying)

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,417
Sorry, we had a mistake.

27
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,542
It's a girl.

28
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,875
She was so restless after birth
that we all got confused.

29
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,500
Oh, no!

30
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,875
Hail the almighty!

31
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,208
The story is about this girl.

32
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,667
Who was a delight to
the entire Krishnanagar.

33
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,458
Stop it! This is no TV serial.

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,500
Yes. This is my story.

35
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,833
So, I'll be telling the rest.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,083
The story began in 1992.

37
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,167
Now I'm at 10th grade.

38
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,667
The story has moved forward.

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,292
This story is a bit old.

40
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,542
The story started
long ago.

41
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,375
No, no...not that old though.

42
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,333
I'm talking about
the year of 2008.

43
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,625
Yes. The story started from here.

44
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,458
The house you see here, is mine.

45
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,833
(television voiceover)

46
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,583
And this is my room.

47
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,500
Oh! I forgot to tell you my name.

48
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,625
It's Nandini.

49
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,250
Nandini Ganguly.

50
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,792
Class 10 of
Krishnanagar Missonary school.

51
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,083
That's my dad.

52
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,958
Dr. Nandalal Ganguly.

53
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,083
He's well-known
in entire Krishnanagar.

54
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,333
My dad has two other interests
apart from medicines.

55
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,333
One is...

56
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,000
(starts singing)

57
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,417
Singing and recording Tagore's songs
with wrong lyrics.

58
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:26,667
And making his poor patients
listen to those.

59
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,042
How do you like
this Tagore's song?

60
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,375
But...this is written by Nazrul.

61
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,667
Oh, really?

62
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,583
I don't remember
recording Nazrul's song.

63
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,917
Whatever...

64
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,125
...how do you like
my singing?

65
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,917
It sounded a bit out of tune.

66
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:45,792
What?

67
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:46,958
Out of tune?

68
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,333
You won't get
any medicines now on.

69
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:48,875
Leave!

70
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,458
No...I was trying to say...

71
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,250
...not out of tune at all.

72
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,125
Yes...yes.

73
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:58,292
Even Tagore couldn't have sung
this so perfectly.

74
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,750
-Isn't it?
-Right you're.

75
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,833
-Okay, okay.
-He's right.

76
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,833
None of you have to pay today.
Go now.

77
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,542
This nature of my father
didn't let...

78
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,792
...our house
become four storied.

79
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,292
It ended in two storied.

80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,417
My father thinks that
every doctor...

81
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,833
...should discover
a drug on his own.

82
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,292
So, his second interest is
discovering medicines.

83
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,958
Oh, no!
Nanda...Nanda...

84
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,250
Yeah. You guessed it right.

85
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,125
Whenever my father
steps in trouble...

86
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,250
...he calls for Nanda.

87
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,375
That's my mom.

88
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:40,042
You must have heard of
fish fry, chapatis, vegetable Paella etc...

89
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,042
But no...

90
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,125
...my mother
never cooks all these.

91
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:48,292
She cooks fish chapatis,
fried curry, fish-bone veggies etc.

92
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,292
and pumpkin ice-cream as dessert.

93
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,875
And we have to eat them.

94
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,208
What happened?
Come for lunch.

95
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,208
Yes...the food is here.

96
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,792
Today's special menu.

97
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,208
Fish-bone pickle!
My invention.

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,208
Execellent!

99
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Come on, eat.

100
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,583
This is my family.

101
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,250
Whatever parents do
is always right.

102
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,792
But whatever I do is a disaster.

103
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,917
(television voiceover)

104
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,375
Hey!

105
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:23,833
How are you sitting?

106
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,417
-Look at your posture.
-Damn it!

107
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,000
Why do you always
behave like boys?

108
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,292
You're a grown up girl.
Learn some etiquette.

109
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,708
Sit properly.

110
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:34,458
What the hell...

111
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,667
Damn it!

112
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
How many times
I've told you...

113
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,125
...girls never whistle like this.

114
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,625
What will people say?

115
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,792
-Catch...
-Oh God!

116
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,333
They'll say a mother failed to identify
her daughter's talent.

117
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,792
Oh God!

118
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,167
Take one of this
after breakfast.

119
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,833
Another one in the evening.

120
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,208
And the third one...

121
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,792
The prescription is this way.

122
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:06,875
What are you looking at?

123
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,292
Umm...doctor...

124
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,792
...I'm still having loose motion.

125
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,000
I think it happened again.

126
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,125
-Mom, my tiffin...
-Yes...here you go.

127
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,417
Give me your bag.

128
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,375
I told you so many times
to learn cooking from me.

129
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,625
I've no interest in your cooking.

130
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,500
What?

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,458
Anyways,
be attentive in your exams.

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,250
Here you go.

133
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,542
Don't fight with anyone in school.
Keep it in mind.

134
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:36,417
Look at her...

135
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,125
-Goodbye.
-Yes, bye.

136
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,583
I not only run the house...

137
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,917
...but the school too.

138
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,250
That's why everyone loves me.

139
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,583
And fears me too.

140
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,792
What a shame Dr. Nanda...

141
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:01,917
This incident happened for the first time
in last 55 years in our school.

142
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,500
That's great.

143
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
You know what...

144
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:11,292
I invented cheating in
the history of medical college.

145
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,792
I'm proud of you, dear.

146
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,167
Go, see a movie.

147
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,417
(singing)

148
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,542
What's up dude?

149
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:43,625
Never saw a girl riding a bike?

150
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,375
Come on.
Wanna race?

151
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,375
Come on...come.

152
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,042
That's why girls should
stay in their limits.

153
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,000
This is the 17th time now.

154
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,958
This is the 17th scar
on my body.

155
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,542
But what to do...

156
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:06,542
I can't sit at home scared
like those foolish girls.

157
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,792
So, I went to my sister's wedding
with a scar on my head.

158
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,750
The light is not good here.
Let's go to that side.

159
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,500
Yeah. Let's go.

160
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,750
That way sister.

161
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,375
Whatever they demanded
I'm giving it all.

162
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,458
I'm giving it all
to my daughter and son-in-law.

163
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,792
100 carat of gold,
a new car, new handset.

164
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,542
After all, that boy is
a government officer.

165
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,000
An officer or a beggar?

166
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,000
Is this a marriage
or shopping?

167
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,333
Who is this guy?
Charging so much to get married...

168
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,750
I must see him.

169
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,208
Hi...

170
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,875
Oh God! Yuck!

171
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:13,042
I understood one thing
after seeing my sister's husband.

172
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,708
When a girl gets married...

173
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,042
...no one asks her
what she wants.

174
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,333
Everyone only listens
to the boy.

175
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,583
I got upset seeing
my sister's wedding.

176
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,167
I decided not to get married
ever in my life.

177
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:32,167
Then I went there
where I secretly go to find joy.

178
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,333
To my doll maker aunt.

179
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,708
Hi there,
Priyanka Chopra...

180
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,250
-I'll thrash you.
-Why so?

181
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,917
What's the matter?

182
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,708
It's been 7 days
I haven't heard from you.

183
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,792
You don't care about me at all.

184
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,875
Now you're showing me
concerns huh?

185
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:57,583
You look more adorable
when you're angry.

186
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:04,958
If I was a boy
I would've abducted you.

187
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,458
And people would say
Romeo took Juliet away.

188
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,667
Shut up!

189
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,542
Trying to butter me, huh?

190
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,292
You've made some mess, right?

191
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,417
No mess.
I've some news.

192
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,125
What kind of news?

193
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,500
A good news and
a bad news.

194
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,083
Which one you want
to hear first?

195
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,625
-Bad one.
-Someone will get murdered.

196
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,125
And the good one?

197
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,167
My sister will be
a widow before her marriage.

198
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,208
Oh God!

199
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,000
You should not say all these.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,250
Listen, sister's marriage
is all set to happen.

201
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,208
And I'll murder her husband
before the marriage.

202
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,042
That's it.

203
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,292
Don't say such bad words.

204
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,792
You're a grown up now.

205
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,167
What is the point of growing up?
Tell me.

206
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:48,708
Anyways my parents will set me off
with a bald, fat govt. employee.

207
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,625
And I'll be spending my whole life
checking out his bald head.

208
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,250
Let it be...

209
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,458
You can't be so picky.

210
00:12:56,667 --> 00:13:00,000
You've to select someone
for marriage.

211
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,375
Believe me aunt...

212
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,333
...I have no wish to marry.

213
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,458
Can't anyone spend their life
without getting married?

214
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,292
Look how well you're doing.

215
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,792
Did anyone ever force you
for marriage?

216
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,875
Umm...no one forced me...

217
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,208
...but someone promised
to marry me.

218
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,667
Then? The marriage didn't happen?

219
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,333
I waited for marriage
since childhood.

220
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:37,958
But he...

221
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,958
...went to have
a family of his own.

222
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
And I got busy
with my work.

223
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:46,250
You should've slapped him...

224
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,250
Don't comment on
what you don't know.

225
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,167
Okay. Sorry.

226
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,542
Tell me aunt...
do you like living alone?

227
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,667
I don't like living alone.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,583
That's why I look
for my little evil girl.

229
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,250
But you're old enough now.

230
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,750
You must find
someone special now.

231
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,333
Love and all is bogus to me.

232
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,250
But there's no way out.

233
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,083
You must find someone...

234
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:22,875
...with whom you'll feel
you own the world.

235
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,167
That day I decided...

236
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,333
...I'll listen to my aunt's advice...

237
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,042
...and I'll find my soulmate.

238
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,625
Hello, Nandini.

239
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:42,500
I searched the entire school
but couldn't find my soulmate.

240
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,375
No one was worthy of me.

241
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:49,333
Except only one...

242
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,167
Rahul...Rahul Biswas.

243
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,583
He was the hero
of our school.

244
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,500
I've heard
his father is a doctor too.

245
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:23,083
All: GOAL! Yes...

246
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,208
(singing)

247
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,750
Rahul was quite worthy of me.

248
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,458
He had a good physique.

249
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,042
He was handsome also.

250
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,875
He also had a nice hairstyle.

251
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,625
He came to
propose me earlier...

252
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,542
...but I didn't give him
much attention.

253
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,792
Considering my aunt's advice...

254
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,625
...I don't think
I did the right thing that day,

255
00:15:54,833 --> 00:16:00,250
So I decided
to rectify my mistake.

256
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,625
Here you go.

257
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,458
Hi, Rahul...

258
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,458
Dead.

259
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,625
Hi...

260
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:18,792
This chain you made
is really nice.

261
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,167
I didn't make it.
It can be bought.

262
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,417
Then you're good
at gluing it.

263
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,042
Your father is a doctor, right?

264
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:40,625
Dr. Chabi Biswas
told me clearly...

265
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,875
...that I've to study medicines
after joint entrance.

266
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,875
Listen...

267
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:48,750
...you'll also sit for
joint entrance, right?

268
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,708
Hmm.

269
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:53,250
That day, I went to talk to you
about something important.

270
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,833
Tell me...I want to hear too.

271
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,375
I like you.

272
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,542
No, not today.

273
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:10,875
Answer me on the day of love.

274
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,042
What do you mean?

275
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,792
On the day of
'Saraswati Pujo'.

276
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,500
-Go, call sir.
-Hmm.

277
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,958
Hail Goddess Saraswati...

278
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,833
These schoold girls are
looking really hot, huh?

279
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,708
Hey, hot chicks...

280
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,708
...care to answer?

281
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,292
Can we get that?

282
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,458
Hey...Nandini...

283
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,417
Look, she's coming this way.

284
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,458
See her attitude...

285
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,500
Done with the offering ritual?

286
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,917
Umm...no...

287
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,417
What about you people?

288
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,917
Hail to the Goddess Saraswati...

289
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,542
Let her divine light
shine upon us...

290
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:04,458
The Goddess looks upon all
and blesses all too...

291
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,500
A woman is being
worshipped today.

292
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,167
How can you disrespect
a woman on this day?

293
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,417
You should respect women.

294
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,875
You better not insult them again.

295
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,417
Let's leave...

296
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,958
Good those boys left.

297
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,125
It's awful to fight
on such a holy occasion.

298
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:51,000
-Let it be.
-Hmm...

299
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,875
What did you decide, Nandini?

300
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,083
You know, Rahul...

301
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,667
...liking someone is
a very special feeling.

302
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,125
But I'm sorry, Rahul.

303
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:06,083
...you just make me feel angry.
Nothing else.

304
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:10,167
I don't think you know
what is it like to feel special.

305
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,917
-Come on. Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

306
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,417
Hey...come,
take the back seat.

307
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,833
Don't wait in this heat.

308
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,875
Move away.
Let sister sit.

309
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,792
I hope you didn't mind me
calling you sister.

310
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,417
Would you like babes then?
Come on babes.

311
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,250
Come...she wants to thrash me!
I am so scared now...

312
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:47,875
Come on babes.
Our bike has enough space.

313
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,000
Come on...

314
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,375
Hey...that's Abir.
Don't you know him?

315
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,833
What's going on here?
Get lost.

316
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,750
Go home.

317
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,167
Wait for me.
Oh, God...

318
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,333
For the first time
I missed my school bus that day.

319
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,083
So I was waiting
at the bus stand.

320
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,000
But that day onwards...

321
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,250
...I started skipping
the bus intentionally.

322
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,708
Just to see him once.

323
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,042
My dad gave me a new phone.

324
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,542
But other people used it
more than me.

325
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,042
Hello...

326
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:02,667
Hello...

327
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:07,125
I had no idea that the phone
was for me or Nitu?

328
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,917
She's always busy flirting.

329
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:14,500
She can't sleep if she doesn't
flirt with boys everyday.

330
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,667
Dona is exactly opposite of her.

331
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:20,542
She gets cranky without food.

332
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:26,542
How come these two weirdos
became my best friend, I had no idea.

333
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,250
But I was thinking about
only one person.

334
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,250
Duryodhana had Shakuni
as his adviser.

335
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,542
Whereas, Arjuna had Lord Krishna...

336
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,083
...but where is my adviser
in this Krishnanagar?

337
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,708
Hey, what's wrong with you?

338
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,083
Why do you look so upset?

339
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:47,792
Yes!

340
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,792
My brother Raja...

341
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,417
...we're relatives.

342
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:54,583
One can never
get enough of him.

343
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,375
Till now, he has done
all he can.

344
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,833
He lied to skip school,
stole money from his father...

345
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:05,042
...got caught with his friend's bike,
flirts with girls randomly.

346
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:09,000
Planning new business ideas
and wasting his father's money on that.

347
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,708
He was such a menace
that our family abandoned him.

348
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:17,500
But he was
my only way out.

349
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,000
Divide it among all of you.

350
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,042
If there's any problem
just take my name.

351
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:22,875
-What is that?
-Gaja...

352
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,042
That's your father, Idiot!

353
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:24,667
I am Raja.

354
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,708
-Remember, it's Raja...go now.
-Yes, Raja...

355
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,208
All of you go...

356
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,667
Why are you here?

357
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,708
Does your father know
you're here?

358
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:35,958
-No.
-Oh no!

359
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,375
You'll get me in trouble.

360
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,042
Anuyways, hurry up! Speak out. I am...

361
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,375
...starting
my new business.

362
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,917
Again a new business?

363
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,792
This is more of
a national mission.

364
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,167
I'm the in-charge for
bringing the crowd in Brigades.

365
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,875
It's hell lot of money.
Hand to hand cash.

366
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,167
Why am I even lecturing you about
party-politics?

367
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,250
You don't know
a thing about all these.

368
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,167
Tell me now...

369
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:58,667
Remember, that guy
whom you were afraid of that day?

370
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,750
Who is he?

371
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,583
-That guy on bus stand?
-Yes...

372
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,208
Umm...he's name is Abir.

373
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,500
Abir...

374
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,833
He's not a boy.
He's a thug

375
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:18,458
Every single police station in Krishnanagar
has him in their wanted list.

376
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,542
Get it?

377
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,500
Just because
I respect his father...

378
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:25,625
...or else I would have
taught him a lesson long back.

379
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,167
Moron!

380
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,583
He's a thug?

381
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,042
Not just a thug...

382
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,833
...he's a no.1 fraud.

383
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,833
You want to know
what he did?

384
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,833
Go to any college
you'll see him there with his gang.

385
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,458
He beats anyone
who does any wrong.

386
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:44,750
He beats them like hell.
Breaks their jaws, kicks them in the chest...

387
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,667
Do you know
what's his real face?

388
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,000
He's a criminal.

389
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,542
He doesn't even
spare the cops.

390
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,875
Move! All of you move!

391
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,750
Because of his father...
what was that?

392
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,583
-Respect him?
-Yes...I respect him.

393
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,500
A very bad guy.
You won't talk to him.

394
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,083
Not at all...no...

395
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,583
Come on...move...

396
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,833
Abir? A thug?

397
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,375
What are you saying?

398
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,083
That day I called Abir
at the bus stand.

399
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,625
Do you know
how much he respects women?

400
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:30,292
Your brother Raja and his friends...

401
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:33,583
...they disturb us
everyday at the bus stand.

402
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,417
Abir is a good boy.

403
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,958
If every other boy was
like him then...

404
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:44,125
...there wouldn't have been
any assaults to women ever.

405
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,958
Here you go...

406
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,375
...30 bucks.

407
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,417
Here it is.

408
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,292
Okay.

409
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,000
Due to Abir...

410
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,333
...we poor people are
getting our daily bread.

411
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:11,958
Those mobbers ask for money.
They didn't let us work.

412
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:16,542
Because of Abir
they don't come here anymore.

413
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,875
Wait a minute...

414
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:28,250
Its parts are at fault.
It'll cost you around a thousand or two.

415
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:33,667
-This much money?
-That's a lot of work.

416
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,458
Okay, fine.

417
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,375
This is a regular issue now, doctor.

418
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,875
We pay a lot for drinking water.

419
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:46,042
The govt. will take
taxes, votes from us.

420
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:48,583
Why can't they give us
drinking water then?

421
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,125
I know.

422
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:54,417
I've had a talk with Abir
regarding this matter.

423
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:55,500
Okay.

424
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,833
He said he'll protest
on this matter.

425
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,750
Even his boys are ready too.

426
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,208
You all should go
and meet him.

427
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,375
Okay, fine then.

428
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,958
-I'll leave then, doctor...
-Yes...

429
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:07,958
Very smart...

430
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,292
I knew Rahul was like this.

431
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,500
But Abir?
No...no...

432
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,167
I'm sure he'll not be like this.

433
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:21,167
I am sure
I have recognised him well.

434
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,625
You also know Abir?

435
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,542
What do you mean?

436
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,667
-You know him too?
-Yes.

437
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,042
My brother is in his gym.

438
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,958
-Gym?
-Yeah...

439
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:37,083
No..no...it's like physical training.

440
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,583
Indian style...

441
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,292
Where's that?

442
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,333
Great physique, huh?

443
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,042
Gymnasium these days
are nothing new.

444
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,875
These is not some
new invention.

445
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:01,833
Remember, many years back
Indians used to practice physical workout.

446
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,875
Those new ways are
just like the old ones.

447
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,083
What is it?
You all here?

448
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,667
You all carry on.
I'll talk later.

449
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,083
-Very handsome...
-What?

450
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:26,083
I meant Swami Vivekanada...

451
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,375
No...I mean...umm...

452
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,542
...I came to take my brother.

453
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,417
You better take them forever.

454
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,042
Can't even do a single exercise.

455
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,917
Eats and sleeps all day.

456
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,792
I gave him an exercise
but he felt asleep.

457
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,458
What did he eat at breakfast?

458
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,833
Sandwich...two for me one for him.

459
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,292
I can see that very well.

460
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,417
All these junk foods!

461
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,958
These food habits are
ruining your generation.

462
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,875
Neither it strengthens your body
nor your mind.

463
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,458
And you girls are
responsible for this.

464
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,125
You won't cook these days
thinking it'll affect your beauty...

465
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,292
...you won't clean dishes
as it will break your nails...

466
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,333
I don't have nails, see...

467
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,958
That means you bite nails, right?

468
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,375
Not at all...

469
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,292
He just had
only one sandwich.

470
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:11,708
Silence!

471
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:14,083
You'll have junk foods
and watch television all day.

472
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,542
Feed them veggies first
then bring him here.

473
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,042
Veggies!

474
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,042
Have that medicine
I prescribed you.

475
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,833
Yes, you'll feel better by tonight.

476
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,833
If you don't,
I'll give you new medicine tomorrow.

477
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:29,417
Yes...

478
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,750
-I told you already...
-What took you so long?

479
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:35,833
Mom, what is the point of
watching this dumb soaps?

480
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:38,875
Can't you make some veggies?

481
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,667
Or chop them?

482
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,792
At least clean some dishes...

483
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:47,833
Okay, let it be.

484
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,792
You all sit and relax.
I'll do it all by myself.

485
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:36,167
Hey, what's wrong
with our girl?

486
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:39,042
Is she sick or what?

487
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,833
-Check her blood pressure once.
-Keep quiet...

488
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,583
I'll go and freshen up.

489
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,000
Don't touch my preparation.

490
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,458
What's the matter?

491
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,917
Isn't the food good?

492
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,583
-Good...
-Yeah, it's good...

493
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,167
But you know what, my dear?

494
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:26,917
Like all other works,
cooking needs to be practiced too.

495
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,042
This is also an art.

496
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,875
Whatever the work is
if you do it from your heart...

497
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:35,750
...you'll see the results
will always be good.

498
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:39,833
You'll gain as much as you'll give.

499
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,208
And if you aim for what you want...

500
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:48,792
...God will surely give you that.

501
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,583
-Hey...
-Where are you going?

502
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:15,417
Maybe I've seen you a little...

503
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:19,125
Maybe I've known you a little...

504
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,042
You may say days are like
flowers on the trees.

505
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,750
You may say
nights belong to the moon...

506
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:34,167
My playfulness
made me all yours...

507
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:42,083
My heart is lost
And so am I...

508
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:47,833
I wish to fly like a butterfly...

509
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,792
Why do you read
newspapers all day?

510
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:57,292
...All I want now is you.

511
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,042
Stop!

512
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:15,375
Here and there...

513
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:18,250
Give me the video caset
of 'Bad Boys 2'.

514
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:20,958
Hey, Abir!

515
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:28,250
Here and there I roam around.
My nights are all alone.

516
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:36,167
Nowadays my eyes
only look for you.

517
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:43,875
I spend my days
thinking about you.

518
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:51,583
My playfulness
made me all yours...

519
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:59,125
My heart is lost
And so am I...

520
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:06,833
I wish to fly like a butterfly...

521
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:16,458
...All I want now is you.

522
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:26,875
Without Abir's help my sister
couldn't have continued her studies.

523
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:35,875
If I don't decorate these dolls
then how will they....

524
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,708
Wait a minute.
Coming...

525
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,917
Where were you
all these days, Abir?

526
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,042
-Actually, mom was not well.
-How is she now?

527
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:55,750
Yes...

528
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,042
Listen, I don't have
good quality clay...

529
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,542
...I've so many orders pending.

530
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,083
Can you get me some
good quality clay?

531
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,042
Sure I'll bring you.

532
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:06,875
Come inside.

533
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,667
No I'm in a hurry.
I better go now.

534
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,958
-Goodbye.
-Okay, bye.

535
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,833
Who came, aunt?

536
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,667
-Whom were you talking too?
-It was Abir.

537
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,500
He's a very good boy.

538
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,792
He often comes to visit me.

539
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,042
He helps me
whenever I'm in trouble.

540
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,375
His mother is
like a friend to me

541
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,375
We were school mates.

542
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,792
His mother was
a bit senior to me, though.

543
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,250
Basundhara was a very good poet.

544
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,542
After finishing school
she got married.

545
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,917
Then...

546
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,083
...Abir's father passed away.

547
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,417
And Basundhara became widow.

548
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,917
They had a very tough life.

549
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,000
But you know what...

550
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,667
...when a child grows up
to a nice human being...

551
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,083
...a mother faces
no hurdles at all.

552
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,542
Abir is a such a good son...

553
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,958
...that Basundhara could manage it all.

554
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,792
I tell Abir many times...

555
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,583
...you're such a bright student...

556
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,542
...why don't you go to abroad?

557
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,500
Do you know
what he tells me?

558
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,583
"If everyone will go to abroad...

559
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,125
...then who will be there
for our country, aunt?"

560
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,375
For people like him...

561
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,375
...this country is still moving well.

562
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,750
Umm...aunt his mother
can start writing again.

563
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,625
I requested her many times.

564
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,875
But you know what...

565
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:56,375
...once creativity
gets suppressed by reality...

566
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,333
...it can never flourish again.

567
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,792
Basundhara can't write anymore.

568
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,833
If I had a daughter...

569
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,208
...I would have
wedded her to Abir.

570
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,417
-Do it then.
-Hmm?

571
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,333
Nothing...continue...

572
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,417
-Pass me that.
-Yes...

573
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,292
You have a cousin brother
named Raja, right?

574
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,375
He used to study with Abir.

575
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,667
A very notorious boy.

576
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:20,750
Brother Raja...!

577
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,500
You? Here?

578
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,042
By the way...my new business.

579
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,125
Again?

580
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,542
What do you mean by 'again'?

581
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,083
Listen to me carefully...

582
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,708
...all will end
only one thing will remain.

583
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:45,917
Internet.

584
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,375
3G, 4G, 5G, 6G...100G...

585
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,125
You can sit at your house
and do everything you want.

586
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,333
That day everyone will remember
only one name in Krishnanagar.

587
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,958
Raja and only Raja...

588
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,292
-Great!
-Yeah, it's my idea.

589
00:38:58,292 --> 00:38:58,833
How is it?

590
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,042
Oh, God!

591
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,208
What are they doing?
That's crime.

592
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:06,625
Shut up!

593
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,250
Is this crime?

594
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,125
They're just cherrishing
their love secretly.

595
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,292
How is that crime?

596
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,708
Have you gone mad?

597
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:16,750
Listen...

598
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,208
...I've built this place
for the welfare of the society.

599
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:23,042
Shah jahan's Qutb Minar...
sorry, Taj Mahal...

600
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,542
...just like Taj Mahal
my cafe will be famous too.

601
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,167
Take my word for it.

602
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,833
What did Vivekananda said?

603
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:32,208
What did he say?

604
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,417
The one who loves everyone...

605
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,750
Damn! Why am I saying all this to you?

606
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,167
Spill out what you came for...

607
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,208
I wanted to ask you something.

608
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:41,375
Sure. If I can't answer
I'll search for it on the internet.

609
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,083
You didn't tell me...

610
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,208
...that you and Abir
studied together in school.

611
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,125
No I was...

612
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,458
Again talking about Abir?

613
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:50,833
Again?

614
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,833
I told you
not to take his name.

615
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,542
Fine then.

616
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,708
I'll only speak
to the cops now.

617
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,792
My foolish sister...
I'll thrash you now.

618
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,083
Tell me...

619
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,958
You say...

620
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,542
Ask what you want to know...

621
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,708
If you and Abir
are such good friends...

622
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,750
...then why don't
he talks to you?

623
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,042
-Also why do you fear him?
-I fear no one.

624
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:14,375
Shut up...

625
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,208
-I have to go now.
-No, no, sit here. Don't scare me.

626
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,042
Actyally we have...

627
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,042
...a long history.

628
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:26,333
Our story is written on old pages
of a book called life.

629
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:30,000
The story of our friendship.

630
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,833
It was the time of spring...

631
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:37,000
...my life got ruined
as I and Abir became friends.

632
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:40,750
Though I had no idea
of the danger awaiting.

633
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,750
We two were having
the golden times of our lives.

634
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,375
Sorry...

635
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:47,750
...we three.

636
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,667
I, Abir...

637
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,375
...and that girl.

638
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:55,542
We three were great friends.

639
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,375
And he was
in love with that girl.

640
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,167
And I...

641
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,167
What? Love?

642
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,917
Abir's bike
had two seats then.

643
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,625
One for him...

644
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:12,208
...another one for his lover.

645
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:15,083
-Then?
-Then...

646
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,833
...like most of the love story...

647
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,583
...that girl ditched Abir
and married someone else.

648
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:22,750
That's it.

649
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,500
Abir was left heart-broken.

650
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,417
Why?

651
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:29,583
It was the girl who ditched him.
How is that your fault?

652
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,625
Fault...

653
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,583
The fault is not mine.

654
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,083
It was of my mother's.

655
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,458
You know,
who that girl was?

656
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,083
Who?

657
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,875
She was my cousin June.

658
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,042
-June?
-Yes.

659
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,750
I ate a lot at her wedding.

660
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,042
Really? Even I too.

661
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:55,833
Anyways...

662
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
After that
Abir went to his bike...

663
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:59,625
...took one seat...

664
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,458
...and threw it away.

665
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:11,500
-Oh, no...
-What happened?

666
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,750
-Huh?
-What happened?

667
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,958
Hey, what's wrong with the car?

668
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:18,125
This car is
again giving troubles.

669
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,875
Oh, God!
It had to happen now...

670
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,167
What went wrong?

671
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,792
Umm...I don't get it...

672
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,292
In the midway...what can I do?

673
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,875
This is why
I told you to keep a driver.

674
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:37,875
Oh, shut up!

675
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:42,250
If drivers knew everything
they would have been mechanics.

676
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,875
What's the point
being a driver then?

677
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,875
People talk nonsense
when they don't understand...

678
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,958
...the difference between
a doctor and a nurse.

679
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,958
-What?
-Let it be...

680
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:54,958
Go...you might have to
push the car.

681
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,625
Are you out of your mind?

682
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,542
You're telling me
to push the car?

683
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,667
There is no other way
to start the car.

684
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:01,667
You want me
to stand here all day?

685
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,083
Yes...stand here.

686
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,833
I have told you many times
to sell this car.

687
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,500
You two wait here
I'm leaving.

688
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,417
-Stop...how will you go so far?
-Where are you going?

689
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,917
-I'll walk.
-Hey...

690
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,167
Hurry up...do something.

691
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:18,042
Tired of this
same problem everyday...

692
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,167
Fix it right now...

693
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:23,333
Hey, doctor...

694
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,583
...what are you doing here?

695
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:25,833
Why all of you
are on the road?

696
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:29,083
Actually, the car is giving troubles.

697
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,542
We have an invitation to attend.

698
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,292
We're getting late for that...

699
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,833
...also I have some patients
to visit at night.

700
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,625
-A cab would have been better...
-Cab?

701
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,417
You won't get cabs
on this road.

702
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,167
Which way you were heading?

703
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,208
To Shantipur.

704
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,542
I'm also going to Shantipur.

705
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:44,083
Oh!

706
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,542
But my car is
not comfortable as yours.

707
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,542
No...this will do.

708
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,875
It's more important
to reach there.

709
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,083
You don't know...

710
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,542
...their entire family
suffers from asthma.

711
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,792
All of them are my patient.

712
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:58,000
So it's a matter yearly revenue.

713
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,083
Okay. Come with me then.

714
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,000
Have you gone crazy?

715
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,875
How can we go to
a wedding on this car?

716
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:09,750
I won't go...

717
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,833
Mom, you are too much at times...

718
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,167
He is helping us
and you have a problem with that too?

719
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,667
-Dad is right.
-Yeah...

720
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,167
Reaching there
is more important, right?

721
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,417
-Come on, let's go...
-Go...I'll lock the car and come.

722
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,083
Hey, you said
you're gonna walk...

723
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:48,583
I heard you stopped
a marriage in midway.

724
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:50,458
What was that case?

725
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,208
Don't ask...

726
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,250
That guy was taking dowry.

727
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:58,167
He also asked for gold.

728
00:44:58,167 --> 00:44:59,958
Thank God, I was there.

729
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,167
But what about the girl?

730
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,542
Her life got ruined.

731
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:06,958
Not at all.
She had a boyfriend.

732
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:07,542
I see...

733
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:10,125
Her father forced her
to marry that guy.

734
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,042
I called him
right then and there.

735
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,708
I asked him
he wants to marry her or not.

736
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,917
-He agreed right then.
-Oh...

737
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:20,292
I don't at all support
this dowry system.

738
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:23,625
Because of them
many poor girls are suffering.

739
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,417
Very true...

740
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:28,917
They don't even deserve
to stay in this society.

741
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:29,792
Absolutely.

742
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:32,042
As long as this country
has a man like you...

743
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,458
...there's nothing to worry about.

744
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:34,250
Yes...

745
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,125
Umm...so...

746
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,042
...I had something to tell you.

747
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,042
What happened?

748
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:54,375
Hey...stop...stop the car.

749
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,000
You've taken passangers
in a luggauge car?

750
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,917
Open the back door of your car.
What do you have in there?

751
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:03,708
Food for my cows.
Want to try some?

752
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,750
Hey...

753
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,792
...trying to crack a joke with me?

754
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:08,208
I'll put you behind the bars.

755
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:10,417
Do you have documents?
Show me...

756
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:19,667
Get down from the car.
Want an invitation?

757
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,917
-Huh?
-Call your senior.

758
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:22,958
Listen...

759
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:25,583
...I don't need my senior
to catch a bugger like you.

760
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,958
I'm enough alone.

761
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:29,417
Will you come out or
I'll have to force you?

762
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:30,708
Who is it, Madhav?

763
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,542
Sir, a guy named Abir.

764
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,375
He can't get down
from the car.

765
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,083
Let it be.
Don't create trouble.

766
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,708
-Huh?
-Let him go.

767
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,833
What's the matter, sir?

768
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,042
That was a terrific matter.

769
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,333
That boy is dangerous.

770
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,333
Once I asked for...you know...

771
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,792
He sent my picture to the S.P.

772
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:59,792
You should've said earlier
that you know the S.P.

773
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,125
-Can I go now?
-Sure.

774
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,708
Know about me
when you get time.

775
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,375
-Sure...why not...
-My name is Abir.

776
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:08,583
-Abir Banerjee.
-Oh, okay...

777
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:15,000
You knew the S.I ?

778
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,625
Yeah I know him
from a very long time.

779
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,542
We two got
into a small fight.

780
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,250
We both went inside.

781
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:24,333
I went to jail,
he to the hospital.

782
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:55,083
Listen, dad...

783
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,750
...how much dowry will you give
at my marriage?

784
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,250
What kind of a question is that?

785
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,917
All that we have is yours.

786
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,458
Then...he will get it all.

787
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,417
Listen...you won't give
a single penny to him.

788
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:11,333
Still, if he wants to marry...
marry him with mom. Go.

789
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,792
Turn off the TV and go to bed.
It's too late now.

790
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:19,458
You're listenning to
all fo these, huh?

791
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:30,250
The next SMS is from Nitu Roy
from Krishnanagar.

792
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,792
Nitu wrote-
"One of my friend named Nandini...

793
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:37,250
...can't tell her feelings
to her crush.

794
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,125
She is finding no way
to to convey her love.

795
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,333
How can I help her?"

796
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,458
You can't help her Nitu.

797
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,958
She has to express
her own feelings.

798
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,833
She has to be brave.

799
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:49,833
One more thing...

800
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,958
...even though
the loved one stays away...

801
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:54,292
...love never dies.

802
00:48:54,292 --> 00:48:56,500
It always stays with us.

803
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,792
Come on, Nandini.
Don't be scared.

804
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:04,167
Go and speak your heart out
to your loved one.

805
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:07,250
All of your problems
will go away.

806
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,042
The next song request
on 'Howrah Bridge' is from...

807
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,292
...Sayantan Mondal of Murshidabad.

808
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:18,292
That day I decided...

809
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,583
...I have to find
Abir's house.

810
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,792
I have to go to him.

811
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,167
I must tell him
about my feelings for him.

812
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:31,333
My sleeping postures
have always been irregular.

813
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,792
But from that day...

814
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:36,292
...my sleeping posture got changed.

815
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,583
Yes...you've to do
a blood test tomorrow.

816
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:53,625
Wait...wait a minute...

817
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,833
Hey, where are you going?

818
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,042
Umm...I'm going to
meet someone.

819
00:49:58,167 --> 00:49:59,458
No..no...it's getting clouded.

820
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,667
It'll rain soon.
No need to go out now.

821
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:04,333
I'll return before
it starts to rain.

822
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,042
I said no...!

823
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,458
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

824
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,542
Yes...tell me...

825
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,667
Sir, which way is Abir's house?

826
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,750
There...behind those lakes.

827
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:06,583
Hey, you...
What are you doing here?

828
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,792
Why are you
getting drenched?

829
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:28,917
Oh, girl...oh, girl
your beauty dazzels me...

830
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:38,875
Your face glows
with the touch of the sun...

831
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, girl...oh, girl
your beauty dazzels me...

832
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,833
Your face glows
with the touch of the sun...

833
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:57,708
The look in your eyes
arises urges in my heart...

834
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:02,958
Your dark eyes
are like a moonless night...

835
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:08,167
Spread your wings and
fly my girl...

836
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:13,042
The rustling winds
awaits for you...

837
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:18,000
Spread your wings and
fly, my girl...

838
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,042
The rustling winds
awaits for you...

839
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,708
It's hard these days
to find a girl like her.

840
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:29,667
What a transformation!
Straight a topper?

841
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,667
Come, my dear...come...

842
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:37,292
My lonely heart
waits for your arrival...

843
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:42,167
Come on now
before the buds of May shed...

844
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:47,083
My lonely heart
waits for your arrival...

845
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:51,667
Come on now
before the buds of May shed...

846
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:56,500
The look in your eyes
arises urges in my heart...

847
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:02,083
Your dark eyes
are like a moonless night...

848
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:06,958
Spread your wings and
fly, my girl...

849
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:08,417
The rustling winds...

850
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:10,250
Dad, where is that book
on medicines?

851
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,833
Go from here now.

852
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:16,750
Spread your wings and
fly, my girl...

853
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:21,542
The rustling winds
awaits for you...

854
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,750
(doorbell rings)

855
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,958
-It's Abir. Wait, I'll go.
-Aunt, you sit. I'll check.

856
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:54,000
-Here, give this to aunt.
-Hmm...

857
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:07,208
How will you know
the cat touched the milk?

858
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,458
How?

859
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,500
By seeing its mustache.

860
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,458
You can see milk
on its mustache.

861
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,375
Who's the boy?

862
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,125
Which boy?

863
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,625
Really?

864
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,833
Your have started dressing up...

865
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:22,958
...polished your nails.

866
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,625
I can see the milk
on the cat's mustache.

867
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:27,000
-Nitu told me...
-I'll thrash you now.

868
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:31,083
When I tell you to dress up
you think I'm crazy...

869
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,750
...now you're
pushing it on Nitu...

870
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,958
Tell me truly
who's the boy?

871
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:37,750
-Abir...
-Hmm?

872
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,958
Very nice...

873
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,625
Everyone learns to crawl first...

874
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,500
...whereas you started running, huh?

875
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,750
Why are you saying like this?

876
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,917
Do you know...

877
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:52,667
...how many girls
are in love with him?

878
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:56,542
If all of them vote for Abir
he might become a minister.

879
00:55:57,042 --> 00:55:59,417
You're my everything, aunt.

880
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:00,875
Please show me a way out.

881
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,000
A way out...

882
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,208
I think there's a way out.

883
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:08,833
Basundhara said,
he doesn't want to marry.

884
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:12,292
But he never said
he doesn't want to fall in love.

885
00:56:12,917 --> 00:56:15,500
That can be your one way out.

886
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,958
Give it a try soon.

887
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,917
Can I do it?

888
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,125
I'll tell you a trick...

889
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:23,125
I don't know
which God is this...

890
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,292
Whatever...

891
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,208
God...whoever you are...

892
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,458
...I've come to you
for the first time.

893
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:31,208
Please forgive me...

894
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,958
I never asked
anything from you.

895
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,333
But today I will.

896
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,958
Give him all that he wants.

897
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,417
I don't want anything.

898
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,083
I'll only ask for one...

899
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:46,375
And after I make that wish
please make him mine forever.

900
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,375
What are you doing here?

901
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:55,375
Nobody comes here.

902
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,333
Umm...that's my question
to you too...

903
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,167
Why are you here
on your birthday?

904
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:06,208
My father used to bring me here
when I was a kid.

905
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,125
He used to worship.

906
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:10,875
And I used to observe him.

907
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:14,417
After that,
this place became special to me.

908
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,958
I thought...

909
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,583
...if there was
God anywhere...

910
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,708
...it'll be here.

911
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:23,250
So on every birthday
no matter where I am...

912
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,458
...I visit this place at least once.

913
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,333
Do you have an umbrella?

914
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,125
Umm..why?

915
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,792
Hurry up...let's go there...

916
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:41,208
Come...

917
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:01,083
Umm...I want to
tell you something.

918
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:04,375
See...

919
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,167
...the rain increased again.

920
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,875
Yeah...I mean...

921
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:08,875
...I mean...

922
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:10,792
...I was saying that...

923
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,167
It's easy to talk about love...

924
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,333
...but hard to retain.

925
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:18,958
One needs to be
mature enough for that.

926
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,250
And you're not
mature enough for that.

927
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,542
Your father is
a renowned doctor.

928
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,083
Everyone honors him...respects him.

929
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,583
First, you complete your studies.

930
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,083
Become a renowned doctor.

931
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,750
Make your father proud.

932
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:35,833
Don't waste your time
thinking about all this.

933
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:39,417
The soon you stop thinking about these
the better it would be.

934
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,833
Come, I'll drop you home.

935
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,958
No...

936
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:50,167
...I have a bike.

937
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:39,708
The day Abir told me
that I'm not mature enough...

938
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,042
...that I'm yet to
understand myself...

939
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,792
...I got really angry on him.

940
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,958
That day I decided...

941
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,958
...once I turn 18 years...

942
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,625
...once I become mature enough...

943
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,625
...that day I'll again tell him...

944
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:55,042
...all that I couldn't tell him today.

945
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,667
I'll tell him anyhow.

946
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,250
I was growing up.
Slowly...slowly...

947
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,875
I started batteling with myself.

948
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,500
I'll tell him
about my feelings one day.

949
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,000
I'll tell him...

950
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,792
What happened?

951
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,708
Let me just turn 18.
I'll tell him.

952
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:18,792
How dare he reject me?

953
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,250
But my medical entrance
was knocking on the door.

954
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,833
And another battle began.

955
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:26,083
Exam means battle.

956
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:28,542
And battle means exam.

957
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:32,542
And to conquer this battle
you've to mug up formulas.

958
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,708
It'll be like this...you idiot!

959
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:40,875
Just like A, B, C
mug up these formulas too.

960
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:42,083
What happened?

961
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:44,125
Security!

962
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,875
Take her out...right now!

963
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,958
So, as I was saying
you must mug up the formulas...

964
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:57,875
What's going on here?

965
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,708
Oh, I see..come here..come.

966
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:01,583
Get lost, you moron!

967
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:06,250
Leave me, I'll go home.
Leave me, please.

968
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:12,083
After these painful 6 months...

969
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,250
...I gave my medical entrance.

970
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:16,750
Relaxed, sound sleep
was like a bliss then.

971
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,708
It made me feel like
I'm in heaven.

972
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,833
The results came out
after one month.

973
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:27,417
And I got
in medical college too.

974
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:31,375
I began my new life
in Calcutta Medical college.

975
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,792
By then, I've crossed 18 years.

976
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,000
My life started to change.

977
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,583
The around me started to change.

978
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:42,333
The only thing that didn't change
was my old wish.

979
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:43,958
Abir...

980
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:46,958
I had to leave
for Kolkata for 5 years.

981
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,250
But before leaving
I wanted to meet Abir once.

982
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,417
Hey, how are you?

983
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:05,250
Ms. Little doctor, huh?

984
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,542
How did you know, aunty?

985
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,500
Your dear aunt told me.

986
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,958
You're Doctor Nanda's daughter
going to study medical science.

987
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,750
Yes...I'll leave tomorrow.

988
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:19,000
-Oh...
-Umm...

989
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:21,208
Where is Abir?

990
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,500
He's never home.

991
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,458
Everyone looks for him.

992
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,917
He has taken
responsibility of all.

993
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:31,750
Some days back...

994
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:35,000
...a very good marriage proposal
came for him.

995
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:38,542
I told him so many times
to get married.

996
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:41,250
I can't run this family forever.

997
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:46,000
He said he'll only marry the girl
who'll look after me as her own mother.

998
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,958
Not as mother-in-law.

999
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,792
Or else, he won't marry at all.

1000
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:51,542
But I've made it
very clear this time.

1001
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,458
If he doesn't marry this year...

1002
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:56,792
...I'll go to Varanasi.

1003
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:57,917
Only then he'll understand.

1004
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,458
Don't know why
but I felt like crying that day.

1005
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:05,833
I thought before
I leave for 5 long years...

1006
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,458
...I'll at least meet him once.

1007
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,083
Maybe he doesn't love me
but he could've met me once.

1008
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,667
That was the first time
I felt like crying for Abir.

1009
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:19,333
As if, there was nothing left
for me in this world.

1010
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,583
I learned to cook for him.
I grew up for him.

1011
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:26,667
But it all felt like
a waste of time.

1012
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:52,833
I told father
to sell my dearest bike.

1013
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:57,958
I decided to end all the old chapters
and begin a new one.

1014
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:05,750
My dear aunt gifted me this
before I set off to Kolkata.

1015
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:46,833
Four years passed by...

1016
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:50,000
Now I'm interning
as a house surgeon in college.

1017
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:53,042
In easy terms a junior doctor
or a half doctor.

1018
01:05:53,292 --> 01:05:57,208
So, after one year
I'll be a full-time doctor.

1019
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:59,958
My parents come
to visit me sometimes.

1020
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,542
I didn't go back
to Krishnanagar.

1021
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,958
I remain busy in my work.

1022
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:05,792
What is the point
of going back, anyway?

1023
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,292
Nitu stays with me now.

1024
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,208
But she's studying MBA.

1025
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:14,208
I have made new friends.
Among them, Maria stays with me.

1026
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,875
Applying cream, huh?
Want to be an actress or what?

1027
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,625
This is not any normal cream.

1028
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,250
This is AcneStar.

1029
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,667
Acne specialist.

1030
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:37,042
You should try it too.

1031
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:52,792
During these years not only me
but many other things changed too.

1032
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:55,625
The entire West Bengal
started to change.

1033
01:06:55,625 --> 01:07:00,417
The government, the chief minister,
the social media all changed.

1034
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:04,208
I looked for Abir
many times on Facebook.

1035
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,667
But I couldn't find him.

1036
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:08,875
Then poeple started bothering me
so much on facebook...

1037
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,083
...that I deleted the account.

1038
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:13,875
Life is not like before.

1039
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,125
It's a bit boring now.

1040
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:18,000
Getting up at 9a.m.
for the first class...

1041
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,750
...makes me feel so dizzy
and I could hear nothing.

1042
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:40,500
Now we'll discuss this each and individual
causes of cardiac arrest.

1043
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:48,625
First I thought
sir was giving us a demo.

1044
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,583
But it wasn't the case.

1045
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,958
It appeared to be
a practical class.

1046
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,792
Sir passed away in
a real heart attack.

1047
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,875
But we were more happy than sad.

1048
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Because we all got a day-off.

1049
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:04,292
Our boredom went away
with sir's death.

1050
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:07,708
All of us got back our interest
in attending class.

1051
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,417
For one person.

1052
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:13,625
Our new professor
Dr. Akash Basu.

1053
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,292
ALL: Good morning, sir...

1054
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:26,875
Dr. Akash Basu
was really young.

1055
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,500
Maybe that's why
he could understand his students.

1056
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,500
He used to teach
with a lot of fun.

1057
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,000
Not a single girl
skipped his class...

1058
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,333
...just to see him once.

1059
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,167
So...

1060
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:42,083
Before I move on to the details
if you have any quarries...

1061
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,042
...feel free to ask.

1062
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,750
-Sir?
-Hmm...yes?

1063
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,417
Umm...are you married?

1064
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,625
Anymore doubts?

1065
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,667
Two weeks later,
I had my viva exams.

1066
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,292
Take one...

1067
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,208
Alright.

1068
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:04,875
What is it?

1069
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,333
Bone marrow aspiration needle...

1070
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,500
Thank you, sir...

1071
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,292
Take one...

1072
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,250
No, sir...it's okay.
I don't want one.

1073
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,333
Come on...take one.

1074
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:30,500
Or else,
how will I take the viva?

1075
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,125
Actually, I meant the tools...

1076
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,042
Umm...I'm sorry.
I didn't get it at the first place.

1077
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:57,125
After that,
everything started to change.

1078
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:37,250
What's going on?

1079
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:40,833
You couldn't tell your crush
about your feelings earlier...

1080
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:43,958
Here someone has
given his heart to you...

1081
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,833
...and you're not getting that?

1082
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,333
-What are you saying?
-She's right.

1083
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:51,750
Everyone in class
is talking about this.

1084
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,708
-Dr. Akash likes you a lot.
-Shut up!

1085
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,000
We're just like good friends.

1086
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,625
Do you know
what friendship means?

1087
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,458
Only a good friend
can be a good lover.

1088
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:02,500
I don't understand...

1089
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,000
What is there to understand?

1090
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:07,333
If I was at your place...

1091
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:09,208
...I would've said yes long back.

1092
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,917
Still you'll think about Abir?

1093
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:22,000
I must say,
I've never seen a lovestory like this.

1094
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,625
A girl went to a boy...

1095
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,458
...and that boy rejected her
saying she's not mature enough!

1096
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:30,208
You two have started
a life together by now.

1097
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:33,167
Maybe Abir already
has a son by now.

1098
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,708
-Huh?
-Come.

1099
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,000
No, I was thinking that...

1100
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,958
Let it be...

1101
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,333
You always wanted a daughter.

1102
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,625
Let's go.

1103
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,083
Abir!

1104
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:09,750
Where is Abir?

1105
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,208
In my dreams...

1106
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,958
...with full family.

1107
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,583
Damn it!

1108
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:16,542
What the hell!

1109
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:22,833
That dream made me think
in a different way.

1110
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:24,667
The next day was Diwali.

1111
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,083
I walking through the corridor
of my college.

1112
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,667
And Akash was coming
from the opposite side.

1113
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,083
He was coming towards me.

1114
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:33,833
I knew he'll propose to me today.

1115
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,083
I had no other way
after having that dream.

1116
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:40,958
Maybe Abir is
a married man by now.

1117
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:44,000
Then what is the point
of spoiling my life...

1118
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,458
...thinking about him...

1119
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,958
I decided to be strong.

1120
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:50,500
And I walked towards Akash.

1121
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:33,375
-You? Here?
-I'm a medical student here.

1122
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,083
Right now, I'm interning.

1123
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:35,833
And you?

1124
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:38,042
I came to meet Dr. Burman.

1125
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,750
I'm a bit late.
I'll be back in sometime.

1126
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,583
Hmm...his chamber is that way.

1127
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:44,750
Thank you...

1128
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:53,333
He's known to you?

1129
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:55,750
Very well-known...

1130
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,333
Akash, I have something
to tell you.

1131
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:04,042
-Then where is the problem?
-But he doesn't like me.

1132
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:07,167
Did he tell you that?

1133
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:08,667
No, he didn't.

1134
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:11,000
But when I went to tell him
about my feelings...

1135
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,208
...he said that I'm not mature enough
to understand love.

1136
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:17,875
It was long time ago.

1137
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:21,083
And you've grown up also.

1138
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,583
You can tell him now.
Go, tell him.

1139
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:26,208
-That won't be of any help.
-Why?

1140
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:29,917
He already got ditched
in love once.

1141
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,458
And I think...

1142
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:34,500
...he still couldn't
forget his old love.

1143
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:35,792
Hmm...

1144
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,083
Lost love.

1145
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,333
A love that got lost...

1146
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:44,458
Have you ever smoked weed?

1147
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,167
-Weed?
-Hmm...

1148
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:48,042
-Umm...no.
-Neither have I.

1149
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:52,167
There are two ways
to understand lost love.

1150
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,417
First stage...

1151
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:55,667
...when you smoke weed
for the first time...

1152
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,500
...you'll be scared.
You'll feel unusual.

1153
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,750
But still...

1154
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,000
...you won't be
able to leave it.

1155
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,750
Just like love...

1156
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,458
You won't be
able to forget it.

1157
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,583
Now the second stage...

1158
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:12,708
...is like a landlord.

1159
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:15,833
...who keeps an eye on his tenants
till the month end.

1160
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:18,333
Why are you
so tensed about life?

1161
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,042
Say whatever
you want to say.

1162
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:25,000
Don't be scared
thinking about the results.

1163
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,625
Look, life is big.

1164
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,417
Things never end so easily.

1165
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:33,208
So, go...

1166
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,125
...go.

1167
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:40,250
That day Akash
made my life a lot easier.

1168
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,875
I didn't see Abir after that...

1169
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:44,125
...but I understood
what friendship is.

1170
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,208
New patients got admitted
to the hospital.

1171
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,917
And I kept making new friends.

1172
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:49,750
Coming...

1173
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,833
Just like this person
of bed no. 21.

1174
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,083
Come, come...

1175
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,042
Do you know
what your actual problem is?

1176
01:15:57,042 --> 01:15:58,333
Again what problem?

1177
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,875
-In your eyes...
-Hmm...

1178
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:03,208
Reading in low lights have completely
ruined your eyesight.

1179
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,042
What do you read
all the time?

1180
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,542
If I don't read it how will I understand
which book should I publish?

1181
01:16:10,542 --> 01:16:12,000
Are you a publisher?

1182
01:16:12,042 --> 01:16:14,833
Yeah people call me that.

1183
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,042
Wow!

1184
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,125
That means you've to
read many books.

1185
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,917
Yes, many kinds of book.

1186
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,167
So what I suggest is that...

1187
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,833
...do one thing.
Write a book.

1188
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,625
'Easy home remedies
to cure health problems'...

1189
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,792
I'll publish.
It'll be beneficial.

1190
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,458
I'll never write
all these gibberish.

1191
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,958
If people start curing
diseases at home...

1192
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:39,083
...then why the hell
did I become a doctor?

1193
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:39,458
Hmm?

1194
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,500
I got released today
Mr. Publisher.

1195
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:46,417
Good news Dulal.
All the best.

1196
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:48,208
I'm going home
with my daughter.

1197
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,625
-Oh, okay...
-Get well soon.

1198
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:52,417
-Yes.
-I'll see you again.

1199
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:53,750
-Goodbye...
-Goodbye.

1200
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,208
Take care of your father.

1201
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:56,750
Goodbye, madam.

1202
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,917
Take care of your health.

1203
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:00,375
We'll leave now.

1204
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:01,458
-Come..
-Yes, let's go.

1205
01:17:05,083 --> 01:17:08,625
Do you know
why Dulal went with her daughter?

1206
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:09,583
Why?

1207
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,417
Because his two sons
are very busy.

1208
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:15,667
They don't have time
for their father.

1209
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:20,458
I don't know why people
go crazy about sons.

1210
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:22,167
I feel like...

1211
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:23,917
...a daughter is
way better.

1212
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,833
At least they don't claim themselves
too busy like boys.

1213
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:32,875
So do you have
a daughter or a son?

1214
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:37,250
None of the both.

1215
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,458
What do you mean?

1216
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,917
It means...

1217
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:43,917
...I didn't marry.

1218
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,667
I started liking Snehashis.

1219
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,500
He failed to retain
his love of life.

1220
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:52,292
And I couldn't reach
my love of life.

1221
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:57,458
Maybe that's why
we built a special friendship.

1222
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,417
Take good care of yourself.

1223
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:25,667
Do have your medicines on time.

1224
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:28,583
And if you ever feel lonely...

1225
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,917
...don't forget to call me.

1226
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:30,750
Okay?

1227
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:35,917
I knew this hospital
provides good treatment...

1228
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:40,958
...but I didn't know
one can get good friends here too.

1229
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:42,167
Goodbye then...

1230
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:45,500
I was such busy with my friend
from bed no. 22...

1231
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,292
...that I didn't notice bed no. 32.

1232
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:51,250
But one day I did notice.

1233
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,833
I'll surely tell you
if I need anything else.

1234
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:55,500
Okay, okay...bye.

1235
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:08,833
Aunty, you here?

1236
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:10,708
Mother is suffering
from jaundice.

1237
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,000
I admitted her in
Dr. Burman's reference.

1238
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:20,750
Oh my God!

1239
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,083
Your bilirubin count is 10.

1240
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:23,625
Wow!

1241
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,417
Little doctor, you here?

1242
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,875
Little doctor is
all grown up now.

1243
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,625
But you don't worry at all.

1244
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,708
From today,
I'll take complete care of you.

1245
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,250
I'll treat you with special care.

1246
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:37,500
Madam?

1247
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:40,000
Patient no. 205 is really ill.

1248
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,333
-Wait...
-Okay.

1249
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:42,792
Aunty, I'm leaving now.

1250
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,333
Okay...

1251
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,667
Being honest...

1252
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:52,792
...I was sad seeing aunt
in this condition.

1253
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,250
...but I was happy too.

1254
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:59,625
At least I'll get to see Abir
for some days now.

1255
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,125
Please move...excuse me!

1256
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:30,750
Do eat properly...

1257
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:40,542
Move...excuse me...

1258
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:43,333
Take rest,
I'm coming in a minute.

1259
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,458
Excuse me, please...

1260
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:00,667
Thank you...thank you...

1261
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:09,250
You're perfectly well now.

1262
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:11,542
We'll release you in 2-3 days.

1263
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:16,500
Whatever you did for me
I'll remember till my last day of life.

1264
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:23,875
So, doctor
when are you getting married?

1265
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:30,333
These things are easy to talk about
but hard to retain.

1266
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,750
I've just started
studying medical.

1267
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,625
First, I want to
make my father proud.

1268
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:40,417
Marriage, love these are
waste of time.

1269
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:42,167
Isn't it?

1270
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:44,250
By the way...

1271
01:21:44,292 --> 01:21:46,542
...I've written all the medicines
in prescription.

1272
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:49,250
-You'll continue them.
-Okay.

1273
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,583
Mother...

1274
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:02,125
Hey, how come you here?

1275
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,500
Who informed you?

1276
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,458
No one informed.

1277
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,708
I came on my own.

1278
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:08,458
I've joined here
as a guest lecturer in a college.

1279
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:09,833
But that's long time now.

1280
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,833
But your son didn't care
to inform me about all these.

1281
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,333
Not fair, Abir.

1282
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:35,375
Anyways, how are you now?

1283
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,333
She said, I'm fine now.

1284
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:39,042
And these are the medicines.

1285
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,083
Okay, that's great.
Very good.

1286
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,375
That's why I tell you
to eat from time to time.

1287
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,583
I heard you're going to be
discharged soon.

1288
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:46,667
-Yes...
-Hmm...

1289
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,250
I'll come to take you home.
It's a deal.

1290
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,458
-Okay?
-Yes...yes...

1291
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:51,583
And I'm going to have
a talk with you Abir, come.

1292
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,292
-Come on...come...
-Go...

1293
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,625
Come with me...

1294
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:00,917
Hey,

1295
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,625
are you leaving?

1296
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:04,875
Yes, I've to take
a round of the hospital.

1297
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:07,000
-See you...
-Okay...

1298
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,750
It was obvious though.

1299
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,583
Who waits for five years?

1300
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,292
He got a new opportunity,
so he took it.

1301
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:34,625
What do you mean
by opportunity?

1302
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,208
Am I an opportunity?

1303
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,583
That he'll grab another
if one is missed...

1304
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:40,583
Why are you getting angry?

1305
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,167
I know Sriparna well.

1306
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:43,917
She was my sister's classmate.

1307
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:45,625
Now she's a teacher.

1308
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:46,458
Teacher, my foot!

1309
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,792
And you know...

1310
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,417
-Let's sit here...
-Yes...sure...

1311
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:56,250
They had to come here, huh?

1312
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:02,250
Hope it didn't hurt!

1313
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,417
Wow...

1314
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:05,750
...they look so good together.

1315
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,083
Not at all...

1316
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:09,250
Not only
she has a tilted nose...

1317
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,667
...but also awry eyes.

1318
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,167
And look at him...

1319
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,125
...he kept his shirt's
button open.

1320
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,958
She has no shame.

1321
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:19,125
Damn it!

1322
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,167
You want this, right?

1323
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,750
Take it and eat it.

1324
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:22,708
Oh, God!

1325
01:24:23,417 --> 01:24:24,875
Why are you talking like this?

1326
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:26,208
What harm has he done?

1327
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,042
So strange of you!

1328
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,958
How will I make them understand...

1329
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,542
...why am I getting angry.

1330
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,125
I was witnessing Abir
with someone else.

1331
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:39,083
And my heart was
breaking into pieces.

1332
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:49,083
-Madam...
-Hmm?

1333
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,167
The pain was in this hand.

1334
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,625
What have you done!

1335
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:59,417
Whenever I saw them together...

1336
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,708
...I felt like
instead of living this life...

1337
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:04,958
...killing that girl and
going to jail would've been better.

1338
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,625
But then I realised
it was not possible.

1339
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:12,500
So I decided to go home
for a change of mood.

1340
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,958
Oh, God! She's here too.

1341
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:49,333
Dr. Nandini, right?

1342
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,500
Do you recognise me?

1343
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,083
I am Sri...Sriparna.

1344
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:56,500
We met at the
hospital that day.

1345
01:25:58,083 --> 01:25:59,292
I've heard a lot about you...

1346
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:00,958
-...from Abir's mother.
-Tea, madam?

1347
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:03,625
Want some tea?

1348
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,542
Going home, huh?

1349
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:09,917
Yes.

1350
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:12,250
It's my exam break so...

1351
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,083
Nice...

1352
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,458
I'm also going home.

1353
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:15,792
Actually, my husband is
returning home...

1354
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:16,833
...after two months so...

1355
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,250
...I'm very excited.

1356
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,125
Two months...you mean...

1357
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:24,000
-Abir is your...
-Yes...

1358
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,125
...it's Abir...

1359
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:26,375
...who did this all.

1360
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,625
Abir made me and Indra
marry each other.

1361
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,250
He always quarrels with me.

1362
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,792
He quarrels more than girls.

1363
01:26:34,125 --> 01:26:36,875
But Abir is always there
to solve our fights.

1364
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,458
Abir didn't even tell us that
aunty was in the hospital.

1365
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:41,250
He's a very reserved boy.

1366
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:43,333
So I had to call my aunt
and got to know from her.

1367
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:48,000
Why are you laughing?

1368
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,583
Umm...sorry, sorry.
It's something else.

1369
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,333
Want some tea?
What about biscuits?

1370
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,250
"What goes comes around...

1371
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,125
...what is the news that came?

1372
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:03,667
...I heard the king
asked for a girl...

1373
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:04,917
...who is that girl?"

1374
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:06,042
Hey!

1375
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:08,458
Why are you uttering rhymes?

1376
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:12,667
I read in a book once...

1377
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:15,958
...uttering rhymes refreshes our mind.

1378
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,167
I know that.

1379
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:20,417
Refreshing mind is not the
only concern, you know...

1380
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:22,625
Whatever...

1381
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:25,042
How come you're
so changed, my dear?

1382
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:28,167
Every girl changes
when they grow up.

1383
01:27:28,167 --> 01:27:29,375
Yes...

1384
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,083
...even their titles
change too.

1385
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:33,417
For that you have to
get married.

1386
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,958
So, what type of a boy...

1387
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,958
...would you prefer
for marriage?

1388
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,250
For marriage ,

1389
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:48,625
I can supply you all the types of boys
available in this world.

1390
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,083
A groom.

1391
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,208
Tarak, you're here...

1392
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:53,958
You know, my lottery business
didn't work well.

1393
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:55,458
So I came up
with a new business.

1394
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:56,250
Matrimony...

1395
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:59,958
...so I'll be providing grooms and brides
according to preferences.

1396
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:02,458
You'll be my first customer.

1397
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:03,458
What a joy!

1398
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:04,708
Anyways, without
much waste of time...

1399
01:28:04,708 --> 01:28:06,542
...tell me about
your preferences.

1400
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:07,000
I want to know.

1401
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,333
-Here you go...
-Hmm?

1402
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,000
Whose marriage are you
talking about, Tarak?

1403
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,250
Our girl?

1404
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:14,375
None will come to
see her for marriage.

1405
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,458
She'll be going to
see boys for marriage.

1406
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,542
Remember, my words...

1407
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:17,042
What is your name?

1408
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:19,250
Abir Bandopadhyay...

1409
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,375
What?

1410
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,542
Abir Bandopadhyay...

1411
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:23,542
Hmm...

1412
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:28,292
Did you make the tea
or your mother?

1413
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:30,167
No, no...I made it myself.

1414
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,542
How far have you studied?

1415
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,125
M.A in Bengali...

1416
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:35,917
Wow! He talks like
a cuckoo bird.

1417
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,708
Hey...be louder!
Come on...

1418
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:42,417
-M.A in Bengali...
-Hey...

1419
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:46,750
What about
your cooking skills?

1420
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,458
Well...cooking...

1421
01:29:56,667 --> 01:30:00,042
Hey...what's wrong
with our daughter?

1422
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,375
Listen...

1423
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:11,208
Jiban's son is now an engineer.

1424
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,917
He's a good lad.
You know him.

1425
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:15,500
-Tarak said as a groom...
-Dad,

1426
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:17,583
I don't want to marry now.

1427
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,333
What do you mean?

1428
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:25,292
I have a tough exam upcoming.

1429
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:26,667
I have to meet a target.

1430
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:30,083
So, if I think about
marriage and all I'll fail.

1431
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,375
Listen...

1432
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,083
...I was also a medical student.

1433
01:30:33,167 --> 01:30:34,833
I have also given exams.

1434
01:30:35,042 --> 01:30:38,208
So don't lecture me
on studies.

1435
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,917
The syllabus has changed.

1436
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:43,667
So, following the old one
will get me nowhere.

1437
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:45,958
The syllabus has changed?

1438
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,750
But it was not
on the newspaper.

1439
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:53,625
Do have these medicines
before your meals.

1440
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,583
When do you have lunch?

1441
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:57,417
3-3:30p.m, like always...

1442
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,208
-Eat within 12 p.m.
-What?

1443
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:01,167
Don't be indisciplined.

1444
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:02,750
You're getting old...

1445
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,500
Stop being a child now!

1446
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,958
Find a life partner.

1447
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,875
You have to get married...

1448
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:13,792
...after all you're a girl.

1449
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,333
Oh, really?

1450
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:19,042
You've grown so much.

1451
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:24,125
I can't see you like this anymore.

1452
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:28,250
Let me talk to
Basundhara once...

1453
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:30,917
Aunt...time will talk.

1454
01:31:31,375 --> 01:31:34,500
Maybe on his behalf
or on mine.

1455
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,625
Raja, you here?

1456
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:49,750
Leave all that.
Give me the candle.

1457
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:57,958
Actually, I didn't...

1458
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,417
...run away.

1459
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:04,542
None of my business
worked well last four years.

1460
01:32:04,542 --> 01:32:07,000
So, I came back with
a new plan.

1461
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,292
Listen...Nandini...

1462
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:22,250
Now tell me...

1463
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,208
...say it fast.

1464
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:28,042
-Not interested in your foolish ideas.
-No, not foolish...

1465
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,583
Once you listen
you'll understand it's a brilliant idea.

1466
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:34,000
See, I've decided to
organise a game show.

1467
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:35,375
-Mr. Krishnanagar...
-What?

1468
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:35,958
Yes...

1469
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:39,667
Like those beauty pageant shows...

1470
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:43,792
I'll find out the
handsome guys in Krishnanagar.

1471
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,875
-You?
-No...no...

1472
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:48,333
Not exactly me.
I'll be the organiser only.

1473
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:50,083
I've had a talk
with the sponsers.

1474
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:51,125
Anjali jwellers,

1475
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:52,583
a very big company...
I've talked to them.

1476
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:55,167
-I've talked with them.
-What do I have to do now?

1477
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:57,625
I'm not going to participate
in your show.

1478
01:32:57,625 --> 01:32:58,583
No, no...why would you...

1479
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:00,417
You'll tell Abir
to participate instead.

1480
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:01,458
What?

1481
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,583
-Abir?
-Umm...yes...

1482
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:08,167
I know...you two are
good friends now.

1483
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:13,875
Abir has gym, right?
I mean something like that.

1484
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:17,125
He has many boys there.

1485
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:22,917
So, talk to him and
help me out in this matter.

1486
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,292
You're my sister.
Please, please...

1487
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,750
Hey, Nandini...

1488
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,083
Nandini...

1489
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,583
Nandini...please...please!

1490
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:33,875
I can't do all these.

1491
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:34,917
He's your friend.
You tell him.

1492
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:36,417
He won't listen to me.

1493
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:39,375
Listen, please...for the last time.

1494
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:41,333
Please...

1495
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:42,875
Please...

1496
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:47,542
Okay, let's see what I can do.

1497
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:49,125
I'll thrash you, now.

1498
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:49,750
Why?

1499
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,875
Why would I help
a fraud like you?

1500
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,792
Maybe he's a fraud...

1501
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,250
...but I'm not.

1502
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:01,125
Let me see...

1503
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:13,458
Will he do it alone?
Go help him...

1504
01:34:20,542 --> 01:34:21,292
Heavy, huh?

1505
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,083
Hey, you do it.

1506
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:31,417
I was just wearing
the shades.

1507
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:35,458
Will you give me a second?

1508
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,250
I'll sent my boys
only because you said.

1509
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:45,583
But you'll have to do
something as well.

1510
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,917
Umm...sure.
Tell me...

1511
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,167
Our club is organizing
a mass marriage...

1512
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,792
...and free health check-up.

1513
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:53,208
You're a doctor.

1514
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:54,708
Can you come once?

1515
01:34:55,292 --> 01:34:57,333
Why not?
Surely, I'll be there.

1516
01:34:57,333 --> 01:35:00,083
I'll meet you tomorrow
at your club.

1517
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:15,708
-Where are you going now?
-I've some work,dad.

1518
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:17,917
Your results are
about to come out, right?

1519
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:18,875
Any news on that?

1520
01:35:18,875 --> 01:35:21,833
-I'm going for the exam.
-What? Exam?

1521
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:24,417
Every new work in life
is like an exam.

1522
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:25,708
How many exams
will you give?

1523
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:29,375
All are questions come up
when I go to a work.

1524
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:33,625
Fine you've interrupted me
so you'll give me compensation.

1525
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:36,083
-Compensation?
-Sign this?

1526
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:39,208
Hurry up!

1527
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:43,458
God knows,
what exam is this.

1528
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:45,125
Anyways,
secure good result.

1529
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:43,875
I was happy to have him for so long
because of this work.

1530
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:49,083
I wanted to secure the best result
in this exam called life.

1531
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:52,167
I was trying to know
his likes and dislikes.

1532
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:54,417
He even told me everything.

1533
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:57,542
I got a lead from his words.

1534
01:36:57,542 --> 01:37:01,292
He even agreed to
accompany me to a place.

1535
01:37:09,917 --> 01:37:11,250
Come on...

1536
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:18,708
Welcome! Welcome!

1537
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:19,917
Come in...

1538
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,167
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1539
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:25,042
It's been a long journey, right?

1540
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:29,542
So...you're Abir Bandopadhyay?

1541
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:32,750
-Hello!
-From Krishnanagar, huh?

1542
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:37,208
You don't know me
but I know you very well.

1543
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:39,792
You must be surprised...right?

1544
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:44,458
I've heard so much about you that
I recognised you easily.

1545
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:48,917
Leave the small talks for later.
We've an important work now.

1546
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:49,667
Come in...

1547
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:53,500
So, Abir...

1548
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:01,417
Open and see it...

1549
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,000
This is...for you.

1550
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,458
My mother's poetry...

1551
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:44,125
It's surprising, isn't it?

1552
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,917
Don't be so surprised.

1553
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:52,542
Once Nandini gave me some
handwritten papers.

1554
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,083
Told me to read them.

1555
01:38:54,375 --> 01:38:56,125
I was shocked
after reading them.

1556
01:38:56,167 --> 01:38:59,083
So nicely written...
I asked, who wrote them.

1557
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:00,833
I asked, what this person do.

1558
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:03,167
Nandini told me
about your mother then.

1559
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:05,000
Actually...

1560
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,708
your mother's talent and
Nandini's request...

1561
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:10,583
...made me to publish this book.

1562
01:39:12,792 --> 01:39:14,083
And young man...

1563
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:19,125
...tell your mother to write more
without doing anything else.

1564
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:21,625
She's a great writer.
She should write more.

1565
01:39:27,667 --> 01:39:30,542
-It's an emergency call.
-Yes, please...

1566
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,042
Hello...

1567
01:39:32,167 --> 01:39:34,375
How is uncle Suren now?

1568
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:36,167
You've arranged the blood, right?

1569
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:37,500
Hello...

1570
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:39,042
Hello...

1571
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,083
...have you arranged the blood?

1572
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:43,750
There's a network problem here.

1573
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,667
You can talk outside.
You'll get network there.

1574
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:47,417
Yeah...hello?

1575
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,708
Can you hear me?

1576
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:51,375
Hello?

1577
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:52,792
Yes...I can hear now.

1578
01:39:55,542 --> 01:39:57,333
Can I see the book?

1579
01:39:58,292 --> 01:39:59,167
Hmm...

1580
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:01,500
It's yours...

1581
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:06,833
'Putul Publishers'...

1582
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,875
The name is very sweet.

1583
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:12,667
I told you about my lover
whom I couldn't marry.

1584
01:40:13,042 --> 01:40:16,375
I hope she's even more sweet
than this book now.

1585
01:40:16,667 --> 01:40:19,375
She also stays in Krishnanagar.

1586
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:23,167
I'll arrange the money.
Don't you worry.

1587
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:27,875
Maybe she has
a family of her own now.

1588
01:40:27,917 --> 01:40:30,417
No, she doesn't.

1589
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:32,417
What do you mean?

1590
01:40:32,542 --> 01:40:33,375
I mean...

1591
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:37,833
When a person loves someone so much
how can she move on like that?

1592
01:40:38,875 --> 01:40:41,042
Life is way different.

1593
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:42,917
What can I say...

1594
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:45,292
...they can't even do
a single work without me.

1595
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,250
Anyways, how far is your work?

1596
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,833
These are matter of hospitals...

1597
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:52,375
...I've to go.

1598
01:40:52,792 --> 01:40:56,958
No point of wasting time then.
you should go now.

1599
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,667
-Goodbye...
-Let it be.

1600
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:07,750
I don't deserve this respect, Abir.

1601
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:11,125
It's all because of Nandini.

1602
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:14,958
It's hard to find
people like her these days.

1603
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:18,125
The one who fulfills
other's dreams unconditionally.

1604
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:21,792
Don't ever loose
a friend like her.

1605
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:24,417
Happy, Nandini?

1606
01:41:24,417 --> 01:41:25,625
Yes?

1607
01:41:25,917 --> 01:41:27,500
You're happy, right?

1608
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:29,125
Yes...take this.

1609
01:41:30,208 --> 01:41:31,833
We'll leave then?

1610
01:41:32,292 --> 01:41:35,333
Never say goodbye, my dear.

1611
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,667
Have a safe journey.

1612
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:38,875
Go now.

1613
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:41,333
-Do come again.
-Sure.

1614
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:42,875
Come on...

1615
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:05,042
I hear and keep hearing...

1616
01:42:05,042 --> 01:42:11,083
...I count and
keep counting the days.

1617
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:16,417
I sow words
and keep sowing them...

1618
01:42:16,417 --> 01:42:22,417
I keep thinking
when will you know them...

1619
01:42:22,417 --> 01:42:25,333
Sometimes we're far away...

1620
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:28,125
Sometimes we're close enough...

1621
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:33,500
I just want to tell
I love you...

1622
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,625
Oh, heart
you're cunning enough...

1623
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:39,500
Oh, heart
you're so stubborn...

1624
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:45,000
Oh, heart
say it today, say it now...

1625
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,833
Oh, heart
you're so playful...

1626
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:50,750
Oh, heart
you're so fitful...

1627
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:57,750
Oh, heart
express the love you have.

1628
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:13,583
In this deceitful world
you're my only truth...

1629
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:19,208
It's also true that
I'm living for you...

1630
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:24,875
In this deceitful world
you're my only truth...

1631
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:30,958
It's also true that
I'm living for you...

1632
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:33,875
Sometimes we're far away...

1633
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,667
Sometimes we're close enough...

1634
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:42,042
I just want to tell
I love you...

1635
01:43:42,042 --> 01:43:45,167
Oh, heart
you're cunning enough...

1636
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:48,042
Oh, heart
you're so stubborn...

1637
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:53,542
Oh, heart
say it today, say it now...

1638
01:43:53,542 --> 01:43:56,375
Oh, heart
you're so playful...

1639
01:43:56,375 --> 01:43:59,292
Oh, heart
you're so fitful...

1640
01:43:59,292 --> 01:44:06,292
Oh, heart
express the love you have.

1641
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:14,292
Poeple do things for others
out of kindness.

1642
01:44:14,667 --> 01:44:17,125
But what you did today...

1643
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:20,958
...Abir couldn't do it
for his mother.

1644
01:44:21,583 --> 01:44:25,458
My dear, you're so
younger than me...

1645
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:28,125
...still you're so
great than me.

1646
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:31,958
But you know aunt
without someone...

1647
01:44:31,958 --> 01:44:34,583
...this wouldn't have been possible.

1648
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:37,375
Really? Who is that other person?

1649
01:44:37,792 --> 01:44:41,167
He's also a close one.

1650
01:44:41,417 --> 01:44:45,500
After listenning about
Abir and his mother...

1651
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,208
...he printed hundred copies.

1652
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:50,042
He didn't take a single penny.

1653
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:51,250
Oh, really?

1654
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:54,958
People like this still exist?

1655
01:44:54,958 --> 01:44:57,792
Introduce me with him.
I'll pay my regards.

1656
01:44:57,792 --> 01:45:01,000
Umm...okay,
I'll give you three names...

1657
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:02,958
The one you'll like
will become his name.

1658
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:05,333
How can one person
have three names?

1659
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:07,375
Listen to me...

1660
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,333
...one is Subhashis...

1661
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:12,333
...then Debashis...

1662
01:45:12,917 --> 01:45:15,042
-And Snehashis...
-Snehashis...

1663
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:19,750
Hmm...Snehashis Sarkar.

1664
01:45:21,292 --> 01:45:24,833
He was a good person, you know.

1665
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:27,958
He had a sweet lovestory.

1666
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:30,958
But after people got to
know about it...

1667
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:34,333
...the girl's family
sent her far away.

1668
01:45:34,792 --> 01:45:38,000
And he shifted to Kolkata.

1669
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,708
There he opened
his publishing house.

1670
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:47,333
He named his company
after his lady love.

1671
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:51,125
'Putul Publishers'...

1672
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:57,792
After that...

1673
01:45:58,417 --> 01:46:00,792
...I met him.

1674
01:46:00,792 --> 01:46:03,125
-How's he now?
-Good.

1675
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:07,333
Is he...married?

1676
01:46:07,583 --> 01:46:10,167
Umm...no...

1677
01:46:15,625 --> 01:46:17,583
How does he look now?

1678
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:19,833
-Want to see him?
-Yes.

1679
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:24,208
I've a photo of him.
I'll bring it from home.

1680
01:46:36,292 --> 01:46:38,750
Putul...

1681
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
This time situations
are much better.

1682
01:48:05,167 --> 01:48:08,500
Last time there was 12 couples,
this time it's thirty.

1683
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:19,208
Madam, have you
updated this list?

1684
01:48:19,417 --> 01:48:21,667
Umm...yes...

1685
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:23,792
Listen...

1686
01:48:23,917 --> 01:48:25,708
Why is a name missing here?

1687
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:27,125
Didn't anyone entry it?

1688
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:28,917
Sorry...I didn't write it
purposefully.

1689
01:48:28,917 --> 01:48:32,958
I have decided to
marry off Abir with Shatabdi.

1690
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,292
Wow! That's a good news.

1691
01:48:40,292 --> 01:48:42,750
Why didn't you tell us
about Abir's marriage?

1692
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:50,208
You go now...I'll come later.

1693
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:51,208
Okay...

1694
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:09,542
Oh, my broken heart...

1695
01:49:09,542 --> 01:49:14,875
...how many more times
will you break?

1696
01:49:14,875 --> 01:49:20,292
Oh, my broken heart...

1697
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:25,417
...how many more times
will you break?

1698
01:49:25,417 --> 01:49:30,833
I can't stay away from you,
I can't live without you...

1699
01:49:30,833 --> 01:49:35,125
My heart is
empty without you...

1700
01:49:35,125 --> 01:49:41,125
You drowned me,
and I'm lost now...

1701
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:45,792
I can't find my way
to the shore now.

1702
01:49:45,792 --> 01:49:51,792
You drowned me,
and I'm lost now...

1703
01:49:51,792 --> 01:49:56,833
I can't find my way
to the shore now.

1704
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:17,917
In my deep, long sleep
I wish for you to come back to me...

1705
01:50:17,917 --> 01:50:28,542
In my deep, long sleep
I wish for you to come back to me...

1706
01:50:28,542 --> 01:50:34,792
I can't stay away from you,
I can't live without you...

1707
01:50:34,792 --> 01:50:39,417
My heart is
empty without you...

1708
01:50:39,417 --> 01:50:45,167
You drowned me,
and I'm lost now...

1709
01:50:45,167 --> 01:50:49,792
I can't find my way
to the shore now.

1710
01:50:49,792 --> 01:50:55,833
You drowned me,
and I'm lost now...

1711
01:50:55,833 --> 01:51:00,875
I can't find my way
to the shore now.

1712
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:11,750
My broken heart,
Oh, my broken heart...

1713
01:51:21,917 --> 01:51:22,792
What's wrong?

1714
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:26,333
What happened, dear?

1715
01:51:28,417 --> 01:51:30,875
I have lost, aunt.

1716
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:33,208
I lost.

1717
01:51:33,833 --> 01:51:36,500
Let me talk to,
Basundhara once.

1718
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:39,208
-Don't stop me now.
-No, aunt.

1719
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:42,458
Please don't tell them anything.

1720
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:45,000
She is right.

1721
01:51:45,083 --> 01:51:48,542
Abir always wanted to
help everyone.

1722
01:51:49,333 --> 01:51:51,125
But look how strange it is...

1723
01:51:51,208 --> 01:51:53,958
...my nature of helping people...

1724
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:56,208
...took me close to Abir.

1725
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:57,542
And today...

1726
01:51:57,542 --> 01:52:01,583
...because of this nature
Abir went away from me.

1727
01:52:02,625 --> 01:52:03,625
Aunt...

1728
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,792
...I gave the exam
attentively.

1729
01:52:07,667 --> 01:52:09,250
But I failed.

1730
01:52:11,292 --> 01:52:12,667
Can I say something?

1731
01:52:13,333 --> 01:52:15,792
-Will you listen to me?
-No, aunt...

1732
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:18,250
I have thought a lot.

1733
01:52:19,167 --> 01:52:21,917
Nothing would have
ever happened between us.

1734
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:23,750
If it has to happen...

1735
01:52:23,875 --> 01:52:27,542
...then Abir would've made it
happen on his own.

1736
01:52:28,375 --> 01:52:29,875
Tell me, aunt...

1737
01:52:29,917 --> 01:52:32,250
...I was a simple girl.

1738
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:35,292
I used to play cricket,
taunt people...

1739
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:38,375
...I didn't even know
how to dress up.

1740
01:52:38,917 --> 01:52:41,625
Why did you all tell me dress up?

1741
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:43,625
Why did you
change my thinking?

1742
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:46,417
You didn't tell me once...

1743
01:52:46,417 --> 01:52:50,167
...that girl has to
bear pain forever.

1744
01:52:50,292 --> 01:52:52,083
Why didn't you tell me?

1745
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:55,583
-Why didn't you? Why?
-Calm down...

1746
01:52:56,042 --> 01:52:58,792
Enough now...

1747
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:04,542
I was sure...

1748
01:53:04,542 --> 01:53:07,000
...that Abir was
not coming back to me.

1749
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:13,083
I was preparing myself
to go away from Abir...

1750
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:14,375
...to forget him.

1751
01:53:14,375 --> 01:53:15,958
Nandini...

1752
01:53:28,667 --> 01:53:31,125
Come here.
I need to talk.

1753
01:53:45,292 --> 01:53:47,167
Okay, give me a minute.

1754
01:53:53,958 --> 01:53:56,208
Yes, Nandini...tell me...

1755
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:09,292
Nandini...

1756
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:12,500
Listen to me carefully...

1757
01:54:13,042 --> 01:54:15,542
Whatever I have
told you so far...

1758
01:54:15,792 --> 01:54:18,667
...taught you so far,
forget them all.

1759
01:54:18,792 --> 01:54:20,042
And remember...

1760
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:23,292
...everything is fair
in love and war.

1761
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:25,750
No other theory, okay?

1762
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:27,500
And trust me, I know...

1763
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:30,083
...you'll overcome
all the hurdles.

1764
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,750
Best of luck.

1765
01:54:34,792 --> 01:54:35,875
Take one...

1766
01:54:38,333 --> 01:54:39,125
Wait...

1767
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:43,292
Now, take one.

1768
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:53,875
-What is it? Tell me...
-Sit down...

1769
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,250
We'll ask Abir to help.

1770
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,250
Umm..Abir?

1771
01:54:57,333 --> 01:54:58,667
Have you gone crazy?

1772
01:54:58,667 --> 01:55:00,167
Trust me,
nothing will happen.

1773
01:55:00,167 --> 01:55:02,292
This is the only way.

1774
01:55:02,833 --> 01:55:03,708
And listen...

1775
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:07,417
...you'll do exactly
what I'll tell you to.

1776
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:08,667
Okay?

1777
01:55:09,167 --> 01:55:10,375
Rahim uncle's daughter?

1778
01:55:10,417 --> 01:55:11,708
Couldn't you find anyone else?

1779
01:55:12,542 --> 01:55:14,625
You know
he is respected by all.

1780
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:16,417
If he gets to know
about his daughter's escape...

1781
01:55:16,417 --> 01:55:17,417
...his life will be ruined.

1782
01:55:17,417 --> 01:55:19,958
Look, we didn't think much
when we fell in love.

1783
01:55:20,417 --> 01:55:24,750
If you think we've made a mistake
then it's a mistake to love someone.

1784
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:27,667
And we both
can't live without each other.

1785
01:55:27,792 --> 01:55:28,583
That's it.

1786
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:30,083
-She can't live without you?
-No.

1787
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:32,042
Will you help us or not?

1788
01:55:32,042 --> 01:55:33,542
Do whatever you want to.

1789
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:36,083
-Don't expect my help.
-Abir...

1790
01:55:36,458 --> 01:55:39,667
I never helped anyone to escape
and I never will.

1791
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:43,167
Say something...

1792
01:55:43,333 --> 01:55:44,875
He's leaving...

1793
01:55:45,292 --> 01:55:48,417
Then why did you marry off
Sriparna and Indra?

1794
01:55:49,542 --> 01:55:52,292
That's beacuse,
I knew them from a long time.

1795
01:55:52,292 --> 01:55:53,125
Oh!

1796
01:55:53,125 --> 01:55:56,333
And you met Nasima
today only, right?

1797
01:55:57,625 --> 01:56:01,125
I thought only my brother
was a shifty person.

1798
01:56:01,375 --> 01:56:04,292
But what about your promises?

1799
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:07,458
Two people loved each other.

1800
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,083
They didn't commit any crime.

1801
01:56:09,125 --> 01:56:10,667
Then why won't you help them?

1802
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:14,042
When one loves someone...

1803
01:56:14,042 --> 01:56:15,458
...and fails to get love in return...

1804
01:56:15,542 --> 01:56:18,833
...do you know
how much it hurts?

1805
01:56:19,417 --> 01:56:22,292
The pain starts heaping up.

1806
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:26,917
No matter how much one tries
those pain can't be erased.

1807
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:31,792
Anyways...

1808
01:56:31,792 --> 01:56:32,708
I am sorry.

1809
01:56:32,708 --> 01:56:34,833
I didn't mean to bother you
by saying all this.

1810
01:56:34,833 --> 01:56:36,042
Nandini...

1811
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:38,833
...let's go.

1812
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:41,208
Nasima was Nandini's classmate.

1813
01:56:41,708 --> 01:56:45,042
So she's going to help her
escape at night.

1814
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:48,750
All you have to do is
drop us at the main highway.

1815
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:51,250
I have already arranged a car there.

1816
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:54,042
Please brother...don't say no now.

1817
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:06,667
First time,
I'm doing something with honesty.

1818
01:57:09,917 --> 01:57:11,333
Wow!

1819
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:13,792
(starts singing)

1820
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:18,667
What a feeling!

1821
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:31,250
Why are they taking so long?

1822
01:57:31,292 --> 01:57:32,708
I hope I don't get in any trouble.

1823
01:57:44,042 --> 01:57:45,458
They're here...

1824
01:57:47,667 --> 01:57:49,875
Come on.
Let's go now.

1825
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:56,125
Get inside, come on.

1826
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:57,708
Let me keep this.

1827
01:57:58,083 --> 01:57:59,875
Let's go. Hurry up...

1828
01:58:01,333 --> 01:58:02,750
Move...move...

1829
01:58:03,875 --> 01:58:05,167
Let's go.

1830
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:11,333
That car...right there...

1831
01:58:12,292 --> 01:58:13,167
That's it.

1832
01:58:14,708 --> 01:58:15,833
Hurry up...

1833
01:58:19,625 --> 01:58:20,250
Watch out...

1834
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,917
You go, sit inside.

1835
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:24,125
Brother...

1836
01:58:24,792 --> 01:58:26,250
Thank you so much.

1837
01:58:26,583 --> 01:58:30,042
I'll be forever debt to you.
If you weren't here our marriage...

1838
01:58:32,042 --> 01:58:35,292
Yeah I have so much to tell you.

1839
01:58:37,333 --> 01:58:40,875
So I wrote this letter for you.

1840
01:58:44,625 --> 01:58:46,958
Don't...open it now...

1841
01:58:46,958 --> 01:58:48,375
Open it after I leave.

1842
01:58:48,542 --> 01:58:50,042
I feel ashamed.

1843
01:58:56,375 --> 01:58:57,542
See you then.

1844
01:59:00,917 --> 01:59:02,792
Wait for a minute.

1845
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:05,917
You fool...

1846
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,542
...you think
you're a hero, right?

1847
01:59:07,542 --> 01:59:08,958
I tried my luck
over many things...

1848
01:59:08,958 --> 01:59:11,000
...I failed
but I never gave up.

1849
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:12,708
So that one day
I can defeat you.

1850
01:59:12,708 --> 01:59:16,167
I even had a loss of
2 Lacs in my last venture.

1851
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:18,333
That's why I went underground
to public harassment.

1852
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:24,625
After returning I heard
Shatabdi's tipsy father...

1853
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:26,750
...put her name
in mass marriage.

1854
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:28,333
And the groom was you.

1855
01:59:28,333 --> 01:59:30,458
You thought
you'll win this time too?

1856
01:59:30,625 --> 01:59:33,417
So, I planned to defeat you
by your own hands.

1857
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:36,167
Raja might be a fraud
when it comes to money...

1858
01:59:36,167 --> 01:59:38,667
...but in case of love...never.

1859
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:48,333
Shatabdi!

1860
01:59:49,583 --> 01:59:50,750
Get lost!

1861
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,708
You sw**e...

1862
01:59:51,833 --> 01:59:53,250
Let's go now.
Get lost...

1863
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:56,500
Hey...start the car...

1864
01:59:56,667 --> 01:59:57,833
Run the car!

1865
01:59:58,042 --> 01:59:59,667
Come on, hurry up...

1866
02:00:00,042 --> 02:00:01,417
Goodbye...

1867
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:13,542
Fakir Lalon said-
'When will the lovers unite?'

1868
02:00:13,667 --> 02:00:16,958
But that day I witnessed
one getting knocked out.

1869
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:21,333
First time in life
Raja became a hero for me.

1870
02:00:26,583 --> 02:00:27,958
Now I was sure...

1871
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,792
...Abir will only be mine.

1872
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,333
He will only look at me...

1873
02:00:31,375 --> 02:00:32,458
...and say...

1874
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,125
...I love you Nandini.

1875
02:00:35,167 --> 02:00:36,583
I hate you Nandini.

1876
02:00:53,542 --> 02:00:57,583
One has no problem
to marry a helpless girl...

1877
02:00:57,583 --> 02:01:01,167
...but one can't give lift to a helpless girl
in the middle of the night.

1878
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:02,625
Such a great character!

1879
02:01:09,042 --> 02:01:10,208
Get in...

1880
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:12,292
Get in now...

1881
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:25,167
Hey...

1882
02:01:25,167 --> 02:01:27,125
You went to know
the results long back...

1883
02:01:27,125 --> 02:01:28,750
...why are you so late then?

1884
02:01:29,167 --> 02:01:30,958
You passed the exams, right?

1885
02:01:32,417 --> 02:01:34,375
The results are not out yet.

1886
02:01:37,458 --> 02:01:39,333
What kind of a exam is this?

1887
02:01:45,208 --> 02:01:47,000
-Did you notice?
-Huh?

1888
02:01:47,208 --> 02:01:49,875
Our daughter
is changing again.

1889
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:55,125
Tell Taru, to find
a nice boy for her marriage.

1890
02:02:01,292 --> 02:02:04,292
That night
I thought only one thing.

1891
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:08,542
I am a girl.
So now like my sister June...

1892
02:02:08,542 --> 02:02:12,833
...I'll have to spend my life
with a dumb husband.

1893
02:02:15,667 --> 02:02:18,000
The next day
was Abir's birthday.

1894
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,042
I knew where can he be now.

1895
02:02:21,208 --> 02:02:23,583
But I didn't go to meet him.

1896
02:02:23,583 --> 02:02:26,750
So I paid my homage
to the Gods in this temple.

1897
02:02:50,917 --> 02:02:52,750
Today is 27th of May.

1898
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:55,792
It's Abir's birthday Nandini

1899
02:02:55,875 --> 02:02:59,542
Aunt, I don't want to hear
anything about Abir.

1900
02:02:59,958 --> 02:03:02,250
If there's anything else tell me.

1901
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:04,500
I'll only say this...

1902
02:03:05,208 --> 02:03:07,917
5 years passed away Nandini.

1903
02:03:08,792 --> 02:03:12,333
Still you can't tell Abir
about your feelings?

1904
02:03:13,625 --> 02:03:16,833
You didn't let me
talk to his mother also.

1905
02:03:17,458 --> 02:03:20,458
I can't see this
gloomy face of yours.

1906
02:03:21,042 --> 02:03:23,750
-I have to go home.
-No.

1907
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:27,292
Abir went to that temple.

1908
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:30,833
You'll go there.
That's all.

1909
02:03:53,458 --> 02:03:54,875
You know Nandini...

1910
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,875
...I'm a very simple boy.

1911
02:03:58,625 --> 02:04:00,750
After my father's death...

1912
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,417
...I achieved success
after many difficulties.

1913
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:06,292
Same words all over again.

1914
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:09,125
The next line will be
'Your father is a renowned doctor'.

1915
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:11,000
Everyone respects him.

1916
02:04:11,375 --> 02:04:13,458
Your father is
a renowned doctor.

1917
02:04:13,458 --> 02:04:14,875
Everyone respects him a lot.

1918
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,250
'You'll be more successful
than your father'...

1919
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:21,167
You'll be more successful
than your father.

1920
02:04:21,333 --> 02:04:24,458
'Our worlds are way different'...

1921
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:28,458
Our worlds are totally different.

1922
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,208
But these things
don't bother me anymore.

1923
02:04:35,208 --> 02:04:36,625
Hmm...

1924
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:44,000
I know you've always loved me.

1925
02:04:44,542 --> 02:04:48,333
You've taken a lot of pain
to make me yours.

1926
02:04:49,083 --> 02:04:51,042
But have you
ever tried to know...

1927
02:04:51,042 --> 02:04:53,000
...what I want?

1928
02:04:53,208 --> 02:04:55,292
Whom I like?

1929
02:04:56,125 --> 02:04:57,875
You never thought that.

1930
02:04:58,083 --> 02:04:59,500
Instead...

1931
02:04:59,542 --> 02:05:03,375
...you insulted me
along with Raja.

1932
02:05:04,542 --> 02:05:06,792
I'm warning you
for the last time.

1933
02:05:07,708 --> 02:05:09,958
Don't ever come
in front of me like this.

1934
02:05:11,375 --> 02:05:13,875
I want to see you
at my house...

1935
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:16,208
...as my beloved wife...

1936
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:20,125
...dressed in the proper attire.

1937
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:21,917
-Understood?
-What do you mean?

1938
02:05:22,125 --> 02:05:23,542
Shut up...

1939
02:05:56,292 --> 02:06:02,375
Love is God, love is ruin.
The world stoops down to love...

1940
02:06:02,375 --> 02:06:08,167
Love is God, love is ruin.
Everyone loses before love...

1941
02:06:08,167 --> 02:06:14,167
Love is God, love is ruin.
The world stoops down to love...

1942
02:06:14,167 --> 02:06:19,958
Love is God, love is ruin.
Everyone loses before love...

1943
02:06:20,375 --> 02:06:26,458
I know he kept his love hidden...

1944
02:06:26,458 --> 02:06:32,458
I know he secretly wants me...

1945
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:42,875
Still he thinks
why keep it a secret?

1946
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:49,417
Tell me, tell me all
can't bear this lonelyness anymore...

1947
02:06:49,417 --> 02:06:55,667
Let the moon sleep in peace...

1948
02:06:55,667 --> 02:07:01,542
Go and flow like the
cold breeze...

1949
02:07:01,542 --> 02:07:09,750
I wish to swim in your
ocean of love...

1950
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:16,458
When the heart finally
belongs to someone...

1951
02:07:16,458 --> 02:07:21,250
My heart is yours forever...

1952
02:07:22,333 --> 02:07:28,292
Wherever the heart goes...

1953
02:07:28,292 --> 02:07:34,167
My heart is yours forever...

1954
02:07:34,167 --> 02:07:40,250
Love is God, love is ruin.
The world stoops down to love...

1955
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:46,042
Love is God, love is ruin.
Everyone loses before love...

1956
02:07:46,042 --> 02:07:52,125
Love is God, love is ruin.
The world stoops down to love...

1957
02:07:52,125 --> 02:07:57,917
Love is God, love is ruin.
Everyone loses before love...

1958
02:08:09,292 --> 02:08:21,083
My days and nights long for you...

1959
02:08:21,083 --> 02:08:33,500
The moment I wake up in the morning
my eyes look for you...

1960
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:39,167
Tell me, tell me all
can't bear this lonelyness anymore...

1961
02:08:39,167 --> 02:08:45,417
Let the moon sleep in peace...

1962
02:08:45,417 --> 02:08:51,292
Go and flow like the
cold breeze...

1963
02:08:51,292 --> 02:09:00,125
I wish to swim in your
ocean of love...

1964
02:09:00,125 --> 02:09:06,083
When the heart finally
belongs to someone...

1965
02:09:06,083 --> 02:09:10,875
My heart is yours forever...

1966
02:09:11,958 --> 02:09:17,917
Wherever the heart goes...

1967
02:09:17,917 --> 02:09:23,792
My heart is yours forever...

1968
02:09:23,792 --> 02:09:29,875
Love is God, love is ruin.
The world stoops down to love...

1969
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:35,667
Love is God, love is ruin.
Everyone loses before love...

1970
02:09:35,667 --> 02:09:41,750
Love is God, love is ruin.
The world stoops down to love...

1971
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:47,542
Love is God, love is ruin.
Everyone loses before love...

1972
02:09:49,208 --> 02:09:53,000
Here you two are planning
your daughter's marriage...

1973
02:09:53,375 --> 02:09:57,667
...and there she is roaming around
on someone's bike.

1974
02:09:57,667 --> 02:09:58,375
What?

1975
02:09:58,375 --> 02:10:00,625
Roaming on someone's bike?
Impossible.

1976
02:10:00,625 --> 02:10:03,292
-On whose bike?
-Abir's bike...

1977
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:05,083
What is he saying?

1978
02:10:05,083 --> 02:10:07,917
It's time for celebration!

1979
02:10:11,542 --> 02:10:12,625
Oh, God!

1980
02:10:12,792 --> 02:10:14,125
Look, they're here.

1981
02:10:14,125 --> 02:10:15,833
-Let's go.
-Yes...yes...

1982
02:10:16,917 --> 02:10:18,792
Oh, no! Uncle listen to me.

1983
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:30,750
I needed to talk...to you...

1984
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:32,833
-Yes...yes...tell me fast.
-Yes...

1985
02:10:33,292 --> 02:10:37,708
No...I mean...I and Nandini...we...

1986
02:10:37,708 --> 02:10:40,375
-Go on...
-Tell us...

1987
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,708
Give me your hand.

1988
02:10:44,417 --> 02:10:46,708
Your heartbeats and
blood pressure both are rising.

1989
02:10:46,708 --> 02:10:48,917
Hurry up or
you'll collapse.

1990
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:50,833
Yes...I mean...

1991
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,708
-If I and Nandini...
-You mean getting married?

1992
02:10:54,708 --> 02:10:58,042
Yeah right you are.

1993
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:06,458
What a joy sister.
My hard work paid off.

1994
02:11:07,542 --> 02:11:09,208
It's okay son.

1995
02:11:09,417 --> 02:11:10,875
It's okay my dears.

1996
02:11:15,833 --> 02:11:17,708
Take him inside. Come.

1997
02:11:17,917 --> 02:11:19,333
You come also.

1998
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:25,208
On a sunday like this...

1999
02:11:25,208 --> 02:11:28,208
...at his birthday
Abir rejected me.

2000
02:11:28,792 --> 02:11:31,333
But after 5 years
on another sunday...

2001
02:11:31,333 --> 02:11:33,000
...again at his birthday...

2002
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,917
...he proposed to me.

2003
02:11:35,292 --> 02:11:36,958
This is my story.

2004
02:11:36,958 --> 02:11:41,917
And this is that road
where I found my soulmate.

2005
02:11:41,917 --> 02:11:45,917
Today we're going
to the house of my special friend.

2006
02:11:45,917 --> 02:11:49,125
Who told Abir
about my feelings.

2007
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:53,333
Who gave me the idea of
printing my mother-in-law's poems.

2008
02:11:53,333 --> 02:11:58,375
Even he gave the idea of
Raja's elopement with Shatabdi.

2009
02:12:02,167 --> 02:12:05,792
My best friend Dr. Akash.

2010
02:13:04,583 --> 02:13:07,583
I've understood
one thing from life.

2011
02:13:07,583 --> 02:13:09,333
Life is beautiful.

2012
02:13:09,333 --> 02:13:11,625
One just needs eyes
to see the beauty of it.

2013
02:13:11,625 --> 02:13:15,250
Only then sorrows
don't take place in your heart.

2014
02:13:15,250 --> 02:13:18,458
But I've discovered
one habit of men.

2015
02:13:18,458 --> 02:13:22,583
That they can't forget
their first love.

2016
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,125
-What did you name your daughter?
-June.

2017
02:13:26,792 --> 02:13:28,208
Nandini named her.
