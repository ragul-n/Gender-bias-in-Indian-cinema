1
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,931
THE BLACK HEN

2
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,169
<i>Dear villagers!</i>

3
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,763
<i>His majesty the king</i>

4
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,486
<i>will be visiting our village.</i>

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,401
<i>/-\ big feast will be organised.</i>

6
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,803
<i>Bring your chickens
to the village Headman's house,</i>

7
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,611
<i>he will pay you a reasonable price.</i>

8
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,567
First time meeting the king?

9
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,488
His Majesty the King, yes.

10
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,365
But I've met 3 generations
of Royal family.

11
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,490
You're old as all that?

12
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,044
I think Maoists
are just using the cease-fire

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,607
to strengthen their Militias.

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,048
Thank you.

15
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,042
Wait! Wait!

16
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,480
Give that to me.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,411
Hey come here!

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,841
Special tea.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,322
Father!

20
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,604
Why sell the hens?

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,966
Keep quiet!

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,321
Good morning Miss!

23
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,328
Morning, Suresh.

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,249
1 rooster and 3 hens.

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,771
- Namaste! Headman.
- Namaste!

26
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,360
I have brought all my chickens.

27
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,010
When will I be paid?

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,601
Day after tomorrow.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,442
Aren't you happy
we buy all your chickens?

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,448
Bring that big rooster up here.

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,962
I heard your boss has a cold.

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,006
Tell him to make hot rooster soup.

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,891
How much do I owe you'?

34
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,326
P183500.

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,608
- Hey Uzhyale!
- Yes grandpa.

36
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,326
Pay him right now.

37
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,690
I can bring the money over
to your shop today.

38
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,968
Tomorrow is fine with me, Miss.

39
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,044
Hey Suresh! Come here.

40
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,205
You fool! Playing with guns? Let's go.

41
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,043
Hey Kiran!

42
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,962
Slowly... Slowly...

43
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,291
Hey! Have some bread.

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,569
I v\/ill hold the hen.

45
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,490
Don't worry. She's safe with me.

46
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,964
It's the last hen our mother raised.

47
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,367
We should hide her from everybody.

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,046
Hey Prakash! Come on, let's play.

49
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,601
Prakash!

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,681
Come here.

51
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,965
What happens if father finds out about it?

52
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,450
I'll tell him that I bought the hen.
Let's hide her.

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,441
Where?

54
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,369
<i>Dear students!</i>

55
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,963
<i>You are not getting
a good education here!</i>

56
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,165
<i>It must be stopped.</i>

57
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,766
<i>We need a new educational system.</i>

58
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,610
<i>Dear students, parents and teachers!</i>

59
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,291
<i>We believe that
we all should collaborate</i>

60
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,369
for a successful revolution.

61
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,690
There's a huge gap
between the poor and the privileged.

62
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,923
We want to close this gap

63
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,326
and benefit the poor.

64
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,807
Many martyrs have shed blood.

65
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,843
Let it not be in vain.

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,002
The good days are not far.

67
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,286
Thank you so much!

68
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,609
Red Salute!

69
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,607
Thank you Commander!

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,844
I should get going.

71
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,610
Bijuli, are you coming?

72
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,409
<i>And you, brewer Kwan'?</i>

73
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,806
Let's go home.

74
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,890
I'll come later.

75
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,884
- Come soon.
- Okay.

76
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,044
Uzhyale, Miss!
Shall I walk you home?

77
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,164
Thank you Sir Chandra.
I'll walk by myself.

78
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,404
Sister Bijuli, let's go home.

79
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,688
No, it's interesting. Let's stay.

80
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,370
Let's leave now. I'm hungry.

81
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,362
Wait a moment.

82
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,561
<i>Dear village!</i>

83
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,170
<i>During the Dasha/n festival,</i>

84
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,881
<i>we are showing Rajesh Hamal and Karishma
Manandhafs new film Saathi.</i>

85
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,804
<i>The ticket is only Rs. 100.</i>

86
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,208
<i>Rise up from each village
Rise up from each settlement</i>

87
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,489
<i>So that we can change
The face of our country</i>

88
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,889
Kids, save your money for the film.

89
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,565
Come to the village soon
to fix a date for your wedding.

90
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,366
- Kiran!
- Yes.

91
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,721
Surbir wants to talk to his fiancÃ©e,
your sister Uzhyale.

92
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,807
Okay.

93
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,523
Where have you been all day?

94
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,529
Watching the Cultural program.

95
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,371
Does it do you any good?
Did they pay you?

96
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,602
Be careful of Maoists, servant.

97
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,683
They're a threat to children.

98
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,923
Don't let your daughter
attend such events!

99
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,330
<i>Salutations to the Profound Nepalese,
Powerful God of the land</i>

100
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,166
<i>May glory crown forever</i>

101
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,405
<i>His Majesty Government the King</i>

102
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,324
<i>May the almighty bless you</i>

103
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,287
<i>May the subjects increase</i>

104
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:44,046
<i>Let every Nepalese wish with joy</i>

105
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,206
You lost Kiran.
I knew you'd lose.

106
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,401
Come on Suresh.

107
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,042
Once a loser...

108
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,720
Suresh has won this film poster.

109
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,721
They cheated.
Next time, I'll v\/in.

110
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,884
I know you will, for sure.

111
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
Hello sister...

112
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,242
Why didn't I see you at school?

113
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,042
Come with me
I'll show you something special.

114
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,651
Please tell me, sister.

115
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,411
I have a surprise for you at home.
Let's go.

116
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,166
Sister!

117
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,643
Hovv should we name this hen?

118
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,411
It is yours. So you choose the name.

119
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,600
Hovv about "Karishma"? Like the actress.

120
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,291
That's a good name.

121
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,687
Karishma will lay eggs, hatch chicks,

122
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,127
we will sell them at the market

123
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,248
and use the money for school.

124
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,481
Good.

125
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,891
- Sister!
- Yes.

126
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,725
Will you take her
when you get married?

127
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,011
No, she's yours forever.

128
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,004
That's great!

129
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,203
See!

130
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,003
Where did you get this hen?

131
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,403
I bought it with my scholarship money.

132
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,928
That money isn't there to buy the hen.

133
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,168
Don't you need to study?

134
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,130
I wonder what's going on in your head.

135
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,288
You are not studying nowadays.

136
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,523
Your mind is elsewhere!

137
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,051
Serve the bread now.

138
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,567
What's wrong?

139
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,527
My dearest granddaughter is missing.
She hasn't come home.

140
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,450
I heard she was with Bijuli yesterday.

141
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,568
Don't worry!

142
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,366
I have already sent people
to inform the police.

143
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,321
I am sure our children
will be back in a few days.

144
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,841
Maoists have already taken 6
from Tuma village,

145
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,961
8 from Dhuma village and
5 from our village including Bijuli.

146
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,568
All together, 19 kids.

147
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,849
Don't worry!

148
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,402
They kicked me
because of my announcement.

149
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,606
Sons of donkeys!

150
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,491
They should be killed.

151
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,844
You idiot, don't disturb him.
He's studying.

152
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,170
Prakash, what's up?

153
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,530
Let's sell the egg and see the film.

154
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,642
Kiran, get your butt inside.

155
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,282
Ever seen an egg this big before?

156
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,442
Wow! Sure you want to sell it?

157
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,648
No, but maybe we'll buy film tickets.

158
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,204
<i>Prakash Nepali, you have a phone call.</i>

159
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,444
- What is it?
- I have a phone call. Can I leave?

160
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,365
Ok! Come right back.

161
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,567
Okay.

162
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,607
Prakash! Pick it up.

163
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,526
Hello! Sister Bijuli!

164
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,204
Where are you?

165
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,566
I'm fine! When will you come back?

166
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,526
During the Dashain festival?

167
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,366
Ok! You know, yesterday
Karishma laid an egg.

168
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,369
Father is angry but don't worry.

169
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,603
Hey son! Is that Bijuli?
Give me the phone!

170
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,409
Hovv could you leave
the house and your brother?

171
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,401
Hello! Hello...

172
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,410
What's wrong with the phone?
It's beeping.

173
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,688
Hello! Hello...

174
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,925
Hey! What are you doing?

175
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,364
Take that hen outside.
Don't make me slap you.

176
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,890
Bring me the plates.

177
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,001
Son, go to sleep after you eat.

178
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,368
Oh my God!
Look at your Karishma.

179
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,807
That's not mine.
Let's go check.

180
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,601
Father!

181
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,605
Where is my Karishma?

182
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,808
What Karishma?

183
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,369
My hen.

184
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,888
How would I knovW
You're the one who plays with it.

185
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,011
It must be somewhere around,
or someone has taken it.

186
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,363
Were you blind
when someone took the hen?

187
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,681
What are you saying?
Get out of here.

188
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,610
Disrespectful son!

189
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,965
Hey boys!
What are you doing?

190
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,404
Trying to rob me?

191
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,922
Hovv can you steal my hen?
You should be ashamed.

192
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,249
I bought it from your father

193
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,688
to feed my pregnant daughter.

194
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,320
I have paid R5600.

195
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,445
But grandpa!
This is Prakash's favourite hen.

196
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,329
Please! Give it back.

197
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,690
Your father sold it to me.

198
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,610
You don't know my father.

199
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,322
He sold this hen
because it clucks at night.

200
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,606
That's a bad omen.

201
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,644
Whatever! I'm not giving it back.

202
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,563
But I'll sell it to you,
because I like your honesty.

203
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,887
You have to pay me.

204
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,122
We don't have the money right now.

205
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,928
Then I won't give you the hen.

206
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,441
Keep this R350 for now.

207
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,610
The rest within 5 days.

208
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,850
No, not 5 days.

209
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,844
Bring it in 3 days

210
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,207
and I will give you back the hen.

211
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,641
- We promise.
- Ok. Ok.

212
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,801
My sister and I, we're raising this hen
to pay our studies.

213
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,843
Grandpa, Wait!

214
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,451
Why? Why wait?

215
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,926
What's your name?

216
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,571
Tenzing.

217
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,003
What's the name of your village?

218
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,326
Kimri.

219
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,204
Don't forget your promise.

220
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,530
Now, you'll need to do all the work
alone, without your daughter.

221
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,250
Hovv will you manage?

222
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,042
Your daughter has put you to shame.

223
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
What can I do?

224
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,566
Father!

225
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,809
Why did you sell my hen?

226
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,286
I'll tell Bijuli when she gets back.

227
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,044
Give me the money to get it back.

228
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,289
Get out of here,
before I break your legs.

229
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,325
Hey, get going,

230
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,881
both of you.

231
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,601
It'll be dark soon,

232
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,482
you haven't finished the job.

233
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,761
Father, please give me the money.

234
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,450
Why do you need that stupid hen
that clucks even at night?

235
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,171
<i>Dear Brothers and Sisters!</i>

236
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,722
<i>Only a few days remain
before the film screening.</i>

237
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,641
<i>Book your tickets now.</i>

238
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,407
<i>There are only a few seats left.</i>

239
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,929
<i>I repeat!</i>

240
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,929
<i>Only a few seats are left.</i>

241
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,962
Sir!

242
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,522
What?

243
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,489
I need to go home.

244
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,520
What's the problem?

245
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,801
Grandfather's ill.

246
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,604
Is Miss Uzhyale leaving?

247
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,326
- No just the two of us.
- Then leave.

248
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,962
- Hey!
- Yes sir.

249
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,571
Show me your class work.

250
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,767
And you?

251
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,640
Okay, you can go.

252
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,371
Ok everyone, continue your class work.

253
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,685
Uncle, wait.

254
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,011
Kids!

255
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,170
Sell all the film tickets?

256
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,046
Poor school children can't buy tickets.

257
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,488
I trusted you kids

258
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,887
but I was wrong.

259
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,766
Give me back the tickets.

260
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,649
We sold only one.

261
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,410
Give me money for one.

262
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,251
Just one!

263
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,724
Give me the money.

264
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,001
We don't have change.

265
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,124
I do. Give me the money.

266
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,682
Give us our commission.

267
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,401
Don't worry, you can see the film
for free instead.

268
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,723
But vve need the money
to get the hen back.

269
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,769
Knock it off

270
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,601
and be quiet

271
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,489
or I tell your grandfather.

272
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,451
My sister left this 200 under my pillow.

273
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,322
This, you stole
from your grandfather's prayer room.

274
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,728
It's not enough to get the hen.

275
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,530
What shall we do?

276
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,646
When is our deadline?

277
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,006
Day after next.

278
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,523
What are you thinking?

279
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,009
I'm thinking what to do
with this money. And you?

280
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,845
- Me?
- Yes.

281
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,161
You know.

282
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,402
You're not thinking anything.

283
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,727
I'm thinking hovv to steal more money
from grandfather.

284
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,450
What do you mean?

285
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,810
Don't be mad.
I won't do anything bad.

286
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,889
You'd rather be angry
at that jackass, Suresh.

287
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,125
True, but sometimes you hurt me.

288
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,123
I worry about things you say.

289
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,647
Don't worry, I am here for you.

290
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,731
Look, he's here.

291
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,371
Hey! Stop that playing.

292
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,646
Kiran!

293
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,890
Give this tika to the Untouchables
outside.

294
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,686
Kiran's father not coming?

295
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,289
No, stuck at the office.

296
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,407
Work for the government,
comply with their rules.

297
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,641
True!

298
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,487
He'll take you both to the city.

299
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,886
Oh yeah?

300
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,409
What would the village do without me?

301
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,207
What if your grandfather finds out?

302
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,250
I'll just tell him
I lost my geometry box.

303
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,006
Want to buy a geometry box?

304
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,282
- You?
- Yes. I want to buy it.

305
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,250
Do you have the money?

306
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,730
I'll get money at my uncle's house
during Dashain and pay you back.

307
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,121
This isn't Suresh's, no credit here.

308
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
It's from the Royal family.

309
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,122
Don't make fun of Suresh.
He's the only one who can afford it.

310
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,324
Why are you being a jerk?
Get lost.

311
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,687
Why hide beautiful chicks
in such a lousy basket?

312
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,569
Let them play outside.

313
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,288
Why be a smartass'?

314
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,009
It's none of your business.
Leave my chickens alone.

315
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,608
Can't keep your ovvn hen
and you want to lecture me?

316
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,410
Why get angry? Aren't vve friends?

317
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,609
We are friends.

318
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,967
Then hovv come you seem to forget it?

319
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,726
When they lay eggs,
I'll give you both one.

320
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,968
Give them eggs? You go inside.

321
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,202
Didn't you hear me?
Get inside.

322
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,124
What are you staring at?

323
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,369
We don't have the money.
So what's your plan?

324
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,522
We tried our best to get it.

325
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,281
The only way is to ask Tenzing
for more time.

326
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,921
No way, forget it,
I'm not giving my watch to Tenzing.

327
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,360
Where's the grandpa Tenzing?

328
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,410
He brought this hen
from Karkibada village.

329
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,965
We're asking about Tenzing.

330
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,130
Tenzing brought this hen.
Isn't she beautiful?

331
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,401
You mean Tenzing is inside?

332
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,686
Yes.

333
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,731
Grandpa! We could only collect R5300.

334
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,607
What?

335
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,681
I need more money than that,
300 won't do.

336
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,646
- Scram.
- Please grandpa!

337
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,401
I don't give a darn.

338
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,609
Please give us a few more days.
We'll find the rest.

339
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,802
Forget it. I said scram.

340
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
If he finds out, he'll skin us alive.

341
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,927
They're all at the monastery.

342
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,407
No, let's find another way.

343
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,689
Think about it, Prakash.
No one's around.

344
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,930
Now, nobody will knovvthis is Karishma.

345
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,044
See, hovv clever I am.

346
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,840
Here!

347
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,006
Hey Prakash!

348
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,130
Have you got the meal?

349
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,808
Yes! I made it earlier.

350
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,008
Ok, good.

351
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,560
Look at that!

352
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,644
Where did you get that hen?

353
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,005
- This hen?
- Yes.

354
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,371
I bought it for R5300.

355
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,490
Where did you get the money?

356
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,120
Bijuli left it under the pillow
when she left.

357
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,287
Then, you should have
given me that money.

358
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,320
I got this hen for a cheap price.

359
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,611
Isn't that good?

360
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,603
Yes. Seems like a good deal.

361
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,604
That's a good boy.

362
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,610
You did very well.

363
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,721
Look!

364
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,609
Clucking again!

365
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,730
Hovv come you and your sister
always find cluckers?

366
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,287
Can't you hear?

367
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,124
Throw it out!

368
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,129
Someone put my bag here...

369
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,361
Go to your row.
You don't sit here.

370
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,926
What's going on?

371
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,246
Come with me.

372
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,521
You too.

373
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,322
Why are you hiding?
Let's find Karishma.

374
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,124
This bush has big thorns.

375
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,204
Why should I do it alone?

376
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,690
Then let's go.
You always have to talk a lot.

377
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,369
Be careful, don't hurt Karishma.

378
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,523
She's here. I can hear her.

379
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,244
Prakash! Can you see her?

380
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,041
What are you asking me, you idiot!

381
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,528
Hey! Where are you? Hurry up.

382
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,571
Did you get her?

383
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,922
My clothes.

384
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,485
You look cool.

385
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,762
Don't joke. Hurry up!

386
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,410
- Harder!
- Harder!

387
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,289
Kiran, where are you going?

388
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,681
He's the one...

389
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,010
Where is his friend?

390
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,725
What's wrong?

391
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,209
Go inside.

392
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,969
Where is your stupid hen?

393
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,367
Where did you hide it?

394
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,047
Take us there.

395
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,128
Where is it?

396
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,481
I left her here,
Maybe somebody took her.

397
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,291
Look at this idiot.

398
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,363
We'll find her soon enough.

399
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,850
Whatever you do, do it fast.

400
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,843
Don't make more trouble.

401
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,411
Just give me my money back.

402
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,607
I promise father! I kept her here.

403
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,722
Maybe she flew away.

404
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,131
You are always lying. You told me
the hen was eaten by a jackal.

405
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,607
And in fact you hid it here!

406
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,245
I v\/ill break your legs!

407
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,441
One more glass, please!

408
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,331
You've already had three.
I won't give you more.

409
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,448
What? That's not fair.

410
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,401
I brought you a hen that lays eggs.

411
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,210
What about your other debt?

412
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,529
Please don't let me down.
Just one more glass.

413
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,762
No more for you,
you always make trouble.

414
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,604
Ok, this is the last one.

415
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,484
Where is the hen, Jit?

416
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,408
What hen?

417
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,249
- You have the hen.
- Which hen?

418
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,051
Durga and these kids
say you have carrying the hen.

419
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,004
I saw you carrying the hen.

420
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,889
Don't be smart. What did you see?

421
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,724
Look.

422
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,723
I found it.

423
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,282
- Here, take your hen!
- Why did you colour it black?

424
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,484
This idiot is to blame for everything.
Troublemaker!

425
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,849
I'll break your legs!

426
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,404
Go easy on him...

427
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,250
Don't hit him that hard.

428
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,331
Where are you going, huh?

429
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,650
No leaving without paying.

430
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,280
Just keep a tab.
I won't eat and run.

431
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,642
Your grandfather's going to pay?

432
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,167
- I'll pay you later.
- Nope!

433
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,648
Pay it or else
I'm keeping you here all day.

434
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,970
Look, the hen thief is here.

435
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,362
- Aunty!
- Yes.

436
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,289
Tie your chickens tightly.

437
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,282
Okay, <i>I</i> will.

438
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,841
There's a new thief in town.

439
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,610
Hovv dare you, untouchables,
taint my water!

440
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,644
Didn't you see he tainted my water?

441
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,801
Hey kid!

442
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,761
What's wrong?

443
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,490
Why are you crying?

444
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,641
Mother!

445
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,531
Give Prakash some food.

446
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,928
<i>The people have already arrived
from the city to show the film.</i>

447
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,160
<i>Come to the school tomorrow evening.</i>

448
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,163
<i>Don't miss your chance.</i>

449
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,446
Hey neighbour!

450
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,405
Please cover the slogan nicely.

451
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,561
Ok.

452
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,129
<i>Revolution! Rights of people to start
people war! Long live Maoist UCPi</i>

453
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,647
Hey! Take this.

454
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,407
Give him a proper education!

455
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,363
I'll make him a future hero.

456
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,687
Uncle! Take this,
grandfather sent it.

457
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,770
Prakash, try this one.

458
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,929
Long live the headman!

459
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,884
That's more like it.

460
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,690
Who says I can't be cool?

461
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,969
You need to study well.

462
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,605
Then you will be cool.

463
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,330
Ok, you both carry on.

464
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,726
Hello buddy!

465
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,169
Namaste, Headman.

466
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,611
Getting ready for the wedding?

467
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,530
I've got something for you.

468
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,610
I bring you nice fabric.

469
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,241
You know I always sell good quality.

470
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,886
Prakash!

471
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,730
Take the drums to your father
and decorate them.

472
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,447
Yes, go b0)'-

473
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,890
Stop that noise.

474
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,890
Be quiet.

475
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,524
Otherwise you won't understand
the story.

476
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,367
Caption's house is at the corner.

477
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,040
And the headman's house is down there.

478
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,288
Next to the peach tree?

479
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,851
Yes.

480
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,001
Let's make a move.

481
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,764
Prakash, the horse is thirsty,
take it to the water tap.

482
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,281
Ok.

483
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,245
Stop the drums.

484
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,841
Mr. Surbir, come.

485
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,286
What do you want?

486
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,488
We have a small matter with him.

487
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,002
Are you blind?

488
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,123
Headquarters' order.

489
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,970
But this is a wedding!

490
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,810
Shut up, come with us.

491
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,689
There's no time for this.

492
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,002
- Please!
- Take me instead.

493
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,923
We'll send him back in a few days,
it's just for official business.

494
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,201
Don't worry mother. I'll be back.

495
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,721
This is no time
to talk to your mother.

496
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,966
Long live Maoist CPN!

497
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,686
Hey sister!

498
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,606
Sister!

499
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,444
Why are you here?
Go home.

500
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,840
No, I won't.
Let's go together.

501
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,889
I'll be back, go home.

502
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:29,928
No way.

503
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,008
Why are they taking Surbir?

504
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,328
He'll be fine. Just go home.

505
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,046
You know sister, father sold Karishma.

506
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,328
And I can't buy her back.

507
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,886
Bijuli, you're here too?

508
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,241
Now I understand.

509
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,407
Comrade, vve must cross
before the government finds out.

510
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,368
When'll you be home?

511
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,370
Dashain.
Take this money for our Karishma.

512
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,566
Promise you won't tell father
or anyone else that we met.

513
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,801
I promise!

514
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,246
Comrade Jvvala!

515
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,643
Always keep it with you.

516
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:49,524
This place is no longer safe for us.

517
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,566
You'll have to go to the city.

518
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,240
Your sister Uzhyale and me,

519
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,762
we will join you in a few days.

520
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,490
I always told you never to be friends
with the Untouchables.

521
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,804
Now you see, your studies are ruined.

522
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,362
So go to the city
and get an education there. Okay?

523
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,881
Prakash!

524
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,530
Don't cry, sonny!

525
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,210
I wanted such a good future for Bijuli!

526
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,840
But she's dashed my hopes.

527
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,562
Now hovv will I show
my face in the village?

528
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,131
Don't cry, son.

529
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,123
Stop playing with Kiran.

530
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,604
The headman doesn't like it.

531
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,565
Focus on your studies.

532
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,242
You have to fulfil our dream
and become the school headmaster.

533
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,402
Now you are my only hope.

534
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,761
Iran into sis...

535
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,046
Hey boy!

536
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,766
Hey old man!

537
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,884
Give me those eggs.
We'll have them with v\/ine.

538
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,131
I had to go to another village
to get this little bottle.

539
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,927
Why'?

540
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,646
Don't you knovW

541
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,967
Know what?

542
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,290
The police shut our village shop down.

543
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,767
Really?

544
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,001
Yes.

545
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,928
They accused the owner
of selling goods to the Maoists.

546
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,686
Poor fellow.

547
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,729
So now I'm planning to buy it out.

548
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,644
The whole thing?

549
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,202
Of course, you expect me
to buy half a shop?

550
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,767
For real?

551
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,807
Yes.

552
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,601
Hey boy!

553
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,207
Make some snacks!

554
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,600
Let him be.

555
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,603
Why is he ignoring me?

556
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,886
I have some fried potatoes left.
I'll get them for you.

557
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,121
All right!

558
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,929
Your mother is dead.

559
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,725
You must wear these white clothes
for a year.

560
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,321
Mother!

561
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,564
- Namaste, Headman.
- Namaste.

562
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,920
Hovv are things?

563
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,886
Maoists broke the ceasefire
and ended the peace process.

564
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,930
We have already started
search operations.

565
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,848
Don't worry!

566
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,531
Hey, old man.
Where is your daughter?

567
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,450
I don't know sir...

568
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,011
<i>Nd, do you Know'?</i>

569
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,730
I don't.

570
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,451
You both go to the same school, right?

571
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,409
She's coming back for Dashain.

572
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,324
Hovv do you know that?

573
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,482
- She called me.
- Do you have her number?

574
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,567
Old man!

575
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,490
If you don't bring us Bijuli
during Dashain,

576
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,490
I'll throw you both in jail. Got it?

577
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,443
Hows your granddaughter sir?

578
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,125
She's better now.

579
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,851
Prakash, stop!

580
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,647
- You take care.
- Have a safe journey, Durga.

581
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,650
Suresh, let's go.

582
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,130
It's really sad
that the shop was closed.

583
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,289
Safe journey, my lovely...

584
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,920
Prakash, wait.

585
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,720
Wait for me.

586
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,686
Why? What for?

587
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,287
I have always supported you

588
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,802
and now you are avoiding me.

589
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,970
Is that what friendship means to you?

590
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,407
Come with me.

591
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,846
Grandpa! Give us back our hen.

592
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,728
You boys back here again?

593
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,405
You little punks!

594
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,722
When will you stop pestering me?

595
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,041
Get out of here!

596
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,691
Here, look! We have all the money.

597
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,888
I killed and ate your hen.

598
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,845
Forget about the hen.

599
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,607
- You want to wear this watch?
- No.

600
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:45,807
Take it. I'll buy a new one in the city.

601
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:52,281
Sister Bijuli won't come home
unless I get the hen back.

602
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,680
What shall we do?

603
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,890
Don't cry. I sent that hen
to my daughter's house.

604
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,167
Where's that?

605
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,204
In Serog. But that's too far to go.

606
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,048
Kiran, can I borrow your horse?

607
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,048
Tenzing just said it's too far.

608
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,163
Can you manage to go alone?

609
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,045
However far,
I have to bring the hen back.

610
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,489
Maybe they already ate the hen?

611
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,042
But we don't know that.
I have to find out myself.

612
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,007
Prakash, what am I supposed to do?

613
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,607
You just go back home.

614
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,322
Please, I want to join you.

615
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,449
Your grandpa will be angry.

616
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:39,367
This might be the last time
we will be together.

617
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,448
So please let's go together.

618
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,887
Want some?

619
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,965
Let me try it.

620
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,723
I told you not to inhale.

621
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,360
What if ghosts come out?

622
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,646
Ghosts?

623
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,525
I would take this stick

624
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,362
and whack the ghost like this
and kill it.

625
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,770
Don't be scared.

626
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,969
But what if a black bear shows up?

627
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,164
I'll stare the bear right in the eyes,

628
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,248
then slowly turn around,
and run away without showing fear.

629
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,769
You coward!

630
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,329
What if Maoists point a gun at you?

631
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,001
Don't talk about those creeps.

632
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:11,041
I feel so bad for my sister Uzhyale.

633
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,002
What if they don't let Surbir go?

634
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,361
Have some.

635
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,488
Hiccups. Your grandpa
must be thinking of you.

636
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,124
I'll go get some water.

637
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,286
"Wishing you a happy festival
of Dashain.

638
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,010
"Don't forget me.

639
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,646
"From Durga."

640
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:08,410
Can you teach me
to talk in English too...

641
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,761
What happened?

642
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,048
The black bear scratch your eye?

643
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,727
You idiot. What bear could ever kill me?

644
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,769
Bring me some healing herbs!

645
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,962
Ow! That hurts.

646
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,846
Don't die! I'd be lost without you!

647
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,566
Why are you still here? Go on!

648
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,361
Idiot, you want me to die here?

649
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,005
Where are you heading?

650
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,486
To Serog, sir.

651
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,804
Why are you going to Serog?

652
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,762
To fetch a hen.

653
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,167
- What do you have with you?
- Nothing, sir.

654
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,281
What's that?

655
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,446
Cigarettes, sir.

656
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,687
Sir!

657
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,251
Give them back.

658
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,605
Why do you go to Serog?

659
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,371
A Shaman said
to get my sick grandpa a hen.

660
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,330
Do you realise hovv dangerous it is?

661
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,969
Get their names. They can go.

662
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,406
What is your name?

663
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,284
My name is Suresh Khatri.

664
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,641
Address?

665
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,849
Karkibada VDC, Ward No.1.

666
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,240
And yours?

667
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,004
Birey Nepali, sir.

668
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,480
Address?

669
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,409
The same, sir.

670
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,449
- Uncle, uncle!
- Yes.

671
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,648
- Do you know the way to Serog'?
- Yes.

672
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,161
- Can you take us there?
- No.

673
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,086
Please help us. We are lost.

674
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,042
No.

675
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,645
Uncle, chewing gum?

676
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,765
- Uncle!
- Yes.

677
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,888
Do you know Tenzing's daughter?

678
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,007
No.

679
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,486
- Uncle!
- Yes.

680
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,843
Don't you say anything except yes or no?

681
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,001
No.

682
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,645
Uncle, take this watch.

683
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,247
- Uncle?
- Yes.

684
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,767
- Are there Maoists in this forest?
- Yes.

685
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,242
Maoists, I'll sprinkle chili
in their eyes.

686
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,609
Don't say that.
My sister Bijuli joined the Maoists.

687
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,245
See...

688
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,610
I ran into Bijuli
when the Maoists took Surbir away.

689
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,524
Why didn't you tell me?

690
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,483
I was scared you'd get angry.

691
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,250
Think I'm happy novW

692
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,686
You betrayed me,

693
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,923
when I've come so far for you.

694
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,885
Grandpa was right.
Never trust Untouchables.

695
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,121
Too bad your grandpa
wasn't abducted instead of Surbir.

696
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,931
You son of a bitch,

697
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,646
I'll break your legs.

698
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,969
Stop fighting like dogs.
Aren't you best friends?

699
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,328
Stop! Stop!

700
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,047
I know it's not easy!

701
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,608
My son was killed in this war,
Maoists or...

702
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,169
- What are you doing?
- Quiet!

703
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,689
I want to go home.

704
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,325
Let's wait a while.

705
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,211
We'll find some food and then go back.

706
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,283
Just be patient.

707
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,171
What about our Karishma?

708
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,928
Forget about it.
Whatever happens will happen.

709
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,129
What? You're a liar!

710
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,647
You brought me here just to forget it?

711
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,411
We could have died. Son of a bitch.

712
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,642
You ruined my life for Karishma.

713
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,211
I hate you. Stay away.

714
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,441
Get away!

715
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,209
I'll go and get Karishma back myself.

716
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,284
Hey, didn't you hear, I am hungry!

717
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,330
Stupid monkey.

718
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,767
These are such nice chicks.

719
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,608
Your dream has come true.

720
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,605
Have you gone mad?

721
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,887
Poor chicks.
They need to be with their mother.

722
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,246
Let them be.

723
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,967
<i>This is Radio Nepal.</i>

724
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:33,047
<i>Now the headlines
