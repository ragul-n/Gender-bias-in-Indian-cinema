1
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:19,263
R.V. ... R.V. ... R.V. ...

2
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:30,977
R for ... ... Raj
V for ... ... Veer

3
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:40,682
R.V. ... R.V. ... R.V. ...

4
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:05,372
R.V. ... R.V. ... R.V. ...

5
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:29,628
R.V. ... R.V. ... R.V. ...

6
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:41,481
This is my papa!
The whole world calls him.. R.V.

7
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,384
He is the best... best... best racer in the
world!!

8
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,912
Do you want to know how
he became the best racer?

9
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,329
This is the same stadium where
my papa started his career.

10
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,527
But, not as a racer but
as a tyre changer!

11
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,938
Papa had not even completed his studies
when his parents passed away!

12
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,374
He had to leave the school
& thus started working.

13
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,344
And he became a tyre changer
in one of the racing team.

14
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,579
The fastest tyre changer
in the world!

15
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,410
With the biggest dream!

16
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,951
Just as seven dwarfs helped the snow white...

17
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,714
Mom helped Papa.

18
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,955
Papa turned to racer
from tyre changer.

19
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,424
When he met Mom.

20
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,392
lt's very funny story!

21
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,590
One day, Papa was
going somewhere.

22
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,502
He never follows any plan
in all the things he do!

23
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,671
Therefore, he is always late.

24
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,008
What the hell, men?
You are not men, you are late..

25
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,978
50th Broadway... .
Hey, listen are you new here?

26
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,412
ln America, the driver
sits ahead & passenger behind.

27
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,586
Oh my god! l'm seeing $ 100 for the first time,
since last 1 1/2 months.

28
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,422
See, the fare for Broadway
from here is $ 20.

29
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,391
Whatever is left is yours...
only when you'll allow me to drive!

30
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:06,766
When papa is in a rush, he trust only one
person's driving... Only himself!!

31
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,370
For this, no matter he has to give $ 1 00
instead of $ 20!

32
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,373
Do you have License?
- Hop in there!

33
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,374
But, drive carefully!

34
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,811
l'm the only cabbie here, who hasn't got any
ticket yet! Get it. - Got it!

35
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,214
Oolumbia University, 1 1 6th Street, Broadway.

36
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,282
Oabbie is already occupied, Madam.
- What?

37
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,579
l don't have time for this?

38
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,753
Hey... what are you doing?

39
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,398
Hey... the police will catch us.

40
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,273
What are you doing?

41
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,583
Superb driving!
l say break the record today itself.

42
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,385
You are Michael Schumacher!

43
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,875
lf l'll have time, l'll sue you guys with this!

44
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,652
l think you are right, buddy!
What buddy? l need to talk to you more...

45
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,963
Oh my god!

46
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,328
You flabby!

47
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,264
Wow!

48
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,527

49
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,403
You're beautiful!
l think l'm in love!!

50
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,375
l could hear some music.
- My i-pod.

51
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,273
Your i-pod!

52
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,284
What happened to it?
- Play & check.

53
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,952
lt's going on but not stopping.

54
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,255
Hey sister, do you know his value?
- $ 50!

55
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,189
l'm sorry.

56
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:45,892
And you are?

57
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,621
Thank god.
- Thank god!!

58
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,364
Your name is Thank god?
Radhika Shekhar Rai Banerjee.

59
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,632
ls it this much or more?

60
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:56,398
So, l would lovingly call you Radhika Shekhar
Rai Banerjee.

61
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,372
You call me happily or angrily but first you
come with me.

62
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,169
Wait... wait..wait..
Hey, wait.. - l'm getting late!

63
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,537
Ooffee.
- Music class!

64
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,847
Hey dude, what is your problem, man?

65
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,917
Hey, come on. Leave this girl.
Time waste, money waste... Oome with Harry.

66
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,952
Now tell me your name?
- Rajveer Singh.

67
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,922
Therefore, sister left you & went away.

68
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,758
Rajveer Singh. Should be changed.

69
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,526
Hey, who are you to change my name?

70
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,795
Speeding saddles.
- Saddle?

71
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,432
The racing team.
- Oh! Speeding Saddles.

72
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,567
Same to same.

73
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,835
Hari Prasad Dhirubhai Patel,
team manager.

74
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,234
But, you can call me Harry Potter.

75
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,840
But, buddy! Your team...
Yes, not doing very well these days.

76
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,364
For that reason, l'm driving this taxi.

77
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,680
Even now, when a dream is shattered in New
York... A new taxi driver is born.

78
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,815
Most of the driver you see here...

79
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:47,684
some are doctor, lT whizkid, or some
Hollywood star.

80
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:52,586
Everybody saw a big dream! When it was
broken, everybody became taxi driver.

81
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,562
But, my man. You wait & see,
if everything goes right,

82
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,231
Harry will never drive a taxi. Ask why?

83
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,858
What else you'll do, Harry?

84
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,004
Actually, our teams winning racer
ran with my 1 3th girl friend.

85
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,239
Therefore, there was some tension.

86
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,643
Actually, just kidding! There wasn't 13th, as
it's unlucky.

87
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,578
Therefore, l jumped from 1 2th to 1 4th.

88
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,581
But, now Speeding Saddles
will be back to number 1 !

89
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,708
That's great!
You've found some new driver or what?

90
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,485
What a jokes!

91
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,390
R.V.
How would be R.V.?

92
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,860
l don't know? l've never seen him.
ls he good? - ls he good!

93
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,331
My brother from another mother!
He is mind blowing!

94
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,401
This is the way, Mom & Papa met each other.

95
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,038
Not exactly, love at fiirst sight situation.
But, this is New York.

96
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,370
Here, love at first sight never happens.

97
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:48,414
Mom was learning music in New York. Mom
is the best best best piano player in the world!

98
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:54,353
Papa teases her by calling Atty-Fatty.
They could not ever become a couple.

99
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,455
But believe me, they did.

100
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,446
Ohamp & myself, are the proof.

101
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,666
Aunty Sasha, mom's best friend,
class mate & house mate.

102
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,833
All rolled into one.

103
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,704
Speed up!
- Oh, l'm already walking. l can't fly...

104
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,195
Don't know? Once you get up from the piano,
you are in a slow motion.

105
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,904
Damn, my i-pod!
Yeah, damn your i-pod!

106
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,247
l threw it so many times in the dust bin &
you take it out each time.

107
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:21,881
lt's like so uncool.

108
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,582
l've taken itjust 6 months ago.
Why should l throw it?

109
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,385
Then, why are you fighting with it?
Why isn't it stopping?

110
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:31,323
l bumped with a fool. He only felled it.
Like ugly bozo or good looking bozo?

111
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,728
Bozo like... nice bozo!
But, he broke my i-pod.

112
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,332
Okay, like... you repair this after the dinner.
See, we have only 1 hour to get ready.

113
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,269
What? Only one hour!
You are like, such an idiot like..

114
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,793
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Oome on speed up!

115
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,649
No Harry, we already have Danny with us.
- Oome on, Billy.

116
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,752
As is Speeding Saddles will lose because of
him. lsn't it?

117
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,354
lt's not Seddles, Harry. lt's Saddles.

118
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,622
Okay, sorry!
Same to same.

119
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,351
My 7th girl friend always use to tell...

120
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,861
lt's not 7th but 8th.
ln fact, 7th could not even speak.

121
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,665
My 8th girl friend use to tell that...
East or West never rest until you find the best!

122
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,826
And the best, he is!

123
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:22,238
Best... He's best to drive only a taxi.
lndians are best only at that!

124
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,402
Fact is a fact...

125
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,517
Then, let's see who is fact &
who is defect.

126
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,817
Oan we have a race, between R.V. & Danny?
The one who is the winner, is our racer.

127
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,986
My 4th girl friend always use to tell me...
All right... all right. Let them race.

128
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:43,918
Fantastics!

129
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,415
Warming up!
- Wasting time.

130
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,760
Oome on, Danny.

131
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,241
Harry... . Billy.

132
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,300
Don't he know to apply brakes?

133
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:39,285
Awesome... Awesome... Awesome

134
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,288
Where were you in my life, till now?
No problem, you've come now.

135
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,257
Everything is going to be awesome, now.

136
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,748
My 6th girl friend always use to tell...
What she used to say?

137
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,321
Very deep thought! You'll never understand.
Let it be.

138
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:53,362
You keep this. $ 5000 Oash, for 3 races.

139
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,272
lf your performance is better than you'll have
contract with Speed Saddles.

140
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,240
$ 5000!!

141
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,342
- Yes, it's a bit less but we'll increase it
afterwards...

142
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,240
What l'll do with so much money?

143
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,872
My 1 0th girl friend slapped me here.
Speak a bit louder.

144
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,383
What l'll do with so much money?
Okay, got it! Got it!

145
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,213
At least you keep some.

146
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,855
This is yours. Remember l'm the team
manager.

147
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,291
As is after watching your speed Billy have
started taking care of my money as well.

148
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,696
Are you sure?
Why are you exhibiting it? Keep it inside.

149
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,687
And always count it before taking cash..

150
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,656
Now, how could l count
before taking the cash?

151
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,439
You have to learn. You have a lot to learn.

152
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,808
Now, take $ 1 000 from it & come tomorrow
to Fast Track store at 8'o clock.

153
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,014
Not in the morning, is it?
- Then at night or what?

154
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,016
We need to buy racing gear &
after that a hair cut.

155
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,247
What's wrong with my hair?
You want to be a model or race driver?

156
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,322
Now, you need to rehearse. 1 1 'o clock sharp.

157
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,458
Practice!
Early to bed & early to rise!

00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,256
Don't tell me, your 8th girl friend.

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,599
Hey stop... stop.
Don't stop! Where are you going? - Home!

160
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,435
Are you crazy?
Now you'll come with me to celebrate.

00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,382
Okay, sister has gone. Ohapter 1 closed!

165
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,443
Ohapter 2... race. When we'll win, we'll
celebrate then. Before that what party?

166
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,423
No...No. We'll party first because l got the
chance of race.

167
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,358
We'll party after race because we did race.

168
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,427
We are not going to lose.
We will party anyhow. Get it!

169
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
Okay!
- Good.

170
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,861
Oome town please!

171
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,366
Party had already started.

172
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,432
Bethoven is amazing
but no Sariah is over rated.

173
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,764
Sariah was so better than him.

174
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,446
They have said the secret lies...
in the end it is wine..

175
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,315
Wine! Why don't say to wine?

176
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:55,321
l must also say that l don't know my wines?
Allow me. - Stand, l will order wine.

177
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,256
Why are you lying. Let him order the wine.

178
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,351
lf l'll not order, then he'll
start lecturing on wine.

179
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,456
l was supposed to carry on
with this crazy fellow..

180
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,827
What did l know that he'll be this way?
Look wise, he seems to be okay.

181
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,208
Well, when you've come here then, drink &
enjoy. But, not more than 2 glasses. Okay.

182
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,544
l'm trying to explain but, she insists.

183
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,676
That's great! l'm trying for the woman
who's able order her own wine. Excuse me!

184
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:30,288
Nobody could guess seeing Mom, that she is
a daughter of a very very big business man?

185
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,360
This one.
Mom is Mom!

186
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,229
ln terms of money, she is always careful.

187
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,491
Wine is ordered.

188
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,571
Mom ordered wine so that she could
get excitement in this dull party.

189
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:50,975
And Papa's apartment was small enough for
excitement! His party was rocking!

190
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,189
When Papa means friends.
lt does not means his friend?

191
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,225
Friends!
Friend's friend!!

192
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,785
Friend's friend's friend!!!
And so on...

193
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,204
Mom always order very cheap wine.

194
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,342
And Papa spends money as is,
he is a emperor of New York!

195
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,800
Keep the change!
Distribute among the poors!!

196
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,382
Hey, you king! Who's poor, here?

197
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,613
Hey, Mr. Manager... chill!
lf he has taken, let him take away.

198
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,459
Aunty Sasha had warned Mom,
only 2 glasses.

199
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,859
But, thank god! Mom never listened to her.

200
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:51,258
Why we are sitting like a well behaved
children? Let's dance!

201
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:57,409
Hey, Stanley. Every time you keep
Yak..yak..yak..

202
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,707
Don't you dance? Boring!

203
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,451
Dance is a very good exercise.
Oalf muscles... thigh muscles..

204
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,611
Hip muscles...

205
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:12,320
Radhika!!
- Dance keeps the doctor away!

206
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,828
Radhika, this isn't a dance club? lt's a
restaurant.

207
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,318
Then, we'll make it one.

208
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,724
They'll throw us out from here.

209
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,868
Good idea! Then, we'll order some more wine.

210
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:29,475
Then, no one could throw us out.
You've already had 3 glasses of wine.

211
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,670
Really?
- Really.

212
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,542
Radhika... Radhika, no more wines. Okay.

213
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,477
Oan we go to the toilet, please?

214
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:42,851
Excuse us, boys.

215
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,792
Sasha baby, just chill. l'm not drunked!

216
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,254
Now, this is rocking!

217
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,277
Now, this is rocking!

218
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,922
Hey...
- Hey!

219
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,206
And again.
-Again.

220
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,936
How did you searched me?
When did l lose you either.

221

You know, l was thinking...

00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,619

Broken bones!
Oops!

Surgery could do nothing,

267
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,362
Radhika, sometimes
you seem to be too miser!

268
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,104
Damn, stupid.. Oabbie.
Hello... sat here without seeking permission.

00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,514
Excuse me, how dare you!

This is please.. l'm in a big trouble. Okay.
Just 2 minutes.

00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,714
Who are you?
- Who are you?

272
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,854
We are we. - No, not you. Who did speak
before you?

273
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,322
l didn't tell, l spoke.

274
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,891
Yeah, you. Say something.
- Something!

275
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,449
Oh! Say some thing else.

276
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,262
Doye mifa sola tino.

278
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,424
But, your voice... .

279
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,568
Even, l've heard your voice

00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,602
And this is crazy!

281
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,606
And you guys are making me crazy.
Hey, get this away. - No, my landlord!

282
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,842
Where is he?

00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,781

Excuse me!

00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,217
Excuse me! He is right here,

Just kidding! He has left

Hey, you!
lsn't it a magic!

292
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,501
Papa spent the whole money on the party.
There was nothing left to pay for the rent.

293
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,771
lf he had planned then how could he
have met Mom for the 3rd time.

294
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,007
l love Papa & his bad habits!

295
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:53,578
Radhika Shekhar.. what was after that?
Rai Banerjee, Oabbie.

296
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,480
Oabbie?
- Of course, cabbie.

297
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,383
Don't you remember?
You broke my i-pod. $ 50.

298
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,186
$ 50? You use a very expensive i-pod!

299
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,255
He is the one?
- Yes, it's me.

300
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,958
Hey, yesterday night you were quite rocking!

301
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,461
Where did you disappear?
- Yesterday night?

302
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,197
Yesterday night, that... $ 50?

303
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:18,236
Oan you believe it, Shona! - Shona?
Yes, it means sweet, in Bengali.

304
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,438
Oh, really! l don't know Bengali at all.

305
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,574
And l've already researched
on Bong's (Bengali)

306
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,377
Banerjee is equal to Bong.
But, l'm not equal to Shona.

307
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,280
You are Bong, sweet and Shona.
You are equal to Shona.

308
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,349
So what? $ 50.

309
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,182
Shona, whenever we meet...
Your pocket is empty!

310
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,344
Yes. Why is it so...
Enough excuses, Oabbie.

311
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,258
l'm not a cabbie. l'm a racer!

312
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,394
You are a liar!
- Okay!

313
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,596
l'll prove it today evening. Do come on the
race track.

314
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,894
Why should l come?
lf you'll not come then, l'll lose the race.

315
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:51,002
l'll not come.
Look Shona, l got the opportunity to race

316
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,238
only after meeting you... . for the first time!

317
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,640
And after meeting you, l broke my i-pod,
For the first time!

318
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,243
You are my lucky charm!
You are my unlucky charm!!

319
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,711
You are asking her so sweetly &
she's like i-pod!

320
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,272
Forget her, l'll come.
Shall l forget her?

321
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,343
Excuse me... Harry! l got to go.

322
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,856
My i-pod!
- Hey, this one has broken down.

323
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,225
Do come to collect $ 50 to buy a new one,
today evening at New York Speed Way...

324
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,489
5 p.m. sharp. Bye!

325
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,332
How much time is left to 5 p.m.?
We are not going there.

326
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,597
But, he is so cute!
He is a liar & thief!

327
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,418
Have you come here to be
a model or a driver?

328
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,221
This is not a fashion show.
Now come & concentrate on the race.

329
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,280
How could l concentrate on the race?

330
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:50,395
There are 2 fast drivers in this race.
One is Mighty Mike & Joltin Jack.

331
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,766
Has Radhika come?
l don't believe that!

332
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,269
This is your first bloody race &
you are bothered of that i-pod!

333
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,305
Oome on, buddy! Ooncentrate.
Pay attention to the race.

334
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,340
Okay! Race...race...race.

335
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,176
Jackin Jolt & who was the other... Mickey
mouse!!

336
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,612
Mighty Mike & Joltin Jack.

337
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,848
Hello. See here & not there.

338
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,611
Let me see once..
whether she has come or not?

339
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,620
Oh my god, Harry!
So many people!

340
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,392
l can't do this!
- Shut up, Okay!

341
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,962
Even big sportsman, feel nervous
when they see such crowds!!

342
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,531
Look, you go... see your car, see your
steering.

343
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:30,262
See the tracks, see on your right track then on
the left. But, don't see the crowd!

344
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,938
Shona...what non-sense?
Radhika!

345
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,240
Hey...
- Hi!

346
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,280
l knew you'll come.
This is my friend, Harry.

347
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,382
Hey, you mad Harry...

348
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,951
Why did you bring a Romeo to make him a
racer! Go & drive a taxi, as earlier..

349
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,487
Oome on, let's race!
Now, Radhika has come.r..

350
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,752
Will you race by walking?
Do sit in your car.

351
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,761
Speeding Saddles haven't won a race for
almost 2 years!

352
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,265
They'll be trying their luck this time with a
rookie R.V. Singh.

353
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,667
A pick stop pilot changer till now.
This is his first race.

354
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,803
Let's see how much he knew for Speeding
Saddles

355
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,405
R.V... R.V... R.V...

356
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,374
Oheer, at least... when you've come here.

357
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,309
l've come to collect my $ 50.

358
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,278
You'll get it, once he wins!

359
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,315
Wow! He looks so hot in red, isn't he?

360
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:22,480
R.V... R.V... R.V...

361
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,727
R.V. if we lose this race then, Speeding
Saddles will be... ...

00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:34,432
Ohill Bill. From today onwards, Speeding

Bye! Bye!!

366
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,315
Hey, Harry. This is fun!

367
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,050
l'll break your head.

368
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,314
lt's already 40 laps getting over.
Please come to change the tyres!!

369
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:03,947
Oome on...

370
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,518
Who is this guy & from
where he has come from?

371
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,666
Shona... Hey!!

372
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,376
Go...go..go..

373
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,269
R.V. there's a case at 2nd brim.

374
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,004
l can't see further from it.w.

375
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,706
You get off from under the smoke.

376
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,441
What?? Are you sure?

377
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,310
Do as l say. You close your eyes & get the car

378
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,245
from the right side of the smoke.
- Okay, Harry!

379
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,821
Yes!! We did it, Harry!

380
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,848
Hey, Harry. What's this going on, man?

381
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,453
This is welcome to racing!

382
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,393
What are you doing? You just give the
acceleration.

383
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,448
That's called bump traffic. - Bump Traffic!

384
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,211
l think he'll do that.

385
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,724

Whatever l say to you, you feel affirmation!

401
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:43,254
Leave all this & come closer to tell me...

402
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:55,689

Even l've asked from this life... nothing
except you.

405
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:31,268
Now within this desire...
Now on this path only...

416
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,581
Man, you're just mind blowing!

417
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,283
Only at a glance of this ring, you guessed the
price, showroom.

418
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,019
You don't have money ton pay for your
apartment.

419
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,721
From where did you buy this $ 55,000 ring?

420
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:35,493
Shona, my knees are paining.
l am holding this ring for quite sometime now?

421
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,328
First go & pay your apartments rent.
- Now?

422
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,496
Now, l don't have the money.

423
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:43,834
You spent the whole on it? - Not, exactly.
l have saved $ 50-$ 60. Will do for today.

424
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,436
lt's for today. What will you do for tomorrow?

425
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,305
Will you sell it to eat?
Never. This is for you.

426
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,743
l'll sell off this bed. - You...
Shona, l'm just kidding! Listen.

427
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,479
Tomorrow l am signing a sponsorship contract
with Aveo.

428
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,415
Once l sign the contract. First thing,
rent! l promise!

429
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,316
Tomorrow...tomorrow.

430
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:00,651
lf your tomorrow doesn't come then...

431
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,221
What was today with you, you lost!
Where have l? lt's still in my hands.

432
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,223
Tell me Yes or No.

433
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,747
l can't believe it. This mad fellow...

434
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,018
Shona... Shona... Listen to me.
Yes or No.

435
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,274
There's a race after 2 days therefore he is
taking an extra lap.

436
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,283
Only 5 minutes.

437
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,418
Practice...Race.
More practice...more race...

438
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,921
He is a very busy man!

439
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,928
When do he goes to college?
What he'll do now going to college?

440
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:54,736
Have he completed college? Arts Or Science?
He's never been to college!

441
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,908
You mean no college degree.

442
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:03,244
l mean when he is so successful, famous &
happy then what's the need of a degree?

443
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:09,286
Right. What's degree.
Just a piece of paper.

444
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,846
Oome on, Pa.
Don't be so sarcasm.

445
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,770
He's so popular?
Yes, especially with girls.

446
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:35,803
Don't you feel jealous?
- Yes, a bit.

447
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,578
But, l trust him!

448
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:47,424
So, how did you like my new car?
This car? - Yes, l purchased it right now.

449
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,728
lf you'll drive such an expensive car then
where will we stay after our marriage?

450
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:51,528
How can you be so irresponsible?

451
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,031
Do you ever think of where you should
spend your money?

452
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,499
Oockroach! Worry!!

453
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,334
Oome on R.V. Get serious.

454
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,337
Shona, chill now. There's no need to pay the
entire amount now.

00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:04,875
Some now & some later.

456
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,365
5 years. Ohill!

457

Pa... R.V.
R.V...Pa.

Mr. Subha Shekhar Rai Banerjee.

459
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,255
Then, even l'll lovingly
call you Subha Shekhar...

460
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:23,260
Sorry, l mean Mr. Subha Shekhar... Subhu
Shekhar..

461
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,598
Excuse me. l'm a bit nervous.
Plain in simple, shall l call you Pappa?

462
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,225
Pappa sounds good.

463
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,270
l like him.
- l knew it.

464
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,981
But, not that much so that
you get ready to marry him!

465
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,687
Who is telling you to marry?
R.V. is not fit for you.

466
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,595
Small name...small stature.

467
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:03,498
l'm not talking money.
l know that he is too rich & famous!

468
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,337
l'm talking of stature, here...

469
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:11,275
To become your life partner, one should have
At least, your level of intellectual.

470
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,845
He is different from you & me, but he
possesses intellect.

471
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:15,746
Oh, really!

472
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:19,483
From which car dealer he got it from?
Oome on, Pa.

473
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,347

00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,962
By learning all these your intellect has born.

477
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,293
What did he study?.

478
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,768
ln the name of literature... Sports page.

479
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:41,226
He knows only this much of Maths,
that he could calculate horse power.

480
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:46,666
And foreign language? May be he knows only
one word in ltalian - Ferrari.

481
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,380
But, l love him!
And he loves me!!

He'll love me tomorrow as well, Pa.

484
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:58,388
Does he really thinks of tomorrow?
Today's race, today's victory...

485
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,652
You've always planned for tomorrow.

486
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:05,763
When you were just 1 0 years of age,
you've already planned to be a pianoist.

487
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,465
That l learned from you.
lt even was useful to me.

488
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:12,236
To live life in present moment & happiness.
l've learned from R.V.

489
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:12,970
Even that'll be useful sometimes.

490
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:18,642
Okay, then you enjoy this moment with him.
l understand. He is handsome, sportsman...

491
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,244
Have even earned money!

492
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,647
What's the need to get married?
- Pa?

493
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,171
Let's be frank.

494
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,986
l married your mother, after
a thorough thought.

495
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:34,625
But, before that l had dated 3-4 girls...

496
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,660
Feelings..
- Feelings?

497
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:42,366
l know. lt's strange to hear it.
Affair! Heaven affair!!

498
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,402
And forget this R.V.
- Enough!

499
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,639
Don't insult your son-in-law, anymore.
He is not my son-in-law.

500
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,307
He is my husband!
Have you gone mad!

501
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,243
Today, you are inventing him.
Tomorrow you'll repent.

502
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:58,882
Tomorrow, we are marrying!
lf you'll come, we'll be happy.

503
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,351
lf you'll not come then... you only taught,

504
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,355
whether pain
is given by own people or others...

505
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:09,359
one should move forward
leaving all sorrows behind.

506
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,353
l couldn't follow your every teachings but l'll
surely follow this. Tomorrow morning... at 10.

507
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:36,987
You Radhika...Shkhaaa...

509
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,764
Superb, uncle! Proceed further.

Oan we kiss, now!

512
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,668
Be a little patient. The formalities
haven't yet finished.

513
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,535
You take Radhika Shekhar... Hey, the bride
hasn't changed.

514
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,654
lf you take so much long name then the
couple will become old.

515
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,522
She said Radhika is fine.
- Fine!

516
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,826
Radhika is your lovely wedding wife.
Yes, l do.

517
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:20,530
And now l declare you man & wife.
Now the kiss! - Oontinue...

00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,665

519
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,201
Wedding ring?

520
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,336

00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,396
How could you?
- lt's a jokes!! Here it is...

522
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,387
l don't think you should be kissing the bride
for having her at this speed!

523
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,254
You want to get out. You carry on...

524
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,214
This is our house!

525
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,416
The best best best house in the world!

526
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:51,488
Because here lives R.V., Shona, Ohamp
and Princess means myself.

527
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,285
Our family of four.

528
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,236
So this way, Papa from a tyre changer
became a super star racer!

529
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:09,873
How cute story, isn't it?
Just like a fairy tale!

530
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:22,445
R.V... R.V... . R.V...
R.V... R.V... . R.V...

531
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:41,304
You may not get the wind in the 2nd lap, but
the 4th lap would be against the wind.

532
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:46,401
My 9th girl friend used to tell - Harry, when the
wind is in the opposite direction,

533
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,370
Go win, cabbie!!

Don't burn out the tyres.

536
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,346
Where am l my fast, Harry, it seems others
are slow today!

537
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,404
l don't know what it is?

538
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,258
Harry, l'm coming into the pitt.

539
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,398
Get it, go...

540
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:07,712
R.V. be careful. Rusty Oar # 2 coming up...

Let it come, buddy! As is
l'm getting bored here...

00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,842
Enough R.V. Stop fooling around!

543
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:03,729
Go R.V. Go kill him!!

544
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,417
R.V. move from the right.

545
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:35,356
Ohamp you remain with princess.
Princess you take care of champ.

546
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,649
Everything would be allright, Harry?

547
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,776
Then, what? R.V. is a fighter!

548
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,288
l know, but he has to fight more...

549
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,628
Doctors were saying, that they'd
rescan him again.

550
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,465
Doctors are fools! You don't bother.

551
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:46,236
l'm not doing it for myself.

552
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:50,807
Then, you & myself will bring
him back on the track.

553
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:55,471
ls it alright?
-Alright!

554
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:05,884
We'll definitely put him on the track.

Princess. - What?

557
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,229
Why did you bring him inside?
This is his house too.

558
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,237
No princess. This isn't his house.

559
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,306
This house does not belong to any of the dog.

560
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,408
We don't like dogs.
We don't like dogs.

561
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,500
l love dogs!

562
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:03,508
They are very dirty, they bark & wag their
tail... They are stupid!

563
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,183
They are stupid!
Daddy, l don't like dogs.

564
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,451
Daddy, please Bruno will live with us.

565
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,753
Okay. l vote.

566
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,355

00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,957
Yeah, we win!!

568
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:14,724
Doggy out!!

569
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,214
That's not fair! Mamma...

570
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,885
Why do you'll got up so early to shout.

571
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,767
Oh my god!
- See what princess brought at home.

572
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,537
We don't like dogs.
- Why, Ohamp?

573
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,572
Dad, why don't we like dogs?

574
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,874
He's so cute!

575
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:35,745
From where did you get him?
We'll call him...Bruno!

576
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,847
No.. No. We'll not call him anything.

577
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,983
Please Shona, we don't like dogs.

578
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,382
You tell something..

579
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,676
Bruno will live with us. End of discussion..

580
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,789
He'll be hungry, poor one. You'll have
breakfast.

581
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,993
Oome on, princess. What shall we give him?

582
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,221
You want milk?

583
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,364
Ohics, l tell you!
- Yeah, man!

584
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,781
Doctors stated that R.V. couldn't race again.

585
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,551
But during the course of one year, R.V. fought
back with his ailment.

586
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,855
And today, R.V. is coming back to track to
challenge Rusty Flinton Stannes.

587
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,591
ln the past one year, Rusty has maintained
the number 1 position.

588
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:26,930
Lets see whether R.V. could retain his place
or not? Of course! What's the point in asking?

589
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,465
Whether he'll be able to defeat Rusty Flinton
Stannes?

590
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:33,196
But, expert feels that Rusty is no doubt the
number 1 racer.

591
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:41,266
Are you sure, you are ready to go back to the
race track?

592
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:46,349
All these stupid news channel!
You called me stupid?

593
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,214
What a dumb question you asked me...

594
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:56,416
Are you sure?
Of course!

595
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,285

596
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:05,401
Daddy... Ohamp 1 st & Princess 2nd...

01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,242
Princess, show me your tongue.

Don't laugh. - Sorry.
Don't cheat! Very bad!

601
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,621
Hey, team..

01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,934
Oome, l'll teach you 2 tricks

605
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,868
Okay, Harry.
- Even myself.

606
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,274
R.V. what's the rush?

607
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,712
Okay. Honestly tell me.. You are sure?

608
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:54,350
ls it black? No. l'm not telling a lie.

609

610
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,020
Hey Oabbie!

611
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,553
Shut up! That was for me.

612
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,865
Go win, cabbie!

613
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,241
Doing good!... doing good!!

614
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,255
How far is R.V.?

615
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,832
R.V. Rusty is taking a lead from right side...

616
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,231
You take a lead from left side.

617
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,428
l am on the left side, driving...
Go left side.. R.V.

618
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,307
Okay, last lap R.V.

Oome on R.V.

Okay, time me again.

01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,895
How could they remove me this way?

646
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,242
Billy said that he gave you chance for 10
races.

647
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:04,178
BYou should have come 2nd or 3rd but
last in every race.

648
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:11,654
l know that l came last in 10 races but
l have come 1st in 50 races as well.

649
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:16,792
l'll speak to Billy.
- lt's of no use.

650
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:20,159
He'll not meet you.
Billy will not meet me??

651
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,866
Sorry, R.V. Boss is in the meeting.

652
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,375
Do hell with the contract.
Do hell with Speeding Saddles.

653
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:37,680
And do hell with Billy.

654
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:42,218
Oome on, let's go get up there...
You leave, l have some work.

655
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:46,355
What work you have here, now?
l'm the manager of this team.

656
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:49,552
R.V. is the team!
lf l'm not there, then what team?

657
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:57,500
Billy has signed Rusty!
Rusty! You are with Rusty?

658
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,596
What else l could do, R.V.?
Even l have a family.

659
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:07,442
Father has expired. l have 3 sisters.
l need to send money home...

660
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,302
Even l have some compulsion, buddy....

661
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:19,148
l'm sorry, R.V.
l can't leave this job!

662
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:24,193
Where am l telling you to retire..
We'll make our own team.

663
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,320
We'll get the investor in no time...

664
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,757
lnvestor could give you
money, not speed!

665
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,535
Look, l know that my
speed is decreased a bit.

666
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:36,438
Okay, you are there... you can solve this
problem.

667
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:42,604
What else am l doing for the last 3 months?
Your problem could not be recuperated.

668
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:49,678
Every sportsman go higher... higher & peaks.
And then everything...

669
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:55,751
The one is wise who retires before anything
happens.

670
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:02,591
Listen to me. You retire... gracefully.
Everybody will forget 1 0 races!

671
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,804
But, will remember Speed king!

672
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:12,604
Hang on! Hang on! You are Speeding
Saddles manager speaking.

673
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:17,645
You fear that l'll be back on the tracks & that
l'll defeat Rusty.

674
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,573
For this you are telling me to retire.

675
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:26,711
Any team would hire me at once & then
we'll meet again at the tracks... as a rivals!

676
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,693
Then l'll show you, how
much speed is still left in me!

677
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,888
Then l'll show you, how much speed is still left
in me!

678
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,038
You are my brother, that's why l am advising
you.

679
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:43,868
Just shut up!

680
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:38,694
lf there is any sorrow...
You do not worry at all.

681
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:43,859
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

682
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:50,906
lf you have the trust, then
joy is about to come!

683
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:57,713
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

684
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:03,619
lf there's night, then there is morning too! lf
journey is there, then there is destination too!

685
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:08,857
We sing smilingly in front of sorrows...

686
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:15,592
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

687
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:44,593
Hey, stop... stop! What you guys are doing?
Where are you taking my car?

688
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,390
We came along to take back your car.

689
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:54,336
lt's been one whole year.
We've not earn a single dollar atleast.

690
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:58,340
Bank balance is almost zero.
All credits are cancelled..

691
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,576
We are lucky that our phone's are still
working.

692
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,771
We are still getting water & electricity.

693
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,815
However, even these will be of no use ahead.
- Why?

694
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,307
House loans... installments for 6 months.
So, what's the big deal?

695
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,377
We could sell some of our things...
We can't sell!

696
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:18,752
Nothing is ours. All are purchased either on
loan or credit card.

697
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:23,565
These furniture, carpet, curtains, our clothes,
your suit. Even your shoes too.

698
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,902
Okay. l agree that we've taken all the things
on loan.

699
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:31,669
But, sometimes there's delay while repaying.
So, they'll not remove us from the house?

700
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,808
They can't do that?

701
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:46,321
lf there's anything short in life or
lf there's a bit of tear in your eyes...

702
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:55,330
You keep yourself happy but never lose to the
world. Don't fear at all & don't remain allay!

703
01:13:55,330 --> 01:14:05,441
Smilingly tell the whole world...
... that happy day's will surely come back

704
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:08,777
& this season will surely change!!

705
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:15,384
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

706
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:19,421
Yeah. We have become poor!
To become poor is a bad thing.

707
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:20,856
Daddy, l don't want to be poor.

708
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,759
lt's not a bad thing.
lt's a bit difficult but there's nothing

709
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,861
wrong in being a poor.

710
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:30,299
But, if l'm poor then l'll have to leave the
school. l'll have to leave Mrs.Peggy.

711
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,359
You don't have to leave her, never

712
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,371
We only need to do acting of being poor.

713
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:40,603
lt's like a game!
Right? - Yes.

714
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,445
Yeah, lt's a game! lt's a game!

715
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:47,783
Which game? - lt's called
'Don't worry... be happy'

716
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:50,719
What type of a game is this?
- lt's a reality game!

717
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,688
For T.V.
- We'll come on T.V.

718
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:53,589
Yes.

719
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:57,326
What does reliaity show means?
lt's reality & not reliaity.

720
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:02,197
There are separate teams in it.
They have to stay at some weird place.

721
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:05,400
Say, some island, holiday towers or a jungle.

722
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,804
There are hidden cameras,
which shoots every team.

723
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,796
Then, the best team is the winner! Simple.

724
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:13,675
Where we have to live?

725
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:19,381
ln a small house, just like poor people lives
in.. And we'll have only $ 2000.

726
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:23,283
But, we'll never be sad. This way...

727
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,389
Someone might be watching us
from the hidden camera.

728
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:31,393
lf anyone sees us this way...
then we are out!

729
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,860
We need to remain happy... always!
This way...

730
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:40,402
And the team which remains happy for the
most number

731
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,461
of days in $ 2000, will be the winners!!

732
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:51,880
Okay. Who'll play 'Don't worry, Be happy'
Promise me it's a game & school...

733
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,440
You'll not have to leave school. l promise!

734
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,251
Show your tongue.
Black or Pink? - Pink.

735
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:11,396
lf any storm comes, let it come...
The lamp in your heart shouldn't go off!

736
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:19,207
Let there be black nights...
Let there be any talks...

737
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:24,246
We need to keep moving!
Whatever problem comes...

738
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:28,283
our heart shouldn't fear it!
This is what we say...

739
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,253
lf these black clouds have come across for a
few moment...

740
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,555
The sunshine never keeps on moderate!!

741
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,546
We'll soon return, Mom?

742
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:39,861
Yes. As soon as the game is over, we'll return
to our home.

743
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,385
Home sweet home!

744
01:16:43,231 --> 01:17:00,240
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

745
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,404
Good Morning!
Oould you tell me where...

746
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,774
Your morning must be good.
For most of them is bad!

747
01:17:58,774 --> 01:17:59,763
Then too they say, good!

748
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:03,545
First you make sure, then tell.
Okay, never mind!

749
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,347
Would you tell me where's building # 21 6?

750
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:09,451
Why do we tell you? - Why should we tell
you? And what we'll get, if we tell also...

751
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,453
Nothing!!

752
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:15,253
What else you want?
- lt's empty...

753
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:22,864
$ 3 for direction? We are left with $ 1 997...
Daddy, this way we'll lose!

754
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,834
Look, we lost $ 3 by saving $10.

755
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,235
Or else we could be roaming from this
building to that...

756
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:30,338
Even now we are roaming!
Excuse me, pull over...please.

757
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:33,330
Excuse me, can you tell me where's building
# 216 is?

758
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,302
Daddy, we are back here again.

759
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:40,336
Oheers!!

760
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,244
Bloody...
- No, R.V.

761
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:48,317
Bruno, come here Bruno.

762
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,180
Hey, don't worry. They're all playing the game.

763
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,382
But, knife?
- Toy knife!.

764
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:17,853
They are trying to scare us. What Mama?
Yes, so that we are out!

765
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:22,858
But, are we stupid to get out of fear?
l'm not stupid. -Yes, you are not!

766
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:26,628
But, we have to be very careful! Every other
team will seek to get other team out.

767
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:30,291
Where are the cameras here?
- Oould be hidden anywhere.

768
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:36,471
Look...look, camera. l'm not crying... l'm
smiling!

769
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:37,836
Hey, champ!

770
01:19:55,579 --> 01:20:00,573
l couldn't follow your every teachings but l'll
surely follow this. Tomorrow morning... at 10.

771
01:20:14,432 --> 01:20:23,207
You Radhika...Shkhaaa...
lt's Radhika Rai... - Shona, short & sweet.

772
01:20:23,207 --> 01:20:31,982
lt has to be a full name.
Radhika Shekhar Rai Banerjee.

773
01:20:31,982 --> 01:20:33,984
Superb, uncle! Proceed further.

774
01:20:33,984 --> 01:20:41,826
You take Rajveer Singh... be your lovely
wedding husband? Yes, l do. - Yes, l do too.

775
01:20:41,826 --> 01:20:42,693
Oan we kiss, now!

776
01:20:42,693 --> 01:20:44,888
Be a little patient. The formalities
haven't yet finished.

777
01:20:45,796 --> 01:20:49,755
You take Radhika Shekhar... Hey, the bride
hasn't changed.

778
01:20:53,571 --> 01:20:56,874
lf you take so much long name then the
couple will become old.

779
01:20:56,874 --> 01:20:58,742
She said Radhika is fine.
- Fine!

780
01:20:58,742 --> 01:21:02,046
Radhika is your lovely wedding wife.
Yes, l do.

781
01:21:02,046 --> 01:21:06,750
And now l declare you man & wife.
Now the kiss! - Oontinue...

01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,885

783
01:21:07,885 --> 01:21:10,421
Wedding ring?

784
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:12,556

785
01:21:12,556 --> 01:21:15,616
How could you?
- lt's a jokes!! Here it is...

786
01:21:26,437 --> 01:21:29,607
l don't think you should be kissing the bride
for having her at this speed!

787
01:21:29,607 --> 01:21:32,474
You want to get out. You carry on...

788
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:30,434
This is our house!

789
01:22:30,434 --> 01:22:32,636
The best best best house in the world!

790
01:22:32,636 --> 01:22:37,708
Because here lives R.V., Shona, Ohamp
and Princess means myself.

791
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,505
Our family of four.

792
01:22:48,018 --> 01:22:52,456
So this way, Papa from a tyre changer
became a super star racer!

793
01:22:52,456 --> 01:22:56,093
How cute story, isn't it?
Just like a fairy tale!

794
01:22:56,093 --> 01:23:08,665
R.V... R.V... . R.V...
R.V... R.V... . R.V...

795
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:27,524
You may not get the wind in the 2nd lap, but
the 4th lap would be against the wind.

796
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:32,621
My 9th girl friend used to tell - Harry, when the
wind is in the opposite direction,

797
01:23:58,622 --> 01:24:00,590
Go win, cabbie!!

798
01:24:03,727 --> 01:24:05,490
R.V... R.V... . R.V...
R.V... R.V... . R.V...

799
01:24:35,893 --> 01:24:39,129
lt's 100 laps race, still 90 laps are remaining.
Don't burn out the tyres.

800
01:24:39,129 --> 01:24:42,566
Where am l my fast, Harry, it seems others

801
01:24:42,566 --> 01:24:43,624
l don't know what it is?

802
01:24:55,045 --> 01:24:56,478
Harry, l'm coming into the pitt.

803
01:25:10,594 --> 01:25:11,618
Get it, go...

804
01:25:53,637 --> 01:25:53,932
R.V. be careful. Rusty Oar # 2 coming up...

805
01:25:55,806 --> 01:25:57,865
Let it come, buddy! As is
l'm getting bored here...

806
01:26:27,538 --> 01:26:29,062
Enough R.V. Stop fooling around!

807
01:26:48,425 --> 01:26:49,949
Go R.V. Go kill him!!

808
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:07,637
R.V. move from the right.

809
01:28:18,015 --> 01:28:21,576
Ohamp you remain with princess.
Princess you take care of champ.

810
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:12,869
Everything would be allright, Harry?

811
01:29:12,869 --> 01:29:14,996
Then, what? R.V. is a fighter!

812
01:29:17,608 --> 01:29:19,508
l know, but he has to fight more...

813
01:29:21,011 --> 01:29:24,848
Doctors were saying, that they'd
rescan him again.

814
01:29:24,848 --> 01:29:28,685
Doctors are fools! You don't bother.

815
01:29:28,685 --> 01:29:32,456
l'm not doing it for myself.

816
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:37,027
Then, you & myself will bring
him back on the track.

817
01:29:37,027 --> 01:29:41,691
ls it alright?
-Alright!

818
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:52,104
We'll definitely put him on the track.

819
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:31,973
Princess... . Ohamp...

01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:34,449
Princess. - What?

821
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:37,449
Why did you bring him inside?
This is his house too.

822
01:30:37,888 --> 01:30:40,457
No princess. This isn't his house.

823
01:30:40,457 --> 01:30:42,526
This house does not belong to any of the dog.

824
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:44,628
We don't like dogs.
We don't like dogs.

825
01:30:44,628 --> 01:30:45,720
l love dogs!

826
01:30:46,463 --> 01:30:49,728
They are very dirty, they bark & wag their
tail... They are stupid!

827
01:30:51,401 --> 01:30:53,403
They are stupid!
Daddy, l don't like dogs.

828
01:30:53,403 --> 01:30:54,671
Daddy, please Bruno will live with us.

829
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:56,973
Okay. l vote.
No, No... . & Yes.

830
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:58,575

831
01:30:58,575 --> 01:31:00,177
Yeah, we win!!

832
01:31:00,177 --> 01:31:00,944
Doggy out!!

833
01:31:00,944 --> 01:31:02,434
That's not fair! Mamma...

834
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:06,105
Why do you'll got up so early to shout.

835
01:31:07,551 --> 01:31:10,987
Oh my god!
- See what princess brought at home.

836
01:31:10,987 --> 01:31:13,757
We don't like dogs.
- Why, Ohamp?

837
01:31:13,757 --> 01:31:15,792
Dad, why don't we like dogs?

838
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:17,094
He's so cute!

839
01:31:17,094 --> 01:31:21,965
From where did you get him?
We'll call him...Bruno!

840
01:31:21,965 --> 01:31:24,067
No.. No. We'll not call him anything.

841
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:26,203
Please Shona, we don't like dogs.

842
01:31:26,203 --> 01:31:27,602
You tell something..

843
01:31:27,871 --> 01:31:29,896
Bruno will live with us. End of discussion..

844
01:31:30,474 --> 01:31:33,009
He'll be hungry, poor one. You'll have
breakfast.

845
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:36,213
Oome on, princess. What shall we give him?

846
01:31:36,213 --> 01:31:37,441
You want milk?

847
01:31:39,683 --> 01:31:42,584
Ohics, l tell you!
- Yeah, man!

848
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:58,001
Doctors stated that R.V. couldn't race again.

849
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:00,771
But during the course of one year, R.V. fought
back with his ailment.

850
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:05,075
And today, R.V. is coming back to track to
challenge Rusty Flinton Stannes.

851
01:32:05,075 --> 01:32:07,811
ln the past one year, Rusty has maintained
the number 1 position.

852
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:13,150
Lets see whether R.V. could retain his place
or not? Of course! What's the point in asking?

853
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,685
Whether he'll be able to defeat Rusty Flinton
Stannes?

854
01:32:15,685 --> 01:32:19,416
But, expert feels that Rusty is no doubt the
number 1 racer.

855
01:32:23,994 --> 01:32:27,486
Are you sure, you are ready to go back to the
race track?

856
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:32,569
All these stupid news channel!
You called me stupid?

857
01:32:32,569 --> 01:32:34,434
What a dumb question you asked me...

858
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:42,636
Are you sure?
Of course!

859
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,505
l've been waiting for the whole one year!!

860
01:32:46,883 --> 01:32:51,621
Daddy... Ohamp 1 st & Princess 2nd...

861
01:32:51,621 --> 01:32:56,456
Oheater... cheater, he did not eat his seal.

862
01:32:57,928 --> 01:32:59,462
Princess, show me your tongue.
- Okay.

863
01:32:59,462 --> 01:33:03,592

864
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:07,637
Don't laugh. - Sorry.
Don't cheat! Very bad!

865
01:33:07,637 --> 01:33:10,841
Hey, team..
Hey, Ohampy...

01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:13,935

867
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:22,152
Oome on champ, let's go.
No, l want to learn this trick.

868
01:33:22,152 --> 01:33:24,154
Oome, l'll teach you 2 tricks
till we reach the gate..

869
01:33:24,154 --> 01:33:26,088
Okay, Harry.
- Even myself.

870
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:31,494
R.V. what's the rush?

871
01:33:32,929 --> 01:33:35,932
Okay. Honestly tell me.. You are sure?

872
01:33:35,932 --> 01:33:40,570
ls it black? No. l'm not telling a lie.

873
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:42,037
l'm sure l'll go.

874
01:33:43,773 --> 01:33:45,240
Hey Oabbie!

875
01:33:48,511 --> 01:33:49,773
Shut up! That was for me.

876
01:34:28,652 --> 01:34:30,085
Go win, cabbie!

877
01:34:44,834 --> 01:34:46,461
Doing good!... doing good!!

878
01:35:26,042 --> 01:35:27,475
How far is R.V.?

879
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:36,052
R.V. Rusty is taking a lead from right side...

880
01:35:36,052 --> 01:35:37,451
You take a lead from left side.

881
01:35:40,657 --> 01:35:42,648
l am on the left side, driving...
Go left side.. R.V.

882
01:35:53,003 --> 01:35:54,527
Okay, last lap R.V.
Go for it!

883
01:36:04,881 --> 01:36:06,483
Blocking me, Harry.
l can't get through...

884
01:36:06,483 --> 01:36:08,007
Oome on R.V.
You can overtake him!

885
01:36:18,061 --> 01:36:19,585
Try R.V. only 700 meters is left.

886
01:36:49,459 --> 01:36:50,790
What are you doing R.V.? What?

887
01:37:32,235 --> 01:37:36,706
Shona... - l'm fine!
l'm fiine!

888
01:37:36,706 --> 01:37:38,799
Hey...Shona don't worry.
l lost purposely... lf l would have won

889
01:37:43,513 --> 01:37:50,453
in the 1st race after 1 year then everybody
must have said that l've fixed the race!

890
01:37:50,453 --> 01:37:57,916
That R.V never loses!!
Now see, l'll break my record itself.

891
01:38:04,667 --> 01:38:08,104
Hey. Okay. We are home...
Hi, guys!!

892
01:38:08,104 --> 01:38:11,841
Daddy, we were racing with Bruno.
And Bruno won!

893
01:38:11,841 --> 01:38:14,811
Bruno is a cheater.
Daddy, what happen to your race?

894
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:19,649
Tell me what is it in my left hand?
Books for me. - Wrong!

895
01:38:19,649 --> 01:38:22,482
But, this is the right hand.
- Oops!

896
01:38:23,186 --> 01:38:25,814
Tell me what is there in my right hand?
My car!

897
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:28,051
Yes!

898
01:38:43,673 --> 01:38:46,437
Daddy... race?
What happen?

899
01:38:49,546 --> 01:38:53,414
Who'll play hide & seek?
Me... - l'll hide first.

900
01:39:15,171 --> 01:39:20,006
How did l do?
lt's 90 seconds below your worst timings.

901
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:24,107
Okay, time me again.
One last time!

902
01:39:47,036 --> 01:39:48,003
What a tragedy!

903
01:39:48,538 --> 01:39:53,176
Yes.
- Sir, Flinton Stannes is here to meet you.

904
01:39:53,176 --> 01:39:53,801
Send him in.

905
01:40:01,184 --> 01:40:06,022
Rocking in 2003!
l look aweful in this picture.

906
01:40:06,022 --> 01:40:10,789
No, R.V. you look smashing!
- No. l don't think so...

907
01:40:24,507 --> 01:40:34,883
Harry, is everything alright?
You are fired! - Don't kid me..

908
01:40:36,519 --> 01:40:40,056
l'm not kidding! You are terminated form the
team!!

909
01:40:40,056 --> 01:40:42,115
How could they remove me this way?

910
01:40:43,726 --> 01:40:46,462
Billy said that he gave you chance for 10
races.

911
01:40:46,462 --> 01:40:50,398
BYou should have come 2nd or 3rd but
last in every race.

912
01:40:51,868 --> 01:40:57,874
l know that l came last in 10 races but
l have come 1st in 50 races as well.

913
01:40:57,874 --> 01:41:03,012
l'll speak to Billy.
- lt's of no use.

914
01:41:03,012 --> 01:41:06,379
He'll not meet you.
Billy will not meet me??

915
01:41:10,186 --> 01:41:12,086
Sorry, R.V. Boss is in the meeting.

916
01:41:17,694 --> 01:41:20,595
Do hell with the contract.
Do hell with Speeding Saddles.

917
01:41:22,598 --> 01:41:23,900
And do hell with Billy.

918
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:28,438
Oome on, let's go get up there...
You leave, l have some work.

919
01:41:28,438 --> 01:41:32,575
What work you have here, now?
l'm the manager of this team.

920
01:41:32,575 --> 01:41:35,772
R.V. is the team!
lf l'm not there, then what team?

921
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:43,720
Billy has signed Rusty!
Rusty! You are with Rusty?

922
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:47,816
What else l could do, R.V.?
Even l have a family.

923
01:41:48,725 --> 01:41:53,662
Father has expired. l have 3 sisters.
l need to send money home...

924
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:57,522
Even l have some compulsion, buddy....

925
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:05,368
l'm sorry, R.V.
l can't leave this job!

926
01:42:06,409 --> 01:42:10,413
Where am l telling you to retire..
We'll make our own team.

927
01:42:10,413 --> 01:42:12,540
We'll get the investor in no time...

928
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:15,977
lnvestor could give you
money, not speed!

929
01:42:16,552 --> 01:42:18,755
Look, l know that my
speed is decreased a bit.

930
01:42:18,755 --> 01:42:22,658
Okay, you are there... you can solve this
problem.

931
01:42:22,658 --> 01:42:28,824
What else am l doing for the last 3 months?
Your problem could not be recuperated.

932
01:42:29,766 --> 01:42:35,898
Every sportsman go higher... higher & peaks.
And then everything...

933
01:42:37,807 --> 01:42:41,971
The one is wise who retires before anything
happens.

934
01:42:44,647 --> 01:42:48,811
Listen to me. You retire... gracefully.
Everybody will forget 1 0 races!

935
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:55,024
But, will remember Speed king!

936
01:42:55,024 --> 01:42:58,824
Hang on! Hang on! You are Speeding
Saddles manager speaking.

937
01:42:59,462 --> 01:43:03,865
You fear that l'll be back on the tracks & that
l'll defeat Rusty.

938
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:06,793
For this you are telling me to retire.

939
01:43:07,937 --> 01:43:12,931
Any team would hire me at once & then
we'll meet again at the tracks... as a rivals!

940
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:16,913
Then l'll show you, how
much speed is still left in me!

941
01:43:16,913 --> 01:43:19,108
Then l'll show you, how much speed is still left
in me!

942
01:43:27,723 --> 01:43:29,258
You are my brother, that's why l am advising
you.

943
01:43:29,258 --> 01:43:30,088
Just shut up!

944
01:44:19,675 --> 01:44:24,914
lf there is any sorrow...
You do not worry at all.

945
01:44:24,914 --> 01:44:30,079
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

946
01:44:31,554 --> 01:44:37,126
lf you have the trust, then
joy is about to come!

947
01:44:37,126 --> 01:44:43,933
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

948
01:44:43,933 --> 01:44:49,839
lf there's night, then there is morning too! lf
journey is there, then there is destination too!

949
01:44:49,839 --> 01:44:55,077
We sing smilingly in front of sorrows...

950
01:44:55,077 --> 01:45:01,812
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

951
01:45:26,809 --> 01:45:30,813
Hey, stop... stop! What you guys are doing?
Where are you taking my car?

952
01:45:30,813 --> 01:45:32,610
We came along to take back your car.

953
01:45:36,552 --> 01:45:40,556
lt's been one whole year.
We've not earn a single dollar atleast.

954
01:45:40,556 --> 01:45:44,560
Bank balance is almost zero.
All credits are cancelled..

955
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,796
We are lucky that our phone's are still
working.

956
01:45:46,796 --> 01:45:48,991
We are still getting water & electricity.

957
01:45:49,432 --> 01:45:53,035
However, even these will be of no use ahead.
- Why?

958
01:45:53,035 --> 01:45:56,527
House loans... installments for 6 months.
So, what's the big deal?

959
01:45:57,106 --> 01:45:59,597
We could sell some of our things...
We can't sell!

960
01:46:00,876 --> 01:46:04,972
Nothing is ours. All are purchased either on
loan or credit card.

961
01:46:05,615 --> 01:46:09,785
These furniture, carpet, curtains, our clothes,
your suit. Even your shoes too.

962
01:46:09,785 --> 01:46:13,122
Okay. l agree that we've taken all the things
on loan.

963
01:46:13,122 --> 01:46:17,889
But, sometimes there's delay while repaying.
So, they'll not remove us from the house?

964
01:46:19,128 --> 01:46:21,028
They can't do that?

965
01:46:23,032 --> 01:46:32,541
lf there's anything short in life or
lf there's a bit of tear in your eyes...

966
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:41,550
You keep yourself happy but never lose to the
world. Don't fear at all & don't remain allay!

967
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:51,661
Smilingly tell the whole world...
... that happy day's will surely come back

968
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:54,997
& this season will surely change!!

969
01:46:54,997 --> 01:47:01,604
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

970
01:47:01,604 --> 01:47:05,641
Yeah. We have become poor!
To become poor is a bad thing.

971
01:47:05,641 --> 01:47:07,076
Daddy, l don't want to be poor.

972
01:47:07,076 --> 01:47:09,979
lt's not a bad thing.
lt's a bit difficult but there's nothing

973
01:47:09,979 --> 01:47:12,081
wrong in being a poor.

974
01:47:12,081 --> 01:47:16,519
But, if l'm poor then l'll have to leave the
school. l'll have to leave Mrs.Peggy.

975
01:47:16,519 --> 01:47:19,579
You don't have to leave her, never

976
01:47:20,189 --> 01:47:22,591
We only need to do acting of being poor.

977
01:47:22,591 --> 01:47:26,823
lt's like a game!
Right? - Yes.

978
01:47:27,697 --> 01:47:29,665
Yeah, lt's a game! lt's a game!

979
01:47:29,665 --> 01:47:34,003
Which game? - lt's called
'Don't worry... be happy'

980
01:47:34,003 --> 01:47:36,939
What type of a game is this?
- lt's a reality game!

981
01:47:36,939 --> 01:47:38,908
For T.V.
- We'll come on T.V.

982
01:47:38,908 --> 01:47:39,809
Yes.

983
01:47:39,809 --> 01:47:43,546
What does reliaity show means?
lt's reality & not reliaity.

984
01:47:43,546 --> 01:47:48,417
There are separate teams in it.
They have to stay at some weird place.

985
01:47:48,417 --> 01:47:51,620
Say, some island, holiday towers or a jungle.

986
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:55,024
There are hidden cameras,
which shoots every team.

987
01:47:55,024 --> 01:47:58,016
Then, the best team is the winner! Simple.

988
01:47:58,661 --> 01:47:59,895
Where we have to live?

989
01:47:59,895 --> 01:48:05,601
ln a small house, just like poor people lives
in.. And we'll have only $ 2000.

990
01:48:05,601 --> 01:48:09,503
But, we'll never be sad. This way...

991
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:13,609
Someone might be watching us
from the hidden camera.

992
01:48:13,609 --> 01:48:17,613
lf anyone sees us this way...
then we are out!

993
01:48:17,613 --> 01:48:19,080
We need to remain happy... always!
This way...

994
01:48:22,118 --> 01:48:26,622
And the team which remains happy for the
most number

995
01:48:26,622 --> 01:48:28,681
of days in $ 2000, will be the winners!!

996
01:48:29,525 --> 01:48:38,100
Okay. Who'll play 'Don't worry, Be happy'
Promise me it's a game & school...

997
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,660
You'll not have to leave school. l promise!

998
01:48:42,104 --> 01:48:45,471
Show your tongue.
Black or Pink? - Pink.

999
01:48:47,877 --> 01:48:57,616
lf any storm comes, let it come...
The lamp in your heart shouldn't go off!

1000
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:05,427
Let there be black nights...
Let there be any talks...

1001
01:49:05,427 --> 01:49:10,466
We need to keep moving!
Whatever problem comes...

1002
01:49:10,466 --> 01:49:14,503
our heart shouldn't fear it!
This is what we say...

1003
01:49:14,503 --> 01:49:17,473
lf these black clouds have come across for a
few moment...

1004
01:49:17,473 --> 01:49:19,775
The sunshine never keeps on moderate!!

1005
01:49:19,775 --> 01:49:21,766
We'll soon return, Mom?

1006
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:26,081
Yes. As soon as the game is over, we'll return
to our home.

1007
01:49:26,081 --> 01:49:27,605
Home sweet home!

1008
01:49:29,451 --> 01:49:46,460
Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

1009
01:50:39,889 --> 01:50:41,624
Good Morning!
Oould you tell me where...

1010
01:50:41,624 --> 01:50:44,994
Your morning must be good.
For most of them is bad!

1011
01:50:44,994 --> 01:50:45,983
Then too they say, good!

1012
01:50:46,462 --> 01:50:49,765
First you make sure, then tell.
Okay, never mind!

1013
01:50:49,765 --> 01:50:51,567
Would you tell me where's building # 21 6?

1014
01:50:51,567 --> 01:50:55,671
Why do we tell you? - Why should we tell
you? And what we'll get, if we tell also...

1015
01:50:55,671 --> 01:50:57,673
Nothing!!

1016
01:50:57,673 --> 01:51:01,473
What else you want?
- lt's empty...

1017
01:51:01,877 --> 01:51:09,084
$ 3 for direction? We are left with $ 1 997...
Daddy, this way we'll lose!

1018
01:51:09,084 --> 01:51:12,054
Look, we lost $ 3 by saving $10.

1019
01:51:12,054 --> 01:51:13,455
Or else we could be roaming from this
building to that...

1020
01:51:13,455 --> 01:51:16,558
Even now we are roaming!
Excuse me, pull over...please.

1021
01:51:16,558 --> 01:51:19,550
Excuse me, can you tell me where's building
# 216 is?

1022
01:51:21,997 --> 01:51:24,522
Daddy, we are back here again.

1023
01:51:25,567 --> 01:51:26,556
Oheers!!

1024
01:51:26,769 --> 01:51:28,464
Bloody...
- No, R.V.

1025
01:51:32,808 --> 01:51:34,537
Bruno, come here Bruno.

1026
01:51:55,631 --> 01:51:58,400
Hey, don't worry. They're all playing the game.

1027
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,602
But, knife?
- Toy knife!.

1028
01:52:00,602 --> 01:52:04,073
They are trying to scare us. What Mama?
Yes, so that we are out!

1029
01:52:04,073 --> 01:52:09,078
But, are we stupid to get out of fear?
l'm not stupid. -Yes, you are not!

1030
01:52:09,078 --> 01:52:12,848
But, we have to be very careful! Every other
team will seek to get other team out.

1031
01:52:12,848 --> 01:52:16,511
Where are the cameras here?
- Oould be hidden anywhere.

1032
01:52:17,019 --> 01:52:22,691
Look...look, camera. l'm not crying... l'm
smiling!

1033
01:52:22,691 --> 01:52:24,056
Hey, champ!

1034
01:52:44,255 --> 01:52:51,362
Hey... welcome, welcome!
Top? Middle.

1035
01:52:51,362 --> 01:52:54,799
He means to say, whether
you stay at the top floor.

1036
01:52:54,799 --> 01:52:57,835
We are not middle class, but we stay on
middle floor.

1037
01:52:57,835 --> 01:53:01,072
Such a sweet childrens. Very nice!

1038
01:53:01,072 --> 01:53:03,575
Even ours is not that bad! He's ours.

1039
01:53:03,575 --> 01:53:06,811
You must be from lndia?
Manhatten, actually.

1040
01:53:06,811 --> 01:53:10,048
Manhatten?
- What's a big deal in it?

1041
01:53:10,048 --> 01:53:14,953
Even my brother stays at Manhatten.
Now, he is a green card holder!

1042
01:53:14,953 --> 01:53:17,889
He is permanently set now.
Manhatten...

1043
01:53:17,889 --> 01:53:18,981
But, from Manhatten... here??

1044
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:23,061
What's there to ask & what
you have to do with it?

1045
01:53:23,061 --> 01:53:25,229
May be he has lost his job.

1046
01:53:25,229 --> 01:53:27,398
He's an engineer, computer... l know.

1047
01:53:27,398 --> 01:53:30,435
Today job, tomorrow vanish! Manhatten..

1048
01:53:30,435 --> 01:53:32,170
Therefore, my business is good.

1049
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:35,974
Myself, Mr. Pandya... a cabbie.
lf you want a taxi, do tell me.

1050
01:53:35,974 --> 01:53:39,010
Direct mobile... top floor, top business.

1051
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:40,912
l think we should go somewhere else.

1052
01:53:40,912 --> 01:53:45,817
We just now printed it. lf you'll give this way
to anybody... who'll pay for it? Your father?

1053
01:53:45,817 --> 01:53:48,786
Now, come on move.
Oome, son.

1054
01:53:48,786 --> 01:53:52,950
Get side, sister...
What sort of people come here...

1055
01:54:10,541 --> 01:54:14,033
Oome on, Bruno. Oome on.
Hey, champ first!

1056
01:54:16,948 --> 01:54:19,250
Bruno, sit down...
sit down.

1057
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,480
Bruno, sit down...
sit down.

1058
01:54:43,808 --> 01:54:47,211
Where is our room?
- Over here. And yours?

1059
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:51,816
Yours, mine... everybody's.
You mean one room for 5 peoples?

1060
01:54:51,816 --> 01:54:57,255
Yes, all in one room... super fun!
Right? - Wrong!

1061
01:54:57,255 --> 01:55:01,859
Now, l could myself tie a pony too.
See, l need my room.

1062
01:55:01,859 --> 01:55:05,818
There's only one room &
everybody will share it!

1063
01:55:06,931 --> 01:55:12,460
l don't want to
- Even, l don't want to. We'll go back.

1064
01:55:14,539 --> 01:55:17,408
And reality show?
- We don't want to play.

1065
01:55:17,408 --> 01:55:18,976
Oome on, Princess.

1066
01:55:18,976 --> 01:55:20,945
But, l've told my friends,
that we'll come on T.V.

1067
01:55:20,945 --> 01:55:23,081
See, you come or not. We are going. lsn't it?

1068
01:55:23,081 --> 01:55:26,851
Fine. Ohamp & myself will play.
We'll be stars!

1069
01:55:26,851 --> 01:55:30,188
Don't come to seek our autograph.
That too, crying!

1070
01:55:30,188 --> 01:55:34,955
And the super prize we'll get.
We'll not share it either.

1071
01:55:36,194 --> 01:55:40,893
Prize? What prize?
Surprise!!

1072
01:55:41,799 --> 01:55:46,170
Oh! Who cares? l can't stay in this ware
house for any stupid prize?

1073
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:48,239
Oh! Hoity-Toity!

1074
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:50,230
Hoity-Toity!

1075
01:55:51,843 --> 01:55:58,015
Princess, are you coming?
- No. Fine! Bye!

1076
01:55:58,015 --> 01:56:00,852
Oome on daddy, it will be fun!

1077
01:56:00,852 --> 01:56:06,390
We will stay in one room.
- Promise! Promise.

1078
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:13,965
lf you don't have any fun then, l'm going back.
Right?

1079
01:56:13,965 --> 01:56:17,869
Till we don't win this game, you can't go.
Hoity-Toity!

1080
01:56:17,869 --> 01:56:19,234
Hoity-Toity?

1081
01:56:20,338 --> 01:56:24,365
Wow! Even l want to play with it.

1082
01:56:31,849 --> 01:56:36,587
Hey, Ohamp. Shall l show you one trick.
Show me the trick, not to Ohamp.

1083
01:56:36,587 --> 01:56:42,423
Let's see how fast you clean the kitchen?
And l'll attack this room.

1084
01:57:01,512 --> 01:57:07,518
Nice! They've slept...
Both got very scared, aren't they?

1085
01:57:07,518 --> 01:57:13,423
No. Both are very brave... . just like me!

1086
01:57:16,961 --> 01:57:19,395
We should have searched more for the room.

1087
01:57:20,431 --> 01:57:23,059
We should have got a room
in some better area...

1088
01:57:23,868 --> 01:57:26,336
Their daddy too was brought
up in such area itself.

1089
01:57:27,939 --> 01:57:39,180
Everyday they'll see action...
and will become tough!

1090
01:58:01,005 --> 01:58:05,776
Daddy, no water!
How could l go to school without bathing?

1091
01:58:05,776 --> 01:58:08,246
You bath everyday, Princess.
You can skip one day.

1092
01:58:08,246 --> 01:58:10,348
No bath...no bath..

1093
01:58:10,348 --> 01:58:12,516
No Mom. No bath... No school.

1094
01:58:12,516 --> 01:58:14,780
No school... No school.

1095
01:58:21,859 --> 01:58:24,562
Okay guys. Take out your swimming costume.

1096
01:58:24,562 --> 01:58:27,053
What? - Swimming costume!

1097
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:52,390
lf you wish, it would rain even
in bright sun light!

1098
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:56,093
lf it's your wish, even flowers would blossom!!

1099
01:58:56,093 --> 01:58:59,764
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...

Even you Nachle ve...
Even you Nachle ve...

1102

lf you wish, the winds will too
sing song on you!

1103
01:59:07,905 --> 01:59:12,205
lf you wish, even the stars would go across
your way!

1104
01:59:16,847 --> 01:59:19,016
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...

Even you Nachle ve...

01:59:31,162 --> 01:59:36,801
l can talk cars...
l can walk cars... ln fact, l myself am a car!

1108
01:59:36,801 --> 01:59:41,138
No degree. l'm so sorry, Ma'm.

1109
01:59:41,138 --> 01:59:43,374
Without degree, it's not possible!

1110
01:59:43,374 --> 01:59:45,968
You need to have any
degree such as M-Tech or MBA.

1111
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:05,751
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...
Even you Nachle ve...

1112
02:00:10,334 --> 02:00:18,909
You keep singing softly some song, with fun!
You keep smiling even on high & low path.

1113
02:00:18,909 --> 02:00:27,051
Sister listen, you decorate your dreams...
And then you show this dream to everybody..

1114
02:00:27,051 --> 02:00:35,426
There's nothing impossible for you, here!
Life without fun, is no life at all!

1115
02:00:35,426 --> 02:00:43,868
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...
Even you Nachle ve...

1116
02:00:43,868 --> 02:00:48,005
lf you wish, the winds will too sing song on
you!

1117
02:00:48,005 --> 02:00:52,176
lf you wish, even the stars would go across
your way!

1118
02:00:52,176 --> 02:00:56,347
The whole of the sky would bow down to you!!

1119
02:00:56,347 --> 02:01:00,443
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...

02:01:01,752 --> 02:01:05,848
Even you Nachle ve...
Nachle ve... Nachle ve... ...

1121
02:01:11,996 --> 02:01:15,900
From inside, you are still a racer.
This job doesn't suits you.

1122
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,300
Sir, l don't have any problem.
Please leave.

1123
02:01:21,539 --> 02:01:26,243
There's neither a vacancy nor a piano.
lf l keep you, then l've to buy a piano.

1124
02:01:26,243 --> 02:01:26,902
Sorry, Ma'm.

1125
02:01:54,138 --> 02:01:57,741
Why should we fear?
Whatever problem occurs...

1126
02:01:57,741 --> 02:02:02,780
For every difficulty there's always
an answer to it!

1127
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:07,818
Live your life just as this moment,
This moment of your life,

1130
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:22,900
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...

1131
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:28,005
Even you Nachle ve...

1132
02:02:28,005 --> 02:02:31,909
lf you wish, the winds will
too sing song on you!

1133
02:02:31,909 --> 02:02:35,779
lf you wish, even the stars
would go across your way!

1134
02:02:35,779 --> 02:02:39,850
The whole of the sky
would bow down to you!!

1135
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:43,554
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...

1136
02:02:43,554 --> 02:02:53,259
Even you Nachle ve...
Nachle ve... Nachle ve...

1137
02:03:42,913 --> 02:03:46,212
Go...Go...Go...

1138
02:04:00,965 --> 02:04:04,368
Hey, thanks R.V.
Thanks to you, Buddy!

1139
02:04:04,368 --> 02:04:10,207
lf for another race too...
l can't promise but, lf there's a need l will...

1140
02:04:10,207 --> 02:04:16,046
This $ 500! But, it's $ 200 for tyre changer.

1141
02:04:16,046 --> 02:04:19,383
The remaining $ 300 is yours.
You return me afterwards.

1142
02:04:19,383 --> 02:04:22,052
Remember when we both were tyre changer,

1143
02:04:22,052 --> 02:04:23,988
l needed some money and you gave me

1144
02:04:23,988 --> 02:04:25,823
l needed some money and you gave me
whatever was there in your pocket.

1145
02:04:25,823 --> 02:04:27,858
You didn't even count. - Didn't count too?
And you didn't asked for it again.

1146
02:04:27,858 --> 02:04:29,826
And l forgot it too. ldiot!

1147
02:04:30,861 --> 02:04:33,964
Many a times, l thought of returning it to you.

1148
02:04:33,964 --> 02:04:37,868
Then, l thought that you became a super star
in only one race!

1149
02:04:37,868 --> 02:04:41,463
Over here, only in one race...
Anyway. Thanks for this, buddy!

1150
02:05:29,286 --> 02:05:34,858
Where are you taking me?
Today, we'll eat lunch.

1151
02:05:34,858 --> 02:05:39,963
Oabbie, you've finally got a job!
Not a job. But...

1152
02:05:39,963 --> 02:05:43,767
Then, where did this come from?

1153
02:05:47,771 --> 02:05:51,298
You changed tyre for this?

1154
02:05:52,943 --> 02:05:56,113
Even you too in noisy birthday parties,

1155
02:05:56,113 --> 02:06:01,312
in depressing funerals, in crowded hotel
lobbies... plays piano for this only.

1156
02:06:03,253 --> 02:06:06,957
But, you are R.V.
-And you?

1157
02:06:06,957 --> 02:06:09,193
You are the greatest piano
player in this world!

1158
02:06:09,193 --> 02:06:11,428
And it is because of me, you have to play...
in search stupid places.

1159
02:06:11,428 --> 02:06:12,918
l'm sorry...

1160
02:06:14,164 --> 02:06:18,569
So, what would you like to eat?
Oake, pastry... hamburger!

1161
02:06:18,569 --> 02:06:21,171
Pizza?
- Nothing!

1162
02:06:21,171 --> 02:06:23,974
This money is going to school fee account.

1163
02:06:23,974 --> 02:06:25,943
You'll play the piano, without any food?

1164
02:06:25,943 --> 02:06:28,979
l need to accumulate $ 3000
for the school fees. l know.

1165
02:06:28,979 --> 02:06:31,148
And how much time do we have? - 30 days!

1166
02:06:31,148 --> 02:06:34,017
l remember.
- Good! Every cent counts!

1167
02:06:34,017 --> 02:06:36,887
But, listen to what l am saying.!

1168
02:06:36,887 --> 02:06:41,925
We had promised Princess & Ohamp...
Shall we break it? - Of course! Not.

1169
02:06:41,925 --> 02:06:44,428
Then, leave the lunch & let me go.

1170
02:06:44,428 --> 02:06:47,886
lf l'll take a break of more than 1 5 minutes,
they'll deduct money of 1 hour.

1171
02:06:51,902 --> 02:06:53,802
Let's go!

1172
02:07:05,182 --> 02:07:08,919
Oome on Ohamp, Princess is coming 1 st.
l don't want to come 1st.

1173
02:07:08,919 --> 02:07:11,388
lf it was a pizza, then l would have come 1 st.

1174
02:07:11,388 --> 02:07:19,963
Who is not eating the food? - Mommy!
What happen to you? How did you get hurt?

1175
02:07:19,963 --> 02:07:21,265
Actually, l...

1176
02:07:21,265 --> 02:07:27,135
When Princess was in school, she..
Princess hit Suzen left & a right...

1177
02:07:27,838 --> 02:07:29,440
Princess, you never fight!

1178
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:33,774
Why did Suzen say that there's no
reality show called 'Don't worry, be happy'?

1179
02:07:37,881 --> 02:07:40,918
ls it paining too much?
- No, it's a scrtatch!

1180
02:07:40,918 --> 02:07:44,755
Tell me, why did Suzen said so?
Tell me, Mom.

1181
02:07:44,755 --> 02:07:46,990
Okay. Ready for a race!

1182
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:51,395
Ohamp in a BMW & Princess in a FERRARl
Ahead on the starting line...

1183
02:07:51,395 --> 02:07:55,799
Who'll first cross the finishing line?

1184
02:07:55,799 --> 02:07:56,900
ls it Ohamp or Princess?

1185
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:57,768
Oh my god! lt's really close.

1186
02:07:57,768 --> 02:08:01,972
Ohamp is the champ. Ohamp wins!!
Hey, l won!

1187
02:08:01,972 --> 02:08:04,541
And the BMW wins the German...

1188
02:08:04,541 --> 02:08:10,814
Mom, aren't you eating? l'm so full. l had
taken my lunch very late, today.

1189
02:08:10,814 --> 02:08:12,149
You'll eat!

1190
02:08:12,149 --> 02:08:18,145
Daddy? - l ate later than Mom.
See, till now l'm getting the blurp..

1191
02:08:21,959 --> 02:08:24,127
R.V.
- Sorry.

1192
02:08:24,127 --> 02:08:29,032
Daddy, Do you want teacher party?
No, you eat it. l don't want.

1193
02:08:29,032 --> 02:08:33,537
Well in that case... Take it Bruno!

1194
02:08:33,537 --> 02:08:36,440
Princess, l thought you were going to eat.

1195
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:39,309
You gave it to him... to this dog!

1196
02:08:39,309 --> 02:08:42,779
Just now he ate full stomach.

1197
02:08:42,779 --> 02:08:46,283
lt wasn't full. See, how he ate it at once.

1198
02:08:46,283 --> 02:08:47,751
Even l could have done that.

1199
02:08:47,751 --> 02:08:50,720
Daddy, Don't happy, be worried!

1200
02:09:06,203 --> 02:09:08,763
He is sleeping after eating my Roti (wheat
bread)

1201
02:09:23,353 --> 02:09:24,012
Bye!!

1202
02:09:36,967 --> 02:09:40,203
Listen you, l have not brought you here to
play games.

1203
02:09:40,203 --> 02:09:42,339
This is it. Bye!

1204
02:09:42,339 --> 02:09:44,474
Good-Bye... Forever!

1205
02:09:44,474 --> 02:09:46,704
Get it! You didn't get it, do you?

1206
02:09:51,915 --> 02:09:54,818
lt's quite simple. There are 2 choices.

1207
02:09:54,818 --> 02:09:58,822
Either to send Ohamp & princess to their
desired school or to keep you with us.

1208
02:09:58,822 --> 02:10:00,791
To feed you out of our share.

1209
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:03,927
Anyways, what would you've choosed
if you were at my place?

1210
02:10:03,927 --> 02:10:05,417
You would have choosed your puppies.

1211
02:10:06,129 --> 02:10:10,033
So, even l'm choosing my childrens.

1212
02:10:10,033 --> 02:10:13,003
Look man, you are a dog.
You could manage somehow for your food!

1213
02:10:13,003 --> 02:10:17,174
Now, l'm going to my home & you go
wherever you please to.

1214
02:10:17,174 --> 02:10:21,907
Okay. Understand!
Fetch this one...

1215
02:10:25,983 --> 02:10:30,113
Bruno... Bruno..
Mom, Bruno is not in the bathroom too.

1216
02:10:31,822 --> 02:10:32,956
Daddy, get up! - What?

1217
02:10:32,956 --> 02:10:34,458
Don't know where Bruno has gone?

1218
02:10:34,458 --> 02:10:38,758
He is not in the house.
Don't cry!

1219
02:10:40,797 --> 02:10:43,333
Get up. We need to go & search Bruno.

1220
02:10:43,333 --> 02:10:45,869
Oan't we search him on Monday?
Today is Sunday!

1221
02:10:45,869 --> 02:10:46,903
R.V.

1222
02:10:46,903 --> 02:10:48,305
Daddy, Bruno...

1223
02:10:48,305 --> 02:10:50,739
Hey Ohamp, it's okay! lt's okay!
He'll be found.

1224
02:10:54,277 --> 02:10:56,905
Bruno... Bruno..

1225
02:10:57,381 --> 02:10:59,815
Bruno...

1226
02:11:02,219 --> 02:11:04,847
- Ohampy!!

1227
02:11:05,355 --> 02:11:07,891
Where did you get him?

1228
02:11:07,891 --> 02:11:09,793
Hey, he saw me & came with me.

1229
02:11:09,793 --> 02:11:11,761
l was searching your house when...
suddenly l heard his barking.

1230
02:11:12,429 --> 02:11:17,100
Hey, hey.. he is a magician!
l saw backwards & it was Rambo!

1231
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:20,203
Bruno, Uncle Harry.

1232
02:11:21,938 --> 02:11:26,307
He was jogging like a Rambo in the park...
l asked him, where is Princess?

1233
02:11:27,177 --> 02:11:31,944
Rambo told me to wait till he finishes his
jogging. After which he'll bring me here.

1234
02:11:33,216 --> 02:11:37,778
Harry... always at the right place
at the right time.

1235
02:11:38,321 --> 02:11:40,380
R.V. see who did Bruno bring him with?

1236
02:11:44,194 --> 02:11:48,932
Who'll take Bruno for a walk downtairs?
Me, Ohamp!

1237
02:11:48,932 --> 02:11:50,092
Oome, Harry.

1238
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:05,215
You've become very thin!
Are you dieting?

1239
02:12:05,215 --> 02:12:08,919
Hey, don't do it. lt's not good.

1240
02:12:08,919 --> 02:12:12,789
My 8th girl friend always used to tell that
one should remain on a very light diet.

1241
02:12:12,789 --> 02:12:15,724
The moment light goes on,
one should start eating...

1242
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:19,490
lt seems you are on the same diet.
How fat you've become!

1243
02:12:20,197 --> 02:12:23,132
Or you don't need to run after R.V.
ls it because of this reason?

1244
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:28,897
Exactly. That time due to his late arrival,
neither l got hungry nor l used to get sleep.

1245
02:12:44,554 --> 02:12:51,061
Radhika... R.V... l have brought for you...
We don't want it.

1246
02:12:51,061 --> 02:12:56,933
Let me complete...
You bought Bruno, thanks for that!

1247
02:12:56,933 --> 02:13:00,837
We don't want anything else.
Atleast listen to me... - Didn't you hear?

1248
02:13:00,837 --> 02:13:06,843
We don't need any help.
We are alright!

1249
02:13:06,843 --> 02:13:10,580
Then, why are you saying so slowly?
Okay, fine. We have problems!!

1250
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:12,207
But... - You don't want my help!

1251
02:13:13,049 --> 02:13:16,253
Very good! - Because l work with Rusty.
Mind-blowing!!

1252
02:13:16,253 --> 02:13:17,821
How come you've become so intelligent?!

1253
02:13:17,821 --> 02:13:23,157
This means l shouldn't be at your house?
Finally! l am tired of giving you hints!

1254
02:13:27,998 --> 02:13:31,001
R.V. Oome on.
Harry, please listen...

1255
02:13:31,001 --> 02:13:31,933
Let him go!

1256
02:13:32,402 --> 02:13:35,605
Saw our condition, now go & laugh.
Oh, Shut up!

1257
02:13:35,605 --> 02:13:42,807
l've brought this... my taxi license.
l didn't want to humiliate you by giving money.

1258
02:13:43,947 --> 02:13:45,312
l took great care of it.

1259
02:13:48,385 --> 02:13:51,786
Don't know when dreams are shattered &
again l've to drive a taxi.

1260
02:13:52,823 --> 02:13:57,783
My dream has not broken, yet.
How much you & Billy will try. Try it.

1261
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:15,045
He was just trying to help us.

1262
02:14:15,045 --> 02:14:20,450
Help? He was laughing at me? He was telling
me that my days of race are over!

1263
02:14:20,450 --> 02:14:22,886
And that l could drive only a taxi, now!
Help. My foot!

1264
02:14:22,886 --> 02:14:25,355
What's wrong in driving a Taxi?
lt's all wrong!

1265
02:14:25,355 --> 02:14:27,991
l'll do everything but l'll not drive a taxi.

1266
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:30,894
What do you mean by, everything?
Only 30 days are left.

1267
02:14:30,894 --> 02:14:32,162
29- days. l know.

1268
02:14:32,162 --> 02:14:32,863
Then what?

1269
02:14:32,863 --> 02:14:37,400
Whatever l get, that goes for rent, food bills,
electricity & subway tickets.

1270
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:41,104
From where will we bring school fees?
From anywhere? l'll manage.

1271
02:14:41,104 --> 02:14:44,774
Oome on, R.V. Lets be real!
Or you forget promise?

1272
02:14:44,774 --> 02:14:47,971
Should have told Princess that she
have to go in another school. - No!

1273
02:14:49,312 --> 02:14:52,315
We'll find the way.
- This is the way!

1274
02:14:52,315 --> 02:14:55,051
How diffiicult it is to get a New York license?

1275
02:14:55,051 --> 02:14:57,952
lt's not free. One has to spend thousands
of dollars to get it.

1276
02:14:59,256 --> 02:15:00,985
Why can't you drive?

1277
02:15:01,858 --> 02:15:05,862
l could go back & change tyres.
l could deliver Pizzas.

1278
02:15:05,862 --> 02:15:09,798
l could even wash utensils in a restaurant.
l could do anything, but l can't drive a taxi.

1279
02:15:11,468 --> 02:15:13,803
Because l drive only to race!

1280
02:15:13,803 --> 02:15:16,473
l couldn't beg from the
passengers holding my hands.

1281
02:15:16,473 --> 02:15:19,175
Where is the question ofjoining hands?
You'll not understand...

1282
02:15:19,175 --> 02:15:21,769
l'll not drive a taxi & that's final!

1283
02:15:45,001 --> 02:15:46,970
Hey, everybody!
No hanging around the corridor.

1284
02:15:46,970 --> 02:15:47,904
Get in the cafeteria.

1285
02:15:47,904 --> 02:15:52,042
No hanging around the corridor.
Oome this way...

1286
02:15:52,042 --> 02:15:53,843
Get in the cafeteria.

1287
02:15:53,843 --> 02:15:59,449
Princess, l need Burger, chips, slice & do-
nuts. We'll not eat lunch!

1288
02:15:59,449 --> 02:16:00,984
We'll eat...We'll eat...

1289
02:16:00,984 --> 02:16:03,885
No Ohamp, we'll not eat.
But, why?

1290
02:16:10,393 --> 02:16:12,829
Very hungry?

1291
02:16:12,829 --> 02:16:16,833
Ohamp, do you want to leave this school
& go to some other school?

1292
02:16:16,833 --> 02:16:20,837
So, Mom & Dad... could not give the school
fees.

1293
02:16:20,837 --> 02:16:24,841
We'll put this lunch money in piggy bag.
Okay?

1294
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:30,006
Then, within few days we'll have so many
dollars. And then we'll pay the school fees.

1295
02:16:31,281 --> 02:16:35,081
Only one do-nut...please.

1296
02:16:45,829 --> 02:16:49,390
What else? - No. That's all.
80 cents. Thank you.

1297
02:16:50,533 --> 02:16:56,806
9 dollars and 20 cents. Yeah!

1298
02:16:56,806 --> 02:16:59,798
lt's okay. You finish it off.

1299
02:17:00,410 --> 02:17:02,946
Now we don't need to change the school.

1300
02:17:02,946 --> 02:17:07,951
Hey, what happens after skipping one lunch.
You stupid! l'm not stupid! - Sorry.

1301
02:17:07,951 --> 02:17:09,919
You are smart. Aren't you?

1302
02:17:09,919 --> 02:17:12,822
Then don't tell Mom & Dad that
we skip our lunch!

1303
02:17:12,822 --> 02:17:14,924
They'll get upset. Didn't they?

1304
02:17:14,924 --> 02:17:17,827
This is Ohamp & Princess secret. Promise!

1305
02:17:17,827 --> 02:17:19,920
Oross my heart & hope to die!

1306
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:12,515
Avagabond plays the chord &
goes on singing...

1307
02:18:12,515 --> 02:18:17,787
Life is a thread and it gets entangle further... .

1308
02:18:17,787 --> 02:18:23,993
Sorrows are never sought out easily,
Heart is such that even then it tries to

1309
02:18:23,993 --> 02:18:28,231
resolve things around...

1310
02:18:28,231 --> 02:18:32,469
The duty of the traveler is
to move & move ahead...

1311
02:18:32,469 --> 02:18:41,138
Saiyaan Ve...Saaiyaan Ve...
Listen... Saaiyaan Ve...

1312
02:19:05,001 --> 02:19:10,340
A bird collects bit by bit...
And this way build their nest.

1313
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:15,778
Even you collect morsel
to build your home too...

1314
02:19:20,416 --> 02:19:25,955
Drop by drop converts into a sea...
Thread by thread becomes a blanket...

1315
02:19:25,955 --> 02:19:31,060
Even you too embellish your dreams!!

1316
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:36,399
The one who yield the garden, is sure to get
flowers...

1317
02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:41,871
The duty of the traveler is to move & move
ahead...

1318
02:19:41,871 --> 02:19:50,142
Saiyaan Ve...Saaiyaan Ve...
Listen... Saaiyaan Ve...

1319
02:20:00,924 --> 02:20:07,897
The days are difficult as the mountains...
Even the nights are diminishing as well.

1320
02:20:07,897 --> 02:20:11,958
You seem to think, how this path will get
easier...

1321
02:20:16,339 --> 02:20:21,844
All the ways are strange, in which your eyes
search me.

1322
02:20:21,844 --> 02:20:28,184
Such a moment comes & get obligated
You seem to wander every nook & corner...

1323
02:20:28,184 --> 02:20:32,555
Making your heart understand...

1324
02:20:32,555 --> 02:20:37,427
The duty of the traveler is to move & move
ahead...

1325
02:20:37,427 --> 02:20:45,857
Saiyaan Ve...Saaiyaan Ve...
Listen... Saaiyaan Ve...

1326
02:22:00,877 --> 02:22:03,903
Radhika, come & sit in the car.

1327
02:22:05,815 --> 02:22:08,017
Radhika... l'll drop you at your house.

1328
02:22:08,017 --> 02:22:10,349
My house is too far for you.se.

1329
02:22:11,788 --> 02:22:13,915
Oome on. Don't give me excuses, now.

1330
02:22:14,490 --> 02:22:16,253
What do you mean by NOW?

1331
02:22:30,139 --> 02:22:34,977
Now you have already married him.
And today you are in financial crisis.

1332
02:22:34,977 --> 02:22:36,376
Then, why this hesitation.

1333
02:22:38,348 --> 02:22:43,186
You could have called me up.
l would have sent the tickets for you.

1334
02:22:43,186 --> 02:22:46,389
You along with your children
could have come to me.

1335
02:22:46,389 --> 02:22:48,357
And of course, that racer too!!

1336
02:22:49,926 --> 02:22:53,020
l would have made some phone calls.
He could easily get a job!

1337
02:22:54,197 --> 02:22:59,001
l told you that this man couldn't think of
tomorrow...

1338
02:22:59,001 --> 02:23:00,837
lf he would have thought...

1339
02:23:00,837 --> 02:23:03,965
Anyways. There's no point in repenting now!

1340
02:23:04,374 --> 02:23:09,979
Hey, what are you doing this?
lt is $ 50,000 cheque!

1341
02:23:09,979 --> 02:23:11,241
So, how's work?

1342
02:23:12,482 --> 02:23:18,011
Recently, l read that you've overtaken a new
company. Oongrats!

1343
02:23:18,955 --> 02:23:23,824
Now, your company has grown 4th largest
data base consultant.

1344
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:26,824
And is it the 3rd largets?

1345
02:23:27,363 --> 02:23:31,197
Now, what wrong did l do?
- Nothing.

1346
02:23:32,201 --> 02:23:34,303
Nor you... or anyone.

1347
02:23:34,303 --> 02:23:36,005
Should l write another cheque?

1348
02:23:36,005 --> 02:23:38,064
Let me help you? - l don't need help!
Everything is fine!

1349
02:23:38,841 --> 02:23:43,813
Oh yeah, Everything is fine and you are
traveling in a bus.

1350
02:23:43,813 --> 02:23:47,183
What condition that racer has made of yours!

1351
02:23:47,183 --> 02:23:50,953
Rajveer Singh. Please take his name with
respect Mr. Banerjee.

1352
02:23:50,953 --> 02:23:52,054
He is my husband.

1353
02:23:52,054 --> 02:23:58,961
Best husband, best father, best racer... He
could very well take of myself & my childrens.

1354
02:23:58,961 --> 02:24:02,863
We don't want anybody's help.
Thank you.

1355
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:12,974
You tore the cheque! Why?

1356
02:24:13,443 --> 02:24:18,548
Mr. Banerjee wanted to prove that
l've married a useless, irresponsible man!

1357
02:24:18,548 --> 02:24:21,951
By giving $ 50,000... he was about to buy
the right of your insult!

1358
02:24:21,951 --> 02:24:24,954
So, what?
You should have allowed him to insult me!

1359
02:24:24,954 --> 02:24:27,824
He would have insulted me.
l have no problem!

1360
02:24:27,824 --> 02:24:30,816
He should give the cheques this way &
l'll get myself insulted again & again.

1361
02:24:31,294 --> 02:24:34,997
For every $ 50,000... he could
insult me for 2 hours.

1362
02:24:34,997 --> 02:24:37,900
And after giving 4 cheques, one week insult
time free!

1363
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:41,495
You get insulted, you don't feel bad for it.
But, l cannot tolerate my husband's insult.

1364
02:24:42,205 --> 02:24:48,110
Listen, it's for them.
You could have tolerated a little.

1365
02:24:50,213 --> 02:24:57,186
l've told my father that you are there to take
care of us! We don't want anybody's help.

1366
02:24:57,186 --> 02:25:04,092
Did l say the right thing?
Yes. l'm there.

1367
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:28,440
Taxi...

1368
02:25:32,822 --> 02:25:35,391

1369
02:25:35,391 --> 02:25:39,428
l'm sorry, Ma'm. l'm a cab driver & this is the
road, not a race-track!

1370
02:25:39,428 --> 02:25:41,898
l'll pay you $ 300.
- lt's impossible!

1371
02:25:41,898 --> 02:25:46,130
$ 500 - What?
$ 600 - Last offer!

1372
02:27:36,946 --> 02:27:41,183
l missed my flight.
lf you've bought me here on time,

1373
02:27:41,183 --> 02:27:42,885
you could have got full $ 600

1374
02:27:42,885 --> 02:27:46,844
You know what, l'm giving you $ 50 just for
caring so much!

1375
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:24,360
lt's $ 5 & 25 cents.

1376
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:26,862
Even the quarters are yours. Okay!

1377
02:28:26,862 --> 02:28:28,022
What will l do with this, Pandey?

1378
02:28:29,799 --> 02:28:32,835
Hey, Ohottu. Oome here.

1379
02:28:32,835 --> 02:28:35,871
Not now. l don't want to listen to any of your
joke. l'm feeling sleepy!

1380
02:28:35,871 --> 02:28:37,031
lt's notjoke, in fact a serious matter!

1381
02:28:39,108 --> 02:28:42,111
What happen?
Our R.V.'s daughter is in the hospital.

1382
02:28:42,111 --> 02:28:45,081
What happen R.V. brother?
She got wet in the rains, yesterday night.

1383
02:28:45,081 --> 02:28:47,483
And she got pneumonia.

1384
02:28:47,483 --> 02:28:52,121
Hey, pneumonia could affect the lungs too.
We need your help & not diagnosis.

1385
02:28:52,121 --> 02:28:53,179
Give the money.

1386
02:28:53,789 --> 02:28:58,427
Binny, Khan, Suleman, everybody come here.

02:28:58,427 --> 02:29:03,099
What's this? $ 5...
Hey, he seeks help not alms!

Add $ 15 more.

1389
02:29:05,835 --> 02:29:10,397
Suddenly, rain started & she caught hold of
pneumonia. Everything will be fiine!

1390
02:29:18,147 --> 02:29:20,249
After discharge, get her to my house.

1391
02:29:20,249 --> 02:29:21,784
She'll play with my daughter.

1392
02:29:21,784 --> 02:29:23,919
Hey, chill dude.
lf you have this money, give back to us.

1393
02:29:23,919 --> 02:29:25,944
lf not, then double chill!

1394
02:29:31,527 --> 02:29:33,757
Now, you don't need to leave your school,
Princess.

1395
02:29:47,309 --> 02:29:49,334
Happy birthday, Ohamp!!

1396
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:20,309
Okay, now listen up.
We're going to tell you a story.

1397
02:30:20,309 --> 02:30:25,804
Story about 4 guys!
Ta, Ra, Ma & Pa...

1398
02:30:32,822 --> 02:30:49,405
lf Ta falls... Ra gives him support.
Ma understands signs of Pa, quickly.

1399
02:30:49,405 --> 02:30:58,113
lf this Ta... Ra & Ma.. Pa get together then...
Everybody could hear this melody...

1400
02:30:58,113 --> 02:31:14,485
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

1401
02:31:38,888 --> 02:31:54,403
Ta.. one day smilingly say to Ra..
That you too know that Pa loves Ma?

1402
02:31:54,403 --> 02:31:59,141
lf this Ta...Ra & this Ma.. Pa get
together then...

1403
02:31:59,141 --> 02:32:03,078
They could teach the whole world to love...

1404
02:32:03,078 --> 02:32:18,915
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

1405
02:32:47,856 --> 02:33:03,405
Ta is always curious to know the whereabouts
of Ra. Ma also goes only there where, Pa is.

1406
02:33:03,405 --> 02:33:09,411
lf this Ta...Ra & this Ma.. Pa get together
then...

1407
02:33:09,411 --> 02:33:12,481
lf everybody together says that whatever

1408
02:33:12,481 --> 02:33:35,259
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...
Ta Ra Ra Rum Pum...

1409
02:34:14,143 --> 02:34:17,408
Hey R.V. How's your daughter now?
Fine!

1410
02:34:18,847 --> 02:34:23,585
Whose daughter is fine? - His.
Then, why did he ask you?

1411
02:34:23,585 --> 02:34:26,822
Hey, who knows?
You know these taxi drivers...

1412
02:34:26,822 --> 02:34:29,858
These poor guys drives taxi for the
whole day & at night...

1413
02:34:29,858 --> 02:34:36,298
Hey, R.V. they have discharged very early.
Very good! Now, let her take some rest.

1414
02:34:36,298 --> 02:34:40,962
Make her eat fruits & if you want any help,
Do call me. Okay! Good night.

1415
02:34:49,011 --> 02:34:52,214
How intelligent the parents are...

1416
02:34:52,214 --> 02:34:55,050
The girl is been just now discharged,

1417
02:34:55,050 --> 02:34:57,920
Neither they have made her wear
a sweater nor any cap.

1418
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,521
Now, they'll blame the doctor for not giving
proper medicine.

1419
02:34:59,521 --> 02:35:01,123
Again, she caught pneumonia.

1420
02:35:01,123 --> 02:35:02,818
Oome on Shona, don't pay attention
to their talks...

1421
02:35:06,462 --> 02:35:09,331
Shona...Don't Shona me.

1422
02:35:09,331 --> 02:35:12,167
l'll return their money.
ln fact, l was about to...

1423
02:35:12,167 --> 02:35:16,238
We have only $ 1 000 only.
$ 1 000! Now after all this also...

1424
02:35:16,238 --> 02:35:20,342
They have given this amount on their own.
l've not put a gun & forced them to give!

1425
02:35:20,342 --> 02:35:24,413
You'll do even that. The person who could lie
of his own daughter...

1426
02:35:24,413 --> 02:35:25,881
Oould do anything.

1427
02:35:25,881 --> 02:35:26,982
You can even murder anybody. - Murder!

1428
02:35:26,982 --> 02:35:30,975
Me, have you ever seen me killing a
cockroach?

1429
02:35:31,954 --> 02:35:37,392
You know for whom did l lie.
Fine. l'll tell all of them the truth.?

1430
02:35:37,392 --> 02:35:40,796
After that we need not have to lie anymore.
Atleast not for the sake of them.

1431
02:35:40,796 --> 02:35:42,161
Radhika, don't. They'll awake.

1432
02:35:43,499 --> 02:35:46,535
Princess, now listen carefully.
Reality show... a lie.

1433
02:35:46,535 --> 02:35:49,171
Hidden Oamera... a lie.
No game is there.

1434
02:35:49,171 --> 02:35:51,807
We are poor.
Really very very poor!

1435
02:35:51,807 --> 02:35:53,976
Stay out of this!
Forget Mrs. Peggy,

1436
02:35:53,976 --> 02:35:57,012
Forget your school,
You'll not go to that school from tomorrow!

1437
02:35:57,012 --> 02:36:00,048
Otherwise, your daddy will lie, steal.!

1438
02:36:00,048 --> 02:36:02,551
And if he isn't satisfied with this much
then he'll murder too.

1439
02:36:02,551 --> 02:36:06,112
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!

1440
02:36:08,957 --> 02:36:13,529
Pa was right!
He has said that l'll repent...

1441
02:36:13,529 --> 02:36:19,835
R.V. you are small man just as your name.
Wake up, Ohamp.

1442
02:36:19,835 --> 02:36:23,972
Don't you want to listen, from where did
Daddy bring money for your birthday party?

1443
02:36:23,972 --> 02:36:25,599
He cheated simple & honest people.
He stole their money.

1444
02:36:26,808 --> 02:36:29,444
Ohamp!! Mummy...Mummy.
Ohamp.

1445
02:36:29,444 --> 02:36:32,208
Ohamp. Get up!

1446
02:36:38,187 --> 02:36:40,956
What did you eat in your lunch?
Nothing.

1447
02:36:40,956 --> 02:36:42,324
What do you mean by nothing?

1448
02:36:42,324 --> 02:36:48,030
Sweet heart, the first thing Doctor
would ask is what did Ohamp eat?

1449
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:50,098
Please try to remember..

1450
02:36:50,098 --> 02:36:52,501
We both did not have our lunch. - Why?

1451
02:36:52,501 --> 02:36:55,771
We had to collect money ton pay our fees!
For what?

1452
02:36:55,771 --> 02:36:59,798
We were aware that we are poor,
right from the beginning.

1453
02:37:02,911 --> 02:37:05,314
Therefore, we started saving our lunch
money.

1454
02:37:05,314 --> 02:37:07,916
The idea of not eating lunch was min

1455
02:37:07,916 --> 02:37:10,009
Please don't scold Ohamp.

1456
02:37:12,821 --> 02:37:15,224
lt's my fault!
- No. Princess.

1457
02:37:15,224 --> 02:37:17,826
lt isn't your fault.
lt isn't anybody fault!

1458
02:37:17,826 --> 02:37:20,028
Don't worry everything would be fine!

1459
02:37:20,028 --> 02:37:22,360
Hurry up! Please.

1460
02:37:35,978 --> 02:37:38,139
Radhika, you've come.

1461
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:42,417
l need to talk.
How's Ohamp? He's fiine.

1462
02:37:42,417 --> 02:37:44,385
You want to go inside & hold his hand?

1463
02:37:55,230 --> 02:37:57,299
$ 65,000!!?

1464
02:37:57,299 --> 02:38:00,962
$ 65,000... from where we'll bring this much
money?

1465
02:38:01,937 --> 02:38:09,344
What's there? You do have
lnsurance, don't you? No.

1466
02:38:09,344 --> 02:38:13,041
Today is maximum.
We want table holding as long it matters.

1467
02:38:35,203 --> 02:38:38,140
We can't depend on the
wins of the racer, do we?

1468
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:40,008
lt's been on my mind for sometime.

1469
02:38:40,008 --> 02:38:41,908
Getting into sports...

1470
02:38:42,511 --> 02:38:44,376
Brand Billy.
- That's right!

1471
02:38:50,786 --> 02:38:56,088
Hey, let him come in.
R.V. What happen?

1472
02:39:00,395 --> 02:39:02,364
R.V... . R.V... R.V...

1473
02:39:02,364 --> 02:39:04,800
Where have you vanished old boy?
Where were you all these days?

1474
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:06,131
Oome...Oome...Oome. Join us.

1475
02:39:06,768 --> 02:39:08,793
You badly need a drink.
- No.

1476
02:39:09,905 --> 02:39:15,043
l need money! - Money!
Everybody needs money!

1477
02:39:15,043 --> 02:39:18,843
But, you have it.
That too in plenty!

1478
02:39:19,414 --> 02:39:22,918
And l have nothing!
What do l have?

1479
02:39:22,918 --> 02:39:24,386
How do you say that?

1480
02:39:24,386 --> 02:39:27,856
By flowing blood & sweat, one could manage
food for twice a day. That's all!

1481
02:39:27,856 --> 02:39:33,228
My son is in the hospital.
He has eaten something in the school.

1482
02:39:33,228 --> 02:39:37,232
Don't know how, a piece of
glass enter his belly?

1483
02:39:37,232 --> 02:39:41,100
He is critical!
- How much do you need R.V

1484
02:39:41,970 --> 02:39:46,964
How much money do you need?
$ 65,000!

1485
02:39:50,479 --> 02:39:52,948
That's a lots of money, R.V.

1486
02:39:52,948 --> 02:39:58,019
l don't have that much money but,
l could contribute $ 1 00.

1487
02:39:58,019 --> 02:40:01,890
l could do better than that... $ 200.

1488
02:40:01,890 --> 02:40:03,016
Okay. Take it!

1489
02:40:03,925 --> 02:40:07,763
l need $ 65,000, Billy!
Rusty calls me Mr. Bhatia.

1490
02:40:07,763 --> 02:40:09,162
Rusty can go...

1491
02:40:14,903 --> 02:40:22,778
Mr. Bhatia, l'm asking you for a loan!
And l'm ready to do anything for it.

1492
02:40:22,778 --> 02:40:29,411
Washing, cleaning, servicing...
l'll become your slave!

1493
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:33,410
Please...please...

1494
02:40:34,956 --> 02:40:39,394
l don't know what more l could do R.V.?
Okay, l'll make it $ 300.

1495
02:40:39,394 --> 02:40:41,294
lt's impossible anything more than this.

1496
02:40:41,963 --> 02:40:46,468
Tell me one thing, most of them are known by
you. Why don't you ask them?

1497
02:40:46,468 --> 02:40:49,504
Everybody will contribute little by little &
you'll be in business.

1498
02:40:49,504 --> 02:40:50,372
Let me do it for you.

1499
02:40:50,372 --> 02:40:56,902
Hey guys, our friend R.V. needs some cash
for his son's operation!

1500
02:40:57,212 --> 02:41:01,783
So, can you all contribute?
Please pitch in & help him out. Thank you.

1501
02:41:01,783 --> 02:41:04,286
Well, l have given the opening speech too.

1502
02:41:04,286 --> 02:41:07,778
Now, go to each of them and...
- Beg!

1503
02:41:12,828 --> 02:41:19,901
This suit, this cigar and this $ 50 drink...
Oould be snatched in a moment, Billy.

1504
02:41:19,901 --> 02:41:22,927
Just the way, it happened to me!

1505
02:41:25,841 --> 02:41:33,407
Take care of this Billy. Don't know when
you've to come to me... to Beg!

1506
02:41:33,949 --> 02:41:35,974
Now, we'll meet at the race track!

1507
02:41:36,852 --> 02:41:38,843
And who will win... You?

1508
02:41:40,055 --> 02:41:42,791
To win, one needs courage!

1509
02:41:42,791 --> 02:41:44,190
That's right Billy.

1510
02:41:45,293 --> 02:41:48,063
When l started losing, l lost courage as well.

1511
02:41:48,063 --> 02:41:54,903
When l lost courage, l did cheat... the ones
who helped me.

1512
02:41:54,903 --> 02:41:57,770
And today, l came to beg.

1513
02:41:58,773 --> 02:42:00,742
lf you wouldn't have insulted me.

1514
02:42:00,742 --> 02:42:03,233
l wouldn't have come to know that
how much l've fallen...

1515
02:42:05,814 --> 02:42:09,272
My wife, my children consider me as their
hero!

1516
02:42:10,151 --> 02:42:13,780
They consider me as Best husband,
best father & best racer.

1517
02:42:15,090 --> 02:42:18,150
And today, for them l'll become & show that
l'm the best!

1518
02:42:25,767 --> 02:42:27,758
R.V... .
Don't waste time, Harry!

1519
02:42:28,036 --> 02:42:29,833
R.V.'s chapter is over!

1520
02:42:32,007 --> 02:42:35,875
ln fact, my dignity was over under your
money & my compulsion.

1521
02:42:37,512 --> 02:42:40,815
lf l'll not go now, l'll be fiinished!.

1522
02:42:40,815 --> 02:42:43,518
Go & don't ever come back to Speeding
Saddles again.

1523
02:42:43,518 --> 02:42:46,112
Hey, your Speeding Saddles...

1524
02:42:48,123 --> 02:42:49,357
Now you see,

1525
02:42:49,357 --> 02:42:53,191
How we will tear Speeding Saddles
that you'll not be able to even stitch it!

1526
02:42:59,801 --> 02:43:04,539
R.V... . R.V... Listen.

1527
02:43:04,539 --> 02:43:07,275
l don't have the time to listen to your
nonsense lecture.

1528
02:43:07,275 --> 02:43:09,175
Now, listen to me, please.

1529
02:43:10,946 --> 02:43:12,847
l'm not father of Ohamp.

1530
02:43:12,847 --> 02:43:16,084
But, when he was born l took him into
my arms before you.

1531
02:43:16,084 --> 02:43:17,381
You were at the race!

1532
02:43:19,854 --> 02:43:22,914
l don't have plenty of money with me.

1533
02:43:23,258 --> 02:43:25,994
But, l have $1 0000 which is only required
to register in the race!

1534
02:43:25,994 --> 02:43:28,292
But, l have $1 0000 which is only required
to register in the race!

1535
02:43:28,997 --> 02:43:31,199
You only said that we'll make our own team.

1536
02:43:31,199 --> 02:43:35,192
Then come, let's show Speeding Saddles
it's actual place.

1537
02:43:53,321 --> 02:43:54,913
Today, we'll both win!

1538
02:43:56,324 --> 02:43:59,987
You & me, both Ohamps!!

1539
02:44:05,967 --> 02:44:09,237
Team has been registered.
We've got entry in the race.

1540
02:44:09,237 --> 02:44:11,973
Ohevorlet has even given us the car!

1541
02:44:11,973 --> 02:44:14,965
All set! -And pit crew?

1542
02:44:20,382 --> 02:44:23,977
lyer, Jaggu, Khan Saheb...

1543
02:44:27,856 --> 02:44:33,852
Please forgive me.
l'm really sorry!

1544
02:44:34,295 --> 02:44:38,299
Ohill dude, don't say anything.
We know that you did a wrong thing.

1545
02:44:38,299 --> 02:44:41,436
But, why did you do it, we even know that.
So, double chill!

1546
02:44:41,436 --> 02:44:45,206
And myself, Pandya.
l am your team manager!

1547
02:44:45,206 --> 02:44:48,309
Now you don't think about
anything except the race!

1548
02:44:48,309 --> 02:44:51,379
And the rest recovery, we'll manage.

1549
02:44:51,379 --> 02:44:55,417
lt's New York cabbies.
Never leave changes!!

1550
02:44:55,417 --> 02:44:56,785
This is it!

1551
02:44:56,785 --> 02:45:00,055
Now see, how we play band of
SpeedingSaddles?

1552
02:45:00,055 --> 02:45:02,489
lt's not band, we'll play
the whole orchestra.

1553
02:45:04,526 --> 02:45:05,254
Raise your head.

1554
02:45:08,930 --> 02:45:10,795
When l am not near you?.

1555
02:45:12,834 --> 02:45:19,865
You deliver Pizza, drive a taxi, go racing...

1556
02:45:21,810 --> 02:45:27,874
What if today l'll not stand on the stand &

1557
02:45:29,284 --> 02:45:33,345
This time we have no other option
left than to win!

1558
02:45:34,589 --> 02:45:41,757
Tell me that you'll win?

02:45:42,964 --> 02:45:47,333

My husband has come on the T.V., O my god!
Mom, see Papa...

1568
02:48:31,833 --> 02:48:35,496
lf l'll see Papa... will he come out of the T.V.
to feed you??

1569
02:48:36,871 --> 02:48:42,810
Will lose or win? Of course, we will win!

1570
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:45,870
All are here to bid for winner.
ls there nobody to whom l can bet with.

Hey, you sit inside.

02:50:59,747 --> 02:51:02,083
Let it be! We'll see him later.

l'm far from R.V.

1582
02:53:07,875 --> 02:53:08,864
Go...Go...Go.

1583
02:53:33,501 --> 02:53:34,968
Damn it!

1584
02:54:17,578 --> 02:54:20,172
R.V. he is purposely giving you the space.
You don't go from there.

1585
02:54:22,383 --> 02:54:24,977
What are you doing, R.V.?
Don't go from there...

1586
02:55:00,021 --> 02:55:01,386
R.V. don't spare him!

1587
02:56:55,136 --> 02:57:00,374
The duty of the traveler is to move & move
ahead...

Saiyaan Ve...Saaiyaan Ve...
Listen... Saaiyaan Ve...

1589
02:57:08,783 --> 02:57:13,948
Saiyaan Ve...Saaiyaan Ve...
Listen... Saaiyaan Ve...

1590
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:50,891
Black comes down and Daddy comes first.
Rusty goes bust!

1591
02:57:50,891 --> 02:57:52,051
Do you want to see my scar?

1592
02:58:01,202 --> 02:58:06,106
Papa, now regularly races.
Mom, has fiinally completed her degree.

1593
02:58:06,106 --> 02:58:10,978
Now, every week we go for Mom's concert
& one day for the race!

1594
02:58:10,978 --> 02:58:14,315
Myself & Ohamp are no more skipping the
lunch.

1595
02:58:14,315 --> 02:58:16,851
And we didn't even have to change the
school.

1596
02:58:16,851 --> 02:58:19,420
But, l don't know why Mom & Dad, still say to
us that we are poor!

1597
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:21,989
l don't mind!
Now, l am used to save.

1598
02:58:21,989 --> 02:58:24,558
We no more live at Oaddle idle now.

1599
02:58:24,558 --> 02:58:27,127
But, we go every weekend to meet
our friends there.

1600
02:58:27,127 --> 02:58:29,430
Sometimes, they come to our places.

1601
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:33,093
Our house... the same one
'Home sweet Home'

1602
02:58:40,908 --> 02:58:43,468
How did you get it?
Where did you searched it?

1603
02:58:46,881 --> 02:58:52,319
Hey, Shona. l promise. Henceforth, l'll never
spend money without thinking.

1604
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:57,491
Because nobody has seen tomorrow. And
who knows whether tomorrow comes or not.

1605
02:58:57,491 --> 02:58:59,959
l'll change all the things to today.

1606
02:59:02,162 --> 02:59:04,932
lt was really a bad line..

1607
02:59:04,932 --> 02:59:05,830
Forget that... ..

1608
02:59:06,133 --> 02:59:08,903
No more loans... No more installments.

1609
02:59:08,903 --> 02:59:12,172
And yes, l'll never lie
anybody for the sake of money.

1610
02:59:12,172 --> 02:59:18,338
And l'll not spoil our children but,
l'll spoil you

1611
02:59:19,313 --> 02:59:22,316
What lie did you tell me?

1612
02:59:22,316 --> 02:59:22,805
When l asked money from you on the behest
of servicing.
