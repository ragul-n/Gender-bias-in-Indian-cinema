1
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,650
No, Vikram... Vikram.

2
00:01:56,175 --> 00:01:58,968
No...no...get up!

3
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,860
You cannot die like this.

4
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,340
Get up.

5
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,820
You cannot die like this.

6
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:08,020
Get up already.

7
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,710
- You cannot die like this.
- Ronnie.

8
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,020
Vikram... Vikram.

9
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,420
Vikram!

10
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,280
Got it! Yes! Yes!

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,520
Vikram, how dare
you cut my kite string?

12
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,600
What do you mean?

13
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,720
I'll show you what I mean.

14
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,680
- Beat him.
- What did I do?

15
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,280
Let him go!

16
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,098
My kite, huh? How dare you cut my kite?

17
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,600
Beat him Bali!

18
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,030
- You hit me?
- Yes.

19
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,830
I'll call my brother.

20
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,270
Go call him.

21
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,988
Ronnie!

22
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,670
Look, he called his little brother...

23
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:19,990
Couldn't you find
someone bigger than him?

24
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:22,654
Vikram, where did you
find this little guy?

25
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:23,910
Is he going to fight Bali?

26
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,630
Get lost.

27
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:27,390
When it's about me, I keep calm.

28
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,230
When it's about my brother,
I cause harm.

29
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,430
Father!

30
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,590
No, father, please...

31
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,910
- You're always getting into fights.
- No, father, please...

32
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,310
- No, father, please...
- Wear the uniform then!

33
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,990
- Wear it!
- It won't happen again...

34
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,870
- Wear the police uniform!
- It won't happen again...

35
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,020
Father, no!

36
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,100
Always causing trouble!

37
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,490
Sorry, Ronnie.

38
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,890
Father beat you a lot, didn't he?

39
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,970
No, brother.
He wasn't beating me.

40
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:23,650
He was just dusting
the dirt off my clothes.

41
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:24,970
Don't worry.

42
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,690
Come on, sir,
why torture the little one so much?

43
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,050
What you call torture
is actually just his warm-up.

44
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:34,290
He's still a kid.

45
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,020
But if I don't set him straight now
he might take a wrong step tomorrow.

46
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,890
That's true.

47
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,824
But it's the older
one who started the fight.

48
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,440
So he deserves to be punished as well.

49
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,690
I am not crazy.

50
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,020
If I even touch the older one...

51
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,210
...the little one will
shoot me with my gun.

52
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,930
Yes, that is possible.

53
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,810
Lets go.

54
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,450
Vikram, Chaturvedi hit me.

55
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,010
So why are you sobbing?

56
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,850
I could have hit him
back if I wanted to..

57
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,934
But it's not appropriate
to hit your father.

58
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,930
Here, eat.

59
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,850
- Eat.
- Children.

60
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:15,530
Uncle, you?

61
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,850
I've come to take you home.

62
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,730
Why didn't father come?

63
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,010
Father didn't come...

64
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,210
...but all his brothers
in uniform are here.

65
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,095
A fight between two gangs
in Sadar Bazaar turned into a riot.

66
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:38,047
Sir arrived on the spot
unarmed without any backup force...

67
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,570
...and protected all the innocent
families stuck in the middle.

68
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,690
Rioters have no religion,
conscience or morality.

69
00:05:46,123 --> 00:05:49,290
But a man in uniform
has only one oath.

70
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,290
Protecting the Citizens.

71
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,210
Between his duty and his life,
he chose his duty.

72
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,410
And while paying his
debt to the uniform...

73
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,690
...he kept fighting.

74
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,570
Those cowards shot him in the back.

75
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,850
But even though he was wounded...

76
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,017
...he didn't let a single-family
come in harm's way.

77
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:25,444
Sir has fulfilled his duty...

78
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,570
...by shedding his blood.

79
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,170
Father.

80
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:35,530
Son...

81
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,770
- Father.
- Come here son.

82
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:44,850
Ronnie...

83
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:01,830
This is probably the first time when
a father is asking his younger son...

84
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,130
...to look after the older one

85
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:08,415
Never leave his side.

86
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,090
He needs you.

87
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,610
I don't have much time.

88
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:18,690
And don't cry.

89
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,101
Don't cry son.

90
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,330
Promise your father.

91
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,496
Promise your father
that you'll look after him.

92
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,301
Promise Chaturvedi!

93
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,410
I...

94
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,490
promise!

95
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,450
Father!

96
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,360
How is that fair?

97
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,651
I'll get us something to eat.

98
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,251
Here, hold this.

99
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:14,971
How is that fair?

100
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,651
Connect...Come on...
Connect already!

101
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:33,618
Come on. Come on. Come on.

102
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,371
Got it!

103
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,851
Excuse me, madam.

104
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,131
Do you even know where you are?

105
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,211
This is a gent's toilet.

106
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,531
I mean, aren't you embarrassed?

107
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,331
You should be embarrassed, you...

108
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,851
Standing like this in front of a girl.

109
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,851
What do you mean like this?

110
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,011
But this is a gent's toilet, madam.

111
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,851
So when did I say this is
a lady's dance bar, you...

112
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,651
Little Ol' me came
here searching for network.

113
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:11,021
And you lot...are blaming me!

114
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,610
But sister, we're being polite...

115
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,621
You all just don't know
how to speak to a lady.

116
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,611
Look at the language you idiots use.

117
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:19,051
Idiots?

118
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:20,771
Our language?

119
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,091
You were in the gent's toilet?

120
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,891
Network.
I guess all the towers are in there.

121
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,291
What?

122
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,411
Let's go finish your boring film.

123
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:34,581
I am starving.

124
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,691
I am going to have a feast.

125
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:36,491
Yes ma'am.

126
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,811
One cheese nachos and a popcorn.

127
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:39,211
And, a cold water.

128
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,171
Okay ma'am.

129
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:46,811
Thank you.

130
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,171
What happened?

131
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:48,941
All okay?

132
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:49,941
Don't know.

133
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:52,941
That I will find
out after the interval.

134
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,191
The thing is, in these renditions
I get a little handy.

135
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,221
- What?
- I mean...

136
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,661
...in such conditions,
I get a little cranky.

137
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:03,621
- Thank you.
- Excuse me...

138
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,501
Wait. Wait. Wait.

139
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:08,591
There's no point in getting
so sentimental, friend.

140
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,981
Films are miles away from reality.

141
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,551
Hold on to this, I'll explain.

142
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,421
For example, the hero's entry.

143
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,581
I mean when he enters,...

144
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,791
why does he come in slow motion.

145
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,180
And one guy beats up a
dozen guys single-handedly.

146
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,221
Does any of it even make sense?

147
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,501
What have you done?

148
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:29,900
I'll clean it.

149
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,951
Boss, he's saying
he'll clean you out..

150
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,391
What did you just say?

151
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,151
No, I mean I'll wipe it.

152
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,421
No, he's saying he'll wipe you out.

153
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,300
How dare you?

154
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:42,980
I mean I'll wipe it,
then clean it and hang it out to dry.

155
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,351
This is too much, now he's
saying he'll hang you.

156
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,941
Aye, you c grade film's
low grade dubbing artist..

157
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:51,231
You're making this simple scene over
dramatic with your wrong translation.

158
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,631
I'll show you "dramatic".

159
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,141
Me? You'll wipe me out?

160
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,585
Ronnie!

161
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:26,941
That's Ronnie.

162
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,461
Rony (Cry baby).

163
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,341
Tell him who I am.

164
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:34,701
This man here is called Rocky Insane.

165
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:39,551
The thing about people is, they
keep saying something or the other.

166
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,551
Don't take them too seriously.

167
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,751
I am the 'bad bro' of this area.

168
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,671
Mind-blowing.

169
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,791
I see...

170
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,471
So where are all your sisters?

171
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:50,991
What did you say?

172
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:51,951
What did you just say?

173
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:53,551
What the...?

174
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:54,871
So what happened here?

175
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:58,591
I accidentally spilled food on him.

176
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,413
Now listen, we're sorry for this.

177
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:06,991
We'll get out of your way.

178
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:08,391
Lets go. Come on.

179
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,391
Come on lets go.

180
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:11,871
He's a complete mess.

181
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,151
The tray wasn't mine. What could I
have done if the girl just handed it over.

182
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,801
Forget them,
but you should be more careful.

183
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:16,751
My focus was on the tray.

184
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:17,511
By then...

185
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:23,311
What happened?

186
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,171
What are you doing?

187
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:28,801
What...

188
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,611
Blood?

189
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,251
It's okay. It happens.

190
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,331
Leave it. Let's go.

191
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:43,211
Did someone hit you?

192
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,611
Forget it Ronnie.
Let's go.

193
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,051
Vikram, who hit you?

194
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:50,301
'Why are you hitting me?'

195
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,211
'Here's another one.'

196
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:55,331
- You'll hang me?
- 'You cannot hit him like this.'

197
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,371
Forget it.

198
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,571
Let's go home.

199
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:03,211
Come on.

200
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,971
When it's about me, I keep calm.

201
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,571
But if it's about my brother,
I cause harm.

202
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,451
You shouldn't have hit my brother.

203
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:51,461
Ronnie...Ronnie...Ronnie...Ronnie.
No, no, no Ronnie.

204
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:54,131
Don't do it. Don't do it Ronnie.

205
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:55,948
Ronnie, stop. Stop it.

206
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,731
Let him go.

207
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,211
Let him go.

208
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,491
Okay...

209
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:05,037
- No no no. Let him go.
- Ronnie. Ronnie! Let him go!

210
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,861
You shouldn't have hit my brother!

211
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,131
Ronnie. Ronnie.

212
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:09,771
It's okay.

213
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,121
- Calm down.
- I'm fine.

214
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:12,871
That macho destroyed everyone.

215
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:15,871
Ronnie.

216
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,751
Ronnie.

217
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:17,951
Ronnie.

218
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:18,871
Ronnie.

219
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,791
I love you, Ronnie.

220
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,591
He is such a handsome fellow.

221
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,350
Ronnie.

222
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,591
Enough!

223
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,991
These people
have made a hero out of him.

224
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:30,591
How long are you going
to keep beating up people?

225
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,057
Already old enough to get married.

226
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,641
Then get married.
Who is stopping you?

227
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,151
Hey, you quit messing around with me

228
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:36,751
Listen...

229
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,921
I've put in a good word for you
in Agra's Lohamandi Police Station.

230
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:43,561
They have a post vacant.

231
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,441
Underlining the fact that your father and
grandfather served in the Police Force.

232
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:48,682
Okay fine, uncle.

233
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:50,271
Hey, Ronnie.
You know what.

234
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,352
You take up this job as a Policeman.

235
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:52,911
I can't get this job.

236
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:54,161
Why?

237
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,401
I've 32 cases registered against me.

238
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:57,161
What?

239
00:17:57,881 --> 00:17:58,724
32 cases.

240
00:17:58,843 --> 00:17:59,331
Yes.

241
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,761
Why do you keep getting in fights?

242
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,001
These 32 cases are
because I saved you.

243
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:07,266
Not 32, but 33.

244
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,401
Add the one from yesterday.

245
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:11,161
You take this job.

246
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:12,201
Me?

247
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:14,711
How will I look selling forms?

248
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:17,161
I mean how will I look in a uniform?

249
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:22,052
Brother,
you know how scared I am of criminals.

250
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,611
Once you put on this uniform...

251
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:27,411
...the same criminals
will be scared of you.

252
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:28,451
I see.

253
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:31,331
Look at him. He's been
wearing this uniform for so long.

254
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,851
But what's his achievement in life?

255
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:35,891
Why do all your
conversations end up on me?

256
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:38,771
You know what, fill up his form.
Vikram will do this job.

257
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:39,691
Me?

258
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,171
Think about it...

259
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:42,771
He who puts on the uniform...

260
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:45,291
...always stays in form.

261
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,171
He who wears the Police outfit,
turns criminals to dust.

262
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,891
He who carries the
stars on his shoulder...

263
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,211
...is the real superstar.

264
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:06,411
Inspector Vikram Charan Chaturvedi

265
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,171
Just watch...

266
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,891
The People of Agra are
going to look up to you.

267
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:19,211
Sorry, sir.

268
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,531
I will break your legs, understand.

269
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,931
Do you think I'll just let you go?

270
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,131
What did you say?

271
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:29,451
Sorry, lets go.

272
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,571
You escaped today otherwise...

273
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:36,371
Ronnie, there's one thing.

274
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:37,531
What?

275
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,051
There's something about this uniform.

276
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:49,451
Chaturvedi always fed you this.

277
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:04,931
Now go and enjoy.

278
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:22,491
Jai Hind Sir.

279
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,811
Vikram Charan Chaturvedi
reporting for duty, sir.

280
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:50,951
Welcome, Mr. Chaturvedi.

281
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:53,768
I am S. Kute.

282
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:54,951
Kutte?

283
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:59,591
Two-Star Inspector Sharad Kute.

284
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:01,551
Ku...Te.

285
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:02,791
Ku...Te.

286
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:03,791
- Understand?
- Yes sir.

287
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:06,391
Go meet Mr. Tripathi.

288
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,351
The one who is supposed to carry
the flag, can't even carry his baton.

289
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:04,983
Yes IPL sir..

290
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:06,903
You? Here?

291
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:12,183
You did the right thing
by coming here, Bajwa.

292
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,583
After all, this is our home ground.

293
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,183
Where is Mr. Tripathi?

294
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,303
- Tripathi.
- Yes.

295
00:22:18,863 --> 00:22:20,623
Rumours are that you
enjoy writing reports.

296
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,023
Now write what I tell you...

297
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:26,623
This man's wife was playing a
T-20 match with some guy.

298
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:31,623
And he watched the entire
Game like a Third Umpire.

299
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,143
What a great idea sir!

300
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,023
I have a riddle for you all.

301
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:42,743
A thing that people buy,
but not for themselves.

302
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:48,263
And the one who its meant
for doesn't buy it for himself.

303
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:05,183
Coffin.

304
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:09,223
Sorry, sir.

305
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:14,383
Next time be careful.

306
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:16,103
Let's go.

307
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:28,153
Sir...

308
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:29,353
Sir...

309
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,968
They burnt a man alive
in front of the police.

310
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:34,953
And no one did anything.

311
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:36,633
Do you see Mr. Tripathi?

312
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:41,273
He had once just considered
taking action against these people.

313
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,273
Do you know what they did?

314
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:53,633
Munni!

315
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:57,393
Munni!

316
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:14,883
Ronnie...being a cop himself,
Tripathi could never prove...

317
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,858
...that his daughter never had
an accident but was actually murdered.

318
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:19,712
That guy Bajwa and IPL.

319
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,233
Do you know how dangerous they are?

320
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,460
And they are involved
in many illegal businesses.

321
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,633
The biggest of them is kidnapping.

322
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:29,403
They kidnap an entire family...

323
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,043
...and don't even ask for ransom.

324
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,613
Then what do they do with them?

325
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:33,723
How would I know?

326
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:37,373
What do they do with
them or where they take them.

327
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:40,493
In fact, the cops don't
even know who is backing them up.

328
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:41,708
Okay forget that, give me a hand.

329
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:42,643
Here.

330
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:44,403
Not here, here.

331
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:47,557
If you can't lift it yourself
then why do you do it?

332
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,738
- What did you say?
- Come on, Ronnie, come on.

333
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,722
- Boss, the delivery has arrived.
- Yes.

334
00:24:58,224 --> 00:24:59,672
Remove all the tags from the shirts.

335
00:25:20,112 --> 00:25:21,752
Abu Jalal wants to meet me.

336
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:25,752
We'll have to send them at least
another 20 to 25 more families.

337
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,131
But boss, right now
that is difficult to do in Agra.

338
00:25:29,282 --> 00:25:30,136
Bajwa!

339
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,278
Pathankot, Kerala.

340
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:33,452
Assam, Bihar...

341
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,532
And in Agra too,
if you keep your eyes open...

342
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:36,602
...you'll find what
you're looking for.

343
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:37,282
Understand?

344
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,282
Yes.

345
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,052
Boss, you never told me...

346
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:50,027
...what Abu Jalal Gaza
does with these families.

347
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:30,243
Abu Jalal Gaza.

348
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,708
The most dangerous man on Earth.

349
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,330
Leader of the terrorist orgsanisation,
Jaish-e-Lashkar.

350
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,172
Countries from around the world...

351
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:43,852
...have invested millions in
Abu Jalal's terrorist organization.

352
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:46,372
And his job is...

353
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:48,172
...to spread terrorism.

354
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:49,972
To conduct suicide bombings.

355
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:52,052
Don't hurt my child.

356
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:54,052
Let us go...

357
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,932
Don't hurt my child...

358
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,363
Let us go.

359
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:00,932
Ssshhhh...Sssshhh.

360
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:04,732
Let us go...

361
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,302
No...No... Please No...

362
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:28,812
No...No...

363
00:27:32,654 --> 00:27:33,812
I'll die.

364
00:27:34,332 --> 00:27:35,012
I'll die.

365
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,412
I'll kill myself.

366
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:37,732
I'll kill myself.

367
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:40,102
- No.
- Please don't harm my child.

368
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:41,629
Please don't harm my child.

369
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:42,493
I'll die.

370
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,202
Let us go.

371
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,532
No!
Let us go...

372
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:08,652
Don't hurt us!

373
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:16,052
Stop! Please!

374
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,692
He's a fine example of
a sharp mind and limitless power.

375
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,492
Abu Jalal Gaza.

376
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:43,692
He often says, if a person
dies alone its of complete waste.

377
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:49,092
But if they die along with a hundred,
then that's accepted.

378
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:02,459
This is the 11th proposal you
rejected. What's wrong with you Ruchi?

379
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:04,452
He was a confectioner.

380
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:06,252
Imagine your brother-in-law,
a confectioner.

381
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,502
Hey, you stupid little...

382
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:09,532
Idiot...

383
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:11,261
- Stop yelling.
- He was driving rash.

384
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,932
Okay, fine.
The Academy is right here. Stop.

385
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:14,812
That's it.

386
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:19,612
Take care, okay.

387
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,132
Go carefully and come home soon.

388
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:21,852
Yes.

389
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:22,652
Okay, bye.

390
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:24,732
- Hello?
- Hello Hafeeza..

391
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:25,652
- Siya.
- Hey, listen up..

392
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:28,212
Hafeeza...this network!

393
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:30,612
Here at Lohamandi Police Station,
they are not taking my complaint.

394
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,612
- Yes Hafeeza, you wait right there. I'm coming.
- Hello?

395
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:34,612
Can you hear me?

396
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:36,012
Damn! Just wait right there.

397
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,612
I'm so... I'm so sorry"

398
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,012
Are you blind?
Couldn't you see such a big bike?

399
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,542
I was looking at that girl...
I'm really sorry.

400
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:56,412
Looking at the girl.
That's the problem with boys nowadays.

401
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:57,212
While looking at girls...

402
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,212
- I'm really sorry. I'll pick it up.
- Don't touch it.

403
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,692
Let go. Let go of it right now.

404
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:06,892
You let my bike go.

405
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:08,292
You said let go.

406
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,292
I know boys like you really well.

407
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:11,714
Who do you think you are?

408
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:12,892
Could you not see such a big bike?

409
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,322
My scooter's yellow, not black.

410
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:16,772
But listen...

411
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:18,222
You don't know who I am.

412
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:19,509
But everyone in Agra knows who I am...

413
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:21,302
...and they also know my yellow bike.

414
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:22,972
Why are you looking around?
Can't you hear my voice?

415
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:25,271
How can I hear when two people
are talking at the same time?

416
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:25,772
Two...

417
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,620
You...
Did you just compare me...

418
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:30,732
Does he know...

419
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:33,172
Where did he go? Where did he go?

420
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,241
We'll run into each other somewhere.

421
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:40,432
And I'll teach you a lesson then...

422
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,352
...or my name isn't Ruchi.

423
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:50,752
What kind of a joke is this, madam?
What are you doing?

424
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,722
Someone told me outside that
if you want the cops to do anything...

425
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,552
...then you must warm
up their pocket so I did it.

426
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:57,032
- What is your complain?
- As I said,...

427
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,072
...while passing
through Pritampura, I clearly saw..

428
00:30:59,352 --> 00:31:01,282
...that some people were taking
families as hostages inside a factory.

429
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,123
But Madam, we don't have any
report of a kidnapping in our area.

430
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,231
But the area where
they are being held hostage...

431
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:07,961
...comes under your area,
doesn't it? You...

432
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,232
- Look
- What? Madam...

433
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:11,512
I am having this strong urge...

434
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:12,632
What for?

435
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:15,192
This strong urge
of wanting to abuse you?

436
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:17,882
But right now, not an abuse
but instead my phone will come out.

437
00:31:17,912 --> 00:31:18,632
Madam...

438
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:20,191
What, what exactly are you doing?

439
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,392
I am going to put you on social media.

440
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:25,802
I have 265,000 followers.
The video will go viral in minutes.

441
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:27,232
Are you going to write
the complaint or not?

442
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:29,682
- Bosco...
- Yes Sir.

443
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:32,682
...the factory where they are
being held hostage belongs to IPL.

444
00:31:32,712 --> 00:31:33,512
Yes Sir.

445
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:36,312
Who will volunteer to put their
life at stake and raid IPL's place?

446
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,192
Who will be the scapegoat?

447
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:40,712
Sir, there's our scapegoat.

448
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,192
That's a real goat.

449
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,192
Sir, in front of the goat...

450
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:05,172
Mr. Chaturvedi.

451
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,250
Come in...Welcome.

452
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,792
The time has come to show
the real power of this uniform.

453
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,322
And to repay
your debt to the country.

454
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:15,372
But sir, I didn't take
a loan from the country.

455
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,042
But you must pay it back.

456
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:17,922
How?

457
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,870
All you need to do
is raid IPL's factory.

458
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,205
And save those innocent hostages.

459
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,002
- But Sir...
- Many names were suggested...

460
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:26,972
...but I told the Commissioner...

461
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:28,482
...you're the man for the job.

462
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:30,162
You will go.

463
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:31,109
I will go?

464
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,762
See... he's saying that he will go.

465
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,282
A big round of applause for him.

466
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:38,662
Ok...

467
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:41,752
But before that,
I'll just go late a teak.

468
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:42,782
What?

469
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:46,632
I mean take a leak.

470
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:50,032
You're a cop,
they won't send you to deliver food.

471
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:51,182
Why don't you understand?

472
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:52,262
But if...

473
00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:55,462
If I go, then I'll
let the bag out of the cat.

474
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:55,902
What?

475
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:59,382
- I mean, the cat out of the bag
- Your secret will be safe.

476
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:02,782
I am there with you...always.

477
00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:03,702
What do you mean?

478
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:05,902
Now go and say that you will go...

479
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:08,102
and that too, alone.

480
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:09,102
Alone?

481
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,262
Alone?

482
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:11,062
Alone?

483
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,342
Alone?

484
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,062
Yes, alone!

485
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:07,552
Ronnie.
There's no one here.

486
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:08,902
So stop trying to scare me.

487
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:16,782
Want to play hide and seek?

488
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,222
Okay.

489
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:19,102
Come on.

490
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:25,822
How is this a place to sleep?

491
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,822
They've left the platform
and are now sleeping on the tracks!

492
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:28,702
Now listen carefully...

493
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,302
When I whistle, turn the lights off.

494
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,902
When I whistle again,
turn the lights back on.

495
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,422
Okay...

496
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:35,382
Not yet.

497
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:37,022
I am just holding on to it.

498
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:38,982
What if you get caught?

499
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:53,862
A police baton?

500
00:34:58,722 --> 00:34:59,782
He must be around here.

501
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:01,182
Find him.

502
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:06,182
Who is it?

503
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,182
Hey, who is it?

504
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:25,422
He must be here somewhere!
Go find him!

505
00:36:03,672 --> 00:36:04,872
We won't let him get away!

506
00:36:04,952 --> 00:36:05,992
I get it now.

507
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:09,322
He whistles to turn the lights off...

508
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:11,632
...and whistles again
to turn it back on.

509
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,632
I see...then whistle.

510
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:14,912
Okay.

511
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:31,752
If you're here, then who is whistling?

512
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,712
Unfortunately,
the exam papers have leaked out.

513
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:34,912
So what now?

514
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:36,912
Lights full off.

515
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:39,432
Action full on.

516
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,832
45 seconds. Game over.

517
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,792
Mom, it's the Police.

518
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:25,712
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much!

519
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,232
No, please don't do that.

520
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:01,522
Where is he?

521
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:02,802
Where is he?

522
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:04,202
Where is he?

523
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:06,802
There is he.

524
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:08,922
Sir!

525
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,242
There is he.

526
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,207
Standing.

527
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:21,042
Breathing.

528
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,322
Hold the google.

529
00:39:32,294 --> 00:39:34,042
Bhokelal Mupe Chatora

530
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:35,002
Sir?

531
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:36,322
My name.

532
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:38,602
Commissioner BMC.

533
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:39,642
Sir.

534
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,642
But what's in a name?

535
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:44,479
It's you who has made us proud.

536
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:45,802
Yes, you...

537
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:50,562
Cops and Cops, he's the Dabangg
(Fearless) of this Police Station...

538
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,982
Singham, Simmba...

539
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:58,102
...and in a couple of weeks,...
he'll be Sooryavanshi as well.

540
00:39:58,502 --> 00:39:59,902
And...

541
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:04,232
...he can even be the
next Bhokelal Mupe Chatora.

542
00:40:04,262 --> 00:40:06,702
No, sir. It suits you better.

543
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,702
I know, I know...

544
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:10,382
Don't teach me.

545
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:12,382
Wait a minute.

546
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:14,702
Looking at your posture...

547
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:18,662
...It seems as if
you didn't do this job...

548
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:20,862
But it was someone else.

549
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,662
Cops and Cops...

550
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:26,502
...you should learn from him.

551
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,542
Not even an ounce of pride.

552
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,022
Like me.

553
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,236
Bravo.

554
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:37,032
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

555
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,080
Bravo.

556
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,142
- Photographer.
- Yes Sir!

557
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:40,992
I always keep a personal
photographer with me.

558
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,342
Click please...
with kiss.

559
00:40:45,314 --> 00:40:45,862
Sir...

560
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,662
Al-Habibi Abu Jalal, Kabuliwala...

561
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:04,222
Coffeewala?

562
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:05,560
Kulfiwala.

563
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:09,142
- Oh...
- Kifala.

564
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:12,902
- Kifala.
- Yes, Kafela. Kafela.

565
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:17,043
You will do a big job for us.

566
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:20,582
Oh, so You know Hindi.

567
00:41:21,508 --> 00:41:24,582
Yes, you sweat and I speak Hindi

568
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:27,822
Yes...
I'll do the work. I'll do it for you.

569
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:41,982
Hello.

570
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:43,502
Those families we abducted...

571
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:45,706
...some cop called Vikram...

572
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,222
...raided our place and freed them.

573
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:48,902
Bajwa, you...

574
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,752
You can't do a single job.

575
00:41:50,782 --> 00:41:52,302
What happened?
Any bad news?

576
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:55,462
Ah, wife calls, bad news always.

577
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:56,632
Good news.

578
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:58,405
Fearless Hero of Agra.

579
00:41:58,592 --> 00:41:58,912
Great.

580
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:00,697
Top cop.

581
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:02,665
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

582
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,992
But how are you still safe?

583
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:08,912
What?

584
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:09,992
Shut up Asif.

585
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:13,282
He means how are you still single?
And not married.

586
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:15,414
That's what I keep
telling him all the time.

587
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:18,282
You did the right thing
by bringing up this topic.

588
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:20,632
And if he doesn't do it now,
then when else?

589
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:23,002
Uncle, if you can't
control yourself anymore...

590
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:24,430
...then why don't you get married?

591
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,392
Why do you have to
make everything about me?

592
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,655
Brother Vikram, Asif and
I had an arranged marriage as well.

593
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:34,126
I have a friend and she's very sweet.
If you could just meet her.

594
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:36,042
Maybe you two will get along...

595
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:37,162
Hafeeza,

596
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:39,842
I am fine as I am.

597
00:42:40,527 --> 00:42:41,842
See you later, uncle.

598
00:42:41,986 --> 00:42:43,292
Where are you going again?

599
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:44,642
Ronnie, talk to him.

600
00:42:45,014 --> 00:42:47,892
Ronnie, now you must convince Vikram.

601
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:48,922
Come on, get up!

602
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:55,122
Its decided, you're getting married.

603
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:57,122
Are you trying to scare me?

604
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,242
Look...Chaturvedi would've
wanted the same thing.

605
00:43:01,642 --> 00:43:03,042
Father would've asked me politely...

606
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,002
...and not scared me.

607
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,602
If father was still here,
you would've said 'yes' right?

608
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:23,882
Now listen to your brother.

609
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:29,002
Okay.

610
00:43:30,762 --> 00:43:33,452
But...you must go and choose my bride.

611
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:35,067
Please, do I have to do everything?

612
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:38,732
No...I'll handle the
wedding and honeymoon.

613
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:41,043
You just find me a bride.

614
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:43,951
Cheers.

615
00:43:49,498 --> 00:43:54,061
"You're not ready yet,
but I am all decked up."

616
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:55,891
What's wrong with you, Siya?
Are you out of your mind?

617
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:57,521
- Why are you wearing sunglasses?
- But that was looking so cool.

618
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,650
Listen lady...

619
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:01,461
Siya please! What are you doing, Siya?

620
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:02,221
Look,

621
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:05,741
Hafeeza says that the guy is
Smart, dashing and handsome.

622
00:44:06,181 --> 00:44:06,621
So?

623
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:08,981
I'll check and report back to you.

624
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:10,181
Siya...

625
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:11,021
She is here.

626
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:12,871
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

627
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:13,981
- But don't be mischievous.
- Okay?

628
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:15,781
- Promise? Hi-five...
- Ok brother.

629
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,581
- Hello.
- Thank you.

630
00:44:24,301 --> 00:44:24,883
You?

631
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,101
You?

632
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,181
- Did you say something?
- Huh...

633
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:47,581
Do you...

634
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:49,781
Do you have something to say?

635
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:52,141
No.

636
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:55,541
I mean yes.

637
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:56,861
What?

638
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:58,141
I mean...

639
00:44:59,942 --> 00:45:00,741
I do.

640
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:02,381
Say something.

641
00:45:04,062 --> 00:45:04,941
There's still time.

642
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:08,310
- Should I?
- Yes, please do.

643
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:09,981
What a mess!

644
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:12,724
I imagined something else
but now look at what's happened.

645
00:45:12,754 --> 00:45:14,981
You and I both have turned
out to be such idiots.

646
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,660
In situations like this the
best of people would get flustered.

647
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,111
And here we're stuck
in such a big pickle

648
00:45:20,141 --> 00:45:23,261
Now should I smack your head
into this situation to fix it?

649
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:28,361
You didn't say anything.

650
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:31,761
What's the point?

651
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:34,401
Why?

652
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:36,921
It will get censored.

653
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:38,321
So...

654
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:40,201
What's the matter?

655
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:41,441
So you guys have spoken, it seems.

656
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:42,321
That's great.

657
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,241
So the two siblings
can fix a date for the wedding.

658
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:47,721
Siblings?

659
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:50,001
Yeah...

660
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:53,601
Groom's brother, bride's sister.
Speak to each other and fix a date.

661
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:56,411
- Bride's sister...
- Groom's brother.

662
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:57,601
Bride's sister...

663
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:58,641
Groom's brother.

664
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:00,201
Bride's sister...

665
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,290
- Groom's brother.
- Bride's sister...

666
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,001
Groom's brother.
Bride's sister.

667
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:08,011
Groom's brother.
Bride's sister.

668
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,241
Brother, sister.
Brother, sister.

669
00:46:09,401 --> 00:46:10,550
Brother, sister.
Brother, sister.

670
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:15,091
You two look extremely happy.

671
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:16,001
That's her...

672
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:18,081
Hello...

673
00:46:24,627 --> 00:46:26,131
- I am so... I'm so sorry.
- Are you blind?

674
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:27,401
- Did you not see such a big scooter?
- I was looking at that girl.

675
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:28,281
I'm really sorry.

676
00:46:28,361 --> 00:46:28,961
You?

677
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:30,161
You?

678
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:37,676
Hafeeza was saying that she
is a very simple and sweet girl.

679
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:39,761
She humiliated you twice.

680
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:43,561
The other day on the street. And
now she threw you out of her house.

681
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:46,331
His brother must be on
his way to see someone else.

682
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,131
He only rammed into your scooter...

683
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:49,761
...but you just rammed your...

684
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,001
Fate.

685
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:52,961
Now keep watering
the plants and chill!

686
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:54,681
You insulted the poor guy.

687
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:56,371
His brother must be furious.

688
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:58,451
No need to go back
in that house again.

689
00:46:58,628 --> 00:46:59,961
- This relationship is completely...
- Right.

690
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,091
Yes... No.
What are you saying?

691
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:04,121
Look bro,
you are naive and she's feisty.

692
00:47:04,453 --> 00:47:05,241
It's a perfect match.

693
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:06,616
Rot... I mean what?

694
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,161
I mean one needs the
hardware to run the software.

695
00:47:09,448 --> 00:47:09,921
So?

696
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:11,521
So you're the software,
she's the hardware.

697
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:12,721
Huh?

698
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:14,841
You're soft, and she's equally...

699
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:15,761
Fierce!

700
00:47:16,246 --> 00:47:19,161
You lost this good proposal
because of your hot-headedness.

701
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:21,581
I wonder when you'll get
a proposal like this again?

702
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:25,211
It's here.
Hafeeza called.

703
00:47:25,611 --> 00:47:29,211
Vikram is ready to marry Ruchi.

704
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:31,011
Grandma!

705
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:33,691
Grandma!

706
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:57,651
Hey...!

707
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,486
Sorry...

708
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:11,371
I'm fine...

709
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:32,090
' Vikram Charan Chaturvedi is now
known as the "top cop" of the city. '

710
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:33,671
' It is almost as if...'

711
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:35,101
Bajwa. Riddle.

712
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:38,221
What's the one thing that
you wear but can also get hit by?

713
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:40,421
What is it?

714
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:41,261
Shoes.

715
00:50:42,421 --> 00:50:43,621
What can I do, boss?

716
00:50:43,852 --> 00:50:46,061
He's raiding all our dens...

717
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:47,711
...and takes out fifty
of our men all at once..

718
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:50,111
He must have a weakness,
every human being does.

719
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:53,461
What about his family?
Parents, wife, kids...anyone?

720
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:55,991
Boss, he has a younger brother.

721
00:50:56,021 --> 00:50:57,621
His name is Sony, Mony or something...

722
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:59,341
He's a little naive kid, isn't he?

723
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:01,661
Sony, Kony, Mony.
Bring him to me now.

724
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,261
- Go!
- Go now!

725
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:09,421
That's his brother, Sony.

726
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:10,941
Or Mony. Whatever.

727
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:12,221
He looks innocent.

728
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:18,541
- Let's get him.
- Come on.

729
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:35,621
Excuse me...

730
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:38,181
Sorry sorry...excuse me...

731
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:40,981
He's signaling us to stop.

732
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,021
He's hurt.
There's a vet clinic in the next lane.

733
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:47,021
Can you give me a lift, please?

734
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,501
Hop in.

735
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:49,581
Thanks...

736
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:52,981
Seems to be an emotional kid.

737
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:55,421
- Let's do our job.
- Such admiration towards a puppy?

738
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,381
Boss, this pup got in
our car with a puppy dog.

739
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:03,951
Great. Bring him in.

740
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:04,781
Yes, boss.

741
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:10,241
Take a left.

742
00:52:10,565 --> 00:52:11,481
I said take a left.

743
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:15,041
Hey kid, calm down...

744
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:17,281
...or we'll cut you down to strands.

745
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:18,561
Where are the families, Rocky?

746
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:19,440
But brother...

747
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,451
I told you to get
families from Ghaziabad.

748
00:52:21,481 --> 00:52:23,281
From today you'll be on silent mode.

749
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,041
Finger on your lips.
Finger on your lips.

750
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:52,041
Sir, please tell me why
you have brought me here?

751
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:54,721
So Sony, Mony or whatever...
What's your name?

752
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:56,441
- Ron...
- Hey...

753
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:04,401
So you're the little, naive, brother.

754
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:06,401
He can't even grow a beard yet.

755
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:09,401
Look, none of this is your fault...

756
00:53:09,601 --> 00:53:11,241
...but you'll get beaten
up today for no reason.

757
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,801
This is Inspector
Vikram Charan Chaturvedi.

758
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,321
And this is IPL...

759
00:53:22,441 --> 00:53:23,241
Listen...

760
00:53:25,721 --> 00:53:27,321
Attitude.

761
00:53:28,556 --> 00:53:29,241
He hung up...

762
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:31,841
Take out your phone.

763
00:53:38,961 --> 00:53:39,651
Ronnie...

764
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:42,081
Listen up,
IPL speaking, don't hang up.

765
00:53:42,161 --> 00:53:42,681
Wait.

766
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:45,761
And put it on speaker.

767
00:53:46,664 --> 00:53:47,281
Why?

768
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,361
I want the entire Police
Station to hear this..

769
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:53,281
Now listen carefully...

770
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:56,451
Your so-called Supercop
freed my hostages...

771
00:53:56,481 --> 00:53:59,011
...and I kidnapped his
innocent little brother.

772
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,670
Either you return the families...

773
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:07,281
...or get down to Pritampura
backyard to play supercop yet again.

774
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:10,361
Otherwise, your brother
won't get to see another day.

775
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:11,851
Now hang up.

776
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:17,411
Calling from Ronnie's phone...

777
00:54:18,971 --> 00:54:21,371
...kidnapped my little,
innocent, brother.

778
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:24,011
Who did they kidnap?

779
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:27,291
Please don't hit me.
I am very scared.

780
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:29,211
No Sir...please...

781
00:54:29,714 --> 00:54:32,691
Sir, you're my senior but I am older.

782
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:36,411
In my 35-years of service...

783
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,920
...I lost my daughter because of them.

784
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:43,971
Before I retire from this job...

785
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:46,891
...I will definitely
take two things with me.

786
00:54:47,571 --> 00:54:48,971
A small medal...

787
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:51,371
...and a huge burden.

788
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,091
Please go, sir.

789
00:54:57,922 --> 00:54:59,771
Your brother needs you.

790
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:06,051
- Sir, give me the phone. I want to try.
- Yes, yes. Go ahead.

791
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:12,731
Hello.

792
00:55:13,662 --> 00:55:14,651
Hello, brother.

793
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,251
Yeah Ronnie!

794
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:17,731
I am very scared.

795
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,731
Please come soon.

796
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:22,931
These are very dangerous people.

797
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:25,781
You know what...
Come down in 15...

798
00:55:26,224 --> 00:55:27,341
I mean 10 minutes.

799
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:28,486
Please, I am very scared.

800
00:55:28,516 --> 00:55:29,046
Okay.

801
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,731
I get it.

802
00:55:34,421 --> 00:55:35,621
Sir, he's coming.

803
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:38,101
Naive but smart.

804
00:55:44,104 --> 00:55:44,911
Bajwa...

805
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,712
If his brother doesn't
show up in 15 minutes...

806
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:47,261
Yes...

807
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,061
...then send him his severed thumb.

808
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,761
I'll dislike it...

809
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:52,761
- Where are you going?
- ...but he will like it.

810
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:53,651
Please don't leave me.

811
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:56,161
My brother's coming.
Please...

812
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:57,481
- Be quiet!
- Let go!

813
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:59,641
- Who will wait for 15 minutes?
- Don't hit me!

814
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:01,761
- Bring him here!
- What are you going to do with me?

815
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,841
- No please, let me go!
- Bring him here!

816
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:07,281
- Hold him properly.
- Please!

817
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,961
Hey, where are you taking him?

818
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:14,041
- Bring him back. Bring him here.
- No, please please!

819
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:16,241
My brother is coming! Please trust me!

820
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:18,361
Please forgive me!

821
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,441
No, no brother...

822
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:24,481
Please, please brother!

823
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,721
MUMMY!

824
00:56:33,377 --> 00:56:35,771
I've been trying to tell them since
long that they got the wrong guy.

825
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:38,121
Now I've lost my thumb because
of their "finger on the lips"

826
00:56:40,923 --> 00:56:42,121
Now I like it!

827
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:50,273
The older one is bad enough.
The young one's a tough nut too.

828
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,861
IPL sir said he didn't
even hit puberty yet.

829
00:57:14,251 --> 00:57:15,401
But he's destroying us.

830
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:19,761
It's not here.

831
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,481
He's throwing the guys like a ball.

832
00:57:46,954 --> 00:57:47,801
Hey Insane...

833
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:49,961
Thumb?

834
00:57:51,797 --> 00:57:52,601
It's there.

835
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:54,361
Thank you.

836
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:55,921
Mention not.

837
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,691
Not here either.

838
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:10,541
Why me, boss?

839
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:11,590
Boss...boss...boss!

840
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:26,219
What is he doing?

841
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,476
What did their father eat
before giving birth to them?

842
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:19,571
Come here, little one.

843
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:21,771
Are you ok?

844
00:59:22,412 --> 00:59:22,931
Shall we go?

845
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:26,331
Get up you animal!

846
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:27,691
Let's go.

847
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:47,520
- Tripathi.
- Yes Sir...

848
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,518
Shall we?

849
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:50,818
He has a hearing in court today.

850
00:59:50,938 --> 00:59:51,618
He does?

851
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:02,687
You just watch, Mr. Tripathi.
In a couple of months...

852
01:00:03,418 --> 01:00:07,219
... you and I together,
will make this city crime free.

853
01:00:07,249 --> 01:00:10,058
Teasing girls? Now try messing with me!

854
01:00:10,338 --> 01:00:11,338
- Do it now?
- Mr. Tripathi...

855
01:00:11,418 --> 01:00:12,618
I will beat you so much...

856
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,658
- ...see what's going on?
- I'll check.

857
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:19,498
Teasing girls are you?

858
01:00:22,298 --> 01:00:23,818
Getting drunk and picking a fight?

859
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:28,378
- Now I'll show you two.
- Move. Move aside!

860
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:29,898
Sir...

861
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:33,098
...it's your little brother,
getting in a fight.

862
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,218
Call him here.

863
01:00:39,498 --> 01:00:40,618
What's going on here?

864
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:42,178
I am just getting started.

865
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:43,978
Trying to be a hero, are you?

866
01:00:44,018 --> 01:00:45,818
What shall I do?
Other's don't get it...

867
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:46,978
...and I can't lose it.

868
01:00:47,097 --> 01:00:48,218
Come on. Come with me.

869
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,378
Sir is calling you. Come on.

870
01:00:56,178 --> 01:00:56,898
Here he is, sir.

871
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:58,378
Arrest him.

872
01:00:58,898 --> 01:00:59,898
He's your brother, sir.

873
01:01:00,418 --> 01:01:01,378
So what?

874
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:03,578
Law and Order is
the same for everyone.

875
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,338
Handcuff him with the other one.

876
01:01:09,778 --> 01:01:11,538
Move in, will you.
Make space.

877
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,458
Will you let me scratch?

878
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,138
- It's time for my cardio.
- What?

879
01:01:43,178 --> 01:01:43,978
Hey!!

880
01:01:44,858 --> 01:01:46,698
Hey, let go! Hey!

881
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:48,698
What are you doing? Stop!

882
01:01:49,018 --> 01:01:50,503
Why are you dragging me along?

883
01:01:50,533 --> 01:01:52,138
- Hey stop! Are you crazy?
- Sir...sir!

884
01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:53,938
Stop them. They are running away...

885
01:01:54,488 --> 01:01:56,248
It's you who has been
running since so long..

886
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:57,789
...Mr. Tripathi...

887
01:01:57,951 --> 01:01:59,048
...from yourself.

888
01:02:00,648 --> 01:02:01,648
The time has come...

889
01:02:02,248 --> 01:02:04,288
...to make the medal
on your chest heavier...

890
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:07,088
...and to make the burden
of your daughter's death...

891
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:10,648
...lighter.

892
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:14,088
Shoot him.

893
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:16,688
Hey, I told you to stop! Stop!

894
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:43,988
I did one good deed, and now the
department has given me all the cases.

895
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:47,468
Just because I beat
up those innocent goons...

896
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:49,308
...and saved them from
those damn families..

897
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:54,868
You...you beat up those damn goons
and saved those innocent families..

898
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:56,838
...Now the Commissioner
has given me all the cases.

899
01:03:57,028 --> 01:03:57,628
Ronnie...

900
01:03:58,428 --> 01:03:59,348
...I am telling you.

901
01:03:59,725 --> 01:04:01,952
This job will...
One day...

902
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:04,228
...one day get me killed.

903
01:04:05,628 --> 01:04:06,468
Like father.

904
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:15,068
Nothing will happen.

905
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:18,148
I am there with you. Always.

906
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:19,548
Are you Shahrukh Khan?

907
01:04:20,228 --> 01:04:22,828
Someday because of your 'I'm there
for you' one day I won't be here.

908
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:26,828
Tell me something...

909
01:04:28,828 --> 01:04:30,668
...if big criminals can have henchmen.

910
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:36,828
Why can't a Policeman
have a henchman too?

911
01:04:42,308 --> 01:04:42,988
What do you mean?

912
01:04:43,683 --> 01:04:44,908
Meaning the action that took place..

913
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:50,708
...there's going to
be an action replay of that.

914
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,088
Well done. Well done.

915
01:05:13,262 --> 01:05:14,408
Well done.

916
01:05:14,728 --> 01:05:16,288
You deserve my ancestral sword.

917
01:05:16,408 --> 01:05:17,487
- Photographer.
- Yes Sir..

918
01:05:17,517 --> 01:05:18,208
Photo please.

919
01:05:18,488 --> 01:05:19,688
Smile cops.

920
01:06:32,648 --> 01:06:36,008
Bhokelal Mupe Chatora

921
01:06:36,048 --> 01:06:37,328
...is proud of you.

922
01:06:38,608 --> 01:06:39,328
Proud of you.

923
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:40,408
Proud of you.

924
01:06:40,728 --> 01:06:41,608
Good boy.

925
01:06:41,848 --> 01:06:43,048
Take it. It's yours.

926
01:06:43,328 --> 01:06:44,008
This garland.

927
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:45,928
Good.

928
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:46,728
Good.

929
01:06:46,928 --> 01:06:47,848
Clap.

930
01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:53,608
Welcome inspector Vikram.
The most decorated cop.

931
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:54,419
By the way...

932
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:57,968
Intelligence has confirmed that
Inder Paheli Lamba aka IPL kidnapped

933
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:01,389
some families from our country...
...and sent them to Syria.

934
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:06,688
We fear that he's connected with the
head of Jaish-e-Lashkar, Abu Jalal Gaza.

935
01:07:07,032 --> 01:07:09,227
Now, this is your
special white passport.

936
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:11,288
And a letter from the
Ministry of External Affairs.

937
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:13,056
You will submit this
in their local Police Station...

938
01:07:13,086 --> 01:07:15,008
...and put in a request to
start the extradition process.

939
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,689
Sir, I am going to Syria?

940
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:20,568
See...he's so excited to know this.

941
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:22,768
I mean...don't kill anyone there.

942
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:25,188
So...here are your tickets.

943
01:07:25,218 --> 01:07:25,938
Your flight leaves tonight.

944
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:27,858
So all the best. I'll see you soon.

945
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:28,658
Sir...

946
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:29,858
Take care.

947
01:07:34,516 --> 01:07:35,798
I've packed warm clothes for you.

948
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:36,878
In case...

949
01:07:37,336 --> 01:07:38,598
Amazing...

950
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:42,078
Brother-in-law, paid holiday vacation.
Isn't that great!

951
01:07:43,173 --> 01:07:47,078
Honestly, Siya, I am in a huge mess!

952
01:07:47,718 --> 01:07:48,318
What?

953
01:07:48,837 --> 01:07:49,598
What?

954
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:50,998
Hey Ronnie...

955
01:07:52,078 --> 01:07:53,078
let's go.

956
01:07:53,864 --> 01:07:54,718
Where?

957
01:07:54,998 --> 01:07:55,798
With me.

958
01:07:58,718 --> 01:08:01,398
It's just routine paperwork,
finish it and come back soon.

959
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,078
Tell me something..

960
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:05,998
If I go everywhere with you
the bag will be out of the cat.

961
01:08:06,678 --> 01:08:07,998
Cat will be out of the bag.

962
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:09,718
Same thing.

963
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:11,518
- What happened?
- What happened?

964
01:08:11,548 --> 01:08:13,078
Nothing. Nothing.

965
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:14,118
Nothing.

966
01:08:17,478 --> 01:08:19,077
Have a safe flight and come back soon.

967
01:08:19,217 --> 01:08:20,358
And take care of yourself.

968
01:08:23,678 --> 01:08:24,438
Come here...

969
01:08:25,358 --> 01:08:25,958
Feed me...

970
01:08:44,678 --> 01:08:46,078
I'll miss you.

971
01:08:52,358 --> 01:08:53,358
Take care of yourself.

972
01:08:53,438 --> 01:08:54,358
Bye.
Bye.

973
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:55,558
Come! Let's leave them alone now..

974
01:08:55,638 --> 01:08:56,238
Vikram.

975
01:08:56,358 --> 01:08:56,958
Yes?

976
01:08:58,278 --> 01:08:58,678
I...

977
01:08:59,558 --> 01:09:00,758
I want to tell you something.

978
01:09:06,503 --> 01:09:09,518
Someone who will hold your
hand and learn to walk is coming soon.

979
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:12,798
- Our...
- Our child.

980
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:18,238
I love you.

981
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:20,718
Come back soon.

982
01:09:30,038 --> 01:09:30,918
Vikram.

983
01:09:31,118 --> 01:09:31,718
Yes?

984
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,198
Hello Ronnie...

985
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:46,678
Vikram.

986
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:48,728
I was worried about you.
How are you?

987
01:09:48,758 --> 01:09:50,878
I am fine. How are you?

988
01:09:51,206 --> 01:09:52,298
Wait a second.

989
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:54,498
Should I tell Ruchi
that you called me first?

990
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,098
No, I'll call her later.

991
01:09:57,563 --> 01:10:02,458
You see, I've never been so far away,
to a different country, without you.

992
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:05,298
So I was missing you.

993
01:10:05,978 --> 01:10:06,778
Ok tell me what you're up to.

994
01:10:07,058 --> 01:10:09,298
Well, right now I am eating dates.

995
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,978
And do you know the best part...

996
01:10:11,178 --> 01:10:13,698
...someone stole my wallet
as soon as I entered the hotel.

997
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:16,378
Are you serious?

998
01:10:16,658 --> 01:10:20,258
But what's even more interesting
is that no one recognized me as a cop.

999
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:22,298
Because my disguise was so good.

1000
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:24,498
So tell me when you are coming back?

1001
01:10:24,858 --> 01:10:26,098
Your wife is winding me up!

1002
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:27,868
I guess the backup team's here.

1003
01:10:27,898 --> 01:10:28,658
Wait. I am coming.

1004
01:10:28,698 --> 01:10:29,578
Yes, I'm waiting.

1005
01:10:30,058 --> 01:10:30,938
Be quick!

1006
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,058
Vikram.

1007
01:10:33,138 --> 01:10:33,658
Yes.

1008
01:10:35,938 --> 01:10:39,215
Shall I tell her that he
called me first instead of her?

1009
01:10:40,555 --> 01:10:41,618
She will be so jealous.

1010
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,538
Vikram.

1011
01:10:50,218 --> 01:10:51,458
No...Vikram.

1012
01:10:51,858 --> 01:10:52,818
Vikram get up!

1013
01:10:54,058 --> 01:10:55,938
Hey stop...hey!

1014
01:10:57,618 --> 01:10:59,658
Hey...stop! Let my brother go.

1015
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:01,338
Vikram...Vikram!

1016
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:02,418
Vikram get up!

1017
01:11:02,618 --> 01:11:04,338
Vikram, Vikram who are these people?

1018
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:07,138
Ronnie!

1019
01:11:07,258 --> 01:11:09,418
Vikram tell me, who is it?

1020
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,258
No...no! Don't touch him!

1021
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:14,578
Hey... stop that!

1022
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:19,018
No! No!
Hey you, leave my brother alone!

1023
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:21,298
Vikram!

1024
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:27,298
Hey, hey, hey you!

1025
01:11:45,378 --> 01:11:47,378
If anything happens to my brother...

1026
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:50,418
...then I swear on our father...

1027
01:11:51,578 --> 01:11:54,399
...I'll wipe your country
off the face of the earth.

1028
01:11:54,429 --> 01:11:56,578
I'll wipe your nation
off the God damn map!

1029
01:11:57,002 --> 01:11:58,018
Good luck with that.

1030
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:08,178
Vikram!!

1031
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:41,157
Siya,

1032
01:14:42,003 --> 01:14:43,683
I don't think
they are going to help us.

1033
01:14:44,403 --> 01:14:45,362
I think these people
are also involved.

1034
01:14:45,363 --> 01:14:46,173
I have a feeling we'll
have to find him on our own.

1035
01:15:17,923 --> 01:15:19,643
Where will we find brother-in-law?

1036
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,923
Vikram Charan Chaturvedi.

1037
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:27,963
Your brother.

1038
01:15:29,043 --> 01:15:30,523
You're looking for him, aren't you?

1039
01:15:30,923 --> 01:15:31,843
Who are you?

1040
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:37,523
The question is not
"who am i" but rather "what am I".

1041
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:41,883
I am a Pakistani.

1042
01:15:43,203 --> 01:15:44,483
The name's Akhtar Lahori.

1043
01:15:44,712 --> 01:15:47,772
And I know where my Indian brother is.

1044
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:49,323
Your brother Vikram...

1045
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:52,172
He came here looking for
IPL and went missing yesterday.

1046
01:15:52,724 --> 01:15:53,853
How do you know all this?

1047
01:15:53,883 --> 01:16:00,086
The question is not
"How" its "What I know".

1048
01:16:01,038 --> 01:16:01,683
What do you know?

1049
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:03,403
Just follow me.

1050
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:06,123
Not on Instagram, twitter or Tik Tok.

1051
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:08,203
- But on tok tok.
- huh?

1052
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:09,933
On the streets.

1053
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:12,143
And careful,
the cops are on your tail.

1054
01:16:12,173 --> 01:16:13,053
Look behind you.

1055
01:16:13,556 --> 01:16:14,533
Look behind you.

1056
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:18,293
Follow me.

1057
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:18,933
Come on.

1058
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,063
This is a crowded area,
so don't get lost.

1059
01:16:46,263 --> 01:16:49,063
Come, come! Sale is on.
Come to my shop!

1060
01:16:50,343 --> 01:16:51,983
Where are we going?

1061
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:52,783
Left.

1062
01:16:54,787 --> 01:16:55,743
Right.

1063
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:11,103
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1064
01:17:11,823 --> 01:17:12,543
Look over there...

1065
01:17:13,103 --> 01:17:14,143
We've lost the Police.

1066
01:17:14,503 --> 01:17:17,343
You're in Akhtar Lahori's area.

1067
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:20,503
Akhtar Lahori!

1068
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:23,903
Look behind you.

1069
01:17:24,218 --> 01:17:25,623
Look behind you.

1070
01:17:33,808 --> 01:17:34,503
Scared?

1071
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,303
Don't worry.

1072
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:42,943
Empty your pockets.

1073
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:46,263
Slide the bags over here.
I said slide it over to me.

1074
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:49,863
What are you looking at her for?
Exchanging looks here, are we?

1075
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:53,736
And you...handover everything you have.
Bangles, bracelets, earrings, anything.

1076
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:55,563
You don't have a thing on you.

1077
01:17:55,593 --> 01:17:58,183
Anyway, hand over your credit card.
What are you staring at?

1078
01:17:58,349 --> 01:18:03,182
Want some. Shall I give it from here?
From here? Shall I give it from there?

1079
01:18:03,463 --> 01:18:07,118
Don't mess with me.
I'll cut you open like an eggplant.

1080
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,518
Turn you into mashed eggplants.

1081
01:18:09,883 --> 01:18:10,963
The name's Akhtar Lahori.

1082
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,882
Even birds don't flap their wings
without my permission around here.

1083
01:18:13,912 --> 01:18:15,083
What do they not do?

1084
01:18:24,203 --> 01:18:25,083
What just happened here?

1085
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:26,283
Look down.

1086
01:18:26,825 --> 01:18:27,403
Huh...

1087
01:18:27,766 --> 01:18:29,123
Look down.

1088
01:18:35,118 --> 01:18:36,963
Scared out of your mind, aren't you?

1089
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:38,763
Yes, sister, I am.

1090
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:41,443
Brother...

1091
01:18:41,923 --> 01:18:42,563
Excuse me.

1092
01:18:42,643 --> 01:18:46,533
You see, I was at the Police Station when
you were trying to make a complaint.

1093
01:18:46,706 --> 01:18:48,333
And I overheard your conversation.

1094
01:18:48,363 --> 01:18:51,733
I used that same story
to lure you in here.

1095
01:18:52,209 --> 01:18:54,043
I...

1096
01:18:55,443 --> 01:18:56,665
I am doing this for my brother.

1097
01:18:57,043 --> 01:18:59,563
Altaf.
He's suffering from Polio.

1098
01:19:00,643 --> 01:19:01,963
He's the reason I am doing this.

1099
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:04,563
You're doing it for your brother?

1100
01:19:05,923 --> 01:19:06,643
Yes.

1101
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,643
Then you're doing the right thing.

1102
01:19:13,344 --> 01:19:16,323
But don't ever rob anyone
else while pretending to help them.

1103
01:19:26,588 --> 01:19:27,923
Brother...

1104
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:31,083
My brother doesn't have Polio.

1105
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,733
Brother...

1106
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:39,453
I don't even have a brother.

1107
01:19:42,037 --> 01:19:43,452
Frankly speaking...

1108
01:19:46,069 --> 01:19:48,253
...when I came here from Pakistan...

1109
01:19:49,933 --> 01:19:51,733
...I arrived with "Shaan"
(Pomp) and "Shaukat" (Grandeur).

1110
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:54,173
But then they left me stranded here.

1111
01:19:54,846 --> 01:19:56,533
Shaan and Shaukat
were my uncle's kids.

1112
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,163
You really don't know
anything about Vikram.

1113
01:19:59,193 --> 01:20:00,113
I'm not that well connected..

1114
01:20:00,233 --> 01:20:04,033
My contacts are pickpockets, chicken
thief, locksmiths, goat thief...

1115
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:05,683
"You want to know
an interesting fact..."

1116
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:08,203
"...someone stole my
wallet as soon as I got here.

1117
01:20:08,233 --> 01:20:10,033
- If you need anything from them...
- Wait a minute.

1118
01:20:11,313 --> 01:20:13,283
Vikram's wallet was stolen
yesterday evening at 6 pm.

1119
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,403
You know every pickpocket,
can they help?

1120
01:20:16,433 --> 01:20:17,993
Don't worry, sister.

1121
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:20,313
With the grace of God, I'll find
every piece of information I can.

1122
01:20:20,713 --> 01:20:21,913
Ask how?
Ask...

1123
01:20:22,457 --> 01:20:22,993
How?

1124
01:20:23,433 --> 01:20:25,794
"Rehmat and Barkat"
(Blessings and Grace).

1125
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:27,513
They know every
pickpocket in the city.

1126
01:20:27,713 --> 01:20:30,793
I'll ask him when, how, where, who...
What time did you say?

1127
01:20:31,033 --> 01:20:31,993
Day before yesterday, 6 pm.

1128
01:20:33,647 --> 01:20:34,433
Keep this.

1129
01:20:34,814 --> 01:20:36,633
You touched my heart.
I will help you out.

1130
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:37,387
Let's go.

1131
01:20:46,262 --> 01:20:47,873
He's the one. Andre Gomez.

1132
01:20:48,371 --> 01:20:50,193
Rehmat and Barkat told me about him.

1133
01:21:00,353 --> 01:21:02,273
- I...
- He's a little hard of hearing. Let me try.

1134
01:21:02,593 --> 01:21:05,273
It's not about a toilet.
It's about a wallet.

1135
01:21:05,303 --> 01:21:07,593
You stupid little deaf idiot...

1136
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:10,073
Sorry for using such
words in front of you.

1137
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:12,592
Wallet! Wallet!

1138
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:33,340
Vikram!

1139
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,633
Yes, this is his wallet.

1140
01:21:54,592 --> 01:21:55,683
He's trying to be over-smart.

1141
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:15,843
I found out everything.

1142
01:22:16,028 --> 01:22:18,895
Reached down the throat of
a bellboy and got all the information.

1143
01:22:18,925 --> 01:22:20,643
There was some trouble
in room no. 121.

1144
01:22:20,923 --> 01:22:21,563
Let's go.

1145
01:22:25,931 --> 01:22:26,963
Room no. 121.

1146
01:22:45,499 --> 01:22:46,723
What are you doing?

1147
01:22:47,283 --> 01:22:48,723
God's blessed me with skills.

1148
01:22:48,753 --> 01:22:52,693
And Noor gave me this
master key on request.

1149
01:22:52,723 --> 01:22:54,203
You just wave it and...

1150
01:22:57,758 --> 01:23:00,003
It's got a keyhole.
Please continue.

1151
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:03,603
Listen, wait.
Here.

1152
01:23:04,332 --> 01:23:05,603
- Go, hide.
- Yes, yes. We're going.

1153
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:11,303
What is she doing?

1154
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:32,333
Come in.

1155
01:23:38,593 --> 01:23:40,833
This is the room.
His phone was right here.

1156
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:43,283
I could see everything.

1157
01:23:43,313 --> 01:23:44,403
How are you?

1158
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:45,513
I am absolutely fine.

1159
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:46,633
How are you?

1160
01:23:46,993 --> 01:23:48,033
Vikram was sitting here.

1161
01:23:48,393 --> 01:23:50,492
Then suddenly,
he went there to the door.

1162
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:52,993
I guess the backup team's here.
Wait, I'll be right back.

1163
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,178
- Vikram?
- Yes.

1164
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:09,513
He asked for my help.

1165
01:24:09,855 --> 01:24:10,925
Ronnie!

1166
01:24:12,993 --> 01:24:14,593
He was begging them...

1167
01:24:15,393 --> 01:24:16,633
Don't hit me.

1168
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:20,753
And I couldn't do anything about it.

1169
01:24:24,472 --> 01:24:28,688
Then he picked up the
phone and spoke to me.

1170
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,774
And then he threw the phone down.

1171
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:34,793
Down?

1172
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:39,639
Ronnie!

1173
01:24:48,611 --> 01:24:51,043
Brother, don't touch the phone.

1174
01:24:51,073 --> 01:24:53,753
It will have that idiot's
finger prints all over it.

1175
01:24:56,193 --> 01:24:57,714
I'll find out all
the details about him.

1176
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,483
But only the Police can find that out.

1177
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,203
And I don't trust them.

1178
01:25:12,403 --> 01:25:13,954
Don't worry.

1179
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,483
This city is my Raj and Taj.

1180
01:25:16,051 --> 01:25:20,073
You mean you have friends
called Raj and Taj.

1181
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:21,363
Who are going to do this job.

1182
01:25:21,662 --> 01:25:23,003
No, I just spoke in general.

1183
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:27,003
Doesn't matter,
we'll find out who he was.

1184
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:29,283
Let's go.

1185
01:25:50,851 --> 01:25:52,363
Hey, you blind or what?

1186
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:55,963
Yes, that way.

1187
01:25:56,645 --> 01:25:58,643
Come on, let's go. Let's go quickly.

1188
01:26:37,803 --> 01:26:39,323
Ronnie, I'll be right back.

1189
01:26:41,672 --> 01:26:42,653
Yeah, Ruchi. What is it?

1190
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:45,903
I've been trying Vikram's
number since yesterday.

1191
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:47,253
But his phone's switched off.

1192
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:50,173
And that stupid Ronnie...
He keeps wandering around all day.

1193
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,333
And I am worried about Vikram.

1194
01:26:52,678 --> 01:26:55,964
Don't worry, Ruchi.
Brother-in-law will be home soon.

1195
01:26:57,349 --> 01:27:00,703
In fact, Ronnie did call.
He spoke with brother-in-law.

1196
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:03,903
He said that brother-in-law
was trying to call you and say...

1197
01:27:03,933 --> 01:27:05,973
...that his phone will stay
switched off while he's on the job.

1198
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:09,073
I forgot to tell you. Sorry.

1199
01:27:09,233 --> 01:27:10,433
Thank God, Siya.

1200
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,593
And you're so stupid.

1201
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:14,433
Couldn't you tell me this earlier?

1202
01:27:15,713 --> 01:27:17,713
Poor Junior hasn't eaten all day,
you know.

1203
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,993
Feed something to my Junior.

1204
01:27:20,128 --> 01:27:21,793
Brother-in-law will be home soon.

1205
01:27:22,313 --> 01:27:23,513
Anyway, I'll hang up now.

1206
01:27:23,713 --> 01:27:24,713
And you take care.

1207
01:27:25,033 --> 01:27:27,033
And please come back soon.
I miss you.

1208
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:29,113
- Okay, bye.
- Bye, bye.

1209
01:27:39,313 --> 01:27:40,393
No, no.

1210
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,313
Siya.

1211
01:27:49,513 --> 01:27:52,033
How long will I have to lie
to Ruchi about brother-in-law?

1212
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:53,033
Hey.

1213
01:27:55,866 --> 01:27:56,753
Listen to me.

1214
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:58,273
Everything will be alright.
Okay...

1215
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:01,153
We're a team, aren't we?

1216
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,673
huh?

1217
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:05,993
You're with me right?

1218
01:28:09,876 --> 01:28:11,153
You're with me, aren't you?

1219
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,993
Always.

1220
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:24,923
Promise your father
that you'll look after him.

1221
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:27,793
- Promise Chaturvedi.
- Promise.

1222
01:29:34,071 --> 01:29:36,815
Amazing, man.
You hacked the Police record.

1223
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:38,663
Here you go. I am very happy.

1224
01:29:53,743 --> 01:29:55,543
This is where we'll find Zaidi.

1225
01:29:55,943 --> 01:29:57,663
Akhtar you go there.
Siya, you go that way.

1226
01:29:58,698 --> 01:30:00,623
Have you seen this man, sir?

1227
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:06,983
Wow...what a woman.

1228
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:10,623
She's not Kamal's but Jamal's woman.

1229
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:39,983
These boys are giving
some sort of signal.

1230
01:30:48,303 --> 01:30:49,383
Zaidi.

1231
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,063
Zaidi.

1232
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,343
Zaidi.

1233
01:32:28,503 --> 01:32:29,583
Where is my brother?

1234
01:32:53,066 --> 01:32:54,663
He's just started a family.

1235
01:32:56,147 --> 01:32:57,983
He hasn't harmed anyone.

1236
01:33:33,538 --> 01:33:34,023
Hey...

1237
01:33:34,623 --> 01:33:35,423
Hey...

1238
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:36,663
Get up.

1239
01:33:40,339 --> 01:33:41,023
Get up.

1240
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:43,743
You can't die like this.

1241
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:46,783
Tell me where my brother is?

1242
01:33:48,023 --> 01:33:48,703
Tell me...

1243
01:33:52,783 --> 01:33:55,383
Vikram!

1244
01:34:02,423 --> 01:34:04,023
Woke up?
Good morning.

1245
01:34:04,423 --> 01:34:05,503
Get up, get up.

1246
01:34:17,623 --> 01:34:19,503
You came here after me, huh?

1247
01:34:39,463 --> 01:34:40,243
Vikram!

1248
01:34:40,545 --> 01:34:40,943
Vikram get up.

1249
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:42,263
Hafeeza.

1250
01:34:43,853 --> 01:34:44,663
Brother Vikram.

1251
01:34:45,604 --> 01:34:46,743
Who did this to you?

1252
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:48,263
You?

1253
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:50,583
You're here?

1254
01:34:51,087 --> 01:34:54,583
They kidnapped us to,...

1255
01:34:55,455 --> 01:34:56,743
along with the rest...

1256
01:34:57,532 --> 01:34:59,834
We've no hope of escaping from here.

1257
01:35:00,343 --> 01:35:01,942
Only God can help us now.

1258
01:35:05,768 --> 01:35:07,389
Siya...

1259
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:13,138
Ronnie...Ronnie...
What happened?

1260
01:35:13,178 --> 01:35:14,654
- Where are you going?
- Brother!

1261
01:35:29,938 --> 01:35:30,978
What's written on it?

1262
01:35:31,639 --> 01:35:33,178
It's the name of the club.
Taj Mahal.

1263
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:35,378
I have seen the same box with IPL.

1264
01:35:36,058 --> 01:35:37,458
He must be a regular at the club.

1265
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:41,858
Siya, the only one to know about
Vikram's whereabouts now would be IPL.

1266
01:35:42,287 --> 01:35:43,938
But even if we go to this club...

1267
01:35:43,968 --> 01:35:45,778
...there's no guarantee
that IPL will show up.

1268
01:35:46,395 --> 01:35:49,378
Zaidi's phone.
Come!

1269
01:36:08,938 --> 01:36:10,338
Come on...come on...

1270
01:36:12,235 --> 01:36:13,138
Yeah!

1271
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,938
This dead Zaidi...

1272
01:36:21,538 --> 01:36:23,298
Will come in more handy
to us than the living one.

1273
01:36:27,803 --> 01:36:30,098
IPL will show up at Taj Mahal
today at 10 o'clock.

1274
01:38:54,358 --> 01:38:55,808
You? What brings you here?

1275
01:38:56,048 --> 01:38:59,983
My brother Zaidi has been murdered.

1276
01:39:01,778 --> 01:39:06,738
The one who called you
here is my brother's murderer.

1277
01:39:07,738 --> 01:39:09,338
I want him.

1278
01:39:16,522 --> 01:39:17,458
Where?

1279
01:40:22,098 --> 01:40:23,658
I am looking for my brother Vikram.

1280
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:25,298
And very stressed.

1281
01:40:26,578 --> 01:40:27,378
You won't understand.

1282
01:40:27,498 --> 01:40:28,275
Brother...

1283
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:32,298
Who would understand better than me...

1284
01:40:32,578 --> 01:40:34,578
...the sorrow of losing a brother.

1285
01:40:35,298 --> 01:40:39,378
If you don't find your brother,
then come to me.

1286
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:41,298
I will help you.

1287
01:40:41,778 --> 01:40:42,578
Thank you.

1288
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:47,496
Don't worry,
nothing will happen to your brother.

1289
01:40:50,458 --> 01:40:51,420
I won't let anything happen.

1290
01:41:02,069 --> 01:41:03,258
Bilal.

1291
01:41:37,184 --> 01:41:37,938
Abu Jalal?

1292
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,418
- No.
- Abu Jalal?

1293
01:41:41,918 --> 01:41:43,268
He hasn't even hit puberty yet.

1294
01:41:43,298 --> 01:41:44,098
Abu Jalal?

1295
01:42:59,895 --> 01:43:00,597
Hey...

1296
01:43:11,667 --> 01:43:13,818
Abu Jalal is not a man,
he's a shadow.

1297
01:43:37,818 --> 01:43:38,418
Come on.

1298
01:43:52,327 --> 01:43:53,138
Hey...

1299
01:43:53,168 --> 01:43:54,698
Did you come here with
a death wish like your brother?

1300
01:43:54,824 --> 01:43:57,258
Last time you lost a thumb.
Didn't you? Hero?

1301
01:44:12,098 --> 01:44:13,778
Your man lost a thumb.

1302
01:44:14,378 --> 01:44:16,298
Now you'll lose your head.

1303
01:44:16,489 --> 01:44:19,441
Look behind you.
We passed the Police Station.

1304
01:44:27,343 --> 01:44:30,978
This... Where are you taking me?

1305
01:44:31,181 --> 01:44:33,992
Don't you watch films,
You loser?

1306
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:37,819
Where are criminals taken
other than the Police Station?

1307
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:42,738
That reminds me, wasn't there
a famous kawa (tea) shop around here?

1308
01:44:42,996 --> 01:44:45,658
- Let's stop the car, let's have some Kawa.
- When did I say that?

1309
01:44:46,258 --> 01:44:47,741
Yes, okay.

1310
01:44:53,449 --> 01:44:55,018
Akhtar, order some tea.

1311
01:45:01,969 --> 01:45:05,218
Whether you offer me tea or poison,
but I'll never open my mouth.

1312
01:45:05,938 --> 01:45:07,258
Great.
Cheers.

1313
01:45:10,422 --> 01:45:11,258
Cheers brother.

1314
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:12,538
Cheers!

1315
01:45:15,937 --> 01:45:16,658
Keep this...

1316
01:45:37,298 --> 01:45:38,878
Here, here..
You want this?

1317
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:45,218
This isn't right, sister.

1318
01:45:45,578 --> 01:45:48,297
We're feeding the enemy,
entertaining him, giving him money...

1319
01:45:48,327 --> 01:45:50,619
...and letting him go.

1320
01:45:51,526 --> 01:45:53,018
Abu Jalal's men were following us.

1321
01:45:53,796 --> 01:45:55,698
They will think that
IPL has joined hands with us.

1322
01:45:55,778 --> 01:45:58,018
We let him go because
he told us everything.

1323
01:46:00,382 --> 01:46:03,178
Abu Jalal's men will try to kill IPL.

1324
01:46:04,828 --> 01:46:05,628
What next?

1325
01:46:05,908 --> 01:46:07,908
- Behind you.
- What?

1326
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,508
Look behind you.

1327
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:13,388
Stop!

1328
01:46:13,745 --> 01:46:14,828
Stop!

1329
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:33,508
Those mad men!

1330
01:46:34,308 --> 01:46:35,988
I worked 15-years for these people.

1331
01:46:36,374 --> 01:46:37,628
Without caring for my life.

1332
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,188
And now they want to kill me.

1333
01:46:39,808 --> 01:46:41,728
You wanted information, didn't you?
I'll tell you everything.

1334
01:46:42,008 --> 01:46:44,928
Abu Jalal is planning a
big terrorist activity in 3 hours.

1335
01:46:45,008 --> 01:46:46,928
The hell with Abu Jalal.

1336
01:46:47,578 --> 01:46:48,418
Where's my brother?

1337
01:46:48,938 --> 01:46:50,098
He has your brother, Ronnie.

1338
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:54,138
He's alive,
but I don't know for how long.

1339
01:46:54,817 --> 01:46:56,201
He's planning at least 10 blasts.

1340
01:46:56,338 --> 01:46:58,588
The domestic airport,
people's council...

1341
01:46:58,618 --> 01:47:01,018
Government schools, Central Mall...

1342
01:47:01,048 --> 01:47:02,418
All Human Bombs.

1343
01:47:02,738 --> 01:47:05,818
And they are using Indians,
Pakistanis...

1344
01:47:05,848 --> 01:47:06,860
...and the locals for this mission.

1345
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:10,738
The first attack on the
embassy will be by your neighbour.

1346
01:47:11,498 --> 01:47:12,138
Asif...

1347
01:47:12,751 --> 01:47:13,538
and his son.

1348
01:47:14,498 --> 01:47:15,338
Junaid.

1349
01:47:15,617 --> 01:47:16,108
Junaid.

1350
01:47:23,047 --> 01:47:24,218
Hurry up, I know the locations.

1351
01:47:24,338 --> 01:47:25,818
Siya, you go with Bilal.

1352
01:47:26,138 --> 01:47:28,018
Yeah...
And you?

1353
01:47:28,418 --> 01:47:29,508
I'll go get Vikram.

1354
01:47:29,538 --> 01:47:30,249
What?

1355
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:31,108
Alone?

1356
01:47:31,138 --> 01:47:32,778
That place is not safe to go alone.

1357
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:34,238
Ronnie!

1358
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:35,498
You explain to him.

1359
01:47:36,058 --> 01:47:36,616
Ronnie.

1360
01:47:43,298 --> 01:47:44,458
Will you do me a favour?

1361
01:47:45,242 --> 01:47:46,578
If you find Abu Jalal...

1362
01:47:47,098 --> 01:47:48,756
Then knock his lights out.

1363
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:47,908
IPL said that his son Junaid
must be in one of the cars.

1364
01:49:07,406 --> 01:49:08,098
Asif...

1365
01:49:08,531 --> 01:49:09,378
I'm sorry...

1366
01:49:26,574 --> 01:49:28,018
This is Abu Jalal's check post.

1367
01:49:28,423 --> 01:49:29,868
There are two big
watch towers over here.

1368
01:49:29,998 --> 01:49:32,998
And at least a dozen armed guards here
who guard the place day and night.

1369
01:49:33,212 --> 01:49:34,678
And they are all very dangerous.

1370
01:49:35,078 --> 01:49:39,278
Beyond that is a huge ground
that's as big as a desert.

1371
01:49:39,718 --> 01:49:42,398
Maybe they are already
bringing the hostages here.

1372
01:49:42,798 --> 01:49:44,128
And maybe Vikram's among them.

1373
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:46,038
...after this huge ground...

1374
01:49:46,068 --> 01:49:47,958
...comes Abu Jalal's real den...

1375
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:49,638
...which is nothing
short of an army base.

1376
01:49:49,668 --> 01:49:51,278
As good as an entire country.

1377
01:49:51,612 --> 01:49:54,408
You can say that he's
created his own world.

1378
01:49:54,813 --> 01:49:57,758
Abu Jalal Gaza keeps
himself surrounded by...

1379
01:49:57,788 --> 01:50:01,462
...Dozens of tanks, missiles,
helicopter and dangerous weapons.

1380
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:03,448
But this is a very dangerous area,
believe me.

1381
01:50:03,478 --> 01:50:06,078
We'll have to make
a plan and act accordingly.

1382
01:50:06,424 --> 01:50:07,438
Are you listening to me, Lahori?

1383
01:50:07,468 --> 01:50:08,638
Yes, yes.

1384
01:50:08,758 --> 01:50:09,638
Ronnie.

1385
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,238
Where did he go?

1386
01:50:19,038 --> 01:50:21,711
IPL, not behind.
Look ahead.

1387
01:50:42,034 --> 01:50:43,198
Bro...

1388
01:51:52,778 --> 01:51:54,618
- Check post's completely destroyed.
- What are you doing?

1389
01:51:54,658 --> 01:51:57,162
- He did it pretty well.
- Exactly, let's go over to the ground.

1390
01:51:57,192 --> 01:51:59,188
- No, I've always been scared of grounds.
- Come on.

1391
01:51:59,218 --> 01:52:00,418
I've never gone to any ground.

1392
01:53:42,051 --> 01:53:43,089
Vikram.

1393
01:53:47,528 --> 01:53:48,408
Ronnie, be careful.

1394
01:53:48,527 --> 01:53:49,408
They are wearing bombs.

1395
01:53:50,235 --> 01:53:51,488
One by one get them all down.

1396
01:53:52,008 --> 01:53:54,613
- Don't worry...
- Come down one by one.

1397
01:53:55,327 --> 01:53:57,099
- Careful. Come out.
- Where is Vikram?

1398
01:53:57,565 --> 01:53:59,168
Come on. Come on.

1399
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:02,008
This is just us.
Vikram isn't with us.

1400
01:54:04,008 --> 01:54:05,688
I guess Abu Jalal
has changed his plan.

1401
01:54:05,848 --> 01:54:06,968
Vikram must be with the other group.

1402
01:54:07,088 --> 01:54:09,168
Go Ronnie. We'll handle it here.
You go.

1403
01:54:10,368 --> 01:54:13,018
Take your jackets off
and lookout for the landmines.

1404
01:54:13,048 --> 01:54:15,283
But you need to hurry up,
because we're running out of time.

1405
01:54:26,764 --> 01:54:27,648
Brother Asif..

1406
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:33,088
Brother Asif..

1407
01:54:33,986 --> 01:54:35,018
Siya, you...

1408
01:54:39,048 --> 01:54:40,048
Go away from here...

1409
01:54:40,288 --> 01:54:41,368
- Move back!
- What are you doing over here, Siya?

1410
01:54:41,568 --> 01:54:42,088
Asif...

1411
01:54:42,888 --> 01:54:44,368
It's about to explode...

1412
01:54:44,688 --> 01:54:46,088
Everybody move back!

1413
01:54:46,288 --> 01:54:47,488
Move back!

1414
01:54:48,728 --> 01:54:49,448
Get back everyone!

1415
01:54:49,921 --> 01:54:50,648
Stay back.

1416
01:54:51,056 --> 01:54:52,328
- Move back. Move back.
- This is going to explode.

1417
01:54:52,358 --> 01:54:54,710
- Why did you bring them here?
- Everything will be fine.

1418
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:56,128
They have my family.

1419
01:54:56,731 --> 01:54:58,698
They have Hafeeza.
You go from here.

1420
01:54:58,728 --> 01:55:00,408
This is going to explode.

1421
01:55:00,608 --> 01:55:02,328
They're fine...nothing will happen...

1422
01:55:12,048 --> 01:55:13,448
Junaid, speak to your Dad...

1423
01:55:13,855 --> 01:55:14,928
- It's about to explode...
- Everything will be fine.

1424
01:55:15,304 --> 01:55:16,608
- Siya...
- Nothing will be fine!

1425
01:55:16,848 --> 01:55:18,608
My Hafeeza...My Junaid...

1426
01:55:18,774 --> 01:55:19,922
Go away.

1427
01:55:19,952 --> 01:55:20,648
Papa

1428
01:55:22,093 --> 01:55:23,928
- Asif.
- Papa.

1429
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,048
Asif, are you okay?

1430
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,898
Asif, where are you?

1431
01:55:27,928 --> 01:55:29,328
Yes, both of us are safe.

1432
01:55:29,928 --> 01:55:31,008
They are safe?

1433
01:55:32,084 --> 01:55:34,088
Junaid and Hafeeza are fine.

1434
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,288
Junaid and Hafeeza..

1435
01:55:44,968 --> 01:55:45,968
They're safe...

1436
01:55:49,898 --> 01:55:50,568
They're fine...

1437
01:55:50,598 --> 01:55:51,288
Siya...

1438
01:55:51,318 --> 01:55:52,888
Go to them please...

1439
01:55:53,477 --> 01:55:54,488
Bring them to me...

1440
01:55:54,808 --> 01:55:58,568
Go and bring them to me...

1441
01:56:01,758 --> 01:56:03,168
Watch your steps everyone.
Walk carefully.

1442
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:06,288
Mom.

1443
01:56:07,986 --> 01:56:09,568
Dear, don't move.

1444
01:56:10,188 --> 01:56:10,708
Don't move!

1445
01:56:10,738 --> 01:56:12,388
- Sophia.
- Everyone, stay right where you all are.

1446
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:13,868
Sophia!

1447
01:56:14,937 --> 01:56:16,668
Don't move...

1448
01:56:17,855 --> 01:56:18,868
Sophia!

1449
01:56:20,068 --> 01:56:21,948
- My child.
- You can't go there!

1450
01:56:22,668 --> 01:56:23,468
Hey, look here.

1451
01:56:23,855 --> 01:56:24,428
Don't move.

1452
01:56:24,628 --> 01:56:26,868
I am here. Uncle's here for you.
Your mom's there.

1453
01:56:27,028 --> 01:56:28,348
Save my child.

1454
01:56:28,547 --> 01:56:29,398
It's a bomb...

1455
01:56:29,428 --> 01:56:30,948
Do you want to see magic?

1456
01:56:31,268 --> 01:56:32,868
Magic...

1457
01:56:33,228 --> 01:56:34,428
Magic...

1458
01:56:35,068 --> 01:56:36,668
- Bomb...
- Save my child...

1459
01:56:51,283 --> 01:56:52,068
Go kid.

1460
01:56:54,288 --> 01:56:55,028
Mom.

1461
01:56:55,736 --> 01:56:56,348
Mom.

1462
01:56:59,303 --> 01:57:00,228
Mom.

1463
01:57:09,216 --> 01:57:10,388
What are you doing?

1464
01:57:11,907 --> 01:57:14,388
- Akhtar, take everyone away from here.
- I am not leaving.

1465
01:57:14,771 --> 01:57:15,672
Have you lost your mind?

1466
01:57:15,702 --> 01:57:17,708
- Do you not understand?
- I won't leave you.

1467
01:57:17,896 --> 01:57:19,550
Should I..
Just leave already.

1468
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:21,028
I said leave.

1469
01:57:21,842 --> 01:57:22,828
Go man...

1470
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:27,158
What are you all looking at me for?
Go away.

1471
01:57:27,188 --> 01:57:28,828
Are you having pity on me?

1472
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,228
I brought half of you here.

1473
01:57:32,024 --> 01:57:33,308
- Go away.
- IPL...

1474
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:35,588
I beg you.

1475
01:57:36,803 --> 01:57:38,028
Please take them away.

1476
01:57:38,878 --> 01:57:40,528
Or we'll all die.
They will get here any minute.

1477
01:57:40,558 --> 01:57:41,678
Please listen to me...

1478
01:57:43,318 --> 01:57:44,398
Go away, brother.

1479
01:57:48,198 --> 01:57:49,118
Let's go.

1480
01:58:09,598 --> 01:58:12,318
Hey, come here...come here.

1481
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:21,518
Hey clown, can you solve a riddle?

1482
01:58:22,999 --> 01:58:27,388
What goes around and comes around and
stops to look you right in the eye.

1483
01:58:31,158 --> 01:58:31,998
'Karma.'

1484
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,846
Come on!!

1485
02:03:43,398 --> 02:03:44,210
Vikram.

1486
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:48,810
I am looking for my brother Vikram.

1487
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:00,160
They are asking about Vikram.

1488
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,280
Vikram, don't come out.

1489
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,479
Someone has destroyed their
whole territory for Vikram's sake.

1490
02:06:09,509 --> 02:06:11,822
They are very scared.

1491
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:17,600
But God has given us hope,
which we don't want to lose.

1492
02:06:18,925 --> 02:06:21,120
Vikram, don't come out.

1493
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,000
Don't come forward Virkam.

1494
02:06:43,155 --> 02:06:44,200
Ronnie.

1495
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,600
Ronnie.

1496
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:52,280
If you guys think you are smart,
then you don't know the half of me.

1497
02:08:58,729 --> 02:08:59,480
No...

1498
02:09:00,827 --> 02:09:02,000
I am Vikram.

1499
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,720
I am Vikram.

1500
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:11,880
I met your brother.

1501
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,840
I should have shot him right there.

1502
02:09:15,952 --> 02:09:17,160
It was a big mistake.

1503
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,440
I am the one who made a mistake.

1504
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:23,640
Every time I got in trouble,

1505
02:09:24,653 --> 02:09:27,160
I would scream and
call out to my brother...

1506
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:29,215
...and he would come to my rescue.

1507
02:09:30,933 --> 02:09:32,840
But this time I didn't call him.

1508
02:09:33,571 --> 02:09:34,480
But now I will...

1509
02:09:35,073 --> 02:09:36,160
So listen.

1510
02:09:37,149 --> 02:09:42,079
Ronnie!

1511
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:22,520
It's okay...

1512
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,840
Let it go...

1513
02:10:26,362 --> 02:10:27,800
Take me home.

1514
02:10:28,329 --> 02:10:30,040
If it was about me,
I would have kept calm..

1515
02:10:31,896 --> 02:10:33,000
But if it's about you...

1516
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:40,000
I thought, America, Russia..

1517
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,880
But you two Indian brothers...

1518
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:43,080
Made a...

1519
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,200
How do you say in Hindi?

1520
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,560
Made an idiot out of me.

1521
02:10:49,451 --> 02:10:50,480
I told you...

1522
02:10:51,080 --> 02:10:53,760
I'll help you find your brother.

1523
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,480
Take him.
Take him.

1524
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:57,080
Stop this madness.

1525
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,200
I won't take him alone,

1526
02:11:12,447 --> 02:11:14,160
but also the rest of my brothers.

1527
02:11:15,108 --> 02:11:16,760
Okay, take all your Indian brothers.

1528
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:19,760
Separate the Indians
from the Pakistanis.

1529
02:11:20,069 --> 02:11:21,440
I don't think you heard me clearly.

1530
02:11:23,442 --> 02:11:24,320
All my brothers.

1531
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:26,040
They are Pakistani.

1532
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,120
Your enemy.

1533
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:33,960
We all have a common enemy.

1534
02:11:35,096 --> 02:11:36,040
You.

1535
02:11:39,464 --> 02:11:40,730
Okay. Fine.

1536
02:11:40,945 --> 02:11:42,720
You can take all of them.

1537
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:11,450
Siya?

1538
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:16,850
Ronnie.

1539
02:12:17,299 --> 02:12:17,970
Ronnie.

1540
02:12:23,770 --> 02:12:26,130
Ronnie...Ronnie...Let go!

1541
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:26,770
Leave him.

1542
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:28,249
Ronnie...Let him go!

1543
02:12:28,279 --> 02:12:30,650
Leave him.

1544
02:12:30,996 --> 02:12:31,850
Get off!

1545
02:12:32,050 --> 02:12:34,050
I'll kill you!

1546
02:12:35,234 --> 02:12:37,330
Let my brother go.

1547
02:12:37,602 --> 02:12:39,370
i swear on my father!

1548
02:12:39,970 --> 02:12:42,370
I'll kill everyone!

1549
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:45,730
Don't touch my brother!

1550
02:12:46,152 --> 02:12:48,890
I won't let you go alive!

1551
02:12:49,731 --> 02:12:51,690
I'll kill each of you!

1552
02:12:51,925 --> 02:12:54,330
I'll kill you all!

1553
02:12:54,724 --> 02:12:56,410
I'll kill you all!

1554
02:12:59,157 --> 02:13:02,487
Let my brother go!

1555
02:13:03,297 --> 02:13:05,330
Hit them Ronnie!

1556
02:13:06,865 --> 02:13:07,914

02:13:11,578 --> 02:13:13,459
Ronnie!

1558
02:13:15,459 --> 02:13:17,390
Leave my brother alone.

1559
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:18,310
Let go.

1560
02:13:22,129 --> 02:13:23,310
You were hitting my brother!

1561
02:13:23,430 --> 02:13:25,190
Don't touch my brother!

1562
02:13:25,654 --> 02:13:27,560
Ronnie hit them...Ronnie

1563
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:29,150
You were hitting my brother!

1564
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:30,790
Leave him.

1565
02:13:30,950 --> 02:13:32,550
I won't spare any of you.

1566
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:34,390
Don't touch my brother.

1567
02:13:35,318 --> 02:13:37,840

I'm coming Ronnie.
Hey you, don't touch my brother..

02:13:48,238 --> 02:13:49,389
You hurt my brother!

1572
02:13:49,419 --> 02:13:50,870
You hurt my brother!

1573
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:59,550
You hurt my brother!

1574
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:03,150
You hurt my brother!

1575
02:14:04,153 --> 02:14:06,150
How dare you hurt my brother!

1576
02:14:10,584 --> 02:14:13,710
You touched my brother!

1577
02:14:22,326 --> 02:14:27,430
You shouldn't have hurt my brother!

1578
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:32,430
You shouldn't have hurt my brother!

1579
02:14:35,230 --> 02:14:37,429
How did you lay a
finger on my brother?

1580
02:14:37,459 --> 02:14:40,630
How did you? How? How?

1581
02:14:41,256 --> 02:14:44,830
You shouldn't have hurt my brother!

1582
02:14:47,408 --> 02:14:48,710
Abu Jalal..

02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:52,046
You shouldn't have hurt my brother!

1584
02:14:55,730 --> 02:14:59,210
No one has dared to
touch my brother till date.

1585
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:01,993
How could you do it?

1586
02:15:10,956 --> 02:15:12,655
Abu Jalal..

1587
02:15:12,685 --> 02:15:18,010
You shouldn't have hit my brother!

1588
02:15:28,998 --> 02:15:30,810

1589
02:15:32,166 --> 02:15:33,770

Siya.

1594
02:15:46,653 --> 02:15:48,350
He's not getting up!

1595
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:50,470
Ronnie!

1596
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:52,430
Siya.

1597
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:00,670
Siya.

1598
02:16:01,085 --> 02:16:02,710
Siya.

1599
02:16:02,912 --> 02:16:04,070

Get up brother!
Get up already.

1604
02:16:23,453 --> 02:16:26,207
See how much he's bleeding, Siya.

1605
02:16:26,237 --> 02:16:28,407
Why isn't he getting up?

1606
02:16:29,455 --> 02:16:31,865
Do this. Do this.

1607
02:16:35,455 --> 02:16:37,185
Come on.

1608
02:16:47,997 --> 02:16:50,277
I am doing it. I am doing it.

1609
02:16:50,307 --> 02:16:53,486
Do it again, please.

1610
02:16:54,058 --> 02:16:55,809

Ronnie!

1613
02:17:04,117 --> 02:17:05,887
This cant be happening.

1614
02:17:06,056 --> 02:17:07,157
Ronnie get up!

1615
02:17:07,277 --> 02:17:09,207
- Ronnie.
- Ronnie If you don't get up...

1616
02:17:09,237 --> 02:17:10,727
...I will kill you.

1617
02:17:10,757 --> 02:17:13,327
Siya, whenever I scream Ronnie,
he comes.

1618
02:17:13,357 --> 02:17:14,677
I'll call him.

1619
02:17:14,837 --> 02:17:16,276
- Ronnie!
- Ronnie!

1620
02:17:16,306 --> 02:17:18,237
- Ronnie get up
- Get up

1621
02:17:18,267 --> 02:17:21,006
- Ronnie!
- Ronnie! Wake up.

1622
02:17:26,637 --> 02:17:28,237
Ronnie! Wake up.

1623
02:17:29,837 --> 02:17:33,037
- Ronnie! Wake up.
- Ronnie!

1624
02:17:55,267 --> 02:18:00,294
Inspector Vikram Charan Chaturvedi
has made us proud.

1625
02:18:09,197 --> 02:18:11,237
People cross limits
for relationships...

1626
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:14,037
...but I have one such relationship...

1627
02:18:15,041 --> 02:18:16,637
...for which I crossed borders.

1628
02:18:17,906 --> 02:18:20,241
What do we humans want in life?

1629
02:18:20,997 --> 02:18:24,328
Just that our loved ones are safe.

1630
02:18:25,991 --> 02:18:29,137
When they are in harm's way,
it scares the life out of us.

1631
02:18:30,237 --> 02:18:33,517
They get hurt, and we feel pain.

1632
02:18:34,975 --> 02:18:37,072
We might come from any caste,
religion, or country...

1633
02:18:37,677 --> 02:18:39,775
...we might follow different
customs and rituals.

1634
02:18:40,337 --> 02:18:42,045
But we are human beings after all.

1635
02:18:43,126 --> 02:18:45,197
The same blood runs through our veins.

1636
02:18:46,358 --> 02:18:49,477
Our emotions are the same.
And our feelings too..

1637
02:18:50,671 --> 02:18:53,477
And when someone tries
to play with our emotions...

1638
02:18:54,077 --> 02:18:57,447
...then every common man like
me won't stop to think whether...

1639
02:18:57,477 --> 02:18:59,997
...his enemies are 10 or 10,000.

1640
02:19:00,397 --> 02:19:01,597
Or the entire world.

1641
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:04,367
All he'll say...

1642
02:19:04,397 --> 02:19:06,597
...if you hurt my family...

1643
02:19:08,157 --> 02:19:09,997
...I will destroy the world.

1644
02:19:10,877 --> 02:19:12,957
Like me, he will turn into a rebel too.

1645
02:19:15,153 --> 02:19:16,141
I wish you were here.

1646
02:20:00,357 --> 02:20:01,228
Papa.

1647
02:20:09,826 --> 02:20:13,687
If crossing any limit, to
keep your word given to your father...

1648
02:20:13,717 --> 02:20:15,117
...is rebelling.

1649
02:20:15,902 --> 02:20:17,070
Then I am a Rebel.

1650
02:20:17,672 --> 02:20:19,647
If saving your brother's life...

1651
02:20:19,677 --> 02:20:21,772
...and putting your own life at stake,
is rebelling.

1652
02:20:22,799 --> 02:20:26,593
Then I am a Rebel. And always will be.
