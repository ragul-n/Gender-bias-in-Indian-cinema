Howeverthere is no rule
against laughing and clapping.

10
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:54,696
For your information all
the characters of this play.

11
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,133
Are not imaginary in the least.

12
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:59,398
So have fun.

13
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:32,361
A great actor is one who
can lie with utmost conviction.

14
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:35,439
And one who can lie
to uphold the truth.

15
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,367
That is a one hell of a drama queen!

16
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,002
The curtain neverfalls
on this real life drama.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,505
This is why l can't
fall asleep doctor.

18
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,078
So you can't fall asleep?

19
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:46,679
Since when?

20
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,722
Mr. Parmar? Ram?

21
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:51,656
RP

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,093
lt's common for us creative
folks to face insomnia.

23
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:59,165
Doctor, you're a psychiatrist.
Just give me some sleeping pills.

24
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,422
And l'l be fine.

25
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,100
Since when are you
unable to fall asleep RP?

26
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,198
Forthe past three months.

27
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,402
You can't sleep even
for a few minutes?

28
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:07,005
Not a wink, even after
downing an entire bottle of rum.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,871
Afull bottle!
Everyday? Forthree months?

30
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:15,106
Calories doctor. A human
body needs 2500 calories per day.

31
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,114
l need this since
l can't consume a morsel.

32
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:20,451
No food in three months?

33
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:23,019
What is the girl's name?

34
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,853
RP? C'mon its very common..even
l have gone through the same.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,188
You shouldn't punish yourself
so much over one break-up!

36
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,424
Three break-ups! ln 3 months?

37
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,232
Actually that suicide attempt
Suicide attempt as well?

38
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:40,564
Suicide attempt..

39
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:46,808
lt happens. A break-up, then
loss of appetite, sleep then alcohol..

40
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,580
On top of that you're an actor.

41
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:49,944
All this culminating
in a suicide attempt.

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,018
No, no doctor. Reverse gear.

43
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:56,081
A suicide attempt started
this entire drama.

44
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:00,048
Drama. Please explain.

45
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,521
Doctor, there is a Chinese proverb.

46
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:08,062
Nee jo luh tah de sheng ming,
ta de ming jo you fuze.

47
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:14,774
lf you save a life,
you are responsible for it.

48
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,733
Go on.

49
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,002
l am a theatre actor, director.

50
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,582
3 months ago our

51
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,581
Had completed 1500 shows.

52
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:30,046
lt was also my girlfriend's birthday.

53
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:33,216
And, l was late to see her.

54
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:39,697
Hi Chitra!

55
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:40,493
Where are you?

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,589
Happy birthday!

57
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,895
Again? - Yeah once again.

61
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,203
You said the same thing an hour ago.

62
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:48,706
That actorwho plays Ram.

63
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,070
What that idiot?

64
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,905
Chandra sir had almost
packed him off today..

65
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,242
Why does my boyfriend have
to carry the weight of the world?

66
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:55,546
You know in life.

67
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,914
l know, in RP's rule book
everyone should get a second chance.

68
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:01,544
Bye, love you.

69
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,082
Oh shit!

70
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,233
Let go! - No!

71
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:21,131
Leave me! - No way!!

72
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,681
Don't move, careful.

73
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,818
My name is RP.

75
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,593
Be careful, you will cut yourself.

76
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,655
Don't move, don't shake!

77
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,298
What do you mean no?

78
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,940

82
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:28,406
Met him? You danced with him!

83
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,838
Harish's wedding? Don't you remember?

84
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,346
Hey buddy! Are you ok?

85
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,376

Oh come on Chitra!

He was part of our gang!

88

Buddy? He was the soul of the party!

89
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,151
Always smiling.

90
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,623
Full of..

91
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:51,796

97
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,209
390 rupees.

98
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,376
How is the fish?

99
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,113
Dead!

100
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:04,934
No.

101
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,916
Bloody hell! Horrorfilm!
l almost died of a heart-attack!

102
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,950
l couldn't even take my own life.

103
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,388
l am good for nothing.
A burden on earth.

104
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,248
You shouldn't say this.

105
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,922
..especially about yourself.

106
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,860
l brought a rope..

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,763
..chose an auspiscious moment.

108
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:37,760
l was dying in peace.

109
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,866
Why did you save me? Why?

110
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:42,839
l'm sorry.

111
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,843
l'm sorry. Actually if l
hadn't seen you hanging that way.

112
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,077
l am genuinely sorry.

113
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,415
lt was my first time,
won't happen again.

114
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,452
Again?

115
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,551
Do you know how much courage it takes?

116
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,124
l'm sure.

117
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,560
God knows when l will
be able to try it next.

118
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:03,954
Why are you speaking like this?

119
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,525
Why don't you try living?
lt's not a bad idea.

120
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,466
Ask yourfamily.

121
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:12,931
Holy shit!

122
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,099
Holy shit!

123
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,040
You ok?

124
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:21,341
Holy shit holy cow bloody hell!
Oh God no! - Relax!

125
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,106
The only family l have is my ajji.

126
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:23,806
What?

127
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,782
Ajji means grandmother.

128
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,817
My grandmother. She raised me.

129
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:30,412
Good show.

130
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,189
She raised you well.

131
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,087
Two days ago l sent her a letter.

132
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,353
Suicide note!

133
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,524
Sent it?

134
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:38,855
Already?

135
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,861
lf she reads it.

136
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:44,233
Oh god!

137
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,436
OK. OK. You posted
it 2 days ago right?

138
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,565
So she will get it tomorrow?

139
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,379
We'll go there early in the morning
and grab it before she gets it.

140
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,969
No one will ever know
such a letterwas written.

141
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:56,904
Where does your ajji stay?

142
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,420
My leg was in a cast when
Harish got married. Fracture.

143
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,151
Oh Yeah! lt was hurting real bad.

144
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,420
lt hurts even more when you lie to me.

145
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,620
Trust is very important
in a relationship.

146
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:12,421
Well that guy.

147
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,056
You don't even know his name.

148
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,158
lf l had asked his name,
he would be dead by now.

149
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,600
He was committing suicide.

150
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,034
Oh my god.

151
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,903
l am sorry.

152
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:25,300
People like asking for help,
you like helping them and l like you.

153
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,107
lt is like a vicious cycle.

154
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,472
You could have dropped
him at his place instead.

155
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,845
That's what l am
about to do sweetheart.

156
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,145
He won't stay here for another minute.

157
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,010
l'll drop him at his grandma's place.

158
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,850
lmmediately and be
back before you know it.

159
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:38,051
Where does she stay?

160
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,055
Nearby Not too far.

161
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:40,618
Where exactly?

162
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,895
How do l explain this? l'll
go straight, then left, then right.

163
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:46,295
And then continue straight
on the expressway via Chemburto Pune!

164
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,423
Sorry?

165
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,457
Why are you sorry?

166
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:18,621
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''

167
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:24,097
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''

168
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:32,204
''The destinations are asleep.''

169
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:34,644
''So are the routes.''

170
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:40,477
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''

171
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:48,083
''The destinations are asleep.''

172
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:50,526
''So are the routes.''

173
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,660
''The world's asleep.
The sky's asleep.''

174
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:25,462
This is the accelerator
and his is the clutch?

175
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,162
Actually opposite this.

176
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,127
Yes.

177
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,162
There is a brake as well?

178
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,070
l should drive.

179
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:44,546
''As the night grew those with homes,
slept in their homes.''

180
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:55,494
''As the night grew vagabonds like us,
were lost in the darkness.''

181
00:11:56,095 --> 00:12:04,230
''The destinations are asleep.''

182
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,635
''So are the routes.''

183
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:12,035
Stop.

184
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,137
stop stop!

185
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,480
That is my ajji's house. Go.

186
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:19,142
Me?

187
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,511
Definitely not me!
lf she has survived my letter.

188
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,489
Then she will definitely die on
seeing me, thinking that l am a ghost.

189
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,638
Who do you want?

190
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:43,700
Hello Ajji.

191
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,674
Who are you?

192
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,810
l am a friend of your grandson.

193
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:49,476
Mandar's friend?

194
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,913
Yes yes Mandars friend.

195
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:55,181
l wanted his birth certificate.

196
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:57,120
Now?

197
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:01,260
When Mandarwas growing up.

198
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,025
He had attended a theatre workshop.

199
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,165
He seemed so happy!

200
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,868
He had written me a
beautiful letterfrom there.

201
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,132
His first letter.

202
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,800
And?

203
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:20,806
And now this l received
it just this morning.

204
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,915
Have you read it?

205
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,647
l just had a cataract operation dear.

206
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:32,018
How can l read it?

207
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,217
You read it for me.

208
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:37,695
of course ajji,Who better
than me to read Mandar's letter!

209
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,733
l waited so long for someone
to come along and read it to me.

210
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,269
Read son read.

211
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:46,201
Tell me quickly!

212
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:49,274
My dearest,ajji my respects.

213
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,306
My Mannu best wishes
to him,read ahead.

214
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,546
My life is a disaster.

215
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:55,711
Was.

216
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,343
Now it's moving along beautifully.

217
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:01,844
Nobody was willing to give me company.

218
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,080
Job!

219
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,853
But now l've got a good job
and plenty of respect in the office.

220
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,155
l'm very sorry l couldn't call you.

221
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,287
Where does he work?

222
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:12,963
lt is a very big company ajji.

223
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,760
Really? So they pay him too?

224
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,994
Pay? He says he's a manager!

225
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,137
With a lot of respect, he adds.

226
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,340
How is this possible?

227
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:22,164
Why, ajji?

228
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,608
Mannu is a 12th grade fail.

229
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,481
They were so awed by my personality.

230
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,982
They didn't even ask
me for qualifications!

231
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,520
l can't believe it.
Mandar can only do one thing.

232
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,645
What ajji?

233
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,987
When you can't do anything else,
you become an actor dear.

234
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,655
And what happens to the
person who can't even act?

235
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,822
He becomes a director.

236
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,293
Zero respect for artists.

237
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,296
That's all he has written ajji.

238
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:51,666
Wait son.

239
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,138
Hasn't he written
anything about Nandini?

240
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,633
Bloody drama queen!

241
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:59,006
Yes, Nandini's the past now.

242
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:00,506
He's over her.

243
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,212
The 'totally over,
no chance of going back' type.

244
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,716
Wonderful!
l expected this from my Mandar.

245
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,184
l forgot to tell you, he's also
written that he's found someone else.

246
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,278
She's a doctor.

247
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,284
And a model.

248
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,856
Homely doctor model.
And now l'm off to commit suicide.

249
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:15,950
What?

250
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:19,759
Commit myself to a new business.Start
it myself. Something like that.

251
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,832
Ok, read on.

252
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,061
Just this much.
Seeking your blessings, Mandar.

253
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,133
Ok Ajji, l should leave.

254
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,967
Wait, you came by car right?

255
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,062
Yes, why?

256
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,577
The dholak is placed properly right?

257
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,882
Yes ajji.

258
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,760
Where is yourtemple? Close-by?

259
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:54,026
Still far away. Come close.
l have to tell you a secret.

260
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,128
Something's been bothering
me for many days.

261
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,638
There are some medicines
on the dashboard if you need.

262
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:02,799
Do you know Nandini?

263
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:03,875
Would you like chewing gum?

264
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:08,379
Nandini. She had called
me six months back.

265
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,309
Let me check for Marathi
songs on the radio.

266
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,948
She was so upset!

267
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,346
She felt that Mandar
wasn't happy with her.

268
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,816
Should l turn up the air conditioning?
You must be feeling hot.

269
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,084
She started asking
what should l do Ajji?

270
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,716
How should l make him happy?

271
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:25,627
l told her straight 'you
can bring a donkey nearwater.

272
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:28,900
. He might also drink it,
but will that make him a horse?'

273
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:30,093
NO!

274
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:34,161
l asked her do you
want to see Mandar happy?

275
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,638
Then leave him.

276
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:44,647
She cried a lot!
But l convinced her ultimately.

277
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,151
Then she just vanished
from Mandar's life.

278
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,914
Just like Seeta had disappeared.

279
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,221
Has anything happened to my dholak?

280
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,293
Your dholak is fine.

281
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:58,858
No one would enjoy doing
this to one' own grandson.

282
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,030
Great. That's my temple.

283
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,898
Carefully Ajji.

284
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,742
Now l realize why you saved me.

285
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,514
So that l would live to see this day.

286
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,457
My own blood has betrayed me.

287
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:33,597
Good god. l am good for nothing.

288
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,467
Sorry.

289
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:45,568
''My heart's always
surrounded by grief.''

290
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:52,043
''There's just darkness
in my life now.''

291
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:58,150
''ln darkness.''

292
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,562
Hey Chitra.

293
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,066
Did you drop him off?

294
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,271
Actually what happened is.

295
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:16,268
Oh God RP.
Please don't get involved in this.

296
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,807
Mark my words, you'll be caught
between hospitals and police stations.

297
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:20,708
l know.

298
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:23,247
Even your rule book doesn't
permit a third chance

299
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,540
l will do something love.

300
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,509
Should l call a cab for you?

301
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:31,251
Anyway. VT station is that
way and a bus stop is this way.

302
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,284
Can't l wait here?

303
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,718
Wait forwhom buddy?

304
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:37,159
l have to go to work.
Come on, don't be like this.

305
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,616
Brother, l am not putting up an act.

306
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,318
l am really acting in a play.

307
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:09,254
l have directed it.
l am also an actor.

308
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,529
l am a nobody.

309
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:18,097
Come on!Your ajji said.

310
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,038
She said that you liked
acting when you were young.

311
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:27,270
Then come watch my play.
You'll love it. Come on.

312
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:31,049
Can't we go by your car?

313
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,949
This the last warning. Go!

314
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,148
Don't worry Seeta mummy.

315
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,656
if he troubles you one
more time he will be gone.

316
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,718
Oh!Director sir is here.
Let's talk later. - Hi Sita

317
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:46,097
Chandra sir l want a ticket.

318
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,697
Why can't you say it at least once?

319
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,666
'Mr.Producer l have a role for you.'

320
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:51,326
Yes of course l was
almost about to say it.

321
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,265
But l need a ticket right now,
for a special guest.

322
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,272
lf it's a paying guest
only then it's special for me.

323
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:56,773
Otherwise it's nothing.

324
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:04,948
Don't mind RP l don't mix
friendship with Laxmi Mummy.

325
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:07,876
Here's yourticket.

326
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:08,983
l'll see you afterthree hours.

327
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:09,713
Okay.

328
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:10,982
Three hours?

329
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:15,953
There is an interval. People have
some snacks there, at the canteen.

330
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:17,761
Snacks?

331
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,232
You can have some too.

332
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:24,733
Ok. Take care.

333
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,938
Can l come inside with you?

334
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,406
Why? This is the best
seat in the entire theatre!

335
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,174
Special seat.

336
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:35,305
This will definitely fall on me.

337
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:36,939
How do you know?

338
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:38,944
Something always
keeps on falling on me.

339
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:41,144
l am a favourite with
the pigeons and crows.

340
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,411
This theatre was built by the British.

341
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:46,123
A hundred and seventy years ago.
BMC has not even glanced at it once.

342
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,292
Nothing has fallen till date.

343
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:53,964
There is a first time for everything.

344
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,425
Mercy Lord Mercy.

345
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,971
Who?

346
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:05,808
Who has dared to do this to my sister?

347
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:07,776
Who?

348
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,377
l will teach him such a lesson.

349
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,514
That even the God of
Death will start fearing me.

350
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:16,919
Who has done this?

351
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,886
The second son of King Dashrath,
the king of Ayodhya.

352
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,523
The younger brother of Ram my Lord.

353
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:27,997
Your Majesty.

354
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:31,763
Your Majesty?

355
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,132
The second son of King Dashrath?

356
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,397
Ram's younger brother?

357
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,575
Lakshman!

358
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:39,975
Lakshman .

359
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,412
Where is he?

360

What l mean is 'Aren't
you two close to each other?'

366
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:11,405
Now you are not a real life Seeta.

367
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,508
To stop him from coming in your house.

368
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:16,647
You are not a real life Ram either.

369
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,756
l have heard that Ram's
wife is accompanying him.

370
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:40,131
So now that we are at the hospital,
should we go to the police?

371
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,667
lt was an accident! He will

372
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,637
And afterthat?

373
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,505

374
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,009
Sorry?

375
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:48,476
Fill up the form quickly

Madam is saying fill up the form
quickly else the patient will die.

377
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,087
Your patient is one
hell of a drama queen!

378
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:58,120
Really?

379
00:22:58,624 --> 00:22:59,921
What do you want to do?

380
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,664
Can you do me a favour?

381
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:14,730
Go ahead.

382
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,909
l even asked that nurse,
but he didn't listen to me.

383
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:21,004
Tell me.

384

00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:26,008
Morphine is a drug! Drug is the enemy!

386
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,710
Future is black when sugar is brown.

387
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,118
He is getting it. From that blue tube.

388
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:31,686
But why?

389
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,519
Please share it with
me for just ten minutes.

390
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,284
lt is hurting real bad.

391
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,584
Please give me some morphine!

392
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:38,060
lt is not so simple.We

393
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:40,131
l already feel like l am in a jail.

394
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:41,722
Mandar stop.
You won't get any morphine.

395
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:42,766

But l want morphine!

398
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:47,766
Don't you dare.

399
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:50,205
Morphine. Morphine!

400
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,007
You need to live a little
instead of asking for morphine.

401
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,384
And you can't find life in such tubes.

402
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,948
You need to go out and find it,
meet new people.

403
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:09,619
You are right l need to find it.
Thank you.

00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,554
Of course yes!

538
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,555
Not fair Chitra, not fair.

539
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:12,530
You had ruined my surprise last
yeartoo. Give me a chance at least.

540
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,572
Which surprise?

541
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,636
You always do this.

542
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:20,540
Ok, l'll forgive you this time.

543
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,476
Wait fortwo minutes.
l'll be back in five.

544
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:25,082
Go to the bedroom.
Close your eyes. Wait.

545
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:30,915
And Chitra. Don't ruin it this time!

546
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:40,453
What are you doing?

547
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,672
Just go for it.

548
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:02,008
Yes..

549
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,551
Yes!

550
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,547
Yes!

551
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:08,959
My answer is yes!

552
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:13,456
Of course l'll marry you!

553
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,467
Nandini!

554
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,728
Hi.

555
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:43,025
Should we talk to him?

556
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,185
Do you know a good doctor?
He has some kind of a throat problem.

557
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:46,487
Not.

558
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:49,461
His throat RP, about his life.

559
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:50,659
Don't get started on his life now.

560
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:52,999
He is heart-broken.He hates himself.

561
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:56,140
No, no. Flip side. He's a narcissist.

562
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:57,037
AWhat?

563
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:00,638
Someone who loves himself a whole lot.
Like Devdas.

564
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:01,507
Oh, ok.

565
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:04,705
And Mandar is not a normal narcissist.
He is a wounded narcissist.

566
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,978
Stop it now. He is my friend
now and he isn't all that bad.

567
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:10,677
Wounded narcissist

568
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:12,820
Bad! He's good.

569
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:15,182
How do you expect the poor
thing to handle so much pressure?

570
00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:16,089
Pressure?

571
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:19,923
His best friend is getting married.
That's pressure no?

572
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:23,125
But what does our marriage
have to do with Mandar?

573
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:27,170
He will now want to
repay the loan, wont he?

574
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:28,570
Loan?

575
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:31,073
RP. You have spent so much on him.

576
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:34,077
lf he is not able to repay that
he will naturally feel pressurized.

577
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,679
And he won't feel like
staying here forever.

578
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:40,042
l am requesting on his behalf.
please help him stand on his feet!

579
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:44,017
He was standing on
a suitcase four days back.

580
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:45,988
And he is still standing there.

581
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:48,819
To flow with the water
he has to first jump in it.

582
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:52,889
Don't just give him fish,
teach him how to fish!

583
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:53,860
Hello.

584
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:55,592
Ram is dead fish.

585
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:56,795
But Chandra sir?

586
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,901
He didn't spare even Shurpanakha.

587
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:00,129
She's quit!

588
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,166
So l am sending our
Ram on permanent exile.

589
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,701
Chandra sir how do we?

590
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:05,969
find a replacement
on such short notice?

591
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,669
l have already found
two-three options.

592
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,747
Let me know if you
have someone in mind.

593
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,716
Chandra sir how can l think
of options on the spur of the moment?

594
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:22,589
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

595
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:27,131
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

596
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:31,931
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

597
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,367
What can Mandar do?

598
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:37,200
RP tell me quick
who can play Ram's role?

599
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,235
l have just the man.

600
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,709
Pardon me Sita. l was bringing
the deerto console you.

601
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:52,687
to protect you.

602
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,654
Ok!

603
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:56,651
What a bore.

604
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,121
He is stretching it man.

605
00:36:58,229 --> 00:36:59,321
Just say the end line.

606
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:00,359
What?

607
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:02,925
Are you sure you want to marry RP?

608
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:04,766
Of course. Why?

609
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,632
Because l think he is retarded.

610
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:09,602
This actor is oozing talent
and l don't even have a drop of it.

611
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:10,833
No Mandar.

612
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:13,000
RP has rehearsed
with you so many times.

613
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,806
Just believe in yourself
and go say your lines confidently.

614
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:18,074
lt's pretty easy.

615
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,112
Hanging myself from
that tree was easier.

616
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:28,121
RP We cannot find a better
Ram in this time and age.

617
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,220
He is as good an actor as me.

618
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:32,421
Confirm him.

619
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:35,164
l think he is too generic.

620
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,300
Very common.

621
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:42,930
Common man wants this.
A hero. Veerassa

622
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,372
Veerassa? Please. Very lame.

623
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,742
l think we should
look at other options.

624
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:50,207
Mandar Lele?

625
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:51,179
Mahi, l am going home.

626
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,682
No. You are going on stage.

627
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,353
Mandar Lele? Mandar Lele?

628
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:59,748
Who was saying great things
about him the other day?

629
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:01,449
Go.Go.

630
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:02,750
Naseer sir?

631
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,824
You mean Naseeruddin Shah?

632
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:05,953
Yes. Resume?

633
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,797
Yes. He's the one!

634
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,962
See see!
Topper at London School of Drama.

635
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,398
He was as good as kidnapped
by New York Broadway.

636
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:21,302
Thank God Paresh Sir
brought him to Mumbai.

637
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,180
Paresh Rawal?

638
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:52,804
Should we start?

639
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:56,607
Ok. Mandar Lele.

640
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:00,080
Let's do Ram's monologue
after Seeta is kidnapped.

641
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:03,787
So l'll give you 3 counts.
You take it from there.

642
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:09,222
Ready? 3,2,1 start.

643
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:21,798
Start.

644
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:25,574
Arre start.

645
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,907
Forgive me Seeta!

646
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,943
l left your side to get the.

647
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,651
lnteresting pause.

648
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:48,757
to get the deer.

649
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,729
l.

650
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:02,070
You. Yours.

651
00:40:07,051 --> 00:40:08,109
Cross?

652
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:12,645
Auto?

653
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:16,820
Last audition, then afterthat.

654
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,695
Rickshaw?

655
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:22,726
Raksha!

656
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:26,898
Protected!
l should have protected you!

657
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:31,674
One.

658
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:35,879
lt's good.

659
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:41,083
One

660
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,149
Smell?.

661
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:46,789
One smell?

662
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:48,257
Exile!

663
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,023
My real exile has started.

664
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,357
Please come back.

665
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:02,903
Seete!Come back.

666
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,149
One more time.

667
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:15,742
You're good. You're very good.

668
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:18,219
You have created a revolution
on this audition stage.

669
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,056
The way you stayed in character
while seemingly out of it.

670
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,157
How do you do that?

671
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:25,885
Audience will definitely
go out after seeing this.

672
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:27,695
Only a few people
can actually understand.

673
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:28,993
the importance of this performance.

674
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:36,069
Only those whose hearts pump for
theatre can catch these undercurrents.

675
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:39,606
l will require a shock treatment
with all these currents. l will die.

676
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:43,603
Art for a director,
heart attack for a producer!

677
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:44,976
Don't take it to your heart Mandar.

678
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,013
You're good, you should know that.
Just wait forthe call.

679
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:48,810
Ok? Keep that down. Good.

680
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,148
One minute.

681
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:54,989
l want to take his volume test.

682
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,959
You must have done
this before Mr Mandar Lele.

683
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:00,931
Like this.

684
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,064
Volume up.

685
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,439
Volume down.

686
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,145
Now you do it.

687
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:18,279
Ready?

688
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,180
Are you a singer as well?

689
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:58,449
What a ham!

690
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:01,580
Mandar le le?

691
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:02,784
Take Mandar.

692
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,088
RP actually you are perfect for Ram.
Natural role for you.

693
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,861
We all know that RP
is a great human being.

694
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,595
Wow.

695
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:17,140
However he is still
a mere human being.

696
00:43:17,475 --> 00:43:21,138
And human beings are
prone to committing mistakes.

697
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:22,477
What is your point Chandra sir?

698
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,740
Suicide point.

699
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:24,978
What do you mean?

700
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:30,918
l won't let you take your
careerto a suicide point!

701
00:43:33,724 --> 00:43:35,783
Forget RP.

702
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,857
RP? RP

703
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:38,656
Freeze!

704
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:41,627
Turn slowly.

705
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,062
Stand.

706
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,867
Doesn't he look like a complete..

707
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:53,841
Total!

708
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:55,069
What!?

709
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:56,975
Do you really want a role Chandra sir?

710
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,248
Of course!

711
00:43:58,516 --> 00:43:59,141
Done.

712
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:00,174
l have a role of a lifetime for you.

713
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:01,683
And Ram will be played by Mandar Lele.

714
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,652
Done.

715
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:04,686
Cheers to that.

716
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:05,978
Cheers!

717
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:09,517
Where is he?

718
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,197
Hey RP.

719
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:18,091

''Everyone breaks up.''

Another one for my sister
in law's nephew please.

l am the only one who is faithful.

798
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:33,162
He's not faithful at all!

799
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:35,325
Open your eyes and ears madam.

800
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,931
There is no network here at all.

801
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:45,368
''You're such dramebaaz,
l am a dramabaaz.''

802
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,906
''Everyone's a dramebaaz.''

803
00:47:48,012 --> 00:47:51,311

Looks badly broken.

807
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:13,700
lt will never be fixed.

808
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,338
Yeah, no chance.

00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:27,308
Wait don't leave please.
l'll give you another plant.

817
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:27,947
Okay.

818

Nandu. What you saw there.

819
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:32,211
And heard.

820
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:34,357
Yeah that too but it just happened.

821
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:38,220
lt wasn't from my heart.
Really, it wasn't from my heart.

822
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:41,662
l don't want to know where
that was from. You and that..

823
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:45,257
Hey, it was nothing.
lt was absolutely casual.

824
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:47,299
And then suddenly
she was all over my lips.

825
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:50,301
And look at my luck,
you had to catch me then.

826

Please explain to

833
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,225
l don't think so.

834
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:11,692
lt's never happened with me,
norwith my friends.

835
00:49:11,795 --> 00:49:13,285
Why should l lie man?

836
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,000
Nandini, listen, please.

837
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:22,966
Go from here Lokesh. You're a dog!

00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,470
Hey. l'm your puppy.
Yourfavourite puppy.

839
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,977

But l'm all yours Nandu.

841
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:35,585
lt's over Lokesh.

842
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:36,981
lt's over.

843
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:41,449
Loki Loli.

844
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:45,756
l think it's best if you just leave.
Trust me buddy.

845
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:48,294
Cheel!

846
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,328
And now!

847
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:57,632
The next contestant to
try and lift this bow and win.

848
00:49:57,741 --> 00:50:01,370
Princess Seeta's hand in marriage.

849
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:06,882
The eldest son of King
Dashrath of Ayodhya Ram!

850
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:11,785
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

851
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,423
Lord of lords Mahadev's grand bow

852
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:20,620
Will be broken today.

853
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:22,699
By the grand archer.

854
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:24,329
Sri.

855
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:25,026
Ram.

856
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:25,631
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

857
00:50:25,736 --> 00:50:29,001
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

858
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:04,707
And in that manner
Sri Ram lifted the bow.

859
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:07,706
And broke it.

860
00:51:08,011 --> 00:51:11,071
You know something?
l'm frightened of loneliness.

861
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:13,613
Nandini.

862
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:17,278
George Washington said it is better
to be alone than be in bad company.

863
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:22,220
But life is meant to
be shared with someone.

864
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,891
Not if that 'someone'
is an unfaithful dog.

865
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:26,685
How can you ever be
with such a man again?

866
00:51:27,498 --> 00:51:29,090
l know Loli has made a mistake.

867
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,602
But forgiving him will be
an even bigger mistake. Trust me.

868
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,028
How so?

869
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,296
Just imagine its a
hypothetical situation.

870
00:51:36,874 --> 00:51:39,570
lf Loli tells you he's
stepping out to buy vegetables.

871
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:40,870
What would you think?

872
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:43,671
That we don't get
vegetables near my building.

873
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:44,770
Genius.

874
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:45,740
Of course, exactly!

875
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,710
So then where did he go? To a hotel?

876
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,683
A hotel room? A car?
ln the backseat of a car? With a girl?

877
00:51:49,787 --> 00:51:51,186
Enough!

878
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:57,660
l'm sorry.

879
00:51:58,195 --> 00:51:59,958
l didn't want to make you cry.

880
00:52:01,098 --> 00:52:04,033
l want you to see
ahead of the darkness.

881
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:07,196
There is light outside of it.

882
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:11,072
Where you will find a valiant leader,
worthy of your loyalty.

883
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,309
Yourfearless leader.

884
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,945
Not someone. You.

885
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:26,254
Ok, you. You, take care of yourself.
l'lljust leave ok?

886
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:32,254
That day, you saved my order.
And today me from breaking apart.

887
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:36,793
Well, l guess this is
what you call a coincidence.

888
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,366
Yes.

889
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:38,726
Yes.

890
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:44,933
Please give your blessings RP.

891
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,009
Live long.

892
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:56,909
My brother.

893
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,451
Shurpnakha?

894
00:52:59,022 --> 00:52:59,920
Did you see that?

895
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:00,947
Yes.

896
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:03,159
Then why don't you
do something about it?

897
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:05,859
What is bothering you?

898
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:08,694
He has humiliated me!

899
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,967
You couldn't save my honour.

900
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:14,063
Atleast save your Lanka!

901
00:53:14,505 --> 00:53:15,597
What do you want?

902
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:17,171
Finish him!

903
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:18,133
Whom?

904
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:19,807
Ram!

905
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,541
ls he that bad?

906
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:25,410
He is a culprit.

907
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:26,874
Move.

908
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:32,487
Do you know how he holds the bow?

909
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:37,685
And what is that
noise his throat makes?

910
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:41,195
Amitabh Bachchan's voice
was rejected by All lndia Radio.

911
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:43,455
Do you know the name
of the person who rejected it?

912
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:45,633
Nobody knows.

913
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,028
Only those people are remembered.

914
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,537
who can find a diamond in a coal mine.

915
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,870
A diamond.

916
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,574
ls this Raavan Leela orthe circus?

917
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,248
lf this is Amitabh Bachchan.

918
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,952
then l am MGM's lion.

919
00:54:12,262 --> 00:54:13,627
Meow!

920
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:18,531
Fire him tonight and end this circus!

921
00:54:20,203 --> 00:54:22,728
Mandar. Which is your
favourite restaurant?

922
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,734
Let's go afterthe show for drinks.

923
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:25,830
Was l that bad?

924
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:27,706
Not at all dude.There
is some good news for you.

925
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:28,800
Give it to me now, please.

926
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,137
Patience dearfriend.

927
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:32,613
The timing and lighting for
this good news must be perfect.

928
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:34,114
Okay.

929
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:35,984
Why should l come to dinner?

930
00:54:36,186 --> 00:54:38,120
Chandra fired him from the show.

931
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:40,780
ls that your good news.
l won't be able to see that.

932
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:42,592
He is so cute!

933
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:44,492
Control Seete control.

934
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,663
l Mandar might be getting fired
from the role of Ram but this Raavan.

935
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,957
Has made sure that his real-life
Seeta is around the corner.

936
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:51,228
Sorry?

937
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:52,260
You'll be sorry.

938
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:54,002
lf you miss this moment.

939
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:55,661
l got down

940
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:59,042
l have directed his Nandini's
real-life drama so brilliantly!

941
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:01,841
Here l will tell him
that she is available.

942
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:05,072
There Nandini will be running
towards Mandar in slow motion.

943
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:10,843
And then the fact that he
has been fired won't mean a thing.

944
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:15,082
Just pay forthe champagne.

945
00:55:15,592 --> 00:55:16,616
What?

946
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:21,021
This was Nandini's favourite
restaurant, mine too.

947
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:22,564
lt still is.

948
00:55:23,266 --> 00:55:24,699
We used to come here all the time.

949
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:28,326
OKeverybody! The good news is.

950
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:30,536
Yes?

951
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:37,736
ls that Chandra has decided
to make him Ram permanently.

952
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,784
l am sorry.

953
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:43,583
Excuse me.

954
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:47,748
Which was the scene
that he liked most?

955
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:53,157
lnterval.

956
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:18,130
Raavan, photo. Raavan, photo.

957
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:20,138
Of course.

958
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:22,366
Ok, l'm Raavan. Hi, hello.

959
00:56:22,642 --> 00:56:25,736
No no no, with Raavan. Photo. Raavan.

960
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:34,246
Your Mandar Lele is ruining
me even in his last show.

961
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:36,082
l feel like crying!

962
00:56:36,189 --> 00:56:39,625
These tickets are good
only for making paper rockets.

963
00:56:39,726 --> 00:56:42,957
Even those will go farther
than your Ram's arrows.

964
00:56:51,037 --> 00:56:56,873
Clapping! Go inside, clapping.
Welcome to lndia. Big show.

965
00:56:57,043 --> 00:57:01,412
Hey Abhi. l have heard that
when'Bombay to Goa' was being shot.

966
00:57:01,948 --> 00:57:03,347
That time the great Mahmood Sir.

967
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,680
Told the entire unit to
applaud whatever Mr Bachchan did.

968
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:07,650
lt worked wonders on
getting his confidence back.

969
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:10,687
l really need you to be Mahmood
Sirfor one of my actors today.

970
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,226
Please consider it
an actorto actor appeal.

971
00:57:14,427 --> 00:57:17,419
Only a theatre actor
has the powerto grasp.

972
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:20,128
The audience with his performance.

973
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:22,891
Let's go.

974
00:58:02,175 --> 00:58:04,143
Come on. Come on.

975
00:58:04,377 --> 00:58:09,974
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

976
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:14,713
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

977
00:58:14,821 --> 00:58:19,281
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

978
00:58:20,026 --> 00:58:22,085
Come on, pack up and leave.

979
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:24,491
Chandra Sir.

980
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:28,396
Dude your new Ram is just rocking!

981
00:58:29,336 --> 00:58:32,999
Chandra Sir. Fantastic.
What a show! Very well done.

982
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,935
You know my name Abhi sirji.

983
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:37,533
You know RP.

984
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:38,140
Yeah.

985
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:40,939
You know RP, your new Ram
takes the show to a whole new level.

986
00:58:41,348 --> 00:58:41,905
What's his name?

987
00:58:42,015 --> 00:58:42,845
Actually his name is.

988
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:45,747
Mandar Lele.
He is my discovery. Abhishesh sir.

989
00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:46,079
Really.

990
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:46,914
Yes.

991
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,956
Abhiji l am telling you
if l was auditioning yourfather.

992
00:58:51,057 --> 00:58:54,891
.At All lndia Radio then
l would have never rejected him.

993
00:58:55,762 --> 00:58:57,457
Just think what would have happened.

994
00:58:57,564 --> 00:58:59,759
Ah there is Mandar, Chandra sir.
l willjust give him your message.

995
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:01,231
Which message?

996
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:03,425
That one your honour and his end!

997
00:59:03,536 --> 00:59:05,800
What honour RP?

998
00:59:05,905 --> 00:59:08,499
lf Mandar is Amit sir
then you are MGM's lion meow.

999
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:11,843
You have a great sense of humour!

1000
00:59:11,945 --> 00:59:18,373
Leave it.
Anyway how do you know Abhishesh?

1001
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:20,180
l will tell you later.

1002
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:25,357
K. Abhishe-K.

1003
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:30,320
Abhishe-K.

1004
00:59:30,497 --> 00:59:32,590
Take money, take photo.
Take money, take photo.

1005
00:59:32,866 --> 00:59:34,094
Ram. Ram. Ram.

1006
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:46,337
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

1007
00:59:47,747 --> 00:59:50,716
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

1008
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:55,844
''Glory to Sri Ram.''

1009
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:00,352
You are not a burden
on earth anymore Mandar.

1010
01:00:01,694 --> 01:00:03,286
Live up to your potential Mandar.

1011
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:06,823
Come on!

1012
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,165
Come on! Come on!

1013
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:13,137
''You're such dramebaaz,
l am a dramabaaz.''

1014
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:16,868
''Everyone's a dramebaaz.''

1015
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:29,287
''You're such dramebaaz,
l am a dramabaaz.''

1016
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:33,291
''Everyone's a dramebaaz.''

1017
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:36,362
Hanuman, keep my ring with you.

1018
01:00:36,663 --> 01:00:39,223
When you meet Seeta,
then show it to her.

1019
01:00:39,332 --> 01:00:40,765
She will definitely talk to you then.

1020
01:00:41,267 --> 01:00:43,963
And do tell herthat l
am going to rescue her very soon.

1021
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,262
And tell herthat.

1022
01:00:45,738 --> 01:00:47,296
l think of her all the time.

1023
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:49,204
Long live Sri Ram.

1024
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:50,867
Long live Sri Ram.

1025
01:00:50,977 --> 01:00:53,172
Long live Sri Ram.

1026
01:00:54,948 --> 01:00:55,972
How was l?

1027
01:00:56,082 --> 01:00:58,778
Even l think of you with
every breath l take My Lord.

1028
01:01:08,595 --> 01:01:09,857
Mandar?

1029
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:12,631
What happened?

1030
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:20,102
Mandar! Mandar!

1031
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:22,032
Mandar!

1032
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:25,336
Ram is supposed to
be on stage in two minutes.

1033
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,206
Do something RP.

1034
01:01:27,313 --> 01:01:28,541
Mandar!

1035
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,842
Mandar open the door.

1036
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:33,177
Mandar open the door.

1037
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:35,915
Hello! What?

1038
01:01:36,089 --> 01:01:37,556
l don't want to do it anymore.

1039
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,624
But you are so good at it.
Everyone likes you.

1040
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:40,283
Abhishek Bachchan himself.

1041
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,322
My heart is pining.

1042
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:42,822
For Abhishek?

1043
01:01:43,029 --> 01:01:44,121
For Nandini.

1044
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:46,724
Her eyes.

1045
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:49,264
Her skin is so soft.

1046
01:01:50,036 --> 01:01:53,995
And you know what? Whenever she
used to lay her beautiful eyes on me.

1047
01:01:54,641 --> 01:01:57,804
.She used to stroke
her neck just like this.

1048
01:01:57,911 --> 01:01:58,775
What?

1049
01:01:58,878 --> 01:01:59,845
Yes.

1050
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,105
She would gently caress it.

1051
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,143
That used to be my green signal.

1052
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,318
And then l would.

1053
01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:12,720
You have an entry in one minute!

1054
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:14,793
l don't want to go on stage anymore.

1055
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,626
Mandar!

1056
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,260
Stop acting! This is a theatre.

1057
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:20,757
Being a drama queen won't work here.

1058
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:23,331
You and your show. That is
all you care about in this world!

1059
01:02:23,603 --> 01:02:24,695
You are so so..

1060
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:25,666
What 'so'? What?

1061
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:29,764
Self-centred.Selfish.
lnconsiderate.lnsensitive.

1062
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,178
Selfish?Me?

1063
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:41,078
l have literally been your
baby-sitter and changed your diapers.

1064
01:02:41,421 --> 01:02:42,888
.l don't like to boast Mandar.

1065
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:45,219
but actors will kill
forthis Ram's role!

1066
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:47,823
l was killing myself.
But you saved me and made me Ram!

1067
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:50,723
You are exploiting my talent,
crushing my feelings!

1068
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:51,421
Mandar.

1069
01:02:51,664 --> 01:02:53,598
Then the glorious Hanuman found Sita.

1070
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,166
l will kill you!

1071
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:56,800
Then kill me! lt is much
betterthan living without Nandini!

1072
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:59,929
l will gladly sacrifice
myself for Nandini.

1073
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:06,105
He has lost his mental balance.

1074
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:09,474
For Janaknandini Seeta!

1075
01:03:14,454 --> 01:03:15,682
You have come to help me out again.

1076
01:03:15,788 --> 01:03:17,688
How much can you handle
when you are alone?

1077
01:03:18,057 --> 01:03:21,458
Now that LoLi is completely
out of your life right?

1078
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:23,926
Because it's best that way.

1079
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:26,530
But keep in mind that he will
try his best to get back with you.

1080
01:03:26,733 --> 01:03:29,793
Take you out for dinner maybe
to yourfavourite restaurant.

1081
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:33,164
Candle light dinner and you
will start melting before the candles.

1082
01:03:33,606 --> 01:03:38,009
And then anyway it's
your personal matter.

1083
01:03:38,211 --> 01:03:39,269
No say it.

1084
01:03:39,545 --> 01:03:41,740
Well l don't know what
the equation is between you two.

1085
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:44,481
But you should be
aware of how men think.

1086
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:46,575
Theirthinking pattern.

1087
01:03:46,686 --> 01:03:48,244
Anyway let's change the
topic it's getting very personal.

1088
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:52,787
No no tell me. The thinking pattern,
what were you saying?

1089
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:56,026
Well if man is a dog then
his thoughts are like a dog's tail.

1090
01:03:56,129 --> 01:03:57,221
Doesn't change at all.

1091
01:03:57,497 --> 01:03:59,556
One track mind always
thinking of that one thing.

1092
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:00,758
That thing?

1093
01:04:00,867 --> 01:04:03,131
That thing.

1094
01:04:04,537 --> 01:04:06,835
lt is getting very personal.

1095
01:04:07,674 --> 01:04:09,505
And the thinking pattern
is not just LoLi's.

1096
01:04:09,676 --> 01:04:13,976
.But about all those
men who are narcissists.

1097
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:14,839
Who are what?

1098
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,245
Narcissists.
Those who love themselves a lot!

1099
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:20,185
Like Shahrukh from 'Devdas'.

1100
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,018
Oh?

1101
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,521
And LoLi isn't your normal narcissist.
He is a wounded narcissist.

1102
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:25,919
What are you saying?

1103
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:26,855
Shahrukh from 'Darr'.

1104
01:04:27,026 --> 01:04:28,220
DDD Dangerous combination.

1105
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:29,653
Someone who has been rejected.

1106
01:04:30,663 --> 01:04:33,689
The magic in your eyes!

1107
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:38,302
Narcissists don't want to hear a 'no'.

1108
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:40,971
They stick to you like a
chewing gum sticks to your shoe.

1109
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:44,708
See?

1110
01:04:47,547 --> 01:04:48,070
Hello.

1111
01:04:48,181 --> 01:04:49,079
Can we meet today?

1112
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:50,544
l can't meet you today.

1113
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:51,574
Tomorrow?

1114
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:52,548
Not even tomorrow!

1115
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:53,311
Ok, day after?

1116
01:04:53,753 --> 01:04:54,583
Never!

1117
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:55,585
Why?

1118
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:56,652
Because you.

1119
01:04:56,923 --> 01:04:58,584
Please Nali please.

1120
01:04:58,691 --> 01:04:59,885
You are a wounded narcissist!

1121
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:00,856
Wounded narco?

1122
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,187
What?

1123
01:05:01,294 --> 01:05:02,784
Google it!

1124
01:05:05,164 --> 01:05:06,791
l don't know what l will do now.

1125
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:08,960
Life is beautiful Nandini.

1126
01:05:09,068 --> 01:05:13,095
Go out and bask in the sun,
get drenched in the rain.

1127
01:05:13,206 --> 01:05:15,037
Revive old friendships.

1128
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:17,807
But with whom?

1129
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:23,309
You will love my favourite restaurant.

1130
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,146
Sorry?

1131
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:28,584
l was thinking if you are
free for dinnertonight then..

1132
01:05:28,688 --> 01:05:30,121
No No lt's Sunday, how can l make it?

1133
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:33,156
Oh sorry.
l became a little too personal.

1134
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:34,851
No it's ok.

1135
01:05:35,027 --> 01:05:38,019
l don't want to go out with Lokesh.

1136
01:05:38,197 --> 01:05:42,361
But l can't avoid him
as he lives in my building.

1137
01:05:43,836 --> 01:05:46,270
He will definitely
persuade me to be with him.

1138
01:05:46,372 --> 01:05:49,671
And do you know?
l am very afraid of being alone.

1139
01:05:49,942 --> 01:05:52,172
l know.

1140
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:54,343
What makes you think l'm angry?

1141
01:05:55,348 --> 01:05:56,747
l can see.

1142
01:05:57,383 --> 01:05:59,749
l made chicken biryani just for you.

1143
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,820
Forthe first time in my life.

1144
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:03,852
And you are going out.

1145
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:05,184
We will go for dinnertomorrow.

1146
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:07,623
Like the time we
had gone on my birthday?

1147
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:08,659
Hey come on Chitra.

1148
01:06:08,895 --> 01:06:12,661
l was seriously beginning to feel
that you weren't serious about us.

1149
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:15,399
But then suddenly you proposed,
so beautifully.

1150
01:06:15,735 --> 01:06:17,794
l thought we were
ready forthe next level.

1151
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:20,395
But no! We are back to square one!

1152
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:22,798
l am going for a meeting.

1153
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:23,732
While having dinner?

1154
01:06:23,843 --> 01:06:24,639
lt's urgent.

1155
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:27,076
Can't you postpone it?

1156
01:06:27,246 --> 01:06:28,270
By tomorrow someone
else will seal the deal.

1157
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:30,372
Trust me, if this comes through,
we'll be the happiest.

1158
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,034
lt's very tasty.

1159
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:02,437
So.

1160
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:03,938
Why is this restaurant so special?

1161
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:05,810
Food, ambience.

1162
01:07:05,918 --> 01:07:07,579
Beautiful memories?

1163
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:10,916
My memories are farfrom beautiful.

1164
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:13,917
But memories help keep
us going during difficult times.

1165
01:07:15,228 --> 01:07:17,696
Like who had you mentioned
that day umm Mandar?

1166
01:07:20,867 --> 01:07:22,061
lt was Mandar, right?

1167
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:24,168
How do you know Mandar?

1168
01:07:24,537 --> 01:07:26,835
How can l know him?
You were the one chanting his name.

1169
01:07:27,773 --> 01:07:29,104
lmpossible!

1170
01:07:29,242 --> 01:07:32,973
Well, you were crying remember? l
was handing out tissues and you went.

1171
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:34,706
'Why is all this
happening to me Mandar.'

1172
01:07:34,814 --> 01:07:35,712
Really?

1173
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:37,077
Yes.

1174
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,979
l don't remember.

1175
01:07:39,218 --> 01:07:40,242
How can you remember?

1176
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,647
You were distressed and probably
that's why you thought of him.

1177
01:07:42,755 --> 01:07:43,278
Yeah.

1178
01:07:43,556 --> 01:07:45,922
You know your heart's
trying to tell you something.

1179
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:48,623
They have a unique way of reminding.

1180
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:51,196
You of the people
you cannot live without.

1181
01:07:51,531 --> 01:07:52,896
Yes and Mandar.

1182
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:55,695
ls definitely not one of them.

1183
01:07:57,537 --> 01:07:58,697
People change.

1184
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:00,031
Not Mandar.

1185
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:06,310
We were so hopeless together.
24/7 l had to take care of him.

1186
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:09,844
Like a plant.

1187
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:12,679
But you are very good with plants.

1188
01:08:12,818 --> 01:08:16,015
Only with those in my shop,
not in real life.

1189
01:08:17,623 --> 01:08:24,085
l want someone who will
lovingly take care of me.

1190
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,030
Excuse me.

1191
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:37,331
Take it off.

1192
01:08:38,644 --> 01:08:40,009
You're on a date, make sure
your boyfriend doesn't look away.

1193
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,240
Where can you find such
men who have eyes for only you?

1194
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:46,585
Don't take it off then.

1195
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:48,717
Seems like you came with Mr. wrong.

1196
01:08:48,821 --> 01:08:51,221
No no. The one l came with.

1197
01:08:51,691 --> 01:08:53,955
He saved me from Mr. wrong.

1198
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:57,254
Drama. Perhaps he is Mr. right.

1199
01:08:58,097 --> 01:08:59,758
How will l know?

1200
01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:01,765
Sweetie its 2013.

1201
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:03,095
You are in control.

1202
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:05,294
Me. How?

1203
01:09:06,172 --> 01:09:09,335
Be coy. Be dramatic.

1204
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,309
ln real love.

1205
01:09:12,578 --> 01:09:14,239
You need it.

1206
01:09:16,248 --> 01:09:17,306
l don't buy that.

1207
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,344
Cool.

1208
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:22,983
One day you will realize a little
drama is needed to get to the truth.

1209
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:24,880
Bye.

1210
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:34,222
RP!

1211
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:35,726
RP!

1212
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:36,767
Hey wassup?

1213
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:38,668
l was trying to catch your eye.

1214
01:09:38,771 --> 01:09:39,362
For a long while,
but you don't notice me!

1215
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:40,100
Really.

1216
01:09:40,206 --> 01:09:41,434
So still upset?

1217
01:09:41,707 --> 01:09:44,437
Don't be silly! So are you
having your dinner meeting here?

1218
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,199
Yeah.

1219
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:46,837
Same pinch!

1220
01:09:47,213 --> 01:09:50,341
Didn't you prepare biryani,
then how did you end up here?

1221
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,011
My fiance ditched
me on our dinner date.

1222
01:09:53,185 --> 01:09:55,449
So a sweet friend of his
brought me here for dinner.

1223
01:09:55,721 --> 01:09:56,050
What?

1224
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:56,814
You jealous?

1225
01:09:56,922 --> 01:09:57,946
Mandar is here too?

1226
01:09:58,057 --> 01:10:02,391
Yes, we are sitting overthere.
Where is your VlP party?

1227
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:08,266
Producer.

1228
01:10:09,935 --> 01:10:10,902
Looks very young.

1229
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:13,233
His father earns and this
guy spends it. Usual shit.

1230
01:10:13,406 --> 01:10:14,998
Don't get Mandar here.

1231
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:15,436
Why?

1232
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:17,869
l'm trying to give him a surprise.
lmpressing the producer.

1233
01:10:18,277 --> 01:10:20,370
We're making a production
with Mandar in the lead.

1234
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:21,844
ln Delhi, outside Bombay.

1235
01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:24,347
Afterthat just assume that
l've made Mandar into a fisherman.

1236
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:25,847
l love you!

1237
01:10:25,985 --> 01:10:27,009
Thank you.

1238
01:10:33,325 --> 01:10:34,019

Please go.

1241
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:41,856
You go.

1242

Go on.

1243
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:54,440
You go on.

1244
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:02,377
Sorry- lt's Okay.

1245

1246

Hi.

1247

Hello.

1248

l'm fine. How are you?

1250
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:54,731
Brilliant..

1251
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,602
Your hometown is Luck?

1252
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:58,472
Bhopal.

1253
01:11:58,911 --> 01:11:59,935
Right. And you studied at.

1254
01:12:00,045 --> 01:12:00,704
Saint Jo.

1255
01:12:00,813 --> 01:12:01,871
Jawaharlal Nehru.

1256
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,877
Hi.

1257
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:06,680
That's Chitra, my fiancee.

1258
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:09,113
That's me.

1259
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:09,880
Hi.

1260
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:12,990
Can l steal him fortwo minutes?

1261
01:12:16,162 --> 01:12:17,561
Just wanted to give him this.

1262
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,665
Don't kidnap him ok?

1263
01:12:25,838 --> 01:12:27,032
He's mine.

1264
01:12:35,815 --> 01:12:36,645
Vikas?

1265
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:38,813
Yes.

1266
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,944
Vikas?

1267
01:12:42,254 --> 01:12:43,050
Right, Vikas.

1268
01:12:43,222 --> 01:12:46,020
But you had undergone
a sex-change operation.

1269
01:12:49,228 --> 01:12:53,221
Yeah, so l repeated the procedure.

1270
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:55,622
Undo.

1271
01:12:58,103 --> 01:12:59,092
Now back to pavilion.

1272
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:06,568
Sorry, old friend.

1273
01:13:07,246 --> 01:13:08,213
ls this for me?

1274
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:09,640
No.

1275
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:13,785
Yup. Should we leave?

1276
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:16,751
lts stopped raining.
ls lovely outside.

1277
01:13:16,856 --> 01:13:18,983
Okay let's go.

1278
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:21,853
So where do you stay?

1279
01:13:22,595 --> 01:13:24,586
Nearby first left.

1280
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:26,794
Chitra.

1281
01:13:26,899 --> 01:13:28,867
Chitra Housing Society.

1282
01:13:30,102 --> 01:13:31,501
Too many mosquitoes these days.

1283
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:32,536
Are you okay?

1284
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:33,730
Yeah l am fine.

1285
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,868
So l have heard.

1286
01:13:35,975 --> 01:13:38,500
that every flower
has a specific meaning?

1287
01:13:38,677 --> 01:13:39,769
Yes.

1288
01:13:39,945 --> 01:13:40,877
Like a red rose means.

1289
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,641
l know what it means.

1290
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:46,850
ls there any Facebook
type flower in your shop?

1291
01:13:46,952 --> 01:13:48,112
Facebook type flower?

1292
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,518
Something that says it's complicated?

1293
01:13:50,789 --> 01:13:54,623
But if you honestly
speak your heart out..

1294
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:56,293
Why should it be complicated?

1295
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:58,655
lt will be a disaster if l do that.

1296
01:13:59,598 --> 01:14:00,929
Then give that special
person some flowers.

1297
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:03,001
l did just that and got trapped.

1298
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:05,832
But the flowers gave a message
which l neverwanted to convey.

1299
01:14:06,338 --> 01:14:07,805
Oh!

1300
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:08,896
What happened?

1301
01:14:09,008 --> 01:14:10,703
l am getting very confused.

1302
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,270
Chuck it. lt's complicated.

1303
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,546
Chitra.

1304
01:14:19,051 --> 01:14:20,678
l had a wonderful time. Thanks.

1305
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:22,253
Hey. There is no sorry
orthanks in friendship.

1306
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:23,349
Kiss me.

1307
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:25,817
No kiss me. Definitely no kiss me.

1308
01:14:25,925 --> 01:14:27,256
LoLi!

1309
01:14:27,793 --> 01:14:29,283
LoLi?

1310
01:14:29,895 --> 01:14:31,021
He is watching us.

1311
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,060
So?

1312
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:36,563
lf he sees us kiss then
he will never pester me again.

1313
01:14:37,002 --> 01:14:37,832
Serious.

1314
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:39,162
Yes.

1315
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:41,365
Ram please kiss me.

1316
01:15:22,214 --> 01:15:24,808
No.

1317
01:15:39,231 --> 01:15:45,795
No dialogue

1318
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:48,965
Thanks.

1319
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:50,936
Welcome.

1320
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:55,074
Good night.

1321
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,044
Good night.

1322
01:15:59,284 --> 01:16:07,885
''Come back to me, beloved.''

1323
01:16:07,993 --> 01:16:11,656
''Come back to me, beloved.''

1324
01:16:11,764 --> 01:16:17,100
''l yearn for you.''

1325
01:16:24,943 --> 01:16:32,850
''Come closerto me.''

1326
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:40,323
''l yearn for you.''

1327
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:46,794
''l yearn.. for you.''

1328
01:16:56,842 --> 01:17:02,781
''Why do you seem like a dream?''

1329
01:17:05,317 --> 01:17:09,185
''Why do you seem like a dream?''

1330
01:17:09,788 --> 01:17:13,747
''There's a fire burning in my eyes.''

1331
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:21,732
''My heart's only for you.''

1332
01:17:26,305 --> 01:17:30,401
''You're my life, my soul.''

1333
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:34,209
''Come closerto me.''

1334
01:17:34,313 --> 01:17:41,879
''l yearn for you.''

1335
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:47,949
''l yearn.. for you.''

1336
01:17:51,763 --> 01:17:54,288
''Come back to me..''

1337
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:58,026
''Come back to me..''

1338
01:18:06,145 --> 01:18:07,442
Where are you going?

1339
01:18:07,613 --> 01:18:09,012
Not me, her.

1340
01:18:09,248 --> 01:18:09,976
What!

1341
01:18:10,215 --> 01:18:10,909
Permanently.

1342
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:12,141
Why?

1343
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:14,179
She couldn't take
your daily drama anymore.

1344
01:18:14,453 --> 01:18:14,976
Taxi.

1345
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:16,076
l do a daily drama!

1346
01:18:16,188 --> 01:18:19,624
Flower, flower.
The flower you gave another girl!

1347
01:18:19,725 --> 01:18:21,556
She saw it.

1348
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:22,617
Are you serious?

1349
01:18:22,728 --> 01:18:22,955
Yes.

1350
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:25,052
As soon as we came home
she started packing up.

1351
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:26,461
You didn't do anything?

1352
01:18:26,765 --> 01:18:28,790
Of course l did!
l gave her my suitcase.

1353
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:29,196
What?

1354
01:18:29,468 --> 01:18:30,730
Yeah, she didn't have a bag.

1355
01:18:30,936 --> 01:18:31,698
You didn't say anything?

1356
01:18:31,904 --> 01:18:33,769
Course l did!
l said l can understand your pain..

1357
01:18:33,872 --> 01:18:34,497
..l've gone through it and..

1358
01:18:34,606 --> 01:18:35,265
Oh shut up!

1359
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,508
Taxi!

1360
01:18:36,608 --> 01:18:40,476
Chitra, Chitra,
come on please, please hear me out!

1361
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:41,204
Drive on please.

1362
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,846
Chitra, she was Nandini.
Mandar's girl!

1363
01:18:44,116 --> 01:18:46,550
l was trying to patch them up.
God promise!

1364
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:48,183
Stop the car please.

1365
01:18:50,055 --> 01:18:51,215
And take the bag out as well.

1366
01:18:51,957 --> 01:18:53,219
Don't go.

1367
01:18:55,827 --> 01:18:58,591
Chitra, what's the point of this
drama in the middle of the street?

1368
01:18:58,697 --> 01:19:01,257
lf you have any problem
we can sort it out at home.

1369
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:03,530
So you can lie to me again.

1370
01:19:04,736 --> 01:19:07,796
My problem isn't that girl,
who is quite hot by the way.

1371
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:10,905
Nor is it Mandar, who is very sweet.

1372
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,936
Hey come on, l'm hot and sweet too.

1373
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:19,209
Sorry, it's not enough.
Honesty is important too.

1374
01:19:19,518 --> 01:19:20,041
Don't be annoyed by these little lies.

1375
01:19:20,152 --> 01:19:21,016
Which are lies at the end of the day!

1376
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:22,618
Lies you only tell me..

1377
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:25,087
..because you don't want
to share your problems with me.

1378
01:19:27,326 --> 01:19:29,260
l will be alone even
when l am with you.

1379
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:31,592
l don't want that.

1380
01:19:33,165 --> 01:19:34,029
Chitra, l love..

1381
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:37,629
At least don't lie to yourself.

1382
01:19:39,638 --> 01:19:41,037
You're not that good an actor.

1383
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:47,171
Stop playing God Ram.

1384
01:19:48,547 --> 01:19:51,345
lf you can't tell Mandarthen
at least tell Nandini the truth.

1385
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:54,149
Keep her away from this drama.

1386
01:19:55,887 --> 01:19:56,911
Let's go.

1387
01:20:19,878 --> 01:20:20,640
Hi..

1388
01:20:23,849 --> 01:20:25,146
l want to talk to you.

1389
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:28,552
ln fact l was going to call you.

1390
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:29,746
Really?

1391
01:20:30,522 --> 01:20:31,921
Actually, l wanted to tell you that.

1392
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:32,956
l am sorry.

1393
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:37,119
Actually,
whatever happened that night.

1394
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:42,093
l kept kissing you because
Lokesh was still standing there.

1395
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:42,928
l know!

1396
01:20:43,035 --> 01:20:43,660
He was looking.

1397
01:20:43,769 --> 01:20:44,167
Yes.

1398
01:20:44,269 --> 01:20:45,293
l was just waiting for him to leave.

1399
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,231
And till then we kept acting.

1400
01:20:47,339 --> 01:20:48,237
Yes.

1401
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:51,673
And that's why l held yourwaist

1402
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,300
tightly.

1403
01:20:54,713 --> 01:20:56,840
And that's why l hugged you.

1404
01:20:56,948 --> 01:20:58,210
Very lovingly.

1405
01:20:58,917 --> 01:20:59,576
Yes.

1406
01:21:00,752 --> 01:21:02,344
And that's why l..

1407
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:06,720
Held yourface, in these hands.

1408
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:11,195
lt was all a drama.

1409
01:21:13,031 --> 01:21:15,363
You're quite a natural actor.

1410
01:21:15,867 --> 01:21:17,266
l am an actor.

1411
01:21:18,236 --> 01:21:23,367
You gave one hell of a
performance without being one.

1412
01:21:24,876 --> 01:21:25,604
Very natural.

1413
01:21:25,744 --> 01:21:26,676
lt's great.

1414
01:21:28,914 --> 01:21:31,644
That we could clear
all this with honesty.

1415
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:35,108
Truth will prosper.

1416
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:39,155
''Come back to me, beloved.''

1417
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:44,361
''Come back to me, beloved.''

1418
01:21:44,629 --> 01:21:48,395
''Come back to me, beloved.''

1419
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:54,628
''l yearn.. for you.''

1420
01:22:04,116 --> 01:22:05,140
RP.

1421
01:22:06,618 --> 01:22:07,778
RP.

1422
01:22:08,987 --> 01:22:12,787
What RP RP! Can't you see
that l don't want to talk right now?

1423
01:22:16,595 --> 01:22:17,619
Ok, tell me, what is it?

1424
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,289
Take it.

1425
01:22:23,368 --> 01:22:24,357
For me?

1426
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:25,994
lt's got your name on it too.

1427
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,636
l have nevertold you this but
RP because of you today l feel light.

1428
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:36,339
l don't feel like
l'm a burden on earth.

1429
01:22:37,983 --> 01:22:39,917
l have found my calling.

1430
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:44,377
Actually,
l'm alive today, only because of you.

1431
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:47,588
Don't you think all
this is a repeat telecast?

1432
01:22:48,226 --> 01:22:49,887
l've said all this before?

1433
01:22:51,296 --> 01:22:54,231
When you were high on morphine.

1434
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:57,593
Make up with Chitra.

1435
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:01,800
Tell herthat her nemesis
Mandarwon't be in herway anymore.

1436
01:23:02,174 --> 01:23:02,833
What are you saying?

1437
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:03,703
Yes.

1438
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,206
You know the guy who plays Hanuman?

1439
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:07,107
He's got a double
bed in his single room.

1440
01:23:07,212 --> 01:23:09,373
l even finished packing up.

1441
01:23:09,681 --> 01:23:11,205
l used your suitcase though,
hope you don't mind.

1442
01:23:15,387 --> 01:23:17,651
l wish everyone finds
a friend like you.

1443
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:19,920
l'll be back.

1444
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:48,476
Mandar, Mandar!

1445
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:54,557
l have found Nandini.

1446
01:23:57,128 --> 01:23:58,720
Brilliant!

1447
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:00,895
Bombastic!

1448
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:04,663
Mind-blasting!

1449
01:24:05,637 --> 01:24:10,768
Yay! You found my Nandini!

1450
01:24:11,142 --> 01:24:17,012
RP where? Tell me, how is she?
Marriage? Marriage?

1451
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,110
No.

1452
01:24:19,384 --> 01:24:20,351
Have you seen her?

1453
01:24:20,452 --> 01:24:21,942
Yes, but from far.

1454
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:25,384
Now do you understand why
it was so hard to get over her?

1455
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,956
She's beautiful, even from a distance.

1456
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:28,854
Come on.

1457
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,483
Right away?

1458
01:24:29,594 --> 01:24:29,821
Yes.

1459
01:24:29,928 --> 01:24:30,724
Are you crazy?

1460
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:33,491
l just want to see where she lives.
That's all.

1461
01:24:37,903 --> 01:24:40,167
l can sense her vibrations.

1462
01:24:40,705 --> 01:24:41,933
vibes!

1463
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,099
Shall we move on now?

1464
01:24:43,408 --> 01:24:43,999
Yeah.

1465
01:24:45,477 --> 01:24:47,570
Parking is this way.

1466
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:48,703
Heaven is this way.

1467
01:24:48,813 --> 01:24:51,043
Stairway to Heaven is under
construction. Try and understand.

1468
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:53,049
Just one 'Hi'.
Then you can call an ambulance.

1469
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:54,516
My heart will be pumping
rose milk-shake by then.

1470
01:24:54,619 --> 01:24:57,554
Don't forget who you are now Mandar.
Ram. A leader!

1471
01:24:57,656 --> 01:24:59,954
Valiant! Milk-shake days are over!

1472
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:02,891
Fearless leader. Fearless leader.

1473
01:25:02,994 --> 01:25:03,858
Let me go now.

1474
01:25:03,962 --> 01:25:07,420
DO you really want to go there?
Remember she ditched you!

1475
01:25:09,134 --> 01:25:10,465
What should l do then?

1476
01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:12,430
Show some attitude dude.

1477
01:25:12,637 --> 01:25:13,604
Play hard to get.

1478
01:25:13,705 --> 01:25:15,172
Do something such that.

1479
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,500
she will come to you.
Stop being childish.

1480
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:25,781
Rose milk-shake..

1481
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:27,909
''The girl's hot.''

1482
01:25:28,086 --> 01:25:29,553
With ice-cream..

1483
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:32,655
''She's like tequila shot.''

1484
01:25:33,158 --> 01:25:36,184
''The heart's in trouble.''

1485
01:25:39,631 --> 01:25:41,064
What is he doing here?

1486
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:42,225
Do you know him?

1487
01:25:42,534 --> 01:25:43,831
No. Not at all

1488
01:25:44,135 --> 01:25:46,160
What is he doing with Nandini?

1489
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,902
Leave her alone you dog!

1490
01:25:50,008 --> 01:25:51,669
She doesn't love him.

1491
01:25:52,711 --> 01:25:57,546
What? l can't tell from here
whetherthat person is male orfemale.

1492
01:25:57,649 --> 01:26:00,447
..Then how do you know
that Nandini doesn't love him?

1493
01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:02,884
Profile test.

1494
01:26:03,855 --> 01:26:06,187
Profile test? Means?

1495
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:10,622
lt's Simple. lf she loved him then
she would have faced him straight.

1496
01:26:11,863 --> 01:26:13,990
Face to face..
but she is showing her profile..

1497
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:15,759
..Which can only
mean one thing no love!

1498
01:26:16,267 --> 01:26:17,700
lt's science.

1499
01:26:23,508 --> 01:26:24,270
Yes!

1500
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:29,204
Go back loser.

1501
01:26:29,714 --> 01:26:31,875
!Take your profile
and get it out of here.

1502
01:26:33,184 --> 01:26:35,209
You are my guru RP!

1503
01:26:36,054 --> 01:26:37,180
Loli.

1504
01:26:44,062 --> 01:26:49,694
No Profile. Nandini, profile!

1505
01:26:51,736 --> 01:26:52,930
Profile!

1506
01:26:53,038 --> 01:26:54,699
Mandar!

1507
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:16,755
This is forceful entry.
How can he do this?

1508
01:27:19,964 --> 01:27:21,659
That too forcefully.

1509
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,798
Let's call the police.

1510
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,102
That inspector is yourfriend right?

1511
01:27:29,941 --> 01:27:31,670
How much will he
charge for an encounter?

1512
01:27:36,848 --> 01:27:38,110
Why did you take me
there in the first place?

1513
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:41,879
Right, l dragged you there.

1514
01:27:43,288 --> 01:27:46,189
Then why did you
say that she is single?

1515
01:27:46,291 --> 01:27:48,953
l only said that she isn't married.

1516
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,960
She can invite whoever
she wants to her bedroom.

1517
01:27:51,129 --> 01:27:55,259
Why are you saying this?

1518
01:27:55,366 --> 01:27:58,597
l can see that image now!

1519
01:27:58,703 --> 01:27:59,727
Why did you have to say bedroom?

1520
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:02,363
How does the room matter at all?

1521
01:28:02,874 --> 01:28:04,341
lf it has to be done,
it can be done anywhere!

1522
01:28:05,043 --> 01:28:07,841
Hall, staircase.

1523
01:28:08,346 --> 01:28:10,337
On the kitchen shelf.

1524
01:28:10,615 --> 01:28:14,608
Bathroom,
in the shower, on the dining table.

1525
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,277
Terrace, underthe open sky.

1526
01:28:16,387 --> 01:28:19,220
Why are you increasing the images.

1527
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,816
lmages.

1528
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:27,789
Now jabbing your eyes won't help.

1529
01:28:28,933 --> 01:28:30,298
Fact is fact.

1530
01:28:30,935 --> 01:28:32,766
l think it's time that we.

1531
01:28:33,138 --> 01:28:35,902
l mean you accept it and move on.

1532
01:28:36,374 --> 01:28:39,605
lf you had feelings
for her like l do then.

1533
01:28:40,044 --> 01:28:44,378
Then probably l could understand
what you really felt right now.

1534
01:28:48,353 --> 01:28:50,617
l am leaving now.

1535
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:59,888
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''

1536
01:29:01,032 --> 01:29:06,368
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''

1537
01:29:07,372 --> 01:29:13,743
''Beloved, let go.
Don't pluck this bud.''

1538
01:29:14,179 --> 01:29:16,773
''You're my sweetheart.
You're so beautiful.''

1539
01:29:16,915 --> 01:29:19,406
You don't know how
l controlled myself.

1540
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:22,077
He is safe because l am a vegetarian.

1541
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,081
lf you hadn't been a pure vegetarian.

1542
01:29:24,189 --> 01:29:27,249
l would have made minced
meat of that RP the other day.

1543
01:29:27,759 --> 01:29:29,852
You don't know anything
about Ram..so refrain. Ok!

1544
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:33,725
This. Oh!

1545
01:29:34,132 --> 01:29:34,962
All the best.

1546
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:39,068
What do you know about him?

1547
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:41,031
He doesn't make me
feel like l am all alone.

1548
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:42,736
He taught me how to
get drenched in the sun.

1549
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:44,308
And bask in the rain.

1550
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:46,900
And when he holds me.

1551
01:29:47,779 --> 01:29:51,909
l just melt in his big, strong arms.

1552
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:55,377
..Cheel.

1553
01:29:56,387 --> 01:30:02,451
''You're my relief. You're my love.''

1554
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:07,164
''My life's connected with yours.''

1555
01:30:08,766 --> 01:30:14,898
''l've your vivid memories.
lt makes me breathless''

1556
01:30:15,006 --> 01:30:20,205
''lt makes my eyes wet.''

1557
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:26,011
''My heart says.''

1558
01:30:26,918 --> 01:30:32,151
''Don't every go away.''

1559
01:30:32,257 --> 01:30:37,388
''Let me touch your lips.''

1560
01:30:39,097 --> 01:30:45,969
''Let me dwell in your breath.''

1561
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,942
Bloody hell.

1562
01:30:57,949 --> 01:30:59,075
Absolute bloody hell.

1563
01:30:59,484 --> 01:31:02,715
''Beloved, let go.''

1564
01:31:02,954 --> 01:31:06,082
''Don't pluck this bud.''

1565
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:12,720
''You're my sweetheart.
You're so beautiful.''

1566
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:15,298
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''

1567
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,858
''lt's pounding. The heart's scared.''

1568
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:32,079
''Your spell's working.
lt's enthralling me.''

1569
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:36,016
''l'm losing my senses..''

1570
01:31:36,154 --> 01:31:37,644
You won't believe
what l did yesterday!

1571
01:31:37,855 --> 01:31:40,551
l climbed to her
balcony like Spider man.

1572
01:31:40,658 --> 01:31:42,819
Oh God! Who does that? So juvenile.

1573
01:31:43,027 --> 01:31:45,962
The point is that you
were absolutely right!

1574
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:47,154
Tea.

1575
01:31:47,565 --> 01:31:48,224
Me? About what?

1576
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:51,791
She doesn't love that baboon!

1577
01:31:52,837 --> 01:31:54,361
She was alone when l reached there.

1578
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,004
l just kept looking at her.

1579
01:31:56,107 --> 01:31:57,699
l was about to go in.

1580
01:31:58,176 --> 01:31:58,835
Then?

1581
01:31:59,177 --> 01:32:00,576
l remembered what
you told me yesterday.

1582
01:32:00,678 --> 01:32:01,235
What exactly?

1583
01:32:01,346 --> 01:32:04,213
She should miss me.

1584
01:32:05,383 --> 01:32:07,647
She must get impressed
with me somehow.

1585
01:32:09,087 --> 01:32:15,253
..l was thinking of a makeover,
new look, new hairstyle.

1586
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:19,762
What are you thinking of?

1587
01:32:19,864 --> 01:32:21,991
l am thinking how l should kidnap her.

1588
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,124
Kidnap, Your Majesty?

1589
01:32:23,768 --> 01:32:26,828
Yes! l will steal his love.

1590
01:32:27,338 --> 01:32:30,102
That will be worse than killing him!

1591
01:32:41,953 --> 01:32:44,387
RP, what is this?

1592
01:32:47,725 --> 01:32:48,589
RP!

1593
01:32:49,961 --> 01:32:51,019
RP. RP.

1594
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:52,889
You'll have to ring the bell.

1595
01:32:53,131 --> 01:32:54,120
Bell? - Yes.

1596
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:58,699
Doorbell. He's way too drunk right
now. l'll go find the replacement.

1597
01:32:58,803 --> 01:33:01,966
No no, he'll be fine. Rp, Rp?

1598
01:33:04,008 --> 01:33:05,407
Ding dong?

1599
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:06,875
Yes?

1600
01:33:07,412 --> 01:33:09,107
Oh. You. l don't want to buy anything.
Thank you.

1601
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,904
Hey stop all this.
Come on, we have to go.

1602
01:33:11,015 --> 01:33:13,813
No. l will not go. l will not go.

1603
01:33:13,918 --> 01:33:16,887
What is going on?
lt's time for ourwar

1604
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:19,885
You will fight me? Will you?

1605
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,152
Do you know everything now?

1606
01:33:21,426 --> 01:33:24,452
Yes, you have kidnapped my Sita,
so now there will have to be a war.

1607
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:27,690
Kidnapped? Me? No! l..only.. once.

1608
01:33:29,167 --> 01:33:31,727
Once? You'll have
to do it every night!

1609
01:33:32,036 --> 01:33:32,730
Every night?

1610
01:33:32,837 --> 01:33:33,599
Yes.

1611
01:33:33,704 --> 01:33:34,762
You're saying this.

1612
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:39,772
What has the world come to?
l want to hide from myself! Hide!

1613
01:33:39,877 --> 01:33:41,469
Rp! Ram!

1614
01:33:41,646 --> 01:33:43,409
l'm not Ram. l'm Raavan.

1615
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:47,418
l'm Raavan disguised as Ram.

1616
01:33:47,652 --> 01:33:50,212
Actually,
you're Ram disguised as Raavan.

1617
01:33:50,488 --> 01:33:53,548
And that's Seeta. My entry's
from the right wing. l'm going.

1618
01:33:53,658 --> 01:33:56,593
Ok ok, maybe there's no need
for an entry. Just lie down for a bit.

1619
01:33:56,694 --> 01:33:59,060
l want to tell everyone
how great you are.

1620
01:33:59,964 --> 01:34:01,898
And you're my bff.

1621
01:34:01,999 --> 01:34:05,662
l have kidnapped your Seeta.
l'm guilty!

1622
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:09,433
There's no need to feel guilty.
You drank a bit, it's fine.

1623
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,008
l'm not guilty about that.

1624
01:34:12,143 --> 01:34:15,010
How can l kidnap yourwife?

1625
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:19,107
How can l just take your girl man?

1626
01:34:21,486 --> 01:34:22,976
You're ok with kidnapping right?

1627
01:34:23,087 --> 01:34:24,179
l have no issues.

1628
01:34:24,722 --> 01:34:25,654
Let's go.

1629
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:38,731
Listen to me this one time,
go and meet Chitra.

1630
01:34:39,437 --> 01:34:40,426
l am going to the saloon.

1631
01:34:40,538 --> 01:34:42,005
Do you want more milk?

1632
01:34:42,507 --> 01:34:43,735
ln your coffee?

1633
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:46,905
Holy shit!

1634
01:34:47,545 --> 01:34:51,174
l used to be theirtarget before,
seems you are stealing my luck dude!

1635
01:35:00,525 --> 01:35:01,685
So what do you have in mind?

1636
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:04,522
l want to impress a special friend.

1637
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:07,861
Just make me sexy types.

1638
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:09,598
Ohkay. Sexy types!

1639
01:35:09,734 --> 01:35:11,861
How is the taste
of your special friend?

1640
01:35:13,471 --> 01:35:14,165
What?

1641
01:35:14,438 --> 01:35:16,133
How is her hairstyle?

1642
01:35:16,607 --> 01:35:19,075
Just like her. Beautiful.

1643
01:35:19,477 --> 01:35:21,104
Seems like the special
friend is truly special.

1644
01:35:21,212 --> 01:35:22,873
Soft.

1645
01:35:23,114 --> 01:35:25,639
Very soft hair.

1646
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:26,976
That's nice.

1647
01:35:27,852 --> 01:35:31,015
And they move like this,
like this, wavy.

1648
01:35:31,923 --> 01:35:34,824
Long. Sometimes she leaves it open.

1649
01:35:35,059 --> 01:35:39,428
And when they trouble herface.

1650
01:35:39,697 --> 01:35:42,928
She ties it up into a top bun.

1651
01:35:44,068 --> 01:35:45,626
And pushes a clip through it.

1652
01:35:46,737 --> 01:35:49,433
ls she a special friend to both?

1653
01:35:51,108 --> 01:35:52,735
l think l should leave.

1654
01:35:54,745 --> 01:35:57,077
Chitra, Chitra.

1655
01:35:57,548 --> 01:36:03,578
''You're my relief. You're my love.''

1656
01:36:03,721 --> 01:36:07,680
''My life's connected with yours.''

1657
01:36:09,794 --> 01:36:15,790
''l've your vivid memories.
lt makes me breathless''

1658
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,666
''lt makes my eyes wet.''

1659
01:36:20,071 --> 01:36:21,060
l want to talk to you.

1660
01:36:21,572 --> 01:36:22,470
Yeah?

1661
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:26,540
l agree that you are one
in a billion but me being me.

1662
01:36:26,877 --> 01:36:28,640
l tend to help everyone around me.

1663
01:36:28,813 --> 01:36:30,508
So why did you have
to misunderstand me?

1664
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:33,876
Alright?

1665
01:36:34,485 --> 01:36:35,076
Alright.

1666
01:36:35,186 --> 01:36:37,279
l know you are very beautiful.

1667
01:36:37,922 --> 01:36:39,583
But that doesn't mean l have
fallen head over heels for you.

1668
01:36:40,858 --> 01:36:42,018
Understand?

1669
01:36:42,493 --> 01:36:43,118
Yes l do.

1670
01:36:43,227 --> 01:36:44,888
Any guy would like to
spend his entire life with you.

1671
01:36:45,062 --> 01:36:46,552
Mornings, evenings,
nights, then mornings again.

1672
01:36:46,664 --> 01:36:48,598
But l am not one of them.

1673
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:49,993
l don't feel like that.

1674
01:36:51,068 --> 01:36:52,057
OK?

1675
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:53,760
OK.

1676
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:57,705
Ok. l have decided.
we won't meet from now on.

1677
01:37:01,045 --> 01:37:03,309
Then l guess you should
take this ring back.

1678
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:09,780
You had left it in my balcony.

1679
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,327
Enough of this drama.

1680
01:37:17,695 --> 01:37:23,964
''My heart says.''

1681
01:37:24,035 --> 01:37:29,530
''Don't every go away.''

1682
01:37:29,807 --> 01:37:34,972
''Let me touch your lips.''

1683
01:37:36,547 --> 01:37:42,918
''Let me dwell in your breath.''

1684
01:37:55,266 --> 01:38:01,262
''l'll die.
l will nevertolerate separation.''

1685
01:38:01,372 --> 01:38:05,138
''Forthe sake of love.''

1686
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:13,708
''l've your vivid memories.
lt makes me breathless''

1687
01:38:13,818 --> 01:38:17,948
''lt makes my eyes wet.''

1688
01:38:19,023 --> 01:38:24,859
''Let me touch your lips.''

1689
01:38:25,696 --> 01:38:30,998
''Let me dwell in your breath.''

1690
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:41,134
l want to ask you something?

1691
01:38:43,047 --> 01:38:44,810
But you have to promise
that you will tell me the truth.

1692
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:47,247
Pure and crystal clear. 100% truth

1693
01:38:48,619 --> 01:38:49,813
What do you think of me?

1694
01:38:51,389 --> 01:38:52,617
Physically?

1695
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:56,088
What do you think of my body?

1696
01:38:57,928 --> 01:38:58,952
Good.

1697
01:38:59,363 --> 01:39:00,421
Pretty good.

1698
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:05,800
l feel that l am not attractive.
She won't like me.

1699
01:39:06,804 --> 01:39:08,396
RP, RP, Tell me the truth.

1700
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,263
What?!

1701
01:39:10,207 --> 01:39:13,404
lf l work out for a few days,
visit the gym.

1702
01:39:13,778 --> 01:39:14,938
First l will tone my body like Salman.

1703
01:39:15,045 --> 01:39:17,639
And only then will l go and meet her.

1704
01:39:18,315 --> 01:39:21,113
l think its a good idea.

1705
01:39:23,954 --> 01:39:25,182
How much time will l require?

1706
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:28,123
To become Chulbul Pandey?

1707
01:39:28,325 --> 01:39:29,724
Eight, ten days?

1708
01:39:29,827 --> 01:39:31,852
No, more than that.
Maybe a month. Minimum.

1709
01:39:34,031 --> 01:39:35,123
One month?

1710
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:37,928
6 weeks for safety.

1711
01:39:43,974 --> 01:39:45,373
Where are you going?

1712
01:39:48,078 --> 01:39:50,069
You're my biggest well wisher.

1713
01:39:50,214 --> 01:39:53,115
if even you don't
have confidence in me?

1714
01:39:54,218 --> 01:39:56,277
You can't even meet my eyes.

1715
01:40:01,225 --> 01:40:02,692
Mandar.

1716
01:40:06,063 --> 01:40:07,553
Do you love her a lot?

1717
01:40:07,765 --> 01:40:08,925
More than myself.

1718
01:40:10,334 --> 01:40:12,825
Then my valiant leader.

1719
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:15,663
Meet hertoday at 4pm.

1720
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,305
l am sure her heart will
turn into rose milkshake.

1721
01:40:17,908 --> 01:40:18,966
Good god!

1722
01:40:19,844 --> 01:40:22,005
Go get her a gift.

1723
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:25,245
And wear something smart.

1724
01:40:26,784 --> 01:40:28,684
l'll become like Salman by 4pm?

1725
01:40:42,299 --> 01:40:45,166
''Are you my sky?''

1726
01:40:45,269 --> 01:40:46,201
Hello. Nandini?

1727
01:40:46,303 --> 01:40:48,931
''Or are you my God?''

1728
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:51,940
''Everywhere l look.''

1729
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:55,273
''lt's just you.''

1730
01:40:55,379 --> 01:41:01,648
''Not just my world.
But, l've lost my life too.''

1731
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:05,587
''You're my faith.''

1732
01:41:05,689 --> 01:41:09,056
''lt's just you.''

1733
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:23,736
''Delicate dreams.
That's what this closeness was.''

1734
01:41:23,841 --> 01:41:27,140
''They just shattered.''

1735
01:41:30,414 --> 01:41:37,183
''Leaves in the sun.
Like the candle flame.''

1736
01:41:37,288 --> 01:41:43,124
''l kept burning. And just faded.''

1737
01:41:43,294 --> 01:41:49,290
''Are you my sky? Or are you my God?''

1738
01:41:49,967 --> 01:41:56,304
''Everywhere l look. lt's just you.''

1739
01:41:56,407 --> 01:42:02,869
''Not just my world.
But, l've lost my life too.''

1740
01:42:03,747 --> 01:42:10,243
''You're my faith. lt's just you.''

1741
01:42:22,866 --> 01:42:24,595
Are these tears for me?

1742
01:42:28,405 --> 01:42:29,872
That's ok.

1743
01:42:31,642 --> 01:42:33,940
RP l met Nandini as you said.

1744
01:42:35,379 --> 01:42:35,970
Really.

1745
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:36,669
Yes.

1746
01:42:37,047 --> 01:42:41,814
And l think Nandini and me.
All thanks to you.

1747
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:43,415
All thanks to me?

1748
01:42:43,687 --> 01:42:47,418
Yes.A miracle. l reached
there and Nandini had broken up!

1749
01:42:47,825 --> 01:42:49,816
Who breaks up on the phone?

1750
01:42:49,994 --> 01:42:53,088
l think that douchebag
crossed all his limits.

1751
01:42:54,632 --> 01:42:56,156
Was she alright?

1752
01:42:56,266 --> 01:42:58,029
She had collapsed completely.

1753
01:42:59,336 --> 01:43:00,325
Really?

1754
01:43:01,205 --> 01:43:03,264
l have never seen anyone
cry so much in their life.

1755
01:43:07,344 --> 01:43:08,242
Then what happened?

1756
01:43:08,345 --> 01:43:11,007
We spoke quite a bit and
then l even tried that position.

1757
01:43:11,115 --> 01:43:11,809
Position?

1758
01:43:11,915 --> 01:43:12,643
That love position!

1759
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:13,648
Love position!

1760
01:43:13,851 --> 01:43:14,875
Profile test.

1761
01:43:14,985 --> 01:43:18,921
She didn't show me her profile
even once. lt's science. She loves me.

1762
01:43:19,823 --> 01:43:20,949
Did she say that?

1763
01:43:21,425 --> 01:43:24,656
Not yet.

1764
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:28,061
Here she is.

1765
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:29,655
My Nandini.

1766
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,864
l am screwed!

1767
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:31,968
Why did you call her here?

1768
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:33,866
To introduce you two. Come!

1769
01:44:12,276 --> 01:44:14,744
Come on.

1770
01:44:18,048 --> 01:44:21,575
RP, this is my friend Nandini.

1771
01:44:21,852 --> 01:44:24,616
Nandini this is RP, my guardian angel.

1772

Hi.

1773
01:44:27,024 --> 01:44:28,048
Hi.

1774
01:44:28,525 --> 01:44:29,992
RP found you.

1775
01:44:30,094 --> 01:44:32,289
Just for me.

1776
01:44:32,763 --> 01:44:35,527
Oh so all this wasn't
just a coincidence.

1777
01:44:35,666 --> 01:44:39,329

1782
01:44:52,116 --> 01:44:53,606

Enjoy the show.

1784
01:44:58,655 --> 01:45:00,145
lt's the best seat.

1785
01:45:00,357 --> 01:45:03,884
You can see everything
clearly from there.

1786
01:45:04,595 --> 01:45:07,155
l wish l had seen
everything clearly before.

1787
01:45:22,379 --> 01:45:24,472
''My dreams were shattered.''

1788
01:45:24,748 --> 01:45:25,442
What happened?

1789
01:45:25,716 --> 01:45:28,344
l don't know.Go see, find out.

1790
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,347
Nandini!

1791
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:37,457
Nandini!

1792
01:45:37,861 --> 01:45:38,520
Nandini What is it?

1793
01:45:38,796 --> 01:45:41,026
Did l say something wrong?

1794
01:45:41,265 --> 01:45:46,897
''Just one faith, one love.
You're that one for me.''

1795
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:53,100
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''

1796
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:59,547
''Just one faith, one love.
You're that one for me.''

1797
01:46:01,852 --> 01:46:08,348
''The heart's so naive. lt
thinks the heart's its destination.''

1798
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:14,988
''Now, loneliness is my companion.''

1799
01:46:20,237 --> 01:46:21,568
''The heart's so naive. lt
thinks the heart's its destination.''

1800
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:25,070
Seete! lt is impossible for
you to free yourself from my clutches!

1801
01:46:25,342 --> 01:46:28,800
You are caught in my web now!

1802
01:46:29,012 --> 01:46:32,846
''Now, loneliness is my companion.''

1803
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:39,180
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''

1804
01:46:39,289 --> 01:46:40,847
Mandar!

1805
01:46:44,261 --> 01:46:45,353
Mandar!

1806
01:46:45,462 --> 01:46:50,957
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''

1807
01:46:51,068 --> 01:46:51,898
Mandar!

1808
01:46:52,002 --> 01:46:58,373
''Fall in love once.
Fall deeply in love just once.''

1809
01:47:04,181 --> 01:47:08,311
You nit-wit,
pumpkin head, stinky shoe..

1810
01:47:09,353 --> 01:47:14,882
..damp sock!

1811
01:47:18,362 --> 01:47:22,458
Hey! My car!
What are you doing to my car?

1812
01:47:25,402 --> 01:47:28,997
Whoops, it's not RP's. Sorry!

1813
01:47:29,172 --> 01:47:30,867
There's been a little scratch on it.

1814
01:47:31,041 --> 01:47:33,874
l'll show you what a scratch
is you idiot!Wait there!

1815
01:47:47,157 --> 01:47:49,648
So, this was my 3 month long Dramayan.

1816
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,091
What happened to Mandar?

1817
01:47:51,561 --> 01:47:53,654
He changed his contact details.

1818
01:47:54,031 --> 01:47:57,626
His ajji told me he doesn't
want to stay in touch with me.

1819
01:47:58,001 --> 01:47:59,764
And your show?

1820
01:48:01,004 --> 01:48:04,235
Must go on.
Chandra sir has found a new Ram.

1821
01:48:05,242 --> 01:48:07,176
Nandini?

1822
01:48:09,947 --> 01:48:14,213
ln these 3 months yourfiancee,
your love, and your.

1823
01:48:14,318 --> 01:48:14,977
Bff.

1824
01:48:15,085 --> 01:48:18,179
Right. Bff. You broke up with all 3?

1825
01:48:20,057 --> 01:48:22,355
And became a real life Raavan.

1826
01:48:24,027 --> 01:48:25,756
You know,
these 3 will neverforgive me.

1827
01:48:28,031 --> 01:48:29,225
Sorry.

1828
01:48:29,933 --> 01:48:31,867
Hey? Prescribe some medicines?
Any advice?

1829
01:48:32,135 --> 01:48:35,298
Say sorry. Ask forgiveness
from them whenever you meet them.

1830
01:48:35,806 --> 01:48:37,239
And before that,
apologize to yourself..

1831
01:48:37,674 --> 01:48:39,369
Learn to meet your own eyes.

1832
01:48:41,178 --> 01:48:43,942
Sometimes in life, a sorry is enough.

1833
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:54,254
Hey RP Police arrested
our Hanuman yesterday.

1834
01:48:54,391 --> 01:48:55,050
What?!

1835
01:48:55,225 --> 01:48:55,987
Yes.

1836
01:48:56,093 --> 01:48:58,084
He forgot to take off his costume,
and rode his bike.

1837
01:48:58,628 --> 01:49:00,095
People at the signal were freaked out.

1838
01:49:00,197 --> 01:49:01,630
And you are telling me this now?

1839
01:49:01,798 --> 01:49:02,389
How are we going
to perform without him?

1840
01:49:02,966 --> 01:49:04,194
Don't worry RP.

1841
01:49:04,301 --> 01:49:07,134
l have already asked one
of our actors to stand in for him.

1842
01:49:07,637 --> 01:49:08,228
Who?

1843
01:49:08,372 --> 01:49:09,031
So? All set?

1844
01:49:09,139 --> 01:49:12,131
Thank you Chandra Sir. l had
a bit of a fever, but l am fine now.

1845
01:49:12,242 --> 01:49:13,971
Good to have you back!

1846
01:49:14,077 --> 01:49:15,169
Hi.

1847
01:49:15,278 --> 01:49:18,270
l need to get ready.
Will be right back.

1848
01:49:24,021 --> 01:49:26,854
Mandar l wanted to do something
else and it turned out to,

1849
01:49:26,957 --> 01:49:28,015
be something different altogether.

1850
01:49:28,992 --> 01:49:30,084
lt.it just happened.

1851
01:49:31,361 --> 01:49:32,988
My intentions were quite clean.

1852
01:49:33,764 --> 01:49:35,664
l'm sorry,
l know l hurt you in the process, but

1853
01:49:37,034 --> 01:49:41,767
l also fell in love,
and l'm not sorry forthat.

1854
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:46,107
But it's good,
it's good that you've come back.

1855
01:49:47,044 --> 01:49:48,409
And we're talking about
it like civil,mature individuals.

1856
01:49:48,678 --> 01:49:50,976
The time to talk has passed.
it's time for some action.

1857
01:49:52,716 --> 01:49:54,946
Do you know why l
love theatre so much?

1858
01:49:55,318 --> 01:49:57,843
lt's so unpredictable!

1859
01:49:59,156 --> 01:50:01,818
Anything can happen to anyone.

1860
01:50:04,194 --> 01:50:05,354
At anytime!

1861
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:09,298
So take care.

1862
01:50:10,801 --> 01:50:12,769
Brother.

1863
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:18,193
Long live Sri Ram!

1864
01:51:28,745 --> 01:51:31,873
Seete! lt is impossible for
you to free yourself from my clutches!

1865
01:51:32,115 --> 01:51:33,514
You.

1866
01:51:36,553 --> 01:51:37,577
You?

1867
01:51:38,755 --> 01:51:39,949
You.

1868
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,899
You are completely under my control.

1869
01:51:56,773 --> 01:51:59,139
You are caught in my web.

1870
01:51:59,242 --> 01:52:03,736
l agree. You posed
as a saint and came to me.

1871
01:52:04,681 --> 01:52:06,979
You made me cross my boundary.

1872
01:52:07,884 --> 01:52:09,078
You kidnapped me!

1873
01:52:09,186 --> 01:52:11,211
l didn't intend to
put you in this situation.

1874
01:52:11,588 --> 01:52:15,684
What kind of a man are you? Aren't
you ashamed to cover your guilt?

1875
01:52:15,859 --> 01:52:17,918
lt is entirely yourfault!

1876
01:52:22,732 --> 01:52:24,461
lt's Ram's fault.

1877
01:52:25,702 --> 01:52:26,669
Vikas?

1878
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:32,773
Your Ram crossed the line first.

1879
01:52:33,043 --> 01:52:36,069
He neverthought about
the consequences of his actions.

1880
01:52:38,181 --> 01:52:40,911
He is your real culprit.

1881
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:44,880
He isn't worthy of you Nandini.
Forget him!

1882
01:52:46,289 --> 01:52:48,257
Do you think he will
be able to forget me?

1883
01:52:50,827 --> 01:52:51,885
Never.

1884
01:52:52,295 --> 01:52:55,025
And your mere memory will
serve as a punishment for him.

1885
01:52:56,666 --> 01:53:02,263
Every moment away from
you will be a torture for him.

1886
01:53:03,173 --> 01:53:06,108
l just received a symbol of
Lord Ram's affection from Hanuman.

1887
01:53:11,314 --> 01:53:12,781
What do you think?

1888
01:53:14,818 --> 01:53:16,877
You are the only one
capable of laying a trap.

1889
01:53:21,191 --> 01:53:26,686
l don't see a trap anywhere.
You are still alone.

1890
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,027
l am never alone.

1891
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,533
He is always here.

1892
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:35,699
ln front of me.

1893
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:40,605
lt seems you know Ram
betterthan he knows himself.

1894
01:53:41,011 --> 01:53:42,535
l know this much.

1895
01:53:42,646 --> 01:53:44,910
That Lord Ram cannot watch
people in pain and distress.

1896
01:53:45,248 --> 01:53:48,615
He always strives to make them happy.

1897
01:53:49,019 --> 01:53:51,988
He wishes only the best forthem.

1898
01:53:52,255 --> 01:53:55,713
That is what l love most about him.

1899
01:53:56,026 --> 01:54:01,157
l know that whateverthe distance
between us, l will never be alone.

1900
01:54:01,631 --> 01:54:04,896
And he will never
be complete without me.

1901
01:54:07,804 --> 01:54:11,934
Our love story will
be remembered forever.

1902
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:18,206
''Are you my sky? Or are you my God?''

1903
01:54:19,182 --> 01:54:23,278
''Everywhere l look. lt's just you.''

1904
01:54:25,955 --> 01:54:29,322
l saw this last week,
wasn't this different?

1905
01:54:30,927 --> 01:54:33,361
Seems that these two are doing
their real life drama on stage.

1906
01:54:34,097 --> 01:54:36,292
This is an international conspiracy!

1907
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:38,924
This is Made in China Ramayan!

1908
01:54:45,742 --> 01:54:49,838
l nevertold you this,
but l love you so much.

1909
01:54:50,347 --> 01:54:52,372
And l love my Ram.

1910
01:54:56,319 --> 01:54:58,412
Did you hearthat?

1911
01:54:58,788 --> 01:55:01,951
l can hear nothing
but your heartbeats.

1912
01:55:02,659 --> 01:55:05,127
Corny! You have become
quite the drama queen!

1913
01:55:05,228 --> 01:55:11,690
''My heart says.''

1914
01:55:11,801 --> 01:55:17,103
''Don't every go away.''

1915
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,897
''Life is give and take.''

1916
01:55:48,104 --> 01:55:50,095
''Everyone's got their own problem.''

1917
01:55:52,175 --> 01:55:56,043
''Give it a hard push, and just sorry.''

1918
01:55:56,212 --> 01:55:57,372
''Learn to adjust, bro.''

1919
01:55:58,047 --> 01:56:01,744
''Peter, Repeater.
Everyone's a cheater.''

1920
01:56:01,818 --> 01:56:05,049
''Everyone's wearing a mask.''

1921
01:56:06,122 --> 01:56:09,819
''The one that takes mercy,
shows affection.''

1922
01:56:09,893 --> 01:56:13,385
''ls always in at the receiving end.''

1923
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:21,601
''You're such a dramebaaz, l am a
dramebaaz. Everyone is a dramebaaz.''

1924
01:56:21,805 --> 01:56:30,235
''You're such a dramebaaz, l am a
dramebaaz. Everyone is a dramebaaz.''

1925
01:56:30,747 --> 01:56:34,683
''At times getting intoxicated here.
At times getting intoxicated there.''

1926
01:56:34,751 --> 01:56:38,312
''Everywhere intoxicated.
Life is tipsy. Please take care.''

1927
01:56:38,388 --> 01:56:45,419
''Be it earrings or lipstick.
Amazing necklace.''

1928
01:56:46,229 --> 01:56:53,692
''But once the beauty wore,
the poor loverwas finished.''

1929
01:56:54,204 --> 01:57:02,111
''You're such a dramebaaz, l am
a dramebaaz. Everyone is a dramebaaz.''

1930
01:57:02,178 --> 01:57:10,779
''You're such a dramebaaz, l am
a dramebaaz. Everyone is a dramebaaz.''

1931
01:57:26,703 --> 01:57:34,371
''You're such a dramebaaz, l am
a dramebaaz. Everyone is a dramebaaz.''

1932
01:57:34,744 --> 01:57:42,708
''You're such a dramebaaz, l am
a dramebaaz. Everyone is a dramebaaz.''

1933
01:57:45,455 --> 01:57:48,083
''Life is give and take.''

1934
01:57:49,392 --> 01:57:52,225
''Everyone's got their own problem.''

1935
01:57:53,496 --> 01:57:58,126
''Give it a hard push, and just sorry.''

1936
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:02,338
''And just sorry.''

1937
01:58:05,174 --> 01:58:06,436
''Dramebaaz.''

1938
01:58:16,452 --> 01:58:22,084
''My heart beats fast. lt's afraid.''

1939
01:58:23,092 --> 01:58:28,530
''My heart beats fast. lt's afraid.''

1940
01:58:29,799 --> 01:58:36,204
''Beloved, leave my hand.
Savourthe ripe youth.''

1941
01:58:36,272 --> 01:58:42,472
''You are my beloved
or my sweetheart.''

1942
01:58:42,912 --> 01:58:45,745
''My heart beats fast.
- My heart beats fast.''

1943
01:58:45,815 --> 01:58:48,978
''lt's afraid.''

1944
01:58:49,452 --> 01:58:55,789
''Your spell has been
cast all over my body.''

1945
01:58:56,092 --> 01:59:01,997
''l have forgotten myself and
have dwelled you in my breaths.''

1946
01:59:02,532 --> 01:59:07,993
''Now this bond will never break.''

1947
01:59:09,205 --> 01:59:14,837
''Hearts have united. l feel shy of you.''

1948
01:59:15,878 --> 01:59:21,282
''My heart beats fast. lt's afraid.''

1949
01:59:22,418 --> 01:59:28,015
''Hearts have united.
Why to feel shy of you?''
