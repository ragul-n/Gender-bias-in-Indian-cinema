1
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,440
We can see the drones.
They look like birds.

2
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,480
The drones are circling this area
24 hours a day.

3
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,080
Two or three at the time. There are always
two. Most days three or four.

4
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
When the kids, or I, hear the drones,
we get scared.

5
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,760
We can neither work,
play or go to school.

6
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,200
When the weather is cloudy,
they don't show up.

7
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:43,200
The organization ‘FOUNDATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS’
brought an action against the CIA use of drones in 2010.

34

Some people from the village were
digging a new grave next to his.

35
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,680
I was upset by the thought,
of what could have happened.

36
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,800
Was someone in my family dead?
I didn't know who it was.

Everyone shouted and screamed.

41
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,720
My mother were outside, sorting
vegetables, when she was hit.

42
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,040
The children were struck
when the second missile hit.

43
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,960
A fragment of the missile
got stuck in my leg.

44
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,560
I was brought to the hospital.

45
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,680
It was not before coming
home from the hospital -

46
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,080
- that I was told
that my grandmother had been killed.

47
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,000
It was a horrible day.
It felt apocalyptic.

48
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,360
I often contemplate, why they
would kill us innocent people.

49
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,800
Everything is different now. We can't go to school
and we can't play outdoors anymore.

A lot of people have
become mentally ill -

67
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,120
- because of attacks on town meetings,
shops and schools.

68
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,480
There is no place, where
a drone attack has not happened.

69
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,160
The drone attack of august 2010
was horrendous.

70
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,120
On the ground, scattered,
were children.

71
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,760
Their parents ... They were
still lying there the morning after.

72
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,600
I will never forget that sight.

73
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,160
Three children survived.

74
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,520
The pressure waves from the drone strike
threw them out to the side.

75
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,760
The worst thing about the attack was
that the kids recognized their brothers.

76
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,680
They said: "That's my brother,
and that's my brother."

77
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,000
Here, the kids couldn't recognize -

78
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,440
- their mother and father -

79
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,480
- because these stumps is all -

80
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,160
- what was left of their parents.

81
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,000
They couldn't understand
that their parents were killed.

82
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,800
They started to cry and shouted:
"I want my mum and dad!"

83
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,560
Every night when I fall asleep
I can hear the children scream
