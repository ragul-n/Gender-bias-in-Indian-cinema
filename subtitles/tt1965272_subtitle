1
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,065
Smoking and drinking
are injurious to health

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,937
All the characters and
the incidents in this film are fictitious

3
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,386
VIJAY

4
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,075
Pakistan -Afghanistan border

5
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,600
You damn English man!

6
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,736
You've to accept our demands

7
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,007
...or else we will have to
kill them one by one

8
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,278
You have made our men to suffer very much

9
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,566
Ulaganathan! Tamil Nadu Home minister!

10
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,373
Do you know why you have been called here?

11
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,203
To spoil the peace of Indian citizens

12
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,380
To spoil the peace of Indian citizens

13
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,848
We've done enough bombings in...

14
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:09,251
...Delhi and Bombay in the North
to threaten the nation

15
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,849
Our next target to show our
full strength in bombing in South...

16
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,590
...is Chennai, the most important city,
where nobody can expect

17
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:24,261
I know it! You have brought me here
as I am the right person to do all this

18
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:31,139
I'm sure you can't find a nasty guy
like me in the whole Tamil Nadu

19
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,347
Nilagiri is full of Ganja estates!

20
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,543
In 4 factories they do
the adulteration work

21
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,151
By eliminating the former home minister

22
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,818
...I became the home minister

23
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,954
it'll be our rule next year

24
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,831
As you have said,
I want my bank balance of 5 billions

25
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,766
...to become 50 billions

26
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,567
Tell me what should I do for that

27
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:07,237
There should be bomb blasts
simultaneously in Chennai at various places

28
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:12,512
The entire India should tremble from fear
seeing the end of Chennai caused by us

29
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:17,522
That's it! We'll change
Tamil Nadu into a graveyard!

30
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,455
Holy war...!

31
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,533
CHENNAI

32
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,531
Jasmine flowers is 10 rupees per yard

33
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,938
SANTHANAM
SARANYA MOHAN

34
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,942
- Be careful!
- Okay!

35
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,209
Give me a kiss

36
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,761
Sir! Brother shines well
in acting, isn't it?

37
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,197
The Home Minister Ulaganathan rushed
to the site where the tragedy occurred

38
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,231
I feel very happy to see that
You have done a great job

39
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:20,904
Though it is a new kind of work,
they've done it the right way

40
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,776
This is only the beginning

41
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,372
We have to do a lot of work now on

42
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,315
We can make it grand brother

43
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,990
The terrorist attacks
were only in the North India till now

44
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,581
The attacks have spread in Tamil Nadu too

45
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,786
What are you looking there?
Look here

46
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,724
These were taken on the spot,
at close distance!

47
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,597
If shown these the dailies
will rush up after these!

48
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,000
- What Bharathi?
- Ls it for this Ragav

49
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,471
...we are working freelance
after throwing our jobs?

50
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,737
Until he boarded the flight her father
was compelling her to go with him

51
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,678
...saying that he would get her
a job in New York times

52
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,904
Didn't you see that today morning?

53
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,779
We've ignored all that, We should do
good with journalism

54
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,750
instead you give this more importance

55
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,354
What do you say?
This too is journalism!

56
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,720
Do you want to publish
these photographs just as news?

57
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,520
Instead of just satisfying the readers

58
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,721
...we must attempt to offer a solution
to those affected in the problem

59
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,162
That's the success of the journalists!

60
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,235
We will prove that in our maiden project

61
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,722
This is a place not reached
by any media till now

62
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,261
We have to be very careful

63
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,685
- Keep the money and take material
- Ok brother

64
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,032
Drive them all out of here

65
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:31,770
Take her away! Come
Lift her away

66
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,913
Please leave me
My marriage is on the next month

67
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,984
Please leave me

68
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,115
- What are you looking at?
- Come, show it well

69
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,227
How's the item compared to the last one?

70
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,059
Why not? Bring those girls here

71
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:55,898
Where do you hide?
Sait, look at them

72
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,533
- How's she?
- The girl is good looking!

73
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,537
- The media people have entered
- Ls it the press media?

74
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,642
Not even their corpses should go out

75
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,880
Come Bharathi

76
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,995
Start the vehicle

77
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,093
Let us not go together

78
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,033
Show the Sky TV people what we shot

79
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,106
Hari and I will go
to the nearby police station

80
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,572
2 boys and a girl...

81
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,476
- Any identification...?
- I think they are press people

82
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,619
Tell me Bharathi

83
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,456
They have come to the police station
You have to be careful

84
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,967
- Oh God! They have come here
- You come out with the tape

85
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,195
Don't get caught

86
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,202
- Have you come out?
- I am on the way

87
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,875
We will be waiting near the roundabout

88
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm scared Go fast

89
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,623
No, don't do that

90
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,724
it is his bike!

91
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:39,903
Bharathi, wait

92
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:47,569
Raghav has left us!
Bharathi, they've come... Come

93
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,217
- Come
- I can't

94
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,626
We have made a mistake

95
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,699
We tried to extinguish thinking it was fire

96
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,268
But they seem like a volcano

97
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:15,864
They can be confronted only in imagination

98
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:20,071
Go away! Don't get caught
by them and get destroyed

99
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,895
You are always in search of news

100
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,127
We can give you a superb news than this!

101
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,634
The day before yesterday
a bomb blasted in Gandhi Nagar

102
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:49,164
- We only had kept it there
- This is only the beginning

103
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,368
Another bomb will explode next Friday

104
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,173
There will be several blasts after that

105
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,239
You are dashed us without knowing about us
and who else are behind us

106
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,247
They are all big shots!

107
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:08,285
Go straight upwards and telecast
through satellite what has happened here

108
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,366
Throw away that burnt corpse also
There should not be any evidence at all

109
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,084
Another bomb will explode next Friday!

110
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,855
Then, there will be several blasts
in a row in Chennai

111
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,327
ls the news enough for you?

112
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:23,899
They can be confronted only in imagination

113
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:29,067
The news that I got now,
I won't leave it as a news matter

114
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,811
Warning!

115
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,915
I've killed the 3 people
who've killed the innocent people

116
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,922
...who blasted the bomb yesterday

117
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:50,825
I know that they will
blast a bomb on coming Friday

118
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,688
I will stop that too

119
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,596
As a weapon against the injustice forever...

120
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,118
VELAYUDHAM

121
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,606
Warning!

122
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,439
I've killed these 3 people
who've killed the innocent people

123
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,877
...by blasting the bomb yesterday

124
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,482
I know that they will
blast a bomb on coming Friday

125
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,678
I will stop that too VELAYUDHAM

126
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:53,217
A brave man has come to destroy those
who are doing atrocity

127
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,025
I have started the big work trusting you

128
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,531
Where did you do the mistake?

129
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,660
No one knows this matter
except those 4 guys

130
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,671
I don't know how he has written that

131
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,234
What is our next plan?

132
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,741
I am not afraid of the government
I won't get scared for this guy

133
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,343
Plant the bomb as per the plan

134
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,514
I'll see who comes to stop that

135
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,635
I can use sickle not only to
kill people but to reserve a seat too

136
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,227
Are you booking the seat?
You have booked the seat well

137
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,273
You sinner!

138
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,787
- Sister!
- Brother!

139
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,619
Come dear!

140
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,952
I have put the sickle in your seat
go and sit there

141
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,364
Dear!

142
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,766
If I touch her hand
my mood will get changed

143
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,772
I'll cover my hand

144
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,611
- I didn't touch you, did I?
- Why do you dash against me?

145
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,942
I am your fiancee Who else can touch you?

146
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,112
It is not enough that you alone feel it

147
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,322
it should be felt here also

148
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,983
Then you feel it clearly now

149
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,091
Go and sit there Go

150
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,618
- Move aside
- Come uncle

151
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,561
I won't touch the hand that
refused to touch my daughter

152
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,292
I am honest

153
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,460
Come aunty

154
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,897
Here, we are coming

155
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,163
Should I formally invite you?

156
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,929
- You come, give your hand
- Who is he?

157
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,371
Next?

158
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,068
Who are you?
You are not in the list

159
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,708
Are you teasing a Ticket checker?

160
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,438
I know Chinese Checker What are you?

161
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,444
It is me Why did you stop the train?

162
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,179
Why would we pull the chain
if you stop the train in our village?

163
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,449
You have stopped the train, isn't it?
Then give me penalty and ticket amount

164
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,180
- Money!?
- Don't you have money?

165
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,348
Then get down

166
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,859
How dare you ask him to get down?

167
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,395
Do you know who he is?

168
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,393
- Who is he?
- He is our king

169
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,524
- What?
- He is the lion of this village

170
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,793
He rules this village and our hearts

171
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,371
And he will rule this...

172
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,171
I am stopping because you said so

173
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,502
Even if he is the ruler...

174
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,473
...he can cross this village
only if he gets the ticket from me

175
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,070
Why should you talk to him?
Spread this towel

176
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,506
Put the money here

177
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,017
Come on

178
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,820
Take it Start the train

179
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,190
Beat the drums

180
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,257
Oh God!

181
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,266
The whole village has come to see him off

182
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,460
Is he a big man?

183
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,005
They are seeing him off
to get rid of his torture

184
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,733
What? Are they sending him out
from the village?

185
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:37,748
Yes! They were scared that he would
get down from the train for some reasons

186
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,417
What has he done?

187
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,053
Give me your hand I'll tell you

188
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,720
Beautiful village

189
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,086
Peace loving people

190
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,554
He didn't allow them to be like that

191
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,762
Valli, don't run

192
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,838
Valli, stop there

193
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:10,643
Opposition party people who compete against
me in the Elections need not hit with votes...

194
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:11,948
Oh God!

195
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,012
- Someone hit you with the red-brick
- This plot is planned by opposite party

196
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,418
Thank God! I support ruling party

197
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,954
Will you give me water or not?

198
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,957
You crazy! You don't allow me watching the TV

199
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,119
You wait and see
Someday I am going to break the TV

200
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,362
Oh God!

201
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,267
- A male voice in the bathroom!
- Lt is my fiance!

202
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,503
That's it Be obedient to him

203
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,941
Are you my uncle or...?

204
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,108
I am living with dignity
even if it is for 5 minutes

205
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,775
I've come to catch the hen

206
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,315
Dear! it's caught
come and catch it

207
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,717
- You move aside
- I'll move, come

208
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,024
You will move, isn't it?

209
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,724
- You will move, isn't it?
- Come

210
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,954
Catch me

211
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,464
You made me miss the chance
to catch that hen

212
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,136
There is no one at home
Prepare chicken curry

213
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,001
After eating that...

214
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,338
Only you are talking...

215
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,071
You have come when I am thinking about you

216
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,309
My time is good today

217
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,420
- Sorry brother! I missed the hen
- But my meat is dead here

218
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,554
Catch it

219
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,692
Sister!

220
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,632
Who is he?
Why is he hiding like this?

221
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,862
- He is my guest
- Ls this hospitality?

222
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,702
Why are you coming out from my home?

223
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,704
Where have you gone?

224
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,432
This lamp was not working I made it correct

225
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,870
Have you done it knowingly or unknowingly?

226
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,639
- I did knowingly
- Then take it inside

227
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,509
Krishna!

228
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,666
- What are you doing in
the poultry farm? - Valli!

229
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,711
Have you done all this for a hen?

230
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,875
No, for my sister

231
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,451
- For his sister!?
- Yes!

232
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,022
His sister has brought up the hen as pet

233
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,054
Did you get it?

234
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,156
I got it

235
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,163
Why are you getting shocked for this?

236
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,167
If brother and sister join together
it is not only danger for village

237
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,170
...but it will be a danger for the well also

238
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,069
I have given the milk to society

239
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,078
I have deposited the money
in the finance company

240
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,445
Why are you pouring the water on the floor?

241
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,586
Leave it man
if I tell, you won't believe that

242
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,916
First you tell me

243
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,413
There is gold in the well

244
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,286
- Really?
- I swear on my sister

245
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,762
There is gold in our well

246
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,433
- Velu is telling by swearing on
his sister - ls there gold in our well?

247
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:20,968
Come fast

248
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,306
Velu is very kind

249
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,673
Without keeping with him
He is sharing with whole village

250
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,308
Our seniors named our village as Pavunur
by knowing it is fountain of the gold

251
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,881
You are pouring milk to whole village

252
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,247
You shouldn't draw out the plain water

253
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,557
You go, we will take care of it

254
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,085
Don't talk Draw out the water quickly

255
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,792
Hey, it is gold Gold is glittering

256
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,458
Move aside See there

257
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,363
it is not gold
that is his bald-head

258
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,599
- Fool! Take him
- My dhoti

259
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,639
Hit him

260
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,305
Stop it

261
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,806
You crazy! Don't you feel ashamed?

262
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,949
If you do like this
When will you draw out the entire water?

263
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,519
Use pump set and draw the water

264
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,188
Come, let's catch the gold
before it goes somewhere

265
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,052
You too catch it

266
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,884
if you catch like this, how can we?
Catch it correctly

267
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,060
First you cover your bod
I'll take care of the gold

268
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,699
Don't break my head

269
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,737
I got it

270
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,375
Did you get the gold?
Where?

271
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,247
I got the sister's ring

272
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,229
You made me call the whole village
for this 200 Rupees ring

273
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,162
...and fooled the entire village!

274
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,359
This is my sentiment ring

275
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,367
This was the first thing that
my brother bought for me

276
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,868
I am really impressed by the
way you called whole village

277
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,544
Be prosperous!

278
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:14,047
Because of that beating, he returned
home only after 2 days in the dark

279
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,552
I haven't seen such a brother and
sister affection even in 'Pasa Malar'movie

280
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,048
Well said

281
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,789
Do you know what happened when they
went to watch the 'Pasa Malar' movie?

282
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,093
Brother!

283
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,127
What dear?

284
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,779
Take care of my sister

285
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,741
I should see happy tears only in her eyes

286
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,080
This scene is very touching!

287
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,079
I want to watch the scene once more

288
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,247
- Hey operator!
- Tell me

289
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,221
Play this scene once more

290
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,084
How can we watch the scene again and again?

291
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:02,064
Hey priest! Didn't you see
that porno movie 6 times?

292
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,132
Keep quiet and watch it

293
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,759
How can we watch the scene again and again?

294
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,766
Who is he?

295
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,436
That day you were stretching your leg
in this theatre and poking at...

296
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,776
Don't you feel ashamed?

297
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,744
Speak with respect I am Arbiter

298
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,972
You should've have thought
before doing that poking

299
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,049
Hey operator!

300
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,510
My sister wants to watch that scene
Play that scene

301
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,587
Take care of my sister

302
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,787
I should see happy tears only in her eyes

303
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,140
I am giving this entire reel to you

304
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,800
Please don't come to this theatre again

305
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,812
Oh God! He tortured you too much

306
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,345
Was there no one to admonish him?

307
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,145
The day also came for that

308
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:59,423
The lion of our village is going to
participate in the running race

309
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:03,153
He only gets the first prize every year

310
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,230
We should save our dignity
Somehow you must win

311
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,356
- That's it!
- Why do you talk like this?

312
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,491
I will save my village name

313
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,968
I will rock the competition

314
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:17,371
This year Vepampatti Mani is
going to take part in the competition

315
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,102
He will be a tough competitor for Velu

316
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,770
- So the competition will be a tough one
- How is it?

317
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,912
- First prize is teak wood cot and the cup...
- Come on! See this cot

318
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,455
if my fiance wins the first prize,
I'll kiss him publicly

319
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:35,253
- I will celebrate my wedding night in this
- Will you do it publicly?

320
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,157
I will kill you How dare you?

321
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,922
You are talking about kiss...
Will you kiss him on cheek?

322
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,091
No, I meant lip to lip

323
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,801
- Come, let's move
- Smart girl! She will excel!

324
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,006
- You are her dad, isn't it?
- No, I am uncle!

325
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,204
I am uncle for Velu

326
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,606
- You are uncle for only Velu,
or the entire world? - Get lost!

327
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,340
- Competition is going to start
- Velu!

328
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:07,222
Our village competitor Velu
is rocking the race

329
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:17,763
First prize teak wood cot
and second prize is bureau with mirror

330
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,167
Third prize is grinder

331
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,900
Fourth prize is big vessel
Fifth prize is small vessel

332
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,507
Our Velu who is going to win...

333
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,103
Brother, I want second prize bureau only

334
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,650
Yes, I am sure!

335
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,588
What is it?
He is running backwards

336
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,055
He is rewinding the race

337
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,857
- Velu, move forward
- Dear, go forward

338
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,465
Why did you do like this?
It will be a shame for our village

339
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,730
Every year my brother runs
and gets first prizes for our village

340
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,270
Let him run and win the prize for my sake

341
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,676
- Move fast!
- You have some plan

342
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,336
You...! Run fast

343
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,746
Thank you, brother!

344
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,879
Brother, you are in 4th place

345
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,350
Run fast to 2nd place

346
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,291
Go fast!

347
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,030
You lost the first prize cot

348
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:26,427
Velu, we couldn't endure your mischief

349
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:32,238
if you repeat this, you might embarrass
our village in the forthcoming festival too

350
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:36,302
So, you both are banned from the festival

351
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,779
This is my judgment too

352
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:44,987
Arbitrator, please... don't change
the judgment

353
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,381
Didn't they come for the festival?

354
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,724
It is a big story

355
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,463
Why didn't you start the dance yet?

356
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,468
We are waiting for our Velu

357
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,342
We came here to enjoy your dance show

358
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,673
Come on, start the performance

359
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,213
You came to see our dance

360
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,078
But we came here to see Velu's dance

361
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,810
So, won't the festival start
until Velu comes?

362
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,545
We can celebrate the festival

363
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,416
But if Velu does not come,
the festival will be boring

364
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,490
Everyone can dance well

365
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,025
if Velu comes,
it will be a stunning performance

366
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,487
I know how to call our Velu
for festival celebration

367
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,895
Keep the loud speaker in south direction

368
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,831
The earth is trembling and
the sky is thundering...

369
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:39,238
We are the gold medalist in
Chennai Sangamam dance academy

370
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,836
We are the traditional dancers
from Karaikudi...

371
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:49,045
...Welcome you all to give
a stunning performance

372
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:53,853
Our anklets are dancing like water...

373
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,654
Drums are ready to rock the stage...

374
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,561
...Come and rock the stage

375
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:05,693
Welcome our rock star...

376
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,700
Pipes and drums are waiting
for your performance...

377
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,644
Folk dance group from Thirunelveli...

378
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:20,844
Come and dance like windstorm...

379
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:26,847
We are ready to rock the stage
with a folk song...

380
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:32,361
Come to rock the stage
with your outstanding dance...

381
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,303
Words are not enough to express...

382
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:52,713
...the affection you shower on me

383
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:02,150
Words are not enough to express...

384
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,354
...the affection you shower on me

385
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:11,698
We aren't siblings
Yet I love you all dearly

386
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,929
This mesmerising girl attracts
everyone with her charm

387
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,066
Here comes your lover to scoop you

388
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,572
My name is Velayudham
my fingers are like the spear

389
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:28,448
My rapid leg dancing can outwit a sting

390
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,115
Words are not enough to express...

391
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,353
...the affection you shower on me

392
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:43,833
We aren't siblings
Yet I love you all dearly

393
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,996
This mesmerising girl attracts
everyone with her charm

394
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:51,132
Here comes your lover to scoop you

395
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,936
You climbed over me and atop the palm tree

396
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,505
...brought down toddy
and tasting without me

397
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,552
I do dance with heavy flower pot on head

398
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,685
But don't hold arrogance

399
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,856
I do folk and western dances

400
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,129
But don't make wrong advances

401
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,227
I do the act of tiger disguise

402
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,502
But I don't despise others

403
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,771
Am an expert fighter and boxer

404
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,041
But I don't misuse my guts

405
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,117
This mesmerising girl attracts
everyone with her charm

406
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,949
Here comes your lover to scoop you

407
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:59,201
The people who work hard in the fields
are my only supporters

408
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:05,640
I can do any thing to make them happy

409
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:11,978
I am grateful to everyone
who support and enjoy my show

410
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,314
I am your blue-eyed boy
Love me dearly

411
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,480
I long for your support always

412
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,649
This mesmerising girl attracts
everyone with her charm

413
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,490
Here comes your lover to scoop you

414
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,168
My name is Velayudham
my fingers are like the spear

415
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,261
My rapid leg dancing can outwit a sting

416
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,111
He has participated in the running race
and dance competition only for his sister

417
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,544
Why is he going to Chennai?

418
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,548
This is also for sake of his sister

419
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:57,090
You don't feel bad about
your brother after your marriage

420
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,423
Don't worry! I will take care of him

421
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,225
- Don't feel too much!
- No use even I feel for him

422
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,690
Careful!

423
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,299
What brother?

424
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,646
What is it, brother?

425
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,243
You have been worrying that
you haven't seen our mother's face

426
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,179
Look there!

427
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,870
Do you like the girl?

428
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,700
We've inquired about your family
to the villagers

429
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:51,747
Sister, we are caught
Let us search some other groom

430
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,216
Nobody told anything bad about you

431
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,284
Not blamed us?

432
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,015
How can we blame you?

433
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,959
You played pranks on us

434
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,894
But we couldn't see affectionate
sibs like you

435
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,825
Yes! Your parents passed away
when you were 8 years old

436
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,702
We know how you suffered and brought her up

437
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,975
You are a good example for our children

438
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,778
if you are ready, we will
perform the marriage in a grand way

439
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,649
Yes, it is our pleasure
to get such an alliance

440
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,449
if your parents are alive,
they will perform the marriage

441
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,050
But the entire village will get together
and perform this marriage

442
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,652
Don't worry about finance

443
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:45,469
I've deposited money in the finance company
for my sister's marriage

444
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,132
I got notice from the head office, in Chennai
to come and get back the money

445
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,341
That's why we're going
to Chennai with family

446
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,937
We've to do the purchase for marriage

447
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,017
- Come on!
- What's the problem?

448
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:04,349
I have been watching him so far
My sister is sitting in the seat...

449
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,218
- He is sitting opposite to her
- I got it!

450
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:12,695
- How dare you?
- How dare you ogle at her...?

451
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,962
Don't worry, Velu!
I've sent him to the 4th compartment

452
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,560
Did he ogle at our sister?

453
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,469
No, he didn't ogle But he may do that

454
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,102
- He may ogle...
- Move aside!

455
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,838
I locked him in the restroom

456
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,779
Idiot! I will beat you to pulp

457
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,907
- Dear, come here!
- What happened?

458
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,317
He is ogling at me!
Ask him why is he doing like this?

459
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,779
Did you ogle at her?

460
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,516
If you like her,
I will perform your marriage

461
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,923
No, I want a homely and silent girl

462
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,325
Go to graveyard,
you will get a girl to marry there

463
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,730
Nobody asks for a modest girl to marry

464
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,801
We get trouble in life
But he is a big torture

465
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:54,871
Have it dear!

466
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,879
Thank you for your affection We have food

467
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:05,812
What dinner?

468
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,077
My sister has prepared food
for us with affection

469
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,152
Sister's preparation?

470
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,086
- Come, let's jump out
- Don't jump out! You'll get injure

471
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,953
if we have your sister's preparation,
we will die

472
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,754
Yes, it will be little tasteless

473
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,422
I can eat more

474
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,557
But I couldn't taste
your sister's preparation

475
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,694
Yes, last time I gave your
sister's preparation to a dog

476
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,829
- Gave to the dog!?
- That is not important!

477
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,770
I've seen a man or woman vomiting

478
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,173
But first time I saw a dog vomiting that day

479
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,507
Please, don't compel us

480
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,310
You know I didn't listen when you
pleaded worse than this last time

481
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,511
So you must eat my sister's preparation
even if it is tasteless

482
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,316
- I should dine with a smiling face,
isn't it? - Of course

483
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:50,861
I can't put a Oscar winning performance
after eating your sister's preparation

484
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,985
Please, leave me

485
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,723
- Move fast!
- You won't leave me

486
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,389
- Don't escape!
- Brother, no!

487
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,925
- Have it!
- Oh God!

488
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,527
Enough!

489
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,331
Smile please!

490
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,203
It is my fate to have this food,
to perform your marriage

491
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,673
- Dad, I can't eat!
- Of course, me too

492
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,876
Your fiance is having the food
So you should eat this for him

493
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:15,815
Crazy girl!

494
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,547
I can consume even poison to marry him

495
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:18,815
But I couldn't eat this

496
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,148
Is it tasty?

497
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,689
How is it, brother?

498
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,023
You are an expert in cooking

499
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,357
We are the scapegoat

500
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,763
it will be better, if you had prepared
the tamarind rice without pulpy

501
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,301
Brother! This is not tamarind rice!

502
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,595
This is roasted rava (Rice flour) mix

503
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,832
- Roasted rava?
- Too bad!

504
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,103
You shouldn't mix tamarind in rice flour

505
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,906
Leave it! Is it tasty?

506
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,038
- Yes, very tasty and delicious
- See, how he tells a lie

507
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,447
Why don't you have it?

508
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,385
I don't like to have my preparation
even it is very tasty

509
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,219
My brother bought me Biriyani (meat rice)
in the last station

510
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,525
- When did you do that?
- I did it stealthily

511
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,728
- Dear!
- Have it

512
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,727
Why do you look very dull?

513
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:09,534
If I get married,
who will provide you a tasty food?

514
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,200
On that belief, still I am living

515
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,308
Why don't you understand that?

516
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:18,407
If the brother is a temple,
sister is a lamp!

517
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,677
- Sir, I am hungry!
- A beggar has come to save us

518
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,013
Let's give our food to him

519
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,549
- Uncle, what's happening?
- Offering food to beggars is virtuous

520
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:30,958
- Come on, give it!
- No, I won't give! it's very tasty

521
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,155
- Yes, I know that
- Have it!

522
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:39,635
Nobody offered me this much food
You will be prosperous

523
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,967
I will not forget you until I am alive

524
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,596
You'll show your gratitude
only if you are alive

525
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,607
Don't worry! I have one more box

526
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,648
I became a beggar thinking it is not risky

527
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,516
But this is too risky Move aside

528
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,590
Sister! You want to wash your hands
Come let's go

529
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,086
She didn't eat, but going to wash her hands

530
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,423
There are many ways to kill someone

531
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,291
But why did you give this food to kill me?

532
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,697
Come with me, I'll serve you
a tasty food in next compartment

533
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,359
He said he will serve a tasty food
Come let's go

534
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,837
it seems the beggar has praised
a lot about her preparation

535
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,434
if he had died, we would've
been arrested on murder charges

536
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,808
FRIDAY MORNING
Due to Velayudham's forewarning...

537
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,816
...that bombs will blast today
the city life has got affected highly

538
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:33,982
Temples, parks and beaches
seen normally with crowds are empty

539
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:38,191
Colleges and schools have
been declared a holiday

540
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,855
Our livelihood is affected for the day

541
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,101
- Will bombs explode today?
- No one knows anything

542
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,693
- Bombs should be present
- What are you saying?

543
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,330
Yes mom, bombs should be present
Velayudham should remove it

544
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,565
Then only those who planted bombs
would get scared of him totally

545
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,134
All the press people are here

546
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,644
For one bomb blast
they criticised us thoroughly

547
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,577
Did you take any steps
to sort out this problem?

548
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,880
I've given orders to tighten
the security in all corners of the city

549
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,057
I taught our profession
to all our 3 sons similarly

550
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,528
These 2 people work hard to steal
and increase our wealth

551
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,728
Our family got popularity
to stick wanted posts on us

552
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,738
But that 3rd son
hasn't come in a bit notice

553
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,205
BEWARE OF THIEVES

554
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,277
What do you lack?
You look like a king (Raja)

555
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,403
Definitely you'll rob millions of money

556
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,718
He is very alert

557
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,416
I've to throw this stealing bag
on my father's face

558
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,792
You always scold me that
I come empty handed

559
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,023
What will you tell today?

560
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,064
Truly this is an empty hand

561
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:58,707
People need not to be afraid
that bomb will blast today

562
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:03,678
Security has been tightened
everywhere in the city

563
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,376
Public are scared whether the bomb
will be blasted or not...

564
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,784
and they are waiting eagerly
for that Velayudham to come to remove it

565
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,722
- Brother! I forgot my bag in the train
- What is this, dear?

566
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,902
Uncle! You go and sit there with the luggage
I'll go and bring the bag

567
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,501
You go with them

568
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,977
Remove the bangles fast Biscuit works well

569
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,075
Sir! What are you doing here?

570
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,244
We are waking up the passengers
who are sleeping here

571
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,185
You seem like stealing
and not waking them up

572
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,315
You don't know who we are Leave the place

573
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,859
See! You too don't know who I am

574
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,191
Who are you man?
Are you a ****?

575
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,595
Come on, show me

576
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,999
I go fortussles quite normally
But you're insisting me now

577
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,662
Come on do it man

578
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,870
Go bash him

579
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,346
Come quietly Let's escape

580
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,353
- Biscuit!?
- No

581
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,351
At this age...

582
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,520
What is going on there?

583
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,497
Please come sir
They only gave intoxicated biscuits

584
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,298
- I'll take care, take them
- Thank you dear

585
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,334
Be careful
Hey! it is my bag

586
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,532
Oh god! He has seen me

587
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,679
You did such a great job Tell me your name

588
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:25,517
- Vel... Velayudham
- Velayudham!?

589
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,092
Hey yellow shirt

590
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,188
Move aside

591
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:36,990
How did he get the bike?

592
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,762
Velayudham is going there Catch him

593
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:42,097
Thought I'll catch him and get promoted
but he makes me run like anything

594
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,975
How will you come through this way on bike?

595
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,794
As told earlier, Velayudham saved all of us

596
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,899
Did I run like an Olympic race
for a snack pack?

597
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,981
I can tackle anything with our brilliance

598
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:26,913
Run fast

599
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,413
Your snacks bag is here Come here

600
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,311
Where is he?
Has he escaped?

601
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,821
Will that thief go walking?
He has escaped already

602
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,185
Thank you very much
to save my bag and return it to me

603
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,886
Why do you chase so hard
for just a snack pack?

604
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,524
If there were samosa(edibles),
would you chase in helicopter?

605
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,829
As you think, this is not just a snacks bag

606
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,836
it contains 1 .5 million rupees

607
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,706
1 .5 million rupees!?
What are you saying?

608
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:55,108
I deposited 1.5 million rupees in chit fund
company for my sister's marriage

609
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,042
it's receipt is in this bag

610
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,709
I've to get that money
That's why I came to Chennai

611
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,548
- Anyhow I've to fool him and get that money
- Okay, I am leaving

612
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,054
if you go in your way
where can I come and search you?

613
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:06,952
For what?

614
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,249
Tomorrow you are going to
withdraw 1.5 million rupees

615
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,955
Chennai is not a calm place
as you think, it is full of thieves

616
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,290
Why are you looking at me?
Chennai is on that side, look there

617
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,533
it's okay! I've come with my family

618
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,765
Tomorrow I'll get the money
and leave this city

619
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,741
I am too telling the same
Stay with me until tomorrow

620
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,903
After getting the money
you can leave the city

621
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,946
- Don't compel me...
- Okay, go

622
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,545
I saved your bag and returned it to you
Still you don't believe me

623
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,982
Why are you looking at my face?
Won't you stay with me?

624
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,553
Okay, go crossing my dead body

625
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,212
- Okay, we'll stay with you
- Ls it?

626
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,485
What!? Bomb?

627
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,886
- In the station?
- Has the bomb got blasted?

628
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,693
How many people have died, leader?

629
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,097
Thank God! No one is dead
Velayudham saved all of them

630
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:55,900
if he hadn't done that
we would've lost our portfolios

631
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,970
- Did they catch Velayudham?
- They lost him

632
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,874
More important than that, we've to find
the culprits who planted the bombs

633
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,345
- Hurry up
- Okay leader

634
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:09,312
Having killed 3 rowdies who caused
for innocents' deaths

635
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,650
...in the recent bomb blast and
as written in his letter

636
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,953
...Velayudham, removed the next bomb
that was planted by the terrorists

637
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,584
...and saved many peoples lives

638
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,729
The bike was next to us

639
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:25,358
Velayudham took that far off and
saved us from danger

640
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,205
Though he was with us
we couldn't see his face

641
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,936
May God bless him

642
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,874
I only saw Velayudham in person

643
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,310
He went on that bike when I was there

644
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,309
Sir! Any militant group took
the responsibility for this bomb blast?

645
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,415
We are investigating

646
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,486
We got freedom for
our nation at midnight...

647
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,551
The super hero that Tamil Nadu
got at midnight is Velayudham

648
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,399
My grandpa has his two wives problem

649
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:57,895
He wishes to sell that house

650
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,435
Now you stay there Later I'll sell that

651
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,798
Why do you roll down
like coming out from cow's womb?

652
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,268
- How much it is?
- Rs 250

653
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,367
You've home as a guest
You shouldn't spend money

654
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,036
Better you could hit me with your slippers

655
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,239
You are insulting me

656
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,579
Why do you talk so deep for this?
You pay him

657
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,846
Look! All this money is for you

658
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,245
Please come in it is my grandma's house

659
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,482
it seems a big house

660
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,990
- First I've to see the toilet
- Dear! Shall we both stay in that room?

661
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,617
I'll kick you Go away

662
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:29,358
- I can't stay in this house
- What happened?

663
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,196
- We too can't stay here
- I am too

664
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,792
Will any human being stay here?
Ls this a house?

665
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,668
Is it Amazon forest?
It's a house, there are windows and doors

666
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,742
- There is no entertainment here
- Wastrels want entertainment

667
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,607
- Go pack your luggage
- Wait sir

668
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:43,709
Keep quiet, uncle

669
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,147
Whatever you tell they'll find faults

670
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,980
You don't worry
We'll go and find some other house

671
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,621
Go, go crossing my dead body

672
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,514
Why do you do like this often as in movies?

673
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,957
Then what? You made me pleasure
that you'll stay in my house

674
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,325
But if you leave suddenly I'll get tensed

675
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,796
When I see the actions you do...

676
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,026
...you remind me of
Bajanlal Sait of our village

677
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:08,229
- Assume me as him
- Still...

678
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,966
Don't bother about money
it'll go today and come tomorrow

679
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,306
- Won't you get your money
from chit fund tomorrow? - Yes

680
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,968
You go and take rest

681
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,873
You go! I'll take care of them
Tell me! What do you want?

682
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,214
This purse was full of money then
Now they've made it empty

683
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,514
Shall I ask you something?

684
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,317
My fiance doesn't mind me at all

685
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,154
He should circle me always

686
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,455
- Give me an idea for that
- Isn't he coming close to you?

687
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,862
You look like a idol made of butter

688
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:41,199
Your father is with black complexion,
a nose like broken chair...

689
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:46,173
...mouth like a cave and
face like demolished bungalow

690
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,073
if you're like him then he can avoid you

691
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,612
What is this background music?

692
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,014
He feels like dwarf Kamal in
'Appoorva Sahodargal' film

693
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,948
He is hearing us secretly
and walking on knees

694
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,917
Get up and go

695
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,833
Greetings bhai!

696
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,010
Sir! Your partner is coming

697
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,243
Don't let my partner know about this

698
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,113
Load it fast Close the door

699
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,717
Come and look here

700
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,659
it doesn't look like fake notes
it is perfect

701
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,097
Using my power I brought this till here

702
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,171
Using your business talent
try to make it double

703
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:53,633
King Dhasaratha used this seed mixer
to make love with his 62 thousand wives

704
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,572
I asked you to guard him
but not to smell this

705
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,443
You may drink it Go away

706
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,516
- Don't get angry, brother
- Take this - Give me

707
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,983
Go make him drink this milk

708
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,849
Then everything will happen as per the plan

709
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:09,423
- Dear! You are stuck with me today
- Dear! - What dad?

710
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,855
Is she going to hit the sixer now?

711
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,628
If you have self-respect,
you should commit suicide in this hall

712
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,097
...when I was mixing
that powder with milk

713
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,038
I am scolding you but you are smiling
as you got some award

714
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,502
- Do you have another powder pocket?
- For what?

715
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,272
Go man

716
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,177

718
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,289
Something is happening to me

00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,293
Why are you sleeping beside me?

720
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,769
You don't let me sleep
near you in real life

721
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,337
Can't I sleep near you even in the dreams?

722
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,202
- Dreams!?
- Yes dear!

723
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,740
No, there is no dream

724
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,512
Why do you lay your hands on me?

725
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,221
- I am telling you, this is a dream
- Nothing like that

726
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:18,551

727
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,300
Oh God! She makes me feel aroused!

728
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,717

Your limbs resemble the mace
You cut sly glance with your eyes

731
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,226
When you come close my blood oozes

732
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:06,708
Let the Sun vanish from the day
Let the nights alone stay

733
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:13,147
Let try new games with your mush
Do to me whatever you wish

734

Come to stick in my lipstick

746
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,115
Oh sharp warrior Come game with me

747

No need to marry Just make merry

You get both of us undressed

749
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:47,025
You do odd things I get wild dreams

750
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,540
You've mesmerised this man
with your black magic

751
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,706
You're the village belle
and also the town chick

752
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,910
Your limbs resemble the mace
You cut sly glance with your eyes

753
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,045
When you come close my blood oozes

754
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:12,493
Let the Sun vanish from the day
Let the nights alone stay

755
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:18,898
Let try new games with your mush
Do to me whatever you wish

756
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,084
Is this also part of a dream?

757
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,755
- No - Yes dear!
- Trust Velu

758
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:48,924
This is a dream

759
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,330
I am also sleeping in the next room

760
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,868
But I am coming from the fridge
reading a news paper

761
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,369
You are cheating me

762
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,836
Your girl is very near to you

763
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,966
Are you going to give the judgment
using that bowl?

764
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,048
I am not hurt it is a dream

765
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,645
Did I give the bowl to hit my face?

766
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:20,588
I wrote a name to make fear
in wrongdoers heart

767
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:26,363
But you've sent a real man
to eliminate that offenders

768
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,865
Who is that Velayudham?

769
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,536
I don't know
whether I could believe it or not

770
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,573
Listen Muruga! I won't change
my words now and then

771
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,475
I always stand on my words

772
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,842
My Katchi(party) should win

773
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,641
You mean what katchi?
It is my Thangatchi(Sister)

774
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,412
Her life should be happy

775
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:47,145
- The money that I saved for her...
- There is a new plan to steal it

776
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,689
Respected manager Mr. Udayappan

777
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:52,590
Because my legs got broken
unexpectedly in a mishap

778
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:57,223
I request you to give my chit amount
Rs 1 .5 millions to this Speed

779
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,598
...who brings this letter
and be a honorable person

780
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,933
With regards Velu

781
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,166
Today your legs will break

782
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,668
Don't worry, everyone use you
for the digestion the food

783
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,578
But I'll use you to become a rich person

784
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,354
it is said fruit slips into the milk
Is it that one?

785
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,060
Leave me

786
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,025
Few guys come to the temple for this!

787
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,534
Stop there

788
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,369
He is patting her back
like patting a bread fell in the soil

789
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,207
What are you doing?

790
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,939
Saffron coloured on your back
that's why I patted it

791
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,344
Will you pat if it is there?

792
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,780
You and I only know
that my hand touched there

793
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,284
But if you go out with that color design
the whole place will know

794
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,985
I'll kill you Go away

795
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,216
You are the best in everything

796
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:04,223
Sir! I wish to make
a programme about Velayudham

797
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,433
There are many good and
bad people who are related to this channel

798
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,563
Be careful

799
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,635
What will you do after
withdrawing the money?

800
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,679
I've to buy jewels, sarees, cot and
bureau for my sister

801
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,338
Before that I've to steal that money

802
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,516
I meant you withdraw money
from there, sit down

803
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:33,827
if a boy sits on your lap
you would have made a fuss here

804
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,990
See! How gentle boys behave!
Look before you sit

805
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:38,999
Now sit

806
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,338
it is said to look before you sit

807
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,271
- May I help you?
- Don't remove

808
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:53,680
it will hurt me if remove it myself slowly

809
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:58,019
Sir! This is ours
Keep it here and go

810
01:00:58,254 --> 01:00:59,221
I can't bear your sincerity

811
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,790
I am not stealing it
I myself will remove it and give you

812
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,891
- Sir! Your cheque is ready
- Give it to me

813
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,332
- For what purpose you have come here?
- Lt is my sister's marriage

814
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,231
I've come to withdraw the money
that I saved on her name

815
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,701
- Wait for some time
- Okay

816
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,900
Brother! Nowadays even parents think
that girl children are problematic

817
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,238
Are there lovable people
like you these days?

818
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,839
- You!? - I deposited Rs 0.2 millions
in my daughter's name

819
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,506
- Is it for her marriage?
- I saved it for her marriage...

820
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,049
But now I am not withdrawing for that

821
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,708
My daughter is admitted
to the hospital in Chennai

822
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,854
Doctors said that she would be alive
only if the operation is done

823
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,345
- Sorry sir
- It's okay, brother

824
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:35,724
Whatever happens...

825
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:40,194
I'll be glad if her operation
succeeds and she recovers soon

826
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,730
- Everything will be alright
- Thanks brother

827
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,424
Sir! MD is calling you

828
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,863
Okay brother! Come tomorrow
and get your cheque

829
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,536
Sir! I've to buy many things
for the marriage

830
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,940
I'll be glad if I get it by cash

831
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:56,672
Okay, do one thing

832
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,839
- You come on Monday
I'll give you cash - Okay

833
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,391
it will be blasted sharp at 12:30PM

834
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,798
Why did you wear dhoti today?

835
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,231
- Please welcome
- Greetings sir!

836
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,864
I am very glad that you've come to my shop

837
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,096
- He only brought us here
- Ls it?

838
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,640
He is taking care of us well
in this Chennai

839
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:27,508
Nandry (thank you) brother

840
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,770
This is our country (Nation)
we don't need that Nandry

841
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,871
Why is he laughing like that
for a foolish joke?

842
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,443
Don't bother for money

843
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:36,040
Let it be any cost buy whatever you wish

844
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:37,418
What Annachi?

845
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,249
You came here with
the yellow bag from your native

846
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,585
Now your shops' bag is in every house

847
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,149
When people go to buy household things
they take your bag along with them

848
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:48,661
Which actress are you going to book
for your shop's Ad this year?

849
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,896
I know everything it is a magnificent smile

850
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,840
- Why are you standing here?
- They are not allowing us to go inside

851
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,773
People who buy sarees for their paramours
and house maids, go that side

852
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,742
People who buy sarees for
their sister only should sit here

853
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:04,369
Why are you sending them away?

854
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,210
He'll do a bigger purchase than all of them

855
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,813
- Is it nice?
- I don't like this colour

856
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,913
- This colour is good, brother
- Yes, it's okay

857
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,582
Uncle! I selected this sari for Cauvery
How is it?

858
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,820
Doesn't matter who selects
it will always look pretty on her

859
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,488
- How much does it cost?
- You ask her

860
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,934
Are you a bigwig?
Don't you feel ashamed?

861
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,435
Dear! Come here

862
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,998
- Why did you call me?
- Come inside - I won't come

863
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,476
First time I wore churidhar
I want to show it to you, come in

864
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,843
- Come outside and show me

01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,615
- Come in dear

866
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,952
- Look at me dear!

867
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,693
What happened to you, Velu?

868
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,892
Isn't it the girl you patted
on her back in the temple?

869
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,868
Yes, Today I saw her front without shirt

870
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,239
Henceforth you can't tell
that you've not seen her properly

871
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:08,067
- Don't you feel ashamed?
- No, it is very nice

872
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,612
That day you patted on my back,
today you came to the dressing room

873
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,605
- I did it by mistake! - I don't leave you
I'll call the cops and teach you a lesson

874
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,116
What mistake have I done?
Then look at my chest to avenge me

875
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,487
- Look at this carefully
- Crazy guy!

876
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:25,153
Ls what you saw and
what she saw now the same?

877
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:28,396
I haven't ever seen a hero like you
to avenge like this

878
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,159
You took revenge very well

879
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,861
- Shall I make bill for everything?
- Okay, do it

880

890
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,933
Brother! Someone kept that box there
but forgot to take

891
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,207
- Who is it?
- That specs worn guy

892
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,550

01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,297
- Suitcase!? - Someone forgot it

01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,267
- You are right
- Give it to me, I'll handover it to the guy

897
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,964
Sir! You forgot your suitcase

898
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,918
What sir? What do you want sir?

899
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,256
- Allow me to go in
- I can't do that

900
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:10,730
The guy who went inside
from that car forgot this suitcase

901
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,199
- What is your name sir?
- Velayudham

902
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,871
- What happened?
- Okay, it'll be blasted in 10 seconds

903
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,276
Sir! Somebody asked me
to give this suitcase to you

904
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,109
- Who is it?
- Velayudham

905
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,611
Velayudham!? Come on, run

906
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,360
Sir! Here someone is breathing his last

907
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,696
How did this happen?

908
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,632
- Come on, tell me
- Velayudham!?

909
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,970
- There is some sensational news
- What is it sir?

910
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:02,778
With the bomb, Velayudham blasted
the godown that housed fake notes

911
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,147
Velayudham!?

912
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:19,063
Sir! The guy who saw Velayudham
is alive in the hospital

913
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,766
He is in critical condition

914
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,865
We couldn't get any information from him

915
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,646
His name is Velu
I told you that I met him in the Chit Fund

916
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:36,748
- Is it marriage for your sister?
- Yes, in 10 days

917
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,484
I don't know
whether I'll be alive or not till then

918
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:39,815
Don't tell like that

919
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:43,688
The pains that your father takes
to save you won't go futile

920
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:49,294
Did you see Velayudham?
How does he look like?

921
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:54,834
Come on, tell me! Who is he?

922
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,865
Come on, tell me! Who is he?

923
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:15,551
Damn it! He shows me Lord Murugan
instead of Velayudham

924
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:22,556
The world has born for me
Brother! Give me a strong tea

925
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,067
Why did you sit on my lap?
Go sit on my head

926
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,868
- I can't sit there, brother
- Get down

927
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,740
Wherever see it is written
about Velayudham will save!

928
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,473
- It is not about Palani Velayudham
- Raise volume

929
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:41,138
it's about the Velayudham, who recently
destroyed the fake notes along with rowdies

930
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,411
We don't know what will
happen the next moment

931
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,680
But he came at correct time
and saved our life

932
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:49,019
- He is the real hero
- He is the real man

933
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,286
- A special song for you...
- Brother!

934
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,156
My name is also Velayudham

935
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,162
Is it you Velayudham?
You've trembled when you see a dog

936
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,165
Everyone will mock at you,
if you say you are Velayudham

937
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,165
Move away!

938
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,495
Speed, when did you come?

939
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,508
I came when he was abusing you

940
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,977

See there! We came to grab
Rs 150 millions worth diamonds

01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,785
I am in a electrician's disguise

01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:32,327
I will cut the laser light connection
to stop the security alarm sound

969
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,988
I am in housekeeping's disguise

970
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:36,724
I'll be ready with jeep waiting outside

971
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,322

972
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,662
Who will take the diamonds then?

973
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,130
Oh God! Son, I didn't think about that

974
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,069
- Who will do that?
- Don't worry!

975
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:47,006
Whoever kept the diamonds there
they will take it back with him

976
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,543
Son, why don't you steal that and give it?

977
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:55,015
- Why don't you do this help for us?
- I will do only sorcery to you

978
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:58,348
Didn't you abuse me as useless?

979
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,684
If I help you, will you praise me?

980
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,085
I felt like being slapped by slippers
at your questions

981
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,423
Yes, you are right he was
slapping you with slippers

982
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,621
Don't feel for that! I'll help you

983
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:09,629
Clear the place

984
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,292
- Dad, time up!
- Open it!

985
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,564
Why did you bring time bomb
in the public place?

986
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,434
This is not bomb,
He brought lunch for us from home

987
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:20,365
We will have food in lunch time
and do our work

988
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,769
The public who came to see the exhibition
didn't bring anything with them

989
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:24,443
Do you want lunch
who came to steal the diamonds?

990
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:25,536
- No, don't throw it!
- Why?

991
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,845
- Wafers will be crushed
- Won't you get reformed?

992
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,553
What is the price of this necklace?

993
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:42,054
What are you thinking?

994
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,463
I am thinking how to take out this diamond?

995
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,193
Take away like this

996
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,767
Why did you take that?
Police will shoot us

997
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,467
- Keep it!
- Will cop shoot us?

998
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,465

- Is it you?
- No, I am not

1000
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,409
Stop!

1001
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,746
I have to go back to native safe
without getting into any case and complaint

1002
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,078
Where is he?

1003
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,954
It is a dirty and stinking one

1004
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,361
Are you standing here?

1005
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,535
Sir, Velayudham is going Catch him

1006
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,585
By mistake I jumped over you Go slow

1007
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,320
- Velayudham is going...
- Velayudham!

1008
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,124
Why do you jump like this?

1009
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,631
- Velayudham is going...
- Velayudham!

1010
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,141
Go slow!

1011
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,716
It seems if I travel little more
I will reach my home town

1012
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:29,665
- Are you from press?
- Have you come as a spy here?

1013
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,097
No, don't come near me

1014
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:41,645
Come on!

1015
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,844
See how they are coming with force
because of your flaunting

1016
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,587
Let me play with them and back soon

1017
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:34,826
Someone is beating our guys Move fast

1018
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,579
Come sir!

1019
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,331
Velayudham planned well and made us
come here to catch them red handed

1020
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,641
Is it you Velayudham?

1021
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:58,105
Did you weave your magic on me
to bruise my heart repeatedly?

1022
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:05,245
Did you come to kill me softly?
Did you come with a sweet reply?

1023
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:13,154
Off my feet you swept me
Transfixed I watched wondrously

1024
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:20,295
What did you do to me?
I asked you imploringly

1025
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:26,463
Did you cast your spell on me
to hypnotise my heart repeatedly?

1026
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:33,675
Did you come to kill me softly?
Did you come with an apt reply?

1027
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:52,289
I transformed into a garden
my shy buds flowered laden

1028
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:55,768
For elephant to eat
I was the green-feast!

1029
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:59,363
Waves of love ashore
I tried to run even more

1030
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:02,966
Tenderhooks, on hook's tip
I knotted my life not to slip

1031
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:09,449
I fell a little distance away
electrified in a dizzy sway

1032
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:16,951
Forgetting my name, in dismay
like a stone, very still I lay

1033
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:23,190
Did you mesmerize me totally
to s(t)eal my heart deeply?

1034
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:31,166
Did you come to kill me softly?
Did you come with the right reply?

1035
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:03,160
Ms Beauty, diamond not beads of sweat

1036
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:06,638
No word in Tamil to describe you as yet

1037
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:10,234
Like durva grass your moustache

1038
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:13,781
...that my teeth yearn
to nibble unabashed

1039
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:20,845
When near you, even thorn
like a rose decides to reform!

1040
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:27,919
Even mountains succumb
before you as tiny as an atom

1041
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,099
You came here to arrest Velayudham

1042
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,830
But he helped you to catch 5 terrorists
Still you are...

1043
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,632
Please stop projecting Velayudham as a hero

1044
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,906
We should find who is that antisocial
element working against terrorists

1045
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:42,869
Get into the van!

1046
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:45,071
Velayudham has come like a warrior

1047
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:50,117
...and helped the cops to arrest
the terrorist and their arms go down

1048
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:54,587
it will be a final warning
for the racketeers

1049
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,258
Hello, I am here!

1050
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,763
- What is the matter?
- I came to meet you

1051
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:07,631
- Seems you are very simple
- I am always simple

1052
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,466
Velayudham, how many bombs
did you find today?

1053
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,301
How many public did you save today?

1054
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:15,376
Don't play with me?
Go!

1055
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,936
Why did you go to that place alone
and get caught?

1056
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,776
I feel scared to involve in tussle

1057
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:22,543
I've beaten them to pulp to save your life

1058
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:27,319
- You are acting smart
- I am the king of my village...

1059
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:30,516
I will make it grand and
win even it is a dance or fight

1060
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:32,784
- 2 special tea
- Village?

1061
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:36,022
It is an ordinary village
Such a wonderful place

1062
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,628
I am facing many problems
after I've reached Chennai

1063
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:44,535
When got down in Egmore railway station
someone snatched my sister's bag

1064
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,966
Then what about bike?

1065
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:49,635
Yes, I chased him on the bike
and got back the bag

1066
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:52,236
I didn't know whose bike was that

1067
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,307
Did you go to CIT Nagarfew days ago?

1068
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:57,978
CIT Nagar! Yes!

1069
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,620
Someone has lost his suitcase and gone

1070
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,656
I handed over that to him in CIT Nagar

1071
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:05,258
Then what about yesterday
who came to save me in horse?

1072
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,887
I didn't drive that it drove me there

1073
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,497
it was useful to save your life

1074
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:14,326
How do you know all this?

1075
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,936
Someone called Velayudham
is the hero of this city

1076
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:24,909
Do you know that?

1077
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,948
Yes, I've heard about him Did you meet him?

1078
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:31,746
Today public are talking and praising
the hero of the city Velayudham

1079
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,347
it's none other you, Velayudham

1080
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,722
A special team from Central government

1081
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,858
has been taken over the terrorists under
their custody who we caught them in the fort

1082
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,060
What do you say?

1083
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,468
Inspector Gnanasundaram
is going to handover them

1084
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,937
We are helpless Nothing can be done

1085
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:59,271
Home Minister is waiting Stop the vehicle

1086
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:07,079
We are on the way to Airport to handover
the terrorist who we caught in the fort

1087
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,881
He is our next leader

1088
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,491
You should've committed suicide
when you were caught

1089
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:52,028
- it is too late
- Don't shoot

1090
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,206
The bike was near to us

1091
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:05,570
He has saved everyone
throwing it to a long distance

1092
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,639
Not only that day
Today I only saw him at first time

1093
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:18,487
Those who are not scared of encounter
are scared of Velayudham

1094
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,686
He is also a criminal
We will arrest him also

1095
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:22,987
Velayudham is superb

1096
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,529
if I think it's a miracle

1097
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:32,867
You are going to change the peoples' destiny
who are living as it is fate

1098
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:37,845
Why are you laughing?

1099
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,710
Then? You are telling something
and talking high about me

1100
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:48,184
I didn't come to achieve and
reform this country and save this people

1101
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,223
Because of my sister's marriage...

1102
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:54,089
I am an ordinary milk vendor in Pavunur

1103
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:58,291
You are not an ordinary man
You are honest and brave

1104
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:01,958
Good thing has happened
because of you without your knowledge...

1105
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,569
...why don't you do
by knowing everything?

1106
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,569
Why don't you change as Velayudham
for the people who believe you?

1107
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:14,515
Hardly it's not completed 10 minutes
than my sister is calling me

1108
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,783
- Tell me dear
- Where are you?

1109
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:20,046
- Come fast
- I will come

1110
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:23,390
I am her world and she is my world

1111
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:27,823
if you tell anything else
I won't understand it

1112
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:31,588
What did you tell me?

1113
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,660
You can do anything to Tamil Nadu
being my driver

1114
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:38,735
No one will question you

1115
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,802
That day you said that
no one will question me

1116
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:44,570
But he is asking questioning one by one

1117
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:48,238
He has spoiled everything Who is he?

1118
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,575
Without knowing Velayudham's address...

1119
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:57,315
...thousands of people have sent the
letters to my office

1120
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,426
Have you seen this?

1121
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:04,460
They wrote this with blood

1122
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,301
Don't you understand their agony?

1123
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:14,168
Don't you worry about them
who are believing you?

1124
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:22,943
In this world there is no adulteration
only in the belief

1125
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:25,716
Without conscience some politician,
Educated people...

1126
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:31,656
...rich people, saints, police,
doctors, and someone...

1127
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:36,391
...they are playing with peoples' belief

1128
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:40,964
You are also asking me to do the same thing

1129
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:44,037
I am telling you to change as Velayudham
to make it real

1130
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:48,609
They are many places
where wrong things happen

1131
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,070
I can't destroy them to
by changing as Velayudham

1132
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:54,644
Ten incarnations were not enough
for God Himself to destroy injustice

1133
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,483
- How can I...?
- What do you want me to do?

1134
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,019
You kill that Velayudham

1135
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,588
I want Velayudham

1136
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:07,862
You got 3 corpses to create a Velayudham...

1137
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:09,997
...similarly find one more corpse
to destroy him

1138
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,989
You make them believe that he is Velayudham

1139
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:17,226
You finish the story
that was started by you

1140
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:29,312
No fear when Velayudham is alive

1141
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:32,377
Beat him he has only mud in his head

1142
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:33,917
- Cauvery!
- Yes brother!

1143
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,215
We have to go to our village Get ready

1144
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,349
- Ok brother!
- Will our work get finished before that?

1145
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:39,522
- It will finish
- Ok

1146
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:43,154
Why should we need police
when Velayudham is doing everything?

1147
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:47,997
He has killed 10 people against the law
as if helping all

1148
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,134
What are you doing to catch Velayudham?

1149
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:54,036
- We are tracing
- You can do nothing

1150
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,144
You don't have qualification
to be the police

1151
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:58,370
Why?

1152
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,881
After studying up to 5th grade,
are you trying to rule us?

1153
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:07,353
People like you are the reason
to get bad name for us

1154
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,657
You have killed many people
to get Minister's post

1155
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:14,159
But Velayudham killed 10 people
and saved 10,000 people

1156
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:15,728
Do you want to catch him?

1157
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:18,595
I have to beat you with slippers

1158
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:22,499
Hey Feroz khan

1159
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:25,104
Why are you silent?

1160
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,705
We will catch him soon

1161
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:29,569
- You have to involve fully
to catch Velayudham - Ok sir

1162
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,779
- You can do anything
- Ok sir

1163
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:34,946
I'll take care of your promotion

1164
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:40,716
it is very important for us
to catch Velayudham than the police

1165
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,758
I'll give you 5 millions who kills him

1166
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,591
- Stop it
- This will not stop for your threatening

1167
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,868
You are the only one
who has seen Velayudham

1168
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,938
if you see him again
you have to inform us first

1169
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:00,439
That's why we give Rs 0.5 millions
This is only advance

1170
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,098
Why did you show the sickle for me?

1171
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,871
If you give the currency I could show him

1172
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:05,445
You got money, isn't it?
Show him

1173
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:06,979
Is he going in front of me?

1174
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:11,108
- Velayudham is going
- Where? - That red color shirt

1175
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,854
Don't leave him Catch him

1176
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,358
Who are you?
Why are you beating me?

1177
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,161
- Hey, not him
- Not him?

1178
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:28,030
When he has not beaten you
you should know he is not Velayudham

1179
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:30,362
- Go and see that side
- You don't need to go any way

1180
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,370
if I see him again I'll call you

1181
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,373
They are beating someone
thinking that he is Velayudham

1182
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:38,169
if any good people comes
they'll start to eliminate them

1183
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:41,480
- He said he'll call me, let's move now
- Didn't you get any other shirt?

1184
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:48,488
Velayudham will protect us

1185
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,662
I've deposited my money believing you...

1186
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:01,392
Go from here

1187
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:04,266
I am telling you
Don't create the problem here

1188
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:07,499
Leave this place Listen to me

1189
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:11,842
- Give my money back
- Leave my leg

1190
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,448
My daughter's condition is
very serious in the hospital

1191
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:16,414
if you don't give the money she will die

1192
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:20,011
- I beg you
- Leave my leg

1193
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:21,349
- Sir
- Get up

1194
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:24,016
- Sir
- Go away from here

1195
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:26,718
- Sir
- Brother

1196
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:29,125
He gave me this cheque
in your presence, didn't he?

1197
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,460
I've deposited the cheque in the bank
but it has bounced

1198
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,932
My daughter's condition is
very serious in the hospital

1199
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,763
The investors are asking their money
What happened to our money?

1200
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,203
This is a fraud company

1201
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:41,138
They have swindled your money
You don't get your money back

1202
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:42,038
Is this enough? Go man

1203
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:43,906
We won't go from here
till we get back our money

1204
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:54,045
I don't know what I can do

1205
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,053
You have closed the company suddenly

1206
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:06,130
I feel very bad
seeing at investors sufferings

1207
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,724
Their curse will not leave us

1208
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:11,168
if their curse had been true
I might have died long time ago

1209
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:12,432
They are fools

1210
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:17,739
They invested their money
when I offered more interest for their money

1211
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:18,903
I will take care everything

1212
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:23,078
What? Have you closed the finance company?

1213
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:27,352
I bought this finance company
to earn some money and close it

1214
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,945
I would have closed it before

1215
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:33,290
I accepted for your deal
that you said you'll give me fake notes

1216
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:37,091
In the mean time Velayudham entered
and burned all fake notes

1217
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,795
I won't give a single paisa to anyone

1218
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:43,132
Leave it How much will we get?

1219
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:45,705
Approximately 10 billions

1220
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:50,107
Who is it?

1221
01:30:57,084 --> 01:31:00,212
I'll give you 5 minutes
You should go from here

1222
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:02,618
Else I'll take severe action upon you

1223
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:04,750
Don't you listen to me?

1224
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:07,919
Instead of giving security for us
you are sold and acting favour to someone?

1225
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:08,859
Don't you feel ashamed?

1226
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:10,530
How dare you speak against the police?

1227
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:18,567
If we ask money
you're beating us by the police

1228
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:20,300
Why do you do atrocity like this?

1229
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:35,320
Stop Everything has gone

1230
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:39,783
I have lost my life
My daughter is also going to die

1231
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:42,556
Why should I be alive
after my daughter's death?

1232
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:48,227
It's better if she dies as an orphan
than dying when her father is alive

1233
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:55,101
No, don't do

1234
01:31:57,912 --> 01:32:00,779
I don't have guts to pyre you

1235
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:03,682
Sir!

1236
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:06,418
Brother!

1237
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,562
You got the blame for his death
Government might not help us

1238
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:27,232
And your police, Even God might not help us

1239
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:30,003
But someone will come for us

1240
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:31,305
Velayudham!

1241
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,614
Our Velayudham will come

1242
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,817
He will take revenge against
for the atrocities we suffered

1243
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:42,081
it is said in our Quran that we'll
get the salary before our sweat get dry

1244
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:45,950
I swear on Allah Velayudham will come

1245
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:50,625
He will ask the accounts
for every paisa you cheated us

1246
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:55,060
You may come with many guys
and having many weapons

1247
01:32:55,169 --> 01:33:00,072
But our Velayudham will destroy
all of you with single-handed

1248
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:14,912
Vaigai express is ready
to leave for Madurai

1249
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,127
At least tell me now,
why do you send us alone home?

1250
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,426
It may get delay 2 or 3 days
to get the chit-fund money

1251
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:33,666
Only one week remains for the marriage
You go and do the arrangements

1252
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:35,106
- I'll be back soon
- Okay

1253
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:39,107
You will come soon, isn't it?

1254
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:02,694
Velayudham is not dead

1255
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:25,720
Have you solved the problem?
Take care of the money

1256
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:27,717
Sir, this is our fort

1257
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:30,921
Even a bird can't enter into this beyond us

1258
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,167
What happened?

1259
01:34:43,544 --> 01:34:46,741
A vulture has entered into our fort

1260
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:50,183
- Vulture!?
- Velayudham has come

1261
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:52,536
People have deposited their savings
in your company

1262
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,666
...not for desiring
to get your 0.5% interest

1263
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:59,507
Just a small belief to lead a happy life

1264
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:03,972
Hard worker's sweat is more
powerful than the mother's milk

1265
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:06,578
Why did you swindle their money?

1266
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:15,693
If we feel thirsty
we can drink a glass of water

1267
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:21,501
You are very greedy Have it

1268
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,950
No, I didn't get a chance to see his face

1269
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:43,922
But he made me to distribute the money
by myself and saved my dignity

1270
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:47,721
if I hadn't got this money, I would've
committed suicide with my family

1271
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:51,320
I called my brother to
tell that I've lost my money

1272
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:52,694
But he didn't pick the call

1273
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:57,404
But I don't know about this Velayudham
He has done a great job

1274
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:01,099
This money is my 5 years savings

1275
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:04,735
if I hadn't got this money,
my son would've worked with me in the quarry

1276
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:08,975
I deposited my pension money
because it would be helpful in my end days

1277
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:11,347
He should be prosperous
who got this money back

1278
01:38:13,754 --> 01:38:16,723
Operation got success
You can discharge her in 2 days

1279
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:17,722
Thank you, doctor

1280
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:24,897
if Velayudham hadn't got the money back,
I would've lost my brother's daughter

1281
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:26,967
He should be prosperous

1282
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:44,749
Velayudham, this magic word is the
talk of the entire Tamil Nadu

1283
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:50,022
There is no history as getting back money
from the cheated finance company

1284
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:55,187
First time, public got their savings back
with the help Velayudham

1285
01:38:55,696 --> 01:38:58,187
You are the only reason for their happiness

1286
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:01,124
it's not me it is you

1287
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:04,796
You changed this Velu as Velayudham

1288
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:11,540
Not only me...
But my 2 friends also there

1289
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:18,109
We had anger to stop the atrocity
but we don't have man power

1290
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:21,278
We had enough courage
but we couldn't make a master plan

1291
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:27,527
Not only this! The atrocity which
we tried to reveal the outer world

1292
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,358
...it is still happening

1293
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:33,166
I feel scared to tell this to you

1294
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:39,031
Young girls are being kidnapped
and auctioned

1295
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,402
There are girls who left their home
after fighting with their parents...

1296
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:51,511
...and girls from orphanages and
girls who got cheated by their lovers

1297
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:56,819
Small girls...
I've seen the death fear in the girl's eyes

1298
01:39:56,924 --> 01:40:01,588
...those who got kidnapped

1299
01:40:07,868 --> 01:40:11,167
Why are you crying?
Don't make noise

1300
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,775
- Send them fast
- Go!

1301
01:40:18,312 --> 01:40:20,940
What is this?
Why did you bring the blind?

1302
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:23,080
We couldn't even
get a good price for good girls

1303
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:26,013
Am I doing the business
or running a ladies hostel?

1304
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,517
Keep her aside I'll use her

1305
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:33,089
Are you mad?
Why do you ask for a blind girl?

1306
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:37,459
All girls get scared seeing my face
and spit on me

1307
01:40:37,564 --> 01:40:40,499
She is blind!
Let her think me for a while

1308
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:41,795
- Come on!
- Leave me!

1309
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,601
Leave her!
Please leave her

1310
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,109
- Don't spoil her life
- Get lost

1311
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:53,707
Leave me!

1312
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:59,209
Why do you behave like a dog?
She is a blind girl

1313
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,987
How arrogant you are!

1314
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,926
- Sweetie!
- Leave me!

1315
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:13,561
Leave me

1316
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:35,148
Our brother Velayudham has come to save us

1317
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:46,589
Show your mighty to him
Then if you are alive, do as you wish

1318
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:47,962
We will stay here

1319
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:54,499
Go inside!

1320
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:57,167
Go, show your strength

1321
01:43:37,411 --> 01:43:38,207
Give it to me!

1322
01:44:16,817 --> 01:44:19,183
Beat him to pulp Thrash him

1323
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:07,629
- Who are you?
- I am Velayudham

1324
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:18,468
Everyone is eagerly waiting
to see your face

1325
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:22,971
Though you're standing in front of my eyes
But I am not able to see your face

1326
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:26,109
I feel very sad about my blindness today

1327
01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:27,447
Don't worry!

1328
01:45:27,554 --> 01:45:31,820
It is very beautiful to see the world
from our heart than the eyes

1329
01:45:42,903 --> 01:45:48,466
We were helpless
But Velayudham retrieved us

1330
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:51,169
We are very thankful to Velayudham
who gave us a new life

1331
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:57,075
it's not a big matter that he saved our lives
But he saved our dignity

1332
01:45:57,217 --> 01:45:59,208
I wonder how to thank him

1333
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,234
Brother... brother!

1334
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:22,968
- Tell me, sister! - When will you
return to our village, brother?

1335
01:46:23,143 --> 01:46:24,440
I will come soon

1336
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:27,945
- What about marriage arrangements?
- It's going smooth

1337
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,778
- ls anybody near you?
- Yes, Vaithegi

1338
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:32,112
Give the phone to her

1339
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:34,219
- Give it to me!
- I'll deliver the milk cane and come back

1340
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:35,379
Tell me, dear!

1341
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:38,720
I hope you will take care of her well!
That's why I am staying here

1342
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:40,452
I'll take care of her

1343
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:41,652
- Dear!
- Give it to me

1344
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:44,859
How are you, brother?

1345
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:49,664
Don't worry!
Here is a girl to take care of me

1346
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:51,801
She is everything for me

1347
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:55,906
- She gave a new meaning
for my life - Who is she?

1348
01:46:56,009 --> 01:46:58,239
I'll bring her with me
when I come to the village

1349
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:27,834
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe

1350
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:33,311
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears

1351
01:47:33,413 --> 01:47:36,314
Nose like a green chilly
Mustard nose-ring so tiny

1352
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:41,319
Vegetable hot house are you, my princess?

1353
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:50,324
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe

1354
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:55,800
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears

1355
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:58,735
Nose like a green chilly
Mustard nose-ring so tiny

1356
01:47:58,839 --> 01:48:03,401
Vegetable hot house are you, my princess?

1357
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:34,907
You are fifteen only
tender mango, my lovely

1358
01:48:35,141 --> 01:48:40,704
My poor heart needs you for comfort!

1359
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:45,842
Your eyes spear me fiercely
Your teasing touch seared me

1360
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:51,451
With you within my sight
my days turn into night!

1361
01:48:51,558 --> 01:48:57,519
No holds barred your beauty is unmarred

1362
01:48:57,631 --> 01:49:03,126
In the skillet of your eyes
you deep-fry me to adrenalize

1363
01:49:03,236 --> 01:49:08,674
Without closing your eyelids
you send me arrows of Cupid's

1364
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:14,213
Within 5 seconds you bury me
into my soul's dimple deeply

1365
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:17,215
Treasure trove is your body
Seductively you entice me

1366
01:49:17,317 --> 01:49:19,877
You spoil me with your kisses
you tantalizing temptress!

1367
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:22,750
Treasure trove is your body
Seductively you enrapture me

1368
01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:25,552
Kissing expert with panache Mr Moustache!

1369
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:31,154
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe

1370
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:36,702
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears

1371
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:04,529
Your candy smile so addictive
Reaction to my touch explosive

1372
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:10,396
Your eyes like a dark bee
Enticed, I fell into it willingly

1373
01:50:10,503 --> 01:50:15,531
Your nails scribbled over me
Creating love-scars on my body

1374
01:50:15,976 --> 01:50:21,141
To hear my satiated cry
my desire deepened to a high

1375
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:27,219
In my dreams you haunt me
every night differently

1376
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,948
Your dress disarrayed My life disarranged

1377
01:50:30,056 --> 01:50:32,684
I am defragmented!

1378
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:38,230
Till I lose all my control
you plan to swallow me whole

1379
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:41,164
Body-a-swiveling
Bangles-a-breaking

1380
01:50:41,267 --> 01:50:43,963
You take me body and soul

1381
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:46,834
Mounted hollow Moderate tornado

1382
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:49,568
Unending curves Planting hot kisses

1383
01:50:49,676 --> 01:50:52,440
Sweet nothings whispered
Amorous advances on bed

1384
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:55,173
In spite of kith and kin
something struck within

1385
01:50:55,281 --> 01:51:00,776
Still a shoot full of tenderness
I crown you as Miss Universe

1386
01:51:00,887 --> 01:51:06,325
Okra-like slim fingers
Broad bean-like ears

1387
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:09,259
Nose like a green chilly
Mustard nose-ring so tiny

1388
01:51:09,362 --> 01:51:14,527
Vegetable hot house are you, my princess?

1389
01:51:18,805 --> 01:51:23,208
A special show about super hero Velayudham
who gives belief to good people

1390
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:24,742
...and he instilled fear to outlaws

1391
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:34,885
instead of waging a war...

1392
01:51:34,988 --> 01:51:39,322
if they create economic fall that country
will struggle many years to revive

1393
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:43,556
Velayudham has blocked fake notes
to stop our country's economic fall

1394
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:47,091
My son wanted to start a hotel for long

1395
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,102
Velayudham is the reason
for starting the hotel

1396
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:52,535
Not only for me

1397
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:56,405
You can't buy the happiness
even you give crores of money...

1398
01:51:56,509 --> 01:51:59,307
...you can see the happiness
who got help from him

1399
01:51:59,412 --> 01:52:01,642
Hence, whoever does a wrong thing...

1400
01:52:01,748 --> 01:52:06,811
if anybody thinks to do wrong thing
first you go out from here

1401
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:12,051
Else our Velayudham
will kill everyone like a dog

1402
01:52:23,303 --> 01:52:25,396
Why did you leave me alone?

1403
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:31,434
I begot only one son and you left me alone

1404
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:37,273
Hence, this will happen to you
and those who believe you

1405
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,351
Find out the bombs
wherever it is kept, will you?

1406
01:52:39,452 --> 01:52:41,977
I have planted the bomb in
three places in the city

1407
01:52:42,555 --> 01:52:43,817
if you can, take that

1408
01:52:44,858 --> 01:52:48,350
You have started the hotel
with the money given by him

1409
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:51,829
- Now you are dead
- Put down the body

1410
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:55,096
- Has his relatives come?
- His mom has come

1411
01:52:56,703 --> 01:52:59,433
I've planted bomb in three places
Krupa, see your mom

1412
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:00,636
if you can take that bomb

1413
01:53:29,102 --> 01:53:30,467
Rascals

1414
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:35,337
Mom!

1415
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:38,410
- My baby!
- Mom

1416
01:53:52,759 --> 01:53:55,159
We should find the other two bombs

1417
01:53:55,261 --> 01:53:56,888
Please come with me

1418
01:53:58,264 --> 01:53:59,390
Where should I search?

1419
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:02,366
School, hospital, beach,
temple or market where?

1420
01:54:02,468 --> 01:54:05,494
Do you want me to search everywhere?

1421
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:09,099
Not bomb! I have to find out
who kept the bomb there

1422
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,688
Velayudham? In which place?

1423
01:54:51,217 --> 01:54:53,276
I've caught Velayudham
that you were searching for

1424
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:56,048
This time it will not miss
I have locked him

1425
01:54:56,155 --> 01:54:59,613
I don't want advance
Come with your boss with full amount

1426
01:55:09,035 --> 01:55:10,525
Come man

1427
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:13,568
- Minister brother!
- Take your money

1428
01:55:13,673 --> 01:55:15,573
- Where is he?
- He is inside

1429
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,908
Kill and chop him

1430
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:22,111
Come boys

1431
01:55:27,387 --> 01:55:29,787
Why did you lock the door?

1432
01:55:29,889 --> 01:55:31,982
You are asking who is Velayudham

1433
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:33,991
He asked me who was searching for him

1434
01:55:38,665 --> 01:55:41,190
I should show him What Velayudham?

1435
01:55:46,572 --> 01:55:48,335
Who? it is him

1436
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:56,510
I wanted to know who has announced
to give 5 millions to kill him...

1437
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:57,947
...that's why I took Rs 0.5 million

1438
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:03,216
This money is nothing
compared to helping Velayudham

1439
01:56:11,097 --> 01:56:12,724
Where did you plant the other two bombs?

1440
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:16,533
Don't lose your life Tell him

1441
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:22,301
How dare you casually kill people?

1442
01:56:24,944 --> 01:56:25,638
Tell me

1443
01:56:25,745 --> 01:56:27,303
it is a lie that he has kept two more bombs

1444
01:56:27,547 --> 01:56:29,572
lbrahim is the reason for this

1445
01:56:29,682 --> 01:56:33,584
He has diverted you and police
that there are bombs in the city...

1446
01:56:33,686 --> 01:56:36,246
...and they are hijacking a train

1447
01:56:43,563 --> 01:56:48,159
As per our plan we will go to this factory

1448
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:52,168
They are manufacturing dangerous
and poisonous chemicals

1449
01:56:55,274 --> 01:57:00,541
if this factory's chemical container blasts
30 to 40 villages will be destroyed

1450
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:04,207
All new born babies will have defects

1451
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:06,376
Security will be tighten in the factory

1452
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:10,515
if we have to go inside the factory
we should go through goods track way

1453
01:57:11,357 --> 01:57:13,120
When this 1000 ton weight
train blasts and clashes...

1454
01:57:13,226 --> 01:57:17,253
...with that chemical container
at 200 km speed...

1455
01:57:17,663 --> 01:57:20,359
...it will be a pleasing sight to see

1456
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:23,665
This will be a great achievement
in jihad group

1457
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:27,763
Within few minutes Ameer and Sultan
will kill the next station master

1458
01:57:28,141 --> 01:57:32,339
if we cross that last station
we will get full control of this train

1459
01:57:49,595 --> 01:57:52,462
- Mom!
- All of you go to the last compartment

1460
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,238
Go fast

1461
01:58:00,206 --> 01:58:01,138
Leave me

1462
01:58:05,978 --> 01:58:10,244
That route station master is not
responding to us to inform him

1463
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:48,846
increase the speed

1464
01:59:59,492 --> 02:00:00,857
Bring the helicopter

1465
02:00:24,317 --> 02:00:27,548
I am searching for you

1466
02:00:28,187 --> 02:00:31,156
You are not searching for me
but the God of Death

1467
02:02:22,802 --> 02:02:24,269
How will I stop the train?

1468
02:02:26,272 --> 02:02:27,830
Pull that black wire

1469
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:32,435
You the destroyer have no rights
to say God's name Allah

1470
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:33,436
Do you know one thing?

1471
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:37,202
You can't see a Hindu
who don't have a Muslim friend

1472
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:38,934
You are going to spoil that

1473
02:03:39,912 --> 02:03:40,844
Come man

1474
02:03:44,216 --> 02:03:45,444
Sir, greetings

1475
02:03:45,551 --> 02:03:49,988
Velayudham asked me to hand over him to you

1476
02:03:50,756 --> 02:03:54,954
He said that this guy feel giddiness for
half an hour because of his beating

1477
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:56,891
it will take some time for him
to get consciousness

1478
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:59,521
That's why I caught him Take him

1479
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:09,798
if you see Velayudham tell him that
I am also his fan among millions of fans

1480
02:04:13,112 --> 02:04:14,136
Ok sir

1481
02:04:31,230 --> 02:04:32,663
Brother has come

1482
02:04:35,634 --> 02:04:36,658
That's it

1483
02:04:45,211 --> 02:04:50,080
- Why are you dancing?
- No, we've some influence in our place

1484
02:04:50,216 --> 02:04:54,516
They won't listen to me adorn the garland
Move away

1485
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:57,282
Do you need respect as you have come
just 3 days before the sister's marriage?

1486
02:04:57,389 --> 02:04:59,584
- This is for the groom
- Has the groom come?

1487
02:05:00,459 --> 02:05:01,687
Hold it for a minute

1488
02:05:02,127 --> 02:05:04,687
Give it to me, how long
will you hold this garland for me?

1489
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:08,129
What groom?
How is your journey?

1490
02:05:08,234 --> 02:05:10,464
- Music arrangements are nice
- Come groom

1491
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:15,035
When I see the crowd,
I think he will get more gift money

1492
02:05:15,574 --> 02:05:19,066
I'll steal the gift money
and get what I've lost

1493
02:05:21,881 --> 02:05:23,906
PUSHPATHOOR

1494
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,014
The people in our place catch goat and hen

1495
02:05:26,118 --> 02:05:28,279
Will you catch this filth in your town?

1496
02:05:28,387 --> 02:05:31,117
Are you teasing me?
You damn it!

1497
02:05:31,223 --> 02:05:34,488
You are giving pose like Sivaji
to do this filthy work

1498
02:05:34,593 --> 02:05:35,821
Go man

1499
02:05:36,762 --> 02:05:39,060
I have to retrieve carefully
what I lose in this village

1500
02:05:39,598 --> 02:05:41,225
- Dear!
- Vaithegi

1501
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:44,131
Didn't I tell you about my fiancee?

1502
02:05:46,605 --> 02:05:49,301
She doesn't know English Come

1503
02:05:50,276 --> 02:05:51,641
You sinner!

1504
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:01,245
- Brother!
- See her tears!

1505
02:06:04,456 --> 02:06:05,718
- Uncle
- Tell me son-in-law

1506
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:08,019
Where will we arrange for groom to stay?

1507
02:06:08,127 --> 02:06:10,527
I've been telling for 7 days
that he'll stay in my house

1508
02:06:10,629 --> 02:06:12,995
But our leader
wants him to stay in his house

1509
02:06:13,098 --> 02:06:16,192
I won't bother where he stays
But I will arrange his food

1510
02:06:16,302 --> 02:06:20,204
- These decorations are mine,
how is it? - it is nice

1511

Make the arrangements

1512
02:06:21,807 --> 02:06:23,604
Groom, come with me we will go to my home

1513
02:06:23,709 --> 02:06:25,108
Everyone likes you, isn't it?

1514
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:28,270
How can I say thanks for this?

1515
02:06:29,815 --> 02:06:33,148
- Didn't I tell you that someone
is taking care of me? - it is me

1516
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:34,777
She is the one

1517
02:06:35,287 --> 02:06:37,448

- Correct

02:06:38,324 --> 02:06:41,020
- I won't leave just like that
- You don't

1519
02:06:42,761 --> 02:06:45,628
Dear, she will stay in my home

1520
02:06:45,731 --> 02:06:49,792
We should take care of the person
who took care of you

1521
02:06:50,169 --> 02:06:53,036
Then I will also stay here
I have to do a lot of marriage works

1522
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:58,398
Why do you leave me on the way
like a snapped slipper?

1523
02:06:58,744 --> 02:07:02,407
- Brother, come home
- Tell me, will they allow you in your home?

1524
02:07:02,514 --> 02:07:04,379
They will allow me We will sleep together

1525
02:07:04,483 --> 02:07:06,974
I can sleep out instead of
sleeping with you

1526
02:07:07,086 --> 02:07:09,384
Will you take me to do
that filthy work? Go man

1527
02:07:09,888 --> 02:07:11,014
- Sister!
- Brother!

1528
02:07:11,123 --> 02:07:13,717
- I have kept the auspicious sari
in this bureau - Okay

1529
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:16,150
Money is in this bureau

1530
02:07:16,261 --> 02:07:17,728
I will take it and escape from here

1531
02:07:22,735 --> 02:07:24,498
Why were you waiting for so long?

1532
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:26,828
Did you see me before hand?

1533
02:07:26,972 --> 02:07:30,703
You've kept the bureau opened
when money is inside

1534
02:07:30,809 --> 02:07:32,800
I am standing here for security

1535
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:36,540
I know that thief
will search the money in bureau

1536
02:07:36,649 --> 02:07:40,176
That's why I have kept the
money on the bureau top

1537
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:41,517
How is it?

1538
02:07:47,426 --> 02:07:48,859
What happened?
Wait, I will take that

1539
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:50,360
if we take it ourselves fingers will be cut

1540
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:54,193
I couldn't steal the money in day time
I can steal only at night

1541
02:07:55,434 --> 02:07:56,799
ls anybody there?

1542
02:07:57,836 --> 02:07:59,201
Come fast

1543
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:01,772
What granny?
Why are you shouting?

1544
02:08:02,474 --> 02:08:04,442
What happened?
Oh God!

1545
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:06,306
Why are you shouting?

1546
02:08:06,512 --> 02:08:08,878
I'll become a murderer
before I become a thief

1547
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:09,879
What granny?

1548
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:16,420
Why are they sleeping here
What happened granny?

1549
02:08:16,522 --> 02:08:20,390
I am blind
I called someone to accompany to toilet

1550
02:08:20,492 --> 02:08:24,394
Have I hit myself for this blind granny?

1551
02:08:24,697 --> 02:08:25,527
Bring the jeep

1552
02:08:25,798 --> 02:08:26,992
- Only one question!
- Stop

1553
02:08:27,099 --> 02:08:28,964
Believe what I tell you

1554
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:32,799
I made him a driver to my brother
because of money

1555
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:35,169
There is no connection
between this and my brother

1556
02:08:35,274 --> 02:08:37,242
How can I face him from now?

1557
02:08:37,342 --> 02:08:40,834
- I don't have any rights to live
- What are you doing?

1558
02:08:41,113 --> 02:08:44,344
Yesterday we got lbrahim
the leader of terrorism...

1559
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:46,941
...in this situation
we are suspicious about him

1560
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:49,577
...that he worked
with the minister as a driver...

1561
02:08:49,688 --> 02:08:55,991
As per his brother's statement police have
diverted to enquire Minister's brother

1562
02:08:56,095 --> 02:09:00,259
Velayudham has been praised
who caught the terrorist

1563
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:01,430
Have you seen this?

1564
02:09:01,533 --> 02:09:04,502
He will be also a brave man
who he named my brother name

1565
02:09:10,876 --> 02:09:13,709
Cheeky girl!
She is gesturing him with her eyes

1566
02:09:13,912 --> 02:09:17,109
I'll pluck your eyes
See, what I am going to do?

1567
02:09:18,517 --> 02:09:20,849
Have you mesmerised my fiance
by wearing pant and shirt?

1568
02:09:21,253 --> 02:09:23,847
You are Bharathi But I am Rathi(Beauty)

1569
02:09:27,326 --> 02:09:29,658
Why these coconuts are small
for my sister's marriage?

1570
02:09:29,762 --> 02:09:32,230
Coconut will be small
even Ambani's sister gets married

1571
02:09:32,331 --> 02:09:33,298
Don't torture me

1572
02:10:01,794 --> 02:10:03,489
Dear, actually...

1573
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:16,370
Superb! You have changed as a village girl
I like this

1574
02:10:16,742 --> 02:10:18,767
This is nice, isn't it?
I asked her to wear this

1575
02:10:19,812 --> 02:10:20,676
Who is she?

1576
02:10:20,846 --> 02:10:23,337
- Dear!
- Vaithegi!

1577
02:10:23,649 --> 02:10:25,173
What happened to you?

1578
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:27,884
This is your uniform which you wore
in your 1st standard class, isn't it?

1579
02:10:27,986 --> 02:10:31,387
- Yes brother! it was that uniform
- Why you need this?

1580
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:32,684
See her! How she is looking?

1581
02:10:32,791 --> 02:10:36,022
Learn from her, go and
change your dress, damn!

1582
02:10:40,799 --> 02:10:43,734
- Brother is on the line
- Tell me

1583
02:10:43,836 --> 02:10:45,531
I have told in the morning
what you asked me to tell

1584
02:10:45,871 --> 02:10:48,499
Everyone believed that
you're not involved in this matter, isn't it?

1585
02:10:48,607 --> 02:10:51,303
If you die, they would
believe whole heartedly

1586
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:52,570
What brother?

1587
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:15,763
Am I a thief? Or have I cheated
myself telling I am a thief?

1588
02:11:19,037 --> 02:11:26,037
Is it a daze or grief
or a confusion in mind?

1589
02:11:27,613 --> 02:11:33,711
Ls the life fearful?
Is it a daze or grief...

1590
02:11:33,819 --> 02:11:35,411
Stop it

1591
02:11:35,754 --> 02:11:38,587
Even Gemini Ganesan's conscience
irritates separately only

1592
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:41,318
Are you irritating me in multiple images
because of technology development?

1593
02:11:41,426 --> 02:11:42,757
Go man

1594
02:11:43,495 --> 02:11:44,985
I'll show you that I am a thief

1595
02:11:48,133 --> 02:11:49,657
I became a thief

1596
02:11:56,241 --> 02:12:00,109
Hey agnate! He has stolen that money

1597
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:02,304
You do one thing
you inform all our relatives

1598
02:12:02,414 --> 02:12:04,609
if thief has caught
they will inform the cops

1599
02:12:04,716 --> 02:12:06,377
Why do you inform your relatives?

1600
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:11,014
- Super!
- Give your hand

1601
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:12,718
Long live thief!

1602
02:12:13,125 --> 02:12:15,685
Did you know before that I am a thief?

1603
02:12:15,894 --> 02:12:19,227
I know! You are not fit to be a thief

1604
02:12:19,564 --> 02:12:24,831
You have to do
which work is suitable for you

1605
02:12:24,937 --> 02:12:28,373
- Have you understood?
- Why didn't you tell in 3rd reel itself?

1606
02:12:28,507 --> 02:12:32,671
The money that you stole by hard work
is yours that was kept ready to give you

1607
02:12:32,778 --> 02:12:35,713
...for spending us money in Chennai

1608
02:12:37,616 --> 02:12:40,642
Was I trying to steal my money?

1609
02:12:41,086 --> 02:12:46,149
No thief would've got insulted
like this in the whole of Asia

1610
02:12:47,893 --> 02:12:50,020
I have a doubt

1611
02:12:50,128 --> 02:12:53,222
You tell me often that
I remind you of Bajanlal sait

1612
02:12:53,332 --> 02:12:55,493
Can I see that sait?

1613
02:13:01,306 --> 02:13:04,867
Go! Put 10 paise and go

1614
02:13:04,977 --> 02:13:08,413
Else you will go crossing my corpse

1615
02:13:11,383 --> 02:13:12,850
Me!

1616
02:13:15,253 --> 02:13:18,950
I have suffered and worried
Hence, I have reformed

1617
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:20,618
Bye sait

1618
02:13:22,894 --> 02:13:25,192
Are you sleeping peacefully
to mesmerize my fiance?

1619
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:27,529
This is black magic egg

1620
02:13:27,699 --> 02:13:30,600
if I keep with you you'll forget my fiance

1621
02:13:30,702 --> 02:13:33,535
And my fiance will forget you
She must forget him

1622
02:13:42,347 --> 02:13:44,542
- Take that
- I have put many saris here

1623
02:13:44,683 --> 02:13:48,312
How does she look like?
At least tell about her complexion

1624
02:13:49,354 --> 02:13:50,582
Like her complexion

1625
02:13:54,259 --> 02:13:56,887
it matches you
Then it'll be suitable for her too

1626
02:13:58,196 --> 02:13:59,663
My fiancee Vaithegi

1627
02:14:00,632 --> 02:14:03,726
She thinks about me more than
she thinks about her mom

1628
02:14:03,802 --> 02:14:06,794
She loves me very much I too love her

1629
02:14:08,440 --> 02:14:10,670
You are an important person in my life

1630
02:14:11,043 --> 02:14:12,670
I wanted to gift this sari
to her through you...

1631
02:14:12,778 --> 02:14:16,339
...after my sister's marriage gets over...

1632
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:20,075
...and I will propose to her

1633
02:14:20,185 --> 02:14:22,244
Before that I want to play with her a game

1634
02:14:22,521 --> 02:14:28,255
Nothing! You should act as
if you're my close friend

1635
02:14:28,927 --> 02:14:32,829
This will be the last game with her
before our marriage

1636
02:14:46,912 --> 02:14:50,177
Your fiance has bought this sari
for the one who he loves

1637
02:14:50,549 --> 02:14:55,179
That is not me as you think That is you

1638
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:59,955
- Really?
- Yes!

1639
02:15:00,592 --> 02:15:04,619
Hence, you won't need black magic egg

1640
02:15:07,232 --> 02:15:08,130
Pardon me

1641
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:12,302
- Sister-in-law!
- You too joined her, isn't it?

1642
02:15:12,504 --> 02:15:15,632
Then, can you marry my brother so easily?

1643
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:18,068
- Dad!
- God bless you dear!

1644
02:15:20,178 --> 02:15:21,270
What is this?

1645
02:15:21,379 --> 02:15:24,473
You have told everything
when I thought to irritate her more

1646
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:27,882
Dear!
Don't run

1647
02:15:27,953 --> 02:15:28,885
Stand there!

1648
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:31,482
- Mom?
- Please come anybody

1649
02:15:31,623 --> 02:15:32,988
Let's see who will come here

1650
02:15:41,299 --> 02:15:45,565
You've your sister's wedding tomorrow
Do you expect a kiss now?

1651
02:15:46,204 --> 02:15:47,466
Be responsible

1652
02:15:50,008 --> 02:15:53,102
Bhai, I can release you now

1653
02:15:53,278 --> 02:15:57,305
CBI has enquired seriously
after my brother's arrest

1654
02:15:57,415 --> 02:16:00,441
- That is the problem
- Do what I say

1655
02:16:30,448 --> 02:16:33,713
Oh my blood relation

1656
02:16:33,818 --> 02:16:37,982
My dear sister...

1657
02:16:38,089 --> 02:16:45,089
You're close to my heart You're my soul too

1658
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:49,561
You are my mom and dad too

1659
02:16:49,668 --> 02:16:53,229
I live only for you

1660
02:16:53,338 --> 02:17:00,338
Even if I am dead and buried
you can feel the aura of my presence

1661
02:17:01,146 --> 02:17:08,146
Oh my blood relation

1662
02:17:28,206 --> 02:17:31,835
There is no substitute for love

1663
02:17:31,943 --> 02:17:35,709
You're no less than God to me

1664
02:17:35,814 --> 02:17:39,477
I'll follow you like the clock's needle

1665
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:43,418
Can't stay alive without you
even for a moment

1666
02:17:43,521 --> 02:17:47,184
Would fulfill whatever you wish

1667
02:17:47,292 --> 02:17:51,023
I'll dance to you tunes

1668
02:17:51,129 --> 02:17:58,129
Even if I am dead and buried
you can feel the aura of my presence

1669
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:33,267
Wish to build a golden Taj Mahal for you

1670
02:18:33,371 --> 02:18:37,068
Would weave you a saree from the clouds

1671
02:18:37,175 --> 02:18:40,941
Nothing can match you presence

1672
02:18:41,046 --> 02:18:44,675
My only wish is to be your consort

1673
02:18:44,849 --> 02:18:48,615
Like the blue of the sky...

1674
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:52,520
Like the dampness in the earth...

1675
02:18:52,624 --> 02:18:59,624
No one can separate our eternal bond

1676
02:19:22,821 --> 02:19:24,448
Bless the wedding saree

1677
02:20:02,527 --> 02:20:05,928
Don't move!
Stop! Put the gun down

1678
02:20:10,969 --> 02:20:14,871
Feroz Khan! Are you Muslim?
I am also Muslim

1679
02:20:14,973 --> 02:20:16,099
Are you trying to stop me?

1680
02:20:16,241 --> 02:20:20,371
I am struggling for the entire
Muslim community and welfare

1681
02:20:20,478 --> 02:20:23,470
- I am fighting for you too
- For what?

1682
02:20:23,581 --> 02:20:28,075
When compared with your country
Muslims live freely and safely in India

1683
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:31,550
You couldn't even save Bin laden
who you wanted to live

1684
02:20:31,723 --> 02:20:34,954
But terrorist Kasab is still alive
in India whom we hate

1685
02:20:35,126 --> 02:20:36,457
For my beloved country...

1686
02:20:36,561 --> 02:20:39,655
I should arrest a Muslim terrorist like you
and handover to my government

1687
02:20:39,764 --> 02:20:42,232
I'll feel proud to be
a true Muslim only then

1688
02:20:48,873 --> 02:20:53,469
- You are going to lose your life as
an Indian - You can kill me easily

1689
02:20:53,945 --> 02:20:56,243
But you can't escape from death

1690
02:20:56,381 --> 02:21:00,647
Velayudham will destroy everyone

1691
02:21:03,421 --> 02:21:05,548
Don't you worry of dying alone

1692
02:21:06,257 --> 02:21:09,090
I have done all the arrangements
to send Velayudham with you

1693
02:21:09,861 --> 02:21:12,659
Entire town will accompany you
Just wait for them

1694
02:21:16,801 --> 02:21:20,259
if you promote me to his posting,
I will go up

1695
02:21:23,408 --> 02:21:24,375
Go!

1696
02:21:30,982 --> 02:21:32,711
I am dead now, isn't it?

1697
02:21:39,057 --> 02:21:40,854
You have to do the formalities
in your father's position

1698
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:43,017
Boys are there to take care
of the arrangements

1699
02:21:43,127 --> 02:21:44,424
Come on, sit here

1700
02:21:47,131 --> 02:21:49,656
Sprinkle water on fire and worship

1701
02:21:50,969 --> 02:21:54,063
Brother! Hold this!

1702
02:21:54,239 --> 02:21:55,570
Who gave this to you
before the wedding gets over?

1703
02:21:55,673 --> 02:21:58,141
- Who gave this?
- One uncle gave that to me

1704
02:21:58,243 --> 02:22:00,541
Don't stare! Give it to her

1705
02:22:00,645 --> 02:22:02,738
it's getting late! I have to send
bride to change wedding saree

1706
02:22:08,119 --> 02:22:10,144
I won't allow you to escape

1707
02:22:10,255 --> 02:22:13,588
Are you trying to escape
after giving the gift?

1708
02:22:13,691 --> 02:22:14,749
- Come on!
- Let me go

1709
02:22:14,859 --> 02:22:17,987
I won't mind even you talk in Hindi!
You should have lunch and move

1710
02:22:18,096 --> 02:22:20,425
You came for Velu's sister marriage
You shouldn't go with empty stomach

1711
02:22:20,431 --> 02:22:23,492
I am telling I don't want food
why do you compel me?

1712
02:22:25,603 --> 02:22:26,570
What is the problem?

1713
02:22:26,671 --> 02:22:29,435
I don't know what
I compelled him to have the feast

1714
02:22:29,541 --> 02:22:31,065
...and he slapped me heavily

1715
02:22:56,834 --> 02:22:58,426
What are you doing here?
Come out with me

1716
02:23:07,011 --> 02:23:11,209
- Come out!
- No, I won't come - it's okay!

1717
02:23:16,187 --> 02:23:20,681
Come on, kill me!
Why do you stare?

1718
02:23:20,858 --> 02:23:24,055
Your house will blast in few minutes

1719
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:26,294
Gift!

1720
02:23:29,801 --> 02:23:31,826
I gave you the gift of death

1721
02:23:32,804 --> 02:23:35,170
That day you have saved
lot of people from death

1722
02:23:35,273 --> 02:23:40,802
if you can save your family and villagers,
come on, go ahead

1723
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:44,713
Still one more minute
Go, die with your family

1724
02:23:50,121 --> 02:23:54,148
Brother...!
Why he has kept his mobile here?

1725
02:23:57,996 --> 02:24:00,487
Is it my brother Velayudham?

1726
02:24:37,669 --> 02:24:39,534
Brother, don't come near

1727
02:24:52,917 --> 02:24:54,976
Brother, you go away

1728
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:25,240
Oh my god!
What happened to you Cauvery?

1729
02:25:29,787 --> 02:25:34,850
Are you that Velayudham?
Are you alright?

1730
02:25:36,394 --> 02:25:39,363
Nothing should happen to you

1731
02:25:40,865 --> 02:25:47,865
I should be fortunate to be your sister

1732
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:55,670
Now I am the sister of Velayudham
who saves the entire place

1733
02:25:56,481 --> 02:25:59,075
I don't want anything else than that

1734
02:26:04,155 --> 02:26:06,180
Cauvery! Dear!

1735
02:26:19,437 --> 02:26:22,964
If the bomb had burst inside,
the entire village would've destroyed

1736
02:26:23,841 --> 02:26:28,039
She has sacrificed her life
to save this village people

1737
02:27:20,531 --> 02:27:23,261
I am going to share you a good news

1738
02:27:23,434 --> 02:27:28,030
The terrorist lbrahim who came to destroy
our country has died in an accident

1739
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:32,303
I'm going to produce Velayudham
before you all who caught him red handed

1740
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:33,968
Welcome you all

1741
02:27:34,078 --> 02:27:38,742
Minister Ulaganathan has invited all
to see Velayudham live

1742
02:27:38,916 --> 02:27:40,884
The information is spreading like fire

1743
02:27:41,118 --> 02:27:46,954
We expect a lot of people
will come to see him

1744
02:27:55,233 --> 02:27:56,564
Not one or two...

1745
02:27:57,001 --> 02:28:00,095
Millions of people will
throng in to meet Velayudham

1746
02:28:00,371 --> 02:28:03,499
They will be very eager to meet him

1747
02:28:03,608 --> 02:28:07,772
You shouldn't take any action
till I order you

1748
02:28:24,262 --> 02:28:27,254
Long live Velayudham!

1749
02:28:32,904 --> 02:28:36,362
What is this, Velu?
Who are they going to meet?

1750
02:28:36,741 --> 02:28:40,677
They should be aware
who the real Velayudham is

1751
02:31:31,215 --> 02:31:36,278
You have destroyed everything
like my wealth, weapons etc...

1752
02:31:36,387 --> 02:31:42,155
But you gave a more powerful weapon
in my hand instead of all this

1753
02:31:42,259 --> 02:31:43,851
That is the title Velayudham

1754
02:31:50,601 --> 02:31:56,631
You only know I am a terrorist
I am Velayudham for others

1755
02:31:57,641 --> 02:32:00,474
I came to destroy the peace of this nation

1756
02:32:01,779 --> 02:32:06,216
People are talking with courage and belief

1757
02:32:06,717 --> 02:32:08,651
You are the one who gave courage
and belief to them

1758
02:32:08,752 --> 02:32:12,745
if you destroy that yourself,
that will be a big destruction

1759
02:32:12,857 --> 02:32:17,988
No one should believe that one will come
to help them and save from danger

1760
02:32:20,264 --> 02:32:22,425
You have tortured us very much

1761
02:32:25,369 --> 02:32:28,497
Who is that idiot attacking me from behind?

1762
02:32:29,206 --> 02:32:30,867
If you have guts, come before me

1763
02:32:31,208 --> 02:32:32,539
I am not a coward

1764
02:32:33,544 --> 02:32:39,881
- Do you abuse me as coward?
- Ls this distance enough?

1765
02:32:49,627 --> 02:32:50,753
Give the tape to me

1766
02:32:52,062 --> 02:32:55,259
Talk to our Managing director and
ask him to telecast this live in the channel

1767
02:32:55,332 --> 02:32:57,823
I'll go to the stadium and
reveal it to everyone

1768
02:33:09,914 --> 02:33:10,710
Take care of her

1769
02:33:19,757 --> 02:33:23,625
Now Velayudham whom
you are eagerly waiting to meet...

1770
02:33:23,727 --> 02:33:29,893
...is going to appear before you all

1771
02:33:33,204 --> 02:33:34,637
Don't lose your life

1772
02:33:34,838 --> 02:33:38,638
You should see how they are going
to die who have believed you a lot

1773
02:33:40,778 --> 02:33:46,978
Your Velayudham is going to
appear here within few seconds

1774
02:33:47,218 --> 02:33:52,121
Here he is...
Velayudham

1775
02:34:03,234 --> 02:34:07,330
Here is your Velayudham

1776
02:34:21,385 --> 02:34:24,548
I know you all like Velayudham

1777
02:34:24,822 --> 02:34:28,690
But just now I came to know
you are madly affectionate with me

1778
02:34:28,926 --> 02:34:30,860
I am very happy about this

1779
02:34:32,096 --> 02:34:35,122
What I have done so far is nothing big

1780
02:34:35,266 --> 02:34:42,266
But today you're going to get satisfied fully
as you have believed a lot

1781
02:34:45,509 --> 02:34:48,000
No, he is not Velayudham

1782
02:34:52,516 --> 02:34:53,915
I am sure he is not Velayudham

1783
02:34:55,119 --> 02:34:56,586
I know his voice very well

1784
02:34:59,890 --> 02:35:04,486
- He is not Velayudham
- Yes, I am not Velayudham

1785
02:35:05,829 --> 02:35:08,855
I am the terrorist Musafir lbrahim

1786
02:35:12,202 --> 02:35:14,762
I came here to destroy your Chennai

1787
02:35:21,178 --> 02:35:23,840
Velayudham has saved you all from death

1788
02:35:24,048 --> 02:35:30,009
But today your Velayudham
is going to die with you

1789
02:35:31,021 --> 02:35:35,355
Brother...!

1790
02:36:47,531 --> 02:36:49,192
Nobody can escape from here alive

1791
02:36:49,299 --> 02:36:51,927
I have planted bomb
in every nook of this stadium

1792
02:36:56,673 --> 02:37:00,507
if I operate this remote,
the whole stadium will be destroyed

1793
02:37:22,499 --> 02:37:26,060
- Die all of you!
- Don't be hasty!

1794
02:37:33,143 --> 02:37:34,974
Let's move to a long distance
and press button

1795
02:37:35,446 --> 02:37:37,243
Search where is the
video out of stadium's LCD screen?

1796
02:37:45,522 --> 02:37:46,716
Here is the LCD out

1797
02:38:12,616 --> 02:38:14,481
Don't do! We will die

1798
02:40:49,139 --> 02:40:55,510
Stop it! You all came here
to meet Velayudham, isn't it?

1799
02:40:56,279 --> 02:40:58,247
Someone has tried to cheat you
as Velayudham

1800
02:40:58,348 --> 02:41:00,282
But you have believed his words
and decided to lose your life

1801
02:41:01,218 --> 02:41:03,709
You have started to praise when you see me

1802
02:41:04,154 --> 02:41:07,851
You want me to dump your problems
and are trying to escape, isn't it?

1803
02:41:08,258 --> 02:41:12,490
I thought Velayudham is someone else
and searched everywhere

1804
02:41:12,596 --> 02:41:14,860
But finally I found
Velayudham is not someone

1805
02:41:14,965 --> 02:41:18,423
...the guts inside me
is the real Velayudham

1806
02:41:19,302 --> 02:41:21,133
if I am not trying to make you aware...

1807
02:41:21,538 --> 02:41:25,872
No use of trusting me
and my effort will be a waste one

1808
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:30,571
Velayudham is a common thing
like the air we breathe

1809
02:41:31,348 --> 02:41:33,111
A girl explained this to me

1810
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:36,583
She has fought against the enemies
even in the last moment

1811
02:41:37,654 --> 02:41:40,646
The guts she had is the meaning
for Velayudham

1812
02:41:41,925 --> 02:41:48,160
My sister has sacrificed her life
to save me and my village

1813
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:54,669
The sacrifice which she did for us
is the meaning for Velayudham

1814
02:41:56,273 --> 02:41:59,674
Don't see my appearance and look
Try to give life for my emotions too

1815
02:42:00,343 --> 02:42:03,369
Once I was an ordinary milkman

1816
02:42:03,513 --> 02:42:06,141
When I realized myself
and proved guts is the only Velayudham

1817
02:42:06,883 --> 02:42:09,613
Can't you realize yourself?

1818
02:42:11,221 --> 02:42:12,745
We have food for our hunger

1819
02:42:12,889 --> 02:42:14,049
We sleep when we get tired

1820
02:42:14,224 --> 02:42:15,816
We enjoy our life

1821
02:42:16,359 --> 02:42:18,486
But when we are furious
and find some faults...

1822
02:42:18,595 --> 02:42:21,587
Why do we expect someone to fight for us?

1823
02:42:22,566 --> 02:42:25,592
No, we should fight for our rights

1824
02:42:26,236 --> 02:42:29,603
When we show our anger once
in 5 years the government changes

1825
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:34,108
Show your fury often
the politics will change

1826
02:42:35,378 --> 02:42:38,711
He said I can defuse the bomb
if he plants in one place

1827
02:42:38,882 --> 02:42:41,350
Will many Velayudhams come to defuse bomb,
if he plants bombs in many places?

1828
02:42:41,651 --> 02:42:47,112
We have to prove them thousands of
Velayudham will come to save the nation

1829
02:42:47,891 --> 02:42:49,950
He is right

1830
02:42:51,061 --> 02:42:55,327
Thank God! Velayudham has saved us
and our country from the terrorists

1831
02:42:55,432 --> 02:43:00,131
Let me show his words in action

1832
02:43:01,004 --> 02:43:05,202
We both have same thinking and
working style for people's welfare

1833
02:43:05,675 --> 02:43:09,611
I have killed the home minister
and came in this posting

1834
02:43:09,713 --> 02:43:11,476
He is not coming...

1835
02:43:11,615 --> 02:43:13,583
Reduce the population

1836
02:43:13,917 --> 02:43:16,977
I have planned to increase my bank balance

1837
02:43:17,754 --> 02:43:20,314
But why did you interfere
and spoil my plan?

1838
02:43:20,490 --> 02:43:23,220
Everything is going to get destroyed today

1839
02:43:23,393 --> 02:43:25,623
This stadium is surrounded
with full of bombs

1840
02:43:26,296 --> 02:43:31,632
We will fly somewhere
and destroy this land through remote

1841
02:43:31,735 --> 02:43:36,069
See this! He is an enemy but
he was faithful to his nation

1842
02:43:36,773 --> 02:43:40,903
But he is a traitor who
betrays his own nation

1843
02:43:42,145 --> 02:43:43,612
I have killed our enemy

1844
02:43:43,914 --> 02:43:45,939
How are you going to punish him?

1845
02:43:47,117 --> 02:43:49,551
Hey, thrash him!

1846
02:43:55,392 --> 02:43:57,519
Get down!

1847
02:43:57,544 --> 02:44:01,544
