1
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,440
'The evolution of man
towards civilisation'

2
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
'was an outcome of his
inner desire to evolve.'

3
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,400
'He used the violent flames
of fire to give him light.'

4
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,440
'However a burning desire
is all it took to consume him.'

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,680
'Lust, anger, greed,
attachment, pride and envy'

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,680
'consumed him like
a raging fire.'

7
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,960
'Instead of emitting
a bright, pleasant light'

8
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,840
'this resulted in
a violent inferno.'

9
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,120
'This inferno does not mark
the beginning of this story'

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,800
'rather it is the end.
The reason for this end..'

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
"Desire is the root.."

12
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
"Desire is the root.."

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,440
"Desire.."

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
"Excess of desire.."

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,080
"Excess of desires
leads to greed."

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,520
"Greed.."

17
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,080
"Yes.."

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,320
It is said that desire is
the root of all suffering.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,040
But a human life
is filled with desires.

20
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,000
Upon childbirth,
the desire for celebration.

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,160
If it's a baby girl, we desire
a good groom for her in life.

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
If it's a baby boy, we desire
a good bride for him in life.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,160
After getting married,
we desire to have children.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,720
If it's a baby girl,
we desire to have a boy.

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
Hey, pay attention.

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,200
Hence every person
will always have a desire

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,640
blossoming in his heart.

28
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,760
So is it possible
to lead a life without desires?

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,200
Tell me.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,200
Right.. It's not possible.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,680
It's impossible for any creature
to not have desires.

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,760
That's because

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,440
the Almighty who created us has
created these desires as well.

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Hey!

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,760
He is speaking such wise words.
Stop dozing off. Listen to him.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Oh.. He's been paid for it.
That's why he's speaking.

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,040
If you don't give him the money

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,680
forget the discourse,
he won't speak up at all.

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,480
Hey! Shut up! We haven't
paid to listen to him.

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,400
He fools some people for money

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,680
but he fools us
as we are already fools.

42
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Isn't that done?

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
Darn your evil tongue.

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,560
Why do you say such things?

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,280
It comes naturally.
I can't help it.

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
Shut up!

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,640
Lust is blind

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,520
similarly there is no end
to desires.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We are born out of lust.

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,960
And desire is the root
of lust as well.

51
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Lust is innate and so is desire.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,680
But, as humans, as citizens

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,680
our lust, our desires

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,560
should be anchored.

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,120
Otherwise

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,960
there won't be any difference
between a human and a beast.

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
Look..

58
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
He says desire is innate and
he also tells us to anchor it.

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Tell him to look into my eyes
for a moment.

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,560
Let me see if he gives in to
lust or anchors his desires.

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,040
Darn your thoughts!

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,000
You'll bring disgrace to me.
Let's go home.

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
Hey, we're leaving. Let's go.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Where did you get this?
- I found it on the way

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,560
it was quite appealing.
I plucked it.

66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,720
Won't it be great if all
fruits are available so easily?

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,240
You are impossible.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,840
Your words and the discourse..

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,400
I don't get anything.
- You were praising him back then.

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,760
He's an elder, a learned person.
He must have said good things.

71
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Even lies sound good. Right?
- Shut up.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,400
Mom, he spoke for
hours at a stretch.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,680
You didn't shut him up.

74
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,480
We still have a long way to go.

75
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,040
I am speaking to kill time
and you want to shut me up.

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,760
Darn! Will you please shut up!

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,880
Your father must be waiting.

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,480
Your drunkard husband must be
waiting for you, not me.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,120
Had I found someone
who would wait for me..

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,880
Had you got me married, even
I'd have been a mother by now.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
Just like my friends.
They have borne so many children

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
as if there's no better work
left for them now.

83
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,720
Darn!

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,920
Hey! Stop!

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,880
Hey, Malli!

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Hey, Malli.
- Yes.

87
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,520
Everything happens at a time.

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,080
At a destined time.

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,680
The house won't come to us,
we need to go to it.

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,240
Similarly, we need to get
to the suitable time in life

91
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,720
instead of rotting in one place.

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,640
Why are you staring at me?
I know you didn't get it.

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,520
What kind of a mother are you?
You have been through my age

94
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,640
but you can't understand
my state of mind.

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
Hey..

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,120
Well..
- Stop it, Mom.

97
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Come on.

98
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Hey..

99
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
Oh..

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,960
Dad..

101
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,280
Dad..
- Coming..

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey..
- Oh.. - What happened?

103
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
Are you experiencing pain?
- Yes, Dad.

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
I'm scared, Dad.
- Oh..

105
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,840
That's why I told you
to be with her at night.

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
Kempa!

107
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,840
Kempa!

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,480
Some more time..

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,520
Hey.. Go call Ms. Gowramma.

110
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Okay.
- Hey! Stop.

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
It may get late.
Let's take her there.

112
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,200
You think so?

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,920
Okay. Kempa, get the vehicle.

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Okay, sir.

115
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,000
Sleep now.

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,680
Hey, Malli!

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I heard a vehicle's noise.

118
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,680
There's no peace in our lives.

119
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,480
Oh..
- Careful, dear.. - Oh..

120
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,080
Careful.. - It's paining a lot.
We have reached.. We have..

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
Dad..
- We have reached.

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,040
Mom.
- The vehicle from the mansion.

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,200
Oh.. Sarso is expecting.

124
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,680
She must be in labour pain.
I'll go boil some water

125
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,400
you get the knife
to cut the umbilical cord.

126
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,840
Also get castor oil. Go fast!

127
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,160
Oh..
- Muthanna..

128
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,400
I can't bear this pain.
- Hey.. Muthanna.

129
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,240
Make it fast..
- Wake up. Sir is here.

130
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Call Gowramma.

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,280
Muthanna..
- Hey..

132
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,280
Get up..

133
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
Muthanna.
- Oh.. I'll sit here.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,080
Dad..

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
He won't wake up.
Greetings, sir.

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,280
Come, dear..

137
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
Be careful.

138
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,640
Slowly..

139
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,600
Don't worry, dear..

140
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,880
Come on..

141
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
Oh..

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,280
It's done, dear..

143
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
Bear the pain..
- I can't.. - It'll be done.

144
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Hold your breath..
Yes.. Like that..

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,480
Why are you shouting?
I won't drink..

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
Mom!

147
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,800
It's paining..
- It's done.

148
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,560
Just a moment.. Push it..

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
It's done.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,920
It's done, dear.

151
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,800
Dear, don't be scared.
It's done.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Malli, hold her hand.

153
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
Mom.. Oh..

154
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,880
God, I'll die..

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,240
You may drink tomorrow
instead of dying.

156
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,040
Just sleep for now. Sleep..
- Oh, God!

157
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,680
Malli, tell your father
to shut up.

158
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,760
He won't oblige so easily.
Just focus on your job.

159
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
Hey..
- Mom..

160
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,560
Mom.. I can't bear it.

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
You can..

162
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,360
Mom.. Oh.. I'll die..
- Bear it, dear.

163
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,160
Just once.. Just once,
push hard. - I can't.

164
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,200
Yes..

165
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
Malli, get that..

166
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh..
- It's done..

167
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,280
It's done, dear..
- Oh..

168
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Darn you useless soul..

169
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,960
You cry like a baby, I swear..

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,200
From tomorrow, I won't drink..

171
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
You did a great favour.

172
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,600
Not at all. I have helped
many women in childbirth.

173
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,160
Well..

174
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,200
God has sent me into this world
to do this noble deed.

175
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,600
It's a noble act

176
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,680
to help bring a life
into this world.

177
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,960
Oh.. The baby is so beautiful.

178
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,360
It has taken after you.

179
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,320
The mother is lucky if
the baby boy resembles her.

180
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,760
"Sleep, my baby.
Sleep, the apple of my eyes.."

181
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:29,520
"Sleep, my baby.
Sleep, the apple of my eyes.."

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,400
"Your mother showers
her affection on you.."

183
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,640
"She rocks you gently.."

184
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,720
"Her affection is boundless.
She toils hard for you."

185
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,520
"She won't let you cry."

186
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,040
"Your chuckles are
music to her ears."

187
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,720
"May you grow up
to realise all her dreams."

188
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,600
"You are the world to her."

189
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,960
"You are her life."

190
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,920
"Your birth has filled
her life with joy."

191
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,640
"Sleep, my baby.
Sleep, the apple of my eyes.."

192
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,840
"You are her sunshine.."

193
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,000
"You are her darling.."

194
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,240
"She nurtures and raises you
in the best of ways."

195
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,000
"She takes pains and troubles
to nourish you."

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,960
"Don't you forget these favours
one to you."

197
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,120
"To nurture you, she
even ignored her hunger."

198
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,720
"She was worried for you
and your well-being."

199
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,920
"And for ensuring the best
for you, she strived hard."

200
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,480
"Sleep, my baby.
Sleep, the apple of my eyes.."

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,200
"Sleep, my baby.
Sleep, the apple of my eyes.."

202
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,400
Mister..

203
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,800
Is anybody here?

204
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
The shoes have been
left here unattended.

205
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,360
I don't think anyone is around.

206
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
Are you far away?

207
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,440
Oh God!

208
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,680
Have you left your luggage here

209
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,200
and committed suicide
by jumping into these waters?

210
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,080
Hey! Somebody is drowning,
please help.

211
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,600
Sir!

212
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,160
Help.

213
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,880
Somebody, help!

214
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,040
Hey! Why are you shouting?

215
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,160
Has something grave happened?

216
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,240
Oh.. So you are alive.

217
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Well, I've been calling out to
you since long

218
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,200
you didn't notice.

219
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,360
I was underwater,
hence I couldn't see you.

220
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,960
I can't see you
no matter where you are.

221
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,720
What were you doing here?

222
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,480
It's Yoga.

223
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
Holding your breath under water.

224
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,800
Oh.. That's just like
Duryodhana from Mahabharata.

225
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,160
Yoga under water.

226
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
You seem to be quite learned.

227
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I am blind,
but I am fond of learning.

228
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,960
Sir, perhaps you are new
to this place.

229
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,160
Not only to this place.

230
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,040
I am new to every place I visit.

231
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,840
I go in search of new things

232
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,880
enjoy the natural beauty

233
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,560
and go from one
village to another.

234
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,080
You may call me a gypsy.
- Gypsy?

235
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,720
If you keep wandering,
how do you earn a living?

236
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,720
I have earned more than
what is needed to lead a life.

237
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
It is enough,
so I am wandering.

238
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,840
I pray for your journey
to continue further.

239
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,200
What's your name?
- Channakeshava.

240
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,680
What's your name?
- My name is Kannappa.

241
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,920
I know what your next
question would be.

242
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,880
'Who named you this?'

243
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,480
I did the honours.

244
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,560
In case my name impresses God
at some point

245
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,840
He will restore my eyesight
in an instant.

246
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,560
May your wish come true.

247
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,840
Well, one who carries a pen
need not be a writer

248
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,040
one who carries
a gun need not be a shooter.

249
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,360
Do you only sell flutes
or can you even play one?

250
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,560
There are many people
like me who sell flutes

251
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,760
but I am different.

252
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,480
I should be content
with whatever I earn

253
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,880
so I play these flutes
while I sell them.

254
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,320
Alright, let me see you
play a melodious tune for me.

255
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,360
That's amazing.
Will you hear it or see it?

256
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,680
I'll see you play
and hear your tunes. Go on.

257
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,120
Okay.

258
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,360
Wealth is knocking
at your door..

259
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,760
Sir.. Sir, listen to my advice.

260
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
You may consider
it to be truth or a lie.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,960
It can't be a lie
because I am not just saying it.

262
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,480
I am saying it because
of a divine intervention.

263
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,840
You may suspect why I have been
chosen to convey it to you.

264
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,880
I'll tell you why.

265
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
Because I, Malinga

266
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,880
am the son of the Almighty,
sir. I am His son.

267
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,880
Son of the Almighty?
The one who resides in heaven?

268
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,320
Of course, sir..

269
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,920
Ours is the land
of various arts.

270
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,360
Nagamangala, Mandya, Mysuru..

271
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,920
If you visit my village
and say that I lied to you.

272
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,720
My family, my extended family
and everyone who knows me

273
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,720
will thrash me and kill me.

274
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,520
Hey, you. We have no time
to listen to you

275
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,880
or give you any alms.
Please leave.

276
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
Don't say that, ma'am..

277
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,160
Lady luck is about
to smile on you.

278
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
Hey! Stop it..

279
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,040
Lady luck?

280
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,240
Come inside.

281
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,520
Hey! Search the entire house

282
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
if you find any money,
I'll share it with you.

283
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,080
Darned guy..
- Don't say that, sir..

284
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,000
Indeed lady luck is about
to smile on you.

285
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,640
If you don't listen to me,
you'll lose a fortune..

286
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,560
Darn this guy..

287
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Hey, you..

288
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,480
No matter how much I pray,
nothing works.

289
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,720
In this scorching sun, while
I am working, why pester me?

290
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,040
Don't annoy us.

291
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,400
Don't say that, sir..

292
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,400
If I dare say a lie,
the Goddess will destroy me.

293
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,920
The Goddess will grant you
a boon, today.

294
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,040
I am here to tell you
to make the most of it.

295
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,200
Will She grant a boon?
- Yes.

296
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,200
Will she shower money on us?

297
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes..

298
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,240
You will surely witness
a flood of riches.

299
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,600
You need to make the most of it.

300
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,480
Instead of ignoring it,
believe me, sir.

301
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,160
Okay.

302
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,440
How big a pit should we dig
to safely bury the riches?

303
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,600
Hey.. What's that?

304
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Why talk to him?
- Look at him..

305
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,720
Hey! Didn't I tell you to leave?

306
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
Hey! Who's that?

307
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,400
Just leave..
- Yes..

308
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Otherwise I'll pull your tongue
out and feed it to our dog.

309
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,520
Anyway it craves for
meat on Wednesdays.

310
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,080
Well, my tongue is
my source of earning..

311
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,000
Hey..
Shut up and leave!

312
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,840
No matter what you say,
God will grant us only rags.

313
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,840
Yes, dear.. You are in rags.

314
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,520
But it is up to you
whether you create riches

315
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,080
out of them or let
them remain as rags.

316
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,200
Rags that you don't value..

317
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,440
Rags that will
change your destiny.

318
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Hey! How dare you curse us
to live in rags!

319
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,120
Leave while you still can

320
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,320
otherwise I'll set you on fire!
Darn his curse! Get lost!

321
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,400
He is scared.

322
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,960
Sir.

323
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,480
Hey, go..

324
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Who are you? Where are you from?

325
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
Please give me some
water to drink.

326
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
Come.

327
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,800
Thanks a lot.

328
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,360
You appear to have
come from the city.

329
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
You look educated.
What brings you here?

330
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
Ma'am, my name is Channakeshava.

331
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,320
I travel to places, write about
the uniqueness that exists there

332
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
and publish it.
- Oh..

333
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,000
I am also a cartoonist.

334
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,280
Oh, you make harpoons
for newspaper.

335
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,400
Not harpoons, it's cartoons.
That reminds me..

336
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,960
While I was coming,
I was given this sacrament

337
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,760
at the temple.
Please take it.

338
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
It's for you. Keep it.

339
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,200
Never mind, please take it.

340
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,120
One should always share it.

341
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
Give it.

342
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,600
Ma'am, please don't mind.
I am very tired.

343
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,000
I am told it'll be night by the
time I reach the next village.

344
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Can I stay here for tonight?

345
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,400
Don't think that I am taking
undue advantage

346
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,240
of your hospitality.

347
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,240
Well..

348
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
It's a poor house.

349
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,840
If you walk till the evening,
you'll reach a village

350
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,400
where there are
many millionaires.

351
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,200
They'll provide you
with all the comforts.

352
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
You won't find them here.

353
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,360
A morsel to eat, a cup of water
and a roof over head

354
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
are all one needs.
This is what I have heard.

355
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,000
The millionaires
may provide luxuries

356
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,720
but I prefer to sleep
under the open sky.

357
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,040
I won't cause you
people any trouble.

358
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
I won't cause you any expenses.

359
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,840
Share with me the food you eat.

360
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,960
I'll sleep in the courtyard.

361
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
Okay, I got it.

362
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,880
You are scared to provide
shelter to a stranger

363
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,360
as you have an unmarried
daughter at home.

364
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,720
What? What did you say?
Fear?

365
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,360
There is no other house
for miles.

366
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,320
Nobody will come to help us
if anything untoward happens.

367
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
People call me
the lonely Muthanna.

368
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,480
I am neither scared
of beasts nor humans.

369
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Nothing scares me.

370
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,640
I am hesitant because
you are a stranger.

371
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Right, Malli?

372
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,400
We don't have enough money
give alms to anyone

373
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,040
but we do have enough food
to share with another person.

374
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,280
Right, Malli?

375
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,000
Hey.. Why do both of you
always ask me?

376
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,400
You may host him.

377
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
Or oust him.

378
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,840
Okay, come inside, dear.

379
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,200
Never mind,
I'll stay here in the courtyard.

380
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
It's okay, come right in.

381
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,840
The sky is quite visible
from the inside as well.

382
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,520
What's this, sir?
You are making dung cakes.

383
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,600
Only if I do this,
do I get to drink.

384
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,360
Do you drink?
- Oh.. I don't.

385
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,400
I am not referring to alcohol,
I mean to say coffee or tea.

386
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,120
Oh that.. - Yes..
- Yes, I do drink those.

387
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,160
Do you?

388
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
Hey, Gowramma..

389
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,880
Tea.. He wants tea.

390
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,040
A while ago, he said he'd
eat anything we offer.

391
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
Now he's ordering for a tea.

392
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,800
Not him, but your father is
the one who's ordering it.

393
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,120
Dear..

394
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,680
We have milk.
We don't have tea leaves.

395
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,840
We are poor people. We don't
have sugar, but jaggery.

396
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
Come on, Gowramma.

397
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,200
Don't say that in
front of our guest.

398
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,760
He is tired. Give me some money,
I'll get some tea leaves.

399
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,760
What?
I know who's craving for tea.

400
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,920
You have money on you.
Buy tea leaves with it.

401
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,360
I don't want tea.

402
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,960
It's a petty amount.
Here you go.

403
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,760
Well, you are a guest here.

404
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,720
Taking money from you..

405
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,680
Never mind, take it, sir.

406
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,040
Keep it.
- Shall I accompany you?

407
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,440
My cycle won't be able
to take it.

408
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,400
You can't come. Stay here.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

409
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,920
Do you want something else?
- Dad!

410
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
With the remaining money,
buy some sweets.

411
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,680
Hey.. Why are you staring at me?

412
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,280
Won't I make tea for you?
I am the one who milks the cows.

413
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,520
Hey, shut up!

414
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,800
I'll put the clothes up for
drying, go milk the cows.

415
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,920
Hey! Don't you dare drink
all the milk.

416
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,760
You'll leave nothing for us.

417
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,680
You are quite a mischief.
Stay here.

418
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Shouldn't I milk the cow?

419
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,080
Hey.. Just because I dragged
your calf away

420
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,960
don't you dare kick me.
Otherwise you'll lose your leg.

421
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll break it.

422
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,680
Is your name Malli?
- What?

423
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,240
It's Mallika,
my parents call me Malli.

424
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,720
So should I address you
as 'Malli' or 'Mallika'?

425
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,080
It's your choice.
As of now, let me milk the cow.

426
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,360
Okay, Mallika?

427
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,560
What's this?

428
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,960
What?
- This.

429
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,560
Oh that..
It's used for exercising.

430
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
Who exercises here?

431
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,120
My father does,
when he's unable to make out.

432
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,840
What?

433
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,080
For stamina, I mean.

434
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,960
You are from the city. You
may not have seen this stuff.

435
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,880
Darn..

436
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,400
You have no respect.
Hey.. - Coming.

437
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,120
Take this.

438
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,440
Hey..
- Yes.

439
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,400
Some sweets. Get me a spanner.
- Yes..

440
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,600
You never run properly.

441
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,320
Darn..

442
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,880
Come here..

443
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,520
Take the tea.

444
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,560
It's hot.

445
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,840
'Smoking is injurious
to health.'

446
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,160
The tea is great. Thanks.

447
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
Thanks to you too.
- Why?

448
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,680
Dad got sweets
in the remaining money.

449
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,440
Really?

450
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,320
Even I like sweets?
- Shall I get it? - No..

451
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,280
The tea will taste bland
if I eat it now.

452
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,720
Quite impressive.

453
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,560
I thought you are
a delicate darling.

454
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,680
But you do work out.

455
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,200
But those who work out
shouldn't drink tea.

456
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,720
What else should we drink?
- You should drink milk.

457
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,080
Tell me if you want some,
I'll get it for you.

458
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,120
I said, I'll get it for you.

459
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,480
Who's that screaming?
- Retard.

460
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,400
Do you have such names here?

461
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,400
We don't but that's
how some people act.

462
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,480
You may have the tea.

463
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,760
Hey, Malli..

464
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Veeranna is here. Come.

465
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
You stay here, dear. Come on..

466
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,760
I don't see..

467
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,200
Useless fellow.
What work did you have?

468
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,960
Don't you know that
you have to water one field?

469
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Yesterday, the priest told me

470
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,240
not to leave the
house at that time so..

471
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,800
I knew it.
I knew you would say this.

472
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,200
Why do you believe in this
rubbish when it comes to work?

473
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,880
All I care about is money.

474
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,800
If my crop is ruined,
who will be responsible for it?

475
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,200
Look, I'll tolerate it
to a certain extent.

476
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,000
You know what I'll do later.

477
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,720
I won't regard..
- What are you saying, Veeranna?

478
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
You are staking claim
to the land and crop.

479
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,600
We couldn't repay the loan

480
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,160
hence we had to mortgage
our land to you.

481
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,880
We aren't your slaves.
Don't talk rubbish.

482
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,080
Ma'am,
I didn't mean to say that.

483
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,160
If this continues, who
will take care of you?

484
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,120
What about your
daughter's future?

485
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,760
That's why I am advising..
- Yes.. Stop it.

486
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,960
Are you so wise to advise him?

487
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,920
Everyone knows about you.

488
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,200
Well, the loan which he had
availed, has become a problem

489
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,840
for all of you.

490
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,080
It's not like we don't have
a solution for this problem.

491
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,480
You need to be willing
to take my advice.

492
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,960
But he won't listen to me.

493
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,880
Darned cur!

494
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
You lick my hand!

495
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,240
A dog should know its place.

496
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,160
Look at its evil face.

497
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,080
Mr. Veeranna, I will send dad
regularly to work from tomorrow.

498
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,960
You seem to be feeling the heat.

499
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,640
It's quite sunny.

500
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Go home and have
some refreshments.

501
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
You cur! Drink it up!

502
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,560
Dad!
- Yes.

503
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,400
What are you
tapping at since long?

504
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,640
No work can be done quietly.

505
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,680
I know you can do certain things
quietly. - Hey..

506
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,920
Ma'am.
- Yes. - The tea was good.

507
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,040
Your hospitality and care
enriched the tea's taste.

508
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,120
Just one cup of tea
and you are singing praises.

509
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,920
A motherless child like me

510
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,880
will value any little
affection it gets.

511
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,120
Sir..
- Yes.

512
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,160
I want to ask you.

513
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,000
The one who was shouting..

514
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
It appears like he has
tormented you a lot.

515
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,640
May I know the reason for this?

516
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,000
Poverty..

517
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,640
Hold this.

518
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
A farmer's life is hard.

519
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,640
There are nine acres
surrounding this house.

520
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,080
They all belong to me.

521
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,480
We were leading a life.

522
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,320
But God had planned
hard times for us.

523
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,880
Can't help.

524
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,960
So we are just
putting up with life.

525
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,840
Illnesses brought in extra
expenses

526
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,720
along with them.

527
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,680
We got buried under debt.

528
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,160
We couldn't repay the interest.

529
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,440
So we had to mortgage
this house and the land

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,560
to Veeranna.

531
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,720
A life worse than death..

532
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,560
It goes on.

533
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,200
Leave it.

534
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,480
Now, we are working in
our own fields like slaves.

535
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,000
I wonder when we
will repay the debt

536
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,960
and free ourselves.

537
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
These thoughts haunt me.

538
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,280
There seems to be no way out.

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,120
You will find a way out.
For sure.

540
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,920
All your problems will end.

541
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,520
When? After I age?

542
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,720
Ma'am. - Yes.
- How much money do you need

543
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,800
to repay your debt?

544
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,120
Why ask that, dear?

545
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,120
Please tell me, ma'am.

546
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,840
A principle amount of Rs. 25,000
and an interest of Rs. 35,000.

547
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,520
Hey! We do have problems.

548
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,320
But we don't need your alms.

549
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,120
I didn't mean that, Mallika.

550
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,840
I am an orphan.

551
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,840
I struggled hard
and earned this money.

552
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,880
You have courage
and are noble at heart.

553
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,040
Money comes and goes.

554
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,400
My money can be
yours in future.

555
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,160
Nothing is impossible.

556
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,520
Belief and perseverance
are important virtues.

557
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,520
You have sheltered a stranger.

558
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,000
This nobility of yours
will repay your rich dividends.

559
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,360
I didn't come to
give this to you.

560
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,920
When an orphan like
me can earn so much

561
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,560
you can earn much more.
I intend to inspire you.

562
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,560
If I have made a mistake,
please forgive me.

563
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
No need to apologise, dear.

564
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
It is quite evident that you
have struggled hard to earn it.

565
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,720
That's ominous!

566
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,880
Malli!
- Yes.. - Go take a bath.

567
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,280
Even you. Keep this inside
and go take a bath.

568
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,000
Why, ma'am? - If a lizard
falls on you, better bathe.

569
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,200
Hey, go!

570
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,320
"Madhava, the one
who plays soulful tunes."

571
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,280
"Madhava, the one who enchants."

572
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,360
"Madhava, the one
who plays soulful tunes."

573
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,200
"Madhava, the one who enchants."

574
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,160
"Take me in a trance."

575
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,160
"I have been waiting for you."

576
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,320
"I am in the awe of you."

577
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,240
"I am drawn towards you
ceaselessly."

578
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,480
"The divine embodiment
of my endearment."

579
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,880
"I have nobody but you.
You are my only hope."

580
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,160
"Appear before me,
cause no delay."

581
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,320
"My beloved.."

582
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,000
"Madhava, the one
who plays soulful tunes."

583
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,920
"Madhava, the one who enchants."

584
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,960
"This youth of mine seeks you."

585
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,920
"I am lost in your thoughts.."

586
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,840
"My desires are boundless
and overwhelming."

587
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,280
"As a mortal being,
no matter how appealing I am"

588
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,160
"if I don't attain you,
it's all in vain."

589
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,480
"Help me attain fulfilment."

590
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,000
"Help me attain peace."

591
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,600
"The touch of yours
is all I crave for."

592
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,760
"Come, fulfil my desires."

593
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,320
"My life is incomplete
without you."

594
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,320
"Come to me, my beloved."

595
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,480
"Madhava, the one
who plays soulful tunes."

596
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,320
"Madhava, the one who enchants."

597
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,320
"Take me in a trance."

598
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,360
"I have been waiting for you."

599
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,440
"I am in the awe of you."

600
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:57,520
"The divine embodiment
of my endearment."

601
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,040
"I have nobody but you.
You are my only hope."

602
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,760
"Appear before me,
cause no delay."

603
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,880
"My beloved.."

604
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,680
How long will you take?
You should've been done by now.

605
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,000
Okay, Mom. I am coming.

606
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,760
Your dad and I are going
to the fields.

607
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,440
Okay.. Be back soon.

608
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,520
Make sure that you do
only farming chores.

609
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,880
Shut up! You are too much.

610
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,320
Be careful.

611
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,520
I said, be careful!

612
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,320
I know what you are
trying to imply.

613
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,560
Don't you know me?

614
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,680
Oh.. I know you.
Shouldn't you assure me?

615
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,080
I'll be back.

616
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,040
Had I known that the lizard
would fall on you

617
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,320
I'd have heated water
for you to bathe.

618
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,840
You may not be used
to bathing with cold water.

619
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,160
I am used to it.

620
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,840
One doesn't get hot
water everywhere.

621
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Lakes, rivers, wells..
I bathe wherever I can.

622
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,240
Do you believe such things?

623
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,840
I mean,
the lizard falling and all..

624
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,360
I don't know if such beliefs
are completely true or not.

625
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,320
But they do have a noble
intention behind them.

626
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,560
Moreover your mother
emphasised on it.

627
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,160
You do look tough,
but are soft from within.

628
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,200
So are you.

629
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,240
Although you are a motor-mouth

630
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,360
you do have divine traits.
- Oh, stop lying.

631
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,880
To appear divine, one should
be decked up in jewellery.

632
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,760
And not be as rugged as me.

633
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,040
That's not a problem.
Wear the jewellery that I have.

634
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,960
Oh no!

635
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,560
Well.. I wish to wear them once.

636
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,120
Shall I wear them once
and return them to you?

637
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,000
Is that all?

638
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,600
Oh..
- What happened?

639
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,000
I got pricked by a barbed wire.
It's hurting.

640
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,000
Where?

641
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,920
Hey!

642
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,800
What are you doing!

643
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,880
You are behaving in this
manner in front of a stranger!

644
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,320
Aren't you ashamed?

645
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,480
What have I done?
- You do all this

646
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,000
and act innocent.

647
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,080
I have been observing
ever since I came here

648
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,280
your glances are
quite inappropriate.

649
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,440
You have evil designs.

650
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,240
If an adolescent girl
behaves in this manner, she's..

651
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,760
Hey..
- Is that right?

652
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,920
No..
- I had hurt my leg.

653
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,160
I raised my dress to
show you the wound.

654
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,760
Not to seduce you
by showing my skin.

655
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,040
I asked for the jewellery

656
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,040
and this is how you
treat me for it.

657
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,120
It's true that my
youth is being wasted.

658
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,440
I haven't learnt how to stop it
from being wasted.

659
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
I'll never be able to do that.

660
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,440
Mallika.

661
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,240
If my words have hurt you

662
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,600
please forgive me.

663
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,040
Never mind.

664
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,680
It shows that your character
is noble.

665
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,840
The events that occurred
weren't objectionable in nature.

666
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,080
I wish they were.

667
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,920
What?
- Nothing.

668
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,840
Haven't your parents
returned yet?

669
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,440
They will return in some time.

670
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,840
Hey! - Yes.. - Why are you
playing after dark?

671
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,920
Keep it inside, it's ominous!

672
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,800
The omen won't vanish
the moment I keep it in.

673
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,840
Darn! Is this how a girl
should behave?

674
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,800
Will you leave now?

675
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,080
Darned girl!

676
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,880
Listen!

677
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,560
Hey, Channakeshava!
- Yes, ma'am.

678
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,040
Ma'am, did you call me?
- Yes..

679
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,840
I am making
'Ragi Roti' for dinner.

680
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,400
How many will you have?

681
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,200
Rotis?

682
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,520
Okay. - Don't think.
They will be tasty.

683
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,480
I know.
- Okay, I'll make Rotis.

684
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,360
Ma'am..
- Yes.

685
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,800
I told you that I'll eat
whatever you offer.

686
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
So now please don't mind
if I ask for something.

687
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,280
I wish to have chicken curry
made by you.

688
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,080
Will you make 'Ragi Mudde'
and chicken curry?

689
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,160
What is it?

690
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,960
Chicken curry?

691
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,840
After seeing a rooster
if you ask for chicken curry

692
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,600
it's not done..
- Sir..

693
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,000
You don't worry.

694
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,440
I'll pay you for
the required ingredients.

695
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,840
Tell me the amount.

696
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,960
Including my expenses,
it comes up to Rs. 50.

697
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,360
Dear..
- Quiet..

698
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,000
Take Rs. 200.

699
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,880
Rs. 200!

700
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,400
Take it.
Buy whatever you want, at once.

701
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,880
Well..
- Give it.

702
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,760
Return it.
- No..

703
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Why are you embarrassing us
by giving us the money?

704
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,680
Oh no! It's not like that.

705
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,560
I felt like having it,
so I was paying for it.

706
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,400
Hey, let it be. He wishes
for it. Make it for him.

707
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,600
I'll get it, dear.
What all do you want?

708
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,720
You'll never obey me.
- Okay, tell me.

709
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,720
Okay.

710
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,040
A chili.. We have coconut.
Get the remaining items.

711
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,960
Okay, get it ready.
- Yes..

712
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,640
I'll get it.
- Hey, Malli! Come here.

713
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,720
Sir..

714
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,600
Yes..

715
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,720
Do you want something else?
- No..

716
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,040
I want to answer nature's call.
I don't know where to go.

717
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,280
There's ample space at the rear.

718
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,560
Go there.
Do carry a lantern along.

719
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,520
The animals won't come close.
Otherwise they may harm you.

720
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,240
Go.. You seem to
be in a hurry. Go..

721
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,880
He's been holding
it in since long.

722
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,680
'The Goddess will grant
you a boon today.'

723
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,840
'You must make
optimum use of it.'

724
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,960
'Instead of crying over it
when it's gone'

725
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,880
'grab it while you still can.'

726
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,440
Why are you wearing a long face?

727
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
Did you feel bad because
I asked you to stop playing?

728
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,360
I don't take offense
to the nonsense you say. - Oh..

729
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,200
This arrogance is what I hate.

730
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,080
Are you done with it?
Don't overdo it.

731
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,040
Mom.

732
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,800
Have you ever given anyone
more money than he asked for?

733
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,600
You think I am mad.

734
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,880
Have you?

735
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,120
Then why did he?

736
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,000
I don't think that's
his hard-earned money.

737
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,880
He said that he has earned
and saved it.

738
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,600
I don't think so.

739
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,680
Nobody spends money blindly.

740
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,400
He is enjoying
somebody else's money.

741
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,840
I doubt..

742
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,240
This is not his
hard-earned money.

743
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,240
He has stolen it.

744
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,640
Hey!

745
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,960
If he overhears it..

746
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,920
He has gone towards
the backyard.

747
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,960
No matter how he has earned it.

748
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,160
Why should we care?
- If we do nothing about it

749
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,680
we'll remain where we are.

750
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,400
We'll never progress in life.

751
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,600
So?

752
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,160
His money and jewellery..

753
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,200
What if we get to have it?

754
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,080
How is that possible?

755
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,600
It belongs to his,
only if he is alive.

756
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,240
But if he's dead..

757
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,440
He said that the sacrament
was destined for us.

758
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,360
I say that all his riches

759
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,200
are destined for us.

760
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,640
Slaughter the chicken for curry

761
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,560
while I take care of him.

762
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,720
You have lost it!
- Yes, I have!

763
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,080
I have been overcome by desire.

764
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,480
You have no worries.
Your life is going smoothly.

765
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,320
But no one understands my agony.

766
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,880
If needs are not met
when they should've been

767
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,280
then what's the use of life?

768
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,000
Look.

769
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,000
I can't be more straightforward.
You won't like it.

770
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,280
There is only one way to
solve all our problems.

771
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,440
That is to kill him!

772
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,200
Hey..

773
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,440
If you object to it even now..

774
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,960
Veeranna has an eye on me.

775
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,280
In order to repay your debt,
I'll marry him.

776
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,320
Hey, Malli..

777
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,840
In that case..

778
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,400
You think we should kill him?

779
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,320
Don't you remember what the
soothsayer said this morning?

780
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,760
'It is up to you
whether you create riches'

781
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,280
'out of rags or let
them remain as such.'

782
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,480
Not just that.

783
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,960
Later in the day

784
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,480
a lizard fell on his right hand.

785
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,440
You always say that
it is a good omen

786
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,840
if it happens in
a particular manner.

787
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,120
Lizard falling on the right hand
of a man brings death.

788
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,320
So here we are..

789
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,880
We should kill him.

790
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,240
That's..

791
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,320
That's destined to happen.

792
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,040
Hey, Malli..

793
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,280
I-I am scared.

794
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,360
Gowramma.

795
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,960
I have got 200 gram
of coriander.

796
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,720
Do you know what she's saying?

797
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,440
A bunch of coriander leaves
and curry leaves.

798
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,240
I am saying something.
What are you blabbering?

799
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,560
Cinnamon, cloves, ginger..

800
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,840
Couscous..
- Hey!

801
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,920
She suggests that
we kill the boy.

802
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,280
Let's do it.

803
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,080
The decision has been made.

804
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,840
But it's not easy to execute it.

805
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,160
Why should we let go
of an opportunity?

806
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,840
Even I am fed up of what
Veeranna has been saying.

807
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,480
Dear..

808
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,040
As a father,
I couldn't do anything for you.

809
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,960
I will do anything
for your betterment.

810
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,160
Do what you people have to.

811
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,400
Let me do what I have to.

812
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,840
Cook the food and
serve it to him.

813
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,400
Even you have your meals
and go to sleep.

814
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,960
Before morning..
- Sir.. - Yes..

815
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Are you done talking?

816
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,760
If you keep talking

817
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,480
the chicken curry
will take more time.

818
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,080
No..

819
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,080
I had got all the ingredients.

820
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,400
I was keeping an account..

821
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,840
The remaining cash..

822
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,160
Come on, sir. It was meant
for your expenses as well.

823
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,920
You said you wanted
to buy something.

824
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,320
Haven't you bought it?

825
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,360
Well.. I'll be back.
- Go and be back fast.

826
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,280
The curry is waiting for you.
- Yes..

827
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,120
You get the stuff ready.
- Yes..

828
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,400
Be careful.

829
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,000
I'll be back.

830
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,720
'Alcohol is injurious
to health.'

831
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,160
Ma'am!

832
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,920
What do you think
about slaughtering?

833
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,880
I mean we have planned to
slaughter the chicken..

834
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,080
I want to know
your opinion on it.

835
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,440
You are the one who
told us to do so.

836
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,440
Yes, I did tell you.

837
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,440
But sometimes it feels
bad to kill a creature

838
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,480
only to consume it.

839
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,440
So what? Will you eat what
is being prepared or not?

840
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,440
Hey..
Philosophy just sounds good.

841
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,480
One can't follow it.

842
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,960
If you want to relish the curry

843
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,120
the chicken must die.

844
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,320
Exactly.

845
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,000
It would've been great

846
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,240
if we could make a tasty curry
without killing the chicken.

847
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,680
Somebody must die
to give life to another.

848
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,640
That's how nature works.

849
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,920
A big animal preys
on a small animal.

850
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,240
A bigger animal preys
on the big animal.

851
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,280
Man is also a part
of that chain.

852
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,440
But man cannot eat another man.

853
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,040
So we eat what suits us,
chicken or sheep.

854
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,160
We eat other animals.

855
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,640
If you are feeling so sorry,
don't eat it. Leave it.

856
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,840
Hey.. I won't take
such wrong decisions.

857
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,760
Don't arrive at wrong
conclusions.

858
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,440
I am saying such things as
they may make the dead chicken

859
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,800
feel good before
it adorns our platters.

860
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,920
Will you keep talking
or let us cook?

861
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,720
Hey.. The curry is important.
Sorry..

862
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
Mr. Muthanna.

863
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,880
We have a small
dispute amongst us.

864
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,840
My father says that you will
quit drinking from tomorrow.

865
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,280
I disagree with him.
What do you have to say?

866
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,360
Well..

867
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,400
Why should I interfere
in the father-son dispute?

868
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,440
That's not the case,
Mr. Muthanna.

869
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,680
I say, one who drinks in sorrow,
won't drink in joy.

870
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,680
I say that one who drinks will
never care for circumstances.

871
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,200
Look, both of you.

872
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,240
It's okay if you don't
give me to drink.

873
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,040
Who are you to tell me
not to drink?

874
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,640
Who..

875
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,120
Oh..

876
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,800
Now I get it.

877
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,720
You plan to talk
all this rubbish

878
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,320
and make me sober.

879
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,240
So that I start drinking again
and you get more business.

880
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,680
Right?

881
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,640
That won't happen.

882
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,520
That won't happen..

883
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,720
Tonight..

884
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,040
I am going to do
something important.

885
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,560
Important..

886
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,480
I have decided to quit drinking.

887
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,720
I'll quit it..

888
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,120
Raju, one more peg.

889
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,520
Look at that.

890
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,920
Here you go.

891
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,520
Gowramma!

892
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,120
Gowramma!
- Yes!

893
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,680
You have been asked to
come work at Munigowda's farm

894
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,040
tomorrow.

895
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,960
You'll be paid well.

896
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,040
Will you and your daughter come?
- Yes, we will.

897
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,800
At what time?
- Hey..

898
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,920
Hereafter we won't
work on farms.

899
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,040
Oh, no matter what, I thought
you people would come.

900
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,640
What do I do now?

901
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,600
Hey, ask somebody else.

902
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,280
We have no time.

903
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,360
Okay. I'll leave now.

904
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,040
Ma'am, I won't be here tomorrow.

905
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,560
Did you refuse to go just
because you'll have to serve me?

906
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,080
You won't be here and even
we won't have to work.

907
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,520
Hence we need not work tomorrow.

908
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,160
Hey.. That..
That's not the case..

909
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,040
We have work in our own fields.

910
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,680
Hence she refused.

911
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,720
Oh, that's good. I hope I am
not causing any trouble.

912
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,240
You being alive
is a problem for us.

913
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,800
Ma'am, how long will it
take for the dinner to be ready?

914
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,520
Well, some more time.
Please wait.

915
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,520
I can't.

916
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,120
He'll be back, dear.
- I don't think so, Mom.

917
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,680
He has a lot of money on him.
He'll get drunk

918
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,640
and pass out.
He won't come here and help.

919
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,840
What do you suggest now?

920
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,800
Malli!

921
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,560
Oh..

922
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,440
I just remembered..

923
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,640
I knew it..

924
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,000
I told them to just cook food.

925
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,840
But I just can't trust

926
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,280
the women of my family.

927
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,080
Impossible..

928
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
Impossible..

929
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,120
Raju!

930
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,120
Ma'am!

931
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,800
I doubt if I'll get to
eat chicken curry today.

932
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,280
Don't overcook it.
Serve it fast.

933
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,520
Y-Yes, dear.

934
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,000
I am making 'Ragi Mudde'.

935
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:25,200
It looks like you'll feed him, sing
a lullaby and put him to sleep.

936
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,520
What do I do?
Your father said that

937
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,080
he'll handle the rest.

938
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,520
What! My father! Will that
drunkard handle things?

939
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,800
He won't return until
he runs out of money.

940
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,120
What do you want me to do?

941
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,280
Nothing can be done if he is
destined to die by our hands.

942
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,360
We need to do whatever
needs to be done.

943
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,240
No, Malli.

944
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,640
Don't stop me, Mom.

945
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,320
We need to murder him
in order to solve our problems.

946
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,240
I am not stopping you.

947
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,760
I don't want bloodshed here.

948
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,520
Then?

949
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,000
The poisonous plant.

950
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,120
"Feelings give
birth to desire.."

951
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:46,800
"But desire makes
life miserable.."

952
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,240
"Even virtues"

953
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,640
"turn into vices.."

954
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,160
"Envy in hearts"

955
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,680
"and evil intentions."

956
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,720
"One perishes in
the fire of desire."

957
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,520
"And the dance of
death follows."

958
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,480
"Desire is the rot"

959
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,440
"that ruins humanity
in our hearts."

960
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:36,520
"Desire that moulds
into evil designs.."

961
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,560
It has a great aroma.

962
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,800
Enough, ma'am.

963
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,360
What's this?

964
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,200
Your hands are dirty.

965
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,000
Well, that's because
I was writing.

966
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,480
Let me go wash my hands.

967
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,720
You..

968
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,280
Be careful, sir. It's dark.
- It's dark everywhere..

969
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,920
Mom, the cops are here.

970
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,640
Oh God!

971
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,680
Channakeshava!

972
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,160
Yes, ma'am..
- Stay here for some time.

973
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,520
I'll call you.

974
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,560
Why, ma'am? What happened?

975
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,840
Somebody is here.

976
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,760
If they see you here

977
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,960
they may ask
unnecessary questions.

978
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,280
You know it..

979
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,160
I got it, ma'am.

980
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,080
I won't cause any
trouble for you.

981
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,920
I'll be here until you call me.

982
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,960
Y-Yes..

983
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,360
Oh..

984
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,920
I am just not able
to relish the chicken.

985
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,960
Greetings, sir.

986
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,760
Greetings..
- What brings you here?

987
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,240
A thief struck
at Mr. Bhadregowda's house.

988
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,480
We have learnt that
he is somewhere around.

989
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,320
We have come searching for him.

990
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,240
Did you see any
suspicious person around?

991
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,520
Gowramma..

992
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,520
I can sense an aroma.

993
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,680
I believe meat
has been prepared.

994
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,280
C-Chicken curry is what
I have prepared.

995
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,760
Come on, let me it.
- Me too, sir.

996
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,760
Shut the dog up.

997
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,440
It won't harm you, sir.
- What if it bites us?

998
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,680
Barking dogs seldom bite.

999
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,600
Sir knows nothing about dogs.
Come on, now.

1000
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,240
Come on, ma'am.

1001
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,360
Come on..

1002
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,400
Oh..

1003
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,760
You have already
served it in plates.

1004
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,080
Oh.. Not that, sir.

1005
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,640
I'll get other plates
for both of you.

1006
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,960
Never mind. We are
no strangers.. - No, sir..

1007
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,080
It's a leftover.

1008
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,080
Malli, get two plates.

1009
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,560
Get the utensils in.

1010
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,000
Oh..

1011
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,000
Hey, Gowramma!
What's the hurry?

1012
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,560
I-It slipped from my hand, sir.

1013
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,560
Malli, clean it up.

1014
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,160
I'll get the curry.

1015
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:54,120
"The night witnesses
a dance of desires"

1016
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,960
"and death alike."

1017
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,920
"The night is like no other"

1018
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,640
"as people's evil designs
are manifested in it."

1019
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:16,560
"The one who falls
prey to desires.."

1020
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,600
"Heralds his own peril.."

1021
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:31,440
"Humanity has been held
captive by evil desires."

1022
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:37,920
"Innocence has been entrapped,
nobody knows that."

1023
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,400
"What has destiny
brought people to?"

1024
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,960
"Such misfortune awaits.."

1025
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,080
Gowramma..

1026
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,680
I wonder if the chicken
is tastier than the curry

1027
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,520
or if it is the
other way round.

1028
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,720
But it tastes great.

1029
01:12:53,720 --> 01:13:00,120
"You will fall prey to desire."

1030
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:07,320
"You will perish
in this dance of desires."

1031
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,440
Hey.. Go away..

1032
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,920
Go away..

1033
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:17,760
Hey..

1034
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,880
Hey, let it eat.

1035
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,760
The leftovers will be
fed to the dog, right?

1036
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,800
'Evil designs have
taken over nobility.'

1037
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,360
'Now everything is ruined.'

1038
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:37,600
'If innocence dies
and evil wins'

1039
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,960
'it indicates that
man has turned into a demon!'

1040
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,800
Gowramma, thanks for the meal.

1041
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,160
We shall leave now.
- Goodbye.

1042
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,440
Sir, let's sleep here
for a while. - Hey, let's go.

1043
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,760
What's this?

1044
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,400
After having the meal,
it's sleeping like a log.

1045
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,200
That's how it is. It sleeps
soon after having its meal.

1046
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,960
Saw that?

1047
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,240
Had we also slept, we'd
have been compared to a cur.

1048
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,520
Come on.

1049
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,920
"Darkness has engulfed"

1050
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,400
"intellect and sanity."

1051
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,120
"Your intellect"

1052
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:21,040
"has fallen prey to greed."

1053
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,200
"Your ways are similar"

1054
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,720
"to that of others."

1055
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,160
"But your intentions"

1056
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,520
"are evil beyond measure."

1057
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:41,600
"Who decides who lives"

1058
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,080
"and who dies?
Whose end"

1059
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,640
"awaits him at which instance?"

1060
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,600
Mallika.. What happened?

1061
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,560
It's puking. Go on,
mom has served the dinner.

1062
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,240
"The night witnesses
a dance of desires"

1063
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,440
"and death alike."

1064
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,200
"The night is like no other"

1065
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,680
"as people's evil designs
are manifested in it."

1066
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,920
"The one who falls
prey to desires.."

1067
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,760
"Heralds his own peril.."

1068
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,760
"Desires have
manifested themselves"

1069
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,040
"in their most cruel form."

1070
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,200
"The night is like no other"

1071
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,080
"as people's evil designs
are manifested in it."

1072
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,960
"The onset of this night"

1073
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,840
"has started a mayhem
of envy and desires."

1074
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,640
Hey.. What are you doing, dear?

1075
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,880
Ma'am..

1076
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,400
I should have touched your feet
the moment I came here.

1077
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,080
You didn't poison his food,
did you?

1078
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,960
You valued a stranger's life more
than your daughter's future.

1079
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,960
You won't mind if I sell
my body to repay your debt.

1080
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
Malli..

1081
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,680
Why do you say that
and hurt me?

1082
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,240
I got sacred after
I saw the dog die.

1083
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,120
So..

1084
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,000
That's why I didn't serve him

1085
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,040
the poisoned curry.

1086
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,640
You won't..

1087
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,080
You won't feel like doing it.

1088
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,200
For being born as your daughter

1089
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,280
I must kill myself.

1090
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,800
Hey..

1091
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,080
Don't worry.
I won't kill myself.

1092
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,960
I'll do what I have decided to.

1093
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,240
Hey..

1094
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,080
Hey! This is used to slaughter.

1095
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,560
We slaughter chicken using it.

1096
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,240
Hey..

1097
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,160
Either he dies

1098
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,960
or I die.

1099
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,760
It sounded like
Ms. Gowramma's scream.

1100
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,640
Kannappa..

1101
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,920
What brings you here
at this time?

1102
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,360
I was heading home.

1103
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,840
I heard your scream
so I came to enquire.

1104
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,960
Scream?

1105
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,680
Not at all.
- It sounded like your scream.

1106
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,960
Me? Not at all.

1107
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,320
Fine. Perhaps
it was my misconception.

1108
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,440
I'll leave. Be careful. - Yes.

1109
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,320
It's dark. Even you be careful.

1110
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,960
For me day and night are alike.

1111
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,320
One who knows not
where he is going, is blind.

1112
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,080
I'll leave now. - Okay..

1113
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,640
Ma'am.. I think you have guests.

1114
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,880
Guests.. Nobody visits us.

1115
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,720
Why are you lying to me?

1116
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,600
Don't you get it when told once?
Just leave.

1117
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,360
I'll leave, Malli.
Why get angry over it?

1118
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,400
Well.. Where is Muthanna?

1119
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,160
Don't you know where he will be?
Just leave.

1120
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,800
I'll leave now..

1121
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,480
One more, Raju..
One more peg..

1122
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,080
Sir.. It's enough for today.

1123
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,720
My master and his son
are playing this trick

1124
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,520
because you won't come
here from tomorrow.

1125
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,480
Will you drink to your death
tonight itself? - Shut up..

1126
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,160
Even you talk like that..

1127
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,360
I'll drink tonight, tomorrow
and again on the day after..

1128
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,880
I'll offer drinks even to you.

1129
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,360
I have the money.
- It's not about the money.

1130
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,640
I'll tell you something.
After listening to it

1131
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,520
forget offering me a drink,
you'll rush home.

1132
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,960
Hey, say what it is.

1133
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,480
Say it.

1134
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,120
The one who has visited you..

1135
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,640
What..
- The one who has visited you..

1136
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,800
Do you know who he is?

1137
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,960
How do you know the fact
that he has visited us?

1138
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:09,280
"Life is a carriage.."

1139
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:20,000
"Life is a carriage,
destiny is its master."

1140
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,400
"You are the steed"

1141
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:30,560
"that pulls it."

1142
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,080
"The Almighty decides who
boards it. Joy and grief.."

1143
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,320
"Are the places you run to."

1144
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:49,960
"If your legs fail, you have
the ground to support you."

1145
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,120
"If your legs fail, you have
the ground to support you."

1146
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:04,200
"The game of destiny..
Cruel games of destiny.."

1147
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,440
"Perish in this
game of destiny."

1148
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:15,000
"Life is a game..
Evil are these games.."

1149
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:20,360
"The human life is
polluted by envy."

1150
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,760
"Every tree blossoms
in a season.."

1151
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,920
"And withers away in another.."

1152
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,200
"Every tree blossoms
in a season.."

1153
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:38,400
"And withers away in another.."

1154
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,880
"And withers away in another.."

1155
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,280
"And withers away in another.."

1156
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,200
Hey..

1157
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,240
Gowramma..

1158
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,080
Where is he?

1159
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,840
Subbu..

1160
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,960
Oh..

1161
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,880
Subbu..

1162
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,760
Oh..

1163
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,080
He.. He's my Subbu.

1164
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,280
Subbu..

1165
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,680
'I have come here
after many years.'

1166
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,040
'You can't recognise me.'

1167
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,360
'I am Muthanna's son.
Subbu.'

1168
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,360
'Muthanna's son..'

1169
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,840
'You had run away from here
when you were a kid.'

1170
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,080
'Are you the one?'

1171
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,120
'Yes, that's me.'

1172
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:14,800
'After you left,
your mother wept ceaselessly.'

1173
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,520
'Your father became a drunkard.'

1174
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,240
'Your sister is
still unmarried.'

1175
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,520
'Forget all that.
Now that you are back'

1176
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,560
'everything will be alright.'

1177
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,160
'I will set it right.
That's why I have come here.'

1178
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,200
'I left home over
a petty issue.'

1179
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,480
'I'll show it to my parents'

1180
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,200
'that I didn't
leave home in vain.'

1181
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,800
'Sir.. Unless I tell them'

1182
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,120
'don't tell my family about me.'

1183
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,320
'You seem to have
planned it out.'

1184
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,960
Subbu..

1185
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,840
Subbu..

1186
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,880
Subbu..

1187
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,480
Subbu..

1188
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,040
Subbu.

1189
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,960
'The money that is mine,
can be yours in future.'

1190
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,160
'Those who work out,
should not drink tea.'

1191
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,280
'They should drink milk.'

1192
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,360
Subbu..

1193
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,200
Our Subbu..

1194
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,440
Subbu..

1195
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,600
Hey..

1196
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,080
Subbu..

1197
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,880
Get up..

1198
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,760
Malli..

1199
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,200
Look, this is you.

1200
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,360
Look at my Subbu.

1201
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,400
Our Subbu..

1202
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,840
Our Subbu..

1203
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:33,000
'Mom, he has cut my hair..'

1204
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,640
'What's that..'

1205
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,080
'Oh my! Darned fellow!'

1206
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,720
'You've cut the girl's hair!'

1207
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,280
'What's wrong with you?'

1208
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,880
'Why did you do that? Why?'

1209
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,080
'Are you laughing? Darn you!'

1210
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,520
'Are you still laughing
after all the spanking?'

1211
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,880
'You should be thrashed.'

1212
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,840
'I'm coming.
Where are you running to?'

1213
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,280
'Where is he?'

1214
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,040
'Hey, rascal! Will I spare you
if you run away?'

1215
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,800
'Stop!
Where are you running to?'

1216
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,760
'Hey.. Subbu..'

1217
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,200
'Go. Go away.'

1218
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,960
'I'll kill you if
you come back.'

1219
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,080
Don't touch him!

1220
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,280
Don't touch him!

1221
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,000
We don't deserve to touch him.

1222
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,880
Hey..

1223
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,200
He..
- I..

1224
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,280
I..

1225
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,600
I made the mistake.

1226
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,320
I was the one..

1227
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,840
I killed him.

1228
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,880
I killed him..

1229
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,040
Hey..

1230
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,560
It's my mistake.

1231
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,200
Yes.. It's me..
I made a mistake.

1232
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,080
I made a mistake by
giving birth to him.

1233
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,400
He..

1234
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,080
Even I..

1235
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,200
Subbu..

1236
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,200
You.. I..

1237
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:17,840
I killed him.

1238
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,640
I shouldn't..

1239
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,880
Subbu..

1240
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,200
Look at this.
Subbu..

1241
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:31,160
Subbu.. Look..

1242
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,760
"Trust and faith.."

1243
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,280
"Do not exist anymore."

1244
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:04,480
"Trust and faith.."

1245
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:09,480
"Are all that matter
in this world."

1246
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,120
"Your existence
revolves around these.."

1247
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:19,560
"Your peril is brought
by the absence of these."

1248
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:23,600
"Your existence
revolves around these.."

1249
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,080
"The betterment of humanity
rests on them.."

1250
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,240
"The betterment of every
individual rests on them.."

1251
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:37,320
"The betterment of every
individual rests on them.."

1252
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:15,040
"This life takes pleasant
and unpleasant forms.."

1253
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:19,560
"It is a maze of desires.."

1254
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:25,760
"Ambitions and evil desires.."

1255
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,240
"We are surrounded
by all of these.."

1256
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:36,120
"Our existence
is marred by desires.."

1257
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,440
"Virtues are blurred.."

1258
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:44,600
"Our existence
is marred by desires.."

1259
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,840
"This is the bitter truth.."

1260
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:53,360
"This is what life is about.."

1261
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,320
"This is what life is about.."

1262
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:02,200
"Mankutimma.."

1263
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:08,080
"Mankutimma.."

1264
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:15,760
"Mankutimma.."

1265
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:37,120
"Mankutimma.."

1266
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:45,640
"Mankutimma.."

1267
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,000
"Mankutimma.."

1268
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:01,000
"This is what life is about.."

1269
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,200
"Mankutimma.."

1270
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,520
'It's a memorable
day in my life.'

1271
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:14,160
'Whatever I had lost
in these 15 years'

1272
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:18,000
'I regained it in a day
and I am very happy about it.'

1273
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,600
'I felt like telling my parents
that I am their son.'

1274
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,120
'But they have suffered a lot
because of me.'

1275
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,320
'So let me benefit them
in some way'

1276
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,640
'and reveal my
identity to them.'

1277
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,280
'Had I apologised for
my mistake back then'

1278
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:40,040
'I need not have stayed away
from my mother for so long.'

1279
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,960
'Even father wouldn't
have become a drunkard.'

1280
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:47,000
'My sister doesn't know
that I am her brother'

1281
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:50,280
'and she is struggling
hard in life.'

1282
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:54,560
'God, You have given me
the strength to earn'

1283
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,640
'enough money to solve
my family's problems.'

1284
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,120
'Similarly,
until I reveal my identity'

1285
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,600
'may no evil thoughts cross'

1286
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,840
'my sister's mind.'

1287
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:09,840
'Tomorrow I'll repay
Veeranna's money'

1288
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,240
'and reveal my identity
to my parents'

1289
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,880
'only after seeking
their blessings.'
