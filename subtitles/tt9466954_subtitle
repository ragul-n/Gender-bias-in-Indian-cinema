It must be due to the

the number of believers who want
to offer prayers through letters,

He gives it special consideration.

You can actually go and
tell this to him directly.

grants every wish that's written to him.

That's sure.
Your wish will be granted.

Isn't it Luca on the line?

This is Kunjumon from the toddy shop!

fifth heart attack.

72

Looks like things will go out of control.

has surrounded him.

no matter if he dies or not.

78

His children have given
an order for a coffin.

79
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:34,853
And they have asked to print a flex
with a photo of Kunjachayan in a suit.

80
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,146
That's too much!
Can you come now?

81
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:39,670
I'll put him on.
Here.

82

Where are you, man?

83
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:48,592
They are not even allowing us
inside the compound, to see him.

84
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:52,177
His children are saying that
he won't die if he sees us.

85
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,066
Okay then.

86
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,179
What did he say?

87
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,414
He said that Kunjachan cannot
leave without asking his permission.

88
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,741
Then he will come!

90
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:21,718
To see something,
you should open that window, right?

91
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:24,218
So I can only see what's
in the room, right?

92
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:33,571
You deserve a beating for this!

93
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,310

burning at the chapel in Cheriya Kadavu.

some pending tasks.

Go!

109

Let me see your face.

what I see in photos or at the altar?

You sweet rascal!

113

shot, or get poked by a cow,

114
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,043
or even if a coconut
falls on your head.

115
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,510
Death will approach
whichever way it wants to.

116

forsake your desires?

the clothesline.

for the last time.

and having kids.

lighting a candle for that remembrance?

Now give me the extreme unction.
I shall leave.

with water or without water?

00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:33,355
So will we meet again?

351
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,049
How can we not?

352
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:40,938
That's the signal.
Let me go.

353
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:42,922
See you soon!

354
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:29,784
I know you all have
been eagerly waiting...

355
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:32,855
So now he will interact with us.

356
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,540
I need that!

357
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:39,827
I won't give it back.

358
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:41,007
It's okay.
Keep it.

359
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:43,647
Hello everyone!

360
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:49,569
I think all of you know
why I've come here.

361
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,511
It's the poster launch of my next movie
'Shall I tell you a love story?'

362
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:56,017
Sir, please move.

363
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:59,275
Here's the poster of 'Shall
I tell you a love story?'

364
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:10,848
I'm really excited.
And the main reason for that...

365
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:17,372
is that this time I'm going to stay here,
talk to you and interact with you.

366
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:19,403
For some time,

367
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:27,624
it will be only about the only universal
language that all of us can speak - Love.

368
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,032
I will be talking about love.

369
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:33,367
I am also very excited

370
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:34,758
And, I love you.
I love you all.

371
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,047
Thank you so much.

372
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:37,852
Thank you, sir.

373
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:42,641
Yes, Vijay Sethupathi is live on air.

374
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,940
I think it's a dream come true moment.
And also.

375
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:47,769
did you hear what he said?
- Yes. He said a punch dialogue too.

376
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,386
Hey Mathayi. You're not any ordinary
Mathayi. You are Marconi Mathayi.

377
00:34:52,368 --> 00:34:54,110
He said he will come to our houses.

378
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,258
Like that, he said he
will come to our offices.

379
00:34:56,283 --> 00:34:58,046
He said he will come to our cars.
- Yes.

380
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:00,641
He said he will come
even on our headphones.

381
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:03,063
There is some clue in it.
Didn't you understand what it is?

382
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,666
Anyway, before telling
our listeners about it,

383
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:08,611
shall we come back with a superb track?
- Yes. A small break.

384
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:10,620
Happy?
- Of course! Super happy!

385
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,287
There will be a flood here.

386
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,787
The clouds will rain fire!

387
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:19,814
Soldier!

388
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:22,237
Soldier!

389
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:25,237
Soldier!

390
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:27,542
Can I have that gun?

391
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:30,362
What for?
- I need to shoot that guy in white!

392
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,128
Praise the Lord!
- Hallelujah!

393
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:35,269
Praise the Lord!

394
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,317
Give this.
- Tea.

395
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:42,908
[Super hit Malayalam
song playing on FM]

396
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,806
Good morning, sir.
- ' Morning.

397
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:01,668
Mathayi.

398
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:04,217
Where were you?
I was looking everywhere for you.

399
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,256
What for?
- Have this tea.

400
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:11,946
You're lucky!

401
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:14,509
- What's the matter?
- Treesa's father had called.

402
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:16,503
They are okay with it.

403
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:18,219
That's all?

404
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,851
Look at you!
Feeling all shy!

405
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:24,031
Feeling shy?
- What are you doing?

406
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:32,498
When?

407
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:40,533
Our Saramma Chedathi is no more.

408
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:48,640
Saramma Chedathi is gone.

409
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:51,579
Saramma Chedathi is no more.

410
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:52,994
Some time back.

411
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:54,641
Can't believe it.

412
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,609
Was it in the hospital?
- Yes.

413
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:02,315
Did they say anything about the funeral?
- No.

414
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,464
Shouldn't we go there?
- Of course.

415
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,729
Zacharia sir wouldn't have known, right?
- No.

416
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:09,457
Sir, come.

417
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,556
Until she stopped studies
after 4th grade,

418
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:34,111
Saramma and I were
in the same class.

419
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:37,610
The bank employees left only now.

420
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:39,354
This is really sad.

421
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,030
Leave it.

422
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:44,388
What did Treesa's family say?
Say that.

423
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:47,138
It is okay.
The family is interested.

424
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:50,138
She's their only daughter, right?
So they have a small condition.

425
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,081
Whatever Mathayi has, should be
written in her name. That's all.

426
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,681
Call them and say that this
wedding won't happen, Babu.

427
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,642
What are you saying?

428
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,010
Mathayi's farms don't have a fence, sir.

429
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:09,877
The crops here are for the
birds that fly down here.

430
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,266
To write it off in her name....

431
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:18,352
Let it go.

432
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:22,453
What is his problem?
- Anyway, she was a nice girl.

433
00:38:28,877 --> 00:38:29,877
Seven

434
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:31,885
Eight

435
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:33,786
Eight

436
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:35,683
Four

437
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:05,815
Sleep...

438
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,121
Sleep...

439
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Sleep, Mathayi...

440
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,181
Sleep...

441
00:39:28,892 --> 00:39:31,806
To enthrall our viewers,

442
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,939
To overjoy them with
adrenalin rushes,

443
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,651
here comes Royal Circus.

444
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,501
At Vallamkari Vani ground.

445
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:41,470
4 shows, daily.

446
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,438
With the acrobatic skills of the north,

447
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:48,937
and the charm of Russian circus
combined, a new visual experience!

448
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:54,024
To enjoy holding your breath,
risky car and bike jumps!

449
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:59,104
To enjoy without batting an eyelid,
trapeze by Russian artists.

450
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,439
Come here, my darling!

451
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,721
Colourful juggling...

452
00:40:06,924 --> 00:40:08,892
Come and enjoy!

453
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:10,477
Royal Circus!

454
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:14,330
At Vallamkari Vani grounds.
Daily 4 shows.

455
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,029
Hey!
Come here.

456
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:18,141
What happened?
- Come here.

457
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,875
Who did this vulgarity?

458
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:23,024
What is the vulgarity in this?

459
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,916
Who kept this broom
on top of my gun?

460
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:27,846
So didn't you know, Mathayi?

461
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,081
There's a new replacement
for Saramma Chedathi.

462
00:40:31,956 --> 00:40:34,088
A replacement without my knowledge.
Who's that?

463
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:36,534
Look!

464
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,159
Over there!

465
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:48,558
There she goes.

466
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,042
Look.

467
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:22,627
Jesus!

468
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,182
Brother, can I make a call?
- Yes.

469
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,956
Hello, Father.
- Anna, dear.

470
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,282
It's me. Can you hear me?
- Yes. Tell me.

471
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,783
Father, the roads here are quite busy.

472
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:02,307
No one knows to drive properly.

473
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:05,220
One guy would have hit me now.
- Did anything happen to you? - No.

474
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:07,151
They would have taken him
to the hospital now.

475
00:42:07,175 --> 00:42:08,628
Then there's a Jesus Christ here.

476
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,548
Not like our Church.
He's always smiling here.

477
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:14,252
Who's that Christ whom I don't know?
- I feel really happy when I see him.

478
00:42:16,807 --> 00:42:17,994
Father...

479
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:21,041
There's a shop nearby.
They sell only salt there.

480
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,020
Eapachayan's salt shop.

481
00:42:23,223 --> 00:42:25,879
It's time for me to go to the bank.
I'll tell you the rest later.

482
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,036
Okay then.
Bye.

483
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:34,366
Are you the new person who has
come in place of Saramma Chedathi?

484
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:36,780
Did you understand who I am?

485
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:37,964
Can you give me a clue?

486
00:42:46,473 --> 00:42:48,464
Do you know what this is?
- That's my broom!

487
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:50,215
Is it?
Then what about this?

488
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,105
Gun!
- So you know it!

489
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:55,473
Keep your broom at some corner.

490
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:57,786
Instead, don't keep
it on top of my gun!

491
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:00,056
I'm not just an ordinary security guard.

492
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,766
I am a soldier.

493
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:08,531
Hey!

494
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:10,805
See, I really don't have time.

495
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,649
I need to make at least
3 curries for lunch.

496
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,487
And then snacks and tea in the evening.
Manager sir has asked for all those.

497
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,243
Then I've to do the
sweeping & cleaning too.

498
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:19,933
I don't have time to waste. It's
going to be fun. See you, soldier!

499
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:33,352
Go... go

500
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,859
Stop! Now go...

501
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:38,292
Retired soldier, right?

502
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:41,018
A retired soldier and a gun
without a bullet are the same!

503
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,137
No bullet?
- Yes.

504
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,528
If you need a bullet, you need
to ask Manager sir, right?

505
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:48,856
There's no problem if this broom
sits on top of a bullet-less gun.

506
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,213
Both are the same!

507
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,366
Mathayi, so it doesn't have bullets?

508
00:43:54,955 --> 00:43:56,478
Why?
You wanna see?

509
00:43:57,658 --> 00:43:58,658
Do you want to?
- No.

510
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,119
Tea.

511
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:09,233
Please sign here.

512
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:13,881
You go to the village office
and get the tax receipt...

513
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:15,201
What's your name?

514
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:16,873
Anna
- What?

515
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,244
It's Anna!

516
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,084
The tea is good.
And the one who made it too.

517
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:28,585
Is it special?

518
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:31,811
Now it's not just one, but two people.
Don't leave your stomach empty.

519
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,999
Thank you.
- Drink it fast.

520
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Mathayi.

521
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Mathayi...

522
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:43,124
You said you'll kill her...
Didn't you?

523
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,364
For that you need bullets in
your gun, right? - One slap...

524
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:50,097
She is a girl.
Otherwise, you'd have seen!

525
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:52,136
Whatever it is,
she should be appreciated.

526
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:54,879
She impressed everyone
with just half a day!

527
00:45:03,497 --> 00:45:05,859
Please check this.
- Stand in queue.

528
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:13,952
The mango pickle is nice.
- It's lemon, not mango.

529
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:14,977
The beans curry is good.

530
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:16,228
It's really tasty.
- Enough?

531
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,570
No! No!

532
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,974
If he eats hot stuff,
Swami will burn down under.

533
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:24,952
It's not too spicy, Swami.
Eat it.

534
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:27,287
Didn't I say that I don't want it?
- Then no need.

535
00:45:27,312 --> 00:45:28,473
Where was this lying?

536
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:30,367
Didn't Mathayi have food?

537
00:45:31,324 --> 00:45:35,113
Mathayi is like a carpenter. When it's
time for lunch, he'll start working.

538
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:37,293
I will call him.

539
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:39,831
Hey!

540
00:45:40,394 --> 00:45:41,661
Come and have lunch.

541
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:46,665
Are you upset?

542
00:45:49,556 --> 00:45:51,477
I won't keep the broom
near the gun again.

543
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:54,969
Come.

544
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:56,033
Come, soldier.

545
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:57,571
Come on.

546
00:45:59,597 --> 00:46:02,038
Sir, the lunch was great, right?
- Yes.

547
00:46:02,855 --> 00:46:04,237
Mathayi...
- Yes.

548
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,894
Everything is over.

549
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:08,778
After eating, go
and buy groceries.

550
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:10,185
Just ask Anna.

551
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,730
Don't forget to get the
share from all the staff.

552
00:46:14,347 --> 00:46:15,347
That's enough!

553
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,877
Well, you also sit.
- No. I'll have later.

554
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:20,511
That won't work here.

555
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:24,628
Working together, eating from one plate.
That's the policy here. Right, sir?

556
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,755
Where are you looking at?
I would've hit you if I hadn't put brakes.

557

Hey!

558
00:46:49,435 --> 00:46:51,735
Now you got an idea about
the whole thing, right?

559
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,357
Pennamma!

560
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:56,328
Collect all the stuff.
I'll come by then.

561
00:46:58,312 --> 00:47:01,227
Finally you got one, huh Mathayi?

562
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:03,987
The girl looks like a mango.
Come! Come!

563
00:47:05,195 --> 00:47:07,011
Let me have a look.
Come here, girl.

564
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:09,261
Well...
- What?

565
00:47:09,308 --> 00:47:10,308
Pennamma!

566
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:14,788
Since he's stingy to give a feast,
he got married without telling us.

567
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:15,976
Come here, girl.

568
00:47:20,155 --> 00:47:22,147
Hey! I'll tell you something.

569
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:24,946
This Mathayi wasn't really
interested in marriage.

570
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:29,577
Only if you show interest, you can
give birth to babies every year.

571
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:34,044
She's the new girl who has come
to sweep and clean our bank.

572
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:36,747
Sheesh! There it goes!

573
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:38,540
Come, Pennamma.

574
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:41,073
I knew it when I saw her.
She has a servant's look.

575
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:42,098
True.

576
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,752
Anna....
- What?

577
00:47:44,902 --> 00:47:45,902
Go! Go!

578
00:47:47,964 --> 00:47:49,311
Anna, wait.

579
00:47:50,308 --> 00:47:51,589
What is this?

580
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:55,170
They're saying all this
because I'm still a bachelor.

581
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:57,320
That's out of their
love for me though.

582
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:58,391
Hey!

583
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:02,822
Your face has swollen up by crying.
Wipe it off!

584
00:48:03,228 --> 00:48:04,932
Will anyone cry for all this?

585
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:06,448
I cried just like that.

586
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:11,276
Come here.

Have it.

Come here.

592
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:53,443
I wanted to tell you something.

Well...

595
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,776
Don't tell anyone else that
the gun doesn't have bullets!

596
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:04,230
I'll feel embarrassed.

597

- Yes.

598
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,926
Don't you go to sing in troupes now?
- No. Troupes are not active now.

599
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:19,881
Now I sing devotional songs at the temple
during the pilgrimage season. That's all.

Oh wow!

Who's that gentleman who asked you
to escape after giving coffee?

626
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:48,743
His name is Varun.

627

It's been 9 months since we met.
That's all. - Just 9 months?

He works in Chennai.

And he has a good job!

634
00:53:05,565 --> 00:53:09,017
Without talking to me, he doesn't
go to office, nor does he sleep.

Isn't that enough to love him?

Yeah.
- Okay.

Have you discussed about your
relationship with your parents?

642
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:30,599
No.

643
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:33,536
So your parents don't
know about this.

644
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:35,497
That's why they brought
another proposal for you.

645
00:53:35,676 --> 00:53:38,565
So, you told this to Varun. He asked you
to come, and you're going to meet him.

this if you tell them?

you in their arms, kissed you...

every stage in life,

you, celebrated you...

in the rain of love, right?

You have confidence
in your love, right?

What you said is correct, sir.

674
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:03,228

how many ever years may pass,

that becomes tighter, as its twisted.

She's busy doing
something there.

700
00:56:32,997 --> 00:56:35,440
Then you lock it and come.
I'll wait downstairs.

701
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:56,138
Sorry, Anna.
- What is it, sir?

702
00:56:56,779 --> 00:56:57,779
Sorry.

703
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,732
Mathayi...
- Go, sir.

704
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:43,577
This is rice & curry
from lunch-time.

705
00:57:43,812 --> 00:57:44,976
Just heat it up.

706
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:49,967
Babuchettan told me that
you stay alone, Soldier.

707
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:52,139
Now don't go home and
take the trouble of cooking.

708
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,702
The proposal is from a girl as beautiful
as a white pumpkin. Come and meet her.

709
00:58:02,727 --> 00:58:04,632
She has come and seen
you at the bank.

710
00:58:06,374 --> 00:58:10,529
If it's a white pumpkin, eat it
before a Bandicoot attacks it.

711
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:13,808
This party doesn't
have any demands.

712
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:17,543
I've been telling you for so long
that I don't want to hear this.

713
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:21,004
Those who are tall, healthy and glamourous,
will be weak in this matter.

714
00:58:21,317 --> 00:58:23,145
Get lost!
Get lost, I say!

715
00:58:23,755 --> 00:58:24,885
You get lost!

716
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:29,048
If your problem is that
you don't know the girl,

717
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:31,198
there's a beautiful jasmine
in our garden itself.

718
00:58:31,223 --> 00:58:32,223
Which jasmine?

719
00:58:32,401 --> 00:58:33,401
Anna.

720
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:36,602
From what I heard,
she was raised by a priest.

721
00:58:36,688 --> 00:58:38,297
She's an innocent orphan.

722
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:40,304
That's best for you.
It's profitable too.

723
00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:42,542
Two salaries.
One vehicle.

724
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:44,285
Just think about it.

725
00:58:44,815 --> 00:58:47,117
You ride the cycle,
with her on the back...

726
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:48,922
No. Make her sit in
the front itself.

727
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:52,679
Ride it... And then you can
eat, sleep and work together.

728
00:58:52,853 --> 00:58:55,868
Just think about that whole scenario!
- Great.

729
00:58:57,395 --> 00:58:59,332
If you go to the bank
with a proposal for her,

730
00:58:59,357 --> 00:59:01,075
I'll be humiliated in
front of others too.

731
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:04,725
Now I'm getting good food at least.
You want to get rid of that too? Get lost!

732
00:59:08,751 --> 00:59:10,266
What happened?
- It didn't work.

733
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,985
It's the same psychological problem of
a cat that fell into hot water once.

734
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:17,376
There's one way.
Let's bring him.

735
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:19,273
Whom?

736
00:59:19,632 --> 00:59:21,351
Love.
Romance!

737
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:24,153
'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge'
(The lover will take the bride)

738
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:25,864
- That's good

739
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,699
Will it work?
- Why not?

740
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:30,136
He is an amazing lover!

741
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:31,777
Look how glamourous he is!

742
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:33,981
Mathayi...

743
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,860
Come here.

744
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:38,834
What is it?

745
00:59:38,859 --> 00:59:40,820
So, let's finalize that.

746
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,858
Finalize what?
- You're going to romance Anna.

747
00:59:42,968 --> 00:59:44,211
Yeah, right!

748
00:59:44,242 --> 00:59:46,062
As if she's ready to romance me!

749
00:59:46,261 --> 00:59:48,019
You don't worry about all that.
Talk for yourself.

750
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:50,653
My dear Vijayan, I don't know to romance.
You get going!

751
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:52,342
Why?
Haven't you loved anyone earlier?

752
00:59:52,474 --> 00:59:54,365
If you ask me if I've loved anyone....

753
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:56,769
Long long back!

754
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:57,981
Say it.
Let's hear it.

755
00:59:58,384 --> 00:59:59,587
Come on, say it.

756
00:59:59,775 --> 01:00:01,142
I can't tell you about it.

757
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,396
But I can show you.

758
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,165
Look! Over there!

759
01:00:15,785 --> 01:00:18,753
That handsome Luca sir...

760
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:21,588
is the first messenger
of my love.

761
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:26,494
So you were a real tiger, huh?
You Romeo!

762
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:28,292
Mathayi...
- Yes.

763
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:30,566
Isn't that the daughter of
Chakkappan from Olassha?

764
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:32,995
Tresya.

765
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:36,733
Little Mathayi's little Tresya.

766
01:03:50,362 --> 01:03:52,979
Back then, if girls did
something wrong,

767
01:03:52,987 --> 01:03:55,065
it was a fashion to
stop their studies.

768
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,577
Tresya's father was
also very fashionable.

769
01:04:01,225 --> 01:04:05,880
I thought that love and romance
had Tresya's little smiling face...

770
01:04:06,193 --> 01:04:09,451
until I saw her crying after
being beaten by her family.

771
01:04:10,899 --> 01:04:15,006
Afsu, it's because I didn't have the
strength to witness such a sight...

772
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:19,889
that this Mathayi kicked out the
love & romance that you spoke about,

773
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,178
from my heart.

774
01:04:21,554 --> 01:04:22,754
Mathayi...
- Yes.

775
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:24,928
That lover is still alive in your heart.

776
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,593
He is hiding.

777
01:04:26,672 --> 01:04:29,053
He will jump out some day.
Wait and watch.

778
01:04:29,078 --> 01:04:30,749
He has already
jumped out, Mapla.

779
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,640
When that old lover jumped out,

780
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:35,578
I saw the warm reaction he got.

781
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:36,789
Hey!

782
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:38,870
Whatever you lost,
is going to come back.

783
01:04:39,104 --> 01:04:40,276
In Anna's form.

784
01:04:41,688 --> 01:04:43,180
That day, when Anna's hand got cut,

785
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,211
I saw it.

786
01:04:53,158 --> 01:04:56,267
You were going to make stir fried
vegetables by cutting your finger again?

787
01:04:58,088 --> 01:05:00,853
Why don't you be a little bit more careful?

788
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:04,311
We are all class 4, dear.

789
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:05,671
Gun and broom!

790
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:08,772
So, we should take care of our
hands & legs ourselves, right?

791
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:12,998
Isn't it sad when the one who cooked
the food, is not able to eat it?

792
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:18,699
Here.
Now you can eat it.

793
01:05:20,832 --> 01:05:21,848
This is my father.

794
01:05:23,214 --> 01:05:24,214
This is my mother.

795
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:27,268
And the ball at the end?

796
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:28,908
That's not me.

797
01:05:29,182 --> 01:05:30,611
It's full of Vitamins.
Eat it.

798
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:40,245
Long back, my mother used to
make such rice balls for me.

799
01:05:40,397 --> 01:05:41,541
It was really tasty.

800
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:04,978
I had seen it that day.

801
01:06:05,486 --> 01:06:07,486
When you made those
rice balls for her,

802
01:06:07,573 --> 01:06:09,908
if tears rolled down her cheek,

803
01:06:09,939 --> 01:06:12,077
Mathayi, it's confirmed.

804
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,320
She is also alone.

805
01:06:13,617 --> 01:06:15,369
Anna is a perfect match for you.

806
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:18,831
Make up your mind, Mathayi.

807
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:21,011
And then open your
eyes and look at her.

808
01:06:21,654 --> 01:06:25,201
Then, you will be able to
see the signs of her love.

809
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:28,286
Keep your eyes wide open.

810
01:06:28,814 --> 01:06:29,986
Come on, boys.

811
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,947
Mapla, shouldn't we
finish this bottle?

812
01:06:32,972 --> 01:06:35,994
Leave it.
We should fix this first.

813
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Wow!

814
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:46,922
Moon is lying in here like an ice cube!

815
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:52,321
Sir!

816
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,549
This is the first time you're
opening the bank or what? - No! No!

817
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:42,590
Mathayi!

818
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,864
I've been calling you for one hour.
Well, where's your uniform?

819
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:52,145
Can't you see people waiting there?

820
01:08:52,848 --> 01:08:54,004
Go fast.
- Sir.

821
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:56,355
Antony, Anna hasn't
come today or what?

822
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,309
True.
- I'm already missing her Cardamom Tea.

823
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:00,848
Babu, I didn't get tea yet.

824
01:09:00,873 --> 01:09:04,654
- That's why the messenger
of God is informing you...

825
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,248
Luca Mapla...

826
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,865
Anna is on leave today.

827
01:09:11,123 --> 01:09:13,224
He is walking around
all clueless, over here.

828
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:18,341
If it doesn't open when you knock, Knock
again and again, it will definitely open!

829
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:28,992
What does love feel like?

830
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:33,491
It's only when we
don't see someone,

831
01:09:34,218 --> 01:09:37,233
that the energy and
happiness they gave us,

832
01:09:37,827 --> 01:09:39,905
would be remembered
by our heart.

833
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:44,428
There will be a desire in our heart,
to meet them as soon as possible.

834
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:47,737
That desire would consume us.

835
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:51,354
However beautiful the music might be...

836
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:53,987
However beautiful the
sights around may be...

837
01:09:54,478 --> 01:09:55,939
our eyes won't see them.

838
01:09:56,134 --> 01:09:57,175
Love....

839
01:10:00,169 --> 01:10:02,958
That one word is enough.

840
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,153
It is really powerful!

841
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:13,008
You may be whomsoever
in this world...

842
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:16,542
But once you fall in love...
That's it!

843
01:10:17,142 --> 01:10:19,197
Life will be full of surprises.

844
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:21,651
Soldier!

845
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:25,812
I didn't get a bus.
I came on a boat till Cheriyakadavu.

846
01:10:25,991 --> 01:10:29,203
What is this?
Can't you tell me if you'll be late?

847
01:10:29,343 --> 01:10:30,554
Now I was like...

848
01:10:30,603 --> 01:10:33,048
I mean, we got late to open the bank.
Do you know that?

849
01:10:33,073 --> 01:10:34,267
What happened?

850
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:35,704
Do you have fever?
- No.

851
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:41,395
You have temperature..

852
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,810
I'll be right back.

853
01:10:48,796 --> 01:10:50,956
Mapla, the festival has begun!

854
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:53,796
Now there will be choir music,
drum beats & fireworks!

855
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:57,587
It will feel like nothing existed
in this world until now.

856
01:10:57,845 --> 01:10:59,846
You'll enjoy the taste of your
food like it's the first time,

857
01:10:59,932 --> 01:11:02,674
You'll breathe air as if it's
the first time you're doing it.

858
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:04,401
You will have all such feelings!

859
01:11:04,566 --> 01:11:08,885
This love... It will change you into a
completely different person! Confirmed!

860
01:11:30,012 --> 01:11:31,012
Here.

861
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:33,833
It's medicated coffee.
Your fever will vanish.

862
01:11:55,828 --> 01:11:57,132
In that new world,

863
01:11:58,656 --> 01:12:01,320
you will start flying around,
like a butterfly.

864
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:04,409
Drink it.

865
01:12:07,596 --> 01:12:10,499
What is he saying in Tamil?
Did you understand it?

866
01:12:11,424 --> 01:12:13,822
- You will start
flying without wings.

867
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:24,438
You will start flying without wings.

868
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:32,679
We will talk a lot more about love. Be
right back. This is your Vijay Sethupathi.

869
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:33,914
Stay tuned!

870
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:51,181
If they have to interact so
closely in this situation,

871
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:53,142
we should know why, Mathayi.

872
01:12:53,742 --> 01:12:57,062
He might be her prospective groom (cousin).
Look at their eyes & noses!

873
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:02,355
He must be her brother.

874
01:13:04,503 --> 01:13:05,503
Isn't it?

875
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,210
O' merciful God,

876
01:13:11,351 --> 01:13:15,038
Bless this rose flower,
for the atonement of our sins.

877
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:18,264
Purify us with this water.

878
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:21,665
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit...

879
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:25,774
[Prayers continue]

880
01:13:25,907 --> 01:13:27,461
Who's that guy?

881
01:13:28,094 --> 01:13:29,634
We need to know who he is.

882
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,860
Otherwise?
- The lover will take the bride with him!

883
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:38,256
That means?
- Some random guy will go with the girl.

884
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,719
Oh no!

885
01:13:40,539 --> 01:13:41,539
Take your hands off!

886
01:13:42,313 --> 01:13:43,756
Take your hands off.
I can't see!

887
01:13:43,781 --> 01:13:46,960
You're yet to see the sights, you wicked
Mathayi. - The cycle will fall off.

888
01:13:46,985 --> 01:13:50,039
Both you and I will fall into the canal!
Take your hands off!

889
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,875
Oh no!

890
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:58,189
Save us!

891
01:14:01,192 --> 01:14:03,035
Mathayi, you'd have fallen
into the canal now.

892
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:07,332
Mathayi, we shouldn't repeat what
happened in Tresya's case again.

893
01:14:07,373 --> 01:14:08,841
You must be really brave.

894
01:14:09,021 --> 01:14:10,225
That's the problem, dude!

895
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:14,364
I'm still scared of the ladder next
to the window in Tresya's house.

896
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:17,878
Get down from that ladder.
Anna is right in front of your eyes, right?

897
01:14:18,394 --> 01:14:20,555
I have butterflies in my stomach!
- Wow!

898
01:14:21,037 --> 01:14:22,745
Wherever I look,
I can see only Anna.

899
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,495
I feel like she's standing all
around me, little Mathayi.

900
01:14:26,694 --> 01:14:27,993
But where is she now?

901
01:14:28,626 --> 01:14:30,139
At the bar!
- You rogue!

902
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,287
You sent that girl
to the bar now?

903
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:34,662
She's on the cycle bar, dude.
Look!

904
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:46,132
Instead of stammering like old times,
tell her the matter, Mathayi.

905
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,859
I'm leaving then.

906
01:14:51,891 --> 01:14:54,453
Ride the cycle smoothly!

907
01:15:07,616 --> 01:15:09,811
This Mathayi has never desired
for anything till date.

908
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:12,674
I've never asked
anyone for anything.

909
01:15:13,293 --> 01:15:14,534
I have only given.

910
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:17,198
I have a desire for
the first time!

911
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:20,812
To take you to Vallamkari Church,
tie a wedding chain on your neck,

912
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:22,703
and take you to my
house in the island.

913
01:15:23,673 --> 01:15:24,673
You and I...

914
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,880
Where did he go?

915
01:16:29,437 --> 01:16:31,530
Why are you going in
rounds here, Anna?

916
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:35,628
Our soldier was roaming around here.
Can't find him now.

917
01:16:35,653 --> 01:16:37,113
He must be in the bank.

918
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:39,011
Is it?
Then let me go and check.

919
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,992
Since both of them have
started going in rounds,

920
01:16:43,094 --> 01:16:45,633
things might proceed easily.

921
01:17:16,335 --> 01:17:17,335
Mathayi...

922
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:19,600
So nice, right?

923
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:22,791
Does it feel really good?

924
01:17:25,322 --> 01:17:28,057
Then, shall I show you a sight
that doesn't feel good at all?

925
01:17:29,151 --> 01:17:30,151
Come.

926
01:17:35,535 --> 01:17:37,035
Look over there.

927
01:17:38,332 --> 01:17:41,893
Well, they are like siblings, right?

928
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:42,918
Crap!

929
01:17:43,057 --> 01:17:45,116
They've been talking
for half an hour now.

930
01:17:45,304 --> 01:17:47,773
Is this how a brother &
sister stand together?

931
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,125
Mathayi!

932
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:50,916
He has started
pulling the strings.

933
01:17:51,322 --> 01:17:53,665
Before a connection begins,
go and tell her.

934
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:58,174
Or else, that damn gun will be hanging
on this side of yours, forever!

935
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:01,237
Then what!
What do I even tell this guy!

936
01:18:10,762 --> 01:18:13,035
Okay, brother.

937
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:15,221
How old were you when
you first fell in love?

938
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:17,051
It's a love since my 7th grade.

939
01:18:17,497 --> 01:18:19,082
Her family found out only now.

940
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,434
Her father has
locked her up, sir.

941
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,221
I know her.

942
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:24,600
She might do something silly.

943
01:18:24,999 --> 01:18:26,053
Then...

944
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:27,508
I will also...

945
01:18:28,578 --> 01:18:29,814
I don't know, sir.

946
01:18:31,411 --> 01:18:32,473
I understand...

947
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:34,419
Poor boy!
I feel sad for him.

948
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:36,185
Tell me a way out of this!

949
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,773
No! Let me listen!

950
01:18:37,888 --> 01:18:39,450
What sort of behaviour is this?

951
01:18:40,645 --> 01:18:41,645
Damn it!

952
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:44,794
This is like pushing us into the
river when there's an under-current.

953
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,592
Hello sir?
- Hello.

954
01:18:48,617 --> 01:18:49,859
Sir, can you hear me?

955
01:18:51,907 --> 01:18:53,735
Sir, love is like...

956
01:18:53,924 --> 01:18:55,822
naked babies.

957
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:59,626
We can't say when they would
jump to our shoulder or kiss us.

958
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:00,978
Sir, the soldier is on the radio.

959
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:06,270
Sir, who are you? You came in on your
own, and you're talking yourself?

960
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,786
You didn't even say your name!

961
01:19:09,957 --> 01:19:11,175
I am Mathayi, sir.

962
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,519
I called hearing that boy's grief.

963
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:15,167
Which Mathayi?

964
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:18,808
In between all the
Mathayis in the world,

965
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,552
son of Kuzhimanamparambil Kunjannamma
Kochousepp, Mathayi.

966
01:19:22,145 --> 01:19:24,543
My townsmen call me
Marconi Mathayi, as well.

967
01:19:24,652 --> 01:19:25,652
Marconi Mathayi?

968
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,596
The one who invented the radio?
That Marconi?

969
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:31,488
Oops! They call me
that out of love, sir.

970
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:34,711
I'm really fond of music.
That's why.

971
01:19:35,728 --> 01:19:38,206
Correct.
You are Marconi Mathayi, indeed.

972
01:19:38,714 --> 01:19:40,456
Tell me, Marconi Mathayi...

973
01:19:41,104 --> 01:19:43,315
Sir, what do we do if
fathers act like this?

974
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:46,120
Like movie villains!

975
01:19:46,924 --> 01:19:48,104
Mr. Villain!

976
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:52,854
We have only life, right sir? Why do we
need fights & arguments between that?

977
01:19:53,181 --> 01:19:55,124
We should just love everyone!

978
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:57,571
That's how life is, sir.

979
01:19:58,632 --> 01:20:00,235
That's correct, sir.

980
01:20:01,325 --> 01:20:03,614
From the way you're speaking
so much about love,

981
01:20:04,419 --> 01:20:06,997
I'm guessing that you're a great
Romeo, Mathayi?

982
01:20:08,969 --> 01:20:10,309
Nothing like that, sir.

983
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,863
Mathayi is innocent.
Decent too.

984
01:20:12,888 --> 01:20:13,888
Hey sir!

985
01:20:14,441 --> 01:20:16,804
Love is also decent. Who said
it's wrong? Right? - Yes.

986
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:19,024
There's nothing wrong in
being in love, Mathayi.

987
01:20:19,562 --> 01:20:22,615
From the way you talk, it's
confirmed that you're in love.

988
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,006
Tell me.
Who's that angel of luck?

989
01:20:26,507 --> 01:20:27,507
Mathayi....

990
01:20:27,635 --> 01:20:28,635
Are you shy?

991
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:32,728
What is it, sir?

992
01:20:34,377 --> 01:20:35,377
Sir...

993
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:38,815
Exploit this situation, man!

994
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,900
No, sir.
- Bloody idiot!

995
01:20:45,606 --> 01:20:47,528
I am in love with
everything, sir.

996
01:20:49,872 --> 01:20:55,362
To the lake, crows, cats,
you, your movies...Everything!

997
01:20:55,836 --> 01:20:58,298
I'm in love with everything
in the world, sir.

998
01:21:00,032 --> 01:21:01,227
Mathayi...

999
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:04,470
When I'm hearing what you say,

1000
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:07,072
I think I'm also like that.

1001
01:21:07,097 --> 01:21:08,097
What is it, sir?

1002
01:21:08,122 --> 01:21:09,625
I also like everyone.

1003
01:21:11,943 --> 01:21:13,538
I really like you now.

1004
01:21:15,406 --> 01:21:16,613
Can I get a hug?

1005
01:21:18,738 --> 01:21:20,378
It's my duty time, sir.

1006
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:21,716
I'm all sweaty, sir.

1007
01:21:23,903 --> 01:21:25,083
That's all right.

1008
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:27,341
One hug!

1009
01:21:27,906 --> 01:21:28,906
Mathayi!

1010
01:21:29,045 --> 01:21:30,880
Really happy, sir.
- Tight hug!

1011
01:21:31,406 --> 01:21:32,406
Mathayi!

1012
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:34,850
Thank you.
- Okay, sir.

1013
01:21:34,939 --> 01:21:35,939
Okay.

1014
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:36,971
Love you.

[Festival announcement]

1016
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:07,685
Looks like an angel dressed
in a red Sari, right?

1017
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:09,095
True.

1018
01:22:09,806 --> 01:22:12,720
The tableau display is in progress.

1019
01:22:13,322 --> 01:22:17,438
St. Sebastianos, pray for us!

1020
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:20,712
Hi dear...
- Hi, sister...

1021
01:22:21,485 --> 01:22:23,930
Mathayi, things will
get complicated now.

1022
01:22:24,048 --> 01:22:25,048
Why?

1023
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:27,836
Your sister & team!
Look! Look!

1024
01:22:29,924 --> 01:22:32,174
Didn't you recognize me?
- Of course!

1025
01:22:32,236 --> 01:22:33,236
Oh no!

1026
01:22:34,572 --> 01:22:36,900
They have fireworks
in their tongues!

1027
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:39,439
Go say something and adjust...

1028
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:42,286
How can I go?
I have the bow with me. You go!

1029
01:22:42,311 --> 01:22:44,857
Didn't you shoot the arrow?
I'm tied up here!

1030
01:22:44,882 --> 01:22:46,521
Look! Mathayi!

1031
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:52,801
Over here.
- Okay.

1032
01:22:53,293 --> 01:22:54,293
Go fast.

1033
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:56,159
Wait here itself.

1034
01:22:57,496 --> 01:22:59,105
My dear sister, I...

1035
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:01,168
Mathayi, let's fix this girl.
- Let me explain.

1036
01:23:01,216 --> 01:23:02,216
Let me explain.

1037
01:23:02,355 --> 01:23:04,778
Don't tell her anything.
For God's sake!

1038
01:23:04,956 --> 01:23:06,604
I...
There she comes!

1039
01:23:06,932 --> 01:23:08,499
I missed the last bus too!

1040

Oh no!

So sad!
- What do I do now?

1042
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:13,066
So what? You can go by boat.
- True.

1043
01:23:13,308 --> 01:23:14,698
Mathayi will take you, right?

1044
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:17,340
Why not?
- You must do it.

1045

So both of you can
go together...

1046
01:23:31,457 --> 01:23:33,665
Hey! It is said that
this eastern wind....

1047
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:36,275
The eastern wind
would bring fever.

1048
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,923
Here.
Put this around your neck.

1049
01:23:42,265 --> 01:23:44,772
Hey! I've been wanting to ask
you something for a long time.

1050
01:23:46,491 --> 01:23:47,693
What's inside that bag?

1051
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:50,157
Inside this bag?

1052
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:52,830
It's a medicine.
- What medicine?

1053
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:54,659
Well....

1054
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,313
If you have one ounce from it,
half of our sorrows would be gone.

1055
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:02,782
If you have one more ounce,

1056
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:04,891
all sorrows will disappear.

1057
01:24:05,422 --> 01:24:06,493
Then we'll be happy!

1058
01:24:07,361 --> 01:24:09,509
If you have a third one...
- If so?

1059
01:24:09,534 --> 01:24:10,555
No!

1060
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,947
It's said that we should be
tied up after three rounds.

1061
01:24:15,877 --> 01:24:20,173
How were you able to call up that FM
channel and talk to that sir like this?

1062
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:23,772
What's the point of us calling?

1063
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,998
The way that man talked to us?

1064
01:24:27,397 --> 01:24:28,595
Isn't that the great thing!

1065
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,145
He...
He is a great man!

1066
01:24:36,636 --> 01:24:37,636
Oh no!

1067
01:24:38,103 --> 01:24:39,604
It's gone!

1068
01:24:39,963 --> 01:24:41,603
I'm scared of the dark!

1069
01:24:44,603 --> 01:24:46,158
How can you be so easily scared?

1070
01:24:47,572 --> 01:24:49,088
In every darkness,

1071
01:24:50,134 --> 01:24:51,978
won't God show us a light?

1072
01:24:56,011 --> 01:24:57,011
Look!

1073
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,292
Over there!

1074
01:25:25,214 --> 01:25:26,597
I don't know!

1075
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,798
Anna...

1076
01:28:42,495 --> 01:28:43,743
I like you, Anna.

1077
01:28:46,448 --> 01:28:47,830
I want to take you to the Church,

1078
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:51,996
get married to you and live with you.
That kind of liking.

1079
01:28:54,487 --> 01:28:56,535
I'd like to live the rest
of my life with you.

1080
01:28:57,079 --> 01:28:59,072
This is what I wanted
to tell you, Anna.

1081
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:03,681
Mathayi!

1082
01:29:04,195 --> 01:29:05,195
Awesome!

1083
01:29:13,864 --> 01:29:15,752
Let this be with me
for some courage!

1084
01:29:32,225 --> 01:29:33,225
Where are you going?

1085
01:29:36,642 --> 01:29:37,796
What happened?

1086
01:29:57,661 --> 01:29:59,209
What are you guarding in here?

1087
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:02,825
This is full of diamonds
to guard, right?

1088
01:30:03,036 --> 01:30:04,410
Go ahead, deposit it!

1089
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:08,888
He got me scared!

1090
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:19,045
Hey girl...

1091
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,757
I...
- You?

1092
01:30:22,007 --> 01:30:23,494
I...

1093
01:30:25,034 --> 01:30:26,432
Well, I...

1094
01:30:26,651 --> 01:30:27,651
Bring it on!

1095
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:30,362
I wanted to go to Idukki.

1096
01:30:30,814 --> 01:30:33,064
So what? Why don't you ask for a leave?
- That's enough.

1097
01:30:34,025 --> 01:30:35,962
My younger sister Lalimol
is over there, right?

1098
01:30:39,052 --> 01:30:40,490
Lost that chance too!

1099
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:42,292
Convey my regards
to your sister.

1100
01:30:45,169 --> 01:30:46,559
Mathayi!
- Yes.

1101
01:30:46,793 --> 01:30:49,253
If I ask you something,
will you say the truth?

1102
01:30:49,706 --> 01:30:54,988
Were you actually in the army,
or were you selling apples in Kashmir?

1103
01:30:55,644 --> 01:30:56,761
Hey Mapla!

1104
01:30:56,829 --> 01:30:58,996
Whenever I see her,
I lose all the courage I have.

1105
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:01,288
That's why I asked you
to tell me some way!

1106
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:03,303
Instead, if you mock me...

1107
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:05,085
Mathayi!

1108
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,288
Shall we make Lalimol ask her?

1109
01:31:08,226 --> 01:31:09,530
That's correct.
- Lalimol...

1110
01:31:09,937 --> 01:31:11,054
My sister.

1111
01:31:11,546 --> 01:31:13,069
Sheesh!

1112
01:31:13,216 --> 01:31:14,957
It will be a disgrace.
No! No!

1113
01:31:15,176 --> 01:31:18,300
If so, I'll go and tell her.
This is a silly case, right?

1114
01:31:18,325 --> 01:31:22,137
If I see you in that area,
I'll set your coir hair on fire!

1115
01:31:23,215 --> 01:31:25,301
Then go say it on your own!
Go! Go!

1116
01:31:26,074 --> 01:31:27,613
Mathayi, son...

1117
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,832
Don't stay out in the cold.
You'll lose the little courage you have.

1118
01:31:31,934 --> 01:31:32,934
Hey!

1119
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:35,199
Shall I present it?

1120
01:31:35,348 --> 01:31:38,347
I'll go and tell the Father as a
marriage proposal. Official deal.

1121
01:31:38,871 --> 01:31:39,933
That's good.

1122
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:42,738
This is your problem.

1123
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,511
It was a decent idea!

1124
01:31:44,621 --> 01:31:45,954
Pour some water too.

1125
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:49,558
The water is running through the drainage.
Go & get it!

1126
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:50,930
Give me one!

1127
01:31:54,235 --> 01:31:56,852
It's said that we should be
tied up after three rounds.

1128
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,397
Then you give me an idea!

1129
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:01,906
Mathayi!

1130
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:03,834
It's the best idea!

1131
01:32:04,147 --> 01:32:06,373
We have been successful
at it long back!

1132
01:32:07,256 --> 01:32:08,404
Which one?

1133
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:09,740
Try to remember!

1134
01:32:22,006 --> 01:32:23,060
Give me your hand!

1135
01:32:23,685 --> 01:32:24,888
Got an idea!

1136
01:32:25,632 --> 01:32:27,038
What idea is it?

1137
01:32:27,155 --> 01:32:29,193
Say it!
Come on, say it!

1138
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:30,754
I won't say it.
- Then?

1139
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:35,348
I'll do it and show you!

1140
01:32:38,317 --> 01:32:39,324
What is it, Mathayi?

1141
01:32:39,349 --> 01:32:42,297
Can you give me one paper
from your book, dear?

1142
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:48,525
Do you want a ruled
paper or un-ruled paper?

1143
01:32:49,401 --> 01:32:50,401
Well...

1144
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:52,606
Give me a ruled one.

1145
01:32:53,013 --> 01:32:55,692
The letters needn't go
slanted when I write.

1146
01:33:01,682 --> 01:33:04,103
My dear darling...
The apple of my eye!

1147
01:33:05,229 --> 01:33:06,229
No need of all that!

1148
01:33:08,807 --> 01:33:12,218
My sweethearts, my babe,
my strawberry!

1149
01:33:16,726 --> 01:33:22,937
'The yellow flower that
blossomed in my memory'

1150
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:26,142
O' yellow flower.
Won't work?

1151
01:33:26,431 --> 01:33:28,845
Then call her by name.
Then you can touch her heart.

1152
01:33:31,032 --> 01:33:32,796
For my dear Anna...

1153
01:33:33,406 --> 01:33:34,406
This will be awesome!

1154
01:33:34,851 --> 01:33:37,024
Oh! You are playing it here?

1155
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,125
Hey Mapla!

1156
01:33:39,674 --> 01:33:42,415
It's late. It's time for the bank.
Shouldn't we go? - Hey Babu!

1157
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:46,052
If things work out today,
I'll sing on the street today.

1158
01:33:46,623 --> 01:33:48,349
Is the song alone enough?
- No.

1159
01:33:48,374 --> 01:33:49,374
Then let's go!

1160
01:34:01,897 --> 01:34:03,685
How come you're all
energetic today?

1161
01:34:04,233 --> 01:34:05,482
Yes! Yes!

1162
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,248
What are you doing with the gun?

1163
01:34:10,913 --> 01:34:12,075
For some courage!

1164
01:34:19,516 --> 01:34:23,021
Hey! There are only 30 Laddoos.
Shall I get Jilebis too?

1165
01:34:23,076 --> 01:34:24,279
Laddoo was better.

1166
01:34:26,947 --> 01:34:27,947
Hey girl...

1167
01:34:29,856 --> 01:34:30,856
Well...

1168
01:34:31,455 --> 01:34:32,950
There's a lot of dust here.

1169
01:34:33,075 --> 01:34:35,075
Get your broom and
clean this area.

1170
01:34:35,116 --> 01:34:37,333
I'll come now.
I'll sweep it once this rice is boiled.

1171
01:34:39,468 --> 01:34:41,909
Otherwise, lunch might get spoiled.

1172
01:34:42,707 --> 01:34:44,253
Oops! It fell down!

1173
01:34:45,394 --> 01:34:46,420
Coming!

1174
01:34:46,866 --> 01:34:47,866
Okay.

1175
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:49,913
But make it fast!

1176
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:52,287
The broom!

1177
01:34:52,316 --> 01:34:53,566
I'm coming!

1178
01:34:54,729 --> 01:34:55,729
What happened?

1179
01:34:56,194 --> 01:34:57,264
It will happen now.

1180
01:34:57,381 --> 01:34:59,029
She's boiling.
- What?

1181
01:34:59,654 --> 01:35:01,388
Rice.
- What's that got to do with this?

1182
01:35:01,756 --> 01:35:04,060
She can sweep only after
boiling the rice, right?

1183
01:35:05,829 --> 01:35:06,829
Sweep what?

1184
01:35:10,692 --> 01:35:13,548
Sweep this place clean.
- What's this got to do with that?

1185
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,770
The broom is where the magic is!

1186
01:35:17,481 --> 01:35:18,481
What magic?

1187
01:35:18,911 --> 01:35:19,911
Babu!

1188
01:35:21,065 --> 01:35:22,065
Who is it for?

1189
01:35:22,325 --> 01:35:23,325
For Mathayi!

1190
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:26,760
Hello!
This is Babu.

1191
01:35:26,785 --> 01:35:28,269
Babuchetta, it's Lalimol.

1192
01:35:28,339 --> 01:35:30,098
What's the status?
Is she okay?

1193
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:31,350
Lalimol...

1194
01:35:32,228 --> 01:35:33,638
The broom is where the magic is!

1195
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,330
Mathayi!

1196
01:35:37,846 --> 01:35:38,846
Mathayi!

1197
01:35:44,801 --> 01:35:45,801
Jesus!

1198
01:35:47,274 --> 01:35:48,484
Mathayi...
- Yes.

1199
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:50,633
You need to reach the
treasury by 11 AM.

1200
01:35:50,673 --> 01:35:51,673
Don't be late.

1201
01:35:51,971 --> 01:35:53,850
No, sir.
I'll leave at sharp 11 AM.

1202
01:35:56,086 --> 01:35:57,086
I mean... Sorry.

1203
01:35:57,901 --> 01:35:59,218
I'll start at 10.30 AM.

1204
01:35:59,406 --> 01:36:00,406
At 10.30.

1205
01:36:05,646 --> 01:36:06,937
Shall I get you a broom, sir?

1206
01:36:07,638 --> 01:36:08,638
What for?

1207
01:36:10,568 --> 01:36:13,469
If there's dusty, we can get it
swept and cleaned up, right?

1208
01:36:14,749 --> 01:36:15,887
But where's the dust here?

1209
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:17,062
There's no dust.

1210
01:36:17,656 --> 01:36:18,750
Dust will come, right?

1211
01:36:21,383 --> 01:36:22,732
Keep your cap properly.

1212
01:36:26,494 --> 01:36:27,506
Okay, sir.

1213
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:32,525
Satheeshan, aren't you ready yet?

1214
01:36:32,689 --> 01:36:36,220
Sir, didn't you say the funeral is at
12 PM? Why have you come so early?

1215
01:36:36,363 --> 01:36:37,456
That's the funeral.

1216
01:36:37,582 --> 01:36:38,928
This is the resurrection!

1217
01:36:42,226 --> 01:36:43,553
What must have happened, Mapla?

1218
01:36:44,586 --> 01:36:45,653
Vijayetta, okay!

1219
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,022
For Anna.

1220
01:37:25,117 --> 01:37:26,843
Chechi, let me explain.
- For Anna.

1221
01:37:26,931 --> 01:37:28,680
I don't know how to say this.

1222
01:37:28,705 --> 01:37:30,637
Still, for such a long time...

1223
01:37:32,529 --> 01:37:34,476
So it's a love letter?
- Give it to me, Chechi.

1224
01:37:36,366 --> 01:37:38,544
Breaking news!

1225
01:37:38,569 --> 01:37:40,401
All of you, please listen.

1226
01:37:40,546 --> 01:37:44,462
One love and one love letter
has been caught from our bank!

1227
01:37:44,799 --> 01:37:46,400
Who wrote it, to whom?

1228
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:48,743
Don't go, stay here.

1229
01:37:50,062 --> 01:37:52,119
Did you realize who
our heroine is, now?

1230
01:37:54,057 --> 01:37:55,351
Why are you so shy?

1231
01:37:55,477 --> 01:37:58,820
Since it's shady business, we need
no doubts as to who the hero is!

1232
01:38:02,015 --> 01:38:04,935
Mr. Mathayi, whom you all are
so fond of, is the hero!

1233
01:38:05,264 --> 01:38:07,311
Why?
Can't any of you believe it?

1234
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,171
Then you must believe it.
Here's the proof!

1235
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:11,210
Mathayi sir...

1236
01:38:11,733 --> 01:38:13,107
You're smart, man!

1237
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:16,831
Don't humiliate me, sir.
- Is it?

1238
01:38:16,856 --> 01:38:19,570
You can do this nonsense.
And when people know it, it's humiliation?

1239
01:38:19,957 --> 01:38:21,166
Aren't you ashamed?
Leave me!

1240
01:38:21,191 --> 01:38:22,769
Mathayi, what is this?

1241
01:38:22,794 --> 01:38:24,088
This is all his acting, sir.

1242
01:38:24,135 --> 01:38:25,907
This has been going on for
a while in this bank now.

1243
01:38:25,932 --> 01:38:27,447
He thinks that no one
else knows about it.

1244
01:38:27,572 --> 01:38:29,697
Soldier, it seems!
Don't you have any shame?

1245
01:38:49,062 --> 01:38:50,640
Did you actually do this?

1246
01:38:51,023 --> 01:38:53,018
You've seen the world, right?

1247
01:38:53,547 --> 01:38:55,711
Shouldn't you show at least
the maturity of your age?

1248
01:38:56,078 --> 01:38:57,203
This is like...

1249
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:59,505
If you had such a wish,

1250
01:38:59,943 --> 01:39:02,060
should you be taking such
a shady approach to it?

1251
01:39:03,756 --> 01:39:05,537
I don't know anything, sir.

1252
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:07,739
You heard her?

1253
01:39:07,927 --> 01:39:10,023
Since this girl doesn't
have such feelings for you,

1254
01:39:10,232 --> 01:39:11,872
This is like.. romance?

1255
01:39:12,163 --> 01:39:13,163
It's quite cheap!

1256
01:39:15,428 --> 01:39:16,428
Mathayi!

1257
01:39:16,835 --> 01:39:18,326
I didn't expect this from you.

1258
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:25,459
True, sir.

1259
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,600
It was quite cheap.

1260
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:33,206
Losing easily while
singing a song...

1261
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:35,362
That's what happened here.

1262
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,684
I don't know if it's love, sir.

1263
01:39:41,794 --> 01:39:43,246
When this Mathayi looked around,

1264
01:39:43,794 --> 01:39:44,950
everyone was with me.

1265
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:47,416
Mathayi was happy.

1266
01:39:48,823 --> 01:39:49,823
But...

1267
01:39:51,534 --> 01:39:52,604
I am alone, sir.

1268
01:39:58,423 --> 01:40:00,354
It was wrong to have wished
without asking you.

1269
01:40:01,003 --> 01:40:02,003
It was wrong.

1270
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:04,165
A solace.

1271
01:40:04,493 --> 01:40:05,711
That's all I intended.

1272
01:40:08,047 --> 01:40:09,564
I made a mistake, sir.

1273
01:40:09,846 --> 01:40:11,087
Please forgive it.

1274
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:13,573
Then...

1275
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,754
Life is made up of all
such things, right sir?

1276
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:18,629
Right?

1277
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,834
Why are all of you looking at me?

1278
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:37,973
Swami, it's time for the bank to open.
You sit there.

1279
01:40:38,514 --> 01:40:39,514
Reena Ma'am,

1280
01:40:39,539 --> 01:40:42,194
those people from the association
will come now to repay the loan.

1281
01:40:43,104 --> 01:40:46,093
Zubeida Ma'am, sit down. The chit
fund people will come. Handle them.

1282
01:40:47,046 --> 01:40:48,327
Babu, go and buy tea.

1283
01:40:50,396 --> 01:40:51,739
I'll leave this door open.

1284
01:40:52,028 --> 01:40:53,028
Sit! Sit!

1285
01:41:42,624 --> 01:41:43,624
What happened?

1286
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:54,614
Is everything okay?

1287
01:41:58,792 --> 01:42:00,619
Okay!
- Triple okay!

1288
01:42:03,752 --> 01:42:04,947
Play the drums!

1289
01:42:31,725 --> 01:42:32,782
Awesome, man!

1290
01:42:35,443 --> 01:42:36,443
What's that?

1291
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,689
Come!

1292
01:43:11,355 --> 01:43:12,659
He is a soldier.

1293
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,681
He has travelled all
over North India.

1294
01:43:15,204 --> 01:43:16,618
You enquired all that, right?

1295
01:43:17,033 --> 01:43:19,454
No one else that we
don't know of...

1296
01:43:19,759 --> 01:43:21,885
He doesn't have friends
that we don't know of.

1297
01:43:22,565 --> 01:43:23,877
We enquired over there too.

1298
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:26,131
Wherever he goes,
he goes only after telling us.

1299
01:43:26,631 --> 01:43:28,909
It's been so many days since
he went missing, sir.

1300
01:43:33,401 --> 01:43:35,641
Anyway we've made the investigation
stronger. Let's see.

1301
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:36,909
Okay, sir.

1302
01:43:37,652 --> 01:43:39,964
We've searched everywhere we can,
for the past 6 days.

1303
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:41,303
No use!

1304
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:43,381
Has he gone to some relative's place?

1305
01:43:43,569 --> 01:43:45,659
Mathayi doesn't have relatives
whom I don't know of.

1306
01:43:45,788 --> 01:43:48,241
Lalimol is going on calling
every other minute.

1307
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:49,580
She's crying non-stop.

1308
01:43:50,206 --> 01:43:53,698
Are you happy now that all of
you ruined that guy's life?

1309
01:43:53,745 --> 01:43:55,814
All this happened because
he did something wrong!

1310
01:43:55,839 --> 01:43:58,071
You're talking as if I
sent him away on purpose.

1311
01:44:05,975 --> 01:44:08,451
Hey! No!
Enough of your help!

1312
01:44:09,754 --> 01:44:10,754
Thanks!

1313
01:44:17,768 --> 01:44:19,276
Keep that bunch too.

1314
01:44:22,572 --> 01:44:24,158
You've come again!

1315
01:44:24,947 --> 01:44:28,173
After giving hopes to that guy, and
humiliating him in front of everyone,

1316
01:44:28,189 --> 01:44:29,618
she has come again!

1317
01:44:29,953 --> 01:44:32,890
You will suffer!
Mathayi's curse will be upon your head!

1318
01:44:32,965 --> 01:44:34,535
What wrong did he do?

1319
01:44:34,653 --> 01:44:36,598
She's posing like a Saint!

1320
01:44:38,459 --> 01:44:41,559
Pennamma, don't we know
what kind of girl she is?

1321
01:44:41,622 --> 01:44:42,692
You come here.

1322
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:44,356
Walk fast.

1323
01:45:16,254 --> 01:45:18,918
So we heard many love stories, right?

1324
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:23,355
You're listening to Super hits Red FM Yuva,
'Shall I tell you a love story?'

1325
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:27,630
There will be a love that we keep in our
heart without telling anyone, right?

1326
01:45:27,974 --> 01:45:31,575
We often wish to confess
that love, as well.

1327
01:45:31,682 --> 01:45:33,872
Since we are sharing our experiences...

1328
01:45:34,024 --> 01:45:36,500
By experiences, I mean our love,

1329
01:45:36,736 --> 01:45:38,059
our pain, everything.

1330
01:45:38,309 --> 01:45:42,371
To listen to that, as a dear friend, we
have Vijay Sethupathi sir. - Dear...

1331
01:45:42,519 --> 01:45:44,199
Pour some Sambar.

1332
01:45:48,721 --> 01:45:52,197
Hello, welcome to Red FM Yuva,
'Shall I tell you a love story?'

1333
01:45:52,222 --> 01:45:55,127
So who has called to 'Shall
I tell you a love story?'

1334
01:45:57,364 --> 01:45:58,364
Hello?
- Did it get cut?

1335
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:01,370
Call.

1336
01:46:01,419 --> 01:46:02,419
Call back.

1337
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,475
We shouldn't miss even one love story.
Call back. - Okay.

1338
01:46:11,877 --> 01:46:13,074
Pick up that phone!

1339
01:46:26,025 --> 01:46:27,025
Tell me.

1340
01:46:31,869 --> 01:46:32,869
What's your name?

1341
01:46:34,886 --> 01:46:35,886
Anna.

1342
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,196
Anna, seems like you are
in some kind of tension.

1343
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:41,964
Shall we do something?

1344
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:45,104
Keep that tension away!

1345
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,630
And then...

1346
01:46:48,365 --> 01:46:49,957
just close your eyes!

1347
01:46:50,668 --> 01:46:54,895
Think about the happiest
incident in your life.

1348
01:46:56,033 --> 01:46:57,033
Did you remember it?

1349
01:46:57,753 --> 01:47:00,127
Now tell us what that incident was.

1350
01:47:01,087 --> 01:47:02,087
We will listen to it.

1351
01:47:13,637 --> 01:47:15,105
That huge courtyard of the Church...

1352
01:47:16,246 --> 01:47:18,542
and the Mother who blesses
those who pray to her,

1353
01:47:19,028 --> 01:47:21,121
and we were the ones
making brooms for them.

1354
01:47:21,793 --> 01:47:24,056
One day, my grandma left me.

1355
01:47:24,807 --> 01:47:26,166
Leaving me alone.

1356
01:47:31,091 --> 01:47:33,186
Only Father Murikkel was
there for me, thereafter.

1357
01:47:33,211 --> 01:47:34,540
Then when I came to this bank,

1358
01:47:34,811 --> 01:47:36,420
this also become
like a home for me.

1359
01:47:37,358 --> 01:47:39,191
No one saw me as a sweeper.

1360
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,386
Many people who were my own.

1361
01:47:41,754 --> 01:47:43,730
I only knew God.

1362
01:47:44,384 --> 01:47:47,251
When I came here,
I saw someone like God too.

1363
01:47:48,071 --> 01:47:49,071
The soldier.

1364
01:47:50,118 --> 01:47:51,477
Someone who never hurts anyone,

1365
01:47:52,278 --> 01:47:54,614
and prays for the well
being of everyone.

1366
01:47:55,639 --> 01:47:57,251
When I come to the
bank every morning,

1367
01:48:00,038 --> 01:48:04,058
he comes to me with a smiling face,
calling me 'Hey girl'. The soldier.

1368
01:48:05,252 --> 01:48:09,291
Even to call you,
he was the one who gave me courage, sir.

1369
01:48:11,501 --> 01:48:12,501
You know him, sir.

1370
01:48:13,033 --> 01:48:14,033
The soldier.

1371
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:15,322
Is that so?

1372
01:48:15,616 --> 01:48:16,736
Who is he?

1373
01:48:18,086 --> 01:48:19,515
If you talk to him once,

1374
01:48:20,265 --> 01:48:21,333
no one will forget him.

1375
01:48:22,084 --> 01:48:24,099
So, who is that soldier?

1376
01:48:26,138 --> 01:48:27,138
Mathayi.

1377
01:48:27,365 --> 01:48:28,365
Mathayi?

1378
01:48:28,759 --> 01:48:30,284
Our Marconi Mathayi?

1379
01:48:31,745 --> 01:48:33,307
He's a superb human being!

1380
01:48:33,762 --> 01:48:35,874
What problem do you have
when he's with you?

1381
01:48:37,651 --> 01:48:38,651
No, sir.

1382
01:48:39,972 --> 01:48:41,831
That man who never hurt anyone....

1383
01:48:43,636 --> 01:48:44,636
I hurt him.

1384
01:48:47,106 --> 01:48:48,271
What happened?

1385
01:48:48,595 --> 01:48:50,125
Where is he now?

1386
01:48:50,727 --> 01:48:51,727
I don't know.

1387
01:48:51,876 --> 01:48:52,876
Please don't cry.

1388
01:48:53,197 --> 01:48:54,197
He went away somewhere.

1389
01:48:57,953 --> 01:48:59,954
Even after everyone searching
for him everywhere,

1390
01:49:00,883 --> 01:49:02,516
we don't know where he is, sir.

1391
01:49:06,485 --> 01:49:08,376
I want the soldier back.

1392
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:10,957
I wish that he should
be here always!

1393
01:49:11,855 --> 01:49:15,050
Will you be able to bring him back?
- Oops.

1394
01:49:16,277 --> 01:49:17,926
Just tell him that Anna
is asking for him.

1395
01:49:18,653 --> 01:49:21,105
He'll come if you tell him.
He likes you that much!

1396
01:49:21,866 --> 01:49:23,040
Will you tell him?

1397
01:49:24,118 --> 01:49:25,118
Will you?

1398
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,493
I need some water.

1399
01:49:39,415 --> 01:49:40,415
Some water, please.

1400
01:49:42,974 --> 01:49:43,974
Anna...

1401
01:49:46,246 --> 01:49:48,691
Even if all of us in
the world call him,

1402
01:49:49,426 --> 01:49:51,128
that sound would be too less.

1403
01:49:54,734 --> 01:49:56,424
But you call him with love.

1404
01:49:57,639 --> 01:49:59,749
Whichever corner of this
world he might be in,

1405
01:50:00,233 --> 01:50:01,545
he will hear it.

1406
01:50:03,365 --> 01:50:04,966
Mathayi will come looking for you.

1407
01:50:05,709 --> 01:50:06,863
You call him!

1408
01:50:08,593 --> 01:50:11,706
Call him with love and affection!

1409
01:50:13,811 --> 01:50:15,467
Mathayi will come
back for this Anna.

1410
01:50:47,877 --> 01:50:49,110
To be frank, Rinu...

1411
01:50:49,135 --> 01:50:52,369
When Vijay Sethupathi sir left
our studio so emotionally,

1412
01:50:52,424 --> 01:50:54,642
I felt really sad.

1413
01:51:50,648 --> 01:51:52,952
Hello!
We will search for Mathayi.

1414
01:51:53,045 --> 01:51:56,189
While coming and going, and in the
bus, we will look for him everywhere.

1415
01:51:56,214 --> 01:51:58,779
We'll get back to you.
A caller has joined us now.

1416
01:51:58,866 --> 01:52:00,132
Super hits Red FM...

1417
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:10,070
We are getting so many calls now.

1418
01:52:20,268 --> 01:52:21,729
Moving on to the first caller.

1419
01:52:24,151 --> 01:52:26,346
I will also search for Mathayi, sir.
I swear!

1420
01:52:30,748 --> 01:52:31,748
This is my father.

1421
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:34,753
This is my mother.

1422
01:52:59,929 --> 01:53:02,242
We're discussing about Anna
& Mathayi's love story.

1423
01:53:02,267 --> 01:53:04,180
In these days of ditching,
such a romance?

1424
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:05,930
Awesome, Anna.
We are with you!

1425
01:53:14,075 --> 01:53:16,763
Hello sir, I am James.
- That's what's on everyone's mind.

1426
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,935
What's your name?
- I'm not Mathayi. sir.

1427
01:53:25,132 --> 01:53:27,926
We should do whatever necessary
to find him, sincerely.

1428
01:53:27,951 --> 01:53:29,987
The entire Red FM team
is in search of him.

1429
01:53:30,012 --> 01:53:31,812
If we search together,
we can find Mathayi.

1430
01:53:35,677 --> 01:53:37,397
Mathayi...
Anna....

1431
01:53:38,038 --> 01:53:39,710
I haven't met both
of them in person.

1432
01:53:41,214 --> 01:53:42,813
As far as I'm concerned,
in life...

1433
01:53:43,808 --> 01:53:45,820
there wouldn't be any human
who hasn't felt love!

1434
01:53:46,984 --> 01:53:48,343
What I have now,

1435
01:53:49,016 --> 01:53:51,461
is just Mathayi's smiling photo.

1436
01:53:52,047 --> 01:53:53,726
Mathayi and Anna should unite.

1437
01:53:55,109 --> 01:53:57,304
I believe that all of you
would help that cause.

1438
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:00,645
Mathayi, look there

1439
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:02,130
He's holding the gun!

1440
01:54:03,064 --> 01:54:04,595
He'd never let go of the gun!

1441
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:28,365
Hello sir.
My name is Angel.

1442
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:29,818
Tell me, Angel.

1443
01:54:29,943 --> 01:54:31,521
We are in Kochi now, sir.

1444
01:54:31,825 --> 01:54:36,375
Last week, we were in Goa. There, we had
seen the Mathayi you're looking for.

1445
01:54:36,791 --> 01:54:37,791
Are you sure?

1446
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:40,629
Yes. We came to know about this
only after coming back here.

1447
01:54:40,727 --> 01:54:44,308
And when we saw Mathayi's photo on our
friend's Facebook accounts, we were sure.

1448
01:54:44,533 --> 01:54:46,246
Are you sure that it's Mathayi?

1449
01:54:46,271 --> 01:54:48,626
It's Mathayi, indeed sir.
He is in Goa.

1450
01:54:49,353 --> 01:54:50,353
Thank you.

1451
01:54:50,525 --> 01:54:51,525
Thanks, Angel.

1452
01:54:51,837 --> 01:54:52,837
Super, right?

1453
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:14,407
Dear...

1454
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:16,055
Mathayi might be a good person.

1455
01:55:16,875 --> 01:55:18,281
Since he has left,

1456
01:55:18,398 --> 01:55:21,062
he should decide himself to come back!

1457
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:26,074
How long will you wait for someone,
who has no guarantee of coming back?

1458
01:55:28,627 --> 01:55:30,330
All these commotions,

1459
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:32,455
will end soon.

1460
01:55:34,025 --> 01:55:36,322
People will go behind
the latest news.

1461
01:55:37,171 --> 01:55:39,159
Finally,
you will end up alone.

1462
01:55:40,711 --> 01:55:43,496
Justin likes you.

1463
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:47,069
There are two ways
in front of you.

1464
01:55:47,843 --> 01:55:50,528
You yourself should decide
which is the better path.

1465
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:11,571
My dear sister, do you
know that Goa is a state?

1466
01:56:12,204 --> 01:56:15,360
Rather than finding someone
with just a photo here,

1467
01:56:15,538 --> 01:56:17,960
it's easier to search for 50
paise at the Aluva ground.

1468
01:56:18,289 --> 01:56:20,156
You hold this, sister.

1469
01:56:20,926 --> 01:56:25,191
And then go back to that road, catch
the first bus and go back home. Bye!

1470
01:56:34,377 --> 01:56:35,977
Didn't you understand what I said?

1471
01:56:36,735 --> 01:56:38,266
This is not our state.

1472
01:56:40,254 --> 01:56:41,830
It's not safe to stay here like this.

1473
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:43,323
That's why I'm saying this.

1474
01:56:43,348 --> 01:56:44,511
It's been two days, right?

1475
01:56:44,769 --> 01:56:45,980
Nothing happened, right?

1476
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:47,980
That's all that's
going to happen.

1477
01:56:48,425 --> 01:56:50,191
That's why I'm asking
you to leave, sister.

1478
01:56:51,948 --> 01:56:52,948
Won't even listen!

1479
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,658
Then do one thing.

1480
01:57:05,641 --> 01:57:06,641
Come with me, sister.

1481
01:57:09,023 --> 01:57:10,031
Hop on!

1482
01:57:11,181 --> 01:57:12,516
Why are you in tensed?

1483
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:14,801
Don't worry.

1484
01:57:14,826 --> 01:57:18,340
I will find that Muthu
before sunrise tomorrow.

1485
01:57:18,546 --> 01:57:19,546
Which Muthu?

1486
01:57:20,038 --> 01:57:21,305
That missing person.

1487
01:57:21,718 --> 01:57:23,350
That's not Muthu.
It's Mathayi.

1488
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:24,910
Yes.
Mathayi.

1489
01:57:28,119 --> 01:57:30,120
When I was a child,
it was just like this.

1490
01:57:30,728 --> 01:57:32,603
My dad left saying that
he'll buy candy for me.

1491
01:57:33,103 --> 01:57:34,244
And he disappeared!

1492
01:57:34,589 --> 01:57:37,245
It's been 20 years now.
We haven't found him till date.

1493
01:57:37,839 --> 01:57:40,995
That's why, whenever I hear that
someone's gone missing like this,

1494
01:57:41,964 --> 01:57:43,752
I'll have a slight
pain in my chest, sir.

1495
01:57:45,182 --> 01:57:48,073
Don't worry.
We will find Muthu, okay?

1496
01:58:01,753 --> 01:58:03,991
Look carefully man.
- We haven't seen him.

1497
01:58:04,016 --> 01:58:05,159
Think once again.

1498
01:58:05,539 --> 01:58:06,939
Okay! I will try to remember!

1499
01:58:15,216 --> 01:58:17,036
Isn't this our Mathews?
- Mathews?

1500
01:58:17,935 --> 01:58:20,099
Not Mathews...
Muthu Muthu...!

1501
01:58:21,638 --> 01:58:23,853
Mathayi.
- Is he here? - He was here.

1502
01:58:23,878 --> 01:58:26,792
He was on duty here for 2 days
when the security went home here.

1503
01:58:27,386 --> 01:58:28,557
He is a good man.

1504
01:58:32,274 --> 01:58:34,953
[Speaking in local language]

1505
01:58:37,254 --> 01:58:38,474
I will call you

1506
01:58:39,386 --> 01:58:41,019
Hey! They haven't seen him.

1507
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:44,059
But since it's such a matter,
they said they will enquire.

1508
01:58:44,886 --> 01:58:46,074
Let's search, then.

1509
01:58:52,577 --> 01:58:56,367
Hey Britto! Don't you know Cleetus
uncle from Matha studio? - Yes.

1510
01:58:56,682 --> 01:58:59,705
Go and meet him.
He goes around Goa all the time, right?

1511
01:58:59,924 --> 01:59:01,283
You might get some idea.

1512
01:59:02,642 --> 01:59:05,981
There's a guy called Cleetus who runs
a studio here. Let's go and meet him.

1513
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:12,712
Sir, there are many companies that provide
private security service in Goa alone.

1514
01:59:12,947 --> 01:59:15,118
We went to all those
places, but...

1515
01:59:16,022 --> 01:59:17,483
Sir, we're trying all ways.

1516
01:59:17,717 --> 01:59:20,186
Since it's Christmas after 2 days,
people are all busy here.

1517
01:59:20,211 --> 01:59:21,406
That's the problem.

1518
01:59:40,641 --> 01:59:41,945
Hey Mathayi!

1519
01:59:42,438 --> 01:59:44,101
Where are you, man?

1520
01:59:56,041 --> 01:59:57,712
Abhi! Abhi!

1521
01:59:58,330 --> 01:59:59,454
What?
- Mathayi! Mathayi!

1522
01:59:59,553 --> 02:00:01,064
Where?
- Mathayi!

1523
02:00:01,491 --> 02:00:03,616
Come!
Come on!

1524
02:00:04,905 --> 02:00:05,905
Mathayi!

1525
02:00:08,977 --> 02:00:10,367
Where are you running off to?

1526
02:00:13,577 --> 02:00:14,577
Where?

1527
02:00:16,414 --> 02:00:17,414
Which one?

1528
02:00:17,782 --> 02:00:18,782
That one?

1529
02:00:21,063 --> 02:00:22,396
What is it?
- Oops.

1530
02:00:23,844 --> 02:00:24,844
Sorry sir.

1531
02:00:25,197 --> 02:00:26,197
No problem.

1532
02:01:12,327 --> 02:01:13,736
Don't you want to have dinner?

1533
02:01:15,439 --> 02:01:16,439
Okay then.

1534
02:01:17,059 --> 02:01:20,058
Sister, no need of any tension.
We will find him.

1535
02:01:20,458 --> 02:01:22,333
I will come early in the morning!
Okay then!

1536
02:01:43,767 --> 02:01:44,767
Drink it.

1537
02:01:44,986 --> 02:01:46,041
It will cool you down.

1538
02:02:26,126 --> 02:02:27,188
Shall we go?

1539
02:02:38,063 --> 02:02:40,626
They are making us go in rounds!

1540
02:02:43,918 --> 02:02:44,949
You ask them.

1541
02:02:45,044 --> 02:02:46,044
There?
- Yes.

1542
02:02:49,154 --> 02:02:50,554
Brother...
- One minute.

1543
02:02:53,653 --> 02:02:55,879
Have you seen him?
- No. I don't know him.

1544
02:02:56,739 --> 02:02:57,739
Let's go!

1545
02:03:00,191 --> 02:03:04,504
Did this Mathayi escape
after cheating that girl?

1546
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:07,035
My dear Ikka, after listening
to the whole Ramayana,

1547
02:03:07,427 --> 02:03:08,838
don't ask me who Shiva is!

1548
02:03:09,558 --> 02:03:11,596
This is not one of your
fraud tricks, right?

1549
02:03:11,621 --> 02:03:14,050
My dear Ikka, look at that girl's face.

1550
02:03:14,308 --> 02:03:15,308
So graceful!

1551
02:03:15,768 --> 02:03:16,972
Does she look like a fraud?

1552
02:03:17,229 --> 02:03:19,916
If that's so, will I go behind this
sacrificing my job for 2 days?

1553
02:03:23,463 --> 02:03:24,463
Come here, dear.

1554
02:03:26,991 --> 02:03:27,991
Dear...

1555
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:32,318
Wherever Mathayi is in Goa, Kunjalikka
will find him & bring him before you.

1556
02:03:32,343 --> 02:03:33,986
You don't have to worry, okay?

1557
02:03:34,366 --> 02:03:35,600
Isn't that fine?
- Yes.

1558
02:03:43,670 --> 02:03:48,024
Boys, the name of the guy in the
photo I just sent, is Mathayi.

1559
02:03:48,149 --> 02:03:49,243
Mathews.

1560
02:03:49,268 --> 02:03:52,064
Wherever you see him,
tell him that his girl is here.

1561
02:03:52,089 --> 02:03:55,123
If he does some mischief,
beat him up and bring him here.

1562
02:04:00,059 --> 02:04:01,059
Dear...

1563
02:04:01,423 --> 02:04:02,540
This is Goa.

1564
02:04:02,844 --> 02:04:06,394
If he's anywhere in this Goa,
Kunjalikka will find him.

1565
02:04:07,108 --> 02:04:10,416
And the good heart you had to
come in search of him, alone....

1566
02:04:10,821 --> 02:04:12,337
God wouldn't ignore it.

1567
02:04:12,462 --> 02:04:15,017
If I had searched for my father
like I'm searching now...

1568
02:04:15,353 --> 02:04:17,829
My father would have been at my house now,
do you know that?

1569
02:04:18,778 --> 02:04:19,778
Give it.

1570
02:04:22,548 --> 02:04:23,548
Brother...

1571
02:04:31,236 --> 02:04:32,236
Do you know him?

1572
02:04:32,564 --> 02:04:33,564
Mathayi..!!

1573
02:04:34,259 --> 02:04:36,072
Do you know him?
- Mathayi...

1574
02:04:36,097 --> 02:04:37,097
Where have you seen him?

1575
02:04:37,588 --> 02:04:39,444
He just had tea from here,
made a call, and left.

1576
02:04:39,469 --> 02:04:40,742
Really?
- Yes.

1577
02:04:40,910 --> 02:04:42,440
Abhi! Abhi!

1578
02:04:43,191 --> 02:04:44,191
Muthu! Muthu!

1579
02:04:44,824 --> 02:04:45,824
Mathayi!

1580
02:04:46,456 --> 02:04:47,523
Mathayi?
- Yes.

1581
02:04:49,330 --> 02:04:51,229
He just had tea here,
made a call and left now.

1582
02:04:51,974 --> 02:04:52,990
Is it?

1583
02:04:53,584 --> 02:04:55,259
Brother, was it him?
- Yes.

1584
02:04:55,549 --> 02:04:56,882
Mathayi?
- Mathayi.

1585
02:04:58,453 --> 02:05:01,030
Brother, where is he now?
- That I don't know.

1586
02:05:01,484 --> 02:05:02,960
Leave it.
Where does he stay?

1587
02:05:03,633 --> 02:05:05,703
I don't know. Why?
- Nothing.

1588
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:09,796
After he called, did anyone
make any call from this phone?

1589
02:05:09,859 --> 02:05:11,398
Who calls from this nowadays?

1590
02:05:11,874 --> 02:05:13,030
Where has he come from?

1591
02:05:17,515 --> 02:05:18,515
Let me redial.

1592
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:23,690
Local number.
- Yes.

1593
02:05:23,846 --> 02:05:25,791
So he's definitely in
this locality itself.

1594
02:05:26,814 --> 02:05:28,517
Yes. This is Mathew.

1595
02:05:28,752 --> 02:05:30,681
He keeps coming here, sometimes.

1596
02:05:30,955 --> 02:05:32,361
Whenever he comes,

1597
02:05:32,424 --> 02:05:35,142
he brings lot of different
things for our kids.

1598
02:05:36,314 --> 02:05:37,407
Thank you, sister.

1599
02:05:37,432 --> 02:05:42,032
Giving us lot of hopes, we are getting
more and more information about Mathayi.

1600
02:05:42,163 --> 02:05:43,327
That's a good sign.

1601
02:05:46,621 --> 02:05:48,566
Day after tomorrow, my
movie will release.

1602
02:05:49,175 --> 02:05:50,511
'Shall I tell you a love story?'

1603
02:05:51,473 --> 02:05:53,621
I believe that you will
support this film too.

1604
02:05:53,692 --> 02:05:54,847
Thank you so much.

1605
02:05:55,878 --> 02:05:59,582
I also wish that Mathayi will come
fast from Goa and meet Anna soon.

1606
02:06:00,961 --> 02:06:02,969
Next time I come to Kerala,

1607
02:06:03,658 --> 02:06:06,728
I want to see Mathayi
and Anna together.

1608
02:06:07,478 --> 02:06:08,478
My prayers.

1609
02:06:11,103 --> 02:06:12,103
I love you!

1610
02:06:13,064 --> 02:06:14,064
Love you.

1611
02:06:14,089 --> 02:06:15,479
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1612
02:06:20,657 --> 02:06:22,891
You fool! Where is Mathayi in this?
- Give it to me.

1613
02:06:25,294 --> 02:06:26,438
I had seen him in this.

1614
02:06:26,806 --> 02:06:28,139
Where did he go now?

1615
02:06:28,164 --> 02:06:29,269
Isn't this Mathayi?

1616
02:06:29,512 --> 02:06:31,074
At the back!
- Where? - This one?

1617
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:37,731
We got the soldier!

1618
02:06:38,621 --> 02:06:39,941
Give me the phone
- We found him!

1619
02:06:40,349 --> 02:06:41,349
Don't run!

1620
02:06:45,055 --> 02:06:48,586
It's correct!
Marty, which is this place?

1621
02:06:48,789 --> 02:06:50,655
I'm not really sure, Ikka.

1622
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:52,110
This...

1623
02:06:53,503 --> 02:06:55,986
Oh! Castle Cafe.
Baga beach.

1624
02:07:12,406 --> 02:07:13,406
Success, sir.

1625
02:07:14,756 --> 02:07:16,733
We found the place Mathayi is staying at.

1626
02:07:16,898 --> 02:07:18,179
We're on our way there.

1627
02:07:18,367 --> 02:07:19,552
Super! Super!

1628
02:07:19,577 --> 02:07:23,500
Just 10 minutes. Within 10 minutes,
Mathayi will come on voice live.

1629
02:07:23,684 --> 02:07:25,936
Okay! Okay!
Go there and call me.

1630
02:07:26,265 --> 02:07:27,475
Okay!
- All right.

1631
02:07:27,538 --> 02:07:32,303
You're listening to Superhits Red FM and
this is the last episode of Red FM Yuva.

1632
02:07:32,569 --> 02:07:33,569
Okay.

1633
02:07:33,959 --> 02:07:35,419
We're on the last
minute of the show.

1634
02:07:36,139 --> 02:07:38,209
I'm also really excited like Abhi.

1635
02:07:38,669 --> 02:07:39,700
I don't know why.

1636
02:07:41,928 --> 02:07:44,827
I believe Mathayi would talk
to us before this show ends.

1637
02:07:46,835 --> 02:07:47,913
Mathayi...

1638
02:07:48,609 --> 02:07:49,710
Come soon!

1639
02:08:00,678 --> 02:08:01,678
Hold this.

1640
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,499
Not there.
Should be over there.

1641
02:08:13,655 --> 02:08:14,922
That's not a house.

1642
02:08:16,913 --> 02:08:19,162
Let us go and check in that area.
Come.

1643
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:22,662
There he goes again.
Come here.

1644
02:08:22,733 --> 02:08:23,733
Over here!

1645
02:08:28,615 --> 02:08:29,615
Give that.

1646
02:08:39,491 --> 02:08:40,848
Have they reached?

1647
02:08:51,818 --> 02:08:53,872
They're saying that they've
also seen Mathayi.

1648
02:08:53,896 --> 02:08:55,427
But they don't know
where he is now.

1649
02:08:59,305 --> 02:09:00,305
Who?

1650
02:09:04,578 --> 02:09:05,578
Malayalis?

1651
02:09:10,547 --> 02:09:11,937
Brother, this Mathayi?

1652
02:09:11,988 --> 02:09:14,030
Mathayi was here a few days back.

1653
02:09:14,304 --> 02:09:15,304
But now he left.

1654
02:09:15,476 --> 02:09:16,476
Why?

1655
02:09:19,101 --> 02:09:20,101
Where did he go?

1656
02:09:20,182 --> 02:09:21,691
Even he wouldn't know that.

1657
02:09:21,847 --> 02:09:22,995
He's a bachelor, right?

1658
02:09:23,295 --> 02:09:25,730
There were some gypsies who had
come from Greece, over here.

1659
02:09:25,890 --> 02:09:27,234
He would have gone wit them.

1660
02:09:27,609 --> 02:09:30,997
Whenever I saw him, he used to
hang out with those gypsies.

1661
02:09:31,327 --> 02:09:33,053
Then he left with them!

1662
02:09:33,782 --> 02:09:36,266
Once he joins them,
don't look for him!

1663
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:39,367
Mathayi might have
reached Europe by now!

1664
02:09:46,048 --> 02:09:47,048
What is it, Ikka?

1665
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,800
Thank you.

1666
02:09:53,464 --> 02:09:55,221
What did they say?
- You tell her, Ikka.

1667
02:09:58,187 --> 02:09:59,187
Dear...

1668
02:09:59,545 --> 02:10:02,599
It was fine if he was in some other hell.
We could have found him.

1669
02:10:03,053 --> 02:10:05,787
These gypsies cannot
be handled by us.

1670
02:10:05,936 --> 02:10:08,537
We can't say where they come from,
and where they go to!

1671
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:12,670
Dear...

1672
02:10:13,019 --> 02:10:14,972
Don't waste your time
waiting for him.

1673
02:10:15,659 --> 02:10:16,862
He won't come, dear.

1674
02:10:32,589 --> 02:10:33,589
Sir.

1675
02:10:34,519 --> 02:10:36,159
We tried all ways, right?

1676
02:10:36,949 --> 02:10:38,084
Now it's their fate.

1677
02:10:38,709 --> 02:10:40,131
Should you be so stressed?

1678
02:10:46,288 --> 02:10:47,288
What?

1679
02:10:49,507 --> 02:10:51,366
Well, now... the conclusion?

1680
02:10:53,296 --> 02:10:54,932
We need to finish the show, right?
- Yes.

1681
02:10:54,957 --> 02:10:56,331
Whatever happens...

1682
02:11:00,056 --> 02:11:01,891
What should I do?
- This side.

1683
02:11:03,314 --> 02:11:04,314
Is it ready?

1684
02:11:09,466 --> 02:11:10,466
Just now...

1685
02:11:11,746 --> 02:11:14,427
RJ Renu who was with me
in the show, asked me...

1686
02:11:15,842 --> 02:11:17,402
'We tried so much, right?'

1687
02:11:18,634 --> 02:11:20,488
'What more can we do?'

1688
02:11:21,614 --> 02:11:24,028
I started this show with
a lot of happiness,

1689
02:11:24,871 --> 02:11:26,933
thinking that I'll listen
to many love stories here.

1690
02:11:27,647 --> 02:11:29,090
But Anna and Mathayi...

1691
02:11:31,578 --> 02:11:33,234
They are really good human beings.
But...

1692
02:11:34,138 --> 02:11:37,356
I feel sad that we couldn't unite them,
despite so many efforts from all of us.

1693
02:11:40,717 --> 02:11:42,427
But, for their love...

1694
02:11:43,112 --> 02:11:45,774
all of us stood united for so long,

1695
02:11:46,207 --> 02:11:47,792
and put in all our efforts.

1696
02:11:48,308 --> 02:11:50,104
Even though that makes me happy,

1697
02:11:51,094 --> 02:11:52,258
I feel sad.

1698
02:11:54,101 --> 02:11:56,430
Who's this Anna?
Who's this Mathayi?

1699
02:11:57,787 --> 02:11:59,152
Why should we do all this for them?

1700
02:11:59,177 --> 02:12:00,193
Why should I do this?

1701
02:12:01,631 --> 02:12:03,446
I didn't know that I
would be so disturbed.

1702
02:12:05,223 --> 02:12:06,873
With a lot of grief in my heart,

1703
02:12:08,285 --> 02:12:09,464
Vijay Sethupathi.

1704
02:12:11,114 --> 02:12:12,114
Tata, bye bye!

1705
02:12:14,104 --> 02:12:15,104
Love you all.

1706
02:12:15,486 --> 02:12:16,486
Thanks.

1707
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:19,600
Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

1708
02:12:28,939 --> 02:12:29,939
Don't worry, sister.

1709
02:12:30,391 --> 02:12:32,000
Let us search once more.

1710
02:12:34,695 --> 02:12:35,695
No.

1711
02:12:37,757 --> 02:12:39,382
What Father said is correct.

1712
02:12:40,803 --> 02:12:43,358
The soldier would return only
if he feels like it himself.

1713
02:12:45,765 --> 02:12:47,164
Where else can we search now?

1714
02:12:54,242 --> 02:12:57,368
The way you call me sister.
I'd never forget that.

1715
02:13:05,970 --> 02:13:06,970
Shall I go?

1716
02:15:39,649 --> 02:15:40,649
Anna?

1717
02:17:11,249 --> 02:17:12,640
We can only wish.

1718
02:17:13,507 --> 02:17:14,928
What happens, is not in our hands.

1719
02:17:18,865 --> 02:17:20,126
The one up there?

1720
02:17:20,736 --> 02:17:21,845
It's all his game.

1721
02:17:22,486 --> 02:17:23,486
Me...

1722
02:17:24,815 --> 02:17:26,649
and the photo we were
all searching with...

1723
02:17:35,499 --> 02:17:36,999
Without any

1724
02:17:38,374 --> 02:17:39,616
Mathayi's...

1725
02:17:41,802 --> 02:17:42,841
and Anna's...

1726
02:17:44,925 --> 02:17:45,925
love.

1727
02:17:47,074 --> 02:17:48,074
Romance!

1728
02:17:50,699 --> 02:17:51,699
Okay!

1729
02:17:51,778 --> 02:17:53,902
Okay, this is Vijay
Sethupathi signing off...

1730
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:55,832
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1731
02:17:56,301 --> 02:17:57,871
Thank you so much,
I love you!

1732
02:17:58,215 --> 02:18:00,332
I love you!
I love you all.

1733
02:18:00,989 --> 02:18:02,543
I love you all!

1734
02:18:07,851 --> 02:18:09,358
Mr. Mathayi...

1735
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:15,506
You look really smart, sir.

1736
02:18:16,184 --> 02:18:17,237
Then, sir...

1737
02:18:17,878 --> 02:18:19,276
You owe me a debt.

1738
02:18:19,301 --> 02:18:20,629
With your permission...

1739
02:18:21,722 --> 02:18:22,865
That pending hug?

1740
02:18:25,959 --> 02:18:27,309
Why don't you give me a kiss?

1741
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:41,120
Mathayi sir...

1742
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:43,950
How can you run away from
everyone without telling anyone?

1743
02:18:44,146 --> 02:18:45,146
Correct?

1744
02:18:45,982 --> 02:18:47,415
Anyway, I am happy now, sir.

1745
02:18:48,805 --> 02:18:50,141
I'm a soldier, right sir?

1746
02:18:51,245 --> 02:18:53,891
A colleague of mine from
the army was in Goa.

1747
02:18:53,970 --> 02:18:55,370
I was with him.

1748
02:18:56,184 --> 02:18:58,399
And... this life...

1749
02:18:58,462 --> 02:19:00,035
Life is how you live it, right sir?

1750
02:19:00,931 --> 02:19:02,860
Correct, sir?
- Yes.

1751
02:19:02,885 --> 02:19:03,885
Come!

1752
02:19:04,413 --> 02:19:05,413
I'm all sweaty...!!

1753
02:20:45,855 --> 02:20:47,253
What do I say?
