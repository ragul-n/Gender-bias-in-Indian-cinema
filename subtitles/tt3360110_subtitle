1
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,042
Hello, yes Rana Da

2
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,375
Don't behave like an absurd Bengali

3
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,292
Exercise doesn't deflate your mind,
it strengthens your body

4
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,125
What's the good news?

5
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:46,458
When?

6
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,375
But I don't know him

7
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,042
Which shirt?

8
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:57,750
The one I wore last time?

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,708
What the hell!

10
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,125
He hung up

11
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,417
Ma!

12
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:08,667
Ma!

13
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,000
Have you seen my orange shirt?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,458
Hurry up Gaju Da...
I need to leave in 5 minutes

15
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,833
I make my way through
lanes and shortcuts..

16
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,750
...known streets all
paved with gold

17
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:29,625
the sweet, narrow lanes
which drive me to school

18
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,000
A blank canvas
pulls me back..

19
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,083
...painted with the
lights of the bypass

20
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,250
The sky is now engulfed
in shadows..

21
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,083
...which I do not see in spring time

22
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:43,625
The breeze indulges me,
on this day..

23
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,333
where the light of my
soul loses its way

24
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,167
God please tell me, where to go and..

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,500
What to see coz there
are beauties everywhere

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:56,875
The pollen swirls
and so does my mind..

27
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:01,458
...for all that I touch is
mysteriously woven

28
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:06,167
The pollen swirls
and so does my mind

29
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:10,958
for all that I touch is
mysteriously woven

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,625
What the hell! Are you serious! Get out!

31
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,750
The letters in my mind..

32
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,042
...can defy the painted rain

33
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:24,542
The breeze sings to me of
heart break and pain

34
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,833
The hoards of people are laid
into busy trams and buses..

35
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,792
...as I carry my load alone

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,083
My ringtone sings of
a secret pet name..

37
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,000
A mere façade

38
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,583
The breeze indulges me,
on this day..

39
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:43,583
where the light of my
soul loses its way

40
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,625
The pollen swirls
and so does my mind

41
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,542
...for all that I touch is
mysteriously woven

42
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,417
Moinak Babu?

43
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,583
Who the hell is this?

44
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,000
It's me. Come in

45
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,083
Come in

46
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:20,500
Could you kindly
pull up the window?

47
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:20,792
Ya..

48
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:21,958
Ghosh Babu let's move

49
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,875
Rana da need not have
described you much

50
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,000
With your yellow, red and orange shirts...

51
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,917
He could have just said
you were bright and handsome

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,417
Thanks

53
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,542
I'm Rahul Bose

54
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:36,833
Moinak Chatterjee

55
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,542
Nice meeting you

56
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:41,417
I cannot remake a
South Indian film or..

57
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,000
A stale story of a menopausal
woman's isolation

58
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,250
I'd rather open a
roadside Paan shop

59
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,458
Rana's Paan Palace

60
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,458
A Paan for everyone

61
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,833
Or something like that

62
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:53,917
Rana Da!

63
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,167
Listen, I'm a little busy right now.

64
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,083
I'll call you at night.
Ok, bye, ta ta

65
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:58,958
Good afternoon

66
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,083
Good afternoon

67
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,917
Sorry sir, something important
came up..

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,375
...otherwise I myself would have…

69
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,167
No, it's ok

70
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,125
We've spoken on the phone

71
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,792
Rana Majumdar

72
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,125
Hi!

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,583
Nice to meet you

74
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,875
You've already met Moinak

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,083
He's been assisting me
for the last three years

76
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,958
Really?

77
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,917
He writes well

78
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,708
He also understands cinema

79
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,958
Where should we settle down?

80
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,583
Why didn't you wear shoes?

81
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,458
How should I know that
we'd be going to a club?

82
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,125
Stupid! Shouldn't you
be prepared!

83
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,500
No problem

84
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,583
Sorry about his shoes

85
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,750
Please give him your
shoes for now

86
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,292
You can take it back later

87
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:53,208
Solved

88
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,375
No, no, take two cases...

89
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:57,792
No, no...

90
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,083
Why are you limping?

91
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,792
The shoe is about two
and a half sizes too small

92
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,083
It's biting like a gator

93
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,583
Walk straight even if a dinosaur
is pinching your arse

94
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,417
Your stupidity is
becoming a real problem

95
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,125
No need to ask him

96
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,458
Just send it

97
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,417
Thank you, thank you,
thank you

98
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,042
I have a concept sir

99
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,875
In fact the script is
also nearly written

100
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,208
It's a political thriller

101
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,292
It's based in today's Kolkata

102
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,208
Explain it to Sir

103
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,750
No, no, one minute, one minute...

104
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,292
I have two requests

105
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,458
Ofcourse. Go ahead

106
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:39,292
It would be nice
if you called me Rahul

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,792
It'll happen gradually

108
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:46,083
Secondly, and don't take
it otherwise...

109
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,833
The concept of the film you are
to make shall be given by me

110
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,958
Sure, why not?

111
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,583
Basically, you can say it's
one of my conditions

112
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:59,250
There will be no
budget constraints

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,167
Even if I can't finance
the entire thing..

114
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,458
I have an NRI friend
who will cover it

115
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,458
But there is just one condition..

116
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,333
...this has to be a love story

117
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,083
Love?

118
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,917
Don't mind Rahul Babu, but..

119
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,792
I think you've come
to the wrong director

120
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,208
I'm not interested in making..

121
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,542
Stereotypical bengali films. Sorry

122
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,792
Rana Babu, a love story where..

123
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,333
...the hero and heroine
run in slow motion...

124
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,500
And hug trees is not what..

125
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,958
...I am asking you to make

126
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,333
A love story
with a difference

127
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,458
Ok. But why a love story?

128
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,542
That's my personal choice

129
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:02,042
I'm not asking you to
make an intellectual film..

130
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,542
...which is impossible to understand

131
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,625
And I don't need awards.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,583
In fact it doesn't matter
if this film makes no money

133
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,000
I have no problem

134
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,417
But this film has to prove..

135
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,458
...love still exists

136
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,875
Do you have any kind of story line?

137
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:30,458
No, no, I leave that
to your discretion

138
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:36,917
So, boy. Do you have any
knowledge of such a story?

139
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,792
Love story with a difference…

140
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,417
Also, it can't be a
remake of an older film.

141
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,875
It must be a story of today

142
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:53,625
All I want to prove
is that love still exists

143
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,417
Yes, that's exactly
what you said

144
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,917
Do you have
anything in mind?

145
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,833
Take your time.
There is no hurry

146
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,792
I've told my partner
that I won't return

147
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,333
without finalizing this project

148
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,667
Also, I have a flat in Southern Avenue.

149
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,750
We shall meet there in the future

150
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,208
Hello, great director. What news?

151
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,500
Oh, Tarun Da...

152
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,833
One minute

153
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,875
Please, have a seat

154
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,542
Let me introduce you,
this is Mr. Rahul Bose

155
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:25,417
Namaste

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,917
He is from Bombay

157
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,500
Tarun Da is a renowned
film journalist

158
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:41,042
How could you do this to me.
Its not fair

159
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,250
Must have got kicked over by love

160
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,583
Retain your water sir.

161
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:51,667
A deficiency might cause the
need for a saline drip

162
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:57,250
These kids and there phones.
I just don't get it...

163
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,708
Don't say such illogical things...

164
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,417
I was just saying that the new S4...

165
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,833
Isn't that Paromita Di?

166
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,417
Actually, I was really missing Kolkata

167
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:10,500
True

168
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,958
Paromita Di?

169
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,458
Monu

170
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:24,625
Shyampukur Street, Binoy Chatterjee's son

171
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,875
Monu!

172
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,000
How are you?

173
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,083
I am fine. You?

174
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:45,667
What brings you here?

175
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,750
I'm here as a guest

176
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,583
My God!!

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,208
Our little Monu has
really grown up

178
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,417
Even attending club parties

179
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey Salil? Do you recognize him?
It's Monu

180
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,042
Well of course you don't.

181
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,833
You had seen him but once
during our wedding

182
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,167
Moinak

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,750
Salil Sengupta

184
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:07,958
He is the son of Mr. Chatterjee,
wholived in our locality.

185
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,542
Binoy Chatterjee's son

186
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,417
You've really grown up.

187
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,167
Although you still
have that baby face

188
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,708
This is my daughter, Aheli

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Namaste

190
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,875
A spitting image of Paromita Di

191
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:29,833
Are you'll still living
in the old house?

192
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
When are you leaving?

193
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,000
In a bit

194
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,625
Come with us then.

195
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,625
We'll be going to Saltlake.
So we'll drop you to Shyambazar

196
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,500
Good proposal.

197
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,042
If I stay, Rana Da will be
after my life for that love story.

198
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,375
Impossible!

199
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,583
Ok. Give me a minute to say bye

200
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,789
How are uncle Binay
and aunt Bul Bul?

201
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:57,997
Ya

202
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,997
Does Shanti jethu still
live in his old house?

203
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,706
No, after grandpa died
uncle Parimal sold the house

204
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:08,039
It's an office now

205
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:10,956
And Parimal da?

206
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,914
Abroad, Canada

207
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:20,164
That house is intensely memorable

208
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:23,539
The perfect house to
play hide and seek in

209
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,747
Have you had too
much to drink?

210
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,039
No, no, I'm fine

211
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:46,456
Are you feeling nauseous?

212
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,206
Shekhar, just stop on the side of the road

213
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,456
Quickly, quickly

214
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,164
Go, we'll be waiting.

215
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,039
You are ok, right?

216
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:01,456
Be careful

217
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:50,372
What stranger plays the flute,
Amidst this broken Eden

218
00:13:51,539 --> 00:14:08,081
What stranger plays the flute,
Amidst this broken Eden

219
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:23,414
My heart does flutter...

220
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:30,247
In the footsteps of my soul

221
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:48,289
What stranger plays the flute,
Amidst this broken Eden

222
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,497
Ma?

223
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:05,956
Yes, tell me what you want

224
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,039
Did you locate the gentleman?

225
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:09,414
Who?

226
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:12,164
The gentleman from your locality…

227
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,414
Monu? He's an old acquaintance -

228
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:18,247
Won't you try and find out
what happened to him?

229
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,664
Right.

230
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:22,872
Where did that crazy little boy
run off to.

231
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,414
I didn't even get his mobile number -

232
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,331
He might have a landline?

233
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:29,872
Do you remember the address?

234
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,956
Ma?

235
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:35,539
Ma?

236
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:37,956
So?

237
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:47,997
Yes, three houses away from us.

238
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:51,622
2B/19 Shyampukur Street

239
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,956
His father's name is Binay Chatterjee.

240
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,247
The house is known
as the Chatterjee house

241
00:15:58,331 --> 00:15:59,206
Good.

242
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,081
Let me get my laptop..

243
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:04,622
...then we can search
the net directory

244
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:13,456
Ma, I am switching on
the main light.

245
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,331
His name?

246
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:21,247
Monu, Moinak Chatterjee

247
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:26,206
No, no, his father's name.
Binay Chatterjee, right?

248
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,747
This is not a power cut.

249
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:30,456
I think we blew a phase.

250
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,664
Let me check

251
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,706
Be careful…

252
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,914
Ok

253
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:45,372
Don't we have a matchbox
in the house?

254
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,789
Listen

255
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,497
Hey, what the hell?

256
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:44,289
You'll get this later as well

257
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:45,247
What?

258
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:52,414
How did that light?

259
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,247
Monu? Hey Monu?

260
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:11,122
It's 8 o' clock in the morning
won't you get up? Get up.

261
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:12,081
I'm trying

262
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,372
Stop trying and get the hell up!

263
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:18,497
You and your drinking. Intolerable!

264
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,122
If you continue to drink that rubbish
I won't be able to show my face in public.

265
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:25,664
You're becoming just like
the men of this family.

266
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,289
Why can't you be more
like your father?

267
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:30,539
You are completely knocked out.

268
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:33,914
Absolutely senseless.

269
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,956
Which alley did you
crawl out of last night?

270
00:18:37,497 --> 00:18:38,997
I had a meeting

271
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,956
Meeting. Is that where you
drink that rubbish?

272
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,331
You have any idea how
you reached home?

273
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,789
You didn't have any shoes
on you. Disgraceful.

274
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,872
Shit!

275
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,289
What?

276
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,122
Oh nothing. Give me
some tea.

277
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,206
I won't give you
squat until you tell me..

278
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:03,872
...when this disgraceful
behaviour will end?

279
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:05,456
Ma, it's just one day.

280
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,414
This one day scheme of yours
is really testing my patience.

281
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:09,831
Get to the market now

282
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,997
Is Father pissed off?

283
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:14,706
No he's waiting to
worship you

284
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:17,664
He's left 500 rupees for you,
it's in the drawer,

285
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,664
For God's sake buy
a pair of slippers.

286
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,372
For now please relieve me
by going to the market.

287
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:32,956
Hello?

288
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,956
Are you awake my darling?

289
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:37,247
Ya

290
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:39,872
Did you think of anything?

291
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,039
About what?

292
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,747
What do you mean?

293
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:46,247
How many pegs did
you drink last night?

294
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,872
Forgotten everything?

295
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,247
How goes the love story?

296
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,164
Not the love story again

297
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:52,289
What do you mean?

298
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:55,372
You do realize that the
man is an absolute psycho?

299
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,789
You are the psycho!

300
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,872
Rahul Babu is not a producer,
he is Aladdin's genie.

301
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:04,164
He doesn't want awards or a hit

302
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,581
...and there are no
budget constraints

303
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,872
He is a dream come true.

304
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:10,497
These are severe abnormalities

305
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:13,289
My boy, let me decide between
normal and abnormal.

306
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:14,747
You just think of the plot

307
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:17,081
We have a meeting with Rahul Babu

308
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:19,039
at his flat in Southern Avenue
in the evening.

309
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,206
We'll meet at Golpark

310
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,372
Today, but…

311
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:23,414
No buts..

312
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,831
I'm hanging up now,
nature calling, bye.

313
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,372
Is he mad or what?

314
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,122
Uncle?

315
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,622
Hello young man. What news?

316
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:38,622
Not good

317
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:39,581
Why?

318
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,081
Baba's gone somewhere and
he's not coming back.

319
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,789
Hey, shut up. Always a
smart aleck.

320
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:47,456
Actually your Shona Da has gone..

321
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,581
...to the market and
still hasn't come back

322
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,456
This child is driving me crazy

323
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,664
I'll inform him if I meet him

324
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:54,081
Please do

325
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,456
Are you mad, Ma?

326
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:58,164
Why?

327
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,206
Then why did you say
that you are going crazy

328
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:03,664
With you around the nut
house is not very far away

329
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,956
Let's get to your bath. Let's go...

330
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:08,872
Let me go, I don't want to

331
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,372
Is the Pabda good?

332
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:14,997
How much?

333
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:17,497
Give me 500 grams

334
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,414
The Pabda won't be good.

335
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:20,956
Take the Tangra, it's fresh.

336
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:22,039
I was looking for you

337
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:22,664
Why?

338
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,956
Your wife said that
you'd been out for very long.

339
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,289
Give me half a Kilo of Tangra

340
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:29,289
Shit! I didn't even notice
the missed calls.

341
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,456
Tell me about it. I met
Sukumar uncle at Bapi's shop..

342
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,122
...and he went on and on
about the library...

343
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:38,789
...and the lack of members,
maintenance..

344
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,789
Hey Shona!

345
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:43,414
Now we are in for it

346
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:45,122
I've got you

347
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,706
Doing well?

348
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,831
I saw your new play at
Rabindra Sadan the other day.

349
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:51,247
It was at the Academy...

350
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,997
No, no, it was at Rabindra Sadan.

351
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:54,664
Are you well?

352
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:55,497
Yes

353
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:01,997
It was well written but I have
a few things to say about the dialogue.

354
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,997
A few things basically means
five or six reels worth of footage.

355
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:08,789
In that part where..

356
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:12,414
...that guy said that thing
to that other guy..

357
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,831
Which part?

358
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:18,247
What's the name of your main character?

359
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:18,872
Arka

360
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:21,914
No, no, not Arka.

361
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:27,956
Wait wait, I can feel
it in my gut.

362
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:32,914
I feel like slicing your gut
into a million pieces

363
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,497
Bloody bore..

364
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:40,914
He is asleep!

365
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:59,789
This story is told from the
perspective of a young boy

366
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,664
Age?

367
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,122
Let's say 7 or 8

368
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,289
The beloved's name is Paromita,..

369
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:09,706
...and the lover's name is Anish

370
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,831
The little boy was their…

371
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:15,331
Messenger

372
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:17,872
Exactly

373
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:22,372
He used to help in the exchange of
letters and important information.

374
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:24,872
Sorry to interrupt but why
are you talking in the past tense?

375
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:25,456
Actually...

376
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:27,414
Because the story is in the present

377
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:29,206
Oh... I see, I see.
Please carry on.

378
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:34,039
The little boy is now
a young man of 28 years

379
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:41,956
Basically their love story is
this boy's childhood memory

380
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:49,331
Let me describe
the two characters

381
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:52,747
Anish is a typical hero of the locality

382
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:55,206
Handsome, smart, very talented -

383
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:59,914
Beyond this crowd lies silence

384
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:07,747
Live with me and
you will never fear,

385
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:15,747
The words I speak alone,

386
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:21,331
Will slowly change my time.

387
00:24:22,456 --> 00:24:27,164
Will slowly change my time.

388
00:24:29,664 --> 00:24:36,539
We will break the walls and
land upon a blessed isle.

389
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:40,872
Like in fairy tales
and nursery rhymes.

390
00:24:40,997 --> 00:24:42,206
Because they knew each
other from childhood..

391
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:45,664
...the two families weren't
very wary.

392
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,331
But due to certain circumstances..

393
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:50,081
...their love did not
culminate into marriage.

394
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:51,247
Why?

395
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:52,581
I'll get to that later

396
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:55,289
Paromita gets married
to someone else.

397
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:58,206
A few years later even Anish gets
married and starts a family.

398
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:04,164
After about 20 years that little
boy meets Paromita once again.

399
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:05,456
I see

400
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:09,539
He suddenly revisits his childhood

401
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,747
On seeing her..

402
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:30,081
...the boy feels that she has come
back to the city solely to meet Anish.

403
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:32,664
He somehow feels that once again..

404
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:36,956
...he is going to act as a
mediator between these two.

405
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:40,706
A mediator for unrequited love

406
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:43,539
Excuse me...!

407
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:49,872
This is the one problem
with beer. Interval.

408
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:01,914
Is the little boy
today's Monu Chatterjee?

409
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:05,331
The story has stagnated

410
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:08,247
What I said...
- Instant!

411
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:10,414
Hero, heroine?

412
00:26:10,747 --> 00:26:11,664
Living

413
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,872
Amazing!

414
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,456
Who are they?

415
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,206
One is my cousin
from my father's side

416
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:27,664
and the other was my
senior sister from the locality

417
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,872
Mind blowing

418
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,997
But if these two actually do meet…

419
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:37,747
Let them. What's the problem?

420
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:42,039
What are you saying!

421
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,039
Their families will just…

422
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:47,206
They might not?

423
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:51,872
It might be that the two of them
have a lot to say to each other.

424
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:56,831
You think they'd want to relieve
themselves of that now?

425
00:26:57,497 --> 00:27:00,956
Listen, Boss, our priority is cinema.

426
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:04,164
And cinema is portrayal of real life

427
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,122
Both of us believe that

428
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:12,122
Why can't you take this
story as your search?

429
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:19,914
That girl still hasn't
come back

430
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:21,497
I'm getting tense.

431
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,914
She went out to
jog long back.

432
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:26,289
You're tense because
she's with you.

433
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:29,039
When she's away do you have
any idea when she returns?

434
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,289
She doesn't know Saltlake well.

435
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:34,914
She left her cell
phone behind.

436
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,706
Just look around a bit
and then maybe..

437
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,997
I'm late. Don't worry.
She'll be back soon.

438
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:41,039
Of course..

439
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:44,539
You don't have any
reason to be worried

440
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,164
Ok, I'll look for her myself.

441
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,706
Don't

442
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:53,456
In such a case it's more likely that
Aheli will return and you'll get lost.

443
00:28:14,664 --> 00:28:16,164
Have we reached Shovabazar?

444
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:17,081
It's right ahead.

445
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,872
Where do you
want to get off?

446
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:23,747
No, I'm not...
Just drive around.

447
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,331
What happened?

448
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:29,747
I can't go any further

449
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:30,872
Why?

450
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:34,622
If you don't tell me exactly
where to go I won't move

451
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:38,539
Listen Dada, a relative of
mine lives around here..

452
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,581
...and I don't remember
the exact location.

453
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:42,289
If you take a spin
it should jog my memory

454
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:44,914
Madam, could you name the road?

455
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:45,747
Shyampukur Street

456
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,456
That's a long road

457
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:48,456
I can't enter any narrow lanes.

458
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:51,331
You won't have to

459
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:53,789
Just take me as far as you can

460
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:55,539
Please!

461
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,164
Rubbish!

462
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,206
Let it loose,

463
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:10,247
Let it loose you numbskull

464
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:14,956
Now watch

465
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:24,956
We cut it!

466
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:28,331
We cut it!

467
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:32,164
I think it landed
in Apu Da's house

468
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,164
Should I go?

469
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:34,372
Make it quick

470
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:37,539
Quickly, quickly, go quickly...

471
00:30:10,872 --> 00:30:13,747
Shona Da! Shona Da!

472
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,456
What is it?

473
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:22,039
I think it's fallen into
Paromita Di's house

474
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,206
I knew it

475
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,372
Monu?

476
00:30:25,747 --> 00:30:26,331
Monu?

477
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:27,206
Ya?

478
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,622
How can you sleep
through the afternoon?

479
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:30,872
Listen?

480
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,081
What's your problem?

481
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,122
A gentleman has
come to meet you

482
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:35,039
Tell him I'm not there

483
00:30:35,164 --> 00:30:37,164
Oh Lord! But how?

484
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:38,872
He's waiting outside

485
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:42,122
The man is huge

486
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,206
Have you told
him I'm in?

487
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:52,456
Do you expect
me to lie to him?

488
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,747
Why didn't you
ask me first?

489
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:56,039
Why?

490
00:30:56,372 --> 00:30:58,456
Do you owe him money?

491
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:00,414
Could you please
keep quiet!

492
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,414
Should I ask him
to come in?

493
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:04,122
Do we have an option?

494
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:08,497
Intolerable, the mood
swings you all have…

495
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:35,872
Anish is a playwright and
Paromita is a housewife

496
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:37,997
May I come in?

497
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:41,831
Yes of course

498
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:46,414
Please sit

499
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:51,039
Will your chair be able
to take my weight?

500
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:54,289
Yes, it has taken a lot
over the years…

501
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:03,122
Sorry I arrived all of a sudden.
Rana Babu gave me your address.

502
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:06,581
Any progress?

503
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:09,747
Well I've been ideating, thinking...

504
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,289
Very good, do keep at it.

505
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,706
There is something very
unique about your concept

506
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:20,497
This young boy seems to be acting
as a bridge for unsuccessful love.

507
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:25,747
And we can use this bridge to
end the love story on a positive note.

508
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:26,914
What say you?

509
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:28,081
Definitely

510
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,289
Actually I don't really understand,
it just struck me so...

511
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:33,206
No, no you're absolutely right.

512
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,872
I'm just thinking about what
events to highlight in the present.

513
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,914
Good, good.

514
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,539
Then I shall leave you to it

515
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:43,747
Won't you have some tea?

516
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,122
Maybe some other time

517
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:47,206
Of course

518
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:48,581
We'll have a long chat

519
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:49,039
Definitely, definitely.

520
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:51,331
Sorry to disturb you at work.

521
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:54,331
But I have to finalise this project
before leaving for Bombay.

522
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,622
It's alright . After all this
is our project.

523
00:32:59,164 --> 00:33:01,456
That's the spirit. That's the spirit.

524
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:02,414
See you

525
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:03,747
Yes, for sure.

526
00:33:07,372 --> 00:33:10,289
This story has contemporary value.

527
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,914
That's what I'm looking for.

528
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,664
That's what I need.

529
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,581
It'd be impossible for me to
find your house..

530
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:25,997
...without Ghosh Babu.

531
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:27,497
He knows North Kolkata very well.

532
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:28,789
Oh, really.

533
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:34,206
I'll be off then.

534
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:36,622
We'll meet sometime
in the next few days.

535
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,872
Hopefully we'd have
moved further by then…

536
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:39,872
Yes

537
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,081
See you

538
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:42,539
Let's go

539
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:51,622
See you

540
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:52,331
Take care

541
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,706
Ta ta

542
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:03,997
Producer?

543
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,789
Yes

544
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,414
Shona Da?

545
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:16,206
Paromita Di's in Kolkata

546
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:24,414
I knew it

547
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:35,081
Hello?

548
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,289
Is Moinak Chatterjee there?

549
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:38,164
Speaking

550
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:39,581
Please hold

551
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,372
Hello Monu?

552
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,789
It's Paromita Di

553
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:49,081
Ya say. How did you
get our number?

554
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:52,622
First I have to apologise
about the other night

555
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:55,539
I didn't want to disturb
you all any further

556
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:56,789
So I caught a bus home

557
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:01,206
Aheli had got your number
from the directory that night itself

558
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:02,622
But she couldn't get through.

559
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:04,831
She tried last night as well

560
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:07,122
I think your mom had picked up

561
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,539
I avoided talking to
her on purpose

562
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:14,581
Have you decided to
permanently settle in Kolkata?

563
00:35:15,164 --> 00:35:16,039
Yes

564
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:19,622
We didn't feel like
living in Delhi anymore

565
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,622
Paromita Di?

566
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:32,331
One minute please

567
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:43,081
How is he?

568
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:45,872
He's fine

569
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:55,497
Could you give
me his number?

570
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:08,414
Hey!

571
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:10,414
Hold these...

572
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,122
Monu!

573
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:23,039
What happened?

574
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,164
These crackers have been
bought with your father's money.

575
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:29,539
Wouldn't you like
to hear them?

576
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,914
Let's go

577
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:36,706
H-A-I-R, H-A-I-R

578
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:38,539
Hair

579
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,622
Erase it, erase it, erase it.

580
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:47,997
H-A-I-R means the hair on your head

581
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:53,206
H-A-R-E refers to a rabbit

582
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:55,289
Rabbit
- Rabbit, rabbit

583
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:57,664
What is another word for "hare"?

584
00:36:58,914 --> 00:36:59,831
Rabbit

585
00:37:00,664 --> 00:37:02,539
Ok, then write "rabbit".

586
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:09,622
R-A-B-B-I-T

587
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:12,081
Write it properly

588
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:15,872
I've written it

589
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,997
Now we shall write...

590
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:20,289
Shona?

591
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:22,372
What's happened?

592
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,164
Nothing

593
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:27,414
Why are you sitting here
with your head in your hands?

594
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:31,206
I've got a headache
due to extensive writing

595
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,372
Don't write anymore

596
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:37,581
Take rest

597
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:39,872
Do you want some tea?

598
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,706
No

599
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,206
Can't you even
take dictation?

600
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:51,914
Listen

601
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:55,289
Have you any news?

602
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:04,622
Write it properly

603
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:05,747
Bouma...

604
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:06,539
Yes

605
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:08,497
Should I send
Biltu's food upstairs?

606
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:10,372
It's alright Ma,
I'll handle it.

607
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,289
Ok.

608
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,581
Have you made Payasam
for me Grandma?

609
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:15,039
Yes I have

610
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:16,872
Write it again

611
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:19,622
Write it again

612
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,372
Same mistake. Erase it...

613
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:43,247
I can guess why Ma decided to
move out of Delhi and into Kolkata.

614
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:48,081
It is what I had
suspected as a child...

615
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:51,706
Which has now
become a pain for me..

616
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,539
...and now that I have
an opportunity,..

617
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:56,039
...I want to get rid off it.

618
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:58,081
I'm done with taking chances...

619
00:38:58,289 --> 00:38:59,997
Sweetheart!

620
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,414
Yes?

621
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:02,331
Busy?

622
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:05,164
No, I was just checking
the routine.

623
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:06,497
Come in

624
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:13,122
How is university life
treating you?

625
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:14,956
Good

626
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:19,206
The entire environment
has a certain flavour

627
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:24,997
It's like a trance

628
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:32,539
Friends?

629
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,414
I've made some.

630
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,456
But normally I return
home straight after class.

631
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:40,039
I play chess with Grandpa.

632
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:41,456
You don't know the game..

633
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:43,331
...else I could have
played with you.

634
00:39:43,622 --> 00:39:45,206
I'm not that calculative..

635
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:47,164
...and I also lack
the foresight

636
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:49,372
But I have

637
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:52,164
So Daddy...

638
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,289
Why doesn't Ma
visit Shyampukur Street?

639
00:39:57,997 --> 00:40:00,914
But I need to know

640
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:05,039
What do you
need to know?

641
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:09,872
Daddy, don't you think that Ma
is just stuck to her past?

642
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:12,331
I think..

643
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,206
Dinner ready

644
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:34,039
Anish Babu?

645
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,122
Shona?

646
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:47,372
Uncle! Please come in

647
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:50,081
Please sit

648
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:56,497
Tea?

649
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,081
Water?

650
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:03,164
This is very sudden.

651
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:04,372
Is there any problem?

652
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:09,122
I have actually come
to tell you something

653
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:13,039
I thought I'd tell you
in the locality itself, but…

654
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,414
Please go ahead

655
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,622
I heard that...

656
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:20,831
Paromita's in Kolkata

657
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,872
So...

658
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,997
So in case you meet her...

659
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:29,497
Tell her...

660
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:34,747
That her mother and I
haven't gone blind yet...

661
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:38,456
And would very much like
to see our granddaughter

662
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:43,497
Atleast once for old times' sake

663
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:49,456
We won't be around
for much longer…

664
00:41:54,331 --> 00:42:02,206
I know this is
unfair on you...

665
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:08,831
But we have no
other option

666
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:15,789
Has she contacted you?

667
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,872
No

668
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:27,289
Then I should leave

669
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,456
Sorry for disturbing you at work

670
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:32,831
No, no, it's fine.

671
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,997
See you later then

672
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:43,289
I cannot wait any longer

673
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:45,664
Why are you acting crazy?

674
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:47,914
Can't you understand
my problem?

675
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:50,206
I don't want to
understand a thing

676
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:53,081
You have to take a decision

677
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:57,164
But at this point I have
no money and no job.

678
00:42:57,581 --> 00:43:00,914
I can't run a family
on tuition money

679
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,247
Are you avoiding me?

680
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,581
Paromita, please…

681
00:43:13,997 --> 00:43:16,247
We will get married,
we'll live together

682
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:19,872
But you're aware of
the situation at home

683
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:26,831
After Baba fled no one
talks to us properly

684
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:29,872
They've even changed
the entrance

685
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:32,164
You are aware of this

686
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:35,789
Once Monica Mashi
came into the picture..

687
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,247
Please Paromita

688
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:42,247
Please explain things
at home and..

689
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:43,622
...buy me a little time..

690
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:46,914
Proposals have already
started coming in

691
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:53,497
And do you think that my
parents will alienate you..

692
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:56,164
...any less than your own family?

693
00:43:56,206 --> 00:44:00,206
Baba has made it clear that
I cannot get married to you.

694
00:44:00,747 --> 00:44:03,872
Thus we have to do
whatever must be done

695
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:13,831
Believe me, I can't
understand what to do.

696
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:19,831
This entire hero image
of yours is just a facade

697
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:23,825
you are actually
a total coward

698
00:44:25,617 --> 00:44:27,347
You have to take a decision..

699
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,709
...and it better be
a positive one

700
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,501
I won't let go of you
Shona Chatterjee

701
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,833
Never ever

702
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:38,736
Paromita!

703
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,570
Paromita! Please listen!
Paromita!

704
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:27,278
Shona?

705
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:29,778
Baba

706
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:35,638
I really wanted to
stage “Durgesh Nandini”.

707
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:40,195
I had got hold of the original
manuscript from librarian Subodh Babu

708
00:45:40,653 --> 00:45:48,028
It was first staged in 1873
at the Bengal Theatre

709
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:52,403
I thought of staging
it in that exact form

710
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:56,570
Back to the origins of theatre

711
00:45:57,861 --> 00:46:00,153
But, alas!

712
00:46:01,278 --> 00:46:03,111
Monica had of course said…

713
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:06,570
Were you in love
with Monica Mashi?

714
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:10,070
Were you very unhappy
in our family?

715
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,070
I wasn't capable of
being in any family

716
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:16,820
Family, society..

717
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:22,361
People's narrow mindedness
and growing stupidity,..

718
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:25,611
...was something I
could never deal with

719
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,195
Theatre was my
reason for living

720
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,111
Our theatre ended
and so I fled

721
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,986
But why with
Monica Mashi?

722
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:46,903
She also wanted to escape

723
00:46:47,653 --> 00:46:51,736
We were both runaways…
United thus.

724
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:53,611
Not lovers

725
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:58,153
If we were in love we
would not have fled

726
00:46:58,486 --> 00:46:59,778
Ok

727
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:03,195
That means true love
does not warrant…

728
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,195
Have you told your mother?

729
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,278
No I couldn't

730
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:13,653
Although I tried a lot...

731
00:47:14,236 --> 00:47:16,403
I couldn't...

732
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,153
Listen Baba...

733
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:40,945
Catch a bunny,
With some money..

734
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:44,778
All our art is just a farce,
burn it whole..

735
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,320
Catch a bunny,
With some money..

736
00:47:48,361 --> 00:47:50,903
When you go to make a film..

737
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:53,611
Butter a man who is fat,
not thin..

738
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,861
Catch a bunny,
With some money..

739
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:59,278
Are you laughing?

740
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:01,570
I'm speaking the truth!

741
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:03,903
If Gurudev was alive today,
this is what he would have written.

742
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:06,820
This is called a social parody

743
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:11,070
Catch a bunny,
with some money..

744
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:14,653
Pour me a peg

745
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:16,445
Don't overdo it.

746
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,611
Your wife will get mad.

747
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:20,903
But that's the fun of it

748
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:24,903
I'll drink and the wife
will go mad

749
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:30,278
I've become a real
bore after marriage

750
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:31,778
Here you go

751
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:40,486
For creative people, getting
married is a real blunder

752
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:43,320
Never get married. Never.

753
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:49,945
Make love, like crazy.
You'll stay fresh.

754
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:52,236
But marriage? No.

755
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:53,486
Never

756
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:58,445
Your delicious love
making will rot

757
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,986
What about the constant support
your wife has given you?

758
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:04,653
Forgot about that?

759
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:10,903
That's true

760
00:49:11,403 --> 00:49:15,236
I'd be lost without Shumi

761
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,445
Nowhere

762
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:20,903
Let's bunk this

763
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:23,153
Let's search for the truth.

764
00:49:23,195 --> 00:49:25,778
Truth is always
stranger than fiction.

765
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:27,861
Catching the Bunny is my job.

766
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:29,736
I'd never subject you to it.

767
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,195
If I did, you'd become just
as big a bore as me.

768
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:37,361
Catch a Bunny,
With some money..

769
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,570
When you go to make a film,

770
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:43,320
Your Bunny with
some beer do fill.

771
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,820
Light the fire, light the fire…

772
00:49:57,111 --> 00:50:00,195
Light the fire, light the fire…

773
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,236
Hello?

774
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:08,736
Can I speak to
Moinak Chatterjee?

775
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:09,861
Speaking

776
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:11,945
Aheli

777
00:50:17,486 --> 00:50:18,903
Ya, say.

778
00:50:18,945 --> 00:50:20,445
Do you recognize me?

779
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:23,028
Yes, yes, it's good
that you called..

780
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,611
...or else I would have got
in touch with you myself.

781
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:25,778
Why?

782
00:50:25,861 --> 00:50:27,736
Actually I hadn't mentioned
it that day..

783
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:29,570
In fact even Paromita Di
doesn't know,

784
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:31,903
I'm working in the film industry

785
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,153
Have you heard of
Rana Majumdar, the director?

786
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:35,570
No

787
00:50:38,486 --> 00:50:41,028
Ok. Actually, I assist him.

788
00:50:41,611 --> 00:50:43,695
I see-film making!

789
00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:46,653
Yes, and recently we've been
developing a plot..

790
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:47,861
...mainly a love story.

791
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,778
I was actually thinking..

792
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:51,028
...about casting you as the
heroine in her young age

793
00:50:55,236 --> 00:50:56,570
Hello?

794
00:50:57,736 --> 00:50:59,903
Thank you, but I'm
not interested

795
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:01,820
Why?

796
00:51:01,986 --> 00:51:03,945
No reason as such

797
00:51:03,986 --> 00:51:05,320
I'm basically not interested.

798
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,820
It's a very important role

799
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:09,820
It might be

800
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,070
But I won't do it

801
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:16,111
An educated, beautiful
girl of today..

802
00:51:16,195 --> 00:51:17,861
...rejecting a film offer...!

803
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:18,695
Who are you?

804
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:20,986
Do you not believe me?

805
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:23,986
Paromita Di has known
me since I was a child

806
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:27,111
I know. That's why
I need you

807
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,361
Me? Why?

808
00:51:30,778 --> 00:51:32,403
I'll tell you when we meet

809
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,278
I need to know a lot
of things from you

810
00:51:35,695 --> 00:51:36,445
What things?

811
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:38,778
As I said, I'll tell you
when we meet

812
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:40,445
When shall we meet?

813
00:51:41,736 --> 00:51:43,945
Give me your mobile number...

814
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,653
I'll contact you

815
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:50,695
Tapas babu, Anish's father's
elopement with actress Monica Devi..

816
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,820
...was unacceptable in the family

817
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:57,236
In fact members of Anish's joint
family had alienated them

818
00:51:58,195 --> 00:51:59,778
And it was due to this scandal that..

819
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,611
Anish and Paromita's marriage
became an impossibility

820
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,570
Paromita's parents fixed
her wedding elsewhere

821
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,861
The date was fixed
and soon it arrived

822
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:14,653
The little boy remembers
that day clearly

823
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:19,361
For some reason he had
climbed up to Anish's terrace

824
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:24,986
Why would you even
think of doing this?

825
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:30,278
What were you doing!!

826
00:52:50,695 --> 00:52:54,153
Why would you even
think of doing this?

827
00:53:45,403 --> 00:53:47,445
What happened?

828
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,986
Where is your Shona Da?

829
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:57,903
He is at the hangout spot
near the Natmandir

830
00:54:11,236 --> 00:54:13,236
Even that little child knew that..

831
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,653
...the truth at that point
would be devastating

832
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:22,153
Paromita would have left
everything and run to Anish

833
00:54:23,153 --> 00:54:25,653
Although he had gone to
tell the truth, somehow…

834
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:26,986
Excuse me

835
00:54:27,611 --> 00:54:30,028
An interval

836
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,981
Pure cinema!!

837
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:49,028
Salil, right?

838
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,625
Vipin?

839
00:54:50,945 --> 00:54:52,362
What brings you here?

840
00:54:53,195 --> 00:54:57,820
I have been transferred from
Delhi a couple of months ago

841
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,278
How is it going with you?

842
00:54:59,403 --> 00:55:00,528
Not badly

843
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:03,237
I own a multigym
named 'Physique'

844
00:55:03,945 --> 00:55:05,778
Is your office here?

845
00:55:05,987 --> 00:55:07,112
5th floor

846
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:09,945
Give me your number.
I'll contact you immediately

847
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:12,070
One minute

848
00:55:13,862 --> 00:55:15,278
I'll give you my card

849
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:16,737
Here

850
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,820
Let's go

851
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:54,612
Upen Da had called from Delhi

852
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:57,195
He's found a prospective
buyer for the house

853
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,737
That's good

854
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:00,570
I'll call Upen.

855
00:56:00,612 --> 00:56:02,903
He can verbally finalise the deal

856
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:04,862
...and then we can settle

857
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:05,695
Ok

858
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:08,153
But are you sure?

859
00:56:08,903 --> 00:56:10,278
What do you mean?

860
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,445
I mean you might feel
like moving back to Delhi..

861
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:15,737
...once we've sold the house

862
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:17,987
You are very whimsical

863
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:19,737
If I wanted to stay there..

864
00:56:19,737 --> 00:56:21,737
...why would I have told you
to transfer to Kolkata?

865
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,237
I'm not saying so...

866
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:28,653
I want to spend the
rest of my life here

867
00:56:37,153 --> 00:56:39,153
Let go, I'm falling

868
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:42,028
Oh God! I'm the happiest
person under the sun

869
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:46,737
I love you, love you...
- Let go of me!

870
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:57,028
What happened?

871
00:56:57,903 --> 00:56:59,820
Nothing

872
00:57:00,653 --> 00:57:02,987
There must be something...

873
00:57:05,362 --> 00:57:10,278
What happened?
You're not happy?

874
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:16,528
It's such great news

875
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:19,153
Hey sweetheart...

876
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:20,737
Let go!

877
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:24,195
What happened?

878
00:57:24,237 --> 00:57:26,653
Even if I am happy about
this you shouldn't be

879
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:28,070
This is not your child

880
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,612
Hello Vipin?

881
00:57:48,403 --> 00:57:51,570
Have you located
the scoundrel?

882
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,820
Very good

883
00:57:55,153 --> 00:57:56,778
I'm reaching
Kolkata tomorrow

884
00:57:58,653 --> 00:57:59,487
Who are you'll?

885
00:57:59,528 --> 00:58:01,612
Why have you come here?

886
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:07,195
If you have the guts take
me on one at a time...

887
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:18,778
Who the...

888
00:58:24,278 --> 00:58:25,570
Move!

889
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,445
Bloody shit...

890
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:30,612
If you come anywhere
near Paromita, I'll kill you!

891
00:58:30,695 --> 00:58:34,653
Bastard! Swine!...

892
00:58:58,612 --> 00:59:01,820
Next scene opens with a
lamp being lit, frontal left of stage

893
00:59:02,028 --> 00:59:04,237
We see Shekhar
seated on the chair

894
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:06,862
Shekhar slowly begins to
address the audience

895
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:08,570
What are you thinking?

896
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,278
I know what you're thinking

897
00:59:11,403 --> 00:59:12,653
You think that a
man like Shekhar Roy..

898
00:59:12,695 --> 00:59:16,153
Wants freedom,
he wants to flee!

899
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,778
Just at the interesting bit

900
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:22,153
This is so irritating

901
00:59:22,403 --> 00:59:25,903
Wait, I'll get it

902
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:30,445
Hello?

903
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:32,445
Hello?

904
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:34,653
Hello?

905
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:38,195
What the… It must be that one

906
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:39,195
That one?

907
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:42,028
This is the 5th time
since the afternoon!

908
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,195
Every time I pick up,
they disconnect

909
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,987
Who?

910
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,987
Wouldn't be a
problem if I knew

911
00:59:47,278 --> 00:59:49,695
Maybe some female fan of yours.

912
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,778
Your play is a hit..

913
00:59:50,862 --> 00:59:52,070
Your first novel is selling well..

914
00:59:52,195 --> 00:59:53,112
You're a star

915
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:54,612
Stop talking rubbish

916
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:57,820
Could you get me some tea?
I've got a headache

917
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,903
Ok

918
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:24,820
Hello?

919
01:00:30,028 --> 01:00:31,362
It's me

920
01:00:36,445 --> 01:00:37,570
How are you?

921
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,237
Good

922
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:44,737
Your wife seems to
be quite a watchguard

923
01:00:45,195 --> 01:00:49,112
Doesn't even let you
answer the phone

924
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,320
Why have you called?

925
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:54,737
Wow!

926
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:58,028
It's not as if you
didn't know I'd call!

927
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,612
Where did you get
my number from? Monu?

928
01:01:04,403 --> 01:01:05,570
I had asked for
your mobile number

929
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,487
He said he'd
give it but didn't

930
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,945
Tell me now,
I'll note it down

931
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:14,362
Baba, Ma hit me and
now my ear hurts

932
01:01:14,612 --> 01:01:15,737
One minute

933
01:01:16,112 --> 01:01:17,695
Were you being naughty?

934
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:21,195
No, I only pulled
Tommy's tail

935
01:01:21,403 --> 01:01:22,112
Isn't that naughty?

936
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:22,778
No

937
01:01:22,862 --> 01:01:23,528
No?

938
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:25,320
What if Tommy bit you?

939
01:01:25,403 --> 01:01:26,570
You'd have to take an injection

940
01:01:26,778 --> 01:01:27,737
Injection?

941
01:01:27,778 --> 01:01:29,487
An injection which is that big!

942
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:30,653
Now go to your Grandma

943
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:32,112
No...

944
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,362
Wait

945
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:34,153
Hello?

946
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,403
I'm assuming this is Saptarshi

947
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:41,653
Yes

948
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,112
How did you know his name?

949
01:01:44,195 --> 01:01:45,195
Did Monu tell you that as well?

950
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:47,362
Well...

951
01:01:48,445 --> 01:01:50,570
You dedicated your first novel to..

952
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:53,778
...Sutapa and Saptarshi didn't you?

953
01:01:54,862 --> 01:01:57,903
Biltu! Biltu!

954
01:02:13,903 --> 01:02:15,987
This is a very expensive Kurta

955
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,403
Well, people don't get
married everyday

956
01:02:18,737 --> 01:02:19,862
Ya but a 250 rupee!!!

957
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,987
Have you gone mad?

958
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:24,028
Do you still doubt it?

959
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:26,570
Just shut up and listen to me

960
01:02:26,653 --> 01:02:27,945
Tomorrow at precisely 11 thirty..

961
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:29,362
...I'll be there with
Dibyendu Da and Ranu

962
01:02:29,403 --> 01:02:30,237
Bye

963
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,028
No..
What happened?

964
01:02:32,153 --> 01:02:33,653
First tell me...

965
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:34,862
What will you wear?

966
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:36,153
Why should I tell you?

967
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:37,237
I better be off.

968
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,487
If Ma returns from Deepa
Pishi's house and sees…

969
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:41,653
Stay a little longer

970
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:43,112
Impossible

971
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:44,737
5 minutes

972
01:02:45,237 --> 01:02:46,320
Listen, mister,

973
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:49,278
from tomorrow you will have me
for the rest of your life

974
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,778
Once that happens you'll
want to get rid of me

975
01:02:51,945 --> 01:02:52,820
Wait

976
01:02:54,153 --> 01:02:55,320
One for the road?

977
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:56,362
No

978
01:02:56,945 --> 01:02:59,403
If you say so…

979
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:08,612
What happened?

980
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:10,903
What was that?

981
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:12,987
Even this will happen later

982
01:03:16,862 --> 01:03:17,903
Excuse me

983
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,278
You are becoming
a chain smoker

984
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,570
What else can I do?

985
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:24,528
Let's go

986
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,320
But Paromita...

987
01:03:26,778 --> 01:03:27,695
He's not coming

988
01:03:27,778 --> 01:03:30,320
I'm sorry Paromita,
I didn't mean it that way

989
01:03:30,403 --> 01:03:32,362
That's no problem at all

990
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:34,570
I knew Shona wouldn't come

991
01:03:35,362 --> 01:03:37,278
Let's go

992
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:39,528
Sorry, sorry

993
01:03:39,612 --> 01:03:40,737
Why so late?

994
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:42,070
Massive traffic jam

995
01:03:42,112 --> 01:03:42,570
Good evening

996
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:43,528
Ya, good evening

997
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,362
Rahul Babu has gone crazy

998
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:47,653
I was just randomly saying that..

999
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,403
Since the story has
got stuck mid way..

1000
01:03:49,528 --> 01:03:50,945
It might be a good idea
to freshen our minds..

1001
01:03:50,987 --> 01:03:53,487
With a change of environment

1002
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,237
in order to complete the story

1003
01:03:55,278 --> 01:04:00,237
And he just gave me a
cheque for the both of us

1004
01:04:00,278 --> 01:04:02,237
It can be done here...

1005
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:04,278
No, no, Rana Babu's
suggestion is valid

1006
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:06,237
You two need a small outing

1007
01:04:06,237 --> 01:04:08,112
It'll improve your work

1008
01:04:08,487 --> 01:04:11,570
Do you have any
ideas on where to go?

1009
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:12,778
Shantiniketan?

1010
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:13,903
Fantastic

1011
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:15,528
Very good, very good.

1012
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:18,862
That would be the best
place for creative thinking!

1013
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:22,528
You can't doubt its heritage

1014
01:04:48,987 --> 01:04:50,237
We'll pick up 4 beers, got it?

1015
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,362
Alcohol is all you think about

1016
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:54,403
Don't talk like an uneducated...

1017
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,070
Beer does not
count as alcohol

1018
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:58,112
4 beers certainly do.

1019
01:04:58,112 --> 01:04:59,112
Atleast in your case

1020
01:04:59,278 --> 01:05:00,737
Will you go?

1021
01:05:00,862 --> 01:05:01,403
Rana Babu!

1022
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:02,487
Who?

1023
01:05:09,278 --> 01:05:10,445
What is he doing here?

1024
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,070
I'm sure he's come to check
how we are spending his money

1025
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,237
He's a sly bugger

1026
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,653
If he waits like an overlord

1027
01:05:16,653 --> 01:05:18,028
I won't be able to write a thing

1028
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,903
Softly, softly…

1029
01:05:21,695 --> 01:05:23,945
What a pleasant surprise!!

1030
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:25,028
You're happy to see me?

1031
01:05:25,153 --> 01:05:26,528
Did you think
we'd be irritated?

1032
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,570
It's not that …

1033
01:05:27,612 --> 01:05:31,153
We think you are an
incredibly sensible person

1034
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:35,445
Thus there is no harm in you
joining our creative venture

1035
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:39,028
I'd say this even if you
weren't our producer

1036
01:05:39,987 --> 01:05:40,528
What say you?

1037
01:05:40,695 --> 01:05:41,612
Ya, exactly!

1038
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:43,987
Thank you, thank you.
Ok, let's go..

1039
01:05:44,028 --> 01:05:45,570
Ok, Let's go

1040
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,278
I was feeling very restless
since our last meeting

1041
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,403
So I thought I'd come
with you'll and..

1042
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:53,778
Then I decided that
it should be a surprise

1043
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,737
Very nice

1044
01:05:54,737 --> 01:05:57,112
So I drove down and
reached the station

1045
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,070
Well done

1046
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:04,070
I remembered you were
getting off at Prantik station

1047
01:06:04,237 --> 01:06:05,237
Exactly

1048
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:09,278
I've booked two rooms
at a nearby resort

1049
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:09,903
Brilliant!

1050
01:06:09,987 --> 01:06:12,737
I hope you don't mind sharing a
room with me Rana Babu

1051
01:06:12,862 --> 01:06:16,278
No, no. What are
you saying sir?

1052
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,278
Hey Ranada!

1053
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,862
Won't we get some
lunch? It's 3 O' clock

1054
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,570
I'm too hungry to sleep

1055
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:43,237
What?

1056
01:06:47,653 --> 01:06:49,028
Beautiful

1057
01:06:49,737 --> 01:06:50,778
What?

1058
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:53,653
Strange

1059
01:06:54,028 --> 01:06:55,070
What's strange?

1060
01:06:55,195 --> 01:06:57,195
Amazing

1061
01:06:58,487 --> 01:06:59,820
How many bottles down?

1062
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,487
Half glass

1063
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:03,695
Don't be absurd

1064
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,778
Half a glass couldn't have…

1065
01:07:06,903 --> 01:07:10,737
Do you know why
we'll make the film?

1066
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,445
Why?

1067
01:07:15,695 --> 01:07:18,028
Because Sister-in-law will love it

1068
01:07:18,362 --> 01:07:19,153
What?

1069
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,278
Whose sister-in-law?

1070
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:23,528
Yours

1071
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:25,570
Mine

1072
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,070
Everyone's

1073
01:07:27,528 --> 01:07:29,695
I'm not getting you Rana Da -

1074
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:34,987
Rahul Babu is making this film..

1075
01:07:35,237 --> 01:07:37,362
...just so that he can
show it to his wife

1076
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:38,195
What!!

1077
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:40,362
For his wife!

1078
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:42,487
To show it to his wife

1079
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:45,487
You need to explain it to him

1080
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:50,653
You... you're awake?

1081
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:53,237
I was just slightly drowsy

1082
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,445
Have you heard
of Anasuya Basu Roy?

1083
01:07:57,695 --> 01:08:00,487
Anasuya Basu Roy,
the classical dancer?

1084
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,862
Exactly, Bharat Natyam

1085
01:08:04,987 --> 01:08:08,070
This lady is my wife

1086
01:08:09,237 --> 01:08:12,028
And it was a love marriage

1087
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:15,487
Now, the problem is that..

1088
01:08:16,612 --> 01:08:21,112
She is so busy that she can't
seem to give me any time at all

1089
01:08:22,028 --> 01:08:24,737
Due to the frequency
of her shows,..

1090
01:08:25,778 --> 01:08:31,237
...under the stress of constant travel,
teaching and plane journeys...

1091
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:38,820
Overcome by stress she has
forgotten what love is

1092
01:08:38,987 --> 01:08:39,862
But...

1093
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,987
It wasn't like this before

1094
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:47,237
As newly weds we'd
go on long drives,..

1095
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:50,653
...stay in ordinary hotels..

1096
01:08:51,362 --> 01:08:55,070
But what does this have
to do with our film?

1097
01:08:56,070 --> 01:09:03,903
Poetry, play, cinema and
novels are beyond me

1098
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:09,570
In fact I can't seem to
express myself smartly..

1099
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,528
...in front of my wife anymore

1100
01:09:14,528 --> 01:09:17,445
That's why with the
extra money I have..

1101
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:21,070
I thought of producing
a real love story...

1102
01:09:22,445 --> 01:09:25,195
Once the film is released,

1103
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,278
I'll book an entire hall..

1104
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:32,445
So that Anasuya and I
can watch it undisturbed

1105
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:36,903
The film needs
to be able to..

1106
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:40,278
...reignite the spark
of love in her heart

1107
01:09:40,945 --> 01:09:43,778
I'm not pressurising you,

1108
01:09:44,487 --> 01:09:45,945
Take your own time

1109
01:09:46,403 --> 01:09:49,195
Let me get us
some food

1110
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,695
All that money spent on a film..

1111
01:10:01,153 --> 01:10:07,362
...just to prove his
love for his wife!

1112
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:10,362
Mind blowing boss!

1113
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:15,403
What romance resides in
that mountain of a man

1114
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:20,237
Don't you get the feeling that,
the whole thing is a practical joke?

1115
01:10:20,778 --> 01:10:25,570
I feel like a victim
of the “Tughlak” complex

1116
01:10:28,112 --> 01:10:29,987
In the words of Coleridge..

1117
01:10:30,153 --> 01:10:32,320
...it is a “willing
suspension of disbelief”

1118
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:36,112
To make it clearer
Jibananda Das tells us about..

1119
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:38,403
...a “temporary suspension of disbelief”

1120
01:10:38,528 --> 01:10:39,362
What he means is...

1121
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:45,153
When the world was created the
creator was tensionless and calm

1122
01:10:45,362 --> 01:10:49,028
He was of this world
but beyond it.

1123
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:56,237
There is no Rahul Bose,
sister-in-law or Rana Da

1124
01:10:56,362 --> 01:10:58,403
In fact he does not
exist himself

1125
01:10:59,612 --> 01:11:01,820
He finds happiness in creation

1126
01:11:02,362 --> 01:11:03,903
Nice concept, huh?

1127
01:11:04,362 --> 01:11:05,945
There are lot of FM stations around..

1128
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,737
Why don't you apply as an RJ?

1129
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:13,153
It is this sense of
humour that I love

1130
01:11:13,237 --> 01:11:16,195
This piece of rubbish was brought
to you by Boudis' Tea Stall

1131
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:19,362
Trust me Monu, trust me.
- Unbelievable!!

1132
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:20,362
What?

1133
01:11:20,403 --> 01:11:20,945
Stop! Stop!

1134
01:11:20,987 --> 01:11:22,237
What?
- Wait

1135
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,987
What brings you here?

1136
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,237
Holiday?

1137
01:11:26,278 --> 01:11:27,903
You could say that.
You?

1138
01:11:27,945 --> 01:11:29,987
I'm studying Fine Arts in
Vishwa Bharati University

1139
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:30,737
Really?

1140
01:11:30,862 --> 01:11:33,903
Yes. I never expected
us to meet like this

1141
01:11:33,987 --> 01:11:36,028
Exactly. So do you
live in a hostel?

1142
01:11:36,195 --> 01:11:36,862
No, no..

1143
01:11:36,945 --> 01:11:40,028
My father's uncle, as in my grandfather
was a professor at the college

1144
01:11:40,237 --> 01:11:42,195
I stay with him and Grandma

1145
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,820
Why don't you come
over in the evening

1146
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:45,112
We'll chill

1147
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:51,237
Once you arrive at Goyal Para
just ask for Samarendra Sengupta

1148
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:53,320
One minute.
Rana Da

1149
01:11:53,445 --> 01:11:55,445
Please come

1150
01:11:58,778 --> 01:12:00,820
This is director Rana Majumdar

1151
01:12:01,028 --> 01:12:02,070
I was telling you about him…

1152
01:12:02,195 --> 01:12:03,112
Aheli

1153
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:05,820
Paromita Di's daughter

1154
01:12:06,528 --> 01:12:08,862
Ok, ok, ok

1155
01:12:08,987 --> 01:12:10,778
It's good that I bumped
into you here.

1156
01:12:10,945 --> 01:12:12,653
I thought I'd call you

1157
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,153
See you in the evening …

1158
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:14,862
Sure.

1159
01:12:15,195 --> 01:12:15,737
See you later…

1160
01:12:15,778 --> 01:12:16,320
Ya

1161
01:12:16,403 --> 01:12:17,320
Bye

1162
01:12:17,487 --> 01:12:18,403
Ya, Bye

1163
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:19,403
Please go

1164
01:12:30,528 --> 01:12:34,528
Man disposes, God proposes

1165
01:12:34,945 --> 01:12:36,487
sometimes

1166
01:12:43,237 --> 01:12:45,612
Can you play chess?

1167
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,903
Just about. I can move pieces

1168
01:12:47,987 --> 01:12:49,445
Not really an expert

1169
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:55,903
If you know the moves
the rest is just logic.

1170
01:12:56,445 --> 01:12:58,112
No way!

1171
01:12:58,362 --> 01:13:01,445
You can't encroach on everyone
who comes to the house

1172
01:13:01,903 --> 01:13:03,945
How am I encroaching?

1173
01:13:04,028 --> 01:13:05,695
Are you feeling forced?

1174
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:06,320
No, why will I feel forced?

1175
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:08,028
Don't you ever say that

1176
01:13:08,195 --> 01:13:09,820
Before you know..

1177
01:13:09,862 --> 01:13:11,987
...it he'll have you
sitting here all day

1178
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:14,070
Not the entire day

1179
01:13:14,278 --> 01:13:16,153
Just one game

1180
01:13:16,195 --> 01:13:18,987
I said no, didn't I?

1181
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,987
Where's your blanket?

1182
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:25,237
There is dew around
in the evenings

1183
01:13:25,653 --> 01:13:28,028
You were coughing
heavily yesterday

1184
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:31,737
Why don't you listen…

1185
01:13:33,028 --> 01:13:35,487
I have been disciplining
students for 30 years...

1186
01:13:35,695 --> 01:13:40,903
But at home I can't
seem to discipline myself

1187
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:48,320
Here..

1188
01:13:48,528 --> 01:13:50,403
I can't eat this
many sweets

1189
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:53,903
Go ahead. If you don't at
this age, you never will

1190
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:58,028
Thank God you didn't say
you chewed metal at my age

1191
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,070
It would be advisable for
you to shut up and eat

1192
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,153
Your hospitality seems Hitleresque

1193
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:05,945
She's like that

1194
01:14:06,528 --> 01:14:09,653
But she never practices
what she preaches

1195
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,570
She'll eat two measly
roti's before college and..

1196
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:19,903
...then nothing till dinner
because rice will make her fat

1197
01:14:19,987 --> 01:14:21,487
Come on Grandma,
please don't start

1198
01:14:21,612 --> 01:14:23,820
How will she survive?

1199
01:14:24,028 --> 01:14:26,278
Eat fast, then we'll leave

1200
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:32,403
Help yourself

1201
01:14:39,903 --> 01:14:42,112
What are you staring at?

1202
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:44,653
No, I mean...

1203
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:48,820
Manik Bandhopadhyay had
written this novel called “Ahimsa”

1204
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:52,612
Rana Da and I had planned
to adapt it for cinema

1205
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:56,737
I suddenly noticed that you and the female
protagonist shared certain qualities

1206
01:14:57,112 --> 01:14:58,278
Like?

1207
01:14:58,778 --> 01:15:04,070
She is pretty, intelligent, intense

1208
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,778
and at the same time, mysterious

1209
01:15:07,862 --> 01:15:10,195
So you find me mysterious?

1210
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:11,237
Exactly!

1211
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,528
In fact the day I first met you...

1212
01:15:13,653 --> 01:15:15,278
The day you were sitting
by the car window,..

1213
01:15:15,278 --> 01:15:17,362
...with the streetlights
illuminating your features...

1214
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:19,903
I had thought the
very same. I swear

1215
01:15:21,028 --> 01:15:24,528
Are you high again?

1216
01:15:24,945 --> 01:15:27,153
I'm not joking Aheli,
believe me..

1217
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,778
Good try, but I'm
not impressed

1218
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:42,320
A fleeting dream does
put me to sleep,

1219
01:15:42,403 --> 01:15:46,612
As a heart filled with
desire calls out,

1220
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:50,820
and quietly I am immersed
into the newness,

1221
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,070
Lost in a mysterious maze

1222
01:15:55,195 --> 01:15:59,778
Tell me, Tell me,
Tell me in your words…

1223
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,778
Where to go...

1224
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:14,028
Nice

1225
01:16:18,987 --> 01:16:20,820
I don't like any of them

1226
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:22,862
Your collection used to
be so much better

1227
01:16:23,028 --> 01:16:25,028
Could I see that one

1228
01:16:26,278 --> 01:16:27,278
Ya

1229
01:16:30,403 --> 01:16:31,487
Let me try

1230
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:33,778
Try it

1231
01:16:49,653 --> 01:16:52,612
I see you have a real knack

1232
01:16:52,903 --> 01:16:54,778
You have someone?

1233
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,487
Who?

1234
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:00,862
My sister, a cousin

1235
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,612
Please pack this

1236
01:17:10,987 --> 01:17:16,737
I must be looking even more
mysterious in this light

1237
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,278
Are you joking?

1238
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,778
No, no I'm serious

1239
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:22,945
Listen Aheli..

1240
01:17:22,945 --> 01:17:25,570
...if you think I'm making these
things up just to impress you..

1241
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:27,695
...then you're absolutely wrong

1242
01:17:28,362 --> 01:17:29,612
Basically I'm a film maker..

1243
01:17:29,653 --> 01:17:32,237
...and that is my first
and foremost priority

1244
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:35,820
I could even cast
an ugly, bald man..

1245
01:17:35,862 --> 01:17:39,570
...as long as he is
ideal for my character

1246
01:17:40,112 --> 01:17:41,528
It's a continuous
process of hunting..

1247
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,487
Which you will not understand…

1248
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,778
Why are you laughing?

1249
01:17:49,903 --> 01:17:51,403
No, I mean...

1250
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:55,278
You are very funny
when you're serious

1251
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:56,112
What?

1252
01:17:56,278 --> 01:17:57,153
Nothing

1253
01:17:57,487 --> 01:17:59,778
Meet me after classes at 4 tomorrow.

1254
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:00,820
Good night!

1255
01:18:10,778 --> 01:18:11,778
You didn't eat
your tiffin again?

1256
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:13,903
He hasn't even
touched the apple

1257
01:18:13,945 --> 01:18:16,070
I really can't deal
with him anymore

1258
01:18:16,487 --> 01:18:18,653
Why do you give him apples,
if he doesn't eat it?

1259
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:19,653
So what should I give him?

1260
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:23,237
He won't eat apples, bananas,
jam and bread or cake..

1261
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:24,528
What can I give him?

1262
01:18:24,778 --> 01:18:25,987
Cadny

1263
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:27,362
My little rascal,

1264
01:18:27,445 --> 01:18:29,237
its not cadny, it's candy

1265
01:18:29,278 --> 01:18:30,028
Sure!

1266
01:18:30,112 --> 01:18:33,070
Eat handfuls of candy everyday
and watch your teeth decay

1267
01:18:33,112 --> 01:18:36,195
If you don't eat your tiffin
tomorrow you'll get a real spanking

1268
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:38,903
Now come for your bath

1269
01:18:39,362 --> 01:18:40,445
No, not now

1270
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:43,112
Don't be naughty. Come fast,
I have a lot of work to do

1271
01:18:43,195 --> 01:18:44,653
No, not now

1272
01:18:44,862 --> 01:18:46,653
Just see what
your son is doing

1273
01:18:46,778 --> 01:18:48,070
Biltu..

1274
01:18:48,278 --> 01:18:49,487
Listen to your mother otherwise..

1275
01:18:49,528 --> 01:18:51,612
...I'll have to scold you

1276
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:52,987
Let's go

1277
01:18:54,737 --> 01:18:55,445
Come

1278
01:18:55,528 --> 01:18:57,903
I hate this

1279
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,612
Should I serve you lunch?

1280
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:05,903
Quickly Please. I'm already late

1281
01:19:15,903 --> 01:19:16,695
Hello

1282
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:18,737
It's me

1283
01:19:21,528 --> 01:19:23,820
Paromita, I've told
you not to call me

1284
01:19:24,028 --> 01:19:26,237
I had to call you Shona

1285
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:27,695
I'm very scared

1286
01:19:28,778 --> 01:19:29,403
What's wrong?

1287
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,778
I...

1288
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:36,820
My daughter Aheli might
get in touch with you very soon

1289
01:19:36,987 --> 01:19:39,653
She'll ask you things

1290
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:42,237
Whatever she asks must be
answered in the affirmative

1291
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:45,153
You must confirm
everything I've told her

1292
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,112
I really don't understand
what you want

1293
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,695
I can't find your book

1294
01:19:49,737 --> 01:19:51,570
I've searched high and low,
it's just not there

1295
01:19:51,778 --> 01:19:53,112
I'm sure she's taken it

1296
01:19:54,195 --> 01:19:54,862
Where?

1297
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,070
Shantiniketan

1298
01:19:56,445 --> 01:19:58,528
She is studying there

1299
01:19:58,653 --> 01:20:00,362
I can't explain everything
over the phone

1300
01:20:00,403 --> 01:20:01,445
I need to meet you

1301
01:20:01,487 --> 01:20:04,362
That's impossible

1302
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:07,028
Please, Shona...

1303
01:20:07,278 --> 01:20:08,487
Please Paromita...

1304
01:20:08,903 --> 01:20:10,820
Don't act crazy

1305
01:20:10,903 --> 01:20:12,653
Try to realise

1306
01:20:13,528 --> 01:20:16,070
Circumstances have changed

1307
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:19,153
You have a family
and so do I

1308
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:21,487
We can't destroy that

1309
01:20:21,612 --> 01:20:22,320
Please

1310
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:25,153
I have nothing more to lose Shona

1311
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,528
After losing you I
have lost everything

1312
01:20:27,653 --> 01:20:29,487
...and you are
responsible for it

1313
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:31,945
You have to answer for that

1314
01:20:32,153 --> 01:20:33,278
Why did you not…
- Paromita...

1315
01:20:33,403 --> 01:20:34,528
Please

1316
01:20:34,778 --> 01:20:35,945
Please

1317
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,445
Why can't you understand?

1318
01:20:37,612 --> 01:20:39,487
I don't want to
understand anything

1319
01:20:39,737 --> 01:20:41,987
You have to meet me, Shona

1320
01:20:42,112 --> 01:20:43,612
I'll come to your house if need be.
- No

1321
01:20:43,653 --> 01:20:44,570
No. Never. I...

1322
01:20:44,653 --> 01:20:47,862
Your lunch is ready

1323
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:49,820
Who was that?

1324
01:20:50,487 --> 01:20:51,528
Wrong number

1325
01:20:51,862 --> 01:20:53,945
Give me a minute

1326
01:21:19,028 --> 01:21:20,487
Hello

1327
01:21:21,653 --> 01:21:23,278
Whose this?

1328
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:24,737
Hello

1329
01:21:25,278 --> 01:21:26,362
Hello

1330
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:27,737
Hello

1331
01:21:36,612 --> 01:21:38,487
What kind of painting
are you interested in?

1332
01:21:38,653 --> 01:21:41,653
Human figures, mainly portraits

1333
01:21:41,778 --> 01:21:44,320
Do you want to see something?

1334
01:21:58,862 --> 01:22:00,237
When did you make this?

1335
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,570
Last night

1336
01:22:01,778 --> 01:22:05,070
I just thought of your
face, so I drew it

1337
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:06,903
Superb!

1338
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:12,403
Paromita Di also used
to draw very well

1339
01:22:12,737 --> 01:22:13,778
Can I keep this?

1340
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:14,320
Sure

1341
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:18,320
A fleeting dream does
put me to sleep,

1342
01:22:18,653 --> 01:22:23,987
As a heart filled
with desire calls out,

1343
01:22:41,945 --> 01:22:45,153
So, you know my mother
since childhood, right?

1344
01:22:45,903 --> 01:22:48,945
You could say she raised me

1345
01:22:49,195 --> 01:22:51,320
What do you think of her?

1346
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:52,445
Nice

1347
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:54,445
A little temperamental...

1348
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:57,903
Stubborn, impulsive...

1349
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,737
A little driven by emotions

1350
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,070
But she is a good soul

1351
01:23:03,153 --> 01:23:04,487
Do you know Anish Chatterjee?

1352
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:07,445
Yes, he's my brother

1353
01:23:07,695 --> 01:23:09,278
Your brother?

1354
01:23:09,445 --> 01:23:10,945
Yes. He's my uncle's son

1355
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,237
We live in the same house

1356
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:18,778
Oh shit! I'm screwed

1357
01:23:23,028 --> 01:23:25,153
have you read this book?

1358
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:28,903
No. This is Shona Da's first novel

1359
01:23:29,028 --> 01:23:30,820
Shona Da?

1360
01:23:31,695 --> 01:23:33,820
It's his pet name

1361
01:23:37,737 --> 01:23:39,570
Read the book

1362
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:42,528
Very important

1363
01:23:46,695 --> 01:23:49,445
Why are you getting
so worked up?

1364
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:52,612
If it's that bad let
Dr. Mitra take a look

1365
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,320
No fever, right?

1366
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,612
Then don't worry

1367
01:23:57,112 --> 01:24:00,403
A cold can be cured
by medication in a week...

1368
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:03,612
...and by nature in seven days

1369
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,195
Yes I'm ok

1370
01:24:06,653 --> 01:24:10,737
No, no, I'm not
drinking too much

1371
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:12,445
Yes

1372
01:24:12,862 --> 01:24:13,862
Bye

1373
01:24:14,153 --> 01:24:15,362
Take care

1374
01:24:15,612 --> 01:24:17,028
Good night

1375
01:24:25,528 --> 01:24:26,653
Your wife?

1376
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:29,445
Yes, tell me about it

1377
01:24:29,737 --> 01:24:31,528
Soumi breeds tension

1378
01:24:31,737 --> 01:24:33,070
My son has a slight cold

1379
01:24:33,237 --> 01:24:36,320
and so she's going mad
and driving me insane as well

1380
01:24:37,695 --> 01:24:39,945
What are you reading?

1381
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:44,028
Let's see

1382
01:24:46,945 --> 01:24:50,987
Anish Chattopadhyay,
as in Shona Da?

1383
01:24:51,112 --> 01:24:52,570
Yes

1384
01:24:53,403 --> 01:24:54,695
Where'd you get this?

1385
01:24:54,778 --> 01:24:56,028
It was given to me

1386
01:24:56,362 --> 01:24:57,445
By whom?

1387
01:24:57,737 --> 01:24:58,820
Aheli

1388
01:24:58,903 --> 01:25:01,903
And she told me
that I must read it

1389
01:25:02,737 --> 01:25:06,528
An Anish Chatterjee novel has been
given to you by Aheli

1390
01:25:06,778 --> 01:25:09,612
with instructions to read urgently…

1391
01:25:09,778 --> 01:25:11,695
What's the matter?

1392
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:12,487
I can't understand it.

1393
01:25:12,528 --> 01:25:15,278
But I think
it's complicated

1394
01:25:18,487 --> 01:25:22,028
“The Memoirs of fallen leaves”

1395
01:25:22,403 --> 01:25:25,653
Is this based on Shona
and Paromita's love story?

1396
01:25:25,945 --> 01:25:27,028
Not exactly but..

1397
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:27,778
...there are similarities

1398
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,987
For example it's
situated in North Kolkata

1399
01:25:30,528 --> 01:25:33,278
The hero is somewhat
similar to Shona Da...

1400
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,362
...and there is a child…

1401
01:25:35,695 --> 01:25:37,028
Which is you?

1402
01:25:37,362 --> 01:25:39,070
You could say that

1403
01:25:39,487 --> 01:25:41,153
Wonderful

1404
01:25:41,278 --> 01:25:42,612
My intuition tells me that..

1405
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:47,528
...we will find the climax for
our film in this book

1406
01:25:47,737 --> 01:25:48,487
Brilliant!

1407
01:25:48,528 --> 01:25:50,237
You may be happy

1408
01:25:50,653 --> 01:25:52,528
but I'm bloody tense

1409
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:53,987
Why are you tense?

1410
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:55,528
Things are getting complicated..

1411
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:57,195
I just hope nothing serious…

1412
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:58,903
Nothing will go wrong

1413
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,903
Think positive Monu

1414
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:03,862
I'm telling you,
just go for the story

1415
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:08,445
Just let the story flow

1416
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:10,403
Understood?

1417
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:11,445
Read

1418
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,945
Read it carefully

1419
01:26:14,195 --> 01:26:17,528
I'll attend to Rahul Babu
for a bit

1420
01:26:18,862 --> 01:26:20,945
This is mine

1421
01:26:25,362 --> 01:26:27,278
Did you read it?

1422
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:28,528
Yes

1423
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:33,195
Can I ask you something?

1424
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:34,737
What?

1425
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:40,862
What kind of relationship did
your brother and my mother share?

1426
01:26:41,278 --> 01:26:43,153
Nothing special

1427
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:47,278
Just a normal relationship between a
boy and girl living in the same locality

1428
01:26:47,487 --> 01:26:49,237
Why are you lying?

1429
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,570
What? Why should I lie?

1430
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:53,195
You are lying

1431
01:26:53,403 --> 01:26:56,653
I know very well that your Shona Da
and my mother were in a relationship

1432
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,862
And that was a serious one

1433
01:26:59,028 --> 01:26:59,987
If you know, then why ask?

1434
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,612
Because I want to know the truth

1435
01:27:01,945 --> 01:27:03,403
In this novel your brother has..

1436
01:27:03,528 --> 01:27:06,153
...mentioned a place
named Sundarpur...

1437
01:27:06,278 --> 01:27:08,528
where the protagonists
spend a night together

1438
01:27:08,778 --> 01:27:11,112
You remember?

1439
01:27:12,028 --> 01:27:17,237
Ma has told me about this
place on several occasions

1440
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:22,153
Ma said that she went
there with her parents

1441
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:24,653
And the place is
called Baneshwarpur

1442
01:27:24,987 --> 01:27:26,653
Baneshwarpur is our village house

1443
01:27:26,737 --> 01:27:28,195
I've gone there a couple of times

1444
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,362
But I don't recall Paromita Di
ever visiting that place

1445
01:27:31,695 --> 01:27:34,153
I'll reconfirm with Ma
when I get home

1446
01:27:35,028 --> 01:27:37,612
I'm sure Ma went there
with your Shona Da

1447
01:27:37,778 --> 01:27:39,362
Why are you telling
me these things?

1448
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:42,070
Because you may
be able to help me

1449
01:27:42,112 --> 01:27:43,528
Help with what?

1450
01:27:48,987 --> 01:27:51,195
I have been very confused about
one thing since my childhood

1451
01:27:51,237 --> 01:27:53,737
and that's about my roots

1452
01:27:54,195 --> 01:27:56,653
I was in class 4 then...

1453
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:58,820
I had woken up in the
middle of the night and …

1454
01:27:58,903 --> 01:28:02,028
The girl is sick and
you weren't here

1455
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,403
So I brought her to bed with me.
What's the problem?

1456
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,403
You will not sleep next to her

1457
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:07,612
That's absurd. At least
give me a reason..

1458
01:28:07,695 --> 01:28:09,403
There is no reason.
I just say so

1459
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:10,987
I will not let Aheli
sleep next to you

1460
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:13,028
Why don't you say
what you mean?

1461
01:28:13,403 --> 01:28:15,320
Can't you understand
what I mean?

1462
01:28:15,612 --> 01:28:17,570
Oh God!

1463
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,570
Do you know what
you are saying?

1464
01:28:21,112 --> 01:28:23,028
You have a putrid mind!!

1465
01:28:23,445 --> 01:28:24,653
She's my daughter…

1466
01:28:24,695 --> 01:28:26,570
She is not your daughter

1467
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:29,320
How many times will I
have to explain it to you?

1468
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,695
She is not yours!

1469
01:28:31,945 --> 01:28:33,237
This is a fact

1470
01:28:33,362 --> 01:28:35,070
and this is the truth

1471
01:28:35,153 --> 01:28:37,278
Paromita!

1472
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:46,403
When I grew up and
asked Baba about it

1473
01:28:46,528 --> 01:28:49,612
He just laughed about it...

1474
01:28:49,903 --> 01:28:52,737
He said that Ma
said it in anger

1475
01:28:54,612 --> 01:28:58,320
But the question
is still haunting me

1476
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:05,195
I don't think we should
meet each other anymore

1477
01:29:06,362 --> 01:29:07,987
Who knows...

1478
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,153
We may be related by blood

1479
01:29:15,237 --> 01:29:18,778
I do not wait and
neither does time,

1480
01:29:18,862 --> 01:29:23,028
And broken love does
softly kill what's mine...

1481
01:29:23,153 --> 01:29:27,403
But I have hidden
the cruelty of time

1482
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:31,653
You may not understand
but to you I explain

1483
01:29:31,695 --> 01:29:37,612
How two fingers designed
can make river out of plain

1484
01:29:40,153 --> 01:29:41,737
My dear

1485
01:29:41,778 --> 01:29:44,445
How was your date?

1486
01:29:45,362 --> 01:29:47,320
Love, Love, Love…

1487
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,612
Love, Love, Love…

1488
01:29:49,987 --> 01:29:52,153
You are drunk Rana Da,
go to your room

1489
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:53,945
Wow!

1490
01:29:54,487 --> 01:29:57,320
Atleast I'm drunk on liquor..

1491
01:29:57,653 --> 01:30:00,195
...and not on some
random chick

1492
01:30:00,237 --> 01:30:01,278
Don't talk rubbish?

1493
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:02,987
I'm talking rubbish!

1494
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:04,695
Ever since we got here..

1495
01:30:04,987 --> 01:30:08,653
You've been stuck to
that girls' arse like a tick

1496
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,237
Rana Da please mind
your language

1497
01:30:10,278 --> 01:30:12,778
To hell with your language

1498
01:30:13,528 --> 01:30:15,403
I'd got you here
to write a story...

1499
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:18,070
All you're doing is horn
balling after some tail

1500
01:30:18,153 --> 01:30:19,403
I can't write any story

1501
01:30:19,487 --> 01:30:22,612
What the fuck have
you come to do then?

1502
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,320
Rana da, please
mind your language

1503
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:26,570
I am not in a good mood

1504
01:30:26,612 --> 01:30:28,320
Screw your mood -

1505
01:30:28,612 --> 01:30:30,653
You've come to Shantiniketan
to create a love story

1506
01:30:30,695 --> 01:30:32,862
Now you can't even
handle your own

1507
01:30:32,903 --> 01:30:33,320
Fucking arse hole –

1508
01:30:33,362 --> 01:30:35,153
Coming to Shantiniketan was your idea

1509
01:30:35,195 --> 01:30:36,487
And you took the
money from Rahul Bose.

1510
01:30:36,528 --> 01:30:38,653
Now get lost!

1511
01:30:40,195 --> 01:30:42,112
You raised your hand on me!

1512
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:45,945
How dare you..

1513
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:46,820
You are forcing my hand

1514
01:30:46,862 --> 01:30:49,028
Please get out of my room

1515
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:53,987
You dare lay your
hands on me!

1516
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:56,153
What's wrong? Rana Babu

1517
01:30:56,195 --> 01:30:57,487
Please take this man
away from here Rahul Babu.

1518
01:30:57,528 --> 01:30:59,237
I just can't stand him

1519
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,862
Let's go to our room

1520
01:31:00,945 --> 01:31:02,278
He hit me...!

1521
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,987
I taught this boy
everything he knows

1522
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:07,278
I introduced him
to the industry

1523
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:09,112
And today he...

1524
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:10,028
Ok, ok, Let's go to our room

1525
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:12,445
We'll deal with it
tomorrow morning

1526
01:31:12,528 --> 01:31:15,028
Why has he been brought here?

1527
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:17,278
To think of a story..

1528
01:31:17,362 --> 01:31:19,528
I can't think of any bloody story

1529
01:31:19,653 --> 01:31:21,153
Rahul Babu, let me tell you that
I will not be a part of this project

1530
01:31:21,278 --> 01:31:22,403
I'll leave for Kolkata in the morning

1531
01:31:22,528 --> 01:31:25,612
Ofcourse you will,
bloody coward

1532
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:26,403
You're a coward!

1533
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,903
And you're frustrated too!
Now get lost!

1534
01:31:28,945 --> 01:31:29,528
Let me go...

1535
01:31:29,612 --> 01:31:30,862
Rana Babu, Rana Babu

1536
01:31:30,987 --> 01:31:32,820
This not the right time
This not the right time

1537
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:33,778
Let's go to the room..

1538
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:35,612
We'll talk tomorrow morning

1539
01:31:35,695 --> 01:31:38,195
Ok, I'm going..

1540
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,737
I'm going Monu Chatterjee

1541
01:31:42,195 --> 01:31:45,820
Ok, I'll go, I'll go
away for good

1542
01:31:45,903 --> 01:31:47,987
Cool down, cool down...

1543
01:31:48,028 --> 01:31:50,070
Let's go

1544
01:31:51,528 --> 01:31:53,778
He raised a hand
on Rana Majumder

1545
01:31:53,945 --> 01:31:55,737
Rana...

1546
01:31:55,945 --> 01:31:57,862
I have taught him everything

1547
01:31:58,153 --> 01:32:00,112
He has truly repaid my tutelage.

1548
01:32:00,403 --> 01:32:02,695
Alright thank you…

1549
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:03,612
Let's go...

1550
01:32:05,195 --> 01:32:06,112
Good night

1551
01:32:06,237 --> 01:32:07,987
You don't need to carry me

1552
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,153
Let's go

1553
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,362
You truly repaid my tutelage

1554
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:13,570
Let's go...

1555
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:48,070
There is someone in reception
who has come to meet you

1556
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:52,070
Ok

1557
01:32:59,737 --> 01:33:00,778
You?

1558
01:33:01,653 --> 01:33:02,945
What's happened?

1559
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,862
Any problem?

1560
01:33:07,403 --> 01:33:09,278
Ma has run away from home

1561
01:33:09,362 --> 01:33:10,737
Run away from home!

1562
01:33:10,987 --> 01:33:12,403
Where to?

1563
01:33:13,653 --> 01:33:14,945
She hasn't said anything

1564
01:33:15,237 --> 01:33:18,195
Baba had called

1565
01:33:18,403 --> 01:33:22,570
He said that he woke up in the
morning and Ma wasn't there

1566
01:33:24,153 --> 01:33:26,528
She left a letter on
the dining table...

1567
01:33:26,695 --> 01:33:30,862
Which said, “I am leaving.
Don't search for me..

1568
01:33:30,987 --> 01:33:32,612
...I'm never coming back”

1569
01:33:32,695 --> 01:33:34,945
Have you informed
the police?

1570
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:38,278
I don't know.

1571
01:33:38,528 --> 01:33:41,195
Baba hasn't said
anything else

1572
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,945
Don't cry please.
Hold on

1573
01:33:47,362 --> 01:33:48,903
Let me check

1574
01:33:49,153 --> 01:33:50,987
Give me your phone

1575
01:34:03,278 --> 01:34:04,903
Boudi? Where is Shona Da?

1576
01:34:05,112 --> 01:34:07,237
Has he gone to the market?

1577
01:34:08,987 --> 01:34:11,528
Where has he
gone this early?

1578
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,653
Baharampur!

1579
01:34:14,862 --> 01:34:16,945
Ok, I'll call on his
mobile phone...

1580
01:34:20,153 --> 01:34:21,153
Shit!

1581
01:34:22,028 --> 01:34:23,195
No, I just needed his advice.

1582
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,403
It's ok, I'll talk to him later

1583
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:32,362
He's gone to Baharampur on
important office work this morning

1584
01:34:32,737 --> 01:34:35,070
He left his mobile
phone at home

1585
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:17,737
What stranger plays the flute,
Amidst this broken Eden

1586
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:34,903
What stranger plays the flute,
Amidst this broken Eden

1587
01:35:35,487 --> 01:35:41,403
My heart does flutter...

1588
01:35:41,862 --> 01:35:50,528
My heart does flutter...

1589
01:35:50,862 --> 01:35:58,195
In the footsteps of my soul

1590
01:35:58,403 --> 01:36:15,070
What stranger plays the flute,
Amidst this broken Eden

1591
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:27,987
It's been a long time Shona…

1592
01:36:39,528 --> 01:36:43,403
You're very angry
with me, aren't you?

1593
01:36:45,237 --> 01:36:47,153
You think...

1594
01:36:48,362 --> 01:36:52,070
I've blackmailed you
into coming here

1595
01:36:55,903 --> 01:36:59,528
I have come of my
own accord Paromita

1596
01:37:01,487 --> 01:37:02,987
I knew that I would
have to tell you someday..

1597
01:37:03,028 --> 01:37:07,528
...why I didn't turn up
at the registry office

1598
01:37:10,403 --> 01:37:14,070
Now I'm ready

1599
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:20,737
I don't want to know

1600
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:25,301
There is no point

1601
01:37:25,903 --> 01:37:28,010
I'll never get that day back

1602
01:37:31,315 --> 01:37:35,065
But I have to tell you...

1603
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,690
I have never been
able to forgive myself..

1604
01:37:40,023 --> 01:37:43,481
...for what I did to you

1605
01:37:44,315 --> 01:37:48,898
For all these years this
feeling has been dormant

1606
01:37:49,356 --> 01:37:51,148
So many years!

1607
01:37:53,481 --> 01:37:55,731
But I know...

1608
01:37:56,773 --> 01:37:59,940
If I tell you what
happened you will...

1609
01:38:00,023 --> 01:38:02,898
...You will forgive me

1610
01:38:04,065 --> 01:38:11,231
And once you forgive,
you can forget me…

1611
01:38:21,898 --> 01:38:25,440
I can never
forget you Shona

1612
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:28,981
I never want to

1613
01:38:32,148 --> 01:38:36,356
Would you like chicken
curry and rice?

1614
01:38:38,315 --> 01:38:41,273
Kangshari Da...
That's it

1615
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,190
The chicken curry
is fantastic

1616
01:38:46,648 --> 01:38:48,231
Let's see

1617
01:38:51,481 --> 01:38:53,856
Why are you taking
so much trouble?

1618
01:38:53,981 --> 01:38:56,606
You and your wife have
come here after a long time

1619
01:38:56,731 --> 01:39:00,648
It is my prerogative
to feed you

1620
01:39:01,773 --> 01:39:03,023
Kangshari Da?
- Yes

1621
01:39:03,106 --> 01:39:06,065
Wouldn't it be easier just to get
something from a nearby shop?

1622
01:39:06,356 --> 01:39:09,065
You won't find any shops
open at this time of day

1623
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:10,898
Don't you worry

1624
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:12,773
My daughter
cooks very well

1625
01:39:12,856 --> 01:39:16,648
I'll just cut the meat
and she'll cook it

1626
01:39:27,731 --> 01:39:29,856
Do you remember...

1627
01:39:30,565 --> 01:39:34,231
The first time
we came here?

1628
01:39:35,648 --> 01:39:37,606
A shaft of sunlight
fell invitingly..

1629
01:39:37,648 --> 01:39:40,065
...on the pond at the
back of the house

1630
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:43,356
Where the ducks did flee

1631
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:49,065
Madam, madam, what
are you doing?

1632
01:39:53,773 --> 01:39:58,023
Then in the afternoon
you were being stubborn...

1633
01:39:59,356 --> 01:40:02,481
You wanted to see me

1634
01:40:06,273 --> 01:40:09,148
The condition was that
you could only see

1635
01:40:09,731 --> 01:40:11,815
Everything else would
be post marriage

1636
01:40:36,773 --> 01:40:38,606
You are the one who
dishonoured that agreement.

1637
01:40:38,690 --> 01:40:40,648
No!

1638
01:40:44,106 --> 01:40:46,398
I didn't, Shona

1639
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:57,023
I've been married for so long

1640
01:40:57,106 --> 01:40:59,148
with a daughter...

1641
01:40:59,481 --> 01:41:03,481
You are wondering how
I saved myself for you?

1642
01:41:04,648 --> 01:41:07,398
Shona believe me...

1643
01:41:11,815 --> 01:41:14,815
I have never considered
myself married

1644
01:41:15,481 --> 01:41:17,981
I am merely used by a man...

1645
01:41:18,023 --> 01:41:22,106
I have told Salil Aheli is
your daughter not his

1646
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,106
But that's a lie.
- It is true for me

1647
01:41:26,606 --> 01:41:31,273
No man can ever
take your place

1648
01:41:31,273 --> 01:41:34,023
Never

1649
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:36,690
This is your delusion Paromita...

1650
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:41,356
You can't live by
holding on to the past

1651
01:41:49,065 --> 01:41:53,106
The past is the only thing
that keeps me alive Shona

1652
01:41:55,106 --> 01:41:58,606
When I stood in front
of you that day...

1653
01:41:59,273 --> 01:42:03,606
I wished I had
set no condition

1654
01:42:06,606 --> 01:42:09,148
I felt like falling
into your arms

1655
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:13,648
I wanted to make
love to you...

1656
01:42:18,856 --> 01:42:23,231
It is something I regret
to this day Shona

1657
01:42:30,273 --> 01:42:32,856
I couldn't help it

1658
01:42:33,065 --> 01:42:34,606
Believe me!

1659
01:42:35,606 --> 01:42:37,606
Nothing

1660
01:42:43,273 --> 01:42:46,565
When I was on my way
to the registry office...

1661
01:42:48,148 --> 01:42:49,815
I met a gentleman
outside my house

1662
01:42:57,065 --> 01:43:00,065
Anish, Anish, I've something
important to tell you

1663
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:02,981
Uncle, I'm in a bit
of a hurry right now...

1664
01:43:03,065 --> 01:43:05,523
No, no, I have to
tell you now

1665
01:43:05,856 --> 01:43:10,356
Listen, we found
Tapas Da, your father

1666
01:43:11,315 --> 01:43:14,773
You need to identify his body

1667
01:43:30,565 --> 01:43:32,815
Is that your father?

1668
01:43:34,523 --> 01:43:35,773
What are you saying?

1669
01:43:36,648 --> 01:43:38,023
That is your father!

1670
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:44,565
Anish, Anish, Anish...

1671
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:50,440
I refused to recognize my father..

1672
01:43:50,481 --> 01:43:52,940
...although I knew it was him

1673
01:43:55,606 --> 01:44:00,940
I walked through every alley
and by-lane I could find

1674
01:44:08,481 --> 01:44:14,815
All I was thinking about
was how to tell Ma

1675
01:44:29,606 --> 01:44:31,148
Shona?

1676
01:44:32,523 --> 01:44:35,273
The prompter, Kanu Babu
had come by

1677
01:44:35,315 --> 01:44:37,523
He said someone had seen..

1678
01:44:37,606 --> 01:44:41,731
Your father getting
off at Katoa Station

1679
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:46,606
Just go and
check it out…

1680
01:44:47,398 --> 01:44:49,815
Wait, wait, I've got
Kanu Babu's number,..

1681
01:44:49,898 --> 01:44:52,231
...let me get it

1682
01:44:58,606 --> 01:45:02,940
When I saw her face I couldn't bring
myself to tell the truth

1683
01:45:03,648 --> 01:45:08,606
I thought if I told her she'd
never be able to speak again

1684
01:45:10,065 --> 01:45:12,815
I had a lot to ask Baba

1685
01:45:13,773 --> 01:45:16,148
Especially about Monica Mashi

1686
01:45:16,398 --> 01:45:19,148
I had to reconcile

1687
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:24,440
But Paromita, I can't
take it anymore

1688
01:45:26,148 --> 01:45:27,856
I just can't

1689
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:37,773
Ma still asks
me about Baba

1690
01:45:39,856 --> 01:45:42,856
I still haven't told her

1691
01:45:43,773 --> 01:45:46,231
I choke up

1692
01:45:47,148 --> 01:45:49,815
I can't breathe

1693
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,690
Over the years...

1694
01:45:58,148 --> 01:46:04,106
This lie has gradually become an
unbearable burden on my soul

1695
01:46:11,106 --> 01:46:12,231
Shona?

1696
01:46:12,606 --> 01:46:16,023
I can't take it anymore...

1697
01:46:26,981 --> 01:46:30,273
Please forgive me...

1698
01:46:31,481 --> 01:46:35,315
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry...

1699
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:54,231
We will break the walls and
land upon a blessed isle

1700
01:46:54,606 --> 01:47:03,648
like in fairy tales
and nursery rhymes

1701
01:47:04,231 --> 01:47:13,440
The words I speak alone...

1702
01:47:13,856 --> 01:47:23,023
will change my time

1703
01:47:30,731 --> 01:47:32,815
Sleep well?

1704
01:47:36,731 --> 01:47:37,856
God!

1705
01:47:38,148 --> 01:47:42,856
Kangshari Da is taking ages
to make our chicken curry

1706
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:45,731
My stomach is killing me…

1707
01:48:04,065 --> 01:48:06,856
Monu and Aheli have come

1708
01:48:11,023 --> 01:48:14,440
How did they
know we are here?

1709
01:48:37,356 --> 01:48:38,815
Wait

1710
01:48:39,106 --> 01:48:41,106
Let me get them

1711
01:49:08,273 --> 01:49:11,023
Baba boudi has jumped
into the pond!

1712
01:49:11,106 --> 01:49:13,606
Come here quickly

1713
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:35,731
Paromita!

1714
01:49:43,356 --> 01:49:44,481
Ma!

1715
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:45,731
Ma!

1716
01:49:46,065 --> 01:49:50,065
Ma! Ma!...
- Paromita!...

1717
01:49:55,065 --> 01:49:57,315
Get up Ma!

1718
01:49:57,356 --> 01:49:59,606
So this is how the story ends? …

1719
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:02,023
What the hell
am I thinking!!

1720
01:50:02,231 --> 01:50:06,231
Look at me!
- Paromita...

1721
01:50:23,565 --> 01:50:28,856
Could you please tell your father…

1722
01:50:42,690 --> 01:50:44,690
Allow me

1723
01:50:57,231 --> 01:50:59,190
Come back soon...

1724
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:19,648
When my search for a love story
began I never thought

1725
01:51:19,856 --> 01:51:24,273
I'd actually be part of
a real life love story

1726
01:51:31,356 --> 01:51:33,190
But all is well

1727
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,481
Rahul Babu has got his
contemporary love story

1728
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:38,731
at least I hope so

1729
01:51:38,856 --> 01:51:41,065
The script is complete

1730
01:51:43,648 --> 01:51:45,940
I've reconciled with Ranada

1731
01:51:46,148 --> 01:51:47,648
I love the man

1732
01:51:47,731 --> 01:51:50,065
He's really taught me a lot

1733
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:54,398
Recently he's been teaching me the
nitty gritties of cinematography

1734
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:56,856
How's this?
- Nice frame

1735
01:51:57,148 --> 01:51:58,356
As a result of hanging
out with me

1736
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,815
Aheli has also been
bitten by the film bug

1737
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:02,356
And she is really good!

1738
01:52:02,481 --> 01:52:04,940
She gives us brilliant
ideas pretty often

1739
01:52:05,315 --> 01:52:07,065
After completing Rahul Babu's film..

1740
01:52:07,106 --> 01:52:09,148
We are planning to make another

1741
01:52:09,356 --> 01:52:10,940
The concept is mainly Aheli's..

1742
01:52:11,065 --> 01:52:13,565
...but I have some inputs

1743
01:52:15,231 --> 01:52:16,731
Paromita Di is better

1744
01:52:17,023 --> 01:52:19,315
She seems to have broken
out of the trance..

1745
01:52:19,356 --> 01:52:21,106
She was in all these years

1746
01:52:21,606 --> 01:52:24,148
Aheli's father is a very patient guy...

1747
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:28,940
He really proves love still exists

1748
01:52:29,273 --> 01:52:32,315
Salil Da and Paromita Di are
now going on a world tour

1749
01:52:32,565 --> 01:52:34,398
Aheli is very happy about it

1750
01:52:34,731 --> 01:52:36,398
Now we shall spell 'APPLE'

1751
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:38,190
Shona Da has finally
managed to..

1752
01:52:38,231 --> 01:52:40,356
...tell his mother about
my uncles death

1753
01:52:40,731 --> 01:52:42,981
It shook her but
she didn't break

1754
01:52:43,398 --> 01:52:44,690
It's probably good
for her to be free..

1755
01:52:44,856 --> 01:52:47,356
...of the anxiety and helplessness..

1756
01:52:47,398 --> 01:52:48,565
...she's felt for so long

1757
01:52:49,606 --> 01:52:51,731
Shona Da is now working
on his new play

1758
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:53,565
I even heard that
Suman Mukhopadhyay..

1759
01:52:53,606 --> 01:52:55,273
...may direct the play

1760
01:52:55,856 --> 01:52:57,481
The most amazing thing is that..

1761
01:52:57,565 --> 01:53:01,398
...after that day Rana Da
has quit drinking

1762
01:53:01,565 --> 01:53:04,356
In fact he scolds me for having
more than two pegs

1763
01:53:04,565 --> 01:53:06,190
Hats off to him…

1764
01:53:06,356 --> 01:53:07,023
At the moment..

1765
01:53:07,065 --> 01:53:09,690
...he is sincerely working
on the film plan

1766
01:53:09,898 --> 01:53:12,523
I think our film shall not only
appeal to Rahul Babu and his wife

1767
01:53:12,606 --> 01:53:15,231
but to anyone who loves cinema...

1768
01:53:17,606 --> 01:53:19,523
Action! Move!

1769
01:53:23,523 --> 01:53:26,269
- Look here!
- "Biplab".

1770
01:53:26,527 --> 01:53:30,151
- Oh no!
- It's your father!

1771
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:32,510
- No, he's not my father.
- (indistinct)

1772
01:53:32,534 --> 01:53:35,416
- (Indistinct)
- Please check properly.

1773
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:37,980
Biplab, Biplab, Biplab...

1774
01:53:45,574 --> 01:53:47,871
- Great! Nice shot.
- Over.

1775
01:53:47,895 --> 01:53:50,613
- Hey come here!
- Let's ready for the next shot.

1776
01:53:50,645 --> 01:53:56,722
(Indistinct)
