1
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,640
"Knock it out!"

2
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
"Knock it out!"

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,920
"Knock it out!"

4
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,880
"Knock it out!"

5
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Sorry, sir, we did knock the door,

6
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
but the door broke.

7
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Hello. He's such a sweet kid.

8
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,480
How are you?

9
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Hello, sir.
- Hi, dear.

10
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
You take after your dad!

11
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,040
Sir, be happy.
- Smile.

12
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,520
Your family is happy.

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,080
Sir, shall we discuss the deal?

14
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,520
Dabbu, give me the documents.
- Sure.

15
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,360
Smile, sir. You're on camera.

16
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,760
It is your happy day today.

17
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm giving you the market price.

18
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,720
Don't worry.

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,120
I gave the house to you on rent
thinking you're respectable people.

20
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,000
You seized it.

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,560
Promila.

22
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,160
"Knock it out!"

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,400
Sir, you teased me.

24
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
You misbehaved with me.

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,280
You tried to rape me.

26
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,080
I won't spare you.

27
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,160
I will go to the court.

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,920
Do you have no shame? How could
you do such things at this age?

29
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,320
On top of that, you cheated
my husband too.

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,040
Enough!

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,000
Sign it.

32
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,680
Sir, sign it.

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,160
Explain it to your father.

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,440
Your grandson is very cute.

35
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,400
He studies in
Jolly Public School, right?

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,000
No! No! Be cool, Nanu.

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Sir, smile and sign those documents

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,800
with a smile on your face.

39
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
Such things happen.

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,880
Sometimes tenants buy the house.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
Come on, sir. Sign it.

42
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,520
We could've planted drugs
in your house too,

43
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,400
but let it be.

44
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,240
Sir, please smile.

45
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,880
There!

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
"Knock it out!"

47
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
Very good.

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,440
So, here it is.

49
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,520
What is this?

50
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,120
Is this today's market price?

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
Sir, it is a market, after all.

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,720
Who cares if it was
today's market or yesterday's?

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,480
Dabbu, click a picture.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,120
Come on.

55
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,000
"Come on, let me
take you for a stroll."

56
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,800
"Take you for a stroll
and dance for you."

57
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
"My dance, my lips,"

58
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,800
"my eyes have made
everyone restless."

59
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,360
"Sapna Choudhary,
your dance drives me crazy."

60
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,920
"Sapna Choudhary,
your dance drives me crazy."

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,680
"Sapna Choudhary,
your dance drives me crazy."

62
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,600
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you."

63
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,720
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you."

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,080
"You have a good physique,
and you're very passionate."

65
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,440
"O boy, you look like Dharmendra."

66
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,000
"I'll dance."

67
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,240
"You have a good physique
and you're very passionate."

68
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,440
"O boy, you look like Dharmendra."

69
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,560
"Your eyes are mesmerising."

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,640
"You've cast a spell on me."

71
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,720
"Your words are making me
go crazy."

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,600
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you."

73
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:20,000
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you. - I'll dance."

74
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,400
"My dance, my lips, my eyes
have made everyone restless."

75
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,160
"Everybody!"

76
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,320
"When I sway my waist,
the entire Haryana sways with me."

77
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,200
"Everyone wants to have
an affair with me."

78
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,240
"When I sway my waist,
the entire Haryana sways with me."

79
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,480
"Everyone wants to have
an affair with me."

80
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,600
"Everyone is crazy
about my beauty."

81
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,800
"O boy, I want to make you mine."

82
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,760
"No one won my heart like you did."

83
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,640
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you."

84
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,960
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you."

85
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:20,120
"You're making a Jatt
yearn for you."

86
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
Yes, mom.

87
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,720
I was jogging.

88
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Yes.

89
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,880
Who, Gayatri?

90
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,960
Yes, her daughter.

91
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,160
Yes, I'll get chocolates for her.

92
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,960
Somebody call the police.

93
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Mom, I'll call you back.

94
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,880
What is it?

95
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
What happened?

96
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,440
Look here.

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Call the police.

98
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,720
Don't get involved in
such matters. Be careful.

99
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
Do something. - Somebody call
her home from her mobile phone.

100
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,120
She's bleeding profusely.

101
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,560
This is a police matter.

102
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,520
Did you see who hit her?

103
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,560
Somebody call the police.

104
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,880
What are you watching?

105
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,080
Take her to the hospital.

106
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,000
There are many people
standing here.

107
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,360
Why do you want to be the saviour?

108
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,880
This is police matter now.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,760
Go and file a complaint
with the police.

110
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,400
She will die by then.

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,280
What wrong did I say?

112
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,640
Sir, I saw a white car
hit her and drove away.

113
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,040
He ran into her.

114
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,880
Pick up the phone.

115
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm frying fritters, sir.
- Shut up.

116
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,680
Everything will be fine.
I'll take you to the hospital.

117
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
Sir, my fritters...
- Shut up!

118
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,560
This is more important.

119
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
Sir, my mom is calling me.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,120
Disconnect it.
- Okay.

121
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
Open your eyes.

122
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,400
Sir, listen to me.
- Open the door!

123
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,880
Sir..
- Open the door!

124
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,760
The front door.
- Okay, sir.

125
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,480
Sit inside! Sit inside!
- Sir, let me go.... Okay!

126
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,120
Sir...
- Shut up!

127
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,960
Everything will be fine.

128
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
Sir, I'm getting a call.
- Shut up.

129
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,400
You don't worry.

130
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,640
You'll be fine.

131
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,720
I also got hurt once,
but I am fine now.

132
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
I am with you. I will save you.

133
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,120
Hurry up! What are you doing?

134
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,600
We're almost at the hospital.

135
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,080
You have a great smile.

136
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,240
We'll get there in two minutes.

137
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,800
Sir, I'm getting calls constantly.
- Shut up.

138
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Open your eyes.

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,640
Open your eyes. Look at me.

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,080
We're almost at the hospital.

141
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
We'll be there in some time.

142
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,080
Focus on me and keep
your eyes open.

143
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,920
Don't worry. You'll be fine. Okay?

144
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Come on.

145
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,680
Sir, it's time for breakfast.

146
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,560
Sir, I'll lose my wages,
I will have to leave.

147
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,200
We've reached.

148
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,080
Open your eyes.

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,760
You'll be fine. Okay?

150
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,960
Just few more minutes.

151
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,920
Open your eyes.

152
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,400
Open your eyes.

153
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
Hey!

154
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,680
Stop! Stop!

155
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
Hello?

156
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,320
Hey.

157
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,160
Ma'am...

158
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,880
Sorry, sir. She's no more.

159
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,160
Sir...

160
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
Sir, the mobile phone.

161
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,800
Sir, call her parents,
I have to leave.

162
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,680
Sir, I am a confectioner.
I work on daily wages. Let me go.

163
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,920
Okay, you can take
the money from me.

164
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,000
Hello?
- Siddhi?

165
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
Siddhi.

166
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,920
Where's Siddhi?

167
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,560
Siddhi?

168
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,120
Siddhi?

169
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Is my Siddhi here?
- Sorry, you can't go inside.

170
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,160
Siddhi.

171
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Siddhi.

172
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,240
Siddhi.

173
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
Siddhi, my dear.

174
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,960
She left home to buy yogurt.

175
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,200
What happened to my daughter?

176
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,120
She didn't eat anything
since morning.

177
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,640
My child...

178
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,040
Sir, did you see anything?

179
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,600
Where did you get this from?

180
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,240
This belongs to Siddhi.

181
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,480
Did you get this from
the accident spot?

182
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,360
Did you call me?

183
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,400
Were you there?

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,920
Sir, tell me who hit my daughter.

185
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,280
Who ran into her? Please tell me.

186
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,680
Please.

187
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,840
Please tell me how this happened.

188
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
For God's sake, please tell me.

189
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,720
Look, she lost her mother
only a year ago.

190
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
Now, my child...

191
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,440
Sir, please tell me.

192
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,920
How did this happen?

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,320
Who killed my child?

194
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,000
Who killed my child?

195
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,360
O God.

196
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,960
Siddhi, my child.

197
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,400
You need to look fearsome.
What are you doing?

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Be fearsome.

199
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,760
Kick the door.

200
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
What brings you here at this hour?

201
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,880
Are you doing yoga?

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,320
"Knock it out!"

203
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,200
Ma'am!

204
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,400
You sell your flat to us.
- What?

205
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,960
Yes, we have the documents.

206
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,560
What are you saying?

207
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,200
Is your husband at home?
- Yes.

208
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
Call him.

209
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
Listen!

210
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,000
Listen!

211
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,480
Why are you talking so softly?

212
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,160
Roar like a lion.

213
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,040
I need an antacid.

214
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
I had chickpeas,
I am feeling restless.

215
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
What's the matter?

216
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,000
Nanu is here.
He wants to talk to us.

217
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,560
I see.
- Yes.

218
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
What's the matter?

219
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,000
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

220
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Please have a seat.

221
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,720
Sir, sell your flat to us.

222
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,160
What?

223
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,560
Or I will break your bones!

224
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
What?

225
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,320
Sir, try to understand.

226
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,200
We've seized your flat.

227
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Dabbu, action.

228
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,920
Sign the documents.
Please smile. You're on camera.

229
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,440
Promila, come on.

230
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
Sir, you teased me.

231
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,560
You misbehaved with me.

232
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
You tried to rape me.

233
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,360
I won't spare you,
I'll go to the court.

234
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,040
You can go to the court later,
I'll call the police now.

235
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,360
I'll blow your brains out.

236
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,480
I know which school
your grandson studies in.

237
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,840
Grandson?

238
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
I don't have a grandson.

239
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,440
You don't have a grandson?

240
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,720
To hell with his grandson!

241
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,400
Give me the documents.
- Okay.

242
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,080
Sir, we're tenants
and we've seized your house.

243
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Sell the house to us.

244
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,600
Fantastic, automatic.

245
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,240
Sign it!

246
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,560
"Knock it out!"

247
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,040
I forgot the gun on the fridge.

248
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
Sir, we were trying to fool you.

249
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,880
No problem.

250
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,880
Actually, it is a big festival.

251
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
It happens on 1st April.

252
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,760
Let's get out of here.
- Vacate my house by tomorrow.

253
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,600
Do you get it?
- Okay, sir.

254
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,840
Get out!

255
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,560
Don't you dare come here again!

256
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
"Knock it out!"

257
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,920
There's no conviction whatsoever.

258
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,720
This won't do, Nanu.

259
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,040
We're small-time criminals.

260
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,880
Other gangs will take over.

261
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,200
You should be able to terrorise
people with your eyes.

262
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,400
You never know, we may become
the Mafia in future.

263
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
You look like a noble guy now.
- Hey!

264
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,320
Don't talk rubbish.

265
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,640
Nanu will knock you out with one blow.

266
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,960
He's a terror.
- Yes.

267
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
He's so dangerous,
he never feels happy.

268
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,640
Am I right, Nanu?
- Yes.

269
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,400
Nanu, emotions mean nothing these days.

270
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,320
Just remember, whoever hits first
is the winner.

271
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,680
Had he signed the documents,
the property would have been ours.

272
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,440
The advance payment was ready.

273
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,800
Nanu, just think.

274
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,200
If we have no work,
we can't enjoy life.

275
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,200
We have to work hard. It takes
a lot of research and planning

276
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,320
to get the details of a property.

277
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,920
And Promila ran away.

278
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,760
I am a little

279
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
depressed from within.

280
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,560
All of you get down here.

281
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
What?

282
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,720
Get down here, I want to go home.

283
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,240
Dabbu, if you see me emotional again,

284
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,240
give me a tight slap.

285
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,680
Nanu, everything will be fine.

286
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,200
Go home and watch some action movies.

287
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
"Knock it out!"

288
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,760
You will be back to normal.

289
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,000
Remember, you always have
to be on the offensive.

290
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,880
Right?
- Yes.

291
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,840
If someone asks you the time,

292
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,040
You should reply, 'Hey!'
- Hey!

293
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,880
'I don't have a watch,
buy one for yourself.'

294
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
Buy one for yourself.

295
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,120
Or say, 'I am not your servant.'

296
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,760
I am not your servant.

297
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,400
We haven't caused God any harm.
- No.

298
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,440
Everything will be fine.
- Yes.

299
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,360
Nanu, we haven't wronged anyone.

300
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,640
Go home and drink
a chilled beer. - Okay.

301
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Drink it without fail.

302
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,520
'There's this company in Bangalore
and its costing seems right to me.'

303
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,560
'Let things go as it is.'

304
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,080
'It's an old factory.'

305
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,360
'Mr Kapoor, the world has
progressed so much.'

306
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,080
'We will have to cope up, right?'

307
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,600
'Dad, put the cigarette down.'

308
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,720
'This is a vacant area.'

309
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,320
'I want to utilise this area.'

310
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,840
'I have made a project report,'

311
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,000
'please go through it.'

312
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,880
'Why should I go through it?
You explain it to me.'

313
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,480
'Mr Kapoor, you're very lazy.'

314
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,520
'But anyway, I want to set up'

315
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,960
'an industrial chilling unit
in this vacant area.'

316
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,200
'I've spoken to the
company in Bangalore,'

317
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
'they might come
for a survey tomorrow.'

318
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,920
'Power consumption will be high, '

319
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,800
'but we'll handle it.'

320
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,920
'Mr Kapoor,
what do you have to say?'

321
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,240
'What will I say?'

322
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,720
'You didn't allow me to smoke.'

323
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,080
'But I will smoke.
- Will you?'

324
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,640
'Yes, I will.'

325
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,960
'Mr Mathur, I've spoken
to the bank about the loan.'

326
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,040
'Please follow up with them.
- Okay.'

327
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,200
'Hey, stop. Look here. Okay?'

328
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
Are you happy?

329
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
'Tell me you're happy.
- I am happy.'

330
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Rahul! Thangayya! Niraj!

331
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Where the hell are you guys?

332
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,080
Come here quick!

333
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,720
Go and check what's going on.

334
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,640
Why did the lights go off?

335
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,040
I've told you many times

336
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,640
that there shouldn't be a power cut
in my daughter's factory. - Yes, sir.

337
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
Go and check immediately.
- Right away, sir.

338
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,680
Turn on the generator no matter
what happens. - Right away, sir.

339
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,920
I'll sack all of you if the power
isn't restored.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
I've told you many times!

341
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,480
Why can't you understand?

342
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,600
You seem to be very happy.
What's the matter?

343
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
Where are you coming from?

344
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,080
I had been to your wife's wedding.
Did you not attend?

345
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,000
Ever since you've come to this society,

346
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,160
everyone is happy.

347
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,720
Let me tell you a secret.

348
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,560
Speak up.

349
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,280
Sir...

350
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
Speak up!

351
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,760
Sir, the lift is not working.
I thought I should inform you.

352
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,040
Bro!

353
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,120
How are you, Bro!

354
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,560
You don't know me, do you?

355
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,520
But I know you.

356
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
Your mom... The short lady
is your mom, right?

357
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,960
She's a very nice lady...
- What do you have to say?

358
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,320
Actually, it doesn't look good

359
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,480
but she borrowed Rs 300 from me
to pay the cab driver.

360
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,160
I am completely broke.
If you could give it to me...

361
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,840
You can actually ask your mom.

362
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,600
Thanks, Bro.

363
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,880
It was lovely meeting you.

364
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,200
I'll see you around.

365
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
'How many times have I told you not
to give my clothes to the launderer?'

366
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,040
'Can't you iron them yourself?'

367
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,440
'Has your dad ever got his clothes
washed at the laundry?'

368
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,640
'Don't talk about my dad.'

369
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,280
'What did you say?'

370
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,960
'He handed you over to me'

371
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,200
'and made my life miserable.'

372
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,400
'And then you argue with me.'

373
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
'Go and work as a maid.'

374
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,880
'You dare argue with me!'

375
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Hey, hi.
- I heard some noise inside.

376
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,480
No. It's nothing.

377
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,560
Are you sure?
- Yes.

378
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,920
Please come inside.

379
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,360
No thanks.

380
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,920
Alright.

381
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,000
Stop.

382
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,680
What's the matter?

383
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,920
Your mom is not to be seen these days.

384
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,840
Even your mom is not to be seen.

385
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,480
You brought your mom
when you wanted to rent the house.

386
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,160
And then...

387
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,720
I will talk to the owner.

388
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,240
Bachelors are not allowed
in our building.

389
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,200
Get me married to your daughter,
you rascal.

390
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,080
I will be a married man.

391
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,440
Secretary, get the lift repaired.

392
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,880
Hey, Phantom!

393
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,600
Phantom.

394
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,320
'Phantom, come soon.'

395
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,280
'It's time for dinner.'

396
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,160
Ma'am, I need an opener.

397
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,720
I am suffering from acidity
and stomach ache.

398
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,720
I've bought a soda,
but I don't have an opener.

399
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,960
"The day has ended.
It's evening now."

400
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,280
Are you going to drink alone?

401
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Yes, alone.

402
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I won't give you the opener. You may go.

403
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,680
Aarti! - The bottle on the terrace
is yours, isn't it?

404
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,920
Yes, one moment.

405
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Here, talk to her.

406
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Hello?
- 'You started drinking beer!'

407
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
'You scoundrel! You have changed
for the worse after going to Delhi!'

408
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,320
'Come back home.'

409
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,160
Mom, nothing of that sort.

410
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,080
I'll call you later.

411
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,720
'Listen to me...'

412
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,840
You enjoy doing this, don't you?

413
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Nanu, shall I tell you the truth?

414
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,160
I have always enjoyed
snitching on people.

415
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,080
Thank you.
- Enjoy your soda.

416
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,320
"Do you want to go fast?"

417
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,560
They are here!

418
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,880
Mark my hand.

419
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,840
Hey!
- "Come on."

420
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,720
"Come my baby doll.
Your photo is on my wall."

421
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,520
Cheers!

422
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,600
"I just lose control."

423
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,600
Are you coming along?
- You go ahead.

424
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,760
"You wear stilettos
and short tops."

425
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,400
"Baby, come into my arms,
don't stop yourself."

426
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,360
"You wear stilettos.."

427
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
You get set with her.

428
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
"Baby, come into my arms,
don't stop yourself."

429
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,920
Hi.
- Hi.

430
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,320
Buy me a drink.

431
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,280
Buy your own drink.

432
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,160
Has your dad lent me money?

433
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
"I am high."

434
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,640
"When I saw you on the floor..."

435
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,440
"Your dark tresses look like
the dark clouds of monsoon."

436
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,360
"O darling, you look like
a cloud floating in the sky."

437
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,200
"Your dark tresses look like
the dark clouds of monsoon."

438
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,360
"O darling, you look like
a cloud floating in the sky."

439
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,520
Get me a Jack, please.

440
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
"Dance with me."

441
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,320
Sir.

442
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,560
"To hell with you."

443
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,800
"A red ribbon adorns
by dark tresses."

444
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
Did you give me a non-alcoholic drink?

445
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,480
I'm not getting a kick.

446
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,480
Sorry, sir. - How dare you give him
a non-alcoholic drink. I'll slap you.

447
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,120
Get him a proper drink.

448
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,120
Why are you being so polite?

449
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,800
Show them your style with a tight slap.

450
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,040
Yes.

451
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,280
I wonder why I was requesting to him.

452
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,880
I am so sorry.

453
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,480
Nanu, you apologised!

454
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,960
Darn you!

455
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,040
Leave him.

456
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,200
Hit him.

457
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,360
Hit him hard.

458
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,240
"The girl looks like Madonna,
I'm intoxicated."

459
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,640
"The girl is dancing
on the dance floor."

460
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,720
"Your dark tresses look like
the dark clouds of monsoon."

461
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,960
"O darling, you look like
a cloud floating in the sky."

462
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,040
At last, the bad phase has passed!

463
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,040
Nanu is back in action.

464
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,160
You thrashed someone after a long time.

465
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,280
Nanu, you should stop
trying to be decent.

466
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,560
You're right.

467
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,440
So what if the girl died?
I tried my best though.

468
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,600
Hereafter, if someone meets
with an accident,

469
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,600
tell them that you'll save them
only if they survive.

470
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,040
I had lost interest in girls and work.

471
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,600
I didn't even feel like drinking.

472
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,120
I felt weird.

473
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
To hell with emotions.

474
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,440
I had become numb.

475
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,080
Hey! You road hog!

476
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,560
Don't get emotional.

477
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Nanu, let's go.

478
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,520
I'm going to get him.

479
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,640
Nanu.
- Hey.

480
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Nanu, be careful.

481
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
What are you doing?

482
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,120
Don't you understand?

483
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,840
Come out!

484
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
What are you doing?

485
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,080
You idiot, you hit and run!

486
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,160
They are someone's children,
don't you feel ashamed?

487
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,760
Will you ruin us?

488
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,000
You're getting emotional again.

489
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,320
Yes, I am emotional.

490
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,240
What will you do?

491
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,800
You had asked me to slap you
when you get emotional.

492
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,840
I don't want to emotional.

493
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,240
Slap me. I won't get emotional.

494
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,880
Slap me!

495
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
Since then my mind
has been asking me

496
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,520
'Why I got into this mess.'

497
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,480
I should've asked that girl
if she'd survive or not.

498
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,440
Then this wouldn't
have happened.

499
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,080
Ma'am, I should've asked her, right?

500
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,680
But she died.

501
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,840
I told her that I won't let her die.

502
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,880
She was...

503
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,600
My life is in a mess.

504
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,240
What do you do?

505
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,160
I do all kind of odd jobs, ma'am.

506
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
Threatening people,
occupying other's houses.

507
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,360
An emotional man
can never do such jobs.

508
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,880
I am getting emotional
for every little thing.

509
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,720
I can hear a voice from within.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,960
My heart beats fast.

511
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,040
I've never experienced
such things before.

512
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,920
Had I left that day...

513
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Look, what's happening to me.

514
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,000
Don't worry.

515
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,720
Everything will be alright.
- Yes.

516
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,800
I'll give you a small injection.

517
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,160
Injection?

518
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
Ma'am,

519
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,840
he was so furious,

520
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,360
I can't even begin to describe him.

521
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,680
He has all the qualities that a man
should possess, in our profession.

522
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,680
He doesn't have emotions,

523
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,920
doesn't believe in any religion.

524
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,720
Whenever he gets angry,

525
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,960
he can destroy
everything around him.

526
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,640
He would beat people
so badly...

527
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,680
May God help them.

528
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,520
And look at him today,

529
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,760
he's like a softy
of Connaught Place

530
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,160
you get in front of
the Regal Cinema.

531
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,160
Ma'am, what has happened to him?

532
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,000
'This is called a
brief psychotic disorder.'

533
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,240
'A reactive psychosis.'

534
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,520
'It happens when you're in trauma'

535
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,320
'or in major stress.'

536
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,720
'It's usually a reaction to a
very disturbing event.'

537
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
'He couldn't see someone dying.'

538
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,080
'He has to control
his stress levels.'

539
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,920
'Or he can even hallucinate.'

540
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,720
Phantom!

541
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,760
Who are you playing with
at such late hour?

542
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,200
Phantom, where are you going?

543
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,960
Phantom!

544
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,440
Phantom, come with me.

545
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,320
Was she with you?

546
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,480
Come on, have dinner
and go to bed.

547
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,400
Ma'am.
- Yes.

548
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,800
Can you sleep in my house tonight?

549
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,640
What? Are you mad?

550
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,280
I mean, with your husband.

551
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,600
'Eat the biryani.'

552
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,320
'Owner has given it.'

553
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
Dabbu,

554
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,240
did you prepare all the documents
of this new flat?

555
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,320
Tell Promila to get ready
to tear her clothes.

556
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,240
We'll leave from here.

557
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,920
The owner has sent 'mutton biryani'.

558
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,880
It smells good.

559
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,200
Before I get emotional,

560
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
make a deal and get out of here.

561
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,360
I don't feel good in this house.

562
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,440
"The ghost is here, run."

563
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,680
"The ghost is here, run."

564
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,600
Please don't hit him.

565
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,440
Nanu!

566
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,600
You!
- "The ghost is here, run.'

567
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,880
"The ghost is here, run.'

568
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,840
How do you know my name?

569
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,160
"The ghost is here, run.'

570
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,120
"The ghost is here.'

571
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,600
First, the opener went missing,

572
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,280
then the bottle broke.

573
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,240
When I woke in the morning,
the entire house was clean.

574
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,800
You think it is a joke?

575
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,680
I won't lie to you,
it sounds like a joke to me.

576
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,080
You can kill me if you want,
but it really sounds like a joke to me.

577
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,240
Do you mean to say
ghost doesn’t exist?

578
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,040
Ghosts do exist, but they don't attack
each other.

579
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,200
I've not freshened up yet.

580
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
Have you seen your face?

581
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,880
The ghost will forget to freshen up
seeing your face.

582
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,000
Okay, I won't laugh.
The ghost comes at night.

583
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,000
I'll sleep with you tonight.

584
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,680
Dabbu, the day I leave the house,

585
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,480
I will thrash you so badly
that you'll forget laughing.

586
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,880
Don't go by my laugh.

587
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,160
I'm laughing because
of the circumstances.

588
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,640
I swear.

589
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,800
You!

590
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,880
Okay, we'll come
to your house tonight.

591
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,960
Sometimes,

592
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,160
even a tiger becomes a goat.

593
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,480
I am calling you a the tiger.

594
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Oh.

595
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,360
This ball.

596
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,160
How did she get the ball?

597
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,680
It was inside the house.

598
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,440
Let's occupy some other house.

599
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,120
Are you out of your mind?

600
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,840
Don't stress yourself unnecessarily.
Nothing will happen.

601
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,760
I've taken the deposit money
of this flat. Come on.

602
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,360
I am with you. Come on.

603
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,800
Phantom, don't play at
such late hour.

604
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,240
This is open.

605
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,440
Have you brought your partner
along to sleep?

606
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,040
What did she say?

607
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,320
I was scared last night so I had
asked her to sleep in my flat.

608
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,280
At least spare the married people.

609
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,800
Ghost, are you here?

610
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,520
Ghost!

611
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,240
Come out.

612
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,160
Show me your face.

613
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,080
Come face to face.

614
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,720
Nanu, come inside.
Think this as your own house.

615
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,480
Your friend Dabbu
is here to meet you.

616
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,640
Where's the ghost?
It isn't here as yet.

617
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,960
Ghost!

618
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
Don't go inside!

619
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,640
I might not die fearing the ghost,
but I'd die hear you screaming.

620
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,440
Listen to me carefully.

621
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,280
Ghosts don't exist.

622
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,040
Am I right?
I don't see the ghost here.

623
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,680
I think it must be here.

624
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,880
What do you say?

625
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,880
The ghost must be here.

626
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,200
Look, it is not in this.

627
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,440
I think it must be in it.

628
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,600
Look here, it is not here.

629
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,800
There's no treatment for illusion.

630
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,880
No one can treat it.

631
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,600
What are you doing?

632
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,640
Do you think I like ghosts?

633
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,000
You very well know that
I earn a little by the grace of God.

634
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,920
You go to sleep.

635
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,080
Focus on your work,
everything will be fine.

636
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,080
You sleep in the bedroom.

637
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,080
I'll handle everything.

638
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,160
I won't sleep inside,
I'll sleep here.

639
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,280
We've been cursed by people
whose houses we have occupied.

640
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,040
Dabbu, let's vacate this house.

641
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,760
Everything will be... - Shut up! You
always talk about vacating the house.

642
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,680
Are you out of your mind?
Ghosts don't exist.

643
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,240
To hell with the ghost!

644
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,760
Even you say the same thing,
I am with you.

645
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,280
I will hurt its ego.

646
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,840
If there's a ghost here,
it will appear before you.

647
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,240
Ghost, show me your power.

648
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,160
Come out if you're brave enough.

649
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,320
I am standing before you.

650
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,240
There's nothing here.

651
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,920
You are an illusion,
don't try to become reality.

652
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,680
I give a darn to ghosts like you!

653
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,960
Come out once!

654
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,400
Nanu, I will make it disappear
in a minute

655
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,960
or you can change my name.

656
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,680
You've made
my friend's life miserable.

657
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,240
You're asking me to vacate the house,
we work hard so much.

658
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,080
We work hard,
we don't eat for free.

659
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,520
The ghost is...

660
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,040
It's nothing.

661
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,800
I just slipped.

662
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,960
"The ghost is here.'

663
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,720
"The ghost is here, run!'

664
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,000
"The ghost is here, run!'

665
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,240
"Run!"

666
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,520
"The ghost is here.'

667
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,600
"The ghost is here, run!'

668
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,360
Nanu,

669
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,440
we won't tell anyone
what happened with us.

670
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,520
Okay?

671
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,880
People will mock at us.

672
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,280
You both come here.

673
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,280
Why are you standing like this?

674
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,640
Sir, there's a ghost in the house.

675
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,240
I see!

676
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,400
Take them along,
we'll make them meet God also.

677
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,360
I swear, you can ask him.

678
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,080
He looks possessed already.

679
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,040
You don't know who I am.

680
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,560
Who are you?

681
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,960
What's your name?

682
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,200
I know the ACP very well.

683
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,440
Sir, you shouldn't go by the looks,

684
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,960
you never know how influential
a person can be.

685
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,800
You go home.
- I can make...

686
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,400
It's late. Come on.

687
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,520
Good night. Let's leave.

688
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,840
Come on.

689
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,440
Hey!

690
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,560
Auto rickshaw!
- Auto rickshaw!

691
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,800
Take us to Rashtrapati Bhavan.

692
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,240
Get inside.

693
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,840
Come on.

694
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,400
Yes, sir.

695
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,480
Yes sir, you note down the address.

696
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,160
Okay, note it down.

697
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,720
80-S Pristine,
Sector 150,

698
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,320
Tower 7,

699
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,240
flat number 07051, Noida.

700
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,440
Okay.

701
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,040
Hold on for a moment.

702
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,520
Nanu, she's asking for Rs 100,000.

703
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,880
Will she get the job done?

704
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,760
She had exorcised my wife.

705
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,360
She's doing fine now.

706
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,200
Move the vehicle from here.

707
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,760
You don't own the road.

708
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,040
Agree to it.

709
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Sir, done.

710
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,560
Okay.

711
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,840
I'm the owner of the house,
so I own the main road too.

712
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,480
Don't park your vehicle here.

713
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,800
You come with me in the morning.

714
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,760
Nanu, what will I do?

715
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,320
If there's more crowd,
the ghost will get alert.

716
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,320
One of their agents will come down.

717
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,160
He will get your work done.

718
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,720
I will set the depot on fire.

719
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,040
Nanu.

720
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:34,400
"Hail Lord Shiva."

721
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:41,040
"Hail Lord Shiva."

722
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,640
I don't eat for free.

723
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,200
I own a 5000 square yards bungalow.

724
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,200
"Hail Lord Shiva."

725
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,240
"Hail Lord Shiva."

726
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,800
"Hail Lord Shiva."

727
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:36,120
"Hail Lord Shiva."

728
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,080
What is it?

729
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,080
Money.

730
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,640
Cheque.

731
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,000
It is in trouble.
- What?

732
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,600
Not you, he.

733
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,640
Tone down while talking to me.

734
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,800
You don't know who I am.

735
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,600
Take him away.

736
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
There is something wrong
with this building.

737
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,800
The real owner...

738
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,120
I hope it is not her.

739
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,160
It is her child.

740
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,320
She lives in Paris.

741
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,640
Dear...

742
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,360
My dear...

743
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,160
Don't cry.

744
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,640
What?

745
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,520
We need to perform veneration.

746
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,040
In Paris?

747
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,560
Paris?

748
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,680
Don't think about the expenses.

749
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,520
If you waste time,

750
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,040
the time will get wasted.

751
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,160
Where is the money?

752
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,600
I had kept it in your purse.

753
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,800
Where is the money then?

754
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,800
"The ghost is here."

755
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,960
"The ghost is here, run!"

756
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,920
"The ghost is here."

757
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,760
"The ghost is here, run!"

758
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,160
"Run!"

759
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,200
"The ghost is here"

760
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,520
'Pa!'

761
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,000
Alfred, Ghanshyam!
- Yes, ma'am.

762
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,760
Run!
- "The ghost is here"

763
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,120
"The ghost is here, run!"

764
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,160
"The ghost is here"

765
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,840
Take care, okay.

766
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,560
But do you have the
ambulance number with you?

767
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,040
Ambulance will be there.
- Excuse me.

768
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,240
Excuse me, sir, listen to me.
- Give me a moment.

769
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,840
Listen to me, please.
- Okay.

770
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,680
What happened? What's the matter?

771
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,720
An accident took place
on the 24th September in the morning.

772
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,720
A girl died, I want her address.

773
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,840
What?

774
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,720
Jump from the 12th floor,

775
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,880
you'll go to her directly.

776
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,280
Hey, listen to me.
- Don't try to act smart, okay?'

777
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,600
Her name was Siddhi.

778
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,080
To hell with her, leave me.
- Hey!

779
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,680
I'll smash your face.
You don't know who I am.

780
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,040
Sit down.

781
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,880
I will give it to you.

782
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,320
B-49, Sector 18, Noida.

783
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,200
My daughter

784
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,280
died, I can't believe it.

785
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,440
I feel

786
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,040
she will hug me and say,

787
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,880
'Dad, let's have food.'

788
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,560
That's the reason
her soul is wandering.

789
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,320
She's become a ghost
and is troubling everyone.

790
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,680
Shut up!

791
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,120
If you were not the one
who tried to save her life,

792
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,000
I would've killed you.

793
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,760
You call her a ghost?
Look here.

794
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,400
Look at these pictures.

795
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,920
Her smile,

796
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,840
her liveliness and the glow.

797
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,720
Does she look like a ghost to you?

798
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,360
She didn't trouble anyone
when she was alive,

799
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
how can she do it after her death?

800
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,480
Sorry, sir.

801
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,400
Let's leave.

802
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,800
We'll have ice-cream. Come on.

803
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,320
Come on.

804
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,800
Come on.

805
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,960
I will not do any
illegal work hereafter.

806
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,760
He calls my daughter a ghost.

807
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,120
He calls my daughter a ghost.

808
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,000
He calls my daughter a ghost.

809
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,240
He calls my delicate
daughter a ghost.

810
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,240
He calls my daughter a ghost.

811
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,040
All her dreams remained unfulfilled.

812
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,000
You killed her!

813
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,520
You have to send her back.

814
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,920
You can't play with her destiny.

815
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,440
She's my daughter.

816
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,360
You have to send her back.

817
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,920
I'll see to it that she comes back.

818
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,400
She has to return to me.

819
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,280
She has to return to me.

820
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,240
I am sure,

821
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,320
you will surely return.

822
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,240
You have to return.

823
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,440
I've kept your body safely.

824
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,680
Please come back, dear.

825
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,080
Please come back.

826
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,800
'Come on, sign it.'

827
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,000
'That's it.'

828
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,000
Sir,

829
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,200
forgive me.

830
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,920
I will recover your house for you.

831
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,520
Yes, mom. What?

832
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,240
What?

833
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,160
Why did you come here?

834
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,280
Okay, I'm coming.
You don't go home.

835
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,040
You're at home?

836
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,800
Wait, I'm coming.

837
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,880
What is it?

838
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,400
I'm the boss here.

839
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,360
Get out! You!

840
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,400
What are you doing?
Walk slowly.

841
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,080
Get up, are you alright?

842
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,720
Get in.

843
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,200
Mom!

844
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,280
Mom!

845
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,240
Mom!

846
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,440
Mom, why did you come here?

847
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,040
I came here to meet my son.

848
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,040
Come with me.
- Wait, let me unpack my clothes.

849
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,600
I'm unpacking my clothes.
- Let that be.

850
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,640
You leave.

851
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,720
Mom, please.
- Nanu, leave me.

852
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,800
I am not going anywhere.
I will stay here.

853
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,080
Mom!

854
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,040
A ghost lives here.

855
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,360
A ghost.

856
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,080
If the ghost has kept
the house so clean,

857
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,040
I can get you married to it
right away.

858
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,560
You won't understand.

859
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,280
I understand everything.

860
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,720
You stay here, please.

861
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,040
Don't move. Okay.

862
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,840
Get the ghost.

863
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,280
What is it?
Will you break the door?

864
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,960
Sir, give me a beer.

865
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,280
I won't give it to you.

866
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,000
You asked Gayatri
to sleep in your house.

867
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,120
I was feeling scared.

868
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,720
Please give me one beer.

869
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,800
Who is it?

870
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,160
It is Nanu.

871
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,680
He must be asking for something.
- Yes.

872
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,160
I won't give you beer, leave.

873
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,160
Okay,

874
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,800
I'll drink from the bottle
that you've kept on the terrace.

875
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,120
I'll ask your wife before doing so
because it belongs to you.

876
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,640
Don't threaten me. Wait here.

877
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,920
Here.

878
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,480
Thank you.

879
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,120
What happened?
- I will take the money from you.

880
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,600
Did you give him anything?

881
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,600
No, I drove him away.

882
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,080
Mom?

883
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,480
What is it?

884
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,960
Everyone told me you drink,

885
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,360
but you want to drink in front of me?

886
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,200
Wait.

887
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,240
Come on, break it.

888
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,240
Come on, break it!

889
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,840
Even your father never dared to
drink liquor before me,

890
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,760
but you?

891
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,440
Did I hit you hard?

892
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,960
Nanu, where's your mom?

893
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
She's gone to watch a movie.

894
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,080
I thought you left your mom
alone at home.

895
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,240
Are you out of your mind?

896
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,480
How can I leave my mother alone
with the ghost?

897
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,400
Nanu, a man comes and goes
alone in the world. - You sit.

898
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,400
Dabbu, you stay quiet.

899
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,640
Please.

900
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,320
We haven't worked for long.
Think about it.

901
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,600
Nanu,

902
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,320
we'll have your father
meet with an accident.

903
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,240
Idiot.

904
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,520
Nanu, a fake accident.

905
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,120
Is it the time to lie?

906
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,600
Truth always prevails...
- Shut up.

907
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,880
Nanu, if everyone keeps their mouth...
- Somebody shut his mouth.

908
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,880
Nanu,

909
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,160
listen to me,

910
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,120
you call your mom and tell her
that your dad met with an accident.

911
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,560
Your mother will panic
and leave to see your dad,

912
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,000
and she will be away
from the ghost.

913
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,480
As simple as that.

914
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,640
Call me in some time, okay?

915
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,680
Mom, how was the movie?

916
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,360
It was rubbish.

917
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,440
What?
- What happened?

918
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,960
It's your dad.

919
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,440
Delhi lost the match.

920
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,120
So, he's upset.

921
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,640
No problem, they have four more
matches to play.

922
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,000
They lost because I didn't watch
the match with you.

923
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,200
Forget it.

924
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,640
You tell me, did you have food?

925
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,880
Will you hold on for a minute?

926
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I am getting a call
on the other line.

927
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,200
Hello?
- Hello, ma'am.

928
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,960
Ma'am, sir met with an accident.

929
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,320
This is bad news.

930
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,880
Who met with an accident?

931
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,480
Nanu's father.

932
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,000
I see.

933
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,080
Nanu's father met with an accident.

934
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,760
'Ma'am, what do I tell you?'

935
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,600
'He was walking on the road'

936
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,880
'and a truck driver
ran into him.'

937
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,360
'Ma'am, I think
the driver was drunk.'

938
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,560
He's only chanting your name.

939
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,800
I see.

940
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,600
What is he saying?

941
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,640
He's calling out,
'Nanu's mother'.

942
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,400
Idiot, we got caught.

943
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,080
Stop acting now.

944
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,680
Was I overacting?

945
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,600
You should've parked your vehicle
in the lobby. Why did you park it here!

946
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,920
Mom, you get down here,
I'll park the vehicle.

947
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,000
Wait for me.

948
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,560
His behaviour has been
strange lately.

949
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,680
Hello, ma'am.

950
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,160
Hello, how are you?

951
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,400
I am good. Who are you?

952
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,000
Didn't you recognise me?

953
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,400
Your son, Nanu

954
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,240
is my friend.

955
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,840
Ma'am, I am feeling ashamed, but..
- What's the matter?

956
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,520
Ma'am, the other day when you
came in the cab,

957
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,440
you went up straight.

958
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,600
Nanu didn't have money
to pay to the cab.

959
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,520
He borrowed Rs 345 from me.

960
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,360
If you can give it to me...

961
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,680
What are you saying?

962
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,520
100, 200, 300...

963
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,800
How much did you say?
- Rs 400.

964
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,240
I mean, Rs 375.

965
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,920
Here is Rs 400.

966
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,920
Thank you, ma'am.

967
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,440
I'll return you the balance amount..
- No problem.

968
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,680
Keep it.
- I will give it to Nanu.

969
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,880
Bless me.
- Thank you for your help.

970
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,280
Gayatri, let's go.
We have to cook food.

971
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,160
Bro, nice shirt.

972
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,640
Give me Rs 200.
I'll return it to you tomorrow.

973
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,800
I will smash your head.

974
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,000
I don't fear you! Hello!

975
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,320
I don't fear you!

976
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,120
You refused to give me money,
wait and see what happens with you.

977
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,440
Whatever happens with you...

978
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,320
You'll be responsible for it.

979
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,600
Mind you,
don't apologise to me later.

980
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,200
Youth is getting spoilt
because of people like you.

981
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,440
We're turning into thieves.

982
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,840
What are you watching,
tell him!

983
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,680
Yes, he's right.
- He's refusing to give me Rs 200.

984
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,880
He's right.

985
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,480
He got scared of me.

986
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,360
Listen to me.

987
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,640
Do you have Rs 100?

988
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,480
How did you come inside?

989
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,160
I had the keys with me.

990
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,120
Did you lock the door
in the morning?

991
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,720
Yes.

992
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,440
It was open.

993
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,320
What if someone
had robbed our house?

994
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,920
Mom, come out.

995
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,360
Leave me.
- Come out with me.

996
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,400
Leave my hand.

997
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,920
Why do you want to go out?

998
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,760
Not just the house,
send me out of this world.

999
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,000
Did I give birth to you

1000
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,800
only for you to throw me
out of the house?

1001
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,200
This is a bad time.

1002
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,000
I will leave this house.

1003
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,880
You don't have to worry,

1004
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,000
your father's pension money
is enough for us to survive.

1005
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,040
We'll manage.

1006
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,760
No, nothing like that.

1007
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,360
Get away, the 'dal' is
getting overcooked.

1008
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,040
Open the door.
The chimney repair man must be here.

1009
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,040
Chimney repair man?

1010
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,920
What is it?
- Did you call to repair the chimney?

1011
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,880
We don't want to get it repaired,
you leave.

1012
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,680
Why don't you want to
get it repaired?

1013
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,360
Please come inside.

1014
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,520
Disgusting.

1015
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,760
Let it be.
It is there.

1016
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,680
Why are you smiling?

1017
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,080
Sir, this is how I look.

1018
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,800
Go and repair the chimney.

1019
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,840
Your face will completely change.

1020
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,240
Have you informed your family
members that you're going to die?

1021
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,240
Sir, actually, I died 12 days ago.

1022
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,120
Don't say such things.

1023
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,560
He's mad.

1024
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,280
What are you telling him?

1025
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,600
No ma'am, not like that.

1026
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,360
Actually, I am in love.

1027
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,560
Falling in love and dying
is the same thing. So...

1028
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,920
Get ruined, who cares?

1029
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,160
Let's see how he repairs it.

1030
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,920
It's done.

1031
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Okay.

1032
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,040
How much do I have to pay? - Actually,
it was still in the warranty period.

1033
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,200
Okay.

1034
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,720
Thank you.

1035
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,880
You lied to me that your father has
met with an accident.

1036
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,560
You misbehaved with
the repair-man.

1037
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,400
Gayatri, explain it to him

1038
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,320
how precious parents are.

1039
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,280
Once they die, they don't return.

1040
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,760
Ma'am, you're right.

1041
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,480
You eat the 'koftas' made by Kumar,

1042
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,080
he's made it soft this time.

1043
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,480
Ma'am, you come...
- Mom.

1044
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,960
Shut up!

1045
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,800
You come with me to the veneration.

1046
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,960
You'll go mad laughing.

1047
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,840
I'm not in mood today.

1048
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,760
I want to change your mood.

1049
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,080
Ma'am, you have to come.

1050
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,920
You know Mrs Nandi.
She will be possessed today.

1051
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:47,800
She enacts exactly
like the Goddess.

1052
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,720
Ma'am, please come,
you’ll enjoy it.

1053
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,920
Okay, I will come for some time.

1054
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,160
Okay ma'am, get ready
in 15 minutes.

1055
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,040
We have to go for the veneration.

1056
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,840
Idiot.

1057
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,280
Dabbu, listen to me.

1058
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:18,880
"You ease our problems and pain."

1059
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:24,760
"Everyone comes to You."

1060
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,160
We'll be punished.

1061
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,440
It's like kidnapping our own mom.

1062
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,800
Forget that. We came as kidnappers,
but they made me a peacock.

1063
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,080
Come on, start.

1064
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,880
Okay, let's go.

1065
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,400
"Hail Goddess."

1066
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,800
"Hail Goddess."

1067
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,560
"I sing Your hymns day and night."

1068
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,240
"My devotion is the mirror
of my identity."

1069
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,680
"I sing Your hymns day and night."

1070
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,760
"My devotion is the mirror
of my identity."

1071
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,640
"I bow my head to You."

1072
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,480
"I get what I want."

1073
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,720
"You'll be blessed if you
worship Goddess."

1074
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,600
"No one can pay you fees."

1075
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,760
"If you have to set things right."

1076
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,600
"If you have to set things right."

1077
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,760
"Write Goddess's name
on your forehead."

1078
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,840
"If you have to set things right."

1079
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,040
"If you have to set things right."

1080
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:57,440
"Write Goddess's name
on your forehead."

1081
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,120
"Hail Goddess!"

1082
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,760
Will you continue to dance
or do some work?

1083
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,320
We're doing wrong.

1084
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,320
Goddess is stopping us.

1085
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,080
I don't know if Goddess is
stopping you or not,

1086
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,640
I will kill you by keeping a pillow
on your mouth.

1087
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,120
How lucky we are,
the door is open.

1088
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,120
What will you do?

1089
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,400
I'll steal.

1090
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,040
He refused to give me Rs 200.

1091
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,360
I will teach him a lesson.

1092
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,800
"Goddess, You answer the prayers
of the devotees."

1093
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,800
"You answer the prayers
of the devotees."

1094
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,560
"You answer the prayers
of the devotees."

1095
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,840
"Whoever visits You often
becomes fortunate."

1096
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,880
"Whoever visits You often
becomes fortunate."

1097
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,600
"Whoever visits You often
becomes fortunate."

1098
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,640
"When they are blessed by You,"

1099
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,440
"Goddess, people reform themselves
when they surrender to You."

1100
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,640
"If you spend your day and night
at Your door,"

1101
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,520
"Your problems
will be solved in a jiffy."

1102
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,600
"If you have to set things right."

1103
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,520
"If you have to set things right."

1104
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,600
"Write Goddess's name
on your forehead."

1105
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,680
"If you have to set things right."

1106
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,800
"If you have to set things right."

1107
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,800
"Write Goddess's name
on your forehead."

1108
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,800
"If you have to set things right."

1109
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,400
Ma'am, listen.

1110
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,800
Your earrings fell down.

1111
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,160
Where?

1112
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,440
Where did my gold earrings fall?

1113
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,840
Nothing to worry.

1114
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,360
Hail Goddess.
- Hello.

1115
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,560
Hello?
- Ma'am, I was joking.

1116
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,560
"If you have to set things right."

1117
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,520
"If you have to set things right."

1118
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,880
"Write Goddess's name
on your forehead."

1119
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,840
Ma'am, please.

1120
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,800
Nanu asked us to kidnap his mother.

1121
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,760
Mom!

1122
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,480
Just check on the electricity.

1123
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,280
Mom! - "Write Goddess's
name on your forehead."

1124
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,240
"Hail Goddess."
- Leave me.

1125
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,360
"Hail Goddess."

1126
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,320
"Hail Goddess."

1127
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,400
"Hail Goddess."

1128
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,400
"Hail Goddess."

1129
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,520
"Hail Goddess."

1130
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,360
"Hail Goddess."

1131
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,480
"Hail Goddess."

1132
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,400
"Hail Goddess."

1133
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,520
"Hail Goddess."

1134
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,400
"Hail Goddess."

1135
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,480
"Hail Goddess."

1136
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,000
"Hail Goddess."

1137
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,880
Mom.

1138
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,080
Mom, you won't understand.

1139
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,840
I understand everything.

1140
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,120
When children grow up,

1141
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,440
they feel parents are boring.

1142
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,680
What do I do,

1143
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,400
I am a mother.

1144
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,640
I will behave like one.

1145
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:05,640
Son, I don't know what you do and
how you maintain this lifestyle.

1146
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,240
But the time is so bad,

1147
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,200
I am scared that
you might get spoilt.

1148
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,840
Get spoilt only as much as

1149
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,000
we can afford.

1150
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,400
Please.

1151
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,520
I've packed the luggage.
Pick it up.

1152
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,520
Such a long hair?

1153
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,720
It can't be mine.

1154
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,480
It must be the ghost's hair.

1155
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,040
Yes.

1156
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,600
What is this?

1157
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,480
Hereafter, we won't earn
by wrong means.

1158
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,600
Dare you come here again!

1159
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,720
Come on, leave. - Give me the money
and take the documents.

1160
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,320
I'll complaint to Mallik sir.
- Shut up.

1161
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,200
To hell with Mallik, get going!

1162
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,600
Hello?

1163
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,480
What?
- What's the matter?

1164
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,720
Get the documents signed from them.
- Okay.

1165
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,000
She's still unconscious.

1166
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,600
What happened?

1167
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,400
Nanu, something strange
happened today.

1168
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,760
Ma'am was...
- Get that girl's father here.

1169
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,320
If something happens to my mom...

1170
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,680
I will set everything on fire.

1171
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,120
Nanu!

1172
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,480
Nanu?

1173
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,000
What happened to you?

1174
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,720
What happened to you?

1175
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,560
Get up.

1176
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,240
Nobody picked you up from the road.

1177
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,480
I took you to the hospital.

1178
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,720
Is it my fault that you died?

1179
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,080
You died today,
but you were a human being earlier.

1180
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,240
Didn't you feel ashamed
hurting my mom?

1181
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,880
If something happens to my mother,

1182
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,480
I swear,

1183
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,960
I will kill your father,

1184
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,480
and then I will kill myself.

1185
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,360
I will meet you in heaven
and teach you a lesson

1186
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,080
or I don't deserve to be
called as Nanu.

1187
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,240
Call out to your lively daughter.

1188
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,000
Come out.

1189
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,920
Show your father how
lively you are.

1190
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,960
Come out or I'll blow his brains.

1191
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,200
The day my daughter died,

1192
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,480
even I died the same day.

1193
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,280
Remove the gun.

1194
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,920
You said

1195
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,960
that you would return soon.

1196
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,680
You said

1197
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,240
that you wanted to
eat Aaloo Paratha.

1198
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,760
You said it, didn't you?

1199
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,600
I made Aaloo Paratha.

1200
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,440
Yes, I made Aaloo Paratha.

1201
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,120
You just had to get

1202
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,960
yogurt while returning.

1203
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,200
'A life without self-respect
and Paratha without yogurt,'

1204
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,840
'it doesn't look good. I'll get it.
- Okay, go and get it soon.'

1205
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,400
How can anyone

1206
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,320
call you a ghost?

1207
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,000
Stop, my child!

1208
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,120
Come to me, my child.

1209
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,280
Come to me.

1210
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,600
Siddhi,

1211
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,720
why are you troubling them?

1212
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,480
Let's go.

1213
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,840
Let's go from here.

1214
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,160
Come on, let's go home.

1215
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:27,280
Dear, they are not at fault.

1216
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,400
He even took you to the hospital,
right?

1217
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,680
Siddhi, come on, let's go home.

1218
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,240
Listen. Dear, don't go there.

1219
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,920
Let's go home.

1220
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,120
I bind you with my oath, come on.

1221
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,760
No, listen.

1222
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,400
Oh no.

1223
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,800
God, why have You done this
to my daughter?

1224
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,560
My child went away...

1225
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,160
Siddhi...

1226
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:07,040
Siddhi, why are you
running away from me?

1227
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,040
Come to me.

1228
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,120
Come to me, my child.

1229
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,240
Let's go home.

1230
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,000
Listen,

1231
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,520
once I come know

1232
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,600
who brought you to this condition,

1233
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,120
I will kill him.

1234
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,960
Siddhi!

1235
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,840
I used to always joke,

1236
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,400
I'll buy a groom for you.

1237
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,800
She would say...

1238
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,440
'If I get a nice guy,
I'll go straight to his house.'

1239
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,160
'Bye, Dad.'

1240
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,760
'Dad, the day I fall in love,'

1241
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,720
'I'll go to his house straight.'

1242
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,680
She loves you.

1243
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,480
Yes. - 'Nanu, ma'am has
regained her senses.'

1244
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,480
'She's out of danger now.'

1245
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,800
Thank you.

1246
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,760
Sir,

1247
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,040
perform prayers for her soul
to rest in peace.

1248
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,560
Dabbu, drop him home.

1249
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,480
If you love me

1250
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,640
why did you hurt my mother?

1251
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,480
Nanu,

1252
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,440
my husband...

1253
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,000
'Eat this.
- Why?'

1254
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,360
'I'm asking you to eat it.'

1255
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,120
'No!
- Do you call this as food?'

1256
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,440
'Please.
- Why didn't you taste it?'

1257
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,080
'Why didn't you taste it?
keep your hands down.

1258
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,760
- Next time, I'll taste.'

1259
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,360
'Wipe your tears.'

1260
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,880
'Hello ma'am, how are you?'

1261
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,160
'How are you?'

1262
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,360
'Come here.'

1263
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,360
'Ma'am, come inside.'

1264
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,320
'You come along with me.'

1265
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,000
'Ma'am, please do your work.'

1266
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,760
'If you keep tolerating he will
continue to beat you.'

1267
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,880
'How long will you
tolerate this beast?'

1268
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,800
'Come with me, let's lodge
a complaint against him.'

1269
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,880
'Come on.
- Ma'am, you do your work.'

1270
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,240
'Leave her hand. Come with me.
- You mind your own business.'

1271
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,920
'Come with me.
Let's lodge a complaint. - Ma'am!'

1272
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,280
'One moment.
- Hey!'

1273
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,560
'You go inside.'

1274
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,760
'I told you not to interfere
in our lives.'

1275
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,760
'Come with me.
- Go away!'

1276
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,240
'Ma'am...
- Get inside.'

1277
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,880
'Don't tell anyone I hit her.'

1278
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,520
'Or I'll teach you a lesson.'

1279
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,040
'Get inside.'

1280
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,280
'What happened?'

1281
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,360
'What is it?'

1282
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,040
'Ma'am?'

1283
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,000
'Listen, look what has
happened to ma'am.'

1284
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:23,680
'Ma'am.'

1285
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,520
'Ma'am.
- Hello, Nanu.'

1286
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,160
'What happened?'

1287
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,240
'What is it?'

1288
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,960
'What is it?'

1289
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,880
'What is it?'

1290
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,040
'Who is it?'

1291
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,680
'Who is it?'

1292
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,720
'Who is this girl?'

1293
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,480
'Who is it?'

1294
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,200
'I am sorry.'

1295
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,640
'I am sorry,
I won't hit her again.'

1296
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,680
'I am sorry.'

1297
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,200
Nanu, forgive me.

1298
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,080
I don't know who hit me.

1299
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,760
Please don't hit him,
I'll explain it to him.

1300
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,360
Slap him.
- What?

1301
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,080
I?
- Slap him.

1302
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,240
Or I'll shoot him.

1303
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,280
Give him a tight slap.

1304
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,160
Harder.

1305
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:15,960
I am sorry.

1306
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,600
I am sorry.

1307
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,480
I'm sorry.

1308
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:53,560
And thank you.

1309
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,360
Mom, stay here for few more days.

1310
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,080
Son, I am happy to hear that.

1311
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,000
Can I ask you something?

1312
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,240
Why did you return that day?

1313
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,320
You had called.

1314
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:17,720
I kept saying hello,
but you didn't reply.

1315
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,400
I came back to slap you.

1316
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,920
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.

1317
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,320
Get married.

1318
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,000
I didn't see that ghost,

1319
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,040
but feels like I met her.

1320
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,560
Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

1321
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,440
No beer.
- No.

1322
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,800
Sir,

1323
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,040
sorry, I hurt you.

1324
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,000
This was

1325
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,680
Siddhi's favourite place.

1326
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,680
She would come here

1327
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,920
and drink Cappuccino.

1328
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,440
She would say...

1329
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,960
She had said,
whoever she falls in love with,

1330
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,360
she'll stick his picture here.

1331
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,400
Sir,

1332
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,120
I will find out the person

1333
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,440
who killed Siddhi.

1334
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,960
I was with your dad today.

1335
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,520
I've bought your favourite cappuccino.

1336
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,040
You like it, don't you?

1337
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,600
I want to tell you

1338
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,360
that you're like an opener
in my life.

1339
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:49,160
Opener. It's a great thing.

1340
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,960
It reminds me of beer.

1341
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,800
When you weren't around,

1342
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,000
beer was my friend.

1343
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,200
Siddhi,

1344
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,240
just as you like cappuccino,
I like to drink beer.

1345
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,640
Okay, I won't drink it.

1346
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,880
But please don't break the bottle.

1347
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,080
I suffer from kidney stone.

1348
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,640
Doctor has instructed me
to drink beer.

1349
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,320
Really?

1350
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,320
Shall I drink it?

1351
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,200
Siddhi,

1352
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,040
either scare me
or fall in love with me.

1353
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,080
I don't fear you now.

1354
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,000
Tell me something,

1355
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,160
why didn't you come earlier
to scare me?

1356
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,320
I was ready to get scared.

1357
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,480
We would've crossed each other

1358
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,840
so many times on the same road.

1359
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,960
We would've even run into each other
a couple of times.

1360
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,920
I am an idiot.

1361
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,800
Why didn't I look at you?

1362
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:42,400
I would've wooed you
in a jiffy.

1363
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,880
Make a deal with God.

1364
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,520
I will handle the rest.

1365
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,680
I can't forget your smile.

1366
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,320
Your smile has turned me
into a human being.

1367
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,240
Just tell me once
who brought you to this state?

1368
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,320
I will kill him!

1369
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:19,400
If I get my hands on him once...

1370
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,800
Cheers.

1371
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:33,800
"I see you,"

1372
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:37,480
"but why can't I meet you?"

1373
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:44,000
"I don't understand"

1374
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:48,160
"how can I explain it to myself?"

1375
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:52,200
"How can I explain it to myself?"

1376
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,840
"Why are my thoughts"

1377
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:01,000
"connected to you?"

1378
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:05,280
"I don't know"

1379
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:09,480
"how we both met."

1380
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:13,680
"I don't know"

1381
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:18,240
"how we both met."

1382
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:20,360
Sir, if Siddhi was alive

1383
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,840
and told you that she loved me,

1384
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,280
you wouldn't have agreed.

1385
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,600
I am a very bad man.

1386
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,400
'Take her to the hospital?'

1387
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,320
'There are many people
standing here.'

1388
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,640
'Why do you want to become great?'

1389
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:46,240
'Sir, I saw a white car
hit her and run.'

1390
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:56,200
How much money did he give you?

1391
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:59,160
I will find him.

1392
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:10,200
"I am cherishing the moments
I spent with you."

1393
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:16,440
"I want to spend my life with you."

1394
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:22,760
"Our love is different."

1395
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,960
"We were destined to meet
each other."

1396
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:34,520
"My life is connected to you."

1397
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,840
"Why do I think..."

1398
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,480
There was a man with me.

1399
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,160
Can I see the CCTV footage?

1400
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,520
Here.

1401
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,680
He's the one.

1402
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,560
Can you please zoom in?

1403
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,840
What happened?

1404
01:42:52,480 --> 01:43:00,560
"I don't know how we both met."

1405
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,200
He was a confectioner. Idiot.

1406
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,080
He ran away without
giving a testimony.

1407
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,760
How did you know
he was a confectioner?

1408
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,680
He said he was frying fritters.
- Okay.

1409
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,480
Let's go there.

1410
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:14,080
We'll go to Siddhi's accident spot.

1411
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,080
There are a few stalls there,
we'll find him.

1412
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:20,280
"I'm finding myself in you."

1413
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:24,480
"I don't know where I am."

1414
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,760
"Why there's restlessness
in my heart?"

1415
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:37,000
"I don't know why I am yearning."

1416
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,640
"My heartbeat..."

1417
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:41,000
Give me the other guy's number.
- One moment, sir.

1418
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:44,200
Sir, I'm standing before
Kashmiri Lal store.

1419
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,520
Come here in five minutes.

1420
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,840
Where are you?

1421
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:58,280
"Why are my thoughts
connected to you?"

1422
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:06,760
"I don't know how we both met."

1423
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:15,400
"I don't know how we both met."

1424
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,000
Sir, leave me.

1425
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,840
Leave me.
- Why did you run?

1426
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,640
Sir, kill me if you want to.

1427
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,960
Since I gave my testimony,
everyone is beating me.

1428
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,720
Sir, the driver killed her,
I gave the testimony,

1429
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,840
police hit me,

1430
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:31,720
they asked me to
change my testimony,

1431
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,760
and so I did it.

1432
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,320
Why are you crying?

1433
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,560
Sir, take it if you want.

1434
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,280
I don't want the complaint.

1435
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,600
Tell me the vehicle number.

1436
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,520
DL8CN...
- Tell me the number!

1437
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,000
DL8C9724.

1438
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:48,200
Sir, let me go. I've already been
thrashed by the police.

1439
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,120
What filling do you use in the
dumplings, lentils or potatoes?

1440
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,120
Fenugreek leaves, sir.
- Okay, leave.

1441
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,600
Yes.

1442
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,280
The vehicle belongs to me.

1443
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,840
But I didn't kill your daughter.

1444
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,480
You're lying.

1445
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,000
Sir, I'm telling the truth.

1446
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,880
Then why did you flee?

1447
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,600
There's an eyewitness.

1448
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,080
I was scared.

1449
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,880
Did a dog chase you?
- Talk to him with respect.

1450
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:27,800
Abdul...

1451
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,720
Look,

1452
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:32,080
Talk with respect. Get it?

1453
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,600
Or he'll make you understand.

1454
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,200
Look, tell me the truth.

1455
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,440
Or this will teach you
how to respect.

1456
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,840
Look,

1457
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,280
I'll hack you to pieces

1458
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,520
and throw it before the dogs.

1459
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,160
You're sitting in my house.

1460
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,920
I'm talking to you calmly.

1461
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,760
Listen to me carefully.

1462
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,120
I fled from the spot,

1463
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,760
but I didn't kill your daughter.

1464
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,640
Then why did you bribe the police?

1465
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:17,160
That idiot confectioner

1466
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:19,720
had become the eyewitness.

1467
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,000
Fathima, come here.

1468
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:28,680
Yes, Dad.

1469
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,840
Sir, she's my daughter.

1470
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,840
I swear by her,

1471
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:39,160
I didn't kill your daughter.

1472
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,280
Okay, go and play.

1473
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,840
I was driving

1474
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:49,600
and the girl had already
fallen down from her scooter.

1475
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:54,560
My only mistake is
that I didn't stop.

1476
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:56,800
Or you can say, I was scared

1477
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,000
because I was in danger.

1478
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,320
What danger?

1479
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,000
I had a lot of goat meat in my car.

1480
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,240
Somebody had given a tip.

1481
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,680
Few guys said it was beef.

1482
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,280
I slapped some of them,

1483
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,560
and was about to leave,
when people started gathering.

1484
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:20,120
I thought I would land
in a big trouble.

1485
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,280
I fled from there.

1486
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:23,880
I had a function at home,

1487
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:26,400
I had to leave for Meerut,
so I left from there.

1488
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,600
I swear by God,

1489
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,080
she met with an accident with
someone else's vehicle.

1490
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,160
My vehicle didn't even touch her.

1491
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:38,560
The girl had already fallen down
when I reached there.

1492
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,040
I could've stopped, but think,

1493
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:44,360
wouldn't I have been in trouble
if I did so?

1494
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,200
Do you understand?

1495
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:01,520
Shall I order some snacks for you?
Will you have food and leave?

1496
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,280
See him off.
- Let's go.

1497
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,200
Nanu.
- Yes.

1498
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,360
I think he's lying.

1499
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,840
I have a doubt on him.

1500
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,280
Why will the confectioner lie?

1501
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,640
My daughter's killer
is very lucky.

1502
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,800
We're not able to find
any clue about him.

1503
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,360
No matter how lucky he is,

1504
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,480
he's done a mistake.

1505
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:01,640
'Sir, I saw a white car
hit her and fled.'

1506
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,400
'He ran into her and fled.'

1507
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:07,120
'The confectioner
had become the eyewitness.'

1508
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,920
'The driver killed her,
I gave the testimony.'

1509
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
'Sir, who killed my daughter?'

1510
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,880
'She met with an accident with
someone else's vehicle.'

1511
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,760
'My vehicle didn't even touch her.'

1512
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,800
'I think he's lying.'

1513
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,680
'Who is the one
who brought you to this state?'

1514
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,760
'I will kill him.'

1515
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,000
'Just tell me once,
who did this to you.'

1516
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,280
'I will kill him!'

1517
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,360
What are you doing?

1518
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,120
Sir, drive properly.

1519
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:39,440
Will you kill the guy behind you
to save the man ahead of you?

1520
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,200
I would've died.

1521
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,960
I don't know where they come from.

1522
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,360
'Will you kill the guy behind you
to save the man ahead of you?'

1523
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,440
'She met with an accident with
someone else's vehicle.'

1524
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,600
'My vehicle didn't even touch her.'

1525
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:39,720
'The girl had already fallen down
when I reached there.'

1526
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,480
Siddhi, what's going on?

1527
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:53,280
Why are you troubling him?

1528
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:58,920
It's not her hatred, but love.

1529
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,760
I love you too, Siddhi.

1530
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:02,600
Siddhi, spare him.

1531
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:04,200
Spare him, please.

1532
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,560
I had told you

1533
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,720
I am a bad man.

1534
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,640
Had your daughter been alive,

1535
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,120
you wouldn't have got her
married to me.

1536
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,720
I was the one who killed
your daughter.

1537
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,800
Everyone knows, but don't believe

1538
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:53,200
that the entire system has
got limited a mobile phone.

1539
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,360
You have to answer it
whenever it rings.

1540
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:01,760
It was just a matter of 2 seconds.

1541
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,000
I snatched your daughter from you
in 2 seconds.

1542
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:14,320
You can do whatever you want.

1543
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:33,880
Dad!

1544
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,040
Dad, I am here.

1545
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,360
My child.
- I am here, Dad.

1546
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:36,080
You wanted me to return, right?
- Siddhi.

1547
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,200
My child.

1548
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,760
My child.

1549
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,400
Please don't cry.

1550
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:00,760
Hi, Nanu.

1551
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,320
Sorry for coming in your life
without prior information.

1552
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,000
Dad,

1553
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,360
I didn't want to go.

1554
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,240
Who would want to leave you
and go?

1555
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,120
My child.

1556
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,920
Don't cry.
But what could I do?

1557
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:21,560
Nanu,

1558
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,440
do you remember that bike rider?

1559
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,480
It was his turn to die.

1560
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:30,840
But his wife was praying for him.

1561
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:33,960
So, his death was postponed

1562
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,720
and I died.

1563
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,760
Idiotic God of death,

1564
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:41,000
He kills someone else instead of
the person who's destined to die.

1565
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,080
Just like our lovely police.

1566
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,120
You were late by 2 seconds,

1567
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,200
but before that,

1568
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:50,440
He decided to act.

1569
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:54,240
Dad, I met Him.

1570
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,080
The God.

1571
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:59,400
He asked me to tell you

1572
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:02,480
that storing my dead body is wrong.

1573
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:05,560
I told Him that

1574
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:07,440
my dad is very stubborn.

1575
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,920
He won't listen to me.

1576
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,600
Then he asked me to
wander like a ghost.

1577
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:12,920
He couldn't help me.

1578
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,840
Then I thought,

1579
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:21,760
while my body is here,
why don't I fall in love with you?

1580
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,080
Nanu, you're a nice man.

1581
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,000
I fell in love with you
when I was alive

1582
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,400
and died instantly.

1583
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,200
This is called love.

1584
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,840
Sorry,

1585
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,400
I troubled you and your friend.

1586
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:42,120
I am sorry.

1587
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:44,440
Dad,

1588
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,520
he's a very good guy.

1589
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,680
Please forgive him.

1590
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,600
Please.

1591
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:55,520
Nanu, you're talking about
2 seconds,

1592
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,160
it would've taken me only
a second to wear a helmet.

1593
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,640
But I didn't want to wear it.

1594
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:02,960
It is a style not to wear helmet.

1595
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:07,040
I wish...

1596
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:12,000
Dad,

1597
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,760
please let me go.

1598
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:16,840
Please.

1599
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,520
Where are you going, my child?

1600
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:35,120
Dad, I want to return to this world.

1601
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,320
I don't want to remain a ghost.

1602
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,840
Please dad, let me go.

1603
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,800
I will stay with mother there.

1604
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,480
I have to wake up
half an hour before

1605
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,280
just to wear this tie.

1606
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,120
It is not easy to be honest.

1607
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:11,240
Don't you think we've become
very honest?

1608
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:13,040
Don't feel bad.

1609
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,160
Honesty is a nice thing.

1610
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,960
Feel it.
- You're right.

1611
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,960
Nanu, you're habitual

1612
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:23,160
of feeling invisible things.

1613
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,520
Did you see that?

1614
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:30,560
Did you see?
There was something there.

1615
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:33,120
I think...

1616
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:36,760
I want to

1617
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,440
drink blood.

1618
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,920
No.

1619
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:46,080
I want to eat kidney.
- No.

1620
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,360
I want to drink blood.

1621
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:49,200
No, kidney.
- Shut up!

1622
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:51,000
Shut up!

1623
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,960
I want salvation.

1624
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,120
Nanu...

1625
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:05,200
You free the souls, right?

1626
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,960
Please,

1627
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:11,720
free our soul too.

1628
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:14,640
Please.
- Free our souls.

1629
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,400
Please.

1630
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,280
"Listen to me carefully."

1631
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:41,080
"This is a story
of a strange ghost."

1632
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,440
"Listen to the story."

1633
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:46,600
"This ghost is after Nanu."

1634
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,520
"She calls him in her bedroom"

1635
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:51,520
"and says,"

1636
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,480
"Nanu, I am your darling."

1637
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:56,520
"Nanu, I am your darling."

1638
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,120
"You're lucky if you're alive.
I don't go home in fear."

1639
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:11,520
"She sings songs of love
and calls me 'darling'."

1640
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,400
"She comes to the bedroom to sleep
and puts lipstick marks on me."

1641
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,280
"I don't sleep in fear.
No chants works out."

1642
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:30,080
"She whispers in my ears."

1643
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:34,280
"Nanu...
- Will you marry me?"

1644
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,400
"The ghost is here, run!"

1645
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,320
"The ghost is here, run!"

1646
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,040
"The ghost is here, run!"

1647
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:51,920
"The ghost is here, run!"

1648
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:56,480
"The ghost is here, run!"

1649
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,400
"The ghost is here, run!"

1650
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:04,720
"Nanu is in the front
and Janu is behind."

1651
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:08,280
"Nanu is in the front
and Janu is behind."

1652
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:11,960
"My blood pressure rises
when she proposes to me."

1653
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:16,040
"The ghost comes from Banyan tree."

1654
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:17,960
"The ghost comes from Banyan tree."

1655
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:19,840
"The ghost comes from Banyan tree."

1656
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:21,840
"The ghost comes from Banyan tree."

1657
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:31,600
"I see ghost everywhere."

1658
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:38,840
"She whistles at me to call me."

1659
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:43,400
"She makes me do weird things.
Come, come, baby."

1660
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,320
"She makes me work."

1661
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:47,000
"She makes me work."

1662
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:50,520
"Nanu, I am your darling."

1663
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:57,160
"The ghost is here, run!"

1664
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:00,600
"The ghost is here, run!"

1665
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,920
"The ghost is here, run!"
