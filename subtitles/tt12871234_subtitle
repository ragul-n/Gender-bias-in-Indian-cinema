1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,880
Jalwa is now being relaunched.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
A new TVC was being created...

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,640
and Sheila was hired for it.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
Sheila was signed up with
Juice Talent Agency.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,560
Juice? KK?

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,520
This girl is missing. - She must
be having a fling with someone.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
New Jalwa gives women confidence.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,680
Chest pains, respiratory issues.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,720
I have a rare type of cancer.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Mesothelioma is almost always caused
by exposure to asbestos...

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,280
which is a known carcinogen.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,840
I found Mehak.
She lives in a girls' hostel.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,840
It's been 8 years?

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,280
I pushed her to go to those parties.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,520
What parties?

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
All men wear masks there...

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,080
to hide their identity.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
There is only one way
to find Sheila.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
One of us has to go to the party.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Sorry, sir.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,840
It's fine.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,080
Give me your number.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,160
I dug out more cases
of missing girls.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,120
None were ever solved.

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,120
No, no, no!

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,920
Hey! Stop! Stop!
- The people behind this...

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,600
are much more powerful and
dangerous than all of you.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Boss, help us.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,080
Bring Zubaida back.

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,080
"I am a witch."

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,440
"My eyes cast black magic."

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,200
"I wander in the darkness of night."

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,240
"My aura will instil fear in you."

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,040
"Witch.
- It's my reincarnation."

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
"Witch.
- It's the end of your story."

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,320
'CHURAILS'

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,880
8. OBEDIENCE...

38
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,920
Anything?

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Nothing on the girl.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
But your boys were taken
to the Mauripur station.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,400
Gather your team and bring them
to me for questioning.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,200
But...
- Enough now!

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Now do as I say.

44
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Sara!

45
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,720
What a lovely surprise!

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Come on in.

47
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
I've made pancakes.

48
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,200
It was Sunday, so I thought...
- Shumaila...

49
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,600
Pancakes?
- No. No pancakes.

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,000
Where's KK?
- Morning jog.

51
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Such a health freak.

52
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
I'm making these,
but he's never gonna eat them.

53
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,680
I need to talk to him. I...

54
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,360
KK is not what he appears to be.

55
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,040
Are you alright?

56
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,680
You seem a little on edge.

57
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
I can get you a xanie or something?
- Hear me out!

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
KK is running an escort agency
through Juice Talent.

59
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,280
Some girls,
that I know, are missing.

60
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,440
And I know that KK is involved.

61
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,080
You know,
whenever I see Jamil at an event...

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,640
I tell him straight.

63
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,480
Sara needs to start working again.

64
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,560
Being just a housewife was
never meant for you.

65
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,880
That store with 'abayas'...

66
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,640
cheap, feminist vigilantism.

67
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,240
Now this backlash.

68
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
It breaks my heart to see
you losing your mind.

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm not losing my mind!

70
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,080
Your husband...

71
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,920
Hey! What brings you here?

72
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
I'd give you a hug,
but I'm sweaty... - Where's Zubaida?

73
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,200
Who?
- Do not fuck with me, KK.

74
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
Who do you think you are?

75
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,760
You're going to stand in my house
and threaten my husband?

76
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,720
KK was with me last night.

77
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,920
We FaceTimed Adeel,
had dinner, watched a movie.

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,760
I don't know what you're
going on about...

79
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,720
but don't involve my husband in it.

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,360
When did I say anything
about last night?

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,200
It's women like you...

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,840
Man-hating, frigid lesbos...

83
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
that give the rest of us a bad name.

84
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Get out!

85
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm sorry.
I didn't think she would come here.

86
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,360
It's alright.

87
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,040
You'll look after your wife
and your son, won't you?

88
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,920
Of course.

89
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Good.

90
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,560
Eat your pancakes.

91
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,600
I don't really want...
- Eat your fucking pancakes!

92
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,400
She thought of you as her mother,
and you lost her too.

93
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,640
All of you can go to hell!

94
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
Take us to your station...

95
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,600
For questioning.

96
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
I'll question you like...

97
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,720
I... You...

98
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,320
I... You...

99
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
What?

100
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
It should seem genuine.

101
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,600
Like it's supposed to be.

102
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,160
Hey, sweety.

103
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,360
Hey. You're alright?

104
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Jugnu, they took everything.

105
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
The deal memos...

106
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,520
the stuff on Sherry and Jalwa.

107
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,640
Dude, all that hard work.

108
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Don't worry.

109
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
We'll find another way.

110
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,240
Don't worry about this.
- Fuck!

111
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Okay?

112
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,440
Jesus,
where have you been all night?

113
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,560
You weren't answering
any of my calls.

114
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,840
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened at mummy's.

115
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,960
It'll never happen again.

116
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,600
I was just mad.

117
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,240
You mean the world to me.

118
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,160
It wasn't meant to be like this.

119
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,960
I kept making mistakes and...

120
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
now it's all coming to an end.

121
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,800
I wanted to be something.

122
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,800
Someone.

123
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,360
Babe, you're not making any sense.
- Are we both exactly the same?

124
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,080
Selfish. Absorbed.

125
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,600
I shouldn't have let her go.
I shouldn't...

126
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh God!

127
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,880
Your gun!

128
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,320
I took your gun a while back and
gave it to one of my girls...

129
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,040
and now the girl's missing!

130
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
What?

131
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,520
And obviously...

132
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,840
the gun is registered in your name.
- Hey!

133
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,640
Listen, breathe! - If it ends
up in the wrong hands then...

134
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,120
I love you.

135
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,280
And I'm sorry for everything
I've put you through.

136
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,320
You felt incomplete
and I never saw it.

137
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
So please, now let me be here.

138
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,480
Whatever it is...

139
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
just...

140
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
Just tell me. Tell me everything.

141
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
We didn't stop working.

142
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
I mean, we weren't taking new cases.

143
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,320
But we kept searching for Sheila.
And now...

144
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,080
Zubaida who used to work with
me has been kidnapped.

145
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,560
Any ideas? Any leads?
- No. Maybe!

146
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
There are these parties. This...

147
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,480
Some kind of a prostitution ring.

148
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,960
There are skincare products.

149
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Cream, powder...
There's something in it.

150
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
I have sent it for testing.

151
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,920
Jamil...

152
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,360
I think KK is behind all this.

153
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
What?

154
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,160
I went to meet him.

155
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,560
Sara!

156
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,400
If KK is behind this,
you shouldn't have confronted him.

157
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,800
I know.

158
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,840
I didn't know what to do.

159
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
Okay.

160
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,280
I'll make an arrangement to shift
all of you to a safe house.

161
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,520
The kids can be with mummy
and I'll cancel my trip.

162
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,360
No! No, you can't.

163
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,240
This summit is really
important to you.

164
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Please, let me figure it out.

165
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,080
We need someone at the safehouse
to look after all of you.

166
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
{ an3}Hello?

167
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
Okay, I'll be there.

168
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,800
You're not going anywhere.

169
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,080
I just have to go to the station,
for questioning.

170
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,080
The police is going to help us.

171
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,960
Fine, I'll take you.

172
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
I'll wait for you there.

173
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
{ an3}Jamil.

174
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,760
Thank you.

175
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,760
You can't lose your shit!

176
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
I can't lose my shit!

177
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,440
Your father.

178
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
Corruption.

179
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
Embezzlement.

180
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,960
Sometimes,
the crime bug is in the blood.

181
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,680
It could be.

182
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
I've been sitting here
for an hour...

183
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,400
thinking of doing something criminal
to you... - Hey, behave.

184
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
Behave yourself.

185
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,400
Does it turn you on?

186
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
When you ask a woman to behave?

187
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,880
Be good, fucking girl! Behave!

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
Oh, behave! Or I'll lock you up.
- That's it. Enough!

189
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,840
You bad, bad, bad girl!

190
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,800
Does this turn you on?
Because I could dial it up.

191
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,440
Totally, totally dial it up!

192
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,880
Be really, really, really bad!

193
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
Do you want me to be really bad?

194
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
How was it?

195
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
I didn't say shit.

196
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,360
There's no use doing all this.

197
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,320
It's just a waste of time. It won't
bring Zubaida back. Or Sheila.

198
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
They're gone.

199
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,800
They're fucking gone.

200
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,320
Jugs...

201
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
{ an3}Jugnu!

202
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
{ an3}Jugnu!

203
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
What the fuck is going on with Sara?

204
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Dude!

205
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,800
You're the husband.

206
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,120
She's the wife.
I'm nobody in that equation.

207
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,400
And this nobody needs a
stiff one right now.

208
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,800
And you ain't that.

209
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,680
My wife is losing her mind.

210
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,080
And I can bet my ass,
this is all your doing.

211
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

212
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
It's all my doing!

213
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,840
Whatever floats your boat, Jamil.

214
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,120
It's disgusting to see how
disrespectful you are.

215
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,280
How's it going at the station?

216
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Useless.

217
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,880
It's Sara's turn.

218
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,960
Shams is right.

219
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,840
I should have protected Zubaida.

220
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,360
But I let her go.

221
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,400
Just like I let Mehak go.

222
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,120
She has a baby.

223
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,960
Mehak does.

224
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,720
I'm sure she turned out to be
a better mother than me.

225
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,760
Hey, oppressed woman...

226
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,680
I had the abortion...

227
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,120
of my own free will.

228
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
Now that I think about it...

229
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,720
There was no solid reason.

230
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,960
But it was my right, so I did.

231
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,720
But that's not the point.

232
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,960
The point is...

233
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
I understand pain too.

234
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,080
The wounds that fester inside you...

235
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,720
I have them too.

236
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,440
We're probably fucked for life!

237
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,320
But that doesn't mean that...

238
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,080
We constantly chase that place
where there is no pain.

239
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Phoolan, I won't drink today.

240
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,400
I promise.

241
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,760
But you also promise, that you
won't go to the loo, and do...

242
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,800
what I think you're going to do.

243
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,720
We'll do this together.

244
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,760
One day at a time.

245
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,680
Fine!

246
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,960
But I was just going to pee.

247
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,720
Yeah.

248
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,760
That you can do.

249
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,200
'Hello, White Rose Beauty Parlour.'

250
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,640
Hello.
I wanted to book an appointment.

251
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,080
'For what?'

252
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
A facial?

253
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,120
'We're fully booked for now, madam.
Goodbye.'

254
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,280
{ an3}Hello?

255
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,920
Okay.

256
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
White Rose...

257
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,640
Hey, girl!
- Hey!

258
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
As good as new?

259
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
I won't say that. - I mean,
the doctor said... - Excellent!

260
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Track this number. It's not listed.

261
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Jugnu, we have to go to the station.

262
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,240
The interrogation...
- I'll take you both there.

263
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,360
Come on, do your geek thing, it's
just gonna take a minute.

264
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,240
Are you serious?

265
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,560
And what the hell is
going on with you?

266
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,960
Well, we still have work to do.

267
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,600
Saleema!

268
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Saleema!

269
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,440
You forgot to lock the door again.

270
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,480
Sorry, madam. The parlour is closed.

271
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Madam, you have to leave.

272
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,720
Saleema,
why didn't you lock the door?

273
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,160
What's happening up there?

274
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,640
Madam, that's private.

275
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,920
Hold on,
hold on, you can't go up there.

276
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay. Alright.

277
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,200
Leave, madam.

278
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,880
Out.

279
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
How many times do I've to ask!
Leave!

280
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,240
The fuck!

281
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,520
Hello, Dilbar.

282
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,520
How is this possible?

283
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,680
They're covering something up,
for sure.

284
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,440
There has to be a weak link there.
Find it!

285
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,320
I'll handle it, boss.

286
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,240
Sir, I've grilled each
and every one of them.

287
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,520
You can check it out yourself.

288
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,600
If whatever they're
saying is true...

289
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,080
then we've to figure it out,
before them.

290
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,120
Or it'll be an embarrassment
for the entire department.

291
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Alright.

292
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
But if you don't bring me any
concrete proof this time...

293
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,080
this has to end here.

294
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,960
Okay, sir.

295
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,960
Your anger and hatred towards me...

296
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
is all justified.

297
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,080
But please...

298
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,840
Let's keep that aside for now.

299
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,760
I'll be waiting downstairs.

300
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Come.

301
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,600
I get a call to take the night off.

302
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,040
So I take the night off.

303
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,920
I report for duty, the next morning.

304
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,280
Who calls you?
- My boss does.

305
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,600
All the watchmen in this
area are given leave.

306
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,360
They bring their own security
for the night.

307
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,960
Then there is music and dancing
and God knows what all.

308
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Boss...

309
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,880
Boss, it's all locked up.

310
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,560
Let's check on the other side.
- Huh?

311
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,840
Boss, love makes one blind.

312
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,920
Take me for example.

313
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,160
I fell for my wife so badly...

314
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,880
that I agreed to live
with her family.

315
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,960
Now when I clean her father's
shit everyday, I realise...

316
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,760
that I shot myself in the foot.

317
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,480
What the fuck are you on about,
asshole?

318
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
Boss...

319
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,680
Your love for Batool might
make you shoot your...

320
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,120
Sorry, boss.

321
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,880
I was just saying.

322
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,680
It just came out.
- Look ahead!

323
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,200
I didn't make the decision
this time.

324
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,080
Yet you think I am to be blamed.

325
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Yes.

326
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,680
But I'm also to be blamed.
All of us are.

327
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,760
When we started out, I believed
in everything that you said.

328
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,200
Maybe you won't understand...

329
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,680
but one way or the other,
we all lost our way.

330
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Sara, ma'am!

331
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,080
'The Thrilla in Manila!'

332
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
Oh shit!

333
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,760
'Muhammad Ali! Ali!'

334
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
1975.

335
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,320
Ali and Frazier had three matches.

336
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,160
This was the last fight.

337
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,240
Ali started off strong but...

338
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,760
Began to lose steam early.

339
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,280
Frazier came after him
so fucking hard...

340
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,240
that even before the second
round was over...

341
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,360
Ali was completely screwed.

342
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
You... Why don't you just tell us?

343
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,680
Speak up and save yourself...

344
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,000
or you'll be stuck in here.

345
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,640
Wanna fight?

346
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,400
Huh?

347
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,160
Wanna have a boxing match with me?

348
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,240
If you win, I'll tell you everything.
- Have you lost your mind?

349
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,600
You little coward!

350
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
Who are you calling a coward, huh?

351
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,960
You've seen one match,
so fucking what?

352
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,040
Just say yes...

353
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,200
then watch me rip your balls off,
and hand them to you.

354
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
It belongs to that girl.

355
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
Found it washed up by the beach hut.

356
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,880
The hut is in Khawar
Koreishi's name.

357
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,120
An earring...

358
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,040
found on the beach.

359
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,720
We can send it for forensics.

360
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,200
And if the magistrate gives
a warrant... - No way!

361
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,120
No more of this!

362
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,080
It's over.

363
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,840
I will suspend you.

364
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
Leave this with me.

365
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,160
Wait, wait, wait!

366
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,120
I won't do anything. Look.

367
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,160
I won't do anything,
don't be scared.

368
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
Listen.

369
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,080
Some women are in trouble.

370
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,800
If you don't help me,
I cannot help them.

371
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,440
Life rarely gives us a chance
to set something right.

372
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,080
This is your chance.

373
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,080
Take it.

374
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,520
The call came this morning.

375
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,720
A forged report was sent in,
and the original report...

376
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
was deleted from the system.

377
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,880
What was in the original report?

378
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,120
Hydroquinone...

379
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,400
paraben...

380
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,600
mercury...

381
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,640
asbestos and white lead.

382
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,480
Okay. Pigmentation issues,
kidney and corneal damage...

383
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
lead poisoning and...

384
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
Of course, increased risk of cancer.

385
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,960
And I've only just scratched
the surface.

386
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,840
I took a picture of the
original report.

387
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,920
If that's of any help...

388
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Thank you, Ali.

389
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,560
But you're comfortable with us
making this information public?

390
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,840
You'll probably get fired.

391
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
All her life, my mother...

392
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,280
was shamed by my father's family...

393
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,960
For her dark complexion.

394
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,200
So I have no issue.

395
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,040
Dilbar,
send a picture of this report to me.

396
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,560
We should send this to a news
channel? - No, no, no...

397
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,080
we don't go public with this.

398
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,640
We use this information as leverage
to get Zubaida back.

399
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,440
Yeah, but we know that Juice
and Jalwa are connected.

400
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,560
If we take that to KK, that's
enough... - But KK's too smart.

401
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,560
He knows that there's
no guarantee that...

402
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,880
even if he let's Zubaida go...

403
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,080
we won't use this information
anyway?

404
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,640
No.

405
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,680
We've to reach out to the weak link.

406
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Sherry!

407
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Yeah.
- Of course.

408
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm so sorry.

409
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,080
Are you okay?

410
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,720
Hello, hello!

411
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
Hello, uncle.

412
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,280
Here you are.
- Here I am...

413
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,400
to clean up your mess as usual.

414
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,760
You girls... I mean, seriously!

415
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,760
Jamil had to go to Islamabad.

416
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,960
So he's asked Ifti to look after us.

417
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,280
Lovely.

418
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm here, only to make sure
that you're all set...

419
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,040
and the security is airtight.

420
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,360
No need for that.

421
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,080
Thank you so much, Ifti. Really.

422
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,600
No need?

423
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,200
Didn't two girls just disappear
from right under your nose?

424
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,480
Aren't the rest of you in danger?

425
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,400
I thought you'd more
sense than this.

426
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
{ an3}You...

427
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,880
Be the man here.

428
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Make these women understand.

429
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,720
I've given strict orders to the
guards but you also keep watch.

430
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
But Zubaida...
- I'll handle that.

431
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,200
I'll have these distributed.

432
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,920
Uncle, this is ridiculous!
I've to go, I've work to do.

433
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
Not possible, sweetheart!

434
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,520
I have to go, dude.

435
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,320
Any leads? I'll come along.
- Guys, no!

436
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,360
We have to lay low.

437
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,440
How many cameras are
installed outside?

438
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,840
There are cameras everywhere...

439
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,520
Except a blind spot at the back.

440
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Here you go.

441
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Biscuit?

442
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,160
I'll come too.

443
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,640
I'm only going to meet Sherry.

444
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,480
Flyers are being distributed.

445
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
You stay here and help Laila, okay?

446
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,880
Do your tech thing.
Find something useful.

447
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,080
You guys are our real heroes.

448
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,120
Yes, we are here for your safety.

449
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Yes.
- Okay.

450
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,600
Day and night, at your service.
- Let's take a selfie!

451
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,040
Yes, that'll be nice.
- That's a good idea.

452
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,800
Everyone, smile now.

453
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,840
And show the tea and biscuits!

454
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,840
Easy, easy, easy!

455
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
{ an3}Shoes!

456
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
Oye, my stilettos!

457
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,880
Yes! Thank you.

458
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,680
Thank you.

459
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,240
Listen, Dilbar.

460
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm really sorry.

461
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,960
About that night, at the restaurant.

462
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,760
It got weird.

463
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,520
It was my fault, boss.

464
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
We're from two different worlds.

465
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,360
It's not about the worlds.

466
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,120
It's about my thinking.

467
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,920
My thinking doesn't allow me
to be anything beyond...

468
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,240
anything different...

469
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
from what I've always been.

470
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,000
Did that make any sense?

471
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,000
Not one bit.

472
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,160
Okay, ten minutes, yeah.
- Okay.

473
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,160
'Hydroquinone, paraben,'

474
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,080
'mercury, asbestos, and white lead.'

475
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,960
All our products are tested.

476
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,480
{ an3}But...

477
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,800
I'll look into this again.
- White lead.

478
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,640
White fucking lead?

479
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm just management.

480
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,360
You're the CEO, Sherry.

481
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,600
Exactly!

482
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,080
Management.

483
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,160
I was there once, where you are now.

484
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,320
This cut-throat ambition,
this greed...

485
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
It's often necessary.

486
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
But if it blinds you to
the extent that...

487
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,400
you can't tell right from wrong...

488
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
that you can't fathom a world
beyond yourself...

489
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,120
then, that's a problem, Sherry.

490
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,920
Listen, dear.

491
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,800
When you, with that silver spoon
dangling from your mouth...

492
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,160
were busy flirting with cute boys
in your Ivy League school...

493
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,440
I was here...

494
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,400
with a man twice my age...

495
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,480
giving him hand jobs twice a day...

496
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,280
every day, for one month straight.

497
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,320
That's what it took to
step into this salon.

498
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,440
Time went by...

499
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,480
and I gave all sorts of jobs...

500
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
To become a receptionist.

501
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,840
Then I became a stylist.

502
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,720
Finally,
I became that same man's wife.

503
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,920
Yes. Yes, I had a choice.

504
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,960
Either I was to play their game,
their way.

505
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,400
Or I was to pack my bags,
and return to Gujranwala.

506
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,640
And no way in hell,
was I ever going back to Gujranwala.

507
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,600
Hence...

508
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,640
Threaten me all you want.

509
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,920
Scare me all you want.

510
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,120
But I swear on that
first hand job...

511
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,080
you won't be able to take me down.

512
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,440
Look closer home.

513
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,080
They're fond of showing off.

514
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,320
They keep the trophies real close...

515
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,480
so shouldn't be that hard to find.

516
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,920
They're fine.
They're at your mother's.

517
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,640
Jamil, still no news on Zubaida.

518
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,720
I can't do this anymore.

519
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,680
I feel paralyzed.

520
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,680
I can't make decisions.

521
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,800
Please come back soon.

522
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,600
I need you.

523
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,040
Not as easy as you thought!

524
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,800
You're shitting yourself, right?
Not even moving!

525
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
What happened?

526
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Get off!

527
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
{ an3}Bitch!

528
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,960
You having fun now?

529
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Done?

530
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,760
Boss?

531
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,280
Are you alright?

532
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,720
2011.

533
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,400
We need records from 2011.

534
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
Nothing will come out of this.

535
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,840
I don't trust anyone.

536
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,520
I'm sitting here like a dickhead,
and some motherfucker out there...

537
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,640
What do you make of all of this?

538
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,120
And what secret mission are you on?

539
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,640
Me?

540
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,360
I thought,
if we spread the word online...

541
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,960
there might be more public traction.

542
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,080
What's that?

543
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Nothing.

544
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,480
Okay, I know you're worried...

545
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,440
and our focus should be on
Sheila and Zubaida. But...

546
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,360
The inspector said that there are
more cases of missing girls.

547
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
I wondered if some of them were
linked to the talent agency.

548
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,800
I used 'wayback', Shams.

549
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,960
I scanned decade-old
archived web pages.

550
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,440
I checked cached versions.
- And?

551
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,360
This is...
- Mehak.

552
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
Batool's daughter was with Juice?

553
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,480
2011, 2011!
- Thank you.

554
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,240
Boss, we've found 2011.
Let's get out now!

555
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,360
Hold on!

556
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,040
So this is called rope-a-dope.

557
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,600
Frazier thought that he'll win.

558
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,240
But then Ali...

559
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,960
Knocked him out!

560
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,080
They called and said they'll
take the girl on Friday.

561
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,680
Then what?

562
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,640
Then what do you think, asswipe?

563
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,160
I don't know where I am.

564
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,520
There's a factory.

565
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,880
That is a huge warehouse.

566
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,400
That...

567
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,760
Over there is a small warehouse
where I was held captive.

568
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,240
There are lots of men here.

569
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,520
And they all have guns.

570
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
I don't even know if this message
will go through or not.

571
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,040
{ an3}Chotu!

572
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,680
Open the door, bro!

573
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,640
Open the door, Chotu!

574
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,560
Open up, you cocksucker!
What are you doing in there!

575
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,400
What the fuck is he doing?
- God knows.

576
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,600
Motherfucker,
what are you doing with the girl?

577
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,440
You son of a bitch,
if you rape her...

578
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,840
I'll cut your balls off and
make you chew on them!

579
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
Go and check.

580
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,160
Try and open it! Go on!

581
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,160
You fuck, open it properly!

582
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,360
Come on!

583
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,240
Oh fuck!

584
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,560
Bro! Bro, the girl has escaped.

585
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Escaped.

586
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,240
Get the jeep, motherfuckers!
Get the fucking jeep!

587
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,440
Let's go!

588
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,880
Come on, Mehak. Mehak.

589
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,880
Batool Jaan.

590
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,080
7-1-8-2-3-5-0.

591
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,680
High risk.

592
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,080
'GUARDIAN PRESENT GUARDIAN'S
PHONE NUMBER'

593
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,440
Run the plate.

594
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,280
{ an3}B-F...

595
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,200
Yes?
- 9-7.

596
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,720
Hmm.
- 5-0.

597
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,040
Boss.

598
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,720
It's registered under this name.

599
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,920
Do you know him?

600
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,280
I have a lead in Mehak's case.

601
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,280
Trace this number immediately.
0-3-0-1-2-5-1-1-3-1-5.

602
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,760
I've got an ID number.

603
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,080
Hold on.

604
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,840
This ID number...

605
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,640
It doesn't make any sense.

606
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,480
Spit it fucking out, Laila!

607
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,840
{ an3}It...

608
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,720
It's your uncle.

609
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,240
Iftikhar Chaudhry.

610
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,520
What...

611
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,840
She almost ran away.

612
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,400
I have 20 men there...

613
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,400
and one girl,
right under their noses...

614
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,160
What was the need to keep her alive?

615
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,920
We could have used her as leverage.

616
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,960
Figure out how much those women
know. What their next move is!

617
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,520
I'm really disappointed in you, KK.

618
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,640
A random girl comes
to your agency...

619
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,960
and you take her to the event!

620
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,600
I mean, what were you thinking?

621
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
I did all the background checks.

622
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,800
I'm very thorough.

623
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,480
You know that.
- And yet, here I am...

624
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,440
cleaning up your shit
all over again.

625
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,520
Sheila was out of control.

626
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,520
She wouldn't listen...
- I'm not talking about Sheila.

627
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,080
That was not me.

628
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,640
I know we don't talk about that one.

629
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,200
But that wasn't my fault.

630
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,720
No matter whose fault it was...

631
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,400
it doesn't change the fact that
at the end of the day...

632
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,720
it was me dragging her pregnant
ass to White Rose!

633
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,320
'The signs were all around us,
and yet...'

634
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,960
'We kept wandering in
the wilderness.'

635
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,720
'We didn't hear the screams...'

636
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,920
'And we didn't see the blood.'

637
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,080
'A lifetime spent,'

638
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,120
'finding our way to this
slaughterhouse.'

639
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,400
Zubaida...

640
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,080
She's on you.

641
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,960
Shumaila won't give me permission
for one more.

642
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,920
We'll have to figure something
else out... - KK...

643
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,080
This one will be yours.
