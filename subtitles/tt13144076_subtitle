1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,500
.

2
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,460
Hello?

3
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,300
I was just jogging, sir.

4
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,340
I'm at home, sir.

5
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,500
What happened?

6
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,060
I'm leaving.

7
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,300
Right now.

8
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,140
Sangram, seal the main gate.

9
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,580
Make sure nobody leaves.

10
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,460
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,580
Yes, tell me.

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,380
Where did he come from?

13
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Sir, you're here?

14
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,020
Has the investigation started?

15
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,300
I was just about to start, sir.

16
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
Listen.

17
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,260
You let it be.

18
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,020
I'm taking this case.

19
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,460
This case comes under my area, sir.

20
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
Didn't you hear me?

21
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,180
I said, I'm taking this case.

22
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,380
If I need you, I'll call.

23
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,340
Till then, relax.

24
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,140
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,380
Remove this barrier.

26
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,860
Nobody needs to know what's going on.

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,980
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,980
Did you inform the forensics team?

29
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,860
I kept calling, they're not picking up.

30
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,940
I've sent a constable.

31
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,460
As soon as they come,

32
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,980
...tell me immediately.

33
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,340
Remove the barrier!

34
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,460
Not a single person...

35
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,180
...or news should get out of here.

36
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,140
- Got it?
- Yes sir.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,700
Yes?

38
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,060
Sir, I am Shrikant Awasthi.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,140
The general manager.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,660
Shall we?

41
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,700
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,660
So tell me, what happened exactly?

43
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,180
As you must have heard,

44
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,340
...we had a huge party the hotel this evening.

45
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,580
The music, dancing and cocktails were on...

46
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,820
...since the evening.

47
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,220
A lot of guests from Mumbai are here.

48
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,060
Vani Chopra's guests.

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,780
Then, the engagement ceremony happened around 9 PM.

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,780
Both of them were so happy.

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,620
All the guests as well.

52
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,420
There was laughter, happiness and a good mood.

53
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,140
Everything was going great.

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,340
Then, around 12 AM...

55
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,420
...the party ended and then...

56
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,540
...around 1 PM, we suddenly found out that.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
This is the suite, sir.

58
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,420
The girl was murdered brutally.

59
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,620
It's here.

60
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,420
Does anybody else know about this?

61
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,700
No, sir. I just informed the police.

62
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,500
I meant, other than the police.

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,420
No, sir.

64
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,100
Now, listen.

65
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,860
There's alcohol kept...

66
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,540
...in my car.

67
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,180
Go get it.

68
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,700
From your car? I'll get one from the hotel.

69
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,140
Listen, just do whatever...

70
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,340
...you're told.

71
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,780
I'll just get it.

72
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
I found it.

73
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,100
There's a garden set up here.

74
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,420
Excuse me, sir.

75
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,900
Where are you barging in?

76
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,020
It's a crime scene! Wait outside!

77
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,580
Awasthi sir sent this.

78
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,900
What did I say?

79
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,300
Shove this up Awasthi's ass and get out!

80
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,340
It's a crime scene!

81
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,540
Show me the list of who was...

82
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,180
...staying in which room.

83
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,540
Did that forensic team wake up?

84
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,980
Call them.

85
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,900
And...

86
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,220
...Gehlot as well.

87
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,500
Did the forensic team die too?

88
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,100
Will they come for the funeral?

89
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,740
Yes, I've done everything that...

90
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,740
...you asked me to do.

91
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,860
Everything is fine there.

92
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,620
Yes.

93
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,660
That old pervert, the fucker.

94
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,820
I want the information...

95
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
...of any new person coming in.

96
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,940
Get everybody's ID.

97
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,180
- Sir!
- Forensics?

98
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,580
Anything else?

99
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,860
You'll know if there is.

100
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,660
Sir.

101
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,820
Look, Gehlot.

102
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,860
It's a big case, with bigger names.

103
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,460
The smallest mistake...

104
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,060
...puts our heads on the line.

105
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,500
- Okay.
- You understood that, right?

106
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,420
Sir.

107
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,340
Go wait outside with your team.

108
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,300
And make sure there's no fuck up.

109
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,340
Yes, sir.

110
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,500
I'll call you if needed.

111
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,420
Fucker.

112
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,220
Sir, this register has the guest names and room numbers.

113
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,100
Who's this?

114
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,980
Sir, this is Thakkar sir. He's right there.

115
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Taken statements?

116
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
Not yet, sir. We haven't told anybody yet.

117
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,900
Why?

118
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,260
Are you waiting for a good time?

119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,340
You'll find the killer without investigating?

120
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,980
Sir, a heroine has died.

121
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,340
The media will go crazy.

122
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,900
Call all the guests here.

123
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,900
Confiscate their mobile phones.

124
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,260
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,380
The hotel landline.

126
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,660
No incoming, no outgoing.

127
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,100
Block it right now.

128
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,820
I'm on it.

129
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,140
Sir?

130
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,900
There's one guest missing.

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,060
Who?

132
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,420
Sir, the one engaged to Ms. Vani.

133
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,140
Kartik Sharma.

134
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,380
Brother! Stop the car! Please!

135
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,180
Fucker! You want to die?

136
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Brother, please! Can you help me?

137
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,420
Please, just help me!

138
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,700
I'm in a lot of trouble, brother!

139
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,220
Are you thief or something?

140
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,100
Do I look like a thief to you?

141
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,300
No brother, you don't look like a thief.

142
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,740
But you know, my wife?

143
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,660
If she found out that...

144
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
...I let a complete stranger...

145
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,940
...sit in the car,

146
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,140
...she'll make my life miserable.

147
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,020
For the sake of humanity!

148
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,300
Please help me out. Please!

149
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,580
Just drop me ahead.

150
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,060
- Please!
- Brother.

151
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,340
Fine, come. Sit inside.

152
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,140
Thank you, brother!

153
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,740
Inform the patrolling vans.

154
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,180
And put up barriers in town.

155
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,980
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,900
What are you looking at?

157
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,700
Stop this drunken song.

158
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,380
And bring a drink for me.

159
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,820
Yes, sir. I'll send one.

160
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,980
There's a person missing.

161
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,900
Kartik Sharma.

162
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,660
Vani Kapoor's fiancÃ©.

163
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,500
Nobody knows where he went.

164
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,020
It's possible he saw Vani's dead body and panicked.

165
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,980
Or maybe he's the one...

166
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,300
Yes.

167
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,180
How badly did you fuck up, brother?

168
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,220
And if it's such a big problem,

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,820
...then you should go to the police.

170
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,580
Police?

171
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,140
No, no brother. I don't want to involve the police.

172
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,740
So you don't trust the police?

173
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,140
Am I the asshole for trusting you?

174
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,980
That's not it, brother.

175
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,580
I'm in a lot of trouble, brother.

176
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,700
Just do one thing.

177
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,380
Drop me anywhere outside the city.

178
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,140
It'll be a big favour for me, please brother.

179
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,260
I'm a little late today.

180
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,340
I'll be home soon.

181
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,100
Shikha.

182
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,540
Phone number?

183
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,660
8818...

184
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,100
...158.

185
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,540
Room number?

186
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
412.

187
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,900
Okay.

188
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,820
Is he an actor too?

189
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,540
Who, sir?

190
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,100
Vani Chopra's fiancÃ©.

191
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,980
Kartik Sharma? No, sir. He's a writer.

192
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,020
Film writer. He's written a lot of films.

193
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,300
'Champion', 'Raja Rani aur Chor'.

194
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,380
And that murder mystery? 'Kaatil Kaun'.

195
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,260
Looks like he's too inspired by his own films.

196
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,580
Photo?

197
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,980
Yes, sir. I have one.

198
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,940
Sir, this is it.

199
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,420
What is this, fucker?

200
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,180
Sir, the photo of 'Kaatil'...

201
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,220
Don't you have his photo?

202
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,540
Sorry, sir! I thought you wanted to see the poster.

203
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,940
What is this nonsense?

204
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,900
Sir.

205
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,100
Kartik Sharma.

206
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,020
Hold it up.

207
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,820
Get another drink.

208
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,860
Yes, sir.

209
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,180
I've sent a photo.

210
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,220
Kartik Sharma.

211
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,340
He's a murder suspect.

212
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,940
He'll try to leave the city.

213
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,980
I want him arrested.

214
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,540
Got it?

215
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,980
How did we get caught?

216
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,060
Who's caught?

217
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,460
Look ahead, brother!

218
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,340
Police checkpost.

219
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,380
That check post has been there forever.

220
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Don't worry.

221
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,860
Didn't I tell you that I...

222
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,140
...don't want to involve the police?

223
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,620
Brother, please take some other way!

224
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,220
The other way is far too long!

225
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,380
So just take it!

226
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,980
I'll pay you, I told you!

227
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,900
You think I'm a taxi driver?

228
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,460
Take this route, that route!

229
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,740
Please, take a u-turn from here.

230
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,140
Please take the other route!

231
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,860
Wait, wait, wait! Stop the car! Stop the car!

232
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,340
Bring it ahead, bring it here.

233
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,460
Open the window.

234
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,900
What's your name?

235
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,820
Manohar.

236
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,940
License?

237
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,820
Yes, what?

238
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm coming! Wait here.

239
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,620
I'll be back.

240
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,860
Yes, sir?

241
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,380
Brother...

242
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,380
Listen, brother.

243
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,420
I've gotten into a mess because of you.

244
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,140
I'm going to go straight to my wife...

245
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,060
...and romance her.

246
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,820
You...

247
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,500
...figure it out, brother.

248
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,140
But brother, where will I go?

249
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,820
You won't go to the police.

250
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,860
If there's somebody that can...

251
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,300
...help you in this situation,

252
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,980
...then it's the King.

253
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,140
Brother, I don't know anybody here. Nobody at all!

254
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,300
Everybody here knows King Sujaan Singh.

255
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,260
His palace is nearby.

256
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,660
If you want to, then go there.

257
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,100
You might find some help.

258
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,420
And if you don't want to,

259
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,820
...then do you as want.

260
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,660
You're not getting it.

261
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,580
I know I'm troubling you, but...

262
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,340
Get out of the car.

263
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,020
- Brother, but you...
- Get out!

264
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,100
Out!

265
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,780
Get out.

266
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,900
Good evening, sir.

267
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,220
We've been calling for so long.

268
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,300
Were you dead asleep?

269
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,060
Sir, my phone was on silent.

270
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,100
Why're you grinning?

271
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Pay attention.

272
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,940
It's a very important case.

273
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,540
An actress is dead.

274
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,500
A well-known actress is dead.

275
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
The smallest bit of information is crucial.

276
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,620
Don't miss out on anything.

277
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,180
Yes, sir.

278
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,260
Take this.

279
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,900
Sir, so...

280
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,100
What?

281
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,140
Sir...

282
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
What happened?

283
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,460
I wanted to meet Mr. Sujaan Singh.

284
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,660
Your name?

285
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,420
My...

286
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,420
Karan.

287
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,820
Karan Verma.

288
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,700
Sir, I... I...

289
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,060
Come in.

290
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,500
Wait here, please.

291
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,140
Vasukhi?

292
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,500
Kartik?

293
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,220
Vasukhi, you're here?

294
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,780
Uncle had said that somebody...

295
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,740
I...

296
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,980
Please, come in.

297
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Come in.

298
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,340
Come in!

299
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,420
Please, come in!

300
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,100
Did you try the writer's phone?

301
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,700
Tried sir, but it's switched off.

302
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,220
Keep trying.

303
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,940
He'll switch it on at some point.

304
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,900
Share his number with the surveillance team.

305
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,340
Find his last location.

306
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,260
This is top priority.

307
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,140
Yes, sir.

308
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,300
Where's the surveillance room?

309
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,980
Sir, this way, behind the reception.

310
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,740
Listen.

311
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,100
Send my bottle from the car.

312
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I'll check this out.

313
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,060
Yes, sir.

314
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,900
I can't believe this.

315
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,860
You're here. With me.

316
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,060
Actually, I...

317
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
How did you know that I'm here?

318
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,060
Hold on.

319
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,140
Did you really know?

320
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,340
No, I came to meet Sujaan...

321
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,900
This is...

322
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,860
...Mr. Sujaan Singh's palace, right?

323
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,100
Yes.

324
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,020
The palace belongs to him.

325
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,100
And I do too.

326
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,060
You're Mr. Sujaan Singh's?

327
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,220
He's my husband.

328
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm, I'm really sorry Vasukhi...

329
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
I'll go now, I shouldn't have just come here.

330
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,780
I'm really sorry!

331
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm happy to see you and you're leaving?

332
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,860
I'm really messed up right now, Vasukhi.

333
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,260
I'll come meet you later.

334
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,660
You had some work with him?

335
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,260
Then meet him and go.

336
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,260
You can see what kind of...

337
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
...husband your Vasukhi chose for herself.

338
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,740
This is not the right time, Vasukhi.

339
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,500
I told you, I'll come back to meet you.

340
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,020
I'll leave now.

341
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,660
You've met me after twelve years, Kartik.

342
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,940
And you're running away again?

343
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,580
I won't let you run away today.

344
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,860
What happened?

345
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,460
Kartik?

346
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,300
Huh?

347
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,340
What happened?

348
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,380
You look so tense.

349
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Can I meet Mr. Sujaan Singh right now?

350
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,260
He's not here right now.

351
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,140
How long will it take for Mr. Sujaan Singh to come?

352
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,660
We've met after so long.

353
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,260
You could ask about me, you know?

354
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,380
I still remember those days.

355
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,060
As if,

356
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,540
...it was just yesterday.

357
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,700
Sorry, Vasukhi.

358
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,060
I got scared.

359
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,380
My life and career weren't shaping up.

360
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,020
The responsibility of marriage was too much.

361
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,260
And you always knew that...

362
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,140
...I wanted to go to Mumbai, become a big writer.

363
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,340
Wanted to become famous.

364
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,660
Did I ever blame you?

365
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,980
It was my fault to begin with.

366
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,660
I was the one crazy about you.

367
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,580
I knew that much about you.

368
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,820
My mind said that you...

369
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,060
...wouldn't come.

370
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,860
But my heart wouldn't agree.

371
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,780
I was going to get hurt anyway.

372
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,220
Forget that.

373
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,100
You say.

374
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,380
What work did you have with Sujaan?

375
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Tell me.

376
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,100
He never says no to me.

377
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,300
There's been a big problem.

378
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,220
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

379
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,620
I can't believe it myself.

380
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,900
But what happened?

381
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,060
It was my engagement today.

382
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,540
Engagement?

383
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,220
With Vani.

384
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,620
There was an odd feeling to it.

385
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,460
The decision that I never took with anybody in my life,

386
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,420
...I took with Vani in six months.

387
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,980
We were so happy.

388
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,700
Guys, we have come together for this...

389
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,140
...special day in the lives of our friends.

390
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,940
Vani and Kartik.

391
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,340
This day is special for us as well.

392
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,260
That we're getting the chance...

393
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,780
...to share this special day with them.

394
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,740
I want us to be happy together forever.

395
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,500
- And you writer!
- Hmm?

396
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,100
You'll have to keep happy for her entire life.

397
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,700
Because she's the Queen of Bollywood.

398
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,980
You know that?

399
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,540
Okay, let's do the formalities.

400
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,580
Okay, then.

401
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,500
Somebody whistle, come on!

402
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,380
She clearly was the Queen.

403
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,820
Queen of Hearts.

404
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,300
And a queen has too many admirers.

405
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,100
Say.

406
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,900
He ran away?

407
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,580
Are all of you high on something?

408
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,020
Shove that apology up your ass!

409
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,220
Understood?

410
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,340
And find him right now!

411
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,220
Search every home and hotel in the area.

412
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,100
Report back.

413
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,100
Sangram.

414
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,980
Come to the CCTV room.

415
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,180
Yes, sir?

416
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
Anything from the IT Team?

417
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,780
Not yet, sir. But they're on it.

418
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
They haven't slept off like the forensic team?

419
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,820
Not at all, sir. They're doing a trace.

420
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,420
There's a Wi-Fi problem, sir.

421
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,140
Internet is slow. We'll find out, it'll take some time.

422
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,900
It's time that I don't have.

423
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,220
I need the story.

424
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,540
Story.

425
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,740
Not a story, sir.

426
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,140
We need the motive.

427
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,220
Really?

428
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,940
Have you become a writer too?

429
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,260
Sorry, sir.

430
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,620
Sangram, listen.

431
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,460
This might be a case with film people.

432
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,220
But our work can't be like a film.

433
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
Got it?

434
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,780
Yes, sir.

435
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,140
Not every story is...

436
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,860
...what it looks like.

437
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,740
You need to find the twist in the story.

438
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
Rehan?

439
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Rehan Mustafa?

440
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
You're a producer, right?

441
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,300
I googled it.

442
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,500
There's a lot of praise for you.

443
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,980
The media prints what they want, sir.

444
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,020
You're the one that launched Vani, right?

445
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,980
I've launched a lot of writers and directors too.

446
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,140
What does that have to do...

447
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,500
...with all of this right now?

448
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,060
Listen, producer.

449
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,740
Calm down.

450
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,580
This isn't your Mumbai.

451
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,900
A phone call won't set things straight.

452
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,540
Understood?

453
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,180
Listen to my questions...

454
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,340
...and answer them properly.

455
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,500
Weren't you the first one to see the dead body?

456
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,940
How?

457
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,020
Sir, I went towards their room.

458
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,620
The door was open.

459
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,580
I went inside, and saw that Vani was covered in blood.

460
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,700
And Kartik wasn't there.

461
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,100
The question is that...

462
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,700
...why did you go there at midnight?

463
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,140
What was so important at midnight?

464
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,980
Rehan Mustafa.

465
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,540
Where did your button break off?

466
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,900
Hmm?

467
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,460
I don't know, sir.

468
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Let me tell you.

469
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,780
It was in Vani Chopra's room.

470
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,220
The question is, how did it get there?

471
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,500
Right?

472
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,660
What do you mean?

473
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,340
Now you tell me,

474
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,540
...the picture happening in this film,

475
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,020
...what's the story behind that?

476
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
I was drunk.

477
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,380
I was intoxicated.

478
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,420
And old memories came back to me.

479
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,180
Old memories?

480
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,380
Like what?

481
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,020
I was the one that launched Vani.

482
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
And we became close at that time.

483
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,860
So that means these media people...

484
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,260
...don't just publish nonsense.

485
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,580
There's some truth to it.

486
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,380
So, Mr. Producer, it'll be best for you...

487
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,060
...to tell me everything clearly.

488
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,420
I'll make sure you're released faster.

489
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,660
You ditched me.

490
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,260
You did!

491
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,820
Okay. I know, I know.

492
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,020
I'll meet you on shoot.

493
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,260
Okay.

494
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,100
Okay, bye.

495
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Okay.

496
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,140
Oh!

497
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,140
Control yourself.

498
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,820
I'm going to live with you all the time from now on.

499
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,060
Kartik!

500
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,780
Rehan! What the fuck, Rehan?

501
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,700
Vani, I love you.

502
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,060
- You bastard!
- Stop it!

503
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,460
What happened then?

504
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
What could happen?

505
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,300
I lost my temper, started yelling and screaming.

506
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,980
It felt like some sort of...

507
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,540
...storm was raging inside of me.

508
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,780
- Kartik, Kartik, Kartik! Stop!
- Vani, move! Ass!

509
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,980
Fucker!

510
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,140
Rehan!

511
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,380
Did you forget who you are?

512
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,260
You're used to thrown away bones like a dog, aren't you?

513
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,860
Yeah! I've screwed her...

514
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,300
...much before you had even thought about her!

515
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,540
- You bastard!
- Stop!

516
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,980
?Yes, my friend! I've fucked this pretty woman...

517
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,420
...so many times, that I've lost the count!

518
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,660
Shut up!

519
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,740
So you are the villain...

520
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
...in the story.

521
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,980
Right?

522
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
So tell me.

523
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,380
Was is love, or...

524
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,700
...lust?

525
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,340
I've heard that the film line...

526
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,300
...doesn't understand love.

527
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,780
And relationships are like business here.

528
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,260
Rehan sir, it looks like you couldn't move on.

529
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
No, sir.

530
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,300
I was drunk, but that wasn't my intention.

531
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,380
And what if you murdered Vani...

532
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,660
...in that drunken haze?

533
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,100
Right?

534
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,220
It's not like I don't know the industry.

535
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Or about Vani.

536
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,340
But I felt cheated, I was hurt.

537
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,500
The more Vani tried to explain, the angrier I got.

538
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,340
Just calm down! Calm down.

539
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,540
- Please!
- I don't want to talk to you.

540
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,820
- Kartik! Hold on, just listen to me!
- I said please leave me!

541
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,660
Tell me.

542
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,220
Tell me, what he was saying was right, yes?

543
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,700
I know. I know him!

544
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Everybody in the industry knows him.

545
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
So what?

546
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,860
God! He was talking rubbish! Stop. Stop!

547
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,700
I know him!

548
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,220
Calm down. Calm down!

549
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,780
This ring? I don't want it!

550
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,260
- What is wrong with you?
- Take it!

551
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,460
What is wrong with you?

552
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,300
- Okay, stop! Please!
- Don't stop me! No!

553
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,740
Kartik, please!

554
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,420
I have no memory of what happened after that.

555
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,940
Maybe I drank too much.

556
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,580
So much so, that I blacked out after a point.

557
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,060
You must remember something, Kartik.

558
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,140
I just remember that...

559
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,220
...when I woke up, then.

560
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,260
Vani?

561
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Vani?

562
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,020
How long have you known Kartik?

563
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,660
I launched him in my first film.

564
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,820
Vani and him met on my set.

565
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,380
Is that so?

566
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,220
Godfather.

567
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,060
Can Kartik murder somebody?

568
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,260
Absolutely.

569
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,900
And how do you know?

570
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,580
He had his vices.

571
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
He would get drunk and become violent.

572
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,860
And you could take advantage of that.

573
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,980
Sir.

574
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm the one sitting here.

575
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,260
He's missing.

576
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,900
I think you can make the connection here.

577
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,260
I'm very good at connecting dots, Rehan sir.

578
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,460
Any idea from the guests?

579
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,580
No, sir.

580
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,100
Every one said things were fine between Kartik and Vani.

581
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,700
What about forensics?

582
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,140
They've collected evidence.

583
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,100
And sent the body for post-mortem.

584
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,540
Listen.

585
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,820
Find out more about Rehan from the guests.

586
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
And there will be a lot of them that...

587
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,820
...made videos and took photos of the party.

588
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,780
Check their phones.

589
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,260
Report to me if you find...

590
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,460
...anything suspicious.

591
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,340
Till then, I'll try to get this...

592
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,020
...Rehan to start talking.

593
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,700
You've never been able to control your anger.

594
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
But I've never...

595
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,740
Hit Vani?

596
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,780
Of course.

597
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,980
You never hit me either.

598
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,820
But your anger did hurt me once.

599
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,660
Remember this scar?

600
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
Is it nice?

601
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Hey!

602
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,140
It's nice, but...

603
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,340
...how did you find out about this hotel?

604
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,700
When you need to, you can find out anything.

605
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,580
But it's safe, right?

606
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,220
Why are you so scared?

607
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,100
- Hmm?
- I'm scared?

608
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,700
I'm scared? I'm scared? Am I?

609
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,540
Just you wait! I'm scared?

610
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,100
I'm scared?

611
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,380
Kartik!

612
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,420
The story is good.

613
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,260
But the ending is a problem.

614
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,140
The character's journey should have a destination.

615
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,100
It doesn't reach.

616
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,740
That's what I can't figure out, the destination.

617
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,860
Finish him.

618
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Kill him.

619
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,260
Like how Romeo died.

620
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,020
How Ranjha died.

621
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,900
You see?

622
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,420
A love story is only fun when...

623
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,300
...a lover dies.

624
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,620
Isn't it?

625
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,620
Hmm?

626
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,300
Why are you laughing?

627
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,420
Tell me if I'm wrong!

628
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,500
No, you're not! It's a good idea.

629
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,780
Not a good idea, great idea!

630
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Oh wow!

631
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,740
I was fixing the story,

632
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,380
...and you've finished the bottle?

633
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,980
You were reading,

634
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,700
...and I was getting excited.

635
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,940
Getting excited?

636
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,540
So tell me.

637
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,660
Hmm?

638
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,780
How did you get the idea to book a room here?

639
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,220
I told you.

640
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,980
I had a need.

641
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,460
So I figured it out.

642
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,540
No, no, no, no.

643
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,420
You can't just figure out coming to a place like this.

644
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,340
You need courage.

645
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,380
What?

646
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,860
Practicing lying at the reception.

647
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,540
You've lied before, right?

648
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,060
Kartik.

649
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,260
You've come here before, right?

650
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,060
Kartik, what are you saying?

651
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,420
Who did you come with?

652
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,900
Kartik, please.

653
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,860
Tell me, who did you come with?

654
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,980
Kartik, don't joke around.

655
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,500
Who did you come with?

656
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,460
- Kartik, what are you thinking?
- Who did you come with?

657
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:58,940
Please tell me.

658
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,180
Kartik, you're hurting me!

659
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,620
- Who did you come with? Tell me!
- Kartik!

660
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,180
- Who was it?
- Kartik!

661
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,220
- Kartik!
- Come on, just tell me!

662
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,500
- Leave me! Leave me!

663
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,180
- Kartik, please! You're hurting me!
- Then tell me! Tell me!

664
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,220
I agree Vasukhi, that...

665
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,620
...I did wrong by you.

666
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,660
It happened so long ago.

667
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,980
Forget it, I don't know why I keep remembering these things.

668
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,780
Vasukhi, I'm really stuck in a major mess.

669
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,220
I know that nobody will believe me, but...

670
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,340
...I don't know why I feel you will.

671
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,420
Otherwise why would fate bring me to you?

672
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,780
And...

673
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,740
...Mr. Sujaan Singh is the ruler here.

674
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,060
He'll have connections everywhere.

675
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,140
If you tell him, then maybe things can be sorted.

676
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,540
Maybe, maybe I can get away.

677
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,660
Don't worry.

678
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,700
I'll definitely tell him.

679
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,100
Can you call him once?

680
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,820
I think Mr. Sujaan Singh is here.

681
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,940
It's the police.

682
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,620
This isn't your Bollywood, fucker.

683
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,780
And this isn't a film story,

684
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,500
...that you'll spin it and the public will be fooled.

685
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,780
Sir, you're threatening me.

686
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,580
Fucker, I haven't made any threats yet.

687
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,340
I'd beat you up right here.

688
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,900
You'll be booked under 302, 307 and 304.

689
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,500
It's a clear cut murder!

690
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,660
And 375, 375A on top of that, fucker!

691
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,700
Attempt to rape!

692
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,620
Threatening you? What is this?

693
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,300
What is this?

694
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,500
This is the footage before the murder.

695
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,180
Why did you go there?

696
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,460
Let me tell you a story.

697
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,500
If you like it,

698
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,300
...then make a film.

699
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,020
You couldn't stand to see your...

700
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,980
...time-pass girlfriend getting married...

701
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,340
...to somebody else.

702
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,460
After a failed attempt to seduce her,

703
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,460
...you killed her.

704
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,060
And you blamed her fiancÃ© for it.

705
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,620
Sir, that's nonsense.

706
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,620
The real nonsense is here!

707
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
This story is based on real events.

708
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,180
And here is the proof!

709
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,380
Sir, I went to the room.

710
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,740
But then I...

711
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,780
...returned from the door.

712
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,260
Of course, you just went for a pilgrimage.

713
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,260
Sir, I went to apologize.

714
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,580
But...

715
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,260
But, I didn't. Check the rest of the footage.

716
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,860
Do you think I'm an ass?

717
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,300
There's no more footage!

718
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,140
You're a smart player.

719
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,860
No, sir! I have no idea...

720
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,380
You won't escape, nope!

721
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,020
Hey, Sangram!

722
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,220
Yes, sir?

723
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,020
Bring the manager here!

724
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,500
Immediately!

725
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,660
Yes, sir.

726
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,780
- Vasukhi!
- Kartik.

727
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,740
Kartik!

728
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,220
Listen to me! I didn't do anything!

729
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,300
I'm telling the truth! I didn't do a thing!

730
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,580
- Vasukhi, please stop them!
- Kartik!

731
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,020
Please listen to me!

732
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,060
There's nobody there.

733
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,700
What were you looking at?

734
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,340
Vasukhi!

735
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,060
Calm yourself.

736
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,540
Vasukhi.

737
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,100
Will you please talk to Mr. Sujaan Singh once?

738
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,540
Please call him and talk to him. Just once! Please!

739
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,380
I will do it.

740
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,820
Come, come.

741
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,180
There are plenty of benefits of being in the royal family.

742
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,820
The police thinks ten times before they...

743
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,220
...decide to come inside.

744
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,060
Sit.

745
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,940
You're safe for a while now.

746
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,900
But it looks like they're looking for you all over town.

747
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
Otherwise...

748
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,540
...they wouldn't come up to the palace.

749
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,340
Won't Mr. Sujaan Singh's word make a difference?

750
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,300
He'll believe me, won't he?

751
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,500
Of course he will.

752
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,660
He will, if I tell him to.

753
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,900
He really loves me.

754
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,380
And will you tell him?

755
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,220
I'll have to.

756
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,060
Even if it was 12 years ago,

757
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,580
...I did fall in love with you.

758
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,660
You loved me then, didn't you?

759
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,700
Yes, Vasukhi. I did!

760
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,020
As much as...

761
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,420
...I loved you?

762
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,860
Perhaps.

763
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,900
And did you love Vani as much?

764
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,300
If you don't mind, then...

765
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,020
...I want to say this.

766
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,980
When you're in love, even if...

767
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,780
...it's for a short time,

768
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,260
...you become really possessive.

769
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,660
I've seen it myself.

770
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,220
You can't handle it.

771
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,140
At that time, if you happen to hear...

772
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,620
...or see something bad about...

773
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,980
...that girl.

774
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,260
I won't judge you.

775
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,740
Promise.

776
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,820
But tell me something honestly.

777
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,980
And think about it with a calm mind.

778
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,980
Are you sure?

779
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,580
That you didn't kill Vani?

780
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
I mean,

781
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,300
...while drunk?

782
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,780
Or in your anger?

783
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,580
Name?

784
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,420
Sir, Shipra Soni.

785
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,820
Shipra, do you know who is currently...

786
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,020
...staying in Suite 503...

787
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,820
...in your hotel?

788
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,740
Yes, sir. The entire hotel knew.

789
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,300
They were our special guests.

790
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,780
Did you meet them?

791
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,140
Vani and Kartik?

792
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,300
I asked you a question.

793
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,460
Yes, sir. I...

794
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,620
I went to their suite with an order.

795
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,540
At what time?

796
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,620
Sir, it must have been around 11 - 11:15 PM.

797
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,020
And what was the order?

798
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,740
Sir, rose wine.

799
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,260
Who placed the order?

800
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,780
Yeah?

801
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,420
Room service, ma'am.

802
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,620
Can't you guys fucking leave me alone?

803
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,380
Sorry, ma'am.

804
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,860
Come in.

805
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,460
Ma'am, Rehan sir sent this.

806
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,820
And said sorry to you as well.

807
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,540
Is that so?

808
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,580
And when you took the order,

809
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,820
...what was happening in the room?

810
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,540
Sir, nothing. Miss Vani asked me to come in, and...

811
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,300
...I kept the wine and came back.

812
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,060
And Kartik?

813
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,180
I didn't see Kartik there, sir.

814
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,980
Baby, we need to talk!

815
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,740
Look, Rehan apologized!

816
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,580
Okay, ma'am.

817
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,900
He sent wine.

818
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,740
Have a good evening!

819
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,740
Kartik, please?

820
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,060
That's enough! Come out now, please?

821
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,060
Perhaps he was inside the washroom.

822
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,220
And when you met Vani,

823
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,820
...did you feel that she was...

824
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,820
...under any pressure or...

825
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,580
...under any stress, or if you noted something odd?

826
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,140
No, sir. I didn't feel anything like that.

827
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,660
Hmm.

828
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,180
You can leave now.

829
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,180
Where are you going?

830
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,940
Come, let's stitch your buttons.

831
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,820
You look tense.

832
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,660
Want a drink?

833
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,780
Hmm?

834
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,980
No, I'm fine.

835
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,100
He says he's fine.

836
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,100
Let's make this simple.

837
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,620
His Highness will be here in the morning.

838
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,260
And before he comes,

839
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,660
...I need to prepare a story.

840
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,700
Just hope that...

841
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,540
...Kartik is found before the day begins.

842
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,940
Otherwise, you are the villain in...

843
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,580
...my story.

844
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,420
Drink it.

845
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,900
You'll feel calmer.

846
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,460
Who knew we'd meet once again?

847
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,180
And that too like this?

848
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,300
It all seems like a dream.

849
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,060
Who knew my life was going to get so tangled?

850
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,460
Any idea, when Mr. Sujaan Singh will be back?

851
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,740
He'll be here.

852
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,420
Don't worry.

853
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,260
Call him once?

854
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,540
I spoke to him just before you came.

855
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,660
He doesn't like being called too much.

856
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,660
Is everything fine, Vasukhi?

857
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,020
I mean,

858
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,060
...between you and Mr. Sujaan Singh?

859
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,100
Why do you ask that?

860
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,020
No, I don't know.

861
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,140
He loves me a lot.

862
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,780
I'm happy.

863
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,140
Fucker, if he never went into her room...

864
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,620
...then who did?

865
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,540
Forget about me.

866
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,140
You tell me.

867
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,500
You're able to finish the story on paper.

868
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,460
But you're scared in life.

869
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,700
What do you mean scared?

870
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,740
It's an old problem of yours.

871
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,220
You write good stories, but...

872
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,020
...you can never set the end.

873
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,020
You keep running around.

874
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,700
That's why you've never committed to a relationship.

875
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,020
First, it was me.

876
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,700
Then somebody else.

877
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,980
Then another.

878
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,420
You keep track off me, is that it?

879
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,940
I won't lie.

880
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,700
I do stalk you once in a while.

881
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,380
The media will publish anything.

882
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,700
None of it is true.

883
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,180
I know you well, Kartik.

884
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,460
I know your thought process,

885
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,180
...your shortcomings.

886
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,940
I knew all of them.

887
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,940
I know them now.

888
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,660
So what's real and what's a lie,

889
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,020
...is easy to figure out.

890
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,180
But that aside.

891
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,620
Come.

892
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,340
Oh, just come!

893
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,220
Sir?

894
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,820
The surveillance team called.

895
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,140
We have Kartik's last location.

896
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,260
Where is the location?

897
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,740
Ratangarh, near the checkpost.

898
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,180
Near the King's palace.

899
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,660
Fucker.

900
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,740
What happened, sir?

901
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,700
Nothing.

902
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,860
Let's go.

903
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,820
This is my world.

904
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,860
Consider it a hobby.

905
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,420
There's not much to do at home in the royal family.

906
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,060
So I've started...

907
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,700
...these hobbies.

908
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,700
New and old,

909
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,980
...I've collected all the memories.

910
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,180
Look at this.

911
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,820
It's an ancestral weapon.

912
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,340
The Maharaja of Nepal gifted that one.

913
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,180
Look at it!

914
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,060
Pick it up.

915
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,420
And this one, over here?

916
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,780
I really love this one.

917
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,700
Come here?

918
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,900
We brought this from Turkey.

919
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,540
From Istanbul.

920
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:57,980
Open it up.

921
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,420
No, it's fine.

922
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,780
Oh, just open it and see.

923
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,060
By the way.

924
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,500
A pen suits your hands much more.

925
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,300
Sir, you're from a royal family yourself.

926
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,700
Your working methods are also...

927
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,660
...refined, I mean, with patience.

928
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,900
Why are you in such a hurry to solve this case?

929
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,420
This case needs to be...

930
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,180
...wrapped up quick.

931
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,340
Because the longer it takes...

932
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:34,980
...the bigger the case will get, and...

933
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,820
...it'll get more tangled.

934
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,300
So sir, how are you approaching this case?

935
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,420
Look, Sangram.

936
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,260
It becomes really easy to solve any riddle,

937
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,340
...if you look at that riddle...

938
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,300
...from the other side.

939
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,860
And, cut!

940
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,140
Amazing shot, we'll do one more quickly!

941
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,660
What a shot, Miss Vani!

942
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,700
- Amazing!
- Really?

943
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,420
I mean, the people will go mad!

944
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,460
And the next shot?

945
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,460
The next shot will be a two shot, ma'am.

946
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,140
And after that, it's pack up time.

947
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,500
Then a three day holiday!

948
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,380
Aah!

949
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,860
There are beautiful places to roam around.

950
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,540
He's the king here, King Sujaan Singh.

951
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,620
I'll meet him and come.

952
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,220
Hmm.

953
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,540
Thank you so much, Your Highness!

954
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,420
You gave us permissions to shoot here.

955
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,220
My pleasure.

956
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,340
Your Highness, this is Vani. Vani Chopra.

957
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,740
Who doesn't know her?

958
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,020
And Vani, this is the King of Ratangarh.

959
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,700
His Highness, Sujaan Singh.

960
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,780
I hope nothing troubles you over here.

961
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,300
Not at all, Your Highness.

962
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,500
Sujaan.

963
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,940
Sure.

964
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,420
Ma'am, shot is ready.

965
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,660
Would you excuse me, please?

966
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,580
Of course. You go and shoot.

967
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,820
We'll meet again.

968
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,780
Of course.

969
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,780
Sujaan.

970
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,060
Arrange a meeting for us.

971
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,540
In private.

972
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,020
That old pervert!

973
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,380
As I was saying,

974
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,020
...how did you like our state?

975
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,180
It's beautiful!

976
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,340
I wish I could stay here.

977
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:56,500
Consider it yours.

978
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,660
Stay back.

979
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,900
There needs to be a reason to stay back.

980
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,100
There's plenty.

981
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,420
Really? Like what?

982
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,620
This is like a garden.

983
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,020
And this garden is just missing a rose like you.

984
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,300
That's very flattering, Sujaan.

985
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,700
Consider this.

986
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,340
I'll finance your next film.

987
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,340
Hmm?

988
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,620
Shoot it here.

989
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,700
You'll have an excuse to stay.

990
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,740
Your offer is too good to be true.

991
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,340
You my darling, are too good to be true.

992
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,900
Kartik found out about Vani's affair.

993
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,700
That's why he murdered her.

994
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,020
Right, sir?

995
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,220
You want everything in a rush, is it?

996
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,260
Listen to the whole story.

997
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,500
You run to the climax!

998
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,940
Sorry, sir. Tell me.

999
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,580
It's obvious that if it was a planned murder,

1000
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,940
...then the planning was done in advance.

1001
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,340
Sujaan Singh and Vani...

1002
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,460
...kept meeting each other.

1003
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,180
But Sujaan never once...

1004
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,420
...went to Vani's suite.

1005
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,140
However,

1006
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,260
...Vani definitely went to Sujaan's suite.

1007
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,380
But the murder happened,

1008
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,820
...in Vani's suite.

1009
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,740
But then there was something...

1010
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,260
...in the footage from two days ago,

1011
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,340
...that maybe nobody else noticed.

1012
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,500
If what I'm thinking...

1013
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,820
...is what happened,

1014
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,300
...then the story is complete.

1015
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,420
You look so tired!

1016
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,540
Absolutely bathed in sweat.

1017
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,300
Listen.

1018
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,700
Turn around, take off that jacket.

1019
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,740
No, no. It's fine! I'm fine like this!

1020
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,060
Go get fresh!

1021
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,540
You'll feel better.

1022
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,060
Give that to me.

1023
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,500
Which way is it?

1024
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,900
Over there, in that corner.

1025
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,220
Go.

1026
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,100
That night,

1027
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,900
...I kept waiting.

1028
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,140
And you didn't come.

1029
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,580
You don't have any idea...

1030
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,820
...about how that single wait changed my entire life.

1031
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,060
My marriage was fixed with Sujaan within three days.

1032
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,180
I didn't say a word.

1033
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,340
I let things happen the way they were...

1034
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,580
...happening.

1035
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,860
Perhaps I was taking revenge on myself...

1036
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,660
...for you not showing up.

1037
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,540
The first few months were so odd for me.

1038
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,860
Like I was sleepwalking.

1039
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,820
Say right, and I'd go right.

1040
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,340
Say left, and I'd turn left.

1041
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,500
I'd hide my face in the pillows and cry.

1042
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,420
It wasn't easy for me.

1043
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,620
But I have to say,

1044
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,020
...that Sujaan helped me.

1045
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,740
He gave me every single thing...

1046
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,820
...that any girl could wish for.

1047
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,340
He...

1048
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,660
...really started to love me.

1049
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,500
He taught me to love once again.

1050
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,060
Slowly, I fell in love with him too.

1051
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,860
We didn't have any children.

1052
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,740
But Sujaan didn't have any malice over that either.

1053
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,900
I started to feel that nobody could...

1054
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,700
...love me more than he did.

1055
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,580
And that's how twelve years went by.

1056
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,900
Twelve years.

1057
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,580
And...

1058
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,420
...then six days ago.

1059
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,940
I was thinking,

1060
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,820
...let's go out somewhere today.

1061
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,260
I can't go today.

1062
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,060
I have some work.

1063
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,100
What work?

1064
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,140
Since when did you take interest in my work?

1065
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,260
You could tell me.

1066
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,500
I'm your wife.

1067
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,340
Then behave like a wife.

1068
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,900
Don't try to be a detective.

1069
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,060
It's far more important to know how long...

1070
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,900
...somebody can love you,

1071
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,420
...than knowing how much they love you.

1072
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,380
Isn't it, Kartik?

1073
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,060
Three years spent with you,

1074
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,340
...then you didnât love me anymore.

1075
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,660
Twelve years with Sujaan,

1076
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,700
...and then he didn't love me any more.

1077
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:36,700
I...

1078
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,900
...could have dealt with that too.

1079
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,900
Perhaps.

1080
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,340
If it wasn't a double whammy.

1081
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,980
Yes?

1082
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,020
Tell me.

1083
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,260
Engagement?

1084
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,260
Who?

1085
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,020
Kartik?

1086
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,540
When Sujaan betrayed me, it devastated my entire existence.

1087
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,580
He gave me everything,

1088
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,980
...and then...

1089
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,140
...snatched it away?

1090
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,420
And when I found out that the one...

1091
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,820
...he betrayed me for,

1092
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,940
...was none other than...

1093
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:46,180
...your fiancÃ©e,

1094
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,380
...then how could I forgive him?

1095
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,820
Maybe you can understand my pain now.

1096
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,820
How it feels when somebody you love hurts you.

1097
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,980
You're talking nonsense!

1098
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,900
I don't believe it!

1099
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,340
It's not possible.

1100
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,540
Vani would never!

1101
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,620
She would never betray me!

1102
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,460
Never! Never! She would never do that!

1103
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,420
If Vani wanted to, she could have told you about Sujaan.

1104
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,500
But I knew,

1105
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,620
...that she wouldn't have done it.

1106
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:27,940
Hey, what's up?

1107
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,140
Hey! Where are you?

1108
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,740
I'm standing right outside your room! Where are you?

1109
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:32,860
What?

1110
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,660
What are you doing here?

1111
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,380
I came to surprise you!

1112
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,660
Everybody is here. My friends, your friends.

1113
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,460
Do you remember, Vani?

1114
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:42,860
I had told you that...

1115
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,380
...as soon as this big project gets finalized,

1116
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,740
...we'll get engaged.

1117
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,860
And the project has been finalized!

1118
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,020
Wow! That's amazing, Kartik.

1119
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,020
Come meet me, I'll tell you everything!

1120
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,980
Uh.

1121
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:57,700
I'm coming.

1122
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:59,140
I'll meet you in the lobby.

1123
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,780
Okay, I'm waiting! Come fast!

1124
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,500
Time for a drink!

1125
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,780
No, thank you.

1126
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,060
All okay?

1127
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:14,540
I have to go.

1128
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:15,620
What?

1129
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,220
My boyfriend is here.

1130
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,620
Along with all our friends.

1131
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:24,820
What?

1132
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,300
To get engaged.

1133
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:29,780
Vani?

1134
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,940
Oh, just shut up Vasukhi!

1135
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,620
You've murdered somebody!

1136
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,060
You've killed your husband!

1137
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,620
And now you're spinning tales in your head!

1138
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,500
It's your job to spin tales.

1139
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,740
I'm just...

1140
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,060
...rewriting the end.

1141
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,500
Be honest, Vasukhi.

1142
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,380
Who killed Vani...

1143
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,100
At first, I thought that...

1144
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,820
...why Vani?

1145
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,660
What's the connection to her?

1146
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,340
Then I figured, why not?

1147
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,740
Why should I punish myself every time?

1148
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,900
Why don't the sinners get their punishment?

1149
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:32,380
Which room are Vani and Kartik in?

1150
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,580
There must be CCTVs there, right?

1151
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,100
Listen.

1152
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,300
Do this.

1153
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,420
Shipra's family owes us many, many debts.

1154
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,020
And in Rajasthan, paying off a debt means...

1155
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,420
...people can give their life...

1156
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,500
...and take one too.

1157
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:04,260
Manan?

1158
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,820
Whose order is this?

1159
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,180
The ones getting engaged, Vani Chopra and Kartik.

1160
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:09,860
Why?

1161
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,660
Did they order this?

1162
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,260
No! That Rehan who stays with them, the producer? He did.

1163
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:15,900
Oh.

1164
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,900
He also asked me to apologize on his behalf.

1165
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,100
Why can't these people just call and apologize?

1166
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,780
Listen, I'm a big fan of Vani's.

1167
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,180
Can I go give it?

1168
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,860
I'll take a selfie as well.

1169
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,460
Please?

1170
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,940
Yes, yes. It's fine.

1171
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,460
- Thanks!
- Take this. Go!

1172
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,020
Ma'am, Rehan sir has sent this.

1173
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,420
And he's apologized to you as well.

1174
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,020
Baby!

1175
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,860
Baby, we need to talk!

1176
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,820
Look, Rehan has apologized!

1177
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:49,340
He's sent wine!

1178
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,140
Kartik, please!

1179
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,220
Please come out?

1180
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,260
Okay ma'am. Have a good evening!

1181
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:01,740
That's enough! Come out now! Please?

1182
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,100
Switch on the CCTV after 5 minutes.

1183
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,620
I wanted to see how...

1184
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,060
...Sujaan would react when he...

1185
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,100
...heard the news of Vani's death.

1186
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,020
Vani Chopra has been murdered, sir.

1187
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,660
What?

1188
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,260
When?

1189
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:41,940
Listen.

1190
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,100
Is her phone there? Take it.

1191
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:49,980
I have it.

1192
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,140
Look for a bouquet too.

1193
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,100
There will be a name-tag on it.

1194
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,180
Remove it.

1195
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:04,340
You look really tense!

1196
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,860
Vani has been murdered, right?

1197
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:21,500
How did you know?

1198
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,180
If I told you that...

1199
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,500
...I murdered Vani,

1200
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:30,940
...then?

1201
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,260
She stole you away from me, you see.

1202
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,700
So I killed her.

1203
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,820
In her own room.

1204
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:44,900
Vasukhi!

1205
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,900
Have you gone mad?

1206
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:49,940
What have you done?

1207
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,660
Oh God!

1208
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,500
There's been a murder at our hotel.

1209
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,180
And you're saying everything is fine?

1210
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:04,940
Where are you right now?

1211
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,260
I just left, sir.

1212
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,420
Go back, take the case under you...

1213
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:12,900
...and the entire investigation too.

1214
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,260
Yes, sir.

1215
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,740
Filthy old pervert! Fucker.

1216
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,660
If you didn't love me anymore, then...

1217
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,580
...why did you lie to me all these years, Sujaan?

1218
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,300
Be quiet, Vasukhi.

1219
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,340
Please, let me fix this mess you've made here first.

1220
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,980
Please, just give me some time, okay?

1221
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,300
I just need to fix this.

1222
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:49,620
Yes, say?

1223
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,940
A person is missing.

1224
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:52,340
Who?

1225
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,460
Kartik Sharma.

1226
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,140
Vani Chopra's fiancÃ©.

1227
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,500
What do you mean, missing?

1228
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,540
Nobody knows where he went.

1229
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,140
It's possible he saw Vani's dead body and panicked...

1230
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,420
...or it's possible that...

1231
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,540
This is an open and shut case, Ahlawat!

1232
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,860
Find him immediately and...

1233
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:11,020
...arrest him before sunrise under any circumstance!

1234
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,100
What was so special about Vani?

1235
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,780
Tell me.

1236
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,260
Tell me.

1237
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,260
Tell me.

1238
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,500
Tell me!

1239
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:33,900
Tell me!

1240
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,060
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

1241
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,780
Tell! Me! Tell! Tell!

1242
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:00,780
Why did you spare me?

1243
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,100
If Vani and Sujaan wronged you, then...

1244
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,500
...so did I, according to you.

1245
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,420
Because I wanted to meet you.

1246
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,540
I wanted to know if you ever loved me.

1247
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,260
I could decided about you only after we would meet.

1248
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,700
You were convinced that I would come here?

1249
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,220
It wasn't a coincidence that the car stopped there, Kartik.

1250
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,140
Manohar was there at that time on my orders.

1251
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,460
Yes, Your Highness?

1252
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,580
Now you'll ask me if...

1253
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,620
...I already knew about everything that you would do...

1254
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,380
...after seeing Vani's dead body?

1255
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,660
Do you remember,

1256
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:58,540
...which subjects were my favourite in college?

1257
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,420
Try to remember.

1258
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,980
Psychology and Probability.

1259
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,860
Not bad!

1260
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,860
I still love those subjects as much today.

1261
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:17,900
So I thought,

1262
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,060
...why not use them practically and see?

1263
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:22,980
And look!

1264
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,620
I was right.

1265
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,980
After seeing Vani's dead body,

1266
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,900
...you had two options.

1267
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,660
Option A.

1268
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,020
You could inform the police.

1269
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,980
Option B.

1270
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,740
Panic and run away from there.

1271
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:45,580
You always run away from your problems.

1272
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,420
You think that's the easy way out at that time.

1273
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,300
And that's what you did!

1274
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,180
You picked Option B.

1275
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,940
And you ran away from there.

1276
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,740
You had two options after running away from the hotel.

1277
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,500
Option A.

1278
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,780
Call a special friend,

1279
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,500
...explain the entire situation...

1280
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:08,940
...and ask them for help.

1281
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,660
Option B.

1282
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,820
Leave the city and run.

1283
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,340
You don't have any special friends in this city.

1284
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,540
So that leaves you with one option.

1285
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,580
That's option B.

1286
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,940
That's exactly when my man reached there,

1287
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,500
...and you took a lift.

1288
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,660
Brother! Stop the car! Please!

1289
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,580
Fucker! You want to die?

1290
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,620
Brother, please! Can you help me?

1291
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:49,860
Please, just help me!

1292
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,340
I'm in a lot of trouble, brother!

1293
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,660
And then,

1294
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,740
...when you saw that...

1295
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:58,020
...the police is stationed at every exit point of the city,

1296
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,380
...you had two options.

1297
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,060
Option A.

1298
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,740
Go to the police,

1299
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,820
...surrender yourself.

1300
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:10,900
Option B.

1301
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,740
Keep on running away,

1302
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,980
...till you found a way out...

1303
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,540
...that gave you the slightest chance of escape.

1304
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:22,780
My man did just that.

1305
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,260
He told you about Sujaan and you...

1306
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,220
...made your way here.

1307
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,500
So tell me, writer dearest.

1308
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,100
I write a pretty good story too, don't I?

1309
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,860
So what if...

1310
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,260
...the story happened in real life?

1311
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,740
You're sick!

1312
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,740
You know that you're mad, right?

1313
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:57,820
Fine.

1314
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,540
At least, you came closer to me this way.

1315
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,940
I'll tell the police everything!

1316
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,260
Everything!

1317
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,860
You'll be punished for everything that you've done!

1318
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,140
I'll seek your punishment!

1319
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,900
You can try if you want to.

1320
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,420
The police is reaching.

1321
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,340
Think about it.

1322
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,940
No matter what option you picked,

1323
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:20,820
...you would still end up in jail.

1324
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,460
But I felt that it was necessary to meet you and tell you...

1325
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,460
...because you should know...

1326
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,620
...why you're being punished.

1327
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,820
And the one that's punishing you.

1328
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,140
You can't do anything!

1329
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,460
I can do all of that, and I will do it.

1330
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,060
The story that I tell the police...

1331
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,020
...will ring true to them.

1332
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,020
Your story didn't make it through, this time.

1333
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,940
That knife?

1334
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,060
Why did you touch it?

1335
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,260
Left your fingerprints on it.

1336
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,580
That's what I used...

1337
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,460
...to murder Sujaan.

1338
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,020
That's the one.

1339
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,420
You bloody bitch!

1340
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,420
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1341
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,940
You've ruined my life!

1342
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,940
I wish you'd never come into my life!

1343
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,940
Alright, that's enough!

1344
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:17,100
I'll kill you!

1345
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,300
I'll kill you!

1346
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,260
Handcuff him!

1347
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,660
He made us run a lot.

1348
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,460
His Highness' body is in the washroom.

1349
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,900
That way.

1350
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,340
Alright, Sangram.

1351
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:38,420
The king has moved on.

1352
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,460
Take his body.

1353
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,580
You have everything you need...

1354
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,060
...to finish your story nicely.

1355
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:00,980
Is that so?

1356
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,700
Hello?

1357
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,580
I have an idea for a novel.

1358
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:50,020
Are you interested in publishing it?

1359
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,460
Of course.

1360
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:57,380
My story is ready.

1361
01:26:57,380 --> 01:29:38,130
.
