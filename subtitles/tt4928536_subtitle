1
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:05,085
MAN: My name is Luke Miller. _

2
00:00:05,086 --> 00:00:06,452
I claimed to be

3
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:09,722
a volunteer EMT, but was exposed as a spy

4
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:11,624
sent by the United States government

5
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,425
to undermine the Islamic State.

6
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:17,163
President Dalton...

7
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:19,832
your air strikes bring
pain upon your people

8
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,600
and death to your troops.

9
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,469
Now I must pay for your policies,

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,804
which only plunge America
into endless fire.

11
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,851
Just as you execute our warriors,

12
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,320
we will exterminate all
so-called American aid workers

13
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,189
within our borders.

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,590
They are heathens

15
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,892
and puppets of American intelligence

16
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:49,093
and will be killed like dogs.

17
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,965
He goes by Abu Nahar.

18
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:56,268
But based on his accent
and his word choice,

19
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:58,571
it appears he's the first
American in ISIS leadership.

20
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,207
Do we have any idea who the hell he is?

21
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,909
Our prelim analysis suggests
that he's in his 20s,

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,413
a naturalized citizen, and
a fluent, if not native,

23
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:08,747
Arabic speaker.

24
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:10,182
ELIZABETH: An American convert...

25
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:14,353
native in English and
fluent in Egyptian Arabic...

26
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:17,056
that's got to be memorable.

27
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:20,359
Has CIA contacted local
sources on ISIS borders?

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,194
Our field agents are reaching out.

29
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:23,629
JACKSON: The <i>Times</i> has dubbed

30
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,631
this guy "Jihadi Judd,"
and the name's sticking.

31
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,067
MAN: This video has had two million views

32
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,169
since it's been uploaded an hour ago.

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,138
By tomorrow, 50 million will
have watched an American recruit

34
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:34,340
murder his countryman.

35
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,808
Anyone on the fence about joining

36
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,177
the Caliphate just got
a big push toward it.

37
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:39,778
JACKSON: We're rushing to shut down

38
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,780
availability of the video here.

39
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,716
My team's handling international traffic.

40
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:45,150
In the meantime, sir,

41
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,755
I advise evacuating all
federally employed aid workers

42
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:52,424
in and near ISIS territory.

43
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:53,792
Do it.

44
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:55,861
- (bell dings)
- (sighs)

45
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,830
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

46
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,098
I wish I could agree.

47
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,933
I have the number for
Luke Miller's parents

48
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:02,201
when you're ready for
condolences, ma'am.

49
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,436
I have a P.A. working
every international search

50
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,772
and social media platform,
burying that video so deep

51
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:08,540
even Criterion Collection won't find it.

52
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:12,678
Good. Nadine, coordinate
with the Baghdad Embassy

53
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:16,749
and USAID to enforce the
mandatory evacuations.

54
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,184
And line up assistance for NGO workers

55
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:21,654
- heeding our exit recommendation.
- Yes, ma'am.

56
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:24,256
So it's still a voluntary
evacuation for NGO's?

57
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:27,126
Yes, but by the time you
get finished with it,

58
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,360
it won't sound like one.

59
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,596
Also, draft a message
to all state employees

60
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,032
posted in the Middle East
in the past five years.

61
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,935
If anyone recalls an American citizen

62
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:39,772
fluent in Egyptian Arabic
who'd be in his 20s now,

63
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:40,739
bring them to me.

64
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,207
I'll have it out by the hour.

65
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,776
Thank you.

66
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:46,211
- Blake?
- Yes?

67
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,947
(sighs): I, uh...

68
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:49,448
I'm ready for that call.

69
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,482
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:55,219
(soft exhale)

71
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,525
(phone ringing)

72
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:08,299
(sniffs)

73
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:13,571
Hello. Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

74
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:18,610
Here's a list of the NGOs
operating around ISIS territory.

75
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,913
Follow up personally with the
evacuation recommendation.

76
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,448
Quickly.

77
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:23,582
Of course.

78
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I...

79
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,819
I have to talk to Tyler Hogan?

80
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,786
This would be

81
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,188
Tyler "the Hammer" Hogan?

82
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,124
He's very nice if you
get him in a good mood.

83
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,126
How do I do that? Gift basket?

84
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,362
Or should I just throw him
down the <i>Exorcist</i> steps?

85
00:03:36,363 --> 00:03:39,131
He played tennis at Princeton.

86
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:40,833
Start there.

87
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,701
Also, he's an amateur geologist.

88
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:43,869
So the way to his heart

89
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,537
is through tennis and rocks?

90
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,139
(sighs)

91
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,774
You might also remind him

92
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,175
that American lives are at stake.

93
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,549
(airplane flies by overhead) _

94
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,251
(baby crying)

95
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:01,085
(grunting, shouting)

96
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,231
Go ahead and sew him up.

97
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,033
3-0 polysorb.

98
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,967
(alarm beeping)

99
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:20,339
The lung collapsed.
Air's filling his chest.

100
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,868
It's compressing the heart.

101
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:22,602
Chest tube.

102
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:23,395
- Stat.
- We're out.

103
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,437
The shipment didn't come this week.

104
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:27,808
Give me your pen.

105
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,975
Now.

106
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,409
And some iodine.

107
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:36,215
(doctor grunts)

108
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:41,320
(air hissing)

109
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,393
(exhales)

110
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,163
Okay. Now you can sew him up.

111
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,532
MARINE: Is Dr. Adams in there?

112
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,633
William Adams?

113
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,168
We need you at the rendezvous point now.

114
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,437
The evac convoy was supposed
to leave 30 minutes ago.

115
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:58,939
WILL: Ah. No thanks, fellas.

116
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,758
I've got patients.

117
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,174
MARINE 2: Sir, we have specific orders...

118
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,210
You're removing half the
doctors from this camp.

119
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,277
I'm staying.

120
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,312
What...? Oh, come on.

121
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,279
You gotta be kidding me.

122
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,681
Put the pen to a vacuum

123
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,382
for 24 hours, then pull it out, okay?

124
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:10,836
Let go of me!

125
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:12,371
_

126
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:13,453
(knocking at door)

127
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,155
Yeah?

128
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:16,723
Dr. McCord.

129
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:18,024
Can I talk to you?

130
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,127
Come in.

131
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,129
You know, these aren't
my regular office hours,

132
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,197
so from now on, if you
could act like everyone

133
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,466
who just wants to come and talk
about a paper, that'd be helpful.

134
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,034
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,903
The Ministry of Defense

136
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:31,404
is recalling Ivan to Moscow.

137
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:32,805
Did you know about this?

138
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,941
I heard.

139
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,743
Is he a victim of the purge

140
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,245
Maria Ostrov just announced?

141
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,714
Sounds like you're worried that he is.

142
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,850
Her first act as our
newly-elected president

143
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,318
and she's ridding the military

144
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,586
of what she is calling

145
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,854
"foreign agents disseminating
Western propaganda."

146
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:53,460
Tell me what you think that means.

147
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,561
Homosexuals.

148
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,065
Sit.

149
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:04,671
Ivan is a good friend.

150
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:06,873
He lives for the army, for his country.

151
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,808
But recently, there are rumors...

152
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:10,043
Are they just rumors?

153
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:12,546
Ivan would never admit
this directly, of course.

154
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,614
He hides it well, but...

155
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:17,884
he has maybe let his guard
down a little in the U.S.

156
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:20,453
(sighs)

157
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:22,255
And you're afraid he'll
be thrown in prison

158
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,723
because of his sexual orientation.

159
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,725
Jailers don't punish men like Ivan.

160
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,960
They let the other inmates
take care of that.

161
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,430
Can his parents help?

162
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,598
You said they're political royalty.

163
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,867
His father would rather see his son dead

164
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,167
than exposed as gay.

165
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:37,671
You must protect him.

166
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,407
I'm very sorry, Dmitri,

167
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:43,246
but Ivan's just a student here.

168
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:45,345
Oh, he doesn't have a deal
with the devil like I do.

169
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,948
I think maybe you're
misidentifying the devil.

170
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,916
I know this is a shameful
aspect of my country.

171
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,084
And this is how

172
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,285
you persuaded me to work for you,

173
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,553
to change things like this.

174
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,854
But what-what good is this job

175
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:56,223
if I can't help save my friend?

176
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,991
- There's a bigger picture.
- You have a home.

177
00:06:57,992 --> 00:06:59,392
A wife, children.

178
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,527
I am here. Alone.

179
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:01,661
Who can I talk to?

180
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,729
Talk to me.

181
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,730
You had me interrogated

182
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,265
by Americans posing as FSB.

183
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,499
Half the time, I don't know

184
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,834
if you're helping me
or trying to kill me.

185
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,002
You need to calm down.

186
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:10,103
We have been through this.

187
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:11,404
You know that I'm your ally here.

188
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:12,372
Then, please,

189
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,773
help Ivan.

190
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:15,408
I can't lose the closest friend

191
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,942
I have in this country.

192
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,848
Let me see what I can do.

193
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:26,319
We are not going to do anything.

194
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,787
Ivan's persona non grata at the Kremlin.

195
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,682
It's a good thing you moved
us off of recruiting him.

196
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,890
Without Ivan's friendship,

197
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,226
I am very worried about Dmitri's
psychological well-being.

198
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:34,794
Funny. It's the thought
of Maria Ostrov's finger

199
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:36,429
over the red button that
keeps me up at night.

200
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,731
Right, exactly.

201
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:39,199
That's why we should use
every resource we have

202
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,328
to make sure that doesn't happen.

203
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,901
Turn around this whole situation

204
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,069
in Eastern Europe.

205
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,471
Tell me you agree with
me on that, please.

206
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:46,239
Okay, you are getting way
out of your depth, here.

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,341
- You gotta back off.
- Look, if-if Dmitri snaps,

208
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,509
we lose an asset

209
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,610
who is poised to rise

210
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,012
through the ranks of
the Russian military.

211
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,847
Okay, all the more reason
not to compromise him

212
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,782
just to try to save a
random junior officer.

213
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,851
Look, I know we have other
agents in the Russian army.

214
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,152
There's got to be a lever we can pull

215
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,654
- to keep Ivan at the War College.
- Henry!

216
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:03,456
I am not risking any DIA assets on this.

217
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:04,491
End of discussion.

218
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:05,892
Then take it out of DIA's hands.

219
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,727
We get Ivan asylum in the U.S.

220
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,562
Oh, great. We bring State
into DIA business.

221
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:10,630
It works.

222
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,232
To Ivan, I'm a concerned professor

223
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,867
with the resources to help.

224
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,603
Wow. Backing off really
is not your gift, is it?

225
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:19,506
You asked me to handle Dmitri.

226
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,340
Let me do my job.

227
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:26,146
DIA's prints are nowhere.

228
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:27,847
You just play

229
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:29,082
the sympathetic professor card.

230
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,382
That is it.

231
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:38,358
NADINE: His name is Adam Fanning.

232
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,226
He's the son of Judith Fanning,

233
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,363
a State Department employee
in the Near East Bureau.

234
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:45,265
Are you sure?

235
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,934
She was stationed in Cairo for six years.

236
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,736
Adam grew up there.

237
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,037
And learned Arabic

238
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:52,539
at the American International School.

239
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,573
DAISY: That's right.

240
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,208
He returned here for high school.

241
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,711
His father died in a car accident.

242
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,579
A few months later,
Adam converted to Islam.

243
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,114
He went back to Egypt for college

244
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,516
and dropped out two years
later to join ISIS.

245
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:06,853
I'm guessing his mother
didn't give us any of this.

246
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,122
No, but she certainly got the memo.

247
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,056
Is she in today?

248
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:12,024
No, she works part-time.

249
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,962
Bring her in. Quietly.

250
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:18,098
If she's colluding with her son,

251
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,833
we can't risk spooking her.

252
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,533
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,408
(door closes)

254
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:33,146
- Ms. Fanning.
- Yes?

255
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,742
Nadine Tolliver, Secretary
McCord's chief of staff.

256
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,708
- I-I think we've met before.
- Yes, of course.

257
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,385
Yes, that's right.

258
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,120
Thank you, guys.

259
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,488
Can you tell me what's going on?

260
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,858
I mean, I was told that I was
covering for a sick co-worker.

261
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,260
Um, the secretary will fill you in.

262
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:50,029
The secretary?

263
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,831
Egyptian embassy party a few years back.

264
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:54,267
That is definitely,
definitely where we met.

265
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,436
Ah. Yes.

266
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,070
This way.

267
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,374
- (door opens)
- NADINE: Madam Secretary,

268
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,975
this is Judith Fanning.

269
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,278
Madam Secretary.

270
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,313
Ms. Fanning.

271
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:08,415
By now, you've realized

272
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,916
I haven't called you in to do work.

273
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,584
Is something wrong?

274
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,887
I'm going to cut to the chase.

275
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:16,256
Have you seen the ISIS beheading video

276
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,624
that was released earlier today?

277
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,359
No.

278
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,760
No, I haven't looked at my computer.

279
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,061
Not on the news?

280
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:23,296
Mm-mm.

281
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:26,999
I'm sorry, is this about
my Syrian arms brief?

282
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:31,837
I'm gonna need you to watch this video.

283
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,276
Okay.

284
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,918
President Dalton,

285
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,253
your air strikes bring
pain upon your people

286
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,755
and death to your troops.

287
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:51,056
(man speaking Arabic)

288
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:00,967
Just as you execute our warriors,

289
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:04,037
we will exterminate all
so-called American aid workers

290
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,072
within our borders.

291
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,907
They are heathens

292
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,943
and puppets of American intelligence

293
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:11,777
and will be killed like dogs.

294
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,685
You recognize that man's voice?

295
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:20,953
(gasps)

296
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,229
ELIZABETH: <i>He returned
to Egypt for college</i>

297
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,496
as the Arab Spring began.

298
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,332
He became radicalized after falling in

299
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,499
with the Muslim Brotherhood.

300
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,036
Does the mother have any
idea where he might be?

301
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,872
No, they lost touch a year ago.

302
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,107
The FBI is interrogating her right now.

303
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:53,644
All of our intelligence
agencies are into it.

304
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,046
Should we be talking about
putting his name out there?

305
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,848
Or releasing a photo?

306
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,850
I'd advise against it.

307
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,919
There's a tactical advantage
to holding our cards.

308
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,953
The safer he feels,

309
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,555
the more likely he is to screw up.

310
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,958
And if we I.D. him, we reveal
his affiliation with State.

311
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,527
Which is an even bigger coup for ISIS.

312
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:12,429
The first American-born

313
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,899
ISIS leader with direct ties
to the State Department?

314
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,600
It's hard to bounce back from that.

315
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,569
That is not my primary concern.

316
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,204
Well, nor mine, but it's in the equation.

317
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:23,540
I don't give a crap about the
political equation, Russell!

318
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,309
I want him to stop cutting off

319
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,278
innocent American heads
and broadcasting it

320
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,612
all over the world!

321
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:31,348
I want this son of a
bitch either captured

322
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:34,584
or killed and I don't give a damn which!

Madam Secretary, I'd like

Madam Secretary; a real

Honestly, you couldn't have

Sorry, ma'am.

00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,406
- We thought he was...
- A crazy person?

Yeah, I know, he is.

Good night.

341
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,448
Don't keep Marines waiting

342
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,716
when they are trying
to save your sorry ass.

343
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,285
Oh, is that what they were doing?

344
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:39,820
Looked more like ditching people in need.

345
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:41,855
Shut up.

346
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:44,090
You promised me you would
stay out of conflict zones.

347
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,059
I said I'd try to stay out
of the conflict zones.

348
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,730
By working in a camp right on
the border of ISIS territory?

349
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,732
They just announced their intent

350
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,434
to kill all American aid workers.

351
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,392
I-I have my U.K. passport.

352
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:57,938
Do you know the position
you would put me in

353
00:13:57,939 --> 00:13:59,172
- if you got kidnapped?
- Oh, come on.

354
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,307
The position you'd put your government in?

355
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:01,541
Come on, I am not that important.

356
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,410
- To people looking for leverage you are.
- Oh!

357
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:05,579
You are the Secretary of State's brother!

358
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,013
Not when I started this job.

- Emphasis on "dragged."

363
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:16,256
- Touchy subject. - I'm surprised
she waited this long actually.

364
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:17,624
- Yeah.
- You good? Come on, have some dinner.

365
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,326
- No, no, this isn't a friendly...
- STEVIE: Uncle Will?

366
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,727
- Hey!
- Hi!

367
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,796
- Oh, my God!
- What are you going here?

368
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,632
- My favorite niece.
- Oh, my God, you are too skinny.

369
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:26,700
Well, look who's talking.

370
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,735
Are-are Aunt Sophie and Annie with you?

371
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,337
No, they're-they're in London.

372
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,938
Well, do you have pictures of them?

373
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,441
- I have a few.
- Come on, show them at dinner.

374
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,710
- Come on!
- Okay.

375
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,111
Now, if you get the knife point

376
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,447
right behind the posterior dorsal region...

377
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:41,715
You mean the wing.

378
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,984
...you maximize the amount of meat.

379
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,819
Let nothing go to waste.

380
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,521
What do they feed you guys at the camps?

381
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,256
Well, nothing like this feast.

382
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:51,992
Mostly rice. Maybe some beans

383
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:54,394
if the convoy hasn't been
hijacked or the roads bombed.

384
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,220
STEVIE: Well, Jason freaks out

385
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:58,365
if the pizza takes more than
half an hour to deliver.

386
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,332
Really?

387
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,534
They made a guarantee.

388
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:01,968
I like to hold our
institutions accountable.

389
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,404
Well, tell your mother that.

390
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,705
Oh, don't, Will.

391
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,907
Don't what?

392
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,575
WILL: She doesn't want to be reminded

393
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:11,745
that her boss' administration
spends exponentially more

394
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,747
on bombing Syria than
feeding the civilians

395
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,081
they're supposedly protecting.

396
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,117
We haven't seen each
other in over a year.

397
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,985
Can we try and enjoy dinner?

398
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,020
You're right.

399
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:22,789
Dinner is a luxury.

400
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,824
The Syrians I know are so starved,

401
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,293
they sell their refrigerators
for a few bucks

402
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:27,494
just to survive the week.

403
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,262
HENRY: I guess this would
be a bad time to ask

404
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,597
if anybody wants some mashed potatoes.

405
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:31,865
Look, I want to get rid of ISIS

406
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,034
as much as the next guy,
but at a certain point...

407
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,502
Really? Because I'm
actually one of the guys

408
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,704
tasked with doing it, so trust me

409
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,574
when I tell you that it's a
little bit more complicated

410
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,609
than your simplistic view.

411
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,743
- Whoa. Point, Mom.
- You can't imagine

412
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,712
from your high perch inside the Beltway,

413
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,480
the things I see on the ground.

414
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,215
You wouldn't last five minutes

415
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,850
dealing with the big picture dynamics

416
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,552
- of my job.
- You're right.

417
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,621
I am not a bureaucrat.
I actually help people.

418
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,655
- You want to go there?
- Yeah.

419
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,324
Well, here we are

420
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,413
in your fancy Georgetown
mansion, let's go.

421
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,781
I should've left you over there.

422
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:01,432
You should have.

423
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,949
Hey, you guys want to save
some of this for Christmas?

424
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,669
Is this what we sound
like when we fight?

425
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,034
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Yes.

426
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:10,707
I'm sorry.

427
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:15,413
You know what the problem is, right?

428
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:17,281
If you tell me it's because
we're too much alike

429
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,046
I'm gonna throw something at you.

430
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,226
Besides that.

431
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:23,562
There-there's a lot of
pressure on your relationship.

432
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:25,877
You-you were young
when your parents died.

433
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,200
It's not that!

434
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,105
Okay.

435
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:33,063
The problem is he's a
narcissistic adrenaline junkie.

436
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:36,384
Did you know that he hasn't been
back to see Sophie in months.

437
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:39,248
The truth is...

438
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,483
he doesn't want to go home.

439
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,721
I'm not the one that
needs to hear all this.

440
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:47,355
Like I could ever get him to
talk to me about this stuff.

441
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,926
Okay, why don't you
take him fly fishing?

442
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,694
With what time?

443
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:52,929
Just find it.

444
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,132
For some reason that I will
never fully understand,

445
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,167
that whole river thing

446
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:01,437
seems to move your WASP-y souls, so...

447
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,039
Connecting is a lot easier

448
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,876
when you're not having
to look at each other.

449
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:10,113
(both laugh)

450
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,482
All right.

451
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,883
I'll see if he bites.

452
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:17,353
Aw, good.

453
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,122
Oh, hey, listen.

454
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,891
I have this very promising

455
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,260
Russian student who's
getting recalled to Moscow

456
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,962
by Ostrov for being gay.

457
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,398
And this kid is so duty-bound,

458
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:29,999
he'll take his fate on the chin.

459
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,735
If he makes an asylum request,

460
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:33,870
will you vouch for it?

461
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:36,339
Is he afraid for his safety?

462
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,808
- Babe, it's...
- Of course he is.

463
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,044
And he's still willing to go back.

464
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,412
Mm-hmm.

465
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:44,981
Ostrov is losing a good
soldier for nothing.

466
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,182
Yeah.

467
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:49,485
And one brave enough to be
out in the Russian army?

468
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,288
- Wow.
- Actually, he's not out.

469
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,757
Well, Henry,

470
00:17:54,758 --> 00:17:57,093
he's gonna have to cite homosexuality

471
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,996
as his reason for asylum.

472
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,098
Okay, I'll have to
convince him to do that.

473
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,068
If you do, then, yeah,
I'll do whatever I can.

474
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,702
- (cell phone ringing)
- Oh, it's your boyfriend.

475
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:11,841
That's-that's so funny.

476
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,510
Hey, Russell, what's up?

477
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,480
The FBI found evidence in
Judith Fanning's bank records

478
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:21,451
that she provided material
support to terrorists.

479
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:22,652
What?! (stammers)

480
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,253
What kind?

481
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:26,823
Her son Adam contacted
her six months ago.

482
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:29,792
She admitted to sending him $8,000.

483
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,761
Oh, come on.

484
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:37,168
She's adamant the money
didn't go to ISIS.

485
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,838
Well, the FBI report backs that.

486
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,314
She's not ideologically
aligned with her son.

487
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,410
Yet she lied about not talking to him.

488
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:48,780
And she refuses to say what
the money was actually for.

489
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:52,217
What else if not to
support the caliphate?

490
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,386
There aren't exactly malls

491
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,921
in the Syro-Arabian desert.

492
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:58,857
Well, they were estranged.

493
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,525
And reached out.

494
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:03,361
Guilt is a powerful thing.

495
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:06,765
Guilt over being a
single, working mother?

496
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,266
Yes.

497
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:11,636
But the husband's death
complicates things.

498
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:13,104
How?

499
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:14,572
I thought it was a car accident.

500
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,776
I remembered the circumstances
when I reviewed her file.

501
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:20,779
He lost control of the
car due to a seizure

502
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,647
caused by Huntington's disease.

503
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:25,917
He was barely 43 years old.

504
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:29,120
And he'd been misdiagnosed
for almost two years.

505
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:32,524
My understanding is
that she blames herself

506
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,526
for not catching it sooner.

507
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,462
That is a morbid detail to note.

508
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:38,763
Too thorough?

509
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,699
No.

510
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,367
I think you might actually
be onto something.

511
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:45,512
_

512
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:52,343
Madam Secretary.

513
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:55,280
Well, I-I-I didn't realize
you would be the closer.

514
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,582
When my own employee lies to my face,

515
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,416
I like to find out why.

516
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:06,857
I can't help you.

517
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:09,861
'Cause you want to kill my son.

518
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:14,332
I want to stop him from
killing innocent people.

519
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,302
You should, too.

520
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,571
I want my son back.

521
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:21,839
The-the way that he was.

522
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:27,679
Before he became radicalized or...

523
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,882
before you found out he
had Huntington's disease?

524
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:34,552
Early onset sufferers are likely

525
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,554
to have children who exhibit

526
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,024
symptoms even earlier.

527
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:42,860
Is that what happened to Adam?

528
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,900
Last year, he e-mailed.

529
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,569
He wanted to talk about
his father's symptoms.

530
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,272
So we Skyped.

531
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:56,141
And-and there he was.

532
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:57,975
He was shaking like a leaf.

533
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:02,614
Did he say where he was
or who he'd been with?

534
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,481
Nothing.

535
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,453
I told you I will be no help.

536
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:09,988
Your computer records

537
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:12,023
show that shortly before
you sent the money,

538
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:15,260
you searched online for
information on a drug.

539
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:16,728
Tetrabenazine.

540
00:21:16,729 --> 00:21:19,230
It's the only medicine proven

541
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:22,867
to curb early onset spasms.

542
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,969
That's what the money
was for, wasn't it?

543
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:32,843
I-I know what Adam did was unforgivable.

544
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:37,015
But he's still my son.

545
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:38,783
Just promise me

546
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:41,920
that you'll give him a chance.

547
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,388
Promise to...

548
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,857
(crying): that you won't kill him?

549
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,128
I'm sorry.

550
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:53,915
_

551
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:06,655
- Hey.
- Hey.

552
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:07,989
Call Nadine.

553
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,431
Get her into tracking

554
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,134
any plausible source of tetrabenazine

555
00:22:12,135 --> 00:22:13,468
entering ISIS territory.

556
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:14,770
- Tetra...
- She'll know.

557
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:16,104
Okay.

558
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:19,141
And make it clear... no one
outside our inner circle

559
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,409
knows why we're looking into it.

560
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,610
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

561
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:23,412
Interpol picked up a
pair of American kids

562
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:26,681
at the Frankfurt airport
headed for the Syrian front.

563
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:29,051
(sighs) Jihadi Judd fans?

564
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:30,652
Yeah, it's in the news now.

565
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,821
The country's frightened.

566
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:35,090
The president needs this guy
wrapped up. Yesterday.

567
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:37,359
Yeah, I know, we're gonna follow
this lead as far as it'll go.

568
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,660
Hey, did you pack my gear?

569
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:41,363
Uh, yes, ma'am, the line,
leader, tippet and waders.

570
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:42,998
- Great.
- You're going fishing?

571
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,634
It's a peacekeeping mission.

572
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,369
And I won't be long.

573
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,637
It's called multitasking.

574
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,242
WILL: Ah, it's just
like the good old days.

575
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:57,546
You, me, elements of nature

576
00:22:57,547 --> 00:23:00,916
and an entire mobile
State Department office.

577
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:03,652
Are you actually sore with me
for checking in at the office,

578
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,587
or are you just looking for an excuse

579
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:07,756
when you don't catch anything?

580
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:11,059
I believe I hold the
extended family record

581
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,562
for most fish caught in a single outing.

582
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:16,331
ELIZABETH: Ha. I can't
wait to compare memoirs.

583
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,966
Bring it on.

584
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,037
Sophie and I talk, you know?

585
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:24,706
Says Annie's starting to ask questions,

586
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:27,042
about where you are.

587
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:28,710
So what's going on?

588
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,579
Why don't you want to go home?

589
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,515
Now, see, I didn't think
you'd lead with that.

590
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:35,884
I thought you'd start
with how my crazy desire

591
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:37,986
to save the world is interfering

592
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:40,122
with your crazy desire to save the world.

593
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:42,424
That's just work stuff.

594
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:44,292
Family's the real deal.

595
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:46,061
Somebody has to do this
kind of work, Lizzie,

596
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,762
or it doesn't get done.

597
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:51,666
It's all part of a bigger plan
to make everyone's life better.

598
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:55,103
Sometimes you just have to miss
show-and-tell at kindergarten.

599
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:57,739
You know, you've always been really good

600
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,407
at doing whatever you want.

601
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:00,509
(chuckles)

602
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,544
An expert at justifying it.

603
00:24:02,545 --> 00:24:04,546
Look who's talking.

604
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,181
What?

605
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:08,416
I gave up a station chief
position in Baghdad

606
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,918
- Oh, well, that settles it.
- for my family.

607
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,553
- You win.
- Hey, don't be a chump.

608
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:12,853
Don't be a scorekeeper.

609
00:24:15,724 --> 00:24:18,226
I was never 100% about having kids

610
00:24:18,227 --> 00:24:19,461
'cause I knew I couldn't change.

611
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:20,595
I told her that.

612
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:22,697
That was the deal.

613
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:24,566
That's what Sophie's not telling you.

614
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,801
We had an agreement.

615
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,437
Yeah, she'd stay home
with the kid, while you...

616
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:31,540
Run around the world, removing
shrapnel from the stomachs

617
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,074
of other people's kids, yeah.

618
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:36,011
And there is something to be said

619
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:39,014
for teaching your kids that
someone is willing to be there

620
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,982
to take care of the people
that war leaves behind.

621
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:46,655
You were doing pretty good
right up to that point.

622
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:47,689
Yeah, I pushed it, didn't I?

623
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,224
Yep.

624
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:50,325
Whoa.

625
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:51,293
You need a hand?

626
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:53,562
No, thanks.

627
00:24:53,563 --> 00:24:55,362
Whoa.

628
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:00,968
- (laughs)
- (Will whistles)

629
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:05,974
Candice.

630
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:07,409
How nice to see you again.

631
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,677
Yes, hey.

632
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:10,645
I think you know Blake Moran,

633
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,047
assistant to the secretary.

634
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:13,882
You really needed to
double-team me, Nadine?

635
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:17,452
Oh, nonsense, I'm just mentoring.

636
00:25:17,453 --> 00:25:19,020
I've already heard.

637
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:21,790
You want me for some wild
medicine chase in Syria.

638
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:26,261
Meanwhile, I've just gotten
through evacuating 200 Americans

639
00:25:26,262 --> 00:25:29,698
from ISIS territory using
spit and chewing gum,

640
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,167
because, as usual, I didn't have
funding for it in my budget.

641
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:34,436
Well, the secretary is very grateful.

642
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:38,505
For this request, she'd
like to sweeten the deal.

643
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:41,109
How?

644
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,411
Funding for your Nigerian
alfalfa initiative.

645
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,113
Just like we discussed.

646
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:46,514
Last year.

647
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:48,750
Nigeria's had zero rain since.

648
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:52,153
Plus, agricultural projects
in sub-Saharan Africa

649
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:54,121
haven't cleared the Hill in months.

650
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:56,925
(clears throat)

651
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:59,594
There must be, uh, something we can do.

652
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:03,898
This is a very, very important request.

653
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:05,900
All your requests are important.

654
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:07,469
And yet I can't get an answer

655
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,404
from the seventh floor as to why.

656
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:11,405
Can you tell me what this is for?

657
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,779
No wonder the world
thinks we're a CIA front.

658
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,814
Okay, Candice.

659
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:22,983
Name your price.

660
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:25,853
What do you want?

661
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,623
_

662
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,102
_

663
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:33,582
_

664
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:37,746
_

665
00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:41,898
_

666
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:48,942
_

667
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:51,371
_

668
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,207
_

669
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,581
_

670
00:26:56,972 --> 00:26:58,184
_

671
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:01,791
_

672
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,522
_

673
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,855
_

674
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:08,980
_

675
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:12,683
_

676
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:14,202
(knocking on door)

677
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:16,204
(door opens)

678
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:18,005
Dmitri? Hello, Ivan.

679
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,841
Dr. McCord.

680
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,446
I am afraid I am busy.

681
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:26,648
I invited him here.

682
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:29,283
He can help.

683
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,921
_

684
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,124
HENRY: I'm here with an offer.

685
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,559
Would you like to hear it?

686
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,863
Dmitri tells me you're in a
very dangerous situation.

687
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:44,032
You face a public trial

688
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:45,700
designed to humiliate
you and your family,

689
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:48,335
a dishonorable discharge
and a prison term.

690
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,107
This is a big misunderstanding.

691
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:55,276
Dmitri has interfered

692
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:57,545
unnecessarily.

693
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:00,181
HENRY: Dmitri came to me
to help save your life.

694
00:28:00,182 --> 00:28:01,816
With my ties to the State Department,

695
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:03,718
I can guarantee you an asylum hearing.

696
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,787
But in order for the
application to go through,

697
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:08,089
you have to tell the
truth about who you are.

698
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,659
I am a Russian captain in the army.

699
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,896
I serve under General
Vladimir Doroshevich.

700
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:17,764
I only follow his orders.

701
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:25,339
I have no life if I am not a soldier.

702
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:29,544
Then talk to Doroshevich before
he leaves DC for Moscow tonight.

703
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:31,179
He respects you.

704
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,480
And tell him what?

705
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:34,749
HENRY: Ask him to intervene
with the recall on your behalf,

706
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,519
make a case for your
dedication and commitment.

707
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,888
I understand that
Doroshevich is a fair man.

708
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:42,756
I think he'd want to keep a good soldier.

709
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:52,233
Look, I don't want to
get sappy or anything.

710
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:53,934
Thank God.

711
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:57,472
I honestly...

712
00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:59,374
respect the work that you do.

713
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:03,645
And I know that it's
dangerous and exhausting,

714
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,380
and you have limited resources.

715
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:06,748
(chuckles)

716
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:08,383
And from where you're standing,

717
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:12,353
it can look like the people
who create policy don't care.

718
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:16,191
Well... at the very least,

719
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,759
don't understand.

720
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,166
So how do you do it?

721
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,202
What part?

722
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:28,503
All of it.

723
00:29:28,504 --> 00:29:32,106
How do you perform surgery?

724
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:35,477
Well, first you wash your hands...

725
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:37,078
- No, dumbass.
- then you, uh...

726
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,379
I mean over there.

727
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,383
Yeah, like, how do you... how
do you make it work over there?

728
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:44,385
To the extent that it does.

729
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:46,321
Improvisation.

730
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:49,390
You never have enough
medicine or equipment,

731
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:54,028
so you're constantly thinking
of ways to create fixes,

732
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:57,131
ways that you probably
don't want to know about.

733
00:29:57,132 --> 00:30:00,768
Don't tell me you're meeting
people in parking garages

734
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,103
and back alleys or...

735
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,404
No.

736
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:05,507
No, there's a courier in our area.

737
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:08,476
He knows how to navigate the system.

738
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:12,514
The irony is... the more
chaotic the system,

739
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:15,149
the more effective the underground.

740
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,854
Black market ticks along in
places like Syria and Iraq.

741
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:23,157
The NGO folks don't
like to talk about it,

742
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:27,762
but corruption is what
holds everything together.

743
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:31,466
But then how can you trust any of it?

744
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,201
I mean, like, this courier,

745
00:30:33,202 --> 00:30:34,836
he's dealing in stolen cargo?

746
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:36,070
How do you...?

747
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,872
Well, this guy is a former medic,

748
00:30:37,873 --> 00:30:41,910
so he's got a lot of real shady clients.

749
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,977
And he's been vetted to high heaven.

750
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:48,416
We figure that if it works for them,

751
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,084
works for us.

752
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,719
"Them" meaning who?

753
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,420
ISIS?

754
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,990
We don't ask.

755
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,328
NADINE: <i>Welcome back, ma'am.</i>

756
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:01,629
How was fishing?

757
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,797
Productive.

758
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,032
How'd it go here?

759
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:08,036
Well, we had a protracted
negotiation with USAID,

760
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:10,772
but we do believe we found
the source of the medicine.

761
00:31:10,773 --> 00:31:12,740
Yes, there's a hospital in Antakya

762
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:15,777
that's seen a spike in
orders of tetrabenazine.

763
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:19,147
Padding their stocks in case
some of it falls off the truck.

764
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,782
Exactly.

765
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:23,117
Well, this is great, because
I have to tell you,

766
00:31:23,118 --> 00:31:26,454
I think that I may have figured out

767
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:30,258
how the medicine gets from
there to ISIS leadership.

768
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,559
Huh.

769
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,895
ELIZABETH: Really good, guys, really good.

770
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:38,199
I mean... great work with USAID.

771
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,867
- Not easy.
- (zipper zips)

772
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:42,870
But I do have a queasy feeling

773
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:44,973
that we may owe them something.

774
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:48,610
Um, ma'am, you have

775
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,946
a three-hour dinner next
week with Candice Templeton.

776

777
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:57,785
However did you manage to find
the time in my schedule, Blake?

778
00:31:57,786 --> 00:31:59,087
That's my superpower.

779
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:02,824
Let's hope that your
superpower pays off.

780
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:05,493
Will you get me Director
Williams on the telephone?

781
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:06,894
BLAKE: Yes, ma'am.

782
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:10,263

What do you have, Sean?

805
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:44,140
We cross-referenced the
medical NGOs in Aleppo.

806
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:46,976
Several ID'd a courier
fitting the description

807
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:48,010
Secretary McCord gave us.

808
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:49,912
The man we're looking for

809
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:51,414
is Tariq Mansour.

810
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:53,315
With the help of HUMINT

811
00:34:53,316 --> 00:34:56,485
in Turkey and Syria, we
tracked his supply chain.

812
00:34:56,486 --> 00:34:59,688
<i>Every order starts out smuggled
by an underling of Mansour's</i>

813
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:02,725
<i>from Devlet Arastirma
hospital in Antakya, Turkey.</i>

<i>through the Turkish-Syrian border here,</i>

816
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:08,097
at Bab Al-Hawa.

817
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:10,099
Now, the border's known to be porous,

818
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,135
but these guys have greased every wheel.

819
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:15,938
Then it's on to Aleppo,

820
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,306
<i>where Mansour's underlings</i>

DALTON: Contact Nellis.

832

I want a drone on this courier

833
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,035
the minute he heads east from Aleppo.

834
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:47,000
Yes, sir.

835
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,438
We'll let you know as soon as
he's in ISIS territory.

836

(students murmur quietly)

837
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:55,109
We did this to him.

838
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,881
Why did I say anything?

839
00:35:58,882 --> 00:35:59,915
This is my fault.

840
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:01,383
No, it's not.

841
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:02,585
No, it is this coup.

These-these... these power-starved men

843
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:06,155
and their straw dog, Maria Ostrov.

844
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:07,456
They will not stop until
they take us back

845
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,158
- to the days of Stalin.
- Okay, come on. Come with me.

846
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,626
We can talk about this later.

847
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,194
No, we're not going to
talk about this later.

848
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:13,629
- We're gonna talk about it now.
- Just keep walking, okay?

849
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,130
- You need to calm down.
- No, I am through with Russia!

850
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,432
I am through with Russia, okay?

851
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:18,234
I want to take the deal
that you offered Ivan.

852
00:36:18,235 --> 00:36:19,702
Let me defect. Give me asylum.

853
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:20,653
That's not possible.

854
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:21,315
What? Why?

855
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:22,196
Because for five minutes

856
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:24,639
I had some crazy idea
that I could be a spy?

857
00:36:25,654 --> 00:36:26,775
I want out.

858
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,077
I want to stay here.

859
00:36:28,078 --> 00:36:30,513
Okay.

860
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,846
You can take Ivan's place.

861
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,016
But not by defecting.

862
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:35,784
Not by giving up.

863
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:38,254
What do you want me to do?

864
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:40,489
Tell General Doroshevich
to recall <i>you</i> to Moscow,

865
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,857
to work by his side.

866
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:44,460
That's where you can
really make a difference.

Who is he talking to?

877
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:37,479
The next link in the chain.

878
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,249
Colonel, can we have
a closer view of the man

879
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,784
Mansour is talking to? Over.

881

That's Fanning.

883
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,696
I'll be damned.

884
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:55,130
We have a clean shot, Mr. President.

885
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:57,533
We can take him out now,
along with the courier.

886
00:37:57,534 --> 00:37:58,934
Or we can grab him up.

887

How long to get Delta in there?

888
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,705
Assault team's 40 minutes out, sir.

889
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:04,940
That's possibly enough
time to take him alive.

890

Someone at Fanning's level

891
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:09,411
could have significant
intelligence on ISIS.

892
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,280
JACKSON: Or the raid goes south,

893
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:15,149

Jihadi Judd's next victims.

Delta will have to pass through

897
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:35,975
three security rings.

898
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:43,884
Take him out, Admiral.

899
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:45,886
Colonel, engage target.

900
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:47,454
Over.

901
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:48,922
COLONEL: Copy. Missile on the way.

902
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:50,991
Time of flight: eight seconds.

903
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:52,759
Seven.

904
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,927
Six.

905
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:54,928
Five.

906
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:55,929
Four.

907
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,930
Three.

908
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:58,665
(whooshing sound)

909
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,500
One.

910
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:01,501
Target hit.

911
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:03,470
Over.

912
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:06,005
PARKER: Copy.

913
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,842
Mr. President, I recommend

914
00:39:08,843 --> 00:39:12,012
addressing the nation immediately.

915
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:14,614
Release Fanning's identity
and confirm the kill.

916
00:39:14,615 --> 00:39:17,217
Set it up.

917
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:18,685
Thank you, everyone.

918
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:19,920
Good work.

919
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,454
Bess, I'd, uh,

920
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:23,456
I'd like you to stand with
me during the address.

921
00:39:23,457 --> 00:39:25,324
Of course, sir.

922
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:37,304
Thank you, Eddie.

923
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:38,671
Good night.

924
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:44,277
- Hi.
- Hey. - Hey.

925
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:45,912
You guys are up late.

926
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:48,181
Yeah, we, uh, saw you
with the president.

927
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,983
(sighs) Yeah.

928
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:51,953
Were you in the Situation Room for it?

929
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:52,650
JASON: Yes!

930
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,188
Yes! We freakin' lit up Jihadi Judd.

931
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:57,266
- It was like... (mimics explosion)
- HENRY: Jason!

932
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:58,091
Cut it out!

933
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:00,059
It wasn't a video game. Go to your room.

934
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:04,064
I mean, it was a drone strike,

935
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:06,465
- so it kind of...
- Jason.

936
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:10,002
How did you guys even find him?

937
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,072
Go ahead.

938
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:13,572
Tell them how you found him.

939
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:16,409
Will you guys please go to bed?

940
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,444
Yeah.

941
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,378
Come on, guys, let's go upstairs.

942
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,284
WILL: You used me.

943
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:25,252
You exploited a moment

944
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:26,564
of what I thought was real connection

945
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:28,121
for your own gain.

946
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:30,056
My gain?

947
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:32,993
Adam Fanning waged war on our country.

948
00:40:32,994 --> 00:40:35,161
And-and my courier?

949
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:36,965
What was he, just-just
"collateral damage"?

950
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,032
He sells drugs for ISIS.
Have you even seen the...

951
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,500
You knew that he was
the only decent source

952
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:43,036
of rare pharma in Western Syria.

953
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:44,671
People, regular people, children

954
00:40:44,672 --> 00:40:46,473
are going to die without his drugs.

955
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:48,275
I know that.

956
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:49,943
And...?

957
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,378
And I also know

958
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,280
that someone else is
gonna fill his shoes.

959
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:56,215
So... so the Syrian civilians,
they mean nothing to you.

960
00:40:58,218 --> 00:40:59,219
(laughs bitterly)

961
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,388
Yes, you got me.

962
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:05,025
Human life has no value to me.

963
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:06,426
Go ahead.

964
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:08,928
I mean, reduce the entire world's

965
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:10,363
most complex situations

966
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:12,799
into sweeping generalities.

967
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,601
As opposed to justifying everything

968
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,903
in the name of national security?

969
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,772
I know the costs.

970
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:23,743
I see every horrible angle.

971
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:26,946
I just don't have the luxury of
being an island like you do.

972
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:30,050
Well, maybe the world
would be better off

973
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:32,886
if your angles got the
hell off of my island.

974
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:34,888
Because let's be clear, here.

975
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,589
You didn't pull me off of the job

976
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,325
for the benefit of humankind.

977
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:39,726
This was about you.

978
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:43,196
You and-and your lifelong

979
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:45,165
panic about... about...

980
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,033
Something happening to you?

981
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:50,169
Yes.

982
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:54,606
Yeah, I'll cop to that one.

983
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:05,685
Here.

984
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:09,089
It's a ticket to Ankara.

985
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,824
You leave first thing.

986
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:12,625
From there, a convoy
will take you to Aleppo

987
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:14,828
and you can go back to
doing what you were doing.

988
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:18,765
A... A layover in London?

989
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:20,866
You-you couldn't resist, could you?

990
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:23,803
It's not for you.

991
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:25,204
It's for Annie.

992
00:42:27,307 --> 00:42:29,608
(sighs)

993
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:32,712
(Elizabeth sighs)

994
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:35,714
That sounded like the
opposite of fly fishing.

995
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:40,420
Can we talk about it later?

996
00:42:40,421 --> 00:42:42,688
(sighs)

997
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:49,595
I'm sorry about Ivan.

998
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:53,433
Me, too.

999
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:56,836
Did he have something
to do with your job?

1000
00:42:56,837 --> 00:42:58,772
The one we don't talk about?

1001
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:01,073
(sighs heavily)

1002
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:05,644
Sorry. I don't mean to push.

1003
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:15,455
When you were an operative,

1004
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:17,390
how did you know

1005
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:19,725
when you were in too deep?

1006
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:25,365
I didn't.

1007
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:28,000
Not until it was too late.

1008
00:43:34,937 --> 00:43:41,983
_ _
