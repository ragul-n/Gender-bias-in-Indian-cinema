00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:07,792
DETECTIVE
JUNIOR

2
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:20,000
(song playing)

3
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,583
Is it a parent's favorite hobby
to irritate their child?

4
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,417
"Elementary, dear Watson."

5
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,542
We're truth-seekers.

6
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,458
That's why we're trying to find out
our would be daughter-in-law's name.

7
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,542
Well, if I was Ms. Marple or Mitin Mashi...

8
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,958
this mystery...

9
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,500
would have been solved long ago.

10
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,083
If detectives didn't get carried away
with words...

11
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,833
they'd be able to crack the case
in the very first scene.

12
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,250
Who is the lady?

13
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,167
Dad, concentrate on the driving.

14
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,583
I don't have any lady in my life.

15
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,375
Doctor, what's your diagnosis?

16
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,375
Don't the pupil's look dilated?

17
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,500
When someone falls in love...

18
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,125
the brain releases oxytocin
and dopamine...

19
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,667
telling us that someone...

20
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,917
has become the apple of our eye.

21
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,083
Pupils get dilated
when a person is scared too.

22
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,333
And anyone can have a panic attack
under such random interrogation.

23
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,417
So, you've been reading the books
on body language.

24
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,458
Drinking alcohol and drug overdose
also cause pupils to dilate.

25
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,875
Wow! Didn't expect that from you.

26
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,125
I am really bored because of you.

27
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,500
Good boy...Class topper...

28
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,292
You're not naughty, you don't fight
and you don't demamd anything.

29
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,208
I need a topic to scold you.

30
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,542
You should get into trouble once in while
for your mom at least.

31
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,208
Otherwise you know...

32
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,792
the classic dialogue.

33
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,792
My son is such a brat.

34
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,333
She'll be forced to say it.

35
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,833
No one is perfect except for God.

36
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:14,500
But if someone deserves the second place
that's Bikram.

37
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,917
Hey, watch out!

38
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,333
What happened? Hello? Hello!

39
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,708
Dad! Mom! Hello?
Why ain't you talking?

40
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,375
Dad! Hello!

41
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,583
Mom, please talk to me...

42
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:35,792
Hello! Talk to to me.
Hello!

43
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,250
You can keep looking
out of the window...

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but until you finish your punishment task,
you're detained.

45
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:22,875
Is this a joke?

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,208
You've turned the school
into Kala Bhavan and Bhabani Bhavan.

47
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,958
You treat your exam's answer paper
as a canvas.

48
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,292
Or you're always reading
detective novels.

49
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,458
Why?

50
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,000
Why?

51
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,167
See Bikram, it's been a year,
your parents passed away.

52
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,958
Our faculty is very sympathetic
towards you.

53
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,125
In fact, that's why we've been lenient
with you.

54
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,542
But we can't tolerate this anymore.

55
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,875
So, please...this is your final warning. Okay?

56
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,958
Okay?

57
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,458
Firstly, I won't get marks.
Then I have to deal with this...

58
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,125
-Let's not talk about it.
-Yours is tougher.

59
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,083
-Bro, we hardly study...
-Are you going to fail?

60
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,542
Nothing gets inside my head.

61
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,000
Why? You aren't interested in studying
at all?

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,958
I can't do it.

63
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,625
- What do you want to do when you grow up?
- I have no idea what I'm going to do.

64
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,708
- I'll roam around.
- What?

65
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,125
What else?

66
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,208
- In different countries.
- Oh, that's nice.

67
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,667
- It's a good plan.
- It'll work out.

68
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,042
- I wish even my dad would allowed me.
- It will...

69
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,458
Tuki!

70
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,375
- Speaking of, I have to go...
- Oh, s**t.

71
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,500
Why don't you anwer your phone?
I've been calling.

72
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,375
It was on silent.
I was in school.

73
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,833
Orphan was in trouble again.

74
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,875
These toppers should be beaten up badly.

75
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,875
Our parents have made our lives hell.

76
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,042
You're right.

77
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:12,958
Let's target practice on these losers
and make their life hell.

78
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,750
Hit him! Hit him harder!

79
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,708
Bikram, are you hurt?

80
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

81
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,958
Let's go.

82
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,167
I'm okay.

83
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,250
- Is your leg hurting?
- What the hell!

84
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:30,667
- Let me check.
- Yeah, this leg.

85
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,250
Don't walk so fast.

86
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,292
He's not physically hurt.
He's hurt somewhere else.

87
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,667
Those boys are always swarming around
Tuki like flies.

88
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,458
And the Hitler of a dad!
He monitors his daughter like CCTV.

89
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,125
Tuki's dad is a senior detective.

90
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,375
I'm sure he tracks her browsing history too.

91
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:55,500
So no way you can say hi to her
on social media either.

92
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,208
But Bikram is future Feluda,
the detective when it comes to brains.

93
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,375
- Right.
- You think a smart school student...

94
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,292
can defeat a senior detective just with brains.

95
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,792
It just happens in films.

96
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,083
Bro, there's no chance.

97
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,458
Her father will arrest Bikram
on murder charges.

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,042
Surprise! Happy birthday, Mr. Bagchi!

99
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:49,083
Happy birthday to you!

100
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:53,708
Happy birthday to you, Mr. Bagchi!

101
00:09:55,208 --> 00:10:02,125
Happy birthday to you!

102
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:10,333
Happy birthday, Mr. Bagchi!
Happy birthday to you!

103
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:44,875
(TV playing)

104
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,583
Even though we're not his parents,
it's our responsibility to raise him.

105
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,000
His mom used to read detective novels
that's why he reads them constantly too.

106
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,583
Have you seen he has sketched
on his answer sheet instead of writing.

107
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,083
His final board exams are coming.
Please talk to him.

108
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:02,083
He says he gets bored after finishing the answers
so he sketches.

109
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:03,875
What am I supposed to tell him?

110
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,375
He's topping his exams anyway.

111
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:12,042
He's doing worse in biology
in the last one year.

112
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,958
We can't afford a tutor.

113
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,542
And he's so rude to them...

114
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:23,500
Dessert King Dibyendu Bagchi
passed away last night.

115
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,750
- I can't deal with this anymore.
- I'll take him to the office with me.

116
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,667
At least I'll be able to keep an eye on him.

117
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,333
He passed away suddenly
during his birthday.

118
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,833
We present to you the last few minutes
of Mr. Bagchi's life.

119
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,833
Moving on to other news...

120
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:04,292
The Central Government is working
towards revising the tax slabs.

121
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:11,583
The Finance Minister had asked
for a list of taxable items.

122
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:16,250
Direct Tax Code Panel was given that list.

123
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:20,333
The panel has suggested a reduction
in the income and business taxes.

124
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,875
We don't send you to school to loiter around
with those older loafers.

125
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,917
I don't like hanging out with boys my age.

126
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,333
Very immature.

127
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,292
- I don't see the problem..
- Don't talk nonsense.

128
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:48,292
Your math score is not going to get better
because of them.

129
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,792
You solve crimes with this logic?

130
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,792
No wonder the city is so unsafe.

131
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,917
Tuki, don't speak to your father like that.

132
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,917
Strange!

133
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,333
Detective Sanjay Banerjee here.

134
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,000
Mr. Dibyendu Bagchi?

135
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:11,583
Okay.

136
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:16,042
I'll stop by his place on my way back
from the office.

137
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay.

138
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,583
Yeah, it was on the news too.

139
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,917
The death of the Dessert King!

140
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:29,000
By the way, do you need to be reminded
of your father's birthday?

141
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,708
Wish him before you leave.

142
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:37,083
I have a lot interviews lined up
for the new recruitment.

143
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,292
After that, I have to go
to Dibyendu bagchi's home.

144
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:48,083
You're still mad at your dad,
yet you'll keep wearing his worn out boots.

145
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:54,042
I don't know what you're trying to prove
by wearing smaller shoes.

146
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,625
I don't know why you keep repeating
the same thing everyday.

147
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,958
Excuse me!

148
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,792
Stop reading and finish your food.

149
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,292
Irritating!

150
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,958
Pastor John. Forty seven years old.

151
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:32,458
He was found shot dead
during his morning walk.

152
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:36,292
The bullet went through
the left side of his head.

153
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,625
What else can you see?

154
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,167
Looks like the weapon belonged to the him.

155
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:46,792
Since a gun was found,
it must be a homicide.

156
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,708
Next!

157
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,750
From all the evidence, it looks like a murder.

158
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,708
It's a hate crime.

159
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,750
He was shot from the left side.

160
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,833
But from the prints on his hand,
it seems he is right handed.

161
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:05,667
-So it can't be a suicide--
- No, no, no...

162
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,292
All of you are only looking
at the obvious.

163
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,417
Looking is not the same as seeing.

164
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,542
I need someone who can be my third eye.
Third eye.

165
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:28,167
The biggest mystery is if someone
like that exists.

166
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,250
We've reached Wise Owl.

167
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,250
Hey, let's go home.

168
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:39,833
No! You've come this far
to meet Tiyasha.

169
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,208
- It'll be odd.
- It'll be more odd if we keep standing outside.

170
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:46,250
Let's get out of here.

171
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:48,042
- Look at those losers.
- Let's go in.

172
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,875
- I don't want to any trouble...
- What are they doing here?

173
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,458
- I think we should leave...
- No, let's go in.

174
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,917
- Hey, let's go bully them.
- Let them be!

175
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,333
- Unnecessary trouble...
- What's the point?

176
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,708
- I'm telling you, let's leave.
- What can he do to us?

177
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:14,958
Just look at his sandals.
Trying too hard.

178
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,208
These rugrats are ruining
the environment.

179
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,333
- Hey....
- What are you going to do? What happened?

180
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,208
Are you trying to scare me?
Get lost!

181
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,708
Go stay in an orphanage.

182
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:33,083
Are your branded clothes
gettting scared of our cheap ones?

183
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,042
Don't you remember the thrashing
you got yesterday?

184
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,000
Once you reach heaven
you can complain to your parents.

185
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,583
Do you know who we are?

186
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,542
Must be a celebrity's son?

187
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,542
Your phone says it all.

188
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,417
Look at him drooling over
the expensive phone.

189
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,083
- It costs one lakh rupees.
- Oh no! They cheated you.

190
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,500
This is an android phone
with an iPhone interface.

191
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,792
Because the original iPhone display
is not so pixelated.

192
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,708
You're right.

193
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,792
This is not the high quality retina display.

194
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,667
And your watch...
That's a fake too.

195
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,458
- Oh yeah!
- Can't read the date.

196
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,833
Unlike the original,
the cyclops lens is not there.

197
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,167
And your friend's Adidas shoes...

198
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,667
The logo has been very amateurishly stitched
on it.

199
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:26,333
Isn't the original local product
better than the fake Chinese stuff?

200
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,292
We know our status well.

201
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,375
Goodbye. I have to go.

202
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,792
- I need to talk to you.
- We're off.

203
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,542
- You guys go ahead.
- Talk your heart out!

204
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:42,542
Isn't it better to say hi in person
than stalk me on Instagram?

205
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,208
I'm a little old school like that.

206
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:50,792
And it's very easy to figure out fake accounts
on Instagram.

207
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,167
- Oh, okay...
- You're not the only detective around.

208
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,875
See you around. Bye.

209
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,958
- You have to treat us now!
- Calm down, guys!

210
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,875
The Central Nervous System controls
most parts of the body.

211
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:43,042
It consists of the brain
and the spinal cord.

212
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,167
Okay, this page...

213
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:53,542
Complete five biology practise tests
and show them to me.

214
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,375
Your handwriting is just like your dad's.

215
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,792
Remember one thing.

216
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,500
This is your answer sheet
not your dad's prescription.

217
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,708
I can type it out on your laptop.

218
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:08,083
No! And anyway the laptop is at home.

219
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,125
He can use my laptop.

220
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,458
This is my nephew, Bikram.

221
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,750
You know.

222
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,125
- Bikram, how are you?
- I'm fine.

223
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,875
Are you going to investigate
the Bagchi crime scene?

224
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,333
If there was no crime
how can you call it a crime scene?

225
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,750
He's a huge fan of detective novels.

226
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,833
Let him speak.

227
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,792
Go ahead. Don't feel shy.

228
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,958
Mr. Bagchi was a very successful businessman.

229
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,542
It's normal for people like him
to have lots of enemies.

230
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:46,292
His partners, Mr. Roy and Mr. Sanyal,
were involved with a financial scam.

231
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,625
I read about it in the papers last year.

232
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:54,708
I saw Mr. Bagchi collapse
after having a sweet at the party.

233
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,458
It's possible his sweet was poisoned.

234
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,292
It's possible it is a murder.

235
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,625
Stop playing Sherlock and study biology.

236
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,292
Otherwise, your aunt will scold you.

237
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,292
I still can't believe it.

238
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:16,042
My name is Jhinuk. I'm the elder daughter-in-law
of the Bagchi family.

239
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,292
Father-in-law...

240
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:28,417
He just left us without saying anything.

241
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,333
He didn't give us any time.

242
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:38,417
He was a very good man.

243
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,000
MURDER IN COLD BLOOD,
SAYS POLICE

244
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,417
BUSINESSMAN MURDERED,
BODY RECOVERED

245
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,292
Mr. Gandhi's three monkeys.

246
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:48,917
What did you say?

247
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,625
- Say it again.
- No, I mean...

248
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:56,083
The lady touched
her ears, eyes and nose while talking.

249
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,542
That's like Mr. Gandhi's three monkeys.

250
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,667
Won't say, see, or hear bad things.

251
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:01,833
Interesting!

252
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:06,375
Hey, come to my room.
You can study on my laptop.

253
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,917
Let's go.

254
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,083
Come.

255
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:32,917
So, you're trying to say that the monkeys
represent our body language.

256
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,417
We've always behaved like the three monkeys
since we were kids.

257
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,292
Every time we'd lie we would cover our eyes.

258
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,583
Because the eyes are the mirror to the soul.

259
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:44,542
And we subconsciously touch our ears
or mouth while lying.

260
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,250
As if we're trying to hide something.

261
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:53,500
That means adults like Jhinuk Bagchi also
subconsciously let us know that they lie.

262
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,542
Yes and no, both.

263
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,458
There are different kinds of interpretations
of body language.

264
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:03,292
Sometimes when we are very shocked
we cover our mouth.

265
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:06,667
But I think Jhinuk Bagchi
is definitely hiding something.

266
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:09,500
You don't have to see that.

267
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,417
This is the crime scene of a murder.

268
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,417
No problem.
And anyway, it's not a murder.

269
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,958
Explain.

270
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,583
Ummm...I mean...

271
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,125
There are no signs of struggle
on the body.

272
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,750
And the revolver is under his body.

273
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,250
Why would the murderer keep the murder weapon
under the victim?

274
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,917
Moreover, he was right-handed.

275
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:38,292
The gun was shot with the left hand
to make it look like a murder.

276
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,125
This is actually a suicide
staged like a homicide.

277
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:48,333
Okay but according to criminology,
there's no crime without a motive.

278
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,833
- So the suicide has a motive--
- He had depression.

279
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,250
Right! This man had been on antidepressants
for a long time.

280
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,083
But how can you tell from the photo?

281
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,458
He looks thinner here than his earlier photo.

282
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,667
Which means he was eating less
which is an usual sign of depression.

283
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:08,417
Older people usually go for morning walks
after sunrise.

284
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,458
But it's written he was on his morning walk
at 4 a.m.

285
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:14,208
That means he couldn't sleep.
Insomnia is another symptom of depression.

286
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:20,750
What was the need to stage the suicide
like a homicide?

287
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,708
- Can I use your laptop?
- Listen to him.

288
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,583
- Here you go.
- Yeah...

289
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,042
He was a pastor.

290
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,833
He spent his life trying to help others.

291
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,292
He gave everyone the hope
for a better life.

292
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:39,583
So to save his family from public shame
this was the most efficient way.

293
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,833
Wow! Excellent!

294
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:45,833
This is the third eye
I was looking for Barun.

295
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,625
Hmmm... Was it open already?

296
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,000
Sir, there's a parcel for you.

297
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,500
- What is it?
- It's a phone, sir.

298
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,208
What the hell is this?

299
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,375
Hello.

300
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,833
Sanjay, I'm a well-wisher.
And this is a warning.

301
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,750
If you don't investigate
Mr. Dibyendu Bagchi's murder...

302
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,000
you'll will be supporting
a murderer unknowingly.

303
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:20,417
And then no matter how much you try
you'll not be able to wash it off your hands.

304
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,250
What are you trying to say?

305
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,833
Mr. Bagchi was murdered?

306
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,500
I'm destroying the SIM.

307
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,833
So no point trying to trace this call.

308
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,833
I will get in touch with you later.

309
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:35,083
But sir, the news said he had a seizure
which is a completely natural cause.

310
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,792
But if he had poison...
Sorry.

311
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,625
Go ahead.

312
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:43,250
But if the seizure happened
because of poison then it was unnatural.

313
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,542
- Do something...
- Yes, sir.

314
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:48,542
Ask him to seal the boardroom.

315
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,875
Check the phone for fingerprints.

316
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:54,375
- Trace the call for any information.
- Okay, sir.

317
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:58,125
Ask the forensic department
to seal the crime scene.

318
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:01,125
No one should touch anything
before I reach.

319
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,333
Send the body for autopsy.

320
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,208
- I'm headed there now.
- Okay, sir.

321
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,000
Mr. Bagchi collapsed while having the sweets.

322
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,708
So, we don't have to wait
for the post-mortem report...

323
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:16,417
to tell us that his blood
will have traces of poison.

324
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:18,750
Bikram?

325
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,000
- You're coming with me to investigate the crime scene.
- What?

326
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,875
- Me?
- But sir...How will he...

327
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:28,542
We'll leave right now so that
we don't lose the evidence.

328
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,250
Let's go.

329
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,792
Sir, Bikram is still in school.

330
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,042
He said the right thing by fluke.

331
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:21,208
He read the Pastor John crime scene
at one go.

332
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,333
It's not fluke, Barun.
It's natural instinct.

333
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:25,375
One second.

334
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,583
Bikram... Bikram, come here.

335
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:33,750
Tell him, why you think Bagchi was poisoned.

336
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,417
While I saw the footage of him dying on TV...

337
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:40,292
and him eating the sweets,
reminded me of Agatha Christie.

338
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,292
She had written
that poison had it's own charm.

339
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:45,333
Neither is it as cruel as a revolver's bullet.
Nor is it...

340
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,250
fast like a sharp weapon.

341
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,208
Everything is a mystery novel for him.

342
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,125
He's a kid, sir.

343
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,333
No, Barun.

344
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:59,208
Kids his age use their eyes and ears
way more than we do.

345
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,500
They can see things
that we turn a blind eye to.

346
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:05,958
Bikram, what does your instinct say?

347
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,875
They were right when they said
dying on the birthday was poetic irony.

348
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,833
But yesterday wasn't his birthday.

349
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:15,875
What do you mean?

350
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:20,292
Then why the birthday party?

351
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:24,917
A big fundraiser was organised
on his birthday last year.

352
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:27,875
All the mainstream media houses
covered the event.

353
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,708
The date was 22nd June.

354
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,667
Today is 1st June.

355
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,042
How come his birthday was celebrated
three weeks in advance?

356
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:42,875
How do you remember an article
that came out last year?

357
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,750
Sir, actually Bikram has photographic memory.

358
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,208
Don't take him very seriously.

359
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,875
Thanks to Google,
there's no need for photographic memory anymore.

360
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,417
- Shut up.
- Sir, nothing suspicious here.

361
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,000
We haven't found any clues.

362
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,208
But Bikram has found a clue.

363
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,833
See this, Barun.

364
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:04,292
Mr. Bagchi's birthday is really on June, 22.

365
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:07,583
I was looking for someone
like your nephew.

366
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,333
Hey!

367
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,500
Do you want to come with me
to the autopsy house?

368
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,500
- Barun!
- Yes, sir?

369
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,500
I hope you don't mind me
hijacking your nephew.

370
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Absolutely not, sir.
Why should I mind?

371
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:30,625
The problem is, at home,
my missus is my boss.

372
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,958
If she gets to know
both of us will be in trouble.

373
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,083
Convince your missus.

374
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:38,625
Tell her both of you are detectives now.

375
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,167
Guess what she'll say?

376
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,042
Stop all this and find a good biology tutor
for Bikram.

377
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,292
He is scoring very poorly
in Biology these days.

378
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:51,625
I work in the Forensic department.
My biology is not too bad.

379
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,625
You won't find a better tutor than me.

380
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,583
- Will it work?
- Absolutely, sir.

381
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:00,500
Thank you, sir.
Bikram, thank sir.

382
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:02,042
Thank you, sir.

383
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,083
What will be my designation?

384
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,750
Junior detective?

385
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:08,750
No...

386
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,833
Can I get a revolver?

387
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,625
I can learn how to use it.

388
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,792
No...

389
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,708
Can I, at least, get a police badge?

390
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,167
No...

391
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,375
Can't he say anything other than no?

392
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,458
No...

393
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,375
Tell me something, Bikram.

394
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,542
A brilliant boy like you...

395
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,792
Why is he doing so bad in biology?

396
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,417
Which chapter are they on?

397
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:43,500
Nervous system.

398
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,083
His nerves become so relaxed
while studing the nervous system...

399
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,375
he falls asleep, poor boy.

400
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,167
Can you at least sound the police siren?

401
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:56,958
I don't have it.

402
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,208
- Did you get in touch with them?
- Yes, sir.

403
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,250
- Hey, kid, where are you going?
- I am with--

404
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,208
- He's with me.
- Okay, sir.

405
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,208
Are you sure he should go in?
He's just a kid.

406
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,167
If you feel uncomfortable,
you don't have to go in.

407
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,708
It's your decision.

408
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,333
I performed the last rites
for my parents last year.

409
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,417
This shouldn't be a problem.

410
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,167
I want to help.

411
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:33,583
Let's go.

412
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,958
Doesn't look like he was killed with poison.

413
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,958
If he had ingested poison,
there would have been some vomit or excreta.

414
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,250
No signs of it.

415
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:02,583
His skin would have been yellowish
or reddish if he had poison.

416
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:07,167
Can't see that either.

417
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,583
No boils either.

418
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,167
I am a huge Hercule Poirot fan.

419
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,542
And Agatha Christie loved using poison
to kill off her characters.

420
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,958
What did you see?

421
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,833
He was dressed for a formal meeting.

422
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,375
No one attends a birthday party
in a formal suit.

423
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,625
His name is Dibyendu Bagchi.
So his intials shoukd be DB.

424
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,333
But why is it D and P here?

425
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,875
He was called the Dessert King of the city.

426
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:58,333
Isn't it contradictory that someone like him
will wear shoes off the street?

427
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,958
The ring on his finger was quite loose.

428
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,375
Because it had a mark too.

429
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,417
That means he had lost weight
since he started wearing that ring.

430
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:11,083
It's possible that diabetes made
the Dessert King stay away from sweets.

431
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:15,375
But the wound on his head
was probably caused by the fall.

432
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,000
But why are there so many marks
on his body?

433
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,667
It can't be because he fell down once.

434
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:27,958
So he must have had a disorder
which made him fall down and cause those marks.

435
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,792
One second.

436
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,333
Here it is.

437
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,542
There are three main reasons
why older people are likely to have a fall.

438
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,667
These are chronic health conditions such as...

439
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,208
heart disease, dementia
and low blood pressure...

440
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,583
which can cause dizziness.

441
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,292
Poor vision or muscle weakness...

442
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,292
illness that can have an effect on balance...

443
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:51,083
such as Labyrinthitis.

444
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:55,208
Inflamation of the delicate balance-regulating parts
of the ear.

445
00:34:55,458 --> 00:35:00,417
So, a neurodegenerative disorder
which made him lose balance and fall.

446
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:10,667
Barun, ask our pathologist to check
injuries properly.

447
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,417
Okay.

448
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,500
There's still no clue of poisoning.

449
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,708
There's no poison.

450
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,625
So, we don't have a murder weapon.

451
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,458
In that case, it'll be difficult to prove
this was a murder.

452
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,208
Moreover, it's a high profile case.

453
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:27,667
We have to stick to all the rules
and carry the investigation forward.

454
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:33,208
And if there's nothing in the forensic reports,
the reporters are going to have a field day.

455
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,792
Uncle, just think!

456
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:40,375
A murder which has been designed

457
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:43,417
so that the cause of death
appears to be natural.

458
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:48,000
In criminology, this is called a perfect murder.

459
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:51,000
But Mom used to say, no one is perfect
except for God.

460
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:55,625
Behind this perfect murder
the killer must have left something imperfect.

461
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,500
Our job is to find the imperfection.

462
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:06,125
What do you think of Bagchi's ring?

463
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:09,042
The ring must have some sentimental value.

464
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,083
Even though the ring was lose,
he used to wear it regularly.

465
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,042
It had an inscription "BABA".

466
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:20,750
So, he probably wore it in memory of his father.
Or one of his sons must have given it to him.

467
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:26,333
And the cufflinks with D and P written on it?

468
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,792
Rich business people like Bagchi
are narcissists.

469
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:33,208
The norm is to have one's own initials.

470
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,875
But his wife's name is Rakhi.

471
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,875
So, the D and P are initials of his two sons.
Debraj and Premendra.

472
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:47,083
What were you saying about his clothes?

473
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:51,125
The suit clad Mr. Bagchi wasn't expecting
this birthday party.

474
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:54,833
So the surprise really worked.

475
00:36:54,917 --> 00:37:02,833
But what is still bugging me are the cheap shoes.

476
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,667
Now what did the shoes do?

477
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,167
A study from University of Kansas says...

478
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:11,458
people like Bagchi who were simple shoes
are very simple.

479
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,167
They have more friends than enemies.

480
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:18,958
The lesser the number of enemies,
the easier the job is for us.

481
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:25,542
Before, we get the autopsy report,
we have to make the suspect list.

482
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,708
My suspect list already has Mr. Sanyal
and Mr. Roy, his two partners.

483
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:42,417
Do you know the best time
to study a person?

484
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,292
When he doesn't know
that someone is watching him.

485
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,792
No one will doubt your innocent eyes.

486
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:59,625
You must take advantage of that
and study everyone.

487
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,792
We have to go to the Bagchi Villa tomorrow.

488
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay?

489
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,000
What do we have here?

490
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,833
These people are filthy rich!

491
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,417
You know what the Bible says?

492
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,083
Money is the root cause of all evil.

493
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:39,875
But the Bible says the root cause of all evil
is actually the love for money, not money itself.

494
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,500
That's why it's not a problem to be rich.

495
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,292
Greed is the real problem.

496
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,250
- Hey.
- Yeah.

497
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:49,083
- How old are you?
- I am 16.

498
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,500
- Sometimes I feel...
- What?

499
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,500
You're not 16 but 61.

500
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,083
- Come on.
- Let's go.

501
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,083
What a tragedy!

502
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,250
(indistinct chatter)

503
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:47,667
That's Premendra, Bagchi's younger son.

504
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:54,708
He looks pretty distraught
by his father's death.

505
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,208
And that guy...

506
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,667
He is the elder son, Debraj.

507
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,708
He looks quite the opposite of distraught.

508
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,792
Do I have to teach you everything?

509
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,833
Guests are going to be coming in all day.

510
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,250
Keep Dad's room clean.

511
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,875
He thinks he is a superstar
with the dark glasses.

512
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:24,292
Or according to your Gandhi's three monkeys theory...

513
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:29,875
he's trying to hide something behind those glasses
like his wife.

514
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,875
But what is it?

515
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:36,292
Or probably he doesn't want anyone
to see him crying.

516
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,333
It might be the other way around.

517
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:43,583
Because a lot of people
might also be thinking like you.

518
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,083
Probably, it's a complete facade.

519
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,958
- Sanjay, right?
- Yes.

520
00:40:57,542 --> 00:41:00,875
- Please have some tea.
- No.

521
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,000
Dad was a foodie...

522
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:09,125
Please wait here.
I'll get some juice.

523
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,542
How can he leave us like this?

524
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,750
I still can't believe it.

525
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:21,833
Isn't she the one we saw on TV?

526
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,625
Why is she so dressed up?

527
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,750
It's all over.

528
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,542
She is the elder daughter-in-law.

529
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:34,042
Can you arrange for some juice?

530
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,917
Who is she?
Standing there...

531
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,083
Please come.

532
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,125
Radhika, the younger daughter-in-law.

533
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,917
She still looks quite shocked.

534
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:47,917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

535
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:52,125
You must be
Premendra's wife, Radhika.

536
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,625
Yes, that's me.

537
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,708
Sorry, I overheard you.

538
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,458
My sister-in-law is...

539
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:01,667
She's overdressed for all occasions.

540
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,292
I'm diabetic.

541
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:16,208
And I married into a family famous
for making sweets.

542
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:19,792
I'm not allowed to have anything sweet.

543
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:26,333
Radhika, why are you doing all this?
Where is Jhontu?

544
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,417
Jh...Jhontu?

545
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:32,000
We... We've fired him.

546
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,792
Oh, I see.

547
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,458
- Are you Jhinuk?
- Yes, hello.

548
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:44,833
Hello, I'm Detective Sanjay Banerjee
and this is Bikram.

549
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:48,417
Have you met the hostess?

550
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:52,375
I thought as the elder daughter-in-law
you'll be the hostess...

551
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:56,750
- Sister-in-law, someone here to meet you.
- Please excuse me.

552
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,625
My brother and his wife are busy people.

553
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:09,250
And with Babai around,
they can't spend much time with the family.

554
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,292
I'll have to go
and check on other guests.

555
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:18,833
It's not just sister-in-law vs. sister-in-law.

556
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:23,375
Premendra's relationship
with Jhinuk is quite strained too.

557
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:27,958
If someone was this overdressed,
I would be irritated too.

558
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,917
That's Mr. Roy, one of the partners
of Bagchi Sweets.

559
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,125
Yes, yes.

560
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,500
- Why is he standing here alone?
- I think he's hiding.

561
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:57,875
His body language suggests
he's guilty of something.

562
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,375
...cancel it.

563
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:02,750
Sanjay, hope you're not having any trouble.

564
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,542
No.

565
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,542
Please try to understand.

566
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:10,333
- Mr. Roy, please come in.
- Talk to you later.

567
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,208
Mr. Roy, where is Mr. Sanyal?

568
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:16,208
Mr. Sanyal is attending an urgent meeting.

569
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:19,542
Actually, Mr. Bagchi was such a close friend...

570
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,125
that this entire incident
is really very painful for us.

571
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,833
Was Mr. Sanyal so grief-stricken...

572
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,500
that a day after his friend
and partner died...

573
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,208
he couldn't cancel a meeting?

574
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,917
Were you at the birthday party?

575
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,750
Yes, I saw the entire incident
with my own eyes.

576
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,917
Mr. Bagchi, out of the blue,
suffered an epileptic seizure.

577
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,167
Epilepsy...

578
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:44,625
Excuse me.

579
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,167
Epilepsy... Interesting!

580
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,042
That's why there were so many wounds
on Mr. Bagchi's body.

581
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:54,500
Dr. Majumdar gave medicines
to Dad regularly.

582
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,833
He was there at the party too.

583
00:44:56,833 --> 00:45:03,208
He tried to revive Dad after the epileptic seizure
but without any success.

584
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:10,208
As a doctor, did he see the death
of his own patient?

585
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,000
It's a failure of his treatment.

586
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,375
As a doctor,
it must a moment of shame for him.

587
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,250
Dr. Majumdar was Dad's childhood friend.

588
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,292
- Will he be coming here today?
- No.

589
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:25,292
He's been out of touch
since Dad's death.

590
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,417
Maybe, he's busy.

591
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:30,958
Can you give me
your super busy doctor's phone number?

592
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:32,875
Yeah, I have his phone number.

593
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:36,583
Here you go.

594
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:47,458
Please take my number too.
You can get in touch if you need.

595
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:51,250
Please be careful
and keep an eye on everyone.

596
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,333
Bye.

597
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:01,708
Epilepsy and Parkinson's,
both are nerve disorders.

598
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,208
You're observation was quite good,
I must say.

599
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:10,708
That was a good practical lesson
for the biology class.

600
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,208
But the thing is...

601
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:19,583
we have to add this Dr. Majumdar
to our list of suspects.

602
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:23,042
We'll call him to the office.
Have to talk to him.

603
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:26,167
Then, can I be there
for Dr. Majumdar's meeting?

604
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:33,958
Of course, you'll be there.
We're a team now.

605
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:41,958
Actually, for epilepsy patients,
SUDEP is a great danger.

606
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:45,708
- What's SUDEP?
- Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy.

607
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:48,458
Epilepsy is a nervous disorder.

608
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:51,542
Some nerve cells suddenly stop working.

609
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:52,417
Yes, yes.

610
00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:00,917
And these epilepsy patients
get physically hurt very often.

611
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:08,375
I have brought a copy
of Mr. Bagchi's prescription with me.

612
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:22,458
I'm guessing the fall he suffered
from the epileptic seizure...

613
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,333
caused the head injury and the massive blood loss
leading to his death.

614
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Correct me if I am wrong.

615
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:33,875
I think the autopsy report
will confirm this theory.

616
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,750
I am no one.

617
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:48,542
But I think after you get the autopsy report,
you should drop the case.

618
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:54,042
His family is going through
a lot of harassment.

619
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,542
Sorry, Doctor.

620
00:47:56,542 --> 00:48:00,542
Our job is to seek the truth.
Harassment is collateral damage.

621
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:04,917
I just want to appeal to your humanity.

622
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,917
I'll take your leave.
Goodbye.

623
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,583
S***!

624
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,667
I had expected to get some information
out of this meeting but...

625
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:25,458
now it seems the death
was caused by epileptic seizure.

626
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,833
Although, I don't trust the doctor at all.

627
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:33,417
His eyes were constantly shifting.

628
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,667
I think we should keep an eye on him.

629
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,458
It's the first sign of guilt.

630
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,583
If the autopsy report says the cause of death
is epileptic seizure instead of poisoning...

631
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:46,542
then the cause of death is natural.

632
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,542
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

633
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:54,250
Then why are all his family and friends
so full of guilt?

634
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:57,042
There's nothing natural in this case.

635
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,833
We have to find proof.

636
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:04,958
And the easiest way to do that
is to find the motive of the suspect.

637
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,000
Notes on Bagchi murder case.

638
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,833
There are no signs of an affair
on Radhika's Instagram profile.

639
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,208
Then who was she meeting in secret?

640
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,875
Mr. Bagchi died at 11 p.m.

641
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:34,583
Jhinuk and Debraj landed from Guwahati
on the morning flight the next day.

642
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,417
What does all this mean?

643
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,083
Notes on Bagchi murder case.

644
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,708
There are no signs of an affair
on Radhika's Instagram profile.

645
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:48,917
Then who was she meeting in secret?

646
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:06,958
- Bikram, dinner is served.
- Yes, coming!

647
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,708
Bro, you're a genius.

648
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:18,042
Instead of impressing Tuki,
you have impressed her dad.

649
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,792
Tuki... Huh!

650
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:22,042
I wanted to date her
and now I've become her dad's assistant.

651
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:23,958
You should at least get a gun.

652
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,000
Take a selfie with it.

653
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,500
Bro, it'll be great
if it's the same one Feluda uses.

654
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:29,958
It's a .32 Colt, right?

655
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:32,917
Right... And my aunt will give me electric shocks.

656
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:35,208
Are they going to give you a designation?

657
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,458
Then, you can wear a badge
and post a photo.

658
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,750
Bro, I'm still a school student.

659
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,333
This is like an internship.

660
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,125
What will you get out of this internship?

661
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,000
- Will you finally get Tuki?
- Yeah, right.

662
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:51,042
It's not like I'll get to meet Tuki a lot
during the investigation.

663
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,083
But there's an excellent plot twist.

664
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,958
I'm having a lot of fun!

665
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,458
I went there to solve practise test
but now I'm solving a murder case.

666
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:00,083
One second.

667
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,792
Sanjay Uncle is calling.

668
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,333
Hello, yes.

669
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,875
Oh, okay. Okay.
I've got to go now.

670
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,875
Yes.

671
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:30,583
What happened?

672
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,167
Okay.

673
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:42,917
Doesn't the shoe hurt?

674
00:51:47,292 --> 00:51:52,875
- Why are you so obsessed with shoes?
- I want to know everything... That's all.

675
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:55,542
And like Mr. Bagchi's ring...

676
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:59,500
your dad's shoes
must have some sentimental value for you.

677
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:03,167
How did you know
these are my dad's shoes?

678
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:06,958
The company stopped making this model
after the '70s.

679
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:12,000
And it looks like it's been taken care of.

680
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:16,792
A research from University of Kansas says
people who take care of their shoes...

681
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:19,042
they are polished as human beings too.

682
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,792
That is exactly how your father, the judge, is.

683
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:26,958
And we all want to step into our dad's shoes
and be like them.

684
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:31,750
But if the shoe doesn't fit,
it cuts the foot.

685
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,792
One can't walk properly.

686
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,292
What are you trying to say?

687
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,958
If you keep hanging on to the past,
the shoe remains in the same place too.

688
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,875
You won't be able to move forward.

689
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:57,708
Just because you have a photographic memory,
don't think you're either Byomkesh or Freud.

690
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:01,458
Best not to talk about something
you know nothing about.

691
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,083
How would you feel if I start dissecting you?

692
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:14,833
Arguing with your uncle and aunt,
fighting with the bullies...

693
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,500
getting beaten up.
What are you trying to prove?

694
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:23,292
A brilliant student like you is weak in biology
is not convincing at all.

695
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:29,667
What if I say that you have some sentimental value
attached to the subject?

696
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,542
I have to go.
I have to get back home.

697
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,125
Hey, wait!

698
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,958
I'll drop you.

699
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,375
Hey!

700
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,208
Please come in.

701
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,375
What's the matter, Barun?
I can't get through to your phone.

702
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:28,292
Sit, please.

703
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:31,708
- Has Bikram come home?
- No.

704
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,250
He was with you.

705
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:39,000
He got bummed
because I said something about biology.

706
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,792
Then he got off the car.

707
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:46,167
Actually, Bikram really loved his father.

708
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,958
His father taught him biology himself.

709
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,292
That why he'd score really well in biology.

710
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,750
After his parents passed away...

711
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,625
he doesn't even touch his biology books.

712
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,958
Now, he is hooked on to crime novels
just like his mom.

713
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,375
You know, sir...

714
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:05,833
My brother and sister-in-law wanted Bikram
to be a doctor.

715
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:09,125
He'd say doctors are lab coat wearing detectives.

716
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:12,667
They unravel the inner mysteries
of human beings.

717
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,208
The patient is the victim.

718
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,250
The disease is the crime.

719
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,125
And the symptoms are the clues.

720
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,208
I understand.

721
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:31,167
Crime novels and biology
are the last connections with his parents.

722
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:35,292
I'm really worried about him.

723
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:40,375
He represses his pain.

724
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,167
Do something.

725
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,542
Send him over to my place
in the afternoon.

726
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,750
I'll teach him biology from tomorrow.

727
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,708
Okay, sir.

728
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:54,917
Come to my place during lunch.

729
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,458
I'll teach you biology.
I've told them.

730
00:55:57,958 --> 00:55:59,500
Give me something to eat.
I'm hungry.

731
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:01,542
I'll heat up the food.

732
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:13,667
Hello.

733
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:19,917
Is this a teen novel that you're working with a kid
on such a high profile case?

734
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,625
It's all child's play for the police anyway.

735
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,042
Who are you?

736
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:26,583
Are you following me?

737
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:31,000
Detective, we have our eyes everywhere.

738
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,208
This orphan must have made you think
really hard.

739
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,250
Hey!

740
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:39,292
Don't you dare touch that kid.
He shouldn't be harmed.

741
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,625
Wow! What are you planning?

742
00:56:42,917 --> 00:56:45,167
Are you going to adopt him?

743
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,750
What do you want?

744
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,375
We want justice. We want answers.
Give us the answers.

745
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:56,750
That's the least we can expect
from Justice Supratim Banerjee's son.

746
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,417
Keep my father out of this.

747
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,167
Tell me what you want.

748
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:04,458
If you have the honest courage
to fight crime like your father...

749
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:07,750
then you'll find Mr. Bagchi's killer.

750
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,292
If you know so much
why aren't you helping us?

751
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:14,875
Check Mr. Bagchi's room.

752
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:17,792
Monday to Sunday, it's all full.

753
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,792
Monday to Sunday, it's all full?

754
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,583
Good luck.

755
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,958
Hello? What do you mean?

756
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,542
Hello! He--

757
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:13,500
I know you've become a little quiet
since the incident.

758
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,250
And I understand. Your parents...

759
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:22,208
But others are still here.

760
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:27,167
You can't solve the sum.
Let me do it for you.

761
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:31,667
Don't keep your feelings bottled up.

762
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:37,750
I'm listening.
I'm sure you miss them.

763
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,500
I don't.

764
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:43,042
It's written all over your face.
Who are you trying to hide it from?

765
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:44,625
Really?

766
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:53,417
I have everyone...
And still I'm so lonely.

767
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:56,833
Dad is constantly busy with work.

768
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:59,958
Mom is busy running house and the family.

769
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,708
And I'm alone.

770
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:08,458
At least, if Dad involved me in his work
like he did with you...

771
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:11,708
Their existence makes no difference
at all. Anyway...

772
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:15,167
It makes a lot of difference
if your parents are around or not, Tuki.

773
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,500
I'm sorry.

774
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,750
Do you really want to help
with the investigation?

775
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,542
Uh huh!

776
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:35,875
Hey, didn't I ask you solve the biology paper?
What are you doing here?

777
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:41,208
Sorry, Uncle... Tuki couldn't solve
this algebra problem.

778
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:44,500
- I was just helping.
- Let me see.

779
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,333
She's been trying to solve it
since morning.

780
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:50,875
Did you solve it?

781
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:53,958
- Yeah, she can copy it from me.
- No...

782
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:56,458
She shouldn't copy it.

783
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,792
I have a better idea.

784
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:03,333
I'll teach you biology.
You can help her with math.

785
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,625
Why do I have to tutor her?

786
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,750
- There's no need.
- Yeah, what's the point?

787
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,750
Enough studying.
Let's have lunch.

788
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,125
- I've made some fish head curry.
- Great!

789
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:19,167
- Let's eat!
- Come on.

790
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:25,500
I hate fish head.
Please order for a pizza for me.

791
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:27,917
Why do you like eating all that rubbish?

792
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,750
And these apps make it even easier
to get the rubbish.

793
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,792
You've forgotten the taste
of a home cooked meal.

794
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:33,833
Eat up!

795
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,625
The fish head curry is a Bengali work of art.

796
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:41,292
It has all the ingredients to be a superhit.

797
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:42,833
Wow!

798
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:47,250
I'm drooling at your description.

799
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,833
Let me taste it.

800
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,417
Bengalis are so weird.

801
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,833
How can you happily munch
on the fish's head like this?

802
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:53,667
How is it?

803
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:54,708
It's disgusting!

804
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:57,458
The head is the most delicious part
of the fish.

805
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:00,667
It's loaded with omega-3,
Vitamin A, iron, zinc and calcium.

806
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:05,125
Looks like your student will give you a class
on biology.

807
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:10,667
You've done some great work
on the fish head curry it seems.

808
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:14,292
The fish head curry cooked by my mom
was my favourite.

809
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:19,667
Even for my birthday lunch,
I'd prefer this over mutton curry.

810
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:24,042
And Dad used to say eating fish head
made one more intelligent.

811
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:26,542
Grey cells become like Einstein's.

812
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:29,500
- Want some more?
- No, I'm good.

813
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,333
- Tuki!
- What?

814
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:38,125
Instead of eating up our heads,
you should eat some fish head.

815
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:42,542
Then maybe someday you'll top the class
like Bikram.

816
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:50,208
Fish head and math tuition...
Thank you for ruining my life, Bikram.

817
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,042
- I hate you.
- Sorry...

818
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,417
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing...

819
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:04,458
The address is 47/2/A, Padmapukur Lane.

820
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,000
- Nikon, check on your right.
- Yeah.

821
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,167
You've become really good
at this detective thing.

822
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:10,375
You've turned Hitler into Gandhi.

823
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:16,750
Why don't you save your pocket money
and treat Tuki to some pizza?

824
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:21,042
Forget about Tuki.
She's out of my league.

825
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,375
She hates me.

826
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:26,875
Are you trying to read Tuki's body language?

827
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,042
She's not interested in me.

828
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,833
Can I borrow the body language book
from you?

829
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So that I can be your Watson
in the future.

830
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,667
Bro, you can't be a detective
by reading some books.

831
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,833
Take my example.

832
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:43,292
My father named me Nikon
because he likes photography.

833
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:46,292
But only if I had a memory card
like Bikram...

834
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:50,167
But you have your smart phone in your hand.

835
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:52,042
- Yeah...
- It's the same thing.

836
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:55,542
- Hey, 47/2/A...
- Let's go.

837
01:02:57,292 --> 01:02:59,458
Here it is... 47/2/A Padmapukur Lane.

838
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,542
- It's locked.
- What?

839
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,167
- Check if there's any other way in.
- Let's go.

840
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:08,000
It's locked.

841
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,042
Did you find anything?

842
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:11,375
- It's shut.
- Isn't there another entry?

843
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,333
There's no other way in.

844
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,208
- Did you check that side?
- S***!

845
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,458
- There's just one door.
- Is that locked too?

846
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:18,042
- Yeah!
- Let's check the back.

847
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,958
- Let's go...
- Hurry up.

848
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:28,375
- There's a window here...
- Let's try...

849
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,833
- Let's open it.
- Wait, I'll try...

850
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:32,792
This is locked too.

851
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,167
It's locked from the inside.

852
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,333
Woah! Here we go!

853
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,708
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

854
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:56,333
- Shut the window.
- Quickly.

855
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:01,250
Look for the book of accounts.

856
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,083
- Nikon, check properly.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

857
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,833
- Look for the book of accounts.
- Yeah, the book of accounts.

858
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:09,875
Book of accounts...

859
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:14,292
Cash bills... No, no, no...

860
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:16,417
Book of accounts...

861
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,292
Not this...
Not this either...

862
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:22,125
What's this?

863
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:30,875
It's none of this.

864
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,417
Book of accounts.

865
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,458
- Nikon, come here.
- Yeah...

866
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:45,792
- Boka, come here.
- Yeah.

867
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,250
I was right.

868
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,458
Mr. Sanyal and Mr. Roy were trying
to destroy evidence.

869
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:53,583
There might be some papers
that are still intact.

870
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,292
Let's take some photos.

871
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,083
Look at this.

872
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,042
Shoot this.

873
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:02,917
- Done?
- Almost.

874
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,333
Done. Next page.

875
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:10,333
Two thousand seventeen...
TK Dhar...

876
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:12,333
Next.

877
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:15,708
Make sure you get the names clearly.

878
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,875
S***! Someone is here...
Let's hide.

879
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:23,500
Be quiet... Hide...
Stay down...

880
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:33,500
- Dibyendu trusted us.
- Just shut up.

881
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,417
Have you suddenly developed
a conscience?

882
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,917
But we can't hide like this
for the rest of our lives.

883
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,208
- Stop whining...
- They are the business partners...

884
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,000
- I'm going to lose my temper.
- Give it to me.

885
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:49,458
The work we've done,
this amount of money is nothing.

886
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,292
Give it back to me.

887
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:55,208
- Hand it over right now!
- I'm not giving it back to you. Do whatever--

888
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,625
Let's go.

889
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:02,458
Oh s***!

890
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,250
What do we do now?

891
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:11,125
- Call someone.
- Let me call Sanjay Uncle.

892
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:25,958
Hello, Sanjay Uncle! Please send an ambulance
to 47/2/A Padmapukur Lane.

893
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:26,958
Right now!

894
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:37,750
Keep quiet! There's a difference
between courage and stupidity.

895
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,333
But it would take you time
to get a search warrant.

896
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,333
So we thought of coming here.

897
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,750
Thank God, we were here!

898
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,875
We got some hardcore evidence.

899
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,000
It's possible that these two partners...

900
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,042
killed Mr. Bagchi to cover up this fraud.

901
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,625
This is the first time
we got some proper evidence.

902
01:06:56,625 --> 01:07:00,083
But even if we can prove the fraud,
how can we prove it was a murder?

903
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:03,875
And until the autopsy report comes,
it still looks like a natural death.

904
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:06,792
The phone call you got yesterday...

905
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:10,625
you looked very stressed and excited
at the same time from your body language.

906
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:12,292
Did he say something new about the case?

907
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:14,167
It was the same unknown caller.

908
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:18,250
He asked me to check Bagchi's room,
Monday to Sunday, all full..

909
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,500
It means...

910
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,917
Sounds like a riddle...
What does it mean?

911
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,167
Mr. Bagchi must have been a very busy man.

912
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,833
And an old school man like him
must have kept a diary.

913
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:32,083
The diary must be full of appointments
from Monday to Sunday.

914
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:36,292
Sir, Mr. Sanyal just reached the Bagchi Villa.

915
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,750
Drop these kids off at their homes.

916
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,000
Our next destination is Bagchi Villa.

917
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,542
Okay, sir.
Let's go.

918
01:07:48,667 --> 01:07:51,417
You're unnecessarily harassing
the Bagchi family.

919
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,667
But I want to harass you.

920
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,333
You really love sending your partners
to the hospital, don't you?

921
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,083
What rubbish!

922
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,708
How can you talk like this
during such tragedy?

923
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,500
Absolutely disgusting!

924
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:08,875
Just because you're wth the police,
shouldn't you have any sensitivity?

925
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:11,542
I know
the Police Commissioner personally.

926
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,875
Mr. Sanyal, why aren't you cooperating?

927
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:15,458
You haven't done anything wrong.

928
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,125
Just answer them.

929
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:19,375
What's the point of this investigation?

930
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:23,292
You're wasting your time
looking in the wrong places.

931
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:29,083
Whether we are right or wrong,
we can't tell you more right now.

932
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:33,292
I'm going to search Mr. Bagchi's room.

933
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,667
Can you show us where it is?

934
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,833
- Babai!
- Yeah.

935
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:41,083
Babai, please show them Grandpa's room.

936
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,208
Okay, Police Uncle.
Please follow me.

937
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:46,958
Thank you. Very sweet.
He's a very sweet kid.

938
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:51,542
He's quite naughty.
He gets into a lot of fights in school.

939
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,375
He'll do whatever he learns at home.

940
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,917
Radhika, the thing is...

941
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:59,042
you'd have known if you were a mom...

942
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:01,250
I'm so sorry I forgot.

943
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:05,375
You can't be a mother...

944
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,000
Even though I can't be a mother...

945
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,792
I was blessed to take care
of my father-in-law during his last days.

946
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:15,792
At least, I don't spend my time
attending parties.

947
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,542
Control your wife, brother.

948
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:19,125
Radhika, please...

949
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:22,917
We'll take a look at the room.

950
01:09:25,792 --> 01:09:26,542
Let's go.

951
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,625
Mr. Banerjee?

952
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,000
What is this?

953
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:39,000
It's an incentive.

954
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,792
Please close the case.

955
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:46,542
You can see the tension it's causing me.

956
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:52,292
If you don't take this envelope
from me right now...

957
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,125
then I'll be forced to arrest you.

958
01:10:04,792 --> 01:10:07,375
Uncle, what are you searching for?

959
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,208
Do you want to help?

960
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,583
Did your grandfather keep a diary?

961
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,917
Yes, he had a black, fat diary.
It's here.

962
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,750
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

963
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:28,750
How can this be?

964
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:33,000
The unknown caller had said
that Monday to Sunday was all full.

965
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,667
But his entire calendar is empty.

966
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:37,833
Babai?

967
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:41,125
Did your grandfather stay home all day?

968
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:44,333
Grandpa used to sleep all day.

969
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,292
Old age, you see.

970
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,667
He had joint aches and headaches...

971
01:10:49,667 --> 01:10:57,542
I used to ask him to take me to the zoo,
Science City or Nicco Park.

972
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,667
But he would just sit
and watch cartoons with me.

973
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,958
Babai, do you you miss your grandpa?

974
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,208
Yes, I miss him a little.

975
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,750
But Grandpa is going to come back.

976
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:11,542
My summer vacation is going on.

977
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:16,292
If I didn't have homework,
Grandpa would have taken me with him.

978
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:19,625
My birthday is coming up on July, 24.

979
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:25,667
Before my seventh birthday, Grandpa has promised
to get me a huge chocolate cake.

980
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,917
I'm Grandpa's favourite.

981
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:31,167
Babai, come here.

982
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:35,458
Don't disturb them anymore.
Drink your Horlicks before it goes cold.

983
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,292
- Thank you, Babai.
- Tata.

984
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:49,417
Take a look at this.

985
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:53,042
He had an appointment
on the day he died.

986
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:55,542
"Meeting new investors,
Gupta and Company."

987
01:11:57,125 --> 01:12:01,292
Then Mr. Bagchi must have already suspected
the fraud...

988
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:04,417
and was planning
to get rid of Sanyal and Roy.

989
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:07,958
Sanyal and Roy,
before the investors could come in...

990
01:12:08,042 --> 01:12:10,167
wanted to get rid of Mr. Bagchi.

991
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:15,208
So, the theories are adding up.

992
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:19,625
Mr. Bagchi was headed to a meeting.

993
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,250
And the surprise birthday party
was really a surprise for him.

994
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:33,208
Another interesting appointment scheduled
for the day after his death.

995
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,375
"Meeting with lawyer for will."

996
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:39,792
And a few lines by Tagore.

997
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:44,708
"My eyes fail to find you
Because you are in my eyes..."

998
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,375
Take a look at this.

999
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,667
"Monday to Sunday, all full".

1000
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,917
Can I see the prescription?

1001
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:20,250
The date of the prescription
and the chemist's receipt are the same.

1002
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:26,208
So, Mr. Bagchi had stopped
taking the epilepsy medicines.

1003
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,833
Most of it is unused.

1004
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:31,708
But it's dangerous that he stopped taking them.

1005
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,875
He was inviting trouble.

1006
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:45,750
So our unknown caller was giving us clues
about the diary and the pill box.

1007
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:52,250
But no one takes so much effort with their will
before they commit suicide.

1008
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:57,542
The plot thickens, Watson.

1009
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:01,333
An icecream would really help right now.

1010
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:06,042
Icecream to make the brain work...
Very scientific!

1011
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:11,792
So, which flavour would help sharpen
your mind, sir?

1012
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:17,167
- I'll get your favourite flavour for dinner.
- Double chocolate Cornetto.

1013
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,208
Do--

1014
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:23,417
Isn't it Tuki's favourite flavour too?

1015
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,333
We should go.
We're running late.

1016
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:37,208
Mr. Bagchi's will was his death warrant.

1017
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:42,750
My team is looking for his lawyer.

1018
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:46,708
The lawyer will be able to tell us...

1019
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:53,250
who had the biggest reason to be mad at him
after the new will.

1020
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:58,583
Might be his business partners or family,
a will can affect everyone.

1021
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,917
Family? But that's horrible.

1022
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:04,917
Dad, I want to help out
with the detective work too.

1023
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,417
Like Bikram.

1024
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,458
Of course, you can.

1025
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:11,833
But first you have to score like Bikram
in math.

1026
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,167
I think...

1027
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:18,042
Mr. Bagchi didn't stop
taking the medicines himself.

1028
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:20,833
Maybe someone hid the medicines
from him.

1029
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,292
In that case...

1030
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,917
the two daughters-in-law...

1031
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,500
had the most possibility.

1032
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:32,667
They have a very unhealthy difference
between them.

1033
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:36,208
These differences exist in all families.

1034
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:38,333
But Jhinuk is too aggressive.

1035
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:42,167
It might be the domestic help too.

1036
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:44,458
Probably forgot to give him the meds
at the right time.

1037
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:47,875
My icecream has melted away.

1038
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,583
You can have mine.

1039
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:52,042
Thank you.

1040
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:56,542
What is it, Bikram?

1041
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:58,792
What--

1042
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:01,083
- The man outside the window...
- Bikram?

1043
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,417
I've seen him before.

1044
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:04,208
He was following us.

1045
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:09,250
Is he our unknown caller?

1046
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:11,083
Wait, Bikram. I'm coming!

1047
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,208
Hold this!

1048
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,500
Three-eight-nine-seven...

1049
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,042
- That one?
- Yes.

1050
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:26,417
The bus number is 240.

1051
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:29,292
License plate number is
WB19 E 3897.

1052
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:32,083
Let's get your car.
We don't have much time.

1053
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,292
Take the first right.
It's a short cut.

1054
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,083
Yes, this right.

1055
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:01,833
When did you become a bus encyclopedia?

1056
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:06,750
I save the cab money my aunt gives me
and travel by buses.

1057
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:10,167
If I don't save the money
I won't be able to pay for my addiction.

1058
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,250
- By addiction I mean--
- I know.

1059
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,125
Your aunt has told me about it.

1060
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:20,917
There it is.

1061
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:23,667
Take this right.

1062
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:40,875
Hey! Wait!

1063
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:43,667
- This is the man!
- I don't know anything, sir!

1064
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,792
- Hey!
- I don't know anything...

1065
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:50,083
Don't try to run.
What is your name?

1066
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,708
Sir, please have mercy.
My name is Jhontu.

1067
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,625
Didn't you work at the Bagchi Villa?

1068
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,917
Didn't Radhika fire you for stealing?

1069
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:57,750
Yes, sir.

1070
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:01,167
A few days back,
they threw me out of the house.

1071
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:02,875
They blamed me for stealing.

1072
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:04,542
Please believe me.
I swear on my mother.

1073
01:18:04,542 --> 01:18:06,792
I didn't touch anything.

1074
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:08,750
Then why were you following us?

1075
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:14,792
I wanted to know
if you've caught the murderer.

1076
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:19,042
Sir, I loved my master more than my life.

1077
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:21,083
He was like a father to me.

1078
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:23,292
But recently...

1079
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:24,875
there was a lot of fights at home.

1080
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,333
They threatened to send me to jail.

1081
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,292
I thought running away is the best option.

1082
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:31,583
- We've seen the fight too.
- You have?

1083
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,292
Did anyone shout at Mr. Bagchi?

1084
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,000
No, sir... Not that...

1085
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,292
I don't know anything...
Please let me go...

1086
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:49,458
Let's go.

1087
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,333
What is it?
Why are you smiling?

1088
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:17,625
I'm happy you took my advise about the shoes.

1089
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:22,000
- Okay, Mr. Detective. You're home.
- Yeah.

1090
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:26,125
I think your aunt is now going to scold
both of us.

1091
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:29,083
My uncle's boss is scared of my aunt!

1092
01:19:32,542 --> 01:19:42,333
In life, the women are the CEOs.

1093
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,083
You don't need to be a detective
to know that.

1094
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:46,542
Go on.

1095
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,875
My books?

1096
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,875
What have you done with the books?

1097
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:11,500
The books?

1098
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:13,375
Where are you hiding my books?

1099
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,458
You don't have any right...
Those belonged to my parents!

1100
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,417
They are just books, Bikram.
They're not your parents--

1101
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:18,708
You're not my parents!

1102
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:20,750
You have no idea
about what's good for me.

1103
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:24,125
You won't do better in biology by reading
a few medical books and crime thrillers.

1104
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,875
Or do you want to be a detective
when you grow up?

1105
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,667
Please study properly.
That's what your parents would have wanted.

1106
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:30,417
Don't talk about my parents.

1107
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:34,375
- Bikram, calm down.
- Let me go!

1108
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:36,792
- Let him go.
- Okay.

1109
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:20,458
They have your best interest in mind.

1110
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,500
No one has to be concerned about me.

1111
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,292
Your father taught you biology.

1112
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:43,375
So you think it would be unfair to score
high marks without your dad around.

1113
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,042
But Bikram...

1114
01:21:53,458 --> 01:22:00,625
fathers are not just to drop you to school
or teach biology.

1115
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:08,875
We need our fathers for conversations...

1116
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,500
To grow up together...

1117
01:22:15,292 --> 01:22:19,833
To be our life's first hero...

1118
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:37,083
Time to take your own advice.

1119
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,583
What is it that you told me?

1120
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:44,000
Something about old shoes...

1121
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,375
They would have been still alive
if it wasn't for me.

1122
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,000
It was an accident.

1123
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,875
I was on a video call with them.

1124
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:56,167
I kept distracting Dad.

1125
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,750
I killed them.

1126
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,167
You're stupid if you think like this.

1127
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:05,667
I killed my parents.

1128
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,292
I should be arrested.

1129
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,167
Look at me.

1130
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:16,292
Come on.

1131
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:22,292
Come on... Look at me...

1132
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,833
Your parents were proud of you.

1133
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:35,833
They knew that you'll keep fighting
the good fight.

1134
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,625
That you would never give up.

1135
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:40,792
You can't give up.

1136
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,958
You're meant for the long run...

1137
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:55,292
Don't cling on to the sadness...

1138
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:58,542
Remember their love.

1139
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:17,375
Yeah?

1140
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:23,292
The post-mortem report is ready?
Okay.

1141
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:25,625
And the lawyer?

1142
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,458
You have the appointment?

1143
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:29,417
Okay, on my way.

1144
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:33,417
Can I come?

1145
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:39,958
Your CEO is your aunt.
You have to take her permission.

1146
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:50,417
Two months back, Mr. Bagchi told me
he's sending a draft of the will on email.

1147
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:55,292
We were supposed to meet
and finalise the draft.

1148
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:59,583
But I never received the email.

1149
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:10,083
If the email is in the drafts
then the cyber cell can retrieve it.

1150
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:13,333
But we don't have much time.

1151
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:18,708
And the post-mortem report says that he fell
because of the epileptic seizure...

1152
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,542
causing head injury
and brain haemorrhage.

1153
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:22,958
Ultimately causing his death.

1154
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:25,583
Very natural cause of death.

1155
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:33,750
If we don't find any clues soon,
we'll be asked to close the case.

1156
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:38,917
What's there in the financial records?

1157
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:43,583
We can remove Mr. Sanyal and Mr. Roy
from the list of suspects.

1158
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:49,208
Suspecting this fraud, Mr. Bagchi brought in
new investors...

1159
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:52,250
so that he can remove Roy
and Sanyal from the company.

1160
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:54,583
And this is the transfer deed.

1161
01:25:55,542 --> 01:26:00,250
So they don't have any motive for murder.

1162
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:10,708
That's why Mr. Sanyal wanted to bribe me
and destroy the evidence.

1163
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:16,000
So that there would be no proof of the scam.

1164
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:23,000
They're worried that after the murder
the scam files might be reopened.

1165
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:26,167
They are thieves but not murderers.

1166
01:26:26,167 --> 01:26:30,708
I think Mr. Roy wanted to confess out of guilt.

1167
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:34,125
That's why he got into the fight with Mr. Sanyal.

1168
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:38,917
But what should we do now?

1169
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:43,917
We should go back to the crime scene.

1170
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:50,500
What if we missed a clue?

1171
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,708
We must go.

1172
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:01,917
Bye.

1173
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:05,500
What are you thinking about?

1174
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:07,833
A missing part of the puzzle.

1175
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:14,917
The benefit of doubt can be given
for an early surprise party.

1176
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:18,250
It's not highly suspicious on it's own.

1177
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:21,875
But passing away
one day before signing the will...

1178
01:28:22,542 --> 01:28:24,083
is very suspicious.

1179
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:29,833
And a phone call from someone
who knows about the diary and the medicines.

1180
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:39,500
So the party organiser knew very well
this was going to be Mr. Bagchi's last day.

1181
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:47,875
The person who sent out the invitations
must be our prime suspect.

1182
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:51,208
The four members of the Bagchi family.

1183
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:54,083
Debraj, Jhinuk, Prem and Radhika.

1184
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:56,708
Anyone of them could have sent the invites.

1185
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:59,208
The invites were sent
from the company email ID.

1186
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,667
No, no, no...

1187
01:29:00,792 --> 01:29:03,875
Debraj wasn't even there
in the surprise birthday party.

1188
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:06,083
He was on holiday in Assam.

1189
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:09,667
He came back when he heard the news
of his father passing away.

1190
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:13,333
This party was a surprise for him too.

1191
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:20,542
If we get the will we'll know
who had the reason to kill him.

1192
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:26,625
The basic criteria for a email password is
it must have eight characters minimum.

1193
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,917
We can try trial and error.

1194
01:29:28,917 --> 01:29:31,708
Through permutation combination...
But that won't work.

1195
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:34,917
Because too many wrong attempts
will lock the account.

1196
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:37,625
We can try through the department
contacting Google but...

1197
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:41,000
that'll take a very long time.

1198
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,250
I can try to hack it once.

1199
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,833
I have a confession.

1200
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:48,875
I had hacked your laptop password
the first day.

1201
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:55,167
Explain in detail.

1202
01:29:55,583 --> 01:30:00,042
When you casually gave your laptop
to a random kid like me...

1203
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:03,083
I realised you are a soft person at heart.

1204
01:30:03,458 --> 01:30:06,333
And your password
would be something personal.

1205
01:30:06,417 --> 01:30:08,875
And the most common passwords are...

1206
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:10,917
usually a loved one's name or birthday.

1207
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:14,500
So, I tried Tuki's name and birthday
and "Open Sesame!"

1208
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:18,875
I see.

1209
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:21,917
So you remember Tuki's birthday by heart?

1210
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:45,542
Who did Mr. Bagchi love the most?

1211
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,000
That's the real question.

1212
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,542
If I can answer that
I'll be able to crack the password.

1213
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,542
I'm Grandpa's favourite.

1214
01:30:57,042 --> 01:31:02,917
Get in touch with Google.
Ask them how long it'll take them...

1215
01:31:02,917 --> 01:31:05,208
- Okay, sir.
- Can I see Mr. Bagchi's ring?

1216
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:05,917
Yes...

1217
01:31:07,292 --> 01:31:08,958
Show us the ring, please.

1218
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:16,750
There's another faded letter
after the inscription "BABA".

1219
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:19,708
Looking is not really seeing.

1220
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:21,625
We'll have to look deeper.

1221
01:31:25,042 --> 01:31:27,250
Look at this.
I was right.

1222
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:28,833
B-A-B-A-I!

1223
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:30,083
Babai...

1224
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:31,000
Let me see.

1225
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:34,083
So Debraj's son and Mr. Bagchi's grandson.

1226
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,083
He loved his grandson the most.

1227
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:40,708
My birthday is coming up on July, 24.

1228
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:46,500
Grandpa has promised to get me a big chocolate cake
for my seventh birthday.

1229
01:31:50,292 --> 01:31:55,417
Babai...24...7...2012...

1230
01:31:56,833 --> 01:31:58,042
Yes!

1231
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,083
We're in!

1232
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:01,833
Will...will...will...

1233
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:05,333
Will...Will...Will...

1234
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:09,167
What else can it be?

1235
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,667
Lawyer...

1236
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:12,042
Will...

1237
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:15,458
Nothing here.

1238
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,375
- There might be...
- Did you find something?

1239
01:32:23,042 --> 01:32:24,083
No...

1240
01:32:24,917 --> 01:32:27,292
Nothing in the inbox or the drafts.

1241
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,542
There's nothing in the other folders either.

1242
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,417
I'm looking in the wrong place.

1243
01:32:35,792 --> 01:32:37,042
I need to take a break.

1244
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:38,667
My brain is not working.

1245
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:40,250
Can I take a five-minute break?

1246
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:47,958
- Hey, tell me.
- Hi!

1247
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,833
- Did you find something?
- No.

1248
01:32:49,875 --> 01:32:52,000
I have a feeling we're missing something.

1249
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,125
Something right in front of your eyes.

1250
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:54,958
You think?

1251
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:57,833
Yeah, always.
That's what happens in all the detective thrillers.

1252
01:32:57,917 --> 01:33:00,875
Maybe there's something
in the diary we can't see.

1253
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,917
- Let's go.
- Where?

1254
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Bagchi residence.

1255
01:33:05,042 --> 01:33:07,000
Maybe you'll see something
and remember.

1256
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:08,500
Wait. Let me tell your dad.

1257
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,750
Bikram, grow up.

1258
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:12,250
Let's get a cab.

1259
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,500
- Then let's ask Boka and Nikon to join us.
- Hey, wait.

1260
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:17,792
I am asking Boka and Nikon
to reach the Bagchi Villa.

1261
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:18,833
Okay.

1262
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:21,833
- Let's go.
- Come over to the Bagchi Villa.

1263
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:23,583
Yeah, we're on our way.

1264
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,292
What?

1265
01:33:31,292 --> 01:33:34,833
This way... Quietly...

1266
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:51,792
Come here...

1267
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,125
This room.

1268
01:33:55,792 --> 01:33:57,208
No, this is the living room.

1269
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:58,083
That way.

1270
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,917
I think it's this way. Come...

1271
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:11,583
"My eyes fail to find you...

1272
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,083
Because you are within my eyes."

1273
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,417
Draft of the will and the...

1274
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,542
poem...

1275
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,458
by Tagore...

1276
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:30,125
There must be something
behind the eyes.

1277
01:34:30,458 --> 01:34:32,208
That was written in the diary.

1278
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:43,417
- Hey, help me with the photo.
- Yeah...

1279
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:48,875
Here it is.

1280
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:53,500
But password.

1281
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:55,583
Babai's birthday.

1282
01:34:57,417 --> 01:34:58,750
Twenty-four... Seven...

1283
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:01,125
Babai's birthday.

1284
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:03,292
Twenty four...

1285
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:06,583
Seven...

1286
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,125
Twenty twelve...

1287
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,500
Is it open?

1288
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:17,917
No, wait...

1289
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,542
What's this?

1290
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:26,125
Here it is.

1291
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:27,625
Draft of will...

1292
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:34,333
Oh, in this draft of will...

1293
01:35:34,917 --> 01:35:40,083
Mr. Bagchi wanted to leave most of his property
to his elder son Debraj and Babai...

1294
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:40,750
Okay...

1295
01:35:40,792 --> 01:35:44,292
That means Premendra was ignored in the will
on purpose.

1296
01:35:44,375 --> 01:35:45,750
Okay...

1297
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:49,292
That party was organised
by Premendra.

1298
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:50,625
Oh God!

1299
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:53,833
Hold this.
I'll send a screenshot to your dad.

1300
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:56,042
One second.

1301
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,458
Hey, don't try anything funny.

1302
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,958
Don't do anything stupid.

1303
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:11,583
Let me see that.

1304
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:26,083
This is the problem with your generation.
Mobile phone.

1305
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:27,750
Why did you send the photo?

1306
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,333
Could have done away with the evidence...

1307
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:30,875
Come on...

1308
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:31,958
Move...

1309
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:32,750
Come on...

1310
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:36,208
Keep walking!

1311
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,292
Where are you taking us?

1312
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:56,792
Where are you taking us?

1313
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:58,458
He is going to take us hostage.

1314
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:00,750
- I like intelligent boys.
- What do you want?

1315
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:04,667
Don't open your mouth when I bargain.

1316
01:37:05,042 --> 01:37:06,042
Keep quiet.

1317
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:08,667
- I have already told him.
- Okay.

1318
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:11,708
The thing is...

1319
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:14,167
Hey, Bikram! Wait!

1320
01:37:15,292 --> 01:37:17,542
Where are Bikram and Tiyasha going?

1321
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:19,333
There was a strange man in the front.

1322
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:20,750
Bro, that man had a gun.

1323
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,250
He has kidnapped them and a kid.

1324
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:23,958
S***!

1325
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,708
- Didn't take a photo of the license plate...
- I did...

1326
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:29,417
- You did! Bravo! Let's go!
- Let's go.

1327
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,042
Let's see...

1328
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:43,083
What can your Uncle do?

1329
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:48,208
I can crack a better deal than you.

1330
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:53,458
My scared voice will make them agree
to your demands.

1331
01:37:53,583 --> 01:37:57,250
Please I want to save Tuki, Babai and myself.

1332
01:37:57,625 --> 01:37:58,750
Please...

1333
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:01,792
You want to call?

1334
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:05,958
Okay. You can call but...

1335
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:08,875
if you do something funny I will...

1336
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:10,958
What will he do?

1337
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:14,458
Why don't you...

1338
01:38:14,917 --> 01:38:17,958
ask them to come to our old factory?

1339
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:18,792
And yes...

1340
01:38:19,542 --> 01:38:22,208
Ask Debraj to draft a document.

1341
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:25,625
All of Dad's property and assets...

1342
01:38:26,083 --> 01:38:29,667
should be divided
between the brothers equally.

1343
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,042
- Uncle, Tiyasha...
- What happened?

1344
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:36,042
...Bikram and a kid were kidnapped
by a man.

1345
01:38:36,042 --> 01:38:37,250
He had a gun.

1346
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:39,042
I have a photo of the license plate.

1347
01:38:39,042 --> 01:38:39,500
What will happen now?

1348
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,333
Where did you see them?

1349
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:44,458
- Barun...
- Near Bagchi Villa.

1350
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:47,042
I'm sending you a license plate...

1351
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:49,292
Track the car.

1352
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:51,000
Ask the police not to stop the car.

1353
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,333
The man has a gun.

1354
01:38:52,333 --> 01:38:55,625
They have Bikram and Tiyasha...

1355
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,292
He can shoot if he panics.

1356
01:38:57,292 --> 01:38:59,833
No one should stop him.
Okay?

1357
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:01,333
They don't have their phones.

1358
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:02,708
We can't track their GPS.

1359
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:05,417
- We'll follow them with traffic cams...
- Let's go.

1360
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:11,250
He should get it to us by 11.
Then it'll be fine.

1361
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:18,667
And if anyone tries to do anything smart,
no one is going home.

1362
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,958
A son will not be able to see his father.

1363
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,458
Go ahead make the call.

1364
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:43,125
Hello.

1365
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:46,625
Hello, Uncle. This is Bikram.

1366
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:48,625
Listen to me.

1367
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:50,167
Premendra wants...

1368
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:52,417
a signed document from Debraj...

1369
01:39:52,417 --> 01:39:55,083
which says that their father's property ...

1370
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:57,042
and assets...

1371
01:39:57,042 --> 01:39:58,292
must be divided equally...

1372
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:01,792
If you don't bring it by 11 p.m.
then we're dead.

1373
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:03,583
Please...

1374
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:04,625
Are Tuki and Babai with you?

1375
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:06,208
Yes, Tuki and Babai are with me.

1376
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,083
He'll kill us.
11 p.m...

1377
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:09,125
Where do we have to come?

1378
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:10,417
The old Bagchi factory.

1379
01:40:10,417 --> 01:40:10,958
Where?

1380
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:13,083
The old factory.

1381
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:16,208
Hello, Bikram.
Where are you?

1382
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:20,417
Hello? Hello?

1383
01:40:21,833 --> 01:40:24,417
You're really smart.
A team player.

1384
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:29,333
Thanks a lot. Seriously.
Thank you...

1385
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:31,583
Please, please, don't kill us.

1386
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,917
He won't kill us.

1387
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,208
Because he knows the sentence for murder
is 21 years.

1388
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:39,667
And the sentence for kidnapping
is hardly seven years or fine.

1389
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:43,417
And he knows he'll get away
with his father's murder...

1390
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:46,625
because there's no strong murder weapon.

1391
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:48,167
Thanks a lot, Bikram.

1392
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,750
Now, shut up.

1393
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:53,375
Otherwise, I'll forget
about the 21-year sentence...

1394
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:56,917
- Shut up!
- Uncle, let them go.

1395
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:02,958
Take the next right.

1396
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:25,250
Where exactly are we?

1397
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:29,958
Somewhere no one can hear your screams.

1398
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:33,458
- Keep walking.
- Just cooperate with him.

1399
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:42,000
Keep left...

1400
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:49,625
Barun, ask the traffic guard
to keep the roads clear.

1401
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:51,750
Right now.
It's an emergency.

1402
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:10,500
Bikram, I'm so sorry.

1403
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,625
- We're in this mess because of me.
- It's okay.

1404
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:16,250
I just wanted to help Dad.

1405
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:30,000
Uncle, that's Aunty's syringe.
Do you have diabetes too?

1406
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:37,125
Hey, take this.

1407
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,375
Fingerprints... Syringe...

1408
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:42,417
What do you mean?

1409
01:42:45,417 --> 01:42:47,625
You're actually a heroin addict.

1410
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,167
Now I get it.

1411
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:51,000
That's why you bought the syringes.

1412
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:54,958
The first time we saw you,
we thought you were depressed.

1413
01:42:54,958 --> 01:42:57,542
That's why you were all over the place.

1414
01:42:57,667 --> 01:43:00,542
Actually, these are all symptoms
of heroin addiction.

1415
01:43:00,542 --> 01:43:03,625
That's why Mr. Bagchi didn't trust you.

1416
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:06,958
Because if you got the keys
to the Bagchi empire...

1417
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:09,708
you'd waste it all on your addiction.

1418
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:13,375
That's why you have issues
with Debraj and Jhinuk.

1419
01:43:13,417 --> 01:43:15,917
Because they know everything.

1420
01:43:15,917 --> 01:43:18,708
That's why they kept their distance from you.

1421
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:22,583
And you are the cause of Radhika
and Jhinuk's fight.

1422
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:24,792
Because Radhika was always trying
to protect you.

1423
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:28,667
Radhika is very scared of me.

1424
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:32,958
Just like you're scared right now.

1425
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:43,417
So the guy who came to meet Radhika
is your drug dealer.

1426
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:49,792
When I was younger,
I tried a lot.

1427
01:43:52,167 --> 01:44:01,583
But Dad had already decided
that I could never walk in his shoes.

1428
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:06,083
It was his destiny to be killed
by the family's black sheep.

1429
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:13,292
But how did you know that he'll have a seizure
the day before he signed the will?

1430
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:22,500
A little... pay a little attention to details.

1431
01:44:22,583 --> 01:44:27,500
How else will you move ahead?
Take a flashback to the crime scene.

1432
01:44:30,292 --> 01:44:32,208
Crime scene...

1433
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:55,083
- What is it, Bikram?
- Evidence! S***!

1434
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:59,083
- Evidence! Evidence!
- What evidence?

1435
01:44:59,333 --> 01:45:02,667
The evidence was right there.

1436
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:07,083
And we were just looking.
We didn't see.

1437
01:45:21,667 --> 01:45:24,875
The surprise birthday party
was the murder weapon!

1438
01:45:25,917 --> 01:45:28,458
Flashing lights! Loud music!

1439
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:32,417
Extreme emotion or stress!
Any one of these could trigger epilepsy.

1440
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:40,250
And that's why the party was planned
carefully three weeks in advance.

1441
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:45,750
So that the shock would be extreme
when he suddenly met his family and friends.

1442
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:51,333
Finally the little detective's brain
is working.

1443
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:55,458
Correct! Good!

1444
01:45:56,417 --> 01:45:59,125
This entire crime scene...

1445
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:01,375
that I had organised...

1446
01:46:01,667 --> 01:46:04,375
Each of the elements...

1447
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:09,250
The flashing strobe lights...
The sound boombox...

1448
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:12,958
Each one of them is a murder weapon.

1449
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:24,042
So that my late father encounters
the strongest epileptic seizure of his life.

1450
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:30,542
- You knew all his trigger points.
- Exactly.

1451
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:34,542
Debraj would have tried to stop you
if he didn't go to Guwahati.

1452
01:46:35,583 --> 01:46:38,833
But you were hiding in the house like a snake.

1453
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:40,625
Everyone thought you were harmless.

1454
01:46:40,792 --> 01:46:45,042
But you knew exactly when to attack.

1455
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:52,708
But I know for a fact
this wasn't your first attempt on your father's life.

1456
01:46:53,417 --> 01:46:55,125
How did you know that?

1457
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:59,333
We've met your father's Man Friday, Jhontu.

1458
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:04,667
Jhontu told us about the domestic troubles.

1459
01:47:04,667 --> 01:47:11,792
You created an atmosphere of unrest
on purpose.

1460
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:16,542
So that your father's already weak nervous system
felt weaker.

1461
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:21,833
But it didn't work
because he was on epilepsy medication.

1462
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:28,167
You knew that Jhontu gave him the meds
on time.

1463
01:47:28,292 --> 01:47:33,917
Getting rid of Jhontu was your master stroke.

1464
01:47:34,708 --> 01:47:40,375
That's why there were unused medicines
for three weeks.

1465
01:47:40,667 --> 01:47:44,708
Dad didn't care which medicine he was taking.

1466
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,458
Your father trusted you blindly.

1467
01:47:47,542 --> 01:47:53,417
While you were making the master plan
to murder him.

1468
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:58,958
So perfect that the post-mortem report says
that it was a natural death.

1469
01:48:04,667 --> 01:48:08,542
Do you know what criminal science
calls this?

1470
01:48:09,875 --> 01:48:14,708
Perfect crime! Perfect crime! Perfect crime!

1471
01:48:16,417 --> 01:48:25,792
I, Premendra Bagchi, have voluntarily
murdered my father.

1472
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:29,917
And you can't prove anything.

1473
01:48:30,042 --> 01:48:32,917
My mom used to say
no one but God is perfect.

1474
01:48:33,542 --> 01:48:36,667
So you're nothing more
than an imperfect murderer.

1475
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:44,625
Listen you're just a kid
pretending to be a detective...

1476
01:48:47,667 --> 01:48:54,333
Oh no... It's so unfortunate.

1477
01:48:55,208 --> 01:49:01,667
My little detective...
couldn't grow up...

1478
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:06,375
Drop the gun.

1479
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:10,667
I have the document you wanted.
Check it and let them go.

1480
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:25,208
Thank you... Thank you...

1481
01:49:26,542 --> 01:49:28,333
You are under arrest.

1482
01:49:28,708 --> 01:49:30,167
For what?

1483
01:49:30,583 --> 01:49:32,167
Kidnapping?

1484
01:49:32,167 --> 01:49:34,833
My lawyer will handle it.
There's no other proof.

1485
01:49:34,958 --> 01:49:39,500
Check his left pocket.

1486
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:42,875
- Hey...
- Play the recording then press forward.

1487
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:47,125
Play the recording.

1488
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:49,542
You have to forward it.

1489
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,917
This entire crime scene...

1490
01:49:52,917 --> 01:49:55,167
that I had organised...

1491
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:58,167
Each of the elements...

1492
01:49:58,333 --> 01:50:03,042
The flashing strobe lights...
The sound boombox...

1493
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:04,875
Each one of them is a murder weapon.

1494
01:50:04,875 --> 01:50:06,042
Don't move.

1495
01:50:08,625 --> 01:50:10,583
Perfect crime!

1496
01:50:12,667 --> 01:50:21,542
I, Premendra Bagchi, have voluntarily
murdered my father.

1497
01:50:21,542 --> 01:50:23,417
Isn't this proof enough?

1498
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:25,667
When did you do this?

1499
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:28,500
Sorry.

1500
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:35,458
I had switched on the recoder
when you gave me your phone.

1501
01:50:35,458 --> 01:50:38,417
This is Bikram.
Listen to me.

1502
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:39,625
If you don't bring it by 11 p.m....

1503
01:50:39,625 --> 01:50:41,375
He'll kill us.

1504
01:50:44,583 --> 01:50:46,583
Damn it!

1505
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:48,917
It's been recording since then.

1506
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:52,375
Premendra, thank you for your confession.

1507
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:59,083
Mr. Premendra Bagchi, you're under arrest
for the murder of Dibyendu Bagchi.

1508
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:01,042
Let's go.

1509
01:51:02,167 --> 01:51:03,667
Thank you, Uncle.

1510
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:08,167
So, you are the unknown caller?

1511
01:51:08,542 --> 01:51:12,000
I had my suspicion
but didn't have any proof.

1512
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:14,583
- Really?
- Yeah.

1513
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:17,417
Thanks for saving our lives.

1514
01:51:18,417 --> 01:51:23,000
Thanks to Nikon's photo of the license plate.
Otherwise, we'd be too late.

1515
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,083
- Really?
- Not really.

1516
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:27,583
Our Sherlock had taught us...

1517
01:51:27,667 --> 01:51:32,458
how to use the resources we have.

1518
01:51:33,125 --> 01:51:34,958
- You and Boka are...
- No, bro...

1519
01:51:35,167 --> 01:51:37,750
This is the first time
Boka did something smart.

1520
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:41,667
He read your mind
and knew you were in trouble.

1521
01:51:41,667 --> 01:51:45,083
Team effort, guys!
We're Avengers!

1522
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:48,708
Let's go.

1523
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,625
Here, have this.

1524
01:52:26,833 --> 01:52:28,458
- No, no, it's okay.
- Hey...

1525
01:52:28,583 --> 01:52:32,375
If you're this shy outside the crime scene
you're not getting anywhere.

1526
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:35,208
- I'm warning you.
- Okay... Sorry.

1527
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,917
You don't have to be sorry, you idiot.

1528
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:44,083
You know, Bikram...

1529
01:52:45,375 --> 01:52:49,875
You should be careful
about the company you keep.

1530
01:52:51,542 --> 01:52:57,208
- Actually the hormones...
- Papa, please...What are you even saying?

1531
01:53:01,958 --> 01:53:06,000
Bikram, I care about you.

1532
01:53:06,667 --> 01:53:09,208
And that's why I am telling you...

1533
01:53:11,208 --> 01:53:15,917
If I find you attracted to my daughter...

1534
01:53:16,458 --> 01:53:21,000
then it'll be your body
which will be in my autopsy lab.

1535
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,667
Yes, sir... I mean uncle...

1536
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:27,625
Take it.

1537
01:53:27,625 --> 01:53:30,792
- Hello.
- Don't worry.

1538
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:34,542
Cordon off the crime scene.
No one should touch anything.

1539
01:53:34,542 --> 01:53:36,417
What are you doing?

1540
01:53:36,458 --> 01:53:38,458
- Bikram!
- Yes!

1541
01:53:38,667 --> 01:53:42,750
- We have a new case.
- New case?

1542
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:45,458
Then it would be great if I get a gun.

1543
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:48,042
- I mean for my protection.
- No.

1544
01:53:48,083 --> 01:53:52,667
- Then a badge, at least.
- No...

1545
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,625
I should at least have a designation.
Please don't say no.

1546
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:01,958
Detective Junior.
Okay?

1547
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:04,667
Yes, absolutely!

1548
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:09,083
FOR ALL THE PARENTS
WHO SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF OUR HEART

1549
01:54:09,292 --> 01:54:13,292
SO THAT WE CAN LEAD HAPPY, FULFILLING LIVES
