1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,280
Alcohol is injurious to health.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,680
Smoking causes cancer and can kill.

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:10,040
Characters and situations
in this movie..

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
..are not from real life,
they are purely fictional.

5
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:13,640
All characters are
made to talk in Telugu..

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,704
..so that everybody
can understand them.

7
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,960
You were proud that
Kolkata is in your power.

8
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,440
Today Kolkata is under my control.

9
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,800
Call out for your leader.

10
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Say, Brother,
Taxi Seth is going to kill us.

11
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,600
Please come and save us.

12
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,400
Call out for him.
Where is your leader?

13
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
Shout for help!

14
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,320
We don't have to shout.

15
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Goddess Kali will save Kolkata.

16
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,560
Our leader will save us.

17
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,520
He'll come.

18
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
He'll come? How will he come?

19
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
When will he come?

20
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,080
He's not a bus or a train
to tell his arrival timings.

21
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,040
He's a storm.

22
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,680
Hey! Nothing will be left
here when our leader arrives.

23
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm telling this
for your own welfare.

24
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,720
Pack all your bags and
run if you know running.

25
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,480
If you can't run, hide yourself.

26
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,160
You don't have much time.
He'll be here.

27
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,120
Beat him up!

28
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,522
I'll forgive you
if you try to harm me.

29
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,122
But I'll kill you if
you try to harm my friends.

30
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,762
How did this happen?
Who killed so many people?

31
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,602
What were you doing when
they were getting killed?

32
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,682
Our sir will answer your questions.

33
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:42,202
Yes. Okay.

34
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,882
I'll arrange for the tickets
but won't come for the movie.

35
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:53,922
Listen! I'm already seeing
a 70 mm movie here. Okay?

36
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:54,722
Sir!

37
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:55,562
What?

38
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:56,562
The press..

39
00:07:57,762 --> 00:07:59,362
Will you hang up for a second?

40
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:00,482
What is it?

41
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,802
The press is attacking
us with questions.

42
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,082
What should we tell them?

43
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:05,682
What will you tell
them that they don't know?

44
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,082
They'll ask Is the
police department sleeping?

45
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,162
Why didn't you catch
the killers yet?

46
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,922
We'll tell them that we
are in the process of doing that.

47
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,122
They'll abuse us
and we'll speak morals.

48
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:16,922
All of that is just a routine.

49
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:18,682
Send the bodies for post mortem.

50
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:19,682
Okay, sir.

51
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:20,762
What is it, Gajalaxmi?

52
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,802
The minister looks very upset.

53
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:44,882
Yes, sir.

54
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,806
Sorry, sir! Looking at
the crime scene we understood..

55
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,966
..that your brother
had tied some men to a pole.

56
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,686
Either one of them or another
man killed all your men.

57
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,766
Some were stabbed,
others' bones were shattered.

58
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,006
I think your brother died because..

59
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,126
..there was a lot of bleeding
from his nose and mouth.

60
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,726
Do you get paid to cover
the story like a TV reporter?

61
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:13,686
Sir..

62
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:16,966
I don't want to know
how my brother died.

63
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:18,406
I want to know who killed him.

64
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,286
Catch him wherever he is.

65
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:22,246
I've to kill him with my hands.

66
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,006
Catch him! Catch him!

67
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:27,846
Is it a running bus so
that we can run and catch it?

68
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:28,806
What does he think?

69
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:32,486
Can I tell when and why
I'll get calls on my phone?

70
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:33,726
How is that possible, sir?

71
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:34,926
You'll know it after
you get the call.

72
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,526
In the same way, the police
get to know after the killings.

73
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,086
Hi, sir! Good morning!

74
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:39,846
Good morning!

75
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,966
Here are the post mortem
reports of all the bodies.

76
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,526
The killer is a very strong man.

77
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:47,766
I think he is a young
man under 25 years of age.

78
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:53,166
He smashed all the
bones in all the bodies.

79
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,166
Even their skulls are broken.

80
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,526
How can we catch this
strong 25 year old young man..

81
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,246
..with just these evidences
in millions of people?

82
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,766
How can I tell you more than this?

83
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,686
I'm sorry. I'll catch him.

84
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:09,126
I'll find him no matter which
state or which street he is in.

85
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,006
Where are you?

86
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:34,166
O my dear Laila! Come to me

87
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:38,086
O my dear Laila!
Come to me, My darling!

88
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:54,446
I am crazy after you

89
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:57,246
Shall I attack straight
into your heart

90
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:00,286
Shall I burn inside
you like a tequila

91
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:06,006
My dear girls,
shall I come to you with my vigor

92
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:13,246
Shall I salute you with
my style and make you happy

93
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:24,806
O my dear Laila! Come to me

94
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:28,846
O my dear Laila!
Come to me, My darling!

95
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,366
I am crazy after you

96
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,566
Poland, Finland and China..

97
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:18,166
Russia and England..
I have my fans all over

98
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:22,006
My hand's touch is mesmerizing

99
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:25,366
Shall I jump into
the arena with my energy

100
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,446
Shall I see my Mumtaz in you

101
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,806
Shall I become the emperor
Shahjahan out of intoxication

102
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:37,446
My dear girls,
shall I come to you with my vigor

103
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:45,726
Shall I salute you with
my style and make you happy

104
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,606
O gorgeous girl!

105
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:16,926
What is life without spice

106
00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:23,726
O lovely girl, life is
insipid without your company

107
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:31,926
I am crazy for love..
My beloved, come to me soon

108
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:49,006
We'll live the full life today

109
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,366
Boredom in life
is as good as death

110
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,126
Show your might to the world

111
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:59,246
Shall I make my
heart like a chalise

112
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:02,526
And fill it to the
brim with the wine of joy

113
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:06,006
Shall I make every
event one to rejoice

114
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:11,486
My dear girls,
shall I come to you with my vigor

115
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:19,966
Shall I salute you with
my style and make you happy

116
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:29,846
O my dear Laila! Come to me

117
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:34,126
O my dear Laila!
Come to me, My darling!

118
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:38,748
Is Cherry still asleep?

119
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,948
Of course.
He goes around the city all night.

120
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,508
He comes home in the
wee hours and goes to sleep.

121
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:45,708
Cherry! Wake up.

122
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,508
What is it, mom?

123
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,308
I kept your coffee here.
Get up and get dressed.

124
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:50,748
You will get late. Come on, get up.

125
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:51,668
Okay.

126
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,108
Aunty!

127
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:57,868
What?

128
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,388
I missed my college bus.

129
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:02,028
My mom told me to ask
Cherry for a ride to college.

130
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,628
Jimmy! What else
did your mom tell you?

131
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:05,748
She told me a lot of things.

132
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:06,788
Tell me a few things.

133
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:09,428
She told me to give
you whatever you ask for.

134
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:10,508
Really?

135
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,388
After getting onto the bike,
she told me to..

136
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:14,828
..hold you tightly whenever
speed breakers come.

137
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:15,788
What else?

138
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:16,788
I feel shy.

139
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:17,988
I feel irritated.

140
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:22,588
I'm not a fool to fall
for your mom's plans. I'm Cherry.

141
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:23,548
Now go.

142
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:24,388
Cherry!

143
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,388
Please go.

144
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:28,988
What are you reading so intently,
Saraswati?

145
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,268
I'm trying to learn English.

146
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,388
What does brutal mean?

147
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:34,508
Utmost cruelty.

148
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:35,788
Say it in Telugu, sir.

149
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,388
You need to learn Telugu
along with English.

150
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:41,548
Yes.

151
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,428
Why are you reading
this stupid news now?

152
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:48,428
Go and finish your work.

153
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:49,988
Mom, breakfast.

154
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:51,428
Serve it quickly.

155
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,068
Instead of being in
such a hurry all the time..

156
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:55,908
..why don't you get
up early and get dressed?

157
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,548
Your uncle is your CEO.

158
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,948
Can't you call him up and
say that you'll be late today?

159
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,308
I've been trying to do that.

160
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:02,508
But he's not answering my call.

161
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:03,788
Did he forget his phone upstairs?

162
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:05,588
He hasn't come down since morning.

163
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:06,508
Really?

164
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,148
Uncle!

165
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,388
What's the matter, uncle?

166
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,268
Why did you cover yourself
like that? Are you cold?

167
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,268
I'm scared.

168
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:17,108
What?

169
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,228
If they ask for me at office,
say I'm out of town.

170
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:19,748
If they are not satisfied,
say that I'm dead.

171
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:21,788
Why should I lie to them?

172
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,068
Because you can't
tell them the truth.

173
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:24,628
What is that truth? Tell me.

174
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,828
I was happily going to
the office in my company car.

175
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,468
I suddenly got a phone call.

176
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:32,748
Hello!

177
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:33,588
Hello, sir!

178
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,908
My sister liked your
photo at the marriage bureau.

179
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,868
Please meet her once.
If you like her, we'll proceed.

180
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,148
Okay!

181
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,268
She liked me! Yeah!

182
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:44,228
I've been desperately
trying to get married.

183
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:48,388
So that news was like
water in a desert for me.

184
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,228
I thought my life
will take a new turn.

185
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:51,908
I took a U turn and
went to see the girl.

186
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:55,108
Spit out the betel leaves.

187
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,668
Put those knives aside.

188
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,628
Change your language
and body language.

189
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,308
He shouldn't find
out that we are goons.

190
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:01,148
Okay.

191
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:02,148
The groom is a software engineer.

192
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,108
We should be soft. Okay?
- Yes.

193
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:08,508
Look at his lovely hair style.
Curly hair.

194
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:09,708
He looks like Shoban Babu,
doesn't he?

195
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,588
I'm sure he looks even
more handsome in person.

196
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:17,268
You said the groom is going to come.

197
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:18,388
Why did he send his father?

198
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,268
Hello, sir.
Didn't you bring him along?

199
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:21,668
Who? Chandra Babu or Mohan Babu?

200
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:22,548
I was talking about your..

201
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,508
My father died long ago.

202
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:24,548
I didn't mean your father.

203
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,228
Stop asking questions
and show me the girl.

204
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,828
Oh dear! She looks too young.

205
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:34,558
I'll go ahead with her.

206
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:36,398
Take his blessings.

207
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:37,918
No need for that.

208
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:38,798
Sit down.

209
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,238
I like the girl.

210
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:41,558
That means he'll like her as well.

211
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,918
Who is that?
What are you talking about?

212
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,998
I like you. You can talk
to me in private if you want.

213
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:50,358
A girl talks to
the groom in private.

214
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:53,078
How can she talk to the
groom's father in private?

215
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:55,558
You misunderstood me.

216
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,518
I'm the groom.
I want to get married.

217
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:58,918
Then whose photo is this?

218
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,998
That's my photo.

219
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:03,438
Disgusting!

220
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:04,598
Dear!

221
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:05,638
Viju! Wait!

222
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:06,958
Dear!

223
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,078
You gave your teenage
photo at the bureau.

224
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,918
But you came to see
the girl in your old age.

225
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:15,278
I'm a little late, so what?

226
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:18,118
Not a little late,
you are lifetime late.

227
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:19,598
Why are you making it a big issue?

228
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,118
For example, who's the
hero in the movie 'Khaidi'?

229
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:22,998
Chiranjeevi.

230
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:23,878
What about 'Tagore'?

231
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:24,718
Chiranjeevi.

232
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:25,558
Did his fans increase or decrease?

233
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:26,358
They've increased.

234
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:28,718
People who liked Chiranjeevi
in 'Khaidi' 20 years ago..

235
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:31,198
..like him in 'Tagore' today,
don't they?

236
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:31,998
Yes.

237
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,078
If you liked my old photo,
why don't you like me now?

238
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:35,238
Fans and marriage
are two different things.

239
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:36,518
No, they are the same.

240
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:38,198
Do we stop seeing
Taj Mahal and Charminar..

241
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,678
..because they are old now?
Why don't you speak?

242
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:41,838
We don't.
- This is the same.

243
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:44,798
Nobody stops getting married
because they've grown old.

244
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:46,878
I can't wait anymore.
Let's fix a wedding date.

245
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:47,758
What did you say?

246
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,958
Wait! If you think
of beating me up..

247
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:51,278
..even I can arrange
for you to get beaten up.

248
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,558
Do you know Babji in this city?

249
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,118
Do you know him?

250
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:57,998
If I make a phone call,
he'll come and beat you up.

251
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,798
Listen to me!
Nobody can stop this wedding.

252
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:02,998
Hey, Boss is Babji's right hand.

253
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,558
We hid our weapons since
you are a software man.

254
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:06,798
Boss, shall we kill him?

255
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:10,118
Wait! I understood
the matter clearly now.

256
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,438
If we fight inside,
all your furniture will break.

257
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:15,438
If you want to fight,
come to Gymkhana Grounds.

258
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:19,238
Hey! I'm just one man.
You are twenty men.

259
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:22,038
Bring another twenty men.
Make it twenty twenties.

260
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:26,038
You can bring more men
but don't bring fewer men. Run!

261
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,278
Hey!

262
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,838
I infuriated them
and ran away with fear.

263
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:31,798
Those angry men couldn't catch me.

264
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,798
But they have my phone number.

265
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:37,718
They are messaging me
all the abuses in Telugu.

266
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,958
They are even
threatening to kill me.

267
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:41,838
You did all this behind my back?

268
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,381
Is it not wrong to show
your teenage photo and..

269
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,421
..go to see the girl in old age?

270
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:46,901
I did a bigger mistake than that.

271
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:47,701
What is that?

272
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:48,821
I used Babji's name.

273
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,781
If he finds out about this matter,
he'll surely kill me.

274
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:53,981
You are scared of Babji, aren't you?
- Yes.

275
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,341
Let's go to his house.
- No!

276
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:57,981
We shouldn't touch fire
or mess with a hoodlum.

277
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,301
I will mess with him for you.
Let's go.

278
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:05,101
Hi, man!

279
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:06,181
Whom do you want?

280
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,181
Babji.

281
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:08,821
Boss is busy in a settlement.
Wait outside.

282
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:09,901
Okay.

283
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,501
We ourselves are hoodlums.

284
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:26,101
How dare you occupy our land?

285
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:34,781
I will kill you if you
touch my name or my property.

286
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,501
Uncle..

287
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:54,501
What is it?

288
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:55,421
Look at that girl.

289
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,381
You should have
devotion in a temple..

290
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,781
..and fear in a goon's house.

291
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:02,981
Why are you seeing a girl
in his house? Turn your head.

292
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,061
She's beautiful, uncle.
- No!

293
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,141
She looks as if she's made for me.

294
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:07,021
Listen..

295
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:07,981
Uncle, if I hook up with this girl..

296
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,461
..we don't have to come
here for any settlements..

297
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:13,581
..they themselves will come to us.
How is the idea?

298
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,381
You'll get into deep trouble.

299
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,021
We came here to clear a problem,
not to create it.

300
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,621
I don't want this settlement.
I'm going home.

301
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,901
Turn your face this side, please.

302
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:25,461
Hey! The boss called you inside.

303
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:35,461
Nephew, we got a
visual of his cruelty.

304
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:37,701
It's better to leave from here.

305
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:39,621
I'm with you. Let's go inside.

306
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,261
Hello, sir!

307
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:48,741
Boss, this is the man
that came to see my sister.

308
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:50,181
Not me, it was my uncle.

309
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:53,181
He looks good. Why don't
you get her married to him?

310
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:56,221
Not this one, boss.
It's the one that is hiding behind.

311
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,101
Hello, sir.

312
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,821
What nonsense!
Why do you want to get married..

313
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,221
..at an age where you
should get others married?

314
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:06,261
Not just age,
everything is more in him.

315
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:08,261
He is using boss's
name like a credit card.

316
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:09,861
He threatened me that
he'll get me beaten up..

317
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:10,981
..by giving a call to our boss.

318
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,821
How dare you threaten my men..

319
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:15,821
..by using my nephew's name?
What is your name?

320
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,061
'Jalebi' (Sweetmeat)!

321
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,102
'Jalebi'?

322
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,781
What kind of a name is that?
I've never heard it before.

323
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,901
My dad had a sweet shop.
His specialty was 'Jalebi.'

324
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:27,741
I'm special in my family,
so they named me that.

325
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:28,661
Jalebi!

326
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,621
Is that so? What is your name?

327
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:31,461
Cherry!

328
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:34,421
Cherry? Is there a story
behind your name as well?

329
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:35,941
Just Cherry, it's a nickname.

330
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,221
His name is a sweetmeat
and your name is a fruit.

331
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,741
Does that give you license
to use others' names?

332
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:40,861
Teach them a lesson.

333
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,701
Wait! Don't the
people of Hyderabad..

334
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,061
..have a right to
use Babji sir's name?

335
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,779
People are crazy about him.
He has love for his people.

336
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,139
So, he used his name. Is that wrong?

337
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:55,179
What was my question
and what is your answer?

338
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:56,419
What are you talking about?

339
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:57,859
I didn't understand
a thing you said.

340
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,339
It's enough if he understands it.

341
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,259
Babji sir's name is as
famous as 'Biryani' in Hyderabad.

342
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:11,339
We used Babji sir's name
to get a seat in the convent.

343
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:14,259
We used Babji sir's name
to get a seat in the college.

344
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:17,419
Just as people of Hyderabad
need water from Gandipet..

345
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,979
..they need Babji sir's name.

346
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:19,699
What do you say, uncle?

347
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:24,379
Are you flattering him?

348
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:25,699
Uncle!
- What?

349
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:26,379
Let him speak.

350
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,339
Go ahead.

351
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:28,899
You tell me.

352
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,499
They stand beside
you but don't know..

353
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,699
..the power you have in the public.

354
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,659
Power Star Pawan Kalyan movie.
First day, first show.

355
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,059
Will any of them get a ticket?

356
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:37,699
We won't get.

357
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:41,339
But I will get it because
I use Babji sir's name.

358
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:42,619
If you take Babji sir's name..

359
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:43,579
..the police won't
ask for your license..

360
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:44,539
..the traffic police
won't ask for your RC..

361
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,619
..they won't ask
you money in the bunk.

362
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,299
Is it wrong to use such
a powerful person's name?

363
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:50,419
What is your point?

364
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:53,779
Will you use his
name everywhere you go?

365
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:54,819
Uncle!

366
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:55,659
What?

367
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,419
We'll know what is
our value in the market..

368
00:23:58,579 --> 00:23:59,899
..when we talk to such
people every now and then.

369
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:00,899
You are correct, sir.

370
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,939
Sir, if you don't mind,
can I take a photo with you?

371
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:03,859
Yes.

372
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:04,859
Uncle, click a photo.

373
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:06,499
You just used his name till date.

374
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:07,499
Will you use the photo now?

375
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,019
Just wait, sir.
Please put your hand on me.

376
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:09,939
Go ahead.

377
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,059
Brother, I'm going to the college.

378
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:16,379
Is she your sister?
- Yes.

379
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:17,779
Uncle, click a photo
with her as well.

380
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,259
Hey, what is this new twist?

381
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:20,619
Why do you want a photo with her?

382
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:21,499
Click a photo, uncle.

383
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:22,579
This is not working.

384
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,779
Will you click a photo
if it starts working?

385
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:26,539
Why do you need
a single girl's photo?

386
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:27,579
What's wrong in that?

387
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,579
They'll get publicity.

388
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:30,499
They'll print posters
and distribute them.

389
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:32,419
Can't you see that
they are ruffians?

390
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:33,619
You go to the college, dear.

391
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:34,499
Please go, dear.

392
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,259
Sir, which college
is she studying in?

393
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:37,419
Why do you want to know that?

394
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,179
Why did we come here?
What are you asking him?

395
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:42,019
Uncle, if we know which
college she studies in..

396
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:43,299
..we won't go to that area.

397
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:44,899
If any of my friends go there,
I'll warn them..

398
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:45,899
..saying that Babji sir's
sister is studying in that college.

399
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:46,859
What do you say, sir?

400
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:47,699
Correct.

401
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,579
B.Tech final year,
Shreya Engineering College.

402
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:52,499
Give him all the details.
Pin code, postal address..

403
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:54,539
..height, weight,
zodiac sign and everything else.

404
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:57,139
Someday he'll come with a good plan.

405
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,299
What are you saying?

406
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,459
I came here to meet Babji sir.

407
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:02,059
Why do you talk as if I
came to flirt with his sister?

408
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:03,859
Shut up! Do you know where you are?

409
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,059
Why are you talking about flirting?

410
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:06,099
You are in Babji sir's house.

411
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,579
Why are you involving
his sister in all this?

412
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:08,579
Stop it!

413
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,379
Sir, no matter what they say,
I'm a huge fan of yours.

414
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,499
It is enough if you understand me.

415
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:13,779
I can understand
a man by his words..

416
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,819
..and his character by his eyes.

417
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:16,819
You are great, sir.

418
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:19,299
You can meet me
whenever you want to.

419
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,219
Thank you, sir.
Just a small request.

420
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:23,099
Please tell them
not to harm my uncle.

421
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,179
They won't harm him.

422
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,099
Thank you, sir.
- Go.

423
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:26,259
Bye.

424
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:29,339
Sir, you are super!

425
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,099
What happened to your voice, uncle?

426
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:37,939
Did you lose it?

427
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,699
Not just my voice,
I might lose my life because of you.

428
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:42,579
Why did you want to
take a photo with that girl?

429
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:43,699
They will kill you.

430
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:44,819
I don't care what happens.

431
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:46,539
I like that girl. I love her.

432
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,299
Do as you wish. Drive carefully.

433
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:49,859
Where are we going?

434
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:50,819
We are going to her college.

435
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:51,459
Hey!

436
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,219
Madhu!

437
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:04,419
You've rejected me every
time I proposed to you.

438
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,419
If you don't say you love me,
I'll jump down from here.

439
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,299
Will you say it or should I jump?

440
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,379
Madhu, don't give him time to think.
Say you love him.

441
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,099
Otherwise he'll jump.
He'll jump just one time.

442
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:17,779
The TV people will
show it hundred times..

443
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:19,019
..and shut down the college.

444
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,139
But the TV people are not here.

445
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,659
We don't need TVs and cameras, dear.

446
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:22,539
Everyone has cell phones.

447
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:24,099
The students are
already shooting it.

448
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,619
Madhu!

449
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:26,539
Say it, dear.

450
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:27,539
What is this, sir?
- Wait, sir!

451
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:28,619
Does she have to love everybody..

452
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:29,939
..that climbs to the
top and threatens her?

453
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:31,659
Listen to me and
get down immediately.

454
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:34,219
I'll get down if she
says that she loves me.

455
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,723
Madhu, there's no time.
Say that you love me.

456
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,763
Don't think, otherwise I'll jump.

457
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:45,163
He is someone crazier than you.

458
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,003
Nobody is crazier than me.

459
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,483
Madhu, will you say
it or should I jump?

460
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:54,603
Say it, dear.
If he really jumps down..

461
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:55,563
..you'll go to prison
and I'll go to the court.

462
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:56,443
Madhu!

463
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:00,963
Why did he climb
higher than that fellow?

464
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:04,163
Madhu, I'll jump down
if you say that you love him.

465
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:09,123
That boy is not
from our college, sir.

466
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,643
But he climbed up in our college.

467
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:11,843
Who are you?

468
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:13,683
It doesn't matter who I am.

469
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,363
Only what I want matters.

470
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:17,443
Madhu should not
say that she loves him.

471
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,243
I've seen people jumping
demanding to be loved.

472
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:23,483
But he is demanding a refusal.
He is a weirdo.

473
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,523
What will you do now, dear?

474
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:26,003
If you say yes to one,
the other man will jump.

475
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:27,043
Don't worry, dear.

476
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:28,123
Please don't make her nervous.

477
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:31,043
Decide which one will
jump and which one will stay.

478
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,163
What is this, brother?

479
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,163
I put in the tender but you're
trying to take the contract.

480
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:36,363
Why are you ruining my efforts?

481
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:37,603
Why are you putting in efforts?

482
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:40,203
It's useless to try and
call a phone that's switched off.

483
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:42,403
Stop overacting and get down,
I'll tell you a truth.

484
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,523
What is that truth?

485
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:44,643
I'll tell you if you get down.

486
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:45,563
Okay.

487
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,003
He got down.
He put some magic spell on him.

488
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:51,043
What is that truth?

489
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,003
You can threaten
anybody for your love.

490
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:54,323
But you shouldn't
threaten the one you love.

491
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,003
That girl is mine, so go your way.

492
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:57,963
What? Is this the truth
you wanted to tell me?

493
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,843
Brother,
you don't know her brother Babji.

494
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:02,043
He is a murderer.
You can't win with him, you'll die.

495
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,483
How will you win with him?

496
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:04,683
He himself can't win with me.

497
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:05,603
Why is that?

498
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:06,563
You concentrate on your studies.

499
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:08,003
You'll understand all this later.

500
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:09,523
Hey!

501
00:28:10,763 --> 00:28:11,523
Where are you going?

502
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:12,603
I'm going to meet Madhu.

503
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,323
Why do you want to meet Madhu?

504
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:16,003
I'm holding my heart tight
so that it doesn't stop beating.

505
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:17,043
Come, let's go home.

506
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,083
Come with me, uncle.

507
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:19,123
Where are you taking me?

508
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:20,883
You handled the situation very well.
- Thank you.

509
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:21,923
Thanks, son.

510
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,123
Bye, son.
- Okay, sir.

511
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:24,443
Thanks a lot.

512
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,683
Will you just thank me
for taking such a big risk?

513
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:28,403
What else will she say?

514
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:30,363
What else will Babji
sir's sister say? Let's go.

515
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:31,283
Wait a minute, uncle.

516
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:35,003
If you don't mind..
I think I love you.

517
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:36,123
Hey!

518
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:37,923
Why are you walking away?

519
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,083
I'll tell it to my brother.

520
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:42,639
God, please save us.

521
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:44,479
Why do you never get worried?

522
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,439
What will you get by worrying?

523
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,719
You will die.

524
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,639
Okay, let's go.

525
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,479
Babji! Babji!

526
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,439
Did you see what that rascal did?

527
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,919
He went up to the tenth
floor and threatened..

528
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,519
..that he'll jump down if
our girl didn't say she loves him.

529
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:57,399
No, uncle.

530
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,719
Whatever it is, did he do it or not?

531
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,799
He used your name behind
your back all this while.

532
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:02,999
Now he is using your family.

533
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,519
If we leave him,
tomorrow he'll demand..

534
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,639
..that she should
get married to him.

535
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,639
Why are you sitting
without saying a word?

536
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,959
Will you get her married to him?

537
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:12,839
Cherry!

538
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,279
When did he come?

539
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,239
Ask him.

540
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,919
Cherry told me what
actually happened there.

541
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:22,999
Should I tell them as well, sir?

542
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:26,239
No need. A guy threatened
that he'll jump down..

543
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,799
..if sister doesn't
say that she loves him.

544
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,839
Cherry risked his
life and saved her.

545
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,079
Did he save that guy?

546
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,799
No, he saved sister.

547
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,639
It is not about climbing
up and down a building.

548
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:38,719
He harassed her to
say that she loves him.

549
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,279
If you get an electric shock..

550
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,359
..l'll hit you with
a stick to save your life.

551
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,679
Does that mean that I hit him, sir?

552
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,879
The whole drama revolved
around 'I love you,' sir.

553
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,919
By mistake I must've
said I love you, sir.

554
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:51,239
Will I ever talk wrongly
about you or wrong you?

555
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:52,159
What do you say, uncle?

556
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,919
Babji! Don't believe him.

557
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:56,799
He is saying yes with
his eyes and no with his lips.

558
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,879
Sir, they are jealous that
I might become close to you.

559
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,879
That's why they are painting
a wrong picture about me.

560
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,359
And they are even using
your beautiful sister for that.

561
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,359
How dare you stand before us and..

562
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,279
Shut up!

563
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,959
It's up to me whether
I believe them or not.

564
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,639
I trust you.
Thank you for saving my sister.

565
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:16,759
You may go.

566
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,079
You are super, sir.

567
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,199
Uncle, let's go.

568
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:21,439
Okay.

569
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,719
I knew that flattery
blinds a person.

570
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,999
But he proved that
it can break a family too.

571
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,639
I'm very angry.
Don't utter proverbs before me.

572
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,239
I will break all your bones.

573
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,519
You said something to
him and something else to her.

574
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,959
And you said everything to me.

575
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,879
They will kill you if they find out.

576
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,159
Oh, I won't let them find out.

577
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,039
Jalebi!

578
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,759
Go! Move! Do your work. Move!

579
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,239
Did you call me, dear?

580
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,119
I shouted your name.

581
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:54,839
Where is he?

582
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,439
I don't know.
I cut off his friendship yesterday.

583
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,159
It's not enough if
you cut it off with him.

584
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,799
Tell him to cut it off with me.

585
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,239
He should come to
me in ten minutes..

586
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,839
..and say that he doesn't love me.

587
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,759
Otherwise I will get you killed.

588
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,062
Yeah!

589
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:10,942
Sir, why are you happy
after being abused by her?

590
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:14,582
I expected a tsunami,
but it was a simple cyclone. Go.

591
00:31:15,622 --> 00:31:18,302
Thank God! Now I know that
this girl doesn't love him.

592
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:21,302
If I make him say the same,
I'll get rid of this nuisance.

593
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,062
It was so much fun.

594
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:29,502
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

595
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,022
It's not good for a girl
that drinks cold coffee..

596
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,502
..to take such hot decisions.

597
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:34,262
Who are you?
What are you talking about?

598
00:31:34,422 --> 00:31:36,662
Even though I'm facing you,
this topic is hers.

599
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:38,822
If the topic is hers,
why don't you tell it to her?

600
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:42,022
I'm afraid to tell it to her face.
I might love her again.

601
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:43,582
Cherry! What did you come here for?

602
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,862
And what are you saying now?

603
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:46,022
Okay, I'll say it.

604
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,302
Is it wrong if a person
that travels in an auto..

605
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:48,262
..dreams of driving a car?

606
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,062
Not at all.

607
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:50,982
Is it wrong for a
handsome guy like me..

608
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,902
..to fall in love with
a slim and trim girl like her?

609
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:54,862
No.

610
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:55,702
Just shut up!

611
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,982
Okay. If you want to talk to me,
come directly to me.

612
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:02,422
Why are you troubling
my bachelor uncle?

613
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:03,462
Please don't create a scene.

614
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:04,982
If you use a credit
card with no balance..

615
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:07,422
..it will be declined,
it won't give you money.

616
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:09,422
Don't scare my uncle
who is already scared.

617
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,062
I'm dropping out. Goodbye!

618
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:12,382
Thank God!

619
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,782
My dear fellow,
you'll have a good future.

620
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:15,822
Why did you stop?

621
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:16,862
I'll tell her something and be back.

622
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,102
What is it again?
- I'll tell you.

623
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:20,702
Excuse me!

624
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,622
Hello! You can agree
with me if you listen as well.

625
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:25,662
No country thrives if
it insults lovers and laborers.

626
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,422
A beautiful girl like you
should promote love, not break it.

627
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,182
When you reject a lover,
think why you are rejecting him.

628
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:34,142
Think about it with
a cool mind. Bye.

629
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,702
Finally,
did you leave that girl or not?

630
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:41,102
Will we leave the thread
if we lose the kite?

631
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:56,222
Sir, an enquiry based on
the detection of sniffer dogs..

632
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:57,862
..revealed that some people
took a man called Singh..

633
00:32:57,982 --> 00:33:00,542
..from here just before
Taxi Seth was murdered.

634
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,382
This is the house, sir.

635
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:24,502
Does this mean that Singh
killed all those men, sir?

636
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:27,742
No, that's not possible.

637
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:30,262
How can a few goons kidnap a man..

638
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:32,702
..that could brutally
kill so many men?

639
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:36,702
Their leader is somebody else.

640
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:38,542
Sir, I found this slip inside.

641
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,462
Their next target is Hyderabad.

642
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:45,982
Since he booked a ticket
from Kolkata to Hyderabad..

643
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:48,382
..the criminal is
definitely in Hyderabad.

644
00:33:58,982 --> 00:34:00,022
Yes, I reached Hyderabad.

645
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:12,102
Go away.

646
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,142
Hello! Don't give
money to such people.

647
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:16,662
Do you know about them?

648
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:18,262
They beg for money with a sad face..

649
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:20,822
..they finance money with
a daily interest of 10 rupees.

650
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,782
They do real estate
business on city outskirts.

651
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:27,022
They beg in the mornings
as a side business. Got it?

652
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,542
Did you take some finance from them?

653
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:31,582
No way. These are the
general topics at signals.

654
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,262
I told you what everybody says.

655
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:35,502
Don't tell everyone
what everybody says.

656
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,942
Okay.

657
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:38,782
Go.

658
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:43,342
You have high fever.

659
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:45,142
Why are you begging
under the hot sun?

660
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:47,542
I need to do this
no matter how sick I am.

661
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:48,662
Otherwise they will kill me.

662
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:50,022
Who?
- Dasu.

663
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:54,462
Fever? Will you
go to Apollo Hospital?

664
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:57,462
You get fever, headache,
and cough only if you are alive.

665
00:34:57,622 --> 00:34:59,022
You'll get none of
these after you die.

666
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,862
Boss, please don't kill my son.

667
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:05,062
Show these sentiments while begging.

668
00:35:06,502 --> 00:35:09,262
You've to bring 100 rupees
a day whether you live or die.

669
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:11,462
Otherwise,
you will have no life at all.

670
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:16,622
And he also pulls out
the eyes of newborn babies.

671
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:27,502
He is a very good dancer.

672
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:28,982
Since he'll become a
great man if he dances well..

673
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:30,742
..he chopped off his legs.

674
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:36,102
His men are spread in bus
stands and railway stations.

675
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,382
They pick up new
children that come here..

676
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,262
..saying that they'll provide work.

677
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:45,142
Once he finds you,
you will die but never escape.

678
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,022
Why don't you complain
to the police?

679
00:35:47,142 --> 00:35:50,542
He already killed two
people who tried to do that.

680
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:54,782
We are living there in
fear not knowing what to do.

681
00:35:58,262 --> 00:35:59,102
Where can I find him?

682
00:36:05,142 --> 00:36:06,782
Why are you sitting
here so leisurely?

683
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:08,782
Are you the ones on night duty?

684
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:09,662
Yes, boss.

685
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:11,462
You eat three times a day but..

686
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:13,062
..go for collections
just one time a day.

687
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,822
Why can't people give
notes instead of coins?

688
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:18,022
I have a tough time counting them.

689
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:20,709
Every first day of the month,
it feels like..

690
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:24,902
..Goddess Laxmi is walking in here.

691
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:27,582
Why live a cheap life with coins?

692
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:30,422
Whether it is Ambani's
money or begged money..

693
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,542
..the market rate is the same.

694
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,382
Whether they are coins or notes..

695
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:37,582
..they get the same
value in the market.

696
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:39,422
Should I tell you
something about change?

697
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:42,502
25 paisa today,
50 paisa tomorrow and 1 rupee later.

698
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,742
How much will that come
to at the end of the month?

699
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:53,232
The calculator can't
fit in the whole number.

700
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:55,272
And these bags are not
enough to hold all the money.

701
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:57,432
If Dawood lbrahim and Chota
Rajan find out the income..

702
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,312
..in this business, they'll
leave their mafia gangs abroad..

703
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:01,152
..and start a similar business here.

704
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:05,112
Look at my son.
He looks like a hero.

705
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,712
How is my dress, dad?

706
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:11,512
I'll spend 100 million rupees and..

707
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:13,352
..make a movie with you as the hero.

708
00:37:13,752 --> 00:37:15,592
Even if the beggars
in the market see it..

709
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:16,592
..your movie will run for 100 days.

710
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:18,312
I don't want to be a hero.
Songs and fights are boring.

711
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,512
I'll become a villain. It
will be fun to do rapes and murders.

712
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:21,472
You are already doing that.

713
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:22,672
But everybody will see
me if I do it in a movie.

714
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:25,912
Who are you?

715
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,272
Why are you beating him?

716
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:31,712
Stop it!

717
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:35,832
He will die!

718
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:38,712
I want him to die.

719
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:44,552
How dare you come to
my area and beat my son?

720
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:47,272
It is not climate that
changes with the area.

721
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,632
It is courage.

722
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:51,392
Can't you bear to see
your son getting beaten up?

723
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:53,312
How can others bear
to see when your son..

724
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,712
..tortures their little children?

725
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:57,272
Poisonous flowers.
He'll just lose his sight.

726
00:37:57,672 --> 00:37:58,792
Please don't harm my child.

727
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:00,912
She'll keep crying. You go ahead.

728
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:03,792
No!

729
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,832
I'm warning you! Let my son go!

730
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:11,872
Are you Mother Teresa's
heir to save the orphans?

731
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:14,152
Tell him about me.

732
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,152
Why do you want to mess with them?

733
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:17,992
They chop off people's
hands and legs for coins..

734
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:19,752
..and do their
business on busy roads.

735
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,232
You look like a young guy.

736
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,432
Go and chat with girls.
Don't get into fights.

737
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,032
Hey! Break his bones!

738
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:19,432
Kill him!

739
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,152
Hello! Is this the police station?

740
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:10,632
Will you treat humans
worse than animals?

741
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:22,712
Are these the fingers
that pulled out the eyes..

742
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:24,832
..of infants that should
play in their mother's laps?

743
00:40:25,952 --> 00:40:28,752
Are these the hands
that gave begging bowls..

744
00:40:28,912 --> 00:40:30,752
..to small children
instead of school books?

745
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:32,632
Please let him go.

746
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,352
All the parts in my
brother's body are shaken.

747
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,232
All his bones are broken.
Please leave him.

748
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,672
What are you thinking, sir?

749
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:41,352
There's no other part in
his body left except his head.

750
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,552
Sir, don't mind that
he didn't salute you.

751
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:49,792
Brother is not in a
state to lift his hands.

752
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:51,392
I have a small request.
- Shut up!

753
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:53,952
He'll live if you take him
in an ambulance instead of a jeep.

754
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,512
He can at least spend
his life in a prison.

755
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:58,352
Congrats for saving all
of them by taking such a risk.

756
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,752
You should be doing this, not me.

757
00:41:01,232 --> 00:41:02,512
We?
- Yes, you.

758
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:04,830
You go to see a minister
if he's traveling on road.

759
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:06,147
But you totally ignore
the small children..

760
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:09,067
..that are begging on the same road.

761
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,347
For TRP ratings,
you'll run SMS contests..

762
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:13,027
..whether Aishwarya Rai
will have a son or a daughter.

763
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:15,827
You'll give details of gross,
share and shake..

764
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:18,547
..of a superstar's movie
but ignore such children.

765
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:21,587
Media should work for public,
not for publicity.

766
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:25,907
Look, stop writing about me.

767
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:27,867
There are many people
that do good to the society.

768
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:29,947
There are many people
that responded to a newspaper..

769
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:31,867
..that stated that a man
needs 500,000 for an operation.

770
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:33,547
Inform such people
about these people.

771
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:37,507
Think about ways needed
to help these people. Please.

772
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:41,667
You are a real hero, brother.

773
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,467
We might've heard about
liquor mafia or drugs mafia.

774
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:48,867
But human mafia is
more dangerous than that.

775
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:50,387
A man shattered that mafia
and sincerely responded..

776
00:41:50,547 --> 00:41:52,027
..to the atrocities being
done in the society and..

777
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:54,907
..saved hundreds of
orphans with great courage.

778
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:57,707
This software young
man Cherry is being..

779
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:00,387
..congratulated on Facebook,
Twitter and through e-mails.

780
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:03,507
I like him now. I'll finalize him.

781
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:25,547
Oh.

782
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:28,387
Why did you stop?

783
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:29,867
I feel shy.

784
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:31,787
You look handsome when you feel shy.

785
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:36,267
Oh.. Why did you come
here all of a sudden?

786
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,267
Actually Cherry has robbed my peace.

787
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:41,107
He gave a new life to many orphans.

788
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:44,187
I felt he is a good man.
You should hook us up.

789
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,427
Why are you guys torturing me?

790
00:42:46,587 --> 00:42:47,427
Please.

791
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:49,307
Why do you need my mediating, dear?

792
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,707
Why don't you talk to him yourself?

793
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,947
He is very unpredictable.
He might suddenly refuse.

794
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:56,747
I have huge ego.
So, please make him come to me.

795
00:42:57,147 --> 00:43:00,107
Oh, so you have huge ego.
Let me take care of that.

796
00:43:00,387 --> 00:43:04,187
You have ego,
I have fear, and he has pride.

797
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:06,187
Let's forget about this love now.

798
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:07,307
Jalebi!
- Yes, dear.

799
00:43:07,427 --> 00:43:08,667
I'm very short-tempered as well.

800
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:11,227
Oh God! I'm stuck!

801
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:12,667
I'll try, dear.

802
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:14,520
Cherry!
- Yes?

803
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,787
Do you like me?

804
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:17,627
I even left the girl
I love for you, uncle.

805
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:19,827
No, please continue
loving that girl.

806
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:22,067
Is this an internet connection
to cut when you don't want..

807
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:24,347
..and connect it back when
you want it? It is my heart.

808
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:25,547
Don't give me quotations.

809
00:43:25,707 --> 00:43:26,387
Huh?

810
00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:28,249
She heard that you
saved some orphans.

811
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:30,169
Since then she has
decided not to let you go.

812
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,929
Come and tell her that you love her.

813
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:34,769
What? Won't she love
me if I don't save anyone?

814
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:36,169
I don't want such a girl, uncle.

815
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:37,449
I want someone that
likes me just the way I am.

816
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:39,089
Why will someone like
you the way you are?

817
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:40,769
Are you Abraham Lincoln
or Bill Clinton?

818
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:42,609
Uncle!
- Please, I beg of you.

819
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:45,249
Okay. I have a huge ego,
so tell her to come to me.

820
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,689
Huge ego?
Did you hear our conversation?

821
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:48,769
No! Why do you ask?

822
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,329
Even she said the same thing.

823
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:52,569
We all are just kids.
Why cling to our egos?

824
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:53,249
Come and talk to her.

825
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:54,769
I can't bend lower than this.

826
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:55,809
Go and bring that girl to me.

827
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:56,889
She said she'll kill me.

828
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:57,889
Don't take her seriously.

829
00:43:58,009 --> 00:43:58,889
She said she'll kill herself.

830
00:43:59,049 --> 00:43:59,889
Don't take her seriously at all.

831
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:00,809
Darn!

832
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:15,769
Why are you crying
in the washroom, sir?

833
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:18,009
Do I need your
permission to cry here?

834
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:20,009
Won't you let me even cry in peace?

835
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:21,329
Okay, sir. Continue crying.

836
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:22,449
Wash your hands.

837
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,329
Cherry will get
me into deep trouble.

838
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:27,449
Oh dear!

839
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:36,849
I don't know how many
murders this will lead to.

840
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:56,689
I fell in love at
first glance of yours

841
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:58,969
I fell for this smile of yours

842
00:44:59,209 --> 00:45:02,409
I got snared by just one word..
I am done for

843
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:06,889
I am retracing my steps

844
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:08,969
My strength is all spent

845
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:12,529
I can't eat anything
due to your delusion

846
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:20,089
My body is shivering with fever

847
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:24,449
I am overcome with shyness, O god

848
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:29,329
Good lord!
Your beauty has set me on fire

849
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:51,209
I fell in love
at first sight of you

850
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,289
I fell for this smile of yours

851
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:24,409
God has put up some
link between you and me

852
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:28,849
That's why my heart
is dancing with joy

853
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:32,729
I'll have you as my beloved
in the future lives too

854
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:37,329
I like you and offered
my heart to you

855
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:42,289
I landed in your lap
and seek your protection

856
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:44,289
No! No! No!

857
00:46:44,729 --> 00:46:48,929
O god! She has intoxicated me!

858
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:53,569
O lord! I'm reaching for the skies

859
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:33,129
You have come with the
speed of light and stole my heart

860
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:37,729
You come to my dreams
daily and drown me with kisses

861
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:41,369
I've got a twitching
eye looking for you

862
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:46,129
O girl,
your lips are a savory sweet

863
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:51,329
You've changed my life..
how did you manage this

864
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,129
No! No! No!

865
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:57,649
O god! I feel the
coolness of the moonlight

866
00:47:57,889 --> 00:48:02,089
O lord! I am sweating
in the peak of winter

867
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:19,809
I fell in love at
first glance of yours

868
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:22,049
I fell for this smile of yours

869
00:48:49,529 --> 00:48:51,569
Cherry is going
around with our madam.

870
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,809
We need to tell this
to boss immediately.

871
00:48:57,408 --> 00:48:58,805
It's not sister's fault, boss.

872
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:01,365
Even a twig starts blossoming
if you water it every day.

873
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:05,645
Shut up, you fool!
He watered our girl, not a twig.

874
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:08,205
He is at fault for
giving him that chance.

875
00:49:11,045 --> 00:49:11,845
What did you say?

876
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,525
You can understand
a person from his words..

877
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:14,805
..and his character
from his eyes, is it?

878
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:17,805
What did you understand?
He made a fool of you.

879
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:23,565
Darn! I couldn't hear
his flattery for you.

880
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:28,845
When I stopped him,
you cut me short saying Uncle!

881
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:29,885
What will you do now?

882
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,965
Your sister will say that
she wants to get married to him.

883
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,485
I've to kill him.

884
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:35,965
Huh?

885
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:39,205
I cannot tolerate betrayal.

886
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:43,485
He should die before sister
tells me about her love.

887
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:44,485
That's like my boy.

888
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:45,525
Come on, find him.

889
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:55,125
Should we kill him?

890
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:56,045
Shut up!

891
00:49:56,605 --> 00:49:58,925
Boss, he is going
around with a helmet.

892
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,565
He stopped at Khairatabad signals.

893
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:01,525
What do you want me to do?

894
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:04,245
A helmet saves from accidents,
not problems.

895
00:50:04,365 --> 00:50:06,245
Follow him.
We are starting from here now.

896
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,605
Yes, boss.
- Where is he?

897
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:18,685
He went down the flyover
and took a left turn.

898
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:19,845
Should we ram our
jeep into his bike?

899
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,085
No! Babji himself will kill him.
You follow him.

900
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:24,365
Okay, boss.

901
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:32,325
Boss, he came to State Home.

902
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:33,525
We are nearby.

903
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:35,445
Boss, won't it be
risky to kill him here?

904
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,045
It is better to kill him there.

905
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:38,845
The news will spread
in all the state.

906
00:50:40,085 --> 00:50:41,205
Mother!
- Yes?

907
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:43,645
Take these 100 rupees
and keep this packet with you.

908
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:45,125
I'll come back and get it later.
- Okay.

909
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,485
Mother! Give me the packet.

910
00:50:57,085 --> 00:50:58,005
Here it is.

911
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:03,525
Boss, he went inside.

912
00:51:03,845 --> 00:51:04,805
Let's go.
- Okay.

913
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:30,005
Babji, this murder should
be the highlight of all crimes.

914
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:39,525
Sir, the DGP is in a meeting.
You can't go this way.

915
00:51:39,885 --> 00:51:41,925
Give our greetings to sir.
You know my nephew, don't you?

916
00:51:42,005 --> 00:51:42,805
Yes sir.

917
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:43,805
Let's go now.

918
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:50,565
Where is this fellow?

919
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:53,365
Boss, he is there.

920
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,645
Go and finish him right there.

921
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,987
He shot the DGP in a second.

922
00:52:35,267 --> 00:52:37,307
It takes 10 days for
us to just say hello to him.

923
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:41,147
The murder is cancelled.
We don't know his background.

924
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:43,467
We should leave before he sees us.

925
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:45,347
Turn around.

926
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,587
Uncle! My heart is beating fast.

927
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,787
I'm in the same condition.

928
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:51,427
Why did our family
get involved with him?

929
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:53,347
Is he gone?

930
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:55,267
Will he survive after
taking in so many bullets?

931
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:58,067
You fool! I meant the killer,
not the dead man.

932
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,907
I think he is gone, boss.

933
00:53:01,067 --> 00:53:02,187
Thank God!

934
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,667
Why did he get such high fever?

935
00:53:05,827 --> 00:53:06,747
I can feel the heat here.

936
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:07,987
This is not some viral fever.

937
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:09,707
He got it because of a sudden shock.

938
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,587
Did he see any shocking
incident from close?

939
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:12,907
Yes, we did see something like that.

940
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:15,187
No medicines will work on him.
Just forget it.

941
00:53:15,547 --> 00:53:16,347
Forget what? My nephew?

942
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:17,467
No, the incident you saw.

943
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:19,547
DGP was killed right
in the State Home.

944
00:53:20,027 --> 00:53:22,907
Who killed him amidst so many VIPs?

945
00:53:23,187 --> 00:53:26,347
Are they terrorists,
gangsters or naxalites?

946
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:28,307
The police are investigating
into this case.

947
00:53:28,987 --> 00:53:30,987
Babji, we were very lucky.

948
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:33,667
If we went and asked
him why he loves our girl..

949
00:53:33,787 --> 00:53:35,747
..he would've pointed
that gun at us.

950
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:36,587
Which gun, sir?

951
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:37,427
What do you have to do with that?

952
00:53:37,587 --> 00:53:39,279
We got stuck in a problem
because of ill-luck. You leave.

953
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,347
Okay, sir.

954
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:43,947
Brother!
You were alright in the morning.

955
00:53:44,107 --> 00:53:45,067
Why did you get this
fever all of a sudden?

956
00:53:45,227 --> 00:53:46,307
You are responsible for this.

957
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:47,787
What did I do?

958
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:48,947
You..

959
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:52,787
I understood. I should behave
as if I don't know anything.

960
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:53,907
Go inside.

961
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:54,947
I need to talk to brother.

962
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,947
It would be better if you
give him some poison and kill him.

963
00:53:57,187 --> 00:53:58,827
Can't you see that
he has high fever?

964
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,307
What do you want to talk now?
Go away.

965
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:02,307
Wait, uncle!
Today is a very auspicious day.

966
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:03,507
For what? To kill him?

967
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:04,707
Uncle!

968
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:08,267
Brother, I love someone.

969
00:54:08,427 --> 00:54:09,507
That's a wonderful thing.

970
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,307
He is burning like
an electric heater.

971
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:12,427
Is it necessary to
give him this news now?

972
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:16,307
Uncle, brother will be
happy to know whom I love.

973
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,267
He got fever because of that man.

974
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:20,747
Brother, the man I love
is a huge fan of yours.

975
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:21,947
Who is that? Cherry?

976
00:54:22,187 --> 00:54:24,707
He is a smooth talker.
Don't trust him at all.

977
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:27,387
Uncle, you didn't like
him from the beginning.

978
00:54:27,747 --> 00:54:29,147
Brother will be upset if
you talk negatively about him.

979
00:54:29,427 --> 00:54:32,467
Darn! Babji, why do we
have to endure this torture?

980
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:33,387
Please go, dear.

981
00:54:33,627 --> 00:54:34,587
Uncle..

982
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:36,987
Brother, Cherry is here to meet you.

983
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:37,867
He is here?

984
00:54:49,627 --> 00:54:51,667
What is this, sir?
I thought you had a strong body.

985
00:54:51,867 --> 00:54:52,707
What happened to you?

986
00:54:52,987 --> 00:54:55,347
He became like this after
seeing something shocking.

987
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:56,347
What did he see?

988
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:58,707
They've killed the
DGP who protects the state.

989
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:00,547
He is already suffering
with high fever.

990
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:02,067
Why are you showing
him such crime news?

991
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,987
Was this the shocking
thing that you saw?

992
00:55:06,227 --> 00:55:08,067
Why will we see that?
We didn't see anything.

993
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:09,027
We don't know anything about it.

994
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:10,987
All the fools here are
going through a bad week.

995
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:15,307
I think she must've
already told you about me.

996
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:18,467
She said you never refused
her anything since childhood.

997
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:21,587
I came to you with courage
hoping you won't refuse me.

998
00:55:22,374 --> 00:55:24,827
I hope you don't have any objection.
Is that a yes?

999
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:26,387
Why doesn't he speak?

1000
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,347
How can we refuse? We agree to it.

1001
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:30,307
Smile, Babji.
Then he'll believe you.

1002
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:32,307
That is a smile.

1003
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:33,507
Thanks, brother.

1004
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:34,587
I'm very happy. Thank you.

1005
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,027
You should actually thank me.
- Why?

1006
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:38,027
Who is responsible
for your love? Me!

1007
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:41,387
I went to see his
sister and use his name.

1008
00:55:41,627 --> 00:55:44,187
Then I brought you
here and you saw this girl.

1009
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:45,227
Then this girl liked you and..

1010
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:47,563
Hey! Stop your nonsense.

1011
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,690
You got what you wanted. Now leave.

1012
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,650
If you don't mind,
I'll take Madhu home..

1013
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,770
..and introduce her to my family.

1014
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,810
How can he refuse?
Take her with you.

1015
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,890
Wow! You are really great, sir.

1016
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:02,690
Please don't flatter me.
Take her with you.

1017
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:03,850
Bye!

1018
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:04,770
Jalebi!

1019
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,330
Did you call me, sir?
- Yes.

1020
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,130
Cherry, you take her home.

1021
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,530
I'll give a party to your
uncle for hooking you up with her.

1022
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:13,690
Okay, sir.

1023
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,090
Uncle, enjoy.

1024
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,010
Thank you.

1025
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,570
Babji sir's sister
is going to get married.

1026
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,810
What about your sister?

1027
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,050
Why don't you settle for me?

1028
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,370
Don't give me those serious looks.

1029
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,570
Now my background is
bigger and stronger than you.

1030
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:30,650
Plate!

1031
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,050
Why is the plate so big?

1032
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,050
Food!

1033
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,730
Why did you serve me so much food?

1034
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,770
It will reduce if you
start eating. Come on.

1035
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,210
Can anyone eat so much food?

1036
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,490
Even he can't eat so much.

1037
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,970
What is this, sir?
Ask them to remove half of it.

1038
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,890
Jalebi! I feed others
with a lot of love.

1039
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,730
You should finish all
that is served in your plate.

1040
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,450
You should eat whatever I serve you.

1041
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,170
You should eat it in whatever
way I tell you to eat.

1042
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,530
Otherwise I'll lose
my control and kill you.

1043
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,290
Oh! I think this is a murder scheme.

1044
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,330
Others beat you to death,
but he will feed me to death.

1045
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:04,330
Start eating.

1046
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:06,170
I will eat.

1047
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,010
Oh God!

1048
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,810
My stomach is in pain.

1049
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,930
I will die!
I will get stuck in this!

1050
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,210
All the parts in the
body are filled with food.

1051
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,410
How did you eat so much food?

1052
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,370
I didn't eat, sir.
They stuffed the food into me.

1053
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,050
How can they stuff so much?
Tell me the real story.

1054
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,970
Take your hand off.
Is this a table to rest your hands?

1055
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,690
What? Okay, now..

1056
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,170
Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1057
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,210
Why do you ask questions
when I'm dying?

1058
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:35,170
It's not like that.

1059
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:39,570
Forget that.
Operate on me and take the food out.

1060
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:40,490
I beg of you.

1061
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,690
We can operate to get the baby out,
not the food.

1062
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,770
This is the body, sir.

1063
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:07,130
We have all the recordings
of the CCTV cameras..

1064
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:08,530
..in the State Home
from the day of the murder.

1065
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:09,690
Second camera.

1066
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,450
Second camera.

1067
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:17,890
Third camera.

1068
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,490
Hey, who are they?
They are present in all the cameras.

1069
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,770
A famous rowdy called Babji.
And that is his uncle.

1070
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:29,690
What is he saying?

1071
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,330
His voice was not recorded, sir.

1072
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,570
Is there anyone in the
Intelligence Department..

1073
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,290
..that can read his lips
and give us the dubbing?

1074
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,290
We have someone, sir.

1075
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:40,170
Who is he?

1076
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,850
Sir, he is the man you
wanted to see from Intelligence.

1077
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:47,850
Hello, sir.

1078
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,730
I think he is a drunkard.

1079
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:52,450
Yes, sir. I'm always in
mufti and fully intoxicated.

1080
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,490
Duty and drink are like my two eyes.

1081
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,650
Do you drink continuously?

1082
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,290
No, sir. I drink it for courage
when I've to arrest someone.

1083
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,930
After that I drink in
fear that he many harm me.

1084
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:04,770
I drink with joy when officers
like you appreciate me.

1085
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:05,970
I drink with sadness
if you don't appreciate me.

1086
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,290
But you have to drink
all the time, is it?

1087
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,850
I strongly feel that
everyone in Intelligence..

1088
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,570
..is addicted to some habit.

1089
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,490
Okay, show him the tapes.

1090
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,890
Play.

1091
00:59:21,399 --> 00:59:22,330
Stop.

1092
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,610
Rewind the tape.

1093
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:31,290
Babji, this murder should
be the highlight of all crimes.

1094
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,610
Great! Great sync.

1095
00:59:33,994 --> 00:59:36,010
You've synced the lips perfectly.

1096
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,930
CBI's duty is to link
or sync something, sir.

1097
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:41,345
Bring them to my office.

1098
00:59:41,425 --> 00:59:42,410
Okay, sir.

1099
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:45,610
Will you go alone
or will you take support?

1100
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:47,370
You should take
friends to a wine shop.

1101
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,970
But you should go
alone to the criminals.

1102
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:49,970
Am I correct, sir?

1103
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,490
You are correct. I like you.

1104
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,850
I too, sir.
- Go ahead.

1105
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:56,539
I'm afraid to think
about the future, uncle.

1106
00:59:56,939 --> 00:59:58,739
We can't achieve anything
by being afraid or sad.

1107
00:59:58,979 --> 01:00:00,299
The remote is in his hands.

1108
01:00:00,419 --> 01:00:01,779
We should watch whatever
channel he plays.

1109
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:03,339
We can do nothing about it.

1110
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:05,059
Hi!

1111
01:00:06,699 --> 01:00:09,019
His house is better
than the Mansion House.

1112
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:10,499
Who are you?
What are you looking at?

1113
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:12,379
I'm thinking of how
to reveal the matter.

1114
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:14,659
We are not doing anymore
settlements. Leave.

1115
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,379
Why are not you doing them?

1116
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,459
Should I give you a reason?
My son is not well.

1117
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:19,539
Why is he not well?

1118
01:00:19,979 --> 01:00:21,739
Why are you drinking in my house?

1119
01:00:21,899 --> 01:00:22,779
Are you out of your mind?

1120
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:24,339
A vehicle needs petrol to run.

1121
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:25,939
My mouth needs a drink to talk.

1122
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:27,859
He is acting too smart. Finish him.

1123
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,659
Wait! I'm a CBI agent
that came to interrogate..

1124
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,339
..about the man
you already finished.

1125
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,059
My officer is waiting in the office,
let's go.

1126
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,779
We never go to the station
when the police call us.

1127
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:40,179
Will we come now for the CBI?

1128
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:41,739
We won't come anywhere. Just leave.

1129
01:00:41,979 --> 01:00:44,059
I'm not a policeman
to leave when you ask me to.

1130
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:47,379
I'm from CBI.
Central Bureau of Investigation.

1131
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:50,939
Our Head Office is in Delhi,
not your street.

1132
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:55,499
If you don't come with me,
you'll be in deep trouble.

1133
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:04,259
Come on.

1134
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:05,539
Go ahead. We'll follow you.

1135
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:08,819
Hello!
- Hello!

1136
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,659
So, what do you do?

1137
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:12,379
We do small settlements, sir.

1138
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:13,699
You fool! Shut your mouth!

1139
01:01:13,899 --> 01:01:16,099
We do small settlements, sir.

1140
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:16,819
What do you mean?

1141
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:20,699
We deal with land and
family matters of poor people.

1142
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,539
When a couple has disputes
and decide to separate..

1143
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:25,139
..we say, the relationship
between wife and husband..

1144
01:01:25,299 --> 01:01:27,939
..should be like fish and water..

1145
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:31,259
..not like fish and
fisherman and unite them.

1146
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:33,939
Why did you go to
State Home on 21st?

1147
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:38,819
State Home? What is that?
We don't know where it is.

1148
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:41,139
Since our Babji was ill,
we were at home.

1149
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:43,059
We haven't stepped
out for over a week.

1150
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,379
False. That's a lie.

1151
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:45,979
Tell me the truth.

1152
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:48,859
Why will we lie?
What are you talking about?

1153
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:50,099
Even we have a circle of friends.

1154
01:01:50,259 --> 01:01:52,019
We know ministers and MLAs.

1155
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:53,379
Don't underestimate us.

1156
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:55,299
So, did you go to meet them?

1157
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:56,979
Where did we go? Whom did we meet?

1158
01:01:57,179 --> 01:01:58,579
What are you asking about?

1159
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:16,139
What were you saying there?

1160
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:20,699
I said, Today is Friday,
let's go to the temple, Babji.

1161
01:02:20,939 --> 01:02:22,139
The murder took place on a Tuesday.

1162
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:25,539
Darn! How can I remember
if it was a Friday or Tuesday?

1163
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:26,779
Do you think we
committed that murder?

1164
01:02:26,899 --> 01:02:29,219
Since I'm an old man,
I was telling him some good things.

1165
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:30,659
Why are you making
a big issue out of it?

1166
01:02:30,939 --> 01:02:32,779
Oh! Good things, is it?

1167
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:40,179
Babji, this murder should
be the highlight of all crimes.

1168
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:46,659
There's something wrong
with those dialogues.

1169
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:50,899
That's right. I said those words.

1170
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:52,859
Why should I lie?
I said that dialogue.

1171
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:54,259
I said those words
in that situation.

1172
01:02:54,499 --> 01:02:55,419
What was that situation?

1173
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,499
Some guy trapped our girl.

1174
01:02:57,779 --> 01:02:59,099
We got information
that he was there..

1175
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:00,539
..and so we went there to warn him.

1176
01:03:00,979 --> 01:03:02,299
But before that,
the matter got twisted like this.

1177
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:04,939
So, the murderer is the
guy who trapped your girl?

1178
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:10,979
Please don't drag
us into this issue.

1179
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:13,059
Was he there when
the murder took place?

1180
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:14,059
Yes. Oh no, I don't know.

1181
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:18,379
Please don't ask us about him.

1182
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:20,699
My boy has fever. I have chest pain.

1183
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:21,739
And I have blood.

1184
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:23,899
Don't mind that. Sir hit you.

1185
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:25,299
You may leave now.

1186
01:03:25,659 --> 01:03:27,259
Is that all? We can go?

1187
01:03:27,459 --> 01:03:29,979
CBI is very simple. Let's go.

1188
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:34,019
Hey! What is the name
of the guy who loves your girl?

1189
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:35,681
Charan! His nickname is Cherry.

1190
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:36,561
What does he do?

1191
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:37,601
He's a software engineer.

1192
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:38,441
In which company?

1193
01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:39,241
What is it?

1194
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:41,441
CG Tricks. Madhapur, Phase-2.

1195
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:42,921
You may leave now.

1196
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:48,121
Sir, why did you
let those criminals go?

1197
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,441
You shouldn't save the bottle
after the drink is finished..

1198
01:03:49,761 --> 01:03:50,801
..and the witnesses after
the matter is finished.

1199
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:52,841
They witnessed the murder,
but that man committed it.

1200
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:53,761
Am I correct, sir?

1201
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:55,161
How can you be so sure?

1202
01:03:55,281 --> 01:03:56,841
They had fear in their
eyes and tremor in their voices..

1203
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,361
..when you mentioned him.

1204
01:03:58,521 --> 01:03:59,481
I noticed that you noticed that.

1205
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:03,201
You are right. You are
drunk but your mind works well.

1206
01:04:03,401 --> 01:04:04,321
Thanks for your compliment.

1207
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:05,721
Then let's arrest than man, sir.

1208
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:07,961
Sir should say that, not you.

1209
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:09,521
He is not killing ordinary men.

1210
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:11,361
He completed his target
even in the midst of..

1211
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:16,081
..so many ministers,
MLAs and security guards.

1212
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:18,601
Looking at his dedication,
determination and..

1213
01:04:18,761 --> 01:04:21,561
..decision power,
I can't understand..

1214
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:24,841
..if he is one man
or hundred thousand men.

1215
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:29,401
We need strong
evidences to arrest him.

1216
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:31,681
Based on the details they gave us..

1217
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,121
..get me his whole bio-data.

1218
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:39,641
Sir!
- Yes?

1219
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,201
We've got all the date of CG Tricks.

1220
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:43,521
See Charan's details
in the staff list.

1221
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:51,361
See if he went to work
on the day of murder, the 21st.

1222
01:04:55,161 --> 01:04:56,001
He was on leave, sir.

1223
01:04:56,081 --> 01:04:57,051
Yes!

1224
01:04:57,131 --> 01:04:59,481
Match this photo with
CCTV cameras in State Home.

1225
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:09,841
We didn't find a match there, sir.

1226
01:05:10,121 --> 01:05:11,320
Most brilliant criminal.

1227
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:13,481
He made sure he wasn't
captured in any camera.

1228
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:15,361
But I saw him in TV once, sir.

1229
01:05:16,281 --> 01:05:16,801
When?

1230
01:05:16,961 --> 01:05:18,521
He exposed a human mafia last month.

1231
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:19,641
The people who got
beaten up by him..

1232
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:21,081
..and got arrested
are in the prison now.

1233
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:22,961
Bring them here.

1234
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,801
Get down, brother.

1235
01:05:31,201 --> 01:05:32,161
Be careful.

1236
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:38,481
Be careful.
Why are you in such a hurry?

1237
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:42,321
Be careful.

1238
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:43,281
Hello, sir!

1239
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:47,321
When you walk, why does
it sound like a robot walking?

1240
01:05:47,601 --> 01:05:49,281
Did you hear the
sound of iron rods, sir?

1241
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:50,161
Yes.

1242
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,241
Except for liver,
heart and kidneys..

1243
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:53,241
..everything else is
made of steel in their bodies.

1244
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:54,041
What do you mean?

1245
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:56,241
A guy beat them up
and powdered their bones.

1246
01:05:56,641 --> 01:05:57,721
Since they couldn't
be attached together..

1247
01:05:57,881 --> 01:05:58,961
..we managed to put them
together with steel rods.

1248
01:06:00,561 --> 01:06:04,521
His mashed up all the
bones in their bodies.

1249
01:06:06,441 --> 01:06:07,401
Even this is steel, sir.

1250
01:06:08,281 --> 01:06:09,401
Even their skulls were broken.

1251
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:13,241
Was he the one that beat you?

1252
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:16,081
It's him! It's him!

1253
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:18,801
His photo is dislocating
all the rods in their bodies.

1254
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:20,281
Please turn that around, sir.

1255
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,161
He turned it, brother.

1256
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:23,761
Didn't you try to
take revenge on him?

1257
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:26,361
Will we hit the transformer
if we get an electric shock?

1258
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:28,921
They have intelligence
but no information, sir.

1259
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:30,641
We don't need any more information.

1260
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:34,161
He is the one that
we are searching for.

1261
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:39,841
Hello, sir!

1262
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:42,401
CBI! Did you catch him or not?

1263
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:43,881
I've got Intelligence reports that..

1264
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,521
..he is going to kill
me in the Kumbh Fair.

1265
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:47,481
What are you guys doing?

1266
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:49,121
He can't kill you, sir.

1267
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:51,761
When you return from Kumbh Fair..

1268
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:53,681
..he'll be standing
before you in handcuffs.

1269
01:06:54,346 --> 01:06:55,601
You can go there boldly, sir.

1270
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:03,401
Go and search!

1271
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:05,081
This side.

1272
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,037
Search everywhere.
Go upstairs. This way.

1273
01:07:10,077 --> 01:07:11,357
Don't leave any room.

1274
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:12,757
Search everywhere.

1275
01:07:14,557 --> 01:07:16,277
What is this commotion?

1276
01:07:16,477 --> 01:07:17,277
What are you guys doing here?

1277
01:07:17,637 --> 01:07:20,237
Who do you think lives here?
Babji's brother-in-law.

1278
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:22,837
We are searching for him.
We are from CBI.

1279
01:07:23,437 --> 01:07:24,197
Who are you?

1280
01:07:24,357 --> 01:07:26,077
I'm Cherry's uncle.
My name is Jalebi.

1281
01:07:26,197 --> 01:07:26,997
Jalebi?

1282
01:07:27,117 --> 01:07:29,037
Yes. Unfortunately,
my name is Jalebi.

1283
01:07:29,277 --> 01:07:30,517
You should've named
yourself Spicy Chips.

1284
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:31,517
They go well with drinks.

1285
01:07:32,117 --> 01:07:33,317
We searched everywhere, sir.
He is not here.

1286
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:34,717
Whom are you searching for?

1287
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:36,477
Cherry. Where is he?

1288
01:07:36,757 --> 01:07:37,557
He went to the Khumb Fair.

1289
01:07:39,197 --> 01:07:42,157
Khumb Fair? Let's go. Pick him.

1290
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:45,077
Sir, I have a tummy upset.

1291
01:07:47,117 --> 01:07:47,797
Did you get him?

1292
01:07:47,957 --> 01:07:49,317
No, sir. His phone
is continuously engaged.

1293
01:07:49,757 --> 01:07:50,997
I think he is talking
to his girlfriend.

1294
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:52,597
Keep trying.

1295
01:07:56,677 --> 01:08:00,637
O my god! Feel the way I feel..
fill me up with love

1296
01:08:19,517 --> 01:08:22,477
O damsel..
you cut through like a knife

1297
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:27,317
Don't shine like the lightning
and send shivers down my spine

1298
01:08:27,557 --> 01:08:31,077
O damsel..
you cut through like a knife

1299
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:36,397
Come down like the thunder
and give what I seek

1300
01:08:36,997 --> 01:08:38,757
I am getting intoxicated

1301
01:08:39,277 --> 01:08:40,997
I am being driven mad

1302
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,717
This rashness of yours
is causing all this

1303
01:08:45,757 --> 01:08:49,517
I want to share this
love and offer you my beauty

1304
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:53,157
Why can't you be more patient

1305
01:08:53,637 --> 01:08:56,957
Madam! Madam!

1306
01:08:57,557 --> 01:09:01,397
Just be my madam

1307
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:05,877
I love you, love you, madam

1308
01:09:06,117 --> 01:09:08,077
My love is true

1309
01:09:08,597 --> 01:09:10,717
Let's seal this pact, my love

1310
01:09:11,597 --> 01:09:14,557
O damsel..
you cut through like a knife

1311
01:09:15,677 --> 01:09:19,557
Come down like the thunder
and give what I seek

1312
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:58,517
I saw the dreams of
a happy home and immense love

1313
01:09:58,797 --> 01:10:02,837
I felt shy seeing all
that and left it to providence

1314
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:07,397
I keep smiling in spite
of the burden on my heart

1315
01:10:07,557 --> 01:10:09,437
Come to me, my love

1316
01:10:09,597 --> 01:10:12,117
Come to me, my protector

1317
01:10:12,277 --> 01:10:16,917
Come to me without any delay

1318
01:10:17,157 --> 01:10:21,037
I come to satisfy your wish..
not necessarily what you asked

1319
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:25,677
One must be given
that which can't be asked

1320
01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:30,477
Madam! Madam!

1321
01:10:31,237 --> 01:10:34,957
Just be my madam

1322
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:39,397
I love you, love you, madam

1323
01:10:39,957 --> 01:10:41,877
My love is true

1324
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:44,757
Let's seal this pact, my love

1325
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:48,037
O damsel..
you cut through like a knife

1326
01:10:50,877 --> 01:10:53,237
Don't shine like the lightning
and send shivers down my spine

1327
01:10:53,797 --> 01:10:57,477
O damsel..
you cut through like a knife

1328
01:10:57,877 --> 01:10:59,317
Don't just walk away like that

1329
01:10:59,557 --> 01:11:01,957
Give me what I seek

1330
01:11:02,197 --> 01:11:03,917
Come to me,
the greatest lover of the world

1331
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:06,077
Come to me,
the greatest worker of the world

1332
01:11:06,237 --> 01:11:10,597
Come to me and don't
let this chase go begging

1333
01:11:34,997 --> 01:11:38,717
Sir, I've seen Khumb Fair in TV,
but never in person.

1334
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,959
Why did you spend so
much to give me a free trip?

1335
01:11:42,277 --> 01:11:43,557
I'll tell you.
First call up your nephew.

1336
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:44,637
Okay, sir.

1337
01:12:05,477 --> 01:12:08,117
May God fulfill all your desires!

1338
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:37,477
Yes, uncle.

1339
01:12:37,637 --> 01:12:38,957
Where are you?

1340
01:12:39,237 --> 01:12:40,077
Put on the speaker.

1341
01:12:40,237 --> 01:12:41,117
I'm in the Khumb Fair.

1342
01:12:41,397 --> 01:12:42,477
Even I'm in the fair.

1343
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:43,757
When did you come here?

1344
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:46,357
I'll tell that later.
First tell me where you are.

1345
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:47,597
I'm at Lord Shiva's temple.

1346
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:48,677
We got him.

1347
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:21,677
Freeze! Are you
removing your gun out?

1348
01:13:21,957 --> 01:13:25,397
Should I be quiet when
you kill everyone before me?

1349
01:13:31,197 --> 01:13:33,197
Sir, my son is a software engineer.

1350
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:34,637
How can he kill somebody?

1351
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,157
You'll understand everything
in the interrogation.

1352
01:13:37,357 --> 01:13:38,677
They caught our brother. What now?

1353
01:13:39,037 --> 01:13:39,917
He is not our brother.

1354
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,117
No? Then where is our brother?

1355
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:25,917
Let's go to the vehicle.

1356
01:14:26,077 --> 01:14:27,517
Brother will finish him and come.

1357
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:44,085
Sir, let's go to
the hospital please.

1358
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,805
I thought he was dead,
but he's still alive.

1359
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:50,365
He killed my brother and DGP.

1360
01:14:52,845 --> 01:14:55,325
I should kill him!

1361
01:14:56,245 --> 01:14:56,925
Hey!

1362
01:14:57,045 --> 01:14:59,285
Sir, as per rules, we shouldn't
fire weapons in Khumb Fair.

1363
01:14:59,445 --> 01:15:00,205
Forget the rules.

1364
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:01,889
Take him to the hospital.

1365
01:15:49,997 --> 01:15:52,717
I'm really sorry.
Since you both look the same..

1366
01:15:52,877 --> 01:15:54,197
..I unnecessarily doubted you.

1367
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,357
You are not connected to this.
You may leave.

1368
01:15:56,637 --> 01:15:57,677
Sir, who is that man?

1369
01:15:57,997 --> 01:15:59,317
Why do you want to know
about a murderer? Let's go.

1370
01:15:59,477 --> 01:16:00,357
Wait a minute, uncle.

1371
01:16:01,997 --> 01:16:03,437
We are at the railway station
because they caught him.

1372
01:16:03,837 --> 01:16:05,157
Otherwise we would've
been in the police station.

1373
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:07,277
Sunrise and sunset look the same..

1374
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:08,917
..but the temperatures differ.

1375
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:10,877
In a similar way,
you are so different from him.

1376
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:16,277
Just a minute.

1377
01:16:20,277 --> 01:16:21,957
Why are you touching that man?

1378
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:24,157
It says that he is a hero.

1379
01:16:24,437 --> 01:16:27,117
The media writes anything
they want for circulation.

1380
01:16:27,477 --> 01:16:28,957
Everyone tries to get
rid of their problems.

1381
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,077
But you are trying to get into one.

1382
01:16:30,437 --> 01:16:32,917
I want to know about
the man that looks like me.

1383
01:16:43,717 --> 01:16:46,037
Rawat! Down! Down!

1384
01:16:46,317 --> 01:16:49,157
Rawat! Down! Down!

1385
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:58,717
Rawat! Down! Down!
Save our lives!

1386
01:16:58,997 --> 01:17:01,677
Rawat! Down! Down!
Save our lives!

1387
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:04,317
Rawat! Down! Down!
Save our lives!

1388
01:17:05,277 --> 01:17:08,797
You ask us to shut down factories.

1389
01:17:09,237 --> 01:17:11,517
But the government
asks us to build factories.

1390
01:17:11,677 --> 01:17:12,397
What should we do now?

1391
01:17:12,517 --> 01:17:14,877
The government asked
you to manufacture medicines..

1392
01:17:15,037 --> 01:17:17,117
..not drugs like
'charas' and heroine.

1393
01:17:17,557 --> 01:17:19,917
Because of the illegal
drugs manufactured by you..

1394
01:17:20,077 --> 01:17:20,917
..the air and water
are getting polluted..

1395
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,957
..and people are
dying of failed lungs.

1396
01:17:24,517 --> 01:17:26,677
Understand our problem
and shut down the factory.

1397
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:28,957
The factory is not
polluting the environment.

1398
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:31,757
Your illegal slums are polluting it.

1399
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:35,117
Go and dwell somewhere else. Go!

1400
01:17:35,357 --> 01:17:37,597
We won't move! Move your factory!

1401
01:17:38,197 --> 01:17:39,517
It is not some toy
to move it around.

1402
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:43,117
It is a factory built
with 10 billion rupees.

1403
01:17:43,277 --> 01:17:45,277
People's lives are
more important than money.

1404
01:17:46,157 --> 01:17:47,117
Badvel!

1405
01:17:54,957 --> 01:17:56,117
Yes, brother!

1406
01:17:56,597 --> 01:17:59,397
If one man gets a scolding,
10 men will be afraid.

1407
01:18:00,037 --> 01:18:02,197
If one man gets beaten up,
100 men will be afraid.

1408
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:04,957
If one man gets killed,
100,000 men will be afraid.

1409
01:18:05,557 --> 01:18:06,317
Kill him!

1410
01:18:07,397 --> 01:18:08,197
Oh God!

1411
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:13,037
Grandpa!

1412
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:16,597
There's no pollution in heaven.

1413
01:18:17,357 --> 01:18:19,957
Would you like to join him there?

1414
01:18:26,317 --> 01:18:29,397
Nobody that talks against
me or acts against me..

1415
01:18:29,517 --> 01:18:31,277
..should step into Kolkata.

1416
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:51,237
He's coming from hostel
after a long time. See properly.

1417
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:52,397
I'm seeing properly.
Don't eat my brains.

1418
01:18:52,517 --> 01:18:53,277
Oh dear!

1419
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,197
Siddhu is there!

1420
01:18:54,357 --> 01:18:55,157
Where?
- There!

1421
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:56,277
Sister!
- Siddhu!

1422
01:18:56,397 --> 01:18:57,077
Hi, sis!
- How are you?

1423
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:57,917
I'm good.

1424
01:18:58,077 --> 01:18:58,877
Hi, Siddhu!
- Hi!

1425
01:18:59,037 --> 01:18:59,837
How are you?

1426
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:00,917
Did you prepare well for the exams?

1427
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:01,917
I did what I could.

1428
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:03,477
Don't make him talk too much.

1429
01:19:03,717 --> 01:19:07,277
I took an off from the
hospital and came to meet him.

1430
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:08,397
How can you ask
me not to talk to him?

1431
01:19:08,557 --> 01:19:10,117
You shouldn't talk to him.
That's all.

1432
01:19:10,237 --> 01:19:11,717
He was silent when he
wrote his 10 standard exams.

1433
01:19:11,837 --> 01:19:12,997
So, he came first in the state.

1434
01:19:13,277 --> 01:19:14,957
If he remains silent even now..

1435
01:19:15,077 --> 01:19:16,877
..he'll come first in
central railway exams too.

1436
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:19,357
I have a strong mind, sis.
Even if I scream around..

1437
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:21,717
..not a single word will
be deleted from my mind.

1438
01:19:21,877 --> 01:19:24,077
Whatever it is, you will not talk.
That's it.

1439
01:19:24,357 --> 01:19:25,077
Hello!

1440
01:19:25,197 --> 01:19:26,597
What is this?
How can she tell you not to talk?

1441
01:19:26,797 --> 01:19:27,917
We'll continue talking in secret.

1442
01:19:28,117 --> 01:19:28,957
Shall we go?

1443
01:19:29,077 --> 01:19:29,877
Shouldn't we get a coolie?

1444
01:19:29,997 --> 01:19:31,477
Why? My husband will carry the bags.

1445
01:19:41,397 --> 01:19:42,477
If you don't talk
as your sister said..

1446
01:19:42,637 --> 01:19:43,517
..everyone will think you are dumb.

1447
01:19:43,837 --> 01:19:45,237
Sis, let me talk a little.

1448
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:48,237
Okay. Take a shower and freshen up.
I'll cook food.

1449
01:19:48,357 --> 01:19:49,197
Thanks.

1450
01:19:56,037 --> 01:19:58,197
Cousin Siddhu! When did you come?

1451
01:19:59,717 --> 01:20:01,157
What are you looking at?

1452
01:20:04,357 --> 01:20:07,197
Why are you so stunned?
Say something.

1453
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,237
Put on some clothes
or close the door.

1454
01:20:10,517 --> 01:20:12,197
Everything I studied
is going out of my mind.

1455
01:20:12,442 --> 01:20:15,677
Is that so?
Now everything will come back.

1456
01:20:17,997 --> 01:20:18,917
Only half came back.

1457
01:20:22,674 --> 01:20:24,072
If he writes this exam and becomes..

1458
01:20:24,232 --> 01:20:26,112
..a railway superintendent,
he'll be settled in life.

1459
01:20:26,312 --> 01:20:27,952
Since he has nobody
else except for us..

1460
01:20:28,072 --> 01:20:28,952
..we'll get him married
and fulfill our responsibility.

1461
01:20:29,072 --> 01:20:30,952
Why don't you get
him married to my sister?

1462
01:20:31,312 --> 01:20:34,192
Your sister is superfast
and my brother is dead slow.

1463
01:20:34,432 --> 01:20:35,312
How will they manage?

1464
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:36,712
He'll sit in a corner like me.

1465
01:20:36,872 --> 01:20:37,592
What did you say?

1466
01:20:37,712 --> 01:20:38,592
I said they'll be happy like us.

1467
01:20:38,712 --> 01:20:39,512
Hmm.

1468
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,512
My husband went around
the whole of Kolkata..

1469
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:45,352
..and brought your favorite fish.

1470
01:20:45,672 --> 01:20:46,592
Thanks.

1471
01:20:47,432 --> 01:20:48,192
Hi!

1472
01:20:50,352 --> 01:20:52,272
Didn't you recognize her?
She's my sister.

1473
01:20:52,512 --> 01:20:54,832
Oh! I saw her just
once in your wedding.

1474
01:20:55,072 --> 01:20:57,112
'I'm glad he didn't say
that he saw me without clothes.'

1475
01:20:57,272 --> 01:20:58,752
She attended the campus
interviews recently.

1476
01:20:58,912 --> 01:20:59,712
She is waiting for the results.

1477
01:20:59,872 --> 01:21:00,632
Is that so?

1478
01:21:00,952 --> 01:21:02,712
'Wow, you are a good actor.'

1479
01:21:02,912 --> 01:21:03,592
Sit down.

1480
01:21:03,752 --> 01:21:04,432
It's okay.

1481
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:05,432
Please sit down.

1482
01:21:06,672 --> 01:21:07,792
She doesn't look like
the girls of this generation.

1483
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:09,152
I think she is a quiet girl.

1484
01:21:09,392 --> 01:21:13,632
Not at all.
She is shy as she met you just now.

1485
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:15,232
'Shy? This girl?'

1486
01:21:18,232 --> 01:21:19,912
Badvel murdered another man.

1487
01:21:20,472 --> 01:21:23,272
Muslim brother Riyaz
was brutally killed..

1488
01:21:23,432 --> 01:21:26,192
..for demanding to stop
the pollution from the factory.

1489
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:28,152
Whenever there's a murder
or crime in the city..

1490
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:30,032
..the names connected
with that crime are..

1491
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:33,912
..Rawat and his brothers
Badvel and Taxi Seth.

1492
01:21:34,432 --> 01:21:36,312
But their crimes are never proved.

1493
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:38,752
The public and the
police know who killed him.

1494
01:21:39,152 --> 01:21:40,032
Don't the media know?

1495
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:41,192
What will you do if we tell you?

1496
01:21:41,352 --> 01:21:43,072
You'll telecast it
till they kill us, right?

1497
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,152
Who is this Rawat, sis?

1498
01:21:44,392 --> 01:21:45,672
They've been telling
about him from so long.

1499
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:47,592
They are rascals.

1500
01:21:47,952 --> 01:21:49,712
Kolkata hears about
them almost every day.

1501
01:21:50,032 --> 01:21:51,912
That's why we are
planning for a transfer..

1502
01:21:52,072 --> 01:21:53,872
..so that we can get
away from all these things.

1503
01:21:54,072 --> 01:21:55,432
Don't the police do anything?

1504
01:21:55,872 --> 01:21:57,232
There are no police
that can arrest them..

1505
01:21:57,392 --> 01:21:59,232
..or men that can
confront them in Kolkata.

1506
01:21:59,472 --> 01:22:00,312
Those goons are
doing what they want..

1507
01:22:00,472 --> 01:22:01,632
..because nobody is
ready to fight against them.

1508
01:22:02,072 --> 01:22:04,632
If someone confronts them,
they'll get scared.

1509
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:07,312
Why should we discuss about them?
Forget it.

1510
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:11,672
Yes, we shouldn't discuss
what happens around us.

1511
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:13,072
No matter what happens to others..

1512
01:22:13,232 --> 01:22:14,192
..we should be happy, right?

1513
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:17,472
This is not our state or our city.
Forget it.

1514
01:22:17,872 --> 01:22:19,592
Even Mother Teresa
wasn't from Kolkata.

1515
01:22:21,952 --> 01:22:23,432
She came to another
country to serve others..

1516
01:22:23,592 --> 01:22:26,352
..and inspired millions of people.

1517
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:29,592
These goons are walking
in the Kolkata that she lived in.

1518
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:36,592
Someone should confront
them one day or the other.

1519
01:22:37,192 --> 01:22:38,232
Oh dear, finish your food.

1520
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:40,152
Listen..
- Brother!

1521
01:22:42,617 --> 01:22:43,992
Close the case immediately.

1522
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,712
Sir, they are taking
Rawat and Badvel's name.

1523
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:49,192
Will they take our names instead?

1524
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:50,272
Change them in the FIR.

1525
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:52,312
Hello, Rawat sir! Bless me!

1526
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:54,112
Come in.

1527
01:22:54,388 --> 01:22:58,392
Greetings! Bless me! Hello!

1528
01:22:59,032 --> 01:23:01,232
You are my follower and partner.
Sit here.

1529
01:23:01,312 --> 01:23:04,152
No, sir. I'll gain confidence
when I sit at your feet.

1530
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,392
He always does overacting.

1531
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:08,395
I heard you were called to Delhi.

1532
01:23:08,555 --> 01:23:10,115
You take care of
the center from now.

1533
01:23:10,275 --> 01:23:11,115
Your brother will
take care of the state.

1534
01:23:11,275 --> 01:23:12,475
Why two politicians in one family?

1535
01:23:12,715 --> 01:23:14,755
You are correct.
The government always says..

1536
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:16,355
..that one is enough and
two are a crowd in a family.

1537
01:23:16,835 --> 01:23:19,675
That is about children,
not about movies or politics.

1538
01:23:19,915 --> 01:23:21,275
Here, the more people
the more benefit.

1539
01:23:21,675 --> 01:23:22,875
Am I right, brother?

1540
01:23:23,235 --> 01:23:24,115
What about the liquor tender?

1541
01:23:24,435 --> 01:23:25,515
The minister refused to
give us the contract saying..

1542
01:23:25,635 --> 01:23:28,715
..there are enough liquor
shops for people to drink..

1543
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,275
..and anymore shops will
bring his government down.

1544
01:23:31,235 --> 01:23:32,755
Yes, sir.
That minister is a useless man.

1545
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,595
He is always concerned
about the people

1546
01:23:35,115 --> 01:23:36,635
Correct. When we occupied
some land illegally..

1547
01:23:36,915 --> 01:23:38,475
..he created more fuss
than the people themselves.

1548
01:23:38,835 --> 01:23:39,995
You've helped him win
and become a minister..

1549
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,395
..thinking that he'll
be useful to us..

1550
01:23:41,555 --> 01:23:43,835
..but he has kept my
promotion still pending, sir.

1551
01:23:44,235 --> 01:23:45,195
Call him up!

1552
01:23:49,115 --> 01:23:51,315
Hello, Rawat sir!
I understood the matter..

1553
01:23:51,475 --> 01:23:53,435
..as soon as I got a call from you.

1554
01:23:55,315 --> 01:23:59,115
I think all your men
instigated you against me.

1555
01:23:59,355 --> 01:24:01,075
Don't act too smart
because you have a post..

1556
01:24:01,195 --> 01:24:02,555
..and gunmen besides you.

1557
01:24:03,115 --> 01:24:04,835
I'll make your gunmen shoot you.

1558
01:24:06,155 --> 01:24:07,835
You should apply henna
only to your fingers.

1559
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:10,075
You shouldn't apply it to
your body because it gives color.

1560
01:24:10,675 --> 01:24:11,875
Try to understand.

1561
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:16,595
You and your brother killed
a man before 10,000 people.

1562
01:24:16,835 --> 01:24:19,235
Not just me, even my men
are trying hard to manage it.

1563
01:24:19,475 --> 01:24:21,675
And talking about your men,
they created..

1564
01:24:21,835 --> 01:24:24,955
..false land documents
for Mother Teresa's lands.

1565
01:24:25,195 --> 01:24:27,835
He put his mother's name
and he his grandma's name.

1566
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:28,915
Will the people keep silent?

1567
01:24:29,075 --> 01:24:29,875
Why won't they be silent?

1568
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:31,035
Is Mother Teresa still alive?
No, she is not.

1569
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:32,835
Why do dead people need land?

1570
01:24:33,075 --> 01:24:34,795
So, I put my mother's name on it.
Is that wrong?

1571
01:24:35,035 --> 01:24:36,715
Shut up! If you say those
words in the assembly..

1572
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:39,035
..the opposition
party will abuse you.

1573
01:24:39,155 --> 01:24:40,193
So what?
- Stop.

1574
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:43,304
You shouldn't think of
people when you are in power.

1575
01:24:43,664 --> 01:24:44,504
You should think about our men.

1576
01:24:44,824 --> 01:24:45,464
But that's not..

1577
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:48,384
When I come back from Delhi..

1578
01:24:48,704 --> 01:24:50,144
..I should see him as the DGP..

1579
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,464
..and these men should be happy.

1580
01:24:51,864 --> 01:24:52,664
Understood?

1581
01:24:57,104 --> 01:24:58,344
Siddhu!

1582
01:24:59,544 --> 01:25:00,704
Let's go to a movie.

1583
01:25:00,824 --> 01:25:01,624
Why a movie now?

1584
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,784
I already told them
to book the tickets.

1585
01:25:03,144 --> 01:25:04,104
They'll feel bad if we don't go.

1586
01:25:04,344 --> 01:25:05,064
Who?

1587
01:25:05,224 --> 01:25:05,984
My fans.

1588
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:06,984
Fans?
- Yes.

1589
01:25:07,104 --> 01:25:07,864
Your fans?
- Yes.

1590
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:08,504
Who are they?

1591
01:25:08,664 --> 01:25:09,744
Venu and party.

1592
01:25:10,024 --> 01:25:11,664
You don't know the
kind of following I have.

1593
01:25:11,944 --> 01:25:12,784
Let me show you. Come.

1594
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:17,944
Hail Gabbar Singh!

1595
01:25:18,064 --> 01:25:19,344
Hail Oscar!

1596
01:25:21,944 --> 01:25:22,744
Brother!
- Yes?

1597
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:23,824
You are the president of..

1598
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:25,424
..Kolkata Power
Star Fans Association.

1599
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:27,424
You should display power.
Why are you so scared?

1600
01:25:27,584 --> 01:25:29,704
I'm not scared.
Just a little shivering.

1601
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:30,544
Why?

1602
01:25:30,704 --> 01:25:32,424
Nandini always used to call me for..

1603
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:36,304
..pizzas, burgers and cold drinks.

1604
01:25:36,864 --> 01:25:39,744
Today she called me for
two side by side movie tickets.

1605
01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:41,744
What does that mean?
Does she like me?

1606
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:43,904
Of course she likes you.
Why are you tense?

1607
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,864
If she has asked you to
book two side by side tickets..

1608
01:25:46,024 --> 01:25:47,384
..she has given you
the signal for love.

1609
01:25:47,624 --> 01:25:48,864
Really? Take this ring.

1610
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:50,104
Wow!

1611
01:25:50,384 --> 01:25:52,464
Just like people in Andhra
are crazy for Power Star..

1612
01:25:52,624 --> 01:25:53,344
..people here are crazy for you,
brother.

1613
01:25:53,504 --> 01:25:54,624
Really? Take this.

1614
01:25:54,784 --> 01:25:56,024
You are super, brother.

1615
01:25:56,144 --> 01:25:56,864
Catch this.

1616
01:25:56,984 --> 01:25:57,824
She fell for you, brother.

1617
01:25:58,224 --> 01:25:59,424
You are a Bengal Tiger, brother.
- Really?

1618
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:00,944
You are Siddhu Siddharth Roy,
brother.

1619
01:26:01,104 --> 01:26:02,904
Really? You deserve this chain.

1620
01:26:03,664 --> 01:26:04,704
Brother, you are giving
away all your gold.

1621
01:26:04,824 --> 01:26:05,944
I hope you don't become a pauper.

1622
01:26:06,264 --> 01:26:09,064
When 50 kilos of gold
is going to be mine..

1623
01:26:09,184 --> 01:26:10,584
..why should I bother
about 250 grams of gold?

1624
01:26:10,744 --> 01:26:11,544
You are right.

1625
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:15,744
Hi!
- Hi!

1626
01:26:17,544 --> 01:26:18,984
Brother,
your future wife looks beautiful.

1627
01:26:19,144 --> 01:26:20,464
She does.
But who is the man beside her?

1628
01:26:20,704 --> 01:26:23,504
He is like a Power Star
with Mega Star's features.

1629
01:26:25,464 --> 01:26:26,784
Give me back my ring.
- Why?

1630
01:26:27,024 --> 01:26:28,024
Give it back.
- Take.

1631
01:26:28,144 --> 01:26:29,544
It doesn't matter who he is,
brother.

1632
01:26:29,704 --> 01:26:31,144
He is a VCD, but you are a DVD.

1633
01:26:31,544 --> 01:26:32,464
You take this.
- Thanks.

1634
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,744
Hi, Venu!
- Hi, Nandini! Who is he?

1635
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:35,784
My sister-in-law's brother.

1636
01:26:35,944 --> 01:26:39,624
Brother? I was tense.
I'm Venu, local Power Star.

1637
01:26:39,824 --> 01:26:40,664
Huh?
- Yes.

1638
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:41,624
Listen!
- Yes?

1639
01:26:41,784 --> 01:26:43,064
Take the brother and
buy whatever he wants.

1640
01:26:43,224 --> 01:26:44,864
Give him whatever seat
he wants to see the movie.

1641
01:26:45,156 --> 01:26:46,837
She and I will sit
in the corner seat and..

1642
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:48,637
How can that be possible? No way!

1643
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:49,597
Why?

1644
01:26:49,757 --> 01:26:50,677
He is my sister-in-law's brother.

1645
01:26:50,917 --> 01:26:52,477
I forced him to come to the movie.

1646
01:26:52,717 --> 01:26:53,877
If I don't sit beside him,
not only him..

1647
01:26:54,037 --> 01:26:56,437
..but my brother and sister-in-law
also will feel bad.

1648
01:26:56,637 --> 01:26:57,437
Let's go, Siddhu.

1649
01:26:58,077 --> 01:27:00,157
Why does she need corner
seats to sit with a brother?

1650
01:27:00,357 --> 01:27:02,357
She said he is her
sister-in-law's brother.

1651
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:03,197
What does that mean?

1652
01:27:03,357 --> 01:27:05,917
He can be her boyfriend too.
- What?

1653
01:27:06,197 --> 01:27:07,557
It is like he is riding your horse.

1654
01:27:08,037 --> 01:27:09,877
I won't let him ride it. Let's go.

1655
01:27:25,517 --> 01:27:28,477
Hey, see what the brother is doing?

1656
01:27:32,317 --> 01:27:33,517
Your girl is doing a lot of things.

1657
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:35,437
What is he doing when
she's doing all that?

1658
01:27:35,757 --> 01:27:37,757
Even he'll do something
without being seen.

1659
01:27:38,157 --> 01:27:39,917
If they are behaving
like this in a matinee show..

1660
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:41,677
..they would've done
a lot more in a first show.

1661
01:27:41,837 --> 01:27:42,557
I won't let them do anything.

1662
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:43,717
Shall we finish him then?

1663
01:27:44,557 --> 01:27:46,237
If we do it now,
the fans will get disturbed.

1664
01:27:46,477 --> 01:27:48,237
We'll leisurely finish
him in the interval.

1665
01:27:54,997 --> 01:27:57,237
We need weapons to
save our girl or property.

1666
01:27:57,477 --> 01:28:01,117
So, I brought acid and knife.

1667
01:28:01,757 --> 01:28:02,957
When I stab him with this knife..

1668
01:28:03,197 --> 01:28:04,957
..you pour acid on his face.

1669
01:28:05,277 --> 01:28:06,197
What should we do?

1670
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:07,877
Watch the show without
getting scared.

1671
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:12,597
One Popcorn,
one Coke, medium French Fries.

1672
01:28:13,237 --> 01:28:13,797
Where is he?

1673
01:28:13,957 --> 01:28:14,717
He is there.

1674
01:28:16,437 --> 01:28:17,757
He is like a free customer.

1675
01:28:18,037 --> 01:28:19,157
He is watching a
movie with our tickets.

1676
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:20,437
Now he'll drink the cold
drink that your girl bought.

1677
01:28:20,557 --> 01:28:22,517
He'll die free of cost
when I stab him with this knife.

1678
01:28:22,837 --> 01:28:23,757
Let's do it.

1679
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:25,237
Let the crowd reduce.

1680
01:28:25,397 --> 01:28:26,157
You said there were
fans in the theater.

1681
01:28:26,317 --> 01:28:28,037
Now you say there is public.
Will you stab him or not?

1682
01:28:28,277 --> 01:28:29,757
I will stab you first.

1683
01:28:30,077 --> 01:28:31,837
We need proper planning.

1684
01:28:34,077 --> 01:28:35,677
Sorry, I didn't see you.

1685
01:28:36,037 --> 01:28:37,477
Will my clothes get
dry if you say sorry?

1686
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,397
They will get dry if you apply heat.
Give me a hug.

1687
01:28:40,837 --> 01:28:41,557
Pathetic!

1688
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:43,037
Hey, give me a hug.

1689
01:28:43,197 --> 01:28:44,557
Let me go.
- Hug me.

1690
01:28:45,117 --> 01:28:45,957
Let me go.
- Hug me.

1691
01:28:46,157 --> 01:28:48,717
Why are you making this
into a big issue? Let her go.

1692
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:50,997
How dare you touch Viju?

1693
01:28:51,357 --> 01:28:52,877
How dare you touch me?

1694
01:28:53,757 --> 01:28:56,997
What is that look?
Will you hit? Will you hit me?

1695
01:29:07,357 --> 01:29:08,077
What is it?

1696
01:29:08,237 --> 01:29:09,157
I came to take their bodies.

1697
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:10,317
Take them away.
- Okay.

1698
01:29:11,277 --> 01:29:12,077
Let's go.

1699
01:29:14,924 --> 01:29:16,360
Hey, what is that blood?

1700
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,360
Tomato sauce.

1701
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,320
Tomato sauce?

1702
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,760
Don't ask me questions.
I'm in a shock.

1703
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:20,760
Go and watch the movie.

1704
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,880
Wash it off.

1705
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,480
Bye!

1706
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,040
Don't wave! That's enough.

1707
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,280
Why are you drinking so much?

1708
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,440
Your liver will get damaged.

1709
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,160
If I damage my liver,
I can borrow some money..

1710
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,640
..go to Apollo Hospital
and get myself a new one.

1711
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,240
What should I do
when my lover is gone?

1712
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:43,760
A country has no harm
from terrorism and naxalism.

1713
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,160
Our India is backward
only because of beauty-ism.

1714
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,560
What does beauty-ism mean?

1715
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,960
Girls use their beauty as capital..

1716
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,840
..and make us go around them..

1717
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,440
..just like they
rotate the interest.

1718
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,440
They will smile and convince us.

1719
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,280
For example,
we buy shares of a good company.

1720
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,920
We expect guaranteed growth.

1721
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,880
But it shuts down without warranty.

1722
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,080
Even girls are like that.

1723
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,960
You compared beauty
with money in a good way.

1724
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,000
5 years! Instead of following her..

1725
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,040
..if I had gone
around India on foot..

1726
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,440
..I would've been
in the Guinness Book.

1727
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,320
Just as they throw the
cup after eating the ice-cream..

1728
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,120
..just as they remove
a small hero's movie..

1729
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,040
..when a star hero's
movie releases..

1730
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,760
..she this innocent
man for a handsome man.

1731
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,120
Please don't trust beautiful girls.

1732
01:30:28,444 --> 01:30:30,640
I feel the same.
Let's go and confront her.

1733
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,360
If we go to her, she'll
say she is getting married to him.

1734
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,720
We'll have to pay for the
gifts and bouquets. Forget it.

1735
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:38,600
Okay, brother.

1736
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,480
She married him
long ago in her heart.

1737
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,200
I've designed the marriage
invitation in my heart long back

1738
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:16,120
I've sent it to you in my dreams

1739
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,000
I'll offer my love
the black spot on my cheek

1740
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,760
I'll welcome you at first
night with sublime scents

1741
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,800
I've received the marriage
invitation.. is it true or a dream

1742
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:31,560
I replied to my beloved
with my first kiss long back

1743
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:36,120
I'll get a lovely garland
of fresh blooms for you

1744
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,320
I'll entertain you in the
beautiful evenings of the season

1745
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:43,480
I've designed the marriage
invitation in my heart long back

1746
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,520
I replied to my beloved
with my first kiss long back

1747
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,120
The new season of love has begun

1748
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,120
The birds sing tunes of love

1749
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,800
The breeze has an
air of intoxication

1750
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,560
The jasmines are ready
to adorn your lovely hair

1751
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:41,320
Your gaze pierces into my heart

1752
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:45,400
I desire to embrace
your beauty with all my heart

1753
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:49,160
That is how this
story will go to climax

1754
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:53,080
I've received the marriage
invitation.. is it true or a dream

1755
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:57,080
I've designed the marriage
invitation in my heart long back

1756
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,640
My love for stayed
unexpressed for long

1757
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:47,640
I wrote this letter of
love for you with words unspoken

1758
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,360
I yearned for your
love for a long time

1759
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:55,160
I waited for you just
as a garden waits for the blooms

1760
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:59,080
You sly looks carry lots of news

1761
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:03,040
There are many desires
waiting to be fulfilled

1762
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,800
That is how this
story will go to climax

1763
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,680
I've designed the marriage
invitation in my heart long back

1764
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,280
I've sent it to you in my dreams

1765
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,480
I'll get a lovely garland
of fresh blooms for you

1766
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:22,120
I'll entertain you in the
beautiful evenings of the season

1767
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:26,240
I've designed the marriage
invitation in my heart long back

1768
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,240
I've received the marriage
invitation.. is it true or a dream

1769
01:35:06,633 --> 01:35:08,236
Doctor, how is my daughter?

1770
01:35:08,396 --> 01:35:09,116
How is she?

1771
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,076
Are you really her parents?

1772
01:35:10,196 --> 01:35:10,876
Sir..

1773
01:35:11,036 --> 01:35:12,956
You gave steroids
to a ten year old girl..

1774
01:35:13,076 --> 01:35:14,556
..to make her look
like an eighteen year old..

1775
01:35:14,716 --> 01:35:16,036
..so that you can make
her a prostitute to earn money.

1776
01:35:16,276 --> 01:35:17,196
We didn't do it, sir.
Rawat's brothers..

1777
01:35:17,516 --> 01:35:19,716
..Badvel and Taxi Seth did that.

1778
01:35:20,516 --> 01:35:22,756
Because of poverty we
put our children on jobs.

1779
01:35:23,076 --> 01:35:24,836
But they give steroids
to those small girls..

1780
01:35:24,956 --> 01:35:27,596
..turn them into women
and sell them for prostitution.

1781
01:35:28,109 --> 01:35:32,396
They are separating small
kids from their parents.

1782
01:35:32,636 --> 01:35:35,676
Half of the taxis in
Kolkata belong to Taxi Seth.

1783
01:35:36,076 --> 01:35:38,076
They kidnap small girls
like my daughter who get into..

1784
01:35:38,236 --> 01:35:41,156
..his taxis, promise them jobs,
turn them into prostitutes..

1785
01:35:41,316 --> 01:35:44,476
..and later sell them
off to men in other countries.

1786
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,756
Why didn't you complain
to the police about this?

1787
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:52,796
Nobody has the courage
to confront them, sir.

1788
01:35:53,196 --> 01:35:55,276
You might not have the courage,
I have it.

1789
01:35:55,556 --> 01:35:56,836
What?
- Yes.

1790
01:35:57,596 --> 01:35:59,436
A girl gave this statement
against Badvel before dying.

1791
01:36:00,036 --> 01:36:01,876
These are her blood
samples and DNA reports.

1792
01:36:01,996 --> 01:36:03,796
Finally I saw a man that
has the courage to confront him.

1793
01:36:04,276 --> 01:36:05,756
These proofs are
enough to arrest him.

1794
01:36:10,036 --> 01:36:10,756
Yes, Siddhu.

1795
01:36:10,916 --> 01:36:12,636
Why didn't you come for
lunch on your anniversary?

1796
01:36:12,756 --> 01:36:14,236
Sister is waiting for you.
Where are you?

1797
01:36:14,396 --> 01:36:15,556
I came to Old Binni Mills.

1798
01:36:15,716 --> 01:36:17,316
What? What work do you have there?

1799
01:36:17,596 --> 01:36:19,156
I came here for an important work.

1800
01:36:19,476 --> 01:36:21,836
Ask your sister to eat food.
I'll come later.

1801
01:36:22,356 --> 01:36:23,316
Okay, come soon.

1802
01:36:27,316 --> 01:36:28,036
Where to?

1803
01:36:28,156 --> 01:36:28,956
We need to see Badvel.

1804
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:30,076
Take off your uniform
and come inside.

1805
01:36:40,501 --> 01:36:42,060
Why did you come
in your police uniform?

1806
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,940
Did you come to arrest me?

1807
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,180
Someone has complained against you..

1808
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,180
..for the first time
in Kolkata with strong proofs.

1809
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,940
He came to me without
knowing that I'm your man.

1810
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:57,620
If he had gone to someone else..

1811
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:01,820
You should think about
the diseases, doctor.

1812
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:03,740
Why do you bother
about other people?

1813
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:09,060
Did you really think you
can go against me in Kolkata?

1814
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,420
He may have sold himself to you.

1815
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:14,100
If the police can't do anything,
I'll give these proofs..

1816
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,860
..to the media and get
you hanged in the public.

1817
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,140
Yes?

1818
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,740
Badvel! Badvel!

1819
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:38,020
Nobody should question
me even if I sell or kill people.

1820
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:43,060
You might kill me today,
but one day you'll die like a dog.

1821
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,940
Brother!

1822
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,980
Kolkata belongs
to me and my brother.

1823
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,660
Brother!

1824
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:06,100
Brother!

1825
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,540
Are you the doctor's brother-in-law?

1826
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:09,380
Yes.

1827
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,340
Your brother-in-law
complained against our boss.

1828
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:12,900
Boss got angry and
killed him just now.

1829
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:16,580
His body is lying there.
Take it away and burn it.

1830
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,220
Brother!

1831
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,620
Brother!

1832
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:26,060
Open your eyes.

1833
01:38:40,242 --> 01:38:42,437
Take the body with you and leave.

1834
01:38:42,877 --> 01:38:45,757
If you talk about police
and post mortem, he'll kill you too.

1835
01:38:47,757 --> 01:38:48,717
He will kill your sister as well.

1836
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:53,037
If they have any kids,
he will kill them as well.

1837
01:39:04,677 --> 01:39:06,437
Who among you is Badvel?

1838
01:39:08,037 --> 01:39:09,837
Who is Badvel here?

1839
01:39:17,517 --> 01:39:18,557
Who is Badvel?

1840
01:39:18,797 --> 01:39:19,557
Me.

1841
01:39:20,277 --> 01:39:22,157
What? Will you kill me?

1842
01:39:22,437 --> 01:39:27,317
I won't be called
Siddharth Naayak anymore..

1843
01:39:27,477 --> 01:39:31,237
..if I don't kill you today
on the busiest roads of Kolkata.

1844
01:39:33,037 --> 01:39:33,877
Come!

1845
01:41:05,717 --> 01:41:07,917
No, don't kill me.
Please, I beg of you.

1846
01:41:08,077 --> 01:41:10,197
So many people must
have begged you like this.

1847
01:41:11,077 --> 01:41:12,317
Did you spare them? Yes?

1848
01:41:14,877 --> 01:41:15,797
Kill the rascal!

1849
01:41:15,957 --> 01:41:16,557
Kill him!

1850
01:41:16,957 --> 01:41:19,077
What did my brother-in-law do?

1851
01:41:19,717 --> 01:41:21,357
Will you kill him because
he complained against you?

1852
01:41:52,157 --> 01:41:56,597
'Somebody should confront
him one day or the other.'

1853
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,157
The man who killed
Badvel shouldn't be alive.

1854
01:42:02,437 --> 01:42:04,117
I should kill him with my hands.

1855
01:42:04,237 --> 01:42:05,077
Where is he?

1856
01:42:05,237 --> 01:42:06,197
I'll stay right here.

1857
01:42:08,077 --> 01:42:09,317
Your husband was right.
He is not alive today..

1858
01:42:09,477 --> 01:42:10,517
..because there is
nobody to confront them.

1859
01:42:10,997 --> 01:42:11,877
Nobody else should die.

1860
01:42:12,277 --> 01:42:14,197
Kolkata should be
rid of Rawat and his men.

1861
01:42:14,357 --> 01:42:15,317
What are you saying?

1862
01:42:15,957 --> 01:42:17,517
He died because he
went and confronted them.

1863
01:42:17,837 --> 01:42:19,157
How can we life if
you lose your life as well?

1864
01:42:19,397 --> 01:42:20,477
We shouldn't run with fear.

1865
01:42:21,037 --> 01:42:22,117
They should run away with fear.

1866
01:42:22,397 --> 01:42:23,317
They will run away.

1867
01:42:23,477 --> 01:42:25,317
I bind you by oath that
you should come with us.

1868
01:42:25,437 --> 01:42:26,637
Sister, listen to me.

1869
01:42:27,037 --> 01:42:28,237
You don't have a brother-in-law now.

1870
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:31,117
If you don't listen to me,
you won't have a sister too.

1871
01:42:31,557 --> 01:42:32,677
Sister..
- Let's go.

1872
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:53,077
Son, I heard that you killed Badvel.

1873
01:42:53,397 --> 01:42:55,077
I came because I wanted to see you.

1874
01:42:55,997 --> 01:42:58,557
He killed my four sons
and left me childless.

1875
01:42:58,877 --> 01:43:05,837
I don't know whose son you are.
You should live long.

1876
01:43:07,077 --> 01:43:09,677
Will you stay here? Won't you?

1877
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:11,317
Let's go.

1878
01:43:13,837 --> 01:43:14,677
Come on.

1879
01:43:14,797 --> 01:43:17,117
Wait, son! All of us
are very happy that at last..

1880
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:21,197
..there is a man to confront them.
Please don't leave.

1881
01:43:21,277 --> 01:43:22,438
We don't need any of this.

1882
01:43:22,518 --> 01:43:23,397
Let's go.

1883
01:43:23,517 --> 01:43:25,597
Brother, please don't leave.
You are our courage.

1884
01:43:25,837 --> 01:43:28,157
You should be here as our support,
as our leader.

1885
01:43:28,397 --> 01:43:29,197
We will stand behind you.

1886
01:43:47,281 --> 01:43:52,042
You think you can sneak
away after killing my brother?

1887
01:43:54,162 --> 01:43:57,362
Do you know why you are still here?

1888
01:43:57,802 --> 01:44:02,522
Because I wanted to
kill you with my hands.

1889
01:44:02,802 --> 01:44:05,522
Because I wanted to
kill you with my hands.

1890
01:44:07,762 --> 01:44:10,682
Are you happy that
he stood against me?

1891
01:44:10,962 --> 01:44:14,602
I will kill him right
before you. Watch!

1892
01:44:20,202 --> 01:44:22,082
Take sister and go away.

1893
01:44:22,442 --> 01:44:24,642
We'll be fine. Please go.

1894
01:44:31,082 --> 01:44:35,762
People are ready to die for you.

1895
01:44:36,242 --> 01:44:37,282
Does that mean you are a leader now?

1896
01:44:40,322 --> 01:44:42,442
Why don't you speak?
Are you a leader?

1897
01:44:42,962 --> 01:44:44,962
Yes, my brother is a leader.

1898
01:44:50,602 --> 01:44:53,442
Siddhu, I wanted you to be with us.

1899
01:44:53,962 --> 01:44:57,642
But you should be with these people.

1900
01:44:58,362 --> 01:45:00,482
The people around are afraid of him.

1901
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:04,402
But he should be afraid of you.

1902
01:45:04,682 --> 01:45:06,362
He should be afraid
to hear your name.

1903
01:45:07,482 --> 01:45:09,242
Take her away.

1904
01:46:47,282 --> 01:46:50,882
I can kill you in one second.

1905
01:46:51,682 --> 01:46:54,242
Your eyes should see
your empire falling down.

1906
01:46:54,722 --> 01:46:56,802
Your ears should
hear about your defeat.

1907
01:46:57,402 --> 01:46:59,282
Looking at the torture
you've to endure..

1908
01:46:59,442 --> 01:47:02,602
..no goon will dare
to walk in Kolkata.

1909
01:47:03,362 --> 01:47:09,362
You will need my permission
to live or to die.

1910
01:47:10,042 --> 01:47:12,882
Naayak! Siddharth Naayak!

1911
01:47:15,722 --> 01:47:16,602
Can we do nothing?

1912
01:47:16,962 --> 01:47:19,042
Should I taste defeat
in the hands of a man that..

1913
01:47:19,202 --> 01:47:20,762
..is not even as
old as my experience?

1914
01:47:21,242 --> 01:47:26,202
I need to kill him!
I need to kill him with these hands!

1915
01:47:26,402 --> 01:47:28,842
Boss, he went to the
factory with a big crowd.

1916
01:48:04,202 --> 01:48:06,522
Study well.
I'm here if you need anything.

1917
01:48:06,802 --> 01:48:07,722
Okay, brother.

1918
01:48:13,002 --> 01:48:15,602
He became an instant
leader like instant coffee.

1919
01:48:16,002 --> 01:48:20,082
Brother, we need to chop
him into pieces. Do something.

1920
01:48:20,322 --> 01:48:23,362
Don't go near him, boss.
If you touch him..

1921
01:48:23,522 --> 01:48:25,842
..east, west, north, south,
the whole state will be shaken.

1922
01:48:26,962 --> 01:48:28,282
His fan following
is increasing by the day.

1923
01:48:28,442 --> 01:48:29,722
They shower flowers
on him when he walks.

1924
01:48:29,842 --> 01:48:30,922
They sing praises
to him all the time.

1925
01:48:31,162 --> 01:48:32,882
All the current MLAs,
MPs, IAS and IPS officers..

1926
01:48:33,042 --> 01:48:34,522
..everyone is on his side.

1927
01:48:34,682 --> 01:48:37,282
Even the minister who
won with your support met him.

1928
01:48:45,442 --> 01:48:47,482
You can only hear Naayak's
name everywhere in Kolkata.

1929
01:48:48,402 --> 01:48:50,002
He saved the girls that
Rawat and his brother..

1930
01:48:50,122 --> 01:48:51,282
..were exporting to
the foreign countries..

1931
01:48:51,402 --> 01:48:52,522
..and became a God to them.

1932
01:48:54,122 --> 01:48:56,082
He also brought back
all the young women..

1933
01:48:56,242 --> 01:48:58,882
..suffering abroad away
from their parents back to India.

1934
01:49:06,362 --> 01:49:08,322
I never thought I'll
see you again, dad.

1935
01:49:08,602 --> 01:49:10,762
We don't know whom
he spoke to or what he did.

1936
01:49:11,202 --> 01:49:12,642
But he gave us our children back.

1937
01:49:13,002 --> 01:49:14,402
All these years we've
seen people taking up weapons..

1938
01:49:14,562 --> 01:49:15,842
..to do injustice
or to make others do it.

1939
01:49:16,122 --> 01:49:17,362
For the first time,
we are seeing a leader..

1940
01:49:17,482 --> 01:49:18,282
..that took up weapons.

1941
01:49:18,442 --> 01:49:19,922
I want to see him once, mom.

1942
01:49:55,412 --> 01:49:58,091
It would've been better
if he has killed us both together.

1943
01:49:58,251 --> 01:49:59,931
Why should we live
this stupid life..

1944
01:50:00,091 --> 01:50:03,051
..thinking about him
and fearing him every moment?

1945
01:50:03,651 --> 01:50:06,611
Let's go away from here.
Let's leave this city.

1946
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:08,971
He will leave, not us.

1947
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:12,731
Not just the city, the whole earth.

1948
01:50:13,611 --> 01:50:15,291
Call all the rowdies,
goons, partners, supporters..

1949
01:50:15,451 --> 01:50:17,051
..and every criminal
that cheated people..

1950
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:20,371
..using Rawat's
name all these years.

1951
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:22,811
Tell them that Naayak
wants to meet them.

1952
01:50:26,571 --> 01:50:27,171
Hello, boss!

1953
01:50:28,051 --> 01:50:32,331
Why are all the rowdies
and goons of the city here?

1954
01:50:32,451 --> 01:50:34,691
Boss, you wagged your tail
behind Rawat till yesterday.

1955
01:50:34,931 --> 01:50:35,851
Why did you suddenly
come to meet Naayak?

1956
01:50:35,971 --> 01:50:37,171
What if Rawat finds out?

1957
01:50:37,611 --> 01:50:38,651
We will be in form
only when we follow..

1958
01:50:38,811 --> 01:50:41,571
..a hero that has following
and a leader that's in form.

1959
01:50:41,731 --> 01:50:42,611
Silly man! Follow me.

1960
01:50:43,211 --> 01:50:44,491
Why are you guys waiting here?

1961
01:50:44,651 --> 01:50:45,811
They asked us to wait here.

1962
01:50:46,091 --> 01:50:48,771
We should go in only
when our name is called.

1963
01:50:49,011 --> 01:50:50,891
Oh, he'll call us
individually and discuss..

1964
01:50:51,051 --> 01:50:53,891
..the percentage without
anybody else's knowledge.

1965
01:50:54,171 --> 01:50:55,971
I'm scared that he'll
beat us up inside.

1966
01:50:56,091 --> 01:50:57,491
Not just you, even boss is scared.

1967
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,411
Shut up!

1968
01:50:59,531 --> 01:51:01,131
Just as we cover
the body with a shirt..

1969
01:51:01,291 --> 01:51:02,411
..let us cover our fear with words.

1970
01:51:02,691 --> 01:51:03,651
Okay.

1971
01:51:04,171 --> 01:51:04,931
Hello, Naayak sir.

1972
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:05,611
Hello, sir.

1973
01:51:05,731 --> 01:51:06,491
You asked me to be here in an hour.

1974
01:51:06,651 --> 01:51:07,411
But I came in half an hour.

1975
01:51:07,531 --> 01:51:09,371
Shukla, you've come
as soon as I called you.

1976
01:51:09,851 --> 01:51:11,331
What will you have?
Coffee, tea or cold drinks?

1977
01:51:11,491 --> 01:51:12,651
I'll take a photo with you.

1978
01:51:12,931 --> 01:51:13,691
Photo?

1979
01:51:13,811 --> 01:51:15,651
Yes, I'll tell everyone
that Naayak is my friend.

1980
01:51:15,851 --> 01:51:17,171
I'll use the craze
that public has for you.

1981
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:19,651
I committed 100 murders
and 50 rapes till date.

1982
01:51:19,811 --> 01:51:21,291
I illegally occupied
all the lands I wanted.

1983
01:51:21,451 --> 01:51:22,771
I made the whole Kolkata weep.

1984
01:51:23,331 --> 01:51:24,611
But even my neighbor
doesn't know my name.

1985
01:51:24,851 --> 01:51:26,691
Only police know me.
You did a single murder.

1986
01:51:26,811 --> 01:51:28,091
You became state famous and a star.

1987
01:51:28,411 --> 01:51:31,051
Just say yes.
I'll use your name and..

1988
01:51:31,211 --> 01:51:35,171
..collect 10 billion
rupees by this evening.

1989
01:51:35,331 --> 01:51:37,131
Should I do it?
Will you give me permission?

1990
01:51:37,331 --> 01:51:38,291
Are you ready, sir?

1991
01:51:38,691 --> 01:51:40,611
10 billion rupees?
How will you get so much money?

1992
01:51:40,891 --> 01:51:42,011
Even Tata and Birla
can't get that much money.

1993
01:51:42,171 --> 01:51:43,971
How will they get it?
Are they great goons?

1994
01:51:44,131 --> 01:51:45,331
What will be your property worth?

1995
01:51:45,451 --> 01:51:46,451
50 billion rupees.

1996
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:48,771
Do rowdies earn so much money?

1997
01:51:48,931 --> 01:51:51,131
You can count that as just change.

1998
01:51:51,411 --> 01:51:53,691
I'll give you more money than Rawat.

1999
01:51:54,051 --> 01:51:55,651
I'll turn this old
house into a palace.

2000
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:58,011
I'll shake up Ambanis
in just half a day.

2001
01:51:58,131 --> 01:52:00,131
If you say yes,
we'll talk about percentage.

2002
01:52:00,251 --> 01:52:03,651
50-50 for the legal schemes,
projects, and tenders.

2003
01:52:03,771 --> 01:52:06,571
60-40 for all the illegal works.
Is that okay?

2004
01:52:07,531 --> 01:52:10,331
I'm not able to refuse your offer.
Percentage is okay.

2005
01:52:10,571 --> 01:52:11,811
Go inside and sign the documents.

2006
01:52:12,051 --> 01:52:13,491
Agreement for being a rowdy?

2007
01:52:13,891 --> 01:52:15,091
Hats off, Naayak sir.

2008
01:52:15,331 --> 01:52:17,211
Which room should I
go to for the agreement?

2009
01:52:17,811 --> 01:52:19,411
He signed with his left
hand to go to the right.

2010
01:52:19,531 --> 01:52:20,451
Let's go to the right.

2011
01:52:20,971 --> 01:52:23,291
Shukla! Naayak sir's partner.

2012
01:52:25,811 --> 01:52:29,491
Policemen,
lawyers, judge, registrar!

2013
01:52:29,971 --> 01:52:33,131
He is making all the
rowdies his legal partners.

2014
01:52:33,531 --> 01:52:34,531
This man is a quality man.

2015
01:52:34,691 --> 01:52:37,251
He is an educated man, boss.
Not a rascal like us.

2016
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:38,731
Where should I sign?

2017
01:52:38,851 --> 01:52:40,651
Sir, will you have
a look at your properties?

2018
01:52:40,771 --> 01:52:44,331
Okay. That is mine. Mine.
That is mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

2019
01:52:44,571 --> 01:52:46,411
I see them every day.
They are my properties.

2020
01:52:46,651 --> 01:52:48,171
Tell me where to sign.
I'll just sign.

2021
01:52:48,331 --> 01:52:49,011
Sign here.

2022
01:52:49,131 --> 01:52:50,251
Please, come on. Give me the pen.

2023
01:52:50,691 --> 01:52:53,010
Congrats, boss.
You are Naayak's sir partner now.

2024
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:54,850
Shukla's luck is shining on him.

2025
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:56,410
Take a chocolate, sir.

2026
01:52:56,650 --> 01:52:59,130
Why a chocolate as if I
did great service to the country?

2027
01:52:59,290 --> 01:53:01,610
You really did a great work.
- What did I do?

2028
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:03,890
You gave away all your
property to an orphanage.

2029
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:07,730
What are you saying?
I feel as if my nerves are cut.

2030
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:09,970
When did I give away my property?

2031
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:12,810
That's what the document says.
You've signed it.

2032
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:15,650
You don't have any legal
rights on the property now.

2033
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:17,970
With what purpose
did you call me inside?

2034
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,450
With what purpose did
you take my signatures?

2035
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:22,210
How can you take
away all my property..

2036
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:24,130
..and send me out as a pauper?

2037
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:29,610
Hey! I'm Shukla!
How dare you mess with me?

2038
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:31,570
I'll kill a man for each second.

2039
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:33,690
There are 100 goons outside.

2040
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:35,050
They'll come in
as soon as I whistle.

2041
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:41,730
What is it, Shukla?
Why are you shouting?

2042
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:44,930
Am I shouting?
You took away my property..

2043
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:48,090
..of 50 billion and gave
me a chocolate of 50 paisa.

2044
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:53,330
Shouldn't I shout?
Should I sing a song coolly?

2045
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:54,450
Should I sing a song like this?

2046
01:53:54,610 --> 01:53:57,130
You didn't understand
what's going on here.

2047
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:58,890
You'll understand that
when you go to the next room.

2048
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,170
You gave me a
chocolate in this room.

2049
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:01,570
Will you give me
a biscuit in that room?

2050
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,890
He's very emotional.
Take him quickly.

2051
01:54:05,170 --> 01:54:06,770
I came to the next room. What now?

2052
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,570
You have bodies like oxen.

2053
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:12,130
What are you doing
in this room when..

2054
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:13,370
..great injustice is
taking place in that room?

2055
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:15,090
Didn't you lose
your property like me?

2056
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:17,250
You have bodies, I have brain.

2057
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:18,450
Let's fight together.

2058
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,810
We'll lose nothing
but our lives in a fight.

2059
01:54:25,410 --> 01:54:26,850
Why are you staring
at me without speaking?

2060
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:29,130
They don't like men
who lost their property.

2061
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:30,610
They look like men
that will beat us up.

2062
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:31,730
Whistle immediately.

2063
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:33,010
They can't hear you
even if you whistle.

2064
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:33,850
Why?

2065
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:35,610
We have some good
sound arrangements here.

2066
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:54,810
Oh God!

2067
01:54:57,730 --> 01:55:00,730
Even in a dream it
takes a whole night..

2068
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:02,810
..for me to lose so much property.

2069
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:04,730
How did I lose it with
just a small signature?

2070
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:06,970
Yes, boss. I still can't believe it.

2071
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:09,850
My clothes are intact
but the body is not working.

2072
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,050
How could they beat us up so nicely?

2073
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:13,290
Yes, boss. Even trained
police don't beat up like this.

2074
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:14,650
Eat the chocolate, boss.

2075
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,730
Throw it away! Throw it!

2076
01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:21,010
I remember my lost property
when I see it. Oh God!

2077
01:55:21,272 --> 01:55:22,530
Why are you sitting here?

2078
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:23,970
We are sitting here because
they asked us to sit.

2079
01:55:24,277 --> 01:55:26,090
Are they beating up
people inside as we thought?

2080
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:28,130
Why will they beat us up?
What wrong did we do?

2081
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:30,250
What did you speak to
him and how much did you fix?

2082
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:32,210
We don't have to speak anything.

2083
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:35,090
They ask you to sign
as soon as you go inside.

2084
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:37,690
They give a chocolate
as soon as you sign.

2085
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:39,370
That's it. Very simple.

2086
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:41,890
Is it okay if I
increase the percentage?

2087
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:45,850
You can ask whatever
you want for your personality.

2088
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:47,530
But you will have to sign.

2089
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:48,650
I don't have a pen with me.

2090
01:55:48,850 --> 01:55:52,610
Pens, stamps, chocolates,
everything is inside. Go.

2091
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:54,250
Hello, Naayak sir.

2092
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:55,450
Come in, Rajput.

2093
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:59,370
Be it forgery, piracy,
fake passports or court stamps.

2094
01:55:59,746 --> 01:56:02,610
Everything is piracy.
You've earned a lot of money.

2095
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:05,530
If you give a second,
he'll forge your sign too.

2096
01:56:05,690 --> 01:56:08,010
Shut up!
Why will I forge his signature?

2097
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,490
I've earned a lot, Naayak sir.

2098
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,650
That's why I called you up.

2099
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:13,530
Fix the percentage and
give me the chocolate quickly.

2100
01:56:13,690 --> 01:56:15,530
They'll give you inside.
Go and take it.

2101
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:17,170
Okay, Naayak sir.

2102
01:56:17,962 --> 01:56:19,490
Should I meet you again
after taking the chocolate?

2103
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:23,130
No. The whole program
goes according to a process.

2104
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:25,210
He must've got his chocolate by now.

2105
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:28,290
Congrats!
All your property is transferred..

2106
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:29,290
..to Mother Teresa Trust.

2107
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:30,610
What are you saying?

2108
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:31,970
Why will I give them
away to Mother Teresa Trust?

2109
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:32,890
I won't agree to it.

2110
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,530
Boss, the music has started inside.

2111
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:36,370
The poor man has a loose body.

2112
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:37,850
It must've become even looser.

2113
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:42,090
We somehow managed to come here.

2114
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:43,970
Will he be able to walk till here?

2115
01:56:44,290 --> 01:56:45,330
Or will he collapse on the way?

2116
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:46,290
He's here.

2117
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:49,170
Why didn't you tell me
about the cheating inside?

2118
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:51,210
I would've escaped had
you given me a missed call.

2119
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:53,930
Okay, you give missed
calls to the others in queue.

2120
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,130
No need. Let them lose their
properties like we lost ours.

2121
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:57,890
I was silent because
of the same feeling.

2122
01:56:58,090 --> 01:56:58,890
Even you remain silent.

2123
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:00,810
Okay. Give me that chocolate.

2124
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:02,010
I'm coming.

2125
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:06,490
Why are you guys eating
chocolates like small kids?

2126
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:09,250
They are treating us
like small kids inside.

2127
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:12,010
They don't feel that
we are rowdies and goons.

2128
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:14,490
Go inside, sign the papers
and get a chocolate. Go!

2129
01:57:18,921 --> 01:57:22,050
Rajput! He is a strong
man even though he is thin.

2130
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:23,170
He is walking quite well.

2131
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:25,330
They are beating up
according to the body type.

2132
01:57:25,703 --> 01:57:27,730
Then they must've bashed
you up pretty badly.

2133
01:57:28,730 --> 01:57:30,730
You've informed
about the chocolates.

2134
01:57:31,130 --> 01:57:32,570
Why didn't you tell
us about the sound system?

2135
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:34,050
Would you've gone
inside if I had told you?

2136
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:35,890
Welcome, Raja!

2137
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:38,090
You were very excited
while going inside.

2138
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:39,290
Now you all look very tired.

2139
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:40,450
Did they beat you up inside?

2140
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:41,690
Why will they beat us up?

2141
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:43,090
We go to a hospital
for a health checkup.

2142
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:44,170
They make us walk on a treadmill.

2143
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:45,890
Won't you be tired?
This is the same.

2144
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:47,410
They give us a fruit drink there.

2145
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,330
But here they give us a chocolate.

2146
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:49,370
That's it. Go and get it.

2147
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:51,330
Something is fishy.
I'll meet him later.

2148
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:52,290
I'll switch off my cell phone.

2149
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:54,170
Brother, he is escaping.

2150
01:57:54,330 --> 01:57:55,770
Let's run! Oh God!

2151
01:57:56,370 --> 01:57:58,530
Brother, save me.

2152
01:57:58,741 --> 01:57:59,909
Thank God they caught him.

2153
01:58:00,126 --> 01:58:01,330
I was worried that he'll escape.

2154
01:58:01,490 --> 01:58:02,590
Are you happy?
- Yes.

2155
01:58:02,908 --> 01:58:05,107
It's okay if we are ruined.
The neighbor shouldn't thrive.

2156
01:58:05,547 --> 01:58:07,867
That's our Indian psychology.
I love you, Raja.

2157
01:58:09,347 --> 01:58:11,747
Is everybody here
or is there someone left?

2158
01:58:11,907 --> 01:58:12,907
Who else will be there, boss?

2159
01:58:12,987 --> 01:58:14,587
All of them look like
uprooted trees in a storm.

2160
01:58:15,467 --> 01:58:16,947
Brother has called you inside.

2161
01:58:17,187 --> 01:58:19,427
How can we come? Nobody's
legs are in working condition.

2162
01:58:19,667 --> 01:58:21,067
There are many
diabetes patients here.

2163
01:58:21,347 --> 01:58:22,867
If you delay another half an hour,
half of them will die.

2164
01:58:23,027 --> 01:58:24,027
Send us home, we'll leave.

2165
01:58:24,147 --> 01:58:25,627
Will you all come
or should I call brother?

2166
01:58:25,907 --> 01:58:28,747
No. We'll muster up
all our strength and come.

2167
01:58:33,827 --> 01:58:36,507
Oh God! Terrible pain!

2168
01:58:36,947 --> 01:58:38,667
Oh God!

2169
01:58:40,307 --> 01:58:43,067
Anyone that does illegal
businesses, scams..

2170
01:58:43,227 --> 01:58:47,147
..schemes and donations
shouldn't stay in Kolkata now.

2171
01:58:47,467 --> 01:58:48,907
You should leave this
city in half an hour.

2172
01:58:49,067 --> 01:58:50,667
We get six months to
vacate even a rented place.

2173
01:58:50,827 --> 01:58:51,947
How can you ask us to
leave in just half an hour?

2174
01:58:52,187 --> 01:58:53,787
I say everything just once.

2175
01:58:54,307 --> 01:58:55,867
The second time, I kill.

2176
01:58:57,107 --> 01:58:59,027
Our state has weapons to kill him.

2177
01:58:59,707 --> 01:59:01,227
But there are no men to catch him.

2178
01:59:01,507 --> 01:59:03,467
So, I brought these men from Tihar.

2179
01:59:07,147 --> 01:59:09,427
Look, he is not a rowdy or a goon.

2180
01:59:10,267 --> 01:59:11,947
He has a fan community
in every street.

2181
01:59:12,227 --> 01:59:13,067
He has a fan in every house.

2182
01:59:13,467 --> 01:59:15,787
If you mess up,
he'll kill us along with you.

2183
01:59:16,067 --> 01:59:18,547
Why are you scared?
He is a human, is he not?

2184
01:59:18,827 --> 01:59:20,507
If we press the trigger,
he'll be hit with a bullet.

2185
01:59:20,747 --> 01:59:22,627
Yes, but do that carefully.

2186
01:59:22,987 --> 01:59:23,867
Where is he?

2187
01:59:24,027 --> 01:59:26,147
He's in a wedding
reception in his colony.

2188
01:59:39,467 --> 01:59:43,707
I am a beauty from Howrah
and you are a hero from Andhra

2189
01:59:44,147 --> 01:59:48,547
At any hour that you choose,
I'll be ready for you

2190
01:59:48,747 --> 01:59:54,747
You may touch and feel
my beauty as you please

2191
01:59:55,307 --> 01:59:58,067
This is the place for real love

2192
02:00:02,347 --> 02:00:04,947
Nellore is another
name for romance

2193
02:00:09,147 --> 02:00:13,507
I am a beauty from Howrah
and you are a hero from Andhra

2194
02:00:13,787 --> 02:00:18,187
At any hour that you choose,
I'll be ready for you

2195
02:00:18,707 --> 02:00:24,347
You may touch and feel
my beauty as you please

2196
02:00:25,067 --> 02:00:27,787
Singur is the place
for full-blooded action

2197
02:00:31,987 --> 02:00:34,627
We shall put up camp in Guntur

2198
02:00:57,507 --> 02:01:01,747
O lovely damsel,
I am ready for action

2199
02:01:02,027 --> 02:01:06,427
C'mon and I shall
show you what I am made of

2200
02:01:06,667 --> 02:01:11,067
I shall enthrall you
with my magic all night

2201
02:01:11,307 --> 02:01:15,467
I shall serve you my beauty
like tasty food with wine

2202
02:01:15,867 --> 02:01:19,867
I like your power and
style and I became your fan

2203
02:01:20,107 --> 02:01:24,347
I have come to enjoy
your beauty and show my might

2204
02:01:24,587 --> 02:01:30,467
You make all sort of
statements and put me in a fix

2205
02:01:31,147 --> 02:01:33,987
This is the place for real love

2206
02:01:38,347 --> 02:01:40,787
Nellore is another
name for romance

2207
02:02:19,467 --> 02:02:24,027
You are like a juicy
fruit from Nairobi

2208
02:02:24,347 --> 02:02:28,787
I will start the game
like emperors of yore

2209
02:02:28,907 --> 02:02:33,187
O young prince..
your charm puts the shackles on me

2210
02:02:33,347 --> 02:02:37,587
Take the veil off me
and see the cracker that I am

2211
02:02:37,747 --> 02:02:41,907
Your non-stop invitation
is forcing me to follow you

2212
02:02:42,067 --> 02:02:46,507
If you promise to enthrall me,
I'll offer my juicy lips to you

2213
02:02:46,667 --> 02:02:52,867
It is great to have milk
and honey before the act of love

2214
02:02:53,267 --> 02:02:56,147
Singur is the place
for full-blooded action

2215
02:03:00,507 --> 02:03:03,027
We shall put up camp in Guntur

2216
02:03:17,107 --> 02:03:18,187
Who sent you?

2217
02:03:18,427 --> 02:03:19,427
Rawat and DIG.

2218
02:03:20,962 --> 02:03:22,324
Sir, our men were caught.

2219
02:03:22,604 --> 02:03:23,844
They revealed your name and my name.

2220
02:03:23,964 --> 02:03:25,444
He will definitely attack us.

2221
02:03:25,724 --> 02:03:29,164
Okay, inform him that
we are in the minister's house.

2222
02:03:29,644 --> 02:03:31,404
He will come there
alone in his anger.

2223
02:03:32,044 --> 02:03:33,404
One shot, two birds.

2224
02:03:33,724 --> 02:03:34,804
I got it.

2225
02:03:38,804 --> 02:03:40,204
Why are you so tense?

2226
02:03:40,404 --> 02:03:41,284
You have to save me.

2227
02:03:41,724 --> 02:03:47,004
My shadow might leave me,
but Naayak won't.

2228
02:03:47,604 --> 02:03:49,884
I lost my property,
my men, and everything else.

2229
02:03:50,364 --> 02:03:52,444
I just have my life left. Save me.

2230
02:03:55,724 --> 02:03:56,924
Boss, he is here.

2231
02:04:00,284 --> 02:04:02,724
An apple tree doesn't give grapes.

2232
02:04:03,204 --> 02:04:06,924
I made you a minister,
but you went to him.

2233
02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:14,924
Sir!

2234
02:04:21,484 --> 02:04:23,244
Naayak killed the minister!

2235
02:04:23,884 --> 02:04:24,524
What are you talking about?

2236
02:04:49,084 --> 02:04:51,484
People outside say
that you are a great God.

2237
02:04:51,924 --> 02:04:54,924
Great Gods should
be in photos and idols.

2238
02:04:55,244 --> 02:04:56,244
They shouldn't be alive like you.

2239
02:04:58,684 --> 02:05:02,484
I will take back all
the land you gave to the poor.

2240
02:05:02,924 --> 02:05:06,049
I will start all my
businesses that you shut down.

2241
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:09,401
I will hunt down your
followers and kill them.

2242
02:05:09,921 --> 02:05:13,201
I will take the post
of this dead old man..

2243
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:15,681
..and become the minister in a week.

2244
02:05:17,721 --> 02:05:18,561
Hey! - Yes, boss?

2245
02:05:18,721 --> 02:05:19,481
Is he dead?

2246
02:05:21,196 --> 02:05:21,961
He is dead, boss.

2247
02:05:22,041 --> 02:05:23,001
Throw him in the river Ganges.

2248
02:05:23,281 --> 02:05:23,921
Okay, boss.

2249
02:05:24,321 --> 02:05:26,361
Make an entry in
the police records..

2250
02:05:26,521 --> 02:05:27,521
..that he is absconding
after murdering the minister.

2251
02:05:27,681 --> 02:05:28,401
Okay, sir.

2252
02:05:28,561 --> 02:05:30,681
Only we know that he is dead.

2253
02:05:31,721 --> 02:05:34,281
People will wait in
hope that he will return.

2254
02:05:56,561 --> 02:05:58,241
'The Goddess saved me.'

2255
02:05:59,121 --> 02:06:01,961
'lnstead of proving that
I didn't kill the minister..'

2256
02:06:02,121 --> 02:06:04,641
'..it became my goal
to kill these beasts..'

2257
02:06:04,761 --> 02:06:06,521
'..without getting
caught by the law.'

2258
02:06:16,761 --> 02:06:17,601
Mom, let's go.

2259
02:06:18,281 --> 02:06:20,481
Where to?
That's a train bound to Kolkata.

2260
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:21,441
We are going there.

2261
02:06:21,601 --> 02:06:22,481
Why?

2262
02:06:22,961 --> 02:06:23,761
I'll tell you.

2263
02:06:25,841 --> 02:06:29,241
Naayak! Someone came to meet you.
- Who?

2264
02:06:29,361 --> 02:06:30,721
Someone called Cherry.
He looks exactly like you.

2265
02:06:44,161 --> 02:06:45,601
Hi, my name is Cherry.

2266
02:06:46,441 --> 02:06:47,321
Siddharth.

2267
02:06:48,008 --> 02:06:49,961
I read about you
and came to meet you.

2268
02:06:50,332 --> 02:06:51,201
Why?

2269
02:07:07,481 --> 02:07:09,481
One side there is police.

2270
02:07:09,761 --> 02:07:10,921
One side there are
people that he killed.

2271
02:07:11,321 --> 02:07:12,881
One side there are people
that want to kill him.

2272
02:07:13,764 --> 02:07:15,761
How can we software people
handle such hardware men?

2273
02:07:15,881 --> 02:07:16,881
But he won't listen to me.

2274
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:23,441
Hello, Rawat sir.

2275
02:07:23,721 --> 02:07:24,601
Where did you disappear?

2276
02:07:24,881 --> 02:07:27,361
Just recently I became
capable of walking again, sir.

2277
02:07:27,601 --> 02:07:30,321
Don't worry, sir. No harm
will come to a good man like you.

2278
02:07:31,161 --> 02:07:33,041
These days people
die of septic infection..

2279
02:07:33,201 --> 02:07:34,401
..if a small nail pricks them.

2280
02:07:34,641 --> 02:07:38,001
You are alive even after
he stabbed you with a spear.

2281
02:07:38,241 --> 02:07:39,841
So, no harm will come to you.

2282
02:07:40,441 --> 02:07:42,841
He is already a suspect
in the minister's murder case.

2283
02:07:43,201 --> 02:07:44,841
And there are proofs
that he stabbed you.

2284
02:07:45,081 --> 02:07:46,721
He will be given a death sentence.

2285
02:07:46,921 --> 02:07:49,201
But still, I have my doubts.

2286
02:07:49,441 --> 02:07:51,601
For safety,
tell our men to kill him before..

2287
02:07:51,761 --> 02:07:53,121
..he is presented in the court.

2288
02:07:53,401 --> 02:07:54,441
That's not possible, sir.
- Why?

2289
02:07:54,721 --> 02:07:58,361
He'll be surrounded
by thousands tomorrow.

2290
02:07:58,441 --> 02:07:59,321
What?

2291
02:07:59,441 --> 02:08:00,521
100,000 people will
form a human chain..

2292
02:08:00,841 --> 02:08:03,161
..to bring him safely
to the court tomorrow.

2293
02:08:04,401 --> 02:08:10,481
Long live Naayak!

2294
02:08:46,401 --> 02:08:48,441
Long live Naayak!

2295
02:08:48,641 --> 02:08:50,201
Even though he looks like a kid..

2296
02:08:50,361 --> 02:08:51,881
..he has a huge fan following.

2297
02:08:52,081 --> 02:08:54,281
Your fan following depends
on your works, not age.

2298
02:08:54,721 --> 02:08:56,721
Don't worry, boss.
This crowd can't do anything.

2299
02:08:57,001 --> 02:08:59,401
Even millions of people
can't affect the judge's decision.

2300
02:08:59,561 --> 02:09:00,521
He will get a death sentence.

2301
02:09:00,721 --> 02:09:03,481
Why do they say that
you'll get a death sentence?

2302
02:09:03,721 --> 02:09:05,761
You are worried that
I'll get a death sentence.

2303
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:10,041
But I'm worried that
he is still alive.

2304
02:09:10,441 --> 02:09:11,561
No harm will come to you.

2305
02:09:24,881 --> 02:09:27,641
Your Honor! He is a suspect
in Home Minister's murder.

2306
02:09:27,881 --> 02:09:30,161
He killed the DGP
and Taxi Seth in a..

2307
02:09:30,281 --> 02:09:33,361
..premeditative,
willful and revengeful manner.

2308
02:09:33,681 --> 02:09:35,481
We also have strong
proof that he tried to..

2309
02:09:35,601 --> 02:09:38,401
..murder the current Home Minister,
Mr. Rawat.

2310
02:09:38,881 --> 02:09:41,001
I request the court to
give him a death sentence..

2311
02:09:41,161 --> 02:09:43,561
..so that nobody dares
to become a criminal like him.

2312
02:09:43,641 --> 02:09:46,201
Do you accept that
you did these crimes?

2313
02:09:46,521 --> 02:09:48,001
Why do you ask him
whether he accepts or not?

2314
02:09:48,561 --> 02:09:49,841
You have strong
evidences against him.

2315
02:09:50,081 --> 02:09:51,241
Without wasting the court's time..

2316
02:09:51,361 --> 02:09:52,361
..give him a death sentence.

2317
02:09:52,441 --> 02:09:54,788
Wait! The court has some rules.

2318
02:09:55,219 --> 02:09:56,463
Do you accept these crimes?

2319
02:09:56,623 --> 02:09:58,343
Yes, sir. I did all those crimes.

2320
02:09:58,783 --> 02:10:02,543
Since he accepts his crimes,
under IPC sections 302..

2321
02:10:02,703 --> 02:10:04,623
..and 307,
the accused is sentenced to death..

2322
02:10:04,903 --> 02:10:05,743
Wait, Your Honor!

2323
02:10:14,703 --> 02:10:16,463
Who is this, boss?
He looks exactly like Naayak.

2324
02:10:16,623 --> 02:10:18,903
Is he the real Naayak?
I've gone mad.

2325
02:10:19,303 --> 02:10:21,543
It is like I'm watching
a 3D movie without the glasses.

2326
02:10:22,143 --> 02:10:24,303
We told him to go home.
Why did he come here?

2327
02:10:32,423 --> 02:10:33,023
Hello, sir!

2328
02:10:33,583 --> 02:10:35,423
Who are you?
You look exactly like him.

2329
02:10:35,943 --> 02:10:38,503
My name is Siddharth Naayak.
I did those murders.

2330
02:10:38,743 --> 02:10:40,423
No, Your Honor!
I'm Siddharth Naayak.

2331
02:10:40,783 --> 02:10:42,143
I think he is one of my fans.

2332
02:10:42,343 --> 02:10:43,303
He dressed up like
me and came here..

2333
02:10:43,463 --> 02:10:45,023
..to take my crimes onto his head.

2334
02:10:45,263 --> 02:10:47,063
No, Judge! He is one of my fans.

2335
02:10:47,303 --> 02:10:48,863
He dressed up like
me and came here..

2336
02:10:48,983 --> 02:10:50,343
..to take my crimes onto his head.

2337
02:10:50,783 --> 02:10:53,223
Don't ruin your life to save me.

2338
02:10:53,543 --> 02:10:55,703
I'm telling you the same thing.
Don't ruin your..

2339
02:10:55,863 --> 02:10:57,583
Stop it! What is this rubbish?

2340
02:10:57,863 --> 02:10:59,263
If you are Naayak, who is he?

2341
02:10:59,343 --> 02:11:00,303
My fan.

2342
02:11:00,383 --> 02:11:02,343
If you are his fan, who are you?

2343
02:11:02,503 --> 02:11:03,663
Siddharth Naayak.

2344
02:11:03,903 --> 02:11:05,343
No, I'm Siddharth Naayak.

2345
02:11:05,503 --> 02:11:07,143
No, it's me.
- No, it's me.

2346
02:11:07,303 --> 02:11:08,063
I'm Siddharth Naayak.

2347
02:11:08,223 --> 02:11:08,983
I'm Siddharth Naayak.

2348
02:11:09,103 --> 02:11:11,903
Judge, I know who stabbed me.

2349
02:11:12,343 --> 02:11:14,223
This man stabbed me. He is Naayak.

2350
02:11:14,599 --> 02:11:15,543
Hang him to death.

2351
02:11:15,743 --> 02:11:17,823
No, Your Honor!
He is a little confused.

2352
02:11:17,983 --> 02:11:19,383
If you send him out for 5 minutes..

2353
02:11:19,543 --> 02:11:20,903
..I will talk to you in private.

2354
02:11:21,543 --> 02:11:22,903
Court is adjourned for 5 minutes.

2355
02:11:23,783 --> 02:11:26,223
Darn! Did anyone imagine this?

2356
02:11:26,463 --> 02:11:28,103
It's like a winning
cricket match was stopped..

2357
02:11:28,223 --> 02:11:30,263
..because of sudden rains.
What is this nonsense?

2358
02:11:30,423 --> 02:11:31,863
Who is that second man?

2359
02:11:32,343 --> 02:11:33,983
He is a software
engineer from Hyderabad.

2360
02:11:34,223 --> 02:11:36,143
Even we got confused
and arrested him first.

2361
02:11:36,343 --> 02:11:38,183
What? Did you see
the second man earlier?

2362
02:11:38,383 --> 02:11:39,863
Yes. We arrested him
and later released him..

2363
02:11:40,023 --> 02:11:40,943
..because he is innocent.

2364
02:11:41,103 --> 02:11:43,423
Darn! Who made you a CBI agent?

2365
02:11:43,503 --> 02:11:44,463
Take it easy, sir.

2366
02:11:44,543 --> 02:11:46,903
Sir, it's a very long gap.

2367
02:11:47,143 --> 02:11:50,743
I think they must've definitely
changed places. Be careful.

2368
02:11:53,783 --> 02:11:56,423
Now tell me.
Which of these men stabbed you?

2369
02:11:59,881 --> 02:12:01,813
They must've definitely
changed places.

2370
02:12:02,610 --> 02:12:03,583
This man, sir.

2371
02:12:03,743 --> 02:12:04,583
But earlier you said
that man stabbed you.

2372
02:12:04,703 --> 02:12:05,983
Didn't they change their places?

2373
02:12:06,263 --> 02:12:07,423
No, they didn't.

2374
02:12:08,827 --> 02:12:09,863
Stupid fellow!

2375
02:12:10,165 --> 02:12:11,783
Hang both of them
and finish the matter.

2376
02:12:12,063 --> 02:12:13,303
Hang both of them, Judge.

2377
02:12:13,463 --> 02:12:14,341
Sir!
- Don't leave them.

2378
02:12:14,421 --> 02:12:15,343
Hang both of them.

2379
02:12:15,503 --> 02:12:17,983
Silence! You are a man
with a responsible post.

2380
02:12:18,143 --> 02:12:19,423
You shouldn't be talking like this.

2381
02:12:19,783 --> 02:12:21,943
It's okay if hundred
criminals escape.

2382
02:12:22,183 --> 02:12:23,823
But it's not okay to
punish an innocent man.

2383
02:12:24,421 --> 02:12:27,313
Now this case will never be solved.

2384
02:12:27,785 --> 02:12:29,299
Since both of them
look exactly the same..

2385
02:12:29,459 --> 02:12:30,819
..we are not able to
identify the real murderer.

2386
02:12:31,099 --> 02:12:33,139
The CBI is ordered
to keep both of them..

2387
02:12:33,299 --> 02:12:34,619
..under house arrest with
their friends and family members..

2388
02:12:34,779 --> 02:12:39,939
..identify the real murderer
and bring him to the court.

2389
02:12:40,179 --> 02:12:41,499
I'm giving them 10 days time.

2390
02:12:51,739 --> 02:12:52,619
Follow them both.

2391
02:12:52,859 --> 02:12:54,379
Sir, it's useless to follow them.

2392
02:12:54,659 --> 02:12:56,339
If a brave man meets
an intelligent man..

2393
02:12:56,499 --> 02:12:58,139
..CBI or CID can't do anything.

2394
02:12:58,339 --> 02:13:01,339
Stop praising them
and do your job. Go.

2395
02:13:01,579 --> 02:13:02,379
I'm going.

2396
02:13:02,459 --> 02:13:07,139
I don't what to say or
how to say it to your son.

2397
02:13:07,499 --> 02:13:10,419
We are humans, dear.
We should help each other.

2398
02:13:11,219 --> 02:13:12,299
Thank God!

2399
02:13:14,779 --> 02:13:15,539
Hey!

2400
02:13:18,939 --> 02:13:21,739
Do you think you are safe?

2401
02:13:22,299 --> 02:13:23,859
After 10 days,
the judge, these people..

2402
02:13:24,179 --> 02:13:26,339
..and I will come to court.

2403
02:13:27,059 --> 02:13:28,299
But you won't come.

2404
02:13:29,899 --> 02:13:30,899
You'll be dead.

2405
02:13:39,099 --> 02:13:40,899
Since he gave a warning to Rawat,
he is Naayak.

2406
02:13:41,059 --> 02:13:42,299
No, it's me.

2407
02:13:42,659 --> 02:13:44,259
If you are Naayak,
why did he give the warning?

2408
02:13:44,419 --> 02:13:45,419
I sent him because he was free.

2409
02:13:46,699 --> 02:13:48,419
So, is that man your nephew?

2410
02:13:48,819 --> 02:13:50,579
When CBI agents like
you can't identify him..

2411
02:13:50,739 --> 02:13:52,259
..how can a mere CEO
like me identify him?

2412
02:13:52,579 --> 02:13:55,419
This case will never
be solved amidst such people.

2413
02:13:57,539 --> 02:13:58,979
Sir, saline.

2414
02:14:01,979 --> 02:14:03,539
Boss, don't increase
your blood pressure.

2415
02:14:03,819 --> 02:14:07,699
You can fight with anyone in life,
but not with a lucky man.

2416
02:14:08,139 --> 02:14:09,739
We killed one man and
threw him in the river..

2417
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:10,899
..but he came out as two men.

2418
02:14:11,379 --> 02:14:14,019
Boss, listen to me.
Go to the police station and..

2419
02:14:14,179 --> 02:14:16,179
..tell them that you've
nothing to do with Naayak..

2420
02:14:16,339 --> 02:14:18,979
..you are not Rawat and
you don't live in Kolkata..

2421
02:14:19,139 --> 02:14:21,859
..you are not from India
but from far away Scotland.

2422
02:14:22,299 --> 02:14:27,099
It's better to withdraw
the case and escape from here.

2423
02:14:27,339 --> 02:14:29,419
How can that be possible?
We filed a case against him.

2424
02:14:29,619 --> 02:14:31,859
We should make Naayak
confess that he is Naayak.

2425
02:14:32,019 --> 02:14:32,939
I will make him confess.

2426
02:14:33,459 --> 02:14:38,099
Bring one family member
of Cherry from Hyderabad.

2427
02:14:38,659 --> 02:14:40,659
Naayak will confess the
truth for that person's safety.

2428
02:14:46,259 --> 02:14:47,739
Who are you guys?

2429
02:14:48,019 --> 02:14:49,259
Does your daughter
love a man called Cherry?

2430
02:14:49,419 --> 02:14:50,939
Yes. So what?

2431
02:14:51,099 --> 02:14:53,619
Rawat asked us bring
your family to Kolkata.

2432
02:14:53,819 --> 02:14:55,939
Did her love story reach Kolkata?

2433
02:14:56,059 --> 02:14:57,419
Who is this Rawat?

2434
02:14:58,059 --> 02:14:59,339
Don't ask me details.
Just get into the vehicles.

2435
02:14:59,579 --> 02:15:01,739
How dare you threaten our boss?

2436
02:15:02,179 --> 02:15:04,299
Even we are goons,
we did many settlements.

2437
02:15:05,059 --> 02:15:05,579
Stop it!

2438
02:15:05,739 --> 02:15:07,179
Why are you arguing with them?

2439
02:15:07,299 --> 02:15:09,339
Can't you see the
guns in their hands?

2440
02:15:14,219 --> 02:15:15,339
Boss, Naayak's men are here.

2441
02:15:22,859 --> 02:15:23,739
Where are Rawat's men?

2442
02:15:24,019 --> 02:15:24,819
They ran away.

2443
02:15:24,979 --> 02:15:26,819
Please come with us.
It's not safe to be here.

2444
02:15:27,219 --> 02:15:29,099
Come with you? Who are you guys now?

2445
02:15:29,259 --> 02:15:30,099
We are Naayak sir's men.

2446
02:15:30,259 --> 02:15:31,059
Who is he?

2447
02:15:31,259 --> 02:15:32,379
You'll know when
you come to Kolkata.

2448
02:15:32,539 --> 02:15:34,099
Ask your daughter to come quickly.

2449
02:15:34,259 --> 02:15:35,179
Why should she come?

2450
02:15:35,339 --> 02:15:36,459
Even Cherry is with us.

2451
02:15:36,779 --> 02:15:38,299
So he is there now, is it?

2452
02:15:38,739 --> 02:15:39,539
Dear!
- Yes, uncle?

2453
02:15:39,699 --> 02:15:41,059
We have to go to Kolkata. Come down.

2454
02:15:41,219 --> 02:15:42,739
I'm coming. I'm applying lipstick.

2455
02:15:42,899 --> 02:15:44,019
By applying such silly
things you've turned..

2456
02:15:44,179 --> 02:15:46,579
..this peaceful house
into a public park.

2457
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:54,536
Where is Cherry, brother?

2458
02:15:56,536 --> 02:15:58,136
Where is Cherry?
- He will be here.

2459
02:15:58,336 --> 02:16:00,016
Welcome! Welcome to Kolkata.

2460
02:16:00,176 --> 02:16:01,856
We are forced to go
around different houses..

2461
02:16:01,976 --> 02:16:03,496
..since the time you
stepped into our house.

2462
02:16:03,656 --> 02:16:04,816
Now why did you call us to Kolkata?

2463
02:16:04,976 --> 02:16:07,576
Don't worry. Naayak sir
thought you'll be safe here.

2464
02:16:07,736 --> 02:16:10,856
Naayak? Why are you
guys thinking of our safety?

2465
02:16:10,976 --> 02:16:13,496
Don't be upset. You'll
be shocked to see the real twist.

2466
02:16:13,736 --> 02:16:15,416
We've had to leave our state
because of the current twist.

2467
02:16:15,656 --> 02:16:17,376
Will you make us
leave the country too?

2468
02:16:19,056 --> 02:16:19,856
Cherry!

2469
02:16:22,856 --> 02:16:25,256
How can she hug him right before us?
Disgusting!

2470
02:16:25,416 --> 02:16:26,936
We are unfortunate, uncle.

2471
02:16:27,056 --> 02:16:29,016
Excuse me, I'm not Cherry.

2472
02:16:30,616 --> 02:16:31,296
What?

2473
02:16:31,576 --> 02:16:32,856
I'm not Cherry.

2474
02:16:33,696 --> 02:16:35,616
Why does he say he's not Cherry?

2475
02:16:35,856 --> 02:16:37,296
He said there's a twist, didn't he?

2476
02:16:37,456 --> 02:16:39,096
How was your journey?

2477
02:16:39,256 --> 02:16:41,016
It was without our consent.

2478
02:16:41,176 --> 02:16:42,976
I heard you are like family
to Cherry. What is your name?

2479
02:16:43,176 --> 02:16:45,936
I'm Amitabh Bachchan.
He is Abhishek Bachchan.

2480
02:16:46,256 --> 02:16:48,656
Is this passport renewal?
Why the new introductions?

2481
02:16:48,936 --> 02:16:49,896
Jalebi!
- Yes?

2482
02:16:50,056 --> 02:16:50,896
Did he lose his memory?

2483
02:16:51,016 --> 02:16:52,656
Why will he bring you
here if he has lost his memory?

2484
02:16:53,016 --> 02:16:54,456
Turn your face.

2485
02:16:55,856 --> 02:16:56,696
Hi!

2486
02:17:06,216 --> 02:17:08,096
Hello! I'm Cherry!

2487
02:17:08,536 --> 02:17:09,296
Really?

2488
02:17:09,456 --> 02:17:10,336
Hug me and find out.

2489
02:17:19,056 --> 02:17:20,856
Uncle, he is Cherry. I'm very sure.

2490
02:17:21,136 --> 02:17:23,936
We saw. Please maintain
a little distance, dear.

2491
02:17:24,296 --> 02:17:25,576
How many more should she hug?

2492
02:17:25,896 --> 02:17:27,616
There are 7 lookalikes
for each person.

2493
02:17:27,776 --> 02:17:29,896
Shut up, you fool!
Even two are too much to handle.

2494
02:17:30,096 --> 02:17:32,296
If another five men appear,
she'll have high fever.

2495
02:17:32,496 --> 02:17:33,336
What is all this about?

2496
02:17:33,576 --> 02:17:35,976
Mom and dad are inside.
They'll tell you everything.

2497
02:17:36,136 --> 02:17:36,936
Okay.

2498
02:17:37,816 --> 02:17:39,856
Uncle, why are you
drinking raw alcohol?

2499
02:17:40,016 --> 02:17:41,856
I feel like drinking blood.
What can I do?

2500
02:17:42,056 --> 02:17:43,416
Sir, can I say something?

2501
02:17:43,696 --> 02:17:46,016
Had he given his sister
to me without seeing my age..

2502
02:17:46,336 --> 02:17:48,656
..we would've met in
the engagement party for fun.

2503
02:17:48,896 --> 02:17:51,216
You wouldn't have
had all these troubles.

2504
02:17:51,496 --> 02:17:52,296
Just think about this thing.

2505
02:17:52,456 --> 02:17:53,536
Remove the part where
I went to see his sister..

2506
02:17:53,696 --> 02:17:54,936
..from this story,
you will understand it yourself.

2507
02:17:57,857 --> 02:17:58,737
Why did you kick me, boss?

2508
02:17:58,897 --> 02:18:01,297
You rascal! Is your sister
an angel or Aishwarya Rai?

2509
02:18:01,617 --> 02:18:02,537
Why didn't you get
her married to him?

2510
02:18:02,697 --> 02:18:04,057
How can I get her married
to this old man, boss?

2511
02:18:04,257 --> 02:18:05,777
No, your sister will
get Pawan Kalyan's son..

2512
02:18:05,937 --> 02:18:09,297
..or Mahesh Babu's
son as her husband.

2513
02:18:09,577 --> 02:18:10,377
Uncle!
- What is it?

2514
02:18:10,497 --> 02:18:12,057
Uncle, I got confused again.

2515
02:18:12,377 --> 02:18:13,617
I kissed Siddhu
thinking it was Cherry.

2516
02:18:13,897 --> 02:18:16,217
He may misunderstand me.
Please go and explain.

2517
02:18:16,497 --> 02:18:20,337
Do you want me to
become the mediator now?

2518
02:18:20,497 --> 02:18:21,897
Sister!
- What did she do now?

2519
02:18:22,177 --> 02:18:24,057
I opened the bathroom
door thinking it was Siddhu.

2520
02:18:24,297 --> 02:18:25,817
Cherry was inside. Sorry, sister.

2521
02:18:26,097 --> 02:18:26,897
That's okay.

2522
02:18:27,057 --> 02:18:29,377
Why not go to the bedroom
instead of bathroom?

2523
02:18:29,617 --> 02:18:31,657
I went the other day, uncle.
But I got confused there too.

2524
02:18:32,497 --> 02:18:33,017
Darn!

2525
02:18:33,337 --> 02:18:35,457
Boss, just like Gandhi
is a grandfather to everyone..

2526
02:18:35,577 --> 02:18:36,577
..you became an uncle
to everyone here.

2527
02:18:36,817 --> 02:18:38,577
I'll break your face with this.

2528
02:18:39,137 --> 02:18:40,297
Jalebi!
- Sir?

2529
02:18:40,617 --> 02:18:42,217
Show them both their right lovers.

2530
02:18:42,497 --> 02:18:44,217
How can I identify them
when their lovers can't?

2531
02:18:44,457 --> 02:18:47,257
Only you have clarity
about the whole program here.

2532
02:18:47,417 --> 02:18:48,777
Take them.
- Okay, sir.

2533
02:18:49,097 --> 02:18:49,977
Let's go, girls.

2534
02:18:50,217 --> 02:18:52,417
Poor Jalebi!
They confused us in half a minute..

2535
02:18:52,577 --> 02:18:56,497
..even though we've been
following them for 6 months.

2536
02:18:56,737 --> 02:18:57,937
Till they achieve their target..

2537
02:18:58,097 --> 02:18:59,617
..they both will
be Naayaks to everyone.

2538
02:18:59,857 --> 02:19:01,617
And both these girls
will be their heroines.

2539
02:19:05,497 --> 02:19:10,657
Hey leader..
you are the leader in love

2540
02:19:11,057 --> 02:19:13,777
My heart is crazy for you

2541
02:19:13,937 --> 02:19:17,057
It is mesmerized and pounding hard

2542
02:19:18,017 --> 02:19:22,297
Hey leader..
you bring happiness to one and all

2543
02:19:22,697 --> 02:19:25,737
Your gaze has a magnetism

2544
02:19:25,897 --> 02:19:30,977
It is pulling me strongly
and turning this queen into an ace

2545
02:19:32,017 --> 02:19:34,377
Hey leader..

2546
02:19:37,337 --> 02:19:40,137
You bring happiness
to one and all..

2547
02:19:43,457 --> 02:19:47,417
Hey leader.. you are great..

2548
02:19:49,577 --> 02:19:52,377
You are the one and only leader

2549
02:19:52,497 --> 02:19:55,097
You have come to
win over our hearts

2550
02:19:55,257 --> 02:19:58,057
You have come to save our lives

2551
02:19:58,217 --> 02:20:00,897
Come to conquer enemies
and win our love

2552
02:20:01,057 --> 02:20:04,137
Kolkata is my favorite
ground with new punch

2553
02:20:04,297 --> 02:20:07,097
I am like this place..
vibrant with energy

2554
02:20:07,257 --> 02:20:09,977
I am like the sweets here
which have an amazing taste

2555
02:20:10,137 --> 02:20:13,177
I have sharp looks and
seek to demonstrate my might

2556
02:20:13,337 --> 02:20:16,377
I shall showcase my power
and youth in everything I do

2557
02:20:16,697 --> 02:20:18,497
Hey leader..

2558
02:20:39,737 --> 02:20:42,297
You are cool and oozing energy

2559
02:20:42,457 --> 02:20:45,177
There is no one to match you

2560
02:20:45,337 --> 02:20:48,257
You are my friend
and my investment

2561
02:20:48,417 --> 02:20:51,017
You are the one
that all look up to

2562
02:20:51,217 --> 02:20:54,057
My lips have become
red due to blushing..

2563
02:20:54,217 --> 02:20:56,577
I am ready to offer myself
to you like a betel leaf

2564
02:20:56,737 --> 02:20:59,497
You may twist,
turn and do what you like..

2565
02:20:59,657 --> 02:21:02,617
I've come to offer my youth to you

2566
02:21:02,777 --> 02:21:05,737
Kolkata is my favorite
ground with new punch

2567
02:21:05,897 --> 02:21:08,897
I am like this place..
vibrant with energy

2568
02:21:09,057 --> 02:21:11,777
I am like the sweets here
which have an amazing taste

2569
02:21:11,897 --> 02:21:14,657
I have sharp looks and
seek to demonstrate my might

2570
02:21:14,777 --> 02:21:18,617
I shall showcase my power
and youth in everything I do

2571
02:21:32,402 --> 02:21:37,017
O Baby girl..
come on to dance - I love my leader

2572
02:21:38,284 --> 02:21:43,017
Serve me your beauty on
a platter - I love my leader

2573
02:21:55,697 --> 02:21:58,857
You are my life and
I am your ardent fan

2574
02:21:59,017 --> 02:22:01,457
You have come to bring joy to all

2575
02:22:01,577 --> 02:22:04,737
You are man and I'm your queen

2576
02:22:04,897 --> 02:22:07,217
You have come to
conquer our hearts

2577
02:22:07,377 --> 02:22:09,937
You are the ruler
of beauty of mine

2578
02:22:10,137 --> 02:22:13,057
I have made you sit
on the throne of my shyness

2579
02:22:13,377 --> 02:22:16,177
It is great if you come
to my life and rule my world

2580
02:22:16,337 --> 02:22:19,097
It is festival everyday
that you embrace me

2581
02:22:19,257 --> 02:22:22,017
Kolkata is my favorite
ground with new punch

2582
02:22:22,177 --> 02:22:25,177
I am like this place..
vibrant with energy

2583
02:22:25,337 --> 02:22:28,097
I am like the sweets here
which have an amazing taste

2584
02:22:28,257 --> 02:22:31,017
I have sharp looks and
seek to demonstrate my might

2585
02:22:31,177 --> 02:22:34,577
I shall showcase my power
and youth in everything I do

2586
02:22:34,857 --> 02:22:36,537
Hey leader..

2587
02:22:36,977 --> 02:22:39,737
You are the one and only leader

2588
02:22:39,977 --> 02:22:42,777
You have come to conquer
and rule our hearts

2589
02:22:43,217 --> 02:22:45,537
You have come to save our lives

2590
02:22:45,657 --> 02:22:49,297
You are one without a match

2591
02:22:51,823 --> 02:22:55,701
Rascal! You gave away
our only proof to that Naayak.

2592
02:22:55,981 --> 02:22:57,501
Why did you come back?

2593
02:22:58,901 --> 02:23:02,141
Don't worry, Mr. Rawat.
I'll give you a fantastic idea..

2594
02:23:02,301 --> 02:23:04,261
..with which you can
finish both of them together.

2595
02:23:06,541 --> 02:23:07,341
What is that?

2596
02:23:07,501 --> 02:23:08,221
I'll tell you.

2597
02:23:11,101 --> 02:23:11,821
Hello!

2598
02:23:11,981 --> 02:23:14,101
Naayak! I know that you love people.

2599
02:23:14,741 --> 02:23:17,901
Come alone to Kolkata
Steels in ten minutes.

2600
02:23:18,301 --> 02:23:21,781
Otherwise 200 school kids
will be blown up in a blast.

2601
02:23:22,221 --> 02:23:23,061
Hey!

2602
02:23:41,341 --> 02:23:43,501
Are you searching for the kids?

2603
02:23:43,781 --> 02:23:44,701
Do you want to save them?

2604
02:23:45,021 --> 02:23:47,341
I lied to you that
I'll kill the children.

2605
02:23:47,621 --> 02:23:50,661
You came here.
This was a plan to kill you.

2606
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:52,181
You can't win even if you kill me.

2607
02:23:52,901 --> 02:23:55,141
I'm not Naayak as you think.
I'm Cherry.

2608
02:23:56,101 --> 02:23:58,381
Really? Then why didn't
you say that in court?

2609
02:23:58,701 --> 02:23:59,541
Shut up!

2610
02:23:59,701 --> 02:24:00,941
Should I tell you a small twist?

2611
02:24:01,341 --> 02:24:03,861
You had called up Naayak.
But I answered that call.

2612
02:24:04,701 --> 02:24:06,341
Naayak is not my brother.

2613
02:24:06,821 --> 02:24:08,901
He is a good man.
You are a bad man.

2614
02:24:09,341 --> 02:24:10,701
He should live to kill you.

2615
02:24:11,181 --> 02:24:13,741
So, I'm ready to die for him.

2616
02:24:14,141 --> 02:24:16,421
You both have turned us into fools.

2617
02:24:16,941 --> 02:24:19,061
I will kill you as per your desire.

2618
02:24:19,581 --> 02:24:21,381
Sis, where's my phone?
- I don't know.

2619
02:24:30,581 --> 02:24:32,981
Naayak, Cherry is dying for you.

2620
02:24:33,581 --> 02:24:38,701
Come and save him.
You've just five minutes. Come!

2621
02:24:40,061 --> 02:24:41,901
One left a while ago.
Now another one is leaving.

2622
02:24:42,141 --> 02:24:43,181
Is he Naayak or Cherry?

2623
02:24:43,901 --> 02:24:45,301
How would I know?
- Darn!

2624
02:24:48,981 --> 02:24:51,741
What?
- Sir, I suspect that they'll kill Rawat.

2625
02:25:58,341 --> 02:26:00,021
Boss, Naayak is dead.

2626
02:26:00,221 --> 02:26:02,061
Yes! Naayak is dead!

2627
02:26:02,701 --> 02:26:03,901
He is dead!

2628
02:26:04,141 --> 02:26:04,861
Superb news, boss.

2629
02:26:05,021 --> 02:26:06,181
Kill this one as well.

2630
02:26:06,501 --> 02:26:08,061
Otherwise people will
turn him into Naayak.

2631
02:26:08,181 --> 02:26:09,741
That's right.
- He'll kill you.

2632
02:26:12,399 --> 02:26:13,701
He was burnt to ashes.

2633
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:15,963
You'll be blown to pieces.

2634
02:26:16,443 --> 02:26:18,283
Put that bomb jacket on him.

2635
02:26:23,963 --> 02:26:25,083
Happy death day!

2636
02:28:00,539 --> 02:28:02,523
He is beating him up brutally.

2637
02:28:02,683 --> 02:28:03,883
Doesn't he have any feelings?

2638
02:28:46,803 --> 02:28:48,723
You've only tasted
Kolkata punches till date.

2639
02:28:49,083 --> 02:28:50,723
Now I'll make you taste
Charminar's punches.

2640
02:29:17,483 --> 02:29:18,683
Why is he putting
the bomb jacket on him?

2641
02:29:18,883 --> 02:29:20,763
Chocolates for us
and jacket for him.

2642
02:29:30,043 --> 02:29:30,563
Boss!

2643
02:29:38,163 --> 02:29:39,723
Their bodies are moving.

2644
02:29:39,843 --> 02:29:41,003
But, of what use
will their lives be?

2645
02:29:41,523 --> 02:29:42,403
What happened here?

2646
02:29:42,803 --> 02:29:43,603
Where is Mr. Rawat?

2647
02:29:43,803 --> 02:29:44,683
He was blown off.

2648
02:29:45,083 --> 02:29:46,883
What?
- Yes, sir.

2649
02:29:47,283 --> 02:29:48,603
Was he a firecracker or something?

2650
02:29:48,763 --> 02:29:50,723
If he was a firecracker,
we would've seen the remains.

2651
02:29:51,203 --> 02:29:52,043
But there are no
remains left of him.

2652
02:29:52,203 --> 02:29:53,483
Who did that to him?
- Naayak.

2653
02:29:53,643 --> 02:29:55,363
There are two Naayaks now.
Which one of them?

2654
02:29:55,483 --> 02:29:56,243
Actually, the one..

2655
02:29:56,403 --> 02:29:58,403
Shut up! You'll fare better
if you stop your loose talk.

2656
02:29:58,803 --> 02:30:00,123
Or you'll get locked by the CBI.

2657
02:30:00,363 --> 02:30:01,243
I don't know anything, sir.

2658
02:30:01,403 --> 02:30:02,883
Then what are you doing here?

2659
02:30:03,163 --> 02:30:05,803
I heard we get Puttur
oil to heal broken bones.

2660
02:30:06,083 --> 02:30:07,083
We came here for that, sir.

2661
02:30:07,483 --> 02:30:09,683
Puttur is in Chittoor.
This is Kolkata.

2662
02:30:10,083 --> 02:30:11,243
Sir, this fellow is an idiot.

2663
02:30:11,483 --> 02:30:13,523
We got into Howrah Express
instead of Sarkar Express.

2664
02:30:13,763 --> 02:30:15,123
It seems this is Kolkata.

2665
02:30:15,243 --> 02:30:17,083
You got me into a train
for Kolkata like an idiot.

2666
02:30:17,243 --> 02:30:18,123
The Sarkar Express
was on platform number..

2667
02:30:18,363 --> 02:30:19,483
Sir, one man was blown to pieces.

2668
02:30:19,883 --> 02:30:20,763
The witnesses ran away.

2669
02:30:21,003 --> 02:30:23,043
Our witness won't
be taken into account.

2670
02:30:23,323 --> 02:30:25,603
We'll close the case
as it has no evidences.

2671
02:30:25,883 --> 02:30:27,003
We'll forget everything
and have a drink.

2672
02:30:27,283 --> 02:30:29,643
I knew that this
case won't get solved.

2673
02:30:31,523 --> 02:30:33,443
Yes, Gajalaxmi. I'm coming.

2674
02:30:33,723 --> 02:30:34,923
Jalebi!
- Yes?

2675
02:30:35,043 --> 02:30:36,283
I hope all the twists are done.

2676
02:30:36,443 --> 02:30:38,763
Will there be any more twists
before we get to Hyderabad?

2677
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,563
What other twists
will be there, uncle?

2678
02:30:40,723 --> 02:30:41,483
Only their weddings are left.

2679
02:30:41,603 --> 02:30:43,083
Please get me married
along with them, sir.

2680
02:30:43,243 --> 02:30:46,083
Hey! I'll kill you if you
talk about your wedding again.

2681
02:30:47,163 --> 02:30:49,843
Cherry, you took a big
risk that nobody will to save me.

2682
02:30:50,283 --> 02:30:51,123
I can never forget you.

2683
02:30:51,363 --> 02:30:54,163
Brother, I did it for
your loved ones, not for you.

2684
02:30:54,563 --> 02:30:55,883
You should be safe. Okay?

2685
02:30:56,523 --> 02:30:57,283
Thank you.

2686
02:31:08,608 --> 02:31:10,563
I heard you gave summons to..

2687
02:31:10,883 --> 02:31:11,763
..vacate Gandhinagar Colony.

2688
02:31:12,003 --> 02:31:13,163
That is a government land.

2689
02:31:13,243 --> 02:31:14,643
People are not for the government.

2690
02:31:14,918 --> 02:31:16,993
Government is for the people.
