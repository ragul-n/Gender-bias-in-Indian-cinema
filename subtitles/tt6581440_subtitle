00:00:33,849 --> 00:03:15,528
Movie downloaded from SoDesi.org

2
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:15,528
Mother dear, O pray for me.

3
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:22,005
Whilst far from Heaven and Thee

4
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,873
I wander in a fragile bark.

5
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:36,750
O'er life's tempestuous sea.

6
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,551
O Virgin Mother.

7
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,527
From Thy throne,

8
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:51,502
So bright in bliss above.

9
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:55,566
Protect Thy child.

10
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,940
And cheer my path.

11
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:05,314
With Thy sweet smile of love.

12
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:13,515
Mother dear, remember me.

13
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,631
And never cease Thy care.

14
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:28,038
Till in Heaven eternally.

15
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:34,335
Thy love and bliss I share.

16
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:42,679
Mother dear, remember me.

17
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:49,590
And never cease Thy care.

18
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:57,361
Till in Heaven eternally.

19
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:04,740
Thy love and bliss I share.

20
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,752
And don't expect a grand
function like last time.

21
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,006
Tomorrow she will
turn 7 years old.

22
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,755
I told Unni, that we need not have these
celebrations from this year onwards.

23
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,124
But he won't listen!

24
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,692
What will she feel?

25
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,696
After celebrating it
grandly all these years,

26
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,526
when there is a sudden stop;

27
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,895
That's also true.

28
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,769
Kids, right?
They would feel bad.

29
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,969
What's the plan today?

30
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,067
Are you going home straight
or any other trips?

31
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,079
No. We just have to
go to Garden Centre.

32
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,201
Some shopping-

33
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,746
We haven't bought anything for tomorrow.
- Carry on then.

34
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,409
See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

35
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,550
Ya. We're leaving.

36
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,083
Sorry Daisy.

37
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,855
What is this, Cyriac?

38
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,165
Still hung over from last night?

39
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,499
Oh! You came and bumped into
me and the blame is on me?

40
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,558
Okay.

41
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,168
What is it, Unni?
Aren't you going home?

42
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:10,940
We are waiting for Ila and mom.

43
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,602
Where did they go?

44
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,112
Grand-mom's & granddaughter's
prayers are not over yet.

45
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,047
Aren't you ashamed, Cyriac?

46
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,111
To ask this in front of
the Church during lent?

47
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:28,092
Because of lent, tomorrow's function would
be strictly vegetarian <i>&</i> non-alcoholic.

48
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,625
That's awesome!

49
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,991
So, I won't be there tomorrow
I have better things to do!

50
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,719
Don't be upset, Cyriac.

51
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:34,925
We'll figure out a way.

52
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:35,932
What way?

53
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:36,989
Unni.

54
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,834
I agreed to host tomorrow's function
because you promised me all these.

55
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,928
Don't forget that.

56
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,936
Rest you can tell her.

57
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,099
What is this, Aunty?

58
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,806
Looks like you were giving Christ
a tough time with your prayers.

59
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,176
I am getting older, son.

60
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,012
So I'll be thinking
about God all the more.

61
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,141
Hello birthday girl!

62
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,710
As usual, your song was amazing!

63
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,947
Thank you uncle!

64
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,751
Even I felt devotional.

65
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,646
Shall we leave then?

66
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,354
We have a lot of things to do.
- Shopping?

67
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,196
Ya. We haven't bought
anything for tomorrow

68
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:05,751
Okay.

69
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:07,954
Get in.

70
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,004
There's an offer on liquor
at Sainsbury's now.

71
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,709
Mom,

72
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,689
haven't you prepared a
list of the things to buy?

73
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,221
I can't roam around
too much over there.

74
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:35,758
That's all ready!

75
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,624
You just look straight and drive!

76
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,891
If not anything else, hasn't it
been around 12 years,

77
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,763
since I've started coming for
shopping with you in this country?

78
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,726
It's from France.

79
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:49,197
Hello! Who is this?

80
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,071
Your dad lnjasshery
Pothan's elder offspring!

81
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,177
Brother!
Is that you?

82
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,804
Where are you calling from?
France?

83
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,947
Didn't you understand that
seeing the number, you fool?

84
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:58,971
Yes. I did.

85
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,176
When did you reach there?

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,617
It's been two days.

87
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,879
Didn't I tell you,

88
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,549
about an international meet
of strawberry growers?

89
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,647
I came for that.

90
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,713
Where is mom?

91
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,055
I am here, dear.

92
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,957
Mom, I've been trying to
call him for so long!

93
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,225
It was switched off.

94
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,062
Bro, we were at the Church.

95
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,269
Since you don't believe
in God or the Church,

96
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,898
you wouldn't have remembered that today is
a Sunday and that we have to go to Church,

97
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:22,962
rig ht?

98
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,203
Or is it because you're still
hung over from last night?

99
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,937
Actually both, mom!

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,243
So ya. I'll stop wasting time
and tell you why I called.

101
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,914
Ya. Say it.

102
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,014
My job here is over.

103
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,883
So, I'm thinking if I should come
there as well, on the way back.

104
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,078
What say?

105
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,785
It's been long since
I saw you all.

106
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,662
Good that my son felt
so at least now.

107
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,225
Praise the Lord!

108
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,760
So I'll call in the evening
after booking the tickets.

109
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:51,858
Unni.

110
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,269
Okay, bro.

111
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,293
Okay.

112
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,948
Grandma, shouldn't we buy
coal for the barbecue?

113
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:12,845
That's rig ht!

114
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,391
That's over there.
Come!

115
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,266
This offer looks quite good.
- Hello!

116
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,736
Well, I was just..

117
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:27,927
Shall we go?

118
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:35,735
Thank you.

119
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,645
Grandma, I want to
go to the wash room.

120
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,777
Hey!

121
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,214
She wants to go
to the wash room.

122
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,157
I'll take her.

123
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,353
Should I come, mom?
- No. You carry on.

124
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,851
Come, dear.

125
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,673
What happened to your brother?

126
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,905
To suddenly have a
desire to see everyone?

127
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,367
Well, he has come so close, right?

128
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,675
So he would have thought he'll
see everyone and leave.

129
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,408
If that's the case, fine.

130
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,181
What else can it be?

131
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,783
Well,

132
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,854
He wouldn't have forgotten what happened
and what he said long back, right?

133
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,155
As far as I know, he
doesn't have Alzheimer's.

134
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,165
And my brother always
stands by his word.

135
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,200
And he has proved that
through all these years.

136
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,290
Unni!

137
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,397
Leave her!

138
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,885
Mom!

139
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:53,806
My child!

140
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,177
Ila!

141
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,247
Mom!

142
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,115
Mom!

143
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,550
Ya. Good morning.

144
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,392
Mr. Cyriac, what time
is the cremation?

145
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,396
We are still waiting
for her elder son.

146
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,225
Is that him?

147
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:20,626
Ya. That's him.

148
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:21,961
Adam.

149
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,036
Ichaya, (brother)

150
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,155
lchaya,

151
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,298
Unni, I'll sleep in
the living room.

152
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,639
That will be comfortable for me.

153
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:36,333
The heater in that room
is not working properly.

154
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,674
And, later in the night;

155
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,001
It will be much colder
than this, lchaya.

156
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,435
This is Mom's <i>&</i> lla's room.

157
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,212
Ila used to sing really well.

158
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,172
She was really active,

159
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:18,711
in the Church Choir.

160
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,107
Actually,

161
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,382
what was it that happened here?

162
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,250
To do something like this,

163
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,818
who has so much
grudge against us?

164
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:33,825
I don't know, lchaya.

165
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,834
As far as I know, there's
no one like that.

166
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,829
Apart from some petty issues that
have happened in the office;

167
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:44,407
Me and Shwetha have never had any
such clashes with anyone here.

168
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,266
In.

169
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,313
I have a slight headache.

170
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,505
Shall I go to sleep?

171
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:53,706
Good night.

172
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:32,084
(Prayers being chanted in the Church)

173
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,401
Why isn't this getting over?

174
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,735
It's taking so long!

175
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,743
This is why I don't come
for Christian weddings.

176
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,543
They will keep us waiting
to be bored to death.

177
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
But our weddings are
so much better!

178
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,376
Just go there, tie
the wedding chain,

179
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,713
wear the garlands, get the
girl and run three rounds.

180
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:00,649
Finished!

181
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,378
But it gets over there, rig ht?

182
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,356
After that, it's all
vegetarian, right?

183
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,617
Kalan, Olan, Avial & Sam bar.
(Kerala Vegetarian dishes)

184
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,893
But is it like that here?

185
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,365
We will have a feast today!

186
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,403
This wait becomes meaningful
only when we think about that.

187
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,536
Oh! All of you are here?

188
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:21,900
You came alone?

189
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:23,869
Didn't your husbands <i>&</i> kids come?

190
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,671
Well Pothan, don't you
want any of that?

191
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,372
In our batch, you are the
only one left to get married!

192
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,306
Where does he have
time for all that?

193
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,410
He's making an Eden Garden
at the High Range, right?

194
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:33,679
New Generation Adam.

195
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
Yes.

196
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:37,312
Only after his garden is fully
ready, he will get married.

197
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,386
But you should see his
younger brother Unni.

198
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,153
Before he turned 22,

199
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,785
he got married to a
classmate of his,

200
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,488
and is now settled in Europe.

201
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,623
But our man is still walking around
getting leech bites in that plantation.

202
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,699
Your world is between Fort
Kochi & Oberon Mall, right?

203
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:51,634
One day,

204
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,705
come to my plantation
for just one day!

205
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,173
Then you will say that the original
Eden Garden is nothing compared to it.

206
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:13,252
'Thou, planter of the Eden Garden'

207
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:17,656
'Thou art mine own youthful groom'

208
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:22,827
'From thy garden for my sake'

209
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,305
'Send Thy breeze, cool, refreshing'

210
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:31,867
'0, Thou just and true Bridegroom!'

211
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:36,642
'Lord am I Thy humble bride'

212
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:41,209
'Thou only refuge for me'

213
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:45,416
'Let Thy mercy rain on me'

214
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:09,505
'Thou, planter of the Eden Garden'

215
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:14,044
'Thou art mine own youthful groom'

216
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,912
'From thy garden for my sake'

217
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:23,622
'Send Thy breeze, cool, refreshing'

218
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:28,390
'0, Thou just and true Bridegroom!'

219
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:32,967
'Lord am I Thy humble bride'

220
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:37,735
'Thou only refuge for me'

221
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,869
'Let Thy mercy rain on me'

222
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,476
Hello!
Excuse me!

223
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,041
Please move.

224
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:49,842
Hi.

225
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,010
I'm Adam.

226
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,752
The bridegroom's...

227
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,948
As in, Jacob's classmate"

228
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,349
Hi.

229
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,727
The choir was really nice.

230
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,724
I really liked it.

231
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:01,664
Thank you.

232
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,393
Do you have a card or something?

233
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,568
For us to contact, if some
programme comes up at our Church.

234
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,663
George, do you have our card with you?

235
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,396
Thanks.

236
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,307
Angel Symphflny.

237
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,838
For bookings, contact
George C Philip,

238
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,381
Amy Andrews.

239
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:18,905
Amy?

240
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,506
That's me.

241
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:45,905
It's so expensive, man!

242
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,543
2000 Rupees for one shin?

243
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,961
That's the price
of 5 full bottles!

244
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,447
But it wasn't you
who paid, rig ht?

245
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:53,079
Even if you paid it, we
lost 5 full bottles, right?

246
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,612
5 full bottles
will have 62 pegs.

247
00:22:56,744 --> 00:23:00,055
With your capacity, I would have gotten
to finish 3/4th's of it! You know that?

248
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:01,716
Let's go return this.

249
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:02,815
Come here.

250
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,150
Dude!

251
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,125
Shucks! My 62 pegs!

252
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,186
Get in.

253
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:19,939
Yes!
<i>_</i>

254
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,118
Oh God!

255
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:36,388
Don't step on my “♪9!

256
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,793
Can I step on your head instead?

257
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,558
Daddy, please!
- What is this?

258
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,895
Daddy, com e.

259
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,405
No! No! I am all right!

260
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:53,845
Didn't we park our car here?

261
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,403
Such a drunkard!
I feel jealous!

262
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,879
Here it is!
- Not that way.

263
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,414
This way!
- Oh! There?

264
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,041
Daddy,

265
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:03,643
listen to me.

266
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,513
Don't drive in this condition.

267
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,885
We'll take an auto rickshaw.

268
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,620
And we'll come back
tomorrow <i>&</i> take it.

269
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:11,629
What condition? I
am absolutely fine!

270
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,862
Daddy!
- Get into the car!

271
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:15,758
Get into the car!

272
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:19,959
Daddy!

273
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,200
Come. Let's go to the room
quickly <i>&</i> become like this.

274
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,701
Did you recognize
who that girl is?

275
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:25,865
No.

276
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:26,968
That's the girl,

277
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,640
who sang the choir for
Jacob's wedding yesterday.

278
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,057
Daddy, slowdown!

279
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,121
Watch out!

280
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:49,922
No!

281
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,459
Who is that behind me?

282
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,733
You're messing with me?

283
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,976
Should we go right behind him?

284
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:06,142
Daddy, slowly.

285
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,683
I know!
I know!

286
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,817
Daddy, please go slowly.

287
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:12,251
Watch out!
Careful, daddy!

288
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,183
Dude, this guy is
driving dangerously.

289
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,095
Daddy, slowly!
Slow! Slow!

290
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:18,653
I know!
I know!

291
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,295
The brake has failed.

292
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:30,639
Daddy!

293
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,243
While coming, this was straight.

294
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,972
There were no turns then.

295
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,104
I'll set it right now!

296
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:38,571
Who is that?

297
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,081
I think the battery is down.

298
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,886
Dude, where are you going?

299
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,548
Just a minute!

300
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,856
It will be all rig ht now.
Wait.

301
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:52,718
Chetta, (Brother)

302
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,293
all the cars behind
you are stuck.

303
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,730
If you could move this,
all of us could leave.

304
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,231
Please co-operate, brother.

305
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,707
You don't have to go and host
anyone's funeral, right?

306
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:04,902
You can go slowly.

307
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,570
Don't you drive?

308
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:11,104
No.

309
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,317
Chetta, com e.

310
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,284
Come!

311
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,218
What's the matter?
- I'll tell you.

312
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:24,125
Get inside!
- What is this?

313
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:25,595
What is this?
- Get inside.

314
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:27,290
- What is he doing?
- Sit. I'll tell you.

315
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,025
Dude, you drive our car.

316
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,032
I'll drop you at the exit.

317
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,075
I don't understand what's happening here.
Are you kidnapping us?

318
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:38,574
Or is it goondaism?

319
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,774
Dear, dial 100.
Call the police!

320
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:42,935
Police!

321
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,204
Who are you?

322
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:49,013
Who are you to send me to the back
seat from my car's driving seat?

323
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,076
Tell me!

324
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,612
Daddy, please keep quiet.

325
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:53,746
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:54,884
It's all right.

327
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,793
Did you recognize me?

328
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,925
We met at the Church yesterday.

329
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:02,623
Ya. I recognized you.

330
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,700
Where are you going?

331
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:05,858
Fort Kochi.

332
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:07,894
That's great.

333
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:08,998
We are also going there.

334
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,642
We are staying at Bristow
Lighthouse there.

335
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:12,800
So there's no problem.

336
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,612
I will drive you home.

337
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:16,648
There's no need for that.

338
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,817
Drop us at the exit.
We shall go.

339
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:24,748
With him in this condition,

340
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:27,332
rather than taking him on an auto
ride with a complete stranger,

341
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,018
isn't it better that
I drop you home?

342
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,184
If not anything else,

343
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,229
we have an acquaintance
of one day, right?

344
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,934
Dude, you follow this car.

345
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,446
I am here, right behind you.

346
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:02,894
What does your daddy do?

347
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,864
You know?
I am a sailor!

348
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,919
A captain!

349
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:10,231
I used to be a sailor who sailed
ships through the great oceans,

350
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,964
without bothering about thunderous
storms and incessant rains.

351
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:16,808
And you sent me away from
my driving seat now!

352
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,070
You will regret it.

353
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,406
You must regret!
- Sir, you were a Captain?

354
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,140
You mean, like..
In Merchant Navy?

355
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,004
He's bluffing.

356
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,675
Until a few days back,

357
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,378
he used to run a workshop.

358
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,051
Now that's also shut.

359
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,385
And he's sitting at home
idle, without doing any job!

360
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,310
This house on the right side.

361
00:28:58,806 --> 00:28:59,806
Okay.

362
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,454
Daddy!

363
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,758
I will drive from here.

364
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,958
I'll hold you.

365
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:16,556
I am all right.

366
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:18,157
I am all right.

367
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,059
Okay!

368
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,461
All right!

369
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,207
I know it was a lot
of trouble for you.

370
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:29,769
Thanks.

371
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:32,572
Good night.

372
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,107
Good night.

373
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:17,794
'This breeze came and
whispered in my ear'

374
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:26,170
'That you are mine;
Only mine, forever'

375
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:34,879
'Will you embrace my life,
while my breath fades away?'

376
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,049
'You are the music which my
silences have been searching for'

377
00:30:44,945 --> 00:30:45,945
Am Y»

378
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,351
before going back today,

379
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:50,417
I wanted to say
something to you.

380
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:53,586
Nothing else;

381
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,899
If it is okay for you,

382
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,265
I would like to marry you, Amy.

383
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:01,595
I know about your situation
and your problems.

384
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,933
If your answer is positive,

385
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,900
I know how to deal
with your Daddy.

386
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:06,966
Amy!

387
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,714
Come fast!
They are about to take the body.

388
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:21,893
'For my eyes, you are the world'

389
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:29,428
'For my ears, you
are the symphony'

390
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:38,298
'Will you embrace my life,
while my breath fades away?'

391
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:43,310
'You are the music which my
silences have been searching for'

392
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:47,010
'Did your rosy lips
quiver, 0' lil' birdie?'

393
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:50,987
'Did your heartbeats rise?
Tell me softly'

394
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:54,548
'Who's that on the Red Lucky
Seed tree, my dear birdie?'

395
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:58,390
'Who got closer to you
whispering sweet nothings?'

396
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:02,293
'Did your rosy lips
quiver, 0' lil' birdie?'

397
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:06,130
'Did your heartbeats rise?
Tell me softly'

398
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,933
'Who's that on the Red Lucky
Seed tree, my dear birdie?'

399
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,944
'Who got closer to you
whispering sweet nothings?'

400
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:29,287
'As I slowly caress the shyness that
made you shut the doors to your eyes'

401
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:33,158
'From now on, you will
be with me forever'

402
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,429
'To give me light, 0' dear moonlight'

403
00:32:36,523 --> 00:32:40,061
'Turning every little
sorrow into a smile'

404
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:43,934
'You are my better half'

405
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:47,602
'Turning every night into a day'

406
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:51,278
'You are the sunshine of truth'

407
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:54,649
'You are his soulmate'

408
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:58,318
'Like a colourful palm print'

409
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:03,155
'I will guard you without
batting an eyelid, my dear'

410
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,528
'In the depths of these blue eyes'

411
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:16,236
'I am melting in
them, unknowingly'

412
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:50,807
You fool!

413
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:51,741
You fool!

414
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,574
I sent you a ticket to
come for my wedding;

415
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:56,171
And you got drunk at the airport
lounger & slept off there?

416
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,236
Sorry, bro!

417
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:59,415
I've been waiting here like
this to compensate for that.

418
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,680
Both of you put your
luggage into this car.

419
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:02,742
Let's go!

420
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:10,055
A Scottish Cattle House
in the 16th Century.

421
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,356
Now, a Honeymoon cottage.

422
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:13,659
For the next one week, it
belongs to Mr.& Mrs. Pothan.

423
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:22,762
Hello!

424
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,635
There's a room inside.

425
00:34:58,866 --> 00:34:59,866
Shucks!

426
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:02,402
Excuse me!

427
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,540
All blue for 100.

428
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:06,105
Ya Amy!

429
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,607
We are..

430
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:09,509
We are outside.

431
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:12,912
What happened?

432
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,389
Amy!

433
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,363
What is it, Amy?
What happened?

434
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,761
I'll tell you.

435
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:29,862
Close the door.

436
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:39,275
Didn't you tell me that day,

437
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,653
that for many years, we just
need ourselves between us?

438
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:45,120
And that we don't need
any commitments?

439
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,523
But, I don't think that
would be possible now.

440
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,184
In.

441
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,286
I am pregnant.

442
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:58,891
Really?

443
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:01,627
Well..

444
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,496
We just..

445
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:05,608
Anyway»

446
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,679
we are going back to
Kerala next week, right?

447
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:09,575
So for the time being,

448
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,383
don't tell this to
anyone here now.

449
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,439
Gosh!

450
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,487
Seeing me being all
weak and fragile,

451
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,520
I was forced to do
this pregnancy test,

452
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:19,682
by mom <i>&</i> Shwetha!

453
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,156
And,

454
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,351
did they know this?

455
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:23,520
How wouldn't they?

456
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:25,318
Shucks!

457
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:26,853
Ichaya!

458
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:29,222
Congrats!

459
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,825
Shut up, dude.
I'm going...

460
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:31,767
Son,

461
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:34,429
when you go back to Kerala,
go to Bharananganam Church,

462
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:37,271
and get a song Qurbana done
in her name without fail.

463
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,703
That's an offering I made.

464
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,209
Oh! Okay.

465
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,778
We'll go together and do it.

466
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:44,475
But how will she come back to
Kerala with you in this stage?

467
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,415
She can't travel now.
Don't you know that?

468
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:47,349
Well,

469
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:50,819
We haven't even decided whether
we need this now or not.

470
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,891
It hasn't even been six
months since the wedding.

471
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,687
Why? ls there some
law like that?

472
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:56,693
That she can't be pregnant
before six months?

473
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,389
Mom, it's not like that.

474
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:00,295
We aren't prepared yet.

475
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:02,362
Why should you be prepared?

476
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:03,423
She will be!

477
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,868
What I'm saying“
- Child,

478
00:37:04,925 --> 00:37:06,427
don't make me talk further.

479
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,439
People here are still
taking lent and praying

480
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:11,374
even though it's been 5 years since
their wedding. That's when you..

481
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,011
Anyway, each one is selfish
about their own life.

482
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:16,677
Do whatever you want to.

483
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:40,729
Mom, I was just
saying an opinion.

484
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:43,365
You are the one who takes the
final decision in these matters.

485
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,430
Never!

486
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,009
This is about your life.

487
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,778
So you both should
decide about it.

488
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:48,711
Isn't that so?

489
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:50,372
Then, we have decided.

490
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:53,007
In this matter, your
wish is our command.

491
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:54,674
Are you sure?

492
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:56,642
I'm sure!

493
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,915
Then my son should agree
to one more thing.

494
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,454
Let's have the delivery over here.

495
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:03,616
Well, l..

496
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:05,592
Listen to me.
Let me complete.

497
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,287
Anyway»

498
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:10,335
Amy cannot travel in a flight
for the next 3-4 months.

499
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:12,738
After that, it's just
a matter of few days.

500
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,060
If it is here,

501
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,528
all of us are here.

502
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:19,670
And even in the hospitals, she
would get much better care here.

503
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:21,974
You can also stay here, right?

504
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,005
That won't be possible, mom!

505
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,484
Already, that Pappi has made
a mess out of things there.

506
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,583
If I don't reach there
at least by next week,

507
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:31,088
the workers will go on strike.

508
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:32,789
The condition is that bad.

509
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:34,881
Anyway»

510
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:36,892
she has to stay here for
four months, right?

511
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:38,795
There's no other option, right?

512
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:40,791
The rest,

513
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,694
we can decide then.

514
00:38:48,762 --> 00:38:51,641
Hey! We have just started
living our life;

515
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,603
I just meant that we
needn't have this already.

516
00:38:58,906 --> 00:38:59,906
It's okay.

517
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,909
Everyone is really happy.

518
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,651
I'm not spoiling that.

519
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:15,693
'You showered as the snowfall of love in
my heart, and I couldn't have enough of it'

520
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:22,901
'You wrote dreams of Eden with a
rainbow, allover my heart'

521
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:30,539
'You have given me this beautiful
sunshine every morning'

522
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:37,681
'You should come and embrace me,
for me to fall asleep in the night'

523
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:44,856
'Are you joining me like a shadow
on my path, with your words?'

524
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:49,595
'I can't do without
you, my dear moonlight'

525
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:54,729
'This breeze has the
fragrance of your love'

526
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:01,879
'These nights have your
passionate persona'

527
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:11,615
'Will you embrace my life,
while my breath fades away?'

528
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:16,895
'You are the music which my
silences have been searching for'

529
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,624
'Did your rosy lips
quiver, 0' lil' birdie?'

530
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:21,393
Son, when are you going there?

531
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,455
Tomorrow.

532
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:25,470
Will you bring the child <i>&</i> mother here
after the delivery, for us to see?

533
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,597
Of course!

534
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,732
It will be a girl.
Wait & watch!

535
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,868
Nirmala ma'am had
prayed for that a lot.

536
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,934
So this time, it will
definitely happen.

537
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:38,972
'Did your heartbeats rise?
Tell me softly'

538
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,010
'Who's that on the Red Lucky
Seed tree, my dear birdie?'

539
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:47,048
'Who got closer to you
whispering sweet nothings?'

540
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:55,555
What is it?

541
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:00,028
When is your flight tomorrow?

542
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,095
Did you forget?

543
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:04,116
I will board the
flight tomorrow night.

544
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:09,236
Can you pre-pone the journey
to today, on the same flight?

545
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,670
What?

546
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:12,105
What happened?

547
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,947
Amy was admitted to the
hospital some time back.

548
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:17,119
There are some complications.

549
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:18,911
Ichaya,

550
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
you should..
- Dear!

551
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:24,617
Hello?

552
00:41:25,018 --> 00:41:26,122
Unni?
Hello?

553
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:35,294
Mom!

554
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,410
Unni!

555
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:32,712
Unni!

556
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,318
My ticket should be
ready for tomorrow

557
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,924
I want to leave tomorrow.

558
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,064
Didn't you hear me?

559
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:44,824
I'll do that.

560
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,060
But son,

561
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,103
if you're leaving tomorrow,

562
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,401
what about the baby?

563
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:52,906
Have you thought about it?

564
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:53,967
No.

565
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:55,344
I haven't thought about it.

566
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:59,036
It was you all, who were in a hurry to make
her deliver the baby and raise her, right?

567
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,147
So you can decide what to do.

568
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:22,695
What is it?

569
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,030
Well,

570
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,100
Nothing, lchaya.

571
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,347
What is it, Shwetha?
What's the matter?

572
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,270
Well..

573
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:34,012
Didn't you say yesterday,

574
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,821
that you haven't taken any
decision about the child?

575
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:40,255
Forgive me if what
I'm asking is wrong.

576
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:42,952
If that's the case,

577
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,654
shall we raise her?

578
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,060
As our daughter?

579
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,900
Think about it really well and
give us an answer after that.

580
00:44:54,128 --> 00:44:57,405
It's not a decision that you
can take quickly, right?

581
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,328
I didn't have to think too much,

582
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:56,763
to give her to them.

583
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,796
The day after reaching Kerala,

584
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:01,935
I called Unni and
gave my consent.

585
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:04,733
In my state of mind back then,

586
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:07,343
that baby was an
uninvited guest,

587
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:10,541
who came by taking
away my Amy's life.

588
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:13,506
But today,

589
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,510
thinking about that
great sin I committed,

590
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:20,792
I have been repenting
every single day, Cyriac.

591
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,427
Maybe it's because I have
that guilt within me;

592
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:28,060
lam not even able to ask
what happened to my child,

593
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,296
confidently to anyone here.

594
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:35,065
But I want to know,

595
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,776
at least whether she
is dead or alive.

596
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:10,096
Ichaya,

597
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:13,840
we are thinking of going
back on duty from today.

598
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,009
We can't take leave
for too many days.

599
00:47:17,571 --> 00:47:20,245
And it will be a change from
this atmosphere as well.

600
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:24,177
That's good.

601
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:29,048
So,

602
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:30,556
what are your plans?

603
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:33,023
I mean, your return?

604
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,566
I haven't decided about that.

605
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:38,591
Especially,

606
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,900
leaving you in such a situation.

607
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:43,329
Let's wait.

608
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:44,931
There is time.

609
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:54,273
Tell him!

610
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:55,581
How can I be more obvious?

611
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:15,695
Don't get up.

612
00:48:17,364 --> 00:48:18,364
I'll see.

613
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:25,980
Mr. <i>&</i> Mrs. Pothan?

614
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,410
Please be seated.

615
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:43,896
We understand this is a
very tough time for you.

616
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:47,068
But we would appreciate if you would
answer a few questions for us.

617
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:49,229
Please go ahead.

618
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:50,936
Mrs. Pothan,

619
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:53,444
we would like you to go through
this list and tell us,

620
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,277
if your daughter had some friend or
acquaintance that we are yet to know about.

621
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:00,418
What about the van?

622
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,042
Excuse me?

623
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,154
The van“ In which they took her!

624
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:06,446
Have you found it?

625
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
And you are?

626
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:10,959
That's Adam.

627
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:12,151
My brother.

628
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:15,395
Mr. Adam, this is a police
investigation in progress.

629
00:49:15,689 --> 00:49:18,966
We will let you know as soon as we
know the whereabouts of your girl.

630
00:49:19,026 --> 00:49:20,232
Is that a no, Ma'am?

631
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,240
Ichaya, please.

632
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,030
I'm sorry.

633
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:25,372
Why are you getting
scared, Unni?

634
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:27,105
It's been so many days
since the incident,

635
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:29,647
and they are still enquiring about
a 7 year old girl's friends!

636
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,478
You still haven't
answered my question!

637
00:49:31,705 --> 00:49:32,705
Right!

638
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,315
Mr. <i>&</i> Mrs. Pothan,

639
00:49:37,378 --> 00:49:39,654
we're fairly within our rights
to have you summoned down

640
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:41,124
to the police station for this.

641
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:42,727
Thought we'd play
the good Samaritan.

642
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,016
But obviously,

643
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:45,595
this isn't working out well.

644
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,296
10 AM tomorrow, at the
North Park Police Station;

645
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:51,366
And this time, for your sake;

646
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:54,197
I hope you do not have company.

647
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:06,316
The way you behaved to
them was totally wrong.

648
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,410
It's us, who are going to
suffer because of this!

649
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,517
Didn't you hear their questions?

650
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,690
They are asking about her friends..
- That's just your imagination.

651
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:16,194
The police here doesn't follow
our country's police system.

652
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,558
Understand that first.

653
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:20,291
And, they came here to see us.

654
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:22,125
Leave alone giving
your opinions there;

655
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,637
Even your presence shouldn't
have been there in this room!

656
00:50:26,593 --> 00:50:27,593
To be frank,

657
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:29,330
your presence here,

658
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,142
is giving us tension <i>&</i>
pressure more than relief.

659
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:36,170
Your looks and expressions at times are
like we did all this deliberately!

660
00:50:36,503 --> 00:50:38,744
I haven't thought like that
even in my dreams, Unni.

661
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:41,708
And,

662
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:45,250
if you have ever felt like
that from my side;

663
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:48,348
I'm sorry.

664
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:54,259
I will give you the details of my
open itinerary back to Kerala.

665
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,262
Book my return ticket,

666
00:50:58,092 --> 00:50:59,628
on the closest available date.

667
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:01,728
In.

668
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:05,174
I will go back.

669
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:24,851
Hello.

670
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,352
Where are you?

671
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:27,587
I am outside.

672
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:29,155
And,

673
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:30,668
Shwetha felt slightly dizzy.

674
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:32,599
So we are going to the doctor.

675
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:33,826
What happened?

676
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:35,635
Nothing to worry, lchaya.

677
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:37,398
The BP might have shot up.

678
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:38,798
And ya.

679
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,136
Your ticket is confirmed
for tomorrow.

680
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,275
It's inside the table
drawer in my room.

681
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:45,306
We might be late to get back.

682
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,316
So you can have
dinner <i>&</i> go to sleep.

683
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:48,714
I won't go to sleep.

684
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,479
Call me as soon as
you see the doctor;

685
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:51,544
Okay?

686
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:37,825
You didn't sleep yet?

687
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:38,951
No.

688
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:40,859
Why didn't you call me?

689
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:43,764
Well, there was no problem.

690
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:45,629
<i>Mam.</i>

691
00:53:46,026 --> 00:53:47,903
That just went up.

692
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:50,667
Are you okay now?

693
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:55,878
Then, why don't you go to sleep?

694
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:57,441
You saw the ticket, rig ht?

695
00:53:57,504 --> 00:53:59,882
The flight is from Glasgow
at 10 AM tomorrow

696
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,245
You have to leave
at least by 6 AM.

697
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:03,576
Good night.

698
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,220
I am not leaving tomorrow, Unni.

699
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:12,585
I want to know;

700
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:15,533
What happened to Ila.

701
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:17,857
Our mom;

702
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:21,462
Who killed her and for what?

703
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:23,837
Not just you,

704
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:26,268
all of us want to know that.

705
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,244
And I told you, rig ht?

706
00:54:28,802 --> 00:54:31,339
The police force here
is very intelligent.

707
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:33,339
I believe that,

708
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:36,712
they would be able to find the
answers as soon as possible.

709
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:38,811
So be it.

710
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:40,313
Very good.

711
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:42,790
For my peace of mind;

712
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:45,755
Until they discover at
least some of the answers;

713
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:47,856
I have decided to stay
back here in this city.

714
00:54:49,757 --> 00:54:50,757
And,

715
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:52,929
like my presence for you;

716
00:54:53,827 --> 00:54:56,273
To live in this house which
has memories of mom and Ila,

717
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,534
is suffocating for me as well.

718
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:00,867
So,

719
00:55:01,402 --> 00:55:02,608
from tomorrow,

720
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,283
lam thinking of
shifting somewhere else.

721
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:08,014
What are you saying?

722
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:10,046
Didn't you understand
that yet, Unni?

723
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:13,585
He is talking with some
hidden thoughts in his mind.

724
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:17,760
I am not the one who's talking <i>&</i> behaving
with hidden thoughts in mind, Shwetha.

725
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,027
It's you and him, right?

726
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:21,988
Or else,

727
00:55:23,023 --> 00:55:25,526
Royal Edinburgh Hospital's
CT Scan report,

728
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,806
wouldn't be tucked
under my air ticket,

729
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,810
to inform me that
you are pregnant.

730
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:36,335
Ichaya,

731
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:37,641
in this situation,

732
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,612
we were reluctant to tell you.

733
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:41,541
That's why..

734
00:55:41,942 --> 00:55:43,319
Until she died,

735
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:46,553
our mom hadn't known this;

736
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:48,448
Right?

737
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,018
Anyway»

738
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:55,824
there's no change in my decision that
I'm not going to leave Scotland soon.

739
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:58,424
Similarly,

740
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,565
in my decision that I'm
shifting from here tomorrow

741
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:16,746
I have always felt that,

742
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:20,025
it's not the beauty of England
<i>&</i> Ireland which are close by,

743
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,620
which this land has.

744
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,792
A kind of mystic beauty.

745
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:29,757
No wonder JK Rowling stayed here
and wrote the Harry Potter series.

746
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:32,871
Do you know the history of
the child missing cases

747
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,406
that have been reported here?

748
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,470
I don't know precisely.

749
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:37,897
Sun,

750
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:39,740
number of cases comparatively,

751
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,168
aren't any less.

752
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:57,118
It's because you were adamant.

753
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:00,096
It was really difficult
to get this place.

754
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:22,008
Hey!

755
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:23,543
Come in.

756
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:38,858
Hey!

757
00:57:41,228 --> 00:57:42,866
Don't you want to
go out from here?

758
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,000
This is for that.

759
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:00,813
And ya.

760
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:03,055
When I thought about it, I
think your route is correct.

761
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:05,620
First, we should know the history
of the child missing cases,

762
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,029
that have been reported here.

763
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:08,087
Yes.

764
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:09,122
How do we do that?

765
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:10,923
There's a way.

766
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,664
We have to contact the CPRC.

767
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:14,272
Child Protection
Research Centre.

768
00:58:14,495 --> 00:58:16,168
They will have the
full database.

769
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,010
Georgechayan, who
comes to our Church;

770
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:20,568
I've heard that his eldest son
is a research scholar at CPRC.

771
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:22,042
I don't know him directly.

772
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,479
He is a Protestant.

773
00:58:23,537 --> 00:58:26,040
So, he doesn't come
to our Church.

774
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:30,084
From 2012 till now,

775
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:33,919
in total, around 87 cases have
been reported in Scotland.

776
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:36,788
38 of them were from Edinburgh.

777
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,727
I'm talking of children
aged between 3 and 12.

778
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:44,162
And in that, 70% are girls.

779
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:48,165
What was the conclusion
of all these cases?

780
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:51,769
Don't be worried hearing
about the conclusions.

781
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
There is..

782
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:57,741
There is no conclusion
for around 46 cases.

783
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,172
Those children,

784
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,677
are still known as
the missing kids.

785
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,190
There are several
motives for such cases.

786
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,783
Organ trafficking,

787
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:07,847
paedophilia,

788
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:08,882
in house abuses,

789
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:09,949
and,

790
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:14,562
even Devil Satanic worshippers kidnap
children for their rituals here.

791
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:16,089
But.

792
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:18,830
Each motive will have a
different approach.

793
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:20,092
For example,

794
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:23,267
if the child is kidnapped
for organ trafficking;

795
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:24,836
Within 5-10 days,

796
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:28,107
the child's body would be
abandoned at some remote place.

797
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:30,077
In cases of paedophilia,

798
00:59:30,304 --> 00:59:33,877
that means, if the child was
kidnapped for sexual exploitation;

799
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:38,315
The chances for such groups to abandon
the child either dead or alive,

800
00:59:38,646 --> 00:59:39,646
are very less.

801
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:42,760
The case of these Black Mass people,

802
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:45,695
or Satan Devil Worshippers
is also similar.

803
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:47,253
But.

804
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:48,857
In the past 11 years,

805
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:51,199
only 3 such cases
have been reported.

806
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:53,804
And all three were
girls below 10 years of age.

807
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:55,802
That too, Jewish girls.

808
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:00,906
In the Bible, it is said that Jews
are the God's favourite people.

809
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:04,215
Their intention might be to harass
them to appease the Satan.

810
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:06,012
Madness!
What else can it be called!

811
01:00:06,674 --> 01:00:08,950
Since there is this
criteria about Jews,

812
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:10,747
that possibility;

813
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:12,323
That possibility alone,

814
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:14,859
can be ruled out at this stage.
Right?

815
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,897
This is the sixth day since
the incident happened, right?

816
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:20,961
In the current stage,

817
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:23,058
we cannot even take a guess.

818
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:27,135
I explained all this in detail because
none of you are the child's parent.

819
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:30,368
Or else, I don't explain
so much in detail usually.

820
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:39,748
The things Jason told us,
are just possibilities.

821
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,776
We just have to
see them as that.

822
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:44,754
Aren't we being led by
precise possibilities,

823
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,692
in this stage, Cyriac?

824
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:51,753
I am sure of one thing now.

825
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:55,661
However efficient the police
force here is supposed to be,

826
01:00:56,757 --> 01:00:58,202
they are never going to find

827
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,900
the people behind this crime.

828
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:04,433
Because they are
searching everywhere,

829
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:07,444
except the right place.

830
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:13,172
That means?

831
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:14,981
Does the police here know,

832
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:18,052
that Ila is not Unni and
Shwetha's daughter?

833
01:01:18,712 --> 01:01:19,712
Well,

834
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:21,820
what does that have
to do with this case?

835
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,990
Some time back,
didn't Jason say,

836
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:27,960
that we can rule out the possibility that
the child might be with Devil worshippers?

837
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:29,756
Because,

838
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:33,201
they want Jewish girls
below 10 years of age?

839
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:36,362
My daughter,

840
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:38,943
is half-Jewish, Cyriac.

841
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:43,075
Because her mother was a Jew.

842
01:01:43,437 --> 01:01:44,437
God!

843
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:47,743
If me, Unni or Shwetha,

844
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,846
don't share this information
to the investigation team;

845
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:52,482
Naturally,

846
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:55,490
they would also ignore this
possibility like Jason.

847
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,217
Right?

848
01:01:58,352 --> 01:01:59,990
To know what happened
to my daughter,

849
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:03,165
and who killed my mother,

850
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:07,736
Is it my need alone now, Cyriac?

851
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,233
Adam!

852
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:08,460
Unni,
- lchaya,

853
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:11,063
Some time back, I got a
call from Scotland Police.

854
01:03:11,558 --> 01:03:14,061
Saying that they found
the car that took Ila in,

855
01:03:14,128 --> 01:03:16,165
in an abandoned state at
a place called Carley.

856
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,000
Where is this place?

857
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:20,769
It's a county.
Two hours drive from here.

858
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:22,380
We are on the way there.

859
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,110
If you want to come,

860
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:25,377
I'll text the post code now.

861
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:27,284
Ya. Send the post code.

862
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:28,786
I'll start rig ht away.

863
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:40,343
You get into the car,

864
01:05:40,707 --> 01:05:41,913
and be with her.

865
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,305
What did they say?

866
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:10,610
Well, they just shared a
wild guess of theirs.

867
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:12,105
What?

868
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:13,344
Beyond these woods,

869
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:14,977
there is a marshy area.

870
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:17,149
Since the car was
abandoned here,

871
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:18,349
they have a doubt.

872
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:19,479
Police, right?

873
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,590
Anyway, they are going
to search that area.

874
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:25,029
To see if they can get the body?

875
01:06:25,586 --> 01:06:27,190
Don't take it in that sense.

876
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:29,732
Didn't I tell you?
Awild guess! That's all!

877
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:00,353
Over here!

878
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:45,732
Cyriac,

879
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:48,477
I can't stay here anymore.

880
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:51,271
I'm leaving.

881
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:53,606
Tell Unni.

882
01:07:55,175 --> 01:07:56,175
If anything com es up,

883
01:07:57,511 --> 01:07:58,511
just call me.

884
01:08:43,857 --> 01:08:44,857
Cyriac?

885
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:45,892
Hey.

886
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:49,598
The blood stains
found on the cloth,

887
01:08:49,663 --> 01:08:50,767
are B Positive.

888
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:53,107
That means,

889
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:55,104
lla's same blood group.

890
01:08:55,336 --> 01:08:56,336
So,

891
01:08:57,604 --> 01:08:59,242
if you hear anything terrible,

892
01:08:59,373 --> 01:09:01,410
pm:
m.

893
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,960
Hey!

894
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Stop!

895
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:48,408
What the..

896
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:49,881
What's your problem, man?

897
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:56,659
What?

898
01:11:56,784 --> 01:11:58,092
What do you think you're doing?

899
01:11:58,419 --> 01:11:59,420
The little girl,

900
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:00,687
at the bar!

901
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:02,388
I thought"

902
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:08,528
Do you..

903
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:09,629
Ila.

904
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:10,698
Do you knowlla?

905
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,042
Ila? Who's that?

906
01:12:14,468 --> 01:12:16,778
I have a friend.
Her name is Sandhya.

907
01:12:20,774 --> 01:12:21,774
Hey!

908
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:23,581
Just go home, man!

909
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:28,715
I'm sorry.

910
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,562
I thought I saw someone else.

911
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:52,005
Cyriac?

912
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:52,915
Hey.

913
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,417
They stopped searching.

914
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,517
They couldn't find anything
as they suspected.

915
01:12:56,911 --> 01:12:58,982
They concluded that it
was done deliberately,

916
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,991
to misguide the investigation.

917
01:13:01,915 --> 01:13:03,417
What I mean to say is,

918
01:13:04,385 --> 01:13:05,420
don't lose hope.

919
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:17,630
Baby»

920
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:18,574
Mum my,

921
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:20,804
why does Sandhya
always sleep so much?

922
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:28,935
Coffee?

923
01:14:29,537 --> 01:14:30,537
No.

924
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:32,181
I was feeling restless at home.

925
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:35,610
Didn't I tell you that my
mom has come from Kerala?

926
01:14:36,076 --> 01:14:37,076
Yes.

927
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:38,478
What happened?

928
01:14:38,846 --> 01:14:41,156
Did mom <i>&</i> Neethu
have a fight again?

929
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:42,523
No. It's not that.

930
01:14:42,616 --> 01:14:43,788
This is about our issue.

931
01:14:43,851 --> 01:14:47,060
After coming here and hearing about the
tragedy that happened in your family,

932
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:48,899
mom was really adamant,

933
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,965
to meet Unni <i>&</i>
Shwetha immediately;

934
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:54,170
And to join them in their grief.

935
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:59,200
Since I know that my mom doesn't
know what to talk to whom;

936
01:14:59,533 --> 01:15:01,012
I didn't encourage that.

937
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:03,544
But when she kept forcing me,

938
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:06,481
yesterday evening, I
had to take mom there.

939
01:15:06,574 --> 01:15:07,609
It was from there,

940
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:09,279
that this restlessness
of mine began.

941
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:16,058
Who knows what fate the Lord has
decided for each one of us.

942
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,926
But this was way too cruel.

943
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:22,931
Keep praying hard to
God, my children.

944
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:33,612
Wait <i>&</i> watch, dear.

945
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:36,839
The b@$!, 6““', 6““'@s who did this
will never live happily.

946
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:40,278
The Lord will send a rain of
fire to shower upon their body.

947
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:41,574
Rain of fire!

948
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:47,526
Shwetha, I've brought food.

949
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:48,681
Have it, okay?

950
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:52,597
Unni, you must compel
her to eat food, okay?

951
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,224
When are you leaving, Daisy?
Tomorrow?

952
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:56,556
No. Day after.

953
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:58,229
Are you going to Kerala?

954
01:15:58,826 --> 01:15:59,827
Just for a week.

955
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:01,100
That too, me alone.

956
01:16:01,195 --> 01:16:02,640
A family function.

957
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,169
I tried my best to tell
them that I'm not coming.

958
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,007
But my parents didn't
allow me to stay back.

959
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,144
Who is this girl, Cyriac?

960
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,272
She works with Shwetha, aunty.
Daisy.

961
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:12,339
She stays close by.

962
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:15,117
I am his mother.

963
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:17,982
Where are you in Kerala?

964
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:20,086
You might not know if I say it.

965
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:22,149
It's a place called
Pennakkara, towards the South.

966
01:16:22,216 --> 01:16:23,216
Hey!

967
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,753
Why wouldn't I know Pennakkara?

968
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:27,761
My mother's house is
over there, dear.

969
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:29,732
Mekkattoor.
Have you heard about that place?

970
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:34,103
I have stayed there so many
times during my childhood.

971
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:36,367
You're from which
family over there?

972
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,008
I know almost all the
houses over there.

973
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:40,066
Which family?

974
01:16:40,234 --> 01:16:41,234
Well..

975
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:44,349
My house name is Kaliyanthala.

976
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,017
Kaliyanthala means..

977
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:50,687
Kaliyanthala East or West?

978
01:16:52,312 --> 01:16:53,312
East

979
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:54,414
That means..

980
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:56,260
The ones who feed
the Black Father?

981
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,693
Right?
- No.

982
01:16:57,785 --> 01:16:59,856
We don't feed any Black
or White Fathers.

983
01:17:00,254 --> 01:17:01,289
Shwetha, bye.

984
01:17:01,388 --> 01:17:02,388
Cyriac,

985
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:03,423
bye.

986
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:21,084
Mom, do you want a drink?

987
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:22,643
There's some good
beef fry as well.

988
01:17:22,743 --> 01:17:23,619
Cyriac,

989
01:17:23,744 --> 01:17:27,692
stop all this, call the kids and
Neethu and come sit here to pray.

990
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:30,892
Didn't you see the mishaps
happening in certain families?

991
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:35,798
That reminds me,

992
01:17:36,057 --> 01:17:38,230
I heard you provoking that
Daisy by saying something.

993
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,805
Asking about some Black
Father or White Father.

994
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:41,861
What was it?

995
01:17:41,895 --> 01:17:42,895
Oh! That?

996
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:45,234
Son, she is from
Kaliyanthala East.

997
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:46,801
The ones who feed
the Black Father.

998
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:47,867
That means?

999
01:17:47,902 --> 01:17:51,440
Well, they are actually a
well-known Christian family.

1000
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,247
For outsiders,

1001
01:17:53,307 --> 01:17:56,982
they seem like people who follow the
path of the Messiah and the Church.

1002
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:59,648
They come to the Church
every week without fail.

1003
01:17:59,713 --> 01:18:01,215
They will participate in everything.

1004
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:05,195
And they donate whatever the Church
or the clergy need, in plenty.

1005
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:07,798
But without anyone
else's knowledge,

1006
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:11,132
some secret things are performed
in their families, apparently.

1007
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:14,770
Some rituals which go against the
Church and its laws.

1008
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,205
Some deity worships.

1009
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:19,678
These are all stories I've
heard from my elders.

1010
01:18:19,934 --> 01:18:21,277
Kaliyanthala East,

1011
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:22,438
<i>New Cherppafiu,</i>

1012
01:18:22,503 --> 01:18:23,503
Kunthakkalu..

1013
01:18:23,937 --> 01:18:25,848
There are some such families.

1014
01:18:26,173 --> 01:18:27,049
Anyway»

1015
01:18:27,174 --> 01:18:30,951
our people don't marry girls from these
houses and bring them to our family;

1016
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:33,048
And vice versa.

1017
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:36,090
It was from these myths
that my mom told me,

1018
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,957
that doubts came up in my mind;

1019
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:39,122
And I became restless.

1020
01:18:39,753 --> 01:18:42,073
So to find out the authenticity
of these tales told by mom,

1021
01:18:42,256 --> 01:18:43,758
I searched the internet.

1022
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:46,097
Even though I didn't get a
lot of detailed information,

1023
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,901
I found some indications
here and there.

1024
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:51,200
These allegations are about some
40 families scattered between,

1025
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:53,403
Thevalakkara, Udayamperoor
<i>&</i> Kunnamkulam.

1026
01:18:53,968 --> 01:18:56,278
Even though they claim to be
people of the God publicly,

1027
01:18:56,937 --> 01:18:59,315
they prepare feasts for
some dark power secretly

1028
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:01,375
with alcohol, women
<i>&</i> gold, apparently.

1029
01:19:02,142 --> 01:19:04,349
The name of that ritual that
is said amongst themselves,

1030
01:19:04,945 --> 01:19:06,185
is 'Feeding the Black Father'.

1031
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:09,223
My thoughts went in a
different direction.

1032
01:19:09,817 --> 01:19:11,057
What mom told me,

1033
01:19:11,118 --> 01:19:13,120
and what you witnessed
at the pub on that day,

1034
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:16,095
and what Jason told us at CPRC;
If we add all this together;

1035
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,027
I suspect whether Daisy is a link to Ila.

1036
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:23,267
To suspect that, I have
another solid reason.

1037
01:19:23,564 --> 01:19:25,339
Just before Ila was kidnapped,

1038
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:27,401
an incident that happened
in front of the Church.

1039
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,215
'At Garden Centre'

1040
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:37,183
Couldn't that be the full form of
the text that Daisy was typing?

1041
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:38,311
That means,

1042
01:19:38,813 --> 01:19:41,487
the hypermarket that Unni <i>&</i>
family went to, from the Church.

1043
01:19:42,316 --> 01:19:43,920
The place where the
incident occurred.

1044
01:19:44,552 --> 01:19:45,552
Well,

1045
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,921
these are just my speculations.

1046
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:50,434
If you have such a doubt,

1047
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:52,862
shouldn't we clear it, Cyriac?

1048
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,460
Yes.

1049
01:19:54,495 --> 01:19:55,495
But how?

1050
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:57,503
She is all set to leave
to Kerala tomorrow

1051
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:14,519
Okay then.

1052
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:16,092
Should I wait till you check in?

1053
01:20:16,116 --> 01:20:17,993
No. You have duty, right?
Carry on, Philip.

1054
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:19,894
Okay then. Take care.
- Bye.

1055
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:37,403
Cyriac

1056
01:21:03,264 --> 01:21:04,584
What is it, Cyriac?
What happened?

1057
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:07,038
What do I say“
Looks like he is on strike!

1058
01:21:07,234 --> 01:21:08,542
I was trying to solve it.

1059
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:11,009
Dude, try starting the car.

1060
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:12,105
I can't do it again!

1061
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:13,880
We've been doing this
for an hour now.

1062
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:15,852
Call someone who knows
how to do this, Cyriac.

1063
01:21:15,976 --> 01:21:16,976
Dude, that.

1064
01:21:17,912 --> 01:21:20,518
Philip, is there water in your car?
I'm really thirsty.

1065
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:21,651
Ya. I'll go get it.

1066
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:23,486
No.
I'll get the water.

1067
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,461
Try starting the car
for him if you can.

1068
01:21:25,519 --> 01:21:26,554
It's taking so long!

1069
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,258
It's on the drivers' door pad.
- Okay.

1070
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:46,939
Cyriac

1071
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:48,044
Shall I start it?

1072
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:49,108
Just a minute.

1073
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:52,579
Ya.

1074
01:21:52,613 --> 01:21:53,613
Just try once.

1075
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:00,653
See!

1076
01:22:00,688 --> 01:22:02,690
It became okay when the
right person did it.

1077
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:04,458
How did you do that?

1078
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:05,968
Thanks Philip.

1079
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,232
You carry on then.
Or you'll miss your duty.

1080
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:10,000
That's true.
I'm already late.

1081
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:11,642
Okay then. Bye.
- Bye.

1082
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,378
That mobile phone jammer
will be effective,

1083
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:22,614
only within a 30 metre
radius of the car.

1084
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:25,353
So before he reaches the office;

1085
01:22:26,513 --> 01:22:28,390
We have to execute our plan.

1086
01:22:28,616 --> 01:22:29,616
Yo u g o fast.

1087
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,088
I'll take care of the rest.

1088
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:52,582
If you go straight on this road,
there will be an exit to B-road;

1089
01:22:52,606 --> 01:22:53,482
It's a longer route.

1090
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:55,143
But there are no speed cameras.

1091
01:23:15,195 --> 01:23:16,538
Hello!
- Hello Daisy!

1092
01:23:16,664 --> 01:23:17,699
It's me, Cyriac.

1093
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:18,798
Oh! Cyriac!

1094
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:21,238
I've been trying to
call you for some time.

1095
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:23,312
IE a

1096
01:23:23,537 --> 01:23:25,744
lam at the airport, about
to leave to Kerala.

1097
01:23:25,806 --> 01:23:29,379
Sometime back, I was at the security check.
Maybe that's why the call didn't connect.

1098
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:30,615
What is it, Cyriac?

1099
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:31,678
Daisy,

1100
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,123
there's nothing to worry.

1101
01:23:33,447 --> 01:23:35,484
Near the round about
at Cooper road,

1102
01:23:35,683 --> 01:23:36,753
Philip had an accident.

1103
01:23:38,252 --> 01:23:39,128
And?

1104
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:41,233
He crashed into a
Polish guy's car.

1105
01:23:41,388 --> 01:23:43,732
Luckily, me and Adam
were passing that way.

1106
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:46,468
Now he is being taken to the
hospital in an ambulance.

1107
01:23:46,694 --> 01:23:48,674
Don't worry.
Lam following them.

1108
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:52,703
I saw an airport entry pass that was taken
half an hour back, in Philip's car.

1109
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:55,747
That's how we understood that he was
on the way back after dropping you.

1110
01:23:55,836 --> 01:23:58,339
So, when we couldn't get
through to you on the phone,

1111
01:23:58,405 --> 01:24:00,078
I sent Adam to the airport.

1112
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,612
I..
What do I..

1113
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,015
What should I do now, Cyriac?

1114
01:24:05,612 --> 01:24:06,716
Where should I come?

1115
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,521
If it is a journey
that can be avoided,

1116
01:24:08,582 --> 01:24:11,188
cancel it and go outside the
airport as soon as possible.

1117
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:13,192
By then, Adam would reach there.

1118
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:15,666
I'll call him and tell him
the rest of the details.

1119
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:17,190
Okay.

1120
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:26,638
Daisy, come!

1121
01:24:26,701 --> 01:24:27,701
Get in fast!

1122
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:05,748
We know yours and your entire
family's complete history, Daisy.

1123
01:25:07,341 --> 01:25:09,184
Sol suggest let's
cut to the chase.

1124
01:25:09,844 --> 01:25:10,844
Adam,

1125
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:12,479
I told you!

1126
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,619
I don't know anything
about lla's kidnapping!

1127
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:19,696
Someone has misled you.

1128
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:23,335
Do you think we would
bring you here,

1129
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:26,105
based on just
guesses and doubts?

1130
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:28,161
And,

1131
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:30,473
you can either answer
our questions;

1132
01:25:30,864 --> 01:25:31,864
Or not.

1133
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:33,601
That's up to you.

1134
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:39,275
But that will be only till 10 AM Indian
Standard Time, tomorrow morning.

1135
01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:40,874
By then,

1136
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:44,415
your dear ones would know that
you haven't reached Kerala;

1137
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:46,214
And that you're missing.

1138
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,680
And you will never,

1139
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:50,222
see Philip and your
kids after that.

1140
01:25:51,252 --> 01:25:52,253
That's for sure.

1141
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:57,359
The frustration that I have been
experiencing for the past seven years;

1142
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:01,363
I will fulfil that, whatever
the consequences may be.

1143
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:16,345
Don't consider what he said
as just a threat, Daisy.

1144
01:26:17,611 --> 01:26:18,851
He is on fire.

1145
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:20,680
So,

1146
01:26:20,981 --> 01:26:22,654
say whatever you know.

1147
01:26:23,384 --> 01:26:24,384
Please.

1148
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:27,353
Like he said,

1149
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:29,563
until 10 AM tomorrow morning,

1150
01:26:30,324 --> 01:26:31,530
we won't come here.

1151
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,306
Within that, if you
have a change of heart,

1152
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:36,706
there.

1153
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,332
Just press that switch.

1154
01:28:38,052 --> 01:28:39,793
Between people who
work together,

1155
01:28:40,754 --> 01:28:43,701
ego and other such
conflicts are common.

1156
01:28:46,627 --> 01:28:48,470
But, between me and Shwetha;

1157
01:28:48,796 --> 01:28:50,833
Nothing of that son
has ever happened.

1158
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,444
She was like my own
younger sister.

1159
01:29:01,408 --> 01:29:02,682
In qualifications,

1160
01:29:03,377 --> 01:29:04,856
and academic brilliance,

1161
01:29:06,347 --> 01:29:08,827
I was nowhere near Shwetha.

1162
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:11,017
But.

1163
01:29:12,586 --> 01:29:14,532
When it came to achievements;

1164
01:29:14,655 --> 01:29:16,965
The opposite would
happen always.

1165
01:29:17,858 --> 01:29:20,805
And as we close in on the last
few sessions of this semester;

1166
01:29:20,961 --> 01:29:24,465
It's time to announce the scholarship
stipend awardee for the next two.

1167
01:29:24,999 --> 01:29:27,809
Based on the overall performance
of the current academic year,

1168
01:29:28,602 --> 01:29:29,740
once again ladies;

1169
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:31,783
It's Miss Daisy Philip Kuruvilla.

1170
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:36,643
Thank you.

1171
01:29:38,112 --> 01:29:39,112
Thank you.

1172
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:40,713
Thanks.

1173
01:29:43,384 --> 01:29:44,384
Cong rats.

1174
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:56,529
Shwetha,

1175
01:29:57,131 --> 01:29:58,131
I know;

1176
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:00,503
Based on the performance;

1177
01:30:00,801 --> 01:30:02,576
You are the one who
deserves this.

1178
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:03,970
But.

1179
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:06,017
It's pointless to think
about all that, Daisy.

1180
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:08,417
But to be honest,

1181
01:30:08,676 --> 01:30:10,815
I had really wished
for this stipend.

1182
01:30:11,545 --> 01:30:12,751
Not because of anything else;

1183
01:30:13,113 --> 01:30:14,615
Unni has lost his job.

1184
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:15,749
You know rig ht?

1185
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,461
So in this situation,

1186
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:19,495
this would have been a
huge relief for us.

1187
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:21,494
You are really fortunate, Daisy.

1188
01:30:21,822 --> 01:30:23,733
Whatever you wish
for, is coming true.

1189
01:30:25,593 --> 01:30:26,593
Shwetha,

1190
01:30:30,230 --> 01:30:31,230
Do you..

1191
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,908
Do you want that fortune?

1192
01:30:34,501 --> 01:30:35,501
What?

1193
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:41,611
Once you get that,

1194
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:43,478
you will also have
only benefits.

1195
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:45,752
Whatever you wish
for, will happen.

1196
01:30:46,447 --> 01:30:47,447
Do you want it?

1197
01:30:47,648 --> 01:30:48,991
What are you saying, Daisy?

1198
01:30:49,616 --> 01:30:52,062
If you promise me that you
won't tell anyone else;

1199
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:53,931
I will take you to a place.

1200
01:31:27,254 --> 01:31:28,254
Com e.

1201
01:31:57,518 --> 01:31:58,518
Daisy!

1202
01:31:59,787 --> 01:32:00,857
Shall we go back?

1203
01:32:01,855 --> 01:32:03,198
I don't feel good.

1204
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:05,503
Why are you scared?

1205
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:08,606
This is just like going
to our usual Church. Come!

1206
01:32:24,578 --> 01:32:25,578
Com e.

1207
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:26,817
We have to change.

1208
01:32:50,638 --> 01:32:52,311
Now you look like one of us.

1209
01:33:31,212 --> 01:33:34,785
Open wide the gates of hell,
and come forth from the Abyss.

1210
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:37,623
To greet us as your
siblings and friends.

1211
01:33:39,086 --> 01:33:40,861
What the hell is this, Daisy?

1212
01:33:42,223 --> 01:33:43,223
Sad!

1213
01:33:44,225 --> 01:33:45,670
Stop mocking me;

1214
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:47,405
And ask what you want.

1215
01:33:49,063 --> 01:33:50,974
You're not begging or requesting;

1216
01:33:51,932 --> 01:33:52,932
Ask him,

1217
01:33:53,267 --> 01:33:55,076
And he will give it to you!

1218
01:33:56,737 --> 01:33:59,240
Come forth and answer
to your names;

1219
01:33:59,773 --> 01:34:01,650
By manifesting our desires..

1220
01:34:17,258 --> 01:34:18,737
Now pray to Him!

1221
01:34:19,727 --> 01:34:21,365
And ask him for your needs!

1222
01:34:30,471 --> 01:34:32,280
Isn't that Professor Edward?

1223
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:35,743
He is our High Priest.

1224
01:34:41,115 --> 01:34:44,927
Most of the people gathered here are people
who enjoy a high profile in society.

1225
01:34:45,786 --> 01:34:47,459
Just that no one else
would know about it.

1226
01:35:01,268 --> 01:35:02,804
So you're saying that,

1227
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:06,081
I'll get whatever I
ask over here, right?

1228
01:35:07,241 --> 01:35:08,241
Definitely!

1229
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:12,889
I want a baby.

1230
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:16,690
A baby whom I will
give birth to.

1231
01:35:17,851 --> 01:35:18,851
Ask!

1232
01:35:19,253 --> 01:35:20,254
You will get it.

1233
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:25,827
Since she was sure that it
will never be possible,

1234
01:35:26,527 --> 01:35:29,133
and because of her interest to
prove our beliefs to be wrong;

1235
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:31,771
Shwetha asked for
it on that day.

1236
01:35:32,867 --> 01:35:34,813
But during the journey
back from there,

1237
01:35:35,202 --> 01:35:36,875
she got really angry at me.

1238
01:35:38,806 --> 01:35:43,255
She warned me not to call
her for such crazy stuff.

1239
01:35:44,178 --> 01:35:46,419
I kept going for the
worship without fail.

1240
01:35:47,214 --> 01:35:50,218
But even though Professor
Edward forced me several times;

1241
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:53,057
I didn't have the courage
to call Shwetha again.

1242
01:35:53,787 --> 01:35:54,787
And then,

1243
01:35:55,055 --> 01:35:57,160
after 5-6 months;

1244
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,960
Shocking me,

1245
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,035
Shwetha fell unconscious
at the University Library;

1246
01:36:03,197 --> 01:36:05,336
And later realized
that she was pregnant.

1247
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,977
That was a ray of hope for me.

1248
01:36:09,503 --> 01:36:13,315
Saying that she should go there and thank
them directly for the gift she received,

1249
01:36:13,841 --> 01:36:15,752
or else, it will
be a big problem;

1250
01:36:16,343 --> 01:36:18,755
I compelled her and
took her there again.

1251
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:20,783
Hearing the news,
Professor Edward;

1252
01:36:21,482 --> 01:36:24,053
Put forth a strange
condition to Shwetha.

1253
01:36:25,186 --> 01:36:27,962
That she should surrender the child
to them, as soon as she is born.

1254
01:36:28,456 --> 01:36:31,994
And when they said that the child should
be baptized according to their beliefs,

1255
01:36:32,226 --> 01:36:34,934
naturally, Shwetha
couldn't accept that.

1256
01:36:35,829 --> 01:36:37,467
She said that it is impossible.

1257
01:36:38,165 --> 01:36:41,009
Saying that the punishment would
be severe if she disobeys them,

1258
01:36:41,135 --> 01:36:42,273
he threatened her.

1259
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:45,551
Seeing that things
were getting worse,

1260
01:36:46,173 --> 01:36:47,982
I talked to the
Professor directly.

1261
01:36:49,076 --> 01:36:50,885
But even then, the things he said;

1262
01:36:51,245 --> 01:36:52,883
Weren't pleasant at all.

1263
01:36:59,854 --> 01:37:00,992
What is it, Daisy?

1264
01:37:01,288 --> 01:37:02,596
What did he tell you?

1265
01:37:03,257 --> 01:37:04,565
I'll tell you.
Get in.

1266
01:37:04,925 --> 01:37:07,030
I came here today just
because you compelled me to.

1267
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,934
These people cannot create
anything in this world, Daisy.

1268
01:37:10,197 --> 01:37:11,232
They can only destroy.

1269
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:12,841
Understand that first.

1270
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,111
Apart from the fact that there
are some complications,

1271
01:37:15,135 --> 01:37:18,344
the doctors who treat us have never
said that we won't have kids.

1272
01:37:18,839 --> 01:37:20,147
Then how can they claim,

1273
01:37:20,207 --> 01:37:22,983
that I became pregnant now because
I came here 5 months back?

1274
01:37:23,877 --> 01:37:24,947
Don't you see it?

1275
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:26,346
It's a trap!

1276
01:37:26,613 --> 01:37:28,422
Shwetha, even I
agree to all this.

1277
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:32,029
But isn't it better if we
handle it more diplomatically?

1278
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:34,930
Anyway, when I talked
to the Professor,

1279
01:37:34,989 --> 01:37:36,525
he gave me an option.

1280
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:39,195
You can raise your own
child as you please.

1281
01:37:39,493 --> 01:37:40,836
They won't interfere in that.

1282
01:37:41,662 --> 01:37:42,662
But.

1283
01:37:44,098 --> 01:37:45,509
They would take Ila instead.

1284
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,333
Ila?

1285
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:48,410
For what?

1286
01:37:48,536 --> 01:37:51,881
For a ritual that is supposed to be
performed on a special day that's coming,

1287
01:37:52,506 --> 01:37:55,316
they need a Jew girl
below 10 years of age.

1288
01:37:56,477 --> 01:37:59,981
Apparently, in a casual conversation some
time, I had mentioned to the Professor;

1289
01:38:00,514 --> 01:38:02,255
That Ila is half Jewish.

1290
01:38:02,650 --> 01:38:03,650
So?

1291
01:38:04,385 --> 01:38:05,989
What all are you saying, Daisy?

1292
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:07,054
Shwetha,

1293
01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:09,897
maybe they need Ila
for very few days.

1294
01:38:10,391 --> 01:38:12,337
After that, we would
get her back.

1295
01:38:12,693 --> 01:38:14,229
The Professor has
promised me that.

1296
01:38:15,463 --> 01:38:17,238
You don't have to do
anything here, Shwetha.

1297
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:20,538
For the time being, act as if you
don't know anything about this.

1298
01:38:25,272 --> 01:38:26,272
Shwetha!

1299
01:38:28,142 --> 01:38:29,142
No.

1300
01:38:29,209 --> 01:38:30,210
You don't have to go.

1301
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:32,351
I will talk to him.

1302
01:38:33,314 --> 01:38:34,554
Even after I said so much,

1303
01:38:35,015 --> 01:38:36,323
Shwetha didn't agree.

1304
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,184
But.

1305
01:38:38,486 --> 01:38:41,092
They didn't need Shwetha's
consent to take Ila.

1306
01:38:43,024 --> 01:38:44,984
After seeing that incident
happen in front of her,

1307
01:38:45,126 --> 01:38:46,503
she got really scared.

1308
01:38:47,394 --> 01:38:49,271
She got scared that if
she says this to anyone,

1309
01:38:49,363 --> 01:38:53,539
lla's life and the child in
her womb will be in danger;

1310
01:38:53,968 --> 01:38:56,073
And that's why she didn't
say anything to anyone yet.

1311
01:38:57,538 --> 01:38:58,538
That means..

1312
01:38:58,706 --> 01:39:00,344
Shwetha is still expecting,

1313
01:39:01,008 --> 01:39:02,487
that she would get
Ila back alive.

1314
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:03,943
Right?

1315
01:39:07,248 --> 01:39:08,318
What about you, Daisy?

1316
01:39:12,086 --> 01:39:13,086
Daisy, rig ht now,

1317
01:39:13,354 --> 01:39:14,354
at this moment,

1318
01:39:14,655 --> 01:39:16,566
is my daughter dead or alive?

1319
01:39:18,259 --> 01:39:19,431
I don't know, Adam!

1320
01:39:21,495 --> 01:39:22,495
I swear!

1321
01:39:22,563 --> 01:39:23,563
I don't know.

1322
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:27,374
Which is that special day,

1323
01:39:27,768 --> 01:39:30,146
What are they going to
do to Ila on that day,

1324
01:39:30,471 --> 01:39:32,246
I don't know anything!

1325
01:39:39,046 --> 01:39:40,116
As far as I know,

1326
01:39:40,514 --> 01:39:42,960
there are around 12
Satan worship centers,

1327
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:44,456
in all of Scotland.

1328
01:39:45,386 --> 01:39:48,424
Only the Priests of those places
would participate in such functions.

1329
01:39:50,357 --> 01:39:52,268
Only they would know
the details about it.

1330
01:39:55,095 --> 01:39:58,542
Why did the Professor say that they
wanted Shwetha's soon-to-be-born child?

1331
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:00,333
He was lying.

1332
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:04,379
Ila was their target
from the very beginning.

1333
01:40:06,407 --> 01:40:10,583
Professor forced me several times
to bring Shwetha for the worship,

1334
01:40:11,512 --> 01:40:12,718
to get Ila.

1335
01:40:14,015 --> 01:40:15,655
Didn't you understand
the reason for that?

1336
01:40:16,117 --> 01:40:18,495
For them, Ila is the most
safest victim they can get.

1337
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:20,995
Instead if they kidnap
another Jewish girl,

1338
01:40:21,055 --> 01:40:22,659
based on the previous history,

1339
01:40:22,723 --> 01:40:25,033
the police investigation would
naturally lead to them.

1340
01:40:25,092 --> 01:40:26,770
In this case, Shwetha
would never say anything

1341
01:40:26,794 --> 01:40:29,570
about lla's Jewish background
to the police, out of fear.

1342
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:32,810
Giving some other reason, she wouldn't
let Unni say anything either.

1343
01:40:33,634 --> 01:40:35,409
Anyway, let's not wait any longer.

1344
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:37,181
Let's inform this to the Police.

1345
01:40:37,237 --> 01:40:38,517
They will take care of the rest.

1346
01:40:40,341 --> 01:40:41,341
We will inform.

1347
01:40:42,476 --> 01:40:43,511
But before that,

1348
01:40:45,246 --> 01:40:46,350
I want to meet someone.

1349
01:40:48,249 --> 01:40:49,249
Just,

1350
01:40:49,717 --> 01:40:50,717
I have to meet.

1351
01:41:09,537 --> 01:41:10,607
Didn't you leave?

1352
01:41:11,572 --> 01:41:13,051
I called you so many times!

1353
01:41:13,107 --> 01:41:14,450
Why didn't you
pick up the phone?

1354
01:41:20,481 --> 01:41:21,761
Daisy, why are you looking sick?

1355
01:41:24,284 --> 01:41:25,592
What happened to Ila?

1356
01:41:28,322 --> 01:41:30,495
Say something! Please!

1357
01:41:55,382 --> 01:41:56,793
I never thought,

1358
01:41:57,718 --> 01:41:59,254
all this would happen.

1359
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:06,527
I'll confess everything,
wherever you want me to.

1360
01:42:10,464 --> 01:42:11,464
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

1361
01:42:13,701 --> 01:42:17,205
So don't you want
your child, Shwetha?

1362
01:42:18,739 --> 01:42:22,152
Your own child whom you're
going to give birth to?

1363
01:42:24,545 --> 01:42:27,219
If you are involved in such a
crime directly or indirectly,

1364
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:30,588
do you know what punishment
you would be getting here?

1365
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:34,626
The law of this land wouldn't
even give you

1366
01:42:36,423 --> 01:42:38,460
the consideration that you
are pregnant, Shwetha.

1367
01:42:46,867 --> 01:42:48,437
Should yours <i>&</i> Unni's child,

1368
01:42:49,737 --> 01:42:52,149
be born in some jail here?

1369
01:42:55,576 --> 01:42:56,748
And about lla..

1370
01:42:58,979 --> 01:43:01,619
I will go as far as
I can go, alone.

1371
01:43:03,584 --> 01:43:05,257
I will do whatever I can!

1372
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:09,230
Even after that, if I'm
not able to save her;

1373
01:43:10,624 --> 01:43:11,728
Be sure about one thing.

1374
01:43:13,427 --> 01:43:15,202
At least one second before her,

1375
01:43:16,697 --> 01:43:17,971
I will be dead!

1376
01:43:21,469 --> 01:43:23,779
For the grave sin of
abandoning her once;

1377
01:43:26,407 --> 01:43:28,887
This is the only way I can
make an atonement to my child.

1378
01:44:45,586 --> 01:44:52,663
'In the pain of candles burning
and exfoliating within'

1379
01:44:53,060 --> 01:45:00,274
'On a day when even the days are filled
with darkness, on the city roads'

1380
01:45:01,035 --> 01:45:07,042
'Am I flowing through
this way, as a shadow?'

1381
01:45:08,609 --> 01:45:13,581
'Where did you disappear, sending
me to the depths of sorrow?'

1382
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:22,494
'You came to me like a
shooting star, that day'

1383
01:45:23,824 --> 01:45:29,467
'I forgot to caress you slowly'

1384
01:45:31,432 --> 01:45:37,383
'Today, when you are in pain at
some faraway corner'

1385
01:45:39,106 --> 01:45:42,610
'I will come beside you'

1386
01:45:42,776 --> 01:45:47,816
'And give you wings to fly'

1387
01:45:54,087 --> 01:46:00,868
'lf I can float back some day
on a wave in the river of time'

1388
01:46:01,696 --> 01:46:08,580
'If I can enjoy those past moments
again, like I should have'

1389
01:46:09,703 --> 01:46:15,949
'What do I give in return?'

1390
01:46:17,111 --> 01:46:21,526
'Will you come beside me, again?'

1391
01:46:24,752 --> 01:46:31,567
'You came to me like a
shooting star, that day'

1392
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:37,500
'I forgot to caress you slowly'

1393
01:46:39,967 --> 01:46:46,612
'Today, when you are in pain at
some faraway corner'

1394
01:46:47,641 --> 01:46:50,713
'I will come beside you'

1395
01:46:51,145 --> 01:46:55,651
'And give you wings to fly'

1396
01:47:37,091 --> 01:47:44,509
'Even though we are apart, she is
somewhere away, being my only resort'

1397
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:49,476
'To caress me on my wounds'

1398
01:47:52,573 --> 01:47:59,616
'Her sweet voice is a memory that I
cherish every moment, every day'

1399
01:48:00,047 --> 01:48:06,157
'Whenever I become weak'

1400
01:48:07,688 --> 01:48:13,832
'You came to me like a
shooting star, that day'

1401
01:48:15,129 --> 01:48:20,602
'I forgot to caress you slowly'

1402
01:48:22,903 --> 01:48:30,014
'Today, when you are in pain at
some faraway corner'

1403
01:48:30,077 --> 01:48:33,615
'I will come beside you'

1404
01:48:34,281 --> 01:48:40,857
'And give you wings to fly'

1405
01:49:40,014 --> 01:49:41,152
You know who I am.

1406
01:49:41,815 --> 01:49:43,123
And you know what this is about.

1407
01:49:44,252 --> 01:49:45,252
Now drive!

1408
01:50:24,392 --> 01:50:27,134
I do not recollect having
asked you to stop, Edward!

1409
01:50:28,762 --> 01:50:30,242
You're not going to
pull that trigger.

1410
01:50:30,965 --> 01:50:32,706
I can see that on your face.

1411
01:50:33,267 --> 01:50:34,267
Two choices.

1412
01:50:34,935 --> 01:50:36,676
Either you get out of my car,

1413
01:50:37,037 --> 01:50:39,142
or I leave it with
you and walk home!

1414
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,600
Dude..

1415
01:53:21,535 --> 01:53:22,535
Look at this.

1416
01:53:23,504 --> 01:53:25,347
12 people in total,
including the Professor.

1417
01:53:25,806 --> 01:53:26,806
May be these are,

1418
01:53:27,608 --> 01:53:30,282
the priests of those 12 worship
centers Daisy told us about.

1419
01:53:33,147 --> 01:53:34,147
This man..

1420
01:53:36,383 --> 01:53:37,384
This is the man,

1421
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:39,354
whom I saw at the
pub on that day.

1422
01:53:55,502 --> 01:53:57,482
It's not like him to
miss a prayer meeting.

1423
01:53:58,872 --> 01:54:00,146
Do you want to try calling him?

1424
01:54:00,341 --> 01:54:01,341
I just did!

1425
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:02,945
Says it's switched off.

1426
01:54:03,377 --> 01:54:04,515
What do we do now?

1427
01:54:07,982 --> 01:54:09,962
I guess we'd just leave.

1428
01:54:20,962 --> 01:54:21,962
Who was it?

1429
01:54:22,062 --> 01:54:23,062
I don't know.

1430
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:25,867
It's dangerous to keep the
Professor in our custody for long.

1431
01:54:26,266 --> 01:54:28,109
If his people know
that he is missing;

1432
01:54:28,402 --> 01:54:29,881
That would affect lla's life.

1433
01:54:30,204 --> 01:54:31,204
Letting him go,

1434
01:54:31,472 --> 01:54:32,849
is even more dangerous, right?

1435
01:55:14,148 --> 01:55:15,388
Tell us who this is.

1436
01:55:15,583 --> 01:55:16,891
And you walk free.

1437
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:19,619
This guy-

1438
01:55:20,321 --> 01:55:21,321
We need a name.

1439
01:55:22,156 --> 01:55:23,362
I know who he is.

1440
01:55:24,558 --> 01:55:26,128
I know he is one of them.

1441
01:55:27,327 --> 01:55:29,307
But I'm not going to tell you.

1442
01:55:33,734 --> 01:55:34,734
Cyriac

1443
01:55:37,371 --> 01:55:38,371
He won't say.

1444
01:55:39,673 --> 01:55:42,051
Why would you tell us
anything, Edward Williams?

1445
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:44,183
Disciple of Darkness!

1446
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:47,250
The name is Lucifer!

1447
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:50,927
And for Him,

1448
01:55:51,185 --> 01:55:52,493
I remain silent,

1449
01:55:53,087 --> 01:55:54,087
till death!

1450
01:56:08,736 --> 01:56:10,340
Drink, Edward?

1451
01:56:13,073 --> 01:56:14,073
I owe you one.

1452
01:56:14,742 --> 01:56:16,050
For all that you've done.

1453
01:56:34,495 --> 01:56:35,565
What are you going to do?

1454
01:56:37,231 --> 01:56:38,742
Shouldn't he be taken
back to his house?

1455
01:56:38,766 --> 01:56:40,143
How can we do that?

1456
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:42,109
Won't he say all
this to his people?

1457
01:56:44,805 --> 01:56:45,805
He won't!

1458
01:56:57,218 --> 01:56:58,218
Cyriac

1459
01:56:59,687 --> 01:57:00,687
You needn't come.

1460
01:57:01,622 --> 01:57:02,657
I will go alone.

1461
01:57:03,123 --> 01:57:04,123
Dude!

1462
01:57:04,192 --> 01:57:06,365
This is a journey of someone
who has nothing to lose.

1463
01:57:07,661 --> 01:57:08,662
You are not like that.

1464
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:14,634
Be careful.

1465
02:01:13,374 --> 02:01:14,512
Cyriac..
- Well,

1466
02:01:14,742 --> 02:01:16,346
if you stay there for too long,

1467
02:01:16,643 --> 02:01:18,281
someone might find it
suspicious, right?

1468
02:01:18,512 --> 02:01:19,889
No one has any suspicion yet.

1469
02:01:20,748 --> 02:01:21,748
Accidental death.

1470
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,451
That's the finding.

1471
02:01:24,751 --> 02:01:26,253
For at least 4-5 days,

1472
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,658
it will remain so.

1473
02:01:28,889 --> 02:01:30,630
Any one of those 11 men;

1474
02:01:31,092 --> 02:01:32,594
Should definitely
come here, Cyriac.

1475
02:01:33,394 --> 02:01:35,340
I cannot afford this
being a dead end.

1476
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,080
Dude,

1477
02:02:27,448 --> 02:02:29,485
the information from that
book has been decoded.

1478
02:02:30,517 --> 02:02:32,462
An ancient language called
'Enochian' is used in it.

1479
02:02:32,486 --> 02:02:34,329
It is said to be as
old as our Sanskrit.

1480
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:39,071
The contents of that book would
not be of any relief to us.

1481
02:02:39,861 --> 02:02:42,467
Especially, the parts
about Human Sacrificing.

1482
02:02:43,464 --> 02:02:44,499
Christian Missionaries,

1483
02:02:44,899 --> 02:02:45,899
Priests,

1484
02:02:45,933 --> 02:02:47,640
Girls who were born
in the Jewish race;

1485
02:02:48,502 --> 02:02:50,743
They are the ones usually
chosen to be sacrificed.

1486
02:02:52,039 --> 02:02:54,485
This ritual must be conducted
at least once in 3 years.

1487
02:02:55,376 --> 02:02:57,136
They have some special
days for that as well.

1488
02:02:57,678 --> 02:02:58,918
According to their belief,

1489
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:02,953
on any day which is remembered for
Satan's failure against God;

1490
02:03:03,484 --> 02:03:05,589
They can do this
ritual to please him.

1491
02:03:05,887 --> 02:03:07,628
Christmas, 40th Friday,

1492
02:03:07,721 --> 02:03:09,064
Good Friday, Easter.

1493
02:03:09,156 --> 02:03:10,499
Or any such day.

1494
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:12,158
Unfortunately,

1495
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:14,003
the previous Friday,

1496
02:03:14,528 --> 02:03:15,529
was 40th Friday.

1497
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:20,199
No.

1498
02:03:20,934 --> 02:03:23,813
Let's believe that nothing unfortunate
would have happened on that day.

1499
02:03:24,438 --> 02:03:25,438
But Adam..

1500
02:03:25,773 --> 02:03:27,411
Day after tomorrow
is Maundy Thursday.

1501
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:29,588
And the next day is Good Friday.

1502
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:31,419
On Sunday, Easter.

1503
02:03:31,979 --> 02:03:32,979
So..

1504
02:03:33,414 --> 02:03:34,586
We are on the edge.

1505
02:03:44,124 --> 02:03:46,730
I will break into Professor
Edward's house once more today.

1506
02:03:47,528 --> 02:03:50,668
I would definitely find something from
there that would lead us fon/vard.

1507
02:03:51,698 --> 02:03:52,698
Someone's name;

1508
02:03:53,467 --> 02:03:54,467
Address;

1509
02:03:54,668 --> 02:03:55,703
Contact details;

1510
02:03:56,203 --> 02:03:57,511
Or something like that.

1511
02:03:58,205 --> 02:03:59,205
Dude,

1512
02:03:59,506 --> 02:04:00,586
do you have to do it today?

1513
02:04:00,808 --> 02:04:01,808
Isn't it risky?

1514
02:04:03,544 --> 02:04:05,217
What should I be
scared of now, Cyriac?

1515
02:04:06,447 --> 02:04:07,447
Like you said,

1516
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:09,484
we are already on the edge.

1517
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:53,399
Lucia!

1518
02:08:55,169 --> 02:08:56,169
Lucia!

1519
02:09:05,846 --> 02:09:06,846
Nathan!

1520
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,805
So have you been to Jaffna?

1521
02:09:21,862 --> 02:09:22,862
Where?

1522
02:09:22,997 --> 02:09:23,997
Sri Lanka.

1523
02:09:24,265 --> 02:09:25,300
Your dad's home.

1524
02:09:26,066 --> 02:09:27,066
Yes. Once.

1525
02:09:27,134 --> 02:09:29,740
To see my granny; But
she died soon after.

1526
02:09:42,983 --> 02:09:43,983
Who is this?

1527
02:09:44,485 --> 02:09:46,089
I think a Sri Lankan Tamilian,

1528
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:48,229
would understand a
little bit of Malayalam.

1529
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:51,491
What do you want?

1530
02:09:51,859 --> 02:09:53,429
What we both want now,

1531
02:09:53,594 --> 02:09:55,039
is the same thing, Nathen.

1532
02:09:55,362 --> 02:09:56,362
Our daughters.

1533
02:09:57,865 --> 02:09:59,003
You don't know me!

1534
02:09:59,433 --> 02:10:00,878
If something happens
to my child,

1535
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:02,575
I will go to any extent.

1536
02:10:03,104 --> 02:10:04,981
If something happens
to his own daughter,

1537
02:10:05,573 --> 02:10:06,573
any father;

1538
02:10:07,141 --> 02:10:08,279
Can go to any extent.

1539
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:11,316
I never thought,

1540
02:10:11,946 --> 02:10:13,289
I would be able to kill someone.

1541
02:10:14,615 --> 02:10:15,615
Sun,

1542
02:10:16,283 --> 02:10:17,557
Professor Edward died, right?

1543
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:21,158
Let's meet &talk.

1544
02:10:24,325 --> 02:10:26,032
Will you bring her too?

1545
02:10:26,427 --> 02:10:27,838
You know better than that!

1546
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:29,862
Your place.

1547
02:10:30,097 --> 02:10:31,097
In two hours.

1548
02:10:50,184 --> 02:10:51,184
Is she alive?

1549
02:10:54,455 --> 02:10:55,455
Nathen,

1550
02:10:55,856 --> 02:10:57,426
is my daughter alive,

1551
02:10:58,058 --> 02:10:59,058
or not?

1552
02:11:17,411 --> 02:11:18,411
Wait!

1553
02:11:19,614 --> 02:11:20,614
Wait!

1554
02:11:23,517 --> 02:11:24,517
She's alive!

1555
02:11:28,222 --> 02:11:29,222
She is alive!

1556
02:11:38,899 --> 02:11:40,469
I need to hear it from you, Nathen.

1557
02:11:42,970 --> 02:11:44,176
She is alive.

1558
02:11:45,305 --> 02:11:46,305
But.

1559
02:11:47,941 --> 02:11:49,215
For just two more days.

1560
02:11:53,447 --> 02:11:55,688
No one can save
your child, Adam.

1561
02:11:57,518 --> 02:11:59,020
Day after tomorrow
is Good Friday.

1562
02:12:00,921 --> 02:12:03,561
On that day, she will be
killed at the Altar of Satan.

1563
02:12:05,326 --> 02:12:07,704
This ritual is going to
happen after four years.

1564
02:12:09,530 --> 02:12:11,635
She will be brought
out only on that day.

1565
02:12:13,234 --> 02:12:14,235
You can't, Adam.

1566
02:12:15,436 --> 02:12:16,938
You can't do anything.

1567
02:12:18,573 --> 02:12:19,711
Are you going, Nathen?

1568
02:12:20,941 --> 02:12:21,976
For that ritual?

1569
02:12:22,743 --> 02:12:24,586
I am one among the
12 chief priests.

1570
02:12:26,046 --> 02:12:27,046
I must go!

1571
02:12:41,462 --> 02:12:42,532
I'm sorry, Julia.

1572
02:12:44,165 --> 02:12:46,475
No mother should go through
what you will, from today.

1573
02:12:55,509 --> 02:12:56,509
Adam!

1574
02:13:02,083 --> 02:13:03,391
Tell me where my daughter is;

1575
02:13:04,451 --> 02:13:06,158
You're not leaving
my house othen/vise.

1576
02:13:11,993 --> 02:13:13,233
Take a good look, Nathen.

1577
02:13:15,028 --> 02:13:16,473
Do you see fear on my face?

1578
02:13:18,766 --> 02:13:22,179
I haven't given her any
promise that I would go back.

1579
02:13:24,038 --> 02:13:25,176
Before coming here,

1580
02:13:25,806 --> 02:13:27,479
in the cellar that
she's held captive in;

1581
02:13:27,675 --> 02:13:28,710
I lit a bulb.

1582
02:13:30,177 --> 02:13:31,281
I bought a microwave oven,

1583
02:13:31,512 --> 02:13:32,684
and a refrigerator.

1584
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:34,518
Inside the fridge,

1585
02:13:35,016 --> 02:13:38,463
I stocked chicken pie, sandwiches
and milkshakes that she likes.

1586
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:42,232
I bought story books and drawing
books that she asked for.

1587
02:13:44,658 --> 02:13:46,069
But on the third day from today,

1588
02:13:47,161 --> 02:13:48,765
the food that I've
stocked will be over.

1589
02:13:50,164 --> 02:13:53,338
The battery to which the bulb, fridge and
oven are connected, would drain out.

1590
02:13:54,702 --> 02:13:56,704
So, if I don't go
back within 3 days;

1591
02:13:58,572 --> 02:14:00,609
The last thing you're
daughter is going to see;

1592
02:14:01,709 --> 02:14:03,086
Will be darkness.

1593
02:14:07,581 --> 02:14:08,581
My child..

1594
02:14:09,717 --> 02:14:11,025
What can I do?

1595
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:14,220
I am helpless!

1596
02:14:15,656 --> 02:14:16,656
I'm just...

1597
02:14:18,759 --> 02:14:20,102
one among the twelve.

1598
02:14:21,829 --> 02:14:23,308
One among the twelve.

1599
02:14:24,398 --> 02:14:28,107
You should take me to the place where
the ritual is going to happen, Nathen.

1600
02:14:30,671 --> 02:14:32,173
I want you to take me there.

1601
02:14:45,586 --> 02:14:47,259
I don't know what's
going to happen.

1602
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:51,200
Doctor Steve is the person
who has replaced Edward now.

1603
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:53,667
He is the High Priest now.

1604
02:14:54,595 --> 02:14:55,801
But he is not like Edward.

1605
02:14:57,197 --> 02:14:59,336
He will definitely sense
something is wrong.

1606
02:15:00,735 --> 02:15:02,180
Whatever you told them about me,

1607
02:15:02,736 --> 02:15:03,806
have they believed it?

1608
02:15:04,238 --> 02:15:05,238
I don't know.

1609
02:15:05,573 --> 02:15:06,711
You are my friend.

1610
02:15:07,441 --> 02:15:08,852
A priest who has come from Goa.

1611
02:15:09,643 --> 02:15:12,180
I told them that you've
come here from India,

1612
02:15:12,279 --> 02:15:14,350
hearing about this day.

1613
02:15:15,516 --> 02:15:16,516
He asked me to bring you.

1614
02:15:16,917 --> 02:15:18,419
But before he said that,

1615
02:15:18,719 --> 02:15:19,857
there was silence.

1616
02:15:23,123 --> 02:15:24,397
And Steve's silence,

1617
02:15:25,259 --> 02:15:26,259
is never good.

1618
02:15:28,162 --> 02:15:29,402
My wife's fate!

1619
02:15:30,397 --> 02:15:32,434
Me and her daughter
on the same day;

1620
02:15:33,601 --> 02:15:35,274
If something happens
to my child,

1621
02:15:36,203 --> 02:15:37,910
neither of us will
stay alive, Adam.

1622
02:15:38,572 --> 02:15:39,572
Neither of us!

1623
02:15:50,517 --> 02:15:51,928
Wait for me for one more day.

1624
02:15:54,155 --> 02:15:55,395
And if I don't come back,

1625
02:15:57,258 --> 02:15:58,430
take her back safely,

1626
02:15:58,793 --> 02:15:59,931
to this post code.

1627
02:16:02,563 --> 02:16:03,871
Taking another child's life,

1628
02:16:04,899 --> 02:16:06,401
cannot replace my daughter.

1629
02:16:58,452 --> 02:16:59,452
Steve,

1630
02:17:00,521 --> 02:17:02,330
he is Mr. George Augustine.
My friend.

1631
02:17:02,623 --> 02:17:03,795
I've spoken to you about him.

1632
02:17:06,394 --> 02:17:08,374
It's a privilege, Mr. George!

1633
02:17:09,263 --> 02:17:12,710
Suppose it's His will that you
bear witness to this evening.

1634
02:17:15,236 --> 02:17:16,681
Get him a robe, Nathen.

1635
02:17:16,971 --> 02:17:18,882
It's time to start proceedings.

1636
02:18:34,882 --> 02:18:35,882
Gentlemen,

1637
02:18:36,617 --> 02:18:37,617
fellow disciples,

1638
02:18:39,353 --> 02:18:41,765
Tonight we gather to
pledge our faith,

1639
02:18:42,523 --> 02:18:43,523
in blood!

1640
02:18:44,024 --> 02:18:46,903
Tonight, we gather
to forge our belief,

1641
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:48,665
in flesh!

1642
02:18:48,963 --> 02:18:52,035
Tonight, we gather
to show gratitude,

1643
02:18:52,667 --> 02:18:53,907
with life!

1644
02:18:56,137 --> 02:18:57,137
Bring her!

1645
02:19:57,798 --> 02:19:59,106
Mr. George,

1646
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:03,714
would you be so kind as to
help her on to the altar?

1647
02:20:57,991 --> 02:20:59,902
Now place your palm on mine.

1648
02:21:00,061 --> 02:21:02,063
And swear allegiance
to His blood,

1649
02:21:02,696 --> 02:21:04,232
with a drop of your own.

1650
02:21:57,651 --> 02:22:00,188
Either side of this knife,
bear the same blood.

1651
02:22:01,555 --> 02:22:02,625
Isn't that the truth?

1652
02:22:04,758 --> 02:22:06,499
Mr. Adam Joan!

1653
02:22:32,219 --> 02:22:33,219
Sorry.

1654
02:22:33,287 --> 02:22:34,287
Sorry, Steve.

1655
02:22:34,621 --> 02:22:35,691
He has my daughter.

1656
02:22:36,757 --> 02:22:38,202
I didn't have a choice.

1657
02:22:47,834 --> 02:22:48,834
I know.

1658
02:22:57,811 --> 02:22:58,811
Now,

1659
02:22:58,979 --> 02:23:01,186
tell me where you have
kept the little girl.

1660
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:04,188
And I promise you,

1661
02:23:04,918 --> 02:23:06,920
this one dies a quick death.

1662
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:11,064
Remain silent,

1663
02:23:12,125 --> 02:23:14,696
and she bleeds till dawn.

1664
02:23:27,174 --> 02:23:28,174
Wait!

1665
02:23:29,043 --> 02:23:30,043
Wait!

1666
02:23:35,649 --> 02:23:38,289
EH163JY

1667
02:23:39,353 --> 02:23:40,730
That's where she is.

1668
02:23:52,199 --> 02:23:53,199
Malcolm,

1669
02:24:13,854 --> 02:24:14,854
Steve,

1670
02:24:15,222 --> 02:24:16,222
she's not here.

1671
02:24:16,757 --> 02:24:17,757
Are you sure?

1672
02:24:17,858 --> 02:24:18,858
Yes.

1673
02:24:18,993 --> 02:24:20,199
There's no one in the house.

1674
02:24:32,273 --> 02:24:33,273
Nathen,

1675
02:24:34,875 --> 02:24:36,081
He's listening.

1676
02:24:41,181 --> 02:24:42,181
By dawn,

1677
02:24:42,749 --> 02:24:44,786
if my friend and
his little girl,

1678
02:24:44,918 --> 02:24:46,420
are not back home safe;

1679
02:24:46,887 --> 02:24:47,887
I promise you»

1680
02:24:48,956 --> 02:24:50,663
The next time you see Lucia,

1681
02:24:50,991 --> 02:24:52,470
you will be dressed in black!

1682
02:24:54,194 --> 02:24:55,194
Adam,

1683
02:24:55,729 --> 02:24:56,729
you should come back;

1684
02:24:57,698 --> 02:24:58,698
With her!

1685
02:25:30,197 --> 02:25:31,301
Sorry Nathen.

1686
02:25:32,199 --> 02:25:33,940
We cannot wait any longer.

1687
02:25:34,969 --> 02:25:36,744
It's time to start the prayers.

1688
02:25:39,273 --> 02:25:40,980
Steve!

1689
02:25:41,141 --> 02:25:42,141
No, Steve!

1690
02:25:42,309 --> 02:25:43,309
My daughter!

1691
02:25:43,410 --> 02:25:45,014
You have to do something!
Please!

1692
02:25:45,412 --> 02:25:46,412
Please, Steve!

1693
02:26:23,984 --> 02:26:24,984
No!

1694
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:31,098
I said, no deaths before
the holy sacrifice.

1695
02:28:10,124 --> 02:28:11,124
Go!

1696
02:28:11,191 --> 02:28:12,602
Go save your daughter!

1697
02:28:15,028 --> 02:28:16,166
And if you can,

1698
02:28:16,564 --> 02:28:17,668
my daughter too.

1699
02:31:54,148 --> 02:31:55,593
Don't die on me, Adam.

1700
02:31:56,183 --> 02:31:57,355
Not yet.

1701
02:31:58,251 --> 02:32:00,527
I want you to watch
me cut her open.

1702
02:34:21,729 --> 02:34:25,233
You should have known
I'd come for her.

1703
02:34:27,401 --> 02:34:30,007
I am her father!

1704
02:38:38,285 --> 02:38:39,285
Hi Ila!

1705
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:41,625
How are you?
- I'm fine, uncle.

1706
02:38:41,789 --> 02:38:43,166
Did you keep those
flowers there?

1707
02:38:43,690 --> 02:38:44,862
Yes uncle.

1708
02:38:45,059 --> 02:38:46,059
Smart girl!

1709
02:38:47,762 --> 02:38:48,762
Okay.

1710
02:38:55,535 --> 02:38:56,535
Ila»

1711
02:38:58,772 --> 02:39:00,046
Do you know who that is, dear?

1712
02:39:00,174 --> 02:39:01,174
I know!

1713
02:39:02,243 --> 02:39:03,654
My father's brother.

1714
02:39:03,944 --> 02:39:04,944
Elder brother.

1715
02:39:10,951 --> 02:39:11,951
Come, dear.

1716
02:39:15,055 --> 02:39:16,055
Let her grow up.

1717
02:39:16,957 --> 02:39:18,300
As mine and Unni's daughter.

1718
02:39:19,226 --> 02:39:20,296
In the future,

1719
02:39:20,761 --> 02:39:22,707
at an age when she can
understand everything;

1720
02:39:23,264 --> 02:39:24,800
I will tell her myself.

1721
02:39:25,733 --> 02:39:29,340
About her own father and mother who
sacrificed their lives for her.

1722
02:39:31,272 --> 02:39:33,309
For the sin that you left
her and went away once;

1723
02:39:34,141 --> 02:39:36,280
Even after you paid penance
with your own life;

1724
02:39:37,377 --> 02:39:38,377
Your daughter,

1725
02:39:38,712 --> 02:39:40,123
isn't recognizing you, Adam!

1726
02:39:41,849 --> 02:39:42,849
In the future,

1727
02:39:43,684 --> 02:39:44,992
she might discover the truth.

1728
02:39:45,919 --> 02:39:46,919
On that day,

1729
02:39:47,388 --> 02:39:49,231
with much more
beautiful flowers,

1730
02:39:50,223 --> 02:39:53,602
she will come here to see
her father <i>&</i> mother.

1731
