1
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:15,536
"Prince Charming...lover"

2
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:20,411
"Heart breaker"

3
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:26,226
"Skirt chaser"

4
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:36,181
"Smooth operator"

5
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:42,214
"Don Juan...lady killer"

6
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:15,327
"Rakish youngster"

7
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,393
"Casanova"

8
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:23,986
"Valeba Raja!"

9
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,644
But this is the truth

10
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:34,553
Dr Valeba Raja is India's #1 psychiatrist

11
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:37,112
To meet him...

12
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:41,650
...many VIPs, reporters
will come night and day

13
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:44,053
All of them have some
mental disorder or the other

14
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,424
He's expected here any minute

15
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,703
Take a look at
the fuss he'll make

16
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,691
He has a bad habit

17
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,260
Even though 20 to 30 patients
wait to consult him every day...

18
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:54,157
...he'll only see 1 patient

19
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:57,056
He'll even choose
the 'patient of the day'!

20
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,944
Wait and watch
Here he is

21
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:05,162
"Smooth operator"

22
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:09,884
"Heart breaker"

23
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:20,524
Why is this bouquet so heavy?

24
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,830
Doctor...baby!

25
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:24,350
If I give you a baby
before marriage...

26
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,624
...you should feel sad

27
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,764
Instead you're feeling shy

28
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:27,639
Give the baby back to her

29
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:28,557
Here

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,611
Sorry, doctor

31
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,794
Didn't I tell you?

32
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:31,649
Watch him now

33
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,611
Dr Valeba Raja, you are
#1 psychiatrist in our city

34
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:37,858
What do you attribute it to?

35
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:39,079
At such a young age...

36
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,662
...why do you have
wrinkles under your eyes?

37
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,020
Doctor, I'm only 24 years old

38
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,120
When I pointed out a tiny wrinkle...

39
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:46,682
...you got so flustered

40
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,186
This mental anxiety is
the reason for my demand

41
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:50,234
Move aside

42
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,210
Your face looks like the owner
of a beef shop in Burma bazaar

43
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:59,722
'How to the b to the c to'
the butler English reporter, huh?

44
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:03,340
Aren't you the compounder
of my rival Dr Rajagopalan?

45
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:05,712
Why did you come here
like a scent hound?

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,006
We don't get any patients there

47
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,651
I came to find out how
you attract so many patients!

48
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:11,095
You came in disguise

49
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,732
I believe he has come
to find out the details

50
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:14,899
Show him around

51
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:18,300
You have the gall to
come here and-

52
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:23,069
I haven't even started as yet

53
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:26,924
Good morning, doctor

54
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,362
Rajendra, can't see you at all

55
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,987
I'm right here, doctor

56
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,400
I meant your face!

57
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:36,826
I thought that was really funny

58
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:38,019
Why isn't he laughing?

59
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,764
Maybe you are really
stressed mentally

60
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:41,826
You are my 'patient of the day'

61
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,868
You look so serious like a
mannequin in a showroom

62
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:50,812
What is your name?

63
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,370
My name is Karthik, doctor

64
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:59,169
Mr Karthik, take a seat

65
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,294
A face that looks so bright
even without applying powder

66
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,942
With just this face
if you go to a pub...

67
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,900
...you can easily impress 10 girls

68
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:13,289
Instead of going there...

69
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,731
...why are you here
with this sad face?

70
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,137
Problems, doctor

71
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:17,731
Too many complications

72
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:20,418
Only you should erase
my memory completely

73
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:24,137
Is your brain a pen drive
to just plug in and erase?

74
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:26,437
First share your problem with me

75
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:32,656
Boss, give me a 'gulab jamun'?

76
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:34,656
No, 'rasagulla'

77
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:35,799
Gulab jamun

78
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,116
No, gulab jamun

79
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,232
I'll take a rasagulla instead

80
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,311
Get me 2 tickets for
the film 'Thalaiva'

81
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,070
No, for the film 'Aarambam'

82
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,183
Thalaiva

83
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:49,173
Aarambam

84
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:50,436
Which film do you want?

85
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,058
It's final...Thalaiva

86
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,197
No...Aarambam

87
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,755
'Adan goya sheeka makka!!'

88
00:04:57,786 --> 00:04:59,740
This is my problem, doctor

89
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,765
That or this...?

90
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,514
Should I go there or here?

91
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:09,631
You confuse yourself
as well as people around you...

92
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,413
...with your oscillating double mind

93
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:13,405
So how do I get out of this, doctor?

94
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,025
Before starting your treatment...

95
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,039
...please give me
your family background

96
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:19,203
Why, doctor?

97
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,115
To get new dresses for
your family for 'Deepavali'

98
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:24,544
Only if I know about your family
I can analyze you completely

99
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:28,163
My dad is very affectionate

100
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:29,304
A leading lawyer

101
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,935
His name is Ramachandran

102
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,206
Hey! Who is that?

103
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,725
Who is there...Muruga?

104
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,959
Which idiot left his slippers
in the middle of the hall?

105
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:45,222
Throw it out

106
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:45,870
Okay, sir

107
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,465
Remove it right now

108
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,819
Why are you screaming, grandpa?

109
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,714
Those are your slippers

110
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,562
It's okay...throw it out

111
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:58,715
Scared of my dad
is my innocent mom

112
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:05,130
(song from film 'Baashha')

113
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,776
That poor man is smiling
even after being beaten to a pulp

114
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:29,870
I can't bear to see him suffer

115
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:31,946
I feel sorry for him too

116
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:33,573
You shouldn't say this

117
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,548
You are a leading lawyer

118
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,988
I don't know what you'll do

119
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:43,396
But you must take legal action
against actor Anandraj and his gang

120
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,294
Promise me

121
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:56,049
If dad is olive, my mom will
become an olive oil factory

122
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,584
Then I have an elder sister

123
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,653
She has a very strange habit

124
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,342
If she gets upset, she'll start wiping
with whatever she lays her hands on

125
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:11,950
Recipe book...very important!

126
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:12,568
What?

127
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:13,842
How many times
have I told you...

128
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,936
...not to keep salt
next to the washing powder?

129
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:16,920
I made 'upma'

130
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:18,607
And it suddenly turned frothy!

131
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:23,179
Then you can annoy your 'akka' and
make her mop the floor on Fridays

132
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:27,075
You aren't the kind to laugh
even at a good joke

133
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,960
Wasting my wit on the wrong man!

134
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,427
He described my character
to you crystal clear, right?

135
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,694
Then why are you still staring?

136
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,425
Given a chance, I think
your sister will mop my face too!

137
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:40,301
Next...?

138
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:43,461
My sister's husband is Padmanaban

139
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,144
His dearest dream is to be
part of Chennai Super Kings

140
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:52,366
Is he game for wearing a mini skirt
and carrying pom poms?

141
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:54,264
Sir, he wants to play
the actual game

142
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:55,619
Oh...the cricket match

143
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:59,908
"Say it repeatedly
Speak, friend, proudly"

144
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:06,613
"May victory be ours
May defeat be theirs...yes"

145
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09,066
'All glories to cricket'

146
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,043
Once my bro-in-law
played in a match

147
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:12,680
They asked him to take a run

148
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,464
I told them Lingusamy has
directed the film 'Run' already

149
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:15,668
They dropped me

150
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,955
This is how my uncle Padhu-

151
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,328
I can't take it

152
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,845
More you keep talking about
your bro-in-law...

153
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,335
...I get a bad vibration

154
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:23,720
Please don't share anything
about him with me

155
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,955
Are there any brats at home?

156
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:27,360
Yes, doctor

157
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,377
My akka's daughter Mithra

158
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,062
What's 2+2?

159
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:33,955
2

160
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,024
Then 1+1=?

161
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:35,948
- Siiiix!
- Quiet

162
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:36,740
1 + 1?

163
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,528
One

164
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:38,440
Don't color now

165
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:39,963
Do your sums first

166
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,600
If you fail in Math this time...

167
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:44,127
...I'll definitely send you
to a boarding school

168
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,248
This is my awesome family, doctor

169
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,607
Did you tell me about your family?

170
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:53,227
Or the comic characters
by Khushwant Singh?

171
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,772
Each is a nut case
in his or her own right

172
00:08:55,878 --> 00:09:00,037
So your family members are not
the cause for your mental stress

173
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:02,724
You seem to be suffering
from some other problem

174
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,045
What is that?

175
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,140
As if I asked you to lend me
your bike to go to the market...

176
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,734
...you are giving me
this blank stare?

177
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:13,038
Only if you share your problems...

178
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,948
...I can come up with a solution

179
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,185
Love...love, doctor

180
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,016
All the problems in my life...

181
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,490
...only because of love!

182
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,292
'The love doctor...the love doctor...'

183
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,137
Why are you talking with
a DTS effect all of a sudden?

184
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,086
First tell me about that girl

185
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:30,237
'She's a fashion designer, doctor'

186
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,512
'Daily in the morning
I'll go to her office!'

187
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,033
'I'll attend all my meetings
only from her office'

188
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:36,044
'Yes, doctor'

189
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:39,052
'Time will just fly
Sometimes I'll get tired'

190
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,238
'But I love waiting'

191
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:44,807
'She's personification
of beauty, doctor'

192
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,692
'I want to know
about your girl'

193
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:48,957
'You're rolling over
and twisting your body'

194
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:50,326
Tell me about that girl

195
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,737
She's a financier's daughter

196
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,093
North Indian girl, huh?

197
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,249
I'm sure she will glow
like a well-mopped marble floor

198
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,814
You know where I saw her
for the first time

199
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,502
You wouldn't have
seen her face for sure!

200
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,494
It's okay, go ahead

201
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:09,143
I saw her in Ooty
when I was jogging

202
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,048
6:30 a.m

203
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,046
Don't confuse me
by going around me

204
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:07,225
If I get confused and hit you
because of tension...

205
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:09,772
...it will hurt until
you get your pension

206
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,714
Doctor...doctor...?

207
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,798
If you lie, you won't get 'bonda'

208
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:18,626
Tell me the truth,I'll get you hot 'vada'

209
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,072
They beat me to a pulp, doctor

210
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,659
I know you by now

211
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:24,983
Why are you over acting?

212
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:26,674
Bro, I didn't do anything

213
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:28,552
I'm the only son to my parents

214
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:30,441
Please, bro
Don't hurt me

215
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,300
Leave me alone

216
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:57,394
There's no safety in our country

217
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,064
Scumbags!
Let go off me

218
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,463
Sorry, I won't come up
with any punch lines, bro

219
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:02,883
Who the hell is she?

220
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:07,979
How weird is this!

221
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:14,196
Run...run

222
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,883
Thank you, dear Lord

223
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,525
You look like a decent fellow

224
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,604
Why are you loitering around
at this time all by yourself?

225
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,668
Your age is the reason

226
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,343
Your parents should be reprimanded

227
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,817
Anyway, I must go to work!

228
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,107
You...take care huh?

229
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:22,681
"You're weaving a magic spell
You're doing something special"

230
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:25,108
"Immigrating into me as well"

231
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,842
"Don't know to express
Even if so, I'm clueless"

232
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:30,531
"Baby, I can't take this"

233
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:35,501
"Standing millimeters from me
you cast a spell magically"

234
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:41,425
"Thanks to you, Facebook lass
my status seems lame and crass"

235
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:45,970
"Girl, without you I'm zero
What say you?"

236
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:51,177
"Sweetheart! God help me
You chew me to pieces daily"

237
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:56,645
"Girl, your smile is so hot
I stand rooted to the spot"

238
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,919
"I'm truly caught"

239
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:03,219
"Girl, when you look at me
my heart goes on a hiccupping spree"

240
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:13,964
"Oh gawd! Don't worry, darling
This 'sir' is game for everything"

241
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:23,294
"Oh gawd! Don't worry, darling
This 'sir' is game for anything"

242
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,685
"One look at you and oh!
in my heart feelings flow"

243
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:28,591
"As my dream girl you appear
and spear my heart, my dear"

244
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:31,059
"If I don't see you
to sleep I can bid adieu"

245
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,263
"Oh dear! What did you do?
I can't even ask you"

246
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:41,732
"You are my ice cream poppet
iPhone 4S apple savvy gadget"

247
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:47,661
"WhatsApp me when you're free
In love, always on 'Temple run' spree"

248
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:21,535
"All alone in solitude
I was a 'Roadside Romeo' dude"

249
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,089
"On the moon's surface
I sketched your face"

250
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:26,849
"As a cloud I wandered
in rain richly splattered"

251
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,373
"Dripping wet into you I entered"

252
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:32,123
"Not feeling hungry
Even sleep evades me"

253
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:34,709
"I'm lamenting to myself
What's your magic spell?"

254
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:40,144
"In your dimpled smile, you shove
You're killing me softly, my love"

255
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:06,546
"You are my ice cream poppet
iPhone 4S apple savvy gadget"

256
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:11,679
"WhatsApp me when you're free
In love, always on 'Temple run' spree"

257
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:14,321
"One look at you and oh!
in my heart feelings grow"

258
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,915
"As my dream girl you appear
and pierce my heart, my dear"

259
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,696
"If I don't see you
to sleep I can bid adieu"

260
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,485
"Oh dear! What did you do?
I can't even ask you"

261
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:27,380
Like a carry bag stuck
in the cycle stand...

262
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,888
...you fixed yourself on that girl

263
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:31,682
Did you express
your love to her?

264
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,231
I tried, doctor

265
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:40,218
'I had gone to sweetie's office
last Valentine's day'

266
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,424
'I had gathered courage to
somehow propose to her'

267
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:46,425
'But do you know
what happened, doctor?'

268
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,598
'Aiyo! I think I caught her
at the wrong time'

269
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,618
Why are you off-mood, Sweetie?

270
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:07,841
He has been my friend for 4 years

271
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:08,751
But now?

272
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,042
I mean I don't like people who
confuse love with friendship

273
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,647
Can't a boy and girl be
good friends till the very end?

274
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:18,567
'Kaput!'

275
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:32,177
You're my only best friend

276
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,320
'What rotten timing!'

277
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,822
You took 2 steps back

278
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:43,884
At least did that girl
come forward with her love?

279
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:47,033
If at all I get impressed
by some guy...

280
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:50,222
...I'll introduce him
to my parents

281
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,730
'The whole family is loony!'

282
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,963
'Sweetie, a perfume bottle
no scientist has ever discovered'

283
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,463
In a nutshell, you want me to
hold a lantern for your love

284
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:11,906
How can you say it
so obviously, doctor?

285
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,234
At night the same lantern is used
to give green signal to trains

286
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,929
I meant that obviously

287
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,612
That's where my life
took a different turn

288
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:21,595
That's alright

289
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,479
Now let's change our venue

290
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:24,781
Come

291
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:39,120
Good morning, ma

292
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,136
That's my girlfriend, doctor

293
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:43,350
She's very fond of you

294
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,291
Greet her, doctor

295
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:46,573
It is but it isn't

296
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:48,006
Why is it so, doctor?

297
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,247
It is but it isn't

298
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,820
You are in the right place

299
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:52,010
Go, your girlfriend
is calling you

300
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,460
Spend time with her

301
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:54,659
He looks just like a doctor

302
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:55,726
Keep an eye on him

303
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,913
Karthik, these are
my Pirates of the Caribbean

304
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,951
Come on
Row faster

305
00:19:03,238 --> 00:19:04,863
Row faster

306
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:06,930
Come on
Row faster

307
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,645
Use the oar

308
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,773
Row...row faster

309
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,314
Sit down, Karthik

310
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:15,056
I won't spare him
I'll hit him for sure

311
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,390
Continue your story

312
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,963
He should die
in a pool of blood

313
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,736
Just shut up and come

314
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:20,962
I must beat him up

315
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:22,672
Doctor, good morning

316
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:24,041
Give him a few good tips

317
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:28,708
Daily in the morning ask him to
drink fig juice on an empty stomach

318
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:30,946
His digestive system
will be spic and span!

319
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:33,136
I meant good advice, doctor

320
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,302
Hey! Band aid-bull dog!

321
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:36,175
What's your problem?

322
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,316
My neighbor hit me

323
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:38,550
I have to beat him to a pul-

324
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:40,878
Come here

325
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,956
How many friends
do you have in Facebook?

326
00:19:43,018 --> 00:19:44,018
About 600

327
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:47,378
You'll befriend random strangers

328
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:49,690
But you'll fight
with your neighbors!

329
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:52,446
Make him lie down in D section

330
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:53,485
I'll come and look in on him

331
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,704
What's D section, doctor?

332
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,913
Stage by stage
you'll come to it

333
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:00,020
Let's continue
with your problem

334
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,396
My dad finalized a bride for me

335
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,521
If you get married now,
our house will be graced by...

336
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:13,657
...Goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswathi
with wealth and knowledge

337
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,422
Our family will be blessed with
peace and prosperity in plenty

338
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,159
What do you think?

339
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:20,669
Do you like her?

340
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:22,406
Aiyo...dad!

341
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,534
Tell me, 'Columbus'!

342
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,222
Finally I think I will
land up there

343
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,870
Flying to the States?

344
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,461
Seeing a bride formally

345
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,417
Do you feel bad about it?

346
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,883
Yes...in your dreams!

347
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,398
You'll feel shy
even if you look at me

348
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:49,601
Imagine going with your family
to formally see a bride

349
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,896
I thought you'll empathize

350
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:54,128
Now I get it

351
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,367
Tell...tell me

352
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,849
You want me to design
your wedding dress

353
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,418
Oh yes!

354
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,742
Not just yes
YES in capital letters

355
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,429
I'll be really upset
if the girl rejects Karthik

356
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,875
What will I do?

357
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,545
Mithra...getting into that car?

358
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:15,429
Okay

359
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,325
Everyone has got in

360
00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:17,511
You can go

361
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:21,566
Are you also coming?

362
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,570
Mithra, why are you so quiet?

363
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:29,195
Tell me now
Shall we elope?

364
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,960
You need guts to do that

365
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:32,684
Don't simply put up
a brave front

366
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:37,808
Till now 5 boys have
proposed to me

367
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:39,895
But you listed out
only 4 names?

368
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:40,926
Who is the 5th?

369
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,883
You're that madcap, uncle

370
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:45,066
Whom will you choose
amongst these 4 boys?

371
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:46,675
Jill will act pricey

372
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,367
Jing will spin a yarn

373
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,850
Juck is good at studies

374
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:52,094
Jong will show-off

375
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,414
Then say okay to Juck
who studies well

376
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,047
You're useless, uncle

377
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,247
You didn't get what I said!

378
00:21:58,326 --> 00:22:01,492
"Cash, dough, dollar, rupee, money"

379
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,101
Mithra...?

380
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:14,603
Mithra

381
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:22,106
Shhhhh!

382
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,707
Why are you silent?

383
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:33,476
Did you see a red mail van
that went past us?

384
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,599
Mail van?

385
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:38,874
If we see a red mail van
till we see another red car...

386
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,691
...we should pray quietly

387
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:42,863
Only then our wish will come true

388
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,036
Is that so?

389
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,247
What did you wish for?

390
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:47,302
If I tell you
it won't come true

391
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:51,695
You drive, uncle
You'll be stuck only with Shalu!

392
00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:53,983
Welcome

393
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:55,175
Is this the bride?

394
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,742
Oh! Her sister-in-law!

395
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,878
A lawyer family
is just to the core

396
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,248
Even the driver is treated equally!

397
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:01,573
He isn't our driver

398
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:03,505
'No harm in calling you
mongoose brained blockhead'

399
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,817
'In a way this is how
they treat me'

400
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,372
He is my husband

401
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,524
Please come in

402
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,620
I had a doubt
He looked handsome

403
00:23:10,797 --> 00:23:11,755
He...handsome?!

404
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:12,948
Please come in

405
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,250
Step in with your right foot forward

406
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,572
Doesn't matter which foot

407
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:20,098
Come, sonny
Welcome

408
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:21,082
Watch your step

409
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:24,058
You touched a chord in my heart

410
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:24,878
Thank God

411
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,261
God always has to be thanked!

412
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:34,932
I have no inhibitions telling you,
we come from an illustrious family

413
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:36,249
I'm Chithra Lakshmanan

414
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,258
This is my wife
Chithra Lakshmi

415
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,862
This is my eldest son
Chithra Nathan

416
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:45,488
This is Chithra Kala
My eldest daughter-in-law

417
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,964
My addition into this family
was only thanks to my name!

418
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,676
My daughter is Chithra Shalu

419
00:23:54,743 --> 00:23:56,410
Ask them also to
come and sit here

420
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:57,621
Sit down, sonny

421
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,675
Feast is ready?!

422
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,701
Did anything happen to you?

423
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:05,557
No, I'm fine

424
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,707
Nothing happened, huh?

425
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:09,318
A sign from Shoba
to fix the leg!

426
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,106
Is Shoba your interior decorator?

427
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,367
Shoba...shoba

428
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:14,021
Oh! So-fa!!

429
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:17,662
I didn't tell you about
1 more character

430
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:21,055
My youngest son
Chithra Kanth

431
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:22,984
Is he in college?

432
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:27,250
No...he's in the 5th grade

433
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:32,771
More or less 15 years gap
between him and Shalu

434
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:34,274
Uncle!

435
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:38,800
15 years of perseverance
resulted in a jumbo victory

436
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:41,893
Sir is a child specialist
What do you expect?

437
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,994
Before the auspicious time ends,
can we see the bri-

438
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:46,143
Oh God!

439
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:50,205
Is the electricity now signaling
you need a girl to light up your house?

440
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,005
Absolutely right, sonny

441
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,426
He and I are in total sync

442
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,255
My daughter is like me-

443
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,284
Let's leave

444
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,115
He's very funny

445
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:02,675
I was about to say
my daughter is like me in no way

446
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:04,471
She takes after her mom

447
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:05,502
Sit down, sonny

448
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:07,194
I got tensed for a second

449
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:16,438
Your daughter looks
like Goddess Lakshmi

450
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:21,725
No one can beat Shalu
when it comes to cooking

451
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,201
Look up and see my daughter

452
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:26,178
As if you're participating
in a 'kolam' contest...

453
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:29,159
...you are drawing designs on our floor

454
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,112
Karthik, take a look

455
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:34,637
Karthik, at least YOU walk
into this with your eyes open!

456
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:36,183
Look up

457
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,909
'Spill the coffee
all over my uncle'

458
00:25:54,323 --> 00:25:58,625
Shalu, take Karthik upstairs
Let him change into your brother's shirt

459
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,044
Go and change

460
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,719
The bride and groom should
have time to themselves

461
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:06,837
That's the signal
from the spilt coffee!

462
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,961
(cricket commentary)

463
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:15,038
That's my mother
Chithra Veni

464
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,918
She is unable to come

465
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,026
Aiyaiyo!

466
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:21,007
Unable to come
not because she's unwell

467
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,960
She's cricket-crazy

468
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:26,192
Match isn't over as yet
So she's glued to the TV

469
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,166
There's someone
just like you in this family

470
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:48,747
'Yov! Groom-to-be'

471
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:53,497
'Yov! Son-in-law-to-be'

472
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,804
My girl friend is being
tortured by some rowdy

473
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:00,601
What are they doing?

474
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:02,699
She can't travel by bus
or attend college properly

475
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:03,738
They are harassing her

476
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,019
Hey Dumbass! I think
this has affected you a lot

477
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,568
Don't worry

478
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:10,123
Meet me tomorrow night
at Kamala theater

479
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:14,648
I will come in a new avatar as Sophia!

480
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,575
Prabhu, why did you make me
walk out half way through the movie?

481
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,494
To punish that damn Padam
who is torturing you...

482
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:24,075
...a savior is coming to save you

483
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:26,528
- Who?
- Sophia!

484
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:28,011
Is he a VIP?

485
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,685
This whole city will tremble
by just looking at him

486
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:32,920
Look! He's here

487
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:46,066
He's my boss

488
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:51,237
Don't you worry

489
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:52,953
I'm there for you, right?

490
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:55,836
Sophia, didn't I tell you?

491
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:57,118
He's the romantic Romeo

492
00:27:57,216 --> 00:27:58,883
No need, Prabhu

493
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:00,659
Sophia will take care

494
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,980
Who are you?

495
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:15,133
Sophia

496
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:16,706
The Love father

497
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,615
I've heard of Godfather

498
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:20,754
But Love father?

499
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,932
Sometimes if God doesn't
help in love issues...

500
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,613
...this Love father
comes to their aid

501
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:26,984
Come to the point

502
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,733
This is a 'mokkai' girlfriend

503
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,578
Mokkai's girlfriend

504
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,375
How can I?

505
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:34,349
3 years

506
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:35,582
3 long years

507
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,714
Hey! Chicken 65!

508
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,965
Whoever impresses
this chick in 60 seconds...

509
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,972
...gets her heart and soul

510
00:28:53,336 --> 00:28:56,169
Hey Padam!
Your chapter is closed

511
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,164
Are you trying to
sell ice to this Eskimo!

512
00:29:04,797 --> 00:29:06,981
Hey Mokkai! True to
your name, you're a moron

513
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,899
In the year 1947

514
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,149
In a village called Atthipatti

515
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,022
- Sounds like an Ajith film
- A huge banyan tree

516
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,632
In a corner of that tree
2 small sparrows

517
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:26,155
One was called 'Love-me'

518
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:27,763
The other was called 'Kiss-me'

519
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:30,669
Both birdies were lovey-dovey

520
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,167
In between them
a character barged in

521
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,729
His name was-

522
00:29:40,227 --> 00:29:41,709
Don't believe him, Shalu

523
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:44,176
That 'bad boy' was
extremely talented

524
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:46,504
He hooked 'Love-me'
and whizzed away

525
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:47,207
Then...?

526
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,584
The poor lonely birdie
was all alone in solitude

527
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:53,621
Became like Devadas
the star crossed lover

528
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:54,934
Shalu dear?

529
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:56,308
Why is he changing route now?

530
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:58,206
Yes

531
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,537
What's the name
of the lonely birdie?

532
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:01,414
Kiss-me

533
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,814
What, my sweetheart?

534
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:03,956
Kiss-me

535
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:08,496
'Mokkai Prabhu stopped talking
to me from that day onwards'

536
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:10,593
Forget all that

537
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:11,949
Are you ready
for marriage now?

538
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:14,641
Shalu, don't decide in haste

539
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:20,262
I've already reserved a place
for a girl in my heart

540
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,445
Are your parents aware of this?

541
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:24,891
Why are you
trying to be funny?

542
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,589
Even the girl doesn't know!

543
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,733
Hey 'Laddu'!

544
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,575
Is this some kind of a joke?

545
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:38,745
What does 'your beauty' do?

546
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,651
Her name is Sweetie

547
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:46,414
This is my Sweetie

548
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,128
I came here out of compulsion

549
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,727
If you like I'll help
link you up with Sweetie

550
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,148
And bridge the gap!

551
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,570
Do you mean that?

552
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:05,488
But don't say 'no' right away

553
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:06,256
Why?

554
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,660
Already 2 other grooms
came home to meet me

555
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:09,768
And rejected me on some
silly pretext or the other

556
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:11,726
My granny lamented
like there was a funeral

557
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:19,419
Aiyaiyo! What should
I do now, Sweetie?

558
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:21,761
Hey! I'm Shalu

559
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,136
Just say you need time
to get to know me

560
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:26,109
We'll buy time
At least for 15 days

561
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:31,246
I'll also be happy
without being hassled by anyone

562
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:35,598
You asked for 15 days time

563
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:42,538
Your dad would have prowled
saying, 'Objection, your Honor'

564
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,214
Why do you want time now?

565
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:46,935
I set eyes on your mom
for the 1st time on our wedding day

566
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:48,067
Okay, forget that

567
00:31:48,195 --> 00:31:49,401
What's wrong with this girl?

568
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:50,920
Good girl
Decent family

569
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:52,537
Nothing wrong, dad

570
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:54,677
I need to talk to her
Get to know her

571
00:31:54,844 --> 00:31:57,816
Maybe I should send you
for your honeymoon first

572
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,673
You can go, come back
and discuss at leisure

573
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:02,038
Uncle?

574
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:04,386
Why didn't you give me
such an option?

575
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,293
My darling son

576
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,066
I spent hardly 10 minutes with her

577
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,821
I liked that girl very much

578
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:16,207
All he wants is to
get to know her

579
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:17,162
Give him his space

580
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,336
Go ahead, dear

581
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,636
My dear boy, however much
you befriend girls before the wedding...

582
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,896
...you'll never know
their true nature

583
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:29,990
You're the one
who is 'out' today

584
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:31,711
'I was ousted 'out'
a long time ago'

585
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,497
Uncle, don't push me

586
00:32:39,486 --> 00:32:40,570
Don't push

587
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,238
Kanchana...!

588
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:49,932
If I whack you...!

589
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:53,877
She's such a beautiful girl

590
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,886
You like her, right?

591
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:55,731
Then...?

592
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:57,041
Are you done
singing duets with her?

593
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:59,041
Was it in some foreign location?

594
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:01,306
Or did you settle for
our local Marina beach?

595
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:03,288
I'm done with duets

596
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,332
But she isn't the girl

597
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,044
Stop kidding me!

598
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:10,348
Akka, I'm in love with a girl

599
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:14,431
More beautiful
than the word beautiful!

600
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:16,871
Purrrrfect for our family

601
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:24,001
Karthik, tell me
the whole story and go

602
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,652
'My darling's name is Sweetie'

603
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:27,962
'You should only talk to dad and
convince him to somehow accept'

604
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:29,950
Dad...?

605
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,762
'Think about it'

606
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:35,062
Dad is coming

607
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,616
Akka, please tell dad

608
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:41,247
Dad...Karthik-

609
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,342
Failed in Math, dad

610
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:45,847
Only 1 subject, dad

611
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:50,720
Dad...?

612
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,646
What, dear?

613
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:53,535
Are you done wiping
the broom stick?

614
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:55,855
What?

615
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,636
Karthik

616
00:33:58,027 --> 00:33:59,694
Failed in Science, dad

617
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:01,774
Only in Science and Math, dad

618
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:04,213
Karthik-

619
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:07,637
Shall I tell you?

620
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,215
Did he fail in all the subjects?

621
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:11,108
Yes, dad

622
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,258
Sorry, dad

623
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Your sister is born to...

624
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:15,664
...dissect you into pieces!

625
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:16,874
Yes, doctor

626
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:24,282
Listen to me, Karthik

627
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:25,862
Even if it's 2:00 a.m...

628
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:27,503
...wait outside Sweetie's office

629
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:28,073
At 2:00 a.m?

630
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,737
Out of sheer sympathy
she'll apologize to you

631
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:32,344
Trust me, she'll wave
her magic wand for you

632
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,528
'You think so?'

633
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:37,048
Hello Sweetie...?

634
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:37,781
Hello Karthik?

635
00:34:37,852 --> 00:34:39,310
I've been waiting
for you for 3 hours

636
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,075
I'm extremely busy

637
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:44,050
Sweetie...?

638
00:34:55,112 --> 00:34:56,487
The wine shops close at 10 p.m

639
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,770
Hurry up

640
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:05,577
How long do I wait
for you, Sweetie?

641
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:10,009
Please drop me home

642
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:16,886
Dear friends, please
somehow help me...

643
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:19,323
...to make Sweetie
accept my love

644
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:20,739
Nail it in!

645
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:23,097
No taking revenge, Mokkai!

646
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:24,626
Give me an idea

647
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,909
It's already planned

648
00:35:26,098 --> 00:35:27,723
This time the plan is ours

649
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:29,644
Execution is in your hands

650
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:30,524
How?

651
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:31,736
It's not how

652
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:33,153
Wow!

653
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:36,739
At his wedding party, your girl
will be the costume designer

654
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:37,847
I'll offer

655
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:39,038
But she has seen you-

656
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,556
As long as you don't say it

657
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,352
Certainly, Sweetie will ask you...

658
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:44,126
...for help

659
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:45,031
Then you and she...

660
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:45,978
...will come there

661
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:47,086
That's when we will-

662
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,353
'Link us' together

663
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:50,418
Players In Managing Plug-ins!

664
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,457
Take a guess?

665
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,844
I should guess?

666
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:13,392
Did you get any good
designing project, Sweetie?

667
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:15,471
Hey! You are right
How did you know?

668
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:16,424
Just a shot in the dark

669
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:18,221
Anyway let's meet
and talk about it

670
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:19,947
I'm a little busy today, Sweetie

671
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:24,543
Okay, I'll come

672
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:30,781
'A big fat lamb for the slaughter!'

673
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,566
'What's her name?'

674
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:33,799
'Is it Shalu?'

675
00:36:33,914 --> 00:36:36,372
Hey! How did you
know her name?

676
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:38,856
Actually, Shalu and I
are family friends

677
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,897
The bride-to-be I told you
I was meeting...

678
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:43,168
...was Shalu

679
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:45,898
I don't know why
She rejected me

680
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:56,301
Shalu, don't bring up
the wedding matter

681
00:37:00,228 --> 00:37:01,516
Why are you looking at my face?

682
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:04,228
Go and order coffee
for 2 girls, be chivalrous

683
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:09,194
Yeah...go

684
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:16,417
God knows how many dumdums
like me are stuck here

685
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:31,854
Don't try peeking

686
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:35,464
"One look at you and oh!
in my heart feelings flow"

687
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:39,197
Shalu, why did you reject Karthik?

688
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,840
Is that what he told you?

689
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:43,965
Actually he was the one
who rejected me

690
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:48,152
I think he's in love
with someone else

691
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,727
"Girl, your smile is so hot
I stand rooted to the spot"

692
00:37:56,879 --> 00:38:01,046
"Girl, when you look at me
my heart goes on a hiccupping spree?"

693
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,364
"Not feeling hungry
Even sleep evades me"

694
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,816
"I'm lamenting to myself
What's your magic spell?"

695
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:19,655
"In your dimpled smile, you shove
You're killing me softly, my love"

696
00:38:58,157 --> 00:38:59,981
Look at the traffic jam
at this hour

697
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:03,960
Hey Shalu...?

698
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,234
That's our Shalu

699
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,058
She's laughing and talking
to Karthik alone in that car

700
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:11,462
Our son-in-law knows what to do

701
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,800
He wants to get to know her
before the wedding

702
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,075
Let them be together

703
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:16,859
This is absolute nonsense

704
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,294
She's our daughter

705
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:19,160
Shalu...?

706
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:19,810
Shut up

707
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:21,505
Youngsters these days
need their space

708
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,697
Only then they can
get along well

709
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:25,497
'Made for each other' pair, right?

710
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,913
Making out what I wonder!

711
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:28,116
Look! Green signal

712
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:28,808
Nonsense!

713
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,101
I want to catch her eye

714
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,087
Good omen

715
00:39:31,296 --> 00:39:32,379
Shalu...Shalu...?

716
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:35,487
"Not feeling hungry
Even sleep evades me"

717
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:58,751
'Who snatched the bubbles
from this baby's hand?'

718
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,246
You're roaming around
dressed up just like Sweetie!

719
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,235
Do you want your love
to be accepted?

720
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,218
Yes

721
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:20,355
Go there
Hold her hand

722
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,863
Look into her eyes

723
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,138
Love will bloom

724
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:26,093
- Go...go
- Move

725
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,913
Shop...shop...shop
You pick your dress

726
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:46,352
Your idea didn't
work out at all, Shalu

727
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:48,182
Your performance
must have sucked big time

728
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:50,226
Don't find fault with my idea

729
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:52,260
Any girl in this world
will fall flat for my idea

730
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,574
I went there and
held her hand

731
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:55,910
Held her hand really tight

732
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:57,898
Just like you said
I tried looking into her eyes

733
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,388
But she turned around suddenly

734
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:02,330
"Is this feeling called love?
Clashes in my mind's alcove"

735
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:08,137
"What is this change?
Don't know, feels strange!"

736
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:10,484
Karthik...?

737
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:14,988
'Doctor, 1st time I saw a kind of
disturbance in Shalu's eyes'

738
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:19,707
'Then in our friend
Prabhu's wedding party-'

739
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:43,346
"Girl with the moon-face
Causing chaos in many ways"

740
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:47,160
"Clean up his sky clear
Bowl him over, dear"

741
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:50,370
"Learn to sprinkle water
Mop his porch daily, dear"

742
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,652
"You as his instrument
sing an endorsement"

743
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,645
"If you give 2 dolls to him
in confusion he will swim"

744
00:42:15,848 --> 00:42:22,554
"Which doll to play with he'll pester
till your mind wants to murder"

745
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:29,935
"Same time if he hears songs two
he'll close his ears well and true"

746
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,289
"Confusion confounded
Chaos unbounded"

747
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:36,484
"Your life without confusion
will be a bitter proposition"

748
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,137
"Till now everything
was a hazy feeling"

749
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:43,710
"Now is the inception
of your confusion"

750
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:59,031
"You've cast a spell on me"

751
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:04,083
"If it's love, then my love
maybe I love you!"

752
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:07,534
"Lad, young and handsome
Be bewildered, welcome"

753
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,593
"Come to appreciate
life's puzzled state"

754
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:14,093
"To decide hereafter
And make life easier"

755
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:18,209
"Descended from above
This godsend of love"

756
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:22,067
"Missy with the moon-face
Come to spread light always"

757
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,647
"Smart and snazzy, come
Sharp and savvy, welcome"

758
00:43:27,122 --> 00:43:30,640
"Girl with the moon's glow
Shining with a silver halo"

759
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:35,807
"Footloose and fancy free
Come, girl on a joyous spree"

760
00:43:35,968 --> 00:43:42,726
"Cucumber mask on her face
Hide and seek she plays"

761
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,012
"Your hands and feet tied tightly
puppet on her string you'll be"

762
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:53,048
"She'll lock your lips happily
And stretch out a cup of coffee"

763
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:54,547
"Stunned and stumped"

764
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:56,156
"Floored and flustered"

765
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:59,326
"Your life without bewilderment
will be a bitter predicament"

766
00:44:00,385 --> 00:44:03,526
"Till now everything
was a dizzy feeling"

767
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:07,879
"Now is the inception
of your confusion"

768
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:34,465
I've never heard a love story
like this in my life

769
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:38,231
Doctor, are you upset
listening to my love story?

770
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,776
Love story?

771
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:41,757
Don't call this crap a love story

772
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:43,407
People will spit on your face

773
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,840
Then why did you cry?

774
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:46,199
I bit into a green chili fritter

775
00:44:46,324 --> 00:44:48,394
Too spicy, my eyes started
watering of their own accord

776
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:50,868
Why would anyone cry
hearing your love story?!

777
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,066
Doctor, if I close my eyes,
I see Sweetie

778
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:06,730
And if I open my eyes,
I see Shalu

779
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:09,785
If I scorch your eyes with red hot
firewood, you won't see anyone

780
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,795
Why are you bringing up
one girl's name after another?

781
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:13,648
How many girls
did you fall in love with?

782
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:14,575
No need

783
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:15,739
You'll anyway lie to me

784
00:45:15,904 --> 00:45:16,779
I'll find out myself

785
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:18,022
Lie down here

786
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:25,998
You think I intend doing
an oil massage on you?

787
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,192
Turn over

788
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,913
I'll make you forget everything
and speak only the truth

789
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:37,355
Concentrate on this

790
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:42,569
You'll now travel from
your boyhood to childhood

791
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:44,286
Sleep now

792
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:58,585
Forget everything and sleep

793
00:46:03,642 --> 00:46:05,839
Mr Karthik, tell me

794
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:07,702
Where are you now?

795
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:10,332
In the clinic

796
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,406
Haven't you slept as yet?

797
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:15,382
Lie down

798
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:19,090
Look at me through
these glasses

799
00:46:26,915 --> 00:46:29,827
My 8 years psychiatry
degree didn't work

800
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,559
But the 15 bucks glasses bought
at Pondy Bazar is working

801
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,977
Touch your heart and tell me

802
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:41,098
Whom are you
really in love with?

803
00:46:42,997 --> 00:46:44,455
Shalu, doctor

804
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:47,683
I thought Shalu
was right for me

805
00:46:48,086 --> 00:46:49,919
I really liked her a lot

806
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:52,535
Felt like seeing her often

807
00:46:53,164 --> 00:46:54,622
One day-

808
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,511
I told you it will take half an hour

809
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,320
Karthik, are you busy?

810
00:47:12,411 --> 00:47:14,036
No, Shalu
I'm free

811
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:15,739
Karthik, can't hear

812
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:17,072
I can't hear you at all

813
00:47:19,353 --> 00:47:21,812
Shalu, I feel like seeing you

814
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:24,497
What?

815
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:27,072
Where are you?

816
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,072
What did you wish for?

817
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,700
If I tell you...

818
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,949
...it won't come true

819
00:49:16,285 --> 00:49:17,910
When an ordinary
mail van crossed...

820
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:19,027
...you both romanced

821
00:49:19,052 --> 00:49:21,535
What would you have done
had a dog van crossed?

822
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,852
Answer me

823
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:27,861
Are you there?

824
00:49:28,114 --> 00:49:30,429
I slowly started
to avoid Sweetie

825
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,006
But one day
when I was half sleep...

826
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,179
...I picked up
her call by mistake

827
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:39,180
Yesterday I asked you
to wait for half an hour

828
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:41,007
You said okay and left

829
00:49:41,743 --> 00:49:42,783
I called and
you didn't pick up

830
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:44,546
Why are you angry?

831
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:52,106
Do you know a 2000 sq ft
independent house is empty?

832
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,004
A girl by name Sweetie
is living by herself there

833
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,484
So celebrate with Sweetie

834
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:00,015
'No, Sweetie'

835
00:50:00,356 --> 00:50:01,981
'I must talk to you
about something-'

836
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:25,531
Shalu, I've been trying
to reach you for 3 hours

837
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:28,134
Call me back

838
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:31,381
I need to talk to you

839
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:32,739
Whaaat?

840
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:34,214
You're in love with Shalu?

841
00:50:34,903 --> 00:50:37,111
Mokkai! I swear
I love only Shalu

842
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:38,832
Then what about Sweetie?

843
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:42,256
She's calling me

844
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,019
Two timer!

845
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:48,031
'I went that night to
Sweetie's house, doctor'

846
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:50,762
'To tell her I love Shalu'

847
00:50:51,031 --> 00:50:52,197
'But-'

848
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:55,239
Sweetie...?

849
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:23,186
Come in, Karthik

850
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:37,704
Sweetie, why isn't there
electricity only in your house?

851
00:51:37,968 --> 00:51:41,301
No power and
no one at home either

852
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,883
Helped yourself to
midnight feast, huh?

853
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:57,299
Don't...don't do this, Sweetie

854
00:51:57,866 --> 00:51:59,032
Let go of my hand

855
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:01,390
No, Sweetie

856
00:52:01,415 --> 00:52:02,790
Don't do this, Sweetie

857
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,333
Let go of me

858
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:06,847
"Hug me, hug me tight, lover boy"

859
00:52:06,872 --> 00:52:10,747
"Hug me to give me endless joy"

860
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:13,841
Nothing happened
the way you're assuming

861
00:52:13,866 --> 00:52:15,403
I wasn't making
an 'ass' of 'u' and 'me'

862
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:17,461
I just sang a film song

863
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,028
You woke up

864
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:21,285
Go back to sleep, dear boy

865
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:23,856
Tell me now

866
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,132
What the hell happened there?

867
00:52:43,555 --> 00:52:45,347
My dear child, come here

868
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:46,831
What is your name?

869
00:52:47,575 --> 00:52:48,367
Karthik

870
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:51,681
I like him very much, dear

871
00:52:54,595 --> 00:52:56,512
Do you know me?

872
00:52:57,392 --> 00:52:59,003
I'm a Brahmin from Trichur

873
00:52:59,028 --> 00:53:01,028
My wife is a Marwadi

874
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,180
You know what my name is?

875
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:08,872
Captain Prabhakaran Sait-ji

876
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,629
I believed all that you said until now

877
00:53:12,872 --> 00:53:17,440
But you described him as
a rusty lock and a financier

878
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:19,199
I can't believe this

879
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,487
Even if a crow is black...

880
00:53:23,697 --> 00:53:26,322
...its egg is white, doctor

881
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:29,238
Even if its egg is white...

882
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:32,677
...its chick is black, Mr Karthik

883
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:40,061
You seem very busy?

884
00:53:40,255 --> 00:53:41,838
Nothing of that sort

885
00:53:42,012 --> 00:53:44,976
I'm floating
24x7 in the waters

886
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:47,417
Because I was in the navy

887
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:50,916
My wife is 24 hours in mid air

888
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:55,025
Get us some sweets, dear

889
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:58,684
Would you like to eat
some 'laddu', my dear boy?

890
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:03,866
Offer it to him specially

891
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,705
Karthik, taste this

892
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,632
You'll become strong

893
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:11,249
Eat, Karthik

894
00:54:16,497 --> 00:54:17,293
What are you doing here?

895
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:19,276
'Dad is waiting at
the dining table for you'

896
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:21,390
'Okay, I'm coming'

897
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:24,214
Karthik, do you drink?

898
00:54:24,506 --> 00:54:25,714
No

899
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,325
Don't act pricey
I know you drink

900
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,545
You know him so well, huh?

901
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:41,438
Enough...enough, sir

902
00:54:41,673 --> 00:54:43,507
That's just a peg, sonny

903
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,192
Not for you, my dear

904
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:05,754
My wife is back

905
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:11,979
Your mom has
sent me a message

906
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,517
Let me go now and
pick her up from the airport

907
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:17,347
Keep him entertained

908
00:55:21,348 --> 00:55:22,754
You're a great actor, Karthik

909
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,559
You're doing a good job
of pretending you dislike me

910
00:55:27,576 --> 00:55:33,305
I know you came to propose
your love on Valentine's day

911
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,973
Ma...?

912
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:56,201
Have you had dinner?

913
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:02,750
Are you drunk?

914
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,276
No, dad

915
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,165
Sit

916
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,238
Sit down

917
00:56:09,412 --> 00:56:10,829
What's the matter?

918
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:13,640
He's walking like Johnny Walker!

919
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,082
Disgusting!

920
00:56:16,616 --> 00:56:17,741
Shalu-

921
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:18,570
Shalu...?

922
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:19,762
Wait

923
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:24,327
We've said no to the people
who welcomed us with open arms

924
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:44,183
Dad, as soon as you saw mom
what did you like in her?

925
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:46,105
What a silly question?

926
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:48,160
I liked your mom
the moment I set eyes on her

927
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:50,165
You and Karthik are
the answer to our love

928
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,228
You could have stopped
with the first answer

929
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:55,790
What did you like in me
when you saw me, dear?

930
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,422
Your house

931
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,863
I meant the people
in your house!

932
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:02,972
- So you liked me too, right?
- Yes

933
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:06,657
So all of us are living
with the people we love

934
00:57:07,447 --> 00:57:09,989
Shouldn't Karthik also
be similarly blessed?

935
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:13,159
Dad, Karthik doesn't like Shalu

936
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:17,489
I have a daughter too
and I've got her married

937
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:19,847
I know the pros and cons of it

938
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:21,840
Your daughter is a gem

939
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:24,270
But I don't know why
my son said 'no'

940
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:26,538
Our children are adults now

941
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:30,774
We can't intrude in
their decisions legally

942
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:33,329
We are in a dicey situation

943
00:57:33,353 --> 00:57:36,603
That's why I came here
with my family to apologize

944
00:57:37,398 --> 00:57:38,961
I agree to all that you just said

945
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:43,789
But how will I break
this news to my daughter?

946
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:54,143
You promised to marry
the girl I choose for you

947
00:57:54,902 --> 00:57:58,252
Now you don't
like the girl I like

948
00:57:58,488 --> 00:57:59,905
How could you say 'no'?

949
00:58:00,278 --> 00:58:00,888
Nothing like that, ma

950
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:01,769
I don't understand you at all

951
00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:02,544
Mom...?

952
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:03,830
Get lost

953
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:05,506
Sorry, ma

954
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:09,053
Come

955
00:58:09,397 --> 00:58:11,480
Your mother is emotionally upset

956
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:13,378
You are the one who
has to live with your wife

957
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:15,139
We can only bless you

958
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:16,944
It's your life

959
00:58:17,348 --> 00:58:19,181
Think, be clear and decide

960
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:47,530
My head is slightly aching

961
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:49,040
I think we should
drink a glass of tea

962
00:58:49,218 --> 00:58:51,176
What do you think?

963
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:56,016
Love is like this glass of tea

964
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,188
Girls are like the tea inside

965
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:02,878
Boys are like this biscuit

966
00:59:03,093 --> 00:59:07,759
When tea is hot, they will try
to dip the biscuit in and eat

967
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:10,518
But they won't be able
to come out in 1 piece

968
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:12,707
Why are you still
looking at the screen?

969
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:14,024
Tea-break

970
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:23,818
Shouldn't ask certain
questions to girls

971
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:25,458
Where is your 'dupatta'?

972
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:26,903
What's your younger sister's name?

973
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:28,535
When do you intend
getting married?

974
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:32,236
You should never ask
such questions to any girl

975
00:59:32,971 --> 00:59:34,915
To lead a peaceful life
listen to my pearls of wisdom

976
00:59:35,345 --> 00:59:36,800
If you stand before a cow
it will ram you to the ground

977
00:59:37,132 --> 00:59:39,052
If you chase a chick
she'll bring the roof down

978
00:59:39,164 --> 00:59:40,589
It's tough to manage them both

979
00:59:40,718 --> 00:59:41,758
Rough and tough!

980
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:43,878
They will graze you to the root!

981
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:46,078
Our Casanova-king is coming

982
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:53,313
After hours of examination
I've come to this conclusion

983
00:59:53,479 --> 00:59:54,365
What is it, doctor?

984
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,918
You don't speak
a word of truth

985
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,413
All lies

986
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:59,458
I plan to start you
on a new treatment

987
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:01,572
Hey dirty 'lungi'!

988
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,016
Bring it here

989
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:06,357
Isn't he a handsome chap?

990
01:00:06,382 --> 01:00:07,542
- Take it
- Go

991
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:08,367
Here

992
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,583
What is this, doctor?

993
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,110
This is mickey-mintop mixture tonic

994
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:14,906
Someone has said
what a doctor can't treat...

995
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:17,019
...a quarter can, real neat!

996
01:00:17,732 --> 01:00:18,772
Who, doctor?

997
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:20,362
He was showing his back to me

998
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:21,459
So I didn't see his face

999
01:00:21,563 --> 01:00:23,403
Don't irritate me
by shooting questions

1000
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:24,190
Do what I say

1001
01:00:24,325 --> 01:00:25,525
First drink it up

1002
01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:27,205
If this goes in...

1003
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:30,550
...truth at the bottom of your heart
will automatically spill out

1004
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:33,503
Yes, I need this
drunken look

1005
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:35,913
Is it gushing in?

1006
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:38,855
Are your eyes closing
their shutters automatically?

1007
01:00:43,622 --> 01:00:45,582
Tell me the truth
deep inside you

1008
01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:47,149
Who do you like more?

1009
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,700
Shalu or Sweetie?

1010
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,045
Mr Drowsy has taken over

1011
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:52,673
Speak up...speak up

1012
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:07,566
"I can push a boat in mid sea
I can, want to see?"

1013
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,059
"But I can't do it
'cos a boat there isn't!"

1014
01:01:11,328 --> 01:01:15,768
"I can sing 'Kolaveri' perfectly
With its Tanglish lyrics quirky"

1015
01:01:15,926 --> 01:01:20,529
"But I can't do it, sigh!
'cos the tune isn't mine"

1016
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:23,925
"If we patiently wait
a fish wriggles in the bait"

1017
01:01:24,177 --> 01:01:27,496
"If we add salt, dry it on a dish
What a dried fish to relish"

1018
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:29,175
"Also called bulad or buwad"

1019
01:01:29,373 --> 01:01:33,493
"Tuyo or daing it is called
This dried fish karuvad"

1020
01:01:41,009 --> 01:01:43,297
"Ding dong bell
Wait, my Ammu belle"

1021
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:48,644
"This is the bill for my tea
I'll pray for you, honey"

1022
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:51,774
"Cash, dough, dollar, rupee, money"

1023
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:55,325
"Problems come and go many many"

1024
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,785
"Purple ribbons on her plait
she stuck to me, this clever cat"

1025
01:01:59,897 --> 01:02:03,956
"Aiyo! With 1 word only
she ditched me gladly"

1026
01:02:04,393 --> 01:02:06,120
"She rejected me"

1027
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:09,433
"Soi...soi...soi
Screw up to crucify"

1028
01:02:09,808 --> 01:02:12,724
"Your beauty to be mine
I'll do overtime"

1029
01:02:13,156 --> 01:02:20,556
"She told me poetically
Her love so perfectly"

1030
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,420
"I can push a boat in mid sea
I can, want to see?"

1031
01:02:25,516 --> 01:02:29,556
"But I can't do it
'cos a boat there isn't!"

1032
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:40,071
"With her right hand she blessed
And her left hand she arm twisted"

1033
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:43,492
"It was a single shop
in the corner, just one stop"

1034
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:47,218
"Females are made this way
I got enlightened today"

1035
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:49,792
"I swear
I don't need her"

1036
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:54,375
"I hereby conclude
I don't need her, dude"

1037
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:01,368
"You're Miss Superior in this city
My squint-eyed beauty!"

1038
01:03:01,935 --> 01:03:06,735
"Dude, Gaja told me
Marriage is truly lousy"

1039
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:12,853
"Leave me out, dude
Love and females exclude"

1040
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:16,161
"Love and girls end up as
a messed up affair, alas!"

1041
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:19,275
"Beauty queen missy
I know you fancy me"

1042
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:23,146
"I'll buy you a bun
Do what you want, hon"

1043
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:29,012
"Darling, do you
want to eat a 'laddu'?"

1044
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:33,353
"I can push a boat in mid sea
I can, want to see?"

1045
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:37,287
"But I can't do it
'cos a boat there isn't!"

1046
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:41,369
"I can sing 'Kolaveri' perfectly
With its Tanglish lyrics quirky"

1047
01:03:41,648 --> 01:03:46,888
"But I can't do it, sigh!
'cos the tune isn't mine"

1048
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,995
"If we patiently wait
a fish wriggles in the bait"

1049
01:03:50,232 --> 01:03:53,784
"If we add salt, dry it on a dish
What a dried fish to relish"

1050
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,449
"Also called bulad or buwad"

1051
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,347
"Tuyo or daing it is called
This dried fish karuvad"

1052
01:03:59,604 --> 01:04:05,364
"Come, my dear bro
Warm greetings to you"

1053
01:04:18,845 --> 01:04:19,802
Don't panic!

1054
01:04:20,074 --> 01:04:20,834
Song break, no?

1055
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,299
So I went to drink
a cup of tea

1056
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:23,809
Whom did you dream about?

1057
01:04:23,983 --> 01:04:25,223
Shalu or Sweetie?

1058
01:04:25,572 --> 01:04:26,622
Neither Shalu nor Sweetie

1059
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:29,020
But a Bombay model

1060
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:36,045
Doctor, can I share with you
a simple psychology?

1061
01:04:36,288 --> 01:04:37,264
Selling salt to the sea!

1062
01:04:37,371 --> 01:04:38,371
Fine, go ahead

1063
01:04:38,631 --> 01:04:41,831
If lovers or married couples fight...

1064
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:44,211
...then the woman will take
the man out on a shopping spree

1065
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:45,639
And make him spend!

1066
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:47,453
Say it crisp like a short film

1067
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,992
Don't make it lengthy
like a 1930s Tamil film!

1068
01:04:50,118 --> 01:04:52,318
That morning when I read
the newspaper...

1069
01:04:52,343 --> 01:04:53,783
'...I saw a 50% discount offer'

1070
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:55,840
'I knew my Shalu will make
a beeline to that mall'

1071
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,017
'Is she that cheap?'

1072
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,121
'I had a gut feeling!'

1073
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:00,756
'That she's a cheapskate?'

1074
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:11,759
Shalu...?

1075
01:05:16,717 --> 01:05:18,634
I want to talk to you
for a few minutes alone

1076
01:05:19,043 --> 01:05:20,643
Karthik, I don't have time

1077
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:22,019
Please try to understand

1078
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:23,300
It's too crowded here

1079
01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:25,798
Let's go there
I want to talk to you alone

1080
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,515
I'm really hard pressed for time

1081
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,140
What do you want?

1082
01:05:47,496 --> 01:05:49,096
Do you intend talking or not?

1083
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:51,871
Okay, I'm leaving

1084
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,980
Shalu...sit down

1085
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:56,141
Why are you so upset with me?

1086
01:05:56,803 --> 01:05:59,403
I take full responsibility
for all the confusion

1087
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,349
Not confusion

1088
01:06:01,673 --> 01:06:03,313
Only now it's all clear

1089
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:07,353
But I never imagined
your family will be so offensive

1090
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:09,031
Please forgive us

1091
01:06:09,724 --> 01:06:12,124
How can he just
walk away like that?

1092
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,892
- Take your hands off my dad
- Don't interrupt the elders

1093
01:06:15,591 --> 01:06:18,689
Karthik is a genius
That's why he rejected this girl

1094
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:24,501
Thank God, Karthik isn't marrying
the girl from this undignified family

1095
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:26,605
My sister is a temper tantrum queen!

1096
01:06:26,876 --> 01:06:29,716
Should I be punished so severely
for what my sister did?

1097
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:31,719
What's this, Shalu?

1098
01:06:31,744 --> 01:06:35,024
No, Karthik
Everything went wrong

1099
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:36,684
The way your dad spoke

1100
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:39,455
And how my family reacted to it

1101
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,768
You should've been there

1102
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:52,155
Shalu, let's get married

1103
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:54,831
I love you very much

1104
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:58,367
And I also know
you love me a lot

1105
01:07:01,043 --> 01:07:02,803
Say something, Shalu

1106
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:07,542
Don't be stupid
I'm leaving

1107
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:25,217
It can't bear your weight, bro

1108
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:17,937
What?

1109
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:24,311
Fat hopes!

1110
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:35,173
Shalu, let's get married

1111
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:37,809
That won't happen, Karthik

1112
01:08:39,898 --> 01:08:41,338
I know you love me

1113
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,793
Did you see it?

1114
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:16,628
Yes, I did

1115
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,853
With my eyes wide open

1116
01:09:24,204 --> 01:09:26,483
Didn't you tell me
you don't like Shalu?

1117
01:09:26,616 --> 01:09:27,850
Then how come you-

1118
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,040
Did this today?

1119
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:31,065
Akka, I love Shalu

1120
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:32,876
The other day
you said Sweetie

1121
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:34,141
That's also true!

1122
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,686
Then what about Shalu today?

1123
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:38,242
I swear I love only Shalu

1124
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:45,373
Excuse me, can I get
a table cloth please?

1125
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:47,759
Why are you
embarrassing me?

1126
01:09:48,204 --> 01:09:49,884
Why do you need
a table cloth now?

1127
01:09:50,037 --> 01:09:51,639
Only this morning
I told dad about Sweetie

1128
01:09:52,085 --> 01:09:53,085
Oh gawd!

1129
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:59,477
'That night most unusually my mom
was wiping the door jamb, doctor'

1130
01:10:05,855 --> 01:10:08,141
Why are you having
such a long face, mom?

1131
01:10:09,364 --> 01:10:10,084
Ma?

1132
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:12,087
Maaaa?

1133
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:17,413
I'm talking to you-

1134
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:19,391
Where are you going?

1135
01:10:19,608 --> 01:10:20,528
Maaa?

1136
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,209
Karthik...?

1137
01:10:22,234 --> 01:10:23,074
Dad

1138
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:27,425
"Peace has another name...Sweetie"

1139
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:31,006
"That North Indian family beauty"

1140
01:10:31,264 --> 01:10:32,504
Bravo!

1141
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,001
Uncle, did you mean me?

1142
01:10:34,026 --> 01:10:35,774
You sing superbly

1143
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:38,038
Shall I pour 1 more peg for you?

1144
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:39,349
Go ahead

1145
01:10:39,374 --> 01:10:43,574
Karthik, you would've seen
Dhoni hitting a sixer

1146
01:10:44,335 --> 01:10:46,775
You would've seen me
hitting a sixer

1147
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,800
When was that?

1148
01:10:47,825 --> 01:10:48,745
Simply

1149
01:10:49,392 --> 01:10:53,159
But this morning you should've seen
the way your sister hit a 6!

1150
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:16,020
Dad, how long can we eat
'idli', 'dosa' and 'pongal'?

1151
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:19,213
For the first time in my life
we are on the same wavelength

1152
01:11:19,363 --> 01:11:21,323
Don't interrupt me
I'll forget my dialog!

1153
01:11:21,473 --> 01:11:26,513
Shouldn't we also taste
'poori', 'bhel puri', 'pani puri'?

1154
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,674
I don't know how to cook
all these North Indian recipes

1155
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:29,499
I know what to do

1156
01:11:29,524 --> 01:11:31,338
If we go to a hotel now
we can get all this piping hot

1157
01:11:31,424 --> 01:11:33,252
If that hotel comes home...?

1158
01:11:33,864 --> 01:11:36,624
Dad, Karthik is in love with
a North Indian girl called Sweetie

1159
01:11:42,773 --> 01:11:44,181
I have heard
of a glass house

1160
01:11:44,336 --> 01:11:45,896
But what's this dog house?

1161
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,599
Why didn't you get
their phone number?

1162
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:49,584
I forgot

1163
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:50,729
What's this?

1164
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:53,372
He told me that girl's dad
is a captain in a ship

1165
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,833
But this looks more
like a vet's house!

1166
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:57,868
Are you sure this is the house?

1167
01:11:58,074 --> 01:11:59,874
Yes, door number is correct

1168
01:12:00,193 --> 01:12:02,833
Son-in-law, you go ahead

1169
01:12:03,725 --> 01:12:04,672
We will follow you

1170
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:05,817
Yes, please go

1171
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:07,288
Dogs are very fond of bones

1172
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:09,058
- Don't send him, dad
- Keep quiet

1173
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:11,744
Let's all attack
at the same time!

1174
01:12:19,348 --> 01:12:20,708
As if that's important now

1175
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:26,837
Caught it at the sixer line

1176
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,540
Have you come here
as a family asking for donation?

1177
01:12:31,572 --> 01:12:33,212
Kids are getting scared looking at you

1178
01:12:33,237 --> 01:12:34,398
Go to the next house

1179
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:36,684
Karthik, thanks to you
we're losing our dignity

1180
01:12:37,139 --> 01:12:38,899
Did Karthik send you
for donation here?

1181
01:12:39,002 --> 01:12:40,202
Please do come in

1182
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:41,922
No, we've come
to see the bride

1183
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,104
Sorry about the misunderstanding

1184
01:12:44,258 --> 01:12:45,458
Thank God...he got it!

1185
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:46,959
Don't jump over

1186
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:48,468
You will break your limbs

1187
01:12:48,587 --> 01:12:49,805
Come through the gate

1188
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,230
Dogs may bite
Please be careful!

1189
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:52,611
Wait, they'll open the door

1190
01:12:53,175 --> 01:12:54,575
Come in, please

1191
01:12:54,898 --> 01:12:55,858
Welcome

1192
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,871
Hello, sir

1193
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:01,462
Are you a spin bowler?

1194
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:02,626
How did you find out?

1195
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,134
You would've taken
plenty of wickets

1196
01:13:05,275 --> 01:13:08,665
I see you resemble
the spinner Harbajan Singh

1197
01:13:08,743 --> 01:13:10,343
But there's a difference

1198
01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:12,042
He wears a turban on his head

1199
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:14,417
This one doesn't have
that kind of bun on his head!

1200
01:13:19,404 --> 01:13:21,564
My son Karthik-

1201
01:13:23,485 --> 01:13:27,565
Karthik and Sweetie met in
this room the very 1st time

1202
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:28,818
And there was a power cut

1203
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:30,099
He seems focused
in his pursuit of happiness!

1204
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:31,427
He has visited them
and even had breakfast

1205
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:32,773
What is he muttering?

1206
01:13:33,671 --> 01:13:36,342
Wants to know if Karthik
ate breakfast here

1207
01:13:36,432 --> 01:13:38,265
Yes, he had a 4 course
gourmet meal!

1208
01:13:38,516 --> 01:13:41,687
I don't know how
to open this topic

1209
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:43,956
Everything brews
over a cup of coffee

1210
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:46,690
Beauty, please bring coffee!

1211
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,700
Beauty...?

1212
01:13:56,782 --> 01:13:59,302
Karthik's selection is soooper

1213
01:13:59,357 --> 01:14:00,560
This is Sweetie's mom, Beauty

1214
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:01,585
Keep quiet

1215
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:05,710
This is North Indian coffee

1216
01:14:07,961 --> 01:14:09,641
Don't look too sheepish!

1217
01:14:09,818 --> 01:14:10,898
Sit down, dear

1218
01:14:11,282 --> 01:14:14,190
As a practicing lawyer, I have
performed many weddings

1219
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:16,987
Caste and religion
have never affected me

1220
01:14:17,012 --> 01:14:17,972
That's very good

1221
01:14:18,114 --> 01:14:21,271
Whatever decision I take, my family
will whole heartedly support me

1222
01:14:21,358 --> 01:14:22,238
What, my dear?

1223
01:14:22,445 --> 01:14:25,504
We believe in God a lot

1224
01:14:26,066 --> 01:14:28,066
How about our Sweetie?

1225
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:31,231
Sweetie is a very God fearing girl

1226
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:32,579
Today is Friday

1227
01:14:32,683 --> 01:14:34,443
Sweetie observes
a vow of silence

1228
01:14:34,647 --> 01:14:36,413
She won't talk
a word to anyone

1229
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:37,725
Is that right?

1230
01:14:37,772 --> 01:14:38,572
Sweetie darling

1231
01:14:38,714 --> 01:14:39,874
Go and bring her

1232
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,390
Get their blessings

1233
01:14:48,924 --> 01:14:50,373
May you be happy, dear

1234
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:51,493
This side too

1235
01:14:51,518 --> 01:14:52,918
No...no...it's okay

1236
01:14:52,998 --> 01:14:53,998
Our best wishes

1237
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:54,918
Sit down, dear

1238
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:56,749
You also fell at my feet
before the wedding

1239
01:14:56,877 --> 01:14:58,585
But after that the tables
are turned totally

1240
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:00,711
Wonder what is Karthik's fate!

1241
01:15:06,617 --> 01:15:09,709
That's why my son
always watches Hindi films

1242
01:15:10,755 --> 01:15:12,870
He has a knack of
feeling shy that's so cool

1243
01:15:12,972 --> 01:15:14,372
You're right, uncle

1244
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:16,724
Isn't she a gem of a girl?

1245
01:15:16,749 --> 01:15:18,189
Yes...yes

1246
01:15:18,278 --> 01:15:21,413
That family is so beautiful

1247
01:15:21,769 --> 01:15:22,769
Yes, uncle

1248
01:15:23,991 --> 01:15:27,546
What a super-cool family
my son has got hold of

1249
01:15:27,683 --> 01:15:28,723
Yes, uncle

1250
01:15:28,827 --> 01:15:31,107
Karthik is very clear sighted
Not like me!

1251
01:15:31,132 --> 01:15:31,852
What?

1252
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,140
Nothing, uncle

1253
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:39,076
That girl's dad is sooooper

1254
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:43,599
Usually you will make the person
you like live under your roof

1255
01:15:43,738 --> 01:15:46,258
Similarly can we ask his in-laws
to stay with us too?

1256
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,016
High five!

1257
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,700
You're a dumdum
of the 1st order, uncle

1258
01:15:55,253 --> 01:15:56,808
When the brew was
just ready to ferment...

1259
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:59,336
...the Sub-inspector raided
That's how your story is

1260
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:23,537
Let's go out, Karthik

1261
01:16:23,718 --> 01:16:25,330
And this evening my dad
has big plans for you

1262
01:16:25,454 --> 01:16:26,254
This evening?

1263
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:28,081
I can't make it

1264
01:16:28,153 --> 01:16:29,553
I'm very busy today

1265
01:16:29,578 --> 01:16:33,011
Today you must follow
whatever I tell you

1266
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:35,417
1minute

1267
01:16:42,549 --> 01:16:44,293
I didn't expect you to call me

1268
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,140
What can we do today?

1269
01:16:47,252 --> 01:16:48,185
I'm totally jobless!

1270
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,583
No...don't think we can meet

1271
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:56,982
Called up just to wish you

1272
01:16:58,318 --> 01:17:00,080
Hope you and Sweetie
will be happy together

1273
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:09,758
Viewers who are Virgoans
with birthdays today

1274
01:17:10,055 --> 01:17:12,043
Because you are ruled
by Virgo the virgin...

1275
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:15,293
...don't pursue virgins
You will regret your actions

1276
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:17,409
Whatever troubles
you faced till now...

1277
01:17:17,434 --> 01:17:19,914
...is like watching
a pirated version of a film

1278
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,930
The hassles you'll face in future...

1279
01:17:22,033 --> 01:17:24,420
...is like watching
a 3D film in the theatre!

1280
01:17:24,487 --> 01:17:27,927
Full effect with
repercussions later

1281
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:41,554
Shalu...Shalu...come here

1282
01:17:48,256 --> 01:17:49,496
What happened, dear?

1283
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:53,477
Get into the car
I'll drop you

1284
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,582
Don't be formal

1285
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,817
It's raining heavily
Just get in

1286
01:17:58,036 --> 01:18:00,516
I like to get wet in the rain

1287
01:18:00,672 --> 01:18:04,392
That too in Chennai
I love it even more

1288
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,020
Why are you
behaving like a kid?

1289
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:08,249
Let's forget what happened

1290
01:18:08,586 --> 01:18:09,750
We are also to blame

1291
01:18:09,983 --> 01:18:11,983
Don't be stubborn
holding that against us

1292
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:13,769
Get into the car
I'll drop you home

1293
01:18:14,741 --> 01:18:15,769
Just get in, dear

1294
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:24,095
Are you still upset with us?

1295
01:18:25,273 --> 01:18:26,113
No, uncle

1296
01:18:26,221 --> 01:18:29,773
- How are your parents?
- They are fine

1297
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:31,781
Don't stress yourself
too much about Karthik

1298
01:18:33,593 --> 01:18:35,257
I have a daughter too

1299
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:38,482
Forgive me, if I've done something
wrong intentionally or otherwise

1300
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:41,278
Do you want to go elsewhere?

1301
01:18:41,423 --> 01:18:43,623
No, uncle
Back home only

1302
01:18:44,281 --> 01:18:47,011
Let us go over to my place,
freshen up, drink a cup of coffee

1303
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:48,344
And then I'll drop you

1304
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:50,980
Let's not go to
your place, please

1305
01:18:51,385 --> 01:18:53,825
Why are you
so stubborn like a kid?

1306
01:18:53,876 --> 01:18:55,161
My place is on the way

1307
01:18:55,269 --> 01:18:56,629
I'll drop you back soon

1308
01:18:58,344 --> 01:19:00,208
Don't go out now
It's raining heavily

1309
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:01,273
Let go of me

1310
01:19:01,398 --> 01:19:03,165
Even if it rains cats and dogs
I won't give up my cricket

1311
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:04,688
But we'll give up

1312
01:19:04,965 --> 01:19:05,605
Are you mad?

1313
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:06,913
He insists on playing in the rain!

1314
01:19:06,938 --> 01:19:08,338
- Give me the ball
- Catch it

1315
01:19:08,782 --> 01:19:10,742
He'll realize only when
he gets pneumonia!

1316
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:11,950
Let me dry your hair

1317
01:19:11,975 --> 01:19:13,175
- Come in
- I won't

1318
01:19:13,426 --> 01:19:14,626
You call her a girl?

1319
01:19:14,722 --> 01:19:16,893
You've given birth to
a ghost who is possessing me!

1320
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:21,121
Hey uncs!

1321
01:19:21,704 --> 01:19:22,824
Hello

1322
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,206
Why are you getting wet
in the rain like a kid?

1323
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:26,941
Shalu...!

1324
01:19:27,047 --> 01:19:28,447
Watch your step, dear

1325
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:32,509
'Wonder how this lift
will uplift our family!'

1326
01:19:32,866 --> 01:19:34,146
You are drenched to the skin

1327
01:19:34,664 --> 01:19:36,504
I insisted I'll drop her

1328
01:19:39,309 --> 01:19:40,869
Is that Shalu?

1329
01:19:41,614 --> 01:19:43,574
Karthiiiik...!

1330
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:44,701
Open the door

1331
01:19:44,726 --> 01:19:46,046
I'm coming

1332
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:47,554
Don't bring the roof down

1333
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:48,798
Karthik, open the door

1334
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:51,888
Where's the fire?!

1335
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,759
There's a big surprise
waiting for you

1336
01:19:54,784 --> 01:19:55,800
Birthday is always
full of surprises

1337
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:57,265
Come down and
see for yourself

1338
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:59,456
In the dripping rain
dad has got you a pouring gift

1339
01:19:59,539 --> 01:20:00,299
Shucks!

1340
01:20:00,456 --> 01:20:02,426
In the pouring rain, dad has
got you something dripping!

1341
01:20:02,816 --> 01:20:03,656
What?

1342
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:04,591
Come fast

1343
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:06,137
How are your parents?

1344
01:20:06,495 --> 01:20:07,254
They are fine

1345
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:10,089
I'm sure your grandma is glued
to the TV watching all the matches

1346
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,620
My mother-in-law is inviting
the malefic effects of Saturn!

1347
01:20:12,816 --> 01:20:13,761
This chap is nowhere to be seen

1348
01:20:13,888 --> 01:20:15,848
Dad walked in
with that surprise

1349
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:17,208
Move aside

1350
01:20:18,888 --> 01:20:20,248
Happy birthday wishes

1351
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:20,994
Thanks, boss

1352
01:20:21,019 --> 01:20:25,659
What you are about to see now
will be surprising or shocking

1353
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,575
Don't complicate anything

1354
01:20:27,707 --> 01:20:29,507
You're talking Greek
and Latin to me!

1355
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:31,529
Take a look there
You'll understand

1356
01:20:31,756 --> 01:20:33,476
Go...go fast

1357
01:20:37,862 --> 01:20:38,702
Come

1358
01:20:39,174 --> 01:20:40,490
- Why are you looking at?
- Nothing

1359
01:20:40,515 --> 01:20:41,646
- He's still a kid, right?
- Yes

1360
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:43,671
He won't know to handle
such complicated issues

1361
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:45,698
- We have to teach him
- Of course

1362
01:20:47,984 --> 01:20:48,824
Sit down

1363
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:49,686
Dad

1364
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:54,270
Sit...talk to her

1365
01:20:58,881 --> 01:21:00,521
Your dad is voicing my thoughts

1366
01:21:01,652 --> 01:21:03,692
Let me get coffee
for you, Shalu

1367
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,739
Good lord! They have
left them both alone now

1368
01:21:07,764 --> 01:21:10,084
Can she take them to
the kitchen to make coffee?

1369
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,438
What are you doing?

1370
01:21:12,532 --> 01:21:14,160
Seems to be a huge problem
if you wipe the banister like this

1371
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,533
Yes, dear
Look there

1372
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:23,779
Karthik, keep quiet

1373
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,644
Why is he holding her hand?

1374
01:21:26,669 --> 01:21:28,309
Yes, he's holding her hand

1375
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:43,998
She's applying sacred ash
on his forehead now?

1376
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,030
Yes, she's applying 'vibudhi'

1377
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:51,701
Let's get married, Shalu

1378
01:21:54,553 --> 01:21:56,033
What are they up to?

1379
01:22:12,924 --> 01:22:13,506
Understand my feelings

1380
01:22:13,597 --> 01:22:14,957
Where are you?

1381
01:22:15,632 --> 01:22:17,512
'Hello...aunty?'

1382
01:22:17,537 --> 01:22:19,137
Hey Shalu...!

1383
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:24,620
You're so busy, huh?
Acting pricey with me

1384
01:22:28,799 --> 01:22:31,420
You went to the temple and
prayed for Karthik's birthday?

1385
01:22:31,565 --> 01:22:33,045
- Yes, aunty
- Yes, aunty!

1386
01:22:33,577 --> 01:22:35,657
'Why is it a chorus, dear?'

1387
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:37,691
'Yes, sounds like a chorus'

1388
01:22:38,374 --> 01:22:42,341
Wait, I'll get you
a stronger cup of coffee

1389
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:58,335
Aunty, I'm wiping the sacred ash
you applied on your son's forehead

1390
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:05,333
Why is she drawing a 'tilak'
on his forehead?

1391
01:23:05,358 --> 01:23:07,478
Forget the forehead
Look at his hands!

1392
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:13,229
Sweetie, see you

1393
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:15,555
Thank God

1394
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:17,381
End of episode

1395
01:23:24,409 --> 01:23:26,609
Things have happened
beyond our control, dear

1396
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:29,248
We propose
but God disposes!

1397
01:23:29,397 --> 01:23:32,077
If only we had known he has
been in love with you for 2 years...

1398
01:23:32,102 --> 01:23:34,334
...we would have conducted
this wedding right then

1399
01:23:35,507 --> 01:23:37,507
We ended up
hurting you a lot, dear

1400
01:23:37,532 --> 01:23:39,732
No, not at all, aunty

1401
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:43,027
Take a look

1402
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,568
They make such a cute pair

1403
01:23:51,756 --> 01:23:53,102
Okay, I'll take leave

1404
01:23:53,207 --> 01:23:54,727
How can you leave so soon?

1405
01:23:56,098 --> 01:23:57,618
Today is Karthik's birthday

1406
01:23:57,901 --> 01:24:00,061
Have you tasted
my wife's gulab jamun?

1407
01:24:02,858 --> 01:24:05,098
Has the next episode
shifted to the dining table?

1408
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:05,820
'Uncle, come'

1409
01:24:05,845 --> 01:24:07,565
'Let's eat gulab jamun'

1410
01:24:08,442 --> 01:24:09,482
'Let's go'

1411
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:13,206
He has erased Sweetie

1412
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,279
Two-timer!

1413
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:15,252
Serve her

1414
01:24:15,277 --> 01:24:16,173
Aunty, only 1

1415
01:24:16,522 --> 01:24:17,562
Here, dear

1416
01:24:18,274 --> 01:24:19,554
Enough

1417
01:24:20,626 --> 01:24:21,866
What about you, dear?

1418
01:24:22,164 --> 01:24:24,564
Aunty, this sweet is sooooper

1419
01:24:32,355 --> 01:24:33,515
Drink water, Karthik

1420
01:24:36,698 --> 01:24:37,858
Here, uncle

1421
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:57,687
Dad, shall I drop Shalu home?

1422
01:24:57,937 --> 01:25:00,857
Karthik, take rest at home

1423
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,127
I can drop you home

1424
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:14,310
Nowadays I keep
smiling all the time

1425
01:25:15,456 --> 01:25:17,416
Karthik is the reason
for my happiness

1426
01:25:19,216 --> 01:25:21,656
He followed me 24x7
and impressed me

1427
01:25:24,051 --> 01:25:28,331
He's the only one I love most
in this whole world

1428
01:25:29,106 --> 01:25:31,226
Now after he has
become my boyfriend...

1429
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:32,891
...I love him even more

1430
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,360
Karthik is a little crazy

1431
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,096
More like a kid

1432
01:25:41,121 --> 01:25:44,481
When he comes across a mail van
he starts praying like a-

1433
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,386
Hey Shalu, you too?

1434
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:54,358
Tonight my dad is arranging
a party for Karthik's birthday!

1435
01:25:57,038 --> 01:25:58,558
You have to join us

1436
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,743
I can't, Sweetie

1437
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:00,859
We have a family function

1438
01:26:00,884 --> 01:26:02,619
We are going out of town tomorrow

1439
01:26:02,714 --> 01:26:05,354
We need to leave
very early in the morning

1440
01:26:11,642 --> 01:26:14,042
Sweetie, please drop me
on the left side here

1441
01:26:45,903 --> 01:26:52,232
"River Vaigai flowing in Madurai
humming Tamil songs ripples by"

1442
01:26:52,459 --> 01:26:58,833
"The silver moon wanes to a crescent"

1443
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:02,297
"But our love will always be constant"

1444
01:27:02,406 --> 01:27:06,326
"This bond is exceptional
Like the sky eternal"

1445
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:08,351
"River Vaigai flowing in Madurai"

1446
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:10,537
This is my first brother

1447
01:27:10,609 --> 01:27:12,529
Second brother

1448
01:27:12,609 --> 01:27:14,969
This is my last brother

1449
01:27:17,092 --> 01:27:20,932
But we are original Indians

1450
01:27:24,904 --> 01:27:26,224
The more I see you...

1451
01:27:26,249 --> 01:27:27,679
...you remind me
of actor Mahesh Babu

1452
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:30,410
She's my wife

1453
01:27:30,749 --> 01:27:31,749
Hello

1454
01:27:31,774 --> 01:27:34,593
Sweetie, you know her very well

1455
01:27:36,733 --> 01:27:38,213
My brothers

1456
01:27:38,246 --> 01:27:39,726
I told you about their connection

1457
01:27:40,768 --> 01:27:41,888
Take a good look

1458
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:47,510
Do you know
what they all feel?

1459
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,802
They want my daughter and you to dance

1460
01:27:50,827 --> 01:27:52,867
They want to enjoy that sight

1461
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,747
Just once

1462
01:28:53,188 --> 01:28:57,308
If this goes in, heart will
beat lub-dub double quick

1463
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,780
Gray cells will be in full gear

1464
01:29:00,003 --> 01:29:02,428
You can communicate easily

1465
01:29:02,749 --> 01:29:03,789
Just watch

1466
01:29:34,043 --> 01:29:36,603
'That night intentionally
or otherwise...'

1467
01:29:36,628 --> 01:29:37,928
'...I hurt Sweetie a lot, doctor'

1468
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:40,953
'What other silly stuff did you and
that dark North Indian uncle do?'

1469
01:29:42,309 --> 01:29:43,269
Check all the cars

1470
01:29:43,334 --> 01:29:46,734
Stop that car
wobbling its way through

1471
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:49,861
Somebody is stopping the car
and asking for a lift

1472
01:29:49,991 --> 01:29:51,231
Who, uncle?

1473
01:29:51,256 --> 01:29:52,336
Open the door

1474
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:55,361
Get down

1475
01:29:57,444 --> 01:29:58,764
Did you drink?

1476
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:01,605
- Just a small
- Did I ask the quantity?

1477
01:30:01,822 --> 01:30:02,822
What is your name?

1478
01:30:02,995 --> 01:30:04,515
Prabakaran

1479
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,900
I'm a financier

1480
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:08,593
You look more like actor Premji

1481
01:30:08,685 --> 01:30:09,925
Blow

1482
01:30:12,084 --> 01:30:13,164
Blow

1483
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:22,023
You'll both be counting bars

1484
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,680
You have a choice however
Leave the car here and go

1485
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:26,210
I'm drunk

1486
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:28,347
I am the one
without a license too

1487
01:30:28,521 --> 01:30:31,378
How is it justified to keep
the car in your custody?

1488
01:30:31,508 --> 01:30:33,803
Uncle, you'll give me
whatever I ask for, right?

1489
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:36,788
I'm giving you the entire universe!

1490
01:30:36,813 --> 01:30:38,333
1, 2, 3

1491
01:30:38,358 --> 01:30:39,798
Give me 4 cops to guard my car

1492
01:30:39,846 --> 01:30:40,877
We can leave now

1493
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,854
Sir, park the car in
the shade for a few days

1494
01:30:44,102 --> 01:30:45,342
It's a great idea

1495
01:30:45,993 --> 01:30:47,833
I'll see you tomorrow

1496
01:30:48,631 --> 01:30:51,656
Take care of
that dream girl properly

1497
01:30:52,598 --> 01:30:54,718
Might as well sing
a Tamil film song

1498
01:30:54,743 --> 01:30:56,230
"Though we keep running
distance isn't lessening"

1499
01:30:56,435 --> 01:31:00,855
"Though we keep singing
words still keep streaming"

1500
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,960
"No clue whose house we're entering"

1501
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,720
Why did you apply brakes now?

1502
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:07,997
This is neither your house nor mine

1503
01:31:10,005 --> 01:31:14,165
The guy who lives in this house
and I have a problem, captain

1504
01:31:22,992 --> 01:31:25,069
Don't hiccup and puke now

1505
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:44,679
Why are you grazing now?

1506
01:31:44,704 --> 01:31:45,624
Get up

1507
01:31:47,907 --> 01:31:48,667
Who?

1508
01:31:52,047 --> 01:31:52,887
Shalu...?

1509
01:31:54,957 --> 01:31:55,635
Watch me now

1510
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,020
Shalu will open the door

1511
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:17,830
Karthik, I really love our antics

1512
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:21,187
Next time when
we drink together...

1513
01:32:21,423 --> 01:32:23,383
...the same habits-

1514
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:26,870
That's what I like
about life always

1515
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:30,825
Captain, will you buy me
whatever I ask for?

1516
01:32:31,092 --> 01:32:34,021
I'll buy you the whole universe
and place it under your feet!

1517
01:32:35,929 --> 01:32:36,751
Who is this?

1518
01:32:36,838 --> 01:32:39,078
Karthik, what are you doing
at this time of night?

1519
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:41,608
What the hell are you doing here?

1520
01:32:41,702 --> 01:32:43,662
- Don't manhandle him
- Who is this joker?

1521
01:32:47,011 --> 01:32:47,599
I will bea-

1522
01:32:47,624 --> 01:32:49,344
Hey Chithra, won't you be quiet?

1523
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:52,049
Listen, I'm sparing you
for your father's sake

1524
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:54,474
If I call the cops, they will
pickle you to pieces

1525
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:58,217
We just now parked our car
with the cops for safekeeping

1526
01:32:58,242 --> 01:32:59,979
- You'll get it from me
- Chithra...keep quiet

1527
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:01,284
Chithra, go inside

1528
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:03,429
Listen to me
Chithra, go inside

1529
01:33:03,795 --> 01:33:06,435
Karthik, I'm calling
your dad right now

1530
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,879
Sir, I'm Chithra here

1531
01:33:09,086 --> 01:33:09,672
I'm Chithra here

1532
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:12,113
Seems like a bizarre family!

1533
01:33:13,616 --> 01:33:15,376
Uncle

1534
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,079
Madcap!

1535
01:33:19,284 --> 01:33:21,004
Why won't you ask, dolt!

1536
01:33:21,418 --> 01:33:22,738
Uncle

1537
01:33:26,647 --> 01:33:27,527
Awesome pose

1538
01:33:27,552 --> 01:33:28,592
That girl?

1539
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:32,355
This one?

1540
01:33:32,416 --> 01:33:33,336
Move aside

1541
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:34,902
Get out

1542
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,870
Then what about my daughter?

1543
01:33:45,155 --> 01:33:46,435
Go...clear out

1544
01:33:46,944 --> 01:33:47,984
Uncle...?

1545
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:55,571
Don't you know how much
your daughter and I love each other?

1546
01:33:56,388 --> 01:33:59,909
Hey Shalu, didn't you tell him
about our kiss in the lift?

1547
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,254
What is this?

1548
01:34:01,499 --> 01:34:01,930
When?

1549
01:34:02,004 --> 01:34:02,804
How?

1550
01:34:05,612 --> 01:34:06,612
Like this

1551
01:34:07,702 --> 01:34:08,622
Get out

1552
01:34:10,631 --> 01:34:12,631
How dare you befriend
such a scoundrel!

1553
01:34:13,182 --> 01:34:14,462
He's like a rowdy

1554
01:34:14,889 --> 01:34:15,889
Dad...?

1555
01:34:16,252 --> 01:34:17,252
My fault

1556
01:34:17,649 --> 01:34:19,803
If I had raised him more firmly
he wouldn't have behaved so indecently

1557
01:34:20,168 --> 01:34:21,008
I'm very sorry

1558
01:34:21,097 --> 01:34:21,586
Dad...!

1559
01:34:21,713 --> 01:34:22,393
Get into the car

1560
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:23,343
Shalu...?

1561
01:34:23,753 --> 01:34:25,833
He'll never bother you again

1562
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,877
- Please forgive us
- Reprimand him

1563
01:34:28,089 --> 01:34:29,971
Why should you beg him?

1564
01:34:30,129 --> 01:34:31,289
Get into the car

1565
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:33,468
Go

1566
01:34:37,885 --> 01:34:38,925
I'll take leave

1567
01:35:19,896 --> 01:35:20,816
Here

1568
01:35:23,188 --> 01:35:24,948
I know you smoke

1569
01:35:50,772 --> 01:35:52,532
You are really confused?

1570
01:35:55,094 --> 01:35:57,454
Right from childhood
you've always been confused

1571
01:35:57,527 --> 01:35:59,407
Which food to eat?

1572
01:35:59,909 --> 01:36:03,269
Whether to choose science
or commerce in school?

1573
01:36:03,294 --> 01:36:05,494
You chose the subject I suggested

1574
01:36:05,574 --> 01:36:07,824
Same confusion regarding
which college to choose

1575
01:36:07,849 --> 01:36:10,649
You wanted a choice
and your mind wavered

1576
01:36:12,072 --> 01:36:14,192
You accepted the job I suggested

1577
01:36:14,365 --> 01:36:17,511
That's why I was so sure
you'll like the girl I approved of

1578
01:36:18,346 --> 01:36:20,826
But you said you were
in love with a girl

1579
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:24,719
You had learnt to decide
I was very happy

1580
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,544
I accepted

1581
01:36:27,272 --> 01:36:29,711
But now you're saying no
to the girl you flipped for

1582
01:36:29,881 --> 01:36:31,201
And the one I chose

1583
01:36:34,008 --> 01:36:36,048
You've trampled
over their feelings

1584
01:36:37,419 --> 01:36:38,972
If this had happened
to my daughter...

1585
01:36:39,146 --> 01:36:41,666
...I would have reacted
10 times nastier than they did

1586
01:36:42,394 --> 01:36:44,634
But these people are
genuinely good hearted

1587
01:36:44,783 --> 01:36:46,263
They spared you

1588
01:36:48,187 --> 01:36:50,747
When I hit you,
I don't know if it hurt you

1589
01:36:52,459 --> 01:36:54,219
But I'm deeply pained

1590
01:36:54,853 --> 01:36:57,213
This is the punishment
I inflicted on myself

1591
01:36:58,633 --> 01:37:01,433
I don't know if I was
a good friend to you, Karthik

1592
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,802
But I believe
I've been a good dad

1593
01:37:05,864 --> 01:37:08,424
This is your life

1594
01:37:09,253 --> 01:37:10,453
It's your call

1595
01:37:12,302 --> 01:37:13,542
Leave me out of it

1596
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,150
No, Karthik

1597
01:37:45,212 --> 01:37:47,052
"My soul you snatched"

1598
01:37:47,225 --> 01:37:48,749
My parents don't like you

1599
01:37:48,774 --> 01:37:50,663
"My love you lynched
My dreams you scorched"

1600
01:37:50,831 --> 01:37:52,271
Sweetie loves you a lot

1601
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:55,110
"Is this fair, dear?"

1602
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,418
"You trampled my heart to pieces"

1603
01:37:59,662 --> 01:38:01,262
Don't call me again

1604
01:38:02,458 --> 01:38:06,018
"Is this my fate, I'm clueless"

1605
01:38:37,195 --> 01:38:42,555
"One day my heart wishes
for the silver moon it cherishes"

1606
01:38:42,837 --> 01:38:48,437
"Same heart, the very next day
asks for stars that twinkle away"

1607
01:38:48,462 --> 01:38:53,860
"In life, no 2 answers can
be the solution for 1 question"

1608
01:38:54,002 --> 01:38:59,842
"Love said so, to me
today specifically"

1609
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:05,351
"Into my eyes why did you enter?
My love, please answer"

1610
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:11,178
"Into my life you merged
My love, you submerged"

1611
01:39:11,422 --> 01:39:16,867
"You blossomed as a flower
Tell me why, my dear lover?"

1612
01:39:17,025 --> 01:39:22,023
"Right before my eyes, dear
you wilted, only to disappear"

1613
01:39:22,088 --> 01:39:24,008
Madam hasn't come with you?

1614
01:39:57,855 --> 01:40:03,804
"In my lonely island like an orchard
fragrance of flowers breezed"

1615
01:40:03,829 --> 01:40:09,189
"Without warning today
waves sweep them away"

1616
01:40:09,323 --> 01:40:14,723
"Time for eyes to say
tears are love's bouquet"

1617
01:40:14,997 --> 01:40:20,557
"My heart is on fire
with scars of desire"

1618
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:26,209
"Is a bond meant to be spurned?"

1619
01:40:26,755 --> 01:40:31,689
"Is my sky to cinders burned?"

1620
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:37,433
"In life, no 2 answers can
be the solution for 1 question"

1621
01:40:37,726 --> 01:40:44,006
"Love made it clear
to me today, my dear"

1622
01:40:44,188 --> 01:40:46,624
Doctor, am I really
such a bad guy?

1623
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:47,689
What nonsense!

1624
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:53,436
We go to a shop and pick
a shirt of our choice

1625
01:40:53,528 --> 01:40:54,928
When we buy it and walk out...

1626
01:40:54,985 --> 01:40:56,905
...if we see a better shirt
in the next store

1627
01:40:56,930 --> 01:40:58,678
...it's natural to think
'we should've got this one'

1628
01:40:58,938 --> 01:41:00,298
This is human mentality

1629
01:41:00,525 --> 01:41:03,965
Have you taken Sweetie and Shalu
on your bike at the same time?

1630
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:07,802
Wipe your tears

1631
01:41:08,017 --> 01:41:09,257
Cry-baby!

1632
01:41:09,562 --> 01:41:12,562
In another 2 days
Shalu is getting married

1633
01:41:12,954 --> 01:41:14,314
I have no idea
what to do

1634
01:41:14,339 --> 01:41:15,939
Gift her 101 bucks

1635
01:41:16,252 --> 01:41:17,812
Don't make fun, doctor

1636
01:41:18,965 --> 01:41:20,177
Only you can come up
with the right idea

1637
01:41:20,202 --> 01:41:21,802
For a kid to get
into kindergarten...

1638
01:41:22,018 --> 01:41:23,578
...we run here and there
for a month

1639
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,140
How can I unite
lovers in 2 days?

1640
01:41:25,394 --> 01:41:26,410
'That's why I came to you!'

1641
01:41:26,585 --> 01:41:28,425
Let me put on
my thinking cap

1642
01:41:38,706 --> 01:41:41,866
Why are you walking up and down
like an exam supervisor?

1643
01:41:41,891 --> 01:41:43,051
I'm thinking

1644
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:45,231
Walking won't get you ideas
Only pain in your joints

1645
01:41:45,256 --> 01:41:47,016
Zip your lips
Let me think

1646
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:52,850
I got an idea

1647
01:41:52,953 --> 01:41:53,633
What?

1648
01:41:54,347 --> 01:41:55,899
Have you watched
old Tamil films?

1649
01:41:55,924 --> 01:41:57,284
'Few days later'

1650
01:41:59,507 --> 01:42:00,087
Welcome

1651
01:42:00,112 --> 01:42:02,432
Have you come to see
how a wedding is performed?

1652
01:42:02,457 --> 01:42:03,635
Did you meet my son?

1653
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:04,980
Well educated

1654
01:42:05,063 --> 01:42:06,409
Highly responsible

1655
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:07,674
Well mannered

1656
01:42:07,948 --> 01:42:09,788
Do you know
these virtues?

1657
01:42:09,813 --> 01:42:11,416
Or have you at least
heard of them?

1658
01:42:11,547 --> 01:42:13,635
Why are you deriding
my groom's friends?

1659
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,909
They are all louts
Good-for-nothing

1660
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:17,268
They are here to
gobble up the food

1661
01:42:17,376 --> 01:42:18,336
Uncle, I have a doubt

1662
01:42:18,801 --> 01:42:19,961
Go ahead

1663
01:42:19,986 --> 01:42:22,106
Is food served upstairs
or downstairs?

1664
01:42:22,906 --> 01:42:25,186
God help these
wretched souls!

1665
01:42:25,335 --> 01:42:27,675
They'll never get married
in this birth, I swear!

1666
01:42:27,754 --> 01:42:28,994
Welcome...please come

1667
01:42:29,169 --> 01:42:30,249
Auspicious time

1668
01:42:30,446 --> 01:42:31,806
Please bring the bride

1669
01:42:36,961 --> 01:42:38,801
Why are you so glum?

1670
01:42:39,168 --> 01:42:40,947
Go and sit there
with a bright smile

1671
01:42:41,722 --> 01:42:42,722
Go

1672
01:42:57,486 --> 01:42:59,719
Bring the groom here
before the auspicious time ends

1673
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:01,550
Groom is missing

1674
01:43:01,722 --> 01:43:02,694
'He absconded again?'

1675
01:43:03,163 --> 01:43:04,443
Groom is missing?

1676
01:43:06,999 --> 01:43:08,559
He has left a letter behind

1677
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:10,719
Groom has written a letter?

1678
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:11,978
Chithra...?

1679
01:43:12,089 --> 01:43:13,089
Oh gawd!

1680
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:14,519
What happened to you?

1681
01:43:14,858 --> 01:43:17,858
What happened
to your mother?

1682
01:43:17,894 --> 01:43:19,254
1 more letter?

1683
01:43:20,957 --> 01:43:22,957
Dear parents

1684
01:43:23,333 --> 01:43:23,972
'Let down'!

1685
01:43:24,128 --> 01:43:25,168
Uh! My 'letter'

1686
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:27,652
You've already been
humiliated twice

1687
01:43:28,204 --> 01:43:30,604
I don't like the girl this time too

1688
01:43:30,687 --> 01:43:31,807
So I'm running away

1689
01:43:31,941 --> 01:43:33,981
He let us down badly

1690
01:43:34,367 --> 01:43:35,241
Wretched fellow!

1691
01:43:35,284 --> 01:43:38,604
I never dreamt
he would do this

1692
01:43:38,721 --> 01:43:40,681
How will I console
my daughter?

1693
01:43:40,886 --> 01:43:44,311
Not able to withstand this, my wife
fainted due to high blood pressure

1694
01:43:44,423 --> 01:43:45,863
Please forgive me

1695
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,606
For your good heart, you'll find
a gem of a boy as your son-in-law

1696
01:43:48,921 --> 01:43:50,121
Stop it

1697
01:43:50,197 --> 01:43:52,437
STOP!

1698
01:43:52,962 --> 01:43:54,049
What are you doing here?

1699
01:43:54,271 --> 01:43:55,104
Keep quiet

1700
01:43:55,285 --> 01:43:56,805
Karthik, kindly leave

1701
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:58,230
We are already stressed out

1702
01:43:58,374 --> 01:44:00,214
Please allow me to
talk for a minute

1703
01:44:00,924 --> 01:44:04,420
People usually say a girl's heart can
be understood only by another girl

1704
01:44:04,545 --> 01:44:08,569
But no one can understand her
better than her own boyfriend

1705
01:44:09,023 --> 01:44:10,383
Sonny, looks like-

1706
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:12,950
Yes, sir
I'm Karthik

1707
01:44:13,937 --> 01:44:16,297
I'm the one
who loves Shalu

1708
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:20,550
Love failure, huh?

1709
01:44:20,575 --> 01:44:23,255
Love isn't an exam to fail

1710
01:44:23,428 --> 01:44:24,788
Love is a feeling

1711
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:34,100
'If that feeling
gets into you once...'

1712
01:44:34,704 --> 01:44:36,501
...it can't be changed
again and again

1713
01:44:40,118 --> 01:44:43,558
'Why are you feeling so intensely
for a love that's not reciprocated?'

1714
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:45,184
'So many flowers
bloom in a plant'

1715
01:44:45,209 --> 01:44:48,009
'If a flower wilts and falls
won't another bloom in its place?'

1716
01:44:48,034 --> 01:44:49,194
'Very true'

1717
01:44:49,345 --> 01:44:52,042
'But try sticking the wilted flower
back on to the plant'

1718
01:44:52,528 --> 01:44:53,368
'You can't'

1719
01:44:53,769 --> 01:44:55,369
'Love is also very similar'

1720
01:44:55,519 --> 01:44:57,062
'For some love is like a plant'

1721
01:44:57,087 --> 01:44:58,366
'To pick another
if one dries'

1722
01:44:58,607 --> 01:45:00,447
'For some love is
like the flower'

1723
01:45:00,472 --> 01:45:03,552
'If a flower wilts, that's it'

1724
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:07,301
'You can't glue it back'

1725
01:45:08,725 --> 01:45:10,285
'My love is like that flower'

1726
01:45:17,696 --> 01:45:21,182
'I got your love like a dog
blessed with a coconut'

1727
01:45:22,976 --> 01:45:25,176
'I rolled it over and
gave it scant respect'

1728
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:27,177
Just say 'yes'

1729
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:32,122
'I'll quit everything'

1730
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:34,719
Shalu...I'll give up everything

1731
01:45:36,408 --> 01:45:39,652
'My mind seeks shelter
I need a lap to cry'

1732
01:45:40,169 --> 01:45:42,729
I need a mother
in your form

1733
01:45:51,486 --> 01:45:53,870
When you had a 24 carat
pure gold in your hand...

1734
01:45:54,007 --> 01:45:57,698
...you agreed to give
your daughter to that wastrel!

1735
01:45:58,182 --> 01:45:59,831
Listen to me
I feel-

1736
01:46:00,181 --> 01:46:02,861
He has humiliated us
for the 3rd time

1737
01:46:03,442 --> 01:46:05,243
I intend turning into
a murderer anyhow

1738
01:46:05,403 --> 01:46:07,963
Before that I want
to do a good deed

1739
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:10,690
Dear Shalu, step down

1740
01:46:15,097 --> 01:46:16,217
Come

1741
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,179
Karthik, come here

1742
01:46:27,724 --> 01:46:29,507
It's time for you
to get ready

1743
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:31,710
Very smart move

1744
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:34,024
Like Superman you stepped in at
the last minute, stopped everything

1745
01:46:34,049 --> 01:46:35,209
And impressed everyone

1746
01:46:35,775 --> 01:46:37,055
I didn't do anything

1747
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:39,900
God came in a human form
and gave me this idea

1748
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:42,111
One liner idea

1749
01:46:42,223 --> 01:46:43,903
Should we abduct the girl?

1750
01:46:44,076 --> 01:46:45,500
We've decided to
puncture the wheel

1751
01:46:45,595 --> 01:46:47,155
Why target only the front wheel?

1752
01:46:47,329 --> 01:46:49,219
Even if it's the back wheel
the car won't run, right?

1753
01:46:49,364 --> 01:46:51,644
So you mean we should
abduct the groom

1754
01:46:51,669 --> 01:46:53,309
Yes, my dear 'Laddu'

1755
01:46:54,332 --> 01:46:57,326
Oh God! Was it you
who kidnapped the groom?

1756
01:46:58,204 --> 01:47:00,264
A thorn can be removed
only by another thorn

1757
01:47:00,892 --> 01:47:03,061
To convince Shalu,
shall I send Sweetie, doctor?

1758
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:04,330
Wrong choice!

1759
01:47:04,355 --> 01:47:05,735
Allowing 2 girls to discuss...

1760
01:47:05,981 --> 01:47:08,266
...is like smoking
in a petrol bunk!

1761
01:47:08,384 --> 01:47:09,657
Highly dangerous

1762
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:11,289
That groom is quite the loser

1763
01:47:11,402 --> 01:47:12,834
Send Sweetie to convince him

1764
01:47:13,278 --> 01:47:15,678
At least she will be
of some consolation to him

1765
01:47:22,046 --> 01:47:23,766
He might end up
dying in there

1766
01:47:28,395 --> 01:47:32,441
Whether my guy or your girl...

1767
01:47:32,862 --> 01:47:36,269
...has selected a spouse
of their own choice

1768
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,530
Yes

1769
01:47:37,945 --> 01:47:40,345
Instead of crying over spilt milk...

1770
01:47:40,789 --> 01:47:42,913
...I decided to wish
the guy I love-

1771
01:47:43,172 --> 01:47:45,372
Hey! Stop crying

1772
01:47:45,645 --> 01:47:47,693
I've decided to move on in life

1773
01:47:52,876 --> 01:47:55,236
As a girl I have decided

1774
01:47:57,124 --> 01:47:59,604
But I guess as a guy
it must be tough

1775
01:48:00,123 --> 01:48:02,123
But keep this in mind

1776
01:48:02,845 --> 01:48:07,565
There are many girls like me
looking for a good husband!

1777
01:48:14,298 --> 01:48:15,826
Before you change
into the groom's attire...

1778
01:48:16,026 --> 01:48:19,066
...that priest will do his job right
for the money he has taken!

1779
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,447
Before the auspicious time ends...

1780
01:48:20,557 --> 01:48:22,157
...bring the groom

1781
01:48:46,132 --> 01:48:47,852
Look at the groom

1782
01:48:48,322 --> 01:48:49,962
Take a picture of the groom

1783
01:48:49,987 --> 01:48:51,747
Are you happy now?

1784
01:48:52,545 --> 01:48:54,372
All is well that ends well

1785
01:48:54,586 --> 01:48:56,666
Stop it

1786
01:48:57,668 --> 01:48:59,516
Who has come to stop this
when they are already married?

1787
01:48:59,656 --> 01:49:00,776
Bad penny!

1788
01:49:09,578 --> 01:49:11,211
Are you from the groom's side
Or the bride's house?

1789
01:49:11,456 --> 01:49:12,296
Rented house!

1790
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:14,850
In fact I am the groom
You haystack head!

1791
01:49:15,783 --> 01:49:16,823
Hey! Wait

1792
01:49:16,848 --> 01:49:18,719
If you planned to run away
you should've gone for good

1793
01:49:18,775 --> 01:49:19,766
Why did you come back now?

1794
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:20,727
You'll yell at me nonstop

1795
01:49:20,752 --> 01:49:21,632
I'll be back

1796
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:24,964
You wretched fellow!
You ruined my daughter's life

1797
01:49:25,169 --> 01:49:26,699
If Karthik hadn't stepped in
imagine our plight

1798
01:49:26,989 --> 01:49:28,709
I'm cursing you-

1799
01:49:29,179 --> 01:49:30,099
Tell him

1800
01:49:30,124 --> 01:49:32,324
I'll hear A to Z
from him later, move aside

1801
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:37,291
After messing it all up...

1802
01:49:37,431 --> 01:49:39,791
...you're sitting like a hooker
caught in a brothel case

1803
01:49:39,816 --> 01:49:41,656
Get up
Come here

1804
01:49:41,768 --> 01:49:43,427
You learnt to ride
the bike from me

1805
01:49:43,475 --> 01:49:45,555
And showed a wheelie to me!

1806
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:47,216
Oh gawd!

1807
01:49:47,583 --> 01:49:48,581
Were you the groom?

1808
01:49:48,606 --> 01:49:50,046
Didn't you know...?

1809
01:49:51,129 --> 01:49:51,997
Of course I knew

1810
01:49:52,022 --> 01:49:52,950
Why don't you come this side?

1811
01:49:52,975 --> 01:49:54,415
Can't you talk from here?

1812
01:49:55,003 --> 01:49:56,947
When I heard you and Shalu
were getting engaged...

1813
01:49:57,124 --> 01:49:58,524
...I almost had a heart attack

1814
01:49:58,705 --> 01:50:00,665
My darling gave me the idea

1815
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:01,781
'Adan goya sheeka makka!!'

1816
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:03,117
To become your patient

1817
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:04,825
Only after that I came-

1818
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:06,610
Stop it!

1819
01:50:07,328 --> 01:50:09,672
You mentioned the name Shalu
and covered me with that shawl

1820
01:50:09,808 --> 01:50:11,448
I won't spare you, I swear!

1821
01:50:11,536 --> 01:50:14,576
Doctor, just rewind a little

1822
01:50:15,569 --> 01:50:17,329
'Doctor, I have a doubt'

1823
01:50:17,902 --> 01:50:20,021
'What if that guy isn't convinced
even after Sweetie talks to him?'

1824
01:50:20,219 --> 01:50:23,594
If he hails from a family
with di, self re, shay...

1825
01:50:23,729 --> 01:50:25,078
...he'll definitely get convinced!

1826
01:50:25,216 --> 01:50:26,536
What's di, self re, shay?

1827
01:50:26,673 --> 01:50:28,992
Dignity, self respect, shame

1828
01:50:29,234 --> 01:50:32,674
In spite of this,
if he isn't convinced...

1829
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,161
...he'll suffer from a stroke
on his wedding night

1830
01:50:43,781 --> 01:50:45,558
Here's a new curse from me

1831
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:49,035
For men who go for a honeymoon
making another man suffer...

1832
01:50:49,263 --> 01:50:51,983
...only a lizard will fall
into the glass of milk

1833
01:50:53,282 --> 01:50:56,207
For your golden heart
you'll find a good girl

1834
01:50:56,445 --> 01:50:57,805
So you are bad, huh?

1835
01:50:57,885 --> 01:50:59,525
I don't want
these empty words

1836
01:50:59,565 --> 01:51:01,407
If you're dating someone, confess
before the invitations are printed

1837
01:51:01,525 --> 01:51:03,885
Don't lead him to the altar
and make him look a joker

1838
01:51:04,952 --> 01:51:06,392
(loud laughter)

1839
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:10,549
Now I am nailed as the joker

1840
01:51:11,091 --> 01:51:12,931
'Adan goya sheeka makka!!'

1841
