1
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,452
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

2
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:26,425
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

3
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,871
"O friend."

4
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:37,654
"Let every moment pass happily."

5
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:42,065
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

6
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:48,161
"O friend. - Keep on
singing and humming, my friend."

7
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,322
"The open sky, these
green and luscious fields."

8
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:10,246
"No matter how many times you
see them you never get your fill."

9
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:16,915
"Every creation is so wonderful."

10
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:21,439
"The flowers give the message
to laugh even in hardship."

11
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:24,013
"Friend.. to laugh
even in hardship."

12
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,778
"O traveler.."

13
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,081
"..don't lose 
your delicate heart."

14
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:39,052
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

15
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:40,375
"O friend."

16
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:17,029
"The water in the
river shines like silver."

17
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:21,881
"Each drop of water 
gives us life."

18
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:29,380
"It drops from the sky
and unites with the land."

19
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:33,952
"Without water,
nothing is possible."

20
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,237
"..nothing is possible. 
- O brother, nothing is possible."

21
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,163
"O clouds.."

22
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:47,347
"..had there been no water,
this world would have burned."

23
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:52,701
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

24
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:57,493
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

25
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:02,385
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

26
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:07,759
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

27
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:16,491
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

28
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:20,050
After passing through
cities and villages..

29
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,649
..and creating a sensation
the evergreen theatre is..

30
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:26,667
..now in your village.

31
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:39,364
Banke!

32
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:50,641
Boss, you've
increased the ticket rates.

33
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,660
So you'll have to increase 
our pay too. - You pigeon..

34
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:56,238
..I turned you from a slob
into Banke Lal the actor!

35
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,279
But you're showing attitude
to me today! - What can I do?

36
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,278
Mom has written to
me from our village.

37
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,917
For 1 rupee, instead of a kilo of
rice you get only 800 grams now.

38
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,636
And you now get only
250 grams of ghee..

39
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,195
..and only half the amount
of sugar for a rupee.

40
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,738
Is this inflation 
or a calamity?

41
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:12,594
So you tell me what will mom eat
and wear there with only 10 rupees?

42
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:13,954
And how will I bear 
my expenses here?

43
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,634
Am I responsible 
for the inflation?

44
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:18,458
There's a war going on, so
why won't there be inflation?

45
00:05:18,513 --> 00:05:19,592
Go and ask them.

46
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:21,391
Why should I? You go and ask!

47
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:24,350
I want a raise of 5 rupees,
that's all.

48
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:29,348
Banke, did your
mother and the inflation..

49
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,869
..tell you to show your
attitude at this time?

50
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,387
My dear, if you reject
my pleas like them..

51
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,146
..there won't be any difference
between a lover and a killer.

52
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:44,825
Little boy, you even talk as
if you're some great singer!

53
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:50,184
O dear, had you been
younger I'd have married you.

54
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:52,342
What are you saying, 
Champa Bai?

55
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,343
You're so kindhearted.

56
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:57,021
So, please have
some mercy on me too.

57
00:05:57,341 --> 00:06:00,140
The second bell has also
started ringing! I'm ruined!

58
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:02,620
And they're flirting
with each other like lovers!

59
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,218
When the curtains are
raised on the third bell..

60
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,779
..people will burn everything
down and destroy everything!

61
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:09,498
Neither this tent will remain
nor will these musical instruments!

62
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,377
Boss, don't try to act
smart in front of the actors!

63
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:15,735
Increase my salary. Else, you'll
have to pay the price! Understand?

64
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,456
My dear..
- That's enough.

65
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,375
This love story is over.

66
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:20,973
Boss.
- Yes?

67
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:22,614
Increase his salary.
- What?

68
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:24,053
By 3 rupees.

69
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:25,933
Come on.
- 3 rupees?

70
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,453
No! 1 rupee.

71
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:30,012
Boss, 3 rupees!

72
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,530
No. No.

73
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,280
"My husband is so young!"

74
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,528
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

75
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,782
"What a big problem I am in!"

76
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:33,910
"How will I enjoy my youth now?"

77
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,043
"My husband is so young!"

78
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:42,572
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

79
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:59,976
"By the time he matures up.."

80
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:04,187
"..I won't remain 
young anymore."

81
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:10,644
"By the time he matures up.."

82
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,252
"..I won't remain 
young anymore."

83
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:19,226
"By the time his 
flame ignites.."

84
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:22,593
"..I'd have turned to ashes."

85
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:26,204
"These are the days for fun."

86
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:29,292
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

87
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:34,505
"My husband is so young!"

88
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,993
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

89
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:51,068
"A flower is always
bigger than a bee."

90
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:55,197
"Even then, the bee
drinks all its nectar."

91
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:01,655
"A flower is always
bigger than a bee."

92
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:06,007
"Even then, the bee
drinks all its nectar."

93
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:13,485
"A tailor stitches so many
clothes with just a small needle."

94
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:17,133
"Just love me and see."

95
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:20,182
"You'll certainly 
enjoy your youth."

96
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:25,406
"Just love me and see."

97
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:28,644
"You'll certainly 
enjoy your youth."

98
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:46,129
"My beloved doesn't have
a moustache or a beard."

99
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,500
"Even then, he brags a lot."

100
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:56,556
"My beloved doesn't have
a moustache or a beard."

101
00:09:56,636 --> 00:10:00,045
"Even then, he brags a lot."

102
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:04,969
"His milk teeth
aren't gone as yet."

103
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:08,346
"So how can he
understand what I am saying?"

104
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:11,955
"This young age 
is very dangerous."

105
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,883
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

106
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:20,096
"My husband is so young!"

107
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,920
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

108
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:55,627
"Youth, which you're
so arrogant about"

109
00:10:56,108 --> 00:11:03,608
"Is just like flowing water."

110
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:12,150
"No matter how hard
you try to catch it."

111
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:19,087
"It runs away, even if you
try for a hundred years."

112
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:48,242
"I pity those who cry
at their condition."

113
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:58,870
"I pity those who cry
at their condition."

114
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,040
"Try to live for
others and then see.."

115
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,470
"..that's where
real happiness lies."

116
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:09,938
"Control your mind and body.."

117
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:12,946
"..then see how you
enjoy your youth."

118
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:18,239
"Forget all this fighting."

119
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:21,969
"You'll then enjoy your youth."

120
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:26,581
"Love your beloved."

121
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,529
"You'll then enjoy 
your youth."

122
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,797
"My husband is so young!"

123
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,446
"How will I enjoy 
my youth now?"

124
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,841
Wow, what a
melodious voice you have!

125
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,364
You sing so nicely!

126
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:45,609
Today, you saved my
company's reputation.

127
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,698
Why are you standing there?
Go away!

128
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:51,626
You almost spoilt the
company's name today, you fool!

129
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,711
The company's owner was
standing at the corner..

130
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,556
..and showing me 1 rupee.
That's why I forgot.

131
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,922
Don't give excuses! Go!

132
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:00,168
Listen, what's your name?

133
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,971
Mine? Shyam.

134
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:05,341
What a nice name! Come with me.

135
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:10,835
3 rupees.

136
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,658
Will you drink?

137
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,064
What happened?

138
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:25,473
No, this sherbet smells.

139
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,383
Its smell refreshes
your heart and mind..

140
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:32,531
..and brings out a sweet
aroma from inside you.

141
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:36,060
Looks like you don't drink.

142
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:40,190
This isn't sherbet, but liquor,
you simpleton.

143
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:43,118
Liquor? What's liquor?

144
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,088
It's something that 
intoxicates you.

145
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,780
After drinking it, one's
forgets all his sorrows..

146
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:54,347
..and even himself.

147
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,913
But why would one
wish to forget himself?

148
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,325
To see dreams.
- Dreams?

149
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,936
I feel that reality and dreams
are the same. - How is that?

150
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:10,187
Whatever I see when awake are
the same things I see when asleep.

151
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,767
The birds flying in the sky, the
waves, clouds, fields, trees..

152
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,138
Everything seems so good.
- What are you saying?

153
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,705
I can't understand anything.

154
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:30,941
In whose drama company
did you work before?

155
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,687
Gopal Shankar's or Kripa Ram's?

156
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,816
Gopal.. I've never
even heard their names.

157
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,382
And what's drama?

158
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:45,478
You just worked in a drama,
but don't even know it!

159
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,368
If you don't know, then
how did you show that talent?

160
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,619
You sang so well. The
people were full of praise.

161
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,225
Where did you learn it?
Tell me the truth.

162
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:58,190
Singing? Nowhere.

163
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,214
I sing whatever I feel like.

164
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:04,727
If something I hear
feels nice I remember it.

165
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,291
Amazing!

166
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:09,179
Where do you live?
- Nowhere.

167
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,670
What? - I just roam around
here and there.

168
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,279
New villages, new people,
I like everyone.

169
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,966
Don't your parents
tell you anything?

170
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:21,890
I don't have anyone.

171
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,775
Are you all alone?

172
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,383
So what? I consider
everyone my own, sister.

173
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,150
Sister!

174
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,278
Did you call me 'sister'?

175
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:35,286
Yes. That's how one
addresses his elder sister.

176
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,210
You don't like the 
smell of liquor, right?

177
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,881
But what can I do? My
sorrow has turned me helpless.

178
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:53,292
It's something very bad.
- Then why don't you leave it?

179
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:58,305
Leave it? How can I?

180
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,255
The one I loved..

181
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,672
..handed it to me..

182
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:19,279
..and left me forever.

183
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:25,525
The traitor and cheat!

184
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:26,697
Sister!

185
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:34,758
He promised to marry me,
then ruined me.

186
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,924
And..

187
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,096
Anyway, you're very young..

188
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
..and won't 
understand all this.

189
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:46,709
Go to sleep.

190
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:52,242
I'll talk to you in
the morning. Go to sleep.

191
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,155
Boss. Boss.

192
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:22,882
Stop your nonsense! Get out!

193
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:25,890
I'll complain to Champa madam in the
morning! This is sheer injustice!

194
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:29,214
Yes, but you too were
doing injustice on us.

195
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:32,707
If Shyam hadn't come at the right
time our company would have flopped.

196
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,795
Shyam will be appointed
in your place. Go away!

197
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,843
Don't say that, boss!
I've served you a lot.

198
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,572
And you said that you turned
me into an actor from nobody.

199
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:45,239
So why are you
ruining this poor man now?

200
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,227
How will I earn my living now?
What will happen to my mother?

201
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:51,315
Boss, don't fire me.

202
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,363
I beg you.

203
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:58,413
Please, don't throw me out.
- I don't want to hear anything!

204
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:02,784
Why are you ruining my
intoxication? Get lost from here!

205
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:22,194
What? You can't find
Shyam anywhere?

206
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:26,145
Where did he go and why?
- What can I say, Champa madam?

207
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:29,291
Shyam looks very
kindhearted and noble.

208
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:33,383
And he heard that boss
was going to fire me.

209
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:36,591
So, he felt pity for me and left.
I too will leave now!

210
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,075
Get this clear, I
too will leave now!

211
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,399
You can play the drums 
in your play then!

212
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:43,890
No, son. I scolded you
because I was drunk.

213
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,534
Can I ever fire you?

214
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:48,502
You're the hero of this
company and also the owner.

215
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:51,950
Come, let me treat you
to some great liquor.

216
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:01,254
Leaving me, where have you gone,
Shyam? I'm so unfortunate!

217
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:22,548
"Where have I come from
and where am I going?"

218
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:27,641
"One who doesn't know
that is the happiest."

219
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:35,421
"These moving winds
are making a sound."

220
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:39,645
"And these flying birds are
living their lives to the fullest."

221
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,069
"..their lives to the fullest."

222
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,204
"O birds.."

223
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:53,027
"..take wings like
birds and fly away."

224
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:57,358
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

225
00:19:57,438 --> 00:19:58,582
"O friend."

226
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:02,410
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

227
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:03,413
"Keep moving."

228
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:07,664
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

229
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:08,907
"Keep moving."

230
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:13,920
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

231
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,526
Why are you laughing?

232
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,844
I couldn't control myself after
seeing your face. - My face?

233
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:38,490
You put on that thing..
- Keep quiet!

234
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:42,494
Come on, Jai Ram!
- Yes, let's go.

235
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:46,496
Strange!

236
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,260
Come on!

237
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:54,224
8 rounds for one paisa!

238
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:58,908
Come, brothers and ride my horses!
8 rounds for one paisa!

239
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:01,550
Come and ride my horses!

240
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:03,870
Ride what? 
- The horses, of course!

241
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:06,754
White, red, yellow and
green horses! - Hello!

242
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,036
Take this money. I'll
sit on the white horse.

243
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:12,318
Yes dear, the white horse is
very strong. So and sit on it.

244
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:13,879
How can she? A child is
already sitting on it.

245
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,441
Then tell him to alight.
- How's that possible?

246
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,082
He's already sitting on it.
- So what if he's sitting?

247
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:21,406
He can sit later, I'll sit first.
- She'll sit on it first.

248
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,768
Why are you laughing now?

249
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:27,731
I'm now laughing because you're
more immature than that child!

250
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:30,613
How does it matter to you? Who
are you to speak in between?

251
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,454
Yes, who are you
to speak in between?

252
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:35,576
Don't you know? She's the daughter
of the landlord of Phoolpur!

253
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Is she? - Yes.

254
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,260
Greetings, child. I'm
so happy to meet you.

255
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,302
Why didn't you tell me before?
Sit on the red horse.

256
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:48,228
No, I'll sit only on the white horse
even if it costs me a fortune!

257
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:51,452
Child, come and sit 
on the red horse. - No!

258
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,472
Don't take me off this horse!
- Come on!

259
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:55,513
Brother, come fast!
- I'll call him!

260
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,515
Brother, come fast and
get him off the horse!

261
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,757
Who's this 'brother'?
- He!

262
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:00,918
C'mon.
- Come on, brother!

263
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,640
Are you enjoying
making this small child cry?

264
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,645
Don't cry.

265
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,369
Who have you come here with?
- With my elder brother.

266
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,890
Your elder brother? 
Where's he?

267
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,611
He's gone to buy sweets.

268
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:21,235
That's very good! 
Let's do one thing.

269
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:23,536
Let's eat the sweets first,
then sit on the horse.

270
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:26,859
We'll bring a sweet for your
horse too. Then see how he runs.

271
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:29,381
He'll take 10 rounds
instead of 8. Okay?

272
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:31,784
Come on, leave this.

273
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:38,668
Happy? Go and sit
on the white horse.

274
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:42,974
Will I go and sit on
it at your bidding?

275
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:46,996
What's this? I can buy
a real horse like this!

276
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,677
Right, Jai Ram?
- Yes!

277
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,197
Let's go, Jai Ram. 
- Yes, come on.

278
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:52,160
Go and sit on your horse.
- On what?

279
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,480
On your horse!

280
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:56,043
Stand straight.

281
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,972
Run!

282
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,015
Run!

283
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:27,029
He saved you, aunt.
- The boy really showed courage.

284
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:28,949
What weird people!
They left the bull loose!

285
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,471
Supposed it had
injured him with its horns?

286
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,352
Are you hurt, son?
- No.

287
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:37,317
Bless you. I'll
never forget your favor.

288
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,641
Listen.
- Yes?

289
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:45,283
What's your name?
- Shyam.

290
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:48,005
Have you come to see 
the carnival? - Yes.

291
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:51,568
Where do you live?
- Nowhere.

292
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:54,090
I just travel and
stay wherever I arrive.

293
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,733
What about your parents and
siblings? - I'm all alone.

294
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:01,175
But madam, why does
everyone ask me about..

295
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:03,898
..where I live and who
all are there in my family?

296
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,942
All are my own the birds, the
animals, mountains, fields..

297
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:12,025
..and I belong to them all.
- You have such nice thoughts.

298
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:13,946
Come with me.
- Where?

299
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:17,269
To that guest house.
We're staying there.

300
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,551
Come.

301
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:23,354
Well done, son. You saved her.

302
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:27,398
So what? If I wasn't there somebody
else would have saved madam.

303
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:30,359
What a great thing you said!

304
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,282
Come, son. There's
still time for lunch.

305
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:35,084
So have some snacks till then.

306
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:37,005
Come.
- Go.

307
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:46,252
Here, eat.

308
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:50,616
You're very hungry, right?
- Not at all.

309
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:53,138
Mom, today, at the carnival..

310
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,781
You?

311
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:58,805
He's Shyam, dear.

312
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:00,464
He's a very nice boy.

313
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:02,488
She's our daughter, Radha.

314
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:06,590
Why do you have to
tell everyone my name?

315
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:12,354
I'm hungry, give me
something to eat. - Okay.

316
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,158
Here, eat.

317
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,083
Eat.
- Where's my sweet?

318
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:26,724
But you don't eat sweets.
- I'll eat it today.

319
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:29,208
I had brought only a few.
They're over now.

320
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,930
You can have it at home.
- No, I'll have it right here!

321
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,291
Have this.

322
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:38,015
Have this.. Showing pity?
I won't eat it!

323
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:44,980
Our love has spoiled her
and she gets angry very soon.

324
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:51,026
Eat.
- Yes.

325
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,050
Jai Ram. - Yes, dear?

326
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,312
Remember that boy?
- Who?

327
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,034
The one at the mask shop
and the merry-go-round?

328
00:26:02,114 --> 00:26:04,637
Yes.
- He's sitting inside..

329
00:26:04,717 --> 00:26:07,158
..and mom is serving
him sweets so fondly!

330
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:08,680
Serving him sweets?

331
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,481
I'll have to teach him
a lesson now!

332
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:14,084
Shall I drop a
scorpion in his clothes?

333
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:15,405
Lizard?

334
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:18,208
Shall I drop a frog?
- No!

335
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,131
Idea!

336
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:39,545
Wow, did the sun rise from the
west today that you're helping me?

337
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:44,670
Aunt says I'm grown up now and should
learn all the household chores.

338
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:46,671
Very good, my child!

339
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,674
Come, they've
already sat down to eat.

340
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:54,357
I'll bring the remaining plates.
- Be careful.

341
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:55,557
Ok.

342
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:15,229
The food should be such that
one salivates as soon as he sees it.

343
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:17,296
Give it to me.

344
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:23,020
This is dad's, this is mine
and this one is for your guest.

345
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,782
Okay, sit down.

346
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,314
Hail!

347
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,338
Start.

348
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:52,925
Why are you looking there? Eat.

349
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:56,368
This bun is so hard!
I can't even eat it!

350
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,290
Please, bring me a soft one.
- Okay.

351
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:10,700
Black gram lentil
is the best of all.

352
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,820
Taste it and see, son.

353
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:18,345
Why are you eating it
with the vegetables?

354
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:20,267
Eat it with the lentil.

355
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:31,491
Oh God! - What happened?

356
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:34,238
Mom, I'll die! Chili!

357
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:37,401
What happened?
- This lentil!

358
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:39,083
Was there a stone 
in the lentil? - No, mom!

359
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:40,684
Chili! I'm burning!

360
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,405
But there's no chili in this.

361
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,847
Had you eaten this
lentil you'd have known!

362
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:47,368
Mom, I'm burning! 
It got swapped!

363
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,851
Swapped? Okay.

364
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:54,695
I must have put chilies in your
lentil instead of cumin seeds.

365
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,378
You don't know anything, mom!

366
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,939
Okay, drink this water.

367
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,503
Mom, I'm burning!

368
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:15,632
I thought I'd let
him go after lunch.

369
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:17,754
But where will he go?

370
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:20,677
Who? Shyam?

371
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:28,325
Yes..He doesn't have a house..
..or any relatives.

372
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:35,889
He seems to be very talented and
shouldn't be spoilt in bad company.

373
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:41,613
That's why I was thinking why
don't we take him along with us?

374
00:29:41,774 --> 00:29:43,175
What's the harm in it?

375
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:47,258
He can get some education
and find some source of living.

376
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:50,781
He might not have anyone,
but he's there himself.

377
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:53,105
We should know his wishes too.

378
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:56,786
I'll ask him. I
don't think he'll refuse.

379
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:58,387
Madam.

380
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,871
Come son. We were
just talking about you.

381
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,553
Really?
- Yes.

382
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:10,996
What's this? - Please,
permit me to go now.

383
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:13,279
But where?
- Anywhere.

384
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,403
I stayed with you the whole
day and had such nice food.

385
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:23,248
And you people are so nice. - Good
people find everyone else good too.

386
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,289
My respects.

387
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:26,890
Listen.
- Yes?

388
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:33,056
You like going to new
places and meeting new people.

389
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:36,578
Yes, a lot. - Then why 
don't you come with us?

390
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:40,261
With you? - Yes. We have
luscious and green fields..

391
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,905
..gardens, cows,
and everything else.

392
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:47,587
And we even have 
a small temple..

393
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:51,751
..from where you can
see the flowing rivers,

394
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:56,233
the open sky and
even the high mountains.

395
00:30:57,876 --> 00:30:59,356
Will you come?

396
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:25,389
"The earth is my mother
and the sky my father."

397
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,963
"The earth is my mother
and the sky my father."

398
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:35,896
"I feel that the
whole world is my own."

399
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:42,151
"The earth is my mother
and the sky my father."

400
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:14,074
"The high mountains
covered with clouds."

401
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:25,703
"The flowing river
breaking all its bonds."

402
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:30,917
"My heart lies in the
smile of the flowers."

403
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:35,850
"I feel that the
whole world is my own."

404
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:41,785
"The earth is my mother
and the sky my father."

405
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:15,712
"My eyes have 
beheld many hues."

406
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,547
"But I never tied
my heart to anyone."

407
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:25,858
"I swim in the
waters like the swans."

408
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:31,072
"I feel that the
whole world is my own."

409
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:36,044
"The earth is my mother
and the sky my father."

410
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:41,458
"I feel that the
whole world is my own."

411
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,662
Greetings sir.

412
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,386
Greetings.
- Greetings, madam.

413
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:57,587
Greetings, sir,

414
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,552
Greetings.
- Greetings, madam.

415
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:01,715
How are you?
- Listen.

416
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:06,306
Give sister these offerings first.
She'll be very happy.

417
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:08,769
Sister!

418
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,615
Glory to God! Are you all back?

419
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:13,097
Bless you.

420
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:17,185
I wasn't so lucky and
was home with this ailment.

421
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:20,831
That's why we've brought
extra offerings for you.

422
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:22,995
Keep quiet!
- Why are you silencing her?

423
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:24,880
She said it and I heard it.

424
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,403
Are offerings something to
satiate one's hunger with?

425
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,006
Just a little is enough.

426
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:31,732
Durga, did you hear what
your lovable daughter said?

427
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:35,099
She has become still naughtier after
returning from the pilgrimage!

428
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,505
Isn't she your lovable too?
- Leave it!

429
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:42,672
What can we do,
sister? It's her nature.

430
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:48,764
That's why I pray to God
to give her some sense!

431
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:49,965
Do you understand?

432
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,694
But neither do I have any
ailment nor have I become old.

433
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:56,400
So, I don't need any sense.

434
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,423
Do you understand?
- Stop it!

435
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,145
Go away!

436
00:35:00,226 --> 00:35:01,409
Ganga, do you see?

437
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:04,072
As soon as she returned home
she's started taunting me!

438
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:07,440
That is why I'm telling you to
get her married and see her off.

439
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,923
Do you understand?

440
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:13,447
Shyam.. Where's Shyam?

441
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:16,257
Jai Ram, where's Shyam?

442
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,281
Why are you looking here? 
Go out and see.

443
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,969
Shall I break some more?
- No, this is enough.

444
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,616
You've taken all of them!
Give me one to eat.

445
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,019
Here.

446
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:09,236
It's very sour.

447
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,243
What's your name?
- Meera.

448
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:15,928
Very nice name. 
Where do you live?

449
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:17,331
There.

450
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:21,955
What will you do with all 
these mangoes? - I'll make pickle.

451
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,979
Pickle?

452
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:28,071
Yes, my mother makes
really nice pickle.

453
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,077
I just love pickles.

454
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,442
Then come with me.
- Ok.

455
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:50,754
Where could he have gone?
I'm getting so worried!

456
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,518
Why are you getting worried?

457
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:55,242
It's rightly said that people
invite trouble upon themselves.

458
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:59,090
If you're so worried tell Jai
Ram to go and search for him.

459
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,676
Mom, here comes your new guest.

460
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:14,438
Come, son.

461
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,527
Ask him where he'd been! - I was
strolling around in the settlement.

462
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:19,888
It was very nice. - Really!

463
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,213
You should have
informed us before going!

464
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,696
Right, aunt?
- Let it be.

465
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:26,182
Okay. Don't scold him.

466
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:28,786
But we were getting
very worried for you.

467
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:31,911
She's Radha's aunt.

468
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:34,435
That's enough. 
Don't come too close.

469
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:36,160
Bless you.

470
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:40,007
Come on, Shyam. 
You must be tired.

471
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:42,412
Come and have a bath.

472
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:49,136
O God, she was 
praising him so much!

473
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,789
That he's very
simple and good looking!

474
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,953
Who knows where she found
him and brought him here from!

475
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,919
We don't even know
about his caste or parents!

476
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:59,765
But she's attending to him!
'Come and take a bath'!

477
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,927
I've to take a bath
before my prayers.

478
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:04,454
Don't you understand?

479
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:09,904
Jai Ram!

480
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,547
Jai Ram!
- Yes, dear?

481
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:16,778
Shyam, mom's new guest is
going to the bathroom for a bath.

482
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,600
Dear, I've kept water
for him there.

483
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,646
There's that itching
grass at the backyard..

484
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:24,169
Should I put some 
in the water? - Yes.

485
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,854
That'll be real fun!

486
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:28,136
Shyam will dance like a monkey!

487
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:34,309
But if anyone finds out,
I'll take your name.

488
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,435
Don't mention my name. - Don't
worry, nobody will find out.

489
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,000
I'll be right back.
- Go.

490
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:56,150
Boy, why are you 
going in there?

491
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:57,874
To have a bath.

492
00:38:57,954 --> 00:39:01,681
I'll have a bath first! You go
and take your bath at the well.

493
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:04,126
I'm getting late for
my prayers. Understand?

494
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:05,970
I understand, aunt.
- He understood!

495
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,454
But where's the well?
- On my head!

496
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:09,878
The well is outside!

497
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:12,501
He wants to bathe 
in the bathroom!

498
00:39:12,902 --> 00:39:14,345
Fool!

499
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,156
Shyam, you? Here?

500
00:39:20,236 --> 00:39:22,320
Yes. I had gone 
inside to bathe.

501
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,805
But aunt said she was
getting late. So I came here.

502
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,126
What?

503
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,370
Aunt?

504
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,920
I'll die! O God!

505
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:33,179
What happened?

506
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,307
My whole body is itching!
- Itching?

507
00:39:39,993 --> 00:39:41,797
What happened, sister?

508
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:43,821
Sister. - What?

509
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,165
What happened?
- Itching?

510
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:50,092
Sister has developed itching!
Call the doctor!

511
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:52,256
Is anybody there?

512
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:55,983
It's itching.
- Call somebody.

513
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,828
You'll be fine, sister.

514
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:02,636
What are you waiting for?
Go and bring the cow dung!

515
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:04,360
Go.
- The cow dung is ready.

516
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,985
Sister, apply this cow dung.

517
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:08,647
Everything will be okay.
- Cow dung? No.

518
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:14,178
Its cow dung. You'll be fine.

519
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:36,900
Glory to Lord Krishna.

520
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:41,349
Sister.

521
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,082
Sister. - What's it?

522
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:51,327
Nandu says the 
priest has fever..

523
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,291
..and won't be ale to
read the Ramayana today.

524
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:57,139
It had to happen today! As it is,
I was troubled by this itching.

525
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:58,901
And I won't even get to
listen to the Ramayana now!

526
00:40:58,982 --> 00:41:00,665
Shall I read it out to you?

527
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:02,910
Even I can read it.

528
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,234
But when the priest reads it
you feel a sort of peace..

529
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:07,118
..which you won't get
when you or I read it.

530
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,562
Hail, Sita and Ram. 
As you wish.

531
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:12,608
Something's really 
wrong today! - Listen.

532
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:14,532
What to listen now?

533
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:23,877
"You are holy and
erase all sorrows."

534
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:31,998
"O son of Dashrath,
you are immortal."

535
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:43,639
"Hail, Lord Ram!"

536
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:59,161
"Whatever happens is
already destined to happen."

537
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,102
"Who can go against 
your will?"

538
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:12,721
"Hail, Lord Ram!"

539
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:18,682
"Lord Ram..
- Hail, Lord Ram!"

540
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:34,203
"Patience, duty, 
friend and women.."

541
00:42:36,643 --> 00:42:42,104
"..are appraised 
during bad times."

542
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:47,763
"Hail, Lord Ram!"

543
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:53,565
"Lord Ram.
- Hail, Lord Ram!"

544
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:09,246
"No matter what happens,
always tread the path of truth."

545
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:17,006
"If you're ignorant, you won't
receive the divine message."

546
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:28,487
"Lord Ram.
- Hail, Lord Ram!"

547
00:43:37,608 --> 00:43:43,648
"As per one's thoughts.."

548
00:43:46,368 --> 00:43:51,809
"..one gets rewards from God."

549
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:56,849
"Hail, Lord Ram!"

550
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:03,330
"Lord Ram..
- Hail, Lord Ram!"

551
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:18,770
"Lord is immortal and
his tales are unending."

552
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:26,612
"Everyone, from commoner
to saint, chants his name."

553
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:31,811
"Hail, Lord Ram!"

554
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:38,133
"Lord Ram..
- Hail, Lord Ram!"

555
00:44:38,213 --> 00:44:44,173
"Hail, Lord Ram!"

556
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,759
Bless you, son.

557
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:52,964
Ganga, protect 
him from all evil.

558
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:57,649
Such a nice voice
and song! I was amazed!

559
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,332
Bless you, son.

560
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:03,216
I've never even
looked at you properly.

561
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:07,660
He has a glow on his face,
like a sage's son.

562
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,065
Shyam, where did you learn to
recite the Ramayana so nicely?

563
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:15,429
Sir, from no one. Hearing it
in temples and from pilgrims

564
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:18,151
I remembered what I
liked and recited it.

565
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:22,517
Had Radha been here,
it'd have been so nice.

566
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:28,084
She would have stopped
troubling you from today.

567
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,246
Where's she?

568
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:40,338
Where are you taking me, sister? 
Why aren't you telling me?

569
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:43,021
It's not something
to tell, but to show.

570
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,425
Meera?

571
00:45:47,546 --> 00:45:48,867
Shyam?

572
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:52,230
Why didn't you tell
me that you live here?

573
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:54,674
I forgot. Did your
mother make the pickle?

574
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:58,038
Yes. And she said that,
as soon as it's ready..

575
00:45:58,118 --> 00:45:59,759
..I should give it to you first.

576
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,164
Radha, are you going? You
didn't even show me that thing.

577
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:09,571
You've already seen that
thing and even know him!

578
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:17,995
Thakur Durga Prasad, 
about turn!

579
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:22,586
Colonel! Come, we
were waiting for you.

580
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,710
Look.
- Wow!

581
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,234
I'm sorry. Last night I went
to a friend's house for dinner.

582
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:33,018
That's why I couldn't come.
Where are your family members?

583
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:36,120
My sister, my
sister-in-law and my daughter.

584
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:38,604
Ganga!
- Coming!

585
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:41,527
Bring the offerings!
- Yes!

586
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:44,410
You just keep saying
'coming' and 'bringing'!

587
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,492
Come on, make your move.

588
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:49,335
Let me think.

589
00:46:51,098 --> 00:46:52,298
C'mon.

590
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:56,744
Colonel, speak softly.
- Okay.

591
00:46:57,225 --> 00:46:59,467
Here, brother. The
Goddess's offerings.

592
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:03,351
Glory to the Goddess!
- Hail.

593
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:08,357
Brother, how did you live without
playing chess from last four days?

594
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:09,959
I was very sad.

595
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:12,583
Where's our little machine gun?

596
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:16,887
Your lovable?
- Yes.

597
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,289
There she comes.

598
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,614
Good morning.
- Good morning, colonel uncle.

599
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:25,536
Come here!

600
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,760
Why did you say 
'good morning' so morosely?

601
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:31,504
Did you lose to someone?

602
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:35,187
If anyone has told you anything, then
tell me! I'll teach him a lesson!

603
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:38,552
Then teach mom and dad a lesson!
- What? Why?

604
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:40,914
You had brought him
from the carnival!

605
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:43,757
Whom did you bring from the
carnival? - Their new recruit.

606
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:48,763
Wow! Our daughter speaks
perfect military language!

607
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:51,165
Who's he?

608
00:47:51,846 --> 00:47:53,809
He's an orphan boy.

609
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,833
But he sings very well.

610
00:47:56,492 --> 00:47:59,495
Sister is mesmerized 
by his voice.

611
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:03,980
Beware! I won't
lose listening to you.

612
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:06,823
Here's my move.

613
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:11,307
Sister-in-law, why are you
standing here like the Taj Mahal?

614
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,792
Go and arrange for some tea.
- I'll bring it.

615
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:18,435
Also arrange for food.
- And some sweets.

616
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:22,359
So your important 
work has started!

617
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:25,403
It's only chess all the time!

618
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:29,729
What's there in chess that you
two forget about the household..

619
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,372
..and concentrate only on it?

620
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,454
You too learn it, aunt. At least
there'll be some peace in the house..

621
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:36,336
..if not in the entire world.

622
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:37,818
Listen to her!

623
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:42,063
I'm talking to you two but
she's giving the answers!

624
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,687
Her height is so small,
but her tongue is so long!

625
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:49,173
Brother, why don't
you 'court masala' her?

626
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:53,756
Sister, not 'court masala',
but 'court martial'.

627
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:56,720
Yes. Didn't you understand?

628
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,081
No, he didn't.

629
00:48:58,442 --> 00:48:59,683
Did you hear this, brother?

630
00:48:59,764 --> 00:49:04,190
This is why I say get her
married and rid this house of her!

631
00:49:04,248 --> 00:49:05,810
Don't you understand?

632
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,051
Quiet!

633
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:36,805
Why did you make that move,
colonel?

634
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:39,368
Even Jai Ram can think
of better moves than that.

635
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:41,851
Here goes your queen.

636
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:46,415
Who's playing the flute?
- Their new recruit.

637
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,940
Look, he ruined your move!

638
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,783
Anyone there? Go and
call that flute player.

639
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:54,265
I'll teach him a lesson!

640
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:55,626
Really, uncle?
- Yes.

641
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:58,270
I'll call him right away.
- Yes, hurry up.

642
00:50:03,555 --> 00:50:04,716
Come.

643
00:50:05,558 --> 00:50:07,840
Where? - Colonel uncle 
has called you.

644
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,083
Who's colonel uncle?

645
00:50:10,283 --> 00:50:12,525
Come with me, you'll
find out everything.

646
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:28,949
Were you playing 
the flute? - Yes.

647
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,666
Why were you playing it?

648
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:33,509
I play it whenever I feel like.

649
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:37,754
What's your name?
- Shyam.

650
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:41,439
Even if your name is Shyam,
that doesn't mean..

651
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,122
..you should keep playing
the flute like Lord Krishna.

652
00:50:45,403 --> 00:50:49,046
What's your education?
- I'm completely illiterate.

653
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:53,773
Illiterate? When my
son was of your age..

654
00:50:53,853 --> 00:50:56,215
..he had cleared his
10th standard exams.

655
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,639
After that, he did his B.A.
and is a captain in the army now.

656
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:03,103
Shyam!
- Yes.

657
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:05,327
Will you study? - Yes, sir.

658
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,628
Let me finish talking first!

659
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:11,432
Listen, your flute 
made me lose.

660
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:16,237
I'll punish you for this.
Come here!

661
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,844
Play the flute again.
- What?

662
00:51:23,006 --> 00:51:27,651
Yes, my child. If a
flute can win my heart..

663
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:32,857
..and make me lose in chess
then there must be magic in it.

664
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:34,537
Well done, son!

665
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,782
I salute you!

666
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:49,996
Sir, whenever you call me I come
running here from Sudama shanty.

667
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:54,241
I tried to teach Radha twice.

668
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:58,245
First time, she welcomed
me with a thorny plant.

669
00:51:58,269 --> 00:52:03,469
My hands were 
swollen for 4 days.

670
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:06,614
And the second time,
with an itching plant.

671
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:09,659
Have a seat, teacher.

672
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:11,401
How strange!

673
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,144
I'm telling you about my
problems but you're laughing!

674
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:20,110
But I won't deny your request.

675
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:24,415
But you'll have to be
present when I teach her.

676
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:26,156
It's very important.

677
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:28,519
I was laughing 
at Radha's mischief.

678
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,924
But Mr. Narayan Das, 
I haven't called you..

679
00:52:32,003 --> 00:52:33,766
..to teach Radha, but Shyam.

680
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:35,086
Who's Shyam?

681
00:52:35,687 --> 00:52:39,492
Radha's mother has brought an
orphan boy from our pilgrimage.

682
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:41,334
We thought that if he
learns something it'll be..

683
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,895
..good for his future.

684
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:46,740
How nice of you, sir.
- I'll call him right now.

685
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,662
Shyam.

686
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:51,706
Yes, sir? - Come, dear.

687
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:56,311
Shyam, you wish to 
study, right? - Yes, a lot.

688
00:52:56,711 --> 00:53:00,075
He's Mr. Narayan Das,
your teacher from today.

689
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:03,639
Greetings.
- Bless you, son.

690
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,284
If you concentrate on your
studies you'll be very successful.

691
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,929
So, shall we start your
studies from tomorrow?

692
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:13,370
As you wish.

693
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,476
Where would you like to study?

694
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:21,579
This open place, 
amidst nature.

695
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,905
This secluded place will
be perfect for studies.

696
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:53,929
Son. - Yes?
Write 'Om' first. Like this.

697
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:10,355
It's a miracle! You've
written 'Om' so beautifully!

698
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:14,079
Before starting
anything auspicious..

699
00:54:14,279 --> 00:54:18,324
..it's very important
to take god's blessings.

700
00:54:31,658 --> 00:54:36,985
Some naughty boy is
pelting stones from the tree!

701
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:40,709
Come, let's go to 
some other place.

702
00:54:43,312 --> 00:54:46,716
'Lord Hanuman saves his
devotees from all calamities.'

703
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,201
Meera, you?

704
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:54,124
Where's Shyam?
- Why?

705
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:56,806
Mother has sent 
pickle for him.

706
00:54:57,008 --> 00:54:59,731
You and aunt are so
concerned for Shyam.

707
00:54:59,811 --> 00:55:03,855
Yes. I told you that he
had plucked mangoes for me.

708
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,298
Yes. So, he has an
absolute right on this pickle.

709
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,742
But he has started
studying from today.

710
00:55:09,822 --> 00:55:12,064
Look, the teacher 
is teaching him.

711
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,867
So you shouldn't disturb him,
right? - Not at all.

712
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:17,830
Then give this pickle to me.
I'll give it to him.

713
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:20,615
I'll tell him that
aunt has sent it. Okay?

714
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:23,958
Yes, that'll be fine. 
Okay, I'm going now.

715
00:55:41,827 --> 00:55:46,520
These alphabets
contain all knowledge..

716
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:49,227
..and form the word order.

717
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:53,071
So, I instruct you to
memorize these alphabets.

718
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,994
I'll memorize them
right away and tell you.

719
00:55:55,073 --> 00:55:58,316
Catch the butterfly!

720
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:00,520
Where are you fleeing? 
Come here!

721
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:03,244
God! Catch it!

722
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:04,665
Greetings, teacher.

723
00:56:04,725 --> 00:56:08,048
Where are you fleeing?
Come here! It's come!

724
00:56:08,128 --> 00:56:09,810
Hail Lord, save me.

725
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:19,101
Radha! 
- I was chasing the butterfly.

726
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,543
Okay son, today's 
session is over.

727
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:23,567
If possible, 
memorize the chapters.

728
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:25,147
Bye, teacher.

729
00:57:22,092 --> 00:57:23,373
Won't you speak?

730
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:29,901
Okay, don't speak! I
too won't say anything!

731
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:51,124
Brother Shyam!

732
00:57:52,366 --> 00:57:54,047
Shyam!

733
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:56,851
Shyam!

734
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:00,656
I've been yelling out
your name since so long!

735
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,617
What are you looking at here?

736
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:07,182
That river. - Yes, even 
I can see the river.

737
00:58:07,263 --> 00:58:09,385
The river and the water in the
river. And the fishes in the water.

738
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:11,067
There are crocodiles too in
this river. Do you get it?

739
00:58:11,148 --> 00:58:12,629
Come, let's go home.

740
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:14,471
Home! Come on!

741
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:18,817
Shyam. - Yes.

742
00:58:18,836 --> 00:58:21,118
How did your studies go?
- Very nicely.

743
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,642
I've learnt to read and
write a lot of things.

744
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:26,204
Well done!
- Did you hear that?

745
00:58:26,564 --> 00:58:28,367
And our daughter 
used to say that..

746
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:31,569
..Mr. Narayan Das
doesn't know how to teach!

747
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:33,834
By the way, where's she?

748
00:58:33,853 --> 00:58:35,655
Did she have her food?
- No.

749
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:38,497
No? Then call her.

750
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:41,181
I can never understand her!

751
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:43,383
When I went to call her,
she said that..

752
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:46,427
..she wouldn't eat
until Shyam speaks to her.

753
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,439
Radha!

754
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:07,491
Radha, are you angry with me?

755
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:12,456
Your dad just sat down to eat.
Come, you eat a little too.

756
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:15,620
Are you still angry?

757
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:21,944
Okay, I apologise with 
folded hands. Come now at least.

758
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,514
So you won't come 
or speak to me?

759
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:31,338
Okay.

760
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:35,603
You don't like my
staying here, right?

761
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:38,286
Okay then, I'll leave
this house and go away.

762
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,810
What's the matter, dear?

763
01:00:21,855 --> 01:00:25,380
I can't see Shyam anywhere.

764
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:26,962
Don't worry about him.

765
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:29,984
He does whatever he likes
and goes wherever he wants.

766
01:00:30,065 --> 01:00:31,426
What?

767
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:35,030
Does it mean that if he says
he'd leave then he'd really do so?

768
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,874
He's just like the birds.

769
01:00:37,898 --> 01:00:39,898
This branch today 
and that branch tomorrow.

770
01:00:40,075 --> 01:00:41,757
You can't trust him.

771
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,001
No.

772
01:01:08,025 --> 01:01:10,425
My clothes? 
I had kept them here.

773
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:20,761
Radha, what are 
you doing here?

774
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:23,525
Why did you come here?
- I like bathing here.

775
01:01:23,605 --> 01:01:25,487
And I like sitting here.

776
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:27,208
Give me my clothes.
- No!

777
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,414
Brother Shyam, come fast!
Where are you?

778
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:33,695
Your teacher has come!
- Give me my clothes fast!

779
01:01:33,776 --> 01:01:35,298
Your clothes? No!

780
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:38,142
You'll first have to
agree to everything I say.

781
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:39,663
Okay, I beg you!

782
01:01:39,744 --> 01:01:41,065
My teacher has come!
Please, give me my clothes!

783
01:01:41,145 --> 01:01:45,050
Okay then, promise me that you'll
never leave our house and go.

784
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:47,192
Okay, I'll never even
mention it. My clothes.

785
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:51,797
You'll always answer anything I ask
and won't remain silent and angry.

786
01:01:51,877 --> 01:01:53,059
Do you agree?

787
01:01:53,078 --> 01:01:55,280
I agree. Give my clothes now.

788
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:57,963
When you sit with teacher to
study you won't sit alone..

789
01:01:57,987 --> 01:01:59,524
..but will let me sit
with you and study too.

790
01:01:59,525 --> 01:02:01,488
Yes. What? Will you too study?

791
01:02:01,568 --> 01:02:03,330
Don't ask questions, say yes.

792
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,974
Okay, you can sit and study too.
Give my clothes now at least.

793
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:11,234
And, at the carnival, you
won't favor anyone else..

794
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:14,183
..to sit on my favorite horse.

795
01:02:14,262 --> 01:02:16,666
Not at all. Do you
want to ask anything else?

796
01:02:16,745 --> 01:02:19,148
No. Yes, one more thing.

797
01:02:19,588 --> 01:02:22,092
You won't pluck 
mangoes for anyone.

798
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:23,913
And if you want 
to eat pickles..

799
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:27,718
..then you'll eat the
ones made at home by aunt.

800
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:29,279
Yes, I agree to everything.

801
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,762
I'll stop eating pickles.
Give my clothes now.

802
01:02:34,165 --> 01:02:35,486
Give me.

803
01:02:40,933 --> 01:02:45,658
Dad, help!

804
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,185
I'll die!

805
01:02:53,427 --> 01:02:54,588
Oh God!

806
01:03:08,604 --> 01:03:11,407
What happened? Are you hurt?

807
01:03:28,747 --> 01:03:29,987
My clothes!

808
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,074
'Cat, bat, rat, mat.'

809
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:38,198
'Pen, hen, ten, men.'

810
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:42,383
Wow! You've written what I
haven't even taught you!

811
01:03:42,482 --> 01:03:47,207
Son of Goddess Saraswati you're
like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar!

812
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:48,689
Great!

813
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:50,771
Greetings, teacher.
- Greetings.

814
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:53,655
I too will study.
- Will you?

815
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,857
How strange!

816
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:58,881
So God has given you 
some sense at last.

817
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,944
You're grown up now..

818
01:04:02,024 --> 01:04:04,427
..and it's really
necessary for you to study.

819
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,669
Sit down.

820
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:15,400
You ruined my alphabets!
- I didn't do it purposely.

821
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,802
Children, stop 
talking and write.

822
01:04:21,846 --> 01:04:23,487
Till where have you read?

823
01:04:24,129 --> 01:04:27,693
Till the 7th chapter.
- The 7th chapter?

824
01:04:34,822 --> 01:04:38,386
Ok, chapter 7.

825
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:45,073
Write this 8th chapter now.

826
01:04:46,034 --> 01:04:47,276
Well done!

827
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,300
Okay son, it's now time
for me to go to school.

828
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:20,324
I'm going.

829
01:05:23,597 --> 01:05:25,198
What happened, teacher?

830
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:30,422
Nothing, dear. I feel as if 
something is jumping around.

831
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:33,208
A frog!

832
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,772
So this was your doing!

833
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:40,336
I'll go and tell your dad that..

834
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:43,578
..you haven't stopped
your mischief even now!

835
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,943
I'll go right now! 
And inform him.

836
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:49,025
Bye, teacher.
- Bye!

837
01:05:49,426 --> 01:05:51,829
Teacher, listen!

838
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:56,114
This was wrong of you, Radha!
- What did I do?

839
01:05:56,194 --> 01:05:59,718
Such a big teacher got
scared of such a small frog!

840
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:01,200
So what's my fault in that?

841
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:03,224
Leave all that..

842
01:06:03,722 --> 01:06:06,005
..play the flute.
- Not at all!

843
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:07,565
Please, play it.

844
01:06:07,646 --> 01:06:10,550
Radha, you've insulted teacher!
I won't play the flute!

845
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,413
Then don't play it! I
too won't let you study!

846
01:06:13,493 --> 01:06:16,175
Not today, tomorrow 
or day after!

847
01:07:34,185 --> 01:07:36,267
Radha, I was coming 
to meet you.

848
01:07:36,467 --> 01:07:40,190
But Shyam plays the
flute so nicely. Right?

849
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:42,633
Come, you listen too.

850
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,120
Radha!

851
01:07:50,883 --> 01:07:51,964
Radha!

852
01:07:52,044 --> 01:07:54,848
Play it for her!

853
01:07:55,288 --> 01:07:56,370
Radha!

854
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:58,130
Play it!

855
01:08:58,992 --> 01:09:05,239
"Shyam, your flute.."

856
01:09:08,403 --> 01:09:20,376
"..calls out the 
name of Radha."

857
01:09:27,624 --> 01:09:37,274
"Shyam, your flute.."

858
01:09:39,156 --> 01:09:49,006
"..calls out the 
name of Radha."

859
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:56,295
"But people slander
Meera for no reason."

860
01:10:02,101 --> 01:10:07,810
"Shyam, your flute calls
out the name of Radha."

861
01:10:07,868 --> 01:10:13,474
"Shyam, your flute calls
out the name of Radha."

862
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:19,240
"But people slander
Meera for no reason."

863
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:25,007
"But people slander
Meera for no reason."

864
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:30,613
"The Lord's flute is
just meant for playing."

865
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:36,379
"The Lord's flute is
just meant for playing."

866
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:42,185
"If Shyam belongs to Radha,
then he belongs to Meera too."

867
01:10:42,265 --> 01:10:47,912
"If Shyam belongs to Radha,
then he belongs to Meera too."

868
01:11:07,774 --> 01:11:13,419
"The waves of the Yamuna
and the shades of the trees"

869
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:19,306
"Everything 
belongs to Krishna."

870
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:27,474
"The waves of the Yamuna
and the shades of the trees."

871
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:33,201
"Everything belongs to Krishna."

872
01:11:33,281 --> 01:11:38,910
"All the residents of Brij
are frenzied about Shyam."

873
01:11:38,967 --> 01:11:44,533
"All the residents of Brij
are frenzied about Shyam."

874
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:50,220
"But people slander
Meera for no reason."

875
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:55,926
"The lord's flute is
just meant for playing."

876
01:11:55,946 --> 01:12:01,793
"The lord's flute is
just meant for playing."

877
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:13,245
"If Shyam belongs to Radha,
then he belongs to Meera too."

878
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:38,793
"No one knows who the
flute calls out to."

879
01:12:38,873 --> 01:12:45,279
"It sings the praises of
whoever it's attracted to."

880
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:52,888
"No one knows who the
flute calls out to."

881
01:12:58,655 --> 01:13:07,005
"Who doesn't like the
sound of the flute?"

882
01:13:07,063 --> 01:13:12,630
"If Shyam belongs to Radha,
then he belongs to Meera too."

883
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:17,795
"Shyam, your flute calls out.."

884
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:29,448
"..the name of Radha."

885
01:13:29,528 --> 01:13:37,938
"Shyam, your flute calls
out the name of Radha."

886
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:46,221
Meera!

887
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:47,945
Radha!

888
01:13:48,426 --> 01:13:49,669
Meera!

889
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:52,036
Meera, please forgive me!

890
01:13:52,116 --> 01:13:53,398
Radha!

891
01:13:55,484 --> 01:13:57,048
Meera!
- Radha!

892
01:13:57,129 --> 01:13:58,571
Meera!

893
01:13:59,094 --> 01:14:01,139
Meera, please forgive me!

894
01:14:18,283 --> 01:14:22,716
Ram Kishen, you haven't paid
your tax since the last 6 years.

895
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:28,740
I'll exempt half of it, but you'll
have to pay half. - Yes, sir.

896
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,836
Hello Sir, letter for you.

897
01:14:30,915 --> 01:14:33,320
Come, Lakhan.
I was waiting for you.

898
01:14:33,562 --> 01:14:35,407
I'm expecting
replies to many letters.

899
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:38,415
For me, your letter
is like a telegram.

900
01:14:38,535 --> 01:14:40,660
As soon as I get it,
I bring it here.

901
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:48,279
Accountant. - Yes?
- There's good news.

902
01:14:48,303 --> 01:14:51,903
The boy's family has written 
from Motipur. - Congratulations, sir!

903
01:14:53,212 --> 01:14:54,857
Give Lakhan a tip.

904
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:58,425
Lakhan always 
brings good news.

905
01:14:58,506 --> 01:15:02,236
Sister, where's everybody?

906
01:15:02,637 --> 01:15:04,481
Look, there's a letter
from Motipur.

907
01:15:04,562 --> 01:15:07,529
Landlord Rampal Singh 
is very rich.

908
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:11,580
His son is very handsome, 22 years
old and their horoscopes match.

909
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,186
Our Radha will live
like a queen there.

910
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:16,512
Hail Sita and Ram! Oh God!

911
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:21,044
Brother, I knew that, this time
God would definitely listen to me!

912
01:15:21,164 --> 01:15:24,492
The boy will be coming to
see Radha with his uncle..

913
01:15:24,693 --> 01:15:27,420
..by the 4 o'clock train.
- Good!

914
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:30,268
Sister, may God make
this marriage take place.

915
01:15:30,348 --> 01:15:32,233
God will always 
do what's right.

916
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:34,900
But our hospitality 
should be classy.

917
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,083
Yes.

918
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:37,485
Bindu.
- Yes, aunt?

919
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:40,917
Go and tell Nathu to
massage the horse with oil..

920
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:42,780
..and clean the cart
and keep it ready.

921
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:45,604
And tell the accountant,
that the train will arrive at 4..

922
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,231
..and he should reach
there on time.

923
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,534
Understand? - Yes, aunt.

924
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:49,698
Go.

925
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,026
I will call the colonel right
now and discuss the finances.

926
01:15:54,109 --> 01:15:55,552
Listen.

927
01:15:56,796 --> 01:15:59,122
Send Shyam with 
the accountant.

928
01:16:00,004 --> 01:16:02,449
There should be someone from
the family to receive them.

929
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:04,175
Yes, you're right.

930
01:16:05,498 --> 01:16:08,987
Ganga, my Radha is
really very fortunate.

931
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:11,714
Dress her in that
beautiful red sari..

932
01:16:11,794 --> 01:16:14,200
..and deck her up
with a lot of jewelry.

933
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:16,085
Understand?
- Yes.

934
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:19,493
Listen! What have you
decided about the food?

935
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:24,788
You make such nice sweets.
Go and make that.

936
01:16:24,868 --> 01:16:26,672
And we have almond 
sherbet with us.

937
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,998
We'll serve that first and
decide about dinner later.

938
01:16:29,079 --> 01:16:31,404
Understand?
- Yes.

939
01:16:31,485 --> 01:16:33,249
What time does the 
train arrive? - 4 o'clock.

940
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,492
4 o'clock? Oh God!

941
01:16:34,573 --> 01:16:38,302
Jai Ram! Bindu! 
Where are you all?

942
01:16:38,383 --> 01:16:41,029
The train arrives at 4 o'clock!
Finish everything quickly!

943
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:54,343
What happened, dear?

944
01:16:54,544 --> 01:16:57,052
Jai Ram, the clock..

945
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:59,918
Yes, the clock is nice.
I can see it.

946
01:16:59,942 --> 01:17:03,842
It had stopped and I was winding it. 
Nobody's bothered!

947
01:17:03,888 --> 01:17:05,372
I understood.

948
01:17:05,773 --> 01:17:10,746
But no one should know
that I wound the clock. - No.

949
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,312
Don't worry, 
even if nobody asks..

950
01:17:13,392 --> 01:17:16,320
..I won't say that you
didn't wind the clock. - What?

951
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:18,485
Jai Ram.
- Yes?

952
01:17:18,726 --> 01:17:20,571
There.
- Yes, there.

953
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,664
Thakur.
- Yes, sir?

954
01:17:25,744 --> 01:17:29,233
We'll have to ask Mr. Durga.
- What?

955
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:32,241
Why did he play such a
cruel joke on us? - Why did he?

956
01:17:32,321 --> 01:17:35,608
Neither did he send a cart nor any
man to the station to receive us.

957
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:39,459
I'm exhausted 
walking in the sun!

958
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:43,950
Sir, don't worry. Phoolpur is
just a little distance away.

959
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:45,475
Little distance?

960
01:17:45,555 --> 01:17:49,325
Where is it?
- Look there, near those fields.

961
01:17:49,405 --> 01:17:54,337
Sir, by the grace of God
you've got a chance to walk.

962
01:17:54,418 --> 01:17:58,748
It'll be good for your health.

963
01:17:58,772 --> 01:18:00,772
How strange!

964
01:18:01,716 --> 01:18:06,970
Lulla, if you're tired,
shall I carry you? - No!

965
01:18:07,612 --> 01:18:09,977
Who's this 
ill-mannered person?

966
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:11,982
Go and see, Thakur.

967
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,311
Girl, can't you see?

968
01:18:15,335 --> 01:18:19,735
Motipur's landlord Rampal
Singh's brother-in-law landlord

969
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:24,415
Dharamjeet Singh and
his son Lalpal Singh..

970
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,422
..alias Lulla, have come
to this village today!

971
01:18:28,826 --> 01:18:34,480
Yes, you're being talked
about a lot in Phoolpur.

972
01:18:34,561 --> 01:18:36,325
What?
- Yes.

973
01:18:36,806 --> 01:18:40,335
A lot of arrangements are
being made there for your welcome.

974
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:45,388
You've come to see landlord Durga's
only daughter Radha, right? - Yes.

975
01:18:45,629 --> 01:18:48,637
Go straight that way.

976
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,805
Maybe number 13 will
be lucky for the girl.

977
01:18:53,209 --> 01:18:54,773
Number 13? What do you mean?

978
01:18:54,853 --> 01:18:58,422
I mean, your number is 13.

979
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:01,470
From 1 to 13. 
Don't you understand?

980
01:19:01,494 --> 01:19:04,894
No, we don't. 
- I shouldn't tell you..

981
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,608
..that 12 boys have come
before you and refused.

982
01:19:09,851 --> 01:19:11,736
You too will find it
out for yourselves.

983
01:19:12,057 --> 01:19:16,027
If one has been deceived once he
should take every step carefully.

984
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:18,996
Why are you talking in riddles?

985
01:19:19,076 --> 01:19:22,044
Tell us clearly what
you want to say. - Yes.

986
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:26,134
I will, but don't tell them
that Kamli told you all this.

987
01:19:26,214 --> 01:19:28,099
No, we won't.

988
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:30,866
What's the matter?

989
01:19:32,831 --> 01:19:37,644
They won't show you the girl.

990
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:43,138
Why? - Because poor
Radha is a little dark.

991
01:19:43,218 --> 01:19:45,223
She's dark!
- Dark!

992
01:19:46,065 --> 01:19:47,830
Dark!
- Yes.

993
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:51,158
She'll look better with a
bit of powder and makeup.

994
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,246
But it'll be difficult
to cure her eye ailment.

995
01:19:54,407 --> 01:19:56,571
What? She has an eye ailment?

996
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:59,901
Thakur, you said she
was very beautiful!

997
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,925
She was beautiful.

998
01:20:02,788 --> 01:20:07,160
If she didn't have chicken
pox she'd have looked better.

999
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,090
She had chicken pox too?
- It's all God's will.

1000
01:20:11,491 --> 01:20:14,378
Illness never 
heralds its arrival.

1001
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:17,747
But you can put 
on dark glasses.

1002
01:20:17,867 --> 01:20:19,992
The poor, crippled girl will
get some support at least.

1003
01:20:20,674 --> 01:20:21,757
Is she also crippled?

1004
01:20:21,837 --> 01:20:25,567
But they'll present
Radha to you in such a way..

1005
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:29,377
..that you won't
find any flaw in her.

1006
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:30,981
How?

1007
01:20:31,462 --> 01:20:35,672
Through sweets 
and almond sherbet.

1008
01:20:35,753 --> 01:20:37,959
Sweets and sherbet? Wow!

1009
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:40,044
But, after you have them..

1010
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,068
..your happiness will 
turn to sorrow. - How?

1011
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:45,297
There'll be intoxicants
mixed in the sweets and sherbet.

1012
01:20:45,378 --> 01:20:47,823
But how do you 
know all that? - Me?

1013
01:20:47,904 --> 01:20:50,030
I'm their 
maidservant's daughter.

1014
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,954
I was grinding the
intoxicants this morning.

1015
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,449
Are you all scared?
Radha's aunt is there.

1016
01:20:57,529 --> 01:21:00,696
She'll explain everything to you
properly. Don't you understand?

1017
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:06,920
Oh God! There's 
the landlord's buggy!

1018
01:21:07,555 --> 01:21:10,121
Don't mention my name. 
My respects.

1019
01:21:10,482 --> 01:21:12,327
Is that the landlord's buggy?

1020
01:21:18,182 --> 01:21:20,749
We won't go there to
be fooled! Come on!

1021
01:21:20,829 --> 01:21:23,636
Sir, please wait.
- C'mon.

1022
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:26,243
No, we won't go!

1023
01:21:26,323 --> 01:21:27,967
Please wait for my sake.

1024
01:21:28,047 --> 01:21:29,692
No!
- I'm asking you so fondly.

1025
01:21:29,772 --> 01:21:32,218
Please, agree.

1026
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:36,269
Greetings, Thakur.
- Greetings, accountant.

1027
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:37,993
Good that we met 
you on the way.

1028
01:21:38,073 --> 01:21:40,880
But why are you going
back to the station?

1029
01:21:40,961 --> 01:21:43,407
Accountant, 
what have you done?

1030
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:46,455
Why did you play 
such a joke on us?

1031
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:48,340
You didn't send anyone or
any buggy to receive us.

1032
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,067
We're tired of walking.

1033
01:21:51,227 --> 01:21:54,836
This is landlord Lalpal
Singh alias Mr. Lulla.

1034
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:58,044
Greetings. - And this is
landlord Dharamjeet Singh.

1035
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,689
He's the boy's uncle.

1036
01:21:59,769 --> 01:22:02,335
Greetings.
- I don't understand anything.

1037
01:22:02,736 --> 01:22:04,982
So this is how Durga
Prasad welcomes us!

1038
01:22:05,062 --> 01:22:06,987
We're going back! Come on!

1039
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:09,394
No, sir! I beg you!

1040
01:22:09,474 --> 01:22:11,399
Everyone's waiting 
for you there.

1041
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:13,884
And I was on my way to
the station to receive you.

1042
01:22:13,965 --> 01:22:18,136
But your train arrived
a little early today.

1043
01:22:18,336 --> 01:22:21,545
The train arrived on time.

1044
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:25,395
You are late! This
is a terrible insult!

1045
01:22:25,475 --> 01:22:27,800
We won't see the girl!
We're going back!

1046
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:29,325
Let's go!
- No, sir!

1047
01:22:29,485 --> 01:22:30,928
I'll be left nowhere!

1048
01:22:31,009 --> 01:22:33,977
I, accountant Dharam Das,
beg you in the name of virtue!

1049
01:22:34,057 --> 01:22:35,501
Please agree, sir.

1050
01:22:36,182 --> 01:22:38,330
Please, come with us.

1051
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:39,631
I bow to you.
- Stand straight!

1052
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:41,356
What are you doing?

1053
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:45,125
I've seen such melodramas before!
We won't go with you!

1054
01:22:45,366 --> 01:22:49,416
Like the way we came we'll go back
walking to the station! Come on!

1055
01:22:49,857 --> 01:22:53,427
Mr. Lulla, please don't
be so angry.

1056
01:22:53,627 --> 01:22:55,472
Everyone's waiting for
you back at the house.

1057
01:22:55,552 --> 01:22:57,758
If you don't go, 
they'll feel bad.

1058
01:22:57,838 --> 01:22:59,963
Sir, let's go. The
boy's right. Please come.

1059
01:23:00,044 --> 01:23:03,693
Okay.
- Please come.

1060
01:23:04,465 --> 01:23:06,710
It's our good fortune
that you've come here.

1061
01:23:06,831 --> 01:23:09,639
Come, son. Landlord,
please take a seat.

1062
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:14,272
Okay.
- Please forgive their mistake.

1063
01:23:14,331 --> 01:23:16,736
If anything like this
happens again, let me know.

1064
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:19,504
I'm the girl's aunt.
- Well?

1065
01:23:19,584 --> 01:23:23,434
Don't you understand?
- I understand, sister.

1066
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:25,880
Did you understand? 
You didn't.

1067
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:27,605
Touch aunt's feet.

1068
01:23:27,685 --> 01:23:29,128
My respects.
- Bless you, son.

1069
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:30,933
May you live long.

1070
01:23:31,013 --> 01:23:34,583
You and Radha will look like
Sita and Ram. Have a seat.

1071
01:23:34,863 --> 01:23:37,029
Please, take a seat.
- Jai Ram!

1072
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:39,234
Bindu! Where's everyone gone?

1073
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:41,258
I'll be right back. - Okay.

1074
01:23:43,205 --> 01:23:45,450
Your house is so nice.

1075
01:23:46,778 --> 01:23:49,578
Don't worry, 
I remember everything.

1076
01:23:49,782 --> 01:23:53,030
What are you doing there? 
Come here.

1077
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:56,519
Keep it here.

1078
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,850
Sir, these sweets are homemade.

1079
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,978
They're filled with dry fruits.

1080
01:24:04,058 --> 01:24:07,066
Radha's mother
makes them very nicely.

1081
01:24:07,146 --> 01:24:08,830
Just taste it and see.
- Yes.

1082
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:10,435
Son, you have some too.

1083
01:24:10,595 --> 01:24:12,600
Don't feel shy.
Make yourself at home.

1084
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,811
Sir, you have it too.
- We will, aunt.

1085
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:18,455
Let him rest a bit first.

1086
01:24:18,535 --> 01:24:21,644
Yes, they've walked in the sun.

1087
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:24,310
Almond sherbet has arrived too.

1088
01:24:24,873 --> 01:24:27,239
Almond sherbet?
- Yes.

1089
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,972
It's homemade. It's also
filled with dry fruits.

1090
01:24:32,052 --> 01:24:35,902
Don't you understand?
- I understood.

1091
01:24:36,062 --> 01:24:37,787
Call the girl first.

1092
01:24:37,867 --> 01:24:40,834
Wow! So the guests 
have arrived!

1093
01:24:40,915 --> 01:24:43,160
Greetings! Good morning!

1094
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:45,406
I'm retired 
colonel Sohan Singh.

1095
01:24:45,486 --> 01:24:47,411
Durga Prasad is like
my younger brother.

1096
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:49,497
Please forgive me for arriving
a little late. - Never mind.

1097
01:24:49,577 --> 01:24:51,863
People always come late here.
- What?

1098
01:24:52,264 --> 01:24:55,191
Nothing. Just call 
the girl quickly.

1099
01:24:55,271 --> 01:24:57,076
That's the reason
we called you here.

1100
01:24:57,156 --> 01:24:59,825
Yes, that's the 
custom nowadays.

1101
01:24:59,883 --> 01:25:03,412
The girl and the boy see
each other before marriage.

1102
01:25:03,853 --> 01:25:05,217
Do you understand?

1103
01:25:05,658 --> 01:25:09,508
Yes. Till then,
have something to eat.

1104
01:25:09,749 --> 01:25:12,596
Don't you understand?
- I understood, aunt.

1105
01:25:12,676 --> 01:25:14,401
Then have something.
- You eat.

1106
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:17,970
Please call the girl quickly.
We've to catch the evening train.

1107
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:20,495
The girl will come right now.

1108
01:25:20,937 --> 01:25:22,221
Thakur,
- Yes sir.

1109
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:25,892
They keep saying the girl will
be coming but don't even call her!

1110
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:29,438
That girl we met on
the road was right.

1111
01:25:29,462 --> 01:25:33,362
Sweets, almond sherbet..

1112
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:36,698
Do these people 
consider us fools?

1113
01:25:36,778 --> 01:25:38,944
What did you say?
- Nothing.

1114
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:42,713
We're just waiting for the girl.
- I won't open the door!

1115
01:25:42,793 --> 01:25:46,523
I won't come out!
- Radha, dear.

1116
01:25:48,047 --> 01:25:49,691
What's this insanity?

1117
01:25:50,493 --> 01:25:52,097
They are our guests.

1118
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:57,271
Please, come out once. You
can say no to them later.

1119
01:25:58,474 --> 01:26:00,679
Listen, dear.

1120
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:06,334
What's the matter?
The girl hasn't come till now.

1121
01:26:06,735 --> 01:26:08,780
She'll come right now.

1122
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:13,753
We agreed to show you the girl.
Isn't that enough?

1123
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:16,480
She's a girl, so
she'll obviously feel shy.

1124
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,247
And it takes time to
dress up and put on jewelry.

1125
01:26:19,327 --> 01:26:22,735
Don't you understand?
- I understand everything, sister.

1126
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:24,059
Sir.

1127
01:26:30,115 --> 01:26:32,441
Sir, there seems to
be something wrong.

1128
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,817
Please excuse me,
I'll be right back.

1129
01:26:41,223 --> 01:26:44,631
Till then, have some
sweets and the sherbet.

1130
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:47,921
Call the girl first, we'll
have everything after that.

1131
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:51,690
She'll come, but love
is something big too.

1132
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:54,117
Here, have some sweets.
- No!

1133
01:26:54,136 --> 01:26:55,420
Have some.
- No!

1134
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,865
Have some.
- No!

1135
01:26:57,946 --> 01:26:59,791
Have some.
- No!

1136
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:01,836
Colonel, you did 
the right thing.

1137
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:03,440
Lulla, why aren't
you having anything?

1138
01:27:03,521 --> 01:27:05,147
No, I won't eat.
- Here, have some sweets.

1139
01:27:05,205 --> 01:27:06,849
Sweeten your mouth.
- No!

1140
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,817
Just one more sweet.

1141
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:11,260
Have it.

1142
01:27:11,341 --> 01:27:13,907
Have some sherbet.
- Have it.

1143
01:27:14,228 --> 01:27:17,316
Okay then, have some sherbet.

1144
01:27:18,038 --> 01:27:20,484
You'll have to 
drink the sherbet.

1145
01:27:20,564 --> 01:27:23,892
That's enough, mom. - Son,
I'm not your mom but your aunt.

1146
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,096
My aunt?
- Yes.

1147
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,120
Where's the well? - Outside.

1148
01:27:27,262 --> 01:27:28,424
Why? Do you want 
to have a bath?

1149
01:27:28,505 --> 01:27:29,627
No.

1150
01:27:31,553 --> 01:27:34,400
What's happening?
- Have some sweets

1151
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:38,250
Nau, even you're eating it!
Who'll take care of us then?

1152
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:39,773
I'm there, sir. Don't worry.

1153
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:41,819
Sir, why are you 
jumping around?

1154
01:27:41,899 --> 01:27:44,746
This is a house, not a circus.
- What are you talking?

1155
01:27:44,827 --> 01:27:47,032
Something's wrong 
with my stomach!

1156
01:27:47,112 --> 01:27:50,481
I'm seeing a circus in the house!
I can see 2 uncles!

1157
01:27:50,561 --> 01:27:52,267
2 uncles?

1158
01:27:52,326 --> 01:27:55,275
You can see 2 uncles, Nau!

1159
01:27:55,334 --> 01:27:57,579
Here, have some sweets, sir.
- Get away.

1160
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:02,472
You can see 2 uncles
and I can see 2 doors!

1161
01:28:02,552 --> 01:28:06,040
The girl we met on the
way was speaking the truth!

1162
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:09,610
Colonel sir!
Colonel sir! Colonel sir!

1163
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:11,013
What?
- Yes.

1164
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,385
Remain seated, 
I'll be right back.

1165
01:28:15,465 --> 01:28:19,636
Remain seated? 
Okay, if you say so.

1166
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,406
Nau, have they gone?
- Yes.

1167
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:26,092
This is the right moment.

1168
01:28:26,173 --> 01:28:27,697
Come Lulla.
- Yes, uncle?

1169
01:28:27,897 --> 01:28:29,381
Let's go from here.
- Come on.

1170
01:28:29,461 --> 01:28:30,544
Let's go.

1171
01:28:30,624 --> 01:28:33,109
Else, the effect of the sweets
and sherbet will keep increasing.

1172
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:42,414
Where have they gone?

1173
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:48,470
Nau, wait!

1174
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:52,118
Landlord, come back!

1175
01:28:53,213 --> 01:28:56,742
Teacher's stooge, 
no studies today?

1176
01:28:59,308 --> 01:29:02,276
Are you angry with me?

1177
01:29:04,401 --> 01:29:05,884
You're having fun here.

1178
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:09,695
But do you know how angry your
parents are with your behavior today?

1179
01:29:09,775 --> 01:29:11,700
It's all because of you.
- Because of me?

1180
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,831
Why did you have to
bring them back to see me?

1181
01:29:16,071 --> 01:29:18,357
But the boy was so nice.
What wrong thing did I do?

1182
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:20,082
You won't understand
- Why?

1183
01:29:20,483 --> 01:29:21,925
Because you're stupid!

1184
01:29:30,789 --> 01:29:32,834
Good morning, Mr. Narayan Das.

1185
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:37,166
Good morning. - Where are
you going in such a hurry?

1186
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:42,590
I just taught Radha and Shyam
and am going to the school now.

1187
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,344
I'm getting late.

1188
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:47,191
What happened?
- I mean to say I'm late.

1189
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,215
Okay, you mean 
you're getting late?

1190
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:53,046
How's your student Shyam doing?
- Very well.

1191
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:56,094
Has he been given an injection?
- No.

1192
01:29:56,174 --> 01:30:00,345
I mean he's very
good and intelligent.

1193
01:30:00,425 --> 01:30:03,473
He grasps even more
than what I teach him.

1194
01:30:04,395 --> 01:30:05,758
Very good.

1195
01:30:05,839 --> 01:30:10,651
And the strange thing is
that he has also changed Radha.

1196
01:30:10,732 --> 01:30:12,496
Changed?
- Yes.

1197
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:14,381
What I mean is..

1198
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:18,191
I always thought that
Radha had no future in studies.

1199
01:30:18,215 --> 01:30:20,215
But she's changed so much now.

1200
01:30:21,118 --> 01:30:25,008
She concentrates on her studies.
I'm very satisfied.

1201
01:30:25,089 --> 01:30:26,293
Mr. Narayan Das, 
are you satisfied? - Yes.

1202
01:30:26,412 --> 01:30:29,781
You were getting something.

1203
01:30:29,861 --> 01:30:32,026
I was getting late.
- Yes, you were getting late.

1204
01:30:32,107 --> 01:30:34,914
Then you may go.
- Yes, I'll proceed.

1205
01:30:34,994 --> 01:30:36,317
Please.

1206
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:40,729
Late! Proceed!

1207
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,021
What's this?

1208
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:51,548
You keep studying
all the time! Stop it!

1209
01:30:51,587 --> 01:30:54,555
Teacher told me to stop
only when the chapter is over.

1210
01:30:54,635 --> 01:30:57,482
Remove your hand.
- I said stop, so stop.

1211
01:31:01,493 --> 01:31:03,458
Is this one of your conditions?
- Consider it that.

1212
01:31:03,538 --> 01:31:06,286
This is not fair! Every time I've
to keep agreeing to your conditions!

1213
01:31:06,305 --> 01:31:09,994
I'd have been so glad if
you'd got married to Mr. Lulla!

1214
01:31:10,034 --> 01:31:11,558
Let me tell you right now..

1215
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:15,006
..If you say such a thing
again I'll never talk to you!

1216
01:31:18,977 --> 01:31:20,501
Look at me!

1217
01:31:26,878 --> 01:31:29,765
Listen, mom was telling aunt..

1218
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:33,214
..that only a fortunate girl finds
a good husband. - That's true.

1219
01:31:33,495 --> 01:31:36,542
Even you'll find a very
good husband. - Really?

1220
01:31:37,264 --> 01:31:40,633
But for some, it turns
out to be a misfortune.

1221
01:31:41,074 --> 01:31:44,603
So many girls don't get
husbands of their choice.

1222
01:31:44,884 --> 01:31:47,410
Do you know?
- I know.

1223
01:31:48,172 --> 01:31:51,942
But my heart says that you'll
find the husband of your choice.

1224
01:31:52,223 --> 01:31:53,546
Really?
- Yes.

1225
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:55,150
Bless you!

1226
01:31:56,313 --> 01:31:58,759
But if he leaves me 
and runs away?

1227
01:32:00,043 --> 01:32:02,850
Only a fool will do that.

1228
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:06,098
But suppose he does
leave me and run away?

1229
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:08,906
Then I'll catch him
and won't let him go.

1230
01:32:08,986 --> 01:32:10,630
How?
- Like this.

1231
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:14,600
'God will do something!'

1232
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,367
He will, but you
should do something too!

1233
01:32:17,391 --> 01:32:20,191
Colonel, why are 
you running away?

1234
01:32:20,616 --> 01:32:22,781
Come here and listen to me!

1235
01:32:22,942 --> 01:32:25,588
All the village girls
are getting married!

1236
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:28,034
Even Meera is getting married!
Don't you understand?

1237
01:32:28,115 --> 01:32:30,561
I understood 
everything, sister.

1238
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:32,566
Just bring the sweets.
- Why?

1239
01:32:32,646 --> 01:32:36,517
I've found a prince for Radha.
- Really?

1240
01:32:36,536 --> 01:32:40,024
What kind of a move is this,
colonel? - It's not a move..

1241
01:32:40,226 --> 01:32:43,536
..but a miracle, Durga.
I've found a gem of a boy.

1242
01:32:43,595 --> 01:32:47,164
He's one in a million. If you
wish the wedding can be done today.

1243
01:32:47,244 --> 01:32:49,690
But who's he?
- Shyam.

1244
01:32:49,851 --> 01:32:51,695
Shyam?
- Shyam?

1245
01:32:51,776 --> 01:32:53,861
Yes.. Shyam.

1246
01:32:55,104 --> 01:32:57,189
What makes you 
think of Shyam?

1247
01:32:57,213 --> 01:33:00,813
Radha always troubles him.

1248
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,408
They're sworn enemies.
- Enemy?

1249
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:09,421
Maybe this enmity 
is called love.

1250
01:33:09,942 --> 01:33:11,987
I've seen it with my own eyes.

1251
01:33:12,188 --> 01:33:15,516
An unconditional love has
developed between them..

1252
01:33:16,038 --> 01:33:17,802
..which they might not
understand right now.

1253
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:19,527
But, after their marriage..

1254
01:33:19,551 --> 01:33:23,651
..that love will develop into
a bond that will never break.

1255
01:33:23,738 --> 01:33:28,430
And he always says
there's no son in our family.

1256
01:33:28,454 --> 01:33:33,354
He'll stay in our house both
as a son and a son-in-law.

1257
01:33:33,362 --> 01:33:37,092
Very nice. I had never
even thought about it.

1258
01:33:37,332 --> 01:33:40,683
Even I didn't.
- But I do think!

1259
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:42,466
About the people, the
norms of the world..

1260
01:33:42,546 --> 01:33:44,310
..the family's prestige
and customs and traditions.

1261
01:33:44,391 --> 01:33:47,198
I agree that Shyam is very
handsome and intelligent.

1262
01:33:47,278 --> 01:33:49,403
He also loves Radha a lot.

1263
01:33:49,484 --> 01:33:53,013
But what will you tell
people during the wedding..

1264
01:33:53,093 --> 01:33:56,622
..about who the boy's
father is and his caste?

1265
01:33:56,646 --> 01:33:58,646
Answer me! - Listen, sister.

1266
01:33:58,988 --> 01:34:01,073
Had Shyam been my son..

1267
01:34:01,154 --> 01:34:05,124
..and of my caste what
would you have said then?

1268
01:34:05,204 --> 01:34:06,648
That would have been
a different matter.

1269
01:34:06,672 --> 01:34:08,130
Then consider Shyam my son.

1270
01:34:08,131 --> 01:34:11,499
I'm ready to 
legally adopt him.

1271
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:13,344
Now tell me.

1272
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:16,231
Shyam.

1273
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,123
Shyam..

1274
01:34:36,564 --> 01:34:38,650
Madam, haven't you
gone to bed as yet?

1275
01:34:39,572 --> 01:34:42,580
You're awake yourself,
but are advising me!

1276
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:45,748
Teacher will be very
happy if I write all this.

1277
01:34:47,553 --> 01:34:49,558
Radha troubles you a lot.

1278
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,127
That's why you have to
study at night, right? - No.

1279
01:34:53,207 --> 01:34:56,414
Radha concentrates on her
studies a lot nowadays. - Really?

1280
01:34:57,097 --> 01:35:00,907
Tell me one thing,
how do you like Radha?

1281
01:35:01,188 --> 01:35:03,273
I like her lot. Why?

1282
01:35:04,436 --> 01:35:06,120
I asked just like that.

1283
01:35:06,762 --> 01:35:09,208
You haven't drunk 
your milk as yet.

1284
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,537
Here, have it. Drink
the milk and go to sleep.

1285
01:35:14,894 --> 01:35:16,779
Pampered girl..

1286
01:35:17,942 --> 01:35:20,308
..where are you going
so early in the morning?

1287
01:35:20,629 --> 01:35:22,714
You stopped me. 
I'll go and study.

1288
01:35:22,794 --> 01:35:25,521
Mr. Narayan Das has left.
So, who will you study with?

1289
01:35:25,601 --> 01:35:27,406
With Shyam.
- Shyam?

1290
01:35:27,927 --> 01:35:31,617
O God, please give
this girl some sense!

1291
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:38,354
Listen! From today, 
you won't eat..

1292
01:35:38,434 --> 01:35:40,841
..study or roam 
around with Shyam.

1293
01:35:40,921 --> 01:35:42,163
Understand?

1294
01:35:42,244 --> 01:35:43,808
No, I don't understand! Why?

1295
01:35:43,888 --> 01:35:45,733
What do you mean 'why'?
Your marriage has been fixed.

1296
01:35:45,813 --> 01:35:48,138
What? My marriage?

1297
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:50,706
I won't get married!
- Then go and tell everyone.

1298
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:52,068
Yes, I'll tell everyone!

1299
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:53,714
Tell everyone that you
won't marry anyone..

1300
01:35:53,794 --> 01:35:56,039
..not even Shyam.
- What?

1301
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:13,966
"I am the same, even
the mirror is the same."

1302
01:36:14,126 --> 01:36:16,893
"I am the same, even
the mirror is the same."

1303
01:36:16,973 --> 01:36:19,740
"But what has happened?"

1304
01:36:19,901 --> 01:36:23,029
"Everything appears new to me."

1305
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:26,357
"Everything appears new to me."

1306
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,729
"I am the same, even
the mirror is the same."

1307
01:36:50,459 --> 01:36:56,314
"I've started singing 
and humming."

1308
01:36:57,317 --> 01:37:03,813
"I've started singing 
and humming."

1309
01:37:04,134 --> 01:37:08,585
"What direction am I going in?"

1310
01:37:11,313 --> 01:37:14,361
"My heart and 
body are the same."

1311
01:37:14,641 --> 01:37:17,609
"My heart and 
body are the same."

1312
01:37:17,689 --> 01:37:20,336
"But what has happened?"

1313
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:23,584
"Everything appears new to me."

1314
01:37:23,664 --> 01:37:27,113
"Everything appears new to me."

1315
01:37:28,036 --> 01:37:31,605
"I am the same, even
the mirror is the same."

1316
01:37:44,478 --> 01:37:50,253
"The sparrow calls
out to its beloved."

1317
01:37:51,135 --> 01:37:57,550
"The sparrow calls
out to its beloved."

1318
01:37:57,952 --> 01:38:02,564
"I too feel like
flying to my beloved."

1319
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:07,697
"My heart is the same, even
my heartbeats are the same."

1320
01:38:07,778 --> 01:38:11,267
"My heart is the same, even
my heartbeats are the same."

1321
01:38:11,347 --> 01:38:13,934
"But what has happened?"

1322
01:38:13,953 --> 01:38:17,122
"Everything appears new to me."

1323
01:38:17,202 --> 01:38:20,169
"Everything appears new to me."

1324
01:38:21,493 --> 01:38:24,501
"I am the same, even
the mirror is the same."

1325
01:38:24,781 --> 01:38:27,629
"I am the same, even
the mirror is the same."

1326
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:30,275
"But what has happened?"

1327
01:38:30,356 --> 01:38:33,483
"Everything appears new to me."

1328
01:38:33,564 --> 01:38:36,652
"Everything appears new to me."

1329
01:38:36,732 --> 01:38:39,780
"Everything appears new to me."

1330
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,204
Radha?
- Where were you lost?

1331
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:33,494
What are you looking at?

1332
01:39:35,297 --> 01:39:38,943
The trees swaying in the wind.

1333
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:41,506
The flowing waves.

1334
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:44,471
Those flying birds.

1335
01:39:45,554 --> 01:39:47,798
All of them are 
going somewhere.

1336
01:39:48,919 --> 01:39:52,365
Seems like they're
all calling out to me.

1337
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:53,888
'Shyam..

1338
01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:56,533
'..why are you 
sitting silently?'

1339
01:39:56,933 --> 01:39:59,297
'Come with us.'

1340
01:39:59,578 --> 01:40:01,461
But where?

1341
01:40:03,264 --> 01:40:04,947
What do you mean by 'where'?

1342
01:40:06,189 --> 01:40:09,956
We just have to keep on treading
on known and unknown paths.

1343
01:40:10,957 --> 01:40:13,561
If we know where we'll
start and where we'll go..

1344
01:40:14,643 --> 01:40:16,446
..what fun will be left then?

1345
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:22,015
We just have to keep on going..

1346
01:40:23,258 --> 01:40:25,661
..sometimes in the day
and sometimes at night.

1347
01:40:26,222 --> 01:40:32,193
And, in the night, many companions
look at me from the stars above.

1348
01:40:32,217 --> 01:40:38,017
Different people,
villages, fields, mountains..

1349
01:40:39,164 --> 01:40:43,650
I'll go, Radha.
- No, you won't go anywhere now.

1350
01:40:44,373 --> 01:40:48,058
Mom has tied you in a bond of
love with so much difficulty.

1351
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:50,422
Bond?
- Yes.

1352
01:40:50,646 --> 01:40:53,746
Aren't you happy in our house?

1353
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:57,996
I am.
- Are you angry with me?

1354
01:40:58,316 --> 01:40:59,959
Angry? Why?

1355
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,248
I used to trouble you a lot.
But I don't do it anymore.

1356
01:41:16,306 --> 01:41:17,869
What are you looking at?

1357
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:20,113
Radha..

1358
01:41:20,673 --> 01:41:24,039
..you seem to have
changed nowadays.

1359
01:41:24,721 --> 01:41:25,923
And you?

1360
01:41:26,002 --> 01:41:28,246
Me? I don't know.

1361
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:31,570
Okay, close your eyes. - Why?

1362
01:41:31,594 --> 01:41:33,594
Just do it.

1363
01:41:45,154 --> 01:41:46,476
A new flute?

1364
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,084
Hold it to your lips and play.

1365
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:53,968
Play it.

1366
01:42:26,864 --> 01:42:28,227
What?

1367
01:42:34,517 --> 01:42:37,441
What happened?
- You won't understand.

1368
01:42:37,722 --> 01:42:39,526
Why?
- Because you are..

1369
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:48,779
What happened?

1370
01:42:50,785 --> 01:42:52,788
I too am stupid!

1371
01:43:15,585 --> 01:43:19,432
'But my heart says that you'll surely
get the husband of your choice.'

1372
01:43:19,713 --> 01:43:20,874
'Really?'

1373
01:43:21,074 --> 01:43:22,758
'Bless you!'

1374
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:00,981
Radha?

1375
01:44:15,305 --> 01:44:16,905
What happened?

1376
01:44:17,929 --> 01:44:23,329
All the land till, that hill 
belongs to us.

1377
01:44:23,339 --> 01:44:25,262
That mango and guava garden..

1378
01:44:26,184 --> 01:44:28,828
..and that vegetable field too.

1379
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:31,833
You'll have to 
manage all of them.

1380
01:44:33,596 --> 01:44:35,560
Me?
- Yes, you.

1381
01:44:37,362 --> 01:44:39,606
You're studying a lot now.

1382
01:44:40,127 --> 01:44:43,212
Accounts, writing and
comprehension.

1383
01:44:43,973 --> 01:44:46,177
The accountant will
explain everything to you.

1384
01:44:48,942 --> 01:44:50,865
Come, let's go.

1385
01:45:01,283 --> 01:45:02,805
Come.

1386
01:45:03,607 --> 01:45:05,129
Come, sir. Please, be seated.

1387
01:45:06,451 --> 01:45:08,294
'Sir'?
- Yes.

1388
01:45:08,374 --> 01:45:11,499
Stop all this frolicking
around now.

1389
01:45:11,523 --> 01:45:17,723
Why? - Because you're about to
become this family's son-in-law.

1390
01:45:18,351 --> 01:45:19,673
What?
- Yes.

1391
01:45:19,753 --> 01:45:23,279
You'll be getting 
married to Radha.

1392
01:45:23,303 --> 01:45:26,403
Getting married to Radha? 
- Yes.

1393
01:45:31,213 --> 01:45:35,099
But nobody told me anything.
Not even madam.

1394
01:45:35,339 --> 01:45:39,827
If someone considers one his own,
he enjoys a right on him..

1395
01:45:39,907 --> 01:45:42,310
..and feels no need to
explain anything to him.

1396
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:48,962
You can say that now
you're tied in this bond now.

1397
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:54,101
Bond?

1398
01:45:54,692 --> 01:45:58,177
You're now caught and
surrounded on all sides!

1399
01:45:58,378 --> 01:46:00,942
Try and get out of
this confinement now!

1400
01:46:02,264 --> 01:46:04,428
Come on, parrot, 
say 'Radhe Shyam'.

1401
01:46:04,452 --> 01:46:07,752
Will he learn everything in one day?
First give him something to eat.

1402
01:46:08,235 --> 01:46:12,522
Here, have this green
chilli guava and flour.

1403
01:46:12,602 --> 01:46:15,486
Then say 'Radhe Shyam'.

1404
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:20,495
Jai Ram, during our
pilgrimage last year..

1405
01:46:20,815 --> 01:46:25,103
..we had mixed so many red
chilies in Shyam's lentil and..

1406
01:46:30,111 --> 01:46:33,037
Come, sir.

1407
01:46:33,116 --> 01:46:36,440
Jai Ram, where did
you catch this parrot?

1408
01:46:37,323 --> 01:46:39,246
Free it.
- No, sir.

1409
01:46:39,327 --> 01:46:43,013
Why not? A bird flies in
the air and lives on trees.

1410
01:46:43,373 --> 01:46:45,416
Why did you catch it? Free it.

1411
01:46:45,496 --> 01:46:48,462
How can I? I bought it
from a gypsy for one rupee.

1412
01:46:48,542 --> 01:46:51,948
The cage costs 5 rupees.
- So you bought it to imprison it?

1413
01:46:52,468 --> 01:46:54,632
Won't it be distressed?
- Why will it be distressed?

1414
01:46:54,656 --> 01:46:57,256
It'll eat as much as it
wants and live in comfort.

1415
01:46:57,317 --> 01:47:00,362
After a long time, Radha
has found a parrot like this.

1416
01:47:00,442 --> 01:47:02,485
She likes it a lot.

1417
01:47:02,565 --> 01:47:06,812
Here, have chili and
say 'Radhe Shyam'.

1418
01:47:06,892 --> 01:47:10,017
'Say Radhe Shyam.'

1419
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:27,407
'You can say that now
you're tied in this bond now.'

1420
01:47:27,487 --> 01:47:29,170
'Tied in this bond!'

1421
01:47:30,051 --> 01:47:32,055
'Tied in this bond!'

1422
01:47:32,375 --> 01:47:35,461
'Tied in this bond!'

1423
01:47:35,620 --> 01:47:39,467
'I bought it from a gypsy for one
rupee. The cage costs 5 rupees.'

1424
01:47:39,547 --> 01:47:42,592
'A cage!'

1425
01:47:42,672 --> 01:47:44,716
"From where have you come?"

1426
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:46,639
'Why will it be distressed?'

1427
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,202
'It'll eat to its fill
and live in comfort.'

1428
01:47:48,282 --> 01:47:51,928
'Live in comfort?'

1429
01:47:52,209 --> 01:47:56,135
"Where am I going?"

1430
01:48:00,262 --> 01:48:10,800
"One who doesn't know
that is the happiest."

1431
01:48:15,046 --> 01:48:21,097
"These moving winds
are making a sound."

1432
01:48:21,417 --> 01:48:27,026
"And these flying birds are living
their lives to the fullest."

1433
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:31,754
"O birds.."

1434
01:48:37,163 --> 01:48:42,954
"..take wings like a
bird and fly away."

1435
01:48:43,053 --> 01:48:48,583
"Keep on singing and humming,
my friend."

1436
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:03,303
What did you say? He's
nowhere to be found?

1437
01:49:03,383 --> 01:49:05,910
Yes, sir. We
inquired at every house..

1438
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:09,678
..and searched the fields, gardens,
lakes, rivers and everywhere else.

1439
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,046
But we didn't find him anywhere.

1440
01:49:15,214 --> 01:49:18,342
But where did he go
without telling us and why?

1441
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:20,948
We were about to
give you everything.

1442
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:23,034
Shyam..

1443
01:49:23,715 --> 01:49:25,079
..If that was your intention..

1444
01:49:25,303 --> 01:49:28,103
..why didn't you leave
at the carnival itself?

1445
01:49:28,688 --> 01:49:31,616
Why did you ruin 
my Radha's life?

1446
01:49:32,739 --> 01:49:34,704
Radha!
- My child!

1447
01:49:34,784 --> 01:49:36,990
What's happened to my daughter?

1448
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:38,834
Call the doctor!

1449
01:49:38,955 --> 01:49:41,521
Don't worry,
everything will be fine.

1450
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:47,938
Why are you two 
sitting quietly?

1451
01:49:48,018 --> 01:49:50,504
Play your chess now!

1452
01:49:50,625 --> 01:49:53,592
Brother, we didn't
force him to do anything.

1453
01:49:53,793 --> 01:49:57,402
You said that Radha and
Shyam love each other.

1454
01:49:58,044 --> 01:50:00,289
Then why did he 
go away furtively?

1455
01:50:01,412 --> 01:50:03,498
It's I who's unlucky!

1456
01:50:04,179 --> 01:50:06,585
But what's Radha's
fault in all this..

1457
01:50:07,067 --> 01:50:09,894
..that she's
having to pay so dearly?

1458
01:50:09,954 --> 01:50:13,563
Colonel, I beg you.

1459
01:50:13,644 --> 01:50:15,609
Think and do something.

1460
01:50:15,833 --> 01:50:22,733
She hasn't had any food or
drink since the past four days.

1461
01:50:22,787 --> 01:50:25,354
I can't bear to see
Radha like this, brother!

1462
01:50:37,866 --> 01:50:41,676
Dear, I can understand
your sorrow very well.

1463
01:50:42,558 --> 01:50:46,207
This world is like that.
Everyone in it has some sorrow.

1464
01:50:46,929 --> 01:50:50,298
But a true human being is
one who controls his sorrow..

1465
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:52,985
..and tries to 
keep others happy.

1466
01:50:54,067 --> 01:50:55,412
My child.

1467
01:50:55,431 --> 01:50:59,722
I had taken the
responsibility for your marriage.

1468
01:51:00,243 --> 01:51:04,053
So, besides you, he
has wronged me too.

1469
01:51:04,855 --> 01:51:06,660
He has betrayed me too.

1470
01:51:07,061 --> 01:51:08,545
I promise you..

1471
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:12,915
..that I'll find him
and bring him back.

1472
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:18,249
Don't you trust your
colonel uncle? I promise you.

1473
01:51:19,212 --> 01:51:20,856
Yes, I promise you.

1474
01:51:21,137 --> 01:51:23,342
that The one who has left you..

1475
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:28,796
..will come back one
day and marry you.

1476
01:51:33,529 --> 01:51:34,852
That's enough.

1477
01:51:35,093 --> 01:51:37,298
Have courage.

1478
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:52,057
"Keep singing and humming,
my friend."

1479
01:51:52,096 --> 01:51:57,871
"Keep singing and humming,
my friend."

1480
01:51:58,914 --> 01:52:00,196
Shyam?

1481
01:52:00,438 --> 01:52:02,363
Stop the cart!

1482
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:06,654
Shyam!

1483
01:52:09,742 --> 01:52:11,024
Sister?

1484
01:52:12,428 --> 01:52:13,613
Sister?

1485
01:52:13,672 --> 01:52:16,679
Naughty boy, where did
you go away quietly?

1486
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,326
Sister, I.. - I'll teach
you a lesson right now..

1487
01:52:19,406 --> 01:52:21,652
..and knock some sense in you!

1488
01:52:22,093 --> 01:52:25,221
Say, 'Hail Saraswati,
the Goddess of the arts..'

1489
01:52:25,301 --> 01:52:28,670
'..and Lakshmi, the
Goddess of wealth'.

1490
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,924
Come on, start.

1491
01:52:34,004 --> 01:52:36,731
Boss, shall I climb the tree?
- You?

1492
01:52:36,811 --> 01:52:40,080
Yes, I always climb the tree.
- But it's been decided that..

1493
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:43,428
Okay, let's see what you do.
- I'll show you right now.

1494
01:52:48,401 --> 01:52:49,604
Banke.
- Yes?

1495
01:52:49,764 --> 01:52:52,913
Be careful.
- Don't worry.

1496
01:52:52,972 --> 01:52:55,820
Just watch.

1497
01:52:56,782 --> 01:52:58,145
Watch your foot. - Just watch..

1498
01:53:02,357 --> 01:53:06,607
So all the girls are
pleading in front of lord Krishna.

1499
01:53:07,009 --> 01:53:11,139
'You are very
mischievous and shameless.'

1500
01:53:11,861 --> 01:53:15,972
You are very
mischievous and shameless.

1501
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:19,962
You always do whatever you want.
You always use your strength.

1502
01:53:20,082 --> 01:53:24,092
And today, 
you stole our clothes.

1503
01:53:24,293 --> 01:53:26,097
'Return our clothes!'
- Return our clothes!

1504
01:53:26,178 --> 01:53:28,302
I won't.
- Return our clothes!

1505
01:53:28,544 --> 01:53:30,589
You're such a bother!

1506
01:53:30,669 --> 01:53:35,642
You're so mischievous and shameful!
- Wow, Champa!

1507
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:40,035
You said it as nicely
as I wrote it!

1508
01:53:40,053 --> 01:53:41,577
Come on, say it.

1509
01:53:42,299 --> 01:53:45,547
'I've got this chance
today with such difficulty..'

1510
01:53:45,708 --> 01:53:48,234
'..and brought you
to such a condition.'

1511
01:53:48,515 --> 01:53:51,282
'How will you come out of the
water without your clothes?'

1512
01:53:51,362 --> 01:53:52,868
'Shall I tell you how?'

1513
01:53:52,926 --> 01:53:55,172
What are you waiting for?

1514
01:53:55,252 --> 01:53:57,177
Who'll play Kishen, you or I?
Why don't you say it?

1515
01:53:57,257 --> 01:54:00,545
Boss, you're saying it, so
how can I interrupt? - Quiet!

1516
01:54:00,569 --> 01:54:02,470
Okay, I'm quiet!

1517
01:54:02,471 --> 01:54:03,634
Champa, say..

1518
01:54:04,195 --> 01:54:07,163
'Shyam, return my clothes.'
- Shyam, return my clothes.

1519
01:54:07,243 --> 01:54:10,171
I will, but I have a
few conditions.

1520
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:11,975
I agree to all your conditions.
Tell me.

1521
01:54:12,055 --> 01:54:14,702
You'll never hide my
flute again. Agreed?

1522
01:54:14,823 --> 01:54:17,469
Agreed. - You'll come 
whenever I call you.

1523
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,236
Agreed?
- Agreed.

1524
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,947
'Whenever I will ask you
something you'll answer me.'

1525
01:54:23,966 --> 01:54:26,853
'You won't remain silent and
show your temper. Agreed?'

1526
01:54:27,057 --> 01:54:30,357
'Agreed. - You won't sit
alone to study with teacher..'

1527
01:54:30,382 --> 01:54:31,866
'..but will let me sit too.'

1528
01:54:50,808 --> 01:54:56,582
"Where did Kanha go
after promising to meet me?"

1529
01:54:56,606 --> 01:55:02,406
"Radha is standing on the
banks of Yamuna since so long."

1530
01:55:02,475 --> 01:55:07,490
"But our night of union
has still not arrived."

1531
01:55:07,571 --> 01:55:14,067
"But our night of union
has still not arrived."

1532
01:55:37,928 --> 01:55:43,663
"My beloved has gone
to a far off land"

1533
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:49,587
"And I cry every day."

1534
01:55:49,598 --> 01:55:55,133
"And I cry everyday."

1535
01:55:58,381 --> 01:56:04,196
"My beloved has gone
to a far off land"

1536
01:56:04,276 --> 01:56:09,848
"And I cry everyday."

1537
01:56:09,872 --> 01:56:14,772
"The rains haven't come yet"

1538
01:56:14,863 --> 01:56:21,400
"But our night of union
has still not arrived."

1539
01:56:47,788 --> 01:56:53,603
"Shyam, please 
forgive my mistakes."

1540
01:56:53,683 --> 01:56:58,335
"Come back and punish me
in any way you please."

1541
01:56:59,297 --> 01:57:04,750
"Come back and punish me
in any way you please."

1542
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:13,774
"Shyam, please 
forgive my mistakes."

1543
01:57:13,855 --> 01:57:18,507
"Come back and punish me
in any way you please."

1544
01:57:18,587 --> 01:57:24,402
"I won't trouble you anymore."

1545
01:57:24,482 --> 01:57:30,697
"Our night of union
has still not arrived."

1546
01:57:31,179 --> 01:57:36,713
"Where did Kanha go
after promising to meet me?"

1547
01:57:36,954 --> 01:57:41,566
"Radha is standing on
the banks of Yamuna."

1548
01:57:41,646 --> 01:57:47,381
"Our night of union
has still not arrived."

1549
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:53,676
"Our night of union
has still not arrived."

1550
01:58:32,941 --> 01:58:35,727
Meera? What are you doing here?

1551
01:58:35,826 --> 01:58:37,469
This is my in-laws' place.
- I see.

1552
01:58:37,549 --> 01:58:38,871
But what are you doing here?

1553
01:58:38,952 --> 01:58:41,758
I travel around with the drama
people and have come here today.

1554
01:58:42,038 --> 01:58:44,363
And see what a coincidence,
I've met you!

1555
01:58:44,443 --> 01:58:45,845
How are you?
- I'm fine.

1556
01:58:45,926 --> 01:58:47,609
Everything fine in the house?
- Yes.

1557
01:58:47,689 --> 01:58:49,773
Today is our first show.

1558
01:58:49,854 --> 01:58:51,617
You come too, 
you'll be very happy.

1559
01:58:51,897 --> 01:58:54,703
I won't be able to come.

1560
01:58:55,464 --> 01:58:58,550
But I'm glad we met. I got a
chance to ask you something.

1561
01:58:58,871 --> 01:59:00,755
May I ask?
- Yes.

1562
01:59:01,717 --> 01:59:03,920
I saw all the props for
the wedding being put up..

1563
01:59:04,722 --> 01:59:06,646
..and then taken down again.

1564
01:59:07,448 --> 01:59:10,614
If you didn't want to marry,
why didn't you say so before?

1565
01:59:10,894 --> 01:59:15,263
Just because your name is Shyam
is it your duty to hurt Radha?

1566
01:59:15,287 --> 01:59:18,787
Meera! - You're so 
coldhearted, Shyam!

1567
01:59:31,775 --> 01:59:34,300
That's enough, madam.
- 'Madam'?

1568
01:59:34,982 --> 01:59:36,505
Go and bring green chilies.

1569
01:59:38,709 --> 01:59:40,753
Why are you sitting so quietly?

1570
01:59:40,793 --> 01:59:43,276
Why aren't you eating? Why
don't you have some rice?

1571
01:59:43,919 --> 01:59:49,209
Eat double. In this show,
you're playing a lover.

1572
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:53,177
If you eat this rice, the public
will go mad about your performance.

1573
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:09,849
'Play it for her!'

1574
02:00:14,378 --> 02:00:15,741
Shyam..

1575
02:00:17,424 --> 02:00:19,147
..why did you leave your food?

1576
02:00:20,189 --> 02:00:21,272
I ate enough.

1577
02:00:22,795 --> 02:00:24,438
Who's this 'madam'?

1578
02:00:26,642 --> 02:00:27,885
Radha's mother.

1579
02:00:28,846 --> 02:00:30,850
And Radha?
- Radha?

1580
02:00:34,418 --> 02:00:35,900
Madam and sir's daughter.

1581
02:00:36,101 --> 02:00:38,184
Who are 'madam' and 'sir'?

1582
02:00:38,425 --> 02:00:40,188
What relation do 
you have with them?

1583
02:00:42,072 --> 02:00:43,435
What are you hiding?

1584
02:00:43,836 --> 02:00:46,801
Why don't you tell me clearly
what you're hiding from me?

1585
02:00:52,733 --> 02:00:55,097
I can't hide
anything from you, sister.

1586
02:00:59,185 --> 02:01:00,467
Remember..

1587
02:01:01,831 --> 02:01:07,842
..the last time I left you without
telling you? - Don't go, Shyam!

1588
02:01:08,364 --> 02:01:11,009
Wait, Shyam!

1589
02:01:11,089 --> 02:01:14,415
Don't go!

1590
02:01:14,856 --> 02:01:16,500
Wait!

1591
02:01:17,662 --> 02:01:19,945
Shyam!

1592
02:01:24,715 --> 02:01:31,008
You got so much love,
adoration and respect.

1593
02:01:31,889 --> 02:01:35,295
But you left everything and
came here without telling anyone!

1594
02:01:36,217 --> 02:01:37,981
How cruel!

1595
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:42,389
It's not that, sister.
- Then what is it?

1596
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:45,075
They gave you
everything and so much love.

1597
02:01:45,476 --> 02:01:48,161
Yet, you hurt 
them so terribly!

1598
02:01:48,402 --> 02:01:49,965
I don't know all that, sister.

1599
02:01:51,006 --> 02:01:52,730
I only know..

1600
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:57,019
..that I can't
endure living in a bond.

1601
02:01:57,058 --> 02:02:01,346
You fool, do you 
call this a bond?

1602
02:02:02,228 --> 02:02:07,358
Even God likes being tied in a
bond of love, adoration and..

1603
02:02:07,382 --> 02:02:09,382
..affection, not to 
speak of us humans.

1604
02:02:11,526 --> 02:02:13,450
And, with this bond..

1605
02:02:13,811 --> 02:02:17,858
..between them husband and wife erect
their own small and beautiful world..

1606
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:21,105
..through which
this whole world runs.

1607
02:02:22,067 --> 02:02:23,228
Shyam..

1608
02:02:23,911 --> 02:02:26,676
Have you ever
thought about that girl?

1609
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:30,322
What would she 
be going through?

1610
02:02:30,644 --> 02:02:33,650
What did you punish her for?

1611
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:45,512
Radha.

1612
02:02:52,045 --> 02:02:53,208
Radha.

1613
02:02:54,332 --> 02:02:59,832
Only God knows how all
this happened and why.

1614
02:03:01,543 --> 02:03:04,589
But we should forget
whatever happened.

1615
02:03:06,674 --> 02:03:11,162
Your father has selected
a very nice boy for you..

1616
02:03:11,483 --> 02:03:13,888
..from a nice house 
and family. - Mom!

1617
02:03:14,328 --> 02:03:15,571
Radha!

1618
02:03:17,534 --> 02:03:21,061
Yes, mom. Don't you know
that I'm already married?

1619
02:03:22,685 --> 02:03:25,185
So what if I didn't 
complete the rituals?

1620
02:03:26,738 --> 02:03:28,738
I've already accepted
someone as my husband.

1621
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:35,690
So he's my husband now
whether he comes or not.

1622
02:03:37,213 --> 02:03:39,618
I'll wait for him not
only in this birth..

1623
02:03:40,299 --> 02:03:42,824
..but also in my 
next seven births.

1624
02:03:50,198 --> 02:03:52,602
May God fulfill your wish!

1625
02:03:55,288 --> 02:03:56,972
I'm blessed..

1626
02:03:59,136 --> 02:04:00,618
..that you're my daughter.

1627
02:04:30,756 --> 02:04:34,566
"Arrogant Shyam."

1628
02:04:39,187 --> 02:04:42,877
"You became the 
king of Mathura."

1629
02:04:42,901 --> 02:04:47,101
"But Radha kept crying."

1630
02:04:47,125 --> 02:04:51,225
"Crazy girl!

1631
02:05:02,407 --> 02:05:10,267
"Shyam, why did you
leave Gokul village?"

1632
02:05:10,347 --> 02:05:14,197
"Why did you leave 
Gokul village?"

1633
02:05:14,277 --> 02:05:18,127
"Everyone was mad 
about your flute."

1634
02:05:18,207 --> 02:05:22,218
"But everyone's
heart is broken now."

1635
02:05:22,298 --> 02:05:26,388
"But everyone's
heart is broken now."

1636
02:05:26,749 --> 02:05:30,760
"You're a friend 
of the destitute."

1637
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:34,850
"But don't know the
pain of a woman's heart."

1638
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:39,100
"Arrogant Shyam."

1639
02:05:39,181 --> 02:05:43,432
"Crazy girl!"

1640
02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:02,481
"All the melodies in my flute"

1641
02:06:02,561 --> 02:06:06,531
"Are only for Radha."

1642
02:06:06,612 --> 02:06:10,542
"Are only for Radha."

1643
02:06:10,622 --> 02:06:14,512
"How can anyone part
Radha from Shyam?"

1644
02:06:14,592 --> 02:06:18,562
"She's a part of me."

1645
02:06:18,642 --> 02:06:22,933
"She's a part of me."

1646
02:06:23,134 --> 02:06:27,104
"Just like the moon and moonlight.
Just like a pearl and its shell."

1647
02:06:27,128 --> 02:06:30,928
"And just like a 
river and its water."

1648
02:06:31,152 --> 02:06:35,152
"Arrogant Shyam."

1649
02:06:56,400 --> 02:07:00,330
"Shyam, stop making excuses."

1650
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:04,421
"Just mend the broken hearts."

1651
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:08,150
"Just mend the broken hearts."

1652
02:07:08,391 --> 02:07:16,491
"We were compelled to
part from each other."

1653
02:07:16,572 --> 02:07:20,582
"Radha, we were 
compelled to part."

1654
02:07:20,823 --> 02:07:24,793
"One who realizes and
rectifies his mistake"

1655
02:07:24,873 --> 02:07:28,763
"is hailed as an
intelligent person."

1656
02:07:28,843 --> 02:07:32,814
"Arrogant Shyam!"

1657
02:07:32,894 --> 02:07:36,744
"Arrogant Shyam!"

1658
02:07:40,193 --> 02:07:42,638
"My Radha!"

1659
02:07:47,652 --> 02:07:50,459
"My Kanha!"

1660
02:07:51,582 --> 02:07:55,071
"My Kanha!"

1661
02:07:55,351 --> 02:07:58,839
"My Radha!"

1662
02:08:00,886 --> 02:08:02,811
"My Radha!
- My Kanha!"

1663
02:08:02,971 --> 02:08:06,460
"My Radha!"

1664
02:08:06,489 --> 02:08:07,933
Where are you going, Shyam?

1665
02:08:08,213 --> 02:08:10,539
Let him go, boss.

1666
02:08:16,274 --> 02:08:18,560
Let him go.
- What are you saying, Champa?

1667
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:19,923
People are making a lot of noise.

1668
02:08:20,004 --> 02:08:23,172
The arrogant Shyam will have
to perform again. - Not anymore.

1669
02:08:24,134 --> 02:08:28,304
Radha's love has
drowned Shyam's arrogance.

1670
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:34,721
That was the play's 
grand finale.

1671
02:08:35,764 --> 02:08:39,814
But real life has
started now. Remember that.

1672
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:55,655
Go, Shyam.

1673
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:57,679
Be happy.

1674
02:08:59,224 --> 02:09:00,307
Go.

1675
02:09:38,846 --> 02:09:40,931
Radha!

1676
02:09:42,576 --> 02:09:43,739
Who?

1677
02:09:49,433 --> 02:09:52,200
Radha!

1678
02:09:53,203 --> 02:09:55,810
Shyam!
- Radha!

1679
02:09:55,890 --> 02:09:57,654
Shyam!

1680
02:09:58,617 --> 02:10:00,121
Shyam!

1681
02:10:00,141 --> 02:10:01,785
Radha!

1682
02:10:02,828 --> 02:10:04,552
Shyam!

1683
02:10:08,362 --> 02:10:09,604
Shyam!

1684
02:10:10,046 --> 02:10:14,698
Shyam!
- Radha, please forgive me!

1685
02:10:15,059 --> 02:10:18,989
I'll never leave you again!

1686
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:21,395
You'll never go again!
