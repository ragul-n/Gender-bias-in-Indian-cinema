00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,900
I'm the influencer with
sharp eyes and magic filled.

3
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,860
Streaks in my hands are
that of an ungovernable.

4
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,900
I'm the influencer with
sharp eyes and magic filled.

5
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,820
Streaks in my hands are
that of an ungovernable.

6
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,200
I am...

7
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,150
...the influencer.

8
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,320
Hey, what is it?

9
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Do not mess early morning.

10
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,990
What is this?

11
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,280
Does your father own the street?

12
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:19,110
Your sharp eyes.

13
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,950
I ran to my fullest.

14
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,070
Instead of investing my
time in thrashing you...

15
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,200
...I must invest it
in bird watching.

16
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,780
Ram Singh, it was our fault.
Kindly, apologise.

17
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,110
And hurry up.
We have to go and pick up dad.

18
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,240
I am the traveler...

19
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,990
...of my convenience.

20
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:00,950
Will drown and go across.

21
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,700
Cheenu it is.

22
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,650
Purvi.

23
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,200
Here you are after
great bird watching.

24
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,530
The girl in the car was
really pretty, wasn't she?

25
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,030
How do you know?

26
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,610
I had gone to buy some milk.

27
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,990
I thought to buy some snacks
from uncle Cheenu's shop.

28
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,900
And what do I get to see!
- What?

29
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,990
I saw someone bird watching.

30
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,360
I like it.

31
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,530
But I didn't do anything yet.

32
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,990
I don't even know who she is.

33
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,360
But I do know.
- Really?

34
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,530
Then do the honors. Please.

35
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,450
No.
- You won't tell me! Wait.

36
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,950
Wow! Splendid!

37
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,990
After so many days,
climbing so many stairs...

38
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,740
...Saheb has come upstairs.

39
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,200
Uncle, how are you? Fine?
- Yes.

40
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,860
Tell me.

41
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,030
Tell me all her details.

42
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,530
Only on one condition.

43
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,860
I accept it. Tell me now.

44
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,990
Look, if I pass out
MBBS examination...

45
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,650
...then you owe me
a wrist watch gift.

46
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,700
Wrist watch? Done. Go on now.

47
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,110
She's the daughter
of the registrar.

48
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,030
Mahek.

49
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,570
Mahek! Mahek!

50
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,610
Mahek (fragrance)
spread all over me.

51
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,900
What?

52
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,110
Her name has actually
made the ambiance...

53
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,780
...redolent, right?

54
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,030
Don't began flying.

55
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,360
Don't underestimate her.
She's enough for many.

56
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,530
Oh!

57
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,320
But both of you will
make a good pair.

58
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,990
Because she is just like you.
Vagabondage!

59
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,530
Amazing! Vagabondage!

60
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,530
In which college does
Ms.Vagabondage study?

61
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,110
She got expelled from the college.

62
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,820
Then now?

63
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,070
Do not worry.

64
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,610
Her father will get her enrolled
in your college. -Really?

65
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,490
I have won the lottery.
I can't stay here now.

66
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Hey! Don't forget,
you owe me a wrist watch.

67
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,740
Only if you pass out.

68
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,280
Your milk is ready. Have it.

69
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,860
Okay.

70
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,990
Hey! Stop reading the
feminists columns.

71
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,030
At least invest time in cooking.

72
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,240
Hey! You think this
is feminists column!

73
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,240
Home Minister Mr.Dalsukh
is expected for the...

74
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,070
...inauguration in our
neighboring school.

75
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,610
Feminist columns!

76
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,070
Ask your CM...

77
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,860
...that the temple
is shut since years.

78
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,240
Ask him to grace
and inaugurate it.

79
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,570
CM doesn't entertain
people like us.

80
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,320
Leave and let me
do my arrangements.

81
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,070
Arrangements!

82
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,150
You'll build the alter.

83
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,030
And arrange the chairs.

84
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,530
And then?
- Then what?

85
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,490
All of them will be on stage
and you'll be the audience.

86
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
You are right. Dalsukh and I...

87
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,990
...joined the party together.

88
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,530
He has become the Home Minister
and I am still a welfare worker.

89
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,900
No one entertains us on stage.
- Me.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,360
Leave.

91
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,360
There are many seniors
out there who deserve it.

92
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,280
You old generation!

93
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,820
You can't think smartly.

94
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,570
Do you want to be
seated next to the CM?

95
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,530
Leave now.
- Don't challenge me.

96
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,740
Don't challenge me.

97
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,490
I can make this
happen and in return...

98
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,030
...you'll buy me a bike. Done?

99
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,110
What?

100
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,900
If I make you sit next
to the Home Minister...

101
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,240
...and if it gets published
in the newspaper...

102
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,070
...in return,
you'll buy me a bike. Done?

103
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,860
Think about it. Don't laugh.

104
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,110
I was anyway going
to buy you a bike.

105
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,610
But challenge will be a fun now.

106
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,240
Mr.Registrar,
you do not worry at all.

107
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,990
Your daughter is
like my own daughter.

108
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,030
But be sure about the fees.

109
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,990
You anyway charge millions.

110
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,990
But to be honest.

111
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,320
A child pass out graduate in
our university in just Rs.12000.

112
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,990
Sir, I can't hide it from you.

113
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,780
We do own it all.

114
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,860
It reaches the higher authorities.

115
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,740
Right. I will do it.

116
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,150
Anyway, education and
politics go hand in hand.

117
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,450
Call the student.
Where is your daughter?

118
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,280
She is sitting outside.

119
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,110
She is sitting outside.
Send her in, - Nice.

120
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,030
She seems to be
simple and generous.

121
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,740
Absolutely.

122
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,780
Pardon me but...

123
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,200
...such a girl in our college!

124
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,490
She might be misfit.

125
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,780
We have modern students here.

126
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,320
So such a girl will
not set here...

127
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,780
She can.

128
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,650
Can this girl set?

129
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,150
Yes.

130
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,030
Dad.

131
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,070
I have got the admission.
Can I leave?

132
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,320
Yes. Go.
- Thank you.

133
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,570
Hurry up. I am thirsty.

134
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,070
Hurry up. You are here since long.

135
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,280
Hey! Help yourself from the
canteen if you're in a hurry.

136
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,530
It costs only Rs.20.

137
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,530
You are fond of having
from a bottle. Not me.

138
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,990
What did you say?

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,530
Whom did you abuse? Fool!

140
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,490
Hey!

141
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,860
Hey! What are you doing?
Come on fast.

142
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Hey! Why did you let him go?

143
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,740
Malhar, he was one with attitude.

144
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,820
You should have trashed him.

145
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,200
Malhar!

146
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,740
Malhar!

147
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,990
Yes.
- Why did you get trashed?

148
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,280
The one to get
trashed, gets the girl.

149
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,530
Do not worry.

150
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,490
And if you spare him...

151
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,650
...then you don't deserve
your name. - Okay.

152
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,610
Do not spare him.
- Okay.

153
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,860
Goddess will punish him.

154
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,820
May she face the wrath.

155
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,400
Malhar!
Malhar, where are you heading?

156
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Did you reach?

157
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,950
Yes. Reaching. Hurry up.

158
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,820
Come on.

159
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,570
Oh! Jayanti, you!
- Yes.

160
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,780
After years!

161
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,320
I still remember the tea you make.
- Thank you.

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,700
How is it going?
- By your grace. Welcome.

163
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,900
Stay blessed.
- Are everyone positioned well?

164
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,990
Where are you?

165
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,070
Home Minister has arrived.

166
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,400
Everything is set. Wait.

167
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,780
Is everything set?

168
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,610
Done.
- Yes.

169
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,860
Tell me, how many of
them are yet to arrive?

170
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,490
Two corporators.

171
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,400
Okay. You just occupy
one of the two chairs...

172
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,860
...as soon as I tell you.

173
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,400
Malhar, corporators are here.

174
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,200
Get ready. One.

175
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,490
Two, three.

176
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,200
Come on.
- Hey!

177
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,320
Hang on. Don't you know driving?

178
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
As if you know.
- Wait.

179
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,570
I will show you, get down.
- Come here.

180
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,780
Come here.
- What is it?

181
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,240
What is it?
- Look here.

182
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,700
Do not mess with me.
- I'll trash you.

183
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,320
I will trash you.

184
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,650
Hey!
- Sir.

185
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,860
I am getting late. Hurry up.

186
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,780
Hey!

187
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,860
Just go and sit on the chair.

188
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,610
That will help the students...

189
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,820
...of the school.

190
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,070
Thank you.

191
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,240
Move aside.
- You keep quiet.

192
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Come on.
- We are getting late.

193
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,030
Sir, grace my shelter.

194
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,610
It's really nice. Just as earlier.
- It's CM calling.

195
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,150
Coming, sir.

196
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,570
I had to go. CM is calling.

197
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,240
Just a photo please.

198
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,490
So go on. One, two, three.

199
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,820
Forceful companionship
is possible but...

200
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,490
...not forceful happiness.

201
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,280
We've to pen down a tribute.
Go on.

202
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,700
As you have left...

203
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,150
...party has incurred
an unforgettable loss.

204
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,400
Your sudden death...

205
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,820
...has traumatized me severely.

206
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,320
May Lord...

207
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,860
...grant strength
to face the grief.

208
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,820
Oh! Mr.Mansukh.

209
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,360
Live long, Mr.Mansukh.

210
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,030
Yes. Hey!

211
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Do not worry.

212
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,490
Government is responsible
for your safety.

213
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,200
My dear.

214
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,150
You won't get a scratch. Okay.

215
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,610
Bye.

216
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,780
Write it.

217
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,200
Mr.Mansukh.

218
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,740
Sorry. Late Mr.Mansukh.

219
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,950
I will miss you a lot.

220
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,780
My sweet Lord!

221
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,610
And yes, remember.

222
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,490
Send this cover post
5 pm over-morrow.

223
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,990
A tribute is meant to be
given after the demise.

224
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,030
What made you remind of me?

225
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,900
I am lucky to have not
faced such days yet.

226
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,070
Politics is a really awful.

227
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,780
We need to opt for
all wrongdoings.

228
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,240
Is everything set for Mr.Mansukh?

229
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,700
Yes, sir.
- Good.

230
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,740
Where has the party
fund raising reached?

231
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,150
The industrial fund...

232
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,650
...is not enough.

233
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,110
But if you don't mind...

234
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,240
...then we can manage
with the liquor.

235
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,610
I guarantee you the returns.

236
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,070
No. With this step,
the opposition will get a chance.

237
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,490
Instead, do one thing.

238
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,110
Grant permission to all
the self-financed colleges.

239
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,240
Right.

240
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,490
To ask for money from
the old colleges.

241
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,200
They are earning good.
- Sure, sir.

242
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,360
And corporation by-election
is round the corner.

243
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,860
I am sure,
you haven't thought of it.

244
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,200
We must win that seat.

245
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,110
Sir, I have just
inaugurated a school today.

246
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,450
Good.
- Consider, we have won the seat.

247
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,490
Then do add the
youth in the rally.

248
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,240
Sure, sir.
I'll order all the workers today.

249
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,610
And inform them.

250
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,780
I am off.

251
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,570
One has to die to
witness the heaven.

252
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,490
Salvation leads one to the heaven.

253
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,820
Oh no!

254
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,320
Oh!

255
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,780
You hit me once and I hit you
five times. It is settled.

256
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,450
You should have trashed
him in the college.

257
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,700
Why did you put in
so many efforts?

258
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,780
My dear!

259
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,240
His girlfriend was with him.

260
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
If I had trashed him
in her presence...

261
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,740
...he's be my enemy forever.

262
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,610
Now, he is friends with us.

263
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,110
Amazing!

264
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,610
Actually, we both trashed
each other. End of the story.

265
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,610
Actually, we both trashed...

266
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,610
...each other. End of the story.

267
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,490
Right.
- Right.

268
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,320
Here, darling.
- Thank you. Hey.

269
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,400
Where are you going?
- I have brought water for Malhar.

270
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,110
He's my friend.
- Water for him!

271
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,240
Girls are really magicians, right?

272
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,530
She can make enemies friends.

273
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,400
And vice versa.

274
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,700
He got trashed yesterday
and is serving me today.

275
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,490
Water for you.

276
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,700
Yesterday...
- Let it be.

277
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,950
Oh!
- Chilled water for you.

278
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,530
Chilled water.
- Yes.

279
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,490
Get lost now.

280
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,530
Malhar, here she is. Come on.

281
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,530
Hariya.
- Yes.

282
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,740
Mr.Hari.
- Yes.

283
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,900
Come running.

284
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,780
Coming. Tell me.

285
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,280
Transfer this water
to another table.

286
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,150
Here.

287
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,070
Hariya.
- Yes.

288
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,530
Tell him,
he must have the courage to...

289
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,820
...feed the same.

290
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,740
I had gone to the river
bank to fetch water.

291
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,240
I have quenched my thirst...

292
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,150
...by your presence.

293
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,780
The glass is half filled.

294
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,820
Fill it half with some love.

295
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,200
A boy...

296
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,650
...is no more in control.

297
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,990
The bud has bloomed.

298
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,110
Is no more in control.

299
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,150
A girl...

300
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,900
...is really splendidly smart.

301
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,360
Cuts and scales me.

302
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,240
And yet gathers me every time.

303
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,950
Here you are.

304
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,650
Don't flirt. I am engaged a lot.

305
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,400
There's no one here.

306
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,780
If you concentrate
on your career...

307
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,360
...this photo could
replace by yours.

308
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,400
My photo will be everywhere.

309
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,650
But I won't have
time to flirt then.

310
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,360
I feel your presence
everywhere in your absence.

311
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,740
You play like music
of love everywhere.

312
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,900
I feel your presence
everywhere in your absence.

313
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,360
You play like music
of love everywhere.

314
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,610
You entice and placate me.

315
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,240
And make me laugh.

316
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,240
And get me trapped in sweet havoc.

317
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,610
Different attraction
and different drill.

318
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,400
Something happens in
the corner of heart.

319
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,360
Different attraction
and different drill.

320
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,110
Something happens in
the corner of heart.

321
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,900
A girl...

322
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,240
...is really splendidly smart.

323
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,400
Cuts and scales me.

324
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,360
Yet gathers me every time.

325
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,900
Different attraction.

326
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,110
Different drill.

327
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,400
Something happens in
the corner of heart.

328
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:16,400
Something happens in
the corner of heart.

329
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,280
Didn't I tell you.
- What?

330
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,110
That I am engaged.
- I know.

331
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,320
I am a volunteer.
- Fool.

332
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Even I am a volunteer now.

333
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,780
What?

334
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,740
Oh! Smart.

335
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,490
I know...

336
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,610
...what made you a volunteer.
Come on.

337
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,990
Both of us will close our eyes.
- What?

338
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,990
Do not miss the target.

339
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,490
On the count of three.

340
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,700
One.

341
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,450
Two and three.

342
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,450
Hey.

343
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,700
Do not interfere.

344
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,610
Will you interfere as you've got
a package worth Rs.15,00,000?

345
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,490
I'll see you later.

346
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,490
Chandni!

347
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,610
Good morning, sir. How can
I help you? - Good morning.

348
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,700
Be a good host.

349
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,280
He intends to buy a mobile.
- Bring it.

350
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,700
Sir, of how many sim cards?

351
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,860
His intellects are too
low to understand this.

352
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,990
How many sim cards?

353
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,900
Fool!
- Dual sim.

354
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,860
Come on. It'll be fun.
- Come on.

355
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,530
This mobile is in demand.

356
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,900
Okay. - And this is
also the latest piece.

357
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,280
You buy yourself a phone.
I'll be there.

358
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,610
Order 30 pieces of this model
and tomorrow... -Excuse me.

359
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,570
I have seen you somewhere.

360
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,490
This is meant to be
said to the girls.

361
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,900
It doesn't suit us.

362
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,950
Hello.

363
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,900
I can't be wrong.

364
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,650
I am sure, I have seen you.

365
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,900
Do you click photographs
fro identity proofs?

366
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,610
Then you might have seen me.

367
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,950
Bring the stock.
- Sir, we have 10.

368
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,490
This is the new stock.
- Perfect.

369
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,070
Hurry up.
- Hang on.

370
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,990
You are the one related
to Rs.15,00,000 package.

371
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,200
Rs.15,00,000.
- Boss, MT college.

372
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,860
Rs.15,00,000 package.

373
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,990
Your poster was there and you
study in the same college.

374
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,950
What are you looking at?
Count the stock. - Rs.15,00,000?

375
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,530
There's so much to work.

376
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,990
Check the I Phone consignment.
- Okay, sir.

377
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,110
Chintu, you be there. I'll be
back. - Where are you heading?

378
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,950
Hey! Malhar.
- He fooled me.

379
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,360
How are you?
- Fine.

380
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
What is wrong with you?
Why are you following me?

381
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,150
I am the same guy.

382
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,360
But do not share this with anyone.

383
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,700
But you had got
Rs.15,00,000 package.

384
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,200
Nonsense.

385
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,700
I didn't get Rs.15,000.

386
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,700
They committed a fraud
in the name of placement.

387
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,360
What? -The company hired
me on a contract basis.

388
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,030
They got me work like a
donkey for six months...

389
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,530
...on probation period.

390
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,780
And later fired me with the
pretext of bad performance.

391
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,320
Fired you!

392
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,400
But that's how
corporate world works.

393
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
I am not the only one fired.

394
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,820
Since last four years...

395
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,780
...all those who got hired
through campus placement...

396
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,070
...almost everyone got
fired from the company.

397
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,030
I will...

398
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,320
...show you the Whatsapp
group of those fired ones.

399
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,700
Look at this.

400
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,450
Fired.

401
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,240
They asked me to resign
after six months.

402
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,610
They didn't pay me for last month.

403
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,400
You should have
protested the company.

404
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,030
It didn't click out of job need.

405
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,740
We did sign the contract.

406
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,240
But it stated...

407
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,990
...they can terminate
without reason.

408
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,070
Thank you.

409
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,610
We'll have to stop
placement for this year.

410
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,990
Is it fine?

411
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,860
Change the contract.
- Sure.

412
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,610
Car,
a foreign trip and a lot more.

413
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,700
Wow, my contract!

414
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,200
Are the changes fine?

415
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,650
I have made it as you asked for.
- Well done, guys.

416
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,110
Just watch now.

417
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,320
Now they have got trapped.

418
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,990
Malhar, show us your moves.

419
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,280
What is it? I am here.

420
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,780
Show me your moves.

421
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,110
Here. Leave now. Idiot.

422
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,030
Hello, sir.
- Hi.

423
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,030
Welcome, Mr.Malhar.
- Thank you.

424
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,280
What are your hobbies?
- To collect the information.

425
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,740
I am known as Google in the
college and Google has it all.

426
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,530
What can you do for our company?
- Everything.

427
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,780
I mean, everything right
from the peon till the CEO.

428
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,030
What will you do if a
tiger trespasses you?

429
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,650
I will sign a contract
with him and eat him later.

430
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,570
Good one.

431
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,320
Here are your contract papers.
Sign them.

432
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,450
You are hired.

433
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,490
Oh! Thank you.

434
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,150
Yes.

435
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,950
You not have just given me
this job, but a lot more.

436
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,030
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

437
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,400
Thank you.
- Excuse me.

438
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,990
It is my key.

439
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,780
So?
- So, he owns the car.

440
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,400
Right.
- But I own it now.

441
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,650
Didn't you read the contract?

442
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,900
Read it. It is stated there.

443
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,360
You will hand over car keys to me.

444
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,360
A film with my
girlfriend twice a week.

445
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,820
Two foreign trip twice a year.

446
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,320
And 30 percent partnership
in your company.

447
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,280
What do you mean?
- Is it a joke?

448
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,360
Who did that with you?

449
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,030
I don't deserve your company.

450
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
In fact,
no student from our college...

451
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,360
...is worth your company.
Thank you very much.

452
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,610
What nonsense.
What do you intend to say?

453
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,400
Your turn over is
about Rs.50,00,000.

454
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,990
You have 40 employees.

455
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,030
Sorry, you had them.

456
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,030
You fired 10 of them 15 days ago.

457
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,950
You didn't pay the
rest for months.

458
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,280
And terminated ex-students
of my company...

459
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,700
...without paying them, right?

460
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,950
Yes.
- How does he know this?

461
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,360
Google. I told you, I am Google.

462
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,070
What nonsense?
- Google.

463
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,200
Google.
- Are you mad?

464
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,650
We've hiring you and
you're being audacious.

465
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,110
We're not interested in your
fake jobs of your dummy company.

466
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,900
You intend to hire free
workers in the name of job.

467
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,280
Yes. -You are fooling all of us.

468
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,610
Yes.
- Yes.

469
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,530
You are paying Rs.10,000...

470
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,950
...instead of Rs.5,00,000 package.
- What bullshit?

471
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,400
Exactly.

472
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,200
Your company is a bullshit.

473
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,070
Good for nothing.

474
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,570
We don't want it. Out.

475
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,780
You are rusticated
from this college.

476
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,570
But ma'am, the company...
- Shut up.

477
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,200
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

478
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,950
Dad, what is it?

479
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,450
Don't be tensed unnecessarily.

480
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,650
Something will get managed.
- What?

481
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,450
Nonsense.
They have rusticated you.

482
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,280
I got you enrolled...

483
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,280
...in such a respected college
and paid a huge amount.

484
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,280
Not to do all this.

485
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,030
That's my point, dad.

486
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,240
There are no jobs despite
of paying a huge amount.

487
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,320
The trustees and the company
are fooling together.

488
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,530
They are all involved.

489
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Uncle.

490
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,240
Malhar is right with his actions.

491
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,860
At times, when unjust is being
practiced in your presence...

492
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,400
...instead of keeping
quiet, it's better to die.

493
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,070
What are you saying?

494
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,610
Hey! What are you saying?

495
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,450
Be positive.

496
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,820
And you! Instead of
encouraging him to study...

497
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,990
...you are favoring him.

498
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,820
And you!

499
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,280
You will apologise the
principal tomorrow.

500
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,450
I don't want to listen anything.
Here.

501
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,740
Why should you write
an apology letter?

502
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,860
Is there any other
option left for us?

503
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,780
Otherwise his year
will be in vain.

504
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,320
Including the fees
of whooping amount.

505
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,030
But they run the college.
We can't do anything.

506
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,900
You are right.

507
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,400
But you are running it.

508
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,610
Sorry, guys.

509
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,740
For interfering.

510
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,610
I am a reporter.

511
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,280
After years...

512
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,740
...I've come to cover as someone
for the first time has...

513
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,360
...protested
against the college.

514
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,860
Malhar, my pal.

515
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,070
It takes courage.

516
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,070
Do not write an apology.
- Right.

517
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,400
Because if Malhar
will apologise...

518
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,150
...then the matter
will get closed.

519
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,400
How will you seek the news?

520
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,240
The world has large
number of coward people.

521
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,650
And those people know
only one thing the best.

522
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,990
To stop the courageous ones...

523
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,570
...from opting for
the right things.

524
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,950
What is expected to be done?

525
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,400
Don't fear,
make the college fear instead.

526
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,610
Ask your fees back.

527
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,700
They will pay us back
but how will that help?

528
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,490
That's the problem.

529
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,740
Will you leave if they ask you so?

530
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,280
You all don't question.

531
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,780
Whereas you prepare a
questionnaire to buy...

532
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,990
...a phone worth Rs.5000.

533
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,570
Right?

534
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,400
Then after you paying a
whooping price of Rs.5,00,000...

535
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,110
...you don't question
the college...

536
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,200
...about after paying
such a huge amount...

537
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,400
...what will we gain?

538
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,650
Will we get the job or not?

539
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,990
If yes then how?

540
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,320
Your fees is your power.

541
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,530
The college might pay you back.

542
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,700
But what if all the other
students ask for it back?

543
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,320
Let's do it. Yes.

544
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,240
I have a great idea.
- Which is?

545
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,240
All of us will not
get the fees back.

546
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,320
But if we all...

547
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,400
...don't pay for
upcoming semesters...

548
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,700
...then something is possible.

549
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,200
Amazing!

550
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,240
Brilliant!
- College won't be able to...

551
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,450
...pay anyone if
we don't pay fees.

552
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,030
They will have to seal it.

553
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,570
And this college holds...

554
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,990
...a lot of importance
even politically.

555
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,280
Because Home Minister...

556
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,860
...has invested in this college.

557
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,400
And if this scandal
gets revealed...

558
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,530
...then it will be
no less than a havoc.

559
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,200
So we all will not pay the fees.

560
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,700
Right?
- Yes. We will not.

561
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,530
Students of MT college
are on strike...

562
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,900
...since five days in order...

563
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,700
...to cancel Malhar
Palladia's rustication.

564
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,200
The important thing
is, these students...

565
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,650
...denied to pay for the
upcoming semester fees.

566
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,200
The other self-financed
colleges are petrified...

567
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,320
...that their students should
not follow these steps.

568
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,530
Vinita ma'am, act wisely.

569
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,280
Sir, you do not worry at all.

570
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,990
I will settle everything.
Two days.

571
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,150
All the students will get
back to normal in two days.

572
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,700
And I have expelled...

573
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,570
...the root of the problem.

574
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,400
You didn't expelled the
problem, but invited instead.

575
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,110
Do one thing,
cancel his rustication.

576
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,030
But if we...
- Nothing will happen.

577
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,070
But if you don't, then it
will be get into a scandal.

578
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,490
Experience speaks.

579
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
The black history of politics...

580
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,740
...is granted by such
unsatisfied students.

581
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,110
Cancel his rustication
immediately.

582
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,740
Everything will be fine.

583
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,650
All the students
will pay the fees.

584
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,030
You know, elections are
round the corner next year.

585
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,700
Okay, sir. As you say.

586
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,860
Sir, did you watch
Aishwarya's new movie?

587
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,280
You know, I have never
watched movies alone.

588
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,490
So let's go.
- When is the next show?

589
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,150
We'll have to reach
within 30 minutes.

590
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,950
Did you hear it?

591
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,530
She has canceled
Malhar's rustication.

592
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,030
Malhar!

593
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,780
Malhar!

594
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,570
Malhar!

595
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,610
The triumph of victory played.

596
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:24,820
Warriors, wake up now.

597
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,570
A conch plays.

598
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,820
A wisdom has awakened.

599
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,700
Awakens the havoc within.

600
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,070
Reminds of the forgotten chapter.

601
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,240
Lights up.

602
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,740
Enlightens us.

603
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,280

A wisdom has awakened.

605
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,860
A conch plays.

606
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,450
A wisdom has awakened.

607
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,070
Awakens the havoc within.

608
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,530
Reminds of the forgotten chapter.

609
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,360
Lights up.

610
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,650
Enlightens us.

611
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,320
Resounds.

612
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,860
A war resounds.

613
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,860
It takes.

614
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,990
It takes color red.

615
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,070
Awakens the spirit of war.

616
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,650
Sparkles the blown fire.

617
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,650
Lights us.

618
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,740
Enlightens us.

619
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,700
A conch plays.

620
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,110
A wisdom has awakened.

621
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,360
A conch plays.

622
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,900
A wisdom has awakened.

623
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,530
Awakens the havoc within.

624
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,150
Reminds of the forgotten chapter.

625
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,990
Lights up.

626
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,110

627
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,610
It awakens.

628
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,400
It awakens.

629
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:59,490
Enlightens us.

630
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,860
Awakens...

631
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:09,320
...the havoc within.

632
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:17,320
Lights us.

633
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,650
'Malhar.'

634
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,400
'Forgive me.'

635
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,860
'I had pass out the examination.'

636
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,950
'But I got failed in
front of the system.'

637
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
'Sorry.'

638
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,780
'I couldn't fulfill dad's dream.'

639
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,950
'And I didn't had time...'

640
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,400
'...wear the watch
I asked you for.'

641
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
'If you could give
me something now...'

642
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,900
'...then grant my dad the
strength to face this grief.'

643
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,150
'I am off.'

644
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,990
'Purvi.'

645
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,360
You come to play...
- Malhar.

646
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,360
...in the corner of my heart.

647
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,320
You bring tears...

648
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:01,150
...to dry eyes.

649
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:08,030
You are the color...

650
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,950
...of Holi (festival
of colors) in my life.

651
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:20,400
You are in the memories.

652
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,200
You are the flying kite.

653
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,900
You are in the...

654
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:38,360
...prayer of...

655
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,780
...my heart.

656
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:52,450
You are in the...

657
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,200
...bounded compassion.

658
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,400
'At times, when unjust is being
practiced in your presence...'

659
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
'...instead of keeping
quiet, it's better to die.'

660
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,820
Kabira Mewada.

661
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,610
Malhar Palladia.

662
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,280
I don't want the degree.
- Malhar.

663
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,530
I don't want the degree
from the system...

664
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,860
...that led Purvi commit suicide.

665
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,030
Sir, education helps
lead people a good life.

666
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,740
But why are people
dying out of the system?

667
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,530
Sir, please.

668
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,360
I ask justice...

669
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,780
...for Purvi and other students...

670
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,900
...like her.

671
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,530
I don't want the degree...

672
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,860
...but justice.

673
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,070
Enlightens us.

674
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,530
No one will interfere.

675
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,820
Awakens...
Arrest him.

676
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,740
...the havoc within.

677
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,700
Malhar.

678
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,450
Come on.

679
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,530
Someone else reminds me.

680
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,070
Reminds me.

681
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,490
After I meet you, I wonder...

682
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,860
...you remind me of someone else.

683
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,860
Reminds me.

684
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,360
How did you come?

685
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,240
In police jeep.

686
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,320
I mean, what are you in for?

687
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,360
I scorched the degree in
CM's presence in the college.

688
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:38,700
Hey.

689
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,280
I appreciate your daring.

690
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,610
How did you come?
- In an auto-rickshaw.

691
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,070
See this.

692
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,450
He scorched the degree.

693
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,990
Informer.

694
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,740
Police informer.

695
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,360
You know what I mean.

696
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,610
I am Rehmat.

697
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,320
I have all the information...
- With me.

698
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,110
Come on, you are out on a bail.

699
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,860
Come on. Open the door.

700
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,360
Come on.
- Not you. The other guy.

701
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,400
Wow! You got behind the
bars in college age.

702
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,950
Now no one will mess
with you outside.

703
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,110
Sign here.

704
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,240
You have got out
on a bail for now.

705
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,030
But don't get into anything.

706
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,070
Otherwise you will lose your life.
- Oh!

707
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,490
You are threatening.

708
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,360
Warning.
You have messed with the CM.

709
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,490
Have you lost it?

710
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,490
Do not get influenced
by these reporters.

711
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,400
Otherwise you'll get destroyed.

712
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,820
If I wish, I can get you in again.

713
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,490
He is out on a bail right now.

714
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,820
If he doesn't get out,
you will get destroyed.

715
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,400
Let's go, Saheb.

716
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:21,820
Live long, Malhar!

717
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:30,200
Live long, Malhar!

718
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,820
This college student
is getting viral a lot.

719
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,530
We need to fix him before
he opts to become a threat.

720
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,280
Sir, you do not worry.

721
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,320
Let some days pass by.

722
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,860
We will fix him in such a way...

723
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,740
...that he will be quiet forever.

724
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,360
Mr.Dalsukh, speak softly.

725
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,360
Always be patient
when having alcohol...

726
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,650
...and using politics.

727
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,950
Sir, we can't help it.

728
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,860
You know...

729
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,990
...that it takes no time for
a spark to catch the fire.

730
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,900
Get some water sprinkled
in this sparkle.

731
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,030
Sir, I can call a tanker.

732
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,740
His father...

733
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,320
...is an old welfare worker.

734
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,450
Give him the seat of a corporator.

735
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,990
Wow!

736
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,070
Wow!

737
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,950
Wow!

738
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,070
By your grace!

739
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,240
Lower down the volume.

740
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,200
Son.

741
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,110
You scorched the degree but
your father has graduated.

742
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,950
What?
- I mean...

743
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,860
...party has given me
a ticked for next...

744
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,610
...corporation elections.
- Dad.

745
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,360
You know the fact...

746
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,740
...there are many seniors
who deserves this.

747
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,280
They all intend to
stop me with this move.

748
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
They are not obliged.
- But...

749
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,900
To douse the fire of my protest.

750
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,490
Dad, try to understand.
- You are right but...

751
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,570
Just recall Purvi once.

752
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,240
Malhar.

753
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,110
This is not the time
to get emotional.

754
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,860
You will not stand
for this election.

755
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,610
I am a sure shot winner.

756
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,820
So I will stand the election.

757
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,400
Then get ready to get defeated.

758
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,490
We will visit everyone and speak.

759
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,070
No family should be unvisited.

760
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:52,530
Transform the customs.

761
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,400
Say it loud to the societies.

762
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,360
They cannot take away...

763
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,990
...the voices now.

764
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,030
Transform the customs.

765
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,650
Say it loud to the societies.

766
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:24,650
They cannot take
away the voices now.

767
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,070
I swear...

768
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,110
...by the sun.

769
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,780
Will send back the night.

770
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:45,280
And let the sun rise.

771
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,860
I swear...

772
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:19,030
...by the sun.

773
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,610
Will send back the night.

774
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:26,150
And let the sun rise.

775
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,280
A big event has occurred
in the history of politics.

776
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,700
The corporator of
Sattadhari Lokmanas Party...

777
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,030
...Jayanti Palladia...

778
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,280
...lost the election from an
impartial candidate by 3000 votes

779
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,610
Malhar.
- Hariya, you're here.

780
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,450
Will you help me?

781
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,400
Yes. Tell me.
- My father headed to...

782
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,780
...clean the drainage
and died out of it.

783
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:52,110
Mr.Mansukh was about
speak about it.

784
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,110
But he too died
out of an accident.

785
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,490
Have you requested properly?
- Yes.

786
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,450
But I am still
awaiting the response.

787
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,200
Malhar,
the government might hear you.

788
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,610
I will do something.
You do not worry.

789
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,400
Something will happen.
Do not worry. - Okay.

790
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,490
A corporator might have won.

791
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,200
But a father of a daughter
is still defeated.

792
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,570
Nothing but if I just
become the voice...

793
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,900
...of those defeated
ones is enough.

794
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,400
Purvi.

795
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,150
Dear.

796
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,820
This is not our victory.

797
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,490
This is the beginning
of our war of justice.

798
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,900
So not the victory celebration.

799
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,990
But will held the candle march.

800
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,990
Candle march.

801
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:27,820
I swear...

802
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,400
...by the sun.

803
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,650
Will send back the night.

804
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,780
And let the sun rise.

805
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:49,240
Time is the most...

806
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,280
...powerful.

807
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,200
I swear by the sun.

808
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:05,200
Filled with the courage.

809
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:14,530
And fill the sky with our voices.

810
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,610
That is the victory...

811
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,780
...of mankind.

812
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,240
I read Purvi's letter everyday.

813
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,860
And I always think that
she didn't commit suicide.

814
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,400
But has got murdered.

815
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,780
The same way...

816
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,400
...as many students
dreams gets murdered.

817
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,610
You are right.

818
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,570
Your responsibilities
aren't fulfilled...

819
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,110
...just with the
tag of corporator.

820
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,610
Hang on.

821
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,240
Hello. Yes.

822
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,280
Are you serious?

823
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,610
Okay.

824
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,650
Thanks for the information. Bye.

825
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:23,030
I had given Purvi's phone
details to an expert.

826
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,070
And he has found that...

827
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,860
...since last three days
a college admin's...

828
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,820
...assistant used to call her.

829
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,110
Will you say the truth or...

830
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,280
...go behind the bars out
of Purvi's suicide case?

831
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,030
Tell me.
- Look.

832
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,360
I am just an ordinary clerk.
- Really?

833
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,110
I have no knowledge about it.
- Really?

834
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,610
Before Purvi
committed suicide...

835
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,240
...you were continuously
calling her.

836
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,150
Should I give details
to the police?

837
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,320
People whom you are
helping right now...

838
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,530
...will not come for your bail.
What will you do then?

839
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,740
Then go to the jail.

840
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,280
And your family will
become homeless.

841
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,950
Look...

842
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,450
...I should not get
dragged anywhere. -Okay.

843
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,150
In all the semesters...

844
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:08,650
...they fail students for mere
marks and ask a whooping amount.

845
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,360
I had called Purvi
to ask for money...

846
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,400
...and all the amount goes to...

847
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,360
...Tribhovan.

848
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,530
Saumitra.

849
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,530
Who is Tribhovan?
- I know that rascal.

850
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,400
He is the party worker.

851
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,320
He is fond of being with
prominent politicians.

852
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,900
Famously known as Tribhovan Batli.
- Tribhovan Batli!

853
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Look.

854
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,950
Let the bottle's bottom up.

855
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,030
But our brotherhood
should be unchanged.

856
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,400
I follow a rule.

857
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,240
I get ready...

858
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,490
...at 8 everyday.

859
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,990
Tribhovan.

860
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,950
You are a rich man now.

861
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,070
You play with prominent people.

862
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,530
People like me can't reach there.

863
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,490
No. Keep mum.

864
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,070
You are my brother.

865
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,860
I can take you wherever you want.
Tell me.

866
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,400
Hello. Yes, sir.

867
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,780
Yes, sir.

868
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,780
I will deliver two
treasures the following day.

869
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,200
Okay.

870
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,570
Look...

871
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,490
...while having this
foreign liquor...

872
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,570
...help my foreigner son.

873
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,360
Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

874
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
He is my NRI friend's son.

875
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,320
Oh!
- He intends to invest in India.

876
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,320
I have brought him to you...

877
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,150
...as you earn in billions now.

878
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,950
No. That's not the case.

879
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:53,650
He is an NRI.

880
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,990
My NRI pal.
- Oh, yeah.

881
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,240
Pass me the cheese cube.

882
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
Look.

883
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,530
My earnings are like
these cheese cubes.

884
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,700
A huge amount of my earnings...

885
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,570
...goes to higher authorities.

886
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,740
And all I get is this piece.

887
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:25,820
Can't you get it all for yourself?

888
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,070
Have you got 100 million?
- By check or in cash?

889
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,780
Open a self-financed college.

890
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,570
I'll get you all the permissions.
- Wow!

891
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,110
But I'll charge 10 percent
commission. - Sure.

892
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,070
There's nothing to earn from
a self-financed college.

893
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,110
The government relies on that.

894
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,360
Do you know,
who had called just now?

895
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,700
Education minister.

896
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,610
In every 15 days...

897
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,280
...a whooping amount goes to...

898
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,610
...education minister.

899
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,200
And...

900
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,950
...the transporter has become
rich now out of the same.

901
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,110
Are you serious?

902
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,280
Yes.

903
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,820
Thank you!

904
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,990
Education minister
seems dangerous.

905
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,950
How can we invade his farm house?

906
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,150
From the front gate.

907
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,820
Malhar.

908
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,700
There's tight security...

909
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,070
...where there's so much
money kept. - Yeah. I know.

910
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:54,360
No. How can we invade?

911
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,240
Do you know how to ride a tempo?

912
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,780
Do you know how to ride a tempo?

913
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,900
Tribhovan sir has send the locker.
Get it down.

914
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,280
But some other driver
comes every time.

915
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:16,900
He is sick.

916
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,700
That won't work. Get him online.

917
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,650
Then you speak with him.
- I will.

918
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,860
Waste of time.

919
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,280
Sir, someone has
brought the locker.

920
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,200
I have send it. It's mine.

921
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,400
One's your sir's and
another for Home Minister.

922
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,990
Okay. I will get it.
- Okay.

923
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,820
Come on.

924
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,780
I'm the influencer with
sharp eyes and magic filled.

925
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,490
Streaks in my hands are
that of an ungovernable.

926
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,780
I'm the influencer with
sharp eyes and magic filled.

927
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:50,740
Streaks in my hands are
that of an ungovernable.

928
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:57,150
I am the...

929
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:02,240
...influencer.

930
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:06,820
Sharp eyes.

931
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:11,650
And magic filled in eyes.

932
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,990
Why did you come back?

933
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,530
Sir, it got messed up.

934
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,200
What happened?
- They took the wrong locker.

935
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,530
This has to be kept, not that one.

936
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,950
Oh God! Come on.

937
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,820
Yes, sir.

938
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,320
What are you saying?

939
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,950
We won.

940
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,990
Captivate them.

941
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,400
Come on. Get down.

942
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,570
Leave me.
- Hold him.

943
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,360
Come on. Start the car.

944
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,320
Hey! Leave him.

945
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,240
Malhar!

946
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:56,570
The heart has...

947
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,400
...called a war with wisdom.

948
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:04,030
Can't find the solution.

949
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:09,110
Whom should I agree with.

950
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:14,950
But my heart says, this life...

951
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,570
...is about ups and downs.

952
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:25,780
Rann it is.

953
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,200
The prominent animal
found here is Ghudkhur.

954
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,200
If a human trespasses him...

955
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:36,820
...the other Ghudkhars...

956
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,950
...tears him into pieces.

957
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,570
Then those Ghudkhurs...

958
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,490
...dies.

959
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,820
Too bad.

960
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:48,780
Remember.

961
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,950
Not to trespass someone.

962
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,490
Come on.
- Ghudkhur has got Saurashtra.

963
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,450
Only donkeys are the problem.
- Sit.

964
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,950
Straight forward answers.

965
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:09,780
I like it.

966
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,900
I wish you had wisdom...

967
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,860
...as much as you have words.

968
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,610
You have 30 minutes.

969
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,860
Stop all your acts.

970
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,990
Otherwise I will bury
you in this Rann.

971
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,530
Or I will tie you on the camel...

972
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,990
...and send you across the border.

973
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,610
You won't even get...

974
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,400
...death if you ask for.

975
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,950
Nor could you survive.

976
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,900
You are giving me 30 minutes.

977
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,450
I give you 30 days.

978
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,490
Within 30 days...

979
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,900
...I will demolish...

980
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,570
...your government.

981
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,650
A wisdom has awakened.

982
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:29,950
A conch plays.

983
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,530
A wisdom has awakened.

984
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:36,780
A conch plays.

985
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,820
It awakens.

986
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:46,990
It awakens.

987
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,360
Oh, man.

988
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:59,470
You seem to have
watched South movies.

989
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,000
Delivering dialogues when
death is on your head.

990
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,870
I don't understand if you
are clever or stupid.

991
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:10,620
If I go alive from here...

992
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,760
...then I am clever.

993
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,400
And if something
happens to me...

994
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,160
...it's your stupidity.

995
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,460
Let me have some fun
for being stupid.

996
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:30,310
Pick him up.
- Hey, mister.

997
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,450
If I got damaged...

998
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,720
...then you'll incur
loss worth 20 billion.

999
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,290
If I don't reach my friends
within 30 minutes...

1000
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,420
...then the photos,
videos and locations...

1001
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,830
...worth 20 billions...

1002
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,770
...will all be right
in front of the media.

1003
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,100
That's a good try.

1004
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,980
Try again in your next life.

1005
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,260
2nd floor, Bungalow 24,
Harsukh Farm House...

1006
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,490
...20 billion in the
cupboard in bedroom.

1007
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:57,430
Till now, only I know.
Within 30 minutes...

1008
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,810
...whole world will know
Education Minister's address.

1009
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:02,180
Look at Tribhovan's video,
if you don't believe me.

1010
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:03,670
'Here is 100 million.'

1011
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,140
'Open a self-financed college.'

1012
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,680
'I take responsibility for
all the permissions.'

1013
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:14,280
'But I'll charge 10% commission.'

1014
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,820
Water.

1015
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:20,570
'Government depends on it.'

1016
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,540
Outweighed me.

1017
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,920
Outweighed me.

1018
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,300
The political profession
outweighed me.

1019
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,760
We're talking about 20 billion.

1020
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,420
But...

1021
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,360
...I will get...

1022
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,190
...another chance to kill you.

1023
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,860
Take him. And drop
him till home.

1024
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,780
Let the AC be high.

1025
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,360
Let him be cool.

1026
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,560
Okay? I'm going.

1027
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,580
You will go forever now.

1028
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,930
Remember.

1029
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:08,450
30 days.

1030
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:13,290
Heart has gone naughty...

1031
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,900
...being good.

1032
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,580
HM?

1033
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,150
Tribhovan Batlivala.

1034
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:26,360
He's killed, sir.
But that boy...

1035
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,850
How are you? Good?
- Yeah.

1036
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,710
30 days?

1037
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,520
Are you kidding?

1038
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,810
Who do you think you are?

1039
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,370
Whatever happens,
Government will go down.

1040
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,040
Who will do that?
- Me

1041
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:17,640
Malhar!

1042
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,340
See.

1043
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,430
Action has started.

1044
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:26,970
Hello. Greetings.

1045
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,810
Thank you. Thank you.

1046
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:31,150
Hi.
- Hi, thanks for coming. Hi.

1047
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,040
Our Honorable Chief Minister...

1048
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,680
...doesn't have time for
inauguration of this temple.

1049
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,030
Which is why it is
closed since six months.

1050
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,510
That's it.

1051
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,750
I just want to tell
Chief Minister...

1052
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,650
...that even God will
not wait for you.

1053
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,290
Brother is here.

1054
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,740
He is here.

1055
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:01,010
Brother is here.

1056
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,110
He is here.

1057
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,790
Brother is here.

1058
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,200
He is here.

1059
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,610
Saheb is here.

1060
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,500
He is here.

1061
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,280
Brother is here.

1062
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,680
He is here.

1063
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:19,990
Saheb is here.

1064
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,760
He is here.

1065
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,840
Brother is here.

1066
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,420
He is here.

1067
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,670
Saheb is here.

1068
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,040
He is here.

1069
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,760
Hail to Godless
Parvati's Husband.

1070
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:35,370
Hail to Lord Mahadev.

1071
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:42,710
Hail.

1072
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,040
Roll camera.

1073
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,940
For justice of Purvi...

1074
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,390
...and for the problem
of students...

1075
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,680
...I declare closure to all
the colleges in the state.

1076
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:59,260
And now, will organize
a student rally.

1077
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:01,060
Hail Mahadev!

1078
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,220
Why have you come?

1079
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,940
Saheb has declared closure
for colleges.

1080
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:07,440
At this age, in
native language...

1081
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,760
...Saheb is called a Nag.

1082
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:12,680
Whoa, sir. Sir. Sir.

1083
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,780
You are the only sir.

1084
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,370
I want to kick you hard.

1085
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,890
But I won't. Stand up.

1086
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,900
Make sure that not even a
single college gets closed.

1087
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:26,100
Sir, Guardian Board,
Student Board...

1088
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:28,050
...Board of Trustees
has been informed.

1089
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,660
And Police will be very strict.

1090
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,110
Good.

1091
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,240
Tell State IB...

1092
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,290
...to keep an eye on Malhar.

1093
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,600
Where he goes, whom he
meets, what he does.

1094
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:41,690
I want details of every minute.

1095
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,820
Malhar you called me?
- See.

1096
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:49,690
I am sending this map now.

1097
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,910
Our rally will go
from here first.

1098
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,650
Then on the main road.
- Okay.

1099
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,030
And then on this street. Okay?
- Okay.

1100
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,570
I'm forwarding this.
You pass on others.

1101
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,870
I'm going for
rally's permission.

1102
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,260
I'll send it to every student.
- Malhar!

1103
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,240
Very few colleges are closed.

1104
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:08,120
And the Government workers
are opening the closed ones.

1105
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:10,180
Government's applies
on their workers...

1106
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,340
...not on the students.

1107
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:13,700
Which is why I organized
students rally.

1108
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,910
Malhar?
- Yes?

1109
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,550
Aren't you hurrying?

1110
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:19,700
How will so many students
will come in your rally?

1111
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,690
They will. From everywhere.
Hostel...

1112
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,600
...library, colleges.

1113
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:27,150
And everyone is with me.
I will rock it.

1114
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,440
Not everyone, Malhar.

1115
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,630
Only youth is with you.

1116
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,300
There is difference between...

1117
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,490
...real followers and Instagram
and Facebook followers.

1118
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,960
There is no time for this.

1119
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:43,330
This time is for this action.

1120
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,720
Look, Malhar.

1121
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,480
Whatever you do next...

1122
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,220
...just think of it
a hundred times.

1123
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,400
Because all who are
with you today...

1124
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,280
...could be against
you tomorrow.

1125
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,180
Malhar.

1126
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,700
I'm going to Government
hospital since five months.

1127
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,900
No one is investigating
for my father.

1128
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,180
They are telling me to
bring the documents.

1129
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,570
Now, you do something.

1130
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,310
Look, I'm in a hurry.

1131
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,210
I will do your work for sure.

1132
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,010
100%. Start giving
your documents.

1133
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,350
But..

1134
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,730
Let her pass.

1135
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,720
Someone stop this girl.
We'll have fun.

1136
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,460
Leave it! Leave it!

1137
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:10,840
Run!

1138
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,060
Run! Get out from here.

1139
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:14,870
Get out of here!

1140
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:16,850
Run. Let's get out of here.

1141
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,880
Let's go. Let's get it.
- Go behind him. Catch him.

1142
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,380
Malhar and his supporters
answer less behaviour.

1143
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,020
This is Malhar's hooliganism.

1144
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:34,410
Will Malhar take
responsibility for this?

1145
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:37,110
People's anger on
Malhar is growing up.

1146
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,140
Saumitra!

1147
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,960
We have to go to
police station fast.

1148
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,990
Students who were supporting...

1149
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,660
...cops arrested them.
We have to bail them.

1150
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,550
Their parents are pressurizing me.

1151
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,500
They are arrested...

1152
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,070
...because they made a mistake.

1153
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,750
They were in rally
because of us.

1154
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,590
Us?

1155
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,430
Because of you.

1156
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,150
It's all similar.
- No.

1157
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,200
You don't want to fight.
You want to be a hero.

1158
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,400
From now on,
do not expect anything from me.

1159
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:18,090
Is there a problem if they
listen to me and agree with me.

1160
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,310
Or you don't like me being famous.
- No.

1161
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:25,970
I don't like it.

1162
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,840
Because people have
hopes from you.

1163
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,590
And you don't even know that.

1164
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,840
Do you intend to come with me
to the police station or no?

1165
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,560
Saumitra?

1166
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,420
After all these years?

1167
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:55,630
Now I understand from
where this boy...

1168
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,510
...got so much influenced air.

1169
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,620
Then let's finish the air pump.

1170
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:02,270
No.

1171
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,440
Kill this boy.

1172
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,660
Kill this boy mentally.

1173
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,300
Go on.

1174
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,200
Look, sir.

1175
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,800
They are students.

1176
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,690
Does it mean,
they can do anything?

1177
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,340
Sorry, sir. They made a mistake.

1178
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,500
Yes, they did.

1179
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,420
If someone like you
calls for a rally...

1180
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,210
...one should not go.

1181
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,060
They should know this.

1182
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:33,790
Sir, this will not happen again.

1183
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:35,310
That's why they are in there.

1184
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:41,520
You can't keep them
here like this.

1185
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:45,580
Keep them aside.

1186
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,960
First, you get out of here.
Out! Get out!

1187
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:50,800
Hey, go inside.

1188
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,460
My children are behind the bars!

1189
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:54,800
You know what you did?
Look at us.

1190
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,130
What did our kids do...

1191
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,120
...that they are
arrested because of you?

1192
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:00,650
You should be ashamed.

1193
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,310
What are you looking at me?

1194
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,980
Look at us.

1195
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,140
Brother is here.

1196
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,880
Saheb is here.

1197
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:19,800
Brother is here.

1198
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,910
Saheb is here.

1199
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:27,390
Brother is here.

1200
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:35,490
Saheb is here.

1201
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:52,720
Brother is here.

1202
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:56,630
Brother is here.

1203
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:00,140
Saheb is here.
Hey! Hey!

1204
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,100
Brother is here.

1205
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,070
Saheb is here.

1206
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,460
Brother is here.

1207
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,660
Saheb is here.

1208
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:16,680
Yes, mom. - Son?
Come home. Quick. Come home.

1209
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,320
In our home... - What?

1210
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:20,250
No, no. I'm coming right now.
I'll be there.

1211
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,760
What thugs? Did they hit you?

1212
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,950
They hit dad? Is he injured?

1213
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,010
Where are you?
- Don't worry. I'm coming, mom.

1214
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,270
Malhar is also with me. We are...
- Don't bring him with you.

1215
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:34,280
Yes.
Don't bring Malhar with you.

1216
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,290
And from now don't
even meet him.

1217
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:40,480
Listen. Thugs were in the house.

1218
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,970
They hit my parents
and messed the house.

1219
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:44,810
I have to go. Listen,
- Let's go. Let's go.

1220
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,300
Come here. Come here.

1221
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:48,210
Listen.

1222
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,760
Mom told me not to
take you there.

1223
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,920
She has also asked me
to stay away from you.

1224
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,170
Smile.

1225
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,120
You received a revenge...

1226
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,650
...for what you did.

1227
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,710
Amazing! Amazing!

1228
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,420
Amazing!

1229
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,710
The lips that can pray...

1230
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,990
...together they can...

1231
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:02,580
...also create eroticism.

1232
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,800
Amazing! Amazing!

1233
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,060
Hey.
- Yes, sir.

1234
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,160
Do something to
entertain people.

1235
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,680
Malhar?

1236
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,870
Sorry. This video...
- Where were you?

1237
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,240
I saw this video.
I don't know...

1238
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,700
I know. Not bad, huh?

1239
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,830
Malhar, I know. Why
are you worrying?

1240
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,530
And what's this? Where were you?

1241
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,700
Don't worry.

1242
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:56,000
How dare you come here? Get out.
- Daddy? Daddy!

1243
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,680
Shut up. Not a single word.

1244
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,030
Are you not satisfied
by disgracing us?

1245
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,980
I'll file a case against you.

1246
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:04,840
Ant trust me, you
will be in prison.

1247
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,130
Then I'll also go in the jail.

1248
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,690
Not only Malhar kissed me.
I kissed him too.

1249
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,360
And I will.
- Mahek?

1250
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,430
You are not getting it.

1251
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:20,150
But, dad...
- You should forget him.

1252
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,600
He'll do nothing in future.
Trust me.

1253
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:26,090
This stupid is
influenced by Saumitra.

1254
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,380
You don't know Saumitra.

1255
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,140
Saumitra is the one...

1256
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,800
...who killed his loved ones.

1257
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,730
He cheated on him.
And that Saumitra...

1258
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:37,950
...will kill him.
- One minute.

1259
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:40,580
What did Saumitra do?

1260
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,800
Why are you asking me? Ask him.

1261
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,650
You come with me.

1262
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,420
Understand what I say.
- Daddy. Daddy...

1263
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,890
Come with me.
- Daddy...

1264
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,770
Saumitra is treacherous.
- But, daddy...

1265
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,810
And I think, to kill him...

1266
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,090
...Saumitra viraled this video.

1267
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,820
Saumitra is treacherous.

1268
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,710
'Saumitra has viraled this video.'

1269
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,060
'Saumitra is treacherous.'

1270
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,910
'Saumitra has viraled this video.'

1271
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,510
'Saumitra is treacherous.'

1272
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,070
You'll be happy killing me?

1273
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:50,900
You go.

1274
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,580
Come back when you are calm.
- Why?

1275
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:59,750
Are you afraid to hear the truth?
- I'm afraid to say the truth.

1276
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:00,950
Then run away!

1277
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,270
Just like...

1278
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,320
...how years ago...

1279
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,420
...you ran after cheating
on your men. Just like that.

1280
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:55,730
What is this place?

1281
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,230
This is my office.

1282
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:02,990
Office?
- Where I too dreamt...

1283
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,820
...of changing something.

1284
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:11,700
And I am still having the
pain of not fulfilling it.

1285
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,170
'Is everything alright,
Mr.Diwakar?' - Me and Sachin.

1286
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:16,270
Who is CM now.

1287
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:19,570
We both were sincere
students of Mr.Diwakar.

1288
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,560
You and CM together?
- Yes.

1289
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:26,540
Sachin wanted to enter
the system very fast.

1290
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,730
And I wanted to
change the system.

1291
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:30,180
'Saumitra!'

1292
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,860
Sachin had the passion
to enter into politics.

1293
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,750
For that he could
go to any limits.

1294
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:38,190
'Yes, Sachin. Have a seat.'

1295
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:40,970
'Saumitra, look...'

1296
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:44,440
'Poor people,
farmers, students...'

1297
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:48,040
'...raised Rs.3,00,000
as a fund for our party.'

1298
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:51,060
'What?
- Yes. Take this.'

1299
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:54,440
'You keep this.
- Okay. As you say.'

1300
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,770
I didn't understand
Sachin's game.

1301
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:10,220
Have ever shouldered the
burden of a dead body?

1302
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:15,790
I did.

1303
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,230
'Mr.Diwakar?'

1304
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:25,770
'Mr.Diwakar!
- Move.'

1305
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,710
'Mr.Diwakar committed suicide
because of you.'

1306
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,670
'You got involved
with the government?'

1307
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,170
'He is a traitor.
- What are you saying, Sachin?'

1308
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:36,600
'What am I saying?'

1309
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:39,510
'See this. By taking money
from Government...'

1310
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,230
'...he dealt us.'

1311
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,190
'Mr.Diwakar was so upset
on you for this.'

1312
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:46,620
'You gave this money
to me, saying...'

1313
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:48,370
'...that our party
raised this fund.'

1314
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,200
'Okay. You got caught...'

1315
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:53,820
'...which is why you are blaming
on me. You are a traitor.'

1316
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:55,340
'He is a traitor.'

1317
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:57,550
'Saumitra, what you did,
is called cheating.'

1318
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,870
'Do not come here ever again.
Understand?'

1319
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:02,600
'You are out of here.
- Get out! Get out!'

1320
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,820
'He is a traitor.
- He is a traitor.'

1321
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:08,020
'Get him out of here.
- Come on, Get out!'

1322
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:10,730
'Get out of here.
- Get him out of here'

1323
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,840
'Get him out of here.
- Go away from here.'

1324
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,420
'Blacken his face.
Blacken his face.'

1325
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:03,490
Sachin sacrificed Mr.Diwakar
and became the CM.

1326
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,080
Saumitra...

1327
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:08,880
...I'm sorry.

1328
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:12,310
When I saw you for
the first time...

1329
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:17,800
...I thought you can
stand against CM.

1330
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,100
I am surrounded by many
questions right now.

1331
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:31,640
I feel like quitting
and escaping from here.

1332
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,870
Hello.

1333
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,790
Change...

1334
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,380
...the customs.

1335
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:14,070
Tell...

1336
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:16,220
...the societies.

1337
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:23,700
They cannot take
away the voices now.

1338
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:29,310
Change...

1339
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:31,930
...the customs

1340
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,500
Tell the societies...

1341
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:43,620
They cannot take
away the voices now.

1342
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:50,870
I swear...

1343
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:57,020
...by the sun.

1344
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,660
Will send back the night.

1345
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:04,730
And let the sun rise.

1346
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:18,820
Saumitra.

1347
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,510
Today I understood...

1348
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:25,530
...what is it to shoulder a
burden of a dead body.

1349
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,050
But, did you see?

1350
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:33,340
You are not alone in this fight.

1351
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,820
These laborers, farmers...

1352
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:39,480
...these women.

1353
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:43,900
They all are fighting against
Government's injustice.

1354
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,720
You take all of them with you.

1355
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:51,210
Government is afraid
of only one thing.

1356
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:54,110
And that is aware public.

1357
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,530
Dilip Desai.

1358
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,740
I'm from the opposition party.

1359
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,140
I'm with you in this fight.

1360
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:10,130
Fight for your war
in the Assembly.

1361
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:14,770
We'll fight our way.
No need of you.

1362
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:28,570
I swear by the sun.

1363
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,810
Will send back the night.

1364
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,850
And let the sun rise.

1365
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,650
This is Hari.

1366
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:47,930
What did he ask for?

1367
01:33:52,110 --> 01:33:54,310
Justice for his late father.

1368
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,230
He stood alone because
he had the courage.

1369
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,940
And did what he said.

1370
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:18,500
Hari, who had fire in him...

1371
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,810
...he is on fire today.

1372
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,650
Hari has turned black.

1373
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,540
He is not Hari.

1374
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,860
This is our State.

1375
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,560
Little bit black,
tired, half burned...

1376
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:00,930
...by the leader's
greed, betrayal, tricks.

1377
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,670
We may not have so much
courage compared to Hari.

1378
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,210
But from within, we are all
on fire. Just like Hari.

1379
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,710
We also have sparks inside us.

1380
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,110
If these sparks gathers...

1381
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:36,790
...then it won't take time
to take the Government down.

1382
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:46,130
Now fire of Hari's pyre...

1383
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,540
...will cool down, when
the Government goes down.

1384
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:56,230
I swear by the sun.

1385
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,980
Will send back the night.

1386
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,270
And let the sun rise.

1387
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:06,110
From today, no one will...

1388
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:08,950
...pick up garbage from
Government worker's houses.

1389
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:11,950
Put all your garbage in
front of their houses.

1390
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,390
They will understand when...

1391
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:16,170
...they will suffer
from all this.

1392
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,940
Then they will understand.

1393
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:20,750
Yes. Yes. It is Saheb on line.

1394
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,200
Yes, Saheb. Yes, yes.

1395
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:35,270
Yes? Okay, then.

1396
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,120
Why is this garbage here?

1397
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:39,970
Cleaners are on strike.

1398
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,220
Your houses will be cleaned...

1399
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:44,400
...when politics
will get cleaned.

1400
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,980
Clean the walls.

1401
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:49,290
The breath...

1402
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,660
The farmers are also
forced to come...

1403
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,670
...at the Assembly
for their demands.

1404
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:58,400
The voices against government is
witnessed everywhere in the state.

1405
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:01,340
Cleaners were also
on strike till now.

1406
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:05,130
And opposition corporator
stood trying for...

1407
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:07,220
...her daughter's justice.

1408
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:10,180
I swear by the sun.

1409
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:15,140
Will send back the night.

1410
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:19,080
And let the sun rise.

1411
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,840
We want justice.

1412
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,450
We want justice.

1413
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,990
Do you think, you'll get
justice for Purvi?

1414
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,370
Definitely.

1415
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,720
I definitely believe that...

1416
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,050
...Purvi will get justice.

1417
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,640
I saw your news.

1418
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:37,310
I appreciate your coverage.
- Thank you so much, sir.

1419
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,740
Shall I send my camera
team to have a byte?

1420
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,090
No, no. Look.

1421
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:44,670
People gain trust by votes.

1422
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,500
I do it by talks.

1423
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,520
Order, sir.
- Do one thing.

1424
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,320
Yes.
- Arrange a debate with Saheb.

1425
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,910
Okay, sir.
- People must learn...

1426
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,580
...that there is
no other branch...

1427
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:58,670
...of the original Saheb.

1428
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,140
Okay?
- Done, sir.

1429
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:15,890
Welcome, sir.
- You look pretty.

1430
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:18,890
Lord has created you nicely. Come.

1431
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,540
Sir,
Malhar Palladia will get late.

1432
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:26,910
Will you give an interview
to two reporters?

1433
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:28,770
Very smart.

1434
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:32,290
Just handle if those reporters...

1435
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:33,940
...ask controversial questions.

1436
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,150
Sir,
your gesture is enough for it.

1437
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,010
Welcome to your very own...

1438
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,680
...show True Facts.

1439
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,920
Today we have with
us, none other than...

1440
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,730
...honorable CM,
Mr.Sachin Majumdar.

1441
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,230
And our prominent...

1442
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:51,490
...reporters are present
here with their questions.

1443
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,850
And yes, the other special
guest for the day is...

1444
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:57,370
...Mr.Malhar Palladia.

1445
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,740
Saheb!

1446
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:04,390
Saheb!
- I can understand your eagerness.

1447
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:08,190
But Saheb will join
us in some time.

1448
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:11,020
So meanwhile let's
begin with the show.

1449
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:13,430
We heard that you're
quite flying in the air.

1450
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:17,020
I mean, you use government
helicopter for...

1451
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:18,500
...personal use.

1452
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:20,960
Is it true?
- Mr.Reporter.

1453
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,720
Where have you gone to
with your family yesterday?

1454
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:27,320
To Bhavnagar for
sister-in-law's marriage.

1455
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,090
With office vehicle.

1456
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,750
Pal, car and helicopters
are machines.

1457
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,250
We must keep using it
or it might get damaged.

1458
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,110
Sir, how about education
getting expensive?

1459
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,710
We heard that self-financed fees
goes to the government fund.

1460
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:48,210
And people are deprived of
clean water on the other side.

1461
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,430
See you after a short
commercial break.

1462
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:12,400
Sorry for being late.

1463
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:16,600
As the streets are too good.

1464
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,990
I couldn't ride more than 40.

1465
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,580
Sir, you accomplish many tasks.

1466
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,960
Then look after the streets too.

1467
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:30,490
You are heading on
the wrong street, pal.

1468
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,550
And also influencing the youth.

1469
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:36,350
I am warning the
subjects of the state.

1470
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:40,870
He is someone who is
against the state.

1471
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:43,670
Fool.

1472
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,590
Reasonable person

1473
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:47,970
You seem to have watched
South movies a lot.

1474
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:51,280
If I am a fool...

1475
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:53,810
...how can I be reasonable?
Do not confuse me.

1476
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:58,080
You are making fun of me.

1477
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,790
He is a shameless fellow.

1478
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:06,390
Friends, have you seen his clip?

1479
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,110
Clear obscenity.

1480
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:13,810
Show the clip to them all.

1481
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:17,040
Shameless fellow!
- Okay.

1482
01:41:23,850 --> 01:41:25,900
He made it a 24 seconds video!

1483
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:28,840
Thank you.

1484
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,990
Thank you for showing my clip.

1485
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:35,480
Now see this too.

1486
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,000
'In every 15 days...'

1487
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,750
'...a whooping amount goes to...'

1488
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:43,050
'...education
minister's farmhouse.'

1489
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:46,690
'The government relies on that.'

1490
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,060
Now you tell me.

1491
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:02,410
To love someone is shamelessness?

1492
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,590
Or to compel someone to commit
suicide is shamelessness?

1493
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,000
You tell me.

1494
01:42:10,970 --> 01:42:13,190
To kiss in public
is shamelessness?

1495
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,550
Or to get someone
killed is shamelessness?

1496
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,470
Mr.Harsukh, Mr.Mansukh.

1497
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,430
Hari, Tribhuvan, Purvi.

1498
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,630
Sir, the list is too long.

1499
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,060
You tell me.

1500
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,000
Who is shameless?

1501
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,840
And what is called shamelessness?

1502
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:41,690
Yes. This is called shamelessness.

1503
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:44,940
CM, down with!

1504
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,500
Justice for Hari.
- Justice for Hari.

1505
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,120
Justice for Purvi.
- Justice for Purvi.

1506
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:52,440
Investigate Mr.Mansukh's case.

1507
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,420
Yes, get it investigated.

1508
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:57,250
CM, down with!

1509
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:59,080
CM, down with!

1510
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,170
CM, down with!

1511
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,950
CM, down with!

1512
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:06,330
CM, down with!
- Calm down.

1513
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:09,650
CM, down with!
- Calm down.

1514
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,900
Pals.

1515
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:16,220
You have given me a
space in your heart.

1516
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:19,980
Let make some space
for my car to pass.

1517
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:23,500
He is really a shameless fellow!
- Yes.

1518
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,570
This is injustice.
- Come on.

1519
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:28,200
Where will you go?

1520
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:29,830
They are just students.

1521
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:32,210
Can't you handle them?

1522
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,500
This is CM's security! Nonsense.

1523
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,430
Break his car.

1524
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,960
Damage it.
- Damage it.

1525
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:43,910
Damage it.
- Damage it.

1526
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,970
Damage it.

1527
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:48,520
Damage it.
- Damage it.

1528
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,210
Damage it.
- Damage it.

1529
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,730
Damage it.
- Damage it.

1530
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:02,640
Hey!

1531
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:11,230
We are campaigners, not traitors.

1532
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:16,150
And this is our pride and
must not get stigmatized.

1533
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:20,840
CM, down with!

1534
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,510
Damage it now.

1535
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:29,530
Brother!

1536
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:36,320
Brother is here!

1537
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:40,040
He is here!

1538
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:46,550
He is here.

1539
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:50,660
My Saheb is here.

1540
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:57,170
Brother is here.

1541
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:58,840
He is here.

1542
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:59,930
Malhar.

1543
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:02,390
I am still telling you.

1544
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:06,010
We are ready to support you.

1545
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,300
Grace your campaign...

1546
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:12,210
...with our support.

1547
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:14,470
And get the government down.

1548
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,890
We are here.
- You just be there.

1549
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,670
Your time will soon come.

1550
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:23,670
I will tell you then.

1551
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,200
Do not step back then.

1552
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:38,630
Have you ever been
to Dang district?

1553
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:41,550
Yes, sir.

1554
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:43,560
By God's grace.

1555
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:47,160
I think,
you need you to visit once again.

1556
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,570
Residing in this city...

1557
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,190
...your energy has gone into vain.

1558
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:56,460
No, sir. This is not the case.

1559
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,930
So before the youth make me quit
politics and send to Dang...

1560
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:03,520
...I will get you
transferred to Dang.

1561
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:07,380
Then the nature
will entertain you.

1562
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:10,000
With the tribes.
- No, sir.

1563
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:12,210
Sir.

1564
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:13,580
Sir.

1565
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,090
Sir, don't get me transferred.

1566
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:17,920
Speak with him.
- Then fix this boy.

1567
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,770
Bury him, throw him in
to the well, drown him.

1568
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:22,740
Do whatever it takes.

1569
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,290
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

1570
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:25,920
Right, sir?
- Yes.

1571
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:27,240
And if you can't do it...

1572
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:30,370
...then Dang is for you. Enjoy.
- Go.

1573
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,550
Here he is. Stop him.

1574
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:38,170
Hey, stop.
- What is it?

1575
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,270
Get down.

1576
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,090
Let me speak.
- Why did you stop me?

1577
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,830
Hang on.
- Stay aside.

1578
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:47,350
Come on.

1579
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:48,910
Do not speak louder.

1580
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:50,060
Hey!

1581
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:56,220
Hey, why are you hitting him?

1582
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:59,090
Leave him.
- Come on.

1583
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:00,860
Leave him.
- Move.

1584
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,940
Leave him.
- Hey!

1585
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,880
Farmers movement has increased.

1586
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:13,610
They are protesting
in their talukas...

1587
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:15,890
...against the government offices.

1588
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,680
Government will go down.

1589
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:19,250
It is really painful.

1590
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,300
Come on.

1591
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,520
Yes.
- Yeah.

1592
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:26,560
It is really painful.

1593
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,460
At least you got some days
rest because of the cops.

1594
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:33,030
Because of whom?
- The cops.

1595
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,130
I will not spare the cops.

1596
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:40,370
Sir, did you get hurt?
- Come.

1597
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:42,990
Those were the cops.

1598
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,210
If I don't get you suspended...

1599
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,810
...then I don't deserve my name.

1600
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:51,750
Saumitra, calm down.

1601
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,170
I asked them to hit me.

1602
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:56,690
Vandalism.

1603
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:59,260
But why?

1604
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,750
Because CM has ordered the cops...

1605
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:03,330
...to kill Malhar.

1606
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:07,060
Be grateful to these honest
cops who informed me.

1607
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,880
If they hadn't hit me...

1608
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:11,040
...then my corpse would
have been buried somewhere.

1609
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,480
I am safe here because of them.

1610
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:16,190
Here.
- Hey.

1611
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:18,050
This was not needed.

1612
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,590
Keep it.
Accept it when cops give you.

1613
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,790
Malhar, we'll leave.

1614
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,380
Okay.
- Go.

1615
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:29,070
You have begun playing tricks
like political leaders.

1616
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:31,440
Hey!
- Sorry.

1617
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,580
You are clever now.
- Of course.

1618
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:37,500
Would you like some juice?

1619
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:43,780
Quiet.

1620
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:46,340
You are good for nothing.

1621
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:49,600
I had made all the arrangements
but he made a quick move.

1622
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:51,670
Sir, now...

1623
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:53,940
...it's risky to kill him.

1624
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:56,050
And you will get accused
if anything happens to him.

1625
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,080
And subjects are anyway agitated.

1626
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:03,310
Subjects are agitated?

1627
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:06,990
Subjects are agitated!

1628
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:14,590
Then agitate them more.

1629
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:17,500
Sir, they will not spare us.

1630
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:20,900
Not against us.

1631
01:49:21,670 --> 01:49:23,300
But against each other.

1632
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:26,650
Rehmat.
- Yes.

1633
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:28,220
Do me a favor.

1634
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,800
For Rs.2000. Be there at 11.

1635
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:33,110
Oh! But what do I have to do?
- Hey.

1636
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:35,430
Nothing.

1637
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,810
We have to create
some riots with them.

1638
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,560
And some petrol bombs.

1639
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:42,570
I've spoke with them too.

1640
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,510
They too will do the same with us.

1641
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:46,590
Create riots. It is all set.

1642
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:49,160
Be there at 11.

1643
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:50,710
Take a turn.

1644
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,970
Turn.
- Right.

1645
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:08,410
Yes, Rehmat.
- Malhar.

1646
01:50:08,990 --> 01:50:10,370
They have planned to...

1647
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:13,620
...agitate Hindu-Muslim riots
in name of your campaign.

1648
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:17,380
CM has bribed them...

1649
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,410
...and set people of
both the communities.

1650
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:23,100
You!

1651
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:26,120
Do you know their children?

1652
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:49,360
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan. -Go.

1653
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:54,670

01:50:54,700 --> 01:51:00,740

1655
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:05,990

1656
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:09,310
Ram and Seeta!

1657
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,660
Ram and Seeta!

1658
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:17,770
Man, worship Ram and Seeta.

1659
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:21,050
Ram and Seeta!

1660
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:23,070
Ram and Seeta!

1661
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:28,770
Man, worship Ram and Seeta.

1662
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:34,680
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan.

1663
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:40,030
Ram and Seeta uplift
the downtrodden.

1664
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:46,150
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan.

1665
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:51,600
Ram and Seeta uplift
the downtrodden.

1666
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,890
Take them to their mommies.

1667
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:07,730
They must waiting for them.

1668
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:11,950
I was of five...

1669
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:14,420
...and my mom had gone to buy
groceries and left me home.

1670
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:20,570
She didn't return
after the riots.

1671
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:29,360
No Hindu or Muslim
had killed my mom.

1672
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,230
These riots killed my mom.

1673
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:41,530
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan.

1674
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:46,920

1675
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:52,930

1677
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,560
Look.

1678
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,540
Right now,
government has 112 MLA's.

1679
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:10,250
If the government intends
to win by majority...

1680
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,020
...then he must have 94 MLA's.

1681
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:18,180
If he misses out even one MLA...

1682
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:21,280
...then the government
will go down.

1683
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:23,390
Okay.

1684
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:27,060
If 19 MLA's does not
support government...

1685
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:33,210
...then government will lose
it and goes down. - Correct.

1686
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:40,270
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan.

1687
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:45,970

1688
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:51,520
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan.

1689
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:56,770
Ram and Seeta uplift
the downtrodden.

1690
01:53:56,790 --> 01:54:01,750
Ishwar and Allah are both same.

1691
01:54:02,260 --> 01:54:04,840
Our government is
so good at work...

1692
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,790
...that the opposition
has nothing to do...

1693
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:10,660
...except reciting hymns.

1694
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:25,110
You have played the
Hindu-Muslim card.

1695
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,870
Lies.
- Lies.

1696
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:29,960
It is lies.

1697
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:31,860
Poor...

1698
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:35,970
...farmers, laborers,
students are all agitated on you.

1699
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:43,710
You have lost the moral
right to be in the politics.

1700
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:47,990
We will approach the governor...

1701
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:50,370
...and claim this government...

1702
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:52,540
...untrustworthy.

1703
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,290
Remember...

1704
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:59,280
...I will be the CM.

1705
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,680
King Rama,
descendant of Raghu clan.

1706
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:10,600
Ishwar and Allah are both same.

1707
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:15,480
Let God give good sense to all.
- Silence.

1708
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,930
As per the news...

1709
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:20,550
...that governor has
accepted the request...

1710
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:22,210
...of untrustworthy government.

1711
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:23,910
Calm down.

1712
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:27,310
So what if the opposition
party has done this?

1713
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:31,160
We have the majority of votes.

1714
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,520
But sir...

1715
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:35,880
...we all will get
destroyed before you.

1716
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:37,890
Yes, sir.
- Look.

1717
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:41,550
I know, how much the opposition
party intends to deduct...

1718
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,140
...MLA's of our party.

1719
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,020
But that will not happen.

1720
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:47,330
No one will get deducted.

1721
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,310
Sir, we're not petrified
by the opposition.

1722
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:51,700
But by the subjects.

1723
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:54,230
They exasperation has increased.

1724
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:56,650
People gets vexed looking...

1725
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:59,800
...at your visage. No big deal.

1726
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:04,730
HM, do one thing.

1727
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:07,730
Take them all to the resort.

1728
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:10,130
Sir, are you serious?

1729
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:12,010
Stay there for some days.
- Okay.

1730
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,900
And reach the Vidhan
Sabha directly...

1731
01:56:15,150 --> 01:56:16,770
...and vote for us.
- Okay.

1732
01:56:16,790 --> 01:56:18,500
That's a good idea.

1733
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:19,960
Anything else?

1734
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:22,780
No, sir.
- Thank you.

1735
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:24,320
Sure.

1736
01:56:24,730 --> 01:56:27,430

Listen to me carefully.

We've spoke with all the
zillas, talukas and villages.

1742
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:50,580
They have to reach the spot.

1743
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:53,180
Government's death
bell will ding.

1744
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,430
And death bells...

1745
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:58,200
...should reach CM's ears.

1746
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,400
Wow, Saumitra.

1747
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:03,610
Wow!

1748
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,600

Sachin, be careful of the chair.

1752

The legs of your
chair are shaking.

1753
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,460
I know, how to handle the chair.

1754
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:31,630
You all were good
with the campaigns.

1755
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:35,970
Impressive!
- You got impressed?

1756
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,430
Then get ready to get depressed.

1757
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,530
Get ready to be at home...

1758
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,650
...honorable Sachin Majumdar.

1759
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:50,900
Yes.
- You are too eager.

1760
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:53,880
Some people...

1761
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:56,460
...applauded out of excitement.

1762
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:57,930
And you became a politician?

1763
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:01,420
This is politics and here...

1764
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,230
...digits is the game.

1765

I have disappeared...

1766
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:11,000
...all the MLA's.

1767
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:15,370
So I will win now.

1768
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:17,250
And you will lose.

1769
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:19,430
Game over.

1770
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:24,980
And yes.

1771
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:27,060
It's 7 O'clock already.

1772
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:30,920
Ding your death bell.

1773
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:14,470
This is our politicians
Benami property list.

1774
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,510
Ask our team to cases them all.

1775
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:20,920
Whoever interrupts, break them.

1776
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:24,640
Malhar, what if someone
gets hurt in this?

1777
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:26,770
Pal, this is Benami property.

1778
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:28,810
You won't find honest souls there.

1779
01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:32,010
Politicians stooges
needs to be trashed.

1780

They have had enough
with others money.

01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,730
Now let us make them
face tough times.

1786

Mom!

1787
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:55,580
There's no water here.

1788
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,280
Forget that.
Maid has not come today.

1789
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:00,710
No milk is supplied and I am
deprived of tea since morning.

1790
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:02,990
Including the newspaper.

1791
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:04,150
Uncle Dilip.

1792
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:06,170
Uncle Dilip.

1793
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:09,470
Yes.
- Is water supply in your house?

1794
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:11,180
Yes.

1795
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:14,210
And milkman?
- Yes.

1796
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,830
He didn't come to us.

1797
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:18,210
Including the newspaper.
- Hello, dad.

1798
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:20,310
Where are you?

1799
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:21,800
There' no water supply...

1800
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:23,550
...and I've applied face pack.

1801
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:25,480
Get water and electricity
supply in all the houses. -Sir.

1802
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:26,690
We are cops.

1803
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:28,910
Not a plumber or an electrician.

1804
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:31,790
No one is proving my family
with household groceries.

1805
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:34,820
Sir, my family couldn't
get out even while covered.

1806
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:37,530
Sir, our family is important.

1807
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,350
If our families are safe...

1808
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:41,810
...then we will fight and
win the elections once again.

1809
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:43,520
For now, here is my resignation.

1810
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,070
Mine too.

1811
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:48,900
Sir, a call from Delhi.

1812
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,070
Yes, sir.

1813
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,200
No. Everything is all right.

1814
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:00,310
Okay.

1815
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,850
HM.

1816
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:09,440
No MLA should not leave now.

1817
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:12,650
The matter has reached
the high command.

1818
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,680
So here is the breaking
news once again.

1819
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,750
The political situation
in the state...

1820
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:20,470
...has faced another trouble.

1821
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:23,100
11 MLA's have resigned.

1822
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,680
CM has got an order from Delhi.

1823
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:28,380
Mr.Mansukh's death mystery
will soon get solved...

1824
02:01:28,410 --> 02:01:30,120
...sources as per CBI.

1825
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:33,600
So with this,
here ends today's news.

1826
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:35,930
This is subjects power.

1827
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:39,110
The subjects who
can elect the MLA...

1828
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:40,560
...can compel...

1829
02:01:40,990 --> 02:01:43,310
...them to quit in no time.

1830
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:44,920
11 MLA's have resigned.

1831
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:47,660
And 101 MLA's are still left.

1832
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:51,370
If we deduct eight,
there won't be any majority.

1833
02:01:51,870 --> 02:01:53,620
One down.

1834
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:05,770
Suddenly?

1835
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:09,390
Normally, a father jacks
for their children.

1836
02:02:09,730 --> 02:02:12,500
But we are here for our fathers.

1837
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:15,530
What? - Our fathers
intends to work with you.

1838
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:16,980
Will you approve them?

1839
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,150
But who are they?

1840
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:22,860
We have done a lot of wrongdoings.

1841
02:02:23,070 --> 02:02:26,120
Till now, we did everything
for our children.

1842
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:27,490
We perceived...

1843
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:29,370
...that our children
should be like us.

1844
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:32,340
But you are their role model.

1845
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:34,280
And so we are with you.

1846
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:36,170
You are not with me.

1847
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:38,920
But with state's subjects.

1848
02:02:39,290 --> 02:02:40,460
Yes.
- Yes.

1849
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,060
Dad, uncle.

1850
02:02:43,090 --> 02:02:44,950
Malhar has hired you.

1851
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:46,600
It calls for a selfie now.

1852
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:52,540
Sir, four MLA's are with Malhar.

1853
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:54,820
Which means 97 in total.

1854
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,550
If we add these two...

1855
02:02:56,670 --> 02:02:59,130
...then five more than majority.

1856
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:03,390
HM.

1857
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:05,270
The people in Th selfie...

1858
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:08,630
...should not reach
Vidhan Sabha to vote.

1859
02:03:09,370 --> 02:03:12,300
Position our police and other men.

1860
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:14,180
They should not reach.

1861
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:16,660
And we will automatically win.

1862
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:20,010
Wow!

1863
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:22,040
This might be the first
event in the country...

1864
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:24,780
...where the youth has shattered the
government with majority votes.

1865
02:03:24,910 --> 02:03:26,960
To Vidhan Sabha.
- Sure.

1866
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:29,520
Not even films has such suspense.

1867
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:33,140
In today's contest,
you have to answer...

1868
02:03:33,450 --> 02:03:35,250
...will Malhar take
down the government?

1869
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:38,640
Sir, what do you think?
Will Malhar succeed?

1870
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:41,230
Not so easily.

1871
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,450
This is all official in overseas.

1872
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:45,920
Should I call the radio guy?

1873
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,340
Yes. Dial him.

1874
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:49,860
So, I await your quick answers.

1875
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:51,890
Mulji speaking.
- Yes.

1876
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:54,090
I bet, Malhar will win.

1877
02:03:54,450 --> 02:03:55,920
He will win.

1878
02:04:02,370 --> 02:04:05,500
Let us begin for motion
of no confidence voting.

1879
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:09,970
The game has begun.

1880
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:11,800
Voting has begun.

1881
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:14,980
But Malhar and some
MLA's are missing.

1882
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:29,130
It digits are increasing.

1883
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:32,070
And government is getting
stronger with every vote.

1884
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:03,880
Hold them.

1885
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:26,590
Has Malhar accepted his defeat?

1886
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,900
It seems as the state subjects...

1887
02:05:28,930 --> 02:05:30,920
...expectations has once again...

1888
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,860
...gone in vain.

1889
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,690
Last 15 minutes for voting.

1890
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:59,750
But there's no update
about Malhar yet.

1891
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:13,130
Hit them.

1892
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:15,110
Hit them.
- Hit them.

1893
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:17,330
Hit them.
- Run.

1894
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,760
Save us.
- Leave us.

1895
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:26,590
Save us.
- Leave us.

1896
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:27,800
Save us.
- Leave us.

1897
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:29,270
Save us.
- Leave us.

1898
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:31,210
Save us.
- Leave us.

1899
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:33,480
Save us.
- Leave us.

1900
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:06,640
Breaking news.

1901
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:08,920
Malhar Palladia and MLA's...

1902
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,370
...have reached Vidhan Sabha
in injured state. -Hurry up.

1903
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:14,740
Hurry up.
- Take a close up.

1904
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:16,530
Injured state!
- Saumitra.

1905
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,400
They have reached
the Vidhan Sabha.

1906
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:20,520
Sir, hang on.

1907
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:22,640
Sir, hang on.
- Later.

1908
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:23,810
Later.

1909
02:07:23,830 --> 02:07:25,190
Let us see...

1910
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:28,410
...how much blood will this
motion of no confidence ask for?

1911
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:41,150
Hello.
- How are you?

1912
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:49,530
The way was too long.

1913
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:53,970
But we finally reached
the destination.

1914
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,140
But government still
has five votes of MLA's.

1915
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:03,480
And government will
not get defeated.

1916
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:26,890
'You are gone.'

1917
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:31,790
'He is right.'

1918
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:34,350
'Here is CM's statement.'

1919
02:08:35,490 --> 02:08:38,290
'CM has mentioned you
being responsible...'

1920
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,320
'...for Mr.Mansukh's death.'

1921
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:43,420
'Whenever he faces tough times...'

1922
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:48,440
'...he slaughters his
closest one first.'

1923
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:52,540
'You know the history.'

1924
02:08:52,990 --> 02:08:55,820
'You will have to help us
in taking down government.'

1925
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:59,780
'You and some more MLA's...'

1926
02:09:00,330 --> 02:09:02,210
'...will vote against
the government.'

1927
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:07,830
'Because if the
government wins...'

1928
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:10,260
'...you will die.'

1929
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,820
As per the sources...

1930
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,350
...voting has concluded.

1931
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:38,990
Let us see,
if government could survive in...

1932
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:41,010
...motion of no confidence.

1933
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:43,960
Whether we win or lose.

1934
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:47,430
We have fought well.

1935
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:50,480
Right. And...

1936
02:09:52,170 --> 02:09:54,130
...subjects are awakened too.

1937
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:57,560
That's the actual victory.

1938
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:03,640
The votes have been counted.

1939
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:06,630
Government has got 90 votes.

1940
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,710
Whereas 94 against the government.

1941
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,380
Government could not
prove their majority.

1942
02:10:16,580 --> 02:10:20,630
And so with the immediate effect,
government gets discarded.

1943
02:10:21,150 --> 02:10:23,490
We won!

1944
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:29,250
Brother is here.

1945
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:38,000
He is here.

1946
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:42,230
He is here.

1947
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:47,650
My Saheb is here.

1948
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:53,850
Brother is here.

1949
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,220
Whoa!

1950
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:03,840
This boy defeated us in our game.

1951
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:07,460
He defeated you. Stop the car.

1952
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,680
You intended to strangle me.
I have cut your wings.

1953
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:14,270
I have provided all
the evidences...

1954
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,690
...of yours against
Mr.Mansukh's death. Bye.

1955
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:29,510
Congratulations!

1956
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:34,140
Malhar, this is your victory.

1957
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,420
You are our new CM.

1958
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:41,860
CM!

1959
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:44,280
CM!

1960
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,720
CM!

1961
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:49,190
CM!

1962
02:11:49,210 --> 02:11:51,490
CM!

1963
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,800
CM!

1964
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:04,750
I feel, to take down
government is easier...

1965
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:06,790
...than delivering a speech.

1966
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:17,840
But remember.

1967
02:12:20,070 --> 02:12:21,530
The campaign does not...

1968
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:24,230
...stop by defeating
the government.

1969
02:12:28,020 --> 02:12:31,670
It's not necessary that every
campaign has a politician in it.

1970
02:12:34,270 --> 02:12:37,150
Not all the campaigns are
meant for political career.

1971
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,770
But for transformation.

1972
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:43,490
And my protest...

1973
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:47,680
...is not against
any particular party.

1974
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:49,440
But is against
the entire system.

1975
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:56,870
And so...

1976
02:12:58,850 --> 02:12:59,880
...at this moment...

1977
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:04,940
...I reject the CM seat.

1978
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:11,500
I am just a student leader.

1979
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:16,740
The college campus bench needs me.

1980
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:27,730
Because there...

1981
02:13:28,510 --> 02:13:30,110
...the students who
sits next to me...

1982
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,730
...are common man.

1983
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:36,330
Common man means CM.

1984
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:45,150
It is more than enough...

1985
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:51,920
...if no follows Purvi
or Hari's footsteps.

1986
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:02,550
Your party will govern now.

1987
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:06,520
Remember one thing.

1988
02:14:08,150 --> 02:14:09,190
It's a warning.

1989
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:13,340
If you choose
political benefits...

1990
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:16,180
...over subjects...

1991
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:21,740
...then Sahebs will merge from
all the colleges once again.

1992
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,970
And get down your government.

1993
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:29,160
Remember the name.

1994
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:39,040
Saheb.

1995
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:41,770
The triumph of victory played.

1996
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:48,710
Warriors, wake up now.

1997
02:14:53,410 --> 02:14:57,010
A conch plays.

1998
02:14:58,390 --> 02:15:02,440
A wisdom has awakened.

1999
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:07,710
Awakens the havoc within.

2000
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,250
Reminds of the
forgotten conscience.

2001
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:14,220
Lights up.

2002
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:18,610
Enlightens us.

2003
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:27,270
A conch plays.

2004
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:32,830
A wisdom has awakened.

2005
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:37,890
A conch plays.

2006
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:41,410
A wisdom has awakened.

2007
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:45,060
Awakens the havoc within.

2008
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:48,400
Reminds of the
forgotten conscience.

2009
02:15:48,430 --> 02:15:51,220
Lights up.

2010
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:55,870
Enlightens us.

2011
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:02,040
Lights up.

2012
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:05,460
Lights up.

2013
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:10,180
Lights up.

2014
02:16:10,570 --> 02:16:16,990
Enlightens us.

2015
02:16:17,150 --> 02:16:25,150
Awakens the havoc within.

2016
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:35,200
Lights up.

2017
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:21,100
Resounds.

2018
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,050
A war resounds.

2019
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:27,920
It takes.

2020
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:31,480
It takes color red.

2021
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:35,080
Awakens the spirit of war.

2022
02:17:35,210 --> 02:17:38,710
Sparkles the blown fire.

2023
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:41,530
Lights us.

2024
02:17:41,780 --> 02:17:46,600
Enlightens us.

2025
02:17:56,510 --> 02:18:00,100
A conch plays.

2026
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:05,580
A wisdom has awakened.

2027
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:10,830
Awakens the havoc within.

2028
02:18:10,860 --> 02:18:14,200
Reminds of the
forgotten conscience.
