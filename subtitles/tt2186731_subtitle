1
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,404
He was unarmed.

2
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:53,014
Yet you shot him.

3
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:54,307
Publicly.

4
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,976
You're a police officer.

5
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,542
You can't take law
in your own hands.

6
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,554
Sir, he was Mohammad
Gori's trusted shooter.

7
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,355
He killed five innocent
people in last two months.

8
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:03,551
I didn't want to risk more lives...

9
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,457
...by giving him an
opportunity to flee.

10
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:06,460
So you killed him.

11
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:08,929
There should be a
difference between them and us.

12
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,461
What is the law for?

13
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,501
The law isn't just for gangsters.

14
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,365
It should also help
the police sometimes.

15
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,598
Sometimes police
officers like you forget this.

16
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:17,897
Don't try to teach me...

17
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:21,102
...what I should remember,
and what not.

18
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:24,442
Until we don't conduct an
inquiry on your actions...

19
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,572
...you're hereby suspended.

20
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,637
Who are you?

21
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:00,379
Shetty sent me.

22
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,516
Where is he? - Inside.

23
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:09,018
What do you mean? - In the lock up.

24
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:12,293
No need to worry.

25
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,861
Shetty has given me permission...

26
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:19,028
...to carry out the deal that
you were going to do with him.

27
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:23,038
Whatever is going on
between Sawatya and Gori...

28
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,869
...you know that very well.

29
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:26,608
Don Manjarekar is dead as well.

30
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,366
Shetty's in the lockup.

31
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,070
So who's left?

32
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:31,504
You.

33
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:34,075
So, what's the point in
fighting amongst ourselves?

34
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:36,210
Are the goods ready?

35
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,581
Where's the money?

36
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:38,985
First the packet.

37
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:50,054
I never saw you with Shetty before.

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,129
How long have you
been working with him?

39
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,002
Since yesterday.

40
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,232
Yesterday? - Yes.

41
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:58,535
I locked him up yesterday.

42
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,158
Why you...

43
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,013
Inspector Bhonsle speaking.

44
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:20,849
Ganga is down.

45
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:24,156
Now there'll be some
peace in the city.

46
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,372
Papa. - Papa.

47
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,941
Papa. Papa.

48
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,318
Another businessman,
Sunil Malhotra...

49
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,824
...was shot dead on the
beach in broad daylight.

50
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:11,587
Like all the other
murders in the past month...

51
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:14,159
...this murder can be the
job of Mohammad Ghori...

52
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,562
...or Sawatya gang.

53
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,165
When Mohammad Ghori and
Sawatya were together...

54
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:21,362
...they had a strong hold on Mumbai.

55
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,838
So strong that there would
be no bloodshed in Mumbai.

56
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,008
But since they separated...

57
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,840
...they've been
shedding blood of not just...

58
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:33,848
...each other's gang members
but also of innocent people...

59
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,942
...just to get a
stronger hold on the city.

60
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:40,613
According to sources...

61
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,053
...Mohammad Ghori has raced ahead.

62
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,026
And has become quite dangerous.

63
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,620
And Sawatya has grown quite weak.

64
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:49,956
Whatever the truth is.

65
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:51,932
But one thing is certain...

66
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:56,904
...that our police
department is doing nothing.

67
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,115
We all know about your
escapades in the police department.

68
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,448
And even know that...

69
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,011
...the underworld is standing
tall on four strong pillars.

70
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,890
The first is, corruption
in the police department.

71
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:22,498
And the second is, businessmen...

72
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,292
...who take the help
of the underworld...

73
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:28,599
...to solve their
personal issues, and fund them.

74
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,273
And the third is politicians...

75
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:36,607
...who involve the underworld
to get rid of their opposition.

76
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,446
And the fourth is, those
who risk their lives...

77
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,643
...only to prove their might.

78
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,409
The gangsters.

79
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:48,388
By studying the
loopholes in our system...

80
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:51,222
...these people have
become so organized...

81
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:55,424
...that our department
has completely failed.

82
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,228
And the department requires...

83
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,201
...constitutional
amendment to deal with them.

84
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:05,168
But, even if that's possible,
it will take a lot of time.

85
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:08,571
So, I've thought about it
and reached a decision...

86
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:13,648
...that, we start another
department along with this one.

87
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:16,380
And this department
can do anything...

88
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:20,253
...which we can't do
due to legal boundaries.

89
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,517
And I want you to
head this department.

90
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,494
And you choose your team as well.

91
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:30,264
Putting it in one line, Mahadev...

92
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:35,164
...consider that your department
has to save our department.

93
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:44,069
Shiv.

94
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,606
What do you think...

95
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,410
...will they ever take you
back in the police force?

96
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,481
I did my job wholeheartedly.

97
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,380
It's difficult to
do a police's job...

98
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,286
...within the legal boundaries.

99
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:58,093
Because one never knows
when that boundary is crossed.

100
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,096
Bharti, my problem is that...

101
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,064
...being a police is not
just another job for me.

102
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,493
I know, Shiv.

103
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,966
That's why I am asking.

104
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,396
If they don't take you back,
then what will you do?

105
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,234
I don't know.

106
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,570
All I know is that I am
made for the police force.

107
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,105
I told at home that
you've been suspended.

108
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,107
So?

109
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:25,317
We've to take our own decision.

110
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,112
What did they say?

111
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:30,049
Bharti.

112
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:34,087
They believe that every
police officer has a trait.

113
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:36,595
What do you think?

114
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,400
I don't know about the
other police officers.

115
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:42,295
But I've never met
anyone nicer than you.

116
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,967
I love you, Shiv. - Me too.

117
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:55,914
Hello. - Shiv.

118
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,148
This is Mahadev.

119
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:58,345
Mahadev?

120
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,446
Did you forget the
'Yerwada' incident so soon?

121
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:02,513
Sir. No, sir.

122
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
How can I forget?

123
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,383
I don't forget easily as well.

124
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:07,160
I want to meet you.

125
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:08,160
When, sir?

126
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:09,989
Tomorrow at 11 o'clock.

127
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,123
I will message you the address.

128
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,329
Who was it?

129
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:16,429
Mahadev sir.

130
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,065
I first met him during
the Yerwada operation.

131
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,907
'We don't know the
exact number yet.'

132
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,904
None of the police top officers...

133
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:27,642
...have reached at the spot.

134
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,477
According to me, only an
angel can save the children now.

135
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,556
Who's the in-charge here?
- Sir, that's me.

136
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,129
What's going on?

137
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,064
Sir, there's was a barricade.

138
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:46,499
Some people fled to break barricade.

139
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,332
When we followed them,
they hid in the building.

140
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:49,632
What is the situation?

141
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:51,395
Sir, along with Khurshid,
there are nine men in there...

142
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,566
...with imported weapons.

143
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,533
They've taken 30-40
blind children as hostage.

144
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,240
Two constables dead,
and one injured.

145
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,577
Inspector.

146
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,411
Save me.

147
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:05,477
Don't throw me down. Save me.

148
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,419
Move back.

149
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,458
Don't you understand?

150
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:13,619
I just want to get out
of here safe and sound.

151
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,064
If you let me go,
everyone will be safe.

152
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,591
Otherwise I will kill all
the children one by one.

153
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:22,103
Like this.

154
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,977
Khurshid just threw
a helpless child...

155
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:34,106
...from the building to his death.

156
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,003
Lawyer sir. Lawyer sir.

157
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,271
Everyone's dead.

158
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:14,342
Now the police are coming,
to kill me.

159
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,202
Khurshid, surrender yourself.

160
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:17,370
I will handle
everything in the court.

161
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,370
Let me talk to the inspector.

162
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:24,910
Here, here.

163
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:26,454
Talk to my lawyer.

164
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:29,251
I want to surrender.

165
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,520
Look, my client wants to surrender.

166
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:32,986
And according to the law...

167
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:34,495
...you'll have to arrest him alive.

168
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:37,498
Who told you that
your client is alive?

169
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,998
What would you
have done in my place?

170
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:47,403
Forgot about his past murders.

171
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,934
He killed two of my
constables right before my eyes.

172
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,863
I heard that you're on a
long leave. - Yes, sir.

173
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:16,996
The witness turned
against me in the Ansari case.

174
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:18,499
And there was an inquiry against me.

175
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:20,238
And suspended.

176
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:25,537
We've a bad habit of
taking risks for our duty.

177
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:26,911
Yes, sir.

178
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:28,114
Anyway, let's forget it.

179
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:29,377
I am making a team.

180
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:32,045
And I want you to be a part of it.

181
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,419
What team? - Department.

182
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:42,493
Our department has just one motive.

183
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:44,899
Underworld.

184
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:50,529
Just like the underworld
is terrorizing the city...

185
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:52,403
...we've to
terrorize the underworld.

186
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,999
They always uphold the law.

187
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:58,375
And we'll teach them a
lesson beyond legal boundaries.

188
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:06,912
We'll have to take strict
decisions in this department.

189
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,256
And we can also make mistakes.

190
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,326
But remember one thing.

191
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:17,495
Mistakes that are made
intentionally, are not mistakes.

192
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:31,969
Gauri. Gauri. Gauri. Quiet, rascals.

193
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,905
Whenever someone mentions Gauri...

194
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:37,008
...I lose my mind.

195
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,148
Guari.

196
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:44,856
And do you see.

197
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,419
The people are saying...

198
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:51,091
...that Gauri is a
bigger man then I am!

199
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:54,159
Bigger man.

200
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,403
But the world doesn't know that...

201
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:06,939
...Gauri made it this far
because Sawatya was behind him.

202
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,175
It was me.

203
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,552
The rascal.

204
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,191
And the scoundrel backstabbed me.

205
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:19,150
If he's a real man...

206
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,992
...then operate from Mumbai like me.

207
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,153
Can he?

208
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,932
He'll die.

209
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:28,970
He'll surely die.

210
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,407
One day that rascal will
surely die by my hands.

211
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:37,034
I will kill him so brutally...

212
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,548
...that everyone will
remember for years to come.

213
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,444
Sawatya, why are you
raking up the past.

214
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:48,412
The past is history...

215
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,955
Let's talk about the present now.

216
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,986
Gauri's men killed
four of our men today.

217
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,193
And you're stopping us.

218
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:10,010
DK, you think Bhairo
will be waiting for you...

219
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:13,047
...saying "Come and kill me".

220
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:16,615
Even if he's, he'll
lying in wait... to kill you.

221
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,916
Don't underestimate Gauri.

222
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:25,184
And what if he
underestimates us in the meanwhile?

223
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:38,931
I admit that you've a sharper mind.

224
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:43,037
But, being
short-tempered doesn't help.

225
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,104
Keep your mind cool.

226
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:49,572
Sometimes, keeping
cool messes up the job.

227
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,619
Listen to me carefully.

228
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:55,654
There's a risk in
killing Bhairo right now.

229
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,591
Our business cannot
survive without taking risks.

230
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:02,358
Sawatya.

231
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:05,958
Our business
thrives on risk and fear.

232
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,606
Nasir is right.

233
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:23,144
In today's time it will be
wrong not to take risks.

234
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,651
And even you made it
this far by taking risks.

235
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:26,045
Hey!

236
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:30,186
I don't have the time
to explain to you two.

237
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:33,052
This is my gang.

238
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:37,029
And everyone will do
as I say. Understand.

239
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:38,589
Rascals.

240
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,996
Be prepared, and I
will tell you the time.

241
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:43,904
Rascals.

242
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:06,490
Sir, I was tired of
deciding what was right and wrong.

243
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:09,428
You did a big favor by
taking me in this department.

244
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:12,124
No one does a favor, Shiv.

245
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:14,432
One only chooses talent.

246
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:16,995
Yes, Satya.

247
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,065
Yes, I am coming.

248
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,074
And I am bringing
my colleague along.

249
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:22,108
Hi, darling.

250
00:23:22,177 --> 00:23:23,940
Why did you take so long?

251
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:25,076
Work.

252
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:26,136
Work!

253
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,213
I thought you grew tired of
me and renounced the world.

254
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,886
Don't listen to her.

255
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,545
She has a humorous nature.

256
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:34,920
Satya, that's Shiv.

257
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,287
Hello. - Hi.

258
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,985
And, Shiv, that's my son Rinku.

259
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:40,583
I am famished.

260
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:42,596
Serve the food quickly,
or I'll eat you.

261
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:44,222
It will scorch your mouth.

262
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,296
Will you take a soft drink,
or direct food?

263
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:49,131
He's Shiv, he can
even eat cold food.

264
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:51,934
Just tell me what you don't like.

265
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,304
Everything except for you.

266
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,935
I mean, everything.

267
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:58,172
But you're special. - Liar.

268
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:01,181
We were at peace until
Gauri and Sawatya...

269
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,248
...were killing each other.

270
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:04,009
Rinku, careful.

271
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:07,153
But suddenly they
changed their strategy.

272
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,984
Enough, sister-in-law.

273
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:10,490
I don't eat too much. Thank you.

274
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:12,588
I am a police officer's daughter...

275
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,886
...and another
police officer's wife.

276
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:18,499
I know how much
police officer's eat.

277
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:22,168
If you like it, ask
your wife to call me.

278
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:24,032
I will tell her the recipe.

279
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:25,630
He's not married yet.

280
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,598
So when do you wish to do it?

281
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:29,102
I haven't thought about it.

282
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,170
Go for arranged marriage.

283
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,448
You cannot trust love marriage.

284
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,176
Hey, I'll slap you.

285
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:38,180
Hey, I am not a pushover gangster.

286
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,987
Do you want me to find a girl?

287
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,479
There's a girl.

288
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:42,921
She's a doctor.

289
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,251
Doctor? And police.

290
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,224
Deadly combination.

291
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:50,296
One will shoot, and
the other will save.

292
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:51,463
Wow.

293
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:03,372
Baby.

294
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,043
Your problem is...
that you just listen.

295
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:11,918
You don't think.

296
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:15,446
Look, why are you starting now?

297
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:16,881
Let me be.

298
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,183
Look, baby.

299
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:21,989
You handle most of
the gang than Sawatya.

300
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:24,863
He gave you a break.

301
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,229
But you don't see his foolishness.

302
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:30,169
Quiet! I am already in a bad mood.

303
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:31,902
Don't make it more.

304
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,201
Just get on with it.

305
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:35,032
You're crazy.

306
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:38,513
That's why I like you.

307
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:44,509
Don't forget, that
Sawatya became what he is...

308
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,518
...only after he
separated from Gauri.

309
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:49,114
Are you instigating me?

310
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,589
Instigating me?

311
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:55,087
But it's not making
any difference to you.

312
00:25:56,631 --> 00:26:00,123
Prove that you're a
man out there, not here.

313
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:04,468
We've just received news
from the Crime Branch...

314
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:08,170
...that Sawatya's men are on
their way to kill exporter Shukla.

315
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:10,945
We don't know who they are.

316
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:12,213
But we do know that...

317
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,239
...when Shukla will be entering
his office from Loban alley...

318
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,848
...that's when they'll attack.

319
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,188
I want everyone to track him.

320
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:23,547
Everyone will be carrying
audio-video transmitters.

321
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,117
Don't leave them alive.

322
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,234
Be ready, he'll be here soon.

323
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,558
Whether its young or old,
man or woman.

324
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,426
Keep an eye on everyone.

325
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:25,918
Don't try to get closer to him.

326
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:36,529
That guy in the yellow shirt,
keep an eye on him.

327
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:56,575
Check that guy
wearing the sunglasses.

328
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,152
No, sir. He's blind.

329
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:06,826
Keep an eye on the
shopkeepers as well.

330
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:57,375
It's not him.

331
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:58,572
Let him go.

332
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:25,066
Shiv. Shiv. - Sir.

333
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,103
Check that Burqa clad lady.

334
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:34,846
The job's done.

335
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,081
What job? What job?

336
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:44,525
Shiv, that's Bansi.

337
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:01,367
Hello. - Where are the goods?

338
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:02,876
Yes.

339
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:05,105
Danaji. Go closer to Shukla.

340
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,340
I want to hear.

341
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:12,110
Danaji. Shukla can be
attacked any second.

342
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,603
Give me alms. Give me alms.

343
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,910
Get lost.

344
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:52,916
Please spare me some alms.
- I said get lost.

345
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:05,264
Get inside.

346
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,608
How many are they? - Three, sir.

347
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:26,155
Quiet.

348
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:35,230
Shiv, get rid of Bansi
and get back to Shukla.

349
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,903
No, no. Don't kill me.

350
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,908
Done, sir.

351
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,084
Those three beggar
have weapons, understand.

352
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,320
Attack from behind.

353
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:48,166
You're on a roll.

354
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:49,401
Look.

355
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,577
Your photo's on the front page.

356
00:32:52,146 --> 00:32:53,408
What about us?

357
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:56,146
Side-heroes never
appear on the papers.

358
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:58,574
So, Shiv.

359
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,415
Your girlfriend must
be really happy...

360
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:01,386
...to see your
photo on the newspaper.

361
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:04,084
With the police, or someone else.

362
00:33:05,627 --> 00:33:09,222
Dinner for everyone at
my home on behalf of Shiv.

363
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,129
That rascal Mahadev.

364
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:15,959
I know he follows Guari's orders.

365
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:20,574
He follows his instructions.

366
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:29,411
If Mahadev works for Gauri...

367
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:33,444
...then why did he
kill 12 of his men?

368
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,923
They shook hands only
after those killings.

369
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:39,118
Shut up.

370
00:33:40,295 --> 00:33:44,026
Often we find
faults with the enemy...

371
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:47,295
...to ignore our own faults.

372
00:33:48,636 --> 00:33:50,103
She's right.

373
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:55,406
We'll have to change to take
care of the entire department.

374
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,171
What? - Strategy.

375
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:05,851
You're asking me to take
up Gauri's plan of action.

376
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:07,376
No.

377
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,321
No.

378
00:34:10,158 --> 00:34:12,922
I am asking you to make your own.

379
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:15,186
If you change your style slightly...

380
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,491
...then it'll make a
difference to the gang as well.

381
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:18,361
Shut up, rascal.

382
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,572
If the crow wants to
be white like the swan...

383
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,611
...will he chafe
himself on the ground?

384
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,510
It'll peel your skin off.

385
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,607
Why don't we kill
those department people?

386
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:38,578
Correct.

387
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,309
You're absolutely right.

388
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:42,989
Let's make those
department people history.

389
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,289
DK.

390
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,895
If you try to make
the police history...

391
00:34:49,263 --> 00:34:51,356
...then you won't survive either.

392
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:58,263
The world...

393
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:04,875
I never miss.

394
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:13,210
The underworld
survives in this world...

395
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:16,620
...due to the mercy
and greed of the police.

396
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:19,386
If you kill a
single police officer...

397
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:23,588
...then the entire
department will come after you.

398
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:25,929
You won't get a chance to breathe.

399
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:27,633
Remember that.

400
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,363
Understand.

401
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,131
Never hurt the police.

402
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,401
Understand?

403
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:45,450
He was scared. Otherwise I
would've killed him right there.

404
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,010
Here.

405
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:50,048
Bharti. Danaji.

406
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,258
Pradhan.

407
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:52,654
Sheik.

408
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,025
Vedekar.

409
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:56,120
I am Satya. - Hi.

410
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,257
The most difficult job in
the world is to kill someone.

411
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:01,326
You're a doctor.

412
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:02,995
You can understand that.

413
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:04,970
Look.

414
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,134
If someone's develops a
gang-grin on his leg...

415
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,036
...then you amputate the part.

416
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,971
The only difference is that...

417
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:15,240
...you do it on the
operation table...

418
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,348
...and we do it out on the streets.

419
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,314
Patients come to you.

420
00:36:20,955 --> 00:36:22,445
And we've to search for them.

421
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:27,360
But in the end,
our duty is the same.

422
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:29,362
To protect people.

423
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,530
I still remember... when Mahadev...

424
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,495
...came home after killing someone.

425
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:44,239
I was feeling awful seeing
the bloodstains on his shirt.

426
00:36:46,114 --> 00:36:48,480
But someone will
have to get dirty...

427
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:51,916
...to clear the
garbage of this city.

428
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:56,482
And, Bharti, not
everyone can do this.

429
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,392
That's why Mahadev chose Shiv.

430
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,331
By the way, it just occurred to me.

431
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,191
Both their names mean the same.

432
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,331
Lord Shankar.

433
00:37:10,404 --> 00:37:12,099
Let's just forget about this.

434
00:37:12,874 --> 00:37:16,366
Bharti, you and Shiv are
a part of our family now.

435
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:23,011
If you ever have a problem,
tell me first.

436
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,016
Thank you.

437
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,146
Thank you so much.

438
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,244
Thanks, Shiv.

439
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:28,219
Thanks for what?

440
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,281
I met Mahadev and
Satya because of you.

441
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,348
That's why.

442
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,253
Fine.

443
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,031
Shiv.

444
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,092
We just received news that one
of Sawatya's biggest goon...

445
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,364
...is coming to Tadka club.

446
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,401
We'll have to go there in disguise.

447
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,464
But, sir. What is his name?

448
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,610
Some girl called
Genie is his girlfriend.

449
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,384
"All my ladies... yo step aside."

450
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:04,049
"We're going to turn the
heat up in this joint."

451
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:06,485
"Coz we got a new girl in town."

452
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:09,891
"Here's introducing..."

453
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:15,197
"...the girl from
overseas in local style."

454
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:20,540
"Its Genie... genie... genie..."

455
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:23,099
"Come out Genie."

456
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:26,443
"Genie... genie... genie..."

457
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,574
"Genie, you're defamed."

458
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,986
"You're so fast, hit the brakes."

459
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:36,080
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

460
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:39,126
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

461
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:42,458
"Look at me and blow a whistle."

462
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:51,297
"Forget all the pain in your heart."

463
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:54,306
"Shake your body."

464
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,401
"Jump start this night."

465
00:38:57,478 --> 00:39:00,345
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

466
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:03,281
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

467
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:07,413
"Change the condition of
your heart, take a shot."

468
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:34,106
"Have dose of fun."

469
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:37,844
"Stop racking your brains,
put a lid on it."

470
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:43,148
"Have dose of fun."

471
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:46,250
"Stop racking your brains,
put a lid on it."

472
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,124
"You'll gel in with the world."

473
00:39:49,196 --> 00:39:52,427
"All the useless things
will start making sense."

474
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,560
"Let the beat heat you up."

475
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:58,400
"It'll create an ambience."

476
00:39:58,472 --> 00:40:01,635
"Indulge your heart in some fun."

477
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:04,470
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

478
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:07,378
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

479
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:10,042
"Embrace the darkness of the night."

480
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,379
"Put your hands up."

481
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,056
"This is how it should be."

482
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,390
"Can you take this pressure now?"

483
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,228
"Can you survive this pressure now?"

484
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,358
"Change the crap boy."

485
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,164
"What're you gonna do?"

486
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,601
"Can you take this pressure now?"

487
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:32,298
"Can you survive this pressure now?"

488
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:33,373
"Change the crap boy."

489
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:34,998
"What're you gonna do?"

490
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:38,373
"Drinking, drinking,
everybody sinking."

491
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:41,438
"Drinking, drinking,
everybody sinking."

492
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:53,686
"Genie... genie... genie..."

493
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:56,619
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

494
00:40:56,697 --> 00:40:59,666
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

495
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:02,630
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

496
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,903
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

497
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,192
"Whatever it is, it feels less."

498
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:39,933
"The world seems so slippery."

499
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:45,278
"Whatever it is, it feels less."

500
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:48,371
"The world seems so slippery."

501
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:51,317
"Pour the gin out of the bottle."

502
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:54,411
"Let the magic spread."

503
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:57,447
"Treat your heart, give it neat."

504
00:41:57,525 --> 00:42:00,358
"Let the ambience change."

505
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:03,363
"Why so scared, let it go."

506
00:42:03,431 --> 00:42:06,457
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

507
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:09,503
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

508
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,370
"There's the pot hanging,
jump up and break it."

509
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:20,045
"Catch it, catch it."

510
00:42:25,152 --> 00:42:28,121
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

511
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:31,249
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

512
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,122
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

513
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:38,097
"Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai."

514
00:44:49,363 --> 00:44:53,629
Sawtya, the department is
killing all our best shooters...

515
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:57,103
...and it doesn't mean
that we don't do anything.

516
00:44:57,504 --> 00:44:59,665
Gauri gang will grow past us.

517
00:45:00,274 --> 00:45:01,901
I saw it on television today.

518
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:04,536
The media is making us a joke.

519
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:08,507
It this continues, then soon
even the people will mock us.

520
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:09,913
This is the right time.

521
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:11,076
Let's kill them all.

522
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,946
People salute miracle.

523
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,351
And we've to show a
miracle right now.

524
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:17,323
And anyway, we're in the showbiz.

525
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,259
The film and underworld
business runs on publicity.

526
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:23,192
I've been in this
business for so long...

527
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:26,522
...but I never needed it.

528
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:29,092
Publicity.

529
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:31,899
It's the need of time. - Fine!

530
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,101
In this business, I've
always done as I will.

531
00:45:37,911 --> 00:45:39,538
But I feel that you'll
have to pay dearly...

532
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:44,108
...for what you're
going to do, remember that.

533
00:45:44,518 --> 00:45:49,546
But... this time I
will listen to you.

534
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,527
Thank you. - Fine.

535
00:45:56,163 --> 00:46:01,465
"The one with the might,
has always been right."

536
00:46:01,535 --> 00:46:07,098
"With a gun in his hands,
he runs the government."

537
00:46:07,174 --> 00:46:10,166
"The horse is always
restless when it's tied."

538
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:12,940
"Let it roam free
and gallop around."

539
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:17,882
"It stays restless all day."

540
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:20,182
"My mind's short-tempered."

541
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:23,953
"Hunger's shameless."

542
00:46:24,024 --> 00:46:26,254
"Yes, I'm twitchy."

543
00:46:26,593 --> 00:46:29,494
"Once more, let the
scorecard go high.

544
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,158
"One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven."

545
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:34,994
"Whoever I get my hands on,
is done for good."

546
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:37,594
"So you've no stature?"

547
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:40,499
"Nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen."

548
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:46,069
"Department. De... Department."

549
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:51,449
"Department. De... Department."

550
00:46:54,555 --> 00:46:55,920
"All the files are in dust."

551
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:57,183
"Court cases are a disease."

552
00:46:57,257 --> 00:46:58,588
"Just a bullet,
that's all you need."

553
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:00,024
"Put an end to this scuffle."

554
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:01,527
"Jail, bail, known-unknown."

555
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:02,927
"Cheating, deceit."

556
00:47:02,996 --> 00:47:04,088
"Cut the long story short."

557
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:05,495
"So, why stretch it long."

558
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,533
"My mind's short-tempered."

559
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:11,063
"Hunger's shameless."

560
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:13,366
"Yes, I'm twitchy."

561
00:47:14,174 --> 00:47:16,836
"Once more, let the
scorecard go high.

562
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,470
"One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven."

563
00:47:19,913 --> 00:47:22,347
"Whoever I get my hands on,
is done for good."

564
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:25,145
"So you've no stature?"

565
00:47:25,285 --> 00:47:26,877
You got your publicity.

566
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:30,155
I lost 15 of my men in one month.

567
00:47:31,592 --> 00:47:34,584
And the department is
after us like hungry dogs.

568
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:35,590
Rascal.

569
00:47:35,863 --> 00:47:38,855
In the Mahabharat,
Lord Krishna said...

570
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:42,858
..."Only do your deed,
and forget about the rest".

571
00:47:43,937 --> 00:47:45,029
I see.

572
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:48,140
So, now you read the Gita as
well along with the Koran?

573
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:51,575
Actually, I've read
the bible as well.

574
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:53,010
Don't try to teach me.

575
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:56,412
DK, how long will follow
this woman's instructions?

576
00:47:56,483 --> 00:47:58,110
She'll get us killed,
I am telling you.

577
00:47:58,485 --> 00:47:59,918
Now you're getting personal.

578
00:48:03,957 --> 00:48:06,221
If its personal then why
bring her to the gang.

579
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:08,226
How many times have I told you...

580
00:48:08,328 --> 00:48:10,888
...I don't want girls in the gang!

581
00:48:10,964 --> 00:48:11,988
Hey.

582
00:48:16,336 --> 00:48:17,963
I am as good as any man.

583
00:48:18,572 --> 00:48:21,598
I've killed three of Shetty's men.

584
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:25,408
Except for DK, can anyone
else from your gang do that?

585
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:29,245
No matter how difficult a job you
gave me, but I was never sacred.

586
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,414
This isn't right.

587
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:35,349
Just because I am a woman,
you think I am not equal.

588
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,050
This isn't right.

589
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:38,887
Be quiet.

590
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:41,325
And you're
instigating DK against me.

591
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:42,986
I am instigating him?

592
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,190
Me? - Yes.

593
00:48:44,364 --> 00:48:45,456
Me?

594
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:47,865
Yes.

595
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:50,396
Please.

596
00:48:53,874 --> 00:48:55,000
Sorry.

597
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:58,008
He said sorry. He
said sorry, didn't he?

598
00:48:58,445 --> 00:48:59,377
Forget it.

599
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:01,004
I said sorry.

600
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,082
Take care of her.

601
00:49:18,298 --> 00:49:20,596
We've been eradicating
Sawatya gang members.

602
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:23,203
But we completely
forgot about Gauri.

603
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:26,298
What could be the reason?

604
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,965
Gauri gang is more
organized than Sawatya...

605
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:31,235
...that's why
they've survived so long.

606
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:33,344
Can I ask a question?

607
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:36,311
When you leave for work?

608
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:40,976
I mean after killing someone...
- Mother.

609
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:42,244
Let her ask.

610
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,584
I mean, can you do
your normal chores...

611
00:49:46,627 --> 00:49:49,118
...after killing someone?

612
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:51,190
Can you sleep at nights?

613
00:49:51,899 --> 00:49:54,129
Aunt, I am just
coming from an encounter.

614
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:56,159
And I am sitting here,
drinking tea...

615
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:57,999
...and asking for your
daughter's hand in marriage.

616
00:49:59,373 --> 00:50:01,341
Shiv always had a
feeling of patriotism in him...

617
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:03,342
...since he was a child.

618
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,033
And killing criminals...

619
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:07,342
I don't know how patriotic I am.

620
00:50:08,982 --> 00:50:12,076
All I know is that I do
my job with conviction.

621
00:50:14,254 --> 00:50:16,051
I want to ask you a question.

622
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:18,950
Can you...

623
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:24,023
I mean, get yourself transferred
in a nice, clean department.

624
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:26,396
I am proud of my job.

625
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:30,597
What are you doing, mother? - What?

626
00:50:30,938 --> 00:50:31,996
Shiv, come quickly.

627
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:33,194
We've received news of...

628
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:34,900
...the assassination
of Sarjay Rao Gaikwad.

629
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,064
I'm coming.

630
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:37,909
Sorry, something urgent has come up.

631
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:40,409
What else?

632
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:42,137
Must have to kill someone?

633
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:46,377
Sarjay Rao Gaikwad.

634
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:51,052
Earlier he used to
work for a gangster.

635
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:54,059
Then he killed his own
boss and took his place.

636
00:50:54,294 --> 00:50:58,230
And suddenly, one
day he joined politics.

637
00:50:58,298 --> 00:51:00,027
Some people say that
he joined politics...

638
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,328
...for his personal interest.

639
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:04,370
And he says that he did
so to serve the people.

640
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:09,206
Only the Lord knows
the truth, or Sarjay Rao.

641
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:12,304
But few people still believe that...

642
00:51:13,146 --> 00:51:14,477
...there's no one more
dangerous than him...

643
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:18,075
...not just in the underworld,
but also in politics.

644
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:21,379
What are you saying?

645
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,421
How much are you willing to pay?

646
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:31,253
You say it.

647
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:33,422
You came to me.

648
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,631
You must have a price in mind.

649
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:38,029
50.

650
00:51:38,205 --> 00:51:40,036
50 crores.

651
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:50,510
What is your name?

652
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:53,110
Lalchand. - Lalchand.

653
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:56,979
Lalchand.

654
00:51:57,457 --> 00:51:58,549
Sit. - No, no.

655
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:01,157
No, its okay. - Sit.

656
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:09,061
Look, Lalchand.

657
00:52:09,102 --> 00:52:14,096
The Lord has...

658
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:16,142
When did you arrive?

659
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:17,642
I am coming.

660
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,208
What was I saying? Yes.

661
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:26,916
The Lord has created
everything invaluable in this world.

662
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,389
We humans put a price on everything.

663
00:52:32,492 --> 00:52:36,155
When I used to run a gang...

664
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:38,521
...I never needed money.

665
00:52:39,232 --> 00:52:40,199
Do you know why?

666
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,199
Because, anything I would set
my sights on, would be mine.

667
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:47,404
Then suddenly, I had
the same experience...

668
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:52,273
...under the Dharavi
signal which Gautam Buddh did...

669
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:54,074
...under the tree.

670
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:56,211
Enlightenment.

671
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:58,382
Enlightenment.

672
00:52:59,419 --> 00:53:03,082
Money is not
everything in this world.

673
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:08,961
You need the love of people,
respect, honor.

674
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:12,862
So, considering this
the message for Lord...

675
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:17,199
...I left the
underworld and joined politics.

676
00:53:17,938 --> 00:53:23,399
And became invaluable.

677
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:26,006
60 crores.

678
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:30,042
60 Cr. Cash.

679
00:53:39,192 --> 00:53:40,523
He didn't understand.

680
00:53:49,302 --> 00:53:51,293
Those who don't understand...

681
00:53:51,404 --> 00:53:53,964
...I explain them in my style.

682
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:57,270
And then they can't
explain to anyone.

683
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,310
Sorry, sorry, Sarjay Rao.

684
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:01,209
I didn't mean that.

685
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:06,284
My brother... Walchand...

686
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:11,284
just get my brand name
back from him anyhow.

687
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:12,916
Please.

688
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:15,188
PC...

689
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,361
Call Walchand.

690
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,269
Wal... Walchand.

691
00:54:25,939 --> 00:54:27,338
Sit.

692
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,199
So what were you saying?

693
00:54:31,344 --> 00:54:32,208
What do you sell?

694
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:33,268
Tobacco.

695
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:36,377
You're saying it so proudly...

696
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:39,213
...as if you sell
some ayurvedic paste.

697
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:40,514
Pardon me, sir.

698
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:43,114
Our tobacco sells more
than the ayurvedic paste.

699
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,283
We've a market of 500 cr.

700
00:54:46,393 --> 00:54:51,660
Indians have chewed
tobacco worth 500 cr.

701
00:54:51,932 --> 00:54:53,263
What is the name of your tobacco?

702
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,489
Sheila Tobacco.

703
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:57,069
Out mother's name was Sheila.

704
00:54:57,137 --> 00:55:01,096
Actually, our father passed
Sheila tobacco down to us.

705
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:10,048
God bless the father who left
tobacco for their sons in his will.

706
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:12,615
Forget it.

707
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,317
I will say just one thing.

708
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,185
No more arguments after that.

709
00:55:18,258 --> 00:55:20,158
It'll be final. - Final.

710
00:55:20,227 --> 00:55:22,525
We're here to finalize it here.

711
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:29,560
Lalchand, name your
tobacco Sheila Mix.

712
00:55:31,137 --> 00:55:33,367
Thank you, thank you.

713
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:38,376
And you, Walchand, call
your tobacco, Shiela Remix.

714
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,579
Shiela Remix. -
Give each other a hug.

715
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:46,084
At least do it for
your mother, Sheila.

716
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:47,211
Come on.

717
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,220
What did you say
was Sheila's market?

718
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:57,120
500 cr.

719
00:55:58,531 --> 00:56:00,055
PC.

720
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:04,130
Take 60 cr each for the party fund.

721
00:56:04,471 --> 00:56:05,961
What? - What?

722
00:56:06,439 --> 00:56:08,339
60 cr.

723
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,575
That's my service tax.

724
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:15,172
Calm down.

725
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:17,608
Listen. Listen. Listen.

726
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,417
Look.

727
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:23,946
I don't believe in
either Gandhi or Godse.

728
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,990
I believe in getting rid of poverty.

729
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:34,928
The biggest crime in
this country, is being poor.

730
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:40,629
And all you poor
people are criminals.

731
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:42,468
Criminals.

732
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:48,938
Even after the
country's independence...

733
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:53,610
...you cannot see the noose
of poverty around your necks.

734
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:55,980
You're smiling.

735
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,321
I curse you.

736
00:56:59,893 --> 00:57:03,920
There are many leaders here...

737
00:57:07,033 --> 00:57:09,194
...who are filling
their own pockets.

738
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,532
And emptying yours.

739
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:17,838
You can see their huge buildings...

740
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:19,344
...at every road,
every crossroads...

741
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:21,880
...under the pretext of
computer and social justice.

742
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:24,107
You will only find crows there,
and no one else.

743
00:57:27,253 --> 00:57:31,622
In democracy,
those huge buildings...

744
00:57:31,891 --> 00:57:35,554
...that are constructed in Delhi,
with your money...

745
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:37,186
...what's the purpose of it?

746
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:38,890
Nothing at all.

747
00:57:41,301 --> 00:57:45,260
I, Sarjay Rao...

748
00:57:46,439 --> 00:57:50,466
For the dry and barren
lands of the farmers...

749
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:06,188
How dare you attack from the back?

750
00:58:06,259 --> 00:58:08,159
Face me. Face me.

751
00:58:08,228 --> 00:58:09,354
I will show you.

752
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:11,488
I will show you who is Sarjay Rao.

753
00:58:11,564 --> 00:58:12,929
Leave me.

754
01:01:09,576 --> 01:01:10,600
No, sir. Thank you.

755
01:01:11,044 --> 01:01:12,068
Take it.

756
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,644
Don't think that you saved my life.

757
01:01:20,987 --> 01:01:22,579
You don't know my history.

758
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:27,892
My body has more stitches,
then skin.

759
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:33,229
A 1 A, A1/2 bullet can't kill me.

760
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:38,936
One needs a missile
to kill me. Missile.

761
01:01:40,206 --> 01:01:42,071
Do you know why I was attacked?

762
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:43,568
No, sir.

763
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,536
Because the Lord wanted us to meet.

764
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:52,041
Sir, I suspect that
Gauri put a contract on you.

765
01:01:57,023 --> 01:02:00,390
Who's in your family?
- I'm all alone.

766
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:04,029
No, get married.

767
01:02:04,364 --> 01:02:07,231
Do you have a house? - No, sir.

768
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:09,559
Without a house in Mumbai...

769
01:02:09,636 --> 01:02:12,901
...no sensible father will
let you marry his daughter.

770
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:16,007
PC.

771
01:02:16,075 --> 01:02:18,908
Give him a flat. - Sir. No, sir.

772
01:02:18,978 --> 01:02:20,377
I am giving it.

773
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,573
But, that's... - It's not a bribe.

774
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:24,906
It's not a bribe.

775
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:40,132
A bribe's giving for illegal things.

776
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:44,670
I do legal things illegally.

777
01:02:44,937 --> 01:02:46,666
I never do things
illegal things, legally.

778
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,132
There's a
difference between the two.

779
01:02:48,207 --> 01:02:49,572
You won't understand.

780
01:02:54,013 --> 01:02:56,311
The government notices a
capable police officer...

781
01:02:56,949 --> 01:03:00,908
...only after he's dead.

782
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:04,879
My style is different.

783
01:03:05,591 --> 01:03:06,990
Different style.

784
01:03:11,397 --> 01:03:14,230
You saved my life for
the sake of the country.

785
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:18,100
So, I am gifting you a flat,
on behalf of the government.

786
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,335
Your name, Shiv Narayan.

787
01:03:22,975 --> 01:03:24,499
It's a nice name.

788
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:31,277
Shiva, Narayan. Its catchy.

789
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:48,065
Illegally legal, and
legally illegally...

790
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:51,035
...do you know the
difference between the two?

791
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:52,666
No, sir?

792
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,907
Nothing.

793
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:57,100
It was just a joke.

794
01:04:01,314 --> 01:04:02,576
Illegally legal, and
legally illegally...

795
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:04,913
...do you know the
difference between the two, sir?

796
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,981
Illegally legal, and
legally illegally?

797
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:13,353
What is it?

798
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,587
It's a joke, by Sarjay Rao.

799
01:04:17,363 --> 01:04:18,523
Sarjay Rao.

800
01:04:23,636 --> 01:04:26,104
He's giving you a flat,
and you're happy.

801
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:29,634
He's giving it to you
from the government quota...

802
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,638
...not from his pocket.

803
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:34,877
So, no need to be indebted to him.

804
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,442
That's not it, sir.

805
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:38,006
So?

806
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:40,480
Say it.

807
01:04:41,053 --> 01:04:42,543
No matter what the
people say about him...

808
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:45,249
...but I believe
that he's a clean man.

809
01:04:51,097 --> 01:04:53,088
It's everyone viewpoint, Shiv.

810
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,630
You're happy, aren't you?

811
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,394
So I am happy.

812
01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:00,833
I'm in a good mood today.

813
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:02,841
I feel like
drinking the entire night.

814
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:06,202
Now that you get married, then
we'll have to stop all this.

815
01:05:06,846 --> 01:05:07,505
What, sir?

816
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,569
Come on, let me show you.

817
01:05:08,848 --> 01:05:13,945
"O bartender."

818
01:05:14,387 --> 01:05:19,950
"With this empty glass."

819
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,988
"I am here to..."

820
01:05:27,266 --> 01:05:32,260
"...drink from your eyes."

821
01:05:50,957 --> 01:05:54,586
"Raise your eye-brows."

822
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,187
"Let me drink from your eyes."

823
01:05:58,264 --> 01:06:01,927
"Right here, in your jamboree."

824
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,866
"Come in my arms."

825
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:09,203
"Your beloved's crazy about you."

826
01:06:09,308 --> 01:06:12,505
"I've drunk only a little."

827
01:06:12,979 --> 01:06:16,506
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

828
01:06:16,582 --> 01:06:20,143
"I've drunk only a little."

829
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:24,280
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

830
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:29,885
"O Julie, O Sheela, O Raano,
someone stop me."

831
01:06:29,962 --> 01:06:31,896
"Someone better hold me."

832
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:34,626
"Or I might fall down."

833
01:06:35,234 --> 01:06:38,863
"I've drunk only a little."

834
01:06:38,938 --> 01:06:42,601
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

835
01:07:04,864 --> 01:07:08,129
"Don't compare the
heart with wealth."

836
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,567
"Love is not a deal."

837
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:15,563
"It can severe relation."

838
01:07:15,841 --> 01:07:18,469
"Shatter hearts."

839
01:07:19,378 --> 01:07:26,614
"There are so many sweet
dreams in these eyes."

840
01:07:26,886 --> 01:07:30,447
"Right here in this jamboree."

841
01:07:30,523 --> 01:07:32,150
"Come in my arms."

842
01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:37,856
"Your beloved's crazy about you."

843
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:41,491
"I've drunk only a little."

844
01:07:41,567 --> 01:07:45,230
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

845
01:07:45,338 --> 01:07:49,035
"I've drunk only a little."

846
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:52,635
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

847
01:07:52,912 --> 01:07:58,475
"O Julie, O Sheela, O Raano,
someone stop me."

848
01:07:58,551 --> 01:08:00,451
"Someone better hold me."

849
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:02,544
"Or I might fall down."

850
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:07,290
"I've drunk only a little."

851
01:08:07,326 --> 01:08:11,092
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

852
01:08:11,163 --> 01:08:14,894
"I've drunk only a little."

853
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:18,960
"But I haven't done anything wrong."

854
01:08:25,044 --> 01:08:26,841
But whose flat is this?

855
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,469
The government has
kept a reserved quota...

856
01:08:28,547 --> 01:08:30,174
...for capable officers.

857
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:32,240
And Sarjay Rao has
approved this for me.

858
01:08:33,019 --> 01:08:34,543
Sarjay Rao, minister?

859
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,215
We give free treatment in our hospital
to the poor with his donation.

860
01:08:38,557 --> 01:08:40,115
But how does he know you?

861
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:44,352
Sarjay Rao, we were
just talking about you.

862
01:08:45,564 --> 01:08:47,589
I hope, you were
saying something nice.

863
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:50,492
My fiancA©A© really likes the
flat that you gave me, sir.

864
01:08:50,936 --> 01:08:53,370
FiancA©e.? - Yes, sir.
Name's Bharti.

865
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:54,564
Let me talk to him.

866
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,030
One second, sir.

867
01:08:57,043 --> 01:08:58,032
Hello, sir.

868
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,270
This is Dr. Bharti.

869
01:08:59,578 --> 01:09:00,977
Thank you so very much.

870
01:09:01,047 --> 01:09:02,412
Thanks for what?

871
01:09:02,882 --> 01:09:04,406
What do you mean?

872
01:09:04,817 --> 01:09:06,409
You gave Shiv this flat.

873
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:11,017
And you're the first guest
I'm inviting to our marriage.

874
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,914
I see.

875
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:18,021
Then I will give you the first gift.

876
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:18,494
Yes.

877
01:09:18,564 --> 01:09:20,395
And I will accept
the gift only from you.

878
01:09:20,499 --> 01:09:22,364
So you have to attend the marriage.

879
01:09:22,468 --> 01:09:24,993
Who wants to die by not
listening to the doctor?

880
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:26,197
I will surely come.

881
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:28,032
Thank you so much, sir.

882
01:09:40,519 --> 01:09:42,316
Okay, sir. I am coming right away.

883
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:43,251
Shiv.

884
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:44,151
Sir.

885
01:09:44,523 --> 01:09:45,421
Hi.

886
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:46,423
Hi.

887
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:47,958
Welcome home, sir.

888
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,494
Congratulations. - Thank you.

889
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,557
So, now you've a home.

890
01:09:53,132 --> 01:09:56,101
Mahadev, now you go and
talk to Bharti's parents...

891
01:09:56,168 --> 01:09:59,262
...about their marriage.

892
01:09:59,538 --> 01:10:01,938
Shiv doesn't know how to.

893
01:10:02,374 --> 01:10:04,433
Bharti told me everything.

894
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,001
I was just
answering their questions.

895
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:10,310
Answering their questions or
giving them a heart attack?

896
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:13,416
Hello.

897
01:10:14,353 --> 01:10:16,082
Where is your boss?

898
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:20,586
My boss? - Yes. Bhonsle.

899
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:23,528
Tell him to come and meet me.

900
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:27,191
And you too. - Yes.

901
01:10:31,036 --> 01:10:31,502
Sir.

902
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:36,033
Sir, Sarjay Rao has
called you. - Why?

903
01:10:36,308 --> 01:10:37,070
I don't know.

904
01:10:37,143 --> 01:10:38,167
He just asked you
to come immediately.

905
01:10:52,024 --> 01:10:53,514
Nice shoes.

906
01:10:57,963 --> 01:10:59,123
They're imported, sir.

907
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:02,393
They'll look better if
you keep them outside.

908
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:47,640
What's up with Bajaj?

909
01:11:48,314 --> 01:11:49,611
Who Bajaj, sir?

910
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:53,083
Builder Bajaj.

911
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:07,896
Maybe not you, but
your... boss knows.

912
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:12,894
Your boss.

913
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,384
That's with less sugar.

914
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:32,888
And he has a sweet tooth.

915
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:36,057
A bit too sweet.

916
01:12:39,431 --> 01:12:45,563
Your friend is
threatening my builder friend.

917
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:48,095
Friend?

918
01:12:49,174 --> 01:12:50,436
Gauri.

919
01:12:53,545 --> 01:12:55,172
Mohammad Gauri.

920
01:12:55,514 --> 01:12:58,039
Your boss knows what I'm saying.

921
01:13:01,353 --> 01:13:02,342
He knows.

922
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,855
He knows.

923
01:13:13,532 --> 01:13:21,029
Tell your boss... to tell Gauri...

924
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:28,606
...to call... my friend by
5 o'clock today evening...

925
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:41,950
...and apologise, otherwise...

926
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:00,604
I won't even call.

927
01:14:26,105 --> 01:14:27,333
Sir.

928
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,271
Sir, what was that?

929
01:14:34,146 --> 01:14:35,204
Will you have tea?

930
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:44,547
What do you think?

931
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:47,220
The difference between
Sarjay Rao and Gauri.

932
01:14:47,493 --> 01:14:49,120
Sir, how can you compare those two?

933
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:50,525
You are right.

934
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,260
Sarjay Rao is much more
treacherous than Gauri.

935
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:56,191
Just like you said.

936
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:59,936
You're tired of trying to decide
what's right and what's wrong.

937
01:15:00,406 --> 01:15:03,102
So why are you doing it today?

938
01:15:03,175 --> 01:15:05,905
Sarjay Rao gave you
a flat, so he's nice.

939
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,543
He said Bajaj's a nice man,
so he's a nice man.

940
01:15:08,614 --> 01:15:10,582
I know both of them really well.

941
01:15:11,316 --> 01:15:12,408
Better than you.

942
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:17,446
Shiv, people aren't good or bad.

943
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,859
They are either
intelligent or fools.

944
01:15:25,364 --> 01:15:26,854
No one's right or wrong.

945
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,531
We pick what's right or wrong.

946
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,596
You chose Sarjay Rao,
and I chose Gauri.

947
01:15:32,204 --> 01:15:35,935
And only time will tell who
is right and who is wrong.

948
01:15:36,008 --> 01:15:38,408
Everyone in this
world gets a position.

949
01:15:38,977 --> 01:15:40,501
Sarjay Rao got the
position of a minister.

950
01:15:41,146 --> 01:15:42,340
Bajaj, as a builder.

951
01:15:42,381 --> 01:15:43,609
Gauri, as the don.

952
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:46,443
And us, as police officer.

953
01:15:46,985 --> 01:15:48,976
We should all take
advantage of our position...

954
01:15:49,054 --> 01:15:50,078
...and become someone.

955
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:54,459
If you understand, then
you'll be rolling in money.

956
01:15:55,127 --> 01:15:58,563
And you can never imagine, how much.

957
01:16:16,982 --> 01:16:19,951
I found out something
about someone very close to me.

958
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:23,554
Who? - Someone... I respect a lot.

959
01:16:23,622 --> 01:16:26,523
And today I found out he's
not what I thought he was.

960
01:16:29,094 --> 01:16:31,619
Then how can you
respect someone like that?

961
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:34,329
Bharti, there's right
and wrong in every person.

962
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:37,868
And it's wrong to ignore
the right, for his wrong.

963
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:39,927
What happened suddenly?

964
01:16:47,212 --> 01:16:50,113
I am not right either, that
I can find faults in others.

965
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:55,010
I work for a
department which is illegal.

966
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,285
And for that I killed many people.

967
01:16:58,423 --> 01:17:00,550
It can be right according to me.

968
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:02,919
But what about other's views.

969
01:17:02,995 --> 01:17:05,555
How can you link
these two things, Shiv?

970
01:17:06,398 --> 01:17:08,229
The difference
between right and wrong...

971
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,234
...is like a dead
and a living person.

972
01:17:10,302 --> 01:17:12,395
Knowing what's right and wrong,
makes you the right man.

973
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:17,067
It's not about my thinking,
it's about misconceptions.

974
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:18,439
Whatever.

975
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:22,071
I suggest, that you talk to
brother Mahadev about this.

976
01:17:22,381 --> 01:17:26,181
I am sure no one can
explain you better than him.

977
01:17:29,154 --> 01:17:30,348
You are right.

978
01:17:30,389 --> 01:17:32,914
Sir, I made it this far
today all because of you.

979
01:17:34,459 --> 01:17:37,428
My position, my fame, my house.

980
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:40,164
I got it all because of you.

981
01:17:42,935 --> 01:17:45,301
Whatever you said
is absolutely right.

982
01:17:48,507 --> 01:17:51,476
But I still can't support you.

983
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:54,205
But I will never
cross your path either.

984
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,874
You think I am right,
and my path is wrong.

985
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:01,207
No, sir.

986
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:04,551
Until you don't tread on my path...

987
01:18:04,823 --> 01:18:08,054
...how will you know
whether its right or wrong.

988
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:13,859
First ask yourself who
you're working for, Shiv.

989
01:18:14,366 --> 01:18:16,095
The society or the system.

990
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:18,332
It won't make a difference to them.

991
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:20,096
What do you think...

992
01:18:20,572 --> 01:18:22,870
...after
eradicating the underworld...

993
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:25,876
...there won't be anyone
else to take its place?

994
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:29,107
There's no guarantee to that, Shiv.

995
01:18:29,948 --> 01:18:31,973
This is a never-ending cycle.

996
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:36,919
Nothing in this world ever ends.

997
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:42,953
Sir, like I said...
you're absolutely right.

998
01:18:43,528 --> 01:18:45,223
But I can't do this.

999
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:48,257
I am not with you
on just this matter.

1000
01:18:48,867 --> 01:18:50,027
But I am also not against you.

1001
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:54,064
Shiv, we're two
wheels of the same car.

1002
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:58,001
If we tread together,
we can avert accidents.

1003
01:18:58,076 --> 01:18:59,270
No, sir. We won't.

1004
01:19:00,245 --> 01:19:02,543
And that's because, the
respect I have for you...

1005
01:19:02,814 --> 01:19:04,076
...is higher than my thinking.

1006
01:19:07,986 --> 01:19:09,112
Fine, Shiv.

1007
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:11,886
You're saying this
with such conviction...

1008
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:17,090
Even I feel there won't
be any problem between us.

1009
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:38,196
Guari's shooters have
attacked us thrice...

1010
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:44,879
...in the last one week.

1011
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,640
And what are we doing?

1012
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,612
Drinking alcohol.

1013
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,013
Just once...

1014
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:56,319
Just once if Sawatya says yes...

1015
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:57,915
...then these shooters...

1016
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:05,264
You'll always be waiting
for Sawatya's yes or no.

1017
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,894
So? What can I do?

1018
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:12,068
Sawatya's not allowing me to
teach that Bhairon a lesson.

1019
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:15,076
And here, you're
making a mess of my mood.

1020
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:19,945
I know... if I ask
Sawatya he'll surely say no.

1021
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:24,218
He'll say no if you ask.

1022
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,417
And look, baby.

1023
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:33,394
How long are going
to work for Sawatya?

1024
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:38,065
What do you get from the
amount of risk that you take?

1025
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,291
Nothing.

1026
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,529
You should get a
share in the profit.

1027
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:43,127
Sawatya will surely give you.

1028
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,200
Because he knows...

1029
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,499
...that he cannot run
the gang without you.

1030
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,576
Ask him.

1031
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:54,946
How much should I ask for?

1032
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:03,618
50.

1033
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,993
He'll surely give you 35.

1034
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:08,555
Of course.

1035
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,474
I brought him from the streets.

1036
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,268
I thought him the job. Fed him.

1037
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,274
And today he's
asking me for a share.

1038
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:28,507
Says he's the most
important man in the gang.

1039
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,211
Says, we cannot do without him.

1040
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:33,483
That vixen has instigated him.

1041
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,421
I told him she'll
get us killed one day.

1042
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:40,621
If you want, I can
kill DK and Nasir.

1043
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,560
No. DK is very popular in the gang.

1044
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:47,131
If we kill him,
there can be a problem.

1045
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,102
But if we give a tip to Mahadev...

1046
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:51,196
...then we can shed
few tears as well.

1047
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,532
Right?

1048
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:54,075
You're so cunning.

1049
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:56,636
Mind.

1050
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,948
How did you come here?

1051
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:07,246
We got a tip.

1052
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:11,086
I never imagined
that I'll die so easily.

1053
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:13,953
No.

1054
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,124
No.

1055
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:17,324
She's no gangster.

1056
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,060
I brought her in
the gang forcefully.

1057
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,499
She never did anything.

1058
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,935
You... you can kill me if you want.

1059
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:24,165
But spare her.

1060
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,263
She's no gangster.

1061
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,898
Why are you lying?

1062
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,541
We'll die together if we have to.

1063
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:29,907
Quiet.

1064
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:31,172
You're a woman.

1065
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,111
Sir won't harm a woman.

1066
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:34,911
Again the same thing.

1067
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,917
I more of a man than you are.

1068
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,282
We'll die together if we have to.

1069
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:40,279
Quiet.

1070
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,853
Absolutely quiet.

1071
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,016
I am talking to him.

1072
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,117
There's much you have to do.

1073
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:46,455
Why don't you understand?

1074
01:22:46,862 --> 01:22:48,489
What will I do without you?

1075
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:50,225
Are you crazy...

1076
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:53,928
Stop your love story,
and listen to my story.

1077
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:01,308
I want to start a new
gang with you two...

1078
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:03,536
...which will work against Sawatya.

1079
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:07,072
And anyway, Sawatya gave
me the tip about you two.

1080
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:14,212
Now stop this old story,
and think about the new one.

1081
01:23:18,127 --> 01:23:20,960
But what about this new gang.

1082
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:26,057
And what's your interest in it?

1083
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:29,070
Don't rack your mind
thinking about it.

1084
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:31,334
Think about your own interest.

1085
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,945
But why us?

1086
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,188
Because you two don't
have a better option.

1087
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:57,362
And I you two are
the best option I have.

1088
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:14,274
Gauri.

1089
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,612
There are two
advantages in making DK gang.

1090
01:24:17,953 --> 01:24:21,411
First, your name won't be
dragged in small matters.

1091
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:25,357
And secondly, Sawatya will be
pressurized from both sides.

1092
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,319
Who is it?
- Gauri.

1093
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,454
Give it to me.

1094
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:29,622
Hello.

1095
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,092
Yes, brother Gauri.

1096
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,190
Yes, I am fine.

1097
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,326
How are you?

1098
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,025
Yes, Rinku's fine as well.

1099
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,130
Of course.

1100
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:38,564
I will.

1101
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:44,572
Gauri, we'll kill DK as
soon as our job's done.

1102
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,843
Okay?

1103
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,113
You're so selfish.

1104
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,915
Satya, the world's selfish.

1105
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,348
We should get our
interest fulfilled...

1106
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,517
...before your opponent does.

1107
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,242
Baby.
- Yes.

1108
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,444
Just like Mahadev sir, said...

1109
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,072
...we should make a
brand of our gang...

1110
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:24,147
...to rule Mumbai.

1111
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:30,050
And to make a brand name,
we'll have to release a big film.

1112
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:33,419
Whose?

1113
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,028
No picture's
complete without a financer.

1114
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:43,962
Sawatya's main financer is Patel.

1115
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,300
Why don't we target him?

1116
01:26:10,032 --> 01:26:11,090
You know something, baby.

1117
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:17,035
Our team... is superhit.

1118
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,635
I am king of the Mumbai.

1119
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,501
And you're my queen.

1120
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:14,282
You can never prove
Bhosle's link with Gauri.

1121
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:21,956
Accusing a well known
officer of the department...

1122
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:30,132
...without evidence, meaning
crucifying the government.

1123
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:33,873
It won't be right.

1124
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,447
To make me the Home minister...

1125
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:49,255
The biggest scoundrel
created by the Lord...

1126
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:51,824
DK.

1127
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,087
So it's my
personal responsibility...

1128
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:00,433
...to reward him.

1129
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:09,502
Send DK on a lifelong
holiday package. On my behalf.

1130
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:16,007
Lifelong package.

1131
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,446
This morning, Shiv
Narayan shot DK's shooter...

1132
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:25,550
...Karan Rastogi, and
he died on the spot.

1133
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:30,494
This morning, Shiv Narayan
shot DK gang's Durga Prasad.

1134
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:37,435
Shiv Narayan shot famous
hotelier Francis Pereira...

1135
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:39,872
...who had links with DK gang.

1136
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:43,035
In incidents that
occurred in different places...

1137
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:46,274
...Shiv Narayan shot
Ramesh Tunda, Salim Kalia...

1138
01:29:46,348 --> 01:29:50,045
...Kishore Kurla and Malwani.

1139
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:52,245
And according to sources...

1140
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,188
...Shiv Narayan can
reach to DK himself.

1141
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,473
You don't understand.

1142
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,414
If we don't kill Shiv Narayan...

1143
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:39,282
...then all our gang
members will flee for good.

1144
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:41,554
We mean by whoever is left.

1145
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:43,887
He has already
eradicated half of our gang.

1146
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:47,492
I didn't start a gang
to hide like cowards.

1147
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:53,226
Either you let me kill him,
or you kill me.

1148
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:54,360
Here.

1149
01:32:54,436 --> 01:32:56,461
Kill me. Kill me.
- Calm down.

1150
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:58,497
Calm.

1151
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,940
We were tired of hearing
the same thing from Sawatya.

1152
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:03,269
And now you.

1153
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,538
If we wanted to be calm,
we could've...

1154
01:33:04,646 --> 01:33:06,113
...continued working for him.

1155
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:12,211
Look, if we don't kill
that rascal Shiv Narayan...

1156
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,986
...then our gang will be over.

1157
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:17,524
I never stopped you
from killing Shiv Narayan.

1158
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:26,390
But before killing him
we'll have to snatch his fame.

1159
01:33:26,468 --> 01:33:28,527
Why are you talking in riddles?

1160
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:32,596
If we kill him, it'll be
the end of his fame as well.

1161
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:35,035
You can kill fame only
with defame, and not bullets.

1162
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:40,113
We've to kill Shiv
Narayan at the right time...

1163
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:41,341
...then no one will question us.

1164
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,288
Neither the department,
nor the media.

1165
01:33:48,389 --> 01:33:49,515
Nor Sarjay Rao.

1166
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:50,921
Baby.

1167
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:55,420
Mahadev sir is right.

1168
01:34:04,072 --> 01:34:06,370
Mahadev, you haven't arrived yet.

1169
01:34:07,175 --> 01:34:09,405
We had invited Shiv
and Bharti for dinner.

1170
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,544
Did you forget?
- No.

1171
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,472
I remember.

1172
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:15,341
I am coming.

1173
01:34:16,618 --> 01:34:18,051
Its okay, Shiv.

1174
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,878
So what if DK survived.

1175
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:23,913
We'll see how long he can survive.
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:26,051
The food's getting cold.

1177
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:28,522
Shall we, sir?

1178
01:34:31,266 --> 01:34:33,234
I've heard that
Sawatya's out for your blood.

1179
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,196
Take it seriously, Shiv.

1180
01:34:36,938 --> 01:34:38,030
And be careful.

1181
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,371
What is the meaning of
careful in our profession, sir?

1182
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,407
As long as we're alive, we're alive.

1183
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:44,338
Or we don't.

1184
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:50,311
Shiv. You mean more
than a brother to me.

1185
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,518
Even I've a responsibility
of finishing your enemies.

1186
01:34:54,923 --> 01:34:56,584
Together we'll kill Sawatya.

1187
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,450
Sir.

1188
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:02,028
Are you coming or
shall I throw the food out?

1189
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,589
Shiv.

1190
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:08,225
We should take advantage
of DK and Sawatya's enmity.

1191
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:11,028
If you two don't stop
talking about your work...

1192
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:13,104
...then I'll start
talking about my operations.

1193
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,573
And I'll start
talking about my recipes.

1194
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:15,968
Right?

1195
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:17,973
Don't be so cruel with us, please.

1196
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:56,143
"You're done for good.
You've had it."

1197
01:35:56,451 --> 01:36:02,390
"Never utter the
name of a girl again."

1198
01:36:03,358 --> 01:36:07,886
"You're done for good.
You've had it."

1199
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:11,329
"Never utter the
name of a girl again."

1200
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:15,130
"If you look here and there,
try to flirt with anyone."

1201
01:36:15,203 --> 01:36:17,034
"Then you'll face a thrashing."

1202
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:20,233
"Your love has..."

1203
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:24,343
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1204
01:36:24,412 --> 01:36:28,212
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1205
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:31,878
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1206
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:35,582
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1207
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:38,420
"Kammo, Kammo, Kammo."

1208
01:36:40,028 --> 01:36:42,155
"Kammo, Kammo, Kammo."

1209
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,318
"Kammo, Kammo, Kammo."

1210
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:11,219
"You came to my doors,
wearing a silk dress."

1211
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,493
"With the procession."

1212
01:37:13,928 --> 01:37:17,455
"It invited more
trouble than pleasure."

1213
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:21,025
"It invited more
trouble than pleasure."

1214
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:26,371
"If I pass down your alley,
she heaves a big sigh."

1215
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:30,168
"Many still wish to give you a hug."

1216
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:32,236
"Yes, they still do."

1217
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:35,473
"They're scared to
announce it openly."

1218
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,848
"Yes, they're scared."

1219
01:37:37,919 --> 01:37:43,152
"Today many still
wish to give you a hug."

1220
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:47,093
"If you look here and there,
try to flirt with anyone."

1221
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,924
"Then you'll face a thrashing."

1222
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:52,160
"Your love has..."

1223
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:56,368
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1224
01:37:56,437 --> 01:38:00,066
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1225
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:03,940
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1226
01:38:04,012 --> 01:38:08,039
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1227
01:38:30,972 --> 01:38:36,569
"Anyone who fell in love."

1228
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:42,414
"Died a tragic death."

1229
01:38:43,217 --> 01:38:49,213
"Take an advice from me, everyone."

1230
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:55,887
"I've lots of experience in love."

1231
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:58,896
"Kammo, Kammo, Kammo."

1232
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:02,593
"Kammo, Kammo, Kammo."

1233
01:39:04,205 --> 01:39:07,834
"Till date everyone still
speaks of my escapades."

1234
01:39:07,909 --> 01:39:09,877
"My escapades."

1235
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:13,209
"Girls lose their heart to me
with a smile on their face."

1236
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:15,374
"With a smile on their face."

1237
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,908
"Till date everyone still
speaks of my escapades."

1238
01:39:18,986 --> 01:39:21,079
"My escapades."

1239
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:24,556
"Girls lose their heart to me
with a smile on their face."

1240
01:39:24,859 --> 01:39:26,349
"With a smile on their face."

1241
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:30,420
"If you look here and there,
try to flirt with anyone."

1242
01:39:30,498 --> 01:39:32,159
"Then you'll face a thrashing."

1243
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,431
"Your love has..."

1244
01:39:35,503 --> 01:39:39,496
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1245
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:43,340
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1246
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:47,074
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1247
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:50,584
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1248
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:54,485
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1249
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:58,321
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1250
01:39:58,392 --> 01:40:02,055
"Kammo, your love caused
more trouble than pleasure."

1251
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:03,927
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1252
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:05,896
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1253
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,065
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1254
01:40:08,136 --> 01:40:09,569
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1255
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:11,537
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1256
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:13,437
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1257
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:15,373
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1258
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:17,138
"Kammo, you caused more
trouble than pleasure."

1259
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:22,141
"Kammo, Kammo, Kammo."

1260
01:40:23,284 --> 01:40:24,945
Oh...

1261
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:28,613
I danced a lot today.

1262
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,615
In this old age my back...

1263
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:33,922
Sir, I don't drink.

1264
01:40:35,296 --> 01:40:37,457
Don't call it alcohol.

1265
01:40:37,932 --> 01:40:40,127
Its liquor. Liquor.

1266
01:40:41,102 --> 01:40:43,536
Alcohol sounds bad.

1267
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:45,472
Drink it.

1268
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:53,971
That's all, sir.

1269
01:40:56,217 --> 01:40:58,947
There are many
advantages of drinking.

1270
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,112
What is that, sir?

1271
01:41:00,188 --> 01:41:03,157
Firstly, after
drinking you don't mind...

1272
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:06,091
...what one says, whether you or me.

1273
01:41:07,995 --> 01:41:09,087
What happened, sir?

1274
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:12,056
What happened, sir? Tell me.

1275
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,495
Sir?

1276
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,198
What is wrong, sir?

1277
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:20,934
I just remembered something.

1278
01:41:21,008 --> 01:41:22,236
An old joke.

1279
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:28,475
What joke, sir?

1280
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:34,613
It's private.

1281
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,255
Sir, if you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

1282
01:41:38,326 --> 01:41:39,623
Look here, look.

1283
01:41:40,962 --> 01:41:42,452
Nothing personal.

1284
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:45,260
I get a little sentimental.

1285
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:47,631
Why do you wear this bell?

1286
01:41:47,902 --> 01:41:49,369
Bell? Bell.

1287
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:58,243
At Dharavi signal, when I
had the enlightenment...

1288
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:02,409
...He also gave me this bell.

1289
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:05,883
And I took it as his blessing.

1290
01:42:09,357 --> 01:42:11,325
And tied it to my wrist.

1291
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:17,062
Whenever this bell rings...

1292
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:23,026
...it reminds me that, for
the sake of the country...

1293
01:42:23,104 --> 01:42:24,594
...I need to...
- Eradicate every criminal.

1294
01:42:24,672 --> 01:42:29,132
And... and as long as
this rings I will...

1295
01:42:31,512 --> 01:42:33,844
Keep killing them.
- Exact.

1296
01:42:35,116 --> 01:42:36,174
Correct.

1297
01:42:38,019 --> 01:42:40,317
What happened?
- Nothing. It's private.

1298
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,115
Private? I am your wife.

1299
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:44,350
What's private between us.

1300
01:42:44,425 --> 01:42:45,551
Not me, someone else.
- Shiv.

1301
01:42:47,028 --> 01:42:48,427
Danaji, you looked worried.

1302
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:50,088
What's wrong?
- It's private.

1303
01:42:50,131 --> 01:42:51,462
Oh no. Again private.

1304
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:53,058
What's private between us?

1305
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,226
What happened?

1306
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:55,627
There's a builder, Thakur.

1307
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,637
There's a property dispute...

1308
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,099
...between Thakur
builder and Mirchandani.

1309
01:43:00,074 --> 01:43:01,632
Thakur has threatened Mirchandani...

1310
01:43:02,076 --> 01:43:03,134
...using Sawatya's name.

1311
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,973
That he'll use him to kill him.

1312
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:08,909
Mirchandani wants to make a
welfare home on that plot.

1313
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:11,615
But now he's scared.

1314
01:43:11,886 --> 01:43:13,581
Because he's scared of Sawatya.

1315
01:43:16,223 --> 01:43:18,054
You can get in touch
with the architect...

1316
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,353
...and call me as soon as possible.

1317
01:43:19,427 --> 01:43:20,587
Say, by today evening.

1318
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:22,128
Right, sir. It will be done.

1319
01:43:22,196 --> 01:43:24,164
I'll give you all the
information by evening. - Cool.

1320
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:25,623
Thakur.

1321
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:29,227
And, who are you?

1322
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:31,902
I am Shiv Narayan. Police.

1323
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,399
I need to talk to you.

1324
01:43:37,912 --> 01:43:39,004
Come on, come on.

1325
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,172
Sit inside.

1326
01:43:44,085 --> 01:43:45,279
What do you want?

1327
01:43:45,586 --> 01:43:47,178
Which police station are you from?

1328
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:49,514
Where are you taking me?

1329
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:01,359
Why did you bring me here?

1330
01:44:04,338 --> 01:44:05,430
Tell me.

1331
01:44:06,507 --> 01:44:07,599
Listen to me carefully.

1332
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:12,879
If Sawatya kills Mirchandani,
then I will kill you.

1333
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,375
Tell that to Sawatya.

1334
01:44:20,154 --> 01:44:21,246
Come on.

1335
01:44:22,523 --> 01:44:23,615
Walk back from here.

1336
01:44:24,058 --> 01:44:25,116
You'll get some exercise.

1337
01:44:31,966 --> 01:44:33,263
Bye, Thakur.

1338
01:44:54,989 --> 01:44:57,480
Famous builder Thakur has
been missing since morning.

1339
01:44:57,558 --> 01:44:58,855
Thakur's people are saying that...

1340
01:45:01,562 --> 01:45:03,120
...two police officers
abducted Thakur today morning.

1341
01:45:03,564 --> 01:45:05,191
But the most sensational
and amazing fact is...

1342
01:45:05,266 --> 01:45:10,363
...that one of them was
encounter king Shiv Narayan.

1343
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:13,971
Sir, what am I hearing about Thakur.

1344
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:16,874
He's been found.

1345
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:21,373
Dead.

1346
01:45:21,449 --> 01:45:22,541
But who killed him?

1347
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:26,142
They say it's you.
- What?

1348
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:33,459
Tell me, why will Shiv
Narayan kill Thakur.

1349
01:45:33,961 --> 01:45:35,451
The investigation suggests...

1350
01:45:36,197 --> 01:45:38,392
...that Mirchandani gave a
contract to Shiv Narayan...

1351
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:39,857
...to kill Thakur.

1352
01:45:39,934 --> 01:45:41,401
No, that's just an accusation.

1353
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:42,868
No, sir it's not just an accusation.

1354
01:45:42,937 --> 01:45:44,029
We've a witness.

1355
01:45:44,572 --> 01:45:45,869
Who?

1356
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:48,033
Danaji.

1357
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:49,405
He's close to Shiv Narayan.

1358
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,878
He was with him
when he killed Thakur.

1359
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,009
He saw everything
with his own eyes, sir.

1360
01:45:57,451 --> 01:45:59,976
Shiv Narayan killed
Thakur right before my eyes.

1361
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:02,983
I tried to stop me.

1362
01:46:03,924 --> 01:46:05,186
But he didn't listen to me.

1363
01:46:07,061 --> 01:46:08,426
Now, even my life's in danger.

1364
01:46:08,496 --> 01:46:10,430
You know better than me, sir.

1365
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:14,467
No one in this world is honest.

1366
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:16,892
Not even your Shiv Narayan.

1367
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:22,309
He has betrayed you, and
the department as well.

1368
01:46:23,611 --> 01:46:26,102
The other day when you were
talking about the sweet tooth.

1369
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:29,276
That was Shiv Narayan, not me.

1370
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:33,479
I knew that Shiv had a
connection with some gang.

1371
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:37,079
But the other day when
you were accusing me...

1372
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:42,154
...I didn't say this because
you wouldn't have listened to me.

1373
01:47:01,382 --> 01:47:02,542
Bhonsle.

1374
01:47:05,352 --> 01:47:06,580
Just like you said.

1375
01:47:09,223 --> 01:47:11,418
No one's honest.

1376
01:47:14,228 --> 01:47:17,959
Whether you know that more
or me, only time will tell.

1377
01:47:20,968 --> 01:47:25,905
And the time you took
for saying this dialogue...

1378
01:47:25,973 --> 01:47:34,108
...act faster in
arresting Shiv Narayan.

1379
01:47:41,055 --> 01:47:42,989
Bharti, forget about arresting him.

1380
01:47:43,223 --> 01:47:46,386
No one can even touch Shiv
as long as Mahadev is there.

1381
01:47:56,537 --> 01:47:58,300
Brother Mahadev,
what's wrong with Danaji?

1382
01:47:58,372 --> 01:47:59,532
Why is he lying?

1383
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,403
I'm here to arrest Shiv.

1384
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,402
Shiv...

1385
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:05,604
What?

1386
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:08,040
Mahadev, what are you saying?
- Satya.

1387
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:10,610
I can't disobey orders.

1388
01:48:12,519 --> 01:48:14,316
Mahadev, it's obvious.

1389
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:16,580
It's a conspiracy.

1390
01:48:18,192 --> 01:48:19,250
I know.

1391
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:20,890
You know, but still.

1392
01:48:20,928 --> 01:48:22,919
You know what Shiv did
for the department...

1393
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,895
...so how can the
department do this with Shiv?

1394
01:48:25,866 --> 01:48:27,128
Believe me, Bharti.

1395
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:30,565
I am much more shocked than you are.

1396
01:48:32,873 --> 01:48:34,431
Shiv is more than a brother to me.

1397
01:48:35,409 --> 01:48:39,072
Don't forget, I am the one who
brought him in the department.

1398
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,141
And I terribly regret this.

1399
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:44,883
Talk to Sarjay Rao.

1400
01:48:44,952 --> 01:48:46,010
I will call him.

1401
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:47,314
These orders are from Sarjay Rao.

1402
01:48:48,322 --> 01:48:49,380
To arrest him.

1403
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:03,459
Sir. Whatever I did, I
did it for the department.

1404
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:07,230
Even I am doing it for
the department, Shiv.

1405
01:49:11,445 --> 01:49:12,537
Take care.

1406
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:14,844
Shiv. Shiv.

1407
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:16,007
Satya, please.
- Bharti.

1408
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:17,948
Shiv. Shiv.

1409
01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:19,144
Satya, please let me go.

1410
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:20,851
He's not done anything.

1411
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:22,147
Shiv.

1412
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:26,983
I'll try my best to
relieve Shiv from this problem.

1413
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:30,387
You know that he's innocent,
but yet...

1414
01:49:30,464 --> 01:49:33,194
Who said that
innocent don't get punished?

1415
01:49:37,371 --> 01:49:39,362
Shiv. Catch him.

1416
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,500
Shiv. Stop. Stop.

1417
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,187
Shiv. Stop.

1418
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:56,586
Vedekar, catch him.

1419
01:50:14,675 --> 01:50:16,040
What could I do, Shiv?

1420
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:17,335
What could I do?

1421
01:50:17,644 --> 01:50:19,976
Someone kidnapped my
son from school...

1422
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:22,379
...and threatened me that
if I don't accuse you...

1423
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:25,179
...then they'll slit his throat.

1424
01:50:25,486 --> 01:50:26,953
They'll kill him.

1425
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:28,981
Forgive me, Shiv.

1426
01:50:30,257 --> 01:50:34,125
I still don't know where my son is.

1427
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:39,965
What has the world come to?

1428
01:50:40,267 --> 01:50:44,966
The department doesn't
know where their officers are.

1429
01:50:45,606 --> 01:50:47,039
What will happen to our country?

1430
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:50,440
DK, if the department
really wants to catch someone...

1431
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:51,978
...then no one can escape.

1432
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:55,611
The department
doesn't want to catch Shiv.

1433
01:50:57,084 --> 01:51:01,953
That's why, we'll need you two
to lure him out in the open.

1434
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:06,589
One needs to play the lyre to
get the snake out of its burrow.

1435
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:11,260
But I only know to
press the trigger.

1436
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:17,036
Kill Shiv before he kills you two.

1437
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:21,973
Maybe you've been instigated.

1438
01:51:22,042 --> 01:51:23,407
Take my advice.

1439
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,340
Surrender yourself.

1440
01:51:27,548 --> 01:51:37,856
It'll be in the interest
government, department, me and you.

1441
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:39,250
No, sir.

1442
01:51:39,326 --> 01:51:40,623
Please believe me.

1443
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:42,287
I am innocent.

1444
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,893
And no one can prove
that except for me.

1445
01:51:44,965 --> 01:51:46,057
What do you think?

1446
01:51:46,133 --> 01:51:47,191
Who wants to instigate me?

1447
01:51:47,634 --> 01:51:49,534
Surely it's Sawatya.

1448
01:51:50,304 --> 01:51:51,896
It has to be him.

1449
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:57,308
Shiv Narayan.

1450
01:51:58,045 --> 01:51:59,103
Recognized me?

1451
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:01,909
It's Sawatya.

1452
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:08,019
You killed 22 of my men,
but did I ever say anything?

1453
01:52:08,655 --> 01:52:10,122
I didn't.

1454
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:14,926
Actually, I
completely respect a person...

1455
01:52:15,596 --> 01:52:18,030
...who does his duty honestly.

1456
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:19,592
I am very happy.

1457
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:20,963
Really.

1458
01:52:21,034 --> 01:52:22,126
But do you see.

1459
01:52:22,202 --> 01:52:23,567
Do you see this mess?

1460
01:52:24,137 --> 01:52:29,165
Your own department
is out for your blood.

1461
01:52:29,543 --> 01:52:30,635
What about that?

1462
01:52:31,178 --> 01:52:32,167
Nothing.

1463
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:34,612
That's exactly what happens.

1464
01:52:34,848 --> 01:52:36,213
Now listen to me.

1465
01:52:37,117 --> 01:52:39,881
Actually, there's a
vacancy for a shooter in my gang.

1466
01:52:40,387 --> 01:52:42,184
DK's left me.

1467
01:52:43,190 --> 01:52:45,124
So I need a man like you.

1468
01:52:46,026 --> 01:52:47,152
Really?

1469
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:51,086
Will you join hands with me?

1470
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:57,028
Yes.

1471
01:52:57,104 --> 01:53:02,906
Your style of "Yes", I
really like that, son.

1472
01:53:03,243 --> 01:53:04,369
Really.

1473
01:53:05,245 --> 01:53:06,542
Come and meet me.

1474
01:54:10,944 --> 01:54:15,404
I never imagined...
that we'll meet like this.

1475
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:20,409
I always thought we'll meet
only during the final rites.

1476
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:26,249
I am very happy... that
you thought of joining me.

1477
01:54:29,196 --> 01:54:31,664
I just want to kill DK.
- Why?

1478
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:35,291
Because he killed Thakur
and got me in this mess.

1479
01:54:36,503 --> 01:54:39,472
I've sure information
about DK but no weapon.

1480
01:54:42,843 --> 01:54:45,971
In our profession, you don't
kill a man with a weapon...

1481
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,078
...but with information.

1482
01:54:49,116 --> 01:54:51,209
Now you work for Sawatya.

1483
01:54:52,052 --> 01:54:53,417
You'll get everything you need.

1484
01:55:02,896 --> 01:55:04,261
Why do you trust me so much?

1485
01:55:04,498 --> 01:55:08,161
Not you, but your situation.

1486
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:11,199
I know... that you know.

1487
01:55:12,272 --> 01:55:14,934
I am your only option.

1488
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:16,573
Misconception is bad thing.

1489
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,542
Stop. I work for Sarjay Rao.

1490
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:07,277
Sarjay Rao.

1491
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:09,218
Sarjay Rao. Sarjay Rao.

1492
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:11,616
Talk to him.

1493
01:57:14,294 --> 01:57:17,092
Sir, talk to Shiv Narayan.

1494
01:57:17,164 --> 01:57:18,256
He wants to kill me.

1495
01:57:19,065 --> 01:57:20,191
And tell him.

1496
01:57:20,967 --> 01:57:22,059
Here.

1497
01:57:22,135 --> 01:57:23,193
Talk to him.

1498
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:27,498
Shiv Narayan.

1499
01:57:31,444 --> 01:57:32,911
Sawatya works for me.

1500
01:57:35,849 --> 01:57:36,907
I'll tell you everything.

1501
01:57:47,994 --> 01:57:49,086
Look, sir.

1502
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:51,355
If we can't find Shiv Narayan...

1503
01:57:51,831 --> 01:57:53,321
...then we'll have to do something...

1504
01:57:53,867 --> 01:57:55,095
...so that he comes to us.

1505
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:57,199
I have an idea.

1506
01:57:58,939 --> 01:58:00,065
What?

1507
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,505
Abduct Shiv Narayan's wife.

1508
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:05,241
Don't you dare think like that?

1509
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:08,879
We've an unwritten
contract between us.

1510
01:58:09,249 --> 01:58:12,878
We never involve
families in personal disputes.

1511
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,117
Mahadev sir, is right.

1512
01:58:16,156 --> 01:58:19,216
DK, we won't act on your plan.

1513
01:58:20,227 --> 01:58:25,324
We'll find Shiv Narayan,
but with honesty.

1514
01:58:26,233 --> 01:58:27,598
Think of a different way.

1515
01:58:31,972 --> 01:58:33,371
To hell with him.

1516
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:37,572
Now when I have a plan
he's talking about family.

1517
01:58:39,379 --> 01:58:41,210
If I hadn't involved the family...

1518
01:58:41,481 --> 01:58:43,278
...then this saga
would've never begun.

1519
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:47,342
Baby. You are absolutely right.

1520
01:58:48,154 --> 01:58:51,180
No one's honest or
corrupt in this world.

1521
01:58:51,424 --> 01:58:53,517
They're either
intelligent or stupid.

1522
01:58:54,594 --> 01:58:56,459
And he knows the difference.

1523
01:58:57,864 --> 01:59:01,391
Mahadev sir helped us
for his own interest.

1524
01:59:02,235 --> 01:59:05,170
And he can befriend
Shiv Narayan again...

1525
01:59:05,238 --> 01:59:06,603
...for any of his other interest.

1526
01:59:07,607 --> 01:59:10,508
And our gang will be in trouble.

1527
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:14,508
We'll abduct Bharti
without informing him.

1528
01:59:15,382 --> 01:59:16,440
You're right.

1529
01:59:18,518 --> 01:59:24,047
In this world, everyone's
trying to make fool of each other.

1530
01:59:25,191 --> 01:59:28,217
Just watch, as soon as
Shiv Narayan's dead...

1531
01:59:28,862 --> 01:59:33,060
...we'll be the only
option he'll have.

1532
01:59:34,034 --> 01:59:37,197
Wow, these days you're
using your brains as well.

1533
01:59:43,043 --> 01:59:44,135
Hello.

1534
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:46,144
Shiv sir has been shot.
- What?

1535
01:59:55,989 --> 01:59:57,149
Hello, sister-in-law.

1536
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:01,957
Mahadev sir has sent us.

1537
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:03,996
I am inspector Nasir,
and this is inspector DK.

1538
02:00:04,431 --> 02:00:06,262
I mean, Dhanush Kumari.

1539
02:00:06,433 --> 02:00:08,901
Bharti, Sawatya has
shot Shiv Narayan.

1540
02:00:08,968 --> 02:00:10,333
He's breathing his last.

1541
02:00:11,271 --> 02:00:12,431
Are you crazy?

1542
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:13,904
Have you lost your mind?

1543
02:00:13,973 --> 02:00:15,998
Is this how you
give such a bad news?

1544
02:00:16,076 --> 02:00:17,304
Who else will we say it to?

1545
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:18,435
She's a doctor.

1546
02:00:18,511 --> 02:00:19,603
But where is he?

1547
02:00:24,317 --> 02:00:26,080
Here. Right here.

1548
02:00:28,455 --> 02:00:29,547
Where is he?

1549
02:01:19,272 --> 02:01:21,035
Sawatya, doesn't just work for me...

1550
02:01:22,308 --> 02:01:23,673
...but also the government.

1551
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:27,976
What?

1552
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:35,114
Government has made a deal
with Sawatya. - I didn't get it.

1553
02:01:35,522 --> 02:01:36,853
Look.

1554
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:42,058
Even you know that these days...

1555
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:47,361
...the Gauri is not just a
underworld Don, but a terrorist.

1556
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:49,932
Sawatya's power...

1557
02:01:51,204 --> 02:01:56,506
Sawatya's power is
slowly decreasing in Mumbai.

1558
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:03,510
The government has
made a deal with Sawatya...

1559
02:02:04,951 --> 02:02:10,287
...to put a stop on the
increasing power of the underworld.

1560
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:15,925
So that the balance
of power remains even.

1561
02:02:16,563 --> 02:02:19,396
We want to support Sawatya...

1562
02:02:19,499 --> 02:02:23,936
...in finishing Gauri's power.

1563
02:02:25,905 --> 02:02:30,274
Consider that,
just like we started...

1564
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:32,107
...the department for
you in the police force.

1565
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:36,615
Similarly, we've
opened another department...

1566
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:38,442
...in the underworld.

1567
02:02:39,552 --> 02:02:41,986
Which is being run by Sawatya.

1568
02:02:43,389 --> 02:02:45,254
Your both have the same motive.

1569
02:02:47,427 --> 02:02:48,519
Not different.

1570
02:02:49,262 --> 02:02:51,958
So, when our department
was killing Sawatya's men...

1571
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:53,157
...why didn't you stop us?

1572
02:02:56,536 --> 02:02:57,867
Come here.

1573
02:03:00,073 --> 02:03:05,568
Our deal was with Sawatya,
not with his gang members.

1574
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,647
Sawatya's gang members
didn't know about this deal.

1575
02:03:11,317 --> 02:03:15,447
That's why, when you kill his gang
members, you do the right thing.

1576
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:25,223
Sir, I don't understand
what's right and what's wrong?

1577
02:03:25,298 --> 02:03:27,926
Right and wrong is
only the situation.

1578
02:03:28,368 --> 02:03:31,098
Sir, this will make me go crazy.

1579
02:03:31,471 --> 02:03:36,101
Abhimanyu couldn't
come out of the quagmire...

1580
02:03:36,175 --> 02:03:40,475
...because he didn't
hear the entire thing.

1581
02:03:42,015 --> 02:03:43,243
Forget it.

1582
02:03:44,918 --> 02:03:46,249
We'll talk when we've the time.

1583
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:55,227
Right now, you just have
to join hands with Sawatya...

1584
02:03:56,563 --> 02:03:58,292
...and finish Gauri.

1585
02:04:05,204 --> 02:04:10,506
And today, in place
of Mohammad Gauri...

1586
02:04:11,411 --> 02:04:14,608
...its your boss, Mahadev Rao Bhosle.

1587
02:04:19,485 --> 02:04:24,320
Your boss... is the
real boss of DK gang.

1588
02:04:27,994 --> 02:04:33,330
And they just kidnapped your wife.

1589
02:04:48,348 --> 02:04:49,406
Hello.

1590
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:50,574
Sir, this is Shiv Narayan.

1591
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:54,477
Sir, I made a mistake
thinking your way was wrong.

1592
02:04:54,554 --> 02:04:57,387
I was not in my senses
to reject your offer.

1593
02:04:57,457 --> 02:05:00,085
And now Bharti's life is in danger.

1594
02:05:00,927 --> 02:05:02,053
What's wrong with Bharti?

1595
02:05:02,495 --> 02:05:05,259
I've received news that
DK has kidnapped Bharti.

1596
02:05:05,965 --> 02:05:07,330
'Abduct Shiv Narayan's wife.'

1597
02:05:09,068 --> 02:05:11,059
How do you know
that DK kidnapped her?

1598
02:05:12,305 --> 02:05:14,364
Because I've caught Sawatya...

1599
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:18,937
...and right now he's in my custody.

1600
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:21,205
So, if its not Sawatya...

1601
02:05:22,415 --> 02:05:23,473
...then it must be DK.

1602
02:05:28,087 --> 02:05:30,112
I'll meet you near the
Chiploon road bridge...

1603
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:31,884
...and handover Sawatya to you.

1604
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:41,997
You can kill him and tell the
entire world that I caught him...

1605
02:05:42,402 --> 02:05:45,064
...then all the allegations
against me will be removed.

1606
02:05:45,872 --> 02:05:47,863
And then I'll return
to the department...

1607
02:05:48,608 --> 02:05:53,068
...and... work only for you.

1608
02:05:58,951 --> 02:06:00,043
Okay, Shiv.

1609
02:06:00,553 --> 02:06:03,078
After that we'll go and save Bharti.

1610
02:06:03,856 --> 02:06:04,948
Yes, sir.

1611
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:16,258
I don't want that...

1612
02:06:19,372 --> 02:06:22,864
The entire department is defamed...

1613
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:29,270
...for a single corrupt
officer like Mahadev.

1614
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:32,281
Officers will come and go.

1615
02:06:33,219 --> 02:06:35,084
But the department
will always exist.

1616
02:06:36,189 --> 02:06:38,123
It is our responsibility to...

1617
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:42,355
...maintain the honor and
pride of the department.

1618
02:06:44,063 --> 02:06:46,463
And if you've to do
something illegal for it...

1619
02:06:47,834 --> 02:06:48,926
...then that's right as well.

1620
02:07:35,281 --> 02:07:36,373
Sorry, sister-in-law.

1621
02:07:36,449 --> 02:07:39,043
Your brother-in-law
has made a mistake.

1622
02:07:40,153 --> 02:07:42,053
Forgive me. Please.

1623
02:07:49,495 --> 02:07:55,957
After today we won't give
you a chance to complain.

1624
02:07:56,402 --> 02:07:57,494
Really.

1625
02:08:00,973 --> 02:08:02,065
Can I say something?

1626
02:08:02,875 --> 02:08:04,001
When you smile...

1627
02:08:04,377 --> 02:08:06,538
...you'll look exactly
like the sister-in-law in...

1628
02:08:06,612 --> 02:08:07,909
...'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun'.

1629
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:23,586
Call up Shiv Narayan and
ask him to come here...

1630
02:08:23,863 --> 02:08:26,093
...otherwise I will
kill you right here.

1631
02:08:56,529 --> 02:08:57,860
Who is it?

1632
02:08:59,866 --> 02:09:00,958
Who killed them?

1633
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:03,865
That scoundrel.

1634
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:05,462
Must be Sawatya.

1635
02:09:05,872 --> 02:09:07,032
Sawatya.

1636
02:09:07,106 --> 02:09:09,199
Sawatya, face me if you can.

1637
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:13,174
Come and...
- DK.

1638
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:17,340
My gun is aimed at your head.

1639
02:09:18,284 --> 02:09:20,479
Throw down your guns.

1640
02:09:21,387 --> 02:09:22,945
Or else I will shoot you.

1641
02:09:24,056 --> 02:09:25,546
I will count to three.

1642
02:09:26,192 --> 02:09:27,250
Three.

1643
02:09:32,965 --> 02:09:37,993
You?
- I can kill you two if I want.

1644
02:09:39,238 --> 02:09:42,105
But after what you
two did with me...

1645
02:09:44,010 --> 02:09:45,238
...I will beat you two to death.

1646
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:27,545
Rascal.

1647
02:11:06,425 --> 02:11:07,517
Baby.

1648
02:12:05,217 --> 02:12:06,411
What happened to you?

1649
02:12:07,353 --> 02:12:08,513
No, no, you're fine.

1650
02:12:08,587 --> 02:12:09,986
Nothing's wrong with you?

1651
02:12:10,056 --> 02:12:11,114
Get up.

1652
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:13,158
Have you lost confidence in me?

1653
02:12:13,225 --> 02:12:14,317
Get up.

1654
02:12:43,255 --> 02:12:44,415
Shiv.

1655
02:12:44,557 --> 02:12:45,854
Shiv.

1656
02:12:45,925 --> 02:12:47,051
Shiv, are you fine?

1657
02:13:30,503 --> 02:13:31,595
What is this insolence?

1658
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:33,433
No, sir. I just came to my senses.

1659
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:05,116
I even told you, that we're
the wheels of the same car.

1660
02:16:05,491 --> 02:16:08,585
If we stay together, we'll
never meet with an accident.

1661
02:16:08,861 --> 02:16:09,919
Didn't I tell you that?

1662
02:16:10,029 --> 02:16:14,227
Even after I did all that,
you stayed loyal to Sarjay Rao.

1663
02:16:14,967 --> 02:16:17,629
You never thought how I would feel.

1664
02:16:18,003 --> 02:16:20,494
Sir, I am only loyal to the
department and no one else.

1665
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:23,103
And you're not even
loyal to yourself.

1666
02:16:50,869 --> 02:16:54,134
I ignored my conscience
and treated on your path...

1667
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:58,207
...but you got my wife abducted.

1668
02:16:58,544 --> 02:17:00,273
I never imagined that
you would stoop so low.

1669
02:17:00,446 --> 02:17:06,043
Forget it, Shiva. You'll
understand this some other day.

1670
02:17:16,195 --> 02:17:20,131
Shiv. Whether you
believe it or not...

1671
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:25,163
...but I always loved
you more than a brother.

1672
02:17:31,410 --> 02:17:32,434
There's one thing, Shiv.

1673
02:17:37,182 --> 02:17:40,913
Look after Satya and Rinku,
if you can.

1674
02:17:44,490 --> 02:17:48,119
They'll be
completely alone without me.

1675
02:17:52,197 --> 02:17:53,289
Completely alone, Shiv.

1676
02:18:21,026 --> 02:18:26,293
Shiv Narayan didn't
kill Thakur, DK did.

1677
02:18:29,268 --> 02:18:34,296
Danaji intentionally
testified against him...

1678
02:18:35,007 --> 02:18:37,032
...so that we can get
Shiv Narayan undercover...

1679
02:18:37,109 --> 02:18:38,167
...and then finish...

1680
02:18:40,045 --> 02:18:43,014
This plan was Mahadev Bhosle's.

1681
02:18:47,953 --> 02:18:51,252
Mahadev Bhosle killed DK.

1682
02:18:53,091 --> 02:19:02,056
Unfortunately, in this
operation he didn't survive.

1683
02:19:09,241 --> 02:19:13,041
The department will
always miss Mahadev sir.

1684
02:19:13,178 --> 02:19:14,406
Because I don't
have the capability...

1685
02:19:15,013 --> 02:19:16,241
...to do the job that he used to.

1686
02:19:17,049 --> 02:19:19,244
But I will try to
complete the job...

1687
02:19:19,885 --> 02:19:22,115
...that Mahadev sir
has left incomplete.

1688
02:19:22,187 --> 02:19:23,211
Sarjay Rao.

1689
02:19:23,288 --> 02:19:26,155
How was your personal
experience with Mahadev Rao.

1690
02:19:27,226 --> 02:19:31,185
First time when I met that man...

1691
02:19:33,999 --> 02:19:35,091
So?

1692
02:19:41,473 --> 02:19:43,634
I knew his ability at first sight.

1693
02:19:46,545 --> 02:19:50,242
Mahadev Bhosle is an example.

1694
02:20:00,259 --> 02:20:01,624
Shiv.
- Yes.

1695
02:20:02,394 --> 02:20:05,056
This is Gauri. Mohammad Gauri.

1696
02:20:05,898 --> 02:20:09,561
You look like Mahadev,
now that he's no more...

1697
02:20:10,269 --> 02:20:12,260
...you can take his place.

1698
02:20:13,338 --> 02:20:15,033
You'll get enough money.

1699
02:20:21,079 --> 02:20:22,307
We'll meet soon.
