1
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,334
Sir, the priest is here to meet you''

2
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,901
You were expected to solemnise
the wedding and arrive at 10

3
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,773
l came away even before l could
reach the venue...

4
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:59,575
''because l was called for an arranged
marriage, not a love-marriage''

5
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,414
''As you know, l worship love.
l solemnise only love-marriages''

6
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,596
Everything about you is colourful.
lt has no parallel

7
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:15,595
You're amazing. You're a college
principal from Monday to Saturday

8
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,599
And a priest on Sundays!
- One profession keeps the family going

9
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,276
The other helps me maintain tradition.
What made you call me?

10
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:31,274
''As you know, after my wife died,
l sent both my daughters...''

11
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:36,384
to a boarding school for education.
l have called the two of them back now

12
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,554
''And l want Ayesha, the elder one,
to get an admission in your college''

13
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,092
Wonderful! Send Ayesha
to my college tomorrow

14
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,457
Mr Varma!

15
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:51,268
Just don't worry about Ayesha.
l'm here anyway

16
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,403
''Welcome, Mr Chopra.
- How are you, Mr Varma?''

17
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,633
This is my son Raman.
This is Mr Varma

18
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,707
''Greetings, sir.
- Greetings''

19
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,311
Touch his feet

20
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:04,315
He has just completed a course
in business management abroad

21
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,912
''Panditji, this is Mr Chopra.
My business partner''

22
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:11,720
Please sit down

23
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:14,485
Where are the children, Mr Varma?''

24
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:22,834
Mini! Why're you alone? Go and tell
Ayesha that the principal is here

25
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,160
So sister's joining college?

26
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,567
''Sister, come on out quick...
there's good news for you!''

27
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,034
''That's Mini, the younger daughter?
- Right''

28
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,217
Ayesha

29
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,568
''Mini! My child!
- This is not fair, Papa''

30
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,571
''l want to join college, too, because
there are only girls in my school''

31
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:08,847
That's because you're still very young.
- When will my turn come?

32
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:11,412
lt will, dear... when you grow up''

33
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:14,583
''Papa, did you call me?
- Come, Ayesha''

34
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,913
Meet Raman, Mr Chopra's son''

35
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,650
''This is the principal.
- Hello, sir''

36
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,986
You will attend his college
from tomorrow

37
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:28,991
''Ayesha, my child...
just don't worry about anything''

38
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,100
''l'm telling you, you're going
to find it great fun''

39
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,673
The City College is
the best college in town

40
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,213
''Let me show you
around the college, dear''

41
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:48,214
This is the campus of our college...
the temple of learning

42
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,254
''Even after lectures, students keep
studying with each other. Look...''

43
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:55,561
aren't they putting their hearts
into their studies?

44
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:06,337
This is the Creative Arts section
of our college

45
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:10,131
You'll find the best of
creative artists here

46
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,578
This is simply superb

47
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:29,594
Shameless boy! What vulgar
portrait is that?

48
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,988
''You're mistaken, sir.
- Am l?''

49
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,556
''l still have to put the clothes
on her, sir''

50
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:42,101
''Still to put the clothes on...?
Do call me, when you've done it''

51
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:51,542
And this is the eatery
in our college

52
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,409
Eatery?
- The canteen

53
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:57,550
''Right now, all the students must
be busy attending lectures...''

54
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:02,985
lt must be absolutely vacant.
But l still want you to take a look...

55
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:24,110
Frauds!
- Pardon me?

56
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,747
840 students... that's the number.
Half are here...

57
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,615
''the other half must be in class.
- May l say something, uncle?''

58
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,723
Go on.
- You're very sweet

59
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:38,020
How come?
- You do feign ignorance

60
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:44,731
''One has to feign ignorance, my dear.
This is the age to have fun, after all''

61
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:50,533
''lf you don't have fun at your age,
will you do it at my age?''

62
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,051
Hurry up and tell me how was
your first day at college?

63
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:06,949
And how is the college?
- How will l describe it to you

64
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,622
''The college has a canteen,
a beautiful campus...''

65
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:14,696
''a garden, a sports complex...
- Are there no boys in your college?''

66
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,697
Of course there are. Why?
- So tell me about them

67
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,528
ldiot!

68
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:32,750
''You did a great thing that deciding
to join this college, Ayesha''

69
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:35,077
Your father will be very happy

70
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:38,919
''Should you need something
and l'm not around,...''

71
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:43,753
''you can contact the Aryans rightaway.
- May l ask something, Uncle?''

72
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,588
Go ahead.
- Who is Aryans?

73
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:51,632
Aryans? Vicky.
The Romeo of the college

74
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,941
Sada... the evergreen carefree hero

75
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,746
ljaz, whose hobby is poetry''

76
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:12,186
Chhotu, everybody's darling''

77
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:20,599
And Ajay... the fighter.
The backbone of the Aryans

78
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,402
''When the five of them are on their
own, they're like any other student''

79
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:33,178
''But when the five of them
get together, they spell power''

80
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:47,454
''Unity is Strength ... their motto,
and the motto of our college''

81
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:48,916
Come

82
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:57,267
''Here you are. The Aryans...
this is Ayesha, a new student''

83
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,164
The last lecture is over. So what
are you boys doing here?

84
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,601
''We're preparing for the
annual day function, sir''

85
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:07,606
Mrs Pinto asked us to take care
of the junior students

86
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,744
''Oh yes, you must take
care of them''

87
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:27,955
My child...

88
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:35,067
you too are a student of this college.
You must also take part in the function

89
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,679
Love...

90
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:30,885
makes the whole world

91
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,395
He's gone mad

92
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,078
Ajay, that's the new girl''

93
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,716
''She's a newcomer, isn't she?
- Hey old model!''

94
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,923
Watch it... or you'll land
in hospital instead of singing

95
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,932
What are you just showing us
your face for?

96
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,245
Will you sing something
or just keep trembling?

97
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,917
All that rubbish you've been talking!
C'mon!

98
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,322
Stand here

99
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:09,019
Sing... sing!

100
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:10,918
Sing!

101
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:18,070
''You love talking nonsense, don't you?
So say something... go on! Talk!''

102
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,729
Or laugh... laugh!

103
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,138
Or do you want to cry?

104
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:31,247
To sit down there and poke fun
at someone is very easy. Get that?

105
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:35,075
''lf you can't encourage someone,
at least don't ridicule him''

106
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:52,564
Get on with your rehearsal.
No one will bother you now

107
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,583
''He's the security around here, right?
Which is why l couldn't do a thing!''

108
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:15,587
''Forget it. Let's find them in
a tight spot, we won't spare them''

109
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:16,917
Come

110
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:30,875
''Gay, l can understand...
but why're happy, Bobby?''

111
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:35,870
Because Ajay taught those scoundrels
a lesson during the rehearsals

112
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:41,880
''Bobby, you're talking to boys again?
- l'm sorry, Tina''

113
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,256
Parrot!
- Strange girl

114
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:51,324
''Not strange girl, she's a nice girl.
- You mean l'm a bad guy?''

115
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,655
''You're not a bad guy, Vicky.
But she's a nice girl''

116
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:57,562
''Will you now...?
- You're the one who jilted her, Vicky''

117
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:01,566
''With Tina in your arms, your hands
around Meena and Heena hovering above''

118
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:05,570
''You've made a circus
out of your love, l say''

119
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,402
''Ajay, where are you going?
- To the gym''

120
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:12,509
Wait.
- What for? Why must l wait?

121
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,715
To listen to all that nonsense?

122
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,454
You guys keep talking about girls
all day. Aren't you ever bored?

123
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:23,023
This chap's forever singing about
them... and you guys listen to him

124
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,921
l'm going to the gym.
l'm getting late

125
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,869
How did your rehearsals go?
- lt was great

126
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,378
No, please don't mention that''

127
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,653
''They didn't bother you again, did they?
- No''

128
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:01,699
You're a newcomer. Should you ever
need something or have a problem...

129
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,059
you can tell Aryans

130
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,366
l'm sorry for the way l behaved
in everybody's presence...

131
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:15,306
but that's how the Warriors are.
They tease and harass girls...

132
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:19,675
Yes, it's bad to talk about girls''

133
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,619
''lt's wrong, even when we
talk about girls''

134
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:30,660
But when he talks to the girls...
- lt's all right. Absolutely

135
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:37,195
He's been saying the same thing
again and again... and nobody's bored

136
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,302
He says we're forever talking about
girls... and what does he say?

137
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,732
Thank you. All right!

138
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:46,774
Aren't you late for the gym now?
- l'm going

139
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:22,909
Queer!

140
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:32,914
Your problem is my problem.
l'll set everything right

141
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:46,098
l haven't asked your name.
- Sweetie!

142
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,936
''l knew love is blind.
That it is also deaf, l discover today''

143
00:18:56,949 --> 00:19:00,612
''Ajay, according to the chart,
Sweetie's act comes at No 3''

144
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,615
She's very nervous about that

145
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:07,619
''l told her that l'd have her entry
changed to the last. Simple, isn't it?''

146
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,624
''No. The lights have already
been rehearsed, Vicky''

147
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,660
The sound has been checked...

148
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,629
and all props have also arrived
according to the flow chart

149
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,962
Any change at this stage would
only create a confusion

150
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:26,536
Tweetie...
- Sweetie!

151
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:32,610
''Whatever it is... l'm sorry,
but it's not happening''

152
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,716
Let's go, there's a lot to do''

153
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:40,923
Ajay's made tooty-fruity of your
prestige before the sweetie

154
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,739
Are you prepared for your act
in tomorrow's programme?

155
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:58,805
That's what l want to talk
to you about

156
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,313
What is the matter?
- ln the flow-chart tomorrow...

157
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,949
''my entry comes second. Could you
move it to the last, please?''

158
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:17,527
The lights have had a rehearsal.
- Yes. The sound has been checked too

159
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:22,156
''According to the flow-chart,
everything is arranged''

160
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,960
Any change at this stage
will only create a confusion

161
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,435
That's my problem

162
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,438
Your job will be taken care of

163
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:42,913
God! She won't get any further!

164
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:10,943
Where's Vicky gone?
- Must've gone fielding for Tweetie

165
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:36,705
Why did you stop drinking?
- lt's time for prayers

166
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:46,578
Tell me something. You stopped drinking
hearing the call of the faithful

167
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,912
Do you think He looks at His children
only at prayer time?

168
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:57,154
His eyes are always on His children

169
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,729
''lf you have so much of faith in Him,
why don't you give up drinking?''

170
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,733
Let it be now.
- You let it be

171
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:24,411
''Raman, you and Mr Chopra must
keep yourselves free tomorrow''

172
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:27,123
Ayesha's participating in a function
for the first time tomorrow

173
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:40,436
Look at Ajay!
He's so delighted

174
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:10,732
''Ajay, is she frightened of the crowd?
- l don't know''

175

''A bit of my love

176
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:30,947

''you are the only one

183

l've got to understand you...

187
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,142

''What is it with me today?
My heart is not under my control''''''

''For a lifetime,

''l'll belong only to you.

200
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:53,135
How do l look in this jacket?
- Wonderful

201
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:02,948
How do l look?
- Who gave you that jacket?

202
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:08,949
Vicky.
- l...? The jacket was just lying

203
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:12,491
''You wanted to wear it, l said go on.
- l'll deal with you later''

204
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:18,129
You know what Aryans means?
- You and your friends...?

205
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:24,300
''Aryans were lndia's first warrior
tribes, who had the zeal...''

206
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:30,171
the courage and the power to fight the
enemy. Have you any of these qualities?

207
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:36,249
''Ajay, why are you brainwashing her?
- So, do you possess any qualities?''

208
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,921
''Yes, l do.
- l see''

209
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:45,055
How can l hit you?

210
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:54,637
You fancy wearing that jacket?
You can't stand straight on stage

211
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:02,073
Why not? Because you're a girl?
- Not that...

212
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:09,285
Are you scared? You're just a coward.
You got no right to wear that

213
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:13,647
l don't want to hit you. Please.
- Take that jacket off

214
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,970
What happened?
- What should never have happened

215
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:39,577
What should never have happened?
He told me to hit him

216
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:44,912
He wanted you to hit him in the guts.
You slapped him on the face. ln public

217
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:18,150
Why are you smiling?
- You lay one heavy hand

218
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:28,194
l just realised that you meant
me to pick up my guts

219
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:33,901
And in front of everyone...
- You slapped me

220
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:40,707
At least you understand

221
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:49,783
''Come on, we're getting late
for the picnic''

222
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,917
Get a hold on the slapping arm

223
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:10,038
''Listen, why not ask Ayesha
to come along?''

224
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,284
Come on, let's go picnicking''

225
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:31,087
Shall we...?

226
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,724
Nice opportunity?
To get even for the other day

227
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:05,618
Come on

228
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:26,345
''You know Ajay, we're in the mood.
- Let's bring them to their senses''

229
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:29,251
Sit down and come to your senses

230
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:35,219
''Hey Aryans, have you guys
taken to cross-dressing?''

231
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,697
Why don't you go and play a game?
- You'll know in a while

232
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,921
What are you? Friend or foe?
- Was bound to happen

233
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:21,603
''They're the rugby ''''Warriors''''.
- But the Aryans are friends''

234
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:29,469
l can't bear to see them down.
Either you will go or l will

235
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,677
You...?
- Yes

236
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,039
Go

237
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:49,458
Where's Ajay?
- l'm joining the play

238
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:07,907
Stop crying and state your problem.
- Five of us were playing five of you

239
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,138
Now you're six. We ought to be six.
- Okay

240
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,594
Who's that?
- Whoever...

241
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,923
''but we're Aryans, no less.
We'll fix them all''

242
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,303
My name's Binny

243
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:39,765
Help

244
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,007
Ajay... Vicky...
don't desert a friend

245
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:51,551
Binny is a hulk!
- Want to save face?

246
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,881
Yes.
- Then play

247
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,233
You start the game.
We're going to finish it

248
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:25,138
Friendship, love, life...''

249

''Enjoy life!
Every moment is golden''''''

252

This friend of ours...

253
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:00,704
is a restless man

254
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:05,180
His heart has betrayed him...

255
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,613
and he's a changed man

256
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:13,179
''He belongs to someone.
Forget him''''''

257
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:19,289
Tonight, l've lost my heart''

258

My eyes speak for my lips

259
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:27,963
How did this happen?

260
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:32,227
Why is everything so changed?

How can l silence myself?

264

How do l speak myself?

265
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:43,702
''l haven't a hold on myself anymore,
and l don't know why''''''

266
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:47,709
Just let it happen...

lose your heart to love

268
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:56,918
Say... say something...

Time for the lecture.
What's Chhotu upto in the toilet?

286
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:19,181
Looks like Chhotu is in
for the long haul

287
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:36,870
Who are these guys?

288
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:42,969
Never saw them in college before

289
00:46:54,692 --> 00:46:57,354
Chhotu is wounded!
Please come over

290
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:02,195
Get water

291
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,400
Come on out

292
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:25,916
Thrashing

293
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:53,049
''Warriors, you ought to help the Aryans.
- Get lost. Why should we help them?''

294
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:58,886
Who's taking care of college security?
- Today they're through

295
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:01,887
Even Ajay isn't around

296
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:12,564
Make sure he doesn't recognise himself
in the mirror. Wants to play hero

297
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:14,700
Hit him

298
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:09,753
Ajay, they bashed up Chhotu badly''

299
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:13,759
Want to play hero?

300
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:14,616
Hit him

301
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:21,590
No Ajay. He and his gang
ambushed me

302
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:26,623
''Now he's alone, weak, defenseless.
lf l hit him now...''

303
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:32,129
how am l different?
Leave him Ajay

304
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:36,437
Heard that?

305
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:54,452
''Friend, what you said just now
makes great sense''

306
00:51:55,759 --> 00:51:58,057
That makes me proud of Aryans

307
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,491
Take him to a hospital

308
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:20,446
l'd like to speak to you

309
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:37,192
Who do you think you are?
You're always getting into fights

310
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,901
Aren't you afraid?

311
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:41,960
No

312
00:52:43,907 --> 00:52:45,898
You want to know why?

313
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:56,909
My parents died in an air-crash
when l was a 14-year old

314
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:00,023
Ever since, l've been so lonely''

315
00:53:02,926 --> 00:53:09,024
''But life went on, and eventually
l came to this college''

316
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:17,004
''Here l found friends. l could be
with them, enjoy their company''

317
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:27,607
''On this journey through life,
you'll also need a fellow traveller''

318
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:35,552
l'd like to be part of your life

319
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:40,887
Ajay, l'm in love with you''

320
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,230
''Falling in love, professing love
is so easy''

321
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:55,578
But living with it is tough.
- l don't understand

322
00:53:57,614 --> 00:54:02,677
''Ayesha, my world and yours
are so different''

323
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:09,920
l've nothing to lose

324
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:16,429
But in the world you come from
you stand to lose a lot

325
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:38,949
''You're right. Maybe l stand to lose
a lot, but you mean everything to me''

326
00:54:39,957 --> 00:54:44,053
And l don't want to lose you

327
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:52,665
l got nothing... nothing but you

328
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:28,098
l got nothing, nothing at all...''

329
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:33,008
but you

330
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:40,043
''ln your arms,
let me find a reason to live''''''

331
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:49,882
''Only you... you are
the only one l have...''''''

332
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:54,887
and no one but you

333
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,769
''ln your arms,
let me find a reason to live''''''

334
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:11,074
l got nothing, nothing at all''

335
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:16,716
No one but you

336
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:44,871
Only one prayer on my lips...

337
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:52,883
''to be in love with you
all my life''''''

338
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:06,893
Ever since l found you...

339
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:14,571
my dreams came true

340
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:20,906
l got no wishes unfulfilled

341
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:26,651
l have no one but you

342
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:32,861
''ln your arms,
let me find a reason to live''''''

343
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:19,900
Will you love me all your life?

344
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:27,916
l'll love you even in death

345
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:40,921
You have such faith in love?

346
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:48,929
Even more faith than l have in God

347
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:55,938
You are the one l pray for

348
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,349
l have no one but you

349
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:06,679
l got nothing, nothing at all...''

350
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:11,951
but you

351
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:17,457
''ln your arms,
let me find a reason to live''''''

352
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:39,712
Nice watch

353
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:42,320
Ayesha gave me the watch
with a lot of love

354
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:45,719
l couldn't refuse it. l'll have
to buy something for her now

355
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:50,931
l get it. You're broke.
- Right

356
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:02,935
What's up?

357
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,616
''You know Daler Mehndi, the singer?
l had booked him for a programme''

358
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:11,682
But he cancelled it at the last moment.
- So?

359
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:16,618
So l want the Aryans to sing
and dance at my sister's wedding...

360
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,624
and have a lot of fun.
- You think we're dancing girls...

361
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:27,631
to perform at your sister's wedding?
- l'll pay you handsomely for it

362
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:31,702
''Pay us? We have our self-respect,
okay? Get lost''

363
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:35,434
Didn't you hear the guys? Get lost

364
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:39,976
You guys are real idiots.
- What do you mean?

365
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:43,714
You guys were just wondering
where the money would come from...

366
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:46,045
''and when the money comes to you,
you kick it''

367
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:49,590
You mean we must turn jesters
for the money?

368
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:55,296
l don't mean that. But you've got
to do it all when you're in love!

369
01:00:55,632 --> 01:00:57,759
You've got to do it!

370
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:13,939
What have we got ourselves into?

371
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:20,389
We were a great rock band...
and here we are! A pack ofjokers!

372
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:24,956
''Let's skip this talk, eat, collect
the dough and get the hell out of here''

373
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:28,059
''ln any case, no one here
knows or recognises us''

374
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:33,902
We've had it!

375
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:36,895
What can be worse than this?

376
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:39,069
Look there

377
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,911
She didn't see us, did she?''

378
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:56,914
No

379
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:03,092
''She's not coming here, is she?
- No''

380
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:07,262
What a narrow escape!
- No

381
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:17,412
What are you doing here?
- That which they do... for love

382
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,412
For love? Whose love?

383
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:38,898
What's all this?

384
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:42,895
Well, we...''

385
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:47,434
''Ayesha, what are you doing here?
Your daddy's calling you there''

386
01:02:47,777 --> 01:02:49,176
All right, let's go''

387
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,251
We've had it

388
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:06,389
''Enough! l can't do it anymore.
- Yes, we've been at it for 4 hours''

389
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:11,496
Why've you guys stopped?
Go on! Play the music

390
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:16,804
You sit here and play the pipe.
- Wait...

391
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:19,932
where are you going?

392
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:32,152
''Ayesha, when will l get to see
this lucky day like Mr Khanna?''

393
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:35,881
''Papa, you're too much.
- Mr Varma...''

394
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:40,220
Ayesha's a very shy girl.
You'll have to find her a suitor

395
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:14,929
''Like Ayesha here.
- What's up, Ayesha?''

396
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:18,929
My friends from college are here.
- Your friends from college?

397
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:25,938
''So what are you doing here?
Join them, have fun''

398
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:33,538
Mr Varma, you have a lovable daughter''

399
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:38,684
''Mr Chopra, Mr Khanna wants to see you.
- Go ahead. l'm coming''

400
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,798
Where are your friends?
- Three of them are eating there

401
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:57,031
And where's Sada?
- There... on the liquid diet

402
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:03,174
''And whom have you been
waiting for, all alone?''

403
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:06,605
lf you mind, l'll call them over''

404
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:14,921
''Ajay, that's not what l meant.
May l ask you something?''

405
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:18,825
What does it mean when you say you
have to do everything for love...?

406
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,923
''Actually, Ayesha, l wanted
to buy a gift for you too''

407
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:29,364
Here was the opportunity for me
to make some money. But now...

408
01:05:31,975 --> 01:05:35,069
''That you feel like this
means everything to me, Ajay''

409
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,612
Tell me something.
How come you're here?

410
01:05:40,984 --> 01:05:44,886
Mr Khanna is Papa's old friend.
l'm here with Papa

411
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:49,055
With Papa? Where is he?
- Over there

412
01:05:51,928 --> 01:05:55,887
''That pole?
- You're impossible, Ajay''

413
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:59,697
Where have you been?
l'm making a drink for myself!

414
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:03,904
Don't you like your job?
Make a drink for me! Quick!

415
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:07,137
You don't need to apologise

416
01:06:09,912 --> 01:06:15,714
No water... just ice.
Cool

417
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:19,183
l've been waiting here.
And you take off to serve others?

418
01:06:19,922 --> 01:06:22,584
What insolence is this? Who are you?

419
01:06:24,694 --> 01:06:25,683
Let go!

420
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:31,991
Stand still... don't you move

421
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:36,998
Have you met Diya?
- No

422
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:40,040
Go and meet her

423
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:51,053
What happened?
- Looks like he's in trouble again

424
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:55,556
Come here... talk to your waiter.
l'm asking for a drink and...

425
01:06:55,892 --> 01:07:00,488
One moment! You took me
for a waiter all this while?

426
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,321
Are you the manager then?
- Listen...

427
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,225
''this is Mr Varma, one of
the richest men in the city''

428
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:08,893
Ass

429
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:12,908
What arrangement do you have here?
For a function like this...

430
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:17,042
you ought to have someone responsible.
- What happened?

431
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:21,613
''He's a rich man, and l made the
mistake of calling him a waiter''

432
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:30,955
''He has made a mistake, sir.
Please forgive him''

433
01:07:33,863 --> 01:07:38,129
There's a limit to shamelessness.
ls this any way of apologising?

434
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,532
He's angry. Ask for forgiveness

435
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:50,578
lnsolent boys! There's a limit
to how much one can tolerate!

436
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:57,548
''Your mistake ought to be punished,
not pardoned''

437
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:03,086
Your insolence proves that you don't
come a decent family like ours

438
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:07,085
Or you may not have a family at all

439
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,695
Only a wayside orphan
could do something like this

440
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:15,899
Or maybe you're the offspring
of a third-rate upbringing

441
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:21,069
You will raise your hand at me?
You will hit me?

442
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:23,577
''You will hit me?
- No, sir''

443
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:25,904
My left, l raised only to stop you''

444
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:30,108
''But if l were to raise my right hand,
no one will be able to stop me''

445
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,911
That's enough. Out!

446
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:11,359
''Ayesha, do you know these boys?
- They're my friends from college''

447
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:19,465
Let's go home and talk about it.
Come on

448
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,340
Everyone's watching

449
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:12,944
Ajay, everyone's laughing''

450
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,152
Don't ridicule me in public

451
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:58,665
What do you want to talk about?
- Whatever happened yesterday...

452
01:10:58,935 --> 01:11:06,137
was no good. But it was Sada's fault.
- lf he made a mistake...

453
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:11,108
he did it innocently.
But your father's friend...

454
01:11:11,747 --> 01:11:15,114
the mistake that he made
ought to have been punished

455
01:11:16,218 --> 01:11:20,348
This temper is your weakness.
You'll get violent over anything

456
01:11:21,023 --> 01:11:28,122
''Anything...? He called me an orphan,
he called me an illegitimate child''

457
01:11:28,965 --> 01:11:31,490
And you call it anything?

458
01:11:33,903 --> 01:11:37,498
You tell me, was l wrong?''

459
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:41,700
First of all...

460
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:48,649
Sada made a mistake
and he made a mistake too

461
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:51,916
Papa doesn't know
anything about you

462
01:11:54,423 --> 01:12:02,421
l only wanted you and Papa to meet.
But after your temper...

463
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:07,733
''after your behaviour, l wonder
what impression Papa got of you''

464
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:17,279
''And thirdly, what l want to know from
you has nothing to do with yesterday''

465
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:27,947
l thought being in love means
making amends over a smile

466
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:42,897
''But today, in front of everyone
you have brought my love to ridicule''

467
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:47,471
You only thought about yourself?

468
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:54,308
''So you tell me,
what's right and what's wrong?''

469
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:56,901
Ajay isn't to be seen?

470
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:04,309
They had a fight, you forget?''

471
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:12,251
Ajay? The guy who's always getting
into fights and picking quarrels?

472
01:14:12,928 --> 01:14:15,920
And this poor lady
tried to teach him love

473
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:20,225
''Ajay shouldn't have been so stubborn,
at least on a day like this''

474
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:33,278
l never knew...

475
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:40,218
what love is

476
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:46,893
For the sake of your love...

477
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:53,895
l'm going to change

478
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,502
To you...

479
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:10,318
l give my heart

480
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:27,928
l've given you my heart

481
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:35,274
l did nothing else

482
01:15:58,634 --> 01:16:04,300
''Whatever else God has
in store for me...''''''

483
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:10,913
l only want your love

484
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:17,914
l've given you my heart

485
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:43,277
Yes, l made a mistake...''

486
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:46,871
what do l do now?

487
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:54,048
''For whatever you have done,
you will be punished''''''

488
01:16:54,590 --> 01:17:00,893
''l never thought, l never expected,
l never wanted it, but it happened''''''

489
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:08,293
''Think, try to understand,
what you did wasn't nice''''''

490
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:21,908
l only gave you my heart

491
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:28,318
What else have l done?

492
01:18:16,438 --> 01:18:19,305
''ln step with you,
the whole world sways''''''

493
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:22,900
''When you stop,
everything stops''''''

494
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:30,112
''When you look away from me,
my heart skips a beat''''''

495
01:18:30,753 --> 01:18:33,654
You know what you're like?

496
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:37,181
Just lovable

497
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:40,928
lt's hard on me to admit this...

498
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:44,322
but you're mine

499
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:54,675
To you...

500
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:58,275
l give my heart

501
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:04,351
And l did nothing else

502
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:12,558
''Whatever else God has
in store for me...''''''

503
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:18,967
l only want your love

504
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:14,944
Welcome in

505
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:22,287
''Welcome Mr Chopra, have a seat.
Been a long time Mr Chopra''

506
01:21:22,691 --> 01:21:29,062
What brings you here? Anything special?
- Family matter. You know Varma?

507
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:33,895
He is my business partner.
l want him to marry his daughter

508
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:38,171
There's a hassle. A boy.
- Who? Lives where?

509
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:44,507
Ayesha's classmate. Name's Ajay.
He's on the college security detail

510
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:48,371
l think he's a goon.
But not as big as you guys

511
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:52,317
''Some ''''Aryan'''' groupie.
- What did you say?''

512
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:59,659
Same guy who hit me!
Bashed me up badly

513
01:21:59,995 --> 01:22:02,190
Was he the one?
- Yes

514
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:06,264
''Mr Chopra, now your enemy
is my enemy''

515
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:11,936
Junior...

516
01:22:12,941 --> 01:22:14,203
Yes boss?

517
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:16,936
''lf he's in love, l'm not taking
a contract on him''

518
01:22:17,446 --> 01:22:21,644
He's no romantic. He's a goon.
He bashed up Munna

519
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,951
''Don't worry, l'll take care of it.
- Okay''

520
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:35,485
''What's this about lovers?
You take your money, you do your job''

521
01:22:35,897 --> 01:22:41,392
''Mr Chopra, don't worry.
l'll kill him''

522
01:22:42,904 --> 01:22:46,601
''Junior, some day,
you're going places''

523
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,171
Thanks

524
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:57,480
''When you get the guy,
l'll be the first to strike''

525
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:00,916
Sure.
- l land the first punch

526
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,281
Bastard! Bashed me up badly

527
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:09,920
''Ajay, are your friends cross
about your decision?''

528
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:14,528
Why should they be cross? l only
opted out of the security detail

529
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:19,665
l haven't stopped being friends.
l have a duty towards you too

530
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:25,941
Ajay! You're sitting here?
Some goons are picking up a fight

531
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:42,894
''Ajay, l forbid you to pick up fights,
l never asked you to stop being friends''

532
01:26:15,346 --> 01:26:19,612
''Today, you live.
Because it's time for my prayers''

533
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,986
But luck won't be on your side
time and again

534
01:26:59,557 --> 01:27:01,957
Tell him

535
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:06,955
l heard you guys went to the college!
l'm sure myjob has been done

536
01:27:07,365 --> 01:27:10,892
The sight of him must've blown him!
Did you bash him up good?

537
01:27:23,314 --> 01:27:30,880
''Look Chopra, now this concerns me.
l'll square with him''

538
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:33,920
l'm the one
who's going to kill him

539
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:36,654
Get that?

540
01:27:51,008 --> 01:27:56,469
''lf he kills him, l'm finished.
lf l'm connected to the murder...''

541
01:27:56,614 --> 01:27:58,946
Verma will never let
his daughter marry my son

542
01:27:59,283 --> 01:28:03,549
He listens to you. Stop him!
- Stopping him is impossible

543
01:28:04,489 --> 01:28:08,755
That guy drew blood.
Now he's finished

544
01:28:10,895 --> 01:28:17,300
Then what happens to me?
- Tomorrow Ramzan begins

545
01:28:17,802 --> 01:28:21,568
''For 30 days, he will only pray
and we don't work''

546
01:28:22,306 --> 01:28:27,972
''But after ldd is celebrated,
that guy is dead''

547
01:28:28,646 --> 01:28:35,848
''30 days? He'll keep seeing Ayesha
for a month? No, l'll talk to him''

548
01:28:36,254 --> 01:28:40,850
''What are you going to tell him?
- One minute, l'll sort it out''

549
01:28:41,259 --> 01:28:43,989
Talk some sense into him!
Or he's dead

550
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:21,550
''Sister, is that Ajay?
- Yes''

551
01:31:25,356 --> 01:31:27,290
You must introduce me

552
01:31:35,232 --> 01:31:38,565
She is...?
- My little sister. Mini

553
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:43,231
Ask him

554
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:47,237
Why don't you ask him?
- What's up...?

555
01:31:47,578 --> 01:31:49,409
You got no little brother?

556
01:31:52,616 --> 01:31:56,245
l got no one in this whole wide world.
- Why not?

557
01:31:58,923 --> 01:32:03,917
''You have Ayesha
- Silly, you're getting late for school''

558
01:32:09,266 --> 01:32:11,063
So lovable

559
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:21,875
Hurry up, don't pick my brains''

560
01:32:27,351 --> 01:32:29,683
What brings you here?

561
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:36,221
Sit

562
01:32:37,561 --> 01:32:43,898
Didn't you say we can make amends
over a smile?

563
01:32:49,306 --> 01:32:52,241
''What's the matter, boss?
- What's up?''

564
01:32:58,349 --> 01:33:00,977
Bastard! Let's kill him

565
01:33:03,521 --> 01:33:05,512
He's mine

566
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:11,117
Two weeks

567
01:34:12,323 --> 01:34:14,587
For two weeks, live it up''

568
01:34:37,281 --> 01:34:45,086
''Ayesha, he's gone. Nothing's going
to happen. Now let go of my hand''

569
01:34:49,293 --> 01:34:52,626
Nothing's going to happen to me.
Now go home

570
01:35:28,332 --> 01:35:32,769
''Ajay, wouldn't it have been nice
had you and Papa met now?''

571
01:35:33,337 --> 01:35:38,274
Tell me something. l'll meet your Papa
and apologise to him...

572
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:41,939
and also tell him that l love you
and that l want to marry you

573
01:35:42,346 --> 01:35:46,612
''But can't you tell him all that?
- Why not? Of course, l can''

574
01:35:47,084 --> 01:35:50,417
Really? How will you?
- l'll tell Papa that...

575
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:54,951
l know

576
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:58,891
The mention ofthe word daddy
has rendered you speechless

577
01:35:59,096 --> 01:36:01,087
What would happen
ifyou came across him?

578
01:36:43,607 --> 01:36:48,271
l wanted to come to you on my own.
- Listen Mr Whoever-you-are...

579
01:36:48,679 --> 01:36:55,084
l've once ignored your insolence.
Don't have any such hope this time

580
01:36:58,689 --> 01:37:01,681
''Anger only spoils a relationship, sir.
lt doesn't make any''

581
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:05,284
''A relationship?
- Mine and Ayesha's, sir''

582
01:37:05,963 --> 01:37:10,093
Watch it! You have crossed all limits
in the name of my daughter

583
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:14,469
You don't know me. l can make you
disappear from this city in one night

584
01:37:29,319 --> 01:37:32,311
Junior here.
- Trouble between Varma and Ajay

585
01:37:32,656 --> 01:37:33,884
One moment

586
01:37:49,339 --> 01:37:52,274
Go on.
- Varma has threatened to kill Ajay

587
01:37:52,676 --> 01:37:55,668
Here's our chance. Just close
this matter about Ajay

588
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,274
We'll do the dirty work
and Varma will be blamed for it

589
01:37:59,616 --> 01:38:05,612
Listen to this one last time.
Stop dreaming about my daughter

590
01:38:06,457 --> 01:38:10,291
lt isn't only my dream.
lt's what both of us dream

591
01:38:10,761 --> 01:38:13,286
l know boys like you very well

592
01:38:13,764 --> 01:38:17,757
You have trapped my innocent girl!
- Trapped her?

593
01:38:18,368 --> 01:38:20,700
''Absolutely!
- No, sir''

594
01:38:21,305 --> 01:38:23,296
But this is what l feared

595
01:38:23,707 --> 01:38:26,301
''And l told your daughter as much,
on the very first day''

596
01:38:28,645 --> 01:38:32,843
''Ayesha, tell your Papa
that you're in love with me too''

597
01:38:34,318 --> 01:38:39,517
''l hope you're in your senses, Ayesha.
- Daddy, l'm in love with Ajay too''

598
01:38:39,823 --> 01:38:43,691
Disrespectful girl!
- Mr Varma... what are you doing?

599
01:38:45,929 --> 01:38:50,593
Ayesha is innocent. This is the snake
who bears the venom

600
01:38:51,268 --> 01:38:53,532
Uncle, l'll fix him''

601
01:38:55,272 --> 01:38:59,265
Well? Speak...
why don't you speak?

602
01:38:59,476 --> 01:39:00,670
Speak

603
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,946
Get up. Are you okay?

604
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,914
''Security, get him!
He mustn't escape! Beat him up!''

605
01:39:11,455 --> 01:39:12,854
Let Ajay go!

606
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:16,953
''Ask them to spare him, Papa! Please!
- Don't encourage the animal, Mr Varma''

607
01:39:17,294 --> 01:39:20,627
''Let's go. C'mon, son.
- They're beating him up. Let me go!''

608
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,842
Clobber him!

609
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,612
Thrash him

610
01:42:17,274 --> 01:42:19,606
Love playing Romeo, don't you?''

611
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:23,903
Stop thinking about Varma's daughter!

612
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:38,751
''Chopra, l'm terribly hurt
over whatever happened today''

613
01:42:40,297 --> 01:42:44,233
''lfyou don't mind,
may l say how l feel Mr Varma?''

614
01:42:44,835 --> 01:42:50,239
''Go on, Chopra. You're notjust a
business partner, you're a friend too''

615
01:42:51,575 --> 01:42:56,239
''You call me a friend, Mr Varma.
Why don't we become relatives?''

616
01:43:02,252 --> 01:43:04,516
Give me some time to think

617
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:18,691
Stop here

618
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:35,547
Do you now see the power of Mr Varma?
Forget his daughter...

619
01:43:35,886 --> 01:43:39,617
''don't even look back at this city now.
Or else, notjust this city...''

620
01:43:39,956 --> 01:43:42,288
we'll send you packing
from this world! C'mon

621
01:43:42,793 --> 01:43:44,954
He gave me a thrashing...

622
01:43:49,366 --> 01:43:51,857
Enough, Munna. Come on''

623
01:43:54,371 --> 01:43:56,965
''l'll kill you, bastard!
l'll have your blood''

624
01:44:35,345 --> 01:44:37,006
There's Ajay!

625
01:44:42,285 --> 01:44:44,617
''We're here, Ajay!
- Get up''

626
01:44:45,622 --> 01:44:47,613
''Your friends are here.
- Open your eyes, Ajay''

627
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:53,623
''Open your eyes, Ajay.
- What happened to you?''

628
01:45:03,673 --> 01:45:06,301
Just tell us what you want to do

629
01:45:11,414 --> 01:45:14,315
l can make you disappear from
this city in a single night

630
01:45:26,396 --> 01:45:30,332
Just stop thinking
about Varma's daughter

631
01:46:00,297 --> 01:46:03,630
How dare you come here? Have you
forgotten yesterday's lesson?

632
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:12,631
''Mr Varma, he understands only kicks.
He won't listen like this''

633
01:46:12,876 --> 01:46:14,104
This chap, l'll...''

634
01:46:17,981 --> 01:46:24,045
''l had warned you. Should l raise
my right hand, no one will be...''

635
01:46:48,278 --> 01:46:52,874
''Ajay, who did this to you?
- Must've been someone of our own''

636
01:46:58,622 --> 01:47:01,090
''l don't know anything about it,
nor do l want to''

637
01:47:01,524 --> 01:47:04,516
Go inside!
Haven't you heard me?

638
01:47:08,465 --> 01:47:09,830
Go inside

639
01:47:12,636 --> 01:47:17,039
Go Ayesha. Listen to him

640
01:47:17,741 --> 01:47:21,302
Because he has just a day
to enforce his right

641
01:47:22,312 --> 01:47:26,043
''ln 24 hours, you're going
to be my wife''

642
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:34,318
''After that, he'll be able
to do nothing... nothing''

643
01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:39,251
''You don't know me, boy. Nor do have
any idea of my power''

644
01:47:39,663 --> 01:47:42,257
l'll finish you.
- Enough

645
01:47:42,699 --> 01:47:46,260
You did what you had to

646
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:50,671
And you may very well do
what you wish to do

647
01:47:51,341 --> 01:47:55,277
All l came to tell you is that torture
l went through in these 24 hours...

648
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,945
is what l'm going to subject you too.
lt's my challenge

649
01:48:00,383 --> 01:48:04,547
''Within 24 hours, l'm going
to marry your daughter''

650
01:48:04,821 --> 01:48:06,812
Do what you will

651
01:48:07,557 --> 01:48:09,286
Let's see

652
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,296
What's 24 hours? l won't let
that happen in 24 lifetimes!

653
01:48:14,798 --> 01:48:17,790
''Sir, should you succeed
in stopping me...''

654
01:48:18,101 --> 01:48:22,299
l'll think l wasn't destined
to have Ayesha's love

655
01:48:22,706 --> 01:48:27,302
And you can assert your right
as a father on Ayesha

656
01:48:27,711 --> 01:48:29,975
But let me also tell you...

657
01:48:30,313 --> 01:48:34,306
that l'm going to write
my own destiny in these 24 hours

658
01:48:45,261 --> 01:48:48,059
Chopra, l know what you're angling for''

659
01:48:48,665 --> 01:48:53,261
''But before 12 noon tomorrow,
l'm going to ruin all your dreams''

660
01:50:11,581 --> 01:50:16,518
''Ayesha, l'll come back.
That's the promise my love makes''

661
01:50:23,293 --> 01:50:26,626
For you, sir... it's a challenge''

662
01:50:40,410 --> 01:50:43,243
''l'll fix this boy so...
- No, Chopra''

663
01:50:44,647 --> 01:50:47,912
Pitch a stone in slush and
the muck's going to stick to you

664
01:50:49,052 --> 01:50:51,247
What is a family matter
should remain a family matter

665
01:50:52,255 --> 01:50:57,249
Before this boy causes
anymore trouble for us...

666
01:50:57,794 --> 01:51:04,256
l want my daughter to become
your daughter-in-law

667
01:51:05,602 --> 01:51:07,263
What?

668
01:51:25,421 --> 01:51:29,084
Junior speaking.
- Stop speaking and start doing

669
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:32,453
Chopra? What happened?
- That boy's back

670
01:51:32,729 --> 01:51:36,028
Which boy?
- The one you beat up...

671
01:51:36,332 --> 01:51:39,028
and dumped outside the city.
- The bastard!

672
01:51:39,302 --> 01:51:42,567
''Don't worry, Chopra. l'll send
my boys and have him picked up''

673
01:51:51,648 --> 01:51:54,242
''You're always drinking.
- Not your money, is it?''

674
01:51:58,421 --> 01:52:01,652
There they are...
pull up the car this side!

675
01:52:27,283 --> 01:52:29,615
Bhai-jaan's men! Run!

676
01:52:30,286 --> 01:52:35,223
Ajay! Run!
They're Bhai-jaan's thugs!

677
01:52:42,231 --> 01:52:45,223
''No, l'm not going to
be scared and run away''

678
01:52:45,635 --> 01:52:50,231
My feet will advance only
towards my goal and my love

679
01:53:38,287 --> 01:53:40,881
''Who's handcart is this?
- Mine, sir''

680
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:42,489
''Clear out!
- Yes, sir''

681
01:54:16,325 --> 01:54:19,726
''Want to know the truth, Ajay?
We escaped today because ofthe police''

682
01:54:20,596 --> 01:54:23,326
Or we'd have gotten thrashed
for the sake ofyour love

683
01:54:24,067 --> 01:54:27,332
''l understand how you feel, Vicky.
And l also know that this is my fight''

684
01:54:27,837 --> 01:54:33,139
You guys have helped me in this fight.
Even ifwe have to run in future...

685
01:54:33,676 --> 01:54:37,772
we aren't running backwards.
We'll only run forward

686
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:49,082
''No point in running ahead, Ajay.
Look''

687
01:55:13,716 --> 01:55:19,052
''Ajay, use your brains!
So many ofthem, armed to the teeth''

688
01:55:19,489 --> 01:55:21,980
And we're only five of us...
unarmed

689
01:55:22,325 --> 01:55:24,657
Not five. There are just four of us

690
01:55:29,132 --> 01:55:30,326
Sada?

691
01:55:41,344 --> 01:55:45,678
''O Haji Ali, l know no one has
returned empty-handed from here''

692
01:55:46,349 --> 01:55:50,615
''Please help us. l swear,
l'll never touch liquor again''

693
01:55:52,288 --> 01:55:56,019
O Saint Ali... help!

694
01:56:52,281 --> 01:56:54,943
God is with those
who are in love

695
01:56:56,619 --> 01:57:00,885
''What strength do you posses, enemy?
You are a weakling''

696
01:59:21,097 --> 01:59:23,964
Tell Mr Varma and Bhai-jaan...

697
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,928
that l'm not going to die
in the next 20 hours

698
01:59:46,322 --> 01:59:49,587
You mean, an arranged marriage?''

699
01:59:52,528 --> 01:59:54,257
Arranged marriage!

700
02:00:04,006 --> 02:00:07,772
''Ajay, it's all arranged.
l have even spoken to the priest''

701
02:00:08,477 --> 02:00:11,275
He has called you to the temple
at 10 a.m. tomorrow

702
02:00:15,684 --> 02:00:17,675
This is the principal's voice

703
02:00:21,357 --> 02:00:24,952
''Yes, sir?
- Ajay, talk to Ayesha''

704
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:42,372
What is the matter, Ayesha?''

705
02:00:42,578 --> 02:00:45,979
''Do you know what happened
after you left, Ajay?''

706
02:01:08,337 --> 02:01:13,274
''Ayesha, do everything
they want you to do''

707
02:01:14,276 --> 02:01:18,269
Do you understand?
- All l understand...

708
02:01:19,281 --> 02:01:25,948
is that l love you very much.
- l love you very much too

709
02:01:36,232 --> 02:01:38,632
Ajay, what happened?''

710
02:01:44,406 --> 02:01:49,241
Looks like Mr Varma's in a tearing
hurry to become a father-in-law

711
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:56,582
l've got to prepare for my wedding

712
02:02:15,938 --> 02:02:19,874
This is the latest fashion.
- Show us the top-of-the-line stuff

713
02:02:20,276 --> 02:02:25,270
''Tomorrow's our wedding, you see.
- Not our wedding. My wedding''

714
02:02:52,241 --> 02:02:58,237
''Ajay, when l wore
the bridal fineries...''

715
02:02:58,714 --> 02:03:01,706
l wanted you to be the first one
to take a look at me

716
02:03:07,256 --> 02:03:11,056
You look very beautiful.
Just like a bride

717
02:03:22,738 --> 02:03:27,801
''Notjust a bride, Ajay...
l want to be your bride''

718
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:32,278
That l will become only when you
apply vermillion on my forehead

719
02:03:35,284 --> 02:03:38,276
That's why l'm here to
take you away. Come on

720
02:03:42,458 --> 02:03:44,790
What happened?
- Something is fishy

721
02:03:45,694 --> 02:03:48,026
Why's the shop
suddenly abandoned?

722
02:04:53,562 --> 02:04:56,087
''They're beating him...
let me go, Papa''

723
02:04:57,566 --> 02:04:59,227
Leave him alone!

724
02:05:00,302 --> 02:05:05,638
''Papa, they're beating him up!
Stop them! Let me go!''

725
02:05:19,321 --> 02:05:22,916
Well? Two slaps and you are
exorcised ofyour love?

726
02:05:27,329 --> 02:05:33,666
''lnspector, beat this loverjust
as much as the beating you can take''

727
02:05:44,279 --> 02:05:47,271
''Ayesha, come...
- Let me go!''

728
02:05:50,819 --> 02:05:54,619
''Let me go, Papa!
Leave me alone!''

729
02:05:55,524 --> 02:05:56,684
Come on, l say!''

730
02:06:37,266 --> 02:06:39,598
What's that on your forehead?

731
02:06:52,281 --> 02:06:58,015
''Now look, Ayesha. Erase his
memories from your heart forever''

732
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:12,293
Weren't you giving me
dirty looks out there?

733
02:07:13,302 --> 02:07:15,293
Lost it all, behind the bars?''

734
02:07:17,539 --> 02:07:19,803
''You've messed with
the wrong guys, son''

735
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:25,038
Don't take any tension.
l know how a lover feels

736
02:07:25,647 --> 02:07:29,310
''l'll detain you here only for a day,
till Varma's daughter is married''

737
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:35,783
''lnspector, she will indeed be married.
But only to me''

738
02:07:36,658 --> 02:07:39,991
''You threaten me, eh?
Big lover, are you?''

739
02:07:40,329 --> 02:07:42,263
l'll straighten you out

740
02:07:42,631 --> 02:07:44,929
What did you say? What?

741
02:07:45,267 --> 02:07:47,064
Are you deaf?

742
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:49,601
l'm talking to you!

743
02:08:28,377 --> 02:08:33,713
Come to me, my love...''

744
02:08:34,316 --> 02:08:39,253
my eyes await your arrival

745
02:08:40,255 --> 02:08:45,591
''My friends wait
for you too...''''''

746
02:08:45,994 --> 02:08:50,658
every eye looks for you

747
02:08:51,466 --> 02:08:56,665
Come to me, my love''

748
02:09:17,626 --> 02:09:22,689
''Stars will be your
bridal vermillion...''''''

749
02:09:23,298 --> 02:09:28,292
''my sister, you will
be the bride''''''

750
02:09:28,804 --> 02:09:31,102
l know...

751
02:09:31,506 --> 02:09:33,974
he will come...

752
02:09:34,309 --> 02:09:39,576
''and take you away
in a palanquin''''''

753
02:10:05,641 --> 02:10:10,635
''May the colour of
the henna not pale''''''

754
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:16,273
May you not be too late

755
02:10:16,852 --> 02:10:22,290
May the love l have faith in...

756
02:10:22,724 --> 02:10:27,957
not be rendered to dust

757
02:10:28,397 --> 02:10:33,300
So come now, O love''

758
02:10:34,302 --> 02:10:39,239
Come to me, my love''

759
02:11:05,701 --> 02:11:08,602
Come now, my love''

760
02:11:16,278 --> 02:11:19,475
Come now, my love''

761
02:11:51,446 --> 02:11:58,045
''l told you, to beat this loverjust
as much as the beating you can take''

762
02:12:34,289 --> 02:12:38,225
''What misbehaviour is this, Ayesha?
You ought to have thought of my honour!''

763
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:41,957
Those guests are here in our house
to share our happiness!

764
02:12:42,831 --> 02:12:46,892
''Papa, they're here in your house,
to share your happiness''

765
02:12:47,235 --> 02:12:48,793
Now listen, Ayesha...''

766
02:12:50,305 --> 02:12:54,571
''Had my happiness been
your happiness, Papa...''

767
02:12:55,243 --> 02:12:58,644
Ajay would not have been behind bars.
- My child...

768
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:02,040
whatever l'm doing
is for your welfare

769
02:13:07,255 --> 02:13:10,918
He was the one who said that if
he didn't turn up in 24 hours...

770
02:13:11,326 --> 02:13:17,754
''What's 24 hours, Mr Varma?
He isn't coming for 24 lifetimes''

771
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:21,592
He was messing with us... the kid!

772
02:13:26,474 --> 02:13:29,272
''l arrested that kid without
any offence, at your behest''

773
02:13:29,611 --> 02:13:31,875
But that kid has turned out to be
everybody's old man

774
02:13:32,047 --> 02:13:34,038
He has run away from prison

775
02:13:34,282 --> 02:13:37,979
l don't want to get into trouble.
They're both legally eligible

776
02:13:38,353 --> 02:13:40,617
lt's your look-out now.
And one thing...

777
02:13:40,822 --> 02:13:43,757
that lover-boy will do
what he says he will do

778
02:13:46,695 --> 02:13:48,959
''What is the matter, Chopra?
- Mr Varma...''

779
02:13:49,097 --> 02:13:50,962
Ajay has run away from jail

780
02:13:59,374 --> 02:14:06,303
''Who, Uncle Chopra? That ''''kid'''' ...?
You still have 15 hours to go''

781
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,316
Try and stop that ''''kid''''''

782
02:14:19,527 --> 02:14:24,726
''Ayesha, l will stake all the
power and wealth l possess...''

783
02:14:26,401 --> 02:14:28,926
but l will take defeat
from that boy

784
02:14:29,137 --> 02:14:35,076
''You're right, Papa.
You have the power and the money''

785
02:14:36,278 --> 02:14:40,942
You have a lot to stake.
But what are you going to lose?

786
02:14:41,716 --> 02:14:47,951
Power? Money?
But Ajay has nothing except me

787
02:14:48,823 --> 02:14:50,950
l mean everything to him

788
02:14:52,661 --> 02:14:54,754
And he will not accept defeat

789
02:14:58,366 --> 02:15:02,302
''Whatever happens, Ayesha.
l will not let him win''

790
02:15:06,308 --> 02:15:12,304
''He's coming, Papa.
And no one can stop him. No one''

791
02:15:25,493 --> 02:15:27,893
''Bless you on the Moon
ofthe ldd, Bhai-jaan''

792
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:32,127
Just tell me where l'll find that boy

793
02:15:44,946 --> 02:15:46,277
Chhota speaking

794
02:15:47,315 --> 02:15:50,876
That boy has escaped from prison.
l can't take anymore chances

795
02:15:51,353 --> 02:15:53,947
''Whatever you do,
just kill him''

796
02:15:54,456 --> 02:15:59,621
''Just do my bidding and the power
you aspire for, will be yours''

797
02:16:03,798 --> 02:16:05,789
Guys like Bhai-jaan
will work for you

798
02:16:06,301 --> 02:16:10,032
Once my son is married
to Varma's daughter...

799
02:16:10,472 --> 02:16:13,305
my son will become the owner
ofthe Varma empire

800
02:16:13,641 --> 02:16:15,541
l'll give you a lot of money

801
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:19,305
But ifthat boy manages to reach
the venue ofthe wedding tomorrow...

802
02:16:19,647 --> 02:16:26,314
''lt's like this, Chopra. You won't
need me or the cops to kill that boy''

803
02:16:27,655 --> 02:16:30,317
''Maybe you don't know, but the
Moon of ld has been sighted''

804
02:16:30,725 --> 02:16:33,319
Bhai-jaan won't let that boy
see the sunrise tomorrow

805
02:16:33,762 --> 02:16:36,060
Go and have your son
married in style

806
02:16:36,464 --> 02:16:38,455
All right, Junior''

807
02:16:49,778 --> 02:16:54,613
Just do my bidding and the power
you're servile to will be yours

808
02:17:06,294 --> 02:17:08,785
Men like the Boss
will work for me

809
02:17:20,642 --> 02:17:22,109
Ajay...

810
02:17:22,377 --> 02:17:24,709
over here! Quick

811
02:17:36,658 --> 02:17:39,252
Are you okay?
- What okay?

812
02:17:43,465 --> 02:17:46,263
Out ofthe frying pan
and into the fire. Look

813
02:21:33,294 --> 02:21:38,960
l told you to live it up.
Now you're dead

814
02:21:41,302 --> 02:21:44,829
l'm in love. l'll die only once

815
02:21:47,942 --> 02:21:52,606
l'm in love. l'll die only once

816
02:22:40,928 --> 02:22:46,833
''lf l go there, things will go awry?
- Yes, they are nice folks''

817
02:22:47,101 --> 02:22:49,092
They'll get scared.
- What did you say?

818
02:22:49,237 --> 02:22:51,034
Forget it boss

819
02:22:51,906 --> 02:22:58,038
You mean to say l'm a goon? Then
you've been brought up among goons

820
02:22:58,546 --> 02:23:03,643
''l'm your big brother. Get it?
- Boss, he's madly in love''

821
02:23:04,152 --> 02:23:06,848
He's a romantic. Forget him.
- He's a baby

822
02:23:07,121 --> 02:23:11,581
''No, you aren't going there,
you aren't telling anything. Else...''

823
02:23:11,926 --> 02:23:15,259
Else what?
- l'll kill myself

824
02:23:15,563 --> 02:23:18,657
Are you threatening me?
- l'll kill myself

825
02:23:19,133 --> 02:23:21,260
You will?
- Yes

826
02:23:21,469 --> 02:23:23,937
Want to jump?
- Yes

827
02:23:24,272 --> 02:23:27,264
''Go on, jump.
- l'll kill myself''

828
02:23:31,345 --> 02:23:34,280
He's a kid!
- Threatening me?

829
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:40,286
l'm in love. l'll die only once

830
02:23:41,689 --> 02:23:47,286
''But when you know about my love,
you'll die a thousand deaths''

831
02:23:49,363 --> 02:23:50,955
One liners

832
02:24:19,694 --> 02:24:21,992
How did this happen?

833
02:24:33,674 --> 02:24:35,608
How did this happen?

834
02:25:15,149 --> 02:25:18,710
l don't see how you might get
to Ayesha

835
02:25:20,454 --> 02:25:24,322
ln love, there are ways''

836
02:25:26,093 --> 02:25:30,325
Because ofyour pig-headedness
you're going to lose Ayesha for good

837
02:25:32,066 --> 02:25:35,729
''lf l cannot keep my promise,
if l cannot reach her...''

838
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:39,870
then l'll lose myself.
- Not with violence

839
02:25:40,074 --> 02:25:42,668
You can do that with love too

840
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:52,276
No. They started the violence.
All l did was love

841
02:25:56,290 --> 02:26:00,624
Why don't you make him see reason?
He might listen to you

842
02:26:31,325 --> 02:26:32,314
Come on

843
02:26:32,593 --> 02:26:39,055
''Ajay, you performed
at my sister's wedding, didn't you?''

844
02:26:39,567 --> 02:26:43,003
lfyou want to give Ayesha
a Valentine's Day gift...

845
02:26:43,771 --> 02:26:48,003
give her this. l'm paying you
for your services

846
02:27:11,365 --> 02:27:16,302
May Allah protect
the ones who are loved

847
02:28:20,034 --> 02:28:24,767
''Lord, l pray to You;
from You l seek''

848
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:29,040
Your servant begs of You

849
02:28:29,577 --> 02:28:35,038
''5 years ago, l made a mistake.
Forgive me''

850
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:39,242
You have sent me another
just like my brother

851
02:28:39,787 --> 02:28:47,592
''Preserve him and his love
and give him success, Lord. Amen''

852
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:54,930
Happy ldd

853
02:29:01,442 --> 02:29:04,070
''After years, l see a tranquility
on your face''

854
02:29:04,411 --> 02:29:09,678
''Come, let's go to a feast.
- Not today''

855
02:29:10,351 --> 02:29:13,286
l'm going to make a gift
to my little brother

856
02:29:54,261 --> 02:29:55,751
Not today

857
02:29:56,263 --> 02:30:02,668
We have always faced each other
as adversaries. Today...

858
02:30:03,304 --> 02:30:06,273
as friends, let's take on the foe''

859
02:30:15,749 --> 02:30:21,745
''Ajay, we're going to your wedding
and we'll pay them put''

860
02:30:56,590 --> 02:31:00,492
How dare he come in here?

861
02:31:04,365 --> 02:31:08,062
He isn't getting anywhere
near the wedding altar

862
02:31:56,317 --> 02:32:00,583
''l'm not here to stop you,
l'm here to help you''

863
02:32:01,322 --> 02:32:05,816
''No, don't trust him.
He doesn't know what love means''

864
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:10,062
Right. l never knew what love means

865
02:32:10,664 --> 02:32:13,258
That's why l lost my little brother

866
02:32:14,802 --> 02:32:19,603
He too was a true romantic.
He is a true lover too

867
02:32:21,675 --> 02:32:23,267
Go

868
02:32:25,379 --> 02:32:31,284
''No boss, we aren't going to let him
get to the wedding altar''

869
02:32:32,086 --> 02:32:39,618
''Let him pass, he's a true lover.
This is my chance to recant''

870
02:32:41,395 --> 02:32:43,386
Go.
- No boss

871
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:47,523
''Junior...
- Enough, boss''

872
02:32:48,902 --> 02:32:53,236
What he is makes no
difference to me

873
02:32:54,274 --> 02:32:56,538
Besides, it was your brother who died''

874
02:32:58,078 --> 02:33:02,538
''Not mine, nor was the mistake mine.
lt was your mistake''

875
02:33:04,752 --> 02:33:08,518
l've underwritten a contract
to kill the guy you want to save

876
02:33:10,057 --> 02:33:11,251
Period

877
02:33:14,261 --> 02:33:17,594
l've been servile to you
for long enough

878
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:39,014
The first to cast a stone
will be your enemy

879
02:34:02,109 --> 02:34:04,304
Go inside

880
02:34:09,983 --> 02:34:11,712
What's going on?

881
02:34:35,275 --> 02:34:36,765
Who are these men?

882
02:35:09,810 --> 02:35:11,107
Go

883
02:35:11,712 --> 02:35:13,577
Go on brother

884
02:36:47,741 --> 02:36:49,265
Enough

885
02:36:50,677 --> 02:36:53,077
l might do just about anything

886
02:37:06,927 --> 02:37:08,918
Give me the gun

887
02:37:10,631 --> 02:37:13,532
What are you doing?
- l told you

888
02:37:14,101 --> 02:37:19,038
l don't believe in arranged marriages
l believe in love marriages

889
02:37:25,679 --> 02:37:30,309
To keep my promise to the girl l love
l might do just about anything

890
02:37:48,268 --> 02:37:49,667
Stop

891
02:38:02,916 --> 02:38:08,752
You have always stabbed me from behind.
l'm not giving you another chance

892
02:38:11,291 --> 02:38:12,952
Come here

893
02:38:20,233 --> 02:38:22,701
Begin reciting the hymns

894
02:39:14,354 --> 02:39:21,283
Lord! Help me up on my feet
or take my soul

895
02:39:38,245 --> 02:39:41,043
Help me Lord

896
02:40:14,648 --> 02:40:16,946
Man and wife, step forward''

897
02:40:21,087 --> 02:40:23,078
Boss

898
02:41:17,344 --> 02:41:19,608
The wedding has been solemnised

899
02:41:47,307 --> 02:41:54,042
''ln time, l have met my challenge
to you and the promise l made to her''

900
02:41:59,252 --> 02:42:02,244
What are you thinking about?
Finish him off

901
02:42:03,056 --> 02:42:06,787
This goon doesn't deserve to be
your son-in-law. Take the gun

902
02:42:09,329 --> 02:42:11,058
One minute Papa

903
02:42:12,265 --> 02:42:18,602
He has escaped. l can't take
any chances now. Just kill him

904
02:42:19,072 --> 02:42:23,600
Just do my bidding and the power
you're servile to will be yours

905
02:42:24,444 --> 02:42:26,935
Men like the Boss
will work for you

906
02:42:27,347 --> 02:42:33,946
''Once my son is married, he will
end up owning the Varma empire''

907
02:42:34,287 --> 02:42:38,815
l'm going to make you rich! lf he
reaches the venue ofthe wedding...

908
02:42:40,293 --> 02:42:43,228
Nice joke. Let me have the tape

909
02:42:44,297 --> 02:42:47,232
Mr Varma! What kind of ajoke is this?
Give me a chance to explain

910
02:42:47,567 --> 02:42:53,233
''Chopra, about making someone out
l might make one mistake, not two''

911
02:42:53,807 --> 02:42:59,905
You have showed up to be scum.
And your son...

912
02:43:00,413 --> 02:43:03,246
is the outcome of bad upbringing.
Unlike Ajay

913
02:43:04,384 --> 02:43:07,376
This is an auspicious moment.
l'd rather not do something rash

914
02:43:07,687 --> 02:43:10,053
You should get lost.
- Look Mr Varma...

915
02:43:10,256 --> 02:43:11,484
Get out

916
02:43:17,664 --> 02:43:19,063
My child...

917
02:43:19,633 --> 02:43:26,266
l always wished that the man you marry
loves you more than l love you

918
02:43:28,274 --> 02:43:32,074
Ajay kept his word
and he defeated me

919
02:43:32,779 --> 02:43:37,944
He has proved
that he loves you immensely

920
02:43:39,686 --> 02:43:42,280
l accept the match

921
02:44:04,377 --> 02:44:09,906
Thank you brother.
- l ought to thank you

922
02:44:10,750 --> 02:44:15,881
ln you l have found my little brother.
- And l have found a big brother

923
02:44:21,327 --> 02:44:26,321
l also have a tough father-in-law.
Come on brother

924
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:33,328
''Ajay, Mini would like
to speak to you''

925
02:44:33,807 --> 02:44:37,265
Yes Mini?
- Not fair. You got married

926
02:44:37,610 --> 02:44:39,805
And you didn't even bother about me?
Even l want to get married

927
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:43,272
But you're still a baby.
- When will my turn come?
