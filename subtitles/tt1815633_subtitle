1
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,903
Oh, my God!
What is happening?

2
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,908
Something has happened
to sister Damian.

3
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,151
Let, s get out.

4
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,001
Catch them.
- Move fast.

5
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,472
It is the first time in the
history of this monastery.

6
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,866
They took everything.

7
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,125
Holy ornaments, antics,
coins. Everything.

8
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,563
You won, t be able to recognize
them again. Would you?

9
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,432
No, sir!
They were wearing masks.

10
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,569
It was a theft.

11
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,333
Did any one enter
the room and misbehave?

12
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,071
Except the valuables in the church
or museum nothing is missing.

13
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,583
Lock the door.
- Yes, madam!

14
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,842
Yes, sir!
- Who is that girl?

15
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,249
Ann Merry. Back home in our home
church her mother is a servant.

16
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,084
When she became ill we
brought her here. - Here?

17
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,923
For the time being she is
the manager of the convent.

18
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,694
There is a plan of making
her a nun in the church.

19
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,936
It is the same gang.

20
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,264
The gang with the masks.

21
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,441
We guessed, sir.
That is why we informed you.

22
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,109
Thank you! We have been
after them for sometime.

23
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,438
I know sir
- The Interpol will take it up from here.

24
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,443
Sure. - Bye!
- Yes, sir!

25
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,458
Who are these God darnit fools?

26
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:50,599
Central

27
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,549
Good morning, sir!

28
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,186
Their last attempt was
the Sheik Palace.

29
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,363
Before that a mall in Vienna.
A museum in Malaysia.

30
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,362
Then a bank in Singapore.
All these are very tall buildings.

31
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,694
Only the most talented
acrobats can climb them.

32
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,837
So any photographs
or any other evidence?

33
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,042
Not even a single fingerprint.
They are the masters of the game.

34
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,542
On top of that they hide
their faces behind masks.

35
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,373
We have no clues
to their identity.

36
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,675
They were initially fired.
One got killed in that shoot-out.

37
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,544
It was after the palace theft.
The rest escaped.

38
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,050
Then after that?
- One year of complete silence.

39
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,223
Now they are on the game.
Same style. Same mode.

40
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,393
I suspect that the monastery
theft is only a preparation.

41
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,052
Yes, they always go for big challenges.
Now the target will be another monastery.

42
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,391
And I, m sure it is
a start for a bigger crime.

43
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,925
A crazy research on all the
tall buildings in the city.

44
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,595
And the major events
happening there.

45
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,258
These are the buildings similar in structure
and architecture to the monastery.

46
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,925
One is a government office.
Next is the music academy.

47
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:02,096
This is the Hotel Renaissance.
- And the events?

48
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,674
The first two has no up coming events.

49
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,435
But Hotel Renaissance is about to
host something very interesting.

50
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,681
The biggest wedding
reception of the year.

51
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,675
Whose wedding?

52
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,714
Elisa,s. Industrialist Cyriac
Abraham, s daughter.

53
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,784
Tell, what is your plan of action?

54
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,831
Here he is.

55
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,972
Arjun! Are you paying attention?
- Yes.

56
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,977
Maninder Bedi! The seventh
richest expensive man.

57
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:48,817
From 75 lakhs francular watch to five lakh
Cartios sun glasses are his holdings.

58
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,649
All transactions through
credit cards.

59
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:56,484
That too all international
bank credit cards.

60
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,325
Stefan Zimmier!
German businessman.

61
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,697
In New ersey there was a
diamond auction last month.

62
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,667
He was the star there. For the
wedding the family will also be there.

63
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,670
Mostly to show off in front of the wife
he, ll have those diamond collections.

64
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,939
Mohammad Hadil!

65
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,615
Not only to attend the engagement and
marriage but a multi-crore transaction

66
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,444
He is a very private man.
He travels a lot.

67
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,783
All the places where he goes
he does unlimited shopping.

68
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,530
We must be there for
the engagement party.

69
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:38,532
With important guests, especially
these three we must do interactions.

70
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:43,204
That will help us for the
job on the marriage day.

71
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,370
But we must keep far away
from the bride and groom

72
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,148
and their relatives
as much as possible.

73
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,376
The date of the arrival of the three.
Their room numbers. In two days.

74
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,053
Done.

75
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,617

76
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,555

We, ll increase the
numbers of the team.

87
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,102
Mr. Casanova!
Welcome to Dubai!

88

Please! Casanova is coming.

98
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,357
Waiting to see the Home Minister
stuck in the airline?

99
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:24,195
It is more interesting to see
us waiting at Dubai airport.

100
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,200
We all know about the Casanova who
lived in Italy three decades ago.

101
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,376
He was a sensational lover
who loved 122 girls.

102
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,538
For the same named guy
these girls are waiting here.

103
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,650
They seem to be
in a competitive mood.

104
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:45,881
We, ll ask his private secretary
about this Casanova. Come.

00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,399
Those people can say two
lakh words about Casanova.

110
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:10,308
Lolita, Sylvia, Cassandra, Gabriela.
Ask about Krishan to Gopikas.

111
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,517
Tell us madam
who is this Casanova?

112
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:22,093
A man filled with music of flowers.
A beautiful dream that is Casanova.

113
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,594
He is some one for whom
I wait every spring season.

114
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,335
The hottest guy in Europe.
He comes to me every year.

115
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,266
To dance,
to party and to love.

Central

140
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,950
Sir! The paper
of the date you told.

141
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,023
So it is like this.

142
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,526
31st morning at 10.30 in Palm Fields,
flower show inauguration.

143
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,358
12 o, clock meeting with Krishna Menon.
- That, s regarding?

144
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,198
They are interested in a business
tie up. I had told you.

145
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,030
No, Not now.
- Then the boutique.

146
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,371
He is a big shot here.

147
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,371
Casanova springs doesn, t
do business with anyone else.

148
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,205
Casanova, s flowers are for
Casanova only. - Yes, sir!

149
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:13,048
With the Sahya channel people you have
an interview for the programme love bites.

150
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,551
It is Ajoy Mappan sir who is its CEO.
That is why I agreed to this programme.

151
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,980
Did he leave the National
Geography channel?

152
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,216
He has left them. Since two
months he is with these people.

153
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,619
From the title 'Love Bites, I think the
programme must be about love.

154
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,067
For that they will get
better people than me.

155
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,836
While doing a programme on prayer
who will be better than Marpapa?

156
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,304
On the evening of the 1st
Malhotra is hosting a fashion show.

157
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,749
On the second you, ll be
fully in our office.

158
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,579
Since some days the staff has a complaint
that you don, t concentrate there.

159
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,247
In front of Empire Tower
he was shot dead.

160
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,258
While escaping from there the incident
happened under the Empire Tower.

161
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,031
The investigation is on.

162
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:05,894
Today evening at Sheikh Palace after
the theft five guys tried to escape.

163
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,435
In that gang one was killed.

164
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,764
I, m here to lodge a complaint
on the four-member gang.

165
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,205
Sir, please! Behave yourself.
And clear him out.

166
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,278
This case was taken
over by Interpol.

167
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,881
On 3rd there is
a marriage reception.

168
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,453
On the 4th morning at 7 o, clock
you, ll be leaving.

169
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,286
No. Let the staff go back.

170
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,964
Appointments?
- Cancel them all.

171
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,134
How much ever important
it may be.

172
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,889
I appreciate your concern.

173
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,092
I, m not interested in making
an issue of it.

174
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,497
I have made the security arrangements
not to allow strangers.

175
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,502
Okay, but three of our officers
have to be here today.

176
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,038
Not only here but also in the
church and in the reception.

177
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,344
That is our standard procedure.
Please! Co-operate.

178
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:26,844
But don, t disturb my guests and please
don, t act like police officers.

179
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,680
Thank you!
- Welcome!

180
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,289
Please!
Keep to your left, sir.

181
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:16,524
Central

182
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,068
Girls! Come on.

183
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,078
Yes, sir! One second.

184
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,678
I, ll just change and come. Okay?
- Okay. - Nice.

185
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,147
Excuse me, sir!
Sorry for the trouble.

186
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,753
Four people are saying that
they have come with you.

187
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,923
If you could have a look,
just for clarification.

188
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,505
They are my men. Get them in.
- Okay, sir! Thank you!

189
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,937
The prey has come by itself in front
of me at point blank range.

190
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,610
It is they, Luca.

191
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,666
Come on.

192
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,240
Casanova! My friend.

193
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,805
Is it your own name
or given by someone?

194
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,141
I was given but
I have made it my own.

195
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:45,314
Haines stays in his farm.
- Mahadevan! My CEO. Please! Come.

196
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,984
It was you?
- Yes. - Arun! - Yes.

197
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,825
Are you here now?
- Yes. I settled here.

198
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:56,998
Take care.
- Bye!

199
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:03,099
Hello! Don, t you remember me?
I, m Luca. Casanova, s private secretary.

200
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,378
You had an old girl friend.
- She is not my girl friend.

201
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,111
Very good.
She was a gone case.

202
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,943
Our sir has gone around
her to so many places.

203
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,177
Now she is my wife.
- I see. I see.

204
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:31,124
Nuns! Good evening, sisters!
- Good evening.

205
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,700
Good evening, sister Rosario.
- Good evening!

206
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,137
Good evening sister Alexandra!
- Good evening!

207
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,640
Good evening sister Uterus!
- Uferus! - I, m sorry.

208
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,549
Come on.

209
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,393
Come here.

210
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,912
It is stylish. Did you straighten hair?
- Yes.

211
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,910
You said you, ll wear the dress
that I bought for you.

212
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,682
They kept it in almairah saying
the length of the skirt was short.

213
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,652
How are you tolerating this?

214
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:27,653
If I had been in your place...
Come, let us join them.

215
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,924
No.
- Come on.

216
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:36,192
Not me. Come on, pal.
- Please, no. - Get up.

217
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:40,259
I, m a great fan of yours.
I have been waiting to meet you.

218
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,199
That is nice.

219
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,948
Let's have something.

220
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,256
There you have flower field?
- Yes.

221
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,166
Why do you keep only ladies in the job?

222
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,996
What is the reason?

223
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,600
On the staff list there is no fun having names
like Babu, Shashi, and Devakaran.

224
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,477
Instead the name Sophia,
ulia, Christina is good.

225
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,510
That is good.

226
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,615
I have heard that you know
more than 2,000 girls.

227
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,415
Those are stories made out by enemies.

228
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,352
I, ll know much more
of them than that.

229
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,516
Photograph please!

230
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,791
No, Uncles! Him alone.

231
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,884
I told you there won, t be any problem.
- Yes.

232
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,067
Sam! Look at the guy who is
right behind me with girls.

233
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,064
Can you place him?

234
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,328
Which guy? There is no one here with girls.
- What?

235
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,066
Looks good.

236
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,176
Excuse me! The gentleman
here whose photograph

237
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,406
You were can you tell
me who that was?

238
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,814
That was Mr. Casanova.
Casanova is an eternal spring.

239
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,088
Casanova!

240
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,882
Arjun! Shall I serve dinner?

241
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,383
No, mother! We had it.

242
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:06,934
Central

243
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,547
Scared of separation,
don, t remain without loving.

244
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,652
Have a wonderful life.

245
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,995
Okay, sir! - Okay.
- Thank you!

246
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,836
See you, guys!
- Thank you, sir!

247
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,004
We, ll be winding up this
programme by next week.

248
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,503
The Vice President directly
told us to wind this up.

249
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,333
Why like that?

250
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,839
There is a reason for that.

251
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,671
The rating is very bad.
Last week it was 1.5.

252
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,282
From the time we started this programme
we have been trying to get you in this.

253
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,075
We didn, t think we, ll get you.

254
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,345
Okay.

255
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,921
Sir! CEO Ajoy Mappan, He had asked
to call after the programme.

256
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,693
Hello, Ajoy! One second.

257
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,595
Inside the studio it is a mistake to
do a programme about love

258
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,632
Another mistake is
the name 'Love Bites.,

259
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:09,205
Try to change it totally. It will beat
any top rating programme.

260
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,071
You do anything.

261
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,543
Mappan!
The time I came you vanished.

262
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:21,211
What to do, buddy. Our cabinet
minister called at that time.

263
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,742
How can I escape?

264
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,522
Other then you who, ll leave
National Geography?

265
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:31,058
Instead of taking the photos of deer
and rabbit in the forest.

266
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,728
When shall we meet?
- I, ll call you. Okay.

267
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,134
Okay, guys! See you.
Bye! - Bye, sir!

268
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,806
At 4.30 the bride
and groom will leave.

269
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,072
The other relatives also.

270
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,113
At 5 o, clock the party will start.

271
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,481
At 5.15 sharp the current
in the hall will go.

272
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:02,152
At the same time Stefan Zimmier, s
child will have an accident.

273
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:03,953
Done.

274
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:09,361
In that commotion we three will enter
the three rooms of our targets.

275
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:13,196
Salim! Be ready with
the car outside the hotel.

276
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,703
We must disconnect
the hidden cameras.

277
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,670
Remember.

278
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,039
We have just five minutes
for the whole process.

279
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,875
Now here we go again.

280
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,449
4.30, the bride and groom
enter the hall.

281
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,514
There is a style about their robbery.

282
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,056
First they, ll divert the attention
of the people around them.

283
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,558
The rocket speed robbery
will be at that time.

284
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,527
Tomorrow also it might happen.

285
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,693
Don, t miss anything
that looks unusual.

286
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,135
Sir! How can you be sure that tomorrow
they, ll create a problem?

287
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,208
They took nearly 20 photographs
of the party hall arrangements.

288
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,606
Some particular VIPs also.

289
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,544
These are those VIPs who, ll be returning
back as soon as the wedding is over.

290
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,817
After tomorrow for two months
there is no function or...

291
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:11,121
...an occasion at the Renaissance
which can attract robbers.

292
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:17,225
They, ll move and
they, ll move tomorrow.

293
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,334
The robbers who can, t be
caught by anyone.

294
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,874
Their confession will be seen by this
whole city. It, ll be live.

295
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,016
Tomorrow 4.30 live?

296
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,910
Hotel Renaissance?
- Yes.

297
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,282
The channel crew should be ready
there at 4 o, clock.

298
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,721
No one should suspect that
the one coming are from the media.

299
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,121
Whoever asks they
must say that only.

300
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,024
It should be in total secrecy.

301
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,429
If it is done like that.

302
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,656
If it is done,

303
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:52,324
then it, ll be the most sensational
live program of your channel.

304
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,370
That, s a deal.
- What is this program about?

305
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,940
I need to have a guideline.
- No guidelines.

306
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,543
Like the audience
the CO will also have to wait.

307
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,577
Till 5 o, clock tomorrow.

308
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,215
For a live programme there
are a lot of requirements.

309
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,214
Do you know how many
I, ll have to convince?

310
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,444
What is the guarantee?
- I, m the guarantee.

311
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,123
My word is the guarantee.
Take it or leave it.

312
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,951
You alone are not media.

313
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,324
I take it.

314
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,360
Sir! I have reached the hotel.
The channel crew is ready.

315
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,969
They are waiting for you.

316
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:33,808
Hannah!

317
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,538
Something bad has happened, sir!
- What?

318
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:41,742
While leaving for the church the boy, s
father had a massive stroke.

319
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,820
They changed the marriage date.
- Postponed?

320
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,320
What?

321
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,884
Postponed?
- Let us get out from here. Now.

322
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,234
I had the phone call just now.
What to do?

323
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,769
We have to speed up, sir.

324
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,137
Everything is fine.
- Yes, so far.

325
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,273
Has everyone turned up?

326
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,813
Guests, relatives, families.
- Yes, some are here.

327
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:16,111
Then so many to interview and all.
- Media?

328
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,522
Whose interview?
- One of the guests, sir. Mr. Casanova.

329
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,183
Casanova!

330
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,861
3, 2, 1. Start.

331
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,024
On hearing live if you have...

332
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,396
...put on the TV to see a murder
or an accident, forgive me.

333
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,468
This programme is not for you.

334
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,799
For those who have loved or
who are in love.

335
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,977
For those who are going to love
instead of 'Love Bites...,

336
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,874
...it, ll be my programme in that place.

337
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,309
The biggest reality in life.
A reality show.

338
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:53,479
These beautiful evenings will be
for all lovers and lady loves.

339
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,890
Sir! What the hell?

340
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:00,990
This programme will start from
the marriage ritual that started.

341
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,293
With Sakhiya Channel and you,
I, ll also be there.

342
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:09,232
We, ll name the coming days
of togetherness.

343
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,737
It, ll be called "Fall in Love,, .

344
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,209
Put the commercial. Quick.

345
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,847
I don, t understand, sir.
What sensation is there in this?

346
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,107
To say this what was
the need for a live show?

347
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:23,981
And what is this, sir?
Who is he to take over our programme?

348
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,989
I, ll talk to him.

349
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,791
I came to attend just a marriage
and go.

350
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,831
You know about my busy schedules.

351
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,562
Postponing all that if I, m adamant
about this programme.

352
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,673
You must understand there has
to be some reason behind that.

353
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,101
I have to do that.

354
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,310
Then I, ll also ask.

355
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,246
I must also know some of the matters.

356
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,887
Why to do a recorded programme?

357
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,557
Like live programme
my participation will be there.

358
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:01,850
That, ll be from the audience side.

359
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,391
Rime! If the programme
is good there won, t be any...

360
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,062
...difference if the programme
is live or recorded.

361
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:10,792
We, ll split into four teams.
We need love stories.

362
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,969
Pre-written statements and
situations are not needed.

363
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,438
In trains, beaches,
coffee shops, parks.

364
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,770
We must find out that it is
happening in front of our eyes,

365
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,275
Each team should be
able to do that.

366
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,542
We have five more days.

367
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,653
By Sunday night we should be
ready with the first episode.

368
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:37,819
By Monday the whole of Dubai
is going to fall in love.

369
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,131
These flowers will also have
an aim in their birth.

370
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,567
They, ll change and write
the lives of two people.

371
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,503
God must have sent them by
ordering like them.

372
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,674
Love was there before.
After marriage everything is gone.

373
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,111
The most beautiful feeling
on this planet.

374
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,586
Love? I hate love.

375
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:17,424
Central

376
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:28,873
To my dearest Arjun.

377
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,882
To my Ann.

378
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:42,622
Since the last three days a bunch
of flowers is coming daily.

379
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,954
That too the very expensive ones.

380
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,460
Tell us who is sending all this?

381
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,224
I don, t know, mother.

382
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,901
Excuse me, mother!

383
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,404
It was our company
which sent these flowers.

384
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,543
But daily there are nearly
100 customers.

385
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,509
If you ask who sent
this particular bunch...

386
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,306
How can you say that?

387
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,349
There should be some phone number
or receipt for this.

388
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,042
Since three days
it is coming like this.

389
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,516
The sender, s name
is also not there.

390
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,759
Hey Shah! Good.

391
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,495
Your turn.

392
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,740
I have told him that those
flowers were sent by Ann.

393
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,274
I gave the number also
- He called me up.

394
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,571
When he said it is Arjun
I cut the phone off.

395
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,113
Without having any idea
about what to say.

396
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,275
One joke.

397
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,182
Through 'Fall in Love, program
I, ll write this sweet love story.

398
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,586
Give it the seriousness of a
snake and ladder game.

399
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,387
But in the end when the
boy comes to know?

400
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:56,055
It is just a practical joke.
It is nothing too serious.

401
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,292
He, ll also take it in that spirit.

402
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,534
Look, Hannah,
I, m not compelling you.

403
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,105
I, m with you, sir!

404
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,971
Tell me what I should do?
- Okay.

405
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,042
Call him.

406
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,239
You are meeting tomorrow
at 8 o, clock.

407
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,312
It, ll be in Cool Off Discothèque.
- Why?

408
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,885
Ust love him.

409
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,999
You told Mother Superior that some
anonymous guy sent flowers to Ann.

410
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,901
Don, t we need a story
for that character also?

411
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,905
At one side discotheque,
loud music.

412
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,704
Another side it will be silence
and the river side.

413
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,710
What do you mean?
- I hate love.

414
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,623
Idiot! Leave the way.

415
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,002
37 seconds.

416
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,240
I came to give this back.

417
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,944
You forgot it at the restaurant.
- What nonsense?

418
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,887
It is not mine.

419
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,557
Get out, you stupid.

420
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,806
Late. Too late.

421
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:22,103
The bike was too slow.
- For that we need Arjun.

422
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,178
It must be he who should
ride the bike.

423
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,578
You spoilt the chance
we got to practice.

424
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,119
Shall we leave it?

425
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,417
This is too much of a risk.

426
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,217
Anyway, we have that marriage plan.

427
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,122
To some extent we reached there.

428
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,797
Let us get hold of that.
- We need not open that chapter.

429
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,463
The place and the visitors
would have been changed.

430
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,134
We may not get another Casanova.

431
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:52,900
If this goes on smoothly,
you know what is the rate of that sword?

432
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,340
Original Samurai antique.

433
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,913
Half a million dirham is the rate
in the international market.

434
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,210
The risk is also too much.
- There is no risk.

435
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,148
Practice has to be perfect.

436
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,389
Where the hell is Arjun?

437
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:34,848
Hanna!

438
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,781
Hi, Arjun! Please!

439
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,192
So tell me. What is it?

440
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,221
Smoke.

441
00:42:52,803 --> 00:43:02,769
Central

442
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,808
I just want to be friends with you.

443
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,854
Are you not in the soccer team?

444
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,087
Once I had come with friends
to see a match.

445
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,059
That time you were playing
and I liked you.

446
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,667
I mean liked you meaning
your game.

447
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,669
To be friendly, you could have
come directly and met me.

448
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,843
Or you could have phoned me.
Why these anonymous gifts?

449
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:38,913
That is my style.
Hanna style. Friends.

450
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,148
Stop. Where is your partner?
- My partner...

451
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,521
Abdullah! They are all my partners.

452
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,500
The boy has come.

453
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,972
In 2006 you left her.
Varsha Gate Kurnicova of Uganda

454
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,043
Signature please.

455
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,477
You go and do the deal.
- My pleasure.

456
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:14,846
Hi!

457
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,586
Vuca!
- Not Vuca it is Luca.

458
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,758
How are you?
- I, m fine.

459
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,829
Last week was the marriage date.

460
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:31,468
The boy, s father had a stroke.
So it has been postponed.

461
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,159
What is the name of your father?

462
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,565
Sereic! Sereic Abraham!

463
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,502
Do you know him?
- I have heard about him.

464
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,308
Oh, God!
- What is it?

465
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,607
Family friend.

466
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,147
Hello, sir!

467
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,320
How are you?
- Good, sir!

468
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,688
How come you are here?
- In office I was invited a lot to discothèque.

469
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,656
So I thought I, ll come and
see some files here and relax.

470
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,095
Sir.

471
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:01,798
Please!

472
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,699
The staff told me that your lover
had come to the office.

473
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:09,066
The office staff told me that
he is very handsome as you said.

474
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,800
Then he...
- Sir! Meet my friend, Arjun!

475
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:14,939
Casanova!

476
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,339
Hi!
- Hi!

477
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,007
I think I have
seen him somewhere.

478
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,809
Were you there on the day of
the engagement?

479
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,452
Engagement?

480
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,623
Actually we are meeting
for the first time.

481
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,786
When you play soccer you
must play carefully.

482
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:35,397
The thing that you kick as
a ball is some of the girls, heart.

483
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,364
Sir! Unni Menon has left.
- Okay, carry on.

484
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,305
Sir! Don, t tell father.

485
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,443
Relax and rock.

486
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,579
A small smile.
He went white then.

487
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:58,084
If informed at home,
it, ll be a problem.

488
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,949
If they know at home,
will it be a problem?

489
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,295
Tell me.

490
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,530
What should I say?
You say, Hanna.

491
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,631
What should I say?
You say, Hanna.

492
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,963
Go for a drive?

493
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,466
My pleasure.

494
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,331
My pleasure.

495
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,701
At the correct time
the phone is ringing.

496
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,005
He won, t pick up the call.
It is not possible for him.

497
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,992
How are you able to say so correctly?
- Experience.

498
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,592
"Roses, roses everywhere.,,

499
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,331
"Can I see my pretty
flower right there?

500
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:53,072
"Enter the night. No...
Got to go home. No...,,

501
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:57,907
"Getting late? No...
Then let, s begin.,,

502
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:00,606
"Hey, lt, s already Saturday.
Come all, come on

503
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,786

504
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,954
"Move your body,

505
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,680
"Let, s come close together
and groove your mind.,,

506
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,416
"Hey, lt, s already Saturday.
Come all, come on

507
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,618
"Let me tell you

00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,526
"Let, s come close together

Watch you, watch,
you watch, you like to do.

541
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,592
You actually got to
teach like you do.

"We are searching

551
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,221
A steal has taken place here.
- What?

552
00:49:59,229 --> 00:49:59,786
Ust a second, madam.
- What is this?

553
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,794
You're visual should come after this.

554
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,866
Either you pay the bill
or I, ll call the police.

555
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,968
In the future don, t come in this shop.

556
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,874
What?
- Come, come.

557
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,705
What is this?

558
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,178
The first man to fall in a love trap.

559
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,855
City of Dubai. Beautiful place.

560
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:31,687
In this season for angry people
to unite this much minute is enough.

561
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,991
This is Casanova signing off from
the first episode of,, Fall In Love.,,

562
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,140
It was excellent.

563
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:56,044
To tell the truth when you first told about
this concept I was not much confident.

564
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,016
But this will click big time.

565
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,780
It was just a programme.

566
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,425
Ust because you have a channel
do you think you can do anything?

567
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,219
What is this?
It was a fun game.

568
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,057
Why do youngsters like you
take it so seriously?

569
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,096
If it was a fun game you should have
told that in front of the girl.

570
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,460
Not when she goes away from there.

571
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,397
Before we could say you
asked her to get out.

572
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,730
For that how can you blame us?
- You must go and apologize to her.

573
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:16,735
And that should also come
in the programme.

574
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,408
I, m the CEO of this channel.
- So?

575
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,940
I know what I must do.

576
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,372
Don, t teach me.

577
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,272
You leave now.

578
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:26,539
Please! Leave.

579
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:53,299
Central

580
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,944
I, m the floor manager
at Marks and Spencer,s.

581
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:05,053
I didn, t find anyone there.
That is why I came inside.

582
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,085
What is it?

583
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:11,021
That day whatever happened
was my mistake.

584
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,320
I apologize.

585
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,225
The money we charged that day.
- Give it to me.

586
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:20,031
Due to this don, t stop
coming there, any of you.

587
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,261
I, m sorry.

588
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:27,372
Everything is okay.
But she is a girl who is going to be a nun.

589
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,705
Nun. Poverty, liability, helplessness.

590
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,439
All these three together
is called as becoming a nun.

591
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:37,719
Will any girl from a well-to-do
family become a nun?

592
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,789
She is trapped there.
I know she, ll feel bad.

593
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,587
But she, ll come to know
that real life is outside that monastery.

594
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,786
But due to that it, ll not be over.

595
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,272
Hello!

596
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,374
Do you remember me?
- To remember...

597
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,077
You must go one year back.
We have met.

598
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,717
At the Interpol office.

599
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:12,985
You came to complain
about a gang of five.

600
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,388
I, m oseph from Interpol.
- Sorry! I don, t remember.

601
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,152
I meet so many.

602
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,558
I can, t remember them all
in my busy schedule.

603
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,567
I saw the programme
that you started yesterday.

604
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,259
Interesting.
- Thank you!

605
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,801
Not for the program.

606
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,734
You are a tycoon with
international business.

607
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,738
It is a mystery that you are doing
a silly program like this.

608
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,002
That. I like it.

609
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,710
Tell me, Mr. Casanova!

610
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,745
What is your motive?

611
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,440
What is it that you have hidden
in "Fall In Love?

612
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,141
The twist.

613
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,584
It is not ethical to reveal
the suspense, Mister.

614
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,584
Oseph.

615
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:53,229
Thank you for watching my very
silly program, Mr. Oseph.

616
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,380
Hi, sir!
- Hi!

617
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,816
She is my friend.

618
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,856
She wanted to see you, sir.
That is why I brought her.

619
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,256
Hi, Casanova!
- Ann Mary!

620
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,192
It is not a name given by people.

621
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,161
My parents only named me like this.

622
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,834
Ann is saying due to that programme
at the monastery...

623
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:37,564
...the mothers and sisters are
making fun of her and insulting her.

624
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,639
What is wrong with you?

625
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,141
You unnecessarily trouble
the innocent people.

626
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:46,244
I became a fool in front of
everyone in the shop.

627
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:49,515
Excuse me, sir!
- Sure.

628
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,345
Hi, Arjun! Where are you?

629
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,520
I, ll tell you a big secret.

630
00:54:55,725 --> 00:55:00,025
You promise on esus that
you, ll not tell that outside.

631
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:00,821
I can,t.

632
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,431
We have been taught that
we should not promise on esus.

633
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,363
Okay, no need.
- Esus promise!

634
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,737
Esus promise!
What is the matter?

635
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:14,210
The flowers that day were sent
by the supermarket fellow.

636
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,241
Kiran.

637
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,446
Why did he send that?

638
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:23,847
Flowers are not used only
for decorating a church.

639
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,852
Listening to those in the church, not only this,
but you, ll ask more stupid questions.

640
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:31,391
Flowers have a
meaning called love.

641
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,119
I, m going to become a nun.

642
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:38,965
Ann!

643
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,830
You are living by leaving
everything in life.

644
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,941
Then one day God will ask you that
I gave everything to you.

645
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:55,551
Why did you throw away all that?
You, ll have no answer.

646
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:01,552
We, ll go.

647
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,727
Five minutes.
- I can,t.

648
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,260
Someone is waiting
for me at the market.

649
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,161
You go. I, ll leave after some time.

650
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,262
Bye! See you.

651
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:33,048
If he loves me, why did
he behave like that with me?

652
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:42,594
Behind every great love story
there is a fight.

653
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,037
I, ll be there is 10 minutes.
Okay? - Okay.

654
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,880
All men ask one question.

655
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:03,280
What should we do to make
the girl we love reciprocate?

656
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:08,312
Rule number one.
The golden rule in love.

657
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,059
Be a good listener.

658
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,893
Become a good man
in asking questions.

659
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,558
Whatever she says look into
her eyes and listen carefully.

660
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:24,297
'Bharath Natyam, (lndian Dance) is a passion.
We started when we were in Delhi.

661
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,572
I learnt the basic 'Mudras, (Poses)
And steps there.

662
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,508
How much ever boring
it maybe never intervene.

663
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,238
Let her finish.

664
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:38,351
When I came here
I got Padma Lakshmi as a guru.

665
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,679
She agreed to teach me.

666
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,653
That time I felt as if
I had won a lottery ticket.

667
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,851
That is correct.
It is great to get Padma Lakshmi.

668
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,427
That, s it.

669
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,998
Always pay the bill.

670
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,432
Shall we?
- Yes, sure.

671
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,539
Now to where?
- I have been searching for daily stars.

672
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,012
For the last few days to decorate
the church for my sister, s marriage.

673
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,708
It is not there anywhere.
- What?

674
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,216
Daily stars flowers.

675
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,683
It is very rare.

676
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:14,719
Thank you, Sir!

677
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,416
No, ladies first.
Open the door for her.

678
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,357
Please
- Thanks.

679
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:27,027
Only very close people are
being invited for the marriage.

680
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,132
It is 11 o, clock on the 16th.
Christ Church Cathedral.

681
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,103
You must come.

682
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,245
You must also invite me
to introduce to mother.

683
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,488
Surprise.

684
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:51,327
A thing that any girl will love.
Give her a surprise.

685
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:07,406
How did you?

686
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,838
Thanks.

687
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,109
So on the 16th morning at 10 o, clock.
The sword comes.

688
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,016
16th?
- Yes.

689
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,088
I have some other appointment.

690
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,317
We are not discussing
this plan for the first time.

691
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,084
You are objecting to the date.

692
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,889
I remembered about
my engagement now.

693
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,365
Of late your programmes
are increasing.

694
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:37,429
That day you didn, t come for practice.
I, m noticing from that time.

695
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:42,535
Unnecessary distractions.
Some secret phone calls.

696
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,713
50 million dirham is the cost
of this antique piece.

697
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,818
We need no program
which is more important than this.

698
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,454
Do you understand?
- There is urgency of this half million.

699
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,819
Holiday, betting, bikes those are
on the priority list in this half million.

700
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,961
Your list was also like that
only till yesterday.

701
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,530
16th morning 10 o, clock
the sword will be reaching.

702
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:10,229
From there through blue water
express special van to the museum.

703
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,103
Kiran and Salim will follow
from the sea port road.

704
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,675
Check the details.
- Okay.

705
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,971
Me and Arjun from the highway.

706
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,241
I can, t come for the marriage.

707
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,312
I have an earlier
commitment to attend.

708
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,422
I remembered itjust now.

709
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,624
This was an invitation
which you gave for the first time.

710
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,193
Don, t think that I didn, t
take it seriously.

711
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,488
This is the last time.

712
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,958
In the future I, ll not have any commitment
more important than our friendship.

713
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,931
This is the last. I promise.

714
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:58,844
Central

715
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,677
Love.

716
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,009
It can turn an old man
into a 16-year old boy.

717
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,773
I, ll make even a devil
see a dream. Love.

718
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:35,318
When we start to talk that language
we wish that the day should start early.

719
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,483
We pray that day should never end.

720
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,625
Any living being can
understand this language.

721
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:18,526
The biggest prayer.
This is the Casanova signing off.

722
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,862
You said on doubting anything
I must call and inform you.

723
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:25,296
That is why I did this.
Actually it is cheating.

724
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,366
Helping the law
is never cheating.

725
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,706
It is just an observation.
It could be silly also.

726
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,111
In the first episode he made
a mystery with flowers.

727
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,985
Now watch this, sir.

728
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,558
The episode that is going
to be telecaste.

729
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,559
There is a question
where those flowers went.

730
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,665
This guy could be
the answer to that.

731
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:56,229
Who is she?
- Hanna! She is Casanova, s friend.

732
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,738
He came to Dubai to attend
the marriage of this girl, s sister.

733
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,806
The main focus is on him.
Not on Henna.

734
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:08,780
In the discotheque he gave special instruction
to the camera man that it should be like that.

735
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,579
Rema! Do you know this guy?
- No.

736
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:15,053
In another story he has
left it in the middle.

737
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:20,628
My idea is in the coming episodes the rest of
the supermarket issue will be continued.

738
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,526
That was also his scripting.

739
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,758
The other couples had
only small moments.

740
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:29,768
The crew will follow two couples
in the next episode also.

741
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:34,033
That also saying as flowers that came
from somewhere with small tiffs.

742
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,680
I want all the tapes of Fall In Love.

743
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,543
The episodes of up till now
and the future ones too.

744
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,843
So do you think it is
a created program? - No.

745
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,024
But I definitely think it is
a targeted program.

746
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:55,193
Fall In Love.
All of you can join this love challenge.

747
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,231
For that you have
to do only this much.

748
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,925
On the top of that building
there is a small bridge.

749
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,798
You have to cross that.

750
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:08,204
On the other side you, ll find
a pure golden ring.

751
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,403
You can gift this to your dear one.

752
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,082
Now, let us start the race.

753
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:35,400
Excuse me!
- Yes.

754
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,766
Two coffees. One cold.
- Okay.

755
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:54,079
Central

756
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:03,590
He also lost.
- What is there if he lost?

757
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,768
He at least tried to show
what is in his heart.

758
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,397
Who knows what she is saying?

759
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,094
Ust a second.
- Okay.

760
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,706
Now who is next?
- You go.

761
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,142
Aye, look.

762
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:22,044
Someone is there.
Give him a big clap.

763
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,171
Love will sometimes make us brave.

764
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,610
Sometimes it will make us selfless.

765
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,303
Daily star flowers.
- No, no.

766
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,175
Money, money.
No, no money.

767
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,787
In a minute sometimes
it, ll make us fools.

768
01:06:56,912 --> 01:07:01,815
"With love you give a kiss.
That sweet pain is what love is.,,

769
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:06,455
"The early sun rays touch you.

"If I don, t see you one day,
I will feel I, m melting.,,

784

Beach road. We are waiting.
- Sheikh Said! I, m in the Car.

805
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,845
A truck is coming.
Blue water express.

806
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:03,149
Salim!
Be ready. I, m coming.

807
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,699
Hey... You are the one
from Fall In Love. Come on.

808
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:15,026
Are you alone? Oh my god...

809
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,501
Take a picture.
- I'm in a hurry.

810
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:18,866
How did you manage that?

811
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,269
It was great. Autograph please.
- One second.

812
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:28,149
It, s okay. Let me go now.
Please! Please!

813
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:59,504
Central

814
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,670
Sir! We talked to the guards.

815
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,704
It, s those four again.

816
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,074
Airport, subway station, Bus station.
Our people should be everywhere. - Yes.

817
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,111
They should not be missed.
- Yes, sir!

818
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,305
They should not get away this time.
God dammit.

819
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,752
It must be the police which come.
Else.

820
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,888
If it had been the police,
they would have followed us.

821
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,923
The one who came wanted the sword.
- But who?

822
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,388
Who knows about this plan?

823
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,755
If it had been before,
no one would have known.

824
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:36,794
Our identity was a secret.

825
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,159
That was our power.

826
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,497
Now both of you are TV heroes.

827
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,171
You, ll have lot of fans to follow you.

828
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:49,444
Dance, song, love.
Which is required?

829
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,171
Arjun and Kiran rock.

830
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,581
What those girls require he must be
giving regularly in the bedroom.

831
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,377
You are fools.

832
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,853
Alaxe! I agree that I fell in a trap.

833
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,390
But be careful when you talk.
Leave that girl out of this.

834
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:08,529
She is not like that.
- He, ll give only used girls.

835
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,425
Will he give fresh virgins to you?

836
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,032
That too for you to love.
- You...

837
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,202
Leave it.
- Alaxe!

838
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,772
Look.
- Get away.

839
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,785
15 minutes.
- Yes, sir!

840
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,455
I don, t know
whether I felt it.

841
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:39,423
I felt there was threatening in that.
- Henna! Do one thing.

842
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,825
Tell Arjun to come in the same
restaurant within half an hour.

843
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:46,432
On your feet, guys.
The villains of the love have came.

844
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:50,230
From today it is not fall in love.
It is love bites. Let, s move.

845
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,471
Look. I don, t know you.

846
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,904
I don, t need to tell my
personal things to you.

847
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,975
We are not asking about
the brand of your perfume.

848
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:59,409
You are playing with our friend.
We know for whom you are doing this.

849
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,914
But for what that you must tell.
- I told you.

850
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:06,020
It was a fun game on the TV.
Except that I...

851
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,552
Then we must know the rest
of the game now.

852
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,247
Don, t shout.

853
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,869
Friends?
- Yes.

854
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,074
They are harassing me for some time.

855
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,370
In the name of the fun show on the TV.

856
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,605
Cross questioning and threatening me.

857
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,306
Did you think
we, ll get scared by his presence?

858
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,817
Salim! She is my friend.
Don, t act smart.

859
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:47,718
Some visuals like that came in the TV.
I don, t think it is a big calamity.

860
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:51,762
I saw the program with my family.
We had a good laugh on seeing it.

861
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:58,064
I met a guy and talked.
We became close.

862
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,104
In your definition
immediately it is love.

863
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,573
Arjun! Did you understand?
They are saying we are in love.

864
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:05,076
How are your friends?

865
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,549
After a period two people may
not even see each other.

866
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,310
That kind of relationship
is just friendship.

867
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,421
It is cheap to see
it in another angle.

868
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:20,555
Arjun! I, m sorry.
I, ll call you later.

869
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:39,904
Central

870
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:46,676
I think this is going
to be the best episode.

871
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,953
Is everything packed?
I hope there is nothing left free.

872
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,353
No, but there is news.

873
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,051
Ann Mary is going to be sent
out of the monastery

874
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,820
It is in the name of our program.

875
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,699
Next week she will be
sent to her home town.

876
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:13,641
Sir! You brought me in this
saying it is an innocent game.

877
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:18,750
Where is innocence in this?
The best episode is people falling down.

878
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:22,617
The more the pain the rating
will go up. Isn, t it?

879
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,318
You people entered half way.

880
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,620
You won, t understand
what is going to come.

881
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,761
By what you saw till now
you won, t understand.

882
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,397
Unless you know the starting.

883
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:55,517
Casi you naughty.
- Yea, Okay. Come on.

884
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:59,023
Now tell me, Richa!
- That one.

885
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,991
That one?
Here we go. Okay.

886
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,939
Oh, my God! Casa!
What is that guy doing?

887
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,477
He is getting scared.

888
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:12,863
Get out of that AC car.
You bloody. Come on. Get out.

889
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:15,927
Lady!
- I, m sorry!

890
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:19,436
My sweet lady! Are you alright?
- I, m sorry actually it is...

891
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:22,439
No, I, m sorry!
I, m sorry! I, m sorry!

892
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:26,444
It is my mistake.
- So what? So what? It is not a crime.

893
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:28,343
If you have to phone,
you have to.

894
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:32,109
You are sure, are you alright?
- Yes. I, m perfect.

895
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,289
No, no. What shall I give
as compensation?

896
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:41,289
No need. I, m alright.
- No, I, m feeling guilty.

897
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,560
First thing it was my car
which made a mistake.

898
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:49,236
It saw a beautiful car
and kissed her.

899
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:58,211
See it is my car, s fault. You should take
something. Please! At least a coffee.

900
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:05,645
One sec.

901
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,916
Is everything okay, Casa?

902
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,726
Rocky! I, m sorry!
- Rocky! Come back, darling.

903
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,157
I, m sorry, Laila.

904
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:16,591
Come back you.

905
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:22,262
I, m sorry. Tell me your name?
- Nidhi!

906
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,563
Methi! Beautiful name.
- Thank you!

907
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,071
Tell me which coffee shop?
- Almancha.

908
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,335
Mama miya! Perfect.
My favorite place.

909
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,105
To tell the truth
I, m bored of going alone.

910
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,681
This is the first time
I, m taking someone.

911
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:40,282
There my boy friend will be with me.
Do you have any problem?

912
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,015
Boy friend!

913
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:46,022
These old numbers are
boring, Mr. Casanova!

914
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:49,025
It is time to join a refresher course.
All the best.

915
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,697
All the best. Thank you!
- Bye!

916
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:04,872
I got him. I got him.
- Sorry! - It, s all right.

917
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:35,199
Central

918
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:52,257
God!!!

919
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,787
Hi! - Yes. - Accident cases.
- Maria Thomas! Over there.

920
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,271
Hi! - Hi!

921
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:13,605
Excuse me!
- Yes. What can I do for you?

922
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:20,946
My car had an accident. I mean it is not
an accident actually. Hit and run.

923
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,787
Another car came and went
away without stopping.

924
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:28,459
This is the number of that car.

925
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:31,693
I want the address of its owner.
It is... file a complaint.

926
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,237
Gautham Menon!

927
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:53,146
Flat No. 23C. Silver Sand Apartment.
Al-Mecan Street.

01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,152

01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,991
Excuse me!
- Yes.

930
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,493
Can you give me a smile?

931
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:23,172
Casa! Naughty.

932
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:27,514
Bye!
- I, ll miss you.

933
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:30,347
I, ll miss you too.
- How about tomorrow?

934
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:34,183
Tomorrow? This time?
No, no. Make it 8 o, clock.

935
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,526
I love you.
- I love you too, ulia!

936
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,700
Maria!
- I, m sorry, Maria.

937
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,898
I don, t know why? For your face the name
ulia suits you much better. Okay.

938
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:59,050
Why are you looking like this?
It is a lady.

939
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:08,227
After being with you I see
my wife also like this.

940
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,056
What happened?
Did you get the details?

941
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,062
The car belongs to that guy only.

942
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,493
He has two daughters
and Nidhi is the eldest.

943
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,962
She has specialized
in Salsa Dance.

944
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:21,404
The younger one is a boy,
Gokul. Engineering 1st year.

945
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,737
He is in llT.
- Leave him alone. You tell about her.

946
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:28,413
She is already booked.
The boy, s name is Arun Nair.

947
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:32,313
He is doing research on how
to produce gas from garbage.

948
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,978
They met two months back somewhere.
They are in love.

949
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:39,460
This is him.

950
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:43,161
Arun Nair!

951
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:47,932
You are able to feed yourself three
times a day without difficulty.

952
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:50,764
Then why are you snatching
another guy, s food?

953
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:56,103
Doctors and engineers can love.
Flower business man can surely love.

954
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:59,542
But some one who produces
gas from garbage.

955
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:03,606
That also a girl who is learning dancing.
Anyway they will fight and separate.

956
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:06,446
The earlier we make
it we, ll get the benefit.

957
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,464
Please, come.
- Yes.

958
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,325
Please!
- Thank you!

959
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,397
Sameera!
- Yes, ma, am!

960
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,842
This is our brightest student,
Sameera.

961
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:11,507
This. - I know. Casanova!
The flower seller.

962
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:16,687
He is a friend of our board
member, Abhijit. - Okay.

963
01:28:17,225 --> 01:28:19,716
He wants to learn the
basic steps of Salsa.

964
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,097
Ust some basic knowledge.

965
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:26,362
It is a matter ofjust an hour or so.
Could you help him?

966
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:28,694
Sure. My pleasure. Let, s go.

967
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:30,029
Thank you!
- Sure.

968
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,365
Sir! This way.
- Okay.

969
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:35,643
Please!

970
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:39,207
Sir! Tell me. Have you
studied Salsa before?

971
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:42,276
It should look like I have studied.
That is what I want.

972
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,114
Within an hour?
- I, m not going to do Arangetram.

973
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:51,324
From a big flower garden you throw
a bit of flowers here. That is enough.

974
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:56,890
Sir! It is none of my business.
Due to curiosity I, m asking you.

975
01:28:57,265 --> 01:29:02,066
That Italian model Salomia,
why did you both separate?

976
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,829
Who said we are separated?
- I read it.

977
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:08,242
That you both separated and she
had depression due to that.

978
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,571
It is not her. It was Adriana.
Spanish model.

979
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:16,409
Adriana? She is beautiful.
She got married again. Isn, t it?

980
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:17,914
Yes. Husband is in the merchant navy.

981
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,519
He, ll be on land for only six months.
- Then...

982
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,249
How about moving on?
- Sure.

983
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:30,257
One step. This is good to do and see.
One romantic step. That, s all.

984
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:34,925
Sir! None of my business.
Why one single step?

985
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,933
Why these adjustments study?

986
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:40,604
Why're you spoiling the beauty of your eyes?
Why don, t you keep contact lenses?

987
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:43,603
Why have you tied up
this beautiful hair?

988
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,039
None of my business.

989
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:48,444
Come on.

990
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:25,609
Central

991
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,192
Wasn, t these photographs taken by you?
- Yes.

992
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:13,189
She is my fiancee.
Can you explain her presence in this?

993
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:15,867
It is not me who should explain that.

994
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:17,128
How dare you?

995
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:22,138
Arun! I have not even seen this guy.
He has manipulated this.

996
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,471
I, m going to sue you for
this crap. Okay?

997
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,704
Who is he?
- Casanova!

998
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,941
The face that comes into my camera
a maximum in this season.

999
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:39,351
From the day he lands in Dubai fathers,
brothers & husbands will have no peace.

1000
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,729
The girls who remain at home
till then will start going to...

1001
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:48,232
...tuitions, cooking class,
health club and shopping.

1002
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:53,566
On getting suspicious if you go and see,
there won, t be any such tuition centre.

1003
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:55,173
There won, t be any health club.

1004
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:58,402
Leave alone cooking class there
won, t be even a tea stall.

1005
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:05,913
When men investigate their whereabouts.
They, ll all come in the end to one place.

1006
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:10,518
In Grand Hyatt Suite No. 405.

1007
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,753
It is time.
- Coming.

1008
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,761
I, m a freelance photographer.

1009
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:23,927
When he is in Dubai to all my clients who run
magazines need only his gossips & photos.

1010
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:28,765
Then in this season these kinds
of gossips are usual.

1011
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:32,605
Arun! Why are
we hearing his lecture?

1012
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:34,781
I, ll sue this bloody fraud.

1013
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:37,280
Don, t worry.
As much as I know.

1014
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:40,613
More then two weeks the Casanova
never maintains any girl.

1015
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:45,118
With that calculation you
will expire by tomorrow.

1016
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:46,554
How dare you?

1017
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:50,729
Can you tell me where he is?
- Why do you want to see Arun?

1018
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:56,131
This week also I, m following his story.
Today is his grandpa, s death anniversary.

1019
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:59,306
Our Lady Cathedral.
The chances are he, ll be there.

1020
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:00,735
Excuse me.

1021
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:04,307
Let, s move.
- One second. I, ll get my bag.

1022
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:07,645
We are directly going
to Our Lady Cathedral.

1023
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:12,148
You must talk to him there. He must
not know that I, m there with you.

1024
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:15,320
But why?
Don, t you trust me?

1025
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:19,482
Arun! Those photos are bloody fake.
I swear on our love.

1026
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:22,663
That is your surety.
Let me also assure myself.

1027
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:28,157
Go and sit in the car.
I, ll come. Go.

1028
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:37,272
Go.

1029
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:44,708
Adi! Our Lady Cathedral.
Come with our men there.

1030
01:33:45,386 --> 01:33:48,378
Now.
I, m going to kill someone.

1031
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:07,140
Shall we go?
- Daddy! Who were they?

1032
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:10,208
His girlfriend was having an affair with
the Casanova. They are no one.

1033
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:12,879
I have told you many times
not to read all this.

1034
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:17,744
Father! I heard him telling on the
phone that he, ll kill someone.

1035
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:21,388
Let him do what he wants.
Why are you paying attention to all that?

1036
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:24,387
Come, let us go. Isn, t it time for the class?
- Yes. - Come.

1037
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:39,066
Are you going back?
- Yes. I had the morning shift.

1038
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,568
Can you drop me at the
All ladies Cathedral? - Sure.

1039
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:43,471
Thank you!

1040
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:55,580
Come.

1041
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:59,357
Arun!
Why are you doing this?

1042
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:03,261
As I told you go and
ask that guy. Okay?

1043
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:15,031
That man in the black blazer.
When I signal, you come.

1044
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:37,792
Autograph, please!
Sir, please!

1045
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,295
You.
- Sir! Autograph.

1046
01:35:45,873 --> 01:35:50,310
Which? Which college
are you studying in?

1047
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:51,307
New Indian.

1048
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:58,408
Thank you, sir!
- My pleasure.

1049
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:09,329
Hello!
- Yes. - I, m Nidhi.

1050
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,862
Hi! What can I do for you?

1051
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:23,335
I heard. Was it you?

1052
01:36:24,378 --> 01:36:27,779
I, m sorry. Actually that
is my girl friend. Calare.

1053
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:33,118
In her place they...
Sorry what is your name? - Nidhi!

1054
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:37,181
They pasted your photo.
I don, t give them interviews.

1055
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:38,187
It was a revenge for that.

1056
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:41,259
If you could co-operate,
we could move this issue legally.

1057
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:04,481
Of late the lovers can, t
be trusted.

1058
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,917
Good day, Mr. Casanova!
- Come on, come on.

1059
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:13,883
You introduce yourself and go.
Sameera, the Salsa dancer. Then?

1060
01:37:14,094 --> 01:37:14,719
Who are you?

1061
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:18,561
After knowing that you will
keep the trap. Isn, t it?

1062
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:23,396
I would have kept the trap before itself.
Only if you were slightly older.

1063
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:27,636
But you are too young for me.
Ust a kid.

1064
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:33,075
Let two more years go by.
I, ll spread a nice trap for you.

1065
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:36,409
What do you think my age is
that you are saying all this?

1066
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:40,920
You are scared that if you spend even
10 minutes with me you, ll fall for me.

1067
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:45,080
It is that age. You are scared
to have coffee with me.

1068
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,420
The age of yours is such.

1069
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:53,428
I, ll return back by day after tomorrow, s flight.
Tomorrow is my last day in Dubai.

1070
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:57,103
From evening 4 o, clock
I, ll be in Hotel Hyatt.

1071
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:58,771
In Suite Number 405.

1072
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:04,009
If you can trust yourself I, ll serve you
the best coffee in the world.

1073
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:29,395
Mr. Casanova!

1074
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:32,236
I, m not the girl you think.

1075
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:37,806
Be alone and have coffee on this
last evening at Dubai. Bye!

1076
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:51,824
Did you come early today?

1077
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:54,753
The class got over earlier today.

1078
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:58,829
What is it?
What happened?

1079
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,834
Are you not well?
- Nothing.

1080
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:03,901
Get me one coffee.

1081
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:31,087
Hello!
- Hi!

1082
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,892
Please! Come.

1083
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:40,198
Coffee?
- Sure.

1084
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:42,102
Cappuccino
- Okay.

1085
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:46,636
Send me two cappuccinos.

1086
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:49,881
Are you diabetic?
Do you have sugar? - No.

1087
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,219
Send some French pastries too.
Casanova style.

1088
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:01,217
There is a small change
in the travel plan.

1089
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:04,397
I, m returning back on the 8 o, clock
night flight. Are you happy?

1090
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:07,393
Very much. Dubai is saved.
- Come on.

1091
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:11,237
Sameera! - Yes.
- Help me a bit.

1092
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:16,504
My packing is not over as
it was sudden. Please come.

1093
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:23,080
I'll pack my clothes can you keep those
CD, s & books on the table in this suitcase?

1094
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:24,409
Come on, please!

1095
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:30,114
I have work so I have to go.
- I also have work.

1096
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:34,384
There also many girls waiting.

1097
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:40,433
There are lots of them waiting for me.
But there is no one to get my suitcase packed.

1098
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:44,532
That is my problem.
That is what no one knows.

1099
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:46,932
If you go now?
- Next year.

1100
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:51,344
By that time you must have
got married. Isn, t it?

1101
01:40:52,813 --> 01:41:02,449
That is possible. Whoever it may be,
he won, t have to test to make sure.

1102
01:41:02,656 --> 01:41:04,681
Excuse me! One second.

1103
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:07,286
Can you sit on top of this?
It is not closing.

1104
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:11,387
Please! Come on.
Come on. Yes.

1105
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:23,141
I don, t invite anyone.
They come by themselves.

1106
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:30,810
If I have invited anyone it is those
whom I want to see and talk to.

1107
01:41:31,685 --> 01:41:34,051
Those kinds of people are less.

1108
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:37,748
If you feel
I, m not a terrorist,

1109
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:42,652
I have to leave. Come on.
Shall we dance?

1110
01:41:56,343 --> 01:42:06,309
Central

1111
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:39,809
What shall I give you?

1112
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:58,327
Thank you, Mr. Casanova!
Have a nice time.

1113
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:01,502
My goodness.

1114
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:07,410
Will we ever meet?

1115
01:43:08,982 --> 01:43:13,419
Let someone come to hit you.
That time I, ll come to save you.

1116
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:29,734
Every year when I go back I leave
all the adventures of mine here.

1117
01:43:29,836 --> 01:43:41,179
That is usual.
But this time I, ll miss you.

1118
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:56,791
Next time when I come by chance if we
meet you, ll be permanently with me.

1119
01:43:58,131 --> 01:43:59,621
That is what my heart says.

1120
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:22,581
My God! Babala!
I, m coming to you, my dear.

1121
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:29,443
For you?
- No.

1122
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:34,450
Why? Okay, take that.
A lemon jelly for Lilly. - Thank you!

1123
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:40,153
Very, very strawberry for Sherry.

1124
01:47:31,378 --> 01:47:37,840
Hello! Mr. Casanova!
- Sameera! Salsa girl?

1125
01:47:38,051 --> 01:47:40,178
My God! I, m so sorry.

1126
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:43,518
You have totally changed.
Didn, t you have specs?

1127
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:46,248
You remembered that much.
Thank God!

1128
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,691
Did you come alone?
- With friends.

1129
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:52,929
No, boy friend.
- Where?

1130
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:59,364
Where is he?
The white tall guy.

1131
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:09,037
Good. Within a year
so much has happened.

1132
01:48:10,584 --> 01:48:12,882
Actually there were 2-3 people.

1133
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:16,320
Even though it was for two days
only you were also there.

1134
01:48:16,923 --> 01:48:19,391
From all that I had to select the best.

1135
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:20,560
Yes, of course.

1136
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:24,155
Casa!
- Coming.

1137
01:48:27,801 --> 01:48:29,325
When can I meet you?

1138
01:48:29,769 --> 01:48:32,829
Actually I, m very busy.

1139
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,734
One hour.

1140
01:48:35,275 --> 01:48:38,904
Like destined we met again.
You need not leave it half way.

1141
01:48:39,112 --> 01:48:40,579
Look you know.
- We must meet.

1142
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:49,244
Tomorrow 5 o, clock at the Swiss café.
The best coffee in the world. My number.

1143
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:00,191
What did he say?

1144
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:02,766
He didn, t even recognize me.

1145
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:05,699
They are like that. Today one,
tomorrow another.

1146
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:09,433
In between that Sameera.
What Sameera? You are just fooled.

1147
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,907
I, m not ready to get fooled like that.

1148
01:49:27,827 --> 01:49:31,456
Swiss coffee madam!
- Yes.

1149
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:50,814
Hello!

1150
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:53,983
Hello!

1151
01:49:56,289 --> 01:50:00,089
Sorry, Mr. Casanova!
A small change.

1152
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:07,894
Today I can, t come. I told you
about my boy friend Armaan.

1153
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:13,766
We have some other engagement.

1154
01:50:14,207 --> 01:50:17,176
So maybe some other time.

1155
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:23,344
Was I going to meet you today?

1156
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:32,515
I, m sorry. I forgot that.
I had some other work.

1157
01:50:32,726 --> 01:50:38,460
It is good that Sameera
also didn, t come. Okay, okay.

1158
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:43,862
See you then.
Have a nice time.

1159
01:51:10,096 --> 01:51:11,393
Where is he?

1160
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:32,813
Is Armaan a real character?
- Then? Am I a novelist?

1161
01:51:33,286 --> 01:51:34,583
To create a character.

1162
01:51:34,788 --> 01:51:36,915
Then why did you
make such a phone call?

1163
01:51:37,123 --> 01:51:40,092
Then why did you lie
that you hadn, t come.

1164
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:43,255
Is he just a friend?

1165
01:51:43,463 --> 01:51:48,264
You can say and no.
I have not made a decision.

1166
01:51:49,636 --> 01:51:52,264
You told about 2-3 other people.
Who are they?

1167
01:51:54,574 --> 01:52:00,171
Number one is onas. He is the trainer
at the health club. Great guy.

1168
01:52:00,413 --> 01:52:03,439
After two months there was
a small ego problem.

1169
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:08,210
Number two is Ram Shankar.
He is the assistant manager at Tulit.

1170
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:16,795
Plus Cavendish team, s hockey captain.
But he is a bit too old. Twenty nine.

1171
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,892
Come on.
- Yes.

1172
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:28,463
Now it is Armaan. The most
handsome guy I have seen.

1173
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:31,139
Last year when we met none
of these were there.

1174
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:32,470
It was long back.

1175
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:36,977
In one year lot of changes
come in every ones, lives.

1176
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:40,419
After saying good bye we
separated from the hotel.

1177
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:43,921
After that you must have
also met many females.

1178
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:48,324
British novelist.
Then other, s wives.

1179
01:52:51,297 --> 01:52:52,093
Please!

1180
01:52:55,001 --> 01:52:57,993
Are you free now?
- If I, m?

1181
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,107
You can come to room.

1182
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:07,842
Best coffee in the world.
- Sure. Please! - Okay.

1183
01:53:13,887 --> 01:53:16,014
For the next two hours no guests
and no phone calls.

1184
01:53:16,222 --> 01:53:17,689
Mama miya!

1185
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:32,363
Lavender flowers, honey.

1186
01:53:34,374 --> 01:53:37,138
It is from Casanova, s own flower garden.

1187
01:53:37,410 --> 01:53:38,536
Thank you!

1188
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:51,914
I have not seen flower fields at all.
- Really? Then come.

1189
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:57,888
Come on.
I, ll show you. Come.

1190
01:54:02,068 --> 01:54:12,034
Central

1191
01:54:24,624 --> 01:54:26,023
Come in.

1192
01:54:35,802 --> 01:54:36,769
Sit down.

1193
01:54:47,213 --> 01:54:50,273
Kajuraho. It is part of Indian culture.

1194
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:52,949
But it is the Indians who feel
maximum ashamed seeing this.

1195
01:54:53,486 --> 01:54:55,454
What else other than hypocrisy?

1196
01:54:58,825 --> 01:54:59,883
The honey of this?

1197
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:02,960
No. This comes under orchid species.

1198
01:55:03,496 --> 01:55:05,464
The favorite of perfume manufacturers.

1199
01:55:05,665 --> 01:55:07,132
Beautiful.

1200
01:55:08,668 --> 01:55:12,297
Please!
- Thank you!

1201
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:18,808
It is the flower field here.
Rose Mary.

1202
01:55:19,345 --> 01:55:23,975
After the first kiss a man
is supposed to give a lady.

1203
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:27,812
Then this one field will not
be enough for you.

1204
01:55:28,021 --> 01:55:29,579
Good one.

1205
01:55:40,033 --> 01:55:42,501
If I ask you one thing,
will you mistake me?

1206
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:44,601
What is it?

1207
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:53,711
First I must know. Else after asking if
you mistake me, it, ll be very boring.

1208
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:57,107
Ask me.

1209
01:56:04,657 --> 01:56:06,852
Have you had a first kiss like that?

1210
01:56:11,064 --> 01:56:17,196
Yes.
- Who was it?

1211
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:24,104
Sakreya!
- Sakreya! Boy friend?

1212
01:56:25,912 --> 01:56:28,745
You can say like that.
He is my father.

1213
01:56:31,684 --> 01:56:40,217
You are unbelievable.
One second, one second.

1214
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:50,397
Shall I get the honey of
some more flowers?

1215
01:56:50,603 --> 01:56:53,572
It is little stronger.
I, ll get it for you.

1216
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:05,779
Mr. Casanova!
- Yes.

1217
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:08,017
Do you want me?

1218
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:13,588
Good day, Mr. Casanova!

1219
01:57:49,328 --> 01:57:52,957
Sir! Don, t create a commotion
or break the glass.

1220
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:57,227
I found out. She has gone to
practice Salsa with that boy.

1221
01:57:59,605 --> 01:58:01,630
Where is her land number?
- For what?

1222
01:58:01,841 --> 01:58:03,968
Where is her land number?

1223
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:07,976
Here it is.

1224
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:12,482
Why are you calling?

1225
01:58:12,785 --> 01:58:14,309
On this night.
- Hello!

1226
01:58:15,288 --> 01:58:16,983
Isn, t Sameera there?
- No.

1227
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:20,885
No? The time is 8.30.
- Who are you?

1228
01:58:21,094 --> 01:58:23,995
You must have responsibility when you
are the father of a grownup girl.

1229
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:30,559
Else when a grownup girl
behaves like not grown...

1230
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:33,933
It is our duty as a grownup
person to explain to her.

1231
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:36,335
Responsibility.
- Responsibility.

1232
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:39,337
Grownup parents should
have that.

1233
01:58:39,712 --> 01:58:43,773
Put down the phone and go.
- That is okay.

1234
01:58:43,983 --> 01:58:47,510
But at last when everything gets
out of hand don, t call me.

1235
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:51,784
Is it again switched off?
- What is this, sir?

1236
01:58:51,991 --> 01:58:54,516
You were not like this in
the case of Gabriela.

1237
01:58:54,727 --> 01:58:56,354
Is this like that?

1238
01:58:58,064 --> 01:59:00,760
What a sound?
Isn, t it like that?

1239
01:59:03,402 --> 01:59:09,807
Not like that.
She is not like any other girl.

1240
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:21,886
She is disturbing me a lot.
She is not leaving my heart.

1241
01:59:22,088 --> 01:59:23,885
She is following me.

1242
01:59:25,424 --> 01:59:31,556
Mostly it starts with a
holiday and ends there.

1243
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:37,727
I thought this also is like that only.
But this time the holiday is too long.

1244
01:59:38,738 --> 01:59:41,730
I feel it is not going to end.
It is that lengthy.

1245
01:59:41,941 --> 01:59:43,932
Is it this which is talking?

1246
01:59:45,545 --> 01:59:48,571
If not like that,
I, m the most happiest person in that.

1247
01:59:53,286 --> 01:59:55,754
Tomorrow you call her.
Talk to her.

1248
01:59:57,423 --> 01:59:58,583
But will she?

1249
01:59:58,791 --> 02:00:02,249
She, ll come. You treated
her like any other girl.

1250
02:00:02,461 --> 02:00:07,296
That is why she went away.
You call from your heart. She, ll come.

1251
02:00:19,946 --> 02:00:22,972
I thought you won, t come.
- Why?

1252
02:00:23,983 --> 02:00:27,441
I felt like that.
Shall I ask you a personal matter?

1253
02:00:28,654 --> 02:00:30,713
That boy Armaan.
- Yes.

1254
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:35,684
You said you had not taken
a decision about him.

1255
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:38,390
It is 2-3 days since then.

1256
02:00:39,265 --> 02:00:41,460
If in the middle of this
I have taken a decision?

1257
02:00:42,735 --> 02:00:45,465
Don, t worry. If the decision is yes,

1258
02:00:45,771 --> 02:00:50,470
the contract for the marriage flowers
will be given to you. Isn, t it enough?

1259
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:53,408
The place of destination
is about to come.

1260
02:01:03,522 --> 02:01:05,581
Casa!
- Hi!

1261
02:01:05,858 --> 02:01:08,827
This is the first time.
- In a stud farm?

1262
02:01:09,028 --> 02:01:13,158
No, in a stud farm where the owner keeps
his lovers to look after the horses.

1263
02:01:14,533 --> 02:01:16,728
This is Armaan, s graduation day.

1264
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:18,400
Check out his new car.

1265
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,008
This is the girl he is going to marry.

1266
02:01:23,209 --> 02:01:24,335
She is my friend.

1267
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:29,343
That day you said I, m just a kid.

1268
02:01:30,416 --> 02:01:35,183
Then you can expect a lot of these
kinds ofjokes in the future also.

1269
02:01:36,322 --> 02:01:37,516
Careful.

1270
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:42,921
Thinking of an Armaan you
spent one sleepless night.

1271
02:01:44,096 --> 02:01:48,863
In the next edition of Gossip Magazine
who will be the partner?

1272
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:53,196
You have not remained tensed up
thinking about it. That too never.

1273
02:01:59,979 --> 02:02:02,379
Excuse me!
- Yes.

1274
02:02:06,185 --> 02:02:09,882
Can you spare 10 minutes?
- Sure.

1275
02:02:10,523 --> 02:02:11,888
Please!
- Thank you!

1276
02:02:13,092 --> 02:02:16,994
Even if we don, t know each other
personally I know about you.

1277
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:20,729
By saying that I know you in
that all details are included.

1278
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:25,230
From the date of birth
to your Suite No. 405.

1279
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:28,466
Sometimes much more than that.

1280
02:02:31,277 --> 02:02:36,180
Earlier I used to feel jealous
seeing your variety of lovers.

1281
02:02:36,882 --> 02:02:38,315
Then I started hating it

1282
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:43,921
when I saw the helplessness
of relatives and sorrow.

1283
02:02:44,557 --> 02:02:51,258
Knowing everything from your face
that smile never went away.

1284
02:02:52,465 --> 02:02:54,092
What are you trying to?

1285
02:02:54,700 --> 02:03:03,938
The list of girls are just prey to you.
In other bio data it is a sister or a daughter.

1286
02:03:06,145 --> 02:03:08,875
Do not see this as such
a father, s sentiment.

1287
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:12,608
Please! Keep Sameera out of your life.

1288
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:27,059
Sir! I, m not defending any thing.

1289
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:32,134
But from the last few days in any of your
client, s magazine Casanova was not there.

1290
02:03:32,338 --> 02:03:36,798
I, m sure of that.
I, m sure it won, t be there.

1291
02:03:38,744 --> 02:03:44,205
In the bio-data Sameera is not
one among a lot of females.

1292
02:03:58,798 --> 02:04:03,497
We talked about a lot of things.
We talked about both of us.

1293
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:11,172
We talked about our backgrounds.
About our flashbacks, we talked.

1294
02:04:11,977 --> 02:04:17,677
When can we meet to talk about
that which we have not talked?

1295
02:04:21,954 --> 02:04:23,421
I, m not forcing you.

1296
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:27,654
If you are interested
in talking about that.

1297
02:04:29,161 --> 02:04:32,858
Tomorrow 5 o, clock at the
Empire Tower for a coffee.

1298
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:37,698
The best coffee in the world.

1299
02:04:57,723 --> 02:05:07,689
Central

1300
02:05:25,251 --> 02:05:26,047
Excuse me!
- Yes, sir!

1301
02:05:26,252 --> 02:05:28,482
What is the time?
- 5 o, clock.

1302
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:07,523
Taxi!

1303
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:49,827
That day you said
I, m just a kid.

1304
02:06:50,035 --> 02:06:54,438
Then you can expect a lot of these
kinds ofjokes in the future also.

1305
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:58,667
Sorry, Mr. Casanova!
I, ll not marry you.

1306
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,679
No. Yes.

1307
02:07:02,881 --> 02:07:04,746
Yes, I love you.

1308
02:07:06,652 --> 02:07:09,416
I, ll marry you. Yes.

1309
02:07:21,834 --> 02:07:22,892
Freeze!

1310
02:07:30,342 --> 02:07:31,366
Don, t move.

1311
02:07:39,918 --> 02:07:40,577
Don, t move.

1312
02:10:34,226 --> 02:10:36,854
The robber, s attack has
scared the city.

1313
02:10:37,062 --> 02:10:39,428
Today evening at the Sheik
Palace there was a robbery.

1314
02:10:39,631 --> 02:10:44,398
After that from a gang of five one
was shot dead while trying to escape.

1315
02:10:44,603 --> 02:10:47,197
There were onlookers around
who were seeing this

1316
02:10:47,406 --> 02:10:50,068
A guy took this photo
in his mobile.

1317
02:10:50,742 --> 02:10:53,506
It was a girl who got killed.
She looked like 22 years of age.

1318
02:10:53,712 --> 02:10:56,647
Her name and details
have been kept a secret.

1319
02:10:56,849 --> 02:11:02,253
Police were following that gang.
One of the gangsters shot his partner.

1320
02:11:02,454 --> 02:11:06,618
He must have done this as police should not
get hold of any gang member alive.

1321
02:11:06,825 --> 02:11:07,757
That is what the police suspect.

1322
02:11:08,126 --> 02:11:10,458
Name.
- Sacreya!

1323
02:11:10,662 --> 02:11:12,994
Not yours, fool.
Your daughters.

1324
02:11:14,166 --> 02:11:14,655
Sameera!

1325
02:11:14,867 --> 02:11:16,562
Is she a student?

1326
02:11:16,768 --> 02:11:20,295
Yes, she is graduating
in English literature.

1327
02:11:20,505 --> 02:11:22,336
What was she?

1328
02:11:24,643 --> 02:11:27,134
This is the stuff we found
from your living room.

1329
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:30,941
From your daughter, s college cubicle.
From her Salsa school.

1330
02:11:31,149 --> 02:11:34,414
Detailed plan of robbery
including the palace theft.

1331
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,451
This happened yesterday evening.

1332
02:11:36,655 --> 02:11:40,091
How, sir? Would you explain this?
- I don, t know.

1333
02:11:40,292 --> 02:11:43,955
Somebody is playing a dirty game.
- Please cooperate.

1334
02:11:44,162 --> 02:11:47,928
At that particular spot and time
your daughter came there.

1335
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:50,933
How did all these come in her
usual places she goes to?

1336
02:11:52,771 --> 02:11:57,333
If you are going to say it is coincidence,
I, ll say that it is an unbelievable.

1337
02:11:57,542 --> 02:12:01,205
All that I know is that
my child is innocent.

1338
02:12:01,413 --> 02:12:03,176
He is getting emotional.

1339
02:12:04,816 --> 02:12:08,377
Mr. Sacreya what you said
is not enough to convince us.

1340
02:12:08,587 --> 02:12:09,849
You won, t believe it.

1341
02:12:10,055 --> 02:12:12,421
It was an intelligent game
which someone played.

1342
02:12:12,624 --> 02:12:14,285
It is believable to you.

1343
02:12:14,493 --> 02:12:17,826
I, m her father who was
with her for 22 years.

1344
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:20,294
My word is unbelievable,
coincidence.

1345
02:12:20,899 --> 02:12:22,730
Emotional stupidity.

1346
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:27,896
Give him a cup of coffee.
I, ll be right back.

1347
02:12:29,875 --> 02:12:31,069
I have all the right to know.

1348
02:12:31,276 --> 02:12:32,903
Don, t shout. Okay?

1349
02:12:35,747 --> 02:12:36,975
What is happening there?

1350
02:12:38,116 --> 02:12:39,481
He is being a nuisance, sir.

1351
02:12:39,685 --> 02:12:42,017
Sir! I want to know
the details of the shoot-out.

1352
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:43,881
Which happened yesterday?
- Who let you in?

1353
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,489
I told, no media inside.
- I, m not from the media, sir.

1354
02:12:46,692 --> 02:12:47,317
Who ever you are?

1355
02:12:47,492 --> 02:12:49,756
We are not entertaining public
in this office right now.

1356
02:12:49,962 --> 02:12:51,452
You have to entertain me,

1357
02:12:51,697 --> 02:12:54,495
sir! I, m here to lodge a complaint
about a four member gang.

1358
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:56,361
I want to meet the
concerned officer.

1359
02:12:56,568 --> 02:12:57,762
There are hundreds
of complaints against them.

1360
02:12:58,003 --> 02:13:00,335
And we have no rights
to treat your suspicion.

1361
02:13:00,572 --> 02:13:01,368
Sir! Can I have a minute?
- Wait.

1362
02:13:01,573 --> 02:13:02,437
Sir!
- No.

1363
02:13:02,941 --> 02:13:04,966
Please behave yourself
and clear him out.

1364
02:13:05,177 --> 02:13:06,269
Please, sir!

1365
02:13:08,714 --> 02:13:12,309
The investigation is around
Sameera Sacreya.

1366
02:13:12,517 --> 02:13:16,112
While she was escaping with other four,
this incident took place in Empire Tower.

1367
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:17,379
Surprising to know.

1368
02:13:17,589 --> 02:13:22,390
That Sameera Sacreya was an English
literature student was found shot dead.

1369
02:13:22,594 --> 02:13:28,157
Yesterday in front of the empire tower.
The interpol is taking charge...

1370
02:13:28,367 --> 02:13:31,029
The investigation is
proceeding around her.

1371
02:13:43,982 --> 02:13:44,971
You need not stand.

1372
02:13:45,984 --> 02:13:47,975
Go away.
- Sir!

1373
02:13:54,826 --> 02:13:56,316
Ust leave I say.

1374
02:13:57,429 --> 02:14:01,263
In the company of four criminals
she also became a criminal.

1375
02:14:01,466 --> 02:14:02,433
That is enough.

1376
02:14:02,634 --> 02:14:09,540
If she is connected with your name,
then that will become a new gossip here.

1377
02:14:09,741 --> 02:14:12,107
Then her image will become another.

1378
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:17,312
Please!
Please! Go away.

1379
02:14:28,293 --> 02:14:38,259
Central

1380
02:14:42,507 --> 02:14:43,474
Sameera Sacreya was a criminal.
She was shot dead.

1381
02:14:43,675 --> 02:14:46,200
The police has handed over
the investigation to the Interpol.

1382
02:15:10,035 --> 02:15:11,332
Casanova!

1383
02:15:12,104 --> 02:15:16,234
A name given by others.
I drew that in real life.

1384
02:15:16,942 --> 02:15:22,073
First of all she was also one amongst
the winners of the game.

1385
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:25,479
But in the end she defeated me.

1386
02:15:27,619 --> 02:15:30,383
The first girl whom Casanova loved.

1387
02:15:32,257 --> 02:15:33,588
The last one also.

1388
02:15:36,328 --> 02:15:39,855
After one year the monastery theft.

1389
02:15:40,365 --> 02:15:43,129
It was that news which
made me reach Dubai.

1390
02:15:43,335 --> 02:15:45,394
It was not a wedding invitation.

1391
02:15:47,472 --> 02:15:50,669
The day I arrived
I got them in my hand.

1392
02:15:50,876 --> 02:15:52,741
Luck was with me.

1393
02:15:52,944 --> 02:15:55,936
I also waited with
a bigger plan than theirs.

1394
02:15:56,815 --> 02:16:01,218
A sensational live telecast
which was high in time rating.

1395
02:16:01,586 --> 02:16:05,022
The trial for a theft,
its defeat, surrender.

1396
02:16:05,223 --> 02:16:08,386
That was the sequence in which
I wanted to take my revenge.

1397
02:16:09,494 --> 02:16:12,622
But again fate played
hide and seek.

1398
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:16,790
It tried topsoil my calculation.
I was not ready to lose.

1399
02:16:17,502 --> 02:16:20,232
The dreams that I once saw
I tried to show them.

1400
02:16:21,907 --> 02:16:23,841
I showed its color.

1401
02:16:24,042 --> 02:16:27,443
The happiness that once
I got I gave them as charity.

1402
02:16:29,014 --> 02:16:32,313
The media made Sameera a criminal.
In that same media I made them stars.

1403
02:16:32,517 --> 02:16:40,253
I played a game. To drop them
from that high of happiness.

1404
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:45,728
The pain of falling that I went through,
they must also feel once.

1405
02:16:46,464 --> 02:16:50,230
The numbness that I still feel
they should also feel.

1406
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:53,829
You can call it as set right
my mistake or pay back.

1407
02:16:54,039 --> 02:16:56,803
Whoever may remove Ann Mary.

1408
02:16:57,008 --> 02:16:59,306
But she, ll get into one of
the world class professional life.

1409
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:02,571
It, ll be a life that she wishes for.
That is my promise.

1410
02:17:03,748 --> 02:17:05,716
Two of them I left alone.
That was purposely done.

1411
02:17:05,917 --> 02:17:08,044
The one with love and
another without love.

1412
02:17:08,253 --> 02:17:10,619
That was to create the fight which will
come when they come together.

1413
02:17:10,822 --> 02:17:11,686
For their destruction.

1414
02:17:11,890 --> 02:17:15,826
But, sir! Interpol had doubts
about our programme.

1415
02:17:16,027 --> 02:17:19,394
I have helped them.
I didn, t know anything.

1416
02:17:19,598 --> 02:17:20,758
It, s alright Rema.

1417
02:17:20,966 --> 02:17:23,560
I have the evidence that
the Interpol needs.

1418
02:17:23,768 --> 02:17:25,929
When the time is right
they, ll find it.

1419
02:17:26,371 --> 02:17:29,829
But before the Interpol and
the police they are mine.

1420
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:34,341
I must know among those
four who killed Sameera?

1421
02:17:34,546 --> 02:17:37,037
Why she was made
one amongst them?

1422
02:17:38,316 --> 02:17:45,119
Then the story which media and papers
will have to be rewritten by them.

1423
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:55,530
No mean task for an Indian boy.
- Right.

1424
02:17:56,034 --> 02:17:59,162
I want them all.
Every tape of this series.

1425
02:17:59,371 --> 02:18:03,398
Everyone behind the screen
and on the screen.

1426
02:18:13,051 --> 02:18:13,915
Interpol!

1427
02:18:26,498 --> 02:18:27,760
We have broken him, sir.

1428
02:18:30,101 --> 02:18:30,692
No.

1429
02:18:53,758 --> 02:18:55,453
How many years you
have been living here?

1430
02:18:55,627 --> 02:18:57,492
We have been here
for seven years.

1431
02:18:57,729 --> 02:18:59,993
Is he your only son?
- Yes.

1432
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:03,367
Take that.

1433
02:19:22,053 --> 02:19:23,748
Mr. Alaxe oshua!
- Yes.

1434
02:19:23,955 --> 02:19:25,422
We need to search your place.

1435
02:20:10,268 --> 02:20:11,098
Catch him!

1436
02:20:38,663 --> 02:20:48,629
Central

1437
02:21:24,476 --> 02:21:27,502
Sir! We have him.
He is making a phone call.

1438
02:21:28,746 --> 02:21:31,476
Salim! Escape and reach Hotel
Hollywood tomorrow morning.

1439
02:21:31,683 --> 02:21:34,618
Inform Kiran and Arjun.
Then destroy your mobile.

1440
02:21:58,610 --> 02:21:59,736
Back to London.

1441
02:21:59,944 --> 02:22:02,071
This ticket has been taken from
an emergency quota.

1442
02:22:02,313 --> 02:22:03,371
Why are you returning
in a hurry?

1443
02:22:03,581 --> 02:22:07,984
Casanova, s eternal spring.
I, m the head of all the branches.

1444
02:22:09,254 --> 02:22:12,781
If there is emergency work at one office
I have to go over there.

1445
02:22:13,358 --> 02:22:14,256
So I, m going back.

1446
02:22:14,459 --> 02:22:17,223
Where is Casanova now?
- I don, t know.

1447
02:22:17,428 --> 02:22:21,558
Even though I, m his secretary I don, t
ask about his personal matters.

1448
02:22:21,766 --> 02:22:23,097
He also doesn, t tell me.

1449
02:22:23,301 --> 02:22:26,600
And about that programme.
You can, t telecast that any more.

1450
02:22:26,804 --> 02:22:28,931
No programme can be
stopped just like that.

1451
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:32,166
Especially a programme that is
number one in time rating.

1452
02:22:32,877 --> 02:22:36,813
A program that creates social unrest
can only be stopped like that legally.

1453
02:22:37,015 --> 02:22:38,710
That is the broadcasting rules.

1454
02:22:38,917 --> 02:22:42,353
No. I don, t know about Arjun, s past.

1455
02:22:42,554 --> 02:22:44,249
I didn, t have the interest
to even know it.

1456
02:22:45,089 --> 02:22:48,456
Romance was just a play
for that programme.

1457
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:50,992
And where is Kiran now?
- I don, t know.

1458
02:22:51,195 --> 02:22:52,162
Don, t you have any interaction?

1459
02:22:52,363 --> 02:22:54,854
Not even a phone call?
- No.

1460
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:58,833
Have you ever seen these two?
- No.

1461
02:23:00,672 --> 02:23:01,366
No.

1462
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:06,299
This girl?
- No. No.

1463
02:23:07,312 --> 02:23:08,973
You maybe able to help us here.

1464
02:23:11,215 --> 02:23:16,482
Sameera is my daughter?
- Who was Casanova to her?

1465
02:23:16,688 --> 02:23:19,054
They were in love.

1466
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:27,357
One of these four has killed Sameera.
They are missing now.

1467
02:23:27,565 --> 02:23:28,623
Casanova too.

1468
02:23:29,901 --> 02:23:34,065
If Kiran or Arjun try to contact you,
inform us immediately.

1469
02:23:34,272 --> 02:23:38,140
Getting caught by us is safer than
getting caught by Casanova.

1470
02:23:39,744 --> 02:23:40,904
I hope you get me.

1471
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:47,674
So tomorrow is the marriage.
One more excitement is waiting for us.

1472
02:23:47,885 --> 02:23:52,447
The latest calling on Sakhiya.
The latest episode of Fall In Love.

1473
02:23:52,657 --> 02:23:54,989
Tomorrow at 9 AM.

1474
02:23:55,827 --> 02:23:59,490
We must follow Sakhiya
from the next hour.

1475
02:23:59,697 --> 02:24:03,497
I, m sure Casanova is planning
something very big.

1476
02:24:03,701 --> 02:24:07,159
Whatever it is the programme
should not go on air.

1477
02:24:07,405 --> 02:24:08,895
Got it?
- Yes. Sir!

1478
02:24:32,296 --> 02:24:34,730
Hello! I, m Sister Margaret.

1479
02:24:46,277 --> 02:24:47,369
I, m leaving.

1480
02:24:48,413 --> 02:24:51,143
I knew some day I, ll have
to run away like this.

1481
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:53,817
I wanted to tell that
to you many times.

1482
02:24:54,018 --> 02:24:57,215
But I was scared you might
leave me after knowing that.

1483
02:24:57,422 --> 02:25:01,017
For the best days
of my life Thanks!

1484
02:25:06,731 --> 02:25:08,062
The police had called me.

1485
02:25:16,107 --> 02:25:17,165
Who is Sameera?

1486
02:25:19,143 --> 02:25:22,408
In the murderer, s list
you were also there.

1487
02:25:23,081 --> 02:25:26,573
Then in Sameera, s photo
her lover was also there.

1488
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:30,777
You, ll know him also.
Casanova.

1489
02:25:32,423 --> 02:25:35,859
It is not only from the police
that you have to escape.

1490
02:25:46,471 --> 02:25:49,998
The one you are trying to
reach is out of range.

1491
02:25:57,482 --> 02:26:00,815
I, m in a hurry. I have to leave.
- Kiran!

1492
02:26:02,487 --> 02:26:03,317
Take care.
- Yea!

1493
02:26:34,919 --> 02:26:36,853
Kiran!
- Will come.

1494
02:26:38,222 --> 02:26:39,883
There is no time to think.

1495
02:26:40,091 --> 02:26:41,991
We four must not go
in four directions.

1496
02:26:42,193 --> 02:26:45,094
We must move together.
We must escape together.

1497
02:26:45,296 --> 02:26:48,891
There are some unknown
traps around us.

1498
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:52,866
That sword.
Police found it from my apartment.

1499
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:59,202
Whoever escaped with that on that day,
that 5th guy is behind us.

1500
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:02,174
But we can, t fall for any
master plan of others.

1501
02:27:03,381 --> 02:27:05,178
We are not petty thieves.

1502
02:27:06,717 --> 02:27:09,277
We, ll escape without a trace.

1503
02:27:09,754 --> 02:27:11,847
Arjun! Call Kiran.

1504
02:28:09,113 --> 02:28:19,079
Central

1505
02:29:00,965 --> 02:29:02,865
We got him.

1506
02:29:03,067 --> 02:29:05,160
Take him, Take him down.

1507
02:29:15,346 --> 02:29:16,904
Move fast. Move fast.

1508
02:29:18,449 --> 02:29:21,009
Go. Go...
Faster, faster. This way.

1509
02:30:13,938 --> 02:30:16,031
Ump...

1510
02:32:25,136 --> 02:32:26,228
All forces on alert.

1511
02:32:26,437 --> 02:32:28,098
Unit 1 cover Highway Number 23.

1512
02:32:28,305 --> 02:32:30,830
Unit 2 to Hangbridge.
To provide cover.

1513
02:32:31,041 --> 02:32:33,942
Chief! Arjun and Kiran caught.
Stationed at old airport road.

1514
02:32:34,145 --> 02:32:36,670
We are taking them to you.
- I don, t want to hear anything.

1515
02:32:36,881 --> 02:32:40,044
They have fooled the Interpol
for bloody three years.

1516
02:32:40,251 --> 02:32:42,412
Don, t bring them back.
Finish them.

1517
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:44,284
Yes, sir!

1518
02:32:46,157 --> 02:32:47,624
Come out, come out.

1519
02:32:53,664 --> 02:32:54,528
Run.

1520
02:32:56,333 --> 02:32:57,129
Run.

1521
02:33:18,856 --> 02:33:20,255
Good morning, Dubai.

1522
02:33:21,859 --> 02:33:24,657
Welcome to this special episode
of Fall In Love.

1523
02:33:24,862 --> 02:33:29,856
We are proudly presenting
Arjun, Kiran and Alaxe.

1524
02:33:30,067 --> 02:33:32,968
What the hell is happening?
- We have no clue, sir.

1525
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:34,432
It is a direct satellite gathering.

1526
02:33:34,638 --> 02:33:35,605
Ahmed! Come in.
- Tell me, sir!

1527
02:33:35,806 --> 02:33:38,673
Yea! Search the channel.
Yes, let, s move.

1528
02:33:38,876 --> 02:33:41,003
Search every corner of the
building. - Yes, sir!

1529
02:33:41,212 --> 02:33:42,941
Search every corner
of the building

1530
02:33:43,113 --> 02:33:44,205
It can be anywhere.

1531
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:46,245
Somebody from the channel
is helping him.

1532
02:33:46,584 --> 02:33:48,745
From somewhere.
- Who?

1533
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:51,244
Introduce yourself precisely.

1534
02:33:53,157 --> 02:33:54,249
All three of you.

1535
02:33:59,496 --> 02:34:04,490
I, m the one in the gang for whom Interpol
is searching for last one and a half years.

1536
02:34:05,336 --> 02:34:06,200
Arjun!

1537
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:10,702
Kiran!

1538
02:34:12,276 --> 02:34:13,675
One among the four.

1539
02:34:13,877 --> 02:34:16,846
Partner in the big robberies.

1540
02:34:17,047 --> 02:34:18,275
Now your turn.

1541
02:34:20,851 --> 02:34:22,614
Alaxe!
- No, no.

1542
02:34:23,887 --> 02:34:27,050
Like these two with all details.

1543
02:34:28,792 --> 02:34:29,588
Come on.

1544
02:34:33,230 --> 02:34:34,322
Speak up.

1545
02:34:36,166 --> 02:34:37,963
The one who was with
these people in everything.

1546
02:34:38,869 --> 02:34:40,393
Where is the fourth one?

1547
02:34:41,272 --> 02:34:42,330
Salim!

1548
02:34:44,308 --> 02:34:48,972
Unfortunately one hour before
the police found his body.

1549
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:53,411
We got it, sir!

1550
02:34:55,019 --> 02:34:57,351
Alert the entire force and move.

1551
02:35:00,357 --> 02:35:01,756
Now speak about Henna.

1552
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:04,757
Do you love her?

1553
02:35:06,563 --> 02:35:07,552
Answer me.

1554
02:35:11,802 --> 02:35:12,769
Yes.

1555
02:35:14,571 --> 02:35:18,940
How about you, Kiran?
Do you miss Ann Mary?

1556
02:35:32,656 --> 02:35:34,283
Sameera Sacreya!

1557
02:35:36,327 --> 02:35:38,591
In the police records
the fifth partner.

1558
02:35:39,530 --> 02:35:41,361
The criminal whom the
media enjoyed.

1559
02:35:42,633 --> 02:35:46,125
You must introduce Sameera
Sacreya to the viewers.

1560
02:35:51,442 --> 02:35:54,434
In a police encounter she got caught
in the middle unknowingly.

1561
02:35:54,645 --> 02:35:56,306
She was not with us.

1562
02:35:58,782 --> 02:35:59,976
Who killed her?

1563
02:36:07,191 --> 02:36:08,317
Who amongst you?

1564
02:36:17,701 --> 02:36:18,633
Explain.

1565
02:36:26,643 --> 02:36:27,507
Come on.

1566
02:36:27,945 --> 02:36:31,073
A palace theft that took
place one year before.

1567
02:36:31,448 --> 02:36:34,849
Unexpectedly there
was a police encounter.

1568
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:49,656
Central

1569
02:37:00,144 --> 02:37:02,442
I shot her thinking that
she was one of the three.

1570
02:37:02,646 --> 02:37:07,208
If one gets caught,
it, ll be the way to all the others.

1571
02:37:07,951 --> 02:37:09,441
That is why I shot.

1572
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:14,123
She was shot by the gang
near the Empire Tower.

1573
02:37:14,324 --> 02:37:16,724
It was a 22 year old female.

1574
02:37:16,927 --> 02:37:18,121
Hey... That is Sameera.

1575
02:37:18,328 --> 02:37:20,125
Who?
- I know her.

1576
02:37:38,315 --> 02:37:39,407
Mr. Sacreya!

1577
02:37:39,616 --> 02:37:41,345
We need to search your place.

1578
02:37:42,853 --> 02:37:44,081
Arjun! Move.

1579
02:37:47,758 --> 02:37:49,419
He was to win the game through me.

1580
02:37:50,127 --> 02:37:51,685
I was made to do in spite of my refusing.

1581
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:54,930
None of the decisions were ours.

1582
02:37:55,132 --> 02:37:58,693
We believed thinking
it is the safe way.

1583
02:37:58,902 --> 02:38:01,735
But yes we were also in it.

1584
02:38:07,611 --> 02:38:08,839
Why was that?

1585
02:38:09,046 --> 02:38:10,513
To divert the attention
of the police.

1586
02:38:11,849 --> 02:38:20,188
If there was any loopholes or mistakes
I didn, t want the police to know.

1587
02:38:20,390 --> 02:38:25,555
All the suspicion and the media
attention turned to Sameera.

1588
02:38:25,896 --> 02:38:29,730
Not even once you thought
who all it, ll hurt.

1589
02:38:30,234 --> 02:38:33,328
Then the evidence
which no one noticed.

1590
02:38:33,537 --> 02:38:35,129
You never thought
you, ll be followed.

1591
02:41:03,854 --> 02:41:09,952
As long as this city is there,
I, ll be waiting for you with those unsaid words.

1592
02:41:15,032 --> 02:41:30,403
I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

1593
02:42:10,821 --> 02:42:13,381
"Hey, lt, s already Saturday.
