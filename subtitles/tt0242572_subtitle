1
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:03,290
Like to give charity

2
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:06,293
Anger can be reduced;

3
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:09,796
Do whatever you can;

4
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:12,799
Don't stop giving;

5
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,338
Don't be hurry!

6
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,305
Brother! Give me;

7
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:19,806
I will give you all

8
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:23,310
When will the war end Major?

9
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:28,815
What for is this war?

10
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,817
Should not ask questions?

11
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,819
If country asks
you will have to go

12
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:35,942
Lip and eyelid are winking;

13
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:37,444
It is not skirt, it is gown;

14
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:45,451
Lip movement was left;
Manohara teach her;

15
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:46,953
How long I told you, bring soon

16
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:48,455
It is coming no?
Why are you shouting?

17
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:51,958
Lip and eyelid

18
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:53,960
By giving the name
Tamilselvi to a Punjabi girl;

19
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:55,462
They are torturing me.

20
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,474
Sir the hero has come.

21
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,479
Not hero, your father
has come from New York.

22
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,485
Mano! Your father has come;

23
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,986
Why did he come?

24
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,488
Some one go and hold it;

25
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,489
What dad?
Did I send you to America for this?

26
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:25,491
You could have studied
Engineering no?

27
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:27,994
Leaving that he has
come to take cinema;

28
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:29,996
If you had taken care of our factory,

29
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,499
There could have been
500 to 600 persons working under you;

30
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:39,005
Something nasty,
all are same;

31
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,007
Your father's partner's
daughter Swetha

32
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,509
Is coming from America;

33
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,010
Come let us go and receive her;

34
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:45,512
I can't come mom,
there is work no?

35
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:47,513
What big work is there?
You start:

36
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:49,515
Who is director Raja here?

37
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,017
Call him.

38
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:52,519
What are you doing dad?
This is not your company.

39
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:54,520
This is my shooting spot;
You start please;

40
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,022
You go home please;

41
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,024
Some how you correct Swetha
and keep her in line;

42
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,026
Do you understand?
Ok.

43
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:04,019
If you marry her,
you will get the company also;

44
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:05,532
I don't want marriage and company;

45
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,033
Why? Are you going to
become an ascetic?

46
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,536
My marriage will be only
after directing my first film;

47
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,537
Now leave me alone.
Driver! Start the car.

48
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,556
A novel idea!

49
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:31,558
Here will be the interval break;

50
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,561
I show in a different way
that the hero and heroine;

51
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,062
How is it?
Super sir;

52
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,566
Giving full light,

53
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,067
We are taking a shot,
keeping hero and heroine in the centre;

54
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,072
Who ever it may be, madam is praying,
no one can go inside.

55
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,575
Remove your hand;
Who is that madam?

56
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,077
Are you asking who that madam is?

57
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:54,080
Padma madam,
daughter of Mr. Chandrasekar;

58
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:57,083
He is the one who
builds temple, digs ponds.

59
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,586
In this village even crops grow
only after her permission;

60
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:02,088
Even babies will laugh
only with her permission;

61
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:03,590
He is director Sekar Raja;

62
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:07,093
No need... all this
won't work out here;

63
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,095
Do you know Mr. Sivaji?
Yes

64
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,597
When he came here,
even he was not allowed;

65
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,099
This is the rule laid by
Mr. Chandasesekar;

66
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:16,602
<i>Keeping a block here, by fixing...</i>

67
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:18,104
This won't work out here sir.

68
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,607
The lyaner temple,15 Km
form here will be superior to this;

69
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,108
Is he or me the director?

70
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:23,610
Ho No... You only sir!

71
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:25,111
Then we are taking the shot
only in this temple;

72
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,113
Otherwise, make a set.
Tell this to Sridahr.

73
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,122
You are going out station on this 18th,
regarding lease matter;

74
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:39,125
So, we postponed the inauguration
of our bank branch to 20th.

75
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,627
You must definitely come
and participate in that;

76
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:42,628
You told that collector
& DGM are coming no?

77
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:44,630
We have already informed them;

78
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,632
How will it be if you are not in
our village functions?

79
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,135
After sir, you are everything no?

80
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,637
You should definitely
come and participate;

81
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:59,145
What is this Kamala,
you are sitting here and showing cinema?

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,648
Can't you keep the window?
We will get some fresh air no?

83
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,651
Why are you also playing with the girl?

84
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:09,656
Did you give prasadam to grand father?

85
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,159
How would you give?
Always be playful;

86
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:15,161
Will.
What is this dad?

87
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,163
For past few days you are
thinking of saying something;

88
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,165
For past six months
he is telling the same thing;

89
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,168
He is telling 'life'.

90
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:26,172
Don't worry;
nothing will happen to your life;

91
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:28,174
Why do you shed tears?

92
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,176
Is that because your son
did not come and see you?

93
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,178
Keep quiet mom;
Lift him.

94
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,681
See here, you daughter is
taking care of you very well no?

95
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,182
What is there then?

96
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:37,684
Your grand daughter Sowmya;

97
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:41,676
Takes care of temple, farm

98
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:44,190
And college everything;
like a male Don't worry;

99
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,204
<i>Sister! Did you see the
photo that mom gave?</i>

100
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,206
<i>No, .
Do you know the name?</i>

101
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,208
<i>Don't know, .
Height?</i>

102
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:04,710
<i>Will you marry
without knowing anything?</i>

103
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,209
<i>You should love, .</i>

104
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,715
<i>You won't talk anything
other than love, .</i>

105
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:10,716
<i>Ok, how should be your would be?</i>

106
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,844
<i>To be a good person, .
How will youfind out?</i>

107
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:14,345
<i>It will be known by seeing the eyes, .</i>

108
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:19,225
<i>I want all, lightning, rain and storm, .</i>

109
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,128
<i>From that a man like a celestial will come, .</i>

110
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:24,230
<i>He will sing Bharathi's poetry, .</i>

111
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,232
<i>Shouldn't you also select
a person like that?</i>

112
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,728
<i>Thisface, this body, my femininity, .</i>

113
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:35,241
<i>I didn't select any of these, .</i>

114
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:37,743
<i>I didn't select even the name Sowmya, .</i>

115
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,746
<i>Why should I select
the husband alone?</i>

116
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,248
<i>I will never accept this, .</i>

117
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,250
<i>Then, are you going to wait
till your celestial come?</i>

118
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,253
<i>I won't, . Yesterday is an imagination, .</i>

119
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,755
<i>Tomorrow is a thinking, .</i>

120
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,758
<i>Only today is real, .</i>

121
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,260
<i>Till you get cold, sit here
and go on reading poetry, .</i>

122
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,263
<i>After I plant rose</i>

123
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:27,282
<i>Oh little minas!</i>

124
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:30,796
<i>On hearing my voice, gather together, .</i>

125
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:49,304
<i>I am inviting,
my diwali day should come, .</i>

126
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,323
<i>Tomorrow is only a dream, .</i>

127
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,325
<i>Why should we believe that?</i>

128
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:03,885
<i>If I plant rose, it should
bloom today itself,,</i>

129
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:59,375
<i>If a moon comes in
the day time, is it a sin?</i>

130
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,880
<i>If a rainbow comes in
the night, is it a crime?</i>

131
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:09,384
<i>Answer me, .
Sweet drums in the heart, .</i>

132
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:20,896
<i>Some desires, few dreams, .
Is there life without these?</i>

133
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:26,401
<i>If you dream 100 times, .
Won't 6 dreams come true atleast</i>

134
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:30,905
<i>Will the dream come true?</i>

135
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,950
<i>Let the cuckoos cry telling my name, .</i>

136
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:20,089
<i>Let the season change suitable to me, .</i>

137
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,459
<i>Dancing in the heart, .</i>

138
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,479
<i>Tearing the wind,
our sweating will be cleared, .</i>

139
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:35,978
<i>Invite collector Ramasamy, .</i>

140
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:41,477
<i>Tomorrow isfor god, .
Today isfor humans, .</i>

141
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:46,481
<i>Life isfor those who live, .</i>

142
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,031
Got the UGC permission;

143
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,035
What happened to the
starting of Oracle class?

144
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:30,536
Organized for that too;

145
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,038
M.L. A Palanichamy has
been invited for the inauguration;

146
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,540
What is the connection between
the wine shop owner and oracle?

147
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,045
You look pretty sister;

148
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,049
As I married without
anyone's knowledge, I am unlucky;

149
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,051
Let me at least enjoy
doing all these to you; She is the next;

150
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:47,553
No need; I am going search myself;

151
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,556
In this wasteland,
you will get only the shepherd;

152
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,558
I am going to marry only Raman;

153
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,061
Who is that Raman?
Have you started soon?

154
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,063
She is telling about
the nobel prize winner Sir.C.V. Raman;

155
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,067
He is a scientist, and it is
30 years since his death.

156
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,568
Is he dead?

157
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:06,572
Doctors and engineers
are not enough for her;

158
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:11,577
Oh god! What am I going to do
with all of you? Take that ear ring;

159
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:14,080
She is taking of the college.

160
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:16,081
Your grand dad is very
closely related to our family;

161
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:18,584
Give to them.

162
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:24,590
What is this all on a sudden?

163
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,592
Today, the power won't go;
it will come now;

164
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,107
If there is a fault in horoscope, it is ok;

165
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:43,609
We came with a thought that
we can have some remedy;

166
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:47,112
Before this, a man has
already come and fixed her;

167
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,615
But after that, he immediately died;

168
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,118
The broker did not tell
me this news;

169
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:56,121
We have only one son;
that is why we hesitate;

170
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:59,125
<i>If you want, your 2nd daughter ...</i>

171
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:03,117
Not urgent; think well
and send us the news;

172
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,138
You should have told;
What is the use of hiding?

173
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,140
Her hands have become
hard by giving coffee;

174
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:16,642
Let paste notice at the entrance;

175
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,144
Stating that my
daughter is unlucky

176
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:19,645
Inviting someone to marry her;

177
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,147
Knowing everything,
don't talk like this Meenu.

178
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,640
Can I tell that they send the boy
in coffin, whom we already fixed?

179
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,154
There was an American nurse's
photo in his pocket;

180
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:29,655
That's why he committed suicide;

181
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,157
Why don't you tell that?

182
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:34,660
My sister has no connection
with that death;

183
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:39,665
Without telling that,
why are you always wounding her?

184
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,667
Yes, I am the reason for everything.

185
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,173
Dad, what are you telling?

186
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,177
There is something in that box;
it will be known if opened.

187
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,681
Nothing; he asks for horlicks, give;

188
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,201
Spit well;

189
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,704
Do you spit because I married
against your wish?

190
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,707
That you told that I am
not your daughter no?

191
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,209
For that one word alone,
we didn't come to you,

192
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,711
Even when we suffered,
by the death of my husband.

193
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:30,716
I heard that you are not well;
and came to help you

194
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,709
I am taking care of you no?
This is necessary for me;

195
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,723
Mom, grand dad is like child;

196
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,726
Keep quiet;
it is my fate;

197
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:44,730
Why are you crying grand dad?

198
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,234
Sai uncle hasn't come for the
past 10 years, so that you cry?

199
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:49,735
Don't worry;

200
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:54,239
This grand daughter's
bad luck is known to all;

201
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,746
Definitely I will not get married;

202
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,750
I will always with be you.

203
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,758
Where have you
brought us Sivagnanam?

204
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,261
Whose house is this?
Which town is this?

205
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:18,764
You wished to be in
your own house at the old age.

206
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,267
For that only I brought
you here; This is our house mom;

207
00:17:22,802 --> 00:17:23,769
This is not our house;

208
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:25,771
There were plantain trees here;
there were bunches of fruits;

209
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,775
Banyan tree will last long;
will the plantain trees last for years?

210
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,277
My heart is paining;
I feel suffocating;

211
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:36,282
where have you gone?
I am dying, come soon;

212
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,283
Wait mom, I have to dry my hair?

213
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,285
All in the family will wake up
by saying good morning

214
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,787
I will definitely die before that;

215
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:43,789
You are waking up saying
that you are going to die;

216
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,791
Sir, we don't have any
medical facility in our town;

217
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,294
Please send for uncle,
may be it heart attack too;

218
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,296
Don't I know what my mom has?

219
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:56,802
Did you see? If she hears
the word 'marriage',

220
00:17:57,337 --> 00:18:01,296
Or if she hears marriage music,
she will immediately sit;

221
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:04,310
Where are bride and bridegroom?

222
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:05,811
They are in hurry mother;

223
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:07,313
They went for honeymoon
before marriage itself;

224
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:08,814
Now days they are fast;

225
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,816
You want to see a marriage now,
that's all no?

226
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,318
Hey! Come here

227
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:14,820
Bring one auspicious thread
and bring Raji & Viji

228
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,823
Bring Raji and Viji.
Why are staring like this?

229
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:19,825
Bring the bride and groom.

230
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,329
Mom! This Raja and this Viji;

231
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,332
Why are you fighting now itself?

232
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,834
You should not come
to complaint me, to get divorce;

233
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,336
Hey play drums...

234
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,341
Take them, they may
do their honey moon here itself; Go

235
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,343
For cat!
Then what?

236
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:39,845
Should do this for human beings,

237
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,847
I should get virtues in my death

238
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,850
Ho... My heart is paining;

239
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:49,343
Like this doing marriage
to relatives, servants.

240
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:51,356
At last I have done
marriage for these cats too!

241
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:52,858
Wear this coin chain;

242
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:55,861
My would be should come here;

243
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,863
Yes! He will come in search
of you to poongodi;

244
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:00,365
I won't go, leaving my mummy;

245
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:02,868
This time you didn't
hide anything no?

246
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:04,870
Through the broker
I have told everything;

247
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,372
Previously one man came
to see her and gone;

248
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:09,374
He returned in a coffin,
with a lady's photo, everything I told

249
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,877
Ok... ok... its enough;
Keep quiet;

250
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:18,884
The bride-groom had come;

251
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:20,386
All of you get ready soon;

252
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,887
For you all Time is not enough for make up;

253
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:23,889
I am not going to get ready;

254
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,393
I think I have seen this house before;

255
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:30,430
That may be in your previous birth;

256
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,398
Telling your love story;

257
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:34,399
By attracting,
get their permission;

258
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:35,901
I will manage other things... go

259
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,906
Kamla, Meenu,
some one go and open the door.

260
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,437
Hai! I am Manohar;

261
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,442
Welcome brother, come, and come inside;

262
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:18,444
From America...
Yes New York...

263
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:19,945
How did you know?

264
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,447
Have you come alone?

265
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,950
We can talk straight;
that is my style;

266
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,457
Where are you going?
Come, come and sit here;

267
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:36,450
We have seen many places;
but, I liked nothing this much;

268
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,464
You are talking openly... Sit down.

269
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:40,966
I don't like to talk indirectly

270
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:42,468
I came in tension

271
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:44,469
But out side they
are talking differently;

272
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:45,971
Don't believe it brother;

273
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,473
No, No, I didn't believe;

274
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:50,976
You don't have
any problem no?

275
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:55,981
What, suddenly?
All this will set suddenly only;

276
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,985
I will accept whatever you say;
I won't force you

277
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,492
What do you think?

278
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,506
Then, if you tell me the amount...

279
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,009
Mom! I won't agree for money;

280
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:26,011
<i>What... you...
Mummy I...</i>

281
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,513
You keep quite,
I will talk about everything;

282
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:30,015
What do you think?

283
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,518
I will go and tell whatever you say;

284
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,024
How much for two nights?

285
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:46,031
If you have any problem,

286
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,533
With out any damage,
with less lights...

287
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:51,036
We may finish in one night itself;

288
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,039
What is this, you are talking
about one night, two nights?

289
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:56,041
Is marriage not a matter of life?

290
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,043
Marriage?

291
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:00,045
Madam! Car accident;

292
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,547
Nothing happened for the groom.

293
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,048
Only the driver got heavy injury;

294
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:06,051
My name is Manohar;

295
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,553
I am working as an
assistant under Director Sekarraja;

296
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:10,055
I came for shooting permission...

297
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,560
Why are you spoiling my lively hood?

298
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:17,062
Come let us go come
Sir small confusion...

299
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,066
Go

300
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:23,568
New York, have you got the permission?

301
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:25,070
Have You managed?

302
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:28,073
Are you loading
your work on my head?

303
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,076
Why are you beating me?
Tell me, and then beat;

304
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:32,578
I went to get permission,
they thought me as the groom;

305
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,581
Everything is because of you;
What can I do?

306
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:06,611
Driver sir! Please take the car in reverse.

307
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:17,623
That day you got
very much upset;

308
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:19,625
Because of me;

309
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,627
Subbiya! Take the car.

310
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,129
There is no relation
between you and me;

311
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:29,624
But, you said yes for the alliance;

312
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,638
<i>If I had really come to see you...</i>

313
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:36,641
Subbiya go in reverse;

314
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,646
We are meeting again and again;

315
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:51,156
Take it

316
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:55,149
We will be pride, if
your daughters sing in our function.

317
00:23:55,695 --> 00:24:00,155
Not only that, boys who
earn in Dollar & pounds will also come;

318
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,668
It will be a good opportunity
for the marriage too;

319
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:04,669
<i>For my daughter, in Horoscope...</i>

320
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:07,672
A man who doesn't believe
horoscope, religion or god has come;

321
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,174
He is very good person;

322
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,178
Your daughter doesn't want
an athlete of running competition no?

323
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:18,684
Question arouse that day;

324
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,187
Got the answer today;

325
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,691
Desire came that day;

326
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:30,695
Why don't you go
to some rest-house?

327
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,197
Why are taking my life here?

328
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:33,699
Your lags are alright no?

329
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:37,202
<i>Why are you rolling?
Have you got piles? Run...</i>

330
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:40,706
Why is boss shouting like this?

331
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,208
His a military man no?
That is why he threatens;

332
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:44,710
If he gets married,
then everything will be ok

333
00:24:45,244 --> 00:24:47,212
<i>Marriage after the time has passed...</i>

334
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,215
How will it be if there
is a girl to enjoy all these?

335
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,718
Bala! Why are you scolding
the workers in the morning itself?

336
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:58,223
Since you get rum in
low cost from military canteen,

337
00:24:58,758 --> 00:24:59,725
Have you started in the morning itself?

338
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,227
By dusting all the old idols

339
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,229
I arranged for a function,
come home in the evening;

340
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:05,731
What is the relationship
between me and god?

341
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:07,732
Good looking girls will also come...

342
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:09,234
What is the relationship
between me and girls?

343
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:11,736
Go, You are missing all good things;

344
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:14,239
Do whatever you want;
do you know how they will sing?

345
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:17,743
Song!

346
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:25,750
You make friendship
with local persons;

347
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,752
It will be easy for you
to get permission for location;

348
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,754
Why are you taking us for that?
Please adjust a little...

349
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,756
If we keep a block here
and take a shot in low angle

350
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,258
it will be beautiful;

351
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:35,761
Is cinema shooting?

352
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:38,263
In this village there are
only 2 big houses;

353
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:40,265
One is Mr. Chandasekar's
and the other is mine;

354
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,267
But the documents are not with us;
it is in pawnbroker's hand;

355
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:43,769
Have heroines not come?

356
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:46,271
Heroines won't come
to see the location sir.

357
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,273
Ok go inside and see the location;

358
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,275
I am waiting for a commando;
I will come along with him ok?

359
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:52,778
Sir you wait;

360
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,780
In your movie,
if there is any arbitration scene,

361
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:58,283
Give me a small chance sir;
I will talk good dialogue sir;

362
00:25:58,818 --> 00:25:59,785
There is no court scene
in our movie;

363
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,786
Is there a tamil movie
without court scene?

364
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:03,789
They are taking risk...

365
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:08,794
It seems there is some pooja,

366
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:10,795
No need to disturb
today; come let us go;

367
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,797
Wait, we have already come no?

368
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:16,802
Sister, come let us see there;
Ok

369
00:26:18,337 --> 00:26:19,304
See who is coming;

370
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:25,310
She is not even minding you;

371
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,816
See now, she will turn;

372
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:38,824
Sister!

373
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:57,342
<i>What for is hide and seek?</i>

374
00:26:58,377 --> 00:26:59,344
<i>My dear...</i>

375
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:09,721
<i>I am like a thing made of glass, .</i>

376
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,867
<i>I askedfor the
banks of that river, .</i>

377
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:25,370
<i>And I asked
stopping the air also, .</i>

378
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,880
<i>I asked the sky too, .
But no there is no answer, .</i>

379
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,378
<i>And at last I saw you, .
And I saw in my heart, .</i>

380
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:00,405
<i>Bala! What is this?</i>

381
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,407
<i>I have invited important
guestsfor the function, .</i>

382
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:04,409
<i>Mother is also here, .
You are coming with bottle, that too drunken!</i>

383
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:06,912
<i>Mother will oftenforget you, .
Will she remember me?</i>

384
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:08,913
<i>Correct even if she sees you,
she will forget in the morning, .</i>

385
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:10,509
<i>Give it, .
What for?</i>

386
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,917
<i>Let me hide that somewhere, .
Shouldn't come drinking, .</i>

387
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:36,431
<i>Is my heart
a playing doll for you?</i>

388
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:48,443
<i>Don't I have my own
feelings separately?</i>

389
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:51,957
<i>The waves of
the heart won't sleep, .</i>

390
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:57,952
<i>Come to cover my mouth
with your lips my darling!</i>

391
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:13,967
<i>Come to close my eyes with your lids, .</i>

392
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:18,472
<i>Only your body is my dress no?</i>

393
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,987
<i>Even after playing
in the ocean of milk,</i>

394
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:24,489
<i>Your color hasn't changed yet, .</i>

395
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,188
<i>Come to change your
color after uniting in my heart, .</i>

396
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,501
<i>Come and merge with my life, .</i>

397
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:40,494
<i>Let your lips become wet, .
Come andjoin with me, .</i>

398
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:30,044
<i>When rain comes, you will protect
with the mountain, .</i>

399
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:42,056
<i>When the rain comesfrom eyes,
with which will you protect me?</i>

400
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,259
<i>You will enjoy the tears of flowers, .</i>

401
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:51,565
<i>Am I not a girl my darling?</i>

402
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:55,080
<i>Don't you have eyes to see that?</i>

403
00:30:56,615 --> 00:31:00,073
<i>Am I not in your dreams?</i>

404
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,515
<i>Every day my heart is swinging, .</i>

405
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:06,091
<i>My leg is not dumb, .</i>

406
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,784
<i>In my breath, my life is swelling, .</i>

407
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,590
<i>Only your touch
protects my life from suffering, .</i>

408
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,602
<i>Shall I give my life?</i>

409
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:37,622
He is Bala.

410
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:39,624
But, to keep a Reith,
for the relatives of the dead,

411
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,126
Is there a memorial, here?

412
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,129
People like you must be little cautious;

413
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,630
I was cautious only;

414
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:50,134
Does any one knew that
the school children had AK47?

415
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,637
Will any one keep his leg
on landmine intentionally?

416
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:56,140
I am talking about steps and
you are talking about mine;

417
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,643
My legs burst into pieces;

418
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:01,646
While touching the
landmine in Vanni forest;

419
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:05,149
This is fiberglass body; modern technology;

420
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:07,652
Don't touch me;

421
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:11,156
I do not need love or
sympathy from anybody;

422
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:15,159
When we all were
fighting for our country,

423
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:19,152
You were all watching
cricket in color TV with kapil-dev;

424
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,666
Do you know how pitty we felt
when kargil war was going no?

425
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:23,168
Keep quite;

426
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:26,170
For you people war means kargil only;

427
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:30,175
Even at this moment war
is going on in Siyat, you know that?

428
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,677
In IPKF 1500 soldiers died;

429
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:45,690
No, they won't keep;
You sing and dance;

430
00:32:46,725 --> 00:32:47,692
Why is this much hatred?

431
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,694
You are still alive no?

432
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,703
Do you know
what is worse than death?

433
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:01,706
To be forgotten;

434
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,210
Song was good;

435
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,713
Changing from
natakurichi to sahana was very classic!

436
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,215
I don't know any raga;

437
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:12,717
If you learn in proper way
you can sing even better;

438
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,219
Your voice is good

439
00:33:14,753 --> 00:33:15,720
Meenakshi, He is
bluffing after drinking;

440
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,222
And you keep on talking?
Come;

441
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:20,224
Before advising me
first you stop drinking;

442
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:24,729
What are you in cinema?
Assistant director;

443
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,231
Name?
Manohar sir;

444
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,233
Good name;
Thank you;

445
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:29,734
<i>Sir you...</i>

446
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:31,236
Bala you have spoiled by bluffing;

447
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,739
His garden is on your way
back only please drop him;

448
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:36,241
My car gear is automatic,
I will drive my self;

449
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:38,743
That is right; cinema fellow
hasn't driven automatic car,

450
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,245
Let him drive, you leave;

451
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,246
<i>Then it is ok...
Ok... go</i>

452
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:49,754
War has affected you a lot no?

453
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,257
First they told it is peace;

454
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,274
In war death or
loosing legs are normal;

455
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,278
But we got down
at Chennai harbor;

456
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:16,281
No one cared us;

457
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:20,285
Then only I felt the pain;

458
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:26,290
For whom did we fight,
for what did we die?

459
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:27,792
All are waste;

460
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,300
We reached your house;

461
00:34:37,836 --> 00:34:40,805
It was a dangerous story no?
But it is true;

462
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,308
<i>Fully true, 100o/o truth;
Major sir...</i>

463
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,311
Don't take as movie;
no one will watch it;

464
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:47,812
Take a love story;

465
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:50,815
Love by telling, love without telling;

466
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,817
Love by telling and without telling;

467
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:56,321
You go;
You go I will take care;

468
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,324
You also came for the function
only to love no?

469
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:00,825
<i>Ho... no...For shooting!</i>

470
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,328
That is ok; but you
came for romance no?

471
00:35:04,863 --> 00:35:05,830
Who is the girl?

472
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:07,832
Is that singing girl or...

473
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:10,835
<i>No... the one next to her;</i>

474
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,329
Blue color silk sari;
the tall one no?

475
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,343
When is the marriage?

476
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:24,349
After directing my first film;

477
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:25,850
First film!

478
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,853
Film only no?
You take in my garden itself;

479
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:31,856
<i>Hero... Heroine all...
ho! Be careful;</i>

480
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,859
With that a role for me too;
A limping villain;

481
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,367
That is not so easy;

482
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:44,869
Cinema person will cheat and go;
and you will also cheat;

483
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:47,371
Not as you think;

484
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:54,379
Take film soon;
Get married soon;

485
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:56,380
Don't become like me;

486
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:59,383
I am surrounded by flowers only;

487
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:06,391
Is there no girl in Madras?

488
00:36:10,929 --> 00:36:12,897
She is pathetic;
Is it pathetic?

489
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:14,899
This love story seems to be greater than ours;

490
00:36:16,935 --> 00:36:18,402
But she has to wait till I finish my film;

491
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:20,905
She will wait; go and ask her;

492
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,419
On that day you were in steps;

493
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:36,421
With tears in your eyes;

494
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:39,924
Don't start again;

495
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,927
I don't know
what you are trying to tell;

496
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:45,429
But I don't like this love and all;

497
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:46,931
There is poetry in your silence;

498
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:48,433
There is painting in your smile;

499
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:49,934
There is song in you calmness;

500
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,436
That is the beauty in you;

501
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:56,930
<i>To deny, one moment is enough, .</i>

502
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,446
<i>To bear the word 'no',</i>

503
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:07,441
<i>I need one more life, .</i>

504
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:12,957
<i>What are you going to tell?</i>

505
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:36,471
<i>Is it fair for the windows to
punish the sandal breeze?</i>

506
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:47,548
<i>What is the reply for
the question of love?
Is it silence?</i>

507
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:54,488
<i>Dear! One moment is
enough to tell my love, .</i>

508
00:37:55,534 --> 00:38:00,494
<i>To make it true, I need one more life, .</i>

509
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:41,595
<i>Heart is a mirror, in that your image fell, .</i>

510
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,610
<i>This is your own, .
That is what my heart told me, .</i>

511
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:52,606
<i>There is no rope to tie
the mirror image, .</i>

512
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:57,121
<i>The image is swinging
in the mirror swing, .</i>

513
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:00,625
<i>You tell me one thing, .</i>

514
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,628
<i>Or you kill me my darling!</i>

515
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:08,121
<i>My life is in your eyes, .
Don't chase me,</i>

516
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,200
<i>And my life will not
reach the shore, .</i>

517
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,706
<i>Even after the dawn comes,</i>

518
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,710
<i>Which is the night
which doesn't see dawn?</i>

519
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,714
<i>Your hair which has
the fragrance of flower, .</i>

520
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,218
<i>Even after this world
has become dark, .</i>

521
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,720
<i>Which is the portion
that doesn't become dark?</i>

522
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:41,280
<i>Your eyes in which raysfierce into, .</i>

523
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,729
<i>Many world beauties may join together</i>

524
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:47,732
<i>And wash your feet, come here</i>

525
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:50,734
<i>Hey my tenders flower!
What is the hesitation still?</i>

526
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:53,737
<i>Don't you understand me?
Is this life or death?</i>

527
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,782
Who is he?

528
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:42,286
Why is he running behind me?

529
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,288
I feel like scolding him,

530
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:48,292
I am not able to scold
him whole heartedly;

531
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:51,295
Can I trust a cinema man?

532
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,791
But when I see him,
I feel happy in my heart;

533
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:07,311
What granddad?

534
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,817
Hai! I can do experiment;

535
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:16,821
Shouldn't touch;
for that, I will give you another one;

536
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:20,825
Tanjore veena! Is it for me?

537
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,328
Yes, not for show,
to learn music in proper way;

538
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:34,338
Major... have you
stopped drinking?

539
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:36,340
I had set right my path;

540
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,842
Then I have to learn music;

541
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,847
Will he remove his leg
while taking bath?

542
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:44,348
Keep quite.

543
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,857
He is a brave man no?

544
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:54,859
Crazy!

545
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:33,397
Go and bring one peg with
2 chilly bajji;

546
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:34,899
Sir no drink!

547
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:36,900
What sir no drink?
Doesn't he have money?

548
00:44:37,435 --> 00:44:39,903
No he discarded it totally;
he had broken all the bottles.

549
00:44:40,438 --> 00:44:41,405
Has he broken all the bottles?

550
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,907
Bala! Is it love?

551
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,908
Love! For me!

552
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:46,910
After completing for you cats,
have you come to me?

553
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,413
When your father died,
he didn't die just like that;

554
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:51,415
He got promise from me
to get you married,

555
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:52,917
And then only died;

556
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:55,919
But you, when I start
talking about spinsters,

557
00:44:56,454 --> 00:44:57,921
You are talking about
land mines AK 47; and military.

558
00:44:58,456 --> 00:44:59,923
Before grandma dies,
you get married;

559
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,426
These sentiments won't work here;

560
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:04,428
Ok tell at least before I die;

561
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,932
Leaving that giving veena,
singing music, all these are boring;

562
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:09,933
Why don't you say
directly that you love her?

563
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:13,437
If you feel shy, tell me,
I will tell her that you love her;

564
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:15,940
Why did your thought
become so cheap?

565
00:45:16,474 --> 00:45:17,441
That girl sang well;
so I told her to learn music;

566
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:18,943
What's her age and
what is my age?

567
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:21,445
Why are you telling
that you are aged?

568
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:25,950
Look at my eyes and
tell me that you don't love her;

569
00:45:26,484 --> 00:45:27,951
I can't look at your eyes and tell.
Ok I will turn you tell. ;

570
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:29,453
Ok at least look into my hand and tell...

571
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,456
<i>Tell me dear...
what happened no sound?</i>

572
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:33,958
Will tell...
Tell me then

573
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:35,459
<i>Bala please tell...</i>

574
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,462
Between Me major Bala and

575
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:43,456
<i>Meenakshi of Pungudi village has...</i>

576
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,975
Shining in the face, smile
and shyness too;

577
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:52,476
More over you have
trimmed your mustache;

578
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:55,479
There were one or two
white hairs; You have found out those also;

579
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:57,982
Bala you have fallen in love!

580
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:12,996
They are all returning home
after finishing the shooting;

581
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:16,500
If we chase we can catch
Mr. Manohar sir;

582
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,022
You searched for me no?

583
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:42,025
<i>You said no ... now
you have chosen one;</i>

584
00:46:46,064 --> 00:46:49,033
At the first sight
it self I started loving you;

585
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:51,535
Now I am asking you straight,

586
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,030
Is your student pass, fail or TC?

587
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,046
You're a laughing;

588
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:07,551
I can't tell anything,

589
00:47:08,586 --> 00:47:09,553
come
and ask my mother;

590
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,057
Before I ask your mother,
I have to take a film;

591
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:14,558
I have to prove
myself to this world;

592
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:18,662
I don't have rights to
make you wait till that;

593
00:47:19,097 --> 00:47:20,064
But only one year;

594
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:22,566
Some how I will get a chance,
finish the movie and I will be back;

595
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,068
In this there are three titles;

596
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:28,071
Please choose any one of them;
I won't;

597
00:47:28,606 --> 00:47:30,574
<i>You are inspiration
for my movie; so please...</i>

598
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:47,591
"Speed"
'Speed' by Manohar;

599
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,096
After finishing the movie,
I'll come back with the same speed,

600
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,597
To take you home;

601
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:09,613
Did he give you kiss?

602
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:13,617
What?
Where? In hand or on your cheeks?

603
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:15,119
You have become mad;

604
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:16,620
Have you not yet
reached that stage?

605
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:18,622
Long married life!

606
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:22,126
For that she has to get married first;
Come...

607
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:25,629
Is marriage after taking the film?

608
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,134
When is going to take film?

609
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:32,636
There is nothing between us;

610
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:34,638
Did he hug you so tight?

611
00:48:35,673 --> 00:48:38,642
Minu this is neither your poem nor love;
Then what?

612
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:42,146
You can say some kind of affection;

613
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,148
What... affection?

614
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:46,650
No need for the dettol coated words;

615
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:48,686
Tell openly that you love him;

616
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:50,153
Go... if you want,
you marry him;

617
00:48:50,688 --> 00:48:53,156
Go sister; Just like a storm
a man will come for me;

618
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:54,658
I will love him;

619
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:57,160
No affection business like you;

620
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:01,165
Mine is clear, definite
and successful love;

621
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:03,166
It's a combination
of body and mind;

622
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:05,168
<i>Ok ...ok he will come...</i>

623
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:09,673
Population is the
strength of India;

624
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,176
Every body is
talking bad about it;

625
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,678
However you increase
your production,

626
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,681
You need people to buy
soap comp paste etc;

627
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:21,185
With that courage only,
I came to the stock market;

628
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,188
No fear, no fear and no fear at all,

629
00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:26,690
When we oppose our likings

630
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:29,193
No hesitation no hesitation no hesitation

631
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:33,197
Mr. Srikanth you have come
from an ordinary family;

632
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:35,699
But you are a big short
in share market;

633
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:38,201
What could be the reasons
for your success?

634
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:42,706
The faith which I have
on my mother land;

635
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:45,709
The faith which my
depositor have on me;

636
00:49:47,745 --> 00:49:50,714
Most important you
must have a firm mind;

637
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,717
There must be
sweetness in your word;

638
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,219
Dreams must come true;

639
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:56,720
Thank you Mr. Srikanth;

640
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:59,223
As far as the Stock market
is concerned, you are a big hero;

641
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:00,724
We thank you for
participating in our program

642
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:03,227
And exchanging your
views with us;

643
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:10,233
You told many things
about stock market;

644
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:12,736
And by telling
Bharathiyar poem, you excelled it;

645
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:14,238
We didn't expect it at all;

646
00:50:15,773 --> 00:50:16,740
My dear Ladies and gentle men,

647
00:50:17,775 --> 00:50:23,236
While people in city,
is enjoying all privileges;

648
00:50:23,781 --> 00:50:26,750
: For villagers like us,
also to come up in life,

649
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:30,754
To become wealthy,
he has started this program;

650
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,757
Among ten depositors,
one will get color TV;

651
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,259
150th branch opening,

652
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:37,761
Can't you take care of all
these from now? What is the need for me?

653
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:40,263
You are the star of our company;

654
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:42,766
For your face only
these people are depositing with us;

655
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:44,268
With out you how?

656
00:50:45,803 --> 00:50:46,770
In all the places this speech only;

657
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:48,772
Talking like scratched record;

658
00:50:49,807 --> 00:50:51,274
Will there not be anything
different at least in this village?

659
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:56,279
You take care; let me leave;

660
00:50:57,815 --> 00:50:59,282
I will scoot; all my money have gone;

661
00:50:59,817 --> 00:51:00,784
If I had invested in a chit company,

662
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,286
I would have got at least interest;

663
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,787
Mad fellow!

664
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:07,291
See, in cards if you
don't get rummy, you can scoot;

665
00:51:07,825 --> 00:51:10,293
But if you go and
play with him, it is high risk;

666
00:51:10,828 --> 00:51:11,795
Everything will go and
he will close the gate;

667
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,297
Then you will be on roads;

668
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:15,298
But he is giving 20o/o interest;

669
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:18,802
Yes he will give 20o/o, 30o/o, even 40o/o;

670
00:51:19,337 --> 00:51:21,305
Because you will get interest only,

671
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,307
But he is gaining
your deposit itself; Mad fellow!

672
00:51:46,864 --> 00:51:47,831
We can get wet;

673
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:53,326
I want to fly over this
Pungudi and that mountains;

674
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:54,838
Were you born as a crane
in your previous birth?

675
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:01,345
The one who is born for me
will come in search of me;

676
00:52:01,879 --> 00:52:03,847
Joining with him,
and holding his hand,

677
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:05,349
I will go around this world;

678
00:52:05,883 --> 00:52:06,850
Are pointing rays from
your eyes, sun or moon?

679
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:08,352
<i>Sister... A song!</i>

680
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:12,355
Bharathiyar poetry;
Come let us go;

681
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:23,356
Dark and round eyes
represent the black sky;

682
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:33,367
Like the dark blue sari
with diamonds;

683
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:42,376
The stars that appear in the midnight.

684
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:54,388
Is your smile like light in the garden?

685
00:52:58,936 --> 00:53:07,901
Is your heart's wave like
the wave of the blue sea?

686
00:53:08,946 --> 00:53:15,408
Your voice is as sweet as
the voice of the cuckoo;

687
00:53:17,455 --> 00:53:24,418
I fell in unchanging love on you;

688
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:33,927
You are talking about sentiments,
why is that needed?

689
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:41,434
Do the people who
have anger have sentiments?

690
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:49,442
If the elders accept,
then we can proceed with procedures;

691
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:50,954
What happened?

692
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:51,955
Come mother
What happened?

693
00:53:55,993 --> 00:53:57,961
<i>Why is she so wet?
Thank you very much, you...</i>

694
00:53:58,496 --> 00:53:59,963
I am Srikanth, you can call me Srika;

695
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:01,465
Is her leg broken?

696
00:54:01,999 --> 00:54:03,466
Nothing, some sprain;

697
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:05,468
If you put little balm
and 2 Bharathiyar poem,

698
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:06,970
Everything will be ok;

699
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:14,478
Is this dream or real sister?

700
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:17,481
I told you no...?

701
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:19,983
<i>The man who was born
for me has come...;</i>

702
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,488
Bala come... come...
Take that bottle dear;

703
00:54:25,022 --> 00:54:25,989
For a small sprain,
is this much show needed?

704
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,491
Doesn't this look too much?
What is too much?

705
00:54:28,025 --> 00:54:28,992
Love itself is too much;
only marriage is natural;

706
00:54:30,027 --> 00:54:31,995
For an ant bite lot of them
come in plane to enquire;

707
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,997
Go inside and enquire well;
What to enquire?

708
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:35,499
Do ask what to enquire?
It is too bad;

709
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:38,001
For your range only
the elder will be suitable;

710
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:40,504
But Manohar has already reserved her;

711
00:54:41,038 --> 00:54:42,005
But you don't leave this love;

712
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,007
There is no love or romance;
Yes I know this is pure love!

713
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:48,500
Go inside and tell her that
you stopped drinking for her only;

714
00:54:49,046 --> 00:54:51,014
Take this, Go;
You also come;

715
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:53,517
Go man... you are the one in love.
I am a bit in side only;

716
00:54:59,056 --> 00:55:01,024
Why did you go to the river banks?
To enjoy rain;

717
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,526
Take a rain coat and go!

718
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,027
When I come next time,

719
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:06,029
I will buy a
good duck back rain coat;

720
00:55:07,064 --> 00:55:09,032
Don't forget to take a torch
while you go out in night;

721
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,535
No need for a torch,
when going in search of future;

722
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,538
Are the rays from
your eyes sun or moon?

723
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,541
Kannama is Bhagavathi's
daughter no? She is good massager;

724
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:20,043
Call her one day and
ask her to do massage;

725
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:22,546
Put a cry bandage;

726
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,048
For four or five days
you should not move your legs;

727
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,550
I am a lame man
and I am advising you;

728
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:32,055
One day when I jumped
from a helicopter,

729
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,057
There was full mist
in the ground;

730
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:36,059
You can't see that much mist.

731
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:38,562
Ho... I forgot
to say one thing;

732
00:55:39,096 --> 00:55:40,563
Now a days I am not touching
even one drop of liquor;

733
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:42,065
I stopped completely;

734
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:51,575
For my Kannama who love poetry,

735
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,076
I drove for the whole night
and brought this;

736
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:56,580
How did you know
that I like this flower very much?

737
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:59,082
Welcome brother;
Why did you leave yesterday without telling?

738
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:00,584
Please sit; I will bring coffee...

739
00:56:01,118 --> 00:56:02,085
Kamala! Keep this in the kitchen;

740
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,087
This is Major Bala;

741
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:07,090
Major Bala, ninth Para. Ex-commando;

742
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:10,093
I am ex-landlord, Sivagnanam;

743
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,595
Now a saint,
playing cards;

744
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:14,597
I am Srikanth,
a normal human being;

745
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:17,100
Ho... who is reading this?

746
00:56:18,135 --> 00:56:20,603
<i>On that day in the moon light...</i>

747
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:22,105
This is from Purananuru

748
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:24,608
It is the literature
of the sangam period no?

749
00:56:25,142 --> 00:56:27,610
2000 year back,
what all they have written!

750
00:56:28,145 --> 00:56:29,112
Now it is not coming no?

751
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:30,614
No, no... now also writing;

752
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:32,615
Who?
Listen to this;

753
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:37,610
That day, in the same moon light;
He was besides me;

754
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:39,122
Kannadasan

755
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:42,625
Hear this, that day in the moon light,

756
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,128
When water drops from the forehead;
Vairamuthu!

757
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:47,130
You got it;

758
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:51,634
: I am growing flowers
but he is giving boquet;

759
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:53,637
Our brain went in
orange and horlicks no?

760
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:56,139
: Go man... you have to give horlikcks;

761
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:57,641
But for that, should you
keep on talking about hospital?

762
00:56:58,175 --> 00:56:59,642
About you fell down from helicopter,
broken leg and the bandage;

763
00:57:00,177 --> 00:57:01,144
Still medicine smell is there;

764
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:04,648
See him, he came,
gave flowers, told some poetic lines;

765
00:57:05,182 --> 00:57:07,650
He talked about all from
Kanndasan to Vairamuthu, in poetic lines;

766
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:11,655
He is tells that he is a normal man,
but he has come in a Benz car!

767
00:57:12,189 --> 00:57:13,156
Might he be a driver?

768
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,158
No boss, I have seen him
somewhere before;

769
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:26,669
In laugh itself he is strikes sixer;

770
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:43,186
Who is this?

771
00:57:46,223 --> 00:57:47,190
Is it you!

772
00:57:49,226 --> 00:57:54,687
I told you 51/2 no...
maximum 53/4 crores; finish with that;

773
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:58,201
Don't make me feel
bored by making call;

774
00:58:00,237 --> 00:58:01,704
How many zeros
are there in a crore?

775
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,206
Seven

776
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:06,209
More than crore?
My Meenu;

777
00:58:09,246 --> 00:58:10,213
For some things,
there is no value at all;

778
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:17,710
I won't get the moment like talking to you,
even if I give crores;

779
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:20,723
Sing sister;
What song?

780
00:58:22,259 --> 00:58:23,726
<i>In the hall, in the memory...</i>

781
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:25,228
The song I like much;

782
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:30,723
The gathered beauty of man,

783
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:33,236
With the sight like flower...

784
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:39,242
This, This is the Bharathiyar's touch;

785
00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:45,248
I will sing; But that is not
Barathiyar, Bharathidasan;

786
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:51,755
What?

787
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,748
Bharathi is by heart for me,

788
00:58:57,294 --> 00:58:58,261
I will tell even if asked in sleep;

789
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:00,764
<i>To me...
Why?</i>

790
00:59:01,298 --> 00:59:02,265
Won't you make any mistake?

791
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,769
No right or wrong,
in Bharathi matter, what I say is final;

792
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:08,771
Hello if you speak loud,
it won't become true; see now;

793
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:21,284
In the 23rd page of this Barathidasan book;

794
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:29,292
Those who don't
know about

795
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,795
Bharathi and Bharathidasan
can listen well;

796
00:59:49,346 --> 00:59:50,813
What if it is Bharathi or Barathidasan?

797
00:59:51,348 --> 00:59:54,317
Are you mad?
Why do you insult him in front of all?

798
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:58,310
I don't know mom,
my tongue is like that.

799
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:02,325
Why are you dancing?

800
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,827
There, the love had
gone failure no?

801
01:00:04,361 --> 01:00:06,829
That chit company man
Srikanth had gone fighting with her;

802
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:08,331
Your nattakurichi is with
broken heart now;

803
01:00:08,866 --> 01:00:09,833
What can I do for that?

804
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,334
Only you have to join
the broken heart;

805
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:13,336
What does that girl think of you?

806
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:14,838
She thinks that you
are a Drunkard, angry man;

807
01:00:15,372 --> 01:00:16,339
Shouldn't you change that opinion?

808
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:18,341
Bring her and show your garden...

809
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:20,343
See here, you keep on packing
and sending flowers;

810
01:00:20,878 --> 01:00:22,345
Then one day some one
will take her away; Change her mind;

811
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,348
That can't be changed uncle;

812
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:27,350
See here, you gave her a veena no?

813
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:28,852
It is one week since
she has touched that; Do you know that?

814
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:34,357
Give it; Why is this when you come on a picnic to my garden?

815
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,359
I am a bachelor only;
but there are tender coconut, we can eat it;

816
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:40,363
Now I am a complete vegetarian;
I have stopped everything;

817
01:00:41,398 --> 01:00:42,865
I take nothing stronger than
butter milk;

818
01:00:45,402 --> 01:00:47,370
Madam garden means, this is garden.

819
01:00:49,406 --> 01:00:50,373
In jasmine itself there are 5 varieties;

820
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:51,875
In Rose there are 10 varieties;

821
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:53,876
<i>Is it orckid?
Orchid...</i>

822
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:55,878
Ya... it is also there;
You can watch it for the whole day;

823
01:00:56,413 --> 01:00:57,380
See here, if interested girl
like you comes here,

824
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,382
You won't move from that place;

825
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:00,884
<i>No bore...</i>

826
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,386
Come sister let us draw something;

827
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:04,888
Boring;

828
01:01:05,422 --> 01:01:07,390
Sit in the shade and read poetry Minu;

829
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:12,896
If Srikanth comes, I have asked him
to come to the garden;

830
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:14,898
There is a chance for Srikanth to come;

831
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:16,399
Is it true?

832
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:26,910
He is a man who once upon a time
was playing with gun in the border;

833
01:01:27,444 --> 01:01:29,912
Now in Kolathur Border,
he is having a beautiful garden;

834
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:32,915
But, should not say simply;
each flower is like smile;

835
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,418
It will be just like a
16 year girl laughing;

836
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:38,421
What is the use of having all these?
No one to enjoy no?

837
01:01:39,456 --> 01:01:41,424
But, since these people
are coming today, there is happiness;

838
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:42,926
Happiness even for my flowers;

839
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,427
That is why this laughter;

840
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:45,929
Here is it, plantain flower vadai;

841
01:01:46,463 --> 01:01:47,930
Vadai in plantain flower?
Can't accept;

842
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:49,932
If it foreigner happens to see this,

843
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:52,435
He will think how to get medicine out it;

844
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,438
But our ladies will see the flower
and pluck and keep it on their hair;

845
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:57,440
Or she will mix with
the batter and put in a kadai;

846
01:01:58,976 --> 01:01:59,943
Vadai is good, if you
want have it please;

847
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:01,444
For one vadai itself
you are telling this;

848
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:03,946
If you eat for 3times,
how will it be?

849
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:05,448
Here is it

850
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:24,968
Shall I join with you in this picnic?

851
01:02:25,502 --> 01:02:26,469
Is there permission?

852
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:32,965
All colors are there;
red orange, blue;

853
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,477
What for is this all!

854
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:38,481
Here is it kamala
I want this specimen...

855
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:39,983
Why are you tearing everything?

856
01:02:40,517 --> 01:02:41,484
What is there?
If I cut and give, it will be ok;

857
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:42,986
<i>Ya... hold it... hold it...</i>

858
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,487
Where is grand mother? Grand mother!

859
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:47,490
What is the botanical name?

860
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:49,993
It is a high breed;
Agriculturists made it a intercaste marriage;

861
01:02:52,529 --> 01:02:53,496
I am a fool!

862
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:58,491
I don't know
what, where, when to talk;

863
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:01,004
For what?

864
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:03,006
In the place I came to see you;

865
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,507
It is my mistake
to speak about Bharathi

866
01:03:06,043 --> 01:03:07,510
To say "yes"
there are 1000 people around me;

867
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:11,014
But I want girl
who is a mixture of fire and art;

868
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:13,516
Barthi is "new girl" you!!!

869
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:18,521
Uncle! You planned
in a big way no?

870
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:20,023
What happened now?

871
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:21,524
I made the plan
in a right way only;

872
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:25,028
But I felt happy
that this chit man left;

873
01:03:25,562 --> 01:03:27,029
But he is again depositing;

874
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,035
I will take you to my world;

875
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,538
There, it is enough if you know to think;
crores will be in your hands;
