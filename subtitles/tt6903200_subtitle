1
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:54,750
Taste the coq au vin!

2
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:00,792
I hope you like it, Cismondi.

3
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,875
But this is not coq au vin!

4
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,958
-Really?
-You taste it.

5
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,292
-No...
-No...

6
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,958
-Call him.
-Excuse me!

7
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:17,958
Yes, sir?

8
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,458
Have you got a new chef?

9
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,333
No, we have the same chef.

10
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,417
I've had this dish here before

11
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,250
but this tastes different.

12
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:31,500
This isn't bad, but it's not what
it should've been.

13
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,667
-Let me take it back to the kitchen.
-Yes...

14
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,292
It was better.

15
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,500
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

16
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,583
The chef...

17
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,333
-It tasted different.
-Your thought...

18
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:47,833
This has been sent back.

19
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,417
What was the problem?

20
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,917
He said,
it doesn't taste like the last time.

21
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:10,875
Who made this?

22
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,417
Who made this crap?

23
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,208
It was me, Chef.

24
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,875
Just as I thought.

25
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:23,792
Come here.

26
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:30,417
I will recommend you to Cafe Figaro!

27
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,625
You'll get double the salary there...

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,708
because you're fired!

29
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,458
What do we do? We cook...

30
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,042
delicious food

31
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,167
which brings back

32
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,375
one's good memories.

33
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,458
That got us two Michelin stars.

34
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,875
Where did all this cooking begin?

35
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,250
From mothers and grandmothers!

36
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,083
Got that?

37
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:02,875
Move aside.

38
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,583
-Bring it.
-Yes, Chef.

39
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,458
How's it?

40
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:26,000
Grandmothers used to serve coq au vin

41
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,500
with this parsley sauce.

42
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,208
Tell the customer
that we have made it again!

43
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,958
Back to work!

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,375
You too. Go!

73
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:32,750
Sim?

74
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:34,917
Sim?

75
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,792
Sim?

76
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:49,958
Sim?

77
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,333
Was it the cake or the ring?

78
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,750
So, tell me, Dev.

79
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,083
What is your answer?

80
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,542
Listen...

81
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,833
This is too sudden, Sim!

82
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,417
Is it?

83
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,458
We haven't really discussed marriage.

84
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,625
You never asked.

85
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,167
So I thought, I will propose to you.

86
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,458
I think I've got your answer.

87
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,333
-It's not like that.
-What is it, then?

88
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,292
Is it because I cannot cook?

89
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:07,792
But I take photographs, I dance...

90
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,708
I am silly because I want to marry you.

91
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:12,167
Don't be silly.

92
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,667
You don't want to marry me?

93
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,542
Perhaps, you prefer Indian girls, right?

94
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,208
I didn't say no.

95
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,375
You didn't say yes either.

96
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,333
I'll keep this with me.

97
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,167
Don't you trust me?

98
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,292
I just proposed to you.
Then, don't I trust you?

99
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,333
But you really cannot cook!

100
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,667
Hey!

101
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,958
Hello?

102
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,375
Yes, tell me.

103
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,792
Yes, I hear you.

104
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,417
Anything else? Tell me everything.

105
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,333
How is she now?

106
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,792
I am coming.

107
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,833
Yes, I'll come.

108
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,333
I'll hang up now.

109
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,125
From India?

110
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,667
Is everything okay?

111
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,833
What is it?

112
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,708
My mother...

113
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,917
Last night...

114
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,458
she had epileptic seizures.

115
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,667
Oh, no!

116
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,625
How is she now?

117
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,250
Still critical.

118
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,292
I'll have to go.

119
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,958
Of course!

120
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:51,917
Should I come with you?

121
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,875
Not now.

122
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,042
Sure.

123
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,667
When will you be back?

124
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,625
Once she recovers.

125
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,833
I will be back, Sim.

126
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,833
This is home.

127
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,500
Home is where you are.

128
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
Of all the days, getting a flat tire...

129
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,708
Do you know what this is?

130
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,750
I'd got it checked just yesterday.
What to do?

131
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,958
The price for nostalgia.

132
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,542
-I'll book an Uber now.
-Two minutes, sir!

133
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,125
-Two minutes, sir.
-Two minutes!

134
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,625
-Hello...
-Is this your 2-minute Maggi noodles?

135
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,125
No spare tire! You're calling in vain.

136
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,750
Such a grand welcome!

137
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,208
Yes, hello?

138
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,042
But it didn't turn out like
what you had shown.

139
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,500
What bread did you use?

140
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,333
Focaccia.

141
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,625
That's why it shrank.

142
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,125
I had said French bread.

143
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,875
Like baguettes. Their crust is harder.

144
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,208
I see...

145
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,083
Right.

146
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,083
What's wrong with your car?

147
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,042
This is what I don't like...

148
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,042
Oh!

149
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,875
Where are you headed?

150
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,625
Medica Hospital.

151
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,958
Medica! We're going the same way,
towards Hiland Park.

152
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,250
-Let us drop you.
-Please... Please!

153
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,750
Come on.

154
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,875
But I'll sit in the front.

155
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,833
That's fine. Come.

156
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,750
Come.

157
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,875
-Get the trolley.
-Yes, sir.

158
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,167
Aunt...

159
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,833
Debu!

160
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,167
-What took you so long?
-Don't ask.

161
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,583
Mom?

162
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,250
She is inside. She was up a while back.

163
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:05,833
Now she is sleeping.

164
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,375
I don't fully get
what the doctors are saying.

165
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,042
Your father knows everything.

166
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,000
Which room?

167
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,042
Room number 621.

168
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,917
But will they let you see her now?

169
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,500
There's the doctor!

170
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,583
-Yes?
-My mother, Mrs. Sen...

171
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,000
Room number 621...

172
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,375
Yes.

173
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,375
We can't allow at this hour.

174
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,417
I just want to see her from the door.

175
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,417
Doctor...

176
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,500
He hasn't seen his mother in 12 years.

177
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,875
That's enough, please.

178
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,250
How's your Ladies' Circle going?

179
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,417
Chugging along.

180
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,583
We do some social work.

181
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,417
It's not just small talk and gossip.

182
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,042
How's dad?

183
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,958
Hard to tell

184
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,542
but he must be worried.

185
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,667
He was at the hospital till evening.

186
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,542
When you called from the airport

187
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,083
he asked me to stay and left.

188
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,375
That's hardly a surprise.

189
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,500
Let go of the past, Debu,
it's been so long.

190
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,542
Twelve years, seven months and 13 days...

191
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,417
Then?

192
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,833
Can you climb the stairs?

193
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:03,750
Yes.

194
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,750
I am used to it.

195
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,208
You go ahead. I'm coming with the luggage.

196
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:11,292
Okay.

197
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,917
Brother-in-law.

198
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,792
Brother-in-law...

199
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,000
Debu is here.

200
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,417
Yes, you mentioned.

201
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,875
No... I mean, he is here. Downstairs.

202
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,333
Biren

203
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:43,250
-help him with the luggage.
-Biren!

204
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,333
Yes?

205
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,458
First get my laxative drink, then go.

206
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,250
Brother-in-law.

207
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,750
What do I do?

208
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,083
But... he is here after so long.

209
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,083
So what?
Should I welcome him with flowers?

210
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,458
You know very well why he had left.

211
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,333
There are a lot of empty rooms here.

212
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,250
He can stay or he can leave.
It's up to him.

213
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,500
He has never cared for my approval.

214
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,958
They are all big fans of yours.

215
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:20,083
And we'll be honored
if you can conduct a workshop.

216
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,167
Actually, I'm... I'm here in the city
because of some personal crisis.

217
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:26,833
If I get time, I'll try.

218
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,042
Please call if you need anything.

219
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,833
Sir. Come on!

220
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,583
What do you want?

221
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:58,958
An interview.

222
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,542
We can do it later.
Maybe at night, after your work?

223
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm here for some personal work.

224
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,667
I won't take long.

225
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,417
I'll only write what you say.

226
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,083
Didn't I just say no?

227
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:22,917
Let's go.

228
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
You left yesterday without informing.

229
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,625
I announced and left once.

230
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,667
Did it help?

231
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,500
Don't worry. I'm living in a plush hotel.

232
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,167
I am comfortable.

233
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,083
Despite having your own home,
you're put up at a hotel.

234
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,500
Ask me what married people
don't do these days!

235
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,667
You're still so old-fashioned!

236
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,917
Let it be!

237
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,042
I could never become a wife!

238
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:54,917
I need not be modern now!

239
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,542
Who will go in first to see Mrs. Sen?

240
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,583
Debu, you go.

241
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,875
Mother...

242
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,125
Dear...

243
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:29,625
Dear, is it you?

244
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,417
Sit.

245
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,042
I am here now.

246
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,375
I thought I'll never

247
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,417
get to see you in person ever again.

248
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,958
I turn the TV on every day,
just to see you.

249
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,167
I see you every day.

250
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,833
Please pass me my glasses.

251
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,042
You look so healthy on TV...

252
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,625
But here, you look so skinny!

253
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,833
You must be starving.

254
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,625
There you are, back in form!

255
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,875
Did you fall sick on purpose?

256
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,708
To bring me here?

257
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,458
Has your room been cleaned?

258
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:03,208
All your clothes are on the top shelf
of the steel almirah.

259
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,542
Don't bother.

260
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,333
-They're all washed.
-Relax.

261
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,500
It's fine.

262
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,292
-Are you here alone?
-Yes.

263
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,500
Why didn't you bring Simon?

264
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,458
It's Simone, Mom!

265
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,500
Won't you stay for a few days?

266
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:24,667
Let's see... It all depends on you.

267
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,708
This trick you've pulled...

268
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,792
Do you remember that fish curry?

269
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,333
How can I not?

270
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,333
Yes, my stomach is all filled up
with that!

271
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,292
Will you cook that for me?

272
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,042
You want to eat fish curry now?

273
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,208
Let me ask the doctors
about your diet, first.

274
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,167
Aunt is waiting outside.

275
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,292
I'll come back in the evening.

276
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,792
-Don't be late.
-Yes.

277
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:57,458
Listen.

278
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,958
Did you speak to your father?

279
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:02,792
Everything's fine, Mom.

280
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:04,750
Everything is fine.

281
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:05,958
Don't you worry.

282
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Bye for now.

283
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:10,708
I just heard that.

284
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,167
-What do you think?
-I think...

285
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,375
Aunt, will you go in?

286
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,167
No, let Sreela visit her.

287
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,167
She has to get back to work.

288
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,583
What is she doing here?

289
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,375
She visits us often.

290
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,292
Comes and chats with your mother.

291
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,958
But, mom never mentioned.

292
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,375
Maybe she didn't want to.

293
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:12,333
I am very sorry.

294
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,375
You must have been very disturbed...

295
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,125
I shouldn't have pounced like that.

296
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,875
You're doing that again!

297
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,083
Sir, we're under a lot of pressure...

298
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,625
Employees in print media
are being laid off.

299
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:27,083
-So, I need something--
-Which language do you understand?

300
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,042
I'll not give an interview.

301
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,792
You just have to answer some questions.
Why are you being so arrogant?

302
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,583
Really?

303
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,542
-He has been following me.
-I see.

304
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,958
Ask your media informers to be cautious.

305
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,667
They may land in trouble.

306
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,208
Come with us.

307
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,667
Yes, I will.

308
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,125

318
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,208

319
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,542
<i><font color="white">-Whatever you say.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">-Why should I say?</font></i>

323

324

<i><font color="white">But I married you...</font></i>

327
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,167
-Can you hear me?
-Perfectly!

328
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:54,875
Did I wake you up?

329
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,375
It's 4 a.m. here, Sim!

330
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:01,125
So sorry... I got really confused.

331
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:05,792
Whether I was ahead or I was behind...

332
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,542
I'm four hours ahead of you.

333
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,542
Sorry again.

334
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,458
-How are you, baby?
-I'm okay, I guess.

335
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,542
Your mother?

336
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:19,375
She's still quite critical.

337
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,792
I see...

338
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,667
She will get better soon.

339
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:30,917
You please go back to sleep.
Do you have a local number?

340
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,083
No. Don't worry.

341
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:34,917
<i><font color="white">I'll call.</font></i>

342
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:37,542
Good night.

343
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,583
Good night, Sim.

344
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:43,500
I love you.

00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:23,875
<i><font color="white">In the air around me</font></i>

358
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,458
<i><font color="white">I go back to my house everyday</font></i>

359
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,583
<i><font color="white">But I don't get to return home</font></i>

360
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:37,750
<i><font color="white">Adopt me, if you can</font></i>

361
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,958
<i><font color="white">Let me hold your hands and run away</font></i>

362
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,750
<i><font color="white">To a faraway land</font></i>

363
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:48,667
<i><font color="white">Let me carry you with me</font></i>

364
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,167
<i><font color="white">Deep in my heart</font></i>

365
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:55,333
<i><font color="white">Let me hold your hands and run away</font></i>

366
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,083
<i><font color="white">To a faraway land</font></i>

367
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:02,458
<i><font color="white">Let me carry you with me</font></i>

368
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:07,750
<i><font color="white">Deep in my heart</font></i>

369
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,958
This is Mrs. Sen's CT scan.

370
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,292
And here is the tumor.

371
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:17,292
This is what had caused
her epileptic seizure that night.

372
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:20,792
In medical terms, we call it meningioma.

373
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:26,083
This develops in the tissues
between the skull and the brain.

374
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:31,708
Are you saying that Mina has brain cancer?

375
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:36,208
The tumor might not be cancerous.

376
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,125
Meningiomas are usually benign.

377
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,167
What do you mean by "try"?

378
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:48,375
It is much easier to remove a tumor
from other parts of the body.

379
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,250
Due to the blood-brain barrier

380
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,667
there's a considerable
amount of risk involved.

381
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,792
The tumor has invaded
such a part of her brain

382
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,042
that there could be a risk of death.

383
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:08,083
And what if we don't go for operation?

384
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:11,625
Then her seizures will keep recurring.

385
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,417
She'll lose speech...

386
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,375
But what if it is removed?

387
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:24,042
There is a slight possibility
of a relapse.

388
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,458
Now you all need to decide

389
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,375
whether to go for the surgery
or to wait and watch.

390
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:59,875
-Hey... when did you come in?
-Just now.

391
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,958
Why didn't you wake me up?

392
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,958
Whom is this for?

393
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,083
This?

394
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,542
For a little boy.

395
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,708
For how many more days
do I have to be here?

396
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,625
It has been so long!

397
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:19,000
All this lying around is killing me.

398
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:24,125
And your father doesn't say anything.

399
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,667
But I know

400
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:29,125
he must be having
a tough time managing on his own.

401
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,250
Think of it as a vacation.

402
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,292
When was the last time
you went on a vacation?

403
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,458
I think, when I was in school.

404
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,708
Yes...

405
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,583
I...

406
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:44,708
Where all had we gone to?

407
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,250
Ranikhet...

408
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,208
-Lucknow.
-Lucknow!

409
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:50,083
From Lucknow to Nainital.

410
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,583
-And then, Ranikhet.
-Yes, Ranikhet.

411
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:00,292
Do you remember my horse riding?

412
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,625
Yes! How can I forget that?

413
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,958
You'd given me such a hard time!

414
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:12,167
And in that bungalow
we were staying in Ranikhet...

415
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,292
There was this sudden power failure
and someone

416
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,958
-was there in the bushes...
-Yes.

417
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,292
...with a torch.

418
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,917
And you were in tears, scared!

419
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,083
My silly boy!

420
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:29,000
But I am not taking a holiday
in this hospital, anymore.

421
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:34,958
After all these years, you're at home,
in Kolkata, and I'm here!

422
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:38,417
My dear, please take me home.

423
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,417
Fine, then. As you wish.

424
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,042
But then I'll be gone!

425
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,500
You're blackmailing me!

426
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,083
The doctor wants you to stay here
for a few more days. Listen to him.

427
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,458
Watch TV, read books... Time will pass by.

428
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:59,792
Yes, as if! Rubbish!

429
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,292
What about my fish curry?

430
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,375
Won't you cook it for me?

431
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,750
You stay here... and I'll make it for you.
Deal!

432
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,375
It has to be just like
how you had made it.

433
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,250
Same taste!

434
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:17,625
Mind it.

435
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,625
Slow down...

436
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,417
And no cream in the dal.

437
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,000
Or else, I'll send the food back.

438
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,375
I ordered simple food.

439
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,000
I'll also eat. Haven't eaten all day.

440
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,083
How is your Bengali so good?

441
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,667
You have been abroad for long!

442
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:58,708
-Has your interview begun?
-No. I'm really curious!

443
00:37:58,792 --> 00:37:59,875
Oh, okay.

444
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,917
I'd watched the film <i><font color="white">Agantuk</font></i> as a kid.

445
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:08,708
Satyajit Ray's films and Tagore's songs...
were staples in the house!

446
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,875
Like in most Bengali homes.

447
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,208
So, there was this dialogue
by Utpal Dutt...

448
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,375
"You can forget your mother tongue
in a day

449
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,583
or never ever forget it!"

450
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,208
This line stayed with me.

451
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,917
And so I kept at it...

452
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,833
There was no one to speak Bengali with.

453
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:32,708
But I kept at it.

454
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,250
Just like with human faces.

455
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,208
The faces you haven't seen
for a while, you forget.

456
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,917
And you have to recall them
to remember them.

457
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,875
Palash, tell me something...

458
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,792
You're here for my interview.

459
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,792
What do you know about me?

460
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:02,917
Not much, to be honest.

461
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,500
Maybe, as much as everybody else does.

462
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,625
You are a Kolkata boy who quit his
engineering job and became a chef.

463
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,958
You've a huge eatery in Paris,
with two Michelin stars.

464
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,750
One in New York, with one Michelin star.

465
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,833
You do cookery shows on TV,
write food columns in newspapers.

466
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,625
You've a French girlfriend...
And suddenly, you are back in town.

467
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,375
You can't write why I am here.

468
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,750
Or that I'm staying in a hotel.

469
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:33,875
Is that fine?

470
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,542
Let's start, then.

471
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,000
-No, let's eat first.
-Yes.

472
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,583
Sorry for the mess.

473
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,917
Actually, I was thinking of conducting
that workshop.

474
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,583
A session with your chefs.

475
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,583
You don't have to be grateful.
But I need your help.

476
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:08,583
Sure.

477
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,750
I need access to your kitchen.

478
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,583
Aren't you liking our food?

479
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,458
No, it's not that.

480
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,750
I've a project going.
I need to try something.

481
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,333
To make fish curry.

482
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:26,500
Fish curry?

483
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,750
Bengalis and fish curry are synonymous!

484
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,542
It will be done.

485
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,833
I'll not teach you guys how to cook.

486
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,875
This is no masterclass

487
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:41,500
and jotting down some recipes
will not get you anywhere.

488
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,375
You all are working in such a big hotel...

489
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,208
You all are achievers already.

490
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:50,958
But the thing is...

491
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,667
You all cook.

492
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,500
And I'm sure, you cook well.

493
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,667
But are you starting a conversation
with your cooking?

494
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,250
Is there an ethos, a thought,
a personality emerging from that food?

495
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,583
How will you do it?

496
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,292
You need to put yourself on the wok
to make the best dish.

497
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,625
Your secret recipe is you.

498
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:28,625
Biryani with beer...

499
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,375
Cheesecake with chutney...
Add all you want!

500
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:34,917
It won't be good initially.

501
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,042
You will fail.

502
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,250
And you'll learn through your failures.

503
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:45,250
And those eating that food, will find you.

504
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,583
That's their answer.

505
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,208
They'll recommend it to others.

506
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:06,333
And that is how both your food and you
will find the identity

507
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,167
you all are looking for.

508
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,000
Now, you all start a conversation with me.

509
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,083
Each of you will be given a basket.

510
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,833
All baskets have the same ingredients.

511
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:21,917
You need to cook something.

512
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,750
You can use one or all the ingredients.

513
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,833
But the reward?
A chance in your Paris restaurant?

514
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:29,167
Maybe.

515
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,250
For now, I have a surprise for the winner.

516
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,458
You have an hour to cook
and here are your ingredients.

517
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,125
Here they are...

518
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,625
Pumpkin, banana flower, peanuts

519
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,125
coconut, lime, chicken

520
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,333
pineapple and date palm jaggery.

521
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:00,292
How's it going?

522
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,542
It has to be thicker.

523
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:10,875
It is...

524
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,542
You don't have...

525
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,417
-How is it?
-You tell me.

526
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:11,542
Aunt has gone in.

527
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,500
How is your father?

528
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,167
He passed away four years back.

529
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,125
I was unaware.

530
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,542
It's okay. How could you have known?

531
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,875
Where are you staying now?

532
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,958
In the same house on Kailash Bose Street.

533
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,083
Living in such a big house
all by yourself... Isn't it tough?

534
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,292
I've rented out the second floor.
I live on the third.

535
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,875
Still...

536
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,458
All these years...

537
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:03,542
-Are you coming here from office?
-No... School.

538
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:07,875
You did your B.Ed.
in the first year of our marriage.

539
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,542
-History?
-Yes.

540
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,042
Which school?

541
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,833
Narayana School, Rajarhat.

542
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,125
<i><font color="white">With Sreela, I was at fault.</font></i>

543
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:24,792
<i><font color="white">May not be fully, but I am to be blamed.</font></i>

544
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:29,583
<i><font color="white">Dad got us married</font></i>
<i><font color="white">soon after I got my engineering job.</font></i>

545
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
<i><font color="white">I was 26 and Sreela 22.</font></i>

546
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,958
<i><font color="white">We both were introverts</font></i>

547
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:39,542
<i><font color="white">and yet to come to terms</font></i>
<i><font color="white">with our arranged marriage.</font></i>

548
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:44,500
<i><font color="white">We did get to know each other a bit</font></i>
<i><font color="white">in the three years that we spent together.</font></i>

549
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:48,083
<i><font color="white">But we could never become friends.</font></i>

550
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:50,708
<i><font color="white">Take the stool away.</font></i>

551
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,917
When you decided to leave for Paris

552
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,458
didn't you think of taking
your wife along?

553
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,542
I knew I'd have to struggle a lot.

554
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:15,458
And I didn't want to, knowingly,
throw her into that struggle.

555
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,750
And it did happen.

556
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:23,125
Even after the course at Le Cordon Bleu,
I had to start out as a dishwasher.

557
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,708
Then the job of frying potatoes in a cafe.

558
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:29,917
I made French fries for a long time.

559
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:32,917
Then a saucier!

560
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,208
Whisking sauces all day.

561
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,667
It's been quite a struggle.

562
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,458
Wouldn't your wife's company
have made it less difficult?

563
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,208
Maybe.

564
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,250
Perhaps...

565
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:06,125
Hey, Sim!

566
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,542
Hello, Melanie.

567
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,750
How's it going here?

568
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,500
Like a party without a DJ.

569
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:17,458
-Well, he's playing in Calcutta!
-He calls to find out if all's okay here.

570
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:20,333
Did he mention when he is coming back?

571
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:21,958
Didn't he tell you?

572
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:39,917
Hello, Dev, guess where I am!

573
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:42,750
I've mailed you something.

574
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:47,333
-When?
-Just now.

575
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:49,667
It's the CT scan of my mother's brain.

576
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,875
I need you to show it to Dr. Maurice.

577
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,167
What's happened?

578
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,417
She's got a tumor in the brain.

579
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:01,917
Should I come over?

580
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,750
No, this is not a good time.

581
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,458
If you can check with Dr. Maurice...

582
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,208
Okay, I'll do that.

583
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,167
You take care, Dev.

584
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:58,833
This happened with me too.

585
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,292
In fact, I was sent back home.

586
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,833
And since then, I've never been late.

587
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,792
Come in.

588
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:14,667
But nobody's told me anything
about your project.

589
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:17,083
So, I don't know what I'll have to do.

590
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,708
Are you fine with Earl Grey?

591
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:28,708
This tea is called London Fog.
With Earl Grey, milk and vanilla.

592
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,250
I fell in love with it in Paris.

593
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,875
It is a slightly acquired taste.

594
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,125
Addictive, if you take to it.

595
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:45,833
What you cooked yesterday...
Was it your invention?

596
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,208
That Pish-Pash?

597
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:50,000
-Is that what it's called?
-Yes.

598
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:51,458
My grandmother's recipe.

599
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,500
I would always want that.

600
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:01,125
Even after her,
whenever I used to make it for myself

601
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,458
it felt like home.
It felt like my grandmother's recipe.

602
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,000
My mother used to cook fish curry for me.

603
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:18,625
Flavors from the vegetables,
the spices, the fish...

604
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,917
Actually, I was a very weak kid.

605
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:27,083
Used to fall sick all the time.

606
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,667
And mom used to make me that.

607
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:31,833
I used to work like tonic.

608
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,958
One day, my mother fell sick.

609
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:48,458
I was about 13 or 14 then.

610
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:52,667
I don't know what took over me...

611
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,500
I got into the kitchen

612
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:58,458
and made a bowl of fish curry
within an hour!

613
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,750
That was my first experience.

614
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:07,750
I remember mom saying
that if I keep cooking...

615
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,458
I'll earn a lot of blessings.

616
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:13,125
Not really...

617
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,542
But, if not for that day,
I wouldn't be here today.

618
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:24,500
So, we are going to make that fish curry.

619
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,000
That fish curry?

620
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:28,750
That 25-year-old fish curry.

621
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:31,958
You have the recipe?

622
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:36,000
Mothers and grandmothers
never wrote them down.

623
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,167
And I kept that tradition alive!

624
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:43,000
Once you get into a recipe book,
you'll never create anything new.

625
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:45,750
But I hope you remember the recipe.

626
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:49,833
Once we start, I'll be able to.

627
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,167
Yes, but this hotel supply won't do.

628
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:05,833
We'll get it.

629
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,667
-What if we don't?
-Let's see.

630
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:18,875
Get it down!

631
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,292
-Is it colored?
-Just a little.

632
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:26,250
Yes.

633
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,958
-These?
-Yes, take them.

634
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,750
-Come on now!
-Hey!

635
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,167
That's fine.

636
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,250
Two cups. The fish now.

637
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,500
-<i><font color="white">Katla</font></i>?
-The ones...

638
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,458
Hey, give me first.

639
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,167
-For curry?
-Yes.

640
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,417
Right away!

641
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,375
Final?

642
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:04,417
Remove the chili.

643
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:38,167
It's nice.

644
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:42,958
But...

645
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,958
This is not like that.

646
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:51,500
But I tempered cumin seeds...
put cumin and coriander powder...

647
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,458
But it's not what you had made!

648
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,458
I don't know what went wrong.

649
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,375
Are you sure it was <i><font color="white">Katla</font></i> fish
and not Rohu?

650
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,750
We never brought Rohu at home.
My father only ate <i><font color="white">Katla</font></i>.

651
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:22,500
I'm sure he still does.

652
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,000
Then what about the powdered spices?
Both coriander and cumin?

653
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,000
Maybe neither.

654
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,208
Maybe it was cauliflower,
not pointed gourd.

655
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:38,875
Maybe it needs to be sweet and sour.
With tomato, sugar, peas...

656
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,917
Let's try a new combination tomorrow.

657
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:50,708
By the way, what's happened to your mom?

658
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,708
I think you're getting late.

659
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,583
So, am I fired
or should I come back tomorrow?

660
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,125
Sharp at 7, tomorrow.

661
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:29,667
Hello, Sim.

662
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,500
<i><font color="white">Give me a moment.</font></i>

663
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:38,792
<i><font color="white">I haven't seen you in such a long time.</font></i>

664
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,125
-<i><font color="white">How are you, Dev?</font></i>
-I'm okay.

665
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:48,625
-Did you speak to Dr. Maurice?
-Yes, I did.

666
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,958
He said you should remove the tumor.

667
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,667
Or she'll be like a vegetable soon.

668
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:02,417
But if the operation is successful

669
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:05,125
she'll be fine for the rest of her life.

670
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,250
But at her age, it's risky.

671
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,083
-Thank you.
-<i><font color="white">Are you in a hotel?</font></i>

672
01:00:10,667 --> 01:00:13,375
Yes. I'll explain to you later.

673
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:18,500
-<i><font color="white">And what are you having?</font></i>
-Chocolate Mousse.

674
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:22,792
-I thought you didn't like chocolate.
-Just a change of taste.

675
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:24,500
When will you return, Dev?

676
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,875
As I said, as soon as mom is okay.

677
01:00:31,292 --> 01:00:33,833
-<i><font color="white">You never ask me how I am.</font></i>
-How are you?

678
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:37,875
I'm not okay... I can't lie to you.

679
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:42,292
Everything is empty without you.

680
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,542
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

681
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,708
Come back once she has recovered.

682
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,208
<i><font color="white">I'm cooking everyday.</font></i>

683
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,292
I love you, Sim.

684
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,375
Sim...

685
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:32,875
Try this one.

686
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,958
This is completely different.

687
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,167
Did you add asafetida?

688
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:52,292
The sweetness and ginger are going well.

689
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:58,667
But this is not what you had made.

690
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,083
Something is missing.

691
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:11,542
Fine, tomorrow,
we'll try to make it together.

692
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:14,875
What do you mean?

693
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,833
I heard I'll be discharged tomorrow.

694
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,750
Your father has spoken to the doctor.

695
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,083
Hasn't he told you anything?

696
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,417
Yes...

697
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,375
Yes, he has.

698
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,708
Why is mom being discharged
from the hospital?

699
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,167
The reason she was admitted for,
has been taken care of.

700
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,625
How can you say that?

701
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,375
Don't you remember what the doctor opined?

702
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:05,792
If the tumor isn't removed,
those seizures will keep recurring.

703
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:09,042
Doctors say things like that.

704
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,000
By pronouncing healthy people sick

705
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,208
they suck out more money
in the name of treatment.

706
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,458
This is what happens here.
Not sure about France.

707
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,750
No, I've spoken to a doctor in Paris.

708
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,000
He is of the same opinion.

709
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,292
The tumor needs to be removed.

710
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Or all her nerve functions will stop.

711
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,500
And what if she dies during the surgery?

712
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,208
Who takes such a risk?

713
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:40,333
Every operation has a risk factor.

714
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:44,708
This is about the brain...
I agree it is riskier.

715
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,833
But we should try to get mom cured!

716
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,583
You need not!

717
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,167
Minu will come back home tomorrow
and lead her routine life.

718
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,792
Doesn't her son have a say in this?

719
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,958
You suddenly wish to play son
after 13 long years?

720
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:07,833
You lost all your rights
when you walked down those stairs!

721
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,625
Taking chances!

722
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,250
It's fine that you've come
to see your mother.

723
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:23,542
But don't do anything more.

724
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,083
Watch out.

725
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,500
I was asked to come today.

726
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:37,833
I was asked...

727
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:40,292
Come back...

728
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,750
-Who's come to meet me?
-That man there.

729
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:44,875
This is unfair...

730
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,042
Okay, let me see.

731
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,750
What are you... doing here?

732
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:01,875
Sreela, I need some advice.

733
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,042
Advice from me?

734
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,542
Tell me.

735
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,833
Not here. Can we go, sit somewhere else?

736
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:24,417
-Sorry, I had to make a call.
-That's fine.

737
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,292
Perhaps you don't know...

738
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,417
but mom has a tumor in the brain.

739
01:06:38,667 --> 01:06:39,750
What!

740
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,667
But I heard she was getting
discharged from the hospital.

741
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,375
That's what dad wants.

742
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:55,833
He doesn't want to do anything...

743
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,250
Doesn't want to take any risk.

744
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,208
I think we should go for operation.

745
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,458
What does she want?

746
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,750
She hasn't been told.

747
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:18,833
This sounds just like how a few men
in the White House

748
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:23,125
took all the decisions
about women's maternity care.

749
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,667
Ask her what she wants.

750
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,458
Ask mom?

751
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:34,083
Yes. It's her life. She should decide.

752
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:37,875
Why should her husband or son
take decisions on her behalf?

753
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:41,792
She is very much in her senses.
She can decide judiciously.

754
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,167
If you can't tell her, I will.

755
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:50,500
No... I'll tell her.

756
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,500
<i><font color="white">Mom.</font></i>

757
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:07,583
<i><font color="white">I'm making your tea...</font></i>

758
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,000
<i><font color="white">and also some fish croquettes.</font></i>

759
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:13,417
<i><font color="white">I haven't put raisins in yours.</font></i>

760
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:21,917
<i><font color="white">Do you want to say something?</font></i>

761
01:08:26,542 --> 01:08:28,375
<i><font color="white">Don't feel like doing this job anymore.</font></i>

762
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:31,708
<i><font color="white">The letter from Le Cordon Bleu</font></i>
<i><font color="white">is sitting on my desk...</font></i>

763
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:36,083
<i><font color="white">And here I am...</font></i>
<i><font color="white">stuck with this rubbish job.</font></i>

764
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:38,708
<i><font color="white">Don't do it then. Quit.</font></i>

765
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,000
<i><font color="white">Really?</font></i>

766
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,333
<i><font color="white">Don't just go by what I'm saying.</font></i>

767
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,000
<i><font color="white">It's your life. You should decide.</font></i>

768
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:56,958
<i><font color="white">What your father or I or Sreela want...</font></i>

769
01:08:58,375 --> 01:08:59,833
<i><font color="white">You may hear everyone out...</font></i>

770
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,792
<i><font color="white">but what matters is what you want.</font></i>

771
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,750
<i><font color="white">You have to do the work.</font></i>
<i><font color="white">If you don't like it...</font></i>

772
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:10,292
<i><font color="white">why should you do it?</font></i>

773
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:13,625
<i><font color="white">You've never spoken like this before.</font></i>

774
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:19,917
<i><font color="white">Have you ever come asking like this?</font></i>

775
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,042
<i><font color="white">Never.</font></i>

776
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,083
<i><font color="white">I know...</font></i>

777
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,375
<i><font color="white">You were too scared of your dad.</font></i>

778
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:35,083
<i><font color="white">As a kid, I too had dreams</font></i>
<i><font color="white">of becoming a dancer.</font></i>

779
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:38,417
<i><font color="white">And I too could never tell my father.</font></i>

780
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:40,875
<i><font color="white">Why?</font></i>

781
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,958
<i><font color="white">That fear.</font></i>

782
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,833
So, you could quit
because your mother supported you?

783
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,125
My mother gave me the courage
to choose my own path.

784
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:56,125
I had never done that before.

785
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,667
For us Bengalis, our careers
are decided when we're toddlers.

786
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,292
Study science
and become doctors or engineers.

787
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:10,667
It's all monotonous regularity!
No escaping it.

788
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,042
Students, in thousands,
pass engineering every year...

789
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:20,708
throw all of them into a ring
and watch the circus!

790
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,875
Your mom knew you cooked really well.

791
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,333
She knew

792
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,208
that I really loved cooking.

793
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:39,708
Where's mom?

794
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,125
They are getting her ready.
Your father is downstairs...

795
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:50,708
Please wait outside. I'll get her.

796
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:53,458
I need to talk to her.

797
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,250
I'll just get her.

798
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,125
You give us a minute.

799
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,167
What?

800
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:09,750
Are you leaving?

801
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:11,875
No.

802
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:15,000
Then, what is it?

803
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:17,917
Sit down.

804
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:24,833
What's wrong?

805
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,583
Mom, there's a tumor in your brain.

806
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,167
If it is not removed

807
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,958
you'll start forgetting things.

808
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:46,167
You'll not be able to move your limbs...

809
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,917
not be able to recognize us or talk to us.

810
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,542
The operation is risky too.

811
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,875
Actually, the tumor is clinging
on to the brain tissues.

812
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,542
Anything can happen during the surgery.

813
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,125
But if it's successful,
you'll be absolutely fine.

814
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,792
Will the operation cost a lot?

815
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,833
No. The cost is no factor.

816
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,708
Then, why am I being taken back home?

817
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,458
Wouldn't it have been better
if I went back home after the operation?

818
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:41,583
Wait. Let me go and get everything sorted.

819
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:01,875
Sreela?

820
01:13:03,042 --> 01:13:04,375
She's inside.

821
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:07,750
I'll go and call her.

822
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,458
It's you?

823
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,875
Go inside and finish your homework.

824
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:54,375
It's Sunday, hope your school is closed.

825
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,417
So I thought, you would be home.

826
01:13:58,458 --> 01:13:59,375
Why? What happened?

827
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:03,875
Mom has agreed to get operated.

828
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,375
In fact, the operation is on Thursday.

829
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:10,792
Thanks for your advice.

830
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:13,792
What time on Thursday?

831
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,208
At ten in the morning.

832
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:18,625
Fine. I'll be able to make it.

833
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:24,458
Are you very busy now?
We can go and have lunch together.

834
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,333
Not today. Some other day.

835
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:30,667
Who's that boy?

836
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,792
That boy... He is here, studying.

837
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:38,875
He comes to me for home tutorials.

838
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:44,042
I get it.

839
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:48,458
I'll take your leave, then.

840
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:09,500
What's the real reason?

841
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,875
I said we're celebrating.

842
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,542
But you said the operation is on Thursday.

843
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:21,875
But that the operation is happening...

844
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:30,333
Got it? You won't.

845
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:34,083
Never mind.

846
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,208
What did you learn by sneaking around?

847
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:40,958
Sneaking around?

848
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,292
You don't need it.

849
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:01,167
This name, Maggie, won't do.

850
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,625
What kind of a name is that?

851
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:10,083
Maggie, a fine dining Chef? No...

852
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,500
What did your parents name you?

853
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:18,417
I never tell that to anyone.

854
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,375
Whoa! You're so ashamed!

855
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,875
But you are a bold cook!

856
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:31,375
What name can be worse than Maggie?

857
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:33,792
Matangini.

858
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,750
This is why I don't tell anybody.

859
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:56,375
After all the wine-drinking in Paris

860
01:16:56,958 --> 01:17:00,083
these trashy Indian whiskeys
are doing nothing to me.

861
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,250
Yes, stop here.

862
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,042
So soon?

863
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,625
Are you sure you'll be able
to return to the hotel safely?

864
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,083
I am not the one driving.

865
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:24,417
-Mister, please drop him to the hotel.
-<i><font color="white">Sure.</font></i>

866
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:25,625
I smell care.

867
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,375
Can you smell it?

868
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:32,542
I've been smelling care
since the very first day.

869
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:37,500
-Now I wish to smell something more.
-Oh, God!

870
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:41,458
Could you hear that?
Matangini is in wild mode again.

871
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:51,250
Let's go.

872
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:58,167
-Where exactly are we going?
-<i><font color="white">To the hotel, sir.</font></i>

873
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:00,625
No!

874
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,375
Let's go to my house first.

875
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:06,375
<i><font color="white">Where, sir?</font></i>

876
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:09,542
Take a U-turn.

877
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:23,625
No! This is not just your house.

878
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,458
This is my mother's house as well.

879
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,792
Yes, this is my mom's house as well,
not yours alone.

880
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,833
Where are you?
Where are you, Bishwaranjan Sen?

881
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,167
Sorry... I didn't see.

882
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:44,917
Sir... Sir... Mr. Bishwaranjan!

883
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,292
-Yes, call your boss.
-Sir!

884
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,833
-What happened? What...
-Sir!

885
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,917
What's going on at this hour?

886
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,958
Here you are.
You don't have to hold court tonight.

887
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,708
Be my audience. Take your seat.

888
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,792
It looks like your kingdom...

889
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,083
has been devastated.

890
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,375
Once I had left this house...

891
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,708
Today your wife... only wife...

892
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,250
She has refused to come back home.

893
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:28,292
You're drunk and blabbering, Devdatto.

894
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,500
The one who served you...

895
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:37,708
Never asked anything for herself...

896
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:41,625
You didn't even try to get her cured!
How strange!

897
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,375
You know the reason.

898
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,417
You are the reason for everything you do.

899
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:54,125
All you think about is yourself.

900
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,083
Whether it's your son's life
or your wife's...

901
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,458
You've never cared to know what they want.

902
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:02,583
It's always about you and only you.

903
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:05,667
Drunken rants in the middle of the night!

904
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:07,250
Mala, ask him to leave.

905
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,708
I'll leave. Don't worry, I'll leave.

906
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,833
I had left.
And that's why I'm standing here today.

907
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:16,208
Or else, I would be rotting in this house.

908
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:19,417
-Just like mom is!
-Stop... Stop, Debu.

909
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:21,542
-What wrong did I say?
-Keep mum.

910
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,417
All your reports look fine.

911
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,667
So, we'll do the operation on Thursday.

912
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:36,917
I've become your fan of sorts.

913
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:42,500
-Doctor, I have a request to make.
-Tell me.

914
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:48,167
The nurse said, my head would need
to be shaved off for the operation.

915
01:20:48,917 --> 01:20:52,083
I used to have lots of hair once...
Now it's down to this.

916
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:55,667
But I do love my hair.

917
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,167
Your hair won't be touched.

918
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:02,958
We'll just make a small drill
and get the surgery done.

919
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,375
You mean, a hole in the head?

920
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:09,042
It's nothing. You won't even realize.

921
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,917
You'll go to sleep in the morning
and wake up in the afternoon.

922
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,958
-Only if all goes well.
-Of course, it will.

923
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:18,958
Let me take your leave now.

924
01:21:25,125 --> 01:21:27,125
Dear, come, listen...

925
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:36,167
-Tell me.
-My vault keys

926
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:39,417
are inside the locker of my steel almirah.

927
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:42,000
All my jewelry is there...

928
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:43,708
Why are you saying all this, Mom?

929
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:47,958
Look, none of us know
what's going to happen post Thursday.

930
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,000
What if I can't tell you then?

931
01:21:57,875 --> 01:21:59,000
Better tell dad...

932
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,750
I haven't been staying in that house.

933
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,583
Couldn't you father and son

934
01:22:09,917 --> 01:22:13,083
make up for my sake at least?

935
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:22,000
I know I'm never going to see

936
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,125
the two of you together in my lifetime.

937
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:31,125
And once I'm gone
even the last ties would get severed.

938
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:41,833
Anyway...

939
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:46,250
Where is my fish curry?

940
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,458
Didn't have time to make it today.
I woke up late.

941
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:54,042
Tomorrow's Tuesday
and it's Wednesday the day after.

942
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:56,250
You have two days in your hand.

943
01:22:57,208 --> 01:23:00,167
Let's see if you can cook me
that fish curry.

944
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:05,542
-We need <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>!
-<i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>?

945
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:08,500
-Dried lentil dumplings.
-We'll get them in the market.

946
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,667
-The ones mom makes.
-The ones your mom makes?

947
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:17,042
-We'll have to steal them!
-Steal! From where?

948
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,042
From my house.

949
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:23,042
I'll never go there...
Not after last night!

950
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:26,958
-Last night... What?
-You'll have to steal them.

951
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:58,292
-Yes?
-Do you have <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i> at home?

952
01:23:58,958 --> 01:23:59,833
<i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>?

953
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:02,917
We're planning to launch
a new variety in the market.

954
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:07,375
And we'll exchange your old ones for new.

955
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:12,708
Okay. You wait. Let me check.

956
01:24:31,042 --> 01:24:34,833
What is it? At this time of the day...

957
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:39,083
-It's about <i><font color="white">Bori</font></i>...
-<i><font color="white">Bori</font></i>?

958
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,750
Yes. Here it is...

959
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:46,542
We're giving you two <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>
for every one of your old ones.

960
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,125
No, we don't eat <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>
sold in the markets.

961
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,542
Our homemade ones taste better.
You can leave now.

962
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,000
Who says so?

963
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:58,375
No one needs to say. We know.

964
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:01,625
We simply can't go by what you say.

965
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:09,292
Now, how to explain...
The smell suggests enough.

966
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,792
Biren, can you please go and fetch
the big jar of <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>?

967
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:20,708
So, you survive by selling <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>?

968
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,042
No, I eat them to survive.

969
01:25:26,792 --> 01:25:29,000
-Biren...
-Here it is.

970
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:33,375
-Here you go.
-Yes, hold this, please.

971
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:35,542
Smell for yourself.

972
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:42,125
Homemade <i><font color="white">Boris </font></i>are the best.

973
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:46,875
Mom's special <i><font color="white">Boris</font></i>!

974
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:51,667
Why do you need to go there?

975
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,292
In case I ever need to...

976
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,792
Okay, listen...

977
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:06,125
When the son of the house becomes a cook,
all the doors close.

978
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:07,667
What do you mean?

979
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,042
<i><font color="white">Dad...</font></i>

980
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:24,292
<i><font color="white">Tell me.</font></i>

981
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:29,292
<i><font color="white">I have quit my job.</font></i>

982
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,125
<i><font color="white">What does that mean?</font></i>

983
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,708
<i><font color="white">I want to do the Cordon Bleu course.</font></i>

984
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:39,708
<i><font color="white">What is that?</font></i>

985
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,000
<i><font color="white">It's a cooking course.</font></i>

986
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:45,750
<i><font color="white">You've quit your job to learn cooking!</font></i>

987
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:49,000
<i><font color="white">I wasn't feeling like</font></i>
<i><font color="white">doing that job anymore.</font></i>

988
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,750
<i><font color="white">You didn't even bother asking me once</font></i>
<i><font color="white">before quitting?</font></i>

989
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:58,125
<i><font color="white">After the course, I want to become a chef.</font></i>

990
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,458
<i><font color="white">My son will go and cook in hotels!</font></i>

991
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:08,125
<i><font color="white">I spent so much money on your education</font></i>
<i><font color="white">all these years for you to become a cook?</font></i>

992
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:11,333
<i><font color="white">And now you've come to inform me!</font></i>
<i><font color="white">You feel no shame?</font></i>

993
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,375
<i><font color="white">What will people say?</font></i>

994
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,458
<i><font color="white">Our family tradition...</font></i>

995
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:19,708
<i><font color="white">Our Nabakusum brand hair oil</font></i>
<i><font color="white">is still so popular!</font></i>

996
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:22,875
<i><font color="white">And you want to become a cook?</font></i>

997
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:24,833
<i><font color="white">Shame!</font></i>

998
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:41,917
After all he's your father.
You could have made him understand.

999
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,500
Yes, I could have explained

1000
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:47,958
that being a chef
doesn't mean cooking at roadside eateries.

1001
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:52,000
But still, I would have had to explain

1002
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:56,542
to all those who apply our hair oil.

1003
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:04,792
So, it was better that I started
my new life rather than explaining it.

1004
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:08,125
I left everything and took off!

1005
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,000
This is my <i><font color="white">Bori</font></i>!

1006
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,750
How did you get it?

1007
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:27,625
How is it?

1008
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:35,833
It's fine... Not bad.
I see that you've added broad beans.

1009
01:29:39,042 --> 01:29:41,083
But it's still not like that, right?

1010
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,625
Are you feeling bad?

1011
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:52,667
Listen!

1012
01:29:53,292 --> 01:29:55,250
Forget that old curry

1013
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:58,583
and make something new.

1014
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:04,292
What were the spices you had used...
what were my chosen ingredients

1015
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:09,042
forget all that and make something fresh,
something from the heart.

1016
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,292
We'll eat it together, tomorrow.

1017
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:24,958
Oranges in fish curry!

1018
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:36,625
Being sure has never helped me.

1019
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,792
When I had made this as a 14-year-old...

1020
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,083
I couldn't have been sure.

1021
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:45,250
After all these years,
if I've to play safe

1022
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:46,833
that would be really sad.

1023
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,667
As if there's a party in my mouth.

1024
01:31:49,917 --> 01:31:51,667
It's easy to hum a familiar tune.

1025
01:31:52,167 --> 01:31:54,333
With a new tune, it's awkward at first...

1026
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,500
and then it wins you over.

1027
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:01,417
It's the same feeling with a new taste.

1028
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:05,667
You've completely changed
the playlist of my life, Chef.

1029
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:12,875
Life always adapts,
hops from one tune to another.

1030
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:32,208
This is wonderful!
It's really great today.

1031
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:36,833
Where is your plate?
You have it from here.

1032
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:42,458
Try this.

1033
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,500
Tell me. How's it?

1034
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,167
But I didn't make this 25 years back.

1035
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:56,500
The one you made 25 years back,
that I had last week itself.

1036
01:32:57,625 --> 01:32:58,458
I didn't get you.

1037
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,917
The first day you cooked me the curry...

1038
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,167
It was the very same taste!

1039
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,708
But that day you refused!

1040
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,208
If I had told you it was as good

1041
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:14,125
would you've made it for me again?

1042
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:19,583
And would you have come up with
something this incredible?

1043
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:23,958
Kids lie to their mothers all the time.

1044
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:27,208
But this will surely win you
Mother of the Year!

1045
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:37,708
But, dear...

1046
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:41,667
I also wish to be honest with you today.

1047
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,250
What'll happen
in the operation tomorrow...

1048
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,375
None of us know.

1049
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:56,500
I've lived a lot many years...

1050
01:33:58,792 --> 01:34:00,000
So I am not tense.

1051
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:03,250
But if something does happen to me...

1052
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:08,417
What I'm about to tell you now...

1053
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:13,750
no one will ever tell you.

1054
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,250
What is that?

1055
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:24,417
When you had left Sreela behind...

1056
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,667
it wasn't just Sreela you left behind.

1057
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:34,542
I had promised Sreela...

1058
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:38,375
that I'd never tell you this.

1059
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:44,458
I'm not asking you to do anything.

1060
01:34:45,667 --> 01:34:50,750
I just felt that you deserved to know.

1061
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:31,750
-What are you playing?
-Cricket-tennis.

1062
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:36,458
-What is your name?
-Ved.

1063
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,250
Ved...

1064
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:46,458
Ved...

1065
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,667
Mom, the man who had come the other day.

1066
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:04,458
Get me tea from the grocery shop.
It's over.

1067
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:07,750
-All right.
-Tell them to charge it to my account.

1068
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:20,042
Tell me what you have to say.

1069
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:23,208
Why didn't you tell me about my son?

1070
01:36:25,917 --> 01:36:28,333
You had forgotten about me at that point.

1071
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,792
If I had told you, I was pregnant,
you could've asked me to abort the baby.

1072
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:36,417
Is this how you feel I am?

1073
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,000
I could never know you.

1074
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,625
But I definitely didn't want to use
the baby as a bait to hold you back.

1075
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:52,042
It was my decision
to bring him into this world

1076
01:36:53,042 --> 01:36:54,625
to raise him, and to live for him.

1077
01:36:57,708 --> 01:36:59,792
Why should you bear the burden
of my decisions?

1078
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:05,542
So, don't I have any rights over my son?

1079
01:37:07,917 --> 01:37:10,208
Are rights born out of a few sperm cells?

1080
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:20,083
You can go to court to claim your rights.

1081
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:23,833
We can fight a custody battle over Ved
for a few years.

1082
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:29,667
But... do you really
have any claim over him?

1083
01:37:33,292 --> 01:37:37,833
You belong more to your
French girlfriend with whom you live in.

1084
01:37:38,417 --> 01:37:40,333
With whom you've spent so many years...

1085
01:37:40,417 --> 01:37:42,792
With whom you've shared
your joys and sorrows...

1086
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:48,875
I don't know about your plans, Devdatto.

1087
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:53,208
But before you go back this time,
do start the process of our divorce.

1088
01:37:56,667 --> 01:37:59,167
If you ever plan to marry her...

1089
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:05,083
Otherwise, another set of Sreela and Ved
will be born.

1090
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:15,958
Ved is getting tea.
Have some before you leave.

1091
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:32,167
Sreela... come, sit here.

1092
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:35,042
Sir, please sign here.

1093
01:38:35,417 --> 01:38:36,250
What's this?

1094
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,875
What's that?

1095
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:41,500
-If something happens to her...
-I get it.

1096
01:38:47,042 --> 01:38:48,208
Palash!

1097
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:56,625
-So?
-Ever since I got to know

1098
01:38:56,708 --> 01:39:00,250
-about her surgery, I wanted to come.
-Good you came.

1099
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:02,917
Has my interview come out?

1100
01:39:04,583 --> 01:39:06,208
Actually, I could not submit that.

1101
01:39:08,833 --> 01:39:12,083
You had told me everything.
I didn't want all that to come out.

1102
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:16,333
-But what about your job?
-Let's see what happens.

1103
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:19,583
Can't be selling your life to save mine.

1104
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:25,625
I have an idea. There's something...

1105
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:29,542
that will find more takers
than my interview.

1106
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:33,792
A recipe.

1107
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:37,583
I never write down recipes.
So they've never been printed.

1108
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:40,125
I made a special fish curry
for mom yesterday.

1109
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,792
I'll give you that recipe, you publish it.

1110
01:39:45,917 --> 01:39:47,875
She's asking for you and him.

1111
01:39:55,792 --> 01:39:57,833
They've given some medicine...

1112
01:40:02,167 --> 01:40:03,833
I cannot...

1113
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:09,500
just keep my eyes open.

1114
01:40:10,208 --> 01:40:11,833
Must be a sedative.

1115
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:14,375
You'll not feel a thing
during the operation.

1116
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:18,917
-Yes.
-Why did you call for us?

1117
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:24,042
Mom

1118
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:27,292
what did you want to say?

1119
01:40:31,292 --> 01:40:35,708
Wanted to see the two of you
together once.

1120
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,208
Dear

1121
01:40:46,542 --> 01:40:48,500
come over to your father's side.

1122
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:06,875
Just once, dear, come over to his side.

1123
01:41:11,625 --> 01:41:13,250
Just for once, dear.

1124
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:32,958
Does it look okay now?

1125
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:18,542
Sim.

1126
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,958
I thought you'd never be back!

1127
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:35,333
I said I would be back once mom is fine.

1128
01:43:38,333 --> 01:43:39,167
I'm sorry.

1129
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:41,250
Has the cooking got any better?

1130
01:43:42,792 --> 01:43:43,958
Not really.

1131
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:48,083
Oh, no! What if you never improve?

1132
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:53,292
I can't wait anymore.

1133
01:43:54,083 --> 01:43:55,375
Enough is enough.

1134
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:38,875
<i><font color="white">Fish Curry</font></i>

1135
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:44,875
<i><font color="white">Fish Curry</font></i>

1136
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:46,458
Hang on...

1137
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:51,875
Smear the <i><font color="white">Katla</font></i> fish pieces with salt
and turmeric, and fry them in hot oil.

1138
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,167
{\an8}Make sure not to overcook them.

1139
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:02,542
{\an8}On a separate pan,
put little oil and add the ginger paste.

1140
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:08,292
{\an8}Keep frying till the raw smell is gone.

1141
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,792
{\an8}Now add the tomato puree.

1142
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:15,958
{\an8}<i><font color="white">The gastronomic pampering...</font></i>

1143
01:45:16,042 --> 01:45:18,000
{\an8}You can also use chopped tomatoes.

1144
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:21,500
{\an8}Your curry will look great
right from the start.

1145
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:25,500
{\an8}<i><font color="white">This is what keeps us sailing...</font></i>

1146
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
{\an8}Next, add all the powdered spices.
Chili, cumin, coriander, turmeric...

1147
01:45:30,167 --> 01:45:34,500
{\an8}And fry them well.
Keep stirring the mixture.

1148
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:37,833
{\an8}Are you doing it right?

1149
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:42,417
{\an8}Now, add a cup of water.
Once it starts boiling

1150
01:45:43,667 --> 01:45:45,000
{\an8}add sugar and salt to taste.

1151
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:49,500
{\an8}Fish and sugar go really well together.
I love my fish curry sweet.

1152
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:52,208
{\an8}Now add the fried fish pieces.

1153
01:45:52,292 --> 01:45:54,333
{\an8}Keep it covered for a few minutes.

1154
01:45:54,417 --> 01:45:58,958
{\an8}Why should you do all the work yourself?
Let it cook on its own for a bit.

1155
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:02,292
{\an8}<i><font color="white">No, will I be able to do it?</font></i>

1156
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,625
{\an8}Now comes the fun part.

1157
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:07,667
{\an8}Open the lid and add the orange juice.

1158
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,417
{\an8}Add some green chilies and <i><font color="white">Garam Masala.</font></i>

1159
01:46:14,792 --> 01:46:16,417
{\an8}Don't cook for too long.

1160
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:19,250
{\an8}You must never overcook orange juice.

1161
01:46:22,875 --> 01:46:24,458
{\an8}Now, serve it in a bowl

1162
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:28,708
{\an8}and garnish your dish with curry leaves
and pieces of orange.

1163
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:32,750
{\an8}Invite everybody and treat them
to your Orange Fish Curry.

1164
01:46:32,958 --> 01:46:36,083
{\an8}You've never tasted a fish curry
like this one before. It's very good!

1165
