1
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,838
Listen,

2
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,240
Business isn't great.

3
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,174
Whatever l earn isn't
enough to pay the workers

4
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,039
or the moneylenders l owe.

5
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,239
So please be generous with me!

6
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,839
Lord Vigneshwar!!

00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:17,185
Team DrC

8
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,531
Dear John,

9
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,963
l've just opened the shop.

10
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,195
Don't come here
asking for money!

11
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,067
l already told you
what l had to say!

12
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,243
Vijayan,

13
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,108
you came to me asking for money.

14
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,975
And l have come here
for that money!

15
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,572
So shouldn't we have some
respect for each other?

16
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,484
Sit.

17
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,278
Sit down man!

18
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,126
l don't know if it's
because l'm rich.

19
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,128
All these guys respect me.

20
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,028
But luckily l have
respect only for money!

21
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,131
John,

22
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,567
You took almost double of the
original amount from me as interest.

23
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,159
l won't pay anymore!
This business is over!

24
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,171
So there's neither money
nor respect for me?

25
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,709
Bringing someone else's cash into
our own pocket is called business!

26
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,772
lt's an art, isn't it?

27
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,680
What's the point in
being furious about it?

28
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,583
You're trying to teach me business?
You son of a b##Ch!

29
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,580
Chase all these rascals away!

30
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,521
Let me see if l can
do business here!

31
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,260
Get out!!

32
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:05,234
Team DrC

33
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,578
'Kali'
(Rage)

34
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:33,542
Team DrC

35
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,293
Dad, just go check
what happened.

36
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,210
What?

37
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,438
Rent..
l haven't received it yet.

38
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,916
Hey,
it's not urgent.

39
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,420
You can give me later.

40
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,431
Anjali..

41
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,363
l saw her leaving
from here in tears.

42
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,797
Errr.. l was just saying..

43
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,442
My God!

44
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,312
What is this?
Scaring people?

45
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,215
You got scared, didn't you?
- l'm not scared!

46
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,651
Anyway you've decided to go..

47
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,055
So l thought l'll
drop you till there.

48
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,623
Oh!

49
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,401
So you came to drop me?

50
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,368
You needn't!

51
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,164
l know how to go there myself.

52
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,144
Can you slow down, please?

53
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,080
l can't even utter a word.

54
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,052
You lose your temper
at the drop of a hat!

55
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,597
- Leave him Matthukkutty,
he loses his temper easily.

56
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,240
ls it?

57
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,208
You lose your
temper easily, huh?

58
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,567
Let me see!

59
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,025
- What happened?

60
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,326
Didn't you hear me?
l asked you what happened?

61
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,363
l.. l fell down..

62
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,365
Tell me the truth.
Did someone hit you?

63
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,662
Gosh. What happened, son?

64
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,733
Stand up.

65
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,101
What happened?

66
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,571
That Mathukkutty hit me, mom.

67
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,273
Aren't you ashamed
to come here crying..

68
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,108
after being beaten up
by those wastrels?

69
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,668
Why are you shouting at him?
Go ask those kids who hit him.

70
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,812
Hey Krishnadas!

71
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,245
You should raise
your child well.

72
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,280
Come here.

73
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,774
Did you see his nose?

74
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,046
lt was smashed by your dear son!

75
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,620
lf this happens again, l
won't be reacting like this.

76
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,609
l'm telling you!

77
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,093
Come here!

78
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,487
You won't play here anymore.
Did you hear that?

79
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,094
Whom are you staring at?

80
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,373
Leave the cane!

81
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,110
Get out from here!

82
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,203
Don't enter my class ever again.

83
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,053
l called you so many times last night.
And your line was busy.

84
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,020
Where were you?

85
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,037
Leave me!

86
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,773
Siddhu, those guys hit me!

87
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,117
Aren't you ashamed to cry
after getting beaten up?

88
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,219
Hit them back!
- l...

89
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,186
Hit them!

90
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,214
Catch them!

91
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,873
Close the gates!

92
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,138
Move!

93
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:56,454
Team DrC

94
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,527
Where's Sunny?

95
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:08,740
Come here.

96
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,308
Hit him.

97
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,299
l said, hit him!

98
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,942
Finish them!!

99
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,644
You think you're a hero seeing
all these cheers and applause?

100
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,980
Hitting people in campus
is not so heroic!

101
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,010
lt's better to beat up people
than being beaten up, right?

102
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,815
l'm scared.

103
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,256
When you start reacting violently for
every damn thing, it really scares me.

104
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,895
We're in that volatile age, right?

105
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,724
lt will change gradually.

106
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,831
Keep in mind that you're
in your final year.

107
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,670
You should pass in your exams.

108
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,303
And then get ajob.

109
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,997
l don't think my dad
is going to agree.

110
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,809
For what?

111
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,511
To marry you!

112
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,043
Why?
You don't want to?

113
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,317
Do l?

114
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,820
l do, l do!

115
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:44,364
Team DrC

116
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,045
Move!

117
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,552
There she is.

118
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,418
All the best!
- l'll come in the evening.

119
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,523
What, man?

120
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,730
What happened?

121
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,964
My dear bro,

122
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,437
l sold that property for the
minimum rate l could get.

123
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,973
l didn't try to make any profit.

124
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,077
l don't think real estate business
would be worthwhile anymore.

125
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,548
Of course!

126
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,148
Why are you taking it?

127
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,085
Who are you to make
me wait like this?

128
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:18,963
Hey..
See..

129
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,156
He's here.
- We should teach him a lesson.

130
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,760
What happened?

131
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,918
l don't know!
Who's this?

132
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,155
Falling down just like that?

133
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,432
Get up.

134
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,877
Don't get people talking.

135
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,174
Take a decision regarding this.

136
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,883
And don't think you can
come home after that.

137
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,814
Who's this?
- Dad!

138
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,423
Give them the garlands.

139
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,843
Anjali!

140
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,756
You don't be tensed
about all that now.

141
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,090
Everything will be alright!

142
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,752
Shouldn't we sleep?
Anjali is waiting.

143
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:18,040
Team DrC

144
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,781
Are you married?

145
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,827
Yes!

146
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,673
You're new here?

147
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,741
l'm Prakashan.

148
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,765
Sidharth!
- See you around.

149
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,790
Hey.. Hey.. l'll...

150
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,121
l'll pay this time.

151
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,626
The bank deducts a fees.

152
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,334
lt's all gone with that.

153
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,962
You're saying the same thing again!
l want my money back.

154
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,199
There's only 900 left.
- l don't want to know all that.

155
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,707
l don't want anything else.
l just want my money back!!

156
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,611
1 minute.

157
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,288
Nothing, Sir.

158
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,735
How are you?
- Fine!

159
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,957
Anjali!

160
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,221
Nothing is in it's
place in this house!

161
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:35,405
Team DrC

162
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,116
Won't even respond!
- Started in the morning itself?.

163
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,727
How else will it be!

164
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,127
You pick up junk from all over
the place and bring it home!

165
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,464
What junk?

166
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,129
Where's the car key?

167
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,295
Why are you so furious forthat?

168
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,996
Can't you search calmly?

169
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,231
l wasn't furious.

170
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,034
l just asked where
the car key was.

171
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,153
Got late?
Me too..

172
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,528
Which one should l
fill to deposit cash?

173
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,052
- Bro, can you give me your pen?

174
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,330
Yellow!

175
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,530
Bro, pen. l'll give it right back!

176
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,396
Deposit this, son.

177
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,439
Don't deposit all of it
into this chequebook.

178
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,541
Deposit half on this book
and half on this ATM card.

179
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,032
All the money in your account can
be accessed by the ATM card.

180
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,080
l don't want that. People at home
will take all the money carelessly.

181
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,445
My daughter's son Basheer.

182
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,914
He is quite notorious.

183
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,450
And, can you make a system where you can
withdraw only 500 if you enter 1000?

184
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,381
There's no such system here.

185
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,922
- Then what kind
of a bank is this?

186
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,316
Let me see if l can find a
bank with such a system!

187
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,119
Wow! lt's working again!
See...

188
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,100
What is it, Prakashan?

189
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,567
l was just testing it.

190
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,237
lt's working.

191
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,904
Have you seen the other
end of this sheet?

192
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,070
Where is it?
- What the..

193
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,079
Take it and get lost!

194
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,215
What, man?

195
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,952
What is it, brother?

196
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,548
lt's not working..

197
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,455
Use this..
- Thanks brother.

198
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,461
Hey sir..

199
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,360
Account number has only 8 digits.

200
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,193
But to fill it, there
are 14 columns.

201
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,368
Even if l write from left
to right or right to left,

202
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,632
5 columns are still empty.
What should l do?

203
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,566
You just write your account
number there, Sir.

204
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,301
Oh! That's all?
Ok fine! l shall.

205
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,629
'Please do not use
mobile phones here.'

206
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,241

207
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,543
l just came to the bank.

208
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,635
l'll call you back.

209
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,903
Bloody hell..

210
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,149
Sorry Sir. l have a lot of work.

211
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,217

213
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,416
Sir, you can go to the next counter.
Please!

214
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,081
You can go there.

215
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,319
- You can have him!

216
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:16,930
Team DrC

217
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,502

Sir, my work is over.

220
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:26,978
Here you go!

221
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,487
l'm leaving.

222
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,094
Go man!

223
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,164
Hey..

224
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,029
That FD customer had
actually come to me.

225
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,466
lt was me who sent him to you.
You should remember that!

226
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,968
You didn't even treat us
when you bought your car.

227
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,607
l'm just reminding you.

228
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,268
Dude, just tell me
what you have to say.

229
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,672
You don't have to
hit me for that.

230
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,233
Can't even touch you or what?
Sorry!

231
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,349
Overtime, is it?

232
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,657
Good going!

233
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,092
What is it, Ma'am?
- Come, sit.

234
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,191
l bought this for you.

235
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,107
What plans for the evening?

236
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,786
lf you're free, we
can plan something.

237
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,529
l'm a little busy today, ma'am.
We'll plan this another day.

238
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,464
Why doesn't she call me!

239
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,279
How come you're so
busy in the evening?

240
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,718
So tall, but good for nothing!

241
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,689
Team DrC

242
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,221
Have you left the office?
- Yes.

243
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,254
l'm at City Centre.
Can you come here?

244
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,488
Why are you there?
- Shopping.

245
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,241
l've reached.

246
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,208
Where are you?

247
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,672
l'm on the 3rd floor.

248
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,107
At the 'ln' Store.

249
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,186
Can we have 2 minutes if you don't mind?
- l do mind!

250
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,318
What kind of a man is he?
So arrogant!

251
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,608
Why isn't she looking!

252
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,746
Let me check there.
- Ok madam.

253
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,649
Ah. She has turned.

254
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,358
Come, let's go!

255
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,135
Oops! That's her husband?

256
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:40,838
l'm screwed!

257
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,672
lt was a busy day at the bank.

258
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,377
Some customers drive us crazy.

259
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,311
And by evening, my mood
is completely spoilt!

260
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,273
Let's get back home.
l'll make your mood alright!

261
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,520
l don't know how l
brought it till here.

262
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,426
Driving isn't meant for me.

263
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,393
You drive.

264
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,262
You'll learn only if you drive.

265
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,264
lf you keep skipping it,
you'll never learn.

266
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,925
Drive without fear.
l am with you, right?

267
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,497
That's exactly why l am scared!

268
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,562
lf you stare at me like that, l'll lose
even the little confidence l have.

269
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,823
lf you want me to drive, you
should be really patient.

270
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,425
Don't get angry.

271
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,928
Okay. Don't worry.

272
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,470
You start the car.

273
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,596
l won't get angry.

274
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,416
Start the car.

275
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,343
Release the clutch slowly.

276
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,491
Careful!

277
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,992
Be careful.
Didn't you see him?

278
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:08,959
No!

279
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,820
Press the clutch.

280
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,997
Press the clutch and
shift the gear.

281
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,333
lsn't this the brake.. l
mean, isn't this the clutch?

282
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,434
That's the brake!

283
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,401
There's a car behind..

284
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,736
You almost hit him.

285
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:20,938
Okay, drive.

286
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,707
The car is not driving you.
You are driving the car!

287
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,302
That's all you need to know!

288
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,610
Which gear are you on now?

289
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:33,784
Which gear?

290
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,284
l don't know!
- You don't know?

291
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,521
Don't you know it's the
2nd gear from it's sound?

292
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,947
Shift the gear.

293
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,986
lt's bad for the car!

294
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,822
Press the clutch fully
and shift the gear!

295
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,019
Why are you getting angry for that?
Didn't l tell you that l'm not driving?

296
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,492
l didn't get angry!!

297
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,669
There's a car right behind you!
What nonsense?

298
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,676
Where?
Anjali?

299
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,281
Are you blind?

300
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,716
This is not rocket science!

301
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,822
Start the car, press the clutch fully,

302
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,721
shift to first gear, and drive!

303
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,700
There's not much work needed, Sir.

304
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,431
lncluding service tax, it's coming
up to around Rs.12,000 only.

305
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,705
Your documents are
all correct, right?

306
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,447
l will claim the
insurance for you.

307
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,891
My master has gone mad!!

308
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,493
My master has gone mad!!

309
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,106
So you can decide the
prices yourself!

310
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:06,736
Since my master is mad, you can choose
the price for whatever you buy!

311
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,047
Master has gone mad?

312
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,590
So this Assistant Manager
is hitting on you, huh?

313
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,686
Will you be promoted soon?

314
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,120
lf she goes on like this,
she'll have her way with me!

315
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,529
l'll kill you!

316
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,398
You..

317
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,078
Can't you change this
ringtone, Anjali?

318
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,181
There you go!

319
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,115
You were waiting to pick
on something, is it?

320
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,820
Pick up the phone, Anjali!

321
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,662
Who is it?

322
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,429
That's some pervert.

323
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,964
He's so jobless!

324
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,133
Let me talk to him.

325
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:04,998
God! That'll be an
even bigger problem!

326
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,127
l'll tell you when l
want you to talk to him.

327
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,849
Why don't you chew a little louder?
- Of course!

328
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:52,005
Team DrC

329
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,901
Mom!

330
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,095
Has Siddharth left?

331
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,464
He is just getting ready.

332
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,639
Tell me mom. What's happening?
- There's a good news!

333
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,004
l called to tell you that.

334
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,041
A good alliance
has come for Aju.

335
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,668
Ourfamily & close relatives
have to go to their place.

336
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,471
We haven't fixed the date yet.

337
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,140
You'll come with
Siddharth, right?

338
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,250
Of course!

339
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,242
Mom, l'll call you later.

340
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,743
And yea..
- Yes?

341
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,652
Can you ask papa to call Siddhu?

342
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,159
Here.

343
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,253
Okay dear. l'll tell him.

344
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,464
Okay mom!

345
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,100
Sheesh!

346
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,003
l'll fix it right away!

347
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,868
lt was mom on the phone.

348
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,103
A marriage proposal
has come for Aju.

349
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,743
To fix it, she has
called us both home.

350
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,116
Your dad is still
furious with me, isn't he?

351
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,776
We should definitely go!

352
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,746
That will put an end
to dad's anger.

353
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,587
You haven't come to
Masinagudi yet, right?

354
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,949
We'll go to Ootty also after that.

355
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,856
l'll think about it.

356
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,865
Did you put on that perfume?

357
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,303
A little!

358
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,099
Hey, l was just testing it.

359
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,640
Don't be upset, my girl!

360
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,113
What the...

361
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:24,928
Team DrC

362
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,137
Customer care has received some
complaints from your desk.

363
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,367
You should pay some more attention
to relationship with customers.

364
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,745
Or it will affect your career.

365
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,022
Your car is ready.

366
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,264
Sir, since your car has
only third party insurance,

367
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,768
you can't claim even
a single penny!

368
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,633
You will have to pay
the entire amount!

369
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,709
Why are you so happy about it?

370
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,841
l'll lose my job if l don't smile
while talking to customers, Sir.

371
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,227
- lf you do it right now,
you'll lose only 30,000.

372
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,258
- 30,000?
- Yes, sir.

373
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,220
Do you want some coffee?
- No!

374
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,899
Gosh!

375
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,191
The power's gone.

376
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,771
What?

377
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,836
We'll leave then.

378
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,008
See you Anjali.

379
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,337
Juice..
- Hey.. lt's fine.

380
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,146
Okay then.

381
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,816
Shall we leave?
Come Chuppu. Let's go.

382
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,180
Such a loser you are!

383
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,483
Did you see that?

384
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,526
He..

385
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:37,861
He's a brat!

386
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,487
You asked for it!

387
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,552
Congratulations!

388
00:41:44,902 --> 00:42:00,842
Team DrC

389
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,480
There's no point
reading all this.

390
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,786
Now you don't even differentiate
between kids and elders.

391
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,098
You heard what that fellow
said while he left, right?

392
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,065
Big deal.

393
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,992
You only want to find faults
with me all the time!

394
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,161
At least you have
someone to do that.

395
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,994
lt's not that l'm not trying..

396
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,556
Sometimes, l just lose it!

397
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,839
l know..

398
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,508
That you're not doing
all this on purpose.

399
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,237
And that you don't
like doing it.

400
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,467
But only l know that..

401
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,409
Others may not understand
your situation.

402
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,474
lf you understand,
that's enough for me!

403
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:08,619
No!

404
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,314
You can't go on like this.

405
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,613
l don't like you being this
bad guy to everyone else.

406
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,227
This fury of yours
should go away.

407
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,660
Only you can take an
effort to do that.

408
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,095
We need everyone, right?

409
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,241
All of them?

410
00:43:47,725 --> 00:44:07,636
Team DrC

411
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,095
Now you can look at
each other and smile.

412
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:25,768
Team DrC

413
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,835
Got late?
-A little.

414
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,728
All of them are inside.
- Okay.

415
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,229
Where's that woman who
gave you the perfume?

416
00:48:55,465 --> 00:49:08,139
Team DrC

417
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,275
The one in the black saree.

418
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:12,949
Where?

419
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,481
With a tattoo on her back..

420
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,959
She's a little aged right?

421
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,891
But doesn't look like it.

422
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,530
Don't make me talk!

423
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,934
Her stupid tattoo..

424
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,507
Why are you standing
here all worked up?

425
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,272
Go have something to eat.

426
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,511
lt's free! And you'll get
this again only next year!

427
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:50,917
l can't even say that?

428
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,550
Did you introduce her
to Smitha ma'am?

429
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,027
Huh?
- No!

430
00:49:59,029 --> 00:49:59,996
Shall l?

431
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,397
l shall!

432
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:02,826
You'll be in a fix!

433
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,267
Bye sister.

434
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,280
Has it been long since you came?

435
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,517
No. We just reached, ma'am!

436
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,830
l'll introduce you to
all ourfriends here.

437
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,753
Are you confused
seeing the spread?

438
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,879
What confusion?

439
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,786
You haven't eaten since morning
to hog at this party, right?

440
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,615
Carry on!
Good going!

441
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,092
Where's the ice cream?

442
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,618
Are you bored?

443
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,155
l knew it!

444
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:37,960
What happened?

445
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,163
l have to go to Masinagudi.

446
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,755
There's a function
at my wife's place.

447
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,162
Did you elope and get married?

448
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,003
Doesn't look like it.

449
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,772
lsn't he really short-tempered?

450
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,409
How do you tolerate him?

451
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,070
You must be having
a lot of patience!

452
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,681
You're here?

453
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,144
That's why she got scared
and stopped talking.

454
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,387
Okay then!

455
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:05,655
See you!

456
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:07,854
Did you eat something?

457
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,925
Go eat, man!

458
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,652
What did he say?

459
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,703
We have to leave early
in the morning.

460
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,399
l haven't packed any bags.
Shall we go?

461
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,067
We've come here anyway..

462
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,574
We'll have dinner and leave.
Come!

463
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,541
l'm hungry!
- Me too!

464
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,679
You start. l'll just come.
- Okay.

465
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,150
Want to join for some drinks?

466
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,021
No. l'll leave soon.
- Are you sure?

467
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,682
l have to drive.
- Oh okay.

468
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,222
Siddhu, it's my daughter's
first birthday next Sunday.

469
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,450
We're giving a small
treat, at home.

470
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,926
You should come with your wife.

471
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,756
He's really happy to
go for others' party!

472
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,198
l have been behind him for a
treat ever since he bought a car.

473
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,136
And he hasn't, till date!
Must be making a whole lot of savings!

474
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:00,741
Enough!

475
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:04,240
l have told you many times
not to hit me while talking!

476
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,079
Why can't you get
it into your head?

477
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,888
What did l say?

478
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,856
Leave it.

479
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,050
l just asked for a treat.

480
00:53:42,419 --> 00:54:08,337
Team DrC

481
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,080
Which son of a b@#ch is not
getting sleep at this hour?.

482
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,093
What?

483
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,650
Cat got your tongue?

484
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,786
Talk, you rascal!

485
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:05,801
Hello dear?

486
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,746
Anjali, is there a problem there?

487
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,339
Mom, Siddhu thought
it was someone else.

488
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,886
There's this guy who keeps
calling and troubling me.

489
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:23,887
ls it?

490
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,787
Siddhu picked up without
checking the number.

491
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,849
l'll give him the phone.

492
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,028
l don't want to talk.

493
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,723
Ask them to start early
if they're coming.

494
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,025
Papa called to ask
if you had started.

495
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,697
Okay mom.
l'll call you.

496
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,107
Are you happy now?

497
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,409
How would l know that
it was your dad!

498
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,875
Even if it wasn't him,
you will abuse, is it?

499
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,039
No one has to help me by
abusing or hitting people!

500
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,111
l can't bear this anymore!

501
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,184
What to do! l have
always been like this!

502
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,787
l know to behave like this only.

503
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,790
You eloped with me
knowing all this, right?

504
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,193
lf you can't bear me anymore,
you don't have to stay with me!

505
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,160
You can decide!

506
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,691
So that's the solution
for all this?

507
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,191
lf l also leave you, then..
- Nothing will happen!

508
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,297
What will happen if you leave me?
Will l die?

509
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:12,696
l will live alone!

510
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:13,895
Stay only if you want to!

511
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,004
Get out!

512
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,312
No!

513
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:30,004
Team DrC

514
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,345
Are you ok?

515
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:40,976
Siddhu, be careful!

516
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,552
Siddhu, no!! Please!

517
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,592
Siddhu, stop the car!
Please!

518
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:06,475
That bloody..

519
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,280
Shut up Anjali!

520
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,417
Stop!

521
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,164
Stop, you swine!

522
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,598
'Saccharine'

523
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,075
Siddhu, l'm scared!

524
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,234
Hold on tight!

525
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,649
Didn't you see what he did?

526
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:56,919
For my sake!

527
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,015
For my sake!
Let him go!

528
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:28,811
You are hopeless!

529
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,010
Didn't you see him take the
wrong side of the road?

530
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,183
So?
You should teach him a lesson?

531
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,478
What if something had happened?

532
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,592
You have a reason
for everything.

533
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,163
l can't go on with such
a short-tempered person.

534
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,598
l want to live peacefully.

535
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:20,785
Team DrC

536
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,774
l'm hungry.

537
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,744
Why didn't you tell me while
we were passing that town?

538
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,848
There won't be anymore
shops on the way now.

539
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,344
Where are you going?

540
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:11,706
To Masinagudi, Sir.

541
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:13,908
Where are you coming from?

542
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,718
Kochi, Sir.
- Ok. You can go.

543
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,413
Sir, is there any
restaurant nearby?

544
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,382
lf you go straight from here,
there's one nearthe highway.

545
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,608
Hey. That's the restaurant.

546
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,689
Wash your hands.
Come.

547
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:37,693
Should we eat here?

548
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,298
l'm really hungry!

549
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,611
The headlight's on!

550
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:30,545
Team DrC

551
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,539
This rooster is so restless!

552
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:02,851
Savithri,

553
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,755
Hey Chakkara, your
rooster is in form, huh?

554
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,882
Let him have fun till it lasts!

555
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:10,881
What did he say?

556
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,693
What for?
To pick a fight with him?

557
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,557
He didn't say anything.

558
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,903
Where the hell were you?

559
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,700
Can't you see that there
are customers here?

560
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,003
- l was here only, master.
l didn't go anywhere.

561
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,611
- When you called me,
l was in the toilet.

562
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,636
- lf you can't, quite
yourjob and leave!

563
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,442
- You should work properly
as long as you are here!

564
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,779
- Won't listen to anything!
Just keeps yapping all the time.

565
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,946
- Didn't l ask you
to clean that table?

566
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:41,623
Get lost!

567
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,820
l didn't go anywhere, master.

568
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,961
l went to get water
since you asked me to.

569
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:46,928
- Moron!

570
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,828
- Useless!

571
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,706
Shall we leave?

572
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,074
lts okay.

573
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,537
There won't be anymore
hotels on the way.

574
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,635
We'll leave after
eating something.

575
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,601
Brother, what food do you
have here?

576
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,693
What do you want?

577
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,670
What do you have here?

578
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,102
Tell me what you want.

579
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,402
Dosa?
- We don't have Dosa.

580
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:33,542
Chappathi?

581
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,010
No Chappathi as well.

582
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,739
Then what do you actually have?

583
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:38,838
Only Parotta.

584
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:41,744
Why didn't you say that earlier?
lnstead of making us ask!

585
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,149
Brother, two plates of Parotta.

586
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,848
And any curry would be fine!

587
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,717
Then why didn't you say this earlier?

588
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,897
Why did you get angry at him?
- What else should l do?

589
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,455
Didn't you see his attitude?

590
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,063
You can expect only so
much from such a hotel.

591
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,468
We have come here for dinner.

592
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,671
And not to teach manners
to the people here.

593
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,407
There you go!

594
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,608
Advising again!

595
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,114
Just keep it there.

596
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,217
Brother, do you have
something to drink here?

597
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,551
What do you want?

598
01:09:58,627 --> 01:09:59,795
Do you have juice?

599
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,195
Yea. We have juice,
tea, soda, cola..

600
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,058
What do you want?

601
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,225
Anything is fine.

602
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,697
Brother, two pineapple juices.
Fresh, please.

603
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:11,072
Fresh, right?

604
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,139
This place is so filthy.

605
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,145
l'm really hungry.
Eat only if you really want to.

606
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:07,963
You sit here.

607
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,253
Hey Savithri!

608
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,798
What is it, Chakkara?
- Come!

609
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,907
Hey!

610
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,409
What is this?

611
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,345
Brother, there's something in it.
- What?

612
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:34,408
Oh. ltsjust a fly!

613
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:59,504
Team DrC

614
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,420
We shouldn't have come here.

615
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,155
We'll leave quickly.

616
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,158
l have to use the restroom.

617
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,455
Okay. Come fast.

618
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,108
The bill.

619
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,876
l can't even show my
face to my friends, bro!

620
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,987
What to do!

621
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,155
Deduct Rs.80 from this bill.

622
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,300
Yes, Sir?
Did you say something?

623
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,332
Deduct Rs.80 from this bill
& tell me the final amount.

624
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,469
Dude, just check this. How much
does he want us to deduct?

625
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,439
80 Rupees.

626
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,378
Sir, there're no such discounts here.
That too, Rs.80? No way!

627
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,174
Every Rupee is precious!

628
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,350
lnterest rates are at 30%% now..

629
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,011
l didn't drink that
pineapplejuice.

630
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,319
l asked you to
deduct it's price.

631
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,816
Bill for something you didn't drink?

632
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,150
Hey Mani?
- Yes!

633
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:27,328
Can't you check these bills properly?
He says he didn't have the juice!

634
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,458
l've only added the rates
of whatever he ordered!

635
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,896
ls it my fault if
he didn't drink it?

636
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:34,899
l had even changed it for him.

637
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,500
lsn't it fair to pay for what
you ordered, Sir?

638
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,845
l won't pay a rupee more than
the price of what l had.

639
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:45,973
Don't be angry, Sir. lt's not our
fault if you didn't like it, right?

640
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:49,951
lt'll be quite difficult for you to leave
from here without paying the bill.

641
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:50,985
Right, John?

642
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,055
Are you threatening me?

643
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,454
Then l dare you to
get it from me!

644
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,118
Chakkara, he is furious!

645
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,556
You do one thing.

646
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,027
You had enough food, right?

647
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,796
You don't have to pay.
l'll excuse it. You can leave.

648
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,164
Are you kidding me?

649
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,340
l don't want anything
for free from you!

650
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,035
Tell me the exact amount.

651
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,335
lf you're paying, you will
have to pay the whole thing.

652
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,217
Siddhu,

653
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,122
Just pay the bill.
Let's leave.

654
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:49,571
Do you have any cash?

655
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,936
Oops! l haven't taken my purse!

656
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:53,948
How can you leave home
without taking your purse?

657
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,278
Why are you getting angry at me?
Where's your money?

658
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,579
That landlord asked me
for rent while l was leaving.

659
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:01,587
l gave him all the cash l had.

660
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,083
What do we do now?

661
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:06,662
Chakkara,

662
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,357
l think he's in a fix.

663
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,293
Me too, John!

664
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:16,300
You're always quite excited when you
see such young girls, Chakkara.

665
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:20,232
l'm young at heart, John!
- Yea right!

666
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,283
We don't accept cards here, Sir.

667
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,222
We aren't that advanced yet.

668
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,894
l don't have cash.

669
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,898
Didn't l tell you
that you needn't pay?

670
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,360
See, that poor girl
is sweating there.

671
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,473
ls there any ATM nearby?

672
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,377
Why are you still angry, Sir?

673
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,643
ls there an ATM nearby, Chakkara?

674
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:05,218
lf it's such a matter of pride for
him, let him pay & then leave!

675
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:08,488
There is one ATM nearby.

676
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,150
Just 2 kms ahead on this road.

677
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:17,932
Then so be it.

678
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,100
You go and come back.

679
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:28,242
Come!

680
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:35,343
Team DrC

681
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,381
How can you leave
already, Sir?

682
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:07,240
What guarantee do we have that
you'll come back once you leave?

683
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:12,019
What do you think, Chakkara?

684
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:14,249
l'm not so sure, John.

685
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,081
lf he's not sure, l'm not too.

686
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,660
Let him do one thing.

687
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,425
Let him go and come back.

688
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,695
Till then, she can be here.
- Yea! That's good!

689
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,671
You're quite clever, Chakkara!

690
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,696
Why? Doesn't look like it?
No!!

691
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,415
He's removing his watch, John.

692
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:54,091
No, Sir. There's no
need for all that.

693
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,662
Don't treat us like cheapos.

694
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,196
l trust you.

695
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,593
So you can go & come back.
And she will be safe here.

696
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,480
Don't create an
issue out of this.

697
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,414
Didn't l ask you
to leave decently?

698
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,415
But now, since you've
started the game,

699
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:20,182
we will play till we finish it!

700
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,349
You will leave only
after paying me!

701
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:08,760
You go and get the cash.

702
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,241
Me alone?

703
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,209
Listen to me.

704
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:17,777
lts not safe if you stay here.

705
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,186
He's clevererthan you, Chakkara!

706
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,091
l'll be back soon.

707
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,500
Until then, don't create
any problem here.

708
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,191
The car is in gear.

709
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:13,232
Let her go.
You come here!

710
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:43,664
Mummy!

711
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,732
Shaji, l doubt she'll come back!

712
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,804
Where did this loser come from?

713
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,671
- How fast was she driving!

714
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,802
- His leg must be broken.
- Push!

715
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,246
Sir,

716
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,281
Don't be out in the cold.
Come, sit inside.

717
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,253
Where do these people come from!

718
01:22:29,411 --> 01:23:12,953
Team DrC

719
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:35,827
That doesn't work, Sir.

720
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,666
You can call from my phone.

721
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,144
You're really tensed.

722
01:25:56,518 --> 01:26:00,454
lt's not right to call your wife's
phone from a stranger's number.

723
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:35,689
Keep it there.

724
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:37,451
Play properly!

725
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:38,726
Keep it here.

01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,205
Brother,
- What is it?

727
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,209
Swami has given the interest.
- Oh. You got it?

728
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,091
- Ya. Keep it here.
Here!

729
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:16,830
- Keep it here.

730
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:29,944
What is it?

731
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:35,805
Tell me!
- Come here!

732
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:46,152
Hey. Make it fast.

733
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,765
Hey, how much did you keep?

Team DrC

735
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:18,626

ls there a police station nearby?

741
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,243
Police station?
Yes! There!

742
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:48,249
That side?
- Yes.

743
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,042
Vidyaji,

744
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,335

745
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,736
l won't let her go!

746
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:21,722
Get lost!

747
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,721
Buy some good food for him!

748
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:28,387
Useless idiot!

749
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,082
So this is what you do?

750
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:00,157
But you don't look like a thief.

751
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,120
l had a doubt from
the time l saw you.

752
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,198
Take the bike.

753
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,763
l dare you. Take the bike!

754
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:06,934
Take it!

01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:16,863
Team DrC

756
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:03,209
A#ole! So much trouble
ever since you came here!

757
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,111
Lock him inside!

758
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,330
Bro, get out quickly.

759
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,084
Bro!

Team DrC

761
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:22,089
Vidyaji,

762
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,321
The girl is driving
really well, isn't it?

763
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,320
l won't let her escape!

764
01:37:58,572 --> 01:37:59,834
Fell into a ditch, is it?

765
01:38:00,574 --> 01:38:01,541
Phew!

766
01:38:01,742 --> 01:38:03,505
You were driving so fast!!

767
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:29,803

772
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:58,491
- Remove the belt. Come on!

773
01:39:03,003 --> 01:39:04,402
You're quite strong, huh?

774
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:19,486
They will always come
at the wrong time!

775
01:39:19,486 --> 01:39:20,510
Bloody nuisance!

776
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:01,357
Ok. Don't cry madam.
Relax.

777
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:03,564
You don't have to worry at all.

778

Sir, it was me who called you.

Come ma'am.
Get into the car.

780
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:09,299
He was troubling her, Sir.

781
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:11,861
As soon as your car
came, he ran away!

782
01:40:14,308 --> 01:40:16,435
Hey, take her car and follow us.
- Okay Sir.

783
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:42,661

He will die if we
leave him like this.

788
01:41:31,985 --> 01:41:32,952
Make it fast!

789
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:38,951
Hello? Ambulance service?

790
01:41:39,126 --> 01:41:41,995
Please come quickly to Highway
Hotel, on the route to Masinagudi.

791
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:43,587
Please, don't go there.

792
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:45,393
You don't have to see it.

793
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:13,126
Water!

794
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,080

795
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:42,981

Sir, let me explain..

Get into the car first.
You can talk later.

800

Hey, come!

Nurse, put him on drips.

802
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:38,070
The patient has been hurt
badly in his stomach, Sir.

803
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:39,745
He has to go through a surgery.

804
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,948
Take him to the bigger
hospital at Masinagudi.

805
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:44,241
Before that, get his statement.

806
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:45,818
Okay.

807
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:56,893
John, how are you?

808
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:04,771
What's the problem between
you and that guy?

809
01:44:07,874 --> 01:44:09,739
lsn't he the one
who stabbed you?

810
01:44:25,158 --> 01:44:26,785
Lock him inside!!

811
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:51,607
How's the business going, John?

812
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:55,154
Those guys still have
respect only for money.

813
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:59,350
How dare you take over my shop?

814
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:02,121
Beat them up and
chase them away!

815
01:45:56,316 --> 01:45:57,283
Move!

816
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:22,008

817
01:46:24,478 --> 01:46:25,445

818
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:49,193
Leave me, please!

819
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:11,324
Leave!

820
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:12,789

Mani,

824
01:48:53,426 --> 01:48:54,393
Sir!

825
01:48:56,496 --> 01:48:58,555
You can save me. Please help!

826
01:48:59,599 --> 01:49:01,829

827
01:49:03,937 --> 01:49:04,904

Sign it.

831
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:23,205
lf anything happens to him, you
might have to come here again.

832
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,007
Okay. You may leave.

833
01:50:36,696 --> 01:50:37,697
Key!

834
01:50:37,697 --> 01:50:38,664

Team DrC

836
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:21,207
What were you thinking when
you sent me away alone?

837
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:25,735
l was really scared last night.

838
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:29,511
l didn't have the courage to
leave you with them and go away.

839
01:51:30,784 --> 01:51:33,378
l could'vejust paid those
80 rupees and settled it.

840
01:51:34,754 --> 01:51:36,654
And l made a mess out of it.

841
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:42,060
But our problem didn't
start at the hotel, right?

842
01:51:46,232 --> 01:51:49,395
l know that this behaviour of
mine is really troubling you.

843
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:53,569
But l can't give any guarantee
that l can change overnight.

844
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:56,507
But still, l will try.

845
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:00,502
When l go out of control,

846
01:52:00,613 --> 01:52:02,444
if you are with me,
everything will be alright!

847
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:09,019
So you have no plans
of leaving me alone, huh?
