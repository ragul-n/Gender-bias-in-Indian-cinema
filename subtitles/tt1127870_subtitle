1
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,593
Generally we say that the
walls also have ears?

2
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,259
But if they had a tongue
then what they would say?

3
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:58,536
For example, the black board
of this school's class room.

4
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:04,537
It must have seen so many stories
some successful and some failure.

5
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:10,948
The marriage hall where so many love
stories are tied in the marriages.

6
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:15,353
And so many marriages are broken
here in this court.

7
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,152
But what would you call
this place <i>lounge...</i>

8
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:21,160
...disco, or the night club.

9
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,956
We may say anything
but this place <i>has...</i>

10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,964
...always troubled me.

11
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,966
After all what is the attraction
in this <i>place...</i>

12
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,299
<i>...that</i> people are attracted
in hordes towards it. Why?

13
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,988
Come on you people party
throughout the <i>night...</i>

14
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,992
Come on you people come on and
hold each other tight.

15
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,325
Come on you people break it down
do the salsa.

16
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on you people come on and
just get it right.

17
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:08,129
Come on you people party
throughout the night.

18
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:12,008
Come on you people and
hold each other tight.

19
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:16,341
Come on you people break it down
do the salsa.

20
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,015
Come on you people just come on
and get it right.

21
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:28,355
Beloved, dance with me.
My dear, I'll tell you my <i>feelings...</i>

22
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:36,363
Meet your body with mine,
as it gives the pleasure of <i>life...</i>

23
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:40,366
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

24
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:44,165
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

25
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:48,306
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

26
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:52,310
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

27
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,777
Raj I am going.

28
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:56,318
Sit down. Why you are talking silly.

29
00:02:57,057 --> 00:03:01,187
There is farewell of the Puja.
Special dream for a special person.

30
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:03,794
Come on Sudhir, relax.
Have some fun.

31
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,055
Always he is doing like this.
He is like this since college only.

32
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,659
I think his mother was very strict
or something like that.

33
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,737
Sajji see there.

34
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,340
Back in business boys. Hold.

35
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:19,469
Come.

36
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,343
A leopard will never change
its <i>spots...</i>

37
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,348
<i>...then</i> two of them
will always have the hot.

38
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,413
Oh baby, come to me.

39
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:32,283
I have to settle you
in the residence of my arms.

40
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:40,292
Beloved, it is difficult
for me to stay without you.

41
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:44,294
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

42
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,231
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

43
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,235
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

44
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:56,113
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

45
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:58,383
<i>Hi. -  Hi. -  Hi.

46
00:03:58,518 --> 00:03:59,576
Again you've come late.

47
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,777
Sorry love.

48
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:03,580
And you came like this?

49
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:06,650
<i>Uh...</i> Very low.

50
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:09,519
Shut up.

51
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:14,325
Kishan <i>Arora. -  Okay wait.

52
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,269
He is very handsome.

53
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,395
He is cute, right?

54
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,132
Neha, you find all the guys cute.

55
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:23,870
I am looking <i>everywhere...</i>

56
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:29,345
<i>...but</i> my heart doesn't
get place <i>anywhere...</i>

57
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,881
Let it become <i>darker...</i>

58
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:37,348
<i>...I'll</i> show tell you everything
about the <i>world...</i>

59
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,885
Hi Boss what is going on here.

60
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,757
What would happen.

61
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,158
As usual in such place myself
and my <i>Ioneliness...</i>

62
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:45,163
<i>...are</i> generally talking
that if <i>she...</i>

63
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,563
...would be there then
it would have happen.

64
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:50,297
The only cure for our loneliness.

65
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,428
Cheers, dear.

66
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:57,302
Come on you people
party throughout the night.

67
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:01,442

00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:12,318
Beloved, dance with me.

71
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:17,256
My dear, I'll tell you my feelings.

72
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:20,532
Meet your body with mine.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,264
<i>...as</i> it gives the pleasure of life.

74
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:30,201
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

75
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,937
Yes.

76
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,609
Raj please now we are very late
and let us go.

77
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,207
See baby you've come
after two years from <i>America...</i>

78
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,752
<i>...and</i> again going for six months.
Just be reasonable.

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,755
Let's do the Mumbai Salsa, beloved.

80
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,348
Raj what are you doing?

81
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,223
See there is going to be strike
of the <i>kisses...</i>

82
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,352
<i>...so</i> I am filling up the tank.

83
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:57,226
Raj please I will miss my flight.

84
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:58,895
Please.

85
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,839
Okay.

86
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,572
Oh God I am going to miss you.

87
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:11,981
I'll remember your perfume
also very much.

88
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:13,844
Now what I will have to do.

89
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,979
But don't worry for your love,
I will pull through.

90
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:24,862
Raj I going for two years and
not for six months.

91
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,524
What?

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,592
They maid me the offer
and I accepted it.

93
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,271
You did not tell me. Two years?

94
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,278
You did not thought that just <i>...</i>

95
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,813
<i>...we</i> have been away for two years
and now again for two years.

96
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:43,940
How are we going to sustain
the long distance.

97
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:48,812
Precisely Raj we can
not do it. It's over.

98
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,281
It's over between the two of <i>us...</i>

99
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,954
We could not tolerate this
long distance relationship.

100
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:01,700
What are you doing?
See just just calm down.

101
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,895
O.K. The man could not think
properly in the airport.

102
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,962
So many bad ideas are coming.
You don't do it in a hasty manner.

103
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,701
Go the New York and
call me from there.

104
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,833
You think it properly.

105
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,302
Puja please <i>...we</i> know each
other since five <i>years...</i>

106
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,313
<i>...and</i> our engagement
has been done.

107
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,507
You just think it over.

108
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:21,583
Raj I have already thought
comfortably.

109
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,520
This career opportunity
is very important for me.

110
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,385
Please Raj please try to understand
<i>and...</i>

111
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,325
Raj one more thing.

112
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,736
If possible don't call me.

113
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,424
<i>Hi. -  Hi.

114
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,555
Sorry about the promotion.

115
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,090
I don't want to talk about it.

116
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:08,898
Only Minakshi had
to get that position.

117
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:10,900
She was sleeping with
the country head.

118
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,028
One Bacardi please.

119
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:20,442
Anyways now I am with you.

120
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:23,781
And we'll have good time
a perfect evening.

121
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,908
Perfect?

122
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:28,716
One minute. This is the collection
of your favorite songs.

123
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,519
Oh, how sweet. Thanks.

124
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:34,924
Love <i>you. -  Love you too.

125
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:39,456
What happened?

126
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,000
I think I forget my mobile
in the car. I'll be right <i>back...</i>

127
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,407
Could you please play this C.D.
Sanjay has given it.

128
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,419
My favourite songs.

129
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:02,948
Sanjay had given.

130
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:05,482
Thanks.

131
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:13,092
Hi Maya this is not
the CD of your favourite songs.

132
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,963
I am sorry but actually
why I should be sorry.

133
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:21,967
I have to record my voice in this
CD because I was afraid of you.

134
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:24,842
But now I am not scared anymore.

135
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,846
Maya I am sure
you would have been shocked.

136
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,974
But it's over between us.

137
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,978
What? How dare you?

138
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,453
I am afraid I have to let you go.

139
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,513
Yes Maya now I am not in a position
to tolerate you any more.

140
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:42,459
Everything you are taking
so seriously <i>and...</i>

141
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>...your</i> unique Pseudo-intellectual
take on every small think.

142
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:48,526
Your attitude I could not
tolerate all these now.

143
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:52,666
Pseudo-intellectual?
How dare you call me that?

144
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,070
I think I should stop this.

145
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,471
No just play on. I am sure that
the real thing is something else.

146
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,476
I am sure he is seeing
Some one else.

147
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:01,741
Maya I love some one else now.

148
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,074
There you go.

149
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,879
Perhaps you will be
shocked to listen it.

150
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,476
But I am seeing Nupur.

151
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:12,481
What! Nupur! That bloody dumb wit.
For her you are leaving <i>me...</i>

152
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:15,686
<i>...what</i> the hell you know.

153
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,890
What he is in deep trouble.
I am telling you.

154
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,091
What a loser.

155
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:26,036
And yes one more thing
I have changed my cell. So good bye.

156
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,035
You bastard!
How dare he do that to me?

157
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,590
Why you are putting this tattoo.

158
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,526
Because now that
I committed to <i>you...</i>

159
00:10:57,603 --> 00:11:02,267
I want you around me all the time
and it will always remember you.

160
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:06,273
That so sweet. But why
are you writing this in Hindi.

161
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:10,607
Because David Beckham
wrote his <i>wife...</i>

162
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,618
<i>...I</i> mean Victoria Beckham's
name in Hindi. Ah.

163
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,287
<i>Hello. -  Hi.

164
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:24,962
Maya I was calling you since evening.
Where were you?

165
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,089
Anna, what happened?

166
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,094
<i>I...</i> I broke up with Sanjay.
- Again.

167
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,831
What? - That so sad.

168
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,974
Excuse me there is something wrong.

169
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,909
Maya after one break up alone <i>in...</i>

170
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:44,109
<i>...the</i> house as depressed,
wine, chocolates.

171
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:45,983
That is not Maya.

172
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,110
What happened?

173
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:51,255
Yes, you are right. That's not Maya.

174
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:56,652
I got <i>dumped. -  What? - What?

175
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,591
Yeah she dumped <i>me...</i>

176
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:08,800
<i>...I</i> love her so much now what
I will say to my boss.

177
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,807
Bloody hell, so sad.

178
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,748
But Raj, stop crying. You really
look bad and ugly when you cry.

179
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:29,226
Yes she is telling correctly
and now stop crying.

180
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,957
Sudhir you said something nasty
about me again, did you?

181
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,031
Since two hours
he is weeping here to sit.

182
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,033
So many times I said him to
come regularly in the gym.

183
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,627
Boss you should always <i>have...</i>

184
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,763
<i>...a</i> cute butt.
The girls look there only.

185
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,699
But no body understand
to me and now you see.

186
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,842
And this permanent
Tattoo. It <i>seems...</i>

187
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:54,043
<i>...like</i> Amitabh Bachchan
had written on his arms <i>in...</i>

188
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,179
<i>...the</i> Diwar film that
my father is thief.

189
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,055
Raj is a biggest fool.

190
00:12:58,658 --> 00:12:59,716
You are telling <i>as...</i>

191
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:00,850
<i>...if</i> you are going to become
Amitabh Bachchan when you grow old.

192
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:03,920
Drinks anyone.

193
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:11,798
This wine and chocolates are okay,
but why you wear this goggle.

194
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,197
What I could not weep in the contact
and that is why this goggle.

195
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:18,675
Don't be upset on <i>all...</i> come
on Maya <i>...</i>

196
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:20,871
<i>...by</i> the way he was not good in bed.
Very bad.

197
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,206
Excuse <i>me. -  What?
- How do you know that?

198
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:28,676
The next room is nine and
whenever he was staying <i>here...</i>

199
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:33,088
<i>...in</i> the night then no voice
was coming from her room. Sad.

200
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,834
After a break up
one gets depressed.

201
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,763
Along with it one has
to deal with two more things.

202
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:52,110
Sympathy and regrets.
Advice from relatives and friends.

203
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,702
Good morning, <i>boss. -  Oh Hi, come.

204
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,770
Come on and <i>sit...</i>

205
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,708
It is good that today
you came in the <i>office...</i>

206
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,719
<i>...and</i> Subbu has told me
that what <i>happen...</i>

207
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,379
<i>...with</i> you in the yesterday night.

208
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:05,918
Good old, Subbu.

209
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,196
There is nothing to worry
and move on in life.

210
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:16,725
Boss it is very easy to
say but difficult to do.

211
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:17,928
Not that much difficult also.

212
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:21,866
See old girl friends are like
income tax returns, on.

213
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:24,876
Store them away. File
them away, move on!

214
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,002
Yes.

215
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,746
And one more thing you <i>understand...</i>

216
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,747
<i>...that</i> whenever the personal life
is going for a <i>toss...</i>

217
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,750
<i>...then</i> understand that
the career is going to grow.

218
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:34,879
Boss what are you telling this.

219
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:38,223
Seriously, you go out tonight
and get laid.

220
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:40,749
You will forget her in a jiffy.

221
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:45,230
Boss, it is very easy to say,
but hard to do.

222
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:50,292
There is only one remedy for
all the diseases in the <i>world...</i> Sex.

223
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:54,769
O.K. I agreed that after the <i>break...</i>

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,171
<i>...up</i> you get the sympathy
of the friends.

225
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,974
But every man is not
our friend also.

226
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,838
I tell you one thing.

227
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:03,306
What.

228
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,978
Yesterday night she had break up
with her boyfriend.

229
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,318
What are you saying and
how you know it?

230
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:13,520
I was there only.
She got dumped mad.

231
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,988
She was shouting like a mad cat.

232
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,120
It was a good to watch scene.

233
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,322
Look at her, she is giving orders.
- Exceptionally <i>well...</i>

234
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:24,328
Is there something funny, Prakash.

235
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,196
No Ma'am.

236
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,936
No if there is any joke
then there with us. Come on.

237
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,870
No ma'am, seriously.
You would not want to know.

238
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:39,342
<i>Anyways...</i> that's all for now.
I want all the report by evening.

239
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:40,543
Okay ma'am.

240
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:44,889
Maya, you got dumped.
I <i>mean...</i> you broke up last night?

241
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:47,084
What? Who told you?

242
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,959
No just Prakash and
Mohit were talking about this only.

243
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,088
Damn it!

244
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:57,098
Don't worry Maya. You know
whatever happen is for good only.

245
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,898
Actually, love is always near us.

246
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,900
We just don't recognize it.

247
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,904
It is matter of <i>eyes...</i>

248
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,044
Otherwise who knows, you'll find
someone special this weekend only.

249
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,118
It is not easy you <i>know...</i>

250
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,123
...besides there are five more days
to go for the weekend.

251
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,258
Why can't it just be Friday?

252
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:56,290
I want to live it my way.
Why can't it just be Friday?

253
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,898
Forgive me
it is not possible for me.

254
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,025
Some one thrown water
from upper side.

255
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:04,160
Madam you listen to me.

256
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,294
I will not allow you go to there.
- You talk to my in-charge.

257
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,100
I am going right now and
you can not do anything.

258
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:09,107
Madam this is the question
of my service.

259
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,911
Hey this is Zunobia,
owner of this Salsa class.

260
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,512
Let's get started.

261
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:39,996
Beloved, my eyes met
with yours on Tuesday.

262
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,330
No, no. I'll show.

263
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:47,539
How can I tell you
what effect it made on me?

264
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,013
So, what do you think at my place?

265
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,416
Drinks, dinner, and breakfast.

266
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,684
Excuse me just now we met <i>and...</i>

267
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,954
<i>...by</i> the way I will get only
with guy who dance better than me.

268
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,685
Oh really.

269
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,559
You are in my breaths.

270
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:08,294
I want to live it my way.

271
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:12,030
Why can't it just be Friday?

272
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,636
Excuse me. I did not order this.

273
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,433
Sorry ma'am. One <i>minute. -  Yeah.
- This is what I want.

274
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:25,575
There you go?

275
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,984
Nice <i>job. -  Thanks.

276
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,513
Nice biceps.

277
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,583
Really?

278
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:37,053
So, do you want to check out
the rest of the merchandise?

279
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,068
So, how was it.

280
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:48,405
You were kind of different.

281
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,067
It wasn't good.

282
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:07,553
One mistake tells me,
the loneliness tells me.

283
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:15,632
Tomorrow my dreams will fulfill.

284
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:25,108
Nobody knows that
I've lost my love.

285
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:33,182
Now I just can't wait
for a minute more.

286
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:36,779
I want to live in my way.

287
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,458
Why can't it just be Friday?

288
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:49,661
I want to live in my way.
Why can't it just be Friday? Friday.

289
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,669
I ordered <i>some...</i>

290
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:53,261
<i>...that</i> you'll like it too.
- I hate junk food.

291
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,801
As a matter of fact,
I hate <i>anything...</i>

292
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,672
<i>...and</i> everything that's Amac.

293
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:03,146
Thanks for telling me that.
By the way, it is Italian.

294
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:12,148
Thursday has brought grief to me.

295
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:19,764
I don't know why
I feel blessings are curse.

296
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:28,635
The one whom I love,
doesn't love me.

297
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:35,708
It is my fault and not his.

298
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:44,787
I want to live it my way.
Why can't it just be Friday? Friday.

299
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:52,862
I want to live it my way.
Why can't it just be Friday? Friday.

300
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,193
Why can't it just be Friday?
Friday.

301
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,803
Hey girls! We are going to
have fun tonight.

302
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:06,202
You know what? This girls night
out idea doesn't gel with me.

303
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:07,802
I don't think it's proper.

304
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,281
Come on, Maya first time also we
met in the girls night out only.

305
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,408
You don't remember.

306
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:16,143
I know I remember that also. Maya
you don't remember that we <i>...</i>

307
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:20,157
<i>...met</i> on that stupid dating session
where all the boys were so <i>...</i>

308
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:23,160
...boring that we started talking
among ourselves and became friend.

309
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,291
But Neha that was different <i>thing...</i>

310
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,427
Now three alone girls in a pub.

311
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:28,824
I will look something disgusting.

312
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,562
Come on, Maya. Don't worry.

313
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:34,299
We will meet a lot of cute guys.
You badly need one.

314
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:38,168
You know guys, after break-up,
the best <i>way...</i>

315
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:42,304
The best way to get over a guy is
to get another one and quick deal.

316
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:45,377
Neha remember that
I am not like you.

317
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:48,251
Poor you! - Shut up!

318
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,266
What is going on here?
Since last ten minutes we <i>are...</i>

319
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,304
...standing here but no body is
paying attention towards us.

320
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:09,197
I know I think that
half of the <i>boys...</i>

321
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:11,333
<i>...in</i> Mumbai are having
the girl friends.

322
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:14,442
And the left
over have become a case.

323
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:18,746
See I am thinking of leaving liquor.

324
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:22,716
What nonsense you are talking.
You have become mad.

325
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:26,290
Boss, alcohol is the
best creation of the man kind.

326
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:29,825
It makes man brave <i>and...</i> Even you.

327
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,555
That's absolutely right.

328
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:34,866
Okay guys, you have your drink,
I'll just piss and come.

329
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:42,331
Baba, it is not piss and come,
it is always come and then piss.

330
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:46,404
Right again but give
the order quickly. Scotch for me.

331
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:47,837
You.

332
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,608
Maya come you and I will dance.

333
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,445
<i>Come. -  Come we will enjoy there.

334
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,644
Come on.

335
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,325
Excuse me.

336
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,831
<i>Hey. -  Oh hi.

337
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,362
So, what are you doing here?

338
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,343
Looking around for guys
who dance better than you.

339
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:21,277
May be. What about you. Have you
come here to sell your scheme <i>for...</i>

340
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:24,804
<i>...the</i> drinks, dinner
and the breakfast?

341
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:32,289
Perhaps. Tell you something. When
a guys meets a girl <i>and...</i>

342
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:36,293
<i>...he</i> tries to start conversation then
generally what happens that <i>both...</i>

343
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:38,386
<i>...try</i> to act smart.

344
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:44,701
Let's presume that you are smart
and I am <i>dumb. -  O.K.

345
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:48,768
Then perhaps we may continue
the conversation.

346
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:51,569
Well, somebody is good at lines.

347
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:53,035
That I am.

348
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:57,405
Maya, if we were like that
then what would happen.

349
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:58,745
Mean.

350
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,850
Like that means happy and gay.

351
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,979
Have you gone to be mad? - Yes.

352
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:10,385
Yeah guy Saiba no cheating in love
and think that if we <i>would...</i>

353
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:14,330
<i>...be</i> having our perfect guys then
our search would have <i>been...</i>

354
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,391
...finished and myself and you
would've got married and settled.

355
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,699
What you say about my offer.

356
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,330
If I could not get myself
married <i>with...</i>

357
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:23,465
<i>...a</i> boy of my choice for
three years <i>then...</i>

358
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:24,600
Yes

359
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,439
Then you remind me about your offer.

360
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:31,411
Maya if we would be
hat then how dance.

361
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:41,489
Oh <i>baby...</i> oh Maya,
I am so turned on.

362
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,788
Oh you are very cute baby.

363
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,455
Hey! What are you looking at, man!

364
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:52,359
I am thinking that what a waste.
If you would not have <i>been...</i>

365
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:56,464
<i>...a</i> lesbie then
you could have hooked up.

366
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:07,009
Really, suppose
if I am like this and that then.

367
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,449
Talk to me about you.

368
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,453
Hey, wallet is sitting there.

369
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:24,993
It seems like that and they are there
and we are sitting here.

370
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:29,833
But you are going to paint
this place red? What happened sir?

371
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:37,642
You will not understand.
I am observing.

372
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:39,676
I am smelling.

373
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:43,979
Then what our Doberman
has smelt till now.

374
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:50,417
What is going on in the mind of
a girl in the night club <i>is...</i>

375
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,521
...known by her choice
of the alcohol.

376
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,499
Oh - I am <i>telling. -  Nice.

377
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,525
You see to those girls.

378
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,940
Margarita, that means
they are in a good mood.

379
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:06,500
That means, they are expecting
their boyfriend anytime.

380
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,510
Did you see that Raj?
I am a genius.

381
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:22,857
See there. Look at that girl.
Hard liquor.

382
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:27,555
She is very depressed.
She will tell a sad story.

383
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:33,635
She looks very intelligent.
She is not my <i>kind. -  Forget it.

384
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:40,807
Look at those two girls. They are
acting as if they are drinking <i>beer...</i>

385
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:43,842
<i>...and</i> behaving as though
they come here daily.

386
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:49,885
They are school girls.
Raj, the Doberman smelt it.

387
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:54,889
You wait here, I'll be right back.

388
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:58,556
It is possible that
I might not turn back. Cheers.

389
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:00,826
Maya, meet him.

390
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:04,596
This is Tony and Tony,
this is <i>Maya. -  Hi. -  Hi.

391
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,570
Maya, you, me, and Tony.

392
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:09,573
We are going to have a three snug
tonight. I hope you understood?

393
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,609
Neha, are you out of your mind?
- Damn you.

394
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:16,614
Tony, I told you earlier that she
wouldn't accept it. She is so boring.

395
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:18,650
She will always remain the same.

396
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:21,652
But darling, I am like this
and even like that.

397
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:29,960
So let us go. Maya you know what
this one seems to be a very good.

398
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:33,794
Please don't come home till morning.
Yes

399
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:35,059
There are two rooms in my flat.

400
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:42,164
Yes but you know that
I need some more place.

401
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:46,075
<i>Please. -  Neha.
You are such a nymphomaniac.

402
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:49,612
Excuse me I am not nymphomaniac
and I am just a hypersexual.

403
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,743
You don't come home before morning.

404
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:53,717
Bye, let's go.

405
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,684
You are also thinking the same
that I am thinking.

406
00:28:37,696 --> 00:28:38,788
What?

407
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:41,697
To jump from here.

408
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:44,726
A kind of.

409
00:28:46,304 --> 00:28:52,766
Bye the way do you think
one will die if he jumps from here?

410
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:58,980
Depends actually. If he falls on legs
then he escapes <i>with...</i>

411
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:04,951
<i>...some</i> fractures and remain
in the hospital for two three months.

412
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:10,686
There will be a police case also but
if he falls on the head <i>then...</i>

413
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,164
<i>...he</i> will be a freshly
squashed pumpkin.

414
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:20,095
Beer.

415
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:31,046
You know one of
my aunts got divorced.

416
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:35,651
She was very depressed you
know? She tried <i>to...</i>

417
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,917
...commit suicide by taking the
sleeping pills but she escaped.

418
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,251
Actually this is the
best option formula.

419
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:46,221
Air bubble.

420
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,737
You take a syringe and
without filling anything pull it.

421
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,798
Means.

422
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:01,872
The air will fill it and
there will be a heart attack.

423
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:08,776
The air bubble, it travels through
your veins and straight to the heart.

424
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:12,848
Instant heart attack.
Completely painless.

425
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:20,954
<i>Smart. -  Thank you.
I have seen on the discovery.

426
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,777
Discovery channel.

427
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:17,947
No.

428
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:34,429
Wow, I love this chicken.

429
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:35,964
Hey Raj. What's wrong? - Nothing.

430
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:37,764
Yes Raj what <i>happen...</i>
since when you come <i>here...</i>

431
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:40,174
...there is something wrong with you.

432
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:44,143
Come on out with it. Apart from
being boss I am your friend also.

433
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:47,109
Okay.

434
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:53,855
I think I had a one night sit.

435
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:55,384
Yes.

436
00:31:58,096 --> 00:31:59,154
What is one night sit?

437
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:03,861
<i>Yes. -  It is one night stand.

438
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,227
What is this sit?

439
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:13,401
Well when I woke up
the girl was still there.

440
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:17,881
But I don't remember that
we had done anything or not.

441
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:21,908
So technically one night sit.

442
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,879
You don't remember anything?

443
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,948
Absolutely nothing.

444
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:28,083
Then something happened or not.

445
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,217
I don't remember.

446
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:33,921
Anyways you know what Maya
welcome to the club.

447
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,266
See all these are generally
happening with me.

448
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:38,902
But don't worry
you will also become habitual.

449
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:45,968
Well one night stand my boy.
Wow. There you go.

450
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:48,209
After all you have accepted
my advice.

451
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:51,905
Anyway Raj, now you will
get your 'Gapucha'

452
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:56,911
Boss you have given this advice
to him and he has accepted it also.

453
00:32:57,322 --> 00:33:00,450
He has spoiled the life of another
girl to forget the earlier one.

454
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,928
Hey, I didn't ruin anybody's life.
She willingly came to my flat.

455
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:08,397
It wasn't like that.
You know what I mean?

456
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:09,956
It is perfectly fine, Raj.

457
00:33:10,268 --> 00:33:12,361
These things happen.

458
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:16,231
Same to same. Women need it too.

459
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:19,099
Maya, try to remember if something
unusual would've happened.

460
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,946
Unusual? Unusual like what?

461
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,481
Unusual like,
may be he tied you up and <i>on...</i>

462
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:33,219
He would've tied her to the bed.
May be he would've used a blind fold.

463
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,484
<i>Wow... -  Sensuous toys,
chocolate <i>sauce...</i>

464
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,961
Neha, what are you talking about?
- Neha!

465
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:41,999
You know what she is talking about.

466
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:44,001
No, I don't know what
she is talking about.

467
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:49,269
Oh my God! She doesn't even know.

468
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,070
What is wrong with everybody?

469
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:54,373
All this sleeping around,
troubling and lounging <i>up...</i>

470
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,970
<i>...and</i> bloody <i>smoking...</i>

471
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:59,016
Why is the society becoming
so promiscuous and immoral.

472
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,018
Why the hell
we are talking to Americans?

473
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:04,417
Hey, what do you <i>mean...</i>
we are immoral.

474
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:09,153
You think some American came here
and wrote the Kamasutra.

475
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:14,328
You mean, some American came here
and scripted the Ajanta Elora caves.

476
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:17,000
You Indian prove guilty you mean.

477
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:19,997
Listen, I <i>mean... -  Listen guys,
it is not about you.

478
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:22,005
It is about me, okay?

479
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:26,203
The one night sit, remember?
- No, <i>no...</i> it is about us.

480
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:31,377
I think we have the target
for our new condom campaign.

481
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:36,053
<i>Ecstasy...</i> it is about us.

482
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,246
Yes

483
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:43,026
Hello. Hello.

484
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:50,062
Dog. Dog! <i>Hi. -  What is it, Raj?

485
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:55,028
See can you give me some information
about a girl.

486
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,198
Which girl?

487
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:05,039
There is a girl she is small but
her long hairs and very <i>fair...</i>

488
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,378
<i>...but</i> you know great body.

489
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,612
So many are coming here.

490
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:12,648
She is always saying how dare you.

491
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:15,082
Oh, that how dare you, girl? - Yes.

492
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,062
She is <i>Maya. -  Maya.
- She works for Mark and Morrison.

493
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,527
What happened? - Maya, there is
someone here to see you.

494
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:29,665
How the hell did you find me?

495
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:31,500
What are you doing here?

496
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:36,307
Actually when I came to know
about that day <i>then...</i>

497
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:38,542
What you know?
- Yes

498
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:42,482
I feel it would be better for
us to go somewhere else and talk.

499
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:44,215
We could really use some privacy.

500
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,548
Okay.

501
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,629
Now tell me what you know?

502
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:57,430
<i>Well... -  What you know?

503
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:04,041
Well actually there is
a side table in my bed side <i>and...</i>

504
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:09,273
<i>...I</i> used to keep a stuff
but it was not used.

505
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:14,448
Stuff? - <i>Stuff. -  What stuff?

506
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,177
What stuff?

507
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:20,490
Stuff is the condoms and
it was not used.

508
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:26,221
Oh God that means
we have not done anything.

509
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:29,156
Possibly.

510
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:37,270
It means that we may dome something
without using it.

511
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:41,678
You can not do like that.

512
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:46,147
<i>You...</i> wouldn't do that. Would you?
- Oh <i>yeah...</i> no, I mean.

513
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:51,318
Normally, it is not something
I am fond of <i>doing...</i>

514
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:54,823
We tend to make mistakes
in a hurry.

515
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,157
I thought that I should
get all this to your notice.

516
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:08,570
<i>And...</i> now I feel that
I should move out from this place.

517
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,534
So, you take care.

518
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,197
Come on, Maya, relax.

519
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:38,793
What do you mean relax?

520
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:41,734
I was not so tensed
before the results also.

521
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,241
Can not depend on this.
Pregnancy test you know.

522
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,312
Well tell me one thing that
you don't want this baby.

523
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:51,539
No.

524
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,208
Then we will do one thing.

525
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,218
You deliver this baby
and give it to me.

526
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,220
What? - Yes.

527
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,553
Bye the way now the single unmarried
fashion is going on. Right?

528
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:04,228
You are <i>mad. -  No baby.
Think about it.

529
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:07,321
I mean, I'll become
a very good mother. Isn't it.

530
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,300
Maya, two good news for you.

531
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,304
Pregnancy test negative and
also AIDS test negative.

532
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:19,231
<i>Yes. -  My God.

533
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,510
No! I mean, yes. Why not.

534
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,913
See I told you that you are
unnecessarily taking tension.

535
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:33,314
It was a matter of getting
tensed for me and not for you.

536
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:36,859
You know, motherhood and
career don't go together.

537
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:41,256
Shall I tell you something?

538
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,266
<i>Yes. -  There was something special
in him.

539
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,794
He was different from others.

540
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:49,867
You know it was quite responsible
for him come and tell me.

541
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:52,876
Anybody else in his place
wouldn't have done this.

542
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:56,805
Quite a sensitive guy.

543
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,878
Okay. So what's your problem?
Call him up.

544
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:03,812
I don't know his number.

545
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,757
Great. My good old old friend, Maya.

546
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:09,623
I should've known. Let's go.

547
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:12,287
Okay guys.

548
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:16,629
I have some interesting ideas on
how to pitch this lingerie brand.

549
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:22,234
Let's pitch this for the
lingerie line for the <i>model...</i>

550
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:26,504
...smart, sexy, confident,
Indian woman.

551
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:30,307
Someone who is extremely comfortable
with her sexuality <i>and...</i>

552
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:32,315
<i>...is</i> no longer
shy about expressing it.

553
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:34,713
Someone who is not afraid
to show a bit of <i>cleavage...</i>

554
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:36,515
<i>...and</i> a little bit of midriff.

555
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:41,322
And this lingerie wear can only
enhance the women's sex appeal.

556
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,323
That's it. There is a lot more
in Indian <i>women...</i>

557
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:45,328
<i>...than</i> the sex appeal, okay?

558
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:49,393
Sabbu, I am sure there is, <i>but...</i>

559
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,864
But what?

560
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:53,394
What do you know about Indian women?

561
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,263
They are an extremely <i>slut...</i>

562
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:56,601
<i>...she</i> is more responsible and
she is going to <i>fast...</i>

563
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:58,005
<i>...for</i> her husband
the rest of her life.

564
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,943
Guys, you don't have to fight
for a piece of lingerie.

565
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:02,809
It is <i>just... -  No, Raj.
Please stay out of this.

566
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:05,882
Subbu, do you mean to say <i>that...</i>

567
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,885
...Indian women do not
wear sexy lingerie?

568
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,349
<i>Yes...</i> they might, <i>but...</i>

569
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:15,551
What are you asking?

570
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:17,352
Listen, that is not the point,
<i>but...</i>

571
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:21,697
The point is consumer behavior
in different countries.

572
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:23,892
I am sure you have.

573
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,701
And you are the last one
to tell me what Indians like.

574
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,429
This is my client and takes
it over in my way. Is that clear?

575
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,905
Thanks Subbu. Do it your way.

576
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:40,375
Pam!

577
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,848
Aah what a man you are?
You have become mad.

578
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:51,927
Why you behave like this with her.
These are the products of the girls.

579
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,596
You have ever wear this
or taken off of some one.

580
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:01,066
Pam is a girl and she would know
better about these things.

581
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:10,610
Subbu what is your problem?
Why you can not live like us.

582
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,409
Why can not you just balance life?

583
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:18,083
Excuse me you don't count
me in your category.

584
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:19,414
I did not come here from <i>Chennai...</i>

585
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,548
<i>...to</i> Mumbai for enjoyment
like you people.

586
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,419
Every time disco,
parties and night clubs.

587
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:25,553
Bloody one night stands.
- One night sit.

588
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,098
Yeah whatever listen
I have come here to succeed.

589
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:31,028
My parents have incurred
huge money for my education.

590
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:33,963
I have such a responsibility and
I am just trying to be best.

591
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,699
Fine, all the best and
being the best, okay?

592
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,433
Fine.

593
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:53,786
You don't have to do this.

594
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:01,931
Sorry about what happened in there.

595
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:07,799
You know, when I came to <i>India...</i>

596
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,135
<i>...I</i> just fell in love
with this place.

597
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:17,873
Whether it is my office,
circle of <i>friends...</i>

598
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:20,144
<i>...or</i> the place I live.

599
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:24,151
I always tried my best
to adjust along.

600
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:29,754
Mr. Bhim seems to be the
representation <i>of...</i>

601
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:32,159
<i>...an</i> Indian than
will never accept me.

602
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:39,764
<i>Look...</i> Subbu is not
even the representation of India.

603
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:43,499
If he represents anything
it is ancient India.

604
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:48,840
Okay look, I have an idea.

605
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:51,045
Why don't you guys hang out?

606
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,112
You know, you and Subbu,
I and Subbu.

607
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,512
May be we can make love more.

608
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:02,519
Okay? - Great. Let's do that.

609
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:04,855
Thank you, Tony.

610
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:06,191
You are so cute.

611
00:43:11,602 --> 00:43:14,002
Tony <i>baby. -  Yes sweetheart.

612
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:17,134
Darling, get us some drinks.
Wine for three of us.

613
00:43:18,676 --> 00:43:19,734
Sure.

614
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,205
Why you treat him like this.

615
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:29,552
Come on Jen
it is important in the life.

616
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,554
By the way,
very soon he will be packed up.

617
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:34,023
Not a good 'Ghapak'.

618
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,625
You know, even <i>I...</i>

619
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:42,757
This is nice.

620
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,232
You and I, hang <i>out. -  Yes, it is.

621
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:45,693
Shit.

622
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:46,828
Yes, what happen?

623
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:48,763
Who?

624
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,704
The same bloody one night stand.

625
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:51,901
Where?

626
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,909
There with that girl.

627
00:43:54,512 --> 00:43:55,638
Okay, what are you going to have?

628
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,246
Wow!

629
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,907
Hey, look at that guy, man.

630
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:03,586
He has got class. Don't you think?

631
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:07,183
I know.
He must be very good in bed, dear.

632
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,789
Yes, he seems to be a very good
'Ghapak.'

633
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,590
Shut up. Stop using that word.
I'll fix him out.

634
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:15,723
Drinks ladies.
- Thank <i>you. -  Thanks.

635
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,927
Excuse me. Two whiskey's please.

636
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:19,127
Yes <i>sir. -  Thank you.

637
00:44:20,538 --> 00:44:23,666
Oh <i>shit. -  Oh shit.

638
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,266
What happened?

639
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:29,604
That's the girl.

640
00:44:30,548 --> 00:44:31,606
Which girl?

641
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:34,277
The one night, sit. There.

642
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:37,619
Oh wow. Where?

643
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:40,280
On that table.

644
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:44,624
He saw <i>me. -  Wow, good chick, huh?

645
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:50,227
Hey, go talk to her. Ask her out.

646
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,971
The boy got to be her boyfriend,
she says no <i>I...</i>

647
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,905
Well, there is one way to find out.

648
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:01,301
<i>Go... -  I can't. It won't happen.

649
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:03,638
Go, you idiot.
- I can't do it, <i>she...</i>

650
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:06,106
Fine, continue to be miserable.

651
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:07,775
Look at that girl.

652
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:09,712
Are you sure about this? - Yes.

653
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:13,120
I could end up looking like
a real idiot. You know <i>this. -  Go.

654
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,921
Look, I pretend not to be here.

655
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:19,187
Okay.

656
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:22,256
Go.

657
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:24,992
How embarrassing.

658
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:26,127
Why?

659
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:29,599
She was telling sensitive and
now when he himself <i>is...</i>

660
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:31,004
...coming to you then
you had problem.

661
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:32,940
And this time you definitely
take his number.

662
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,068
Oh God.

663
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:40,880
Go. Go.

664
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:42,815
Excuse me, hi.

665
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,012
<i>Hi. -  Hi. -  Hi.

666
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:46,147
<i>Hi. -  Hi. -  Hi.

667
00:45:46,223 --> 00:45:47,281
Hi.

668
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:00,370
Could we talk, may <i>be...</i> you and I?

669
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:01,829
Do you have a problem, girls?

670
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:02,964
Hey, shut up.

671
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:08,703
<i>So... -  Sure. -  Pleasure.

672
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:20,380
Everything is fine?

673
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:22,717
Means?

674
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,722
Last time what
I said you is fine here.

675
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:26,854
Everything is fine.

676
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:31,667
Actually I was thinking that
generally people meet <i>and...</i>

677
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:37,867
<i>...then</i> have introduction after
that they go some where.

678
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:44,672
You drinks, movies and after
<i>that...</i> but in our case <i>it...</i>

679
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:51,017
...seems everything is opposite and
that too without any introduction.

680
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:57,092
Maya <i>Tindo... -  Rajiv Sharma. Raj.

681
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:04,033
<i>Actually... -  What he wants
to ask is that your boyfriend?

682
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:08,101
<i>No. -  Great!

683
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,172
Because I am just his colleague
from work <i>and...</i>

684
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:14,177
<i>...I</i> am not his girlfriend,
so please continue.

685
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,115
That's <i>Pamela. -  Ok.

686
00:47:22,253 --> 00:47:23,720
Well I also wanted to ask <i>that...</i>

687
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:26,722
<i>...and</i> apart from that there
was one more thing.

688
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,916
What?

689
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:30,460
Would you go out with me some time?

690
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,387
It <i>depends...</i> when.

691
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:35,790
This Friday.

692
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:38,392
Busy.

693
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:41,204
Next month, November.

694
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,264
Not <i>sure. -  Next year.

695
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:45,399
Don't know actually.

696
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,138
Then, you tell me.

697
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:54,809
Now.

698
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:56,143
What?

699
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:58,412
Now?

700
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:02,157
Yes, now. I could leave this
place right now with you.

701
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:11,359
Ladies first, thanks.

702
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:41,921
Don't look at me with love.

703
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:46,529
Don't look at me with love.

704
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:50,865
I might die.

705
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:55,878
I might die.

706
00:48:56,814 --> 00:49:00,875
Don't spell magic with your eyes.

707
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:05,411
Don't smile like this.

708
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:09,952
I might fall in love with you.

709
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:15,092
I might die.

710
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:20,367
Don't look at me with love.

711
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:25,298
Don't look at me with love.

712
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:30,109
I might die.

713
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:36,113
I might die.

714
00:49:36,387 --> 00:49:39,982
Every time I try to walk away.

715
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:44,253
<i>...you</i> just make me wanna say.

716
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:49,060
I think about you baby, everyday.

717
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:54,198
With so much in my heart
that I need to say.

718
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,210
This is a beautiful story.

719
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:08,016
Since I've met you.

720
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:13,149
There is a sweet pain.

721
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:17,551
Only you are on my mind.

722
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:22,559
I can't tolerate the pine.

723
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:27,426
I can't tell the pain
I am going through.

724
00:50:28,038 --> 00:50:32,304
I can't tolerate the pine.

725
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:37,037
I can't tell the pain
I am going through.

726
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:41,984
Come closer to me.
Don't torment me.

727
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:46,913
Come closer to me.
Don't torment me.

728
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:51,258
I might die.

729
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:55,589
I might die.

730
00:50:56,934 --> 00:51:00,995
I might die.

731
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:06,475
I might die.

732
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,010
So much I need to say.

733
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:18,144
I might die.

734
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:24,957
O.K. Guys and girls welcome.
We have arranged <i>this...</i>

735
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,963
...party for the Subbu.
You see him over there.

736
00:51:28,031 --> 00:51:30,022
Can anybody bring him here?

737
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,158
Subbu.

738
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:34,033
Come on, <i>Subbu. -  It is your party.

739
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:36,704
<i>Come. -  What are you doing this?

740
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:39,974
Now as you know that Subbyu
has got one promotion <i>and...</i>

741
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:41,374
<i>...he</i> is the <i>youngest...</i>

742
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,379
<i>...ever</i> in our company
to be made Vice President.

743
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:46,373
Wow! - Thank you.

744
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,975
You people know very well to
the Subbu and it would <i>also...</i>

745
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:51,520
<i>...be</i> knowing that he is not going
to give any party to us.

746
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:53,380
Why you are telling like this.

747
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:58,326
Then I thought to give
the party for my best friend.

748
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,724
<i>Lovely. -  Cheers.

749
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,729
Congratulations.
Hail to you my friend.

750
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:07,602
Cheers to <i>Subbu. -  Cheers.

751
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:17,071
Hello. Of course,
I miss you too, baby.

752
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,417
Hello.

753
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:35,623
Hi.

754
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,294
You know, I've been watching
you all evening.

755
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:41,563
Really?

756
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:43,768
<i>Yes. -  Thank God, I am noticeable.

757
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:49,171
I am Raj. I am Raj's best friend.

758
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,242
Wow! So?

759
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:55,175
And you are the best friend of Maya.

760
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:56,310
Yes, so?

761
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,048
So, don't you think we should
get together sometime?

762
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:03,717
Are you good in bed?

763
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:07,129
Of course I am.

764
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:10,462
Really? What do you do?

765
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:14,595
I am gym instructor.

766
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:22,803
Cool. So take my number.

767
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,274
Hi, congratulations.

768
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:30,544
Thanks.

769
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:36,557
Hey, what are you doing standing
in the corner all alone?

770
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:40,290
Just trying to avoid over
enthusiastic people like you.

771
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:47,159
Okay. Subbu, come on.
Join the party, have some fun.

772
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:49,831
Listen, I don't need to have fun.
The weird people like you define fun.

773
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,166
I am having fun.

774
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:55,576
And here, you can keep that.

775
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:12,852
You know something, Subbu.
I really like you.

776
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,327
It is of no use telling you this.

777
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,400
You seem to be one of those <i>people...</i>

778
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:25,407
...whose doorstep life comes
knocking every now and then.

779
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:27,409
You guys just say go away.

780
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,803
You just don't want to live.

781
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:32,539
You know Back home?

782
00:54:33,216 --> 00:54:36,344
I once knew a man who worked
very hard to build a career.

783
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,546
Years <i>later...</i>

784
00:54:41,224 --> 00:54:46,287
When he had everything,
house, money, <i>cars...</i>

785
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:47,821
...millions in the <i>bank...</i>

786
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:51,700
<i>...he</i> realized that he lost <i>that...</i>

787
00:54:51,768 --> 00:54:54,703
...millions of wonderful moments
that make life beautiful.

788
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:58,370
You seem to be heading
in the same direction.

789
00:55:01,244 --> 00:55:02,370
I pity you.

790
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,188
You know what
your problem with me is.

791
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:15,190
I represent the things
which you are lacking.

792
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:19,390
Subbu, would you?
You don't have the guts to do it.

793
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:45,885
Hey Raj romantic see there.
- What?

794
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:48,220
There Karan is setting
his romance <i>with...</i>

795
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:51,488
...Zenobia and here
your setting will be spoiled.

796
00:55:52,562 --> 00:55:53,756
I am <i>totally...</i>

797
00:55:58,235 --> 00:55:59,896
What are you doing?
- You have become mad now.

798
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:02,302
You and Zenobia.

799
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:04,900
What Karan, Zenobia is
Maya's best friend.

800
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,910
If she knows your truth,
then I'll be finished.

801
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:11,436
Raj <i>see...</i>
- No you please stop this.

802
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:13,244
He is telling correctly. You are
a married and there your wife <i>and...</i>

803
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:15,250
<i>...one</i> baby is in the Delhi.

804
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:18,310
Here in Mumbai you are becoming
the bachelor.

805
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:19,649
You should have some shame Pamela.

806
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:21,519
Hey, you are out of your nuts today.

807
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:22,983
She is not the Pamela.

808
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:25,786
<i>Sorry... -  Look Subbu.

809
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:27,455
And listen you don't take off
the anger of the Pamela on me.

810
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:28,589
Understand.

811
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:34,733
Guys, it is difficult to tell now.

812
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:36,870
Once you are married, then within
two years every lingerie <i>ad...</i>

813
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,464
<i>...will</i> remind you a lifestyle
that you can never handle.

814
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:39,733
Here we go again.

815
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,937
I want to live
my life with the fullest.

816
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:47,541
Zenobia, is a good time pass.

817
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,878
So come on.

818
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:52,012
Let's do the code of honor.
Come on.

819
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,349
Code of honor?

820
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:57,484
What a code of honor. Now there

821
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:59,028
is nothing like code
of honor in friends.

822
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:03,289
You forget that when Puja went to
America then you were <i>staying...</i>

823
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:06,699
...hours together with the Shefali.
I have kept my mouth shut.

824
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,028
I kept my mouth shut.

825
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:09,963
That is code of honor.

826
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:14,637
And Subbu, when the accountant's
account slipped from your hands.

827
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:16,372
Who saved your ass dude?

828
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,378
I did, that is code of honor again.

829
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:19,706
Yes.

830
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:24,377
From now on all your secrets
are mine and mine yours.

831
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:27,387
Come on, shake hands now. Come on.

832
00:57:31,595 --> 00:57:34,063
What you are looking at me.
My life is an open book.

833
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:35,457
I don't have any secret.

834
00:57:37,868 --> 00:57:38,926
Think it.

835
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,062
Hi <i>baby. -  What is going on?

836
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:46,408
<i>No...</i> Actually we were planning
a pool tournament. Excuse me.

837
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:49,736
Excuse <i>me. -  Which tournament
in the swimming pool?

838
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:52,014
Gonna play? - What happened to him?

839
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:54,340
Nothing. Just like that.
Actually <i>we...</i>

840
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:56,078
We were talking about a movie.

841
00:57:56,953 --> 00:57:58,545
What was it? Men of honor.

842
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:01,415
<i>Right. -  Code of honor.

843
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:03,822
Thanks.

844
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:05,553
Oh yeah, baby. Oh yes.

845
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:18,501
Man, I have never met
anybody like you.

846
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:22,101
Really? - Oh yeah.
- Neither have I.

847
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:44,933
I ordered,
I thought you'd like some.

848
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:48,064
But you and pizza?

849
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:49,930
Why?

850
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:52,668
You only said it was Italian.

851
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:54,735
So?

852
00:58:55,011 --> 00:59:00,074
So? From US to Italy is about
5532.30 miles <i>and...</i>

853
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:04,012
<i>...from</i> India it is about
3991.12 miles.

854
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:08,150
So?

855
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:12,486
So, it is a kind of half
a between India and US.

856
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,158
I am coming half way.

857
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:20,827

What? - Will you play with me?

862
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,059

Okay. Okay.

Thank you.

875

This is very nice fragrance

876
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:37,713
Your favorite, butter chicken.

877
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:43,242
I was just waiting since long
for this in Mumbai.

878
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,252
Stop it.

879
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:47,781

880
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:12,807

883
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:27,287
Yes.

884
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:34,294
What happened?

885
01:01:35,105 --> 01:01:36,163
It was call of the Puja.

886
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:39,833
She is in Mumbai and
her mother is in the Hospital.

887
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:41,839
Anyway she wanted <i>that... I...</i>

888
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:42,969
I think you should go.

889
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:45,172
What?

890
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:46,776
I think you should go.

891
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:51,651
Are you sure? - Yes. Thank God
for refrigerators and microwaves.

892
01:01:53,656 --> 01:01:54,714
Okay.

893
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:05,992
<i>Raj...</i> Nothing.

894
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:09,663
Okay. Bye.

895
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:27,881
Hi.

896
01:02:28,892 --> 01:02:33,625
Thanks God Raj you came here.
Her appendix was about to burst.

897
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:38,633
Operation went off well.

898
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:45,106
She will come around in two hours.
Raj I am so glad you could make it.

899
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:47,835
Thank you, Raj.

900
01:02:49,646 --> 01:02:50,704
It is fine.

901
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:55,175
Thanks.

902
01:02:57,987 --> 01:02:59,045
Feeling better?

903
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:01,314
Yeah.

904
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:19,671
I ask you one thing. Since last
few months the <i>Ioneliness...</i>

905
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:25,271
<i>...I've</i> felt never
before have I felt it.

906
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:31,680
Not even a single days
has gone by <i>that...</i>

907
01:03:31,754 --> 01:03:36,691
<i>...I</i> had not thought about you.

908
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:39,227
If any one I've met <i>with...</i>

909
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,229
<i>...whom</i> I can spend the
rest of my life that is you.

910
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:46,700
I am sorry Raj.
I've committed a big mistake.

911
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:50,296
Can we get back together?

912
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:52,100
I could always come back.

913
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:55,439
I am ready to come back to
you leaving everything.

914
01:03:56,713 --> 01:03:57,771
Raj.

915
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:00,840
Why don't you say something?

916
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:07,386
Raj. Where are you going?

917
01:04:09,926 --> 01:04:12,121
Raj!

918
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:42,082
Oh my God.

919
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:44,484
Why you are laughing?

920
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:49,356
Again Puja has proposed to me.

921
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:57,297
Oh! Then what you will do now.

922
01:05:00,176 --> 01:05:04,772
Maya today when Puja
was talking <i>to...</i>

923
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:09,784
<i>...me</i> then I realized
one thing <i>that...</i>

924
01:05:09,852 --> 01:05:15,791
<i>...you</i> are the woman with whom <i>I...</i>

925
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:21,797
...would like to pass
my whole life <i>and...</i>

926
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:27,325
<i>...also</i> I realized that life
has started long back.

927
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,344
I don't want to wait anymore.
