1
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,290
Hearken o' people...

2
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,630
the drum sounds the call

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,130
Now awake and arise

4
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,130
From your deep slumber

5
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:02,480
Awaken, now awaken

6
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,980
The Earth comes alive
as dawn heralds a new day

7
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,150
Rivers sparkle with new life and
hope rises in oceans anew

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,090
Awaken, now awaken

9
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:29,330
Be blessed, be blessed, be blessed.
May all be blessed

10
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,180
The towns are awake, the homes
are abuzz, every village is astir

11
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,690
Valleys awaken and so do their trees,
look, shadows are coming to life!

12
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,120
Be Blessed, be blessed, be blessed
May all be blessed

13
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,360
When dawn comes to bathe
at the banks of the Ganges,

14
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,630
dark night retreats before the
Sun's flashing sword

15
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,760
Sacred fires are lit for prayers.
Go now and greet your gods

16
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,000
He who asks, shall receive,
and sins of ages will be washed away

17
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,020
The market shakes off its slumber
and stretches to life

18
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,720
Landlord, trader, priest or soldier as per
your worth, your value is weighed

19
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,230
Singing songs of love and blessing the
Sufi wanders strumming his tunes...

20
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,560
May the doors of each man's fortune open
and may all be well in this world of ours"

21
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:41,580
Be Blessed, be blessed, be blessed,
May all be blessed

22
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:52,850
Be Blessed, be blessed, be blessed,
May all be blessed

23
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,730
1857 A.D.

24
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,660
The entire Indian subcontinent
is ruled by...

25
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,700
a company. The British East India Company

26
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,840
The most successful business enterprise
in history

27
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,110
The Company has its own laws,
its own administration

28
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,550
lts own army

29
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,620
It controls the destiny of
one fifth of humanity

30
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,260
Get it over with

31
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,800
Mangal Pandey

32
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,950
Sepoy, 34th Regiment,
Native Infantry at Barrackpore

33
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,100
You have been found guilty of
mutiny and conspiracy...

34
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,880
to overthrow the government of the
Honourable East India Company,

35
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,680
by a duly constituted court martial

36
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,550
You have been sentenced to death

37
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,230
Well come on, hurry up

38
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,630
Mangal Pandey, do you have a last wish?

39
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,980
You cannot grant my last wish

40
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,550
Yet it will be fulfilled

41
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,510
Time's up. Hang him

42
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,920
Sir, the hangman...

43
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,390
he ran away

44
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,130
Yes sir, he refused to hang
Mangal Pandey

45
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,900
We tried to persuade him, threaten him
but... but he ran away, sir

46
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,740
Christ! This is nonsense

47
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,370
You... you hang him

48
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,410
That's not my duty, sir

49
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,850
Damn your duty, it's an order!
Move!

50
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,210
I'm a Brahmin, sir. It's against my faith

51
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,650
Send a message to Calcutta and
get another hangman

52
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,090
Until then, take him down

53
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,030
Take him down

54
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,000
The Earth will be scorched

55
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,540
Rivers of blood will flow

56
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,770
Millions will die

57
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,280
And I, William Gordon...

58
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,010
feel responsible for the inevitable

59
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,930
4 Years earlier,
on the mountains of Afghanistan

60
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,900
Fire

61
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,890
Infantry... charge

62
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,170
ATTACK!

63
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,960
Quick! Take them to base camp!

64
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,370
You did well, Captain

65
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,310
The Afghans are on the run
and we hold the pass

66
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,280
Pandey...

67
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,460
Gordon sir... no

68
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,050
Let him be

69
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,530
Captain Gordon

70
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,740
William, are you all right?

71
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,370
No don't... lie down

72
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,550
Here...

73
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,190
I want you to have my pistol

74
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,020
I've got nothing else to give you

75
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,260
Please

76
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,930
Take it

77
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,810
4 Years later,

78
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,880
31st December 1856, Calcutta

79
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,290
New Year celebrations at
the Governor General's palace

80
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,450
Who's that?

81
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,280
Lord Canning... Governor General.
- Not him, you fool

82
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,320
I mean, the chap next to him

83
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,360
Mr Lockwood, the Company auditor...

84
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,120
sent by London to investigate all the
monkey business going on in the Company

85
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,990
And next to him is Mr Kent

86
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,200
Bigtime trader

87
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,170
Some of the top Company officers
are on his payroll

88
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,110
My lords, ladies, and gentlemen...

89
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,190
pray silence for...

90
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,520
His Excellency Lord Canning...

91
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,790
Governor General of India

92
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,430
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

93
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,230
as a servant of the
Honourable East India Company...

94
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,180
that has ruled the territories of Hindoostan...

95
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,840
for a hundred years...

96
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,280
I must profess pride and an equal humility

97
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,990
It is my privilege to recall...

98
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,980
that our forebears came
to these territories as traders

99
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,330
And we now find ourselves,
by the will of God...

100
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,800
masters of the entire Indian subcontinent
from Khyber to Comorin

101
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,340
What did he say?

102
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,170
The Company Raj completes
100 years in India

103
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,810
From traders they became rulers

104
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,610
My god! What is she wearing?

105
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,010
And we bring to India the benefits
of modern governance...

106
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,820
scientific progress, and, above all...

107
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,690
justice

108
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,990
Has he mentioned the Queen yet?
- No. He says they're doing us a favor

109
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,430
We have earned the love and
gratitude of the people of India

110
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,470
And we shoulder the burden of the
white man without complaint

111
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,150
Now...? - No

112
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,780
He says, we Indians are
grateful to them!

113
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,890
Now I call upon you to join with me
as I propose the loyal toast

114
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,990
Your mother must be turning in her grave!
Shame on you, Emily

115
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,960
Looking like a nautch girl!
- Do I look like a real nautch girl?

116
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,790
Captain Hewson, you must know

117
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,840
I am unfamiliar with the detail of the
attire of dancing girls

118
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,270
Ms Kent, the costume is perfect

119
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,580
Any nautch girl in India would
blush with envy

120
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,380
You keep the company of nautch girls,
Captain Gordon?

121
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,550
I pursue beauty wherever I can find it

122
00:15:59,190 --> 00:15:59,850
Toast

123
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,520
The queen

124
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,720
The Queen... to the Queen

125
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh! So sorry!

126
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,500
You black bastard

127
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,470
What the hell are you upto?

128
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,250
Sir, sorry sir. Please...

129
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,310
You, lift him

130
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,050
Hewson, that's enough

131
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,330
I'll teach you to touch a
white woman you black dog!

132
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,180
Forgive me sir, it was an accident

133
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,460
Enough sahib

134
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,300
Enough

135
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,970
The black dog will die

136
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,480
Miss Kent... on behalf of...
- It's not to me that you owe the apology

137
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,550
Come inside

138
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,150
Pull the fan

139
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,720
Faster

140
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,190
Harder, damn you

141
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,570
Kamla!

142
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,610
Oh god, one push into her paradise...

143
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,950
and I'll pull your fan in hell forever

144
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,030
The quartermaster showed
Gordon the new Enfield rifle...

145
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,260
that the Company was going
to introduce in India

146
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,600
Absolute beauties...

147
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,340
And speaking of beauties...

148
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,040
I saw you appreciating
Ms. Kent in a sari

149
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,250
Me... On the Company's pay?

150
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,910
Ah! But Kent is filthy rich

151
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,690
Vultures and merchants of arms.
The only ones to profit from wars, yes!

152
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,190
Amazing! The Company has connected
the entire country through wires

153
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,500
In a blink of an eyelid messages travel
from Calcutta to Delhi

154
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,000
Nonsense! Lmpossible!

155
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,010
It's got to be true! It's in the newspaper!

156
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,010
But how can messages get into wires?

157
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,440
I'll tell you. Easy! These whites have
mastered black magic

158
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,220
Yeah! Must've used a witch's hair

159
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,650
Yes and it's got an odd name too
...taelly - garaffe

160
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,190
What? Wow! That sounds scary

161
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,660
You bet your ass! We're all
in for a jolly ride now

162
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,030
Coming... coming...

163
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,710
I'm here now, my love

164
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:56,050
Here we are, I know you're hungry

165
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,320
You're dry

166
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,460
That white woman's baby
has sucked you dry

167
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,560
What's left for him?

168
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,400
Here, use this on your nipple,
it'll make him sleep

169
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,250
Don't you dare give opium to my baby

170
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:26,910
Hey, hey my baby, my love,
why are you crying?

171
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,250
Why are you crying?

172
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,590
Hush now, aren't you the son of a warrior?

173
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,490
Why is he always crying?

174
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,760
No nothing, it's just colic

175
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,760
Come on Veeru, we're late for the pit

176
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,090
Coming, coming

177
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,430
Come on, get him!

178
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,290
Scissor-throw! Give him the
scissor-throw!

179
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,140
Where's Mangal? - In the wrestling pit, sir

180
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
Captain sahib...

181
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,760
want to try your strength
against a black man?

182
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,000
Uh-oh, he's had it now!

183
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,010
Bravo Captain sahib, way to go!

184
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,520
Come on Mangal, don't spare him!

185
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,700
Why didn't you come today?

186
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,200
Tell me

187
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,710
I was angry

188
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,220
Angry? Why?

189
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,550
Hewson was killing that man...

190
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,050
and you did nothing

191
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,900
What was I supposed to do? Stand between
a fellow officer and a...

192
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,230
And a black dog!

193
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,060
Say it... say it!

194
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,300
You don't understand

195
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,420
I've spent half my life here,
the best part of my life!

196
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,240
What have I got to go back to?

197
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,680
You still did nothing

198
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,920
You're right, I should've stopped him
from whipping any black dog

199
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,260
I'm sorry, all right?

200
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,430
All right?

201
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,770
Now... are you still angry
with me huh? Huh?

202
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,100
All right, no... no

203
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,610
I'm beaten. You're forgiven

204
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:53,120
Bhang, my friend, elixir of the gods,
is Lord Shiva's favoured potion

205
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:02,300
Come on Mangal, have some bhang,
liven your spirits

206
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,960
Want to have some bhang, sahib?
- Er... bhang? Doesn't it, you know...

207
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,970
Don't worry, it doesn't bite or scold.
It's like a good mother

208
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,810
Strokes you, sings you lullabies
tells you stories...

209
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,640
and kisses you to sleep.
- Well, I'll have to try some of that

210
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,990
Because my mother certainly
never did any of that

211
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:33,220
Easy sahib, easy. You don't want two
stepmothers quarrelling in your head

212
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,500
Ration and roti, the Company's pay

213
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,840
Give us your life for a shilling a day

214
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,840
Shilling a day boys, a shilling a day

215
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,910
While the boom of the cannon
may blow you away!

216
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:24,710
Mangal... that's Hewson's horse

217
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,540
Come on

218
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,090
Bastards! Which bastard did this?

219
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,650
My silly heart can't contain its
excitement...

220
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,810
when everything gets going for
a nobody like me

221
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,820
May Lord Ram bless you, Mangal

222
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,820
Ram - Ram

223
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,330
AsSalaamu Alaykum Mirza sahib.
- Ram - Ram, Mangal

224
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,650
All well?

225
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,160
Oye! You cockeyed fool!
Can't you see?

226
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,330
A twisted rope is strongest,
a twisted eyesight, deepest

227
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,160
Don't touch me, you scoundrel.
You want to defile a Brahmin?

228
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,170
Come on, we're all untouchables now.
The Company reigns. All trash is equal

229
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,350
Mind your tongue, you dog.
- Dog? Me?

230
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,510
Who barks to guard the Company's loot?
You or me?

231
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,340
Oh! You deserve a thrashing, wait

232
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,850
And who wags his tail for the white man?
You or me?

233
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,020
And who's going to bite the new
cartridge dipped in animal fat?

234
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,860
Animal fat? - Yes. Cow and pig fat

235
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,860
That's used to grease the new cartridge

236
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,700
Into the mouth... bite... fire... boom!
Go straight to hell

237
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,540
Boom goes your faith, boom
goes your honour

238
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,170
Shut up, liar!

239
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,560
Silence

240
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,390
This is no fish market

241
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,160
Let one man speak

242
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,570
Mangal Pandey. Sepoy, 5th Company.
34th Native Infantry Regiment

243
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,400
34th eh? At ease

244
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,630
What is it?

245
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,400
Sir, we hear that the cartridge of
the new rifle is greased...

246
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,230
and must be bitten before loading.
- And what of it?

247
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,170
Sir, the grease coating is
made of cow and pig fat

248
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,250
The cow is sacred to the Hindus,
the pig forbidden to the Muslims

249
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,420
We can't touch such a cartridge.
It is sacrilege

250
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,920
Who is spreading this rot?

251
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,590
The news is all over, sir

252
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,760
Nonsense! No truth to it, my man

253
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,800
Hasn't the Company always
cared for you?

254
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,370
Now don't worry and go home.
Some mischief-monger is misleading you

255
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:15,610
There is no such cartridge.
There will be no such cartridge

256
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,020
Dismissed

257
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,620

at a throwaway price

288
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,390
Buy yourself a slave...

289
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Look at this beauty, check out
her curves

290
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,070
Slave or servant...

291
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,560
wife or whore...

292
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,400

Make your bid. - Eleven

Stop kidding

296
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,080
Fifteen

297
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,420
Emily was surprised that though slavery
was abolished in Britain...

298
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,520
the Company allowed it in India.

299
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,590
Gordon explained that the Company
itself bought these girls...

300
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,600
for the pleasure of white soldiers It helped
prevent the spread of disease in the army

301
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,930
I have a gem here

302
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,260
Let me show you

303
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,340
Hands off, you pimp!

304
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,440
Bloody bitch!

305
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,780
Don't mess with me

306
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,610
She's a spirited mare eh?

307
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,450
Just waiting to be reined in

308
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,780
So who's going to be the lucky man?
Come on, let's hear it

309
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,790
Sixty Rupees

310
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,060
I think I've seen enough

311
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,460
Seventy

312
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,630
Eighty Rupees

313
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,300
That's better, eighty

314
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,700
Anyone else?

315
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,030
Quick! Or this meat will go to the whites
and you'll be left ogling

316
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,140
Wow, what eyes...

317
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,710
the entire Company Raj could
drown in them

318
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,320
What's your name?

319
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,160
Come on stand up... up

320
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,920
Let's get a look at you

321
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,660
Turn around

322
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,500
Packaging seems all right

323
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,500
All right?! By God she's a gem,
a real diamond

324
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,180
Okay then, let's call her that.
Heera (Diamond)

325
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,610
But she needs polishing

326
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,610
Get one thing straight, girl,
I am Lol Bibi

327
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,080
And I'm the boss here

328
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:22,190
Many trinkets like you decorate my shoes.
Got that?

329
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,030
And one more thing...

330
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,860
this is a pleasure house
exclusively for the whites

331
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,360
You'll have to work very hard

332
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:38,340
Men aren't easy to please,
no matter what their colour

333
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,210
That's true! Ask me, I have suffered
all the various shades!

334
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,550
One of the Company's biggest trades
was that of opium.

335
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,730
It forced Indian farmers to grow it,
bought it from them at a pittance...

336
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,460
and sold it in China at a profit.

337
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,230
When the Chinese Emperor resisted...

338
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,240
the Company waged a war against him.

339
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,240
To fight and die, Indian sepoys
were there after all.

340
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,410
And they called it the Free Market.

341
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,120
Captain Gordan,
You were meant to be singing too...

342
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,620
I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with the song.

343
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,380
Not know it?
What are you, some sort of a pagan?

344
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,590
Didn't they thrash it
into you in school?

345
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,060
No sir.

346
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,090
They should've.
Which school did you attend?

347
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,790
Let me guess,
it wasn't Marlborough or Rugby?

348
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,040
No sir, my family are Catholics,
from Glasgow. I went to parish school

349
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,670
A papist! Come to think of it,
I haven't seen you at church.

350
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,540
I must have imagined you were
with your famous nautch girls.

351
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,550
Aren't they beautiful?
I picked them on our ride this evening

352
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,630
Ah, you must have ridden out
in the direction of Kashigunj?

353
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,630
Yes, I was astounded.
Acres of bright red poppies

354
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,660
Are they part of some religious ritual?

355
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,490
No, no. It's Company land.

356
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,930
Why does the Company grow poppies?

357
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,310
The poppy, Miss Kent
is the sole source of opium

358
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,640
The Honourable East India Company
forces Indian farmers to grow them

359
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,350
Opium?
- Indeed. Most of it is bought up...

360
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,650
by the Company at prices fixed by them.
And then shipped to China...

361
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,390
to help turn an entire nation
into opium addicts

362
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,720
But why?

363
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,960
It's the only thing
we can sell the Chinese...

364
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,160
in return for the tea and silks
that we Europeans are addicted to

365
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,670
I think Gordon, the ladies
ought to be spared this lecture

366
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,170
But the Chinese Emperor resists,
he no longer wants to trade in opium

367
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,340
So the company decides to
wage a war against him

368
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,350
And in this war it wants
Indian sepoys to fight and die

369
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,020
The circle is complete...

370
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,020
and we call it the free market

371
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,760
You abuse my hospitality

372
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,370
If I have spoken out of turn sir,
I apologise

373
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,910
After all I'm just a common soldier

374
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,900
It's a subject
you'd know more about than I

375
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,710
When Kent humiliated Gordon about his
humble beginnings...

376
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,610
Gordon couldn't stand for it.

377
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,390
William... I'm so sorry
- Emily, there's no need

378
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:57,640
Gordon liked Emily, but realized that
he did not belong in this elite circle.

379
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,980
When traders become rulers then
the common man pays the price

380
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,250
But now Nana Saheb will make
the Company pay

381
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,250
Really? How?

382
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,590
His minister, Azimullah, has returned from
England with Queen Victoria's letter...

383
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,260
which clearly states that Nana Saheb is
right and the Company is wrong

384
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:26,100
Futile. Nana Saheb has only a letter
while the Company has guns

385
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,930
But sir, the gun is a treacherous lover,

386
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,940
there's no telling whom she'll set
her sights upon!

387
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,130
What's up?

388
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,630
What the bloody hell is going on?

389
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,900
Broken axle, sir. Two boxes of cartridges
have fallen down

390
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,260
The new Enfield...

391
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,400
is the best rifle in the world

392
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,670
It will feel no different to your musket

393
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,840
A bit lighter

394
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:47,420
Accurate to a thousand yards,

395
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,750
five times the range of your
old Brown Bess

396
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:59,630
And now, the new cartridge.
It consists of gunpowder and a lead

397
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,430
You pick up the cartridge and
bite the end off, like so

398
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,110
You pour the gunpowder in,

399
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,880
followed by the lead

400
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,880
And then...

401
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,650
you ram the Johnny down.
Ram it down, tight

402
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,310
Then you're ready to fire

403
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,900
You... try

404
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,670
You... and you

405
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,910
Come on lads, look lively

406
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,070
Come on, it won't bark back

407
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,750
Corporal...

408
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,750
Yes sir? - What is the matter?

409
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,080
The grease, sir. We cannot put
the grease in our mouth

410
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,250
Then where will you put it, man?
Come on, be sensible

411
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,830
What's the matter, Captain?

412
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,700
It's the cartridges, sir.

413
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,870
The sepoys say they saw dogs
licking grease off them in the bazaar

414
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,770
They saw what?

415
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,900
Dogs, licking the new cartridges

416
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,280
The men believe they've been greased
with the fat of pigs and cows, sir

417
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,610
And are they?

418
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,280
The Company's supplier, sir.
I checked with him. And he assured me...

419
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,610
there was no truth to it

420
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,780
There you are, Captain White man's word.
Knock the superstition out of them

421
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,820
Still sir, shouldn't we be careful?
- You heard me, Captain

422
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,050
The Quartermaster claimed that
the cartridges were clean.

423
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,620
A white man's word was good
enough for the general.

424
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,530
He ordered Gordon to set
the soldiers' fears to rest.

425
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:57,210
The Company respects all religions
and will never break faith

426
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:04,820
And I, as an officer of the Company
give you my word...

427
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,660
that this cartridge is greased with
neither the fat of pigs or cows

428
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:18,430
Will a loyal sepoy please step forward
and volunteer to fire the gun.

429
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,580
What am I supposed to tell him now?
He has already done what he had to

430
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,250
We can't let this pass.
We must confront him with this

431
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,250
You think he'll listen to us?
- Here he comes. Talk to him

432
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,750
Aye Mangal, why did you
bite the bullet?

433
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,920
You're an outcaste now.
You'll pay for it.

434
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,760
Just because you speak a little English,
you think you're a bloody white man?

435
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,930
Now because of you,
they'll force us as well

436
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,330
Shut your miserable mouths

437
00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:00,270
Gordon sahib said they're clean.
That's enough for me.

438
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,200
And what if Gordon sahib is lying?

439
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,940
Gordon sahib will never lie to me

440
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,210
That's fine, but what if the cartridge-story
turns out to be true?

441
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,450
Then I'll burn the company down

442
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,350
Now scram!

443
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,350
There. Look at that attitude

444
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,360
Gordon sahib, Will you tell me something?

445
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,170
Yes, Why not?

446
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,810
What is the Company?

447
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,380
Why do you ask?

448
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,910
I need to know

449
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:50,590
Company...?

450
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:00,990
A Company is an entity created entirely
for the purpose of making a profit

451
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,500
And what does it do?
- What does it do!

452
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,000
Well it buys and sells, anything.
Indigo, spices, opium

453
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,410
Love, honour, truth... anything

454
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:22,520
Yes but... who is the Company?

455
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,620
In your story of the Ramayan...

456
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,530
you have a character Ravana.
The chap with ten heads, right?

457
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,110
Well, the Company has thousands of heads...

458
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,540
all stuck together with the glue of greed.
You understand?

459
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,330
Hey, is that a Sati?

460
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,460
Come on

461
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,790
Gordon sahib, I don't think we should.
- Come on, it's a Sati!

462
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,830
Glory to woman who accompanies
her husband in death

463
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,870
Glory be!

464
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,940
Stop this

465
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,180
I said, stop this immediately!

466
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,450
Come here, come along

467
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,450
Sahib, you better leave.
These are sacred ceremonies

468
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,960
But Sati has been banned.
Burning a widow is a crime

469
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,120
Captain sahib, don't interfere.
You're tampering with our ancient customs

470
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,460
And you're tampering with my ancient custom.
I don't stand by and watch murder

471
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,130
Return the woman.
Or you'll regret it

472
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,970
You'll have to kill me first!

473
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,080
Come on!

474
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,650
Get him!

475
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,980
Lynch him

476
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,560
Anybody who dares touch
the sahib is a dead man

477
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,670
Sahib, save the girl!
I'll deal with these bastards

478
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,840
Go sahib... go... go

479
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,550
Oh God! A Sati!
But she is alive!

480
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,550
You're damn right she is!

481
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,380
But they will come for her!
It's a question of their honour

482
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:46,490
Return her, sahib!
- No one will touch her!

483
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,280
That's the law

484
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,300
What are we going to do
with her, Mangal?

485
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:06,580
Her relatives will surely kill her.
She has nowhere to go

486
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,390
Come out

487
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,630
Don't be afraid

488
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,170
You're safe here

489
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,780
No one will touch you

490
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,840
Come

491
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,900
How are you feeling?
Did you sleep?

492
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,840
What's your name?

493
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,080
I am going to work but don't worry...

494
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:57,780
I have posted guards.
You'll be safe

495
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,020
They will come... for me

496
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,520
Who?

497
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,550
Relatives

498
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,930
My husband was a powerful man,
lord of a hundred villages

499
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,800
I'm sorry you lost him.
Any children?

500
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,440
No, he was very old.
Sixty, when he married me

501
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,980
He had grown-up children

502
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,740
He was very sick

503
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,220
Sahib the village chieftain
has come to meet you

504
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,750
He says it's important

505
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,990
Go in... and don't worry

506
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:47,070
Sahib, don't play with our honour

507
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,240
What do you mean?

508
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,810
Return the woman to us

509
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,270
What? So that you can kill her?

510
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,650
That is her destiny

511
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,680
Not anymore

512
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,920
Don't involve yourself in matters
you don't understand

513
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,920
That will not be good for you

514
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,690
Are you threatening an officer of
the East India Company?

515
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,200
You listen to me!

516
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,600
You so much as set foot into
the Cantonment again,

517
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,740
and I will shoot you!
You understand me?

518
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,840
Do you understand me?

519
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,300
Now get out

520
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,750
In the course of his investigations
into corruption in the Company...

521
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:39,720
Lockwood raided the godown of
a Parsee merchant, Sorabjee.

522
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,850
Search the place

523
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,290
There is no need for all that, Sir

524
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,020
Search it. - It is all legitimate

525
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,530
The search uncovered
stocks of opium.

526
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,170
Sir, look at this

527
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,570
Seal the stock, arrest this man.
- Sergeant-major...

528
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,440
Mr Lockwood, you are a man
of high powers

529
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,270
But you've been here only
a few days, sir

530
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,420
You must try to understand
- Mr Sorabji you are aware...

531
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,420
that The East India Company has
a monopoly on the opium trade

532
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,920
It is obvious, you have been indulging
in your own private dealings

533
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,690
Mr Lockwood, I am acquainted
with you British...

534
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,060
and I have had dealings for years
with the Company officials

535
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,240
I will be very proud to make you
part of our arrangements

536
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,800
Are you offering to bribe me,
you blackguard!

537
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,440
Sir, I have the deepest respect
for you as a gentleman

538
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,540
I am simply trying to explain
how trade works in India

539
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,210
It could be beneficial to you.
- You mistake me sir

540
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,750
I'm here to bury corruption, not fan it.
- Corruption is a strong word, sir

541
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,790
It is our custom, as Indians,
to give small gifts

542
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,290
I must quieten your displeasure
and pay a fine. 300 pounds in gold?

543
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,460
Damn your eyes!

544
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,630
Three thousand pounds

545
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,360
Now?

546
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,030
Three... thousand... pounds!

547
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,930
India is rich, sir

548
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,710
Lockwood did not succumb to Sorabjee's
offer of a huge bribe.

549
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,370
Instead he forced Sorabjee to
name the villages...

550
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,070
from which he bought the opium.

551
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,610
Every man is reminded...

552
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,950
that growing, buying or
selling opium...

553
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,090
without the permission
of the Company...

554
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,730
is illegal and punishable

555
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,990
You have broken the law

556
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,230
Therefore by the order of
the Collector and Magistrate...

557
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:38,840
your land and property is
hereby confiscated!

558
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,670
But how are we to blame?

559
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,140
White sahibs tell us to grow, we grow.
White sahibs tell us to sell, we sell

560
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,080
Don't take our lands sahib!
Where will we go?

561
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,580
Have mercy, sahib

562
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,020
For god's sake, have mercy

563
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,660
Get your hands off

564
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,030
The Company is cruel!

565
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,500
Get out! Go away!

566
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,100
Our children will starve!
- Leave us alone

567
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:19,620
Fire!

568
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,680
No sir!

569
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,790
That's not necessary,
I'll deal with this

570
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,850
I said fire!

571
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,470
No... no... don't shoot.
- We're your brothers

572
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,990
What are you thinking?

573
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,730
Does this happen back home
in my village as well?

574
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:53,370
We're soldiers. It's our job to fight,
to kill

575
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,470
To kill an unknown enemy is easy.
But to kill people who are your own...

576
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,750
You were obeying orders, Mangal

577
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,230
That's our duty That is the price of
the salt we eat

578
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,620
Sometimes I wonder if there are more
important things in life than salt

579
00:56:49,030 --> 00:57:01,240
I'm a slave to your charms

580
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:16,220
I'm a slave to your charms

581
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:26,190
I'm a slave to your charms

582
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:36,840
I'm a slave to your charms

583
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,640
Your love for me is like...

584
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:47,320
Your love for me is like...
a honey-dipped dagger

585
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:53,260
I'm a slave to your charms

586
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,660
Your burning gaze pierces
me like arrows

587
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:05,830
Where did you learn such deadly skill?

588
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,680
My heart's wounded...
but the pain is so exquisite

589
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:19,750
I'm a slave to your charms

590
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:59,460
Once I was a blossoming bud...

591
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:10,240
flowering in a garden of sunshine

592
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,640
No restless days,

593
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,540
no sleepless nights

594
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,150
I was innocent and carefree...

595
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,750
and then I met you!

596
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:28,760
Oh, what a price I'm paying
for having trusted you...

597
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,060
oh, what a price I'm paying
for having trusted you!

598
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:51,840
Your love for me is like...
a honey-dipped dagger

599
00:59:52,050 --> 01:00:03,120
I'm a slave to your charms

600
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,000
She has already been promised
for the first night...

601
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,910
to the Company's senior officer.
You cannot take her sahib, I beg you

602
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,680
Out of my way woman,
I'm taking her

603
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:06,380
No, not for double the money, please

604
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:09,790
Her first night will be with me
and that's what she wants to...

605
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,360
don't you darling!
- Don't create trouble for me

606
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,530
Enough!

607
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,630
Did you not hear!
The woman said something. Leave the girl

608
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,500
One more word out of you and
I'll have you horsewhipped!

609
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,380
You're not going anywhere!

610
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,050
Bastard!

611
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,480
I'll get you for this, you nigger!

612
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:43,750
I'll teach you a lesson,
you son of a whore!

613
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:55,900
I say, leave him!

614
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:15,150
You scoundrels!
You're wrecking my shop

615
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,430
No! Not upstairs!

616
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,160
You'll destroy my rooms!
Who'll pay for the damage?

617
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,190
You still haven't told me your name

618
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:25,990
Jwala

619
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,330
Hey stop! - It's urgent

620
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,970
Where are you going?
- We need to meet Gordon sahib

621
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,660
Gordon sahib! He's killing Mangal!
- What... who?

622
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,570
Hewson sahib has gone to
the jail to kill Mangal Pandey

623
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,760
You dog! You dare assault an officer!

624
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,490
Say you are a dog

625
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,660
Say you are a dog!

626
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,340
You are a dog

627
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,090
Make the black bastard shit blood

628
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,920
Stop... stop it

629
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,830
Four men against one!
You cowardly bastard

630
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,560
You think you can kill this man
and get away with it?

631
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,600
The commandant won't take a
black man's word for it, will he?

632
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:19,670
Well, if he'll take a white man's
he'll bloody well take mine

633
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,740
You sir, you're no white man

634
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,250
Let's get out of here

635
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:29,850
Come on

636
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:03,550
Cheers to Mangal! Long live Mangal!

637
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,980
Next

638
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,920
Quick, lift it up. You wouldn't be here
if you were the shy sort

639
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:26,110
C'mon doc, quit peeping up skirts all day.
Treat a hero for once!

640
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,040
Isn't he the one who fought
with Captain Hewson?

641
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,010
No! He's the one who taught
him a lesson!

642
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:39,020
Come baby! I could teach you
a lesson or two myself

643
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:44,190
Oh dear! What a waste of energy!
Why don't you try your strength on us?

644
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,960
Yes! I've never tasted a hero

645
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:53,300
For you it'll be free. In fact,
we'll pay

646
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:58,840
Shut up! Go sell your bodies
to the whites... go

647
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,140
We just sell our bodies,

648
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,810
you soldiers sell your souls!

649
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:23,060
In the course of my investigations
I have discovered

650
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:26,400
that you have been compromising
senior officers,

651
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,670
falsifying accounts, in fact sir,
you have been cheating the company

652
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,310
I have done nothing
that others have not done before me

653
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,250
You have been smuggling opium
into China on your own behalf, Mr Kent

654
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:44,780
You have evidence?

655
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,490
Lockwood accused Kent of carrying
on illegitimate trade in opium...

656
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,500
and produced Sorabjee as evidence.

657
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:02,430
You wanted me to go to prison for you.
- No sir, you pay for your own sins

658
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:09,440
Mr Lockwood, you would persuade
a native to point a finger at me!

659
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,440
I'm just a puppet in his hands, sir

660
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,080
If you lay a hand on me...

661
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:18,520
the reverberations will reach
the House of Lords

662
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:23,380
Kent warned Lockwood
that taking him on...

663
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:27,130
Lockwood could be taking on
the House of Lords.

664
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:42,680
Anyone there?

665
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,550
Hukum Singh

666
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,270
I'm used to it, sahib

667
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,940
But I'm not

668
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:45,300
It's all right, come on

669
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,310
What are you doing?

670
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,050
Give me the gun

671
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,050
Give me the bloody gun!

672
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,840
I don't want you to go

673
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,440
I was just at Lol Bibi's...

674
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:46,680
your Juliet is really worried
about you, mate

675
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,080
She sent milk for you,
specially laced with turmeric

676
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,950
But I'm an untouchable and what
I've touched you won't consume

677
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,180
So I saved you the dilemma and
I drank it myself!

678
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,260
I want to meet her

679
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,970
Oh, so the fire rages here
as well

680
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:13,370
But how? You aren't a white man,
eunuch or an untouchable.

681
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,040
I want to meet her

682
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,330
What's your name?

683
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:15,770
Heera

684
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:19,970
What caste?

685
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:28,620
People on sale have none. Whoever pays
gets to choose my caste

686
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,890
Where are you from?

687
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:36,290
Don't know

688
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,260
As a child I was kidnapped, then sold

689
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,800
Since then, it's been one
sale after another

690
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,040
Want to escape?

691
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,340
Escape? With you?

692
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,290
You're badly hurt

693
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:33,070
Did you drink the milk I sent?

694
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,010
Ya

695
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,920
Lying to me?

696
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:47,860
Lol Bibi is looking for you

697
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,900
You'll get into trouble

698
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:33,470
Like the fish thrashes helplessly in a net...

699
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:42,580
so do I in your love

700
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:45,580
At the core of my being...

701
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:51,260
I feel an insatiable thirst...

702
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:59,830
and my every nerve is aflame

703
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:27,250
Oh tell me, lass, who's that
thief of your thoughts?

704
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:42,810
That philanderer, that scoundrel,

705
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:47,980
he sins in my head

706
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,450
That philanderer, that scoundrel,

707
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:01,220
he sins in my head

708
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:05,600
Locking his eyes with mine...

709
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:10,570
he steals my sleep and peace of mind

710
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:16,840
That trickster... oh my rascal lover

711
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,040
Slowly but surely...

712
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,380
she falls in his trap

713
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,680
As the flames begin to lick her...

714
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:27,350
her veil begins to slip

715
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,360
That trickster

716
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:38,530
Oh my rascal lover

717
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,700
Oh tell me, lass, who is he?

718
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:46,870
Who's that thief of your dreams?

719
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:56,480
He's a soldier, a brave warrior,
who by my word, has stolen my heart

720
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,020
I didn't think at first sight that
he would possess me so

721
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,350
But my heart began to beat aloud...

722
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,180
and I knew I was lost

723
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,420
How I panicked...

724
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:42,600
and burned with shame...

725
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,100
when he took my hand and
pulled me close

726
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,500
Then clouds of desire gathered,

727
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:54,200
and burst forth with love's rain.
Oh that trickster

728
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,450
Oh you scoundrel

729
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,070
What's up Davar?

730
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,340
Damn you, Nainsukh!

731
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,180
You cockeyed scoundrel! Can't you find
someone else to bump into?

732
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:13,950
Who better than you, now that we're
both the same... untouchables

733
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,780
What nonsense, you swine!

734
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:19,760
Well, you've bitten the bullet
and licked the fat

735
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,290
You've lost your caste, you have
nothing left to lose now

736
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,860
Shut up... that's a lie!

737
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:27,130
Your "lie" is being manufactured
in a factory in Calcutta

738
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,430
Want to see for yourself?

739
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:30,970
Do you?

740
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:41,940
Come, my brothers, come

741
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:47,490
I won't stay silent any longer,
even if it costs me my life!

742
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:51,560
It's true about the cartridges.
See for yourself, pig fat and cow fat

743
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:04,900
May the devil stay away!

744
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,910
Is this your factory?
- Only in name...

745
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,410
the real owner is an Englishman

746
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:20,520
I am a god-fearing man, brothers,
I respect both Hindus and Muslims

747
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:24,090
Then why did you use cow
and pig fat?!

748
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:28,190
The Company would have used
crow fat if that was cheaper

749
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,330
Mangal...?

750
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,970
You lied to me!

751
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:20,480
I trusted you and you lied me

752
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,610
What're you talking about?
- I saw it with my own eyes

753
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,620
The factory, the cartridge,
the grease...

754
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,490
made with cow and pig fat

755
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:34,230
Oh God, no...

756
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,990
I'm now an outcaste

757
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,530
You know what it means to
be an outcaste?

758
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,160
My entire community will shun me

759
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:44,770
They will no longer touch me,
speak to me, eat with me,

760
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,500
or burn my body when I die

761
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:50,580
For them I am an untouchable.
I no longer exist. I am a nobody

762
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,580
Mangal, listen to me...
- You lied to me!

763
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:55,180
Listen to me, I didn't know!
They lied to me

764
01:21:55,390 --> 01:22:02,690
You plunder our land, you abuse
our faith and now...

765
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,430
you want our Souls? Sahib... you've
enjoyed a black man's loyalty

766
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,030
Now taste his fury

767
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:14,560
Mark my words, Captain sahib!
This cartridge will explode

768
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,240
And it will bring to an end
the Company Raj

769
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:27,610
Take back you pistol, Captain sahib.
We're brothers no more

770
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,500
Don't...

771
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:29,470
If you are an untouchable then so am I

772
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,210
Mangal, we're all with you

773
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:41,390
A wrong done unknowingly is not a sin

774
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,850
That's what the scriptures say as well

775
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:59,640
This cartridge controversy
could spin out of control sir.

776
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,140
We have tried to introduce it twice,
in different regiments without success.

777
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:05,850
I would recommend caution.

778
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:10,180
Damn it we can't succumb
to such blind superstition

779
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,450
May seem like superstition
to us sir, but to the sepoys...

780
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,580
it's an extremely sensitive issue.
It strikes them at their core.

781
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:22,820
Gordon urged his senior officers
to respect the sepoys' feelings...

782
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:26,000
and withdraw the cartridge.
He was reminded that...

783
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:32,660
the country was ruled by a Company
which could not suffer losses.

784
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:45,680
Colonel Mitchell claimed that
his sepoys were loyal...

785
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,680
and would do his bidding.
So it was decided...

786
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:54,190
that a contingent from Barrackpore
be sent to Behrampore...

787
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,530
a hundred miles away... where they would be
forced to use the cartridge, by example.

788
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:48,080
Mitchell ordered the sepoys from
both the Behrampore...

789
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:54,090
and Barrackpore regiments...
to use the cartridge.

790
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:58,090
First company, first platoon,

791
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:01,090
step forward and pick up
your rifles and the cartridges

792
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,940
Subedar

793
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:14,940
What's the matter?

794
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,110
The new cartridge, sir.
The sepoys don't want to use it, sir

795
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,280
Damn it Bakht Khan

796
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,620
Now this is the Army

797
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:28,110
A soldier uses whatever arms and
ammunition he is asked to use

798
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:35,950
First company, first platoon,
step forward

799
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,460
Enough!

800
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:48,470
If you do not move I will blow you
apart with cannon!

801
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,320
Move the artillery forward

802
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,840
You will obey orders!

803
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,680
I will count till ten

804
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,340
One

805
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:30,180
Two

806
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,190
Three

807
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,030
Four

808
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:42,700
Five

809
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:46,200
Six

810
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,040
Seven

811
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,370
Eight

812
01:27:58,750 --> 01:27:59,870
Nine

813
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:32,570
Fire...

814
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:58,770
Dismiss the parade sir.
This could turn serious

815
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:01,940
Do it sir

816
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,610
For god's sake,
do it before it's too late!

817
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,610
Very well, dismiss the parade

818
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:16,120
Parade... dismiss!

819
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:56,330
Looting the armoury was wrong

820
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:59,160
Now we leave them no choice

821
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:02,300
What choice did we have?
Mitchell was about to blow us up.

822
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:05,840
That was just a bluff.
He doesn't have the authority

823
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,170
But now he has an excuse

824
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,180
He'll attack us and claim that
he's putting down a mutiny

825
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:14,010
They're coming to attack our
homes with horses and cannons!

826
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:21,190
Don't panic. Get ready with
your weapons

827
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,860
Come on

828
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,200
This is your commanding officer

829
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:44,540
Unless you lay down the arms
which you have looted...

830
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:48,880
I promise you,
I will give the orders of fire

831
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,890
We don't want bloodshed,
Colonel sahib.

832
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:56,220
Withdraw your guns and go in peace

833
01:30:56,930 --> 01:31:01,060
Surrender! This is your last chance

834
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:06,060
We are armed Colonel sahib!
We will fight

835
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,900
But sir, they are our own men

836
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,900
Not any more, can't you see
they are mutineers

837
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:15,070
Split up into four groups and
let each man carry two torches

838
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,580
Sir but we have no such commands
from the General

839
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:22,250
Don't you dare interfere with my authority

840
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,470
Please withdraw for now, sir.
Let me talk to them

841
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:29,810
All right do it, do it!

842
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,650
Listen up

843
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,320
This is corporal Bhola Tiwari speaking

844
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:40,660
Colonel Mitchell sahib has agreed
to withdraw the cannons

845
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,490
The English soldiers are
returning to their barracks

846
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:46,000
Please let them through

847
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,360
Fellow soldiers of India...

848
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:16,700
we have shed our blood
without complaint...

849
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:23,860
in the service of our foreign masters

850
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:28,370
For them, we have conquered
kingdom after kingdom

851
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,040
But in return...

852
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,710
what have we got?

853
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:40,720
Poverty, hunger and humiliation

854
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:45,060
Mangal, Gordon sahib is here

855
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,560
I'm not here on duty

856
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,900
I've come to speak with Mangal Pandey

857
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:07,570
Whatever you have to say,
you can say here. We're all friends

858
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,260
Give me a minute

859
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:33,770
Do you fully understand the implications
of what you're doing?

860
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,110
The Army will never,
never tolerate insubordination

861
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:43,110
You leave them no choice.
They will have to use force unless...

862
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,450
Unless what? Unless what sahib?

863
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:50,450
Unless we go down on our knees
and beg for mercy?

864
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:54,120
Swallow your cartridge and our honour?

865
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,460
Forget who we are and promise to
remain your slaves forever?

866
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,460
For too long our minds have rusted
in the service of foreign masters

867
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,640
All it takes is a little bit of grease to
make us remember who we are

868
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:13,140
I can understand how you feel.
I too feel angered...

869
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:18,150
when the Company is unreasonable,
when officers are unfeeling,

870
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:22,480
when rules are unfair,
but these differences...

871
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:25,160
must be resolved by reasonable means

872
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:31,670
This is the difference

873
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,160
Now what are the reasonable means?

874
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:52,180
News of the chaos at Behrampore had
reached the senior officers.

875
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:54,180
They were unhappy with Mitchell's
handling of the situation.

876
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:57,720
Mitchell is a fool

877
01:35:58,330 --> 01:36:00,390
This shouldn't have been allowed
to happen.

878
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:14,670
I've come to beg you to reconsider, sir.
Please withdraw the cartridges.

879
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:19,570
You don't expect an army to succumb
to a rumour do you, Captain?

880
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:22,610
This is not simply
a question of idle gossip, sir.

881
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:26,550
Gordon once again urged that the
cartridges be discontinued.

882
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,890
But the officials paid no heed to him.

883
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:35,730
Instead, they cast aspersions
on his loyalty, and said...

884
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:41,230
he could share his bed with a
native, but not his loyalty.

885
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,930
The British were worried that there were
very few white soldiers in Barrackpore.

886
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:21,100
They decided to send for
Queen Victoria's troops from...

887
01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:25,610
Rangoon to deal with the
rebelling sepoys.

888
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,450
And till Rangoon Regiment arrived...

889
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,280
they would stall for time
by ordering an enquiry.

890
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:39,950
I think we should accept the
Company's offer and return the guns

891
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,790
There will be only an inquiry,
no punishments

892
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,630
Let them save face

893
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:48,790
But we can win! For every British soldier,
we are seven sepoys

894
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:53,630
Even if we win Behrampore,
will it end the Company Raj?

895
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,970
So we take defeat without a fight?

896
01:37:56,180 --> 01:38:00,480
Have we learnt nothing from the British?
Rushing into battle is futile

897
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:07,980
But if we plan well, we can win.
Our country, our honour... everything

898
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:10,320
But for now we need time

899
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:22,160
O' Messiah, lead us into hope...

900
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:31,340
O' Messiah, lead us into hope

901
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:42,180
In fervent worship, I seek you...
like a moth seeks the flame

902
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:51,270
O' most merciful, benevolent God...
hear my plea

903
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:55,800
Lead me to your light,
show me the way

904
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:06,710
O' most merciful, benevolent God...
hear my plea

905
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:29,100
O' Messiah, lead us into hope

906
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:55,590
My heart is uneasy,
sleep and dreams elude me

907
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:02,430
I turn and toss as a storm grows
in my breast

908
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:11,100
What is to happen next?
Where does this story go?

909
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:15,440
The world waits with bated breath
for the saga to unfold

910
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,620
O' Lord...

911
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:19,120
O' Messiah...

912
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:24,790
Why these hurdles, why this trial by fire?

913
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,300
O' most merciful, benevolent God...
hear my plea

914
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,820
Welcome, friends, welcome...

915
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,980
welcome to the noble path

916
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:00,820
We are emissaries of King Nana Saheb

917
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:05,660
I am Azimullah and this is Chief of the
Maratha army, Tatya Tope

918
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,500
Please be seated

919
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,840
What brings you to us?

920
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:18,180
You are aware how the Company has,
through treachery and force...

921
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,850
snatched our kingdoms from us

922
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:24,350
They took Delhi, Awadh, Jhansi...

923
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:27,010
Everyone is angry

924
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:32,690
Nana Saheb has united all the kings...

925
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:36,020
to fight against the Company

926
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:42,030
We're here to invite you to join us

927
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:51,540
Invite us?

928
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,370
What is it, some feast?

929
01:41:55,750 --> 01:42:01,210
Your Rajahs and Nawabs have
gambled away their kingdoms

930
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:02,550
They've sold out to the company,
my friend

931
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:07,220
We have seen them grovel and
lay down their arms in front of us

932
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,560
What are they? Nothing

933
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:13,230
And you?

934
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:18,570
We are Hindustan.
The Company rules on our strength

935
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:22,570
The Company's native army
is the only force today...

936
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:26,210
with the numbers, the weapons
and the training to challenge the Company

937
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,410
And afterwards? Who will rule?

938
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,440
The people

939
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:36,750
Even in England, the Queen may be
on the coin, but the rule is of the people

940
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:43,090
The Company has always
won by dividing us...

941
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:48,430
by making us fight, king against king,
Hindu against Muslim

942
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:52,440
We have a common enemy... the Company

943
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:56,940
It's time to unite and fight against it

944
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:59,780
You want that we spill our blood to
throw the Company out...

945
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,110
and become your slaves again?

946
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,780
No! This is a fight for freedom

947
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:07,950
Freedom from our past,
freedom for our future

948
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:16,760
It is the need of the hour
that we bury our differences

949
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,960
We're ready to fight alongside the kings

950
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:27,630
But this revolution needs
a unifying symbol

951
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:30,640
And that can only be the
Red Fort in Delhi

952
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:33,310
If we agree...

953
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,310
to unite under the leadership of the
Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah...

954
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,480
then we have a deal

955
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:47,490
But Bahadur Shah is 82 years old

956
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:52,830
Yes, he is old and infirm...
but fed up of the Company's excesses

957
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:55,500
He needs us and we need him

958
01:43:56,870 --> 01:43:59,340
His flag will be our banner

959
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:14,250
We know the disposition, speed and
strength of the entire Company army

960
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,860
Barrackpore, Behrampore, Raniganj

961
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:26,030
Allahabad, Kanpur, Lucknow,
Meerut and Delhi

962
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,870
All large garrison towns

963
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:38,710
Three hundred thousand native sepoys
and only forty thousand British soldiers

964
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:45,050
If on the same day, at the same time,
all of us rise...

965
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:52,390
the Company won't know where to hide

966
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,960
In a single day, we disarm
every British soldier

967
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:02,300
And the Company Raj comes to an end!

968
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:11,410
Praise be to Allah!

969
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:17,410
Astrology predicts that the Company Raj
will end in a hundred years

970
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:22,310
And a hundred years, ends this May

971
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,250
Then let's fix the date

972
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:26,520
31st May

973
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:32,530
On that day, all of India will rise
and become free

974
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:36,200
It's Holi!

975
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:42,110
Holi is here, an explosion of colour

976
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:45,610
The bells ring out and drumbeats roll

977
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:48,940
The streets dance in drunken abandon

978
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:52,780
It's the season of joy, my love

979
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:22,820
You wretches! Where are you off to?

980
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:33,990
Look, Holi is here in a riot of colours,
painting one and all alike

981
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:39,000
Sorrows are lost, in new ecstasies
of blues, greens and reds

982
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,660
Look, Holi is here in a riot of colours,
painting one and all alike

983
01:46:43,870 --> 01:46:48,670
Sorrows are lost, in new ecstasies
of blues, greens and reds

984
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:53,340
I am going to be coloured anew...

985
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:56,680
this year the hues look richer

986
01:46:56,890 --> 01:47:01,850
No one can stop us now,
no one can hold us back...

987
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:07,350
No matter what... we are ready!

988
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:31,380
Look my love, I'm drenched in colours

989
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:36,050
And a little drunk, you sway
so mesmerisingly

990
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:40,390
How can I not let go and
enjoy this moment...

991
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:46,400
as you seduce me with your eyes?
- No one can stop us now

992
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:53,130
No one can hold us back...
no matter what... we are ready!

993
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:07,580
With a fistful of colours Lord Krishna
sneaks up on his lover

994
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:11,820
But Radha is quick as she is naughty
and gives it back as good as she gets

995
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:22,090
With a fistful of colours Lord Krishna
sneaks up on his lover

996
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:25,760
But Radha is quick as she is naughty
and gives it back as good as she gets

997
01:48:25,970 --> 01:48:31,110
As the lovers unite and the colours mix
Radha and Krishna become one

998
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:36,180
Which is Radha, which is Krishna
who can tell them apart?

999
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,460
Under a blanket of colours
our eyes lock, our hands touch

1000
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:56,130
We come closer and something
deep within me stirs

1001
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:00,800
This spell of love, this joyous abandon,
can you ever escape it?

1002
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:04,310
Don't ask that of me anymore

1003
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:09,470
No one can stop us now,
no can hold us back...

1004
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:14,880
no matter what... we are ready!

1005
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:23,890
The insolent behavior of the sepoys
Had the British officials worried.

1006
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:27,890
Just then, General Anson
received the news...

1007
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:31,630
that Rangoon Regiment was afloat
and would reach on...

1008
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:35,230
April 1st. Anson decided that when
the Queen's troops arrived...

1009
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:40,500
the rebel soldiers would be disarmed
and their leaders hanged.

1010
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:46,980
It would be such a lesson that no one
would dare rise for a hundred years.

1011
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:03,720
Mangal, they're going to kill you

1012
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:06,320
They've sent for the Rangoon Regiment

1013
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:08,930
What... Rangoon Regiment? When?

1014
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,330
1st April

1015
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,770
How do you know?

1016
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:15,440
Last night I was with Hewson

1017
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,100
He blurts out a lot when he is drunk.

1018
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:20,280
He said, once the Regiment gets here...

1019
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:25,780
they'll disarm the native sepoys
and hang their leaders

1020
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:30,290
I'm scared, Mangal! Save yourself...

1021
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:34,860
and save me... from this hell

1022
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,020
Mangal, I beg you

1023
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,130
Let's run away...

1024
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,030
anywhere

1025
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:46,230
No

1026
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,920
Heera, I cannot run away

1027
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:17,170
The situation has changed.
We can't wait till May

1028
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:21,170
But the kings need time to prepare.
- Time is what we don't have

1029
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:23,170
One wrong move can ruin everything

1030
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,000
Once the sepoys are disarmed,
who will do the fighting?

1031
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,840
Your Nana Saheb? Or Bahadur Shah?

1032
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:28,850
There's one way

1033
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:34,010
We've received orders to march from
Behrampore on 21st March...

1034
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:35,690
to reach Barrackpore on 30th March.

1035
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:38,690
Rangoon Regiment arrives on 1st April

1036
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:40,690
That gives us two days

1037
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:46,700
The moment we reach Barrackpore,
we'll take over the cantonment

1038
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:51,040
Then, before the Rangoon Regiment arrives,
we march to Calcutta.

1039
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:54,540
There we capture Fort William
and hold on to it...

1040
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:57,880
until the rebellion spreads
throughout the country

1041
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:09,560
Done with selling your milk
to that white bitch?

1042
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,380
Better that, than us starving

1043
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,890
You bitch! Talking back to me?

1044
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:21,390
Now their days are numbered!
- Yeah, in your dreams!

1045
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:23,570
Wait and see, their time's up!

1046
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,400
By the next full-moon... slaughter!

1047
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:32,410
Where...? In Barrackpore?

1048
01:53:32,610 --> 01:53:34,580
Everywhere. All across India!

1049
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:53,770
Memsaab, danger! Danger Memsaab!

1050
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:54,930
Wait

1051
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:00,940
What's going on, what danger?

1052
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,930
Baba is like my own son.
I don't want anything to happen to him

1053
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:15,950
Memsaab, you must leave!
- Why what's going on?

1054
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:22,120
The sepoys say Company Raj will end

1055
01:54:22,330 --> 01:54:23,960
They've been saying that for a
hundred years. It won't happen

1056
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:26,630
No! This time it's for real

1057
01:54:27,170 --> 01:54:30,300
Please take Baba and go back to
Englistan. Please

1058
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,470
You've taken a great risk, Kamla.

1059
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:04,660
Traitor! You dare to mutineer?
Now see what we do to your wife and child!

1060
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:08,670
What date have you devils set for this?

1061
01:55:18,150 --> 01:55:23,750
30th March

1062
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:27,060
Send dispatches immediately

1063
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:28,790
Stop the Behrampore Regiment
from reaching here.

1064
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:29,960
Contact Rangoon

1065
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,860
The Queen's Regiment must get here
before the 30th.

1066
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:37,700
Remember... your wife and child!

1067
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:46,380
On learning the rebels' plans,
General Hearsey ordered that...

1068
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:50,540
The Rangoon Regiment must reach
Barrackpore before 30th March.

1069
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:54,210
Meanwhile, the Behrampore Regiment
must be stopped en route...

1070
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:58,390
and prevented from reaching Barrackpore.

1071
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:06,220
Halt!

1072
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:16,740
Ah, Bakht Khan! - Why this halt, sir?

1073
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:19,240
A storm is brewing.
We stay here till it passes.

1074
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:24,080
But the Sepoys are tired... eager to reach
Barrackpore. They need to rest

1075
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:29,250
Really? Well I'm afraid
they must rest here

1076
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,760
I will go and explain it to them

1077
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:36,760
That won't be necessary

1078
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:19,470
What's up?

1079
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:21,970
What happened?

1080
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,640
White soldiers, a whole army!

1081
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:26,140
What? Where?

1082
01:57:26,350 --> 01:57:28,140
On the riverbank, I saw it myself

1083
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:30,650
Are you out of your mind?!

1084
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:32,820
Believe me, I swear by my mother!

1085
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:34,650
On the banks

1086
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:42,320
Come on... the Brits are here!

1087
01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:43,660
The Rangoon Regiment has arrived.

1088
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:45,490
Everyone to the Parade Ground. Quick!

1089
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,850
Sound the bugle! Call everyone, quick!

1090
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,340
This is not the time... - Blow the bugle

1091
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:08,350
Mangal! What's the matter?

1092
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:20,530
What's wrong with the Sergeant-Major?

1093
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:23,860
Don't go out. It is bad luck to spill milk

1094
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:25,370
It's an ill omen!
Something terrible is going to happen!

1095
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:27,540
Please don't go

1096
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:31,870
Don't worry, I'll be fine

1097
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:45,560
Come on! The time has come!
Time to fight, time to be free!

1098
01:58:45,790 --> 01:58:49,890
What happened Mangal, what's wrong?
- Get your weapons. The Brits are here

1099
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:53,570
The Rangoon Regiment has landed!
- But today isn't 1st April

1100
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:58,730
They came early. We have to act fast.
Go get your guns! Quick!

1101
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:00,910
To arms!

1102
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:04,080
But Bakht Khan's men aren't here yet.
- We need to wait for them

1103
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:07,410
We can't wait. We must attack,

1104
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:11,420
and capture the cantonment before
the Rangoon Regiment moves in

1105
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:14,090
Stop. Don't. You'll get us killed!

1106
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:17,590
There's no time! Come on, move! Move!

1107
01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:20,590
No no, wait! He's gone mad!

1108
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:23,920
Mangal your impatience
will get us killed!

1109
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:26,100
And this hesitation will
kill the rebellion!

1110
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:28,100
But Mangal, we are not ready yet

1111
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,600
It's now or never!

1112
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:33,930
What's wrong with you guys?

1113
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:38,940
Don't you see, the moment we have
all been waiting for is here!

1114
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:44,280
It's time to honour your pledge,
it's time to do or die

1115
01:59:44,990 --> 01:59:47,450
Pick up your guns and fight

1116
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,280
Fight for your freedom

1117
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:52,290
For once, fight for yourselves

1118
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:53,290
Fight!

1119
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:54,460
Come on!

1120
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:10,140
What's going on here!

1121
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:12,310
Who sounded the bugle?

1122
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:25,480
Mangal, stop

1123
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:32,160
Mangal... no...

1124
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:39,670
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1125
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:43,670
A handful of sepoys is no match
for the Rangoon Regiment

1126
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:44,840
That we shall see

1127
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:50,510
Then you leave me no choice

1128
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,050
Get the General

1129
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:28,380
Sir, it's begun

1130
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,980
The British Army

1131
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:03,320
Rangoon Regiment

1132
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:44,520
You are completely outnumbered

1133
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:49,020
Drop your guns and surrender, or die

1134
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:53,090
It's too late, Mangal. It's all over

1135
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:57,200
All of India is looking at us
If we surrender now...

1136
02:03:57,400 --> 02:04:00,860
the rebellion dies before it is born.
We can't let that happen

1137
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,200
I won't let that happen

1138
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:07,210
They are far too many,
it's no use. Let's run

1139
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:09,880
No... no...! - We can't win

1140
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:12,880
We will win, even if it takes
a hundred years

1141
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:17,220
Let's run Mangal... please,
or we'll all die!

1142
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:27,560
Go

1143
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:30,900
Spread the word

1144
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:33,400
It has begun

1145
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:36,240
Mangal the rebellion needs you!

1146
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,910
The rebellion needs blood

1147
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,910
Let it be mine

1148
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,930
ATTACK!

1149
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:09,780
Stop

1150
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:10,940
Don't fire

1151
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:11,770
Hold your fire

1152
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:16,110
I want him alive

1153
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:20,510
To the hospital! Quick! He mustn't die

1154
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:53,880
Awaken, arise and be blessed.
May all be blessed

1155
02:06:54,550 --> 02:06:59,540
Awaken, arise and be blessed.
May all be blessed

1156
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:05,390
The towns are awake, the homes
are abuzz, every village is astir

1157
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:11,220
Valleys awaken and so do their trees,
look, shadows are coming to life!

1158
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:20,900
Nana Saheb, Barrackpore has risen

1159
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:23,900
Soon the fire will spread all across

1160
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:26,250
But Tatya...

1161
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:32,080
Make up your mind Nana Saheb.
Seize the moment or perish

1162
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:37,750
No hand can stem the fire that
rages in people's hearts

1163
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:43,090
Eyes ablaze and spirits aflame,
no head will ever bow again

1164
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:48,770
A changed people fill the streets,
marching into death's embrace

1165
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:53,600
Greetings, Queen Lakshmibai.
- Welcome, Tatya

1166
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:59,610
The time has come,
earlier than we expected

1167
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:04,110
Good. Just what
I've been waiting to hear

1168
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:09,450
Rising like a storm unstoppable,
stirring the land in it's wake

1169
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:14,960
They swear to crush and finally
end this dark age of tyranny

1170
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:23,630
I'm an Emperor only in name.
I am weak, what can I do?

1171
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,960
A giant wave is rising, Your Majesty

1172
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:31,140
If we don't swim with it, we'll drown

1173
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:42,310
Awaken, arise and be blessed.
May all be blessed

1174
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:59,000
He will live

1175
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:15,520
There is still hope.
I have spoken to them

1176
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:19,180
If you tender a public apology,
they will let you live

1177
02:09:24,230 --> 02:09:29,860
Just say that it was a mistake
and you're sorry that's all

1178
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:32,870
Or they will hang you

1179
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:41,710
I am not sorry for my actions
and I am not scared to die

1180
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:46,210
So they cannot threaten me
or forgive me

1181
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:53,050
Mangal...

1182
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,890
I don't want you to die

1183
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:06,230
This is my fault, I let you do this,
I passed on a lie

1184
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:13,410
Gordon sahib, you did what you
could and I did what I had to

1185
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:17,580
My blood is not on your hands

1186
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:29,920
I've come to realise that what
I did and what I must do...

1187
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,430
has nothing to do with
bitting a bullet,

1188
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:37,430
and nothing to do with the
terror of becoming an outcaste

1189
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:44,940
I... believed that Nainsukh was
born an untouchable

1190
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:56,950
Now... we are all untouchables
in our own land

1191
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:09,130
Gordon sahib, our fight is no longer
against grease on a cartridge,

1192
02:11:11,670 --> 02:11:16,630
it is for our dignity, our freedom,

1193
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:20,640
our right to hold our head
as high as the next man

1194
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:31,990
You, the lie, the grease...

1195
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:42,500
I'd bite the bullet a hundred times
if it would give my freedom

1196
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:54,340
Mangal for god's sake we have
to stop this thing,

1197
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:57,180
or there will be terrible bloodshed

1198
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:02,860
You don't understand

1199
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:07,020
India is rising,

1200
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:09,860
nothing and nobody can stop it,

1201
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:16,360
not even my life

1202
02:12:27,810 --> 02:12:28,870
Mangal Pandey...

1203
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:33,050
did you on the 29th of March
incite the other sepoys...

1204
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:36,710
to rebel against the Company?

1205
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:41,890
Who were the others involved
in this conspiracy?

1206
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:50,230
On that morning, did you imbibe
any intoxicating drinks?

1207
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:51,730
This one called bhang, for instance?

1208
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:59,240
Let the record show that the
accused does not deny this

1209
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:04,610
It's obvious that the accused
has no interest whatsoever...

1210
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,410
in the proceedings
of this court martial. Therefore...

1211
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,150
we shall have to rely upon
testimonies of the eye witnesses...

1212
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:14,730
and the officers attacked and wounded
by the accused

1213
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:31,870
You have known Mangal Pandey
for the past seven years?

1214
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:35,580
I have known him sir,
as a brave soldier and a loyal friend

1215
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:38,440
One of the finest sepoys
to serve under my command

1216
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:42,680
Is it true that on the 29th of March
he attacked and injured you?

1217
02:13:43,420 --> 02:13:46,420
I cannot deny what happened sir,
but I would like you to look...

1218
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,460
at the circumstances that led to
his behaviour, - Answer in yes or no...

1219
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:54,470
Yes but the cartridge controversy
and the subsequent events...

1220
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:55,970
Yes or no Captain

1221
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:58,460
Just knowing
what happened is not enough

1222
02:13:58,570 --> 02:14:00,040
You have to understand
why it happened

1223
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:00,940
Yes or no!

1224
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:01,900
Yes

1225
02:14:02,810 --> 02:14:06,040
Is it not also true that
he subsequently murdered...

1226
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:08,650
two of your fellow officers
and injured four others?

1227
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:09,650
Yes

1228
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,080
That will be all, Captain

1229
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:12,740
No, that will not be all!

1230
02:14:15,190 --> 02:14:17,160
You will hear me speak damn it!

1231
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:22,720
Has this company become so blinded
by arrogance and greed that...

1232
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:24,990
it cannot see the danger
that stares it in the face?

1233
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:29,000
We stand surrounded
by our own army

1234
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:33,830
300,000 armed native soldiers
so disillusioned by our command,

1235
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:37,500
that they are on the verge of mutiny.
And what do we do to pacify them?

1236
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:39,510
We stoke the fire
of their indignation...

1237
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:42,580
by laughing at their concerns
or suppressing them with brutality

1238
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:46,740
But mark my words, if you hang
this man Mangal Pandey...

1239
02:14:46,890 --> 02:14:50,010
there will be rebellion,
bloody rebellion...

1240
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,690
that will sweep
through this land like wildfire

1241
02:14:52,830 --> 02:14:55,520
A rebellion that will lead
to the end of this Company Raj

1242
02:14:55,730 --> 02:14:57,200
Captain, enough!

1243
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:01,520
Gordon tried his best to save Mangal.

1244
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:07,870
He warned that if Mangal Pandey was
hanged there would be a bloody rebellion...

1245
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:10,700
That would put to an end the Company Raj.

1246
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:15,210
But even this warning fell on deaf ears.

1247
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:35,400
They failed to hang him this morning

1248
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:39,060
They have called for a
hangman from Calcutta

1249
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:43,240
They will hang him in public tomorrow,

1250
02:15:43,610 --> 02:15:45,580
and make a spectacle of his death

1251
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:12,210
Hearken o' people...

1252
02:18:12,930 --> 02:18:14,050
the drum sounds the call

1253
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:15,560
Now awake and arise

1254
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:17,060
From your sleep of ages

1255
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:29,900
Awaken, now awaken

1256
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:34,740
The Earth comes alive
as dawn heralds a new day

1257
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:38,750
Rivers sparkle with new life
and hope rises in oceans anew

1258
02:18:48,460 --> 02:19:19,650
Awaken, now awaken

1259
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:23,790
Pay heed to this moment in Time,

1260
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,630
though your eyes
disbelieve what they see

1261
02:19:27,830 --> 02:19:31,630
A man is leaving this world of man,

1262
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:35,640
see his head held proud and high

1263
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:39,300
Oh how fortunate is the mother,

1264
02:19:39,510 --> 02:19:43,640
who gave birth to such a son

1265
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:47,980
So fearless, he shall never die,

1266
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:51,160
even if life is taken from him

1267
02:20:21,550 --> 02:20:24,110
With such dignity does
this rebel take leave

1268
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:26,850
every head bows in respect

1269
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:32,260
On his lips the cry of freedom,
his heart's desire for all to see

1270
02:20:32,470 --> 02:20:37,990
His eyes see beyond the present,
the dream of his homeland free

1271
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:49,210
You can kill a man but not his dream!

1272
02:20:55,250 --> 02:20:57,550
ATTACK!

1273
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:22,910
ATTACK!

1274
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:08,790
And so began the bloodiest
rebellion in human history

1275
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:12,630
The British called it a Sepoy Mutiny

1276
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:17,460
But for the Indians it was the
first war of independence

1277
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:23,130
An officer by the name
Captain William Gordon,

1278
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:25,140
was recorded as having
joined the rebel forces...

1279
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:26,980
and fought against the Company Raj

1280
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:30,810
The rebellion was finally
put down after a year...

1281
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:33,990
but it destroyed the East India Company

1282
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:40,320
And the British Crown took over
the governance of India

1283
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:45,830
Mangal Pandey in his death
became a hero, a legend...

1284
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:53,670
who inspired a nation to
fight for freedom

1285
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:15,350
The dream of freedom ignited by
Mangal finally came true 90 years later...

1286
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:21,900
on 15th August 1947,
when India became free.
