00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,799
“Wake up! Listen."
- Bhaiyya.. Bhaiyya!

19
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,597
Bhaiyya! Open the door.

20
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,895
Brother!

21
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,643
What are you doing in there?
Bhaiyya! Open the door!!

22
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,779
Open the door!!

23
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,488
Chottu!
Why didn't you wake me up sooner?!

24
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,864
You said you were
going to study all night..

25
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,529
...I thought you'd be up by now.

26
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,531
Did you fall asleep?

27
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:01,006
You fell asleep! You had 4 cups of
coffee and you still fell asleep!

28
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,466
What will you do now?

29
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,594
How will you give your exam now?!
Just try not to fail, I guess..

30
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,506
Shut up! This is all your fault!

31
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,009
Now you sit here
and eat this breakfast! I'm off..

32
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,012
Move.
- Best of luck!

33
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,566
The same bloody
situation again, Sid..

34
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,411
...you should've at least studied
for this one last exam..

35
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,910
Ten questions out of thirty?

36
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,577
That's not so bad..
you'll probably pass..

37
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:44,584
Or, maybe you won't..
What are you going to do, Sid?

38
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,673
You're never going to do anything,
Sidharth Mehra.

39
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,423
You'll definitely fail in this exam.

40
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,973
Because that's what happens..

41
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,474
...when you don't attend
a single lecture the whole year.

42
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,640
This is just what you deserve!

43
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,642
But what do you have
to worry about, Sid?

44
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,651
Who cares if you fail?
Your father will still be loaded..

45
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:07,110
...and you'll still have the best car
in this college! Right!

46
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,233
Shut up!
- Relax.

47
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,778
Don't listen to these losers,
Sid.. don't worry.

48
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,913
I'm your friend, and I know
that you're going to pass..

49
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,531
...like you always do!

50
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,161
By the way,
where were you last night?

51
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,416
I kept calling..
why didn't you answer?

52
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,206
Did you read the notes I gave you?

53
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,502
Oh shut up Laxmi.. Can't you
at least let him dream in peace?

54
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,088
Sid! I'm in the
same situation as you.

55
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,257
I couldn't study last night either.

56
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,557
I was with Neha, dude..

57
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:44,193
She was studying economics and
I was studying her. All night long!

58
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,941
Anyway don't worry brother..

59
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,446
If we fail, we'll fail together.

60
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,528
We've been together
since kindergarten.

61
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,818
What's one more year, right?
Don't worry, pal.

62
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,420
Everyone, pens down! Stop writing.

63
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,132
Make sure your exam roll numbers
are entered correctly.

64
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,839
Come on, stop writing.

65
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,884
Guys farewell party! Tomorrow night!
Do come, Ok?

66
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,268
You can do this dance there!

67
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,766
Farewell party tomorrow night!
Do come!

68
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,976
There's going to be food,
dance everything!

69
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,312
Farewell party! Tomorrow night!
Do come, Ok?

70
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,194
Students hostel.. Tomorrow night..
Farewell party..

71
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,479
Please arrive..

72
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,778
Hey Nisha. Stop there!

73
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,663
What the hell is Debbie's problem?

74
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,498
I don't want to go
to her farewell party.

75
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,658
It'll be bloody boring anyway..

76
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,078
Shut up Sid! We have to go!

77
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,583
We might never see these
people again. This is it.

78
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,629
College is over.
- Where did the last 5 years go?

79
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,598
Life is going to change now..
there's so much to do!

80
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,842
You're right, there's a lot to do!

81
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:03,059
Now that the exams are over,
I can finally start my diet!

82
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,280
From tomorrow.. I swear!

83
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,317
You don't have to diet.
I'll marry you!

84
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,860
Please, don't be silly..

85
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,324
0k, can we go now?
- Yeah let's go.

86
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,454
Come Rishi.

87
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,960
What is this?

88
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,417
Sid! Give it back! Sid!

89
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,252
What the hell is this?!

90
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,932
He bought it for Neha. I think
her name's engraved in there too..

91
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,930
Give it back Sid.

92
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,057
Rish, you gotta be kidding me..

93
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,346
Sid, I love her!

94
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,808
Dude, you're pathetic!
- Don't be an idiot.

95
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,770
Rish.. are you actually
going to propose to Neha?!

96
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,948
Put that ring away!
Have you gone mad?

97
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,529
Why are you being so serious?

98
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,616
You know, everyone has
to get serious after college..

99
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,909
...you'll have to do it too.

100
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,950
Right, which is why
I've made a really serious plan.

101
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,914
What? - Tell me.
- Lets go and get drunk!

102
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,962
Sid! Be serious!
- Be serious.

103
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,123
Yeah but I don't want to be
serious right now!

104
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:15,135
We've finished our exams today..
who cares about tomorrow..

105
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:20,638
...as long as we can have some fun..
tonight? Come on!

106
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,977
Let's go!

107
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:31,444
Let's go!
- "What to do, my heart is singing?"

108
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,775
“What to do,
my life is intoxicating?"

109
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:41,411
"What to do,
slowly I am getting intoxicated?"

110
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:46,618
"What to do, I am getting
a little effected by it?"

111
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,857
"What to do, my slept
desires have awakened."

112
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,939
"What to do, my life
is lost in the way?"

113
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,484
"What to do,
I have new dreams in my eyes?"

114
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,331
"What to do, I am getting
a little effected by it?"

115
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,086
"What to do?"

116
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,749
"These days and nights."

117
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,788
"All these talks.“

118
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:18,421
"Fragrant."

119
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,384
"Intoxicated."

120
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:30,104
"Let this time stand still
and I stay the same way I am."

121
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,777
"What to do, my heart is singing?"

122
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,904
“What to do,
my life is intoxicating?"

123
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,822
"What to do,
slowly I am getting intoxicated?"

124
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:53,290
"What to do, I am getting
a little effected by it?"

125
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,918
"What to do?"

126
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,444
"What to do?"

127
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,419
Is that Rishi, no?

128
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,039
Maa! Why don't you knock...?

129
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,047
You are being my son.. Why knocking?

130
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,887
What do you want, ma?

131
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:32,350
I came to meet you..
So much time not seeing you..

132
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,144
Ma please stop speaking in English..

133
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,600
You don't know how to..

134
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,394
How your exam Siddy?

135
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,025
It was Ok..

136
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,067
I'm so proud of you..
You're a graduate now.

137
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,036
Now you must learn
some organization Siddy..

138
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:01,797
What mess.. Why do you keep
ordering pizza all the time?

139
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,212
I make such good food at home.

140
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,846
And stop playing videogames all day.

141
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,808
You have way too many clothes!

142
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,641
Throw them all away now.

143
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,936
These tiny-tiny t-shirts
don't suit you any more.

144
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,483
You are the man now..
Not boy.. You are mature.

145
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,609
You should wear shirts..
you'll look handsome..

146
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,865
Maa, I always look handsome!
Stop bugging me!

147
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,283
And don't touch my things!
I've told you this before!

148
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:51,134
Ma.. Here, you can fold it.

149
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,550
And don't feel bad now..

150
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,015
Will you eat dinner with us?
I made it myself..

151
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,646
Eating?
- Yes Ma.

152
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,523
What a car man!

153
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,116
Sid, you should join the office.

154
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,787
Whoa! Where did
the office come from?

155
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,088
Your college is over, right?

156
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,176
And you don't have classes
to skip any more...? - No..

157
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,257
Then you're joining the office.

158
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,012
But pa.. what am I
going to do there?

159
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,553
Work, what else?

160
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,432
But pa! Office?!

161
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,274
I mean.. our company manufactures
bathroom furnishings!

162
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,989
'Flower Showers' for heaven's sake..

163
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,826
It's just.. it's just not my thing!

164
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,778
Just not your thing?

165
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,239
Do you know that 'Bathroom Fittings
and Furnishings Association'

166
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,408
Rated those same 'shower heads'
number 1 last year?!

167
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,337
Everyone from millionaires
to mailmen are buying our showers!

168
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,955
Do you know what that means?

169
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,047
Our company has taught India
how to shower in style!

170
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,764
No!
' No!

171
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,473
No way! I'm not joining the office!
- Ok then Sid!

172
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,103
Actually, I was thinking that..

173
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,389
...this car would look really good
in our garage.

174
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,104
You're not serious? Are you?!

175
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,148
Just work at the office for 6 months.

176
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,612
The car is yours..

177
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,320
6 months?! That's too long, pa..
15 days..

178
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,827
Do I look like an idiot?
At least 90 days..

179
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,747
No pa.. twenty days..

180
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,206
Minimum 60 days..

181
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,916
No more than 30 days.

182
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,211
Thirty days?

183
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,084
Ok done!
You can start work tomorrow.

184
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,222
Wake up.
- Tomorrow?! Yeah ok..

185
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,053
"Wake up."

186
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,647
Pa.. What kind of a deal is this?
A Porsche for a month's work?

187
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,606
My son is joining my office.
That's the biggest deal!

188
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,815
"Wake up, Sid. Wake up."

189
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,832
Sid.. - Sorry ma, I have to go.
My friends are here.

190
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,917
Eat something before you 90..

191
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,123
Mother I will be going
to office from tomorrow.

192
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,332
Last night of freedom..

193
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,621
Bye! Love you.

194
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,129
Friends Hello! DJ cut the music!

195
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,716
Laila.. got any plans after college?

196
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,806
I'm going
for the Miss India contest!

197
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,470
I've been training for a year now..

198
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,938
Dieting, workouts..
Hey, you wanna feel my abs?

199
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,436
Have you seen Taare Zameen Par?

200
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,730
You know, my life is
exactly like that film..

201
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,741
I don't want to be
a journalist any more.

202
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,157
I can't handle
this tabloid culture..

203
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,203
Rishi! This party is so tacky!
I wanna go home!

204
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:10,917
Baby! Not everything can be as
perfect as you, can it? Lemon tart?

205
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,503
I wanna go home,
Rishi. I'm leaving. Bye.

206
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,338
But what about the lemon tart...?

207
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,845
Do you love lemon tart
more than me? I'm going home!

208
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,254
Listen, please. I love you.

209
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,551
Hi everyone.
This song goes up to Aarti.

210
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,223
Aarti, I love you.

211
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:56,299
Stop! Please don't!
I hate being photographed..

212
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,130
Why?

213
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,259
Because..
Because I don't look good in them.

214
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,100
Not at all,
I think you'll look nice.

215
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,516
Some other time, Ok?

216
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,690
' 0 You re not from my
college are you , .

217
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,734
Nope..

218
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,150
Thought as much.. you look
a little older than this crowd.

219
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,236
Thanks! Only a little I hope.

220
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,453
So what are you doing at this party?

221
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,044
I came along with some girls
from the hostel..

222
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,961
This girl Debbie,
she's one of the organizers and..

223
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,752
Wait a minute..
You came here with Debbie!? - Yeah

224
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,550
Oh God,
if she sees you with me, she's..

225
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,474
What's WRONG with you?

226
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,764
With me?
She's the one with the problem.

227
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,151
That freak! Anyway, you're lucky,
my company is way better than hers.

228
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,562
Is that so?
- Yeah, seriously.

229
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,864
0k.. let's find out.

230
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,783
So what do you do?

231
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,870
Me? Er.. I spend my dad's money.

232
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,493
Nice. And what do plan
on doing after college? - Hey, Sid.

233
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,375
I plan on continuing
to spend my dad's money.

234
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,877
Sit.

235
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,757
What's up?

236
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,420
What about you? What do you do?

237
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,720
I'm new to Bombay.
Here to earn my own money.

238
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,681
Oh? So you're not from Bombay?
- Uh-huh..

239
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,559
Do you like it here?

240
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,852
Actually I haven't seen much yet.

241
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,194
I got off the train and went
to the hostel, and now I'm here.

242
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,903
Wait a minute..
You got here TODAY!?

243
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,576
Yeah.. - And out of all the places
you could have gone to,

244
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,908
You chose THIS boring party?

245
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,368
Why?

246
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,955
It was too late to
go anywhere else..

247
00:20:55,963 --> 00:21:00,002
Listen, this is Bombay..
It's never late here..

248
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,221
And you know what?
The city is at its best at night.

249
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,882
Less traffic, less heat..

250
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,722
Really, you should have
been out there right now..

251
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,600
So let's go for a walk!

252
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,228
Walk?
- Yeah..

253
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,230
When?
- Now..

254
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,654
Ok.

255
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,900
Ok? - Sure.. Ok, Let's go..

256
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:33,874
One second, hold on.. I don't want
to give you the wrong idea..

257
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,868
But it was your idea..

258
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,379
I know,
but I don't even know you and..

259
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,754
Well, I don't know you either..

260
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,009
Yeah but listen, it's not
like I want to sleep with you!

261
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,173
Whoa! Did I say that
I wanted to sleep with you?!

262
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,841
It didn't even cross my mind..

263
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,969
Oh come on, be honest.

264
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,477
You met a girl at a party..

265
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:56,809
...and you're leaving
with her in 5 minutes.

266
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,347
Of course it crossed your mind!

267
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,688
Ok, it might have..

268
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,112
But if you have a problem with that,
it won't again.

269
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,318
It's all good.

270
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,697
Really? Ok let's go
for that walk then.

271
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,861
Ok.

272
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,243
Wait a second.. What's your name?
I'm Sidharth..

273
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,329
I'm Aisha! Hi!

274
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,634
No one.

275
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,925
Really?
You don't have any friends here?

276
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,431
Family?

277
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,932
Nope. -Then you must have a job..

278
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,517
Not yet!

279
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,513
You ran away from home, didn't you?

280
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,646
Really Aisha..
why have you come to Bombay?

281
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,352
To meet you..

282
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,646
Come on, tell me seriously.

283
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,775
Seriously, to become independent.

284
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,747
I'm from Calcutta, Sidharth.
I've lived there all my life.

285
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,452
I wanted to give my life
a new direction, so I came here.

286
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,421
To try something new..

287
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,506
Like a holiday?

288
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:11,304
No Sidharth...! Not like
a holiday.. like.. life!

289
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,057
Do you know the feeling
when you cook your own food..

290
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:19,646
...have your own house,
make your own money, and spend..

291
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,182
...live a life you've
made for yourself?

292
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,689
Independence! Know what I mean?

293
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,570
No..

294
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,239
Forget it.

295
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,992
But what are you going to do here?

296
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,996
I'll work, what else?
Do you know this magazine?

297
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,002
Mumbai Beat. Of course!
It has great photographs!

298
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,253
And good articles too.

299
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,545
I'm going to their office tomorrow,
for an interview.

300
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,387
Aah.. Of course!
That diary at the party..

301
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,093
You're a writer, aren't you?

302
00:23:55,935 --> 00:24:00,850
Well, not professionally.
But soon, I hope..

303
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,227
So Sidharth,
tell me something about Bombay.

304
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,729
What would you like to know?

305
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,195
Okay, If there was one
place in Bombay you..

306
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:17,202
...could show me tonight,
what would that be?

307
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,125
The sea has always been really
special for Bombay, hasn't it?

308
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,719
I guess I can see why..

309
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,636
...In a city where anything
and everything can change,..

310
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,013
...the sea is a constant.

311
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,184
It'll always be here.
It's beautiful.

312
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,819
Actually Aisha, you should
see the sea when it rains.

313
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,651
The Bombay monsoons are to die for!

314
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,277
People might complain about
the traffic and the flooding..

315
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,657
But, I just love the monsoon.

316
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,583
When it rains,
the sea looks amazing!

317
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,831
I can stare at it for hours..
It's really awesome.

318
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,253
Wow.. I'm going to remember that..

319
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,433
Can I ask you something, Aisha?

320
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,640
How can you still
have more questions?

321
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,392
Ask..

322
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,059
You're all alone here,
aren't you scared?

323
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:34,398
Are you kidding Sidharth?
I'm terrified!

324
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,741
I've never lived alone before.

325
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,409
But you know what..
I'll get over it.

326
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,288
Coming to Bombay was a dream.

327
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,915
And now that it's
actually coming true..

328
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,375
...I can't let fear stand in my way.

329
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:55,464
There's so much to do that
I won't have time to be afraid!

330
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:01,846
Well.. I think you're really tough,
Aisha.. really.

331
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,061
I can't even imagine doing
what you're doing.

332
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,974
So, I guess, cheers to your dream!

333
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,606
Cheers.

334
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,610
My father made a fortune..

335
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,404
...manufacturing bathroom
furnishings here..

336
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:27,325
It's quite an impressive story,
but 'flower showers'!

337
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,163
I mean isn't that ridiculous?

338
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,957
Well this is me..
Single Women's Hostel!

339
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,551
So, when can I call you?

340
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,138
Actually, I don't have a phone yet.

341
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,183
Sidharth, I don't wanna
keep saying this but..

342
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,890
I really don't want to give you
the wrong idea..

343
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,895
God, I get it!
I have the same idea as you.

344
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,893
That we should be.. friends.

345
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,531
Friends is great..
Why don't you give me your email ID?

346
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,323
Pen?
- Right there..

347
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,907
Sidharth..

348
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,989
You're my first friend in Bombay.

349
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,835
Sid.. friends call me Sid.

350
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,247
Thanks for tonight, Sid..

351
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,398
What are you doing in there?

352
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,528
Sir got tired of waiting for you
and left already..

353
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,148
Stop bugging me, Chottu!
I just need 5 more minutes, Ok?

354
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,774
Yes? How can I help you?

355
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,487
Mr. Ram Mehra...?

356
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,570
Sir is out. And you are...?

357
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,786
I'm his son.. Sid.. Sidharth..

358
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,952
Oh?! Sorry! I'm really very sorry!

359
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,921
How nice to see you
in the office Mr. Mehra!

360
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,461
Er.. call me Sid?

361
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,377
0k, Mr. Mehra. Please come.

362
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,762
You're so whipped, dude!

363
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,766
She's your girlfriend,
not your boss! Be a man!

364
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,605
Yes.

365
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,022
Oh hi pa!
Rishi I'll have to call you back..

366
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,656
Okay, bye.

367
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,577
Can we start work now, Sid?

368
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,488
Of course, that's why I'm here..

369
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,247
0k then Sid! This is going to be
your last pizza in my cabin.

370
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,960
In fact, you won't even be allowed
in here without my permission.

371
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,339
This is not our house Sidharth.

372
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,628
This is my office. And we have
rules here. Is that clear?

373
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:30,300
"Wake up!" - You will work outside,
with rest of my staff. - "Wake up!"

374
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,853
And because you know nothing
about Mehra Furnishings.

375
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,522
You'll have to read
company's literature.

376
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,274
You will have to read up
on the company's background..

377
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,437
...our locations, our turnover,
our clients.. everything.

378
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,571
Okay? Good.

379
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,070
By next Tuesday, you have
to pick a department to work for.

380
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,738
This might all seem a
little dull to you at first,

381
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,829
...but eventually,
it'll get interesting.

382
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:01,836
Lastly, you are not my spoilt son
in here Sid,

383
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,967
...but a young boy
with a chance to understand..

384
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,379
...the workings of
a very big company.

385
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,672
Consider yourself lucky.

386
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,374
Hello 'my first Bombay friend'.
How are you?

387
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,499
I was thinking about you today..
so, here I am!

388
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,834
Anyhow, the news is.

389
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,505
I went in to the magazine office
for my first interview today..

390
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,383
...and Sid.. it was amazing!

391
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,765
Some places have such character..

392
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,474
...that you immediately
identify with them.

393
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,473
Do you know that feeling?

394
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,143
I had a meeting
with the Creative Director.

395
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,981
It went off quite well actually.

396
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,564
Amit is also
Head Photographer there.

397
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,367
Didn't you say that you liked
the photographs in this magazine?

398
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,991
If I get this job,
you should come visit sometime.

399
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:21,787
My final interview is in a few days.
Keeping my fingers crossed!

400
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,414
That's it for now. Aisha.

401
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,221
Hello 'new girl in the city'.

402
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,131
Good to know that
you had an interesting day,

403
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,427
Because I just had
the worst day of my life!

404
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,264
Dad's office is a prison!

405
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,898
The people around me come
to work at the same time..

406
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,067
...leave at the same time,

407
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,116
I think they even wear
the same clothes!

408
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,072
Don't they get bored?!

409
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,112
You're so lucky you're not stuck..

410
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,905
...with a thousand pages
of tax returns!

411
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,698
Later, Sid.

412
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:06,289
Dear Sid, I'm sorry that
you're not enjoying work

413
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,464
But I'm sure it'll get better..
Just keep at it.

414
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,294
Take me for instance.

415
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,135
Remember how scared I was
when I first came to Bombay?

416
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:21,141
I couldn't even take a walk
by myself! And now..

417
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,977
I've been all over the city, Sid!

418
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,231
Everywhere!

419
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,777
I wake up and walk out.

420
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,943
Without thinking about where
I'm going or what I'm doing..

421
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,529
...just aimlessly walking.

422
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,246
And the funny thing is that
I don't feel scared any more.

423
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:44,293
In fact, these days,
I feel like I'm finally Free!

424
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,958
And then.. last night..

425
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,845
Papa!

426
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,055
I can't live here any more!

427
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:09,735
It's time I found a place of my own.
Till then.

428
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,814
Aisha.

429
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,564
Ma..

430
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,530
Ma.. do you have a good
housing broker's number?

431
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,957
900888000.
That's the number for Prem Dubey

432
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,247
The best broker in Bombay.

433
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,496
Also, it's time you got a phone,

434
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,421
so I could invite you
to rocking parties! Ok bye!

435
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,803
Wake up.

436
00:33:54,658 --> 00:34:00,028
Sid. It's Tuesday. I'll see you
in my cabin in half an hour.

437
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,161
Get up!

438
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,048
Thank you <i>so</i> much
for Dube-ji's number Sid.

439
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,934
You're a saviour!
I'm going to look at flats today.

440
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,140
Wish me luck..

441
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,705
Make sure everything is
delivered by tomorrow.

442
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,039
Yes, sir.
- You can go.

443
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,203
Let's go, Sid..

444
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,878
He left, Sir..

445
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,476
Mrs. D'Monte.. - Yes?

446
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,361
I just wanted to see your flat.
Mr. Dubey told me..

447
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,319
So why the hell are you bothering me?

448
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,903
Didn't Dubey tell you that..

449
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,693
...they keys are with Sonia
on the fourth floor?!

450
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,579
That idiot. Take them from Sonia!

451
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,332
Where do these people come from..

452
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,204
Hi!

453
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,961
Hi? Sid? Sid! Oh my god!
What are you doing here?

454
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,676
Me? I'm.. staking you!

455
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,589
Shut up! You're kidding, right?

456
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,718
Yeah man. I called Dubey
and he told me you'd be here.

457
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,932
So I thought I'd come and help you.

458
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,186
Oh how sweet!

459
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:57,816
So this is where Dubey has sent you,
- Yes. - that idiot!

460
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,191
This building doesn't even
have a watchman, or a lift!

461
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,493
And this gate,
it belongs in a museum!

462
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,948
Aisha? Aisha!

463
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:21,502
Shit! Mrs. D'Monte never
told me Sonia's flat number.

464
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:28,305
God, I can't climb four
floors again!

465
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,971
You do it..

466
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,230
401. Sonia Gill stays in flat 401.

467
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,151
You've come to see the flat,
haven't you?

468
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,690
Just one minute.

469
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,165
Oh Sanju.. it's you..

470
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,925
Hi.. they've come to see the flat..

471
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,507
Aww.. have they now?

472
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,847
Sanju.. Sanju!
- Ok, bye.

473
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,810
Get in here!!
Stay away from that tramp!!

474
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,641
That old dried-up prune!!

475
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,771
Oh, so you're interested
in the flat, are you?

476
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:32,156
Actually, I am. Hi, I'm Aisha.

477
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,953
Sonia.

478
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,494
Anyway, I should warn you.
The flat's really dirty.

479
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,458
No one stayed here since a year.

480
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,794
Mrs. D'Monte can't climb
up the stairs..

481
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,005
...so there's been zero maintenance.

482
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,885
But, here, see for yourself.

483
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:48,964
Thanks.

484
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,819
Yuck..

485
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,870
Aisha.. it's like a haunted house
in here.

486
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,710
Let's go. This place is a 'dump'.

487
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,459
Sid.. you're going to think
that I'm crazy..

488
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:22,998
Why?

489
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,962
Because I actually like this flat..

490
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,751
What?! That's impossible!

491
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,387
I'm taking it, Sid..

492
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,302
But Aisha, it's filthy..

493
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,185
So we'll clean it..

494
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,640
You know, Chottu's room is
bigger than this.. I swear..

495
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,396
Well, good for Chottu!
I'm taking this flat.

496
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,861
But this is the first flat
we've seen. We could keep looking!

497
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,695
Of course we could,.. but we won't!
I've made up my mind!

498
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,823
You know what? You were right..

499
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,077
You really ARE crazy!

500
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,666
Where are you off to now?

501
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,371
To check out my building's terrace!

502
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,626
'MY' building?

503
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,753
Aisha wait..

504
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,046
What?

505
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,419
Are you really sure
you wanna live here?

506
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,553
If it's about money,
maybe I can help you..

507
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,300
I'll ask dad for some.

508
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,014
Sid, that's really sweet.
But no thanks! ok.

509
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,851
Aisha..

510
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:28,902
You're so stubborn! Listen,
I don't think this area's very safe.

511
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,659
Why don't I do some research
and send you an email?

512
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,913
Look, you're not
from here, you don't..

513
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,747
Whoa..

514
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,925
What a city!

515
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,466
Sid, do you really want to help me?

516
00:39:55,852 --> 00:40:00,312
Then help me turn this 'dump'
into a home.. Yeah?

517
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,357
Ok.
- Thanks.

518
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:32,128
"The colors of fun belong to me."

519
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:39,222
"The colors of friendship
belong to me."

520
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:52,732
"The colors of fun belong to me."

521
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:59,322
"The colors of friendship
belong to me."

522
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:06,996
"The color of happiness is
hidden in these colors."

523
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:14,128
"See to that they don't fade.
These are the colors of life."

524
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:20,017
“Life is crazy.
These colors are beautiful."

525
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:26,440
“Life is crazy.
There's a new desire."

526
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:33,564
"Life is crazy. Sing along with me.“

527
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:46,998
"Some moments filled with colors."

528
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:54,469
"Some moments filled with colors."

529
00:41:54,804 --> 00:42:01,050
"Sometimes there's silence
all around."

530
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:09,605
"Sometimes there's intoxication."

531
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,989
Your credit card statement..

532
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,984
It's been taken care of.

533
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:30,462
"Painted so many colors
day and night.“

534
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:37,219
"Like somebody tells us something."

535
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:44,685
"Everyone belongs to us
and are colors of light.“

536
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:51,726
“Look.. these are
the colors of life."

537
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:57,319
“Life is crazy.
These colors are beautiful."

538
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:04,243
“Life is crazy.
There's a new desire."

539
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:11,204
“Life is crazy.
Sing along with me.“

540
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:25,388
"Life is crazy."

541
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,898
"Life is crazy."

542
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,614
Happy Happy Anniversary
to you Sarita!

543
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,998
Thank you so much!

544
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,168
You look so gorgeous!

545
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,795
This is my wedding saree.

546
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,502
Sorry I'm late.
- Hello Sid.

547
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:02,630
Look at you! How handsome!
You should become a film star!!

548
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,640
Bye.

549
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,977
You are handsomest my son!

550
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,648
I'm also feeling that
you should become a film star.

551
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,851
You sit around doing
nothing anyway..

552
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,235
Ma! Stop it!

553
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,777
Congratulations..
On the anniversary.. Madam Mehra!

554
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:26,320
Thanks. - This is my Mrs.
and my daughter Tanya.

555
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,291
Ram, Tanya just got back
from the US.

556
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,040
She was getting a design degree
at Parson's University.

557
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,704
She's brilliant!

558
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:41,961
I told her to join my company,
but she says she is still thinking..

559
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,883
This generation, I tell you..

560
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,175
Wants to be independent..
right, Sidharth?

561
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:53,472
Sidharth?! Made any plans
for your future yet?

562
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,570
Excuse me.. Hello.

563
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:04,950
Aisha? What's up?
When did you get a phone?!

564
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:10,034
Busy man! So, Mehra,
your son's all grown up now, huh?

565
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,082
When is he taking
over your business?

566
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,709
Hello - Who knows?
He's also still thinking..

567
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:29,057
Hi. - Hey, thanks Aisha.. you keep
rescuing me from every boring party.

568
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,887
By the way, you were right.
The flat's looking really nice.

569
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:43,568
So Aisha..
It's the middle of the night..

570
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:49,198
You and me.. alone in your
apartment.. what's going on?

571
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,823
Sid.. I feel silly saying this,

572
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,541
but I just didn't want
to be alone tonight.

573
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:00,376
You see, tomorrow,
well in ten minutes actually..

574
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,923
It's my birthday! I've never been
alone on my birthday before..

575
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,842
Your birthday!?
Why didn't you tell me before?

576
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,007
We would have gone
out and really partied!

577
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,596
Well, this is kind of a party,
isn't it?

578
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,556
You, me and two cups of tea?

579
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,017
Yeah.. but something's
still missing.

580
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,810
What?

581
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,855
We still have ten minutes though,
don't we? - Yes.

582
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,231
0k then!

583
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,166
Sid, this is so stupid!
What are you doing?

584
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,703
Don't turn around, Aisha.

585
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,541
You better not be messing up
my kitchen! Ok

586
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:49,088
No no, it's very clean.
Spotless.. just give me ten seconds.

587
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,228
Aisha..

588
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,562
Happy Birthday Aisha!

589
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,852
Thank you Sid.

590
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,404
What for?

591
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,944
You've done so much for me.

592
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,160
If there's ever anything
I can do in return, just ask, ok?

593
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,287
Anything?

594
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,458
Ok, not 'anything'!
You're a good friend, Sid.

595
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,128
Can I ask you something, Aisha?

596
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,009
Ask away..

597
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,556
You and I.. we've become friends now,
which is great.

598
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,060
But if you think about it..

599
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,773
...we could've become
more than friends..

600
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,564
So, why do you think
that never happened?

601
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:34,450
Sid! It just didn't.
We're better off as friends, anyway

602
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,453
Besides, I didn't really think
I could..

603
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,661
Fall in love with someone like you..
That's why..

604
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,581
Why not? I mean, I'm kinda perfect.

605
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,542
No seriously Aisha..
what's wrong with me?

606
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,920
There's nothing wrong with you..

607
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,841
Sid, I don't want to talk about this.
You'll feel bad..

608
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,807
Why would I feel bad?
It's not as if I'm in love with you!

609
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,725
Come on, we can talk about this..

610
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,644
Qk!

611
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:11,571
I think.. you're still a kid.

612
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,326
A bit immature.. childish.

613
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,612
You're just not
what I'm looking for.

614
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:25,376
Ok, this is going to be fun!
What are you looking for, Aisha?

615
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:30,002
I guess someone who is..
Independent, for starters..

616
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:34,086
Someone with a career,
a goal in life.

617
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,012
Somebody I can relate to.

618
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,510
In short, a MAN.. not a boy!

619
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,851
Basically, the exact opposite of me!

620
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,235
Basically.. You're
the wrong profile for me, Sid.

621
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,119
Actually, you're right.
I'm too young for you.

622
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,948
You should go out
with someone your own age.

623
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,741
I knew you were going to feel bad!

624
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,876
By the way,
how old do you think I am?

625
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,454
Thirty.

626
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,296
Seriously?!
- Yeah..

627
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,632
I'm 27. And if you bug me any more,

628
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,042
I'm throwing you off this terrace..

629
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:20,010
Relax! I was just kidding!
Come now, make a birthday wish.

630
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,635
What birthday wish..
I just hope I get this job..

631
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,770
You're next.

632
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,565
Vidhi Nayak?

633
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,733
Aisha Bannerjee.

634
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:26,828
Aisha Bannerjee.. Right. You've
already had an interview here?

635
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,536
Then why wait 2 weeks
for the second one?

636
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,331
Uhh, you were busy, Sir..
That's why..

637
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,788
Oh yes of course.. I was busy.

638
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:40,212
But, you know.. Well, you should
know that I'm a very busy man.

639
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,763
My last assistant, Edna..

640
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,307
She was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

641
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,094
And then she had to go
and get brilliantly pregnant!

642
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,849
My bad luck, I suppose.
And your good luck!

643
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,895
So, Aisha Bannerjee..

644
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,109
...your application letter
seems interesting..

645
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,694
But your resume is pretty weak.

646
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,568
Two months at the Calcutta
State Library? That's it?

647
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:06,488
Yeah but I was also the editor for
my college newspaper for 2 years!

648
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,872
I'm talking about actual experience.

649
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,874
Serious work.. like we do here.

650
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,545
I am a workaholic. I'm extremely
hard to work for, Ms. Bannerjee.

651
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,001
Think you could keep up?

652
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,632
Absolutely..
I won't disappoint you, Sir.

653
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,043
I've come here all the way from
Calcutta only to become a writer..

654
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,836
I will learn much from you.

655
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,713
Writer?

656
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,134
Why did you apply for this job
if you wanted to become a writer?

657
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,975
An assistant's work
is very clerical.

658
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,560
Cleaning up my desk doesn't
require any creativity.

659
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:36,021
Besides, this is
a magazine about Bombay,

660
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,276
and you're not even from here..

661
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,029
But, you weren't from Bombay either
when you joined this magazine.

662
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,361
And now you're
the Chief Editor here.

663
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,776
I know everything about you.

664
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:49,614
I applied for this job
after a lot of deliberation.

665
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,957
In fact,
I've pictured myself giving you..

666
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,163
...this interview
a thousand times already.

667
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,078
I just didn't imagine that
I'd be this nervous..

668
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,041
...and you'd be this good looking..

669
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,465
Believe me.. I'll clean
your desk very creatively.

670
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,729
God knows,
it needs a good cleaning. So.

671
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,647
Sid! I've got it..

672
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,361
The new editor's assistant
at Mumbai Beat is Aisha Bannerjee!

673
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,274
I finally have a job!

674
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:30,197
Aisha.. that's great.. Super!

675
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:34,205
Can I call you in a bit?
I'm a little busy right now..

676
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,541
Okay. Bye.

677
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:50,092
What?! Stressed spelled
backwards is desserts.

678
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,010
I'm stressed!
And where were you guys?!

679
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,177
Never on time..

680
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,316
Baby, I passed I passed!
I got more than 40 in every subject!!

681
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,603
I thought I'd get like 35!
I'm so happy I passed!

682
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,396
Neha, that's like.. third class..

683
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,866
Whatever, at least I passed.
Come on hurry up you guys..

684
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:09,618
Excuse me..

685
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,124
Guys, excuse me. - Let me see
if I've passed or failed.

686
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,125
As per plan.. one by one.. OK?

687
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,335
You go first.

688
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,249
Sure? 0k..

689
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,635
Here.. here.

690
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,980
You're a genius Laxmi! You're
probably one of the toppers.

691
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,892
I don't know, man.
I could've done better in Economics..

692
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,108
Where's mine.

693
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,407
There..

694
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,114
Please God, let me
pass this one last time.

695
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:54,451
I'll walk barefoot to the temple
every week if you do. Please..

696
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:00,621
Hey Rishi.. you did it! You passed!

697
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,999
I passed Sid! - Congrats!
- I passed!

698
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,378
Sid, let's check yours now..

699
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,529
Maybe we're looking at
the wrong number, lets check again..

700
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,489
Show me your exam card..

701
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,490
Sid.. Sid.

702
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,331
Where have you been?

703
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:50,837
Baby you passed!
Aren't you proud of yourself?

704
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,550
I know baby.. But..

705
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,594
Sid!

706
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:03,642
Sid! Don't worry dude.
It's going to be alright.

707
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,810
Sid, listen.

708
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,654
These things happen, Sid..

709
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:14,945
It's just one year, Sid.
You'll pass next year..

710
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,867
It's not that big a deal!

711
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,996
Damn you, Rishi!

712
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,334
Don't tell me that its not
a big deal just because you passed!

713
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,712
I don't need a lecture from you.

714
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,669
Okay Sid, but relax Sid..

715
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,924
How can you tell me to relax?

716
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,130
I thought we were in this together.

717
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:37,350
Now you've gone and passed
and I've.. I'm alone here.

718
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:42,393
Yeah but.. why are you
taking this out on me?

719
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,478
Because it's all your fault!

720
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,439
You didn't deserve to pass either,
and you know it!

721
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,772
Maybe if I hadn't wasted my time
with you, I would have passed too.

722
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,565
Screw you Sid..

723
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,280
Yeah right, screw you too Rishi!

724
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,866
Stop fighting guys.. Sid
we could reevaluate the papers..

725
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,451
Laxmi please leave me alone.

726
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:19,012
Siddy.. me cooking tonight.
Are you eating at home?

727
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,514
What happen, Siddy?

728
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,147
Are you in a bad mood?
Do you need money?

729
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,733
What happened?

730
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:36,529
Maa.. My results are out.

731
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,965
Sid? You didn't passed?

732
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,467
How could you let this happen,
Sidharth?!

733
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,050
This is because you waste
all your time roaming..

734
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,811
...around with your friends!

735
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,810
You were such a good student
in school..

736
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,521
What happened in college?

737
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,857
We give you everything you want,
don't we?

738
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:18,697
Then why? Say something Sidharth..

739
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,696
Did I do something wrong..
you failed.

740
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,457
Shut up Ma! Stop this stupid
melodramatic lecture!

741
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,709
I know exactly what happened.

742
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,336
There's no need
to keep reminding me.

743
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,502
I'll pass next year.
Why are you panicking?

744
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,467
Why do you care so much anyway?

745
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,337
You didn't even go to school..

746
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,853
Say you're sorry, Sid..

747
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,311
I said apologize, Sidharth.

748
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,277
Please don't interfere in this, Dad.

749
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,315
Don't interfere?

750
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,733
And continue to ignore
what an ungrateful..

751
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,276
...spoilt brat you've become!

752
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,904
How dare you speak
to your mother like that!

753
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,449
Her life has revolved
around you every single day..

754
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,118
...of the last twenty years.

755
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,922
She couldn't go to school,
so she wanted you to do well.

756
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,381
So you could get everything
she couldn't have..

757
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,636
Wow! Another lecture..

758
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,007
Sid! Don't you dare walk out!

759
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,345
You are going to stand there
and listen to me tonight.

760
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:33,143
When I was your age
my father had died,

761
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:37,654
I was married,
and working day and night..

762
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:42,277
...trying to make enough money..

763
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,365
So that you can have everything
you have today.

764
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,371
This lifestyle.. this arrogance..

765
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,908
So what do you want from me?
Do you want me to be grateful?

766
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,328
You're damn right.
The least you can do is be grateful!

767
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,836
Thank you so much, Pa.
There, I said it.

768
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:54,997
Now can I go?

769
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,714
I am not done yet! You can't just
walk away from everything!

770
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,970
This is exactly why you failed.

771
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,256
Why you didn't last at the office
for more than a week!

772
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,720
You ran away
without informing anyone.

773
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,478
Oh God.. Not again..
your office.. your company..

774
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,810
Can't you see? I don't care
about your stupid office!

775
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,849
Then what do you
care about Sidharth?

776
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,269
What? You don't care
about yourself..

777
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,154
...about your family,
about your future..

778
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,658
You're wasting your life Sidharth.

779
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,569
Can't you see that today
you've failed your exams..

780
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,862
Tomorrow you're going
to fail at life?

781
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:29,532
No I can't see that!
And I don't want to see that!

782
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,825
I don't give a damn
about what you think!

783
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,246
You'll start caring
when I stop giving you money.

784
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,837
Do it then! I don't want
your bloody money anyway!

785
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:44,013
Ok, Sidharth.
Let me clarify one thing.

786
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,684
This is MY house,
and if you want to live in it,

787
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:55,392
...you'll have to live by my rules.
Ok?

788
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,187
I don't want to live in your damn
house then! I'm leaving.

789
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:35,561
"No one is with me today."

790
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,896
"I have to live up
to my little dream."

791
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,535
"This day has passed by."

792
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,332
"There's solitude around me again."

793
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,578
"Let's go from here."

794
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,974
Sid? What are you doing here?

795
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,689
Can I stay with you?

796
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,943
What? Sid?

797
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,072
Ok, why
don't come in first..

798
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,126
What's wrong, Sid?

799
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,652
Thank you Aisha..

800
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,022
Good night Sid..

801
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:07,167
Chottu! Chottu!

802
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,382
Shut these bloody curtains, Chottu!!

803
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,593
Chottu!!

804
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,039
Kabir overlooks all the writing..

805
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,291
I'm so sorry..

806
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:28,622
So whenever the articles come in..

807
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,840
Aisha! Where were you?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

808
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:40,475
Were you so busy?

809
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,520
I tried and tried and tried..

810
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,857
I got so bored today.

811
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:55,990
And you should really get an AC..
It's so hot in here!

812
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,113
Aisha, you're not
even listening to me!

813
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,292
Sid, I was working all day.
I'm really tired, ok?

814
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,997
0k.. let's go out for dinner then.

815
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,838
I don't want to go, Sid.
I ate at the office.

816
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,969
I just need to clean this up, and..

817
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,724
You ate already? Without me?

818
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:23,268
Yeah! You're not my husband!

819
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,559
Just cook something for yourself,
I'm going to bed.

820
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,357
You don't know how to cook, do you?

821
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,651
You can't cook anything?
Then what did you eat today?

822
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,488
Shit, Sid, you haven't
anything all day?!

823
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,248
Why didn't you just order something?

824
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,664
I didn't feel like it..

825
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:50,837
Hungry?

826
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,295
Yeah..

827
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,301
You're so silly, Sid!
Why didn't you tell me!

828
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,677
I'll make you something.

829
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,190
"This is strange story."

830
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:15,066
"Where it starts and where it ends."

831
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,700
"Which destination is this?"

832
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,623
Aisha, my coffee..

833
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:28,955
Yes, just a second.

834
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:37,168
Kabir.. I wrote this and
wanted your feedback..

835
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,133
If you get a moment..
- Aisha, can I please get my coffee?

836
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,153
Excuse me, sir.

837
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,695
Don't worry. This treat, I'll pay.

838
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,171
Sir, your card has been declined..

839
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,583
Are you sure?

840
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,717
Yes sir.

841
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,340
Would you like to pay cash?

842
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:25,966
Yes.

843
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,895
Actually..
- That's ok.. I'll get it..

844
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,646
Debbie, that's really sweet of you..

845
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,030
Thank you so much.
I'll pay you back..

846
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,565
Sidharth it's Ok.

847
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:46,237
Save the grateful speech for
another time. It doesn't suit you.

848
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:52,576
Anyway, I just got a job so I'm
treating all my friends to lunch.

849
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,713
Not exactly friends, are we?

850
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,378
No.. Not exactly..

851
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:07,091
I'm sorry that you failed,
Sidharth. Just wanted to say that.

852
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:12,434
Hey Debbie,
why do you hate me so much?

853
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,523
Three years ago, I came to Bombay
to join our college.

854
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,232
I had the right grades,
but I was late with my application.

855
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,027
I didn't get in that year.
You know why?

856
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,829
Because you took my seat, Sidharth.

857
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,535
Your father called a few people, and
you got the last seat in the batch.

858
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:43,544
I am smarter, I work harder,
and I'm more deserving than you.

859
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,391
But life has always been easier
for you, hasn't it?

860
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,053
Bye, Sid.

861
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,632
But Sid, you have to
go home some time!

862
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,964
He cancelled my credit card, Laxmi.

863
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,094
There's no way I'm going back now.

864
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,302
But he's just angry, Sid.
You need to understand..

865
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,012
You're the one
who doesn't understand, Laxmi!

866
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,222
You topped the whole damn college.

867
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,433
How can you know what
it feels like to have failed?

868
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,188
Just leave me alone!

869
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:42,524
Oh Shut up, Sid! I don't know
what it feels like to fail?!

870
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,940
Look at me.. I'm fat as a whale!

871
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,984
Do you ever try to understand
my feelings?

872
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,825
I keep trying to lose weight
but I fail every single day!

873
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,624
You're not the only one with
problems, so stop being a jerk!

874
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,924
Wipe that silly look off your face!

875
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:16,721
0k, fine.. I know I'm being a jerk!

876
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,389
It's just been tough, you know..

877
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,985
I know. That's why
I got this for you.

878
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,030
College application form.

879
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,701
And..

880
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,161
Some of your things.

881
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,080
I knew you wouldn't go back home.

882
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,415
Just thought I'd try..

883
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:49,925
Hey Laxmi.. I never knew, you know..

884
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,388
That your weight was
such an issue for you..

885
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,632
It's ok, Sid.

886
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,805
You know I don't think
you're a whale, right?

887
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,983
Maybe a buffalo!

888
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,158
Ma, no!

889
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:15,001
Encoded by CharmeLeon

890
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:01,833
"You are angry, but I know,
you'll be okay."

891
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,581
"You are very good from heart."

892
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,247
Perfect, Aunty... Uncle is so lucky!

893
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:12,507
"Life, you are just like me."

894
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,548
"You look smart, but naive."

895
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:23,518
"Why are you sitting far..

896
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:28,360
...forgetting everything?"

897
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:34,900
"Hold my finger."

898
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:39,325
"Walk with me..

899
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:44,451
...wherever I go."

900
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:49,956
"Walk with you..

901
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:55,420
...wherever I go."

902
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,473
Sonia?

903
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,013
Yes Sid?

904
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,345
Do you know how to make eggs?

905
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,238
And call Karan
and follow up with Amit.

906
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,119
Is that all? - Yeah,
just get rid of all this stuff.

907
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,623
Aisha, leave.

908
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:31,791
"Walk with me..

909
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,924
...wherever I go."

910
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:42,680
"Walk with you..

911
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:48,015
...wherever I go."

912
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:52,648
Hi.
- Hi.

913
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,028
You'll never believe this..

914
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,535
Why are so late today?
I was waiting!

915
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:06,120
I made an egg for you!
Sonia taught me.

916
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,784
You were right, she's so cool..

917
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:11,501
Shut up Sid! Look at this mess..

918
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:15,254
You made an egg. Wow!
Congratulations!

919
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,294
And who is going to do those dishes?!
Your servant?

920
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,714
Or did you forget,
you don't have a servant any more?!

921
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:26,227
This is my home Sid, and you have
turned it into a garbage dump!

922
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,765
But Aisha.. I made you an egg..

923
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,565
...wake up!"

924
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,571
...wake up!"

925
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,577
...wake up!"

926
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,523
Sid.. I think
you should go back home.

927
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:27,609
Your dad has such
a successful company..

928
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:31,496
And you are sitting
in my house making eggs!

929
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,573
What are you doing Sid?

930
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:41,548
You know.. You look at me
and you see my father's success..

931
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:47,220
But I'm not like him, Aisha..
I went to his office for a week..

932
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,928
But that place.. it just wasn't ME!

933
01:18:54,104 --> 01:19:01,477
But I'm beginning to realize
I'm nobody without him.

934
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:09,736
I don't have an identity!

935
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:17,993
Which is why I decided last night
that I want to work.

936
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,372
I know that I can't do anything.

937
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,627
I don't know who would hire me.

938
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,677
All I know is that I want to work.

939
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:35,059
Please don't kick me out right now.

940
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,643
Just give me one more chance.
Please.

941
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,229
M S k, 0

942
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,746
Aisha, where were you last night?

943
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:01,873
At Sonia's.

944
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:08,843
You mean.. across the hall? Damn!

945
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,674
Sid, about that job..
I've got an idea.

946
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,565
Have you done any kind
of photography course?

947
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,268
No..

948
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,230
Any kind of work experience
with photography?

949
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:29,988
No..

950
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,867
Any kind of work experience at all?

951
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,952
Amit, Sid's been taking photographs
for many years now.

952
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,038
Even as an intern,
he could learn a lot from you.

953
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,669
I truly think this is something
he'll be good at.

954
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:51,086
0k Sidharth.. Let's try you out
as an intern for a few days..

955
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:57,717
Thanks Amit.
- See you at 10 tomorrow.

956
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:02,688
But tomorrow is Sunday!
I mean, yeah..

957
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:04,182
Cool.

958
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,360
I am going to be working
at Mumbai Beat.

959
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:13,571
How totally neat!
Hey, that rhymed. Oh what heat!

960
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,287
We live together,
now we're going to work together.

961
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:21,120
Should we just get married?!
- Yeah, let's go! Come on!

962
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,408
Go home, you idiot!

963
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,252
4th Road Juhu Scheme please.
- Bye.

964
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,461
Sid!

965
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:33,381
See you at home honey!

966
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,476
Stop here.

967
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,862
Why did you bring me here? I said..

968
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:55,825
sol"'Y

969
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,780
Turn around.
We'll go to Chapel road.

970
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:04,246
One second.
Wait here, I'll be right back.

971
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,853
Really..

972
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:32,945
He listened
to the conversation between..

973
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:38,989
The Chief of guard
and the king with great attention.

974
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:46,121
Why? What did the poor fellow do?
The King inquired.

975
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:54,376
Hello everybody,
welcome to Mumbai Beat! - Thank you.

976
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:59,305
The theme of our next issue
is Bazaars of Mumbai.

977
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:03,430
I'm sure you guys
know all about them..

978
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,719
Sir..
- And..

979
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:09,436
The idea is that there will be two
interns for every three articles,

980
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:13,023
except for the cover story.
So let's get down to work..

981
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,403
You're Ram Mehra's son, right?

982
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:20,159
We met at your parents'
anniversary party, remember?

983
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,987
Oh yeah.. Hi.

984
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,247
So, I'm guessing you didn't
join your dad's company then..

985
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,837
Tanya Lathia? Design in turn.

986
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,044
That's me. - Sid Mehra?

987
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:42,215
You two are going to assist me
on the cover story photo spread.

988
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,848
And you are?
- Rasha.

989
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,010
Rasha.. you are also design in turn.

990
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,395
What do you want to do?
What you want to design?

991
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,562
Sid?! Hold on, I'm coming..

992
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,437
Yes?

993
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,651
Aisha?

994
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,905
Yes.

995
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,192
I'm Sidharth's mother.

996
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,496
Oh.. Hello auntie

997
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,831
Can I come in?

998
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,867
Of course, please come in.

999
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:29,599
Actually.. Sid isn't here..

1000
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:35,272
I know. I had asked Chottu
to call me once he left.

1001
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:40,565
I just wanted to see
where Sid was living these days.

1002
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,865
Now that he's staying with you..

1003
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,326
I thought you might need
some money..

1004
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:51,458
No auntie, please..
I can't take money from you..

1005
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,035
Thank you.

1006
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,008
I brought some mangoes too..
they're Sidharth's favourite..

1007
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:00,759
At least keep those.

1008
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,178
Ok.

1009
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,013
Chottu!

1010
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,882
Yes, put it here.

1011
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,395
Just don't tell him I got them.
He won't like it.

1012
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,775
0k Aisha, I will take your leave.

1013
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,901
Ok aunty.

1014
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,819
Auntie..

1015
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,740
I just wanted to say..

1016
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,824
I mean, I hope
you don't get the wrong idea..

1017
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:33,626
Actually, Sid and I,
there's nothing going on between us..

1018
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,664
We're.. we're just friends,
you know..

1019
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:13,624
"Life, these days.."

1020
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:20,669
"..is telling me."

1021
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:28,715
“lf you listen to me,
come with me to the lane of dreams."

1022
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:35,601
"Take all the fragrances
and brightness in your arms."

1023
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:39,684
"Wherever you are..

1024
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,483
...the days and nights are new."

1025
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,445
"New desires..

1026
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,528
...and new emotions."

1027
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:57,244
"There are new ways for you,
why don't you go and explore?"

1028
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:03,299
"There's new earth
and new sky for you."

1029
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:10,757
"Write a new story on the winds."

1030
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:17,559
"There's new earth
and new sky for you."

1031
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:24,187
"Write a new story on the winds."

1032
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:56,678
"When life knocked,
heart opened all the windows."

1033
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,347
"Heart opened all the windows."

1034
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:10,742
"The solitude on the lips
has melted."

1035
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,324
"Has melted."

1036
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,752
"These moments have surprised me.“

1037
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:28,627
"So many talks have
touched my heart."

1038
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:37,135
"Many desires have awakened
in my heart."

1039
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:44,480
"Many desires have come to tell me.“

1040
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:50,819
"Recognize the smile
and fill your heart with happiness."

1041
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:57,158
"There's new earth
and new sky for you."

1042
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:04,162
"Write a new story on the winds."

1043
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:10,634
"There's new earth
and new sky for you."

1044
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:18,476
"Write a new story on the winds."

1045
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,046
Thank God we have tomorrow off.
I really need a break.

1046
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:50,166
Let's go out to dinner tonight.

1047
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:54,086
I can't tonight..
I already made plans.

1048
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,676
Really? What plans?

1049
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,763
You know Tanya?
I'm going out with her.

1050
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:05,306
Tanya? That design intern?
She's pretty, haan?

1051
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:08,609
Yeah she's pretty.. and fun too.

1052
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:11,937
We're going clubbing..
Why don't you join us?

1053
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,856
It'll be fun!
- No, you go.

1054
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,445
I don't want to go clubbing.

1055
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:20,450
But you'll get bored,
all alone at home..

1056
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:21,909
I'll just cancel the whole thing.

1057
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,824
Don't be silly! You should go.

1058
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:26,039
Don't worry about me.
I've got a lot going on.

1059
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,293
Really!

1060
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:35,419
Up for a drink? I didn't have
anything going on, so..

1061
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,385
I'm always up for a drink darling!
Come.

1062
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:40,765
Hi.

1063
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,096
Hey, what's up?

1064
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,931
Sid, this is my best friend, Saira..

1065
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,722
Hello! I've heard a lot about you!
- Oh, you have?

1066
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:50,018
Tanya.. Vikram. Come here.

1067
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,778
Sid man!
- Bro. - Where have you been?

1068
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:54,062
Back in action now brother..

1069
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,526
You totally disappeared..
- Actually..

1070
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,816
Sid!! What are you doing here?

1071
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,407
Wow, he knows everyone here..
Anyway, have you met Rishi?

1072
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,409
Tanya!
- Hey.. - Hi.

1073
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,415
Yes.

1074
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:14,174
Hey Rish..
- Hi Sid. Do you want another drink?

1075
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:15,459
Yes please.

1076
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,423
I hated when I..

1077
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,224
What the hell are you watching?!
- Hey..

1078
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:29,640
Come, let's gossip..
How's your sex life?!

1079
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:31,774
What?!

1080
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:36,155
Oh don't be such a prude!
What about your boss?

1081
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:40,109
How's that going?
Do you still think he's sexy?

1082
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,242
Tell me.

1083
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:45,998
Yep, still sexy..
and he's my type too..

1084
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:47,282
Just jump him then!

1085
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,669
Sonia! He's my boss!
And I don't even know him..

1086
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:52,709
And Sid?

1087
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:54,294
What about him?

1088
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,585
You know him, don't you?
At least hook up with him!

1089
01:31:57,637 --> 01:32:01,505
Please Sonia! We're just friends.
Plus, he's a kid!

1090
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,094
Oh what a cute kid!
I think he's quite sexy..

1091
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:09,350
You know,
like those boy band singers..

1092
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,398
Sid? And sexy?

1093
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,729
Yes.

1094
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:13,938
Of course!

1095
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,443
Please.. not Sid!

1096
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,649
Yeah!

1097
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:17,779
Oh God!

1098
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,900
Guys! Drinks?

1099
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:22,317
Vodka Red Bull!

1100
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,610
Oooooh!

1101
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,495
Weird! I'll get them!

1102
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:30,830
Sid!!!

1103
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:33,879
Two Vodka Red Bulls please.

1104
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,001
Laxmi?

1105
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:40,798
Sid?

1106
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:43,047
Where did Rishi go?

1107
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,516
Why do you wanna know?
As if you care..

1108
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:47,767
He left.

1109
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,721
Of course. For Neha's.

1110
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,640
No Sid! Why would he go there?

1111
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:54,607
Let it be.

1112
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:56,939
What?
- Nothing..

1113
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,149
Tell me.

1114
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,113
Neha and Rishi broke up.

1115
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,496
Nobody knows why or when..

1116
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,702
And that stupid Rishi
won't talk about it..

1117
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:14,037
Poor thing. He's really upset.

1118
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,500
You know how he is..

1119
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,134
Hey Rish..

1120
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:27,970
Why didn't you call me?

1121
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:34,765
Rishi! What happened with Neha?

1122
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,152
What happened man?!

1123
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:54,247
You gotta be kidding me..
And she said no?

1124
01:33:56,089 --> 01:34:00,925
Not only that..
She dumped me, man..

1125
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:14,930
I'm a bloody idiot!

1126
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,269
You're a bloody idiot!

1127
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,024
You told me this would happen!

1128
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,810
I told you this would happen!

1129
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:22,446
Then you should've been there
to remind me!

1130
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,956
Yeah man. I should've been there.

1131
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,247
Sorry.

1132
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,015
Sanju, have breakfast.

1133
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:00,183
Come on.

1134
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,822
Aisha! Good morning.

1135
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,077
Morning Sid.

1136
01:35:17,879 --> 01:35:21,088
Aisha? Why are we sitting
with the door open?

1137
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,924
Cross ventilation, Sid.

1138
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,926
There's no electricity in the flat.
It's really hot.

1139
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,765
Just a few more days..
and the rain will be here.

1140
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:35,560
You don't know how much
you're going to love it.

1141
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:44,193
Aisha?

1142
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:45,854
What Sid?!

1143
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:50,902
This dress really suits you.
You're looking nice today.

1144
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,325
Don't I look nice everyday?

1145
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:56,914
Nope.

1146
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:01,791
No seriously.. you look
a little extra nice today.

1147
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:04,213
Thanks Sid.

1148
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:11,505
Aisha.. Sidharth.. I made
my special Sunday breakfast today.

1149
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:12,718
Do you want some?

1150
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:15,384
Yes, Mrs. Bapat.
I'm always starving!

1151
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:21,895
Umm Sidharth.. will you take
Sanju's photographs today? Please?

1152
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:24,643
Of course, Mrs. Bapat.
Right after I polish off this food!

1153
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,315
Tell me if you want more.

1154
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:27,445
Sure.

1155
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,441
Here.

1156
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:33,364
Smile.

1157
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,413
Smile for me, Sanju!

1158
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:39,157
Can I go play now?

1159
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:43,295
Come, we'll play together.
Do you like cricket?

1160
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,381
Show me how you hit the ball!

1161
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:52,258
Yeah! Once again.
1.. 2.. 3! Superb.

1162
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,263
Thank you.

1163
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,556
You're welcome, sir.

1164
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,980
Sanju! Take one
with just me and him, Sidharth.

1165
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,736
Sure.
- Come.

1166
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,861
Sit here.

1167
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:15,026
Smile Sanju!

1168
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,205
What happened?

1169
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,411
Why do you have to be
so naughty, huh?

1170
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:26,580
He's taking such nice pictures.

1171
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:30,591
Always up to mischief,
my little brat.

1172
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:09,213
Hi ma.

1173
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:17,339
Thought dad would be
on his evening walk now..

1174
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:20,595
I'm going to leave
before he gets back.

1175
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,099
And I haven't come back to stay,

1176
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:28,562
So we're not going
to talk about that. Ok?

1177
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:36,574
I just.. wanted to see you.

1178
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:45,750
I miss you ma..

1179
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,800
Sid.. in shirt you looking
so handsome..

1180
01:38:55,388 --> 01:39:00,883
Ma, I always look handsome.

1181
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:05,428
That's true.

1182
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:19,944
Siddy, you're 4 years old here..
It was your first day of iscool.

1183
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:23,659
School Ma, not 'iscool', school.

1184
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,745
That's what I said.. lscool.

1185
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:29,661
I have no idea when you'll
stop trying to speak English.

1186
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:34,876
Why should I? Maybe if
I know English like your friends..

1187
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:37,760
...then we can become friends too.

1188
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:48,347
Look at this one.
You were so fat then!

1189
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:00,737
Ma, you look stunning here!

1190
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,282
These photographs are lovely..
who took them?

1191
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:08,374
Your Dad did, who else?

1192
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:12,336
Really?
I'm surprised he found the time.

1193
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:15,506
He always had time
to take your pictures.

1194
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:19,089
As soon as he got back from work,
you two would start.

1195
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,802
He'd take pictures,
and you would pose.

1196
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,304
I thought you'd become an actor!

1197
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:30,764
Really Sid, your father
has really captured..

1198
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:34,359
...your childhood in these albums.

1199
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:45,320
Ma.. I should go..

1200
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:57,090
Siddy, I hope
you're eating properly..

1201
01:40:57,593 --> 01:41:00,176
Yes Ma. We're fine, managing.

1202
01:41:02,181 --> 01:41:04,218
And there's always the
mangoes that you send.

1203
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:07,558
It was kinda obvious..

1204
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:17,101
Bye..

1205
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:38,165
I really want take a photograph
for the next issue.

1206
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:43,508
I know I'm just an intern, but I
want to prove that I can do better.

1207
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:52,391
'New Girl in the City'. Nice title.

1208
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:58,477
You read my articles?! All of them?

1209
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:02,397
I've decided that you're going to
write an article for the next issue.

1210
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:05,275
If I like it,
we'll make it a regular thing.

1211
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,448
Thank you!

1212
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:09,112
Your writing is fresh.

1213
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:10,405
Really.

1214
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,621
Thanks! Thank you!

1215
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:18,830
Aisha..
- Yes.

1216
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:24,006
I'm going to a jazz bar
with a couple of my friends tonight.

1217
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:25,466
There's going to be
a live performance.

1218
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:27,175
It's going to be a nice evening.

1219
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:28,806
Would to like to join me?

1220
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,264
Yeah sure.

1221
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:59,583
Unbelievable! Superb!

1222
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:00,838
Wonderful.

1223
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:04,338
What could be better than this,
Aisha?

1224
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:11,720
You haven't heard much jazz,
have you?

1225
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,385
No.. not really..

1226
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:16,888
What kind of music do you like?

1227
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:22,940
Umm, I don't know..
Old Hindi Film songs.

1228
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:26,898
At least they're
easy to sing along to.

1229
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:32,404
You like Film music
because it's easy?

1230
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:34,622
Yeah..

1231
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,325
Interesting.

1232
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:38,952
What?

1233
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,084
What?

1234
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,169
You know, there's maturity
in your writing..

1235
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:51,180
But you're still a little childish.

1236
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:56,977
Anyway, stick around with me
and you'll learn what real music is.

1237
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:13,699
Aisha! Hi!

1238
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:17,582
Tanya? Hi. What are you doing here?

1239
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,742
I came to drop off some books.

1240
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,331
Thought Sid might need them
for his new assignment.

1241
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,666
He's so excited!

1242
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:23,830
What new assignment?

1243
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:25,294
You don't know?

1244
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:28,880
Amit asked him to take a few
photographs for the next issue.

1245
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,169
Isn't that cool?

1246
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:31,759
Yeah, it's cool.

1247
01:44:31,807 --> 01:44:33,673
Anyhow, gotta run now. Bye!

1248
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:34,807
Bye.

1249
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:38,853
By the way Aisha,
your place is so cute!

1250
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:42,056
Thanks.

1251
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:57,280
Hey.

1252
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,573
Hi.

1253
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:08,420
I'm starving. I think
I'll cook something.. want some?

1254
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:11,670
I ate already. I made some pasta.

1255
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:13,883
There's some in the fridge for you.

1256
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:17,050
Oh God I hope you cleaned up
the kitchen!

1257
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:20,060
You always make such a mess
when you cook..

1258
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:29,187
You know,
I'm actually not that hungry.

1259
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:32,490
I should change though..
It's so hot.

1260
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,282
I haven't done laundry in days..

1261
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,076
I don't know what I'm going to wear.

1262
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:43,326
I washed your clothes
along with mine.

1263
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,585
They're in your cupboard.

1264
01:45:51,303 --> 01:45:53,920
Sid! You should have asked me
before washing my clothes!

1265
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:56,840
I sleep in this white kurta
and I never wash it!

1266
01:45:56,892 --> 01:46:00,851
Washing ruins it and besides..
I like it being dirty!

1267
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:03,396
Aisha what's wrong with you?

1268
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,983
Instead of thanking me for washing
your clothes, you're yelling at me?!

1269
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:10,770
Because I want to wash my own damn
clothes and cook my own damn food!

1270
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:13,155
This doesn't even feel
like my house any more!

1271
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,407
I don't like it
when you do my work or..

1272
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:18,410
...when you call strange girls
into my house!

1273
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:24,371
You have lost your mind! I think
the heat has gotten to your head!

1274
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,787
Of course it has!

1275
01:46:26,839 --> 01:46:29,251
So what can I do?
Make the heavens rain for you?

1276
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,541
Why not? Now that you're
so efficient at everything..

1277
01:46:31,594 --> 01:46:34,256
Lets see you do this too!
- Here's your rain!

1278
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,974
I can't believe you just did that!

1279
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:42,351
Aisha you'll ruin my iPod!!

1280
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:46,685
Shit sorry sorry.. Sid!!
Stop it, you idiot!

1281
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:48,982
Okay. Okay.

1282
01:47:05,044 --> 01:47:06,751
Aisha.. are you Ok?

1283
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:10,004
I'm sorry, I was just kidding..

1284
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:12,131
It's Ok.

1285
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:15,259
I am sorry, Aisha.

1286
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:39,241
You sure you're Ok?

1287
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,826
Yeah.

1288
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:42,695
0k then!

1289
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:47,246
Enough Sid! Don't behave like a kid.

1290
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:29,334
Sid.. if you keep helping me
like this, I'll get used to it.

1291
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:31,415
$0?

1292
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:36,291
So it's not right.
What will I do when you're gone?

1293
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,001
I'm not going anywhere.

1294
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:44,556
Come now. The food's getting cold..

1295
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:50,809
"O heart, you are crazy."

1296
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:56,144
"Only you know what you think?"

1297
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:02,533
"Only you know what you think?"

1298
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:08,323
"Why do you show me
dreams all the time?“

1299
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:12,952
"When dreams shower drop by drop."

1300
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:18,296
"Close your eyes."
- "Close your eyes."

1301
01:49:18,343 --> 01:49:21,586
"When dreams shower drop by drop."

1302
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,718
"Close your eyes."

1303
01:49:24,933 --> 01:49:30,554
"How can I walk?
I can't see unknown ways."

1304
01:49:30,606 --> 01:49:36,227
"Like the string instrument plays."

1305
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:39,520
"Like the string instrument plays."

1306
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:48,162
"Like the string instrument plays."

1307
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:54,161
"Like the string instrument plays."

1308
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:24,491
"I am listening
to a story completely lost."

1309
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:30,030
"Who knows it is full story or not.“

1310
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:36,628
"I didn't even realize
even after becoming someone's..

1311
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:41,587
...that it is for some moments
or life time."

1312
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:44,127
"Who knows."

1313
01:50:45,931 --> 01:50:49,094
"Who knows."

1314
01:50:52,813 --> 01:50:56,397
"When dreams shower drop by drop."

1315
01:50:56,441 --> 01:51:01,902
"Close your eyes."
- "Close your eyes."

1316
01:51:01,947 --> 01:51:08,193
"When dreams shower drop by drop."

1317
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:14,332
"How can I walk?
I can't see unknown ways."

1318
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:22,672
What's up?

1319
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:27,504
Sid.. I'm really worried
about my article..

1320
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,556
Why? I'm sure it'll be great.

1321
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:33,475
How do you know?

1322
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:36,266
I just know.

1323
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:44,233
"Like the string instrument plays."

1324
01:51:44,573 --> 01:51:47,531
"Like the string instrument plays."

1325
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:56,165
"Like the string instrument plays."

1326
01:51:56,585 --> 01:52:01,955
"Like the string instrument plays."

1327
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:17,303
Nice. Just proofread it
once before you submit it.

1328
01:52:17,356 --> 01:52:19,393
Thanks. Can I take off now?

1329
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:25,733
One second, Aisha. I have two tickets
for a jazz concert tonight.

1330
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:27,146
And you're coming with me.

1331
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:37,707
No Kabir. I can't come.

1332
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:47,008
You know, I thought if I spent time
with you, I'd start enjoying jazz..

1333
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:52,380
But, the truth is,
I just don't like jazz.

1334
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:55,099
I'm sorry but it's just not me.

1335
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:00,679
So.. I'll see you at work tomorrow?

1336
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:11,400
"This evening looks empty."

1337
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:17,034
Sid! I've selected one of your
photographs for the next issue.

1338
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:20,282
Thanks..
- Thank me later.

1339
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,292
Just get drunk for now. Ok.

1340
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:25,087
Have fun! You're doing well.

1341
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:31,002
"I find everyone.."

1342
01:53:31,054 --> 01:53:32,215
Hey!

1343
01:53:35,726 --> 01:53:41,267
"The silence is around.
The ambience is glittering."

1344
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:51,318
"These moments are here today."

1345
01:53:51,366 --> 01:53:54,859
Ladies and gentlemen!
I'm Sidharth Mehra from Mumbai Beat.

1346
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:01,578
On the drums we have Laxmi..
and this is my friend Rishi.

1347
01:54:01,626 --> 01:54:03,242
Thank you, thank you.

1348
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:06,287
And this is our favorite song.
Hit it!

1349
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,923
Dude, not me not me!

1350
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:11,258
Go Sid!

1351
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:16,631
"First love and first.."

1352
01:54:17,392 --> 01:54:19,554
Sid's crazy, isn't he?

1353
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,807
Oh he was much crazier before!

1354
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:24,517
You can't even imagine
the things we've done!

1355
01:54:24,566 --> 01:54:26,398
"What state I've come to."

1356
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:30,394
"Restless heart.." - Go Sid!
- "Restless heart.."

1357
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:32,529
And now?-Now?

1358
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:34,781
Now he doesn't have time for us!

1359
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:40,363
New job.. new friends.. you know?

1360
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:47,294
"You tell me."

1361
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:54,173
"First love and first.."

1362
01:54:56,056 --> 01:54:57,672
Doesn't that make you feel bad?

1363
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:04,971
Are you kidding? Of course it does.
But it's Ok.

1364
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:11,019
Sid might have changed a lot..
but it's all for the better.

1365
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:16,441
"Restless heart.
- You tell me."

1366
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:22,072
"First love and first.."

1367
01:55:29,256 --> 01:55:34,001
You're really drunk Sid.
You should go to bed.

1368
01:55:43,562 --> 01:55:44,597
Sid?

1369
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:52,101
Are you Ok?

1370
01:58:00,865 --> 01:58:03,277
I know we're not talking
to each other..

1371
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:06,159
And that you're still angry.

1372
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:11,449
But I thought
that you would call one day..

1373
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:13,708
...and ask me to come back home.

1374
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:17,583
But.. you never did.

1375
01:58:19,968 --> 01:58:25,714
So I decided that I wouldn't come
see you until you called first.

1376
01:58:30,186 --> 01:58:31,301
But today..

1377
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:50,159
I got a job, Pa.. As an assistant
photographer for a magazine.

1378
01:58:53,585 --> 01:58:55,451
And I want to do this job!

1379
01:58:56,463 --> 01:59:00,832
I've been working really hard this
past month and I'm actually happy!

1380
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:06,049
I know I never mentioned
photography as a career..

1381
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:09,423
And that we have a family business
to take care of..

1382
01:59:09,684 --> 01:59:12,221
But I feel like you'll understand.

1383
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,688
Because photography is something
I got from you.

1384
01:59:21,237 --> 01:59:23,774
I'd forgotten that photography
was your passion too.

1385
01:59:24,783 --> 01:59:31,530
You used to take so many pictures..
why did you stop?

1386
01:59:38,713 --> 01:59:40,124
You grew up, son.

1387
01:59:42,133 --> 01:59:45,296
You didn't have time
for my photographs any more.

1388
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:49,213
And photography had meant
nothing more to me than..

1389
01:59:50,058 --> 01:59:51,640
...taking pictures of you.

1390
02:00:08,576 --> 02:00:12,535
My first paycheque, Pa. For you.

1391
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:24,707
Promise me..

1392
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:28,297
...that from now on you will put
your heart into everything you do.

1393
02:00:33,601 --> 02:00:34,887
I'm sorry, Pa.

1394
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:38,891
I love you.

1395
02:00:40,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Encoded by CharmeLeon

1396
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:24,566
What's going on, Sid?
Why did you ask me to rush home?

1397
02:01:29,824 --> 02:01:34,318
Thank God you're home! You won't
believe what happened today.

1398
02:01:34,996 --> 02:01:36,077
What?

1399
02:01:36,414 --> 02:01:38,075
I went to see Dad today.

1400
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:40,411
Everything is fine now.

1401
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,786
He asked me to come back home.

1402
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:48,215
I'm going home, Aisha!
Finally back to my own house

1403
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:55,297
Aish.. say something.

1404
02:01:57,185 --> 02:02:01,395
That's great, Sid..
that's really great..

1405
02:02:04,776 --> 02:02:06,232
When are you leaving?

1406
02:02:07,237 --> 02:02:10,150
Now. Dad's on his way to pick me up.

1407
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:14,695
You're leaving so soon...?

1408
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:21,415
Yep. Now this garbage dump
will look like a house again.

1409
02:02:29,634 --> 02:02:34,174
Aisha.. you let me
stay here for so long..

1410
02:02:35,515 --> 02:02:37,051
Thank you <i>so</i> much for everything.

1411
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:42,219
This is for you.

1412
02:02:47,193 --> 02:02:48,433
I don't want it.

1413
02:02:50,905 --> 02:02:55,570
Aisha, I know it's not much,
but I made it especially for you.

1414
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:58,155
I don't want your stupid gift, Ok?

1415
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:01,196
What are you getting so upset for?

1416
02:03:01,374 --> 02:03:04,241
You're so right.
Why am I getting upset?

1417
02:03:04,294 --> 02:03:06,376
After all, I knew this would happen.

1418
02:03:06,421 --> 02:03:08,082
You fought with your parents,
<i>so</i> you moved in.

1419
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:10,372
Now that you've made up with them,
you're moving out!

1420
02:03:10,425 --> 02:03:13,338
So? I'm moving back to my house.

1421
02:03:13,386 --> 02:03:14,717
I can't stay here forever, can I?

1422
02:03:14,762 --> 02:03:16,594
Why can't you?

1423
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:18,217
Aisha.. I don't understand..

1424
02:03:18,266 --> 02:03:21,304
Of course you don't!
You never understand anything!

1425
02:03:21,352 --> 02:03:24,720
You didn't even talk to me
before taking such a big decision!

1426
02:03:25,648 --> 02:03:28,265
Didn't even stop to think about
how I might feel!

1427
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:32,061
How can you be so
thoughtless and immature?!

1428
02:03:32,363 --> 02:03:34,821
I should've known. You're a kid
and always will be a kid!

1429
02:03:34,866 --> 02:03:39,360
Damn you Aisha!
Why do you always do this?

1430
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:43,121
Nothing I do is ever
good enough for you!

1431
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,957
Yes, I'm a kid
and always will be a kid!

1432
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:50,746
God, I'm tired of this..
tired of you calling me immature..

1433
02:03:50,798 --> 02:03:53,039
Tired of proving myself to you!

1434
02:03:54,302 --> 02:03:58,296
All these days, I've been trying
to change your opinion of me..

1435
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:02,674
...hoping that you'll see that I'm
not a kid any more, but it's useless!

1436
02:04:02,727 --> 02:04:04,638
You just don't see it!

1437
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:07,145
I'm sick of you Aisha!
I'm just so sick of you!

1438
02:04:27,001 --> 02:04:28,036
Aish..

1439
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:36,000
You're right Sid.
I'm the one who doesn't see it.

1440
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:45,392
Go home. All the best.

1441
02:04:58,408 --> 02:05:05,030
"Like the string instrument plays."

1442
02:05:05,415 --> 02:05:08,658
"Like the string instrument plays."

1443
02:05:09,168 --> 02:05:12,661
"Like the string instrument plays."

1444
02:05:12,964 --> 02:05:19,757
"Like the string instrument plays."

1445
02:05:20,263 --> 02:05:27,226
"Like the string instrument plays."

1446
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:34,646
"Your string instrument
is of no use."

1447
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:05,138
"The bird is angry..

1448
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:11,687
...It has left its nest."

1449
02:06:12,648 --> 02:06:17,688
...it has left its nest. "

1450
02:06:17,737 --> 02:06:22,948
...it has left its nest."

1451
02:06:24,035 --> 02:06:30,532
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek."

1452
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:33,075
"Tears roll down my cheek."

1453
02:06:33,127 --> 02:06:39,419
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek."

1454
02:06:39,675 --> 02:06:45,216
"it makes me restless.
Why does it sing sad song?"

1455
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:58,066
Hello Ma.. It's me, Aisha.

1456
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:06,442
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I was just missing you guys..

1457
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:08,735
Where's Dad?

1458
02:07:09,664 --> 02:07:12,622
"A stale night..

1459
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:15,034
...Is close to my pillow."

1460
02:07:15,711 --> 02:07:21,252
“The morning returned
seeing the close doors."

1461
02:07:21,592 --> 02:07:27,338
"The fire has extinguished
and the walls are cold."

1462
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:32,180
"Voice of the heart is echoing."

1463
02:07:32,228 --> 02:07:37,268
"Voice of the.."
- "Voice of the.."

1464
02:07:37,316 --> 02:07:43,312
"..heart is echoing."

1465
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:50,119
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek."

1466
02:07:50,163 --> 02:07:52,575
"Tears roll down my cheek."

1467
02:07:52,623 --> 02:07:59,086
"When I close my eyes,
tears roll down my cheek."

1468
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:04,796
"it makes me restless.
Why does it sing sad song?"

1469
02:08:04,844 --> 02:08:10,590
"Your string instrument
is of no use."

1470
02:08:13,853 --> 02:08:16,345
"Your string instrument
is of no use."

1471
02:08:16,814 --> 02:08:22,435
"Your string instrument
is of no use."

1472
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:25,736
"Your string instrument
is of no use."

1473
02:08:25,781 --> 02:08:30,742
Bhaiyya! Wake up Bhaiyya!

1474
02:08:42,256 --> 02:08:46,341
Bhaiyya? Are you Ok'?

1475
02:08:47,678 --> 02:08:49,168
Aren't you happy to be back home?

1476
02:08:53,017 --> 02:08:58,183
I'm fine, Chottu.
Now go, don't bug me.

1477
02:08:58,773 --> 02:09:02,061
Make sure you eat your breakfast
before it gets cold.

1478
02:09:02,109 --> 02:09:05,022
And your magazine
came this morning..

1479
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:44,334
"The feeling came
from the melting drops.."

1480
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:49,839
"The moment has come
close to my heart.“

1481
02:10:50,259 --> 02:10:55,629
"it touched the heart,
but I couldn't know.“

1482
02:10:55,931 --> 02:11:00,892
"Now when I looked,
I liked the moment."

1483
02:11:00,936 --> 02:11:05,772
"I can't do this."

1484
02:11:05,816 --> 02:11:11,732
"I'll send the message
through the wind."

1485
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:16,821
"Or should I come to you
on the wind?"

1486
02:11:17,078 --> 02:11:22,494
"I love you."

1487
02:11:23,459 --> 02:11:29,000
"Where do I get the words from?“

1488
02:11:29,256 --> 02:11:32,669
"Life is coming.“

1489
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:38,088
"Life is coming your way."

1490
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:40,882
'New Girl in the City'
- by Aisha Bannerjee.

1491
02:11:40,935 --> 02:11:46,601
Like many others before me,
I came to Mumbai with many dreams.

1492
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:50,525
The biggest one was
to become a writer.

1493
02:11:51,404 --> 02:11:55,272
With this column, Mumbai has
made that one dream come true.

1494
02:11:56,784 --> 02:12:00,197
But, even after a lot of struggle,
I couldn't do it justice.

1495
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:03,488
Everything I wrote seemed lacking.

1496
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:07,409
What could I say about this city
that hadn't been said before?

1497
02:12:08,379 --> 02:12:13,670
So I tore up my approved article
and began writing again.

1498
02:12:18,681 --> 02:12:20,263
In just two months..

1499
02:12:20,307 --> 02:12:24,801
I've begun to feel a strange love
for Mumbai, as if its my own..

1500
02:12:24,854 --> 02:12:26,436
What lay at the core of this love?

1501
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,266
My exciting new job?

1502
02:12:28,482 --> 02:12:31,600
My little flat? Or my independence?

1503
02:12:31,986 --> 02:12:34,853
What has this city given me
that makes me love her so?

1504
02:12:35,281 --> 02:12:38,524
Actually the answer had been
in front of me all along..

1505
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:40,362
I just didn't see it.

1506
02:12:42,246 --> 02:12:45,204
I met someone the first night
that I was in Bombay.

1507
02:12:45,249 --> 02:12:50,790
A boy, a friend, a room mate,
a companion - just someone.

1508
02:12:51,005 --> 02:12:54,794
He didn't really have
any ambitions or goals..

1509
02:12:55,176 --> 02:12:58,168
...but he sure knew
how to enjoy his life.

1510
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:01,797
I wonder if the joy
of making a new home..

1511
02:13:01,849 --> 02:13:05,092
...would have been
the same without his help..

1512
02:13:05,352 --> 02:13:10,597
I look back upon a lonely night made
less lonely by a shared cup of tea.

1513
02:13:11,066 --> 02:13:14,184
When I had first come here,
I had my goals straight.

1514
02:13:14,236 --> 02:13:15,897
But now I know..

1515
02:13:15,946 --> 02:13:18,654
...that the joy of achieving
these goals is meaningful..

1516
02:13:18,699 --> 02:13:20,781
...only when shared
with someone else.

1517
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:23,777
Only now do I see
that my strange love..

1518
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:27,242
For this city is actually one
with my love for this person..

1519
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:31,539
...he's the one who taught me
the essence of love.

1520
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:36,463
Mumbai is as tough
as it is beautiful.

1521
02:13:36,509 --> 02:13:38,420
Sometimes,
while running after our goals

1522
02:13:38,469 --> 02:13:41,006
we lose sight of the things
that really matter.

1523
02:13:41,055 --> 02:13:45,720
So close your eyes for a second,

1524
02:13:45,768 --> 02:13:48,977
Look for your special someone, and
see the city through their eyes.

1525
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:52,389
You'll see that Mumbai is even more
beautiful than you ever imagined.

1526
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:55,934
Who knows, even you might
get a companion like me.

1527
02:13:55,986 --> 02:13:59,980
"Life is coming your way."

1528
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:32,682
"Like the string instrument plays."

1529
02:14:33,023 --> 02:14:35,685
"Like the string instrument plays."

1530
02:14:35,985 --> 02:14:38,693
"Like the string instrument plays."

1531
02:14:38,988 --> 02:14:41,901
"Like the string instrument plays."

1532
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:46,697
Why did you write
such along article?!

1533
02:14:46,745 --> 02:14:48,031
Couldn't you have told me
all of this at home?

1534
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:53,575
"Like the string instrument plays."
- You know that I'm an idiot!

1535
02:14:57,256 --> 02:15:01,375
Aish.. I love you too!

1536
02:15:03,053 --> 02:15:04,418
I love you!

1537
02:15:04,805 --> 02:15:06,091
I love you, Sid!

1538
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:11,681
"Like the string instrument plays."

1539

and a new day has awakened.“

1550
02:16:51,662 --> 02:16:58,375
"..the voice
from all the directions."

1551
02:16:58,419 --> 02:16:59,784
...wake up!"

1552
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:09,423
"Listen to what all say."

1553
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:16,176
"Choose the one
which you feel is right."

1554
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:24,192
"You decide what you have to do."

1555
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:31,862
"Think where you have to go."

1556
02:17:33,162 --> 02:17:39,625
"You are the traveler
and you are the caravan."

1562
02:18:10,908 --> 02:18:16,745
"See to that today's day
shouldn't be like yesterday's.“

1563
02:18:17,706 --> 02:18:23,543
"Don't sleep today like yesterday."

1564
02:18:24,505 --> 02:18:27,418
"Why are you so lazy?
Say something."

1565
02:18:27,466 --> 02:18:30,754
"Listen to something
and do something.“

1566
02:18:31,345 --> 02:18:38,342
"Cry or laugh. Fill some
or other color in your life."

1567
02:18:38,393 --> 02:18:41,681
