1
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,480
'Smoking and alcohol consumption
are injurious to health.'

2
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,800
"Why are these nights
becoming erratic?"

3
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,880
"Why are these nights
becoming erratic?"

4
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,760
"Why are these nights
becoming erratic?"

5
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,560
"Why are these nights
becoming erratic?"

6
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,360
"Oh, baby..
You're driving me crazy."

7
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,520
"Come a little closer to me."

8
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,440
"Oh, baby..
You're driving me crazy."

9
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,960
"Come a little closer to me."

10
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,360
"These nights.."

11
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,400
"I search for you
in everything."

12
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,320
"I want to be with you."

13
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,880
"I am losing myself in you..'

14
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
'Hey, guys!
Welcome back to the show.'

15
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,960
'I'm playing
a different kind of music'

16
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,480
'as it's Valentine's Day.'

17
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
'And the music that I played now
is called Jazz music, guys.'

18
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
'By the way, our caller,
Suraj is on the line.'

19
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
'Didn't you hear his story?'

20
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
'Apparently, he hasn't quarrelled'

21
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
'in the three years
that he has been in love.'

22
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,800
'You might find it difficult to
believe. Even I feel the same way.'

23
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,280
'Let it be.
Suraj, tell us..'

24
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,040
'Where did you see your girlfriend
for the first time?'

25
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,080
'When did you see her?'

26
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,720
'Tell us about that
unforgettable day.'

27
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,840
'It happened on a Friday.'

28
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,400
'It was the Black Friday
of my life.'

29
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,400
We just landed.
We'll be there in five minutes.

30
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,040
Hey! She's talking
to an airport officer.

31
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
She'll come..

32
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Okay..
She's here.

33
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,960
Is it Swathi?
- Yes. - Give it to me.

34
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
What has happened
to this place?

35
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,240
See.. - Have you taken everything?
- I'm telling you.

36
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,920
Kerala is no more
God's own country.

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,480
'Shoba, you are here
to attend my wedding, right?'

38
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
'My cousin is waiting
for you outside.'

39
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
'You'll recognise him
when you see him.' - Shoba?

40
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,080
'He looks like a tramp.'

41
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
Tramp?
- 'Did you see him?'

42
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
Yes..
I think I found him.

43
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Please..

44
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,200
Even I used to live in Chennai.
- Oh!

45
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,160
Where in Chennai?

46
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
Someplace in Chennai..

47
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,880
By the way,
how is Swathi related to you?

48
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm Sagar,
son of Swathi's uncle's

49
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
elder brother.

50
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,880
How is Dinesh related to you?

51
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,400
Do you know Dinesh?
- Yes. Swathi told me everything.

52
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,360
Is that so?

53
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,960
What can I say, buddy?

54
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,680
There's a good-for-nothing
like him in every family.

55
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,120
He drinks and picks fights.

56
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
He has become a public nuisance.

57
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,080
The only fault that he has

58
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
is that he is my cousin.

59
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,600
That's not how it is.
You know?

60
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
By the way, I'm also a doctor.

61
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
Oh, wow! Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

62
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,080
Where are you practising?
- I just

63
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,280
go to nearby hospitals
and operate on patients.

64
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,440
So, how do you know Swathi?

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
All of us studied together

66
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
in Chennai.
- Is that so?

67
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,960
Shoba, I..
- Hey, Venkat!

68
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
Either speak in Tamil
or Malayalam.

69
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
Or just keep quiet for some time.

70
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
Tell me more..

71
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,360
"Oh, beloved.."

72
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Isn't it perfect now?

73
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
Look at this.

74
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Hi, Swathi!
- Hi.

75
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,760
"Oh, beloved.."

76
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,520
"Oh, beloved.."

77
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
Shoba..

78
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,160
By the way,
while you were in college

79
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,640
you never used to wear earrings

80
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,720
bangles and necklaces.

81
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,640
You also said that you wanted
your wedding to be simple.

82
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,800
Is this the simple wedding
that you were talking about?

83
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,160
When I thought about it later

84
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,480
I realised that weddings
are occasions

85
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
that happen once in a lifetime.

86
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,240
That's why I would like to do it
in a grand manner.

87
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,440
Who said so?

88
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,560
You can get married
any number of times.

89
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,000
You, instigator..

90
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,160
Do you have a plan
to get married again?

91
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Where's Anand?

92
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,280
Anand and his family
will arrive at night.

93
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,360
Oh!
Look at the way she's blushing.

94
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Where are your parents?

95
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,880
My parents are practising dance.

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
Dance practice?

97
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,760
"Oh, beloved! You are wonderful!
What you do is great too."

98
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
What's he doing?

99
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Stand up! Move aside..
- "Oh, beloved.."

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
Step aside..

101
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,600
Help me stand up.

102
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
"With your touch.."
- Oh, God.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Stop the music.. Let's try again.
Come on.

104
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,920
"The canopy is ready..
- "The wedding canopy is ready.."

105
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:23,720
"Oh, bride! Adorn yourself
as you are getting married today!"

106
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,120
"Oh, dear! You are
getting married today." - Come.

107
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,120
All of you have come!
- How are you, sir?

108
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,800
Tamil?

109
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,480
Did you forget Malayalam, Shoba?

110
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,400
You should come to your hometown
once in a while.

111
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,320
That's not the case, sir.
I don't get time

112
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,440
as I'm busy in Chennai.

113
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,600
You have to find time.

114
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
Where else can you find
the beauty

115
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,960
of our lush, green hometown?

116
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,640
There are dance and other events
at night.

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
I expect involvement
from all of you.

118
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh, no!
Do we have to dance, sir?

119
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
Yes. That's required..

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
There's no event
other than dance.

121
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,280
Am I not right?
- Yes.

122
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,280
Wasn't there another person
with you?

123
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,560
Kala's husband..

124
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,840
Who is she to ask me
to keep quiet, buddy?

125
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
Who does she think she is?

126
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,320
Who are you talking about, buddy?
- Shoba..

127
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,960
She's the girl who asked me
to keep quiet in the car.

128
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,560
She's our gang leader, buddy.

129
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,760
She's a feminist.

130
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,840
Poor girl..

131
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,760
She doesn't look like one.

132
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,240
She's my wife's best friend.

133
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,800
My wife never listens to me.

134
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,000
She does everything
after consulting Shoba.

135
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,240
She has no respect for me, buddy.

136
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,920
Sad, buddy.

137
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,400
Who's your wife?

138
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,560
She was sleeping in the back seat.

139
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,920
Kala..
She's my wife.

140
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,200
Is she your wife?

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
You don't believe me, right?
- No.

142
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,040
Show it.

143
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,640
I may be dark-complexioned

144
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
but I'm good-hearted.

145
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
That's why I made her
fall for me easily.

146
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,560
Buddy, who was the girl
sitting next to Shoba?

147
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,560
The one who looked cute..

148
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,760
Cute?
That's Priya.

149
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
She's a good girl.

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,680
She has a nice character, buddy.

151
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Anyway, thanks.

152
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I'll see you later.

153
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,680
Buddy, what about the bill?
- Let's pay the bill later.

154
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,680
Just come.

155
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
Buddy..

156
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,720
Why don't we have another drink?

157
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
Let's not have it now.

158
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Let's have one during lunch
and one in the night.

159
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,640
We can have it all the time.

160
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,360
We have to do it
to be energetic, right?

161
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,880
Okay.
I'll wait in the room in that case.

162
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,960
Okay.

163
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
Who was that?

164
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,800
Someone..

165
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,160
You don't even
know his name, right?

166
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,720
Why do you need to know his name
and details

167
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,080
for drinking together, right?
- Yes.

168
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,280
No, Aunt.

169
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
By the way, where's Dinesh?

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,680
Isn't he home?

171
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,840
That means even you don't know
where he is.

172
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,840
He took his bag and left home
last night.

173
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,480
He said that he'd not let this
happen as long as he is alive!

174
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
He said that the wedding
would take place

175
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,440
only if he's dead.

176
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,280
He said many things
like that before leaving.

177
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
If he dies?

178
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,960
He mentioned that his dead body
would surface in the river

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,040
on the day of the wedding.

180
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,120
How is that possible?

181
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
The dead body surfaces
after three days, right?

182
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,000
If he had left
the day before yesterday

183
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,040
his dead body would've
surfaced tomorrow.

184
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,480
Didn't he leave yesterday?

185
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,120
Didn't you ask him which river
he was going to drown himself in?

186
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,440
I asked him.

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
When I did,
he looked at me and asked me

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,760
what kind of a mother I am.
- He's right about that.

189
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
When he said that, I told him
to go and kill himself.

190
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Are you his mom or what!
- Go and find out where he went.

191
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
Isn't he your friend?

192
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,160
If you find him, just ask him

193
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,040
to come home at night.

194
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,600
Otherwise, I'll teach him a lesson.

195
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,120
Did you understand?
- Okay, Aunt.

196
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
Where will I look for him?
What kind of a mom is she?

197
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
He's here.
- Did you like it?

198
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Hi.

199
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
Where were you? You're late.
- It looked beautiful.

200
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,720
I just went to see it.

201
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,080
Where?
- I..

202
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
Hello?
- I referred to the view.

203
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,560
Yes, Dad. We just arrived.
- The river is beautiful.

204
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,400
Everything is all right, Dad.

205
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,520
Yes, Dad.

206
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,040
What happened? Why is she crying?
- I'm sorry.

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,480
Dad, can I call you
after some time?

208
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
Okay.

209
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,520
She was fine, right?

210
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,600
What happened all of a sudden?
- What are you all discussing?

211
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,240
Priya, it's her wedding tomorrow.
- No.

212
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,880
I asked her about Ravi.

213
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,800
Did you have to bring that up

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
when we have a lot of
other topics to discuss?

215
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Okay.
Forget that..

216
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,480
Hey! Weren't you guys talking
about her cousin in the car?

217
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,080
What's his name?

218
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Dinesh?

219
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,240
Even he doesn't know
where he's going

220
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,160
or what he's doing.

221
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,600
He's a different kind of retarded

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,960
psycho.

223
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,680
Apparently, cousins aren't
supposed to get married.

224
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
I would've transfused my blood
for her, Dad.

225
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,080
Mr. Dinesh.

226
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
If you drink so much..
- Hey..

227
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,600
You are just the driver and
you needn't have the concern

228
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,560
that my family doesn't have
for me. - That's not the reason.

229
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
You'll finish it soon
if you drink so much.

230
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,240
There's no bar nearby.

231
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,440
Dad, you left me alone.

232
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,880
Hello?
- 'Is he in a bad mood?'

233
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,120
No. He's looking at the sky

234
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,040
and talking to his father.

235
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,360
'Great..'
- He forces me to drink alcohol

236
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
and brags about it later.

237
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,640
Shameless guy. - How can I bear
it! - 'Hey! That's enough.'

238
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,080
Dad..
- Sagar, I'm fed up with him.

239
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
'Even I'm fed up with him.'

240
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll give the phone to him.
- 'Give it.' - How could she..

241
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,120
Mr. Dinesh..

242
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,560
It's Mr. Sagar.

243
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,720
Won't you let me die peacefully?

244
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,520
'Dinesh, she must've said
something when she was young.'

245
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,640
'She changed her decision
after she grew up, right?' - Oh.

246
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,160
That means you're
on her side, right?

247
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,520
'I'm always on your side, idiot!'

248
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,840
'Both of them
are celebrating here.'

249
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,440
'You can kill yourself tomorrow
if you want. But today..'

250
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,920
'Shouldn't we teach her
a small lesson, Dinesh?'

251
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
Not a small one..

252
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,200
Let it be a big one.
- 'That's the spirit.'

253
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,320
Start the vehicle..

254
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
'Wear seatbelts
while driving cars.'

255
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,760
You reek of alcohol.

256
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,080
You look awful, Dinesh.

257
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,800
A wedding will be conducted here.

258
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,200
Wedding..
Oh..

259
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,040
You're dressed up for it, right?

260
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,640
How is it? Doesn't it look good?
- Shut up!

261
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,400
Tell me about the plan!

262
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,880
Get out first.

263
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,520
I'll kill him today!

264
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,760
Hey, pal.

265
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,960
"You're the one"

266
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
"who was in my heart"

267
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,840
"since childhood."

268
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,800
"You were the one in my heart."

269
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,800
"You're the one"

270
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,320
"who was in my heart.."
- My career and my ambitions

271
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,720
are important to me.

272
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
I don't have time to waste
by having a relationship.

273
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,520
"You were the one in my heart."

274
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,800
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

275
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,400
"Rock the party, baby."

276
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,440
"Just leave if you can't do it."

277
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,920
Dinesh, when I googled,
I found out that

278
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,040
children born to blood relatives

279
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,440
will have disabilities.

280
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,880
Let's not continue
our relationship, Dinesh.

281
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,600
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

283
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,160
"Rock the party, baby."

284
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,920
"Just leave if you can't do it."

285
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

286
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,600
"Rock the party, baby."

287
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
"Just leave if you can't do it."

288
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,440
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

289
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,040
"Rock the party, baby."

290
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,840
"Just leave if you can't do it."

291
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
Isn't it entertaining?

292
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,560
Just forget her
if she doesn't love you.

293
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Both of you aren't a good match
anyway, right? - Yes.

294
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,840
Dinesh.

295
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,120
There are many girls
in this world.

296
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,880
If you don't explore all that

297
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,680
you're wasting your time, dear.
- Isn't that a movie dialogue?

298
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't you have anything else
to tell me?

299
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,760
I have something to tell you.

300
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,360
The event after this program

301
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
is my dance.
- Are you serious?

302
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,280
You have to watch it

303
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,520
and have food before leaving.

304
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,720
"Don't laugh at me"

305
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,600
"when I put myself
in trouble, pal."

306
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,360
"Don't laugh at me, pal."

307
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,120
"You're the one in my heart.."

308
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,760
That guy is Dinesh.
- What?

309
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
The guy who's standing there
is Dinesh.

310
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,640
"You were the one in my heart."

311
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,040
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

312
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,680
"Rock the party, baby."

313
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,320
"Just leave if you can't do it."
- Brijesh!

314
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,760
"On the floor, baby. Hit
it hard, baby." - B for Brijesh..

315
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,120
Do you recognise me?

316
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,280
Let's get him.

317
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,880
Let go of me..
- You were clapping your hands

318
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
for a long time.

319
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Let go..

320
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,120
I was just asking you if you
recognised me. - What?

321
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,200
Don't you recognise me?
I'm DJ Brijesh.

322
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,880
I was your junior in school.

323
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,600
DJB.
Don't you remember me?

324
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,480
I don't.
- Oh.

325
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,680
Okay, fine.
- Briju..

326
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,720
Don't you have a sister
named Rachitha?

327
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,320
Where is she now?

328
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,200
So, you remember my sister.
But you don't remember me.

329
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,640
Okay.
Just leave.

330
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,760
Hey.. Let him go.

331
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,840
Tell me about our plan.
- What plan?

332
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,200
Didn't you ask me to come so that
we could teach her a lesson?

333
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
About that..

334
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,760
I've arranged
some itching powder.

335
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,480
I've also found out
his room number.

336
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,480
Let's scatter it
all over his room, Dinesh.

337
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Didn't I tell you that it has to be
something big?

338
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
What do we do then?

339
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
We can't kill him, right?

340
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,240
We should kill him.
- Kill him?

341
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,200
Get lost.. Go and kill yourself
if you want.

342
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
I'm going.

343
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey!

344
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,440
What was the groom's room number?

345
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,320
312.

346
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,120
3, 2, 1..

347
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,480
Come on.

348
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,000
Go there by yourself.

349
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What's there?

350
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,440
Wow!

351
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,400
Well..
- What do you want?

352
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,080
I'm wondering how I can kill him.

353
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
The program will be over soon

354
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
and they're going to come there.

355
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,680
Just do something and come down.

356
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
I have an idea!

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,960
They're coming. Come fast..
- I didn't do anything.

358
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,880
Come.. Run..
- Run..

359
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,880
This way..
- Yes. What did you do?

360
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,280
He shouldn't have messed with me.

361
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
Did you slit his throat?

362
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,200
Shut up!

363
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,760
I walked like a cat

364
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
across that corridor
filled with darkness.

365
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,880
I opened the door slowly.

366
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
Pogo..

367
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,040
Bangles?

368
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,360
Drat!

369
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,480
I have an idea!

370
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,760
This is for you!

371
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,160
Dinesh.
- What?

372
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,160
Things have gone
out of control, Dinesh.

373
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,000
They're saying that her
condition is very serious.

374
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
Anyway, your idea
has misfired completely.

375
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,200
Girl?

376
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,680
What's her name?

377
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,840
Shoba.
- Shoba.

378
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,760
What was Shoba doing
in the groom's room at night?

379
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,320
That's right.

380
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,760
Nobody wants to know that.

381
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,520
That guy and she
are cheating Swathi.

382
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,280
Why don't we ruin this wedding
by saying that?

383
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,120
Dinesh, let that girl
marry someone

384
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,680
and do whatever she wants.

385
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,640
Isn't that better?

386
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,840
Isn't that what you want?
- Yes.

387
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
But still..

388
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,880
What?

389
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,160
I feel something..
- Fishy..

390
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,400
Fishy.
- Fishy?

391
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,000
Fishy.

392
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,160
Is she okay?
- She's okay.

393
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Nothing to worry.

394
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,280
But the doctor has asked her to
take rest here tonight.

395
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,160
One small thing.

396
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,160
If someone stays here with me

397
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,440
it'll be very helpful.

398
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,880
Not one, I'll give
you two people.

399
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,040
Thank you.
- Satheesh, call them.

400
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,800
Shall I call Dinesh?
- Call both of them.

401
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,320
Hey, Dinesh!

402
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Your uncle is calling
both of you.

403
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,160
Why?

404
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Ask him to come here if he wants.
- Dinesh, don't make me angry.

405
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Why did you go to that toilet
when you should have slept?

406
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,560
Wouldn't she slip
if you spill hair oil on the floor?

407
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,040
Do you know for how long
I've been waiting here? - Oh, no.

408
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Just come!
- Kala, just go to the hotel

409
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,080
along with Venkat.
Don't worry.

410
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
I'll give you a tight slap!

411
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Dinesh..

412
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,080
You have to stay here tonight.

413
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,960
I can't do it.
- Hush.

414
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,400
You can stay here if you want.

415
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,320
Aren't you my dear nephew?
Please adjust.

416
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,320
I gave them my word that I would
make someone stay here.

417
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,520
Please.

418
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,560
Didn't you hear him?
You have to come home

419
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,480
tomorrow morning
with her.

420
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,320
Ask him to stay here with me
in that case.

421
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,840
It's all right.
I'll stay here alone.

422
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,840
Good.

423
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,280
Everyone, please come.
- Jeez!

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,280
Drat!

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,560
She looks good.

426
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,600
Oh.

427
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,280
That might be the case.

428
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,760
Never forget
to destroy the evidence

429
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,040
when you do something wrong.

430
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,800
Especially when the person at fault
leaves behind his wallet..

431
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,280
Wallet.. - He would be
a halfwit, right? - Oh, no.

432
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
His room is 412.

433
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,080
My room is 312.

434
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,080
Oh.

435
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,960
Idiot!

436
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,560
I-I went to the wrong room.

437
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,520
The bangle on your hand
is mine.

438
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Oh..

439
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,960
I got the wrong person.

440
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
Please don't tell anybody about it.

441
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,720
I'll tell everyone.

442
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,840
It was just an accident.

443
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,880
Please don't defame me.

444
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,880
That's okay. Aren't you going to
kill yourself tomorrow anyway?

445
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,200
I won't tell anybody about it.

446
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,640
But you have to do as I say.

447
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,160
I'll do anything.

448
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,480
You have to attend her
wedding tomorrow.

449
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,920
That's..
- Come on.

450
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,320
This too shall pass.

451
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,640
There might be a girl waiting
for you as well.

452
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,360
She'll change your life.
Trust me.

453
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

454
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,520
And don't forget to trim your beard
before you come.

455
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Usually, most of the girls
like my beard.

456
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
Not a beard like this one..

457
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,240
Trim your beard,
get a hair cut

458
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,640
and take a shower before coming.

459
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Didn't I take a shower
two days ago?

460
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,760
If you do that,
girls will fall for you.

461
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,680
That's right..

462
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,760
Really?
- Really.

463
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,720
Okay, Dinesh.
Goodnight.

464
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll sit here if you want.

465
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,680
If you need tea, coffee

466
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,640
or medicines..
- No, Dinesh.

467
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,960
Don't you want me to sit here?
- Thank you.

468
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,200
That girl who's sitting outside
is snoring a lot.

469
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,920
Bangle.

470
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,680
She avoided me.

471
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,360
Forget it.

472
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
And we're entering Swathi's room.
- Show me your hand.

473
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,600
All the girls are getting ready.
- A bit more.

474
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,000
Super!
- She looks good, doesn't she?

475
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,800
My wife also looks good today.

476
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,800
What are you doing here
in the girls' changing room?

477
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Go outside.
- She looks amazing.

478
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,480
Why are you roaming around here?

479
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,960
Didn't you get ready, dear?

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,120
Let me finish this, Uncle.

481
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,600
You can doll yourself up better
than this for your next wedding.

482
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,760
Come fast.

483
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,040
1, 2, 3..

484
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,720
Where's the fourth girl who fell
down, in the toilet?

485
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,960
Where did she go?
- Where's Shoba?

486
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,600
She'll be here..

487
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,600
Even though she arrives late

488
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
she arrives in style.

489
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,280
Am I right?
- You're right.

490
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,120
"Oh, bride.."

491
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,040
"Oh, bride.."

492
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,560
"Oh, bride.."

493
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,000
Rice..

494
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you want some rice?
Don't you want it?

495
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,040
All right.

496
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Some rice.

497
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,480
Have some rice.
- Please eat.

498
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Would you like some rice?
- Enough.. - Have some more.

499
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,320
Some more.
- A bit more. - Thanks.

500
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,280
Rice. Have it
if you want. - So sweet..

501
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,840
Sir, please have some rice.
- Eat it..

502
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,160
Ma'am, rice?

503
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,640
I've been noticing this
ever since you came on the stage.

504
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,760
You were smiling back at him
when he smiled at you.

505
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,360
Why do you have a soft corner
for him?

506
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
I was convinced after seeing
his enthusiasm.

507
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,720
No.. He's a nice guy.

508
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,120
Very innocent.

509
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,640
You'll find out if he's innocent
after you get to know him better.

510
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
You don't know him
well, Shoba.

511
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,960
Fresh buttermilk..

512
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,880
Buttermilk..

513
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,160
Shall I pour some buttermilk?
- I don't want buttermilk.

514
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,720
It was prepared just now.
It's fresh.

515
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Have it.
- I don't want it.

516
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,080
Didn't you eat the banana
that I gave you? Eat it.

517
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,960
Dinesh, come here..

518
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Just give me a second.
My mom won't let me stay here.

519
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
Come here.

520
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,600
What do you want?

521
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,240
Did you see Swathi's friend
who came from Chennai?

522
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Why don't we consider
her for Satish?

523
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,600
She's a good girl.

524
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,400
Just shut up!

525
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,360
Otherwise, I'll stab you with this!
- What is it?

526
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,560
Sir, please give me
some buttermilk.

527
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
You don't need it.

528
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,200
Tissue.
Give it to me.

529
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,800
Hi. How's everything going?
- Hi.

530
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,320
Oh, wow! - Yes.
- Now, you look good.

531
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,160
Yes. I know..
- You look better now.

532
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,720
Nice earrings.
- Thank you.

533
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,320
Give me your number.
- Oh, yes. Sure. - Yes, okay.

534
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,600
Hey, Shoba.
What are you doing here? Come..

535
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,080
It's already late. - Give me
a second. - Everybody

536
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,640
is waiting for you to take photos.

537
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,880
Dad, they're all going to
leave now.

538
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,280
Aren't you supposed to stay
and enjoy for a few days

539
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,600
when you come for a wedding?

540
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,200
Aren't you supposed to plan things
accordingly? - No, sir.

541
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,360
I have some work there.

542
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,560
I'll be able to get it done
only if I leave now.

543
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,040
I see..

544
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,320
So, what can I do for you?
- I see..

545
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,240
Shall I arrange a driver
to drop you? - Yes..

546
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,800
Uncle, I heard that you
were looking for a driver.

547
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,480
It's for Shoba.
- Is that so?

548
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,800
I'll drop you off.
- Oh.

549
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,480
Wouldn't it be
inconvenient for Dinesh?

550
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,040
Oh..
No way!

551
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,200
How would it be inconvenient?
- Yes.

552
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,400
The only thing that
he knows is driving.

553
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,040
Shoba, you might want to go
to the room and take rest.

554
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,160
I'll come to take your luggage.

555
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
Room number 412, right?

556
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,520
Yes.

557
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,240
Okay. I'll come.
- I booked it..

558
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,120
Okay..
Okay, sir.

559
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,400
Bye..
- Bye.

560
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,840
See you..
- Bye..

561
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,400
Bye.
- See you.

562
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,520
You should be happy!
- Why are you so enthusiastic?

563
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,000
Can't I show some enthusiasm?

564
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,360
Do whatever you want!

565
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,160
Sad.

566
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Jeez!

567
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,240
Hey!

568
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,640
"Oh, beautiful girl, I'll tell you
something if you come with me."

569
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,560
"My life.."

570
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,880
"I will not leave you."

571
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,680
"If I do so.."
- "I will not sleep."

572
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,640
I know everything that's going on.

573
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,320
You don't need me anymore.

574
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,600
What did Shoba tell you?

575
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,160
She's deeply in love with me.

576
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
So, I'm just doing a small favour
for her.

577
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,680
Yes..

578
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,960
Based on her expressions,
I could make out that

579
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,560
she isn't interested in you.
- Yes..

580
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,560
That's possible..

581
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,680
Isn't she a young woman?
It's quite natural.

582
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,080
Come here.

583
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,880
And stand here.

584
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,400
What was his room number?
- 312.

585
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,920
What was it?
- 312.

586
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,520
312 is her room number.

587
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,440
His room number is 412.

588
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
Was it the wrong room?
- It was the wrong room.

589
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,600
Not just the room,
it was a different floor.

590
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,280
But that's okay.

591
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,600
This is the first time that
I benefited from your carelessness.

592
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,360
Didn't you benefit from it?

593
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,440
Anyway, aren't you happy?

594
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,360
Definitely. - Why don't we
have a couple of shots then?

595
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,880
Oh, no!
I'm super busy, you know?

596
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,960
I have to go to the airport
and I have plans.

597
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,640
Love, lust..
Just get lost.

598
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,320
If you have a couple of shots,
you'll be in a good mood.

599
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,440
It'll make you energetic.

600
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,240
After drinking,
you'll be romantic.

601
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Really?
- Yes.

602
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,360
Come..

603
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,360
What's the time now?
- 2 o'clock.

604
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,120
In that case, we can have a couple
of shots, right?

605
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,640
Absolutely..

606
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,520
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

607
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,520
"Rock the party, baby."

608
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,960
What's the time?

609
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,280
2 o'clock.

610
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
In that case,
give me two more shots.

611
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,320
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

612
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,400
"Rock the party, baby."

613
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,200
Dinesh.

614
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,320
Hey, gorgeous.
- Yes.

615
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,480
Let's..

616
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Just one..
Oh, no..

617
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,840
Shall I make another drink?

618
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,880
Give me two more shots, buddy.

619
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,520
Oh, no!
That's enough.

620
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,000
Enough..
- He can't hold his drink.

621
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,440
"A cold night that smells like"

622
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,440
"Pandanus flower.."
Has it got dark?

623
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,720
The time is 2 o'clock.

624
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,800
But it's very dark
outside, Dinesh.

625
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,440
I think this watch isn't working.
- Hey!

626
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,800
"When I see you standing
on the veranda or the doorstep"

627
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,640
"I go crazy."

628
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,720
"I go crazy."

629
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,480
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

630
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,160
"Rock the party, baby."
- You moron!

631
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,840
"Just leave if you can't
do that."

632
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,960
"On the floor, baby!"

633
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,720
Dinesh, don't get upset.

634
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,480
Can't you call her
and tell her that

635
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,320
you couldn't come due
to extenuating circumstances?

636
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
Do you have her number?
- No. Don't you have it?

637
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
No. She just has my number.

638
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,480
Dinesh, how could
you be so stupid!

639
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,400
A girl wouldn't call you
even if she says she would!

640
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,640
You should have got her number
and ensured it's the right one.

641
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,080
She is neither going to call
nor text you.

642
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,600
Get lost!

643
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Bloody fool!

644
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,640
Mom.. If you plan to advise me

645
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,880
I will let you
do it tomorrow morning.

646
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,200
Please let me be for now.
I am very sleepy.

647
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,960
Swathi got married
and she left.

648
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Can't you quit drinking
at least now, Dinesh?

649
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,800
Jeez! She isn't the reason
I drank today.

650
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,720
I'm not going to drink
because of her.

651
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,320
Aren't you happy now?
Please leave.

652
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,640
Excuse me.
- Yes.

653
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,080
I was thinking
of getting married.

654
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,400
What do you think?

655
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,960
Go to sleep.

656
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,200
Dad!

657
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,440
How come he is playing music?

658
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,560
It seems like
he is happy today!

659
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,760
He never wakes up
so early.

660
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,880
I don't know what happened
to him today.

661
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,200
Let me serve him tea.

662
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,440
"I never realised that
all I could see was you."

663
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,440
I will send him to you.

664
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,640
Please explain to him
that he should mend his ways.

665
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
All right. Send him.
- Okay.

666
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,480
We will advise him.
- Okay.

667
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,920
Call him.

668
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,680
"You came.."

669
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,720
She has come.

670
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,120
"Oh, the bird of love!"

671
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,040
Why do you do things that make
you a laughing stock?

672
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,520
What was the movie you'd watch
to join the army?

673
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
'Vaaranam'?
- 'Vaaranam Aayiram.'

674
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,480
It wasn't because
you were patriotic, right?

675
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,760
Tea.. - Your interests keep
changing, right, Dinesh?

676
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,080
"This love.."

677
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,200
Once you graduated, we made
you look after the textiles shop.

678
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,160
You were flirting with every single
woman at the shop!

679
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,240
Jeez.

680
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,240
You lost all the money you earned
in Dubai, in the stock market.

681
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,160
Dinesh, your partners are waiting
downstairs.

682
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,360
Pay them what you owe.
Go.

683
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,320
If you don't have money,
tell me and I will do it.

684
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Do it then. - Really?
Why should I settle your debts!

685
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,280
Go and meet them.

686
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,040
Come on.

687
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,960
They have shown up
so early in the day.

688
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,880
Good morning.

689
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,400
Good morning.

690
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,640
My money..

691
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
Come on.

692
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Dinesh, she has grown old.

693
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,800
You should be more responsible.

694
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,480
Let me get you some tea.
- Okay.

695
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,160
Dinesh. - What is it?
- Just do whatever you want

696
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,720
but pay us our money.
- Dear..

697
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,280
I am pleading with you.
You owe me lakhs of rupees!

698
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,400
The stock exchange
is at an all-time low.

699
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,160
Really?
- Sensex has taken a hit too.

700
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
What do you expect me to do?
- What did you say about sex?

701
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,320
Shut up! I said Sensex
and not sex!

702
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,120
It is a technical term.
- Hey.

703
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,320
Mutual funds..

704
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,960
Mutual fund investments
are subject to market risks.

705
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,200
Read all scheme related
documents carefully.

706
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
What is it?
- Just a procedure..

707
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,520
Dinesh, she has grown old.
You should be more responsible.

708
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,920
I know I am growing
old.. - Move..

709
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,560
Don't you have anything
else to tell him?

710
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,760
'Hi, Dinesh.
Hope you are doing good.'

711
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,280
'It was so nice to meet you people.
Had a wonderful time.'

712
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
'Will miss you guys!'

713
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,480
'Tell me if you come
to Chennai.'

714
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,720
'All the best.
Shoba.'

715
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Do one thing.
Take him to Mumbai. - No..

716
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,640
Or you should take him to Dubai.
- No.

717
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,400
Terrorist attacks are frequent
in Mumbai.

718
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,960
It's so hard to survive there.
- Yes!

719
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,240
The climate in Dubai is horrendous.
It's so hot and I struggle there.

720
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,920
Excuse me, guys.
- He won't bear it.

721
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,320
I was thinking of doing a course
about the national stock exchange.

722
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,040
I reckon you are heading
to Chennai.

723
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,240
Excellent.
- Can I do it in Chennai?

724
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,880
I was considering going
to Australia. - No.

725
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,680
Do it in Chennai.
- Correct..

726
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
The climate there is neither
too hot nor cold.

727
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,520
There won't be floods and
it's free from mosquitoes.

728
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,680
True. - There won't be
terrorist attacks.

729
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,240
Correct. - Yes.
- It's a cool place.

730
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
Yes.

731
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,640
Okay.
It is Chennai, then.

732
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,480
Shoba.

733
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,960
Shoba.

734
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,440
Where is she?
Shoba.

735
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,200
Shoba?

736
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,240
What are you doing here?

737
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,600
Everyone is waiting
for you

738
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,920
and you are chopping
vegetables here!

739
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,120
Hey. Is there a problem between
you and Dinesh?

740
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,760
Only he knows what the problem is.
How would I know?

741
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,960
Do you know what's
the biggest mistake I have made?

742
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,760
I texted him, 'Miss you.'

743
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,200
Why would he pack his bags
and come here!

744
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,960
That moron with him is the reason
for everything.

745
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Who?

746
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,160
Sagar.

747
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,560
"Oh, girl..
Come with me."

748
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,240
"Oh, girl.."

749
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:04,280
'Should I do it?
- What..'

750
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,880
"Oh, girl.."

751
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,480
What is the problem now?

752
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,840
Miss you.. Love you..
Like you.. Need you..

753
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,400
Women say that to every
Tom, Dick and Harry! - They do.

754
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,240
I came here for her and..
- And?

755
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,600
S-She treated me like trash.
She did.

756
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,640
I postponed all my engagements
to come here.

757
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
My mother is alone there.

758
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,840
Don't you remember the day
we first met her?

759
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,120
Those were the best
days of my life.

760
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,680
"I am coming to you,
my city."

761
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:19,360
"I am spreading my wings
in your roads."

762
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,320
"There are new dreams"

763
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,600
"in my eyes because of you."

764
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,840
"My life
is entwined with happiness."

765
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:49,560
"I came here
in search of her."

766
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:58,120
"You are the woman
of my dreams.."

767
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,480
"You are the woman
of my dreams! You are."

768
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,960
"You are the woman
of my dreams.."

769
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,160
"You are the woman
of my dreams!

770
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,320
"Oh, beloved.."

771
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,400
"When I can't take
my eyes off you.."

772
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,080
"When your beauty bewitches me.."

773
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:29,040
"We gave life to this precious
friendship and let's cherish it."

774
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,840
"These streets adorned
by twilight.."

775
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,360
"These shores that
are illuminated by moonlight.."

776
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,560
Yes!

777
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,320
Dinesh, you are so careless.

778
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,320
Shouldn't you have locked
the door before going out?

779
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,680
What if some other thief
had got in instead of me!

780
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,680
It's such a poor lodge, Dinesh.

781
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,960
It's too hot and there are
too many mosquitoes.

782
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,520
Let it be. Look what I have
brought for you!

783
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,320
Jackfruit, coconuts
and..

784
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,040
Where is it?
Tapioca!

785
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,600
Why don't you seem happy?

786
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,840
What is your plan?

787
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,560
Nothing. It's so boring without you
at our hometown, Dinesh.

788
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,520
You are having a great time
here, aren't you?

789
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,440
Way too many girls and photos.
I know everything.

790
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,160
Will you set me up with
Shoba's friend, Priya?

791
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,040
Shut up!

792
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,680
"You are the woman
of my dreams!"

793
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,680
"You are the woman
of my dreams! You are.."

794
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:57,720
"You are the woman
of my dreams.."

795
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,280
"You are the woman
of my dreams!"

796
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,840
"You are the woman.."

797
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,080
That's enough.

798
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,840
Please eat.
- I will.

799
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,760
So, how do you guys
like Chennai?

800
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,040
Cool.
- It's hot.

801
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,160
I felt so.
It is really hot. - Oh.

802
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,920
Is that why you are
wearing sunglasses?

803
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,040
It's just..
Get rid of them.

804
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,520
Funny guy.

805
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,720
Chennai is more expensive
than we thought.

806
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,920
Actually, since there
are two of you

807
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,280
you guys can share the rent.
- Yes.

808
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,920
Really?
He is broke.

809
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,000
All he does is eat.
Poor chap! Am I not right?

810
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,880
Shoba, since he lacks common sense

811
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,040
he utters nonsense
all the time.

812
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,040
So, his mother insisted that
he should stay with me.

813
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,520
He has learnt a bit from me.
Am I not right?

814
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,320
Let it be.
How is your MBA coming along?

815
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,960
It's not over. There is still a
lot to tell you. It's so funny.

816
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,120
Tell them one of your jokes.

817
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,280
Let them laugh.

818
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,040
Weren't you asking about
the MBA, Priya?

819
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,840
You know, my childhood dream
was to become a pilot.

820
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,000
My dad wanted me to be
a doctor.

821
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,240
When I grew up

822
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,440
pilots and doctors
lost their value.

823
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,480
I thought of pursuing an MBA
at College of Engineering.

824
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,800
Yes, that's how it is.

825
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,680
What's the full form of MBA?
- What?

826
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,400
Don't eat until you
say it.

827
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,120
He is joking.. Please eat.
- No..

828
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,080
Stop eating until he says
the full form of MBA. - Relax..

829
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,720
Relax, my foot.
- Don't be crazy. Please eat.

830
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,400
Forget MBA. - Please eat.
- You wanted to be a doctor, right?

831
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,880
You have to clear the entrance
exams to be a doctor, moron!

832
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,840
Relax, Sagar.

833
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
He has flunked exams

834
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,720
even after getting the question
paper on the previous day! - No..

835
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,600
He can't even make a paper
aeroplane. - Funny guy!

836
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,520
Pilot, my foot!

837
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,120
Dinesh, you are way too
pompous when you are with girls.

838
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,360
I have noticed it since
fifth grade. - Relax.

839
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,080
Priya's cake is here.
- To heck with the cake!

840
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,960
I can't be patient anymore!

841
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,320
I am a roughneck when I have to be!
- You are one!

842
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,000
I won't spare you!
- I will..

843
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,960
Stop it.
- You..

844
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,040
Listen..
- Let me speak, Venkat.

845
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,520
Why all this..
Who are they, Shoba?

846
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,960
How could you let such reprobates
be a part of our gang?

847
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,680
He spoiled her birthday.

848
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,120
Is he an IIT alumnus, a writer
or an orator? Who is he?

849
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,920
That's not important right now.

850
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,160
Look at him staring at us.

851
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,400
Such a disgrace.

852
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,840
I warned you earlier.

853
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,520
Okay. Now stop it.
Don't irritate me.

854
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,120
Wait. Let me go
and talk to him.

855
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,720
Shoba, it was accidental..
- See, it is not that funny.

856
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,160
Yes.
- We are in a public place.

857
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,400
The two of you don't even
have basic etiquette.

858
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,880
Aren't you guys ashamed?

859
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,320
You spoiled it, Dinesh.

860
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,040
Forget it.

861
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,960
Get a life.
- Yes.

862
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,760
You too.
- Why me?

863
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,280
Thank you.

864
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,040
The audacity to say it!

865
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,520
What?

866
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,360
Even if I hadn't,
Swathi would have told her

867
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,760
that you aren't pursuing an MBA.

868
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,720
A man could never
read a woman's mind

869
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,880
but I can do it.

870
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,800
It's true.
Because you aren't a man.

871
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,120
Mr. Dinesh

872
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,160
if you stop cracking stupid jokes
and take life seriously

873
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,560
the rest of your life
will be good.

874
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,680
Both she and her gang
mocked me today.

875
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,320
I will make them praise me.
- Whatever.

876
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,680
I am thinking of dropping
this romantic plan.

877
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,280
I am just going to work
on some swag moves, man.

878
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,200
Come on!

879
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,200
Ma'am.
- Yes. - Someone from Kerala

880
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,040
has made a donation
to our child welfare program.

881
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,000
Really?

882
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,400
Where is he now?
- He is waiting outside, ma'am.

883
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,040
"To alleviate the sorrows
of children.."

884
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,960
Do you work here, Shoba?
We never knew.

885
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,360
What's your plan?
- What plan?

886
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,200
Let's paint it green.
- Helping the poor.

887
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,080
We have always done charity.
- I see.

888
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,640
What is it?
- Yes, Dinesh?

889
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,440
Oh.. Hi, Shoba.

890
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,720
Let's leave. We have
too many places to visit.

891
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,160
I know..
- I am waiting.

892
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,880
He is such a nice guy.

893
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,080
The signatures are different
on both the cheques.

894
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,720
Ask your friend to have
a proper signature first.

895
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,800
Save your charity until then.

896
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,000
The problems of
being undereducated..

897
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,040
That's enough.
Give it..

898
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,720
For the sake of our friendship

899
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,880
can you do me a small favour?

900
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,040
What?

901
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,640
How can I woo Shoba?

902
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,520
I thought so.

903
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,440
She likes you too.
- Really? - Yes.

904
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Oh.

905
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,240
But to make Shoba
fall for you

906
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,560
you should first make
my wife fall for you.

907
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,720
H-How can I do that
to your wife.. - Oh, no.

908
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,920
That's not what I meant.

909
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,520
After Priya's birthday party

910
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,000
it was my wife
who criticised you the most. - Oh.

911
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,720
If you impress her first,
it'd be duck soup to woo Shoba.

912
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,840
What?
- It means easy..

913
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,760
Okay.
Tell me how I can do it, pal.

914
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,720
There is something that
she likes more than me.

915
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,560
What is it?

916
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,840
Eat it, dear.
- Hey, Dinesh.

917
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,760
Kala!
What a pleasant surprise!

918
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,120
Do you like dogs?
- I love them.

919
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,320
Lolu, Monu and Sonu.
Three dogs..

920
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,320
Oh! Okay.
- I have brought food.

921
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,920
Do you want some?
- I love dogs too. - Really?

922
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,280
This is Husky.
- Wow!

923
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,680
Hey, Husky.

924
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,240
Vismaya..

925
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,880
Hey, Vismaya. Come here.
- I will be right back.

926
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,360
When will this end?

927
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,560
What is happening there?

928
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,600
They are moving
into that home.

929
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,880
They will be here henceforth.

930
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,960
Really?

931
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,720
Okay, guys.

932
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,600
Thank you so much
for a wonderful meal.

933
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,280
Thank you.
- Guys, tomorrow is Sunday.

934
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,160
Diwali. It's the first Diwali
after our wedding.

935
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,800
Oh! - So, please..
All of you must come.

936
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,120
Both of you must come.

937
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,440
And let's celebrate.

938
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,120
Let's celebrate.
- All right, let's disperse now.

939
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,240
Let's go..
- Thank you.

940
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,720
Thank you.. - Thank you.
- Bye.

941
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,960
Thank you so much..

942
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,240
Okay.

943
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,600
Bye.
- Bye, girls.

944
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,360
Yes.

945
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,440
Just listen to me!

946
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,240
Mom, call her tomorrow
at 10 a.m. sharp.

947
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,320
Okay?

948
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,560
What's it, pal?

949
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,880
You're making new plans.

950
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,040
Your charity plan failed.

951
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,720
But you managed
the situation

952
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,280
by getting dishes
from the restaurant.

953
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,080
Yes. - Since you're
almost close to your goal

954
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,560
shall we try
to accomplish my goals?

955
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,920
What goals?

956
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,480
Can you set me up with
Shoba's friend, Priya?

957
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,360
Then we can live
like a family.

958
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,640
Drat!

959
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,840
Bloody flirt!

960
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,640
'Dear, don't say anything.'

961
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,840
'I'll talk.'

962
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,480
'Just give me
your father's phone number.'

963
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,440
'Okay, dear.'

964
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,560
'All right, then..'

965
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,600
Sure, ma'am.

966
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,120
Okay.

967
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,920
Who was it?

968
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,560
Dinesh's mother.

969
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,160
Dinesh's mother?

970
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,120
What does she want?

971
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,120
She asked for
my dad's contact number.

972
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,200
What for?

973
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,200
You didn't get it?

974
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,640
Yes.

975
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,840
Really?

976
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,320
Really, pal.

977
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,640
Wedding proposal.

978
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,360
Wedding proposal!

979
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,680
Don't think too much.

980
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,880
Both of you look
great together.

981
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,240
He looks amazing.

982
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,400
Please accept the proposal.

983
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,040
He is wealthy.

984
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,640
He cooks very well.

985
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,440
He will take good care
of you.

986
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,040
Get settled, Shoba.

987
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,480
Shall I go and give
this 'Payasam' to Dinesh?

988
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,400
What! Why?
That's not needed.

989
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,320
Just a minute.

990
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,880
Yesterday, we had
amazing food at his house.

991
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,520
Go and give it.
- Okay.

992
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,880
What is it?
- Nothing.

993
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,680
Did you send the phone number?

994
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,160
Drat!
No.

995
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,720
Oh!

996
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,200
What about its peel?

997
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
That's how it is.

998
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,320
Are you trying
to cheat me?

999
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,040
I'm not that kind of a guy.
- What?

1000
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,600
Then pack this.

1001
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,120
White carrot.

1002
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,160
Mr. Dinesh.
- Yes.

1003
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,400
How are you? - Are you going
to cook today as well?

1004
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,400
Cooking is my passion.
- Yes.

1005
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,680
Here is some 'Payasam'.

1006
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,600
'Payasam!' - Homemade.
- Homemade!

1007
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,600
Also, your trick was a success.
- Let me drink it.

1008
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,760
Your mother called
her this morning.

1009
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,360
Really?
- The discussion is going on.

1010
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,360
I came here
in the middle of the conversation.

1011
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,520
Why?

1012
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,080
Did she give her
the contact number?

1013
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,440
I don't know that, sir.

1014
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,280
Anyway, come to Ms. Kala's house

1015
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,200
for the Diwali celebration.

1016
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,440
Okay. - Have you seen Ms. Shoba
make a Rangoli?

1017
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,280
No.
- No, right?

1018
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,600
It's amazing.

1019
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,480
So, come without fail.
- Okay.

1020
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,800
Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

1021
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,600
You've moved here from
your hometown just to flirt.

1022
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,760
Hey, get lost.

1023
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,120
"Lighted beautiful wicks"

1024
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,440
"are adding to the ambience"

1025
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,640
"and are looking amazing."

1026
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,480
"What is making you"

1027
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,120
"close your eyes and pray?"

1028
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,400
"A lot of smiles"

1029
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,640
"are getting added"

1030
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,680
"to the ambience
of this house."

1031
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,920
"Whose presence is making"

1032
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,120
"those beautiful lamps smile?"

1033
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,200
"The alluring flame"

1034
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,880
"is dancing"

1035
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,840
"in the evening bliss."

1036
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,400
"Stars are twinkling"

1037
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,840
"even in the presence"

1038
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,760
"of a slight fragrant breeze."

1039
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,240
"Oh, magical dreams"

1040
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,720
"joining my soul!"

1041
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,440
"Do you feel like flying?"

1042
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,520
"A few"

1043
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,040
"beautiful moments.."

1044
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,880
"Who brought them?"

1045
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,880
"Lighted beautiful wicks"

1046
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,120
"are adding to the ambience"

1047
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,200
"and are looking amazing."

1048
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,200
"What is making you"

1049
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,440
"close your eyes and pray?"

1050
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,280
"A lot of smiles
are adding"

1051
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,480
"to the ambience
of this house."

1052
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,360
"Whose presence is making"

1053
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,800
"those beautiful lamps smile?"

1054
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,880
Hi, Shoba.

1055
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,960
It didn't rain, right?

1056
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,600
That's because
this is Chennai.

1057
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,760
It would have rained
if we were in Kerala.

1058
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,520
Mother called me
this morning.

1059
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,040
Really?
Whose mother?

1060
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
Dinesh's mother.

1061
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,640
My mother!
Why?

1062
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,680
She wanted
my dad's contact number.

1063
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,480
She said that she saw me at
the wedding and she likes me.

1064
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,680
I can't believe mom.

1065
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,440
My mom is immature, Shoba.

1066
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,040
Also, she has the disadvantage

1067
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,720
of being born
in a rural place.

1068
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm really sorry for that.

1069
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,440
Shoba, actually I can't even
imagine marrying someone

1070
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,760
without knowing and socialising
with that person.

1071
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,160
So, I'm really sorry.

1072
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,720
I didn't give her
my father's contact number.

1073
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,160
Why?

1074
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,040
Do you want me to give it?
- I-It's up to you.

1075
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,120
As you said

1076
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,080
even I can't think
about marrying a person

1077
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,160
without knowing
the person well.

1078
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,960
See you.
- Shoba.

1079
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,720
Are you free tomorrow?

1080
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,760
What is it, Dinesh?

1081
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,960
Let's have breakfast
at Saravana Bhavan.

1082
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,320
Then let's go to Sathyam
Theatre in the afternoon. - Oh.

1083
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Tomorrow I'm not free.

1084
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,200
Well, even I'm not free
tomorrow.

1085
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,360
I just recalled it
when you said that.

1086
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,080
What about the day after tomorrow?
- You're free, right?

1087
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,240
Tomorrow, I'll get drunk,
sleep and then..

1088
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,520
Okay, I'm free
day after tomorrow.

1089
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,960
Okay.
- Okay.

1090
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,600
"Is it like the Rangoli design"

1091
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,920
"that you make?"

1092
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,800
"Is it like the Rangoli design"

1093
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,080
"that you make?"

1094
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,360
"Tell me, oh, Moonlight."

1095
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,880
"The aroma that spreads"

1096
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,480
"when you apply
sandalwood paste on you"

1097
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,480
"bewitches me."

1098
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,200
"Oh, Time, please don't move
so fast."

1099
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,720
"Please stop for us."

1100
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:33,040
"Let happiness
take control of me."

1101
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,440
"You are giving me"

1102
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,880
"nights that are
more delightful than the day."

1103
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,520
"I don't want to lose this
in this lifetime."

1104
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,960
"Someone whispered
in my ear.."

1105
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,080
This is my mother
and this is my father.

1106
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,880
They were not together
for long.

1107
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,920
And I was not old enough to ask
and understand their problems.

1108
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,880
They separated.

1109
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,160
Then, almost after a year,
my mother passed away.

1110
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,160
It's been just dad and me
since then.

1111
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,560
Yes, this is Priya.

1112
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,280
My father's
close friend's daughter.

1113
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,960
We were in the same school,
college and hostel.

1114
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,520
Priya had a relationship.

1115
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,720
But they also ended their bond
a year after their wedding.

1116
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,240
They loved each other
a lot before getting married.

1117
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,880
But everything ended
once they got married.

1118
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,280
Since then, I'm a bit afraid
of the concept of marriage.

1119
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,640
Dinesh, I really like you.

1120
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,800
Even the small things
that you do

1121
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,320
give me a lot of happiness.

1122
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,240
I'm the happiest
when I'm next to you.

1123
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,800
I don't know
how to take this forward.

1124
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,080
Well, Shoba,
by saying I like you..

1125
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,400
Don't you know that I haven't
considered you in that sense?

1126
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,520
I can assure you one thing.

1127
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,080
My ancestors have made
enough money

1128
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,960
for me to take good care of you.

1129
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,040
So, I don't need to work.

1130
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,720
I'll always be there with you

1131
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,320
in our house.

1132
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,760
To support you
and care you.

1133
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,120
I'll always have time for you.

1134
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,040
Let me ask you
a casual question.

1135
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,720
Don't misunderstand me.
- I won't.

1136
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,800
How are you always able
to think along such lines?

1137
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,440
That's how I am.
- Really? - Yes.

1138
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,320
Okay, come.

1139
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,240
This generation faces
a lot of relationship issues.

1140
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,800
Verbal and physical abuse.

1141
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,760
Communication issues.

1142
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,880
Infidelity.
Unnecessary arguments.

1143
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,960
But none of them
is the major issue, Dinesh.

1144
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,480
Drugs and alcohol.

1145
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,200
Drinking and smoking
must be banned.

1146
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,640
I swear.

1147
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,280
You're correct, Shoba.

1148
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,800
'Wear helmets while
driving motorcycles.'

1149
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,760
So..

1150
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,800
So?

1151
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,240
Are you happy?

1152
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,560
Indeed.

1153
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,640
But you look upset.

1154
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,560
Didn't you like
what I said?

1155
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,720
No! I loved
everything that you said.

1156
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,280
As you said, the problems faced
by the present generation

1157
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,200
such as alcohol and
drug addiction is severe.

1158
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,200
I'm going to get addicted
to life, Shoba.

1159
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,600
As you said, I'll cut down
on alcohol for sure.

1160
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,440
That is not enough.

1161
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,080
Yes, I must quit.

1162
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,720
I must quit all the bad habits.

1163
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,560
I quit once in a while.
So it'd be easy for me.

1164
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,600
Shall I go?
Goodnight.

1165
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,960
Goodnight.

1166
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,400
Drat!

1167
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,840
"I want to feel you.."
- Something is wrong.

1168
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,720
Oh, no! Alcohol.

1169
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,920
Addiction. No.

1170
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,480
How did he arrange
these lights?

1171
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,400
You're shocked, right?

1172
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,840
We're going to celebrate

1173
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,960
your success this evening.

1174
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,800
I splashed the cash and
bought all these expensive items.

1175
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,240
What's your opinion
about this set-up?

1176
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,320
Nice.

1177
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,480
But I won't drink

1178
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,720
and I won't let you
drink either.

1179
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,680
What?

1180
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,000
I understood that you
don't want to drink.

1181
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,240
But I didn't understand
why you're stopping me.

1182
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,280
You didn't understand?

1183
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,920
That means no one will drink
alcohol in this house hereafter.

1184
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,360
Oh.

1185
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,560
That's her order, right?
- Well..

1186
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,520
Let's drink for one last time.
She won't find out.

1187
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,000
No, I promised her.
I never break my promise.

1188
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,280
I'll drink.

1189
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,360
I won't drink
and I won't let you drink.

1190
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,160
I won't let it happen..

1191
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,200
Stop that and come here.

1192
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,560
Okay, tell me..

1193
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,520
I want to know
all the details.

1194
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,640
What did you guys do?
Where did you guys go?

1195
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,280
What did you guys talk?
Please tell me..

1196
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,560
Oh!

1197
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,920
Are you feeling shy?

1198
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,720
Really.
Well

1199
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,440
did you tell him
your demands?

1200
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,640
Yes..

1201
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,120
What did he say?

1202
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,000
He agreed to it
and left.

1203
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,200
Only God knows
what is going to happen.

1204
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,720
I won't let that happen..

1205
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,280
You shouldn't, Dinesh.

1206
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,520
Even banks don't put forth these
many conditions to issue a loan.

1207
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,840
What else did she say?

1208
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,720
'I like you'?

1209
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,320
I didn't understand
its exact meaning. - I..

1210
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,440
Okay, call him up.

1211
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,200
Let's listen to
what he has to say.

1212
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,240
Shall we?
- Yes.

1213
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,600
I slow down to..

1214
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,160
Oh, no!

1215
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,400
It's Shoba..
Stop the music.

1216
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,480
Shoba.

1217
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,240
Dinesh, were you sleeping?

1218
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,360
No, I was watching television.

1219
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,840
What are you going to do next?

1220
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,720
Bath, eat and sleep.

1221
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,400
What!
- I mean

1222
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,560
bath, eat and sleep.

1223
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,840
I just called casually.

1224
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,360
I'm also going to sleep as I have
to leave early tomorrow.

1225
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,880
Okay.. See you..
Bye.. Goodnight.

1226
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,440
Do you want some?

1227
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,840
What did he say?

1228
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,080
Nothing.
He is at home.

1229
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,200
Let's go.

1230
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,680
Play the music.

1231
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,080
"On the floor, baby."

1232
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,720
"Hit it hard, baby."

1233
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,240
"Rock the party, baby."

1234
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,800
"Get lost if you can't."

1235
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,040
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

1236
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,680
"Rock the party, baby."

1237
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,240
"Get lost if you can't."

1238
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,920
"When I see you standing
on the veranda or the doorstep"

1239
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,400
"I go crazy."

1240
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,200
"I go crazy."

1241
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,000
"I kept her close to me
just like how women"

1242
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,800
"used to save money
and keep it close to them"

1243
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,840
"but someone tricked me
and took her away from me."

1244
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,120
"Stole her from me.."

1245
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,880
"On the floor, baby."

1246
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,400
"Hit it hard, baby."

1247
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,120
"Rock the party, baby."

1248
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,760
"Get lost if you can't."

1249
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,280
"On the floor, baby."

1250
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,920
"Hit it hard, baby."

1251
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,440
"Rock the party, baby."

1252
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,040
"Get lost if you can't."

1253
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,640
"On the floor, baby."

1254
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,320
"Hit it hard, baby."

1255
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,840
"Rock the party, baby."

1256
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,560
"Get lost if you can't."

1257
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,840
Don't make me
recall all that.

1258
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,160
That makes me feel shy.

1259
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,360
Hey..

1260
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,960
I would never have had
a relationship with you

1261
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,200
even if what they assumed
was true.

1262
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,480
What do I lack, Dinesh?

1263
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,840
Does that even matter now?
- No.

1264
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,880
Is that her?
- Who?

1265
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,320
Oh!
She..

1266
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,520
It's you.

1267
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,320
Where were you?

1268
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,160
I'm late as I couldn't get
the parcel on time.

1269
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,080
'I come in peace..'

1270
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,240
Women of this generation
don't value anyone.

1271
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,080
Even ten-year-old
relationships end

1272
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,320
when they get married
and spend a few days together.

1273
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,520
They will love each other
for the first six months.

1274
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,400
Then they forget the reason
why they loved each other.

1275
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,200
How can we marry
anyone in this era?

1276
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
Is there any guarantee
that women won't betray us?

1277
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,480
We have to be very careful.

1278
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,520
We must be careful, Sagar.

1279
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,960
But you have been
very careless, Dinesh.

1280
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,640
When my father used
to fight with my mother

1281
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,720
he used to say

1282
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,760
that my mother and I

1283
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,640
are his two mistakes.

1284
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,920
Oh! Poor man.

1285
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,520
Tell me something, Dinesh.

1286
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,120
You fell in love with her.

1287
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,720
But what made her fall in love
with you?

1288
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,480
Because I'm rich..

1289
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,240
Every wealthy fool

1290
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,720
has girls around him.
- Exactly. - Exactly.

1291
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,040
Dinesh

1292
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,560
do you know
that the lives of many great people

1293
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,920
got ruined
because of women?

1294
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,960
Even wars happened
because of them.

1295
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,360
Really?
- Just imagine

1296
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,080
a world where
only men existed.

1297
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,040
We'll enjoy.

1298
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,080
Mr. Sagar.

1299
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,880
Just because
they are born as women

1300
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,200
they are not allowed
to fulfil their dreams

1301
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,480
and ambitions.

1302
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,840
While they grow up,
they face eve-teasing

1303
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,920
by foolish men
and they have to endure it.

1304
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,480
They are forced
to get married to fools like you

1305
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,680
because of their parents.

1306
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,680
Women are forced to obey men.

1307
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,760
They carry babies
for nine months.

1308
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,920
They experience pain
and give birth to a baby.

1309
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,280
They raise the baby
but they get rebuked

1310
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,880
even by their kids.

1311
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,960
Women are unlucky
and divine.

1312
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,480
Give that to me.

1313
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,960
Thanks.
- Shinoj.

1314
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,080
Calm down.

1315
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,360
You are just a driver.

1316
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,200
But we never treated you
like that.

1317
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,000
But you're just a driver.

1318
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,880
How dare you
drink our alcohol

1319
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,440
and lecture us?

1320
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,560
Get lost.

1321
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,960
Get lost.
- One more.

1322
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,960
Just one more shot..
- Get out.

1323
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,800
How dare he lecture us!
- Hey..

1324
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,840
Don't force me to react.
- Hey..

1325
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,680
He was right.

1326
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,560
Get lost. - You shouldn't have
kicked him out.

1327
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,680
What were we discussing?
- Yes.. Shoba.

1328
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,960
Shoba.
- Shoba.

1329
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,920
Nonsense.
- Only her name is good.

1330
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,320
Yes.
- She is a bad person.

1331
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,240
Exactly.
- She is arrogant

1332
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,760
as she is beautiful
and educated.

1333
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,480
She considers herself
to be the most beautiful woman.

1334
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,280
It's all make-up.
- Really?

1335
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,000
The beauty that she got
by using tons of cosmetics..

1336
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,280
We can also become handsome
if we apply it.

1337
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,160
Really?
- As for education..

1338
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,240
She has no common sense.

1339
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,960
Can she write at least two words
in her mother tongue, Malayalam?

1340
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,200
Can she? - Her English,
poems and proverbs.

1341
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,960
English, my foot!
Drat!

1342
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:35,360
Her conditions
make me really angry.

1343
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,200
If I get hold of her right now..

1344
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,440
What will you do?

1345
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,400
I'll slap her.

1346
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,960
Dinesh, do you really want her?

1347
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,280
Not at all..

1348
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,960
You moron!
He doesn't want you.

1349
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,960
Didn't you hear it?

1350
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,480
If you ever trouble him
saying that you love him

1351
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,200
I won't spare you.

1352
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,600
Do you hear me?

1353
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,520
Are you listening?

1354
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,280
There might be many people
who obey you.

1355
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,960
Keep your foolish conditions
to yourself!

1356
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,960
I'll get my friend
married to a woman

1357
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,400
who has no demands at all.

1358
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,720
I'm losing my temper.

1359
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Hang up.

1360
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,200
I taught her a lesson..

1361
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,680
Who was that?
- It was her.

1362
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,640
Who?

1363
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,960
Shoba.

1364
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,440
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

1365
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,600
"Rock the party, baby.
Get lost if you can't."

1366
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,760
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

1367
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,080
"Rock the party, baby.
Get lost if you can't."

1368
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,160
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

1369
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,440
"Rock the party, baby.
Get lost if you can't."

1370
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,840
'Sir.
- Shanmukham.'

1371
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,920
'I gave a letter stating that'

1372
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,960
'I've no complaints
against you.'

1373
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,080
'I got to know that.'

1374
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,320
'In the end,
none of us got her, right?'

1375
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,320
'Mister, someone is surely
waiting for us somewhere.'

1376
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
'There was Sonia Gandhi
from Italy'

1377
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,160
'to become the wife
of an Indian, Rajiv Gandhi.'

1378
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,680
'There was Ms. Usha
from Burma who became the wife'

1379
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,160
'of ex-President K R Narayanan,
a Keralite.'

1380
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,440
'Not just that.
Mohanlal got married'

1381
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,120
'to Suchitra,
who is from Tamil Nadu.'

1382
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,400
'Likewise,
there might be someone'

1383
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,000
'waiting for us somewhere.'

1384
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,400
'One day, we will meet..'

1385
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,760
Actually, you did a good thing.

1386
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,400
I was waiting to say
all of this to her someday.

1387
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,480
She might have understood
that I can live without her.

1388
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,320
Shall I call her up?

1389
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,200
If you can live without her,
why do you want to call her?

1390
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,920
Well, we must know her
current state of mind, right?

1391
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,240
Call anyone you want.

1392
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,720
Do as you wish.

1393
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,920
But please spare me.

1394
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,600
What do you want?

1395
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,080
You said everything
that you wanted to, right?

1396
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,120
Now, listen to me.

1397
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,480
I hate you, Dinesh.

1398
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,000
That's enough.
Tell me and let's end it.

1399
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,600
'Shoba.'

1400
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,280
D-Dad!
- 'Where are you, dear?'

1401
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,520
A-At Priya's house.

1402
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,680
'When are you coming here?'

1403
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,080
I'll come, Dad.

1404
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,360
'Did you eat?'
- Yes.

1405
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,880
'Is there a problem?'

1406
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,720
No, nothing as such, Dad.

1407
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,480
'Discuss and sort it out,
no matter what it is.'

1408
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,280
Okay, Dad.

1409
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,840
'Come fast, dear.'
- Okay.

1410
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,080
Okay.

1411
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
Hey, what happened?

1412
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,040
I ruined it. I blabbered
some nonsense to my dad

1413
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,280
thinking that
it was Dinesh.

1414
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,040
What are you saying?

1415
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,800
I think my dad understood
that there is a problem

1416
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,040
between Dinesh and me.

1417
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,960
Are you guys playing the fool?

1418
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,240
You guys understand
each other so well.

1419
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,320
Why can't you both
give in?

1420
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,640
I'm quite serious.

1421
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,560
This is just ego.

1422
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,000
Relationships are
all about happiness.

1423
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,440
But I've never seen you both
be happy together.

1424
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,600
What's the point then?

1425
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,840
Okay, give me
your phone.

1426
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,960
Let me talk to Dinesh.

1427
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,240
Well, I just mentioned him.
And he is calling up.

1428
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,360
Hello, Dinesh.

1429
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,440
After everything that happened,
I don't think

1430
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:43,520
we should waste time by calling
each other unnecessarily.

1431
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,320
I just called you
to know your decision.

1432
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,040
What's your decision?

1433
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,240
What!

1434
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,320
Dinesh, I'm Priya.

1435
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,080
Priya, give the phone
to Shoba.

1436
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,640
Listen to me first.

1437
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,200
What do you think
about women, Dinesh?

1438
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,880
If you can't even
respect a woman

1439
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,680
then why do you guys need
relationships and love?

1440
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,320
She told you her conditions

1441
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,280
but you didn't even care
about them.

1442
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,760
What do you think
of yourself?

1443
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,960
Do you consider yourself
a great guy?

1444
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,560
What!

1445
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,680
Nonsense.
How dare you!

1446
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,760
You..

1447
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:27,960
Priya.

1448
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,360
Hang up!

1449
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,640
Priya is so silly.

1450
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,840
Where did you find him?

1451
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,200
He is so annoying!

1452
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,920
Oh, God!

1453
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,040
Well, let me ask you something.

1454
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,240
Do you really want her or not?

1455
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,080
I..
- You don't want her?

1456
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,640
I want her.

1457
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,560
So, you want to be with her.

1458
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,960
Yes.

1459
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,800
You blamed her so much

1460
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,720
and now, you want her, right?

1461
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,560
She brought so many changes
in your life.

1462
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:15,880
Actually

1463
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,240
those were the best days

1464
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,600
of your life.

1465
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,960
Bye..
S-Shoba..

1466
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,760
He insisted last night.
That's why I..

1467
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,840
Will you do anything
if he insists?

1468
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,200
He insists only about this.

1469
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,400
Who is your priority,
him or me?

1470
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,040
You're my priority.
He is my second priority.

1471
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,480
So, you want him too, right?

1472
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,080
Actually, what bond
do you guys share?

1473
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,480
Bond!
What bond?

1474
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,200
You might not have anything
as such on your mind.

1475
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,600
But I seriously doubt that guy.

1476
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,120
Forget it.
Just be careful.

1477
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,280
What do you mean?

1478
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,280
You'll understand soon.

1479
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,040
My dad is coming.

1480
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,360
Tomorrow, you must accompany me
to the airport.

1481
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,960
Really? Wow.
When is that guy coming?

1482
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,160
Guy?
- No, I mean, your father.

1483
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,920
6:30 a.m. sharp.

1484
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,960
5:30 a.m. sharp.
- Uncle, the bottle.

1485
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,960
Uncle?

1486
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,240
I don't know why

1487
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,040
but people
always doubt me

1488
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,560
when I say
that I'm her dad.

1489
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,880
Do you have
any such doubt?

1490
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,200
Yes.
- Hey!

1491
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,280
What's wrong with you, Dad?

1492
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,240
What nonsense
are you saying?

1493
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,360
Shoba, it's all right.

1494
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,280
He is
my would-be son-in-law.

1495
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:04,000
Okay, you guys keep talking.
I'll be right back.

1496
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,160
Dinesh, tell me.

1497
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,320
How are you, sir?

1498
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,360
I'm fine.

1499
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,400
What else?
Is it raining in your hometown?

1500
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,720
Wait. I'll ask someone
and tell you. - No..

1501
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,800
It was just a general question.

1502
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,720
I don't know
such things, sir.

1503
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,560
I'm always busy travelling
with regard to my business.

1504
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,160
America to Japan.
Japan to Delhi.

1505
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,160
Delhi to America.

1506
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,360
Delhi?
Where in Delhi?

1507
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,280
You live in Delhi, right?
- Yes.

1508
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,640
I go from Delhi to Chennai
as soon as I land in Delhi.

1509
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,640
Going to Delhi
is just a transit trip.

1510
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,720
You run a stock..
- Yes..

1511
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,520
Basically, I'm a stockist, sir.

1512
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,040
But not an ordinary one.

1513
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,440
I play brilliantly by learning

1514
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,400
and understanding
the business.

1515
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,840
I'm an internationally
acclaimed expert

1516
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,800
I invest lakhs of rupees
and earn crores in return.

1517
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,520
Let me tell you something.

1518
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,760
The daily turnover
of the company

1519
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,280
in which I have invested is around
Rs. 25 Crores to 30 Crores.

1520
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,400
Which company?

1521
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,120
Well.. Glenfiddich.

1522
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:11,080
It's a
Scottish airline company.

1523
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,600
Oh..

1524
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,160
I'll be free by this evening.
- Okay.

1525
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,720
Shall we meet?
- Okay.

1526
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,560
Do you drink?

1527
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,160
What do you mean, sir?

1528
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,680
Well, do you drink alcohol?

1529
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,920
Alcohol.
Only if someone insists..

1530
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,640
I drink occasionally.
Just 30 or 60 millilitres.

1531
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,120
I insist.

1532
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,840
I could use some company.

1533
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,320
She..
- She won't find out.

1534
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,440
I'll call you
this evening.

1535
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,400
Okay, sir.

1536
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,000
Dinesh, we will leave.

1537
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
Dad, shall we leave?

1538
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,760
Yes. - I'll drop you
on the way.

1539
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,160
Okay?
- Okay.

1540
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,160
Okay, Dinesh.
See you. - Okay, sir.

1541
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,920
Okay, see you.

1542
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,360
Okay.

1543
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,680
Cheers!

1544
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,720
Cheers!

1545
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,400
Sir, let me tell you something.

1546
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,600
I never touched this poison

1547
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,560
until I was 15.

1548
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,240
Swathi.

1549
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,120
I loved her so much, sir.

1550
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,640
She betrayed me.

1551
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,120
Who is Swathi?

1552
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,280
Don't you know her?

1553
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,120
Your daughter's friend, Swathi.

1554
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,040
I met Shoba
at Swathi's wedding.

1555
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,200
Will you say that you
don't know Shoba as well?

1556
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,320
Will you say that?

1557
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,960
It's Sagar, my friend..

1558
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,560
He comes to me
shamelessly no matter where I'm.

1559
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,960
Where were you?
- Hello.

1560
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,400
Shall we leave?

1561
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,400
You like whisky, right?

1562
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,000
Waiter.
- Yes. What is it, sir?

1563
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,480
Get him a shot of whisky.
- Sorry, sir.

1564
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,360
It is out of stock.
We will have it tomorrow.

1565
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,520
Is it out of stock?
Go..

1566
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,080
I'll give you a gift
before you leave.

1567
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,640
I'll also give you a gift.

1568
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,600
Wow!

1569
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,200
If you don't want
to drink brandy

1570
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,320
then I'm taking it.

1571
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,480
Amazing.

1572
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,680
The way you're looking at me
is making me feel uncomfortable.

1573
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,720
Come, let's go.

1574
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,520
I'm feeling sleepy.

1575
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:44,960
Oh, no!

1576
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,360
I said what I had to.

1577
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,360
What quality
did you find in him?

1578
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,280
I'm just curious to know.

1579
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,240
Dad, he will take good care
of me.

1580
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,880
That's enough for you, right?

1581
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,600
Go without any worries.

1582
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,960
I'll transform him.

1583
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,560
Fine.

1584
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,680
I don't have a long life ahead.

1585
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,960
So, I won't have
to witness much.

1586
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,240
That's the only thought
which gives me peace.

1587
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,760
Be careful, dear.

1588
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,840
Okay.

1589
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,040
Oh, no!

1590
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,960
Drat!
Did he leave?

1591
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,960
He could've waited
for a bit, right?

1592
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,440
Shoba.

1593
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,320
Shoba, walk slowly.

1594
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,600
Your dad is different
from what I expected.

1595
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:44,720
You're like your mother, right?

1596
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,400
Next, both of us will go
and meet him at his place.

1597
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,360
That will make him happy.
- Not necessary.

1598
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,680
He hates you.

1599
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,240
Last night, you got drunk
and said some nonsense, right?

1600
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,240
You fool..

1601
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,320
What are you saying, Shoba?

1602
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,680
I don't understand.
When did I drink?

1603
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,880
Don't act innocent.

1604
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,440
It's evident.

1605
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,480
When he insisted, I drank
a bit to keep him company.

1606
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,880
Your father drank a lot.
Do you know he is a drunkard?

1607
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,760
You moron! My father
never consumed alcohol.

1608
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,040
He is a teetotaller.

1609
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,680
Teetotaller!

1610
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,680
Sorry, Shoba.
I swear on you, me

1611
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,720
and the children
we are going to have

1612
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,280
that I won't drink from today.

1613
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,360
What are you holding?

1614
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,160
Spray.
- Spray?

1615
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,760
It's too big.
- Full body spray.

1616
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,760
It was a gift for your dad.
- Show it.

1617
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,600
No. - Show it.
- It's a deodorant. - No.

1618
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,600
You won't change!

1619
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,840
Shoba, I'll buy
a teetotaller if you want!

1620
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,080
Teetotaller..

1621
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,080
You old fool!

1622
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,880
Stay, Shoba..

1623
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:44,880
Shoba.

1624
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,040
Oh, God!

1625
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,960
Two. - Tell me the truth.
How many shots did you have?

1626
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,200
Five.

1627
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,720
Five.

1628
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,960
I had five as well.

1629
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,600
So, he didn't drink, did he?
- What's the matter?

1630
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,280
He told Shoba
that I'd got drunk last night.

1631
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,400
Drat..

1632
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,240
You are a nuisance
once you get drunk.

1633
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,120
You went to impress him
but the situation is depressing.

1634
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,680
It's okay.
I'm here to help you.

1635
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,680
He behaved like a girl.

1636
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,520
Dinesh, I'm here for you.

1637
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,040
Never ever do that.

1638
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,040
Idiot.

1639
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,280
What shall we do now?

1640
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,840
Dinesh.

1641
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,360
You've no clue
what I can do.

1642
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,240
We'll impress Shoba

1643
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,200
and her father
within the next 24 hours.

1644
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,840
I swear on Lord Ayyappan!

1645
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,600
I promise.

1646
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,480
Hail Lord Ayyappan.

1647
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,920
Everyone makes mistakes, Shoba.

1648
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,160
I'll find divinity

1649
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,960
by surrendering myself
and my worldly life

1650
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,920
to the Lord
through fasting for 41 days.

1651
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,320
What was the next sentence?

1652
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,840
God gives His hardest battles
to His toughest soldiers.

1653
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,760
Let me battle for God

1654
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,840
as I'm His toughest soldier.

1655
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,080
Aren't you surprised?

1656
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,400
I know
that you're surprised.

1657
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,160
This is nothing.

1658
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,240
You'll see many such
amazing surprises.

1659
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,800
Hail Lord Ayyappan.

1660
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,880
Let me pray.

1661
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,320
Hail Lord Ram..

1662
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,520
"It sparkles and shines."

1663
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,400
"It sparkles and shines."

1664
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,880
This is a huge surprise.

1665
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,080
I'm so happy.

1666
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,720
Many more surprises
await you, Shoba.

1667
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,480
We will live in this apartment
when we come to Chennai

1668
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,280
once in a while
after our wedding.

1669
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,040
See, Dinesh..

1670
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,960
I can't leave Chennai suddenly
and return to our hometown.

1671
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,840
My business is established here.

1672
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,440
I also have
a lot of commitments.

1673
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,960
And Priya is all alone here,
isn't she?

1674
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,600
Priya? She can take
care of herself.

1675
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,000
I had dreamed about the
hometown, village, my mother

1676
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,040
and business, you know..
- Dinesh, today is a good day.

1677
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,640
Should we be
discussing this today?

1678
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,520
That's true. But shouldn't we
discuss our wedding too?

1679
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,680
Mother is relentlessly calling me.
- Oh, I forgot.

1680
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,720
I have some shopping to do.
Let's get it done quickly.

1681
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,600
Come.

1682
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,920
Shoba, I was planning
some more surprises.

1683
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,760
That's when you said
these things and..

1684
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,360
I was thinking about getting
the apartment furnished.

1685
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:52,800
Let's not do it now, Dinesh.

1686
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:53,880
Don't waste money.

1687
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,160
No, money isn't an issue.

1688
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,640
On second thought,
everything in our hometown..

1689
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,440
We have Lulu Mall, the metro,
and new airports.

1690
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,680
We have everything we need.

1691
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,880
All of that has been here
for a long time.

1692
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,480
Come here.

1693
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,080
I was just..
- You're a Malayali, aren't you?

1694
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,480
Yes.

1695
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,760
If you are done ogling,
shall I take her along?

1696
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,440
Yes, please.

1697
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,280
I will beat you up, you swine!

1698
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,080
Hail Lord Ayyappan.
- Hail Lord Ayyappan.

1699
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,080
Get lost.
- Thank you.

1700
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,160
I will be right back.

1701
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,560
Hey.

1702
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,880
Isn't that Shoba?

1703
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,560
Y-Yes.

1704
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,040
Is she with you now?

1705
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,400
All right, then.

1706
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,560
Hey.

1707
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,680
Let's go.

1708
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,800
Let's go.

1709
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,640
Dinesh, try this.
It's really nice.

1710
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,800
It's not that nice.
I didn't like it.

1711
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,480
What's your problem now?

1712
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,720
What problem could I have?

1713
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,440
Besides, it's something that
I have to deal with on my own.

1714
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,960
You are always busy
with messages, calls, meetings..

1715
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,240
Dinesh, what is this?

1716
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,840
I'm free after the product
launch on the day after tomorrow.

1717
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,760
Shoba, that's not
the issue right now.

1718
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:47,960
That woman..

1719
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,960
I mean, I am fed up of making
excuses to mom.

1720
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,440
She is always asking
about the wedding.

1721
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,960
It's up to you now.

1722
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,520
But I spoke with her yesterday.

1723
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,080
She didn't say
anything to me, Dinesh.

1724
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,120
Whose mom?

1725
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,480
Why are you calling my mom?

1726
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,640
I don't like anyone else
calling my mom.

1727
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,800
I completely hate it, you know.
- Okay.. Relax..

1728
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,840
Shall I order a drink for you?

1729
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,360
Don't try to get me drunk.

1730
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,360
Just a second.

1731
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,440
It's an urgent phone call.

1732
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:49,000
"She is like a chest
of unsolved mysteries."

1733
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,920
"I will not let you go."

1734
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,400
"I will not let you go, baby."

1735
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,680
"She is like a chest
of unsolved mysteries."

1736
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,880
"I will not let you go."

1737
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,200
"I will not let you go, baby."

1738
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:04,240
"She is a cunning fraudster."

1739
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,120
"I will not let you go."

1740
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:08,640
"Yes, I will not
let you go, baby."

1741
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,440
"I'm never going to give up."

1742
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,400
"I'm never going to suck up."

1743
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,040
"I will find out the truth.
You watch out, baby."

1744
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,160
"I'm never going to give up."

1745
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,040
"I'm never going
to suck up."

1746
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:23,880
"I will find out the truth.
You watch out, baby."

1747
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,840
"She is like a chest
of unsolved mysteries."

1748
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,800
"I will not let you go."

1749
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,240
"I will not let you go, baby."

1750
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,840
"I'm never going to give up.

1751
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,760
"I'm never going to suck up."

1752
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,240
"I will find out the truth."
You watch out, baby."

1753
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,520
"I'm never going to give up."

1754
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,360
"I'm never going to suck up."

1755
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,080
"I will find out the truth.
You watch out, baby."

1756
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,320
Hey, stop..

1757
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,760
Hey.
Is it him?

1758
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,600
No. Get lost..

1759
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,040
Dinesh.
- Yes.

1760
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,920
If he asked you
whether she is with you now

1761
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,840
doesn't it mean that she was
with many other guys before?

1762
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,800
No..
That's not what I meant.

1763
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,520
But still, when someone
asks you such things..

1764
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,480
Just let this one go, Dinesh.
- Where have I seen him before?

1765
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,720
He looked familiar.

1766
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,160
Hey.

1767
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,680
Where's the nearest bar?

1768
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,520
Take the first left turn
and then, turn right.

1769
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,480
Okay.

1770
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,680
Lucky guy.

1771
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,400
It's him.
There he goes.

1772
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,440
Let him go and drink.

1773
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:51,880
That's the guy.

1774
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,360
Get on the motorcycle.

1775
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:55,960
Let's go..

1776
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,760
Hurry up.

1777
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,280
"I'm never going to give up."

1778
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,080
"I'm never going to suck up."

1779
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,200
"I will find out the truth."

1780
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,560
"You watch out, baby."
- Hey, go and make him understand.'

1781
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,680
He is repeating it.

1782
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,760
"I will find out the truth.
You watch out.."

1783
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,240
How do you know Shoba?

1784
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:56,960
Did you ask me something?

1785
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,880
How do you know Shoba, sir?

1786
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,440
He told me to ask you.

1787
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,440
I like how brave you are.

1788
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,520
I like how haughty you are.

1789
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,080
But I don't like
your face at all.

1790
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,160
Why, sir?

1791
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:17,760
Shoba.

1792
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,280
Shall we sit down
and talk?

1793
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:25,360
Didn't we meet two days ago?

1794
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:31,720
Guys, he is the new guy.

1795
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,400
Well, you look very innocent.

1796
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,040
I am wondering
how to tell you.

1797
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,640
Fine.

1798
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,600
Nowadays, even average
looking women have

1799
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:45,800
three guys
pursuing them.

1800
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,520
Even they attract people.

1801
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,560
So, obviously, beautiful girls
will have many men pursuing them.

1802
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,520
Fifty? Twenty?

1803
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,320
Let's say, ten.

1804
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,760
Consider half of them.

1805
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,040
The girl would avoid
them by saying

1806
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,040
that she considered
them to be friends or brothers.

1807
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,200
Out of those ten guys

1808
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,880
she might like at least one.

1809
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,560
There will certainly be someone.

1810
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,200
She would have no
respect for him.

1811
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,880
Because she knows well

1812
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,560
that there will be another one
if he leaves.

1813
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,600
Think about it, pal.

1814
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,120
Think about it.

1815
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,120
Shoba.

1816
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,160
Isn't she pretty?

1817
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,880
How many conditions
did she put forth to you?

1818
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,360
Tell me, my friend.

1819
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,320
My friend, we are all men.
Our nature is similar.'

1820
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:49,360
We may be dark
but our hearts are pure.

1821
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,760
See you.

1822
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,000
Hey, let's go.

1823
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,560
"The boss is here."

1824
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,800
"The boss is here."

1825
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:03,840
"The boss is here."

1826
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,720
"The boss is here."

1827
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:09,920
"The boss is here."

1828
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,880
"The boss is here."

1829
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,400
Doctor, does he have ulcer?

1830
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,080
Really? He is drunk
so early in the day!

1831
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:53,280
If he gulps down a bottle of
alcohol as he did early in the day

1832
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,880
he would end up with cancer,
not ulcer.

1833
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,680
That means he is all right,
isn't he? - You..

1834
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,080
Excuse me, by the way,
I am also a doctor. Okay?

1835
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,560
Dinesh..

1836
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,960
Look.

1837
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:12,800
I asked them to come.

1838
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,960
Aren't you happy?

1839
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,640
Well..
S-Shoba, actually..

1840
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:38,080
"You're the glowing light"

1841
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,320
"in my heart."
- Shoba, just relax.

1842
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,120
Calm down.
- "When I travel"

1843
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,920
"through different paths.."

1844
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:57,720
"Your image is the only thing
that I see."

1845
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:05,520
"The surroundings are filled
with memories."

1846
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:14,680
"I was filled with joy
every day."

1847
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:21,120
"Even while searching for
the shore which was far away"

1848
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,960
"you guided me"

1849
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:33,840
"like a ray of hope."

1850
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:42,400
"You mean the world to me."

1851
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,120
Everything will be
all right, Dinesh.

1852
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:20,080
Shoba belongs to you, Dinesh.

1853
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,920
Convey my regards to Sagar.

1854
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,200
Take care.

1855
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,560
Did I tell her all that?

1856
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,400
Shoba, do you know that
even my mom hasn't slapped me?

1857
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:42,760
That's why you're
so reckless, Dinesh.

1858
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,360
Did you call me early in the
morning to say this? - Dinesh..

1859
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,840
Tell me where you are.

1860
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,320
Shoba, just tell me
why you called.

1861
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,520
Let's get married, Dinesh.

1862
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,200
Marriage?

1863
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,360
Get married..

1864
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:55,200
I knew that it would end up
like this.

1865
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,480
That's not what I said.

1866
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,520
Let us get married.

1867
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,960
Are you sure about this?
- I am, Dinesh.

1868
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,240
Promise?

1869
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,640
I promise.

1870
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,160
Good decision.

1871
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,880
At least now,
tell me where you are.

1872
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,320
Me?

1873
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,680
I have no clue.
I'm on top of a hill.

1874
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,160
I can only see hills here.

1875
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,800
I'll ask someone
and call you back.

1876
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,960
"My dream has come true."

1877
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,800
"Your dream has also come true."

1878
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,200
"Our dreams have come true."

1879
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,080
"My dream has come true."

1880
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,920
"Your dream has also come true."

1881
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,360
"Our dreams have come true."

1882
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,200
"My dream has come true."

1883
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,880
"Your dream has also come true."

1884
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,400
"Our dreams have come true."

1885
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,320
"My dream has come true."

1886
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,120
"Your dream has also come true."

1887
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:57,480
"Our dreams have come true."

1888
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,400
"My destiny is coming to pass."

1889
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,960
"My dreams are coming true."

1890
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:08,440
"Let's break free
from our confinements."

1891
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,960
Hey, Venkat!

1892
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,640
Where are you, buddy?

1893
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,680
Are you downstairs?

1894
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,200
I will come.
I'll be there right away.

1895
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:24,200
"Your dream has also come true.
- Our dreams have come true.."

1896
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,720
Hey, buddy!
- Hey!

1897
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:30,800
How are you?

1898
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:31,960
How's everything going?

1899
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,960
I've arranged a big party.

1900
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,440
Come inside and drink.
- Oh.

1901
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,400
I have got some work.

1902
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,800
I just thought of meeting you
on the way.

1903
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,320
Just have a shot.

1904
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,480
I'll drink more than one
if I come upstairs.

1905
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,320
You know that, buddy.

1906
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,720
Let's party on the day
of the wedding.

1907
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,760
Is that so?
Okay.

1908
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:48,600
Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Have fun.. - Bye..

1909
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,480
Careful..

1910
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,560
Go..

1911
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,240
Go..

1912
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,200
Okay.

1913
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:58,640
Bye.

1914
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,240
Dinesh.
- Yes.

1915
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:19,720
Dinesh..

1916
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:22,160
Yes. I'm Dinesh.

1917
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,760
Your wedding is on the day
after tomorrow, right?

1918
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,800
Yes.

1919
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,240
Who are you?

1920
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,960
You must be really happy, right?

1921
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,360
She meant the world to me.

1922
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,120
But she didn't want me.

1923
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,880
She wanted my money.

1924
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,720
After I agreed
to all her conditions

1925
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,920
and when we were about to
get married..

1926
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:56,480
She went to her hometown
under the pretext

1927
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,920
of attending a friend's wedding.

1928
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,720
But later, I found out that

1929
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,440
her wedding was fixed

1930
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,840
with some wealthy guy.

1931
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,480
What I said now
is about Shoba

1932
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,960
the one you're going
to marry, Dinesh.

1933
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,800
If I come
and say this

1934
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,400
just before your wedding

1935
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,880
you might think I'm a fraud.

1936
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,560
I understand.

1937
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,560
Ask Shoba if she knows Rohan

1938
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,080
when you have time, Dinesh.

1939
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,720
She wouldn't have
forgotten me by now.

1940
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,640
Bye.

1941
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,800
So, this guy is Rohan.

1942
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,040
Why didn't you
discuss this with me

1943
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,600
after what happened
yesterday, Dinesh?

1944
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:41,200
My wedding is supposed to happen
after two days.

1945
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,640
I can't bear to watch my dad

1946
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,480
get humiliated
in front of everybody.

1947
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,080
He doesn't deserve it.

1948
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,800
I don't know why he backed out
in the last minute.

1949
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,160
He's suspecting me
just because a guy

1950
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,200
told him something.

1951
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,680
Am I such a bad person?

1952
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:06,240
I just wished to live happily
with him.

1953
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,840
Ma'am.

1954
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,360
'Don't forget to try on
the dresses I had sent.'

1955
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,960
'Tell me if any alterations
have to be made.'

1956
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,400
Okay.

1957
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,960
'Why do you sound
upset, dear?' - No..

1958
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,760
I-It's nothing.
- 'That's not true.'

1959
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,720
'There's some problem.'

1960
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,640
'Why do you sound
upset, dear?'

1961
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,400
'Dear..'

1962
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,400
I'll call him, dear.

1963
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,960
Hello?
- Hand over the phone to Dinesh.

1964
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,040
I'll give it to him.

1965
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,200
Your mom..
- Tell her that I'm not here.

1966
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,840
I think she has
found out everything.

1967
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:59,840
Yes. - Is there any truth
in what I heard?

1968
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:02,000
Why are you hurting her
so much?

1969
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,360
She is in tears.

1970
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,440
Are you going to come here
or should I come there?

1971
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,040
What do you know, Mom?

1972
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,280
Does this mean you trust her?

1973
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,360
I'm coming.
Call her too.

1974
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,960
Let's first take a decision
about this. Come!

1975
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:20,760
Stop there.

1976
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,680
What are you doing
in the last minute

1977
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:27,360
after asking all these people
to come to Chennai?

1978
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,040
She is crying.

1979
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,160
Nobody is aware of this now.

1980
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,760
If you don't settle this before

1981
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,800
tomorrow morning.. Dinesh..
- Where is she?

1982
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:46,680
Who is this, Shoba?

1983
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,640
I don't know.

1984
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,800
Don't you know who this person is?
- I don't know.

1985
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,320
Don't you know that he is Rohan?

1986
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,800
I don't know, Dinesh.

1987
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,160
Why would a stranger
say such things about you?

1988
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,520
Or are you saying that
I cooked up this story?

1989
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,800
What should I deduce
from this photo?

1990
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:05,960
Lower your voice, Dinesh.
- Why?

1991
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,360
I'm not going to keep quiet.

1992
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,400
Don't think you can fool me
so easily.

1993
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,840
Don't think we can take another
step until you tell me who he is

1994
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,880
and what is your relationship
with him.

1995
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,040
Or else, we can just end this
right here.

1996
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,880
What?

1997
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:22,320
End it?

1998
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,280
How can I tell you about something

1999
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,160
that I don't know?
I don't know him..

2000
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,200
Shoba.

2001
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:35,240
I don't know what's the problem
between you both.

2002
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,960
Both of you fell in love
with each other

2003
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,240
and fixed this wedding.

2004
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,920
If the situation is like this now

2005
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:43,800
there will be more problems

2006
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,320
after your wedding.

2007
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,480
Sir, please..

2008
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,360
You don't have
to get involved in this.

2009
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,880
You won't understand anyway.

2010
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,120
This is so annoying..

2011
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,960
What would I not understand?

2012
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,320
Even though
a lot of time has passed

2013
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:57,480
the problems
between men and women

2014
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,800
have remained the same, Dinesh.

2015
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:03,560
After falling in love
and dreaming about life

2016
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:07,160
you get married.
But while finding out

2017
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:09,200
the realities of life

2018
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,680
if a bond isn't formed

2019
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,280
between a husband and a wife

2020
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,200
it will shatter the foundation
of the relationship.

2021
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,160
Philosophies like these
only sound good.

2022
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,040
Why wasn't that foundation created
in your life?

2023
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,480
For how long did you
live with your wife?

2024
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,840
Stop it, Dinesh!

2025
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:33,440
I..
I hate you, Dinesh.

2026
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,520
Let's go, Dad.

2027
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,360
Dear..

2028
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:15,960
Let it go, buddy.

2029
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,080
Just consider that you escaped
a catastrophe.

2030
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:23,640
It's not that I don't know
how to ruin her life

2031
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,200
by creating a problem
using this.

2032
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,560
But..

2033
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,240
I fell deeply in love
with her, buddy.

2034
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,160
Chennai..

2035
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,320
Shall I leave, buddy?

2036
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,560
Lady on the rocks..

2037
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,640
That was a nice plan, buddy.

2038
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,640
Dinesh went
to his hometown.

2039
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,600
You should've seen Shoba's face.

2040
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,200
She was crying.

2041
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,400
It would've made you happy
if you had seen it.

2042
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,640
How did you do it, buddy?

2043
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,560
I just asked one question.

2044
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,400
'Is she with you now?'

2045
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,360
A small spark.

2046
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,960
Did you see how I ignited it?

2047
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:48,560
But Dinesh's condition
makes me feel bad.

2048
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,840
Okay..
He's innocent.

2049
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:54,080
But his lover..
Shoba..

2050
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:57,040
Didn't she ruin our lives?

2051
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,440
It's karma, buddy.

2052
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:00,080
This is how karma strikes back.

2053
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,400
Now, she must have realised
our pain, right?

2054
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:07,800
Priya and I were in love
for six years.

2055
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:10,200
She ruined it in just six months.

2056
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,400
You come home late every day.

2057
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,800
You say that you went somewhere
with Shoba.

2058
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,280
You keep roaming around with her.

2059
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:27,520
Why?
Will you only listen to her?

2060
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,320
Will you give it to me
only if she asks you to?

2061
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,080
That wretched woman!

2062
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:33,400
If you speak ill of her again

2063
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,080
I will not spare you!

2064
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,120
I'll..
- Ravi!

2065
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:42,800
She's not going to stay with you
for another day. Come.

2066
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,240
It has been one and a half years

2067
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,760
since I last saw Priya.

2068
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:58,160
She left me in the lurch.

2069
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:02,880
Apparently, she doesn't
need me anymore.

2070
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:06,800
Forget that, buddy.

2071
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,320
Your plan has worked out.

2072
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,400
What are you still thinking about?

2073
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,000
Celebrate.

2074
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,080
Where's our hero?

2075
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:21,800
Villain.

2076
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,840
Suman?
- Yes.

2077
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:54,520
I am Suman!
I can do anything!

2078
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:55,760
Cheers!

2079
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:04,080
I might be a drunkard,
a bad guy

2080
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:06,480
and a playboy.
But I..

2081
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,640
I will stand by my friend when
he's in trouble.

2082
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,440
I taught that girl, who ruined
your life, a lesson!

2083
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,680
Do you know why I did this?

2084
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:24,360
Why?

2085
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:26,880
Don't you know it either?

2086
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,200
Tell me why.

2087
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,760
It's because you're my friend.

2088
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,160
Friend..

2089
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,760
I trust you.

2090
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,200
Can we click a selfie, buddy?

2091
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,480
Let's click it.

2092
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,520
A selfie, right?

2093
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,680
Let's click a selfie happily..

2094
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,200
Venkat started boozing.

2095
01:57:58,040 --> 01:57:59,520
We could've boozed too.

2096
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,880
Isn't it going to be a long drive?

2097
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:06,320
Do you have the photos
of that guy with Shoba?

2098
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,520
It's inside that.

2099
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,240
Did they know each other?

2100
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,320
Such a small world, right?

2101
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:17,680
Dinesh, look at this.

2102
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,240
How come this guy is with them?

2103
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,400
Suman.

2104
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:47,600
Hey, Suman!

2105
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,720
What's wrong?
- Get up.

2106
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,200
Get up..
- Wait..

2107
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,880
Did you upload that photo
on Facebook?

2108
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,800
Yes, buddy.
I tagged you as well.

2109
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,160
Idiot!

2110
01:58:57,680 --> 01:58:59,240
Dinesh has commented on the photo.

2111
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,640
Dinesh..
Who is he?

2112
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,840
I'm talking about Dinesh!

2113
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:04,040
Show it.

2114
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:06,520
'You scoundrels!'

2115
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:07,320
What does that mean?

2116
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,600
It's an expletive, buddy.

2117
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:10,840
Profanity..

2118
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:13,960
He's going to come here.

2119
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:16,880
Let him come.

2120
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:20,640
If he comes here, he'll not leave
this place alive.

2121
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,360
Ask him what he wants.

2122
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:54,080
Two bottles
of beer and a plate of beef roast.

2123
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:03,440
He's here with a purpose.

2124
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,640
Hey!

2125
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,400
Take him out, guys!

2126
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,800
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

2127
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,920
"Rock the party, baby."

2128
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:01,240
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

2129
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:03,160
"Rock the party, baby."

2130
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:30,920
"On the floor, baby.
Hit it hard, baby."

2131
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,960
"Rock the party, baby."

2132
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,320
"On the floor, baby.."

2133
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:39,440
Hello, police station?
- 'Yes.'

2134
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,480
Sir, some goons are here
and they're being savage.

2135
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,040
A brawl is going on here, sir.

2136
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:44,480
My friends are bleeding

2137
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,640
and they're crying helplessly.
- 'Is that so?'

2138
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,800
'Where are you?'
- We're in Colours Bar, sir.

2139
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:50,120
'Girls?'
- Sir, not girls..

2140
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,600
Colours, sir..

2141
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,360
Love.. Action.. Drama..

2142
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,240
Where's love in this story?

2143
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:15,280
Hey!
Aren't you a comedian?

2144
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,840
You look exactly like one.

2145
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,080
Hey! Do you know
what is love?

2146
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,440
Love is simple.

2147
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,920
It's also powerful.

2148
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:29,280
How would guys like you understand
such emotions?

2149
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,200
Sir, I would've married her
and taken her to my hometown.

2150
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:33,960
They could've lived happily
with their wives then, right, sir?

2151
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,040
Is that your plan?
- Yes..

2152
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:38,560
Tell me if that's your plan.
- Yes, sir.

2153
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:40,680
Hey! Listen to him!
That's his plan.

2154
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,280
Why did you do it then?

2155
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:44,640
Well..
- Sir, how would we know his plan?

2156
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:46,440
Correct.

2157
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,200
How would they know it?

2158
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:49,760
His wife is instigating
that guy's wife.

2159
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:51,160
His wife is instigating
the other guy's wife.

2160
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,640
My wife is creating problems
for me!

2161
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,880
Isn't one guy responsible for
creating all these problems?

2162
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,200
Where is he?
- Excuse me, sir.

2163
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:03,840
Who is that?

2164
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,520
This guy?

2165
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,960
Come..

2166
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:20,640
I'm Suman, sir.

2167
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:23,080
I'm the one who called you
and asked you to come there.

2168
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:25,000
Don't you remember me?
Colours?

2169
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:27,960
Come here..
- I'm coming, sir.

2170
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:29,840
Don't worry.

2171
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,720
Buddy, I'm here.

2172
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,960
Sir, where did you go
after asking us

2173
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:36,480
to come there?

2174
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,320
A lot of action took place
on the beach, sir.

2175
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,720
I was covered with dust.
I thought

2176
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,240
of taking a bath
before meeting you.

2177
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,720
I was looking for you.
- Sir..

2178
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:46,040
Sir..
- Were you taking a bath

2179
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,440
after ruining the lives
of three people?

2180
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,000
I'll make you take a bath here!

2181
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,240
Hey! - Sir..
- Make him take a bath!

2182
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,320
Sir, I'm innocent.

2183
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,240
Please leave me.
Sir..

2184
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:57,080
Sir, please let me go. Please..
I didn't do anything.

2185
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,560
You've arrived.

2186
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:02,040
Aren't you Shoba?
- Yes, sir.

2187
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:05,960
Did you see how I identified her?
See how I did it! - Yes, sir.

2188
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:09,080
Ma'am, you mean the world
to your lover.

2189
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:12,160
But these morons ruined
your wedding.

2190
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:15,160
You're not supposed to settle
your family problems here.

2191
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:17,560
You're supposed to settle
this outside. All right?

2192
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:20,320
So, get out!

2193
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,480
Okay, sir. Thank you.
- Hey!

2194
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,360
Where are you going?
- They're my friends, sir.

2195
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,800
Let them go.
- Hey..

2196
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:27,880
My friends are leaving, sir.
Hey. - I'll be your friend.

2197
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:28,920
Come with me.

2198
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,760
I did it because I love you.
- That's enough!

2199
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,800
I'm extremely sorry.

2200
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,520
Don't say another word!
- Will you never reform?

2201
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:36,200
I can't take this anymore.
- I'm sorry.

2202
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,080
I can't take this anymore.
- Shoba..

2203
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:40,920
Shoba..
Listen to me.

2204
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:43,760
Can you say that
you aren't guilty at all?

2205
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,480
They ruined my life as well
because they hate you.

2206
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:49,400
I shouldn't have doubted you
because of some stranger.

2207
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,120
I made a mistake, Shoba.

2208
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:55,320
Shoba, we have problems because
we love each other a lot, right?

2209
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:56,840
Shoba..

2210
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,600
Say something!

2211
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,040
Isn't everything over, Dinesh?

2212
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:16,120
What did you tell my dad?

2213
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:19,400
Didn't you believe what a stranger
told you, Dinesh?

2214
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:22,720
Is that what you think
about me?

2215
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,400
I might forget everything
with time.

2216
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:27,920
But I can't trust you again..

2217
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,440
My time and effort..

2218
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:34,240
That signifies
a relationship for me.

2219
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:37,240
The most important thing
that a woman needs

2220
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:39,640
is the trust that her man
has for her.

2221
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:42,680
That trust gives a woman

2222
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:44,520
the courage and strength
to live on.

2223
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,720
The ones whom I loved, have
always left me, Shoba.

2224
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:53,000
The fear that I would lose you
made me do everything.

2225
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,400
My inferiority complex
and possessiveness..

2226
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,280
I might have all that
until the day I die.

2227
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:03,720
But, Shoba..

2228
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,520
Don't leave me
in this situation.

2229
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:10,000
If you leave me,
I'll be devastated, Shoba.

2230
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:13,760
Please.

2231
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:15,200
Please trust me.

2232
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,560
Please.

2233
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:22,640
Will you drink again?
- No.

2234
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:24,560
I will not drink again.

2235
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:27,360
Will you smoke?
- I won't smoke.

2236
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:28,920
Convince my father.

2237
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,320
Shoba..

2238
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:55,400
Sir.. - What?
- Is this enough, sir?

2239
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:56,520
Continue..

2240
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,280
Sir!
- Shut up and take your bath.

2241
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,440
Sir!

2242
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:17,120
Was this necessary?

2243
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:19,320
I had asked you
that very day.

2244
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:22,000
I asked if we could live
together like a family.

2245
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,480
I'm of no value now.

2246
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:26,880
Mr. Sagar..
Mr. Dinesh..

2247
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,400
Cheers!

2248
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,000
I'll be right back.
- Do you have to go so early?

2249
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,400
"I set my eyes on her
the moment I saw her."

2250
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,760
"A dream that I have had
for a long time."

2251
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,960
"The ocean with high tides"

2252
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,840
"and the forest
filled with darkness"

2253
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:37,680
"became pathways
in this journey."

2254
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,600
"I don't feel anything wrong"

2255
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:41,520
"when she's becoming mine"

2256
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,240
"after falling in love with her."

2257
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:48,960
"She's entering my life
like a Goddess"

2258
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:52,840
"after I told a hundred lies
to accomplish my goal."

2259
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:11,440
"I set my eyes on her
the moment I saw her."

2260
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:15,200
"A dream that I have had
for a long time."

2261
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,040
"The ocean with high tides"

2262
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,880
"and the forest
filled with darkness"

2263
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:25,960
"became pathways
in this journey."

2264
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,520
Sir, please forgive me.

2265
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:47,040
I made a mistake.

2266
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,880
Doesn't every human
make mistakes?

2267
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,280
You must've made
many mistakes too.

2268
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:53,960
Doesn't she need someone
to take care of her after you die?

2269
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,920
I'll take good care of her, sir.

2270
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:57,640
Please forgive me.

2271
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:00,200
Why are you looking at me
like that?

2272
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,720
I'm feeling strange.

2273
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:04,080
I won't let you go
until you forgive me.

2274
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:07,640
Tell me that you've forgiven me.
- P-Please stand up, Ganesh.

2275
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:09,280
Ganesh?

2276
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,520
Not Ganesh..
My name is Dinesh.

2277
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:13,920
D-Dinesh..
- You forgot me, sir.

2278
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:15,840
Stand up, Dinesh.
- Please forgive me.

2279
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:17,080
Stand up.

2280
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:18,920
Did you forgive me? - Yes.
- Tell me that you have.

2281
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:20,880
I forgive you, Dinesh.
Stand up.

2282
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:25,960
When something goes wrong

2283
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,280
some nincompoops come forward
to give advice.

2284
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:30,080
They're the actual
troublemakers, sir.

2285
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,640
I-I wasn't referring to you, sir.

2286
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:35,200
After all..

2287
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:37,680
After all..

2288
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,040
'A perfect marriage is'

2289
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:41,840
'two imperfect people'

2290
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,320
'refusing
to give up on each other.'

2291
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:48,480
'You cannot scroll down
without liking this picture, sir.'

2292
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,360
It's Shoba..
Say 'Okay' to her..

2293
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,560
It's Shoba..
Please say 'Okay' to her..

2294
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,800
Okay.

2295
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,240
Ganesh..
- Shoba..

2296
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,680
Sorry.. Dinesh..

2297
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:07,600
"I don't feel anything wrong"

2298
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,480
"when she's becoming mine"

2299
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,240
"after falling in love with her."

2300
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:16,920
"She's entering my life
like a Goddess"

2301
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,720
"after I told a hundred lies
to accomplish my goal."

2302
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:24,400
"I put on a lot of disguises
to deceive her."

2303
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:28,120
"I told a lot of lies
to get things done."

2304
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:35,640
"You came with me
for you wanted us to be together."

2305
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:37,520
"You were as graceful
as a flower"

2306
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:39,400
"and your cheeks were blushing."

2307
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:43,160
"I found the purpose in my life
that I was looking for."

2308
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:47,360
"I found the purpose in my life
that I was looking for."

2309
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:05,640
"I set my eyes on her
the moment I saw her."

2310
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:09,400
"A dream that I have had
for a long time."

2311
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,200
"The ocean with high tides"

2312
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,080
"and the forest
filled with darkness"

2313
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,400
"became pathways
in this journey."

2314
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:27,920
"Won't you shine brightly
like a lamp"

2315
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:31,840
"in front of me every day
from now?"

2316
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,560
"I can remember those moments"

2317
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:39,360
"when I touched your body."

2318
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,240
"Everything ended well here."

2319
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:43,040
"I can hear the voice of love."

2320
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:46,840
"My soul is filled with joy."

2321
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:51,240
"My soul is filled with joy."

2322
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:09,280
"I set my eyes on her
the moment I saw her."

2323
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:13,080
"A dream that I have had
for a long time."

2324
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,880
"The ocean with high tides"

2325
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,800
