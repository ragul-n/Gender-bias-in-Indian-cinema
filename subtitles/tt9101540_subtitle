1
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,540
Manu, where are you now? Oh God!

2
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,830
Am I not speaking in Malayalam?

3
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,370
Make it clear, Manu. Where are you now?

4
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,330
I'm in front of Jail Bhavan.

5
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,330
The IG's appointment is at 10.30 AM.

6
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,080
It's 10.15 AM now.

7
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,500
When are you going to arrive?

8
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,540
You're aware of Bangalore traffic, right Manu?

9
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,620
I will reach soon.

10
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,330
Okay.

11
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,830
What's your elder brother's name? - Sachidanandan.

12
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,250
Around 90 prisoners who have completed their jail term like Sachidanandan,

13
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,040
are still behind bars in different jails in Karnataka.

14
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,370
There are many procedures to get them released.

15
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,500
I'm not asking you to release all of them, sir.

16
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,620
I came to talk only about my big brother.

17
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,870
You're lucky that he didn't put you also behind bars!

18
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,080
There's a limit in answering back, Manu. - Yeah, right!

19
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,040
He's talking as if the others are giving company to my brother.

20
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,660
If the Government has money, not just 90, let them feed and shelter 900 people!

21
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,330
But they can't keep my brother in the jail anymore. - Softly!

22
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,990
Gemini, we should get the DGP's appointment.

23
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,830
The Mangalore jail warden's report is really favourable.

24
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,370
I shall recommend this and send it to the Government.

25
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,120
Sir, even the earlier DGP...

26
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,450
.. used to say the same thing, and send us back.

27
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,450
Finally when the list comes out, only my brother's name wouldn't be there.

28
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,700
Then there might be some objection from the Government.

29
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,200
Sir, my brother went to jail before I was born.

30
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,950
Now I am 24 years old.

31
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,290
My brother has completed his double life sentence too.

32
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,330
What's the objection now sir?

33
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Well...

34
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,330
Meet the Home Minister and give a complaint.

35
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,660
Hello! - Where have you reached? - Sorry.

36
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,000
I had to pick up my sister's son from school.

37
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,540
I'll drop him home and come soon.

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,950
Minister will leave by then.

39
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
Then we'll come there directly. Okay?

40
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,370
Okay. Come fast.

41
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,040
Get me the file.

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Good evening, Achaya.

43
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,330
Good evening.

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,750
You've brought a kid along this time?

45
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,790
What's it?

46
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,580
I brought him to introduce him.

47
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,250
After we die, he will be coming instead of us.

48
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,290
So you are aware, that it's impossible.

49
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,330
Sit down.

50
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,250
This time you should recommend this strongly to the Minister.

51
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,990
If you tell him, he would listen.

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,540
Not just me. Even if you tell him, he would 'listen'.

53
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,410
Minister is not deaf.

54
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,950
'Anyway, things will work out with this.'

55
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,950
Don't have any such hopes!

56
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,990
Come. - You've been coming here for many years.

57
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,160
That's why I'm saying this openly.

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,660
The Intelligence report is against your brother.

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,330
This is unfair, sir.

60
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,080
It is dangerous to release your brother.

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,950
That's the Intelligence report.

62
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,790
Excuse me.

63
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,040
There's a perfect person who can release your brother from jail.

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,450
Edwin Moses. Here you go.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,910
Just call on this number.

66
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,450
Good morning, sir.

67
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,080
This is for Sachidanandan, of cell no. 19.

68
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,790
He's working at that ground.

69
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,910
Ask him to come and meet me after that. - Okay sir.

70
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,950
Why are you hitting me, Govind Raj Anna?

71
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,080
I didn't do anything, right?

72
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,080
You didn't do anything, dear!

73
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,830
Bloody rascal!

74
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,160
That's why I hit you!

75
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,120
You didn't do anything?

76
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,250
Bloody rascal!

77
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
You, me and him have come here, to serve our punishments.

78
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,200
If you try to punish him further,

79
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,290
I'll chop it off!

80
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,330
Bloody rascal!

81
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
What happened, Sachi?

82
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
What's the matter?

83
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,620
Come.

84
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,620
Your name is on the list this time.

85
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,910
Congratulations.

86
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,330
Here. It's a letter from your younger brother.

87
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,500
My dear brother...

88
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
There's a good news.

89
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,290
Minister signed your releasing order today.

90
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,500
I am as thrilled as Robert De Bruce who fought till he won,

91
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,500
without admitting failure.

92
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
Not just me.

93
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,290
Our whole family.

94
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,580
There will be a celebration here, on the day you reach.

95
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,830
Rest, when we meet in person.

96
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,500
I will be waiting for you outside the jail, on this Independence day.

97
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,120
Yours faithfully, Manu.

98
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,290
If you keep clicking photos, we won't reach on time for the wedding.

99
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,000
From your hurry, it seems like you are the one who's getting married!

100
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Though it's not my wedding, my dad is getting married because I asked him to!

101
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,540
And not because you asked him, grandma!

102
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,870
Sachidanandan!

103
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,290
A widower like me also had many children like you.

104
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,700
But none of them forced me to get married again!

105
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,910
Why are you troubling him, Achuettan?

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,370
He's happy that he's going to get a new mother!

107
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,330
You don't have to change clothes again, right dad?

108
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,950
Didn't you have enough by making me dress up like this?

109
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:09,290
'O birds which flew away, will you come back to the branches of memories?'

110
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:17,120
'Will you come back to wipe the tears off these moist eyes?'

111
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,750
'Will you give a feather?'

112
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,870
'Will there be colours? Will there be music?'

113
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,500
'Will you give the rhythm of the rain?'

114
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,330
Vishnu!

115
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,950
'One day, a garden of flowers appears before my eyes'

116
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,620
'As I remember the days that filled my heart with sweet memories'

117
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:52,370
'Will the flowers that blossomed then, and the fireflies come again?'

118
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:00,120
'Will those rays of sunshine and smiles, come during this darkness?'

119
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:08,040
'Will the flowers that blossomed then, and the fireflies come again?'

120
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:16,250
'Will those rays of sunshine and smiles, come during this darkness?'

121
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,660
'The dragonflies in the nest of leaves, disappeared somewhere in the sky'

122
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:55,500
'Did they turn into a rainbow far, far away?'

123
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:03,370
'As the rain of honey in my ear ends, as the desires in my heart wail'

124
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:11,160
'As the golden moments rush by'

125
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
'In this darkness, all over my heart'

126
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,580
I'll be late.

127
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:26,080
'Will the long forgotten lines of a song caress my heart?'

128
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,540
Hey! Stop!

129
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,120
Come here! - Vishnu! Karthiyetta, what are you doing?

130
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,910
Give my child. - Your child?

131
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,910
He is mine! Mine alone!

132
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,250
Leave him!

133
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,410
You...!!

134
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,290
If you label me a madman,

135
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
push me into a mental hospital,

136
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,540
and get a divorce,

137
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,870
did your family think that I would be finished?

138
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,910
I won't be finished!

139
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,370
You thought you could live happily?

140
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,910
No! Son! Sachi! - Vishnu, go!

141
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,120
No, son! No!

142
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
Sachi..!!

143
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,040
Pareekar, he's quite tough!

144
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,040
Why isn't he crying, even after being beaten up so much?

145
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,620
He must have applied some lotion.

146
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
So that it doesn't pain.

147
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,250
These beatings are nothing for him!

148
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,040
He came here after killing his mother's first husband!

149
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Allah!

150
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,750
It's a murder case?

151
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,540
Bloody rascal!! You don't make me feel good about this!

152
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,370
Run!

153
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,950
Come!

154
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,910
Didn't I give you already?

155
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,370
Don't ask too many questions.

156
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Just give him!

157
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,790
Eat it.

158
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,870
Have you come here after killing someone?

159
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,330
Someone else might have done it and framed you for it, right?

160
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,870
No.

161
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,080
I did it myself.

162
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:42,250
'One day, a garden of flowers appears before my eyes'

163
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:50,160
'As I remember the days that filled my heart with sweet memories'

164
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:58,040
'Will the flowers that blossomed then, and the fireflies come again?'

165
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,790
'Will those rays of sunshine and smiles, come during this darkness?'

166
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,620
The warden is beating up Khan and Ghani.

167
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,870
No, sir. Don't hit him, sir.

168
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,500
I will cry! - He is so cruel!

169
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,830
Bloody @%@%@%

170
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,330
I know how to make you cry!

171
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,040
Although the accused are both young,

172
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,660
this Court cannot take lightly the crime they have committed,

173
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,370
considering that the crime took place within the confines of a juvenile home,

174
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,580
and the victim was a serving police officer.

175
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,370
The accused do not deserve any degree of leniency,

176
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,080
especially the prime accused Sachidanandan.

177
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,500
At the time of the crime, he had turned an adult by then.

178
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,700
This Court orders that the prime accused Sachidanandan...

179
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,040
... be sent into Central Jail to serve out a double life sentence.

180
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,290
Taking books in the dark?

181
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,620
Can't you switch on the light?

182
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,330
I didn't realize that it became dark.

183
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,910
Don't you know Sachidanandan can see in the dark too?

184
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Carry on.

185
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,080
My big brother is so handsome!

186
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,950
How could they keep you behind bars for so long?

187
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,790
Come.

188
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,160
There's an American TV series called Prison Break by Paul Scheuring.

189
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,200
It's the story of a younger brother who commits a petty crime to get into the jail,

190
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,870
and breaks free from there with his big brother.

191
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,160
If they hadn't released you this time as well, I would also have done the same.

192
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Get in, brother.

193
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,500
Didn't I tell you?

194
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,000
That there will be a huge celebration on the day you return home?

195
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,700
It's Vishnu's wedding tomorrow.

196
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,160
The bride is also a doctor.

197
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Her name is Vandana.

198
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,450
He was adamant that he'll wait until you come back from jail.

199
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,830
That's why the wedding got delayed.

200
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,950
Sachiyetta!

201
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,290
Pareekar!

202
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Khan?

203
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,950
Ghani?

204
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,750
Didn't I tell you that he'll recognize us at first sight?

205
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,580
Who wouldn't recognize us from the shady looks on our faces?

206
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,660
No need plural. Talk for yourself.

207
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,160
As if your faces look divine!

208
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Manu...

209
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
This is Pareekar.

210
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,450
Khan.

211
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
Ghani.

212
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
They were with me at the juvenile home.

213
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,830
My younger brother, Manu.

214
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,250
Hello. - Hello!

215
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,990
Have you come to take me to Mysore?

216
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,500
Sachiyetta, please come.

217
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,700
I'll be right back.

218
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,830
Have you decided to go home with your brother?

219
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,500
Where else can I go?

220
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Sachiyetta...

221
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,450
You should come with us.

222
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,160
Where? - To Bangalore.

223
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,290
Someone has given us a great offer there.

224
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,910
He's a drug dealer from Mumbai.

225
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,200
His name is Edwin Moses.

226
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,580
He's the one who deals drugs in Bangalore now.

227
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
It's deal worth Crores.

228
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,580
The offer for us is 50-50.

229
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,580
I just got out of here.

230
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,000
You want to send me back inside?

231
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,330
We don't have to do it for long.

232
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,830
When we make enough money for us, we will stop this.

233
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,990
We will invest the money somewhere abroad.

234
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,290
Then we will settle down there.

235
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,580
Vijay Mallya, Choksi and Nirav Modi have all fled and living happily, right?

236
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,580
Like that...

237
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,290
I will find a job which will earn us a good living.

238
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,580
I will call you after that.

239
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,910
That's not going to happen.

240
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Here.

241
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,290
Keep this. - What is this?

242
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,620
Our mobile numbers. You would need it.

243
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,910
Don't get into unnecessary troubles and invite danger.

244
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,990
I'll call you.

245
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Hello.

246
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,500
He rejected the offer and left.

247
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,040
But I know very well how to bring him on our path.

248
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,990
Come, brother.

249
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,990
Him and his bag!

250
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,000
Give me that bag. - No.

251
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,870
Come, brother.

252
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,870
Come!

253
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,370
Brother...

254
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,910
Vishnu.

255
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Hey!

256
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
'If a lion comes to romance a deer'

257
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,160
'What do I say? There's a fire in the heart'

258
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,040
'If a lion comes to romance a deer'

259
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,080
'What do I say? There's a fire in the heart'

260
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,080
'Haven't I told you long back? Haven't you seen it yourself?'

261
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,000
'Once you love a girl, anyone would turn into a deer'

262
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,750
'Tell me, you can't stay without seeing her?'

263
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,790
'Don't you never get tired of speaking to her?'

264
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,540
'Even if you touch her, it's not enough for you?'

265
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,990
'Is there a mountain of sweetness, beside your heart?'

266
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,040
'If a lion comes to romance a deer'

267
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,080
'What do I say? There's a fire in the heart'

268
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,540
'Without pinching or provoking'

269
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,750
'Without hurting with sharp words or even a look'

270
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,200
'Without pinching or provoking'

271
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,500
'Without hurting with sharp words or even a look'

272
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,500
'Without losing the smile on your lovely lips'

273
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,040
'Your sweetheart will protect you, o deer'

274
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,040
'Tell me, you can't stay without seeing her?'

275
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,700
'Don't you never get tired of speaking to her?'

276
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,990
'Even if you touch her, it's not enough for you?'

277
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,500
'Is there a mountain of sweetness, beside your heart?'

278
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,700
'Without keeping you down, or on my shoulder'

279
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,660
'Without letting you go out of my sight'

280
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,700
'Without keeping you down, or on my shoulder'

281
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,080
'Without letting you go out of my sight'

282
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,370
'Without letting even a speck fall on your lovely body'

283
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,500
'He will stand guard, without blinking an eye'

284
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,540
'Tell me, you can't stay without seeing her?'

285
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,500
'Don't you never get tired of speaking to her?'

286
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,700
'Even if you touch her, it's not enough for you?'

287
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,910
'Is there a mountain of sweetness, beside your heart?'

288
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,620
I'll send them off and come.

289
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,910
Brother...

290
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Brother...

291
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,040
Where did he go?

292
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,820
Sachiyetta!

293
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,660
What is it? - Brother is missing.

294
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,410
I took him to the room, but now he's not there.

295
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,100
Grand-uncle, did you see Sachiyettan?

296
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,120
He has reached only today, right? I can see him anytime, right?

297
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,790
Oh my God!

298
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,620
Why wake him up now? Let him sleep.

299
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,450
He was sent to sleep, but now he's missing!

300
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,650
Then check inside the well, or on branches of trees.

301
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,760
He has come after a double life sentence, right?

302
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,790
Such people usually commit suicide.

303
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,280
Can you keep quiet, uncle?

304
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,930
Is this how you talk?

305
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,330
Usually.. - Uncle, please! Please!

306
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,870
Manu!!

307
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,750
I heard some sound from there.

308
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,470
He is here.

309
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,910
Etta...

310
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
Bro, it's me.

311
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
It's me, Manu.

312
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,410
What is this, Etta?

313
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,870
You're sleeping here?

314
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,950
I wasn't able to sleep lying there.

315
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,580
I am used to lying down like this.

316
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Come, Etta.

317
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Come.

318
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,120
Thank you for coming, Doctor. - Hello!

319
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,870
Doctor Sudhakar Reddy. - Hello.

320
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,040
And his wife. - How are you?

321
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,290
Sachiyetta!

322
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,870
Sachiyetta, it's me. - Hi Gemini.

323
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,410
Etta, this is my elder sister. Jameela.

324
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,160
Hi. - Namaste..

325
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,750
I am their father. Kalyan Kumar.

326
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,750
This is her son. Pappu.

327
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,330
Namaste.

328
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,120
What are you all doing here?

329
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,750
Sorry.

330
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,250
You've come for the marriage, right?

331
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,160
I've also come for the marriage.

332
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,200
Okay then.

333
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,870
Okay Sachiyetta. Carry on.

334
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,250
We'll be over there.

335
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,540
Why is he like this?

336
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,870
He was abroad for a while.

337
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
That's why.

338
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Sachiyetta!

339
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,250
Etta!

340
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,870
Aren't you ready yet? - Yes.

341
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,120
Sachidanandan, open the door!

342
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,790
Why are you sweating like this?

343
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,120
It was really hot inside.

344
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,080
Hot? In this AC room?

345
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,750
Then it must be the AC's fault.

346
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,000
Come, Etta. Dad is looking for you.

347
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,580
You carry on. I'll come after some time.

348
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,500
After some time?

349
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,450
I'll come slowly after all the rush.

350
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,120
What is he saying?

351
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,660
After the rush, why do you have to come? To pick chairs?

352
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,870
Etta...

353
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,330
Why do you have to get tensed seeing a crowd?

354
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,160
If you keep hiding like this, you'll never get over this fear.

355
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,700
Manu, go and arrange everything quickly.

356
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,120
I will handle him.

357
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,250
Welcome! - Hello!

358
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,750
Go inside. - Prathapan!

359
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,120
This is Mohan's eldest son,

360
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,450
Sachidanandan.

361
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,790
Hello!

362
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
How are you?

363
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,200
This is the bride Vandana's father, Prathapachandran.

364
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,620
He is the ADGP here.

365
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Welcome, sir. Please come.

366
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,500
Mohanachandran. Vishnu's father. - Hello!

367
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,660
Nice meeting you, sir.

368
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,910
This is my son, Sachidanandan. - Hi.

369
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,770
And he is my uncle...

370
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,810
Achyutha Kurup. - Hello.

371
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,750
Please come, sir.

372
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,560
Why did you salute him?

373
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,370
When we see a police officer, we should salute him.

374
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,580
That's what we do in jail.

375
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,170
This is not a jail, and you're not a prisoner now.

376
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,690
They are all guests who have come for the wedding.

377
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,660
Nice meeting you, sir. - Nice meeting you.

378
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,890
This is my son, Sachidanandan.

379
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,540
Hello. - Please come.

380
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,250
Dad...

381
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
I need your permission to drink a glass of water.

382
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Can I go?

383
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,830
Go ahead! - Sir!

384
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,870
Sir... - Well...

385
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,120
Drink a glass of water?

386
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,290
Okay sir.

387
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
Okay sir.

388
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,290
He'll drink even water only after testing!

389
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,880
Must have been a high-class life over there.

390
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Sir...

391
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,830
Hey!

392
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,370
Sir...

393
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,290
I need a glass of water.

394
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,450
Did you call me sir, sir? - Yes.

395
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,410
I can happily die now.

396
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,450
Drink it, sir.

397
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,910
One more glass? - Why not?

398
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,160
What is this? Drinking competition?

399
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,080
Quenched your thirst, right? - Yes. - Come.

400
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Keep it there.

401
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
Dad...

402
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,540
I need permission to go and pee.

403
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,000
I knew it when I saw you drinking all that water.

404
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,290
The toilet is over there. Go! Go!

405
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,040
Why is he asking permission for everything?

406
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,620
He thinks that he is still in jail.

407
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,160
Throw the flowers.

408
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,990
Go, uncle.

409
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,160
Bless you!

410
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,160
Go, Ettan.

411
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,290
Go! - I'm not going.

412
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,580
Well.. I...

413
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,290
Remove your slippers. - What?

414
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,790
Remove your slippers.

415
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
Bless them.

416
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Okay. See you.

417
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Okay.

418
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Sir.

419
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Vishnu...

420
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,250
Your brother was in the police, right?

421
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,540
Not in the police.

422
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,620
But he was at a place, closely connected to the police. I'll tell you later.

423
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Kalyanji...

424
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Just a minute.

425
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,330
What is it, dear? - Dad...

426
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,830
I saw that officer.

427
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,410
Many officers have come.

428
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,250
Which officer are you talking about?

429
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,250
The officer of that commando group, who saved me from captivity!

430
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,160
Where did you see him? - Here.

431
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,370
He is Vishnu's brother. Sachidanandettan.

432
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,700
No! It won't be him.

433
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
You must be mistaken.

434
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,750
No, dad. It's him. I am sure.

435
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,080
Vandana, everyone is looking for you there.

436
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,830
Dad, I'll call you. Bye.

437
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,450
Come.

438
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,750
Where did you go?

439
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,830
Come and stand here.

440
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,790
Where's that noise from? - From the garage, I think.

441
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,990
Sir...

442
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,450
There's a thief in the garage. - He broke the lock of the shutter & got in.

443
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,870
Look at the state of the lock!

444
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,790
Sir! Sir!

445
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,290
Did you hear that sound? He is inside.

446
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,540
I think he's opening the safe.

447
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,910
Safe is inside the garage or what? - That's true.

448
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,620
What? - Why is that idiot trying to open a safe which is not there?

449
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,080
See! He's a car thief!

450
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,620
If he's a thief, why is he resting below the car? Can't he leave with the car?

451
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,330
He must be stealing each part individually.

452
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,330
Just make him jump out. Rest we'll handle.

453
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,950
Who is it?

454
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,990
Be careful. He would have some weapon.

455
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,250
Come out!

456
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,990
Why did you go under this?

457
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,870
I was trying to repair our car.

458
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,910
You're repairing the car in the dark?

459
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,290
When I went under it, there was light. I didn't realize that it became dark.

460
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,120
Enough of repairing. Get up and come!

461
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,830
Our car... - Okay.

462
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,290
Manu, take him to his room.

463
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,330
Come, Etta.

464
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,410
Spanner?

465
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,000
Bloody spanner!

466
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,000
I have seen this Sachidanandettan earlier.

467
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,950
Haven't I told you that a terrorist group kidnapped me

468
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,750
while I was studying in a school at Ootty?

469
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,250
And that the police rescued me through a commando operation?

470
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,750
Sachiyettan was present in that commando group.

471
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,450
What are you saying?

472
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Never!

473
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,250
Our Sachiyettan...

474
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,870
... was in jail....

475
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,830
... for the past 24 years.

476
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,000
Why are you standing here, sir? Go forward.

477
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,990
Move! Move! Come here. Go forward, sir.

478
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,750
Don't interrupt the queue.

479
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,160
First come, first served.

480
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,330
Those who are late, should stand at the back. Go!

481
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,120
Look at his decency!

482
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,620
This is why everyone says that we should study abroad.

483
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,700
There's no difference between boss & worker there.

484
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,160
Everyone is the same, right?

485
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,990
Socialism!

486
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,450
Socialism is when we can sit along with the bosses and have food.

487
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,040
What are you doing, Etta?

488
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,950
This boy doesn't know what socialism is.

489
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,160
Come. - What is it?

490
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,700
Are you having food, standing in the queue with servants?

491
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,870
Sit here.

492
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,290
Good morning, Vishnu and Vandana. - Good morning.

493
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,830
Morning, Sachiyetta!

494
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,160
Good morning, Etta. - Good morning.

495
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,410
Good morning. - Good morning.

496
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,870
Good morning. - Good morning.

497
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,700
Are you an LP school student or what?

498
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,040
To keep saying 'Good morning'?

499
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,790
No one should say 'Good morning' hereafter.

500
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,250
Yes. - Okay!

501
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,410
Etta...

502
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,700
She has been pestering me since last night.

503
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,370
Get me that curry.

504
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,200
She's saying that you've rescued her from some terrorist group.

505
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,830
I needed Manu to rescue me.

506
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,870
So how can I rescue someone else?

507
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,620
Are you done? - I'm full.

508
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,830
Are you also done? - Yes.

509
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
Vandana!

510
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,330
What have you done?

511
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,120
Do you know how he got this scar?

512
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,990
He got this while rescuing me.

513
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,750
Tell me, Etta. Am I lying? say it!

514
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
She's not lying.

515
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
It was me, indeed.

516
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,370
The jail authorities who realized that I could see in the dark as well,

517
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,830
started utilizing me for that purpose.

518
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,580
Every night, they took me to different places.

519
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,580
They gave me a lot of training!

520
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:21,080
Prisoners from many jails were also with me.

521
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,200
We were equipped to do anything, with that rigorous training given to us.

522
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,750
We were taken to many different places.

523
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,540
And that operation was one among them.

524
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,750
Help!

525
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,080
Somebody help me!

526
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Help me!

527
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,870
Help me!

528
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,500
We were sent unarmed to confront armed opponents.

529
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,830
Many of us don't come back alive, at many instances.

530
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,410
When they take us like this, they create reports saying that we escaped from jail.

531
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,080
Later, rotten bodies of those who were killed, will be found at random places.

532
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,660
With that, everything will end.

533
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,870
Who's going to enquire about prisoners whom nobody wants?

534
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,080
Who's going to question them?

535
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,250
Scoundrels!

536
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,540
They kept you behind bars for so long, for all this?

537
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,000
And they were citing some damn Intelligence report as the reason!

538
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,200
Vandana...

539
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,660
I'm so sorry.

540
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,290
But they are devils. Dirty devils.

541
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,660
Including your dad!

542
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,410
We cannot take this lightly, sir.

543
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,040
This graffiti might be a warning too.

544
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,200
From Edwin Moses.

545
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,290
Edwin Moses? - Maybe.

546
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,120
There are such writings on every crime spot that he is involved in.

547
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,620
Sorry, Vedantham. Sit down.

548
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,870
Tell me, dear.

549
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,330
Dad, you use prisoners as suicide warriors, is it?

550
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,040
Where the hell did you hear this utter nonsense?

551
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,700
The truth always hurts.

552
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:02,950
What truth?

553
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,620
Someone has misled you. Hang up!

554
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,830
We'll talk in person.

555
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,410
Vedantham, I told you. He's a pain in the ass.

556
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,330
Sorry sir. I didn't get you.

557
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,540
Who else? Sachidanandan.

558
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,000
Your son-in-law's big brother.

559
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,750
I checked his history, sir.

560
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,120
An obedient prisoner.

561
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,330
Well behaved.

562
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,120
There wasn't a single complaint against him in the jail, sir.

563
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,040
In fact, he's a very talented man.

564
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,450
His skills are better than all our commandos.

565
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,410
We have used him for many risky operations.

566
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,910
That's why the police didn't release him, even after his jail term was over.

567
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,700
And his younger brother had to influence higher authorities

568
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,200
to release him from jail.

569
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,500
All that must be true.

570
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,040
If he says this to people outside, what would be the image of the department?

571
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,580
He won't do that, sir.

572
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,950
Then how did Vandana know this?

573
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,120
That... I don't know, sir.

574
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,950
And you said that she hasn't forgotten the person who rescued her, right?

575
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,200
With your permission, sir.

576
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,620
I'll talk to him.

577
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,700
I'll see to it that no more information leaks from him.

578
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,790
Good morning, sir. - Morning.

579
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,870
Sit down.

580
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,950
No, I'll stand.

581
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,830
You're not a prisoner now to stand in fear. Sit down.

582
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,500
It's been 3 years since I came here from Mumbai.

583
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,790
Before that, I was in Delhi.

584
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,790
Since I killed many notorious criminals in encounters over there,

585
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,160
in the eyes of the leaders, I became an offender.

586
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,790
And thus... they transferred me.

587
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,040
What would you like to have, sir?

588
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,120
I was posted here to finish off the drug mafia.

589
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,700
Within 3 years, I made the whole city clean.

590
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,370
I didn't arrest anyone involved in drug trafficking.

591
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,250
I didn't send anyone to jail either.

592
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,660
I killed all of them in encounters.

593
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,750
There are complains and investigations against me for that.

594
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
I just don't care.

595
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,700
Now, my problem is something else.

596
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,290
Drug mafia has returned strongly.

597
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,040
And it is being controlled by one Mr. Edwin Moses.

598
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,450
No one has seen him till date.

599
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,080
People who work for him are not goons or criminals.

600
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,040
Just normal people.

601
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,540
He traps them and makes them do all this.

602
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,000
Only when they are caught,

603
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,950
they realize that what they had with them were drugs.

604
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,500
Why am I saying all this to you, Sachidanandan?

605
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,580
Because, I would need your help to capture Edwin Moses.

606
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,250
Some days back, a container that belongs to Edwin Moses went missing.

607
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,080
It was full of drugs.

608
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,580
To know who stole it, and to get it back from them,

609
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,330
trained criminals have been recruited.

610
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,950
This is where I need your help.

611
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,660
Sachidanandan, who lived in the jail for 24 years,

612
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,500
would know all the criminals of this city very well.

613
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,660
Using that connection,

614
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,370
it would be easy to find out who all are working for Edwin Moses.

615
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,910
While in jail, you have helped the department a lot.

616
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,910
That's why I'm asking you.

617
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,500
Sir, as you said earlier...

618
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,160
I am not a prisoner now...

619
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,250
... to obey the police orders, right?

620
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,450
I spent a good part of my lifetime inside the jail.

621
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,370
Forgetting that time which I don't even like to remember,

622
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,290
I wish to live with my family.

623
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,500
So please don't call me for such things, sir.

624
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,410
This is not my job, either.

625
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Okay.

626
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,290
I just tried requesting you.

627
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,080
Forget all this, Sachidanandan. - Sir.

628
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,410
You can go. - Sir.

629
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Sachidanandan!

630
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,990
Sir... - Things you don't like to remember...

631
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,120
... should remain the same way. That would be better.

632
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,500
If you narrate your tales of bravado in the jail to anyone hereafter...

633
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,500
You know, right?

634
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,580
Police will send you to jail again.

635
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,330
And you'll never see the outside world after that.

636
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,160
I know, sir.

637
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,080
I know that very well.

638
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,250
Who is he, Etta?

639
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,660
I am Vedantham IPS.

640
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,620
Anti-Narcotic and Drugs Preventive Special Officer.

641
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,330
I called Sachidanandan for off-records information...

642
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,540
... about a couple of prisoners in Mangalore jail.

643
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,500
He's your younger brother, right? Manu!

644
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,830
Hi. Nice meeting you. - Hi.

645
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,160
You guys can carry on. - Okay. Bye.

646
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,790
How did your shoes get paint on them?

647
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,580
Right! Where did it come from?

648
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,700
What all do you notice, Etta?

649
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,790
It wasn't me who noticed.

650
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,160
It was that police officer.

651
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,250
I'm done looking. You may look.

652
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,700
I didn't come to see the album.

653
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,370
When I saw you sitting here alone, I thought I'll come talk to you.

654
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,700
Yes, we can talk!

655
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,410
Like the operation in which you rescued me,

656
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,160
where else has the police taken you?

657
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,950
Who? - Police.

658
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,790
I don't remember anything now.

659
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,870
Dad was looking for me. Let me go.

660
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,040
Etta, one minute!

661
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,910
I was looking for you!

662
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,950
I spoke to my professor.

663
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,200
We can file a writ against misusing the prisoners like this.

664
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,870
Why file a writ? I'm not a prisoner now, right?

665
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,200
They made you do it, while you were a prisoner, right?

666
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,410
Even when I spoke to Manu, he also had the same opinion.

667
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,080
Can you please sit? I need to know some more things.

668
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,370
I need to go to the toilet. Shall I say it later? - Okay.

669
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,830
I'll wait here. - No.. Waiting...?

670
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:02,790
You needn't wait.

671
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,870
I'll be quite late to come out of the toilet.

672
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,580
Doesn't matter how late you are. I'll wait here.

673
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,370
Hey! I'm going outside. Are you coming?

674
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,500
No! I have to collect some details from Sachiyettan.

675
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,750
You carry on. - Bye! - Bye!

676
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:38,870
Sachiyettan?

677
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:46,040
Where are you going? - I just came out for a walk.

678
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,250
Then you wait here. I'll park this car and come.

679
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,660
I'll wait here then. - Okay.

680
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,330
They've built such a huge house. Why don't they have a lift to go upstairs?

681
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,580
But they don't have such good ideas!

682
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,660
Oh! You were here, sir?

683
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,040
Oh! You were meditating? Sorry.

684
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,830
He's deep in meditation!

685
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,540
You're still waiting for Sachiyettan here?

686
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,290
He was standing on the road there.

687
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,290
I said we'll go together, parked the car and went back, but he was missing.

688
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,750
On the road? - Yes. - How?

689
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,990
Sachiyettan went into the toilet before you went outside.

690
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,540
He hasn't come out even now.

691
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,540
Gemini, we spoke on the road.

692
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,830
Madam!

693
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,040
The one you were looking for, is at the terrace.

694
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,330
Who? - Sachi sir.

695
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,790
He's deep in meditation upstairs. Go and see.

696
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:33,790
Come!

697
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,950
Will you be cursed if you disturb his meditation?

698
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:47,910
Madam!

699
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
There.

700
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,580
I came downstairs after seeing Sachi sir sitting on that mat and meditating!

701
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,290
Then where is he now? - Where is he?

702
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,500
Where is he?

703
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,450
How can he disappear so quickly?

704
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:06,870
Look!

705
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,910
Sachi sir is boxing downstairs.

706
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:10,370
Come, I'll show you.

707
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,750
Well, he...

708
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,160
Come, look.

709
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,870
I called you after seeing him boxing with this!

710
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,200
Now he's missing.

711
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,750
Where did he go?

712
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,660
What happened to all of you?

713
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,540
See! He's still in the toilet.

714
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,910
Hey! That's someone else.

715
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,410
Sachi sir is not in there. I am sure.

716
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,580
Why argue? We can ask, right?

717
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,660
Sachi sir!

718
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,620
That's not you who's inside, right?

719
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,620
What stupidity are you asking?

720
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,700
What's everyone doing here?

721
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,200
Vishnuetta, Sachiyettan went into the toilet, while I was here.

722
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,910
Vandana says she saw him on the road.

723
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,660
Velappan says he was at the terrace.

724
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,500
He's saying that he was at the courtyard.

725
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,500
But Sachiyettan hasn't left the toilet either.

726
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,830
Ettan is a magician or what?

727
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,040
To appear at different places at the same time?

728
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,120
Let's see.

729
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,620
Who is inside?

730
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,290
Open the door.

731
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,410
What are you all doing here?

732
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,250
When did you go in here?

733
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:25,990
A while ago.

734
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,700
Then how did Vandana see you on the road and talk to you?

735
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,620
It was me who talked to her.

736
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,910
So the one who meditated at the terrace?

737
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,080
That was also me.

738
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,160
The one who was boxing here?

739
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,540
Me... Me, again.

740
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,660
Etta...

741
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,500
What was it downstairs?

742
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,870
Manukkutta, can you send me back to the jail?

743
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,950
What are you saying?

744
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,370
How much we had to struggle to get you released from jail!

745
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,500
Why do you have to think like this now?

746
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,950
Did anyone create any problem here?

747
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:30,700
I am the problem.

748
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,540
I'm not right for this place.

749
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,580
This world is not for me.

750
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,250
I'm only used to obeying orders.

751
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,660
I can't do anything by myself.

752
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,410
For everything, I need permission.

753
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,910
It's not the world I left from, 24 years back.

754
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:58,950
It's only noise and rush everywhere.

755
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,120
What should be spoken to whom...

756
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,990
How I should behave... I don't know all that.

757
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,290
Did anyone say anything to you here?

758
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,790
No!

759
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:16,660
That Vedantham threatened me not to disclose old stories of my jail term.

760
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,290
And everyone here wants to know only that.

761
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,160
I can understand.

762
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:25,790
Do one thing. You needn't stay here anymore.

763
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,950
You can come and stay with me in Bangalore city.

764
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,750
I will talk to Dad and Vishnu.

765
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,160
Anyway, Gemini and I are going back to Bangalore tomorrow.

766
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,330
I'll reach there and arrange a house.

767
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,830
We'll figure out a business that suits you as well.

768
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,410
Wait and watch.

769
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,950
We'll have a great time in Bangalore.

770
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,200
Okay?

771
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:51,160
Etta.. So as I said...

772
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,500
As soon as I reach Bangalore, I will find a house.

773
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,870
Within 2 days, I'll arrange everything there, and come and take you there.

774
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:57,910
Okay, Dad? - Yes.

775
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:00,410
You go and stay with him for some time there.

776
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,080
Everything will be all right.

777
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,660
I bought this phone for you.

778
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,910
Whatever you speak on it, will be recorded.

779
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,250
And...

780
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,830
... you just have to touch here, to listen to it again.

781
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,580
So, you needn't ask permission to anyone for anything.

782
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:17,410
Whatever it is, I will call you and tell you about it.

783
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,620
Just keep listening to it again and again, and do it.

784
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,410
Bye, Dad. - Bye, dear.

785
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,700
See you soon. - Vandana!

786
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Take care.

787
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:29,750
Bye.

788
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,990
Etta, bye. - Bye.

789
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,250
Vandana, Dad, bye... - Bye!

790
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,370
Bye!

791
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,290
Sir, a boss like you can never be found!

792
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,160
You are a role model for all the bosses.

793
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,750
The stupid bosses here should learn from you!

794
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,370
The phone is ringing!

795
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,580
Phone!

796
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,620
Oh! It's mine?

797
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,370
Hello!

798
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,870
Oh!

799
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,950
Great!

800
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,870
Sir, it's your phone.

801
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,450
It's my phone?

802
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,290
It's Manukkuttan.

803
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,450
Hello! - Etta...

804
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:26,450
When you didn't pick up, I got scared that you went off somewhere.

805
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,500
I didn't realize that the phone was for me.

806
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,540
Did you reach Bangalore? - No, Etta.

807
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,950
We just reached the city border.

808
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,410
We'll reach in half an hour.

809
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:41,160
Etta, one minute. Please hold on.

810
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,660
Full tank!

811
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,910
We're filling petrol now.

812
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:10,790
Check the air.

813
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,450
Manu...

814
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,330
He's taking a video of us on his phone.

815
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,540
Hello! What the hell are you doing?

816
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,750
Don't take our videos!

817
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,500
Manukkutta, what's the problem?

818
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,250
Nothing, Etta. I'll call you back now.

819
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,370
Hey! You don't get it, huh?

820
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,160
Stop it!

821
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,450
Manu!

822
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,540
What is it, Etta?

823
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,250
Vishnu, Manu had called some time back.

824
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,200
There was some problem at the petrol bunk.

825
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,330
He hung up saying he'll call me back.

826
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,450
When I called back, he didn't pick up, and now his phone is off.

827
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:29,950
Why are you getting tensed?

828
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,450
This is usual with phones.

829
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,790
Charge gets over. Phone gets switched off...

830
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:36,200
This... is not like that. Look!

831
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,870
Did you hear this?

832
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,870
Listen... - Hey! Hello!

833
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,330
What the hell are you doing?

834
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,290
Don't take our videos!

835
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,160
Manukkutta!

836
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,500
What's the problem? - Nothing, Etta. I'll call you back.

837
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,250
Vandana, just call Gemini.

838
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:02,450
It was ringing.

839
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,040
Suddenly the phone was switched off.

840
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,950
That's what I was saying...

841
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,660
There is some problem. Let's go and see.

842
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,160
Where would they be, Etta?

843
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,450
He said that the petrol bunk is half an hour away from the city.

844
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,700
Let's go and check, please.

845
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,290
Come. - Call and inform your Dad quickly.

846
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,450
Dad, Manu and Gemini left to Bangalore in a car.

847
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,290
Something has happened to them on the way.

848
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,410
Nothing to worry.

849
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,750
Come.

850
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,540
Only if Gemini gains consciousness,

851
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,450
we'd be able to know what happened, and who kidnapped Manu.

852
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:13,160
This inhaling device... Is this Manu's or Gemini's?

853
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
It belongs to Manu.

854
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,580
He has wheezing.

855
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,370
Only if he inhales the medicine from this, he'd be able to breathe in the morning.

856
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,080
Which medicine is he using in it? It's Asthalin Rotacaps.

857
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:28,910
I got this from the spot.

858
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,080
Must have fallen during the attack.

859
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Dear...

860
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
Hello! Who is it?

861
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:24,660
Pareekar... - Yes!

862
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,370
This is Sachidanandan.

863
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,660
Sachiyettan! Ghani, it's Sachiyettan!

864
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,870
Sachiyetta, why have you called at midnight?

865
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,750
Where are you now?

866
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,830
I need to meet you urgently.

867
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,040
Give me the chart. - Chart, please.

868
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,370
Check the vitals. - Give me that.

869
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,540
No idea who did this?

870
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:01,200
Shall we get hold of everyone who has enmity towards Manu?

871
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,870
If enmity was the only reason,

872
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:06,830
they would have left him also on the road, like her.

873
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:08,580
It's not that.

874
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,080
They have kidnapped Manu, because they need him alive.

875
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:20,120
I made Vishnu buy this from here.

876
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,830
Manu cannot survive without this inhaler and medicine.

877
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,080
So the people who have kidnapped him, will have to buy these.

878
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:34,290
How do we know how many medical shops are open in the night, in this city?

879
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,750
I'll find that out now itself.

880
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:41,330
You should find out if someone is buying this medicine along with an inhaler,

881
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,040
from a medical shop.

882
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,080
That's all, right? Sachiyetta, give it to me.

883
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,620
Pareekar, I'm sharing this on our group.

884
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,450
Call the admin Muthan and ask him to share it to everyone.

885
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,120
Hello! Why are you calling so late in the night?

886
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,120
Hey Muthan! Khan has sent a photo on our group now.

887
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,620
You should share it with everyone immediately.

888
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,580
Send each one to watch every medical shop that is open in the night.

889
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:20,620
If someone buys an inhaler and the medicine from the photo,

890
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,370
inform me immediately.

891
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,830
What's the matter?

892
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,950
I'll tell you in person. - Okay.

893
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,870
Sachiyetta, don't worry. Leave this to us.

894
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,950
Our boys are there all over the city.

895
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,330
They will be around every medical shop, for the entire night.

896
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,580
Come, bro.

897
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,790
Do you have a rivolizer?

898
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:57,790
One rivolizer and one Asthalin Rotacaps.

899
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,620
How much? - 300.

900
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,410
It's Muthan.

901
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,250
Muthan, tell me.

902
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,410
Listen...

903
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,540
One man bought both the items from the same medical shop.

904
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:39,330
But before my people got there, he got away.

905
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,750
I've found the guy from the CCTV camera.

906
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,160
I'm sending it to you now.

907
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:48,580
He lives in house no.13 at Indira Nagar Colony.

908
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,540
His name is Prince.

909
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,200
Check the videos on his phone.

910
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,290
Whom did you buy this for?

911
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,910
I bought it for myself.

912
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,250
Are you lying, you rascal?

913
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,990
Where is Manu? Where is he?

914
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,370
Which Manu?

915
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:43,990
I don't know any Manu.

916
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:47,370
Sachiyetta...

917
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,080
Check this out.

918
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,580
Manu!

919
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,330
Gemini!

920
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:28,290
Sachiyetta, enough!

921
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,120
If he dies, we won't be able to find Manu.

922
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,120
You rascal, if you don't say the truth, we'll put you to sleep here.

923
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,790
Where are the others?

924
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,580
Where is Manu?

925
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:48,870
We left them both there itself.

926
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,990
I don't know what happened after that.

927
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,540
Are you lying, you rascal?

928
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:57,330
What did you do to Manu?

929
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,540
Say it! - Pareekar!

930
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
He won't say it.

931
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,290
I know how to make him say it.

932
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,870
Ghani, call Khan.

933
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,990
Hello Khan... - Hello Ghani!

934
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,500
That D'Souza's daughter Electricia is with me.

935
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:20,370
Not Electricia... Letitia.

936
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,620
Letitia it is. then.

937
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,870
Dear, Daddy is online. Just say hi.

938
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,500
Hi Daddy!

939
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,910
Do you want more ice cream?

940
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,790
More?

941
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,790
She is such a greedy child!

942
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,830
Haven't you bought Ice cream for her ever?

943
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:35,290
Bro, one more ice cream.

944
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,410
All my money is over buying ice cream for her.

945
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:40,410
Tell me quickly. Where should I throw the girl?

946
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,410
Lake or sea?

947
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,410
Keep 5 or 6 more ready.

948
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:44,450
She's so greedy!

949
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,540
Dear sir, don't do anything to my child!

950
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:48,870
I will tell you.

951
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,040
We did all this for Shetty Sir.

952
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,160
We handed over that boy to Shetty sir.

953
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,080
We don't know what happened after that.

954
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,410
This is Shetty.

955
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:30,040
This is his family.

956
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,450
This is his daughter. Arya Shetty.

957
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,500
Morning sir. A police officer is waiting for you.

958
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,330
This Shetty is no ordinary guy.

959
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:51,450
Government, police or even famous goons will stand still if they hear his name.

960
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,580
Yes, Mr. Officer.

961
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,370
Have you left the drug mafia and begun chasing me?

962
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,080
I'm not the one who caused that.

963
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,290
It's you.

964
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:04,750
ADGP Prathapachandra Menon's relative, that boy and his girlfriend were attacked...

965
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,660
and that boy was kidnapped...

966
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:10,120
I've got information that you were behind all this.

967
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:13,200
Then ask where he is, to the people who gave that information to you.

968
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,410
Then go and save him!

969
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,910
Why should you waste your time?

970
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,410
We won't be able to confront Shetty directly, Sachiyetta.

971
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:22,080
However mighty he might be,

972
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:24,540
I want my Manu back.

973
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,040
You have many informers in the police

974
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,580
to update you about our moves constantly, right?

975
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,620
You're saying this out of that arrogance, right?

976
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,120
I know.

977
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,250
You have spies among my people too, right?

978
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,370
So don't take out that arrogance on me either.

979
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,750
Mr. Vedantham...

980
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,540
Even if your entire force tries, you're not going to get that boy back.

981
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,450
Shall we seek the help of Edwin Moses?

982
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:00,370
That's not necessary. I know how to save my brother.

983
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,580
Ask your ADGP to forget him.

984
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,290
He has kidnapped the one who is dearest to me.

985
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:13,990
Instead...

986
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,290
What was his daughter's name?

987
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,950
Arya Shetty.

988
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:50,290
It was somewhere here.

989
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:56,040
Yes, incense.

990
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,540
How much?

991
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,200
125 Rupees, sir.

992
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,330
For this incense? - Yes.

993
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,750
That's a fiery price!

994
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:13,450
Be careful. It will burn on its own.

995
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:18,750
Sorry. - It's okay.

996
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,120
Oops.

997
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:22,410
Sorry.

998
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,660
Sorry, uncle.

999
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,040
You were blind, right?

1000
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,290
Daddy, I don't need any bodyguards hereafter.

1001
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:34,450
Idiots! They humiliated me by stealing watches from there.

1002
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:45,950
Which is this phone?

1003
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,950
How did it come here?

1004
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,870
Hello! - Madam, it's D'Souza.

1005
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,790
Shetty sir is not picking my call.

1006
01:22:58,410 --> 01:22:59,540
That's why I had to do this.

1007
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,950
Please pass the phone to Shetty sir.

1008
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,080
Daddy, it's D'Souza.

1009
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:11,950
Hello!. - Sir...

1010
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,250
I kept calling you to tell you an urgent matter.

1011
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:18,620
Arya Madam should be moved to a safe place immediately.

1012
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,660
They might kidnap Madam.

1013
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:25,790
D'Souza...

1014
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,370
You come here quickly.

1015
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,120
Bring your people too. - Okay sir.

1016
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,580
What is it, Daddy?

1017
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,620
Nothing, dear.

1018
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,870
Get ready for a journey.

1019
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,500
Good morning, sir.

1020
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,330
Hello sir. Hi madam.

1021
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:21,160
Don't look! It was me who dropped the phone in your bag.

1022
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,200
D'Souza told me to.

1023
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:23,580
Come, dear. - Give it.

1024
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,540
D'Souza...

1025
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,120
You should drive the car.

1026
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,750
Take one more person with you.

1027
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:30,660
The jeep will keep following you.

1028
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:33,370
Straight to the airport. Everything is arranged there.

1029
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,700
Call me after you reach the airport. - Okay sir.

1030
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:38,870
Daddy.. - Okay, dear...

1031
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,200
They will take care of you. You will be safe.

1032
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,620
Go without any fear!

1033
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,290
Happy journey.

1034
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,540
Thank you daddy!

1035
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:47,830
Bye. See you. - Bye.

1036
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,040
Take care.

1037
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,750
Arya Shetty's phone.

1038
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,080
Oops! D'Souza, we have to go back.

1039
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,330
My phone is missing.

1040
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,950
Shetty sir kept the phone away, Madam.

1041
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,950
So that they don't track you.

1042
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,620
Oops.

1043
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,700
Shetty!

1044
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,990
Didn't I ask you to turn it off? Turn it off!

1045
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,450
Muthan, watch him.

1046
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,290
Until I tell you, don't let them go.

1047
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,120
Come here.

1048
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,660
Lie there.

1049
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,750
What about Shetty's daughter?

1050
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,750
She is with Pareekar and Ghani, outside.

1051
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:26,120
Awesome!

1052
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,990
Now Shetty will listen to us.

1053
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,200
You're done with me, right? Can't you return my child now?

1054
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:36,620
Your daughter has reached your house, without a scratch!

1055
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:39,830
Mummy!

1056
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,700
My dear...

1057
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:49,080
I'm not at all interested to go to Singapore. - Me too.

1058
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:52,700
I like travelling on trains, buses and auto rickshaws with friends.

1059
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:55,330
By friends, do you mean boyfriends?

1060
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,290
I don't have any boyfriends. I don't like boys at all.

1061
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Same pinch!

1062
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,540
I also don't like boys at all!

1063
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,410
Is it? - All my love is for girls.

1064
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,660
Oops. Get inside.

1065
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,790
Big brother is coming.

1066
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:10,790
Hello Madam.

1067
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:12,450
I am Khan. - Yes?

1068
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,910
Shetty sir has sent me in place of D'Souza.

1069
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,410
Oh. Thank you.

1070
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,540
Get in. - Okay.

1071
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,540
Hello Shetty sir.

1072
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,120
They are catching up.

1073
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,120
Block them!

1074
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:00,580
Oh no! Is it them, following us?

1075
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,790
Don't be scared, Madam.

1076
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,660
We will handle them.

1077
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:12,330
Yes!

1078
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:30,080
Wow!

1079
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,750
Yes!

1080
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,540
Yes!

1081
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,040
Yes!

1082
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,500
Bro!

1083
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,790
Wasn't for me?

1084
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:04,410
Yaay! - Yes!

1085
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,080
Big bro, I need to talk to Daddy.

1086
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:07,410
Oh God!

1087
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,450
Call Shetty sir.

1088
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,120
I'll be right back.

1089
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,830
Sort it quickly, you fool.

1090
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:27,910
Khan, let me get it ready. Wait.

1091
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,250
Give it.

1092
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,200
Shetty sir...

1093
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:37,950
Shetty sir, I'll put Madam on.

1094
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:43,870
Hello Daddy!

1095
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:45,830
This big bro is superb!

1096
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,580
A Pajero full of people came to kidnap me.

1097
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:50,500
But he faced them all alone.

1098
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,910
And... I don't want to go to Singapore.

1099
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:54,700
I talked to them.

1100
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,450
They have agreed to take me to places which I like.

1101
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,120
Please Daddy.

1102
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,200
Okay, dear. They will take care of you.

1103
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:04,250
You'll be safe. Go without any fear.

1104
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:06,410
Happy journey. - Thank you, Daddy. Love you!

1105
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,790
Love you too!

1106
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,250
Then what!

1107
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,580
He told me not to go to Singapore.

1108
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,250
He asked me to go wherever I like.

1109
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:15,410
Did he say so? - Of course!

1110
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,620
Will Arya Shetty Ma'am lie?

1111
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:18,500
Just listen to what Shetty sir says.

1112
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,080
Don't ask too many questions, okay?

1113
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:23,160
Okay done, then.

1114
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,790
Get inside! - Big bro!

1115
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:28,040
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1116
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:43,160
Excuse me, sir. - Yes.

1117
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,910
Bloody cheat! - Shetty sir...

1118
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:54,910
Shut up!

1119
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,500
How dare you come before me,

1120
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,830
after giving my daughter to them?

1121
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:02,950
They made me do this by kidnapping my daughter.

1122
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,620
Who is he?

1123
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,830
Is he that guy's man?

1124
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:10,040
Sir... I am everyone's man!

1125
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:12,790
That's why I was sent as a mediator to you.

1126
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,290
Shut up!

1127
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:19,250
Coming for mediation with me, bloody beggar?

1128
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:23,120
I know how to save my daughter, without your help.

1129
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,450
Never!

1130
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,950
Don't underestimate him.

1131
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,160
And he has sent this.

1132
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,330
To give it to you, sir.

1133
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,700
Hi Daddy. I am happy with them.

1134
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:43,500
And this big bro whom you sent? He is highly skilled and trained.

1135
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:47,120
Leave alone kidnapping. No one can even come close to me.

1136
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,660
That's how careful he is in taking me everywhere.

1137
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,870
Thank you daddy, for letting me go wherever I like.

1138
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,080
Thank you so much.

1139
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:26,660
'The poem on my lips, my moonlight'

1140
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:31,330
'Your shadows are on my eyelashes'

1141
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:36,080
'Is it your dreams or tears?'

1142
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:40,990
'Which is embracing me today... Didn't you see? Didn't you see?'

1143
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:45,040
'Are you spreading coolth and flowers?'

1144
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:50,250
'Slowly, on the new sheets in my hut'

1145
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:54,580
'Did you see my beauty or my heart on the mirror?'

1146
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:59,330
'Did you see? Did you see?'

1147
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:03,790
'Did you see? Did you see?'

1148
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:13,990
'Before you disappear like a magician, did you see me?'

1149
01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:35,200
'O cloud from the sky'

1150
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:41,990
'Will you go as my message to the golden door on the mango tree'

1151
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:46,700
'Will you go there and say'

1152
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:51,580
'The rhythm of my life, slowly, slowly'

1153
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,870
'Is the fragrance of flowers spreading all over?'

1154
01:35:55,870 --> 01:36:00,750
'Is someone passing by this way?'

1155
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:09,580
'Did you see my small footstep on your path? Did you see?'

1156
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:14,200
'Did you see? Did you see?'

1157
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:24,450
'Before you disappear like a magician, did you see me?'

1158
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:29,620
'I'll tie a swing on the flowery branch of a cloud'

1159
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:34,250
'For you to come and swing, my darling'

1160
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:38,950
'My silence encapsulates your breath'

1161
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:45,450
'Who are you, O angel of love?'

1162
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:50,410
'Are you the fresh flower of a shiny dream?'

1163
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:54,830
'Are you the cool wave of a flowing river?'

1164
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:59,370
'I am the forest with the flower you haven't worn yet'

1165
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:03,790
'Did you see? Did you see?'

1166
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:08,410
'Did you see? Did you see?;

1167
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:17,910
'Before you disappear like an angel, did you see me?'

1168
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:22,910
'Did you see? Did you see?'

1169
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:27,290
'Did you see? Did you see?'

1170
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:37,410
'Before you disappear like a magician, did you see me?'

1171
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:51,870
Daddy...

1172
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,750
Hey! See your daughter!

1173
01:38:57,290 --> 01:38:58,330
She is safe.

1174
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:59,830
And his condition? - Hey!

1175
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:16,040
Go!

1176
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,990
Shetty sir has come to take you.

1177
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,370
Daddy... - Etta...

1178
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,990
Hello Pareekar! - Reached safely, right?

1179
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:56,540
All safe!

1180
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,330
Sachiyettan has said a special thanks to you, Muthan.

1181
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,450
Welcome! - Okay, bye.

1182
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:02,870
Bye!

1183
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:36,330
Gemini, why are you getting up?

1184
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,330
Don't get up, dear. Lie down.

1185
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:12,790
Let's wait outside.

1186
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,410
Let them talk for some time.

1187
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,290
I think some relative of Shetty is admitted here.

1188
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,410
Why is she coming here with a bouquet?

1189
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:49,910
I asked her to come. - What for?

1190
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,830
She had called me saying that she wanted to meet Gemini.

1191
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,200
Why should she see Gemini?

1192
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,950
A Mamata (affection) towards Sachiyettan...

1193
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,990
Mamata? Isn't her name Arya?

1194
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:03,160
Arya Shetty feels some kind of bonding to him.

1195
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:05,500
Why do you have to do this now?

1196
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:07,580
Not me! It's Arya Shetty.

1197
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:11,250
Not to me. To Sachiyettan!

1198
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,040
Hello. - Hello!

1199
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,790
This is Arya Shetty. Sachiyettan's friend.

1200
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:22,620
Hello! - Arya Shetty. Sachiyettan's friend. - Hi.

1201
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,870
Arya Shetty wants to meet Gemini. - Okay.

1202
01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:30,580
Come. Arya Shetty!

1203
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:56,750
Arya Shetty.

1204
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:00,910
Coming!

1205
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,990
Hello!

1206
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:05,750
Hi.

1207
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:09,120
I am Arya Shetty. I came to say sorry on behalf of my daddy.

1208
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:10,950
You've come to say sorry?

1209
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,620
Did your dad Shetty send you to see if she's dead?

1210
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,370
It's because my brother is a naive guy.

1211
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:25,750
Otherwise you'd also have been on a hospital bed like this.

1212
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:31,040
The goons your dad sent, bashed her up in front of my eyes.

1213
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,080
Like that, you should also suffer.

1214
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:34,500
I won't spare any of you!

1215
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,910
Hey! Leave her!

1216
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,080
You are crying?

1217
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:41,250
Not these tears. I want to see the deaths of you and your dad!

1218
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:43,580
It will be at my hands! Consider that done!

1219
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:46,120
Hey! This is a hospital.

1220
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,120
Behave yourself.

1221
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:52,660
I am sorry.

1222
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:10,370
Sir...

1223
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:15,950
For kidnapping Shetty's daughter, you should be questioning me, not them.

1224
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:19,160
Is it you who decides whom I should question?

1225
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:20,830
Move away!

1226
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:26,950
Vedantham!

1227
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:34,250
To take them into custody, has Shetty given a complaint against them?

1228
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:35,250
No, sir.

1229
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:36,830
Then why such enthusiasm?

1230
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,620
You also know that, sir.

1231
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,990
About the drug mafia behind this.

1232
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:45,080
These 3 people have connections with Edwin Moses.

1233
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:53,290
Not just that. Your son-in-law's brother Manu...

1234
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,790
also has a connection with him.

1235
01:45:58,990 --> 01:46:01,120
That's why Shetty kidnapped Manu.

1236
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:04,330
To find Edwin Moses through him.

1237
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:07,540
We should be catching Edwin Moses, and not Shetty.

1238
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:11,700
Since there are no complaints against them,

1239
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,540
bail is not required. You can take them.

1240
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:19,870
Wait.

1241
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:23,080
If something happens to Shetty or his daughter...

1242
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:26,160
you won't see the outside world after that!

1243
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:28,540
Don't mind it.

1244
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:32,870
I'm someone who lived in the world inside, rather than the outside world.

1245
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,250
Don't try to scare me saying that.

1246
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,540
Go say this to school kids, sir.

1247
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:40,410
Don't mind it.

1248
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,290
I want to meet Gemini.

1249
01:46:58,330 --> 01:46:59,950
You can't see her. Go, Manu!

1250
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,660
I won't leave without seeing her.

1251
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,200
Manu!

1252
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:06,120
Please... You shouldn't come here.

1253
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:10,250
That will put our daughter and us, in further danger.

1254
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,080
Daddy!

1255
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,120
Go!

1256
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,500
Daddy!

1257
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,410
Go! - Daddy!

1258
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:54,990
Daddy!

1259
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:02,620
Come.

1260
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,660
Call the police.

1261
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:15,160
No one is picking up, Daddy.

1262
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:17,040
Call Vedantham from my phone.

1263
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,580
His phone is switched off!

1264
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,250
Hello! - Hello! This is Arya.

1265
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,330
Some people trespassed into our house and shot Daddy.

1266
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,620
We've locked ourselves inside our room.

1267
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:52,790
Please, Sachi. Please come fast.

1268
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,830
Hey! Don't cry. Try to be safe until I reach there.

1269
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:57,540
Switch off the power at home quickly.

1270
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,830
Okay.

1271
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,290
Pareekar, someone has trespassed into Shetty's house.

1272
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:08,950
I doubt whether Manu is also among them.

1273
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:10,750
Before he creates some trouble, we should stop him.

1274
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:14,120
Enough of getting ready. We need to pick up Sachiyettan & go to Shetty's house.

1275
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,870
Can we go to Shetty's house, without wearing underwear?

1276
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:28,750
Sit here, Daddy.

1277
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:41,870
Daddy!

1278
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,910
Sachi... - Switch on the light.

1279
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:49,620
We should take him to the hospital quickly.

1280
01:51:53,990 --> 01:51:55,540
Because the police wasn't called,

1281
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:59,250
it was easy for you to appear as a saviour and destroy the evidence, right?

1282
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,080
What all are you saying? - You shut up!

1283
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:04,370
One slap.. - What all are you doing?

1284
01:52:04,410 --> 01:52:06,450
Who told you that we didn't call the cops?

1285
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,500
They didn't pick up.

1286
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:10,250
And until he lost consciousness, Daddy & I kept calling you.

1287
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,040
Your phone was switched off.

1288
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,120
Sorry Arya.

1289
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:14,950
My phone's power had gone off.

1290
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,160
Okay?

1291
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,250
And you guys...

1292
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:19,290
Whoever is on duty at the station now...

1293
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:21,660
Ask them to meet me at my office in the morning.

1294
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,040
That's my order. Got it?

1295
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,200
Sachi...

1296
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:36,120
Thank you.

1297
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,580
Thank you so much.

1298
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:48,790
Who all were with you?

1299
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,160
I don't know, sir.

1300
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:52,040
None of us know each other.

1301
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,950
Only when I went to Shetty's house,

1302
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,910
I realized that other people were with me.

1303
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:57,450
Get up! - Pareekar!

1304
01:52:58,370 --> 01:53:00,290
Leave them. Don't do anything to them now.

1305
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:02,870
Shouldn't we hand them over to the police? - No.

1306
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:07,450
Then police won't have any difficulty in proving that Manu was with them.

1307
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:40,910
They came looking for Manu.

1308
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:43,910
Even though I told him that he was here for the whole night,

1309
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:46,080
and took him to his room and showed them,

1310
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:48,750
he left as if he still didn't believe it.

1311
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:02,080
Hello! - Hello Sachi..

1312
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:06,250
I need to tell you something really important.

1313
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,040
Can you come to the hospital?

1314
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:10,250
Why should I come to the hospital? Tell me on the phone.

1315
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:11,450
I can't say it on the phone.

1316
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:13,250
I need to say it in person.

1317
01:54:13,370 --> 01:54:15,290
Come to the hospital canteen at 4 o'clock.

1318
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:17,120
Okay. So see you at 4 o'clock.

1319
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:18,700
Bye.

1320
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:32,370
The name of this affection Arya Shetty is showing you, is called Stockholm syndrome.

1321
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,660
You named it too?

1322
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:34,790
So did everyone know it?

1323
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:36,830
What? - This romance.

1324
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:41,290
Stockholm syndrome is the admiration a hostage feels towards the saviour.

1325
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:42,790
That can become love later on.

1326
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,450
It has already become so, right?

1327
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:46,330
Shut up! Sachiyetta...

1328
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:48,750
You should bud it in the nip.

1329
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,660
What? - You should nip it in the bud.

1330
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:53,660
Sachiyettan will decide whether to nip it or not.

1331
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:57,620
Sachiyetta, it is a sin to reject a girl's love.

1332
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:59,990
You have some disease or what?

1333
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:01,160
You're the one with the disease!

1334
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,950
Disease of not getting married on time!

1335
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:04,410
Sachiyetta!

1336
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:07,870
Arya Shetty is coming to confess her love.

1337
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:10,330
She will come and sit on this chair,

1338
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,910
and when she says that looking into your eyes,

1339
01:55:13,450 --> 01:55:15,410
you should look into her eyes and say...

1340
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,410
'I love you'.

1341
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,910
I will say that I can't.

1342
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:22,410
Ruined it. - Correct.

1343
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:23,910
Sachiyettan became a man now.

1344
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:26,120
As if he was a woman till now.

1345
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:31,410
Sachiyetta, that girl is coming.

1346
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,830
Sachiyetta, as we said. Arya Shetty will come and sit here. Tell her the matter.

1347
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:44,870
Look at her face and.. - I'll say that I can't.

1348
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,040
Well, we... - Come here.

1349
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,830
He has become stunted lying in the jail.

1350
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:51,160
As if you're all grown up!

1351
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:14,330
Did you get scared? - Yes.. Err... No!

1352
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:18,290
Said that you would sit on this chair, right? - Who? Me?

1353
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:19,700
No, me.

1354
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:23,620
Why did you sit there?

1355
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,200
I'm not used to talking to girls like this.

1356
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,500
And... I kidnapped you...

1357
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,120
... to get back my brother.

1358
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:40,080
Whatever happens to you,

1359
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:42,950
that blame would fall upon Manu.

1360
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,500
That's why I came and saved you.

1361
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:49,370
I came to talk about Manu.

1362
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:53,160
Vedantham asked me only about Manu.

1363
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,250
Whether Manu was there among the attackers...

1364
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:00,870
Though I said no very strongly, he understood that I was lying.

1365
01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:10,290
I found Manu's phone from my house.

1366
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:18,290
I know that you really like your brother.

1367
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,990
That's why I didn't give this phone to Vedantham.

1368
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,500
What is it, Sachiyetta?

1369
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:44,950
I just went to the toilet.

1370
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:46,660
When did you come?

1371
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,620
I didn't ask in front of everyone in the morning.

1372
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:52,200
Where were you last night?

1373
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:59,000
You weren't in your room, and your bike was not there outside.

1374
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:02,660
By the time the police came searching, you got back to your room.

1375
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:04,830
Where did you go in the night?

1376
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:07,500
Before that, I have to ask you something.

1377
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:10,450
Why are you trying to save that Shetty and his daughter?

1378
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:11,950
Who are they to you?

1379
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:14,660
Not them...

1380
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:16,830
I went to save you.

1381
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:18,370
Me?

1382
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,790
Are you saying that I did it?

1383
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:29,500
She got your phone from there.

1384
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:39,750
Hello! Okay sir.

1385
01:58:56,540 --> 01:58:57,540
Hello!

1386
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:12,830
Hello! Hello!

1387
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:15,370
Anyone here?

1388
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:24,540
Hello! - Sachi...

1389
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:27,540
All the policemen who were standing guard for us at the hospital are missing.

1390
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,790
There are no doctors or nurses anywhere around.

1391
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,950
It looks like someone has planned this deliberately.

1392
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:34,000
I will come quickly.

1393
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,540
What is it, Etta?

1394
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:47,080
It's Sachiyettan. Pick up.

1395
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,660
Tell me, Sachiyetta.

1396
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:53,330
Come fast. That girl had called from the hospital. There's some problem there.

1397
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:54,660
What about Manu? - He is here.

1398
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,450
Why should we go then? There are policemen and doctors there, right?

1399
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:58,620
Let them handle it, Sachiyetta.

1400
01:59:58,790 --> 02:00:01,250
Why don't you understand? No one has to come. I'll go alone.

1401
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:04,250
No, Sachiyetta. We are coming. Wait outside.

1402
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:08,790
Where are you going? If it is to save Shetty & his daughter, I won't let you go.

1403
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:11,750
Whoever attacks them, police will frame you for it.

1404
02:00:11,790 --> 02:00:12,790
Move! - No!

1405
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:18,080
I am here, right? If someone attacks them at the hospital, how can I be blamed?

1406
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:19,450
That's because you don't know the police well.

1407
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,750
Move away. - No! I won't let you go.

1408
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:22,950
They deserve to die!

1409
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,540
Whatever happens because of that, I'm ready to face it.

1410
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:27,950
Etta, leave me.

1411
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:29,660
What is this?

1412
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:31,620
Manu!

1413
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:33,910
Me or Gemini are not important for you now!

1414
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:36,620
It is him and his daughter who got us thrashed, right?

1415
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,790
When you got close to that girl, you forgot what we suffered.

1416
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:42,660
What is the problem? - Etta!

1417
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,950
What's happening here? - Etta, open the door.

1418
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,370
Etta, open the door!

1419
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,370
Etta, open the door!

1420
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:51,330
What crime did he do?

1421
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:53,660
I'll tell you the crime that we did, Dad.

1422
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:55,450
We shouldn't have brought Ettan back from jail.

1423
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,750
That's the crime I did.

1424
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,160
Stop it!

1425
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:18,370
Etta... Sorry.

1426
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:24,500
Vishnu.. - Etta...

1427
02:01:24,540 --> 02:01:26,790
Until I come back, see to it that he doesn't get out.

1428
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:41,200
Okay guys.

1429
02:01:41,790 --> 02:01:42,950
Listen carefully.

1430
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:46,370
You guys have to really make it fast. Everything is set.

1431
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:51,790
Guys, where are you? Hurry up!

1432
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,790
Hello! - Where are you? - We've reached.

1433
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,950
They are in front of the ICU. Come fast.

1434
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,660
Abort the mission.

1435
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:32,250
Get out of here. Quick!

1436
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,950
Okay, sir. - Escape before they catch us! Quick!

1437
02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:46,200
It's them. They ran downstairs as soon as you came.

1438
02:03:53,790 --> 02:03:55,910
I am really sorry. I just slept.

1439
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:57,250
Is there a problem?

1440
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,660
What's your name, Doctor?

1441
02:04:10,330 --> 02:04:11,330
Pawan.

1442
02:04:11,790 --> 02:04:12,790
Dr. Pawan Kumar.

1443
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:22,200
What doctor are you? Sleeping during duty?

1444
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:24,540
He must be the doctor of sleep. Sleepologist.

1445
02:04:30,370 --> 02:04:32,790
Hello Sachi? Can you come here quickly?

1446
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:35,660
Watch this doctor.

1447
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:36,950
Don't let him go at any cost.

1448
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,250
Listen, guys. Listen!

1449
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,620
I... - No!

1450
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:48,750
There's no one in the duty room.

1451
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:50,370
The intercom is disconnected.

1452
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:52,160
Can you call a doctor somehow?

1453
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,950
Doctor...

1454
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:12,370
Listen... Let me explain. I was on duty since last night.

1455
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:14,660
I am very tired. So I slept off. I am sorry.

1456
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:18,250
That's what we said. Sleep! We'll wake you up when Sachiyettan comes.

1457
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:26,540
For God's sake, don't report this. I'll lose my job.

1458
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:27,620
Please, I request you.

1459
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:28,830
Doctor, what's the problem?

1460
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:32,540
Sir, actually I slept off during duty.

1461
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:35,910
In the meanwhile, someone entered the ICU and tried to kill Shetty sir.

1462
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:38,160
For that, they have held me captive, sir.

1463
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:39,540
Who are you guys?

1464
02:05:40,250 --> 02:05:41,330
Are you the police?

1465
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:43,080
To keep him captive and question him?

1466
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:46,620
Doctor, get back to your duty.

1467
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:48,450
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

1468
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,830
And you three.. Come with me!

1469
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:56,950
Should we go? - Is it a problem?

1470
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,200
Come.

1471
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:12,910
Wherever Shetty gets attacked,

1472
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:16,080
you and your criminal friends are present at all those places.

1473
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,790
How do you know this before us?

1474
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,500
I called them here.

1475
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:23,080
None of the policemen on duty, were here.

1476
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:25,370
Who all were on duty here?

1477
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:26,950
Where did they go?

1478
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:29,790
When there weren't enough people for VIP duty, they were called there, sir.

1479
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,540
We thought there won't be any problem here.

1480
02:06:31,540 --> 02:06:32,910
Idiots! Fools!

1481
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,660
Are you the ones who will decide that there won't be any problem here?

1482
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:37,250
Sorry sir. - Shut up!

1483
02:06:37,370 --> 02:06:40,250
If you ever repeat this, none of you will continue in service.

1484
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:53,370
What did you do with him? - Whom? That doctor?

1485
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:56,200
We held him there saying that he can't leave unless you come.

1486
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:58,450
By then, that Vedalam came in. - Not Vedalam. Vedantham.

1487
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:00,620
Vedantham believed what that doctor said.

1488
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:02,330
He's not a doctor.

1489
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:04,080
Excuse me. - Yes.

1490
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:06,080
Is Dr. Pawan Kumar on duty now?

1491
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:09,200
No. Dr. Pawan Kumar has day duty. He doesn't come during the night.

1492
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:12,080
Can I see his service record?

1493
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,540
That's against our hospital rules, sir.

1494
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:17,200
Hello! Vedantham IPS.

1495
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:19,790
He's the crime and narcotic cell special officer.

1496
02:07:20,370 --> 02:07:21,950
Sorry sir. - Show it.

1497
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:23,340
Constables, come.

1498
02:07:23,370 --> 02:07:25,160
Your dad is the constable!

1499
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:36,000
Thank you. - Okay.

1500
02:07:39,830 --> 02:07:41,000
Pull over.

1501
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,040
I'll get down here.

1502
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:02,250
Etta...

1503
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:04,500
Etta..

1504
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:12,660
Say sorry to Ettan.

1505
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:17,500
Etta...

1506
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,660
I'm really sorry.

1507
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:22,080
I shouldn't have said all that.

1508
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:29,660
Before dying, mom called us both by her side and cried for you.

1509
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:33,660
Saying that we shouldn't hurt you in any way,

1510
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:35,620
once you finish your jail term and come back.

1511
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:41,370
And he, who was running around to get you out of jail...

1512
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:43,200
... hurt you recounting that!

1513
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:47,830
That night, I went to see Gemini.

1514
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:51,790
Her family is not allowing me into their house.

1515
02:08:52,250 --> 02:08:54,660
That's why I go there in the night, without anyone noticing.

1516
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:57,950
I didn't go to kill Shetty or his daughter, Etta.

1517
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:04,200
You shouldn't go hiding at midnight to meet the girl you love.

1518
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:08,370
You should go in the morning, when everyone can see you.

1519
02:09:11,790 --> 02:09:13,370
Pappu, check who it is.

1520
02:09:20,370 --> 02:09:22,660
Didn't I tell you that you can't meet Gemini again?

1521
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Who is it, dear?

1522
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:33,750
I went to the jail after killing two people when I was 16.

1523
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:38,080
I got released after a double life imprisonment, only very recently.

1524
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:43,500
Go! - Come.

1525
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,790
A Tamilian came to the hospital and threatened us

1526
02:09:59,790 --> 02:10:02,200
that Gemini shouldn't be seen with Manu.

1527
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,450
That's why we discharged her and left quickly.

1528
02:10:06,330 --> 02:10:07,830
Later he came here too.

1529
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:11,660
He said he will kill all of us if Manu comes here again.

1530
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:15,330
Etta...

1531
02:10:17,450 --> 02:10:19,750
I understood where I lost my phone now.

1532
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:21,250
Look.

1533
02:10:21,620 --> 02:10:24,500
This is a video that Pappu took when I came to Gemini's house that day.

1534
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:44,080
Etta...

1535
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:47,080
My jail term proved useful for the first time now.

1536
02:10:47,790 --> 02:10:50,830
Gemini's family is not upset with Manu anymore.

1537
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:56,450
And I understood how Manu's phone reached Shetty's house.

1538
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:59,160
Gemini and Manu are happy, right? Very good.

1539
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:01,370
Are they with you? - They are close by.

1540
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:03,000
Everyone is really happy.

1541
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:06,370
Doctor, give me the key, and get into the back seat.

1542
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,540
Give me the key.

1543
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:09,080
Doctor, don't create trouble.

1544
02:11:09,790 --> 02:11:12,040
Give the key, I say! - Hey! Give me the key!

1545
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:13,200
Put him inside!

1546
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:15,200
Vishnu, what's happening there?

1547
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:23,830
Bloody rascal!

1548
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:27,200
Shut up and get into the car!

1549
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:31,370
Give it!

1550
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,660
Open it, you idiot!

1551
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:36,250
Go inside.

1552
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:38,040
Move, you tomato!

1553
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:48,500
Bloody rascal!

1554
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:54,540
Chechi, come on!

1555
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:56,450
Don't you remember that Tamilian's face?

1556
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:57,660
Try to remember again!

1557
02:11:58,370 --> 02:11:59,370
Chechi, please.

1558
02:12:12,450 --> 02:12:14,540
Govindaraj. He's a Tamilian.

1559
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:16,790
He was with me in jail.

1560
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,910
He got released now.

1561
02:12:18,450 --> 02:12:19,660
He is somewhere in this city.

1562
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:23,080
Do you know where his hideout is, Muthan?

1563
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:28,790
Why just him? I'll find out even his dad!

1564
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:30,330
Don't worry.

1565
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:35,500
Doctor, your wife will come on video call.

1566
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,200
Talk to her.

1567
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:55,370
Oh no! Vishnu! What is this?

1568
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:59,000
Saw it, right? Your husband's life is in my hands now.

1569
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:01,200
It's just a small favour. Do what I say.

1570
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,370
Vandana...

1571
02:13:02,910 --> 02:13:04,250
Don't bother what they are saying!

1572
02:13:04,330 --> 02:13:05,660
Hang up and call your dad.

1573
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:08,160
Stop it!

1574
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:09,790
What should I do? Tell me.

1575
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:11,830
You don't have to do what I say.

1576
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:13,910
But do what my boss says.

1577
02:13:14,250 --> 02:13:15,540
You'll get a video call now.

1578
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:17,500
Listen to what he says!

1579
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:24,540
Hello Doctor.

1580
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:27,790
Who are you? What do you want?

1581
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:28,790
I'll tell you.

1582
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:31,790
First, don't hang up the call, and put the phone on the stand.

1583
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:39,160
Now don't take off your hands from the steering, no matter what.

1584
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,950
This call shouldn't get disconnected.

1585
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:47,080
If something like that happens, you know what will happen to your husband, right?

1586
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:50,750
Then turn the car, and go straight to the hospital.

1587
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:51,790
Okay.

1588
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:40,160
Go!

1589
02:16:17,330 --> 02:16:19,830
Doctor, now go inside the hospital.

1590
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:25,250
Until you reach the ICU, don't talk to anyone.

1591
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:33,660
Enter the ICU and send out all those who are in the room.

1592
02:16:40,370 --> 02:16:41,660
Go get the scan reports.

1593
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:53,250
I will stay here. You just go.

1594
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:58,620
Good, Doctor.

1595
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:02,330
Now don't move from the front of the camera.

1596
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,250
I want to see you take the syringe.

1597
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,620
Then fill it with sedative medicine.

1598
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:27,660
Now go and inject that sedative into the patient.

1599
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:45,080
Until his heart and pulse stops,

1600
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:47,790
you shouldn't move from there, Doctor.

1601
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:49,950
You will have to stay on!

1602
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Do it!

1603
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:18,250
Vandana!

1604
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:26,330
Damn it!

1605
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:33,370
Where is Edwin Moses, the guy who sent you?

1606
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,910
I know only the name, Edwin Moses.

1607
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:43,250
I don't know where he is or what he does.

1608
02:18:44,370 --> 02:18:48,660
My friend asked for his help, and got me released from jail.

1609
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:53,200
I did all this for Edwin Moses, in return for that help.

1610
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:07,790
To get me released from jail, did you seek anyone's help?

1611
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:11,950
Problems started for you, with my arrival.

1612
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:14,450
That's why I'm asking.

1613
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:16,910
Whom did you meet, to get me released from jail?

1614
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:19,160
I met so many people.

1615
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:21,250
None of them could do it.

1616
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:24,790
Then I was given someone's number and I was asked to call him.

1617
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:29,200
One week after I called on that number and spoke, your releasing order came.

1618
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:34,040
Did he ask anything in return?

1619
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:35,620
Yes.

1620
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:38,500
He asked me to write a quote in front of the police headquarters.

1621
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:40,250
'Hell is empty'

1622
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:43,830
'All devils are here'. That quote from Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'.

1623
02:19:49,830 --> 02:19:51,540
Do you still have his number, Manu?

1624
02:19:52,750 --> 02:19:53,790
Yes.

1625
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:58,950
This is his number.

1626
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:07,250
Allah!

1627
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:09,540
This is our Muthan's number.

1628
02:20:12,910 --> 02:20:14,450
So... is he the guy? - No.

1629
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:17,370
It's Edwin Moses.

1630
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:22,950
Muthan knows who Edwin Moses is.

1631
02:20:56,950 --> 02:20:58,160
Wow! Sachi..!!

1632
02:20:58,790 --> 02:21:00,080
What a surprise!

1633
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:03,080
I need permission to meet Shetty sir.

1634
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:05,000
Why do you need my permission for that?

1635
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,080
I will tell Daddy.

1636
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:08,750
When are you coming, Sachi? - Evening.

1637
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:11,450
Okay. See you in the evening then. - Okay.

1638
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:16,750
Sachiyetta, shall I also come when you go to meet Arya Shetty?

1639
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:20,540
Not Arya Shetty. Shetty sir.

1640
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:24,830
Then I'm not coming.

1641
02:21:27,250 --> 02:21:28,250
Should I?

1642
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:31,080
Go, man! - Why should I go to see that old man?

1643
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:39,330
Why did you want to meet me?

1644
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:41,200
Who is this Edwin Moses?

1645
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:44,080
Why is he trying to kill you?

1646
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:50,910
This enmity against Edwin Moses...

1647
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:53,790
... was started by my son.

1648
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:56,750
Dear...

1649
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:06,160
My son, Dr. Arun Shetty.

1650
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:08,830
His war was against drugs.

1651
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:13,500
Naturally, Edwin Moses became his enemy.

1652
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:16,790
It was Edwin who killed him.

1653
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:30,750
Then, my only aim was to eliminate Edwin somehow.

1654
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:35,200
I joined hands with Vedantham IPS, and planned many tactics.

1655
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:37,790
He wasn't trapped in any of it.

1656
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:38,950
But...

1657
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:44,370
I seized one of his containers which had a toxic chemical drug called MMDA.

1658
02:22:44,950 --> 02:22:47,950
I was waiting for him to come asking for it, so far.

1659
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:53,080
It was your brother who made all my calculations go wrong.

1660
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:57,370
It was your brother who wrote on the wall of the Commissioner's office,

1661
02:22:57,620 --> 02:23:00,790
and that he was Edwin Moses' guy... I was given this information...

1662
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:03,370
... by some of my spies in the police.

1663
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:05,910
That's why I kidnapped him.

1664
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:09,080
I thought I can find Edwin Moses through him.

1665
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:11,160
But you spoiled my plan.

1666
02:23:11,370 --> 02:23:13,540
Ask him to come and take his brother.

1667
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:15,660
I want my daughter back.

1668
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:20,540
The matter is not only about getting the boy back, sir.

1669
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:26,500
Then? - The drug container of Edwin Moses you had seized some days back?

1670
02:23:27,450 --> 02:23:28,660
Return that too.

1671
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,620
That's how, without any other option,

1672
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:36,620
I had to hand over that drugs container along with your brother to Muthan.

1673
02:23:37,370 --> 02:23:38,370
For her.

1674
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:46,660
When even my last attempt to catch Edwin Moses failed,

1675
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:48,910
I informed Vedantham about it.

1676
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:52,080
When he raided Muthan's hideout,

1677
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,790
they just got some drugs.

1678
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:57,620
Apart from that, the police hasn't been able to find where that container is, yet.

1679
02:23:57,660 --> 02:24:01,080
Vedantham still suspects you.

1680
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:07,500
He is saying that you, Muthan and friends,

1681
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:09,660
fooled Edwin Moses and shifted it somewhere else.

1682
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:13,370
Edwin Moses is trying to kill me

1683
02:24:13,450 --> 02:24:17,370
because now he's sure that I have lost that container.

1684
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:19,950
That too, using your younger brothers.

1685
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:24,790
He is trying to get them framed in cases, put you under pressure,

1686
02:24:24,790 --> 02:24:27,660
and get that container back from you.

1687
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:32,080
Behind you, it's not just Edwin Moses now.

1688
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:33,790
Vedantham is also after you.

1689
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:38,790
The reason for that is your friends who are with you.

1690
02:24:40,330 --> 02:24:43,370
All this has happened with their knowledge.

1691
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:48,160
In business, there is an advice that my father gave me.

1692
02:24:48,750 --> 02:24:50,790
Don't believe anyone blindly.

1693
02:24:51,910 --> 02:24:56,790
A very famous officer ended his autobiography like this...

1694
02:24:57,370 --> 02:25:00,250
Oh God! I will handle my enemies.

1695
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:03,250
But please protect me from my friends!

1696
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:07,660
That's what I am also praying for you, Sachidanandan.

1697
02:25:08,370 --> 02:25:11,250
May God protect you from your friends.

1698
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:31,000
Sachiyettan!

1699
02:25:33,950 --> 02:25:35,080
When did you come?

1700
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,620
Why didn't you come upstairs then?

1701
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:49,660
Who was it?

1702
02:25:49,950 --> 02:25:51,910
That's just a useless marketing call.

1703
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:53,080
Where? Let me see.

1704
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:55,250
Didn't you believe what I said?

1705
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:57,080
I don't believe it. That's why. Let me see.

1706
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:58,790
I won't give the phone. - Hey!

1707
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:00,160
Sachiyetta, leave it.

1708
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:03,080
Why are you being so adamant, Sachiyetta?

1709
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:05,370
We don't have any secrets that you don't know of. - Move!

1710
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:15,620
Pareekar! = Come!

1711
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:40,750
I loved you guys more than Vishnu and Manu.

1712
02:26:41,660 --> 02:26:45,950
And you guys were betraying me, for Edwin Moses?

1713
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:49,540
Sachiyetta, I fell at their feet and asked them not to do it.

1714
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:51,660
They didn't allow me to tell you, either.

1715
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:54,660
They stopped me saying that we'll say it after we get 50 Crores,

1716
02:26:54,660 --> 02:26:56,040
and otherwise, you won't allow it.

1717
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:59,660
Are you happy now that Muthan is also gone, putting everything on our head?

1718
02:27:01,370 --> 02:27:03,660
Initially we didn't know much about this, Sachiyetta.

1719
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:06,950
Muthan told us about this just before we released Arya Shetty.

1720
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:08,250
When he said that

1721
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:11,660
he has asked for the drugs container that was with Shetty, along with Manu,

1722
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:15,500
and that Edwin Moses will give us 50 Crores for it, we fell for that offer.

1723
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:20,160
Muthan's behaviour changed after he got the container.

1724
02:27:20,660 --> 02:27:22,450
He has hidden it somewhere.

1725
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:27,540
Then, during the bargaining with Edwin Moses, Muthan was shot dead by the police.

1726
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:31,080
With that, Edwin Moses began chasing us for the container.

1727
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:37,330
That's why he is still calling us.

1728
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:41,450
As long as Muthan was alive, we didn't have anything to do with Edwin Moses.

1729
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:42,950
All our deals were with Muthan.

1730
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:44,540
This is true, Sachiyetta.

1731
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:46,790
He started calling us only after Muthan died.

1732
02:27:46,790 --> 02:27:48,250
We didn't say it out of fear.

1733
02:27:50,250 --> 02:27:51,950
We've never betrayed you, Sachiyettan.

1734
02:27:52,450 --> 02:27:54,200
We won't betray our own brother.

1735
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:56,160
You had warned us back then itself...

1736
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,910
Not to have any deals with Edwin Moses, because it's dangerous.

1737
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:00,500
We didn't realize it then.

1738
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:03,250
Now there's no point saying anything, right?

1739
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:04,370
You may go, Sachiyettan.

1740
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,330
This is our fate.

1741
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:07,660
We must suffer it.

1742
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:46,330
I suspected it when such a vehicle was used to bring Manu.

1743
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:52,830
That's why I followed Muthan and checked the vehicle.

1744
02:28:53,790 --> 02:28:58,080
When I saw these drugs worth Crores, my doubts were proved right.

1745
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:02,540
I thought it was a secret deal between Edwin Moses and Shetty.

1746
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:05,080
Even then, I didn't suspect you.

1747
02:29:05,790 --> 02:29:08,910
Anyway, I am sure that Edwin Moses will come here looking for this.

1748
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:11,950
That's why I shifted this from where Muthan hid it.

1749
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:16,950
Edwin Moses had called again on this phone.

1750
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:19,160
I've told him that I have the container,

1751
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:22,790
and asked him to come here with as much money Muthan asked for.

1752
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:24,370
He will come. - Will he bring the money?

1753
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:28,200
If I don't ask for money, he won't trust us.

1754
02:29:28,370 --> 02:29:29,950
He will understand that it's a trap...

1755
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:31,250
and he won't come.

1756
02:30:44,250 --> 02:30:45,250
Move it.

1757
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:27,660
Kill that rascal!

1758
02:32:30,250 --> 02:32:31,250
Get up!

1759
02:34:50,330 --> 02:34:52,540
Even if I arrest them and take them to Court,

1760
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:54,200
they won't get punished.

1761
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:56,410
If they have money and a smart advocate,

1762
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:58,330
they will come out and do the same business.

1763
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:09,540
Shoot the criminals dead on the spot. That's my policy.

1764
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:12,250
Sachiyetta!

1765
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:14,830
Come!

1766
02:35:15,410 --> 02:35:16,790
Oh my God! - Ghani!

1767
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:03,620
Khan!

1768
02:36:21,500 --> 02:36:23,540
Khan, get up!

1769
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:26,330
Khan, get up!

1770
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:28,370
Khan!

1771
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:31,330
Sachiyetta...

1772
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:35,500
Sachiyetta..

1773
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:41,450
Sachiyetta...

1774
02:36:45,750 --> 02:36:46,910
Forgive us.

1775
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:09,250
This is a punishment we got, for not obeying what you said.

1776
02:37:12,750 --> 02:37:13,830
We deserve this.

1777
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:17,080
My dear...

1778
02:37:23,540 --> 02:37:24,540
Khan!

1779
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:16,250
You thought nobody will find you.

1780
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:20,410
With that arrogance, you killed off all drug dealers...

1781
02:38:20,910 --> 02:38:22,660
you built an empire.

1782
02:38:23,830 --> 02:38:26,080
In the false name of Edwin Moses,

1783
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:28,410
an empire that belonged to you alone!

1784
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:31,500
In this game, you went wrong.

1785
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,250
Even when he tried to kill Shetty thrice,

1786
02:38:34,620 --> 02:38:39,330
Edwin Moses never touched Vedantham IPS who bumps off the drug mafia in shootouts,

1787
02:38:39,370 --> 02:38:40,370
even once.

1788
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:43,950
That's when I began suspecting you.

1789
02:38:45,620 --> 02:38:48,450
Later you cleverly saved him from the hospital.

1790
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:50,750
With that, I confirmed it.

1791
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:56,120
By thinking that you could bring me on your path, using my brothers,

1792
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:59,540
you chose your end yourself, Vedantham.

1793
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:04,540
The pain that my family suffered?

1794
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:07,540
No punishment would be enough for you, compared to that.

1795
02:39:09,450 --> 02:39:13,040
You did all this for the drugs in that container which is outside, right?

1796
02:39:14,830 --> 02:39:17,540
Your assets worth Crores...

1797
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:22,250
Let it burn down to ashes in front of your eyes!

1798
02:39:23,540 --> 02:39:24,540
Hey!

1799
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:26,830
No!

1800
02:39:29,370 --> 02:39:30,500
No!

1801
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:04,160
Sachiyetta!

1802
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:09,660
Sachiyetta!

1803
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:31,870
What you said is right.

1804
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:34,660
Criminals should be shot dead on the spot!

1805
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:36,080
Isn't that your policy?

1806
02:40:36,910 --> 02:40:38,500
But that's not my policy.

1807
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:41,660
The one who killed my friends...

1808
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:44,250
I want to kill him with my own hands.

1809
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:15,790
Sir, it's a call from Sachidanandan.

1810
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,040
Pick the call.

1811
02:41:18,790 --> 02:41:21,250
The task you gave me has been completed, sir.

1812
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,080
But...

1813
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:26,330
... I wasn't able to capture Edwin Moses alive.

1814
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:29,080
He was shot dead by Vedantham IPS.

1815
02:41:29,410 --> 02:41:32,160
Even though he is dead, it is still a good news.

1816
02:41:32,330 --> 02:41:33,910
There was a tragedy as well, sir.

1817
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:36,790
Shot by Edwin Moses,

1818
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:39,080
Vedantham also got killed.

1819
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,200
Oh! Sad!

1820
02:41:57,700 --> 02:41:58,700
Sir!

1821
02:41:58,790 --> 02:42:00,330
Sir! Sir!

1822
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,250
Sir! - Sir!

1823
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:07,620
Sir! Sir! - What's happening there?

1824
02:42:07,660 --> 02:42:09,580
Someone kept a bomb at the garage.

1825
02:42:09,620 --> 02:42:12,040
There's a lot of smoke and fire and lots of noise.

1826
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:13,410
Come fast, sir. - Bomb?

1827
02:42:16,700 --> 02:42:17,870
Look at the smoke!

1828
02:42:17,910 --> 02:42:19,450
Sir, call a fire engine. - Shut up.

1829
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:20,580
Switch on the light quickly.

1830
02:42:20,620 --> 02:42:21,620
Don't make noise.

1831
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:24,500
What is this?

1832
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:32,790
Our car has started.

1833
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:34,660
My dear Etta!

1834
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:37,500
Do you feel happy only if you work in the dark or what?

1835
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:40,700
I came here when there was light.

1836
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:43,580
I didn't realize that it became dark.

1837
02:42:45,370 --> 02:42:46,910
My dear Etta!
