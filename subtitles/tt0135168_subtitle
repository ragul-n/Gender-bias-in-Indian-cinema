3
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,592
I pray to God his son is found.

4
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,601
Who are they? I've been
seeing them for years.

5
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,771
They come here for worship
on the 2nd of January each year.

6
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,776
He lives in Ambala,
Thakur Harcharan Singh.

7
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:26,449
This happened 22 years ago.
Their elder son, Madan was lost.

8
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,287
And has not yet been found.
That's why they come here.

9
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,490
They even promised...

10
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:39,329
They would cover the temple dome
with gold when their son is found.

11
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,833
Here is your locket.

12
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,503
You are released today.

13
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:52,675
This is the second time you've been
imprisoned in Simla jail for theft.

14
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,179
Once, under your real name, Madan.

15
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,848
The second time as Shyam.

16
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,452
Changing the name
doesn't hide the crime.

17
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,788
You look like you belong
to a good family.

18
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,159
It would be best if
you gave up these jobs.

19
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,329
Yes, sir.

20
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,834
What does your heart say,
will my Madan be found?

21
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,671
I am positive
Madan will surely be found.

22
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,507
Mother, I won't come home tonight.

23
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,844
- Why?
- I have to catch a killer.

24
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,850
What a cop you are. You find
killers but can't find your brother!

25
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,555
The fact is that brother's
case is now very old.

26
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,558
So what? You may make an attempt.

27
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,726
I am trying-

28
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,396
I too am eager to meet him.

29
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,732
This is a blood relation.
How can Sunil be quiet?

30
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,902
Someday he'll surely
find his elder brother.

31
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,906
When? When I am no more?

32
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,845
- Why do you say that?
- I've lost all hope.

33
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,982
God knows where Madan would
be and in what condition...

34
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,160
Drink some water.

35
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,833
Now how do you feel?

36
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,169
What are you looking at?

37
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,506
Are you Madan?

38
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,110
What? No.

39
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:03,012
My name is Shyam.

40
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,852
No. I met you in
Simla jail last year.

41
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,187
You are Madan.

42
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,558
You are Shantilal!

43
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,561
But what a state you're in.

44
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,564
I'm suffering for my deeds.

45
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,235
Poverty, sickness...

46
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:33,009
Many a time, I tried to kill
myself but life didn't leave me.

47
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,980
Everything will be all right.
I'm going to Bombay.

48
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,116
- Come with me.
- To Bombay? - Yes.

49
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,254
I have two daughters
who live there.

50
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,257
Sangita and Sushma.

51
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,293
- Where do they live?
- I don't know.

52
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,962
It's been many years
since I left home.

53
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,801
One night I burdened them with
my sins and quietly left home.

54
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,106
I'll find both of them
but you must come with me.

55
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:06,576
I can't face them.

56
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:09,913
Not till I die.

57
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,117
What did I give my
children as a father?

58
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,621
Poverty, debts...

59
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,126
Yes a debt of 50000.

60
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,297
50000? That's a small sum.

61
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,134
Don't worry. Together
we'll clear this debt.

62
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,303
Thank you very much.

63
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,306
If you want to do me a favour...

64
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,142
Just do this much...

65
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,312
If you find Sangita and Sushma...

66
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,649
Tell them your father
has sent you blessings.

67
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:53,022
And tell them to pay the
debt of Thakur Harcharan Singh.

68
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,025
My soul will be at peace.

69
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,797
I will do this but where
will you wander in this state?

70
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,134
Lie down at ease and go to sleep.

71
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,303
You have to come with me to Bombay.

72
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,305
Go to sleep. Rest assured.

73
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,697
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

74
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,211
Hey! There was a man
lying here. Where's he?

75
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,713
He's gone. Got off.

76
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,884
Where did he get off?

77
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:56,886
At the last station.

78
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,703
- Hello. ls your name Sangita?
- No.

79
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,373
- Then it must be Sushma.
- Not that either.

80
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,878
Forgive me.

81
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,381
Loafer!

82
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,385
- Sangita, what are you doing here?
- Nothing at all.

83
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,926
- Excuse me! Hey!
- Loafer!

84
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,928
I say, listen!

85
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:53,837
You'll make such a name on stage
that columns will be written on you!

86
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,339
You will be famous!

87
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:02,946
The real success will be when
we'll pay off the debt Dad owes you.

88
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,783
Forget about it, Sushma. Your
father was a good friend of mine.

89
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:11,254
And I don't even recall ever
giving a loan to your father.

90
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,958
- But it's our duty.
- I'll be glad the day...

91
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:17,496
your sister becomes
a big stage heroine.

92
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:21,331
She surely will,
with your blessings.

93
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:24,000
Now we'll take leave. Good day.

94
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,838
Director, now we only need a hero.

95
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,509
Who can be the hero
opposite Sangita on stage.

96
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,346
He should be young,
handsome and 6 feet tall.

97
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,517
I'm waiting for that.
If I find a good boy...

98
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,235
I can start rehearsals for
my play, Boy friend, immediately.

99
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,023
I challenge that if
I find a good hero...

100
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,059
He'll add to the
glory of Boy friend.

101
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,604
Then hurry up and put up posters,
place advertisements in newspapers!

102
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,567
I've put up posters. I'll
send news to the papers now.

103
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,505
Today was great fun!

104
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:07,277
Loafer! I'll have you
thrashed! Go away!

105
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:12,182
Terrific, Shantilal!
What girls you've got!

106
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,563
- My necklace!
- What's wrong?

107
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,902
- Mother! What happened?
- Your mom's necklace has been stolen!

108
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:37,407
Everyone stand here. Check
the lanes. Let none escape!

109
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,063
- Good day inspector.
- When did you arrive?

110
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,900
- Just today.
- But you don't want to live honestly

111
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:09,572
I've always wanted to be
honest but circumstances...

112
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,575
Shyam, you're wasting
your life in this way.

113
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,245
I don't know why I
sympathize with you.

114
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,248
You're a pick pocket
and I'm an inspector.

115
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,587
But you look like you're
connected to some good family.

116
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,290
Why don't you pick a good job?

117
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,626
Enroll me in the police force.

118
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,629
I'd do it but your record is bad.

119
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:38,134
But you can't know a
man's heart by his record.

120
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,971
- I want to search you.
- Sure, inspector.

121
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:46,142
You'll search me all life
and I'll let you all my life.

122
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,316
Try to be a good human being.

123
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,319
I am trying, sir.

124
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:08,024
It's an expensive one. Your
life is made if you sell it.

125
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,428
Life is not made by sinful money.

126
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,532
If you are honest, the
world will respect you.

127
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,702
I'll give it to Inspector Sunil.

128
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,206
What are you doing?

129
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:29,212
Constable, I'm looking
for Miss Sangita's house.

130
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:32,715
- Do you know her?
- Yes, very well.

131
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:37,720
Don't you believe me? Take me
there and I'll give you proof.

132
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,723
Come on.

133
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,263
I'll just show you.

134
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,436
- What is it? Police...!
- You are Shantilal's daughter?

135
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,606
- He's sent a message for you. Is your name Sangita?
- Yes.

136
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,608
- Is it true?
- Absolutely!

137
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,443
- Absolutely true.
- Come in.

138
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,283
Keep her away from me! She's
turned me into a real loafer!

139
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:12,288
If you hadn't supported me, I'd
spend the night with the constable!

140
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,173
So you've come to spend the night?

141
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:16,989
- He's a friend of father's.
- Father's friend?

142
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:18,828
- Yes.
- Come in.

143
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:22,332
Please be seated.

144
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,606
- Where did you meet father?
- In the train.

145
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,841
Don't worry, he was fine.

146
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,845
Why didn't you bring him along?

147
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,851
I was but I fell asleep en route
and he got off at some station.

148
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,853
How can I help it?

149
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,223
What did you talk to him?

150
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:50,415
We spoke of a number of
things but most significantly...

151
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,499
He was talking of Thakur's debt.

152
00:20:55,222 --> 00:21:00,503
That's what I'm trying. Maybe
you don't know, I dance on stage...

153
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,605
only so I can repay the debt.

154
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,175
I hope the debt is paid.

155
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,344
I came to give you the
message in this rain.

156
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,347
Good night.

157
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,517
Just a minute.

158
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,854
How will you go in this rain?

159
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,690
- You won't get a taxi.
- I'll walk.

160
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:25,061
You are father's friend.
Brought his message in this rain...

161
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,899
- We are grateful. - I'll go...
- No, consider this your house.

162
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,985
Get a blanket and pillow
for him from inside.

163
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,571
Right away.

164
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:37,407
Believe me I'll go home.
You are being formal...

165
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:39,676
You can sleep quite comfortably.

166
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:41,911
First take off your coat.

167
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,415
- Why must I take it off?
- Will you sleep with it on?

168
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,284
I can sleep in it...

169
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:52,422
- It's wet and you'll catch a cold.
- No, I never catch colds.

170
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,959
What's special about it?
Is it very expensive?

171
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,537
- That's not true...
- Why don't you take it off?

172
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,897
I'll take it off.
It's not expensive.

173
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:04,401
- I'll keep it here.
- Here's the blanket.

174
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,238
- Your coat...
- What are you doing?

175
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,907
- Dusting it off.
- Not hard, it's old. Might tear

176
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,909
Then I'll stitch it.
Go to sleep.

177
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,412
- But where are you taking it?
- To dry.

178
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:18,915
- Go to sleep.
- Go to sleep.

179
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:25,922
You go here. Go to sleep.

180
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:07,964
- You...?
Water.

181
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,471
Thanks.

182
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:25,982
If you need anything else,
ask for it right now.

183
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,985
No, I won't need anything.
Go to sleep.

184
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:34,991
I need a cigarette.

185
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:37,026
- I'll get it.
- Pardon...?

186
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,538
- Here's your cigarette.
- Thank you.

187
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,040
Now go to sleep.

188
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:16,299
- Where's the guest?
- Guest...?

189
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,969
Can't be in my pocket. Must be
where you asked him to sleep.

190
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:24,307
The blanket and pillow is lying
here. Where's he gone so early?

191
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,811
The coat.

192
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:32,516
In the night, he didn't want to take
the coat off. Now he's left it here.

193
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:36,653
- Funny man.
- He hasn't forgotten it. He's left a return ticket.

194
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:39,689
- What?
- He needs an excuse to return.

195
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,358
You don't know the boys of today.

196
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:46,362
- He is a loafer!
- You won't change!

197
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,365
I'm wondering how
to return the coat.

198
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:54,037
- I didn't ask his name.
- Ask him when he comes to take the coat.

199
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:55,705
As well as his address.

200
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,752
Don't be mad. Go back.

201
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:12,088
You're returning this
necklace? Go and sell it.

202
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:14,391
You'll make your life.

203
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,762
Honesty is very precious.

204
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:22,932
Work hard. Do something worthwhile.

205
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:25,435
Wealth will be at your feet. Go.

206
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:30,106
- Excuse me...
- Who...?

207
00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:34,778
- Is Inspector Sunil in?
- He is but who are you?

208
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,214
- I'm Shyam.
- But what do you want?

209
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:40,450
I have to talk to him.

210
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:44,254
But he says I must ask the name
and work, then send guests in.

211
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:47,323
You told me your name
but what work do you have?

212
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,015
- Do I have to tell you?
- Yes.

213
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:53,163
I've come to return
a stolen necklace.

214
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:55,498
- Stolen necklace?
- Yes.

215
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,451
Shyam? How did you come by?

216
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,955
That day, you told me to try
and become a good human being.

217
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:20,957
So today...

218
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:25,995
What's the matter?

219
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:30,266
I came to prove my honesty.

220
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,503
But God is not in favour.

221
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:36,840
- Don't blame God.
- All right.

222
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:43,279
If I'd got the love of parents in
my childhood, I wouldn't be a thief!

223
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:48,518
Doesn't matter. Someday I'll
still prove my honesty to you.

224
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:51,521
I'll wait for that day.

225
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,498
He tried being honest!

226
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:05,502
Banwarilal hit the prize.

227
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:14,511
Why one necklace? My Lord,
I can sacrifice 100 on you.

228
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:18,877
But right now there's no
such necklace in my shop...

229
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,518
that would be worthy
of being worn by you.

230
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:26,389
- Pardon?
- You have a short fuse.

231
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:32,062
This number too turned
out to be wrong!

232
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:34,564
No problem.
I have thought it over.

233
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:37,567
Someday I'll clean you out.

234
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:40,069
- Yes sir?
- What are you doing here?

235
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:42,572
- Cleaning the cobwebs.
- On the locker?

236
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,077
Yes. Spiders make cobwebs
on man forget vaults.

237
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,579
Shut up. Mother wants you.

238
00:32:56,944 --> 00:33:00,323
Good day inspector.
So, how are you?

239
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:02,225
Are you happy?

240
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:06,896
Whenever I want to talk
to you, some job crops up.

241
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:10,066
I'll get back and talk to you.

242
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:17,907
- Sunil here.
- I know that.

243
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,243
Say something new.

244
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,580
- Today is Sunday.
- That too is old news.

245
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:26,118
What difference would it
make if it were Monday?

246
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,918
I meant I have a holiday.
Where will you meet me?

247
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,322
I can't meet you.
Anything else, warden?

248
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,292
You are strange. I get
leave just once a week.

249
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,463
I know that but I'm
not your constable.

250
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,633
I too must have time. My exams
are drawing close. I have to study.

251
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,635
One day won't matter.

252
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,139
I'm going shopping with Sangita.

253
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,141
The program can be canceled.

254
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,310
You too can get canceled.

255
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:55,645
What did you say? What?

256
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:59,649
The criminal is caught! Put him
in the cell. I'll come at 5 PM.

257
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:03,586
- Got that, constable?
- Constable? What nonsense?

258
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,423
I'm not speaking French.
I said I'll come at 4.

259
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:10,627
What? What did you say, Nirmala?

260
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:13,630
Your mother broke her leg!

261
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:16,966
And father isn't home.
Now what will happen?

262
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,403
Take her to the hospital.
I'll wait for you at home.

263
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:23,306
Come soon. Please hurry.

264
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,976
You were to go shopping with me.

265
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,647
You tell me what to do.
Nirmala's mother broke a leg!

266
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,483
- It broke!
- Yes. - So?

267
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,318
She's coming home to take me.

268
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:39,155
- Then even I won't go shopping.
- What?

269
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:43,360
No problem. You stay home.
I'll go shopping.

270
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:46,529
You go to the hospital with her.

271
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,698
- I got it.
- What?

272
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:52,702
You will go to see the broken
leg and I must go shopping.

273
00:34:59,032 --> 00:35:01,978
When did you arrive?
Boy, get a special coffee.

274
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,148
I came yesterday but
reached my room today.

275
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:09,019
- These are your...
- Money for what?

276
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,656
Our last year's balance was 75
rupees. Keep some and return some.

277
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:18,194
You have a good memory.
Pay it all together next year.

278
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,698
What you say is right but
the angle all wrong. What's it?

279
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:27,704
I mean your decorated room
lies vacant all year round.

280
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:31,041
Give it to me. I want to get
my son married this year.

281
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:36,212
What if I intend to
get married this year?

282
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:39,049
- Then you take my hotel.
- I'm not joking.

283
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:43,586
- I will marry this year.
- Really? Tell me her name.

284
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:47,724
- I'll meet her parents.
- You're worried abut the parents!

285
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:52,762
First let me get acquainted with her.

286
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:58,768
I'll be back.

287
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,711
Wanted urgently
a young handsome boy.

288
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:12,716
To play the lead opposite
our new discovery, Sangita.

289
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:15,719
Meet Thakur Har...

290
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:27,097
I want a boy not a girl.

291
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:30,767
Who can be presented as
hero opposite Sangita.

292
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:34,437
He should be young,
handsome and 6 feet tall.

293
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,775
Young, handsome, 6 feet tall.

294
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,783
- May I sit?
- Yes.

295
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:53,790
- What's your name?
- The name comes after work.

296
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:56,881
For the time being I'm a non
entity but people call me Shyam.

297
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:03,600
- Have you ever been on stage?
- What a thing to ask!

298
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:04,234
Any man will say he can act like
Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar.

299
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:07,771
Any man will say he can act like
Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar.

300
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:10,273
But my standard is higher.

301
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,276
Kalidas' Dushyant,
Shakespeare's Othello...

302
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:18,281
And Ceaser's Brutus... who loved
Ceaser's power not his friendship.

303
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:22,452
- Can you dance?
- Dance in such a style.

304
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:25,623
When I dance Manipuri, the
weather dances, party comes to life.

305
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,457
Tandav puts people under my spell.

306
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:30,660
If I dance the rock and roll,
I turn people crazy.

307
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:34,872
Regarding songs, I can sing light,
Chinese, Japanese, Russian, lrani.

308
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,834
- Ask me something else.
- Wonderful!

309
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,173
But you'll have to give a
test of all that you just said.

310
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:45,842
I'm ready. What say I present?

311
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,179
Acting, singing or dancing?

312
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,681
You'll have to go
to the dance master.

313
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,406
The dance master is here, sir.

314
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:58,355
Sir, come along.

315
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,662
I don't understand what to do!

316
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:15,358
We've found the man we wanted!

317
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,027
We should sign him for life!

318
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:22,866
- This is our new hero, Shyam.
- Hello.

319
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:27,037
Nobody would have ever seen
such a good couple on stage.

320
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:30,040
Director, start rehearsals.

321
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:32,542
Our first show will be in Simla.

322
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:40,050
I am sure the pair of Shyam and
Sangita will raise a storm in Simla!

323
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:44,554
Every corner will resound with
the success of our play, Boyfriend!

324
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:49,059
Begin the preparations.
Sangita and Shyam, you too.

325
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:52,095
Good day.

326
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:56,099
Good day.

327
00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,869
Congratulations.

328
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,715
Hello, good day.

329
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:16,052
You know me yet you
didn't wish me.

330
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:20,423
Most tall men are fools but
this doesn't apply to me.

331
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:24,094
I'm an honorable man.

332
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:28,765
If you were so sensible, that
night you wouldn't have behaved so!

333
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:33,103
- What did I do?
- Forgot so soon?

334
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:36,106
You came like a guest
and left like a thief!

335
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,775
- Is this your decency?
- You should have told me.

336
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,111
I'd have apologized right then.

337
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:44,796
I have this good quality of
accepting my mistake right away.

338
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:51,121
Why did you leave your
coat at our place?

339
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,125
You're being silly. I didn't
leave it at a stranger's house.

340
00:41:56,483 --> 00:41:58,161
Your home is my home.

341
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,597
My home is yours. Any objections?

342
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:04,601
I did object, severely but...

343
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:11,107
Now onwards there should be
no anger between us on any issue.

344
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,610
You are my stage partner.

345
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:17,113
And believe me, our pair will
raise a storm in the world.

346
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,159
- What do you think?
- The thought is sweet.

347
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:23,620
Hope it comes true.

348
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,624
Lightning agrees with me.

349
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:29,993
You are as quick as lightning.

350
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:31,995
I defeat lightning in every way.

351
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:35,165
Eating, drinking, walking,
wandering, cutting...

352
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,502
I mean cutting coats, pants...

353
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:43,173
Cutting noses... I'm the
best cutter of this city.

354
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:46,676
You are so funny!

355
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:58,188
Where do you live?

356
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:00,624
In every corner of the city.

357
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:02,826
What do you mean?

358
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:07,664
I mean sometimes at the Taj,
other times at Raj.

359
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:09,899
Or Marine Drive or Nagpada.

360
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:14,671
If I'm in the mood I even
go to the government home.

361
00:43:15,496 --> 00:43:17,173
You are joking!

362
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:21,011
Maybe because you've never
had any responsibilities.

363
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:25,849
What responsibility? I came to
this world alone and thus I'll leave.

364
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:33,690
Why don't you get married? Yes?

365
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,228
I haven't found a girl.

366
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:44,067
- If you find her?
- I'll get married.

367
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:47,237
- Any one you know?
- Yes. - How is she?

368
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:52,242
She's educated, nice.

369
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,913
That's what won't do. I
want a girl tall as a tree.

370
00:43:57,571 --> 00:44:00,517
Fat as a buffalo. Dark as
a crow and dumb as a fool!

371
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,055
You're joking again!

372
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:09,192
Because I don't want to
fall in the trap of marriage!

373
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:14,564
- Why?
- What times these are!

374
00:44:15,556 --> 00:44:18,234
Every girl is running
after her boy friend.

375
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,739
Every boy is seen with a girl friend.

376
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:27,077
- Is it good?
- What's wrong in friendship?

377
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:32,916
This means you want to
play with her feelings.

378
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,751
You may assume that.

379
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:39,956
Then keep this in mind,
no girl will want you.

380
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:41,758
What do you think of girls?

381
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:45,295
Where are you going? Listen...

382
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,300
You've taken offense!
Don't take it personally.

383
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:53,303
Listen to me...

384
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,307
Good heavens!

385
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,577
Rascal! Scoundrel!
Don't you have eyes?

386
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:04,247
He has no shame! Shameless!

387
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:12,255
Stupid! At least give me a hand!

388
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:16,626
Ruined my vegetables! God!

389
00:50:08,943 --> 00:50:12,088
How did you come here?
You have high temperature!

390
00:50:12,946 --> 00:50:15,091
Get up and come in.

391
00:50:20,954 --> 00:50:22,966
I kept looking for you. Come...

392
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,138
Lie down.

393
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,978
You are terribly ill.
I'll get a doctor.

394
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,647
Don't leave me and go.

395
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:48,658
I'm here just for a few moments.

396
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:55,198
- My daughters, Sangita...
- Both are well.

397
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:58,702
- Very well...
- Lie down. I'll call them.

398
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:02,138
No... don't bring them.

399
00:51:02,963 --> 00:51:05,642
I'm a blot on their lives.

400
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:10,647
Sinner, Vagabond...
A sentenced father.

401
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:14,651
I can't show them my face.

402
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,322
I have very little time.

403
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:26,696
Pay back my debt to Thakur.

404
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:28,698
That will be done. Don't worry.

405
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:37,373
- Look after my kids.
- You don't have to say that.

406
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:39,542
Don't worry.

407
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:45,715
Give this to her... the last memento.

408
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:35,265
Why do you miss your father when
this Geeta is in your hands?

409
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:39,602
It will always remind
you of your duty.

410
00:52:41,095 --> 00:52:45,308
Pay attention. Your life is
going towards a new destination.

411
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,778
Success awaits you on
the stage of Simla.

412
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:57,153
I'll be so happy when the public
will sway to your performance.

413
00:52:58,145 --> 00:53:00,223
And the stage will
resound with applause!

414
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,594
Be brave, everything will be fine.

415
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:10,266
Your father's debt will be paid
and his soul will rest in peace.

416
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:13,770
He is right.

417
00:53:39,153 --> 00:53:43,833
We have come to your city
of Simla with 2 artistes.

418
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:46,836
The name of our play
is Husband and Wife.

419
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:55,845
Our hero always addresses
his wife as sweetheart.

420
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:59,849
Films have a tremendous
impact of youngsters.

421
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:05,288
Our youngsters imitate film actors.

422
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,626
In our play of today...

423
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:15,498
we have tried to show that
this young man wants to be a hero.

424
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:18,168
But his wife gets annoyed.

425
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:22,839
As her husband, he
wants to please her.

426
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:28,845
He sings a song on stage to
bring his wife back home.

427
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:33,349
So this is our stage
play, Husband and Wife.

428
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:02,993
- Congratulations director.
- Same to you.

429
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,029
Your sister performed
very well on stage.

430
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,865
She always does. What's
your contribution to it?

431
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,869
Where has that young, handsome
6 foot tall lad vanished?

432
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,039
- He's not to be seen.
- Must be in Sangita's room.

433
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:19,042
He's not there. I checked.

434
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:22,379
- Where's your hero?
- Where is he?

435
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,370
He must have gone to look
for a new goat to fleece.

436
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:27,717
How can he leave his business?

437
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:34,758
I don't interfere in your matters
so don't meddle in my business.

438
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:38,094
He's my hero and I want
to earn millions from him!

439
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,099
Someday you'll be cheated.
He's a Vagabond, a cheat!

440
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:46,102
He's a very good boy!

441
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:41,084
I don't know why I ever
took Sangita skating.

442
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:46,623
Had I not taken her, her
foot wouldn't have broken.

443
01:00:49,617 --> 01:00:52,295
What I planned and what's happened.

444
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:55,298
I'm responsible for this!

445
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:59,302
Don't say that. It's fate.

446
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:02,238
Nobody can change that.

447
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:08,912
If you lose heart,
how will Sangita face it?

448
01:01:11,572 --> 01:01:15,251
- Where is she now?
- In the room upstairs.

449
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:36,806
You...?

450
01:01:40,634 --> 01:01:43,313
- Why are you surprised?
- No...

451
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,318
Aren't you happy to see me?

452
01:01:50,678 --> 01:01:52,322
I...

453
01:01:53,681 --> 01:01:57,327
I thought you'd forgotten me...

454
01:01:58,686 --> 01:02:00,964
Silly girl! Why did
you think like this?

455
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:05,302
That's how the world is.

456
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:09,305
People worship the rising sun.

457
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:12,642
Now what's left in my life?

458
01:02:14,635 --> 01:02:18,315
I can neither walk nor dance.

459
01:02:20,674 --> 01:02:23,687
Did you think I loved your steps?

460
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:26,823
You think I love your body!

461
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:32,362
No. I love your soul.

462
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:37,867
Do I still mean the same to you?

463
01:02:38,692 --> 01:02:42,372
You are the same Sangita
with whom I would dance.

464
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:44,875
And sing...

465
01:02:49,203 --> 01:02:53,216
But... now I can never
dance with you on stage.

466
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,783
Do you think I joined the
theater to sing and dance?

467
01:02:58,746 --> 01:03:03,326
No. I came for you, Just for you.

468
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:07,097
Trust me.

469
01:03:07,688 --> 01:03:10,366
I will love you till
the last breath of life.

470
01:03:14,695 --> 01:03:16,373
Forget that crutch.

471
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:29,386
I'm glad that wooden
support of yours broke.

472
01:03:30,744 --> 01:03:32,389
Why?

473
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:35,258
Else how would I get
a chance to hold you?

474
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,094
In any case, you are
a big help to me.

475
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:42,432
You are like God for me.

476
01:03:43,757 --> 01:03:46,770
God...? How can you say that?

477
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:49,272
What do you know about me?

478
01:03:49,763 --> 01:03:51,107
Do you think I need to know more?

479
01:03:52,766 --> 01:03:54,778
Maybe you've misunderstood me.

480
01:03:55,769 --> 01:03:58,949
- I can never misunderstand you.
- Such trust?

481
01:03:59,773 --> 01:04:02,886
If I didn't trust you,
wouldn't I have died for my leg?

482
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:07,390
What if your leg gets better?

483
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:11,428
- I'll think I'm dreaming.
- This dream can be real.

484
01:04:13,754 --> 01:04:16,433
- How?
- God is merciful.

485
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:19,102
Your leg will get better.

486
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,438
My leg will get better?

487
01:04:23,764 --> 01:04:26,443
- Will I be able to walk?
- And dance too.

488
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:31,448
I'll be able to dance.
Father's debt will be paid!

489
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:37,453
Good day, Banwarilal.

490
01:04:39,313 --> 01:04:42,325
Glad to see you.
You're a very honest man!

491
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:46,496
You've come to pay back
the 100 bucks I lent you!

492
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:50,333
- And I'm broke today.
- Talk of thousands.

493
01:04:50,824 --> 01:04:54,170
Lord! You are merciful!

494
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,508
- Some cold drink, lemon...?
- Listen to me...

495
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:03,446
I'm in love with a girl.

496
01:05:04,772 --> 01:05:06,449
So am I.

497
01:05:07,808 --> 01:05:11,822
- But she is unwell.
- So is mine.

498
01:05:12,813 --> 01:05:16,960
Maybe. I want to buy her
a gift that will amuse her.

499
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:21,831
Tell me if she's fair or dark...

500
01:05:22,823 --> 01:05:24,835
Fair. Fairer than the moon!

501
01:05:25,826 --> 01:05:28,838
Then I'm yours and so is
everything in this shop!

502
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:34,044
I'll show you something that
will blow you and her away!

503
01:05:34,835 --> 01:05:38,181
- Show it to me fast!
- In a moment.

504
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:51,027
Shyam will swoon at seeing this.

505
01:05:57,891 --> 01:06:01,504
- This necklace...?
- It's the Kohinoor!

506
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,508
I've studded pieces of the heart.

507
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:08,011
What are you looking at?

508
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:11,514
I've seen it before.

509
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:14,517
You may have seen the design!

510
01:06:15,376 --> 01:06:18,521
- I saw it myself...
- I'm not saying your eyes deceive you.

511
01:06:19,379 --> 01:06:23,226
This is a market. 100 necklaces
are made and sold everyday.

512
01:06:24,885 --> 01:06:28,398
This is a very honest
and truthful business.

513
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:32,235
You're no stranger that
I'll sell you a risky item.

514
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:35,071
Don't worry and take it.
Don't hesitate at all.

515
01:06:36,897 --> 01:06:39,075
- I agree if you insist.
- Then I do.

516
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,579
- How much does it cost?
- What can I tell you?

517
01:06:43,437 --> 01:06:46,583
You're a good man. Give me
the cost, which is 2000.

518
01:06:47,942 --> 01:06:49,753
- Only 2000?
- Just 2000.

519
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:52,922
- 2000 for a friend?
- I said, only 2000.

520
01:06:53,947 --> 01:06:58,128
You're a decent man. Take this.
It's 500 rupees. That's all!

521
01:07:03,891 --> 01:07:08,572
I'll call Sampat that his money
is lying here. Take the 250 bucks.

522
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:11,074
May I come in?

523
01:07:11,565 --> 01:07:13,576
- Thakur sent me.
- Come in.

524
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:17,247
- Good day Sushma.
- How did you come by?

525
01:07:17,905 --> 01:07:20,250
It's nothing much but it's important

526
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:25,388
I'm his old manager. I don't
go to his office or his home.

527
01:07:25,946 --> 01:07:29,960
But on and off he asks me to
do some job which is difficult.

528
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:32,295
You talk too much.
Come to the point.

529
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:34,964
It's nothing much but it's important

530
01:07:35,956 --> 01:07:38,635
This house and the items
in it do belong to you.

531
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:42,405
Do you mean to say
it's pawned to Thakur?

532
01:07:42,963 --> 01:07:44,641
It's been this way for years.

533
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:47,644
Manager too is with him for years.

534
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:52,148
Viewing things from business,
I've come here for the first time.

535
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:56,586
I've brought a court order for 50000.

536
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:00,957
How can we pay so much money?

537
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:03,593
It's nothing much but it's important

538
01:08:04,952 --> 01:08:07,464
If you don't pay the money
this order will be activated.

539
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:09,875
And you'll have to vacate
this house in 24 hours.

540
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:15,639
In 24 hours? Don't we need some
time to raise such a large sum?

541
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:19,643
That's well said but it's
nothing much but it's important

542
01:08:20,968 --> 01:08:26,149
Give me 2000 as interest tomorrow
so I can shut Thakur for a month.

543
01:08:26,974 --> 01:08:28,318
We don't even have that much.

544
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:32,522
I can give you 4 days
to get that money too.

545
01:08:33,013 --> 01:08:35,358
But even in 4 days where
will the money come from?

546
01:08:36,016 --> 01:08:39,195
That I don't know.
Either you pay 50000...

547
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,699
Or the interest of 2000
or vacate this house.

548
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:44,701
I'll return in 4 days.

549
01:08:47,027 --> 01:08:49,706
The show won't stop
because of one Sangita.

550
01:08:50,531 --> 01:08:52,331
The curtain will rise
and the play will go on.

551
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:54,711
One Sangita doesn't matter.

552
01:08:56,036 --> 01:08:58,048
But we need time to find another girl.

553
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:01,484
Start the search. And
start rehearsal of Boyfriend!

554
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:03,486
We have Shyam!

555
01:09:06,013 --> 01:09:08,525
- Forget Shyam.
- How can I?

556
01:09:09,016 --> 01:09:11,161
You're the hero of this stage.

557
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:14,197
We're now looking for a new heroine.

558
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:16,366
You may keep your new heroine.

559
01:09:17,024 --> 01:09:20,036
- Meaning?
- Ask your heart.

560
01:09:21,528 --> 01:09:25,375
Where's the sympathy?
The sweet talk with Sangita?

561
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:30,380
She means nothing to you.
You only wanted her dancing feet.

562
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:34,717
You wanted to sell them
and make millions.

563
01:09:36,076 --> 01:09:40,090
But today when she's helpless
you've discarded her mercilessly.

564
01:09:42,082 --> 01:09:43,727
And asked for your loan too!

565
01:09:45,085 --> 01:09:47,264
Is this your humanity?

566
01:09:49,089 --> 01:09:51,768
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Yes I do.

567
01:09:53,093 --> 01:09:55,272
A very big man.

568
01:09:56,096 --> 01:09:58,275
Who plays with lives of people.

569
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:04,447
Sunil was right. You're a
thief, loafer and a cheat!

570
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:08,785
If I'm a thief, you're
the spirit of decency.

571
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:11,555
If I'm a loafer, you're
the upholder of the law.

572
01:10:12,146 --> 01:10:13,290
If I'm a cheat...

573
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:19,329
I could answer this slap...

574
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:21,832
Get out!

575
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:26,836
I will go but you keep in mind...

576
01:10:27,661 --> 01:10:32,175
Life has many twists. Someday
your life will take such a turn...

577
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,678
that will leave you spinning!

578
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:36,680
Your face will turn pale.

579
01:10:37,171 --> 01:10:41,685
And then you'll go back to the
same Sangita who is helpless.

580
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:46,857
That day you will remember
this 6 foot handsome man.

581
01:10:57,224 --> 01:11:00,670
You'll see, you will be free
from morning to evening.

582
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:03,340
Are you drunk?

583
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:05,842
I've got a client.

584
01:11:08,169 --> 01:11:11,848
I've come to buy your shop.
Will you sell it?

585
01:11:13,174 --> 01:11:16,186
- Some new bird...?
- Don't put your hand in!

586
01:11:16,877 --> 01:11:20,690
I've found the vault number. Let my
partner come. Then see my miracle!

587
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:25,896
If I don't change the shape
of your shop, I'm not Sampat!

588
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:30,734
Will you have a cigar?
Your Pop never had one!

589
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:33,903
My master gets it from abroad.
Takes a puff... like so...

590
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:36,906
Excuse me...

591
01:11:38,232 --> 01:11:41,411
This is priceless but
I'm selling it cheap.

592
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:45,916
It is good.

593
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:52,422
- Son, what are you doing?
- Buying this necklace.

594
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,047
It's only 2000.

595
01:11:57,785 --> 01:12:00,230
It's very good but we don't want it.

596
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:03,066
- Why?
- I said, we don't want it.

597
01:12:13,233 --> 01:12:14,911
I want to sell this necklace.

598
01:12:16,236 --> 01:12:18,415
- I'm very worried.
- At what price will you sell?

599
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,585
- 2000.
- For rupees 2000?

600
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:24,588
- Why?
- Don't ask me.

601
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:27,858
I have some problems. Just buy it.

602
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:29,962
Give it to your wife.
She'll be very happy.

603
01:12:30,284 --> 01:12:32,004
You desperately need the money.
I'll buy it.

604
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:35,966
Excuse me.

605
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,307
I'm sorry I can't buy this.

606
01:12:56,343 --> 01:12:57,654
- Got a match?
- No, inspector.

607
01:12:58,345 --> 01:12:59,923
You seem worried.

608
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:03,927
Sir, if my father was a
millionaire like yours...

609
01:13:05,286 --> 01:13:07,798
I could wipe away thousands
of worries in a flash.

610
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:12,969
Why did you quit the job?

611
01:13:17,298 --> 01:13:18,975
Why don't you ask your Dad?

612
01:13:23,304 --> 01:13:24,981
He's really upset today.

613
01:15:28,763 --> 01:15:30,941
Won't you eat tonight?

614
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:36,613
- I'm not hungry.
- Hunger won't wait so late.

615
01:15:37,771 --> 01:15:39,616
Why didn't you come home early?

616
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:44,121
What can I say? My work is such.

617
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:48,992
What work keeps you out
of the house late nights?

618
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:25,161
- Mister Shyam!
- What's the matter?

619
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:28,331
I don't know. He just came and left.

620
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:33,170
He must be worried. He can't
bear to see us in this state.

621
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:43,847
- You...?
- You wanted to wed your son.

622
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:46,850
- So late in the night...
- You can take my room.

623
01:16:47,508 --> 01:16:48,952
All the furniture in it is yours.

624
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:51,688
I only want 2000 rupees.

625
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:55,058
- Just 2000?
- Yes.

626
01:17:00,487 --> 01:17:01,665
Here it is.

627
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:06,836
- Do you want me to give anything signature...?
- No.

628
01:17:07,494 --> 01:17:09,172
I trust you. Go.

629
01:17:11,499 --> 01:17:12,676
Thank you very much.

630
01:17:14,501 --> 01:17:16,179
He's a good boy.

631
01:17:18,506 --> 01:17:20,183
We couldn't arrange for the money.

632
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,519
We are vacating the house.

633
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:25,570
- Then I'm sorry. I'll get the men today.
- Sure, please do.

634
01:17:37,558 --> 01:17:40,737
I swear I was thinking of you!

635
01:17:41,562 --> 01:17:44,241
But come back in the night.
Such jobs are not done in the day.

636
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:46,910
- What jobs?
- You are strange!

637
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:48,745
There's just one job...

638
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,748
I've come to meet Thakur.

639
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:55,252
You can meet him all your life.
Meet me today.

640
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,130
Such occasions don't come easy.
I've memorized the vault number.

641
01:17:59,446 --> 01:18:01,191
- Let's clean it up tonight.
- Who is it?

642
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:03,527
Who are you? And what do you want?

643
01:18:10,558 --> 01:18:12,903
Yes. I've come to pay the
interest of your kindness.

644
01:18:13,561 --> 01:18:17,240
- Interest?
- Yes. Sangita has sent 2000 bucks.

645
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:20,577
So you've come here as her lawyer.

646
01:18:21,568 --> 01:18:25,248
If this is what decency means
in your language, so be it.

647
01:18:26,073 --> 01:18:28,585
Here's the amount.
Hand me the receipt.

648
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:31,621
Get a receipt for 2000 rupees.

649
01:18:33,614 --> 01:18:36,960
- Where did you get this money?
- It's not stolen.

650
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:40,130
Rest assured. Count it well.

651
01:18:42,623 --> 01:18:46,303
It's not too late. If
you regret the past...

652
01:18:47,628 --> 01:18:49,639
You can return to my stage.

653
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:54,311
You forget this maybe
a business for you.

654
01:18:55,135 --> 01:18:56,495
But it has emotional value for me.

655
01:18:57,638 --> 01:19:00,083
If I return to stage,
it will be with Sangita.

656
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,920
That day will never come.

657
01:19:04,945 --> 01:19:06,957
It will. I'm sure.

658
01:19:07,615 --> 01:19:10,961
Do you remember life has
hundreds of twists.

659
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:16,299
Someday your life will take such
a twist that you'll forget business!

660
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:20,303
You will value emotions.
And that day...

661
01:19:21,629 --> 01:19:25,308
You will remember this
6 foot handsome man.

662
01:19:29,637 --> 01:19:33,817
Now what are you thinking of?
I'd warned you earlier.

663
01:19:45,686 --> 01:19:49,032
We are packing but where will we go?

664
01:19:51,692 --> 01:19:56,039
We will find refuge
somewhere in this wide world.

665
01:20:03,704 --> 01:20:08,218
You look after those
who have none other.

666
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:39,449
A receipt for 2000 rupees!

667
01:20:40,775 --> 01:20:43,119
See... who kept this here?

668
01:20:46,814 --> 01:20:48,654
A receipt of the interest
money of rupees 2000!

669
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:50,994
But who paid it?

670
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:55,332
Who could it be other than Shyam?

671
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:18,321
Doctor, will Sangita's
leg be better?

672
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:24,828
The case is serious but I
assure you she will walk again.

673
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,832
If that happens, believe
me, I'll be ever grateful.

674
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:32,502
I'll have to perform
a major operation.

675
01:21:33,827 --> 01:21:36,506
- It will cost a lot.
- Don't worry about that.

676
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,509
I'll get all the money you need.

677
01:21:40,834 --> 01:21:42,345
But it's imperative she get better.

678
01:21:43,837 --> 01:21:45,849
- How much money...?
- At least 5000.

679
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:51,521
I'll get it. I'll get the
money and you'll treat her!

680
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,891
Sangita must dance on stage again.

681
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:57,194
That's my greatest desire.

682
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:00,846
Bring the patient here
after 2 days at 11 o'clock.

683
01:22:01,822 --> 01:22:03,500
Thank you very much.

684
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:12,509
No, I can't take this money.

685
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:16,847
How long will you bring
pleasure to my ruined life?

686
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:18,982
To my last breath.

687
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:06,770
Did you think I'd be happy
wearing this necklace?

688
01:27:09,096 --> 01:27:11,775
No, it's looking more
beautiful round your neck.

689
01:27:17,605 --> 01:27:20,116
Why did you have to buy
such an expensive necklace?

690
01:27:21,108 --> 01:27:22,619
Who told you it's expensive?

691
01:27:23,143 --> 01:27:26,156
Do you know it's cost?
Just rupees 2 and four annas.

692
01:27:27,148 --> 01:27:28,458
I bought it from the footpath.

693
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:34,831
But I'm sure its' value has
gone up to 5000 when you wore it.

694
01:27:36,156 --> 01:27:37,834
You're an angel!

695
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:42,339
I've often told you not
to call me an angel.

696
01:27:43,164 --> 01:27:46,176
Call me anything but angel.

697
01:27:47,168 --> 01:27:49,346
- Then shall I say the truth?
- Yes.

698
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:51,514
- You won't feel offended.
- No.

699
01:27:52,172 --> 01:27:53,850
- Think it over.
- I have.

700
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:58,188
Then listen. You are a big thief!

701
01:28:00,147 --> 01:28:01,658
- Thief?
- Yes.

702
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:04,294
- What have I stolen?
- Nothing?

703
01:28:05,152 --> 01:28:07,831
- No. I haven't.
- No...?

704
01:28:09,156 --> 01:28:11,335
- Why are you scared?
- I'm not.

705
01:28:14,161 --> 01:28:16,339
You have stolen my heart.

706
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:24,348
It's you? Please come in.

707
01:28:25,172 --> 01:28:27,684
How did you come by
so early in the morning?

708
01:28:28,175 --> 01:28:31,354
- I've come to ask you something.
- That's an old habit.

709
01:28:32,213 --> 01:28:34,858
Will you ask me questions all
your life or give an answer too?

710
01:28:36,217 --> 01:28:40,397
- It's very important.
- Everything is important for cops.

711
01:28:41,222 --> 01:28:42,899
We always make small talk.

712
01:28:43,557 --> 01:28:45,402
What is your question?

713
01:28:46,226 --> 01:28:47,904
What's your relation to Shyam?

714
01:28:48,562 --> 01:28:51,908
- Why?
- First answer my question.

715
01:28:52,566 --> 01:28:54,911
- Shall I? - Yes.
- Then listen...

716
01:28:55,736 --> 01:28:57,414
He is my boy friend.

717
01:28:57,905 --> 01:28:59,750
We are terribly in love.

718
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,352
We'll be married in 2 days.
Will you attend?

719
01:29:04,211 --> 01:29:06,223
In fact, I've come to
say, he's not a good man.

720
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:11,228
Envious? The problem is you're
the only good man in this world.

721
01:29:12,219 --> 01:29:13,897
And the one who helps us is bad!

722
01:29:15,222 --> 01:29:18,402
Why don't you understand?
He has a bad police record.

723
01:29:19,226 --> 01:29:22,239
What do you know about him?

724
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,908
You can't even imagine what I know!

725
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:28,244
Don't meddle in my family affairs!

726
01:29:29,236 --> 01:29:30,680
Why are you fighting?

727
01:29:31,238 --> 01:29:32,415
What's the matter, inspector?

728
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,918
It's nothing. Actually...

729
01:29:47,288 --> 01:29:49,633
Why are you staring at her?
Look at me.

730
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:53,303
- Where did you get this necklace?
- This necklace...?

731
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:55,639
Do you want to buy it for me?

732
01:29:58,299 --> 01:30:00,310
Who gave you this necklace?

733
01:30:00,968 --> 01:30:02,979
- What do you mean?
- It's a stolen necklace.

734
01:30:04,305 --> 01:30:05,649
- No!
- Oh, yes.

735
01:30:06,307 --> 01:30:08,027
The police has been
looking for it for days.

736
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:16,693
- Take your necklace.
- That I will.

737
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:19,751
But the necklace is not as
important as the one who stole it.

738
01:30:20,354 --> 01:30:22,365
Tell me who gave it to you?

739
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:29,372
- If I refuse to tell...
- I'll be forced to arrest both of you

740
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:37,047
I will not give any names.

741
01:30:40,374 --> 01:30:45,055
Why are you quiet? Your silence
can endanger the lives of both.

742
01:30:46,914 --> 01:30:48,425
Forget that I'm Sunil.

743
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:51,061
I'm an inspector on duty.

744
01:30:52,419 --> 01:30:56,933
Till I find who stole this necklace
from my mother and gave it to...

745
01:30:57,424 --> 01:30:58,664
.your sister, I can't free you.

746
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,371
How strange...

747
01:31:02,363 --> 01:31:05,041
The necklace that adorned
your mother's neck is...

748
01:31:06,367 --> 01:31:08,044
.now a sin in my sister's neck!

749
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:15,051
Inspector, you have got back
what belonged to you.

750
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:18,722
For God's sake,
don't push the matter.

751
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:23,760
This matter won't end till
the thief is behind bars...

752
01:31:24,251 --> 01:31:25,762
I beg you, for my love...

753
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:32,769
This is not a love story. The law
has to present the culprit in court.

754
01:31:33,427 --> 01:31:37,440
Try to understand. I don't
want you to go to court.

755
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:39,776
Tell me everything.

756
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:42,946
I can't do anything for you.

757
01:31:44,438 --> 01:31:46,116
You can do nothing for me.

758
01:31:49,476 --> 01:31:51,121
You can do nothing for me.

759
01:31:55,482 --> 01:32:00,096
Then listen... it's the
same man you know very well!

760
01:32:01,422 --> 01:32:02,933
I knew it!

761
01:32:21,442 --> 01:32:23,119
Did Shyam come here?

762
01:32:24,478 --> 01:32:28,491
I swear he hasn't come to
this shop for many days.

763
01:32:29,483 --> 01:32:33,163
He will come here.
Listen to me carefully.

764
01:32:34,488 --> 01:32:39,169
If you don't inform the police,
I'll have your shop permanently closed!

765
01:32:39,994 --> 01:32:41,171
I've understood.

766
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,844
I need something!

767
01:32:48,502 --> 01:32:50,847
I need 5000 bucks immediately.

768
01:32:52,506 --> 01:32:54,851
Sometimes you want 2000 or 5000.

769
01:32:55,543 --> 01:32:58,188
This is Sevakram's shop not
the Punjab National Bank!

770
01:32:59,547 --> 01:33:01,187
You can make the
arrangements if you wish!

771
01:33:02,483 --> 01:33:05,128
You yourself can arrange it!

772
01:33:07,488 --> 01:33:11,668
Money runs after you and
you run in front of it.

773
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:16,173
Sampat has seen his
master's vault number.

774
01:33:17,498 --> 01:33:22,679
It contains millions of rupees.
If you wish, tonight... get it?

775
01:33:28,509 --> 01:33:31,688
I'll go and meet Sampat.

776
01:34:48,122 --> 01:34:50,967
What stolen booty have
you come to give me today?

777
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:53,970
Stolen booty?

778
01:34:59,633 --> 01:35:01,244
You think I love your money.

779
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:04,748
- I love your gifts.
- Why are you talking like this?

780
01:35:05,573 --> 01:35:08,251
You think I'm a stage dancer!

781
01:35:09,076 --> 01:35:10,754
Who adorns herself with your money!

782
01:35:11,612 --> 01:35:13,256
Who embraces your gifts!

783
01:35:14,115 --> 01:35:15,759
I'm not that kind of woman!

784
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:20,297
If I didn't have to pay off father's
debt, I'd never dance on stage!

785
01:35:23,624 --> 01:35:28,972
No girl from a decent family
would like to dance on stage.

786
01:35:30,631 --> 01:35:33,977
But I never said you're
that kind of a woman.

787
01:35:34,635 --> 01:35:37,314
Then why did you put a
stolen necklace in my neck?

788
01:35:41,642 --> 01:35:42,986
Why are you silent?

789
01:35:47,181 --> 01:35:49,326
You've repaid me well for my love.

790
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,750
How do I tell you that I
haven't stolen that necklace?

791
01:36:08,636 --> 01:36:10,313
I know you won't believe it today.

792
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:13,817
Anyway...

793
01:36:16,677 --> 01:36:18,321
I'll surrender to the police.

794
01:36:20,681 --> 01:36:22,325
No!

795
01:36:24,685 --> 01:36:27,364
You didn't try to think...

796
01:36:30,691 --> 01:36:32,369
I won't let you go up.

797
01:36:33,027 --> 01:36:34,871
Get out of my way
or Shyam will escape!

798
01:36:35,696 --> 01:36:38,875
2 young girls live here alone
I can't permit you to enter my bedroom

799
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:42,212
Hurry or Shyam will
make a run for it!

800
01:36:54,915 --> 01:36:58,095
You check the terrace
and you go downstairs!

801
01:37:54,308 --> 01:37:57,621
He escaped but left behind evidence.

802
01:37:58,979 --> 01:38:00,924
- Where did you find it?
- On the terrace.

803
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:05,595
It's so sad that you're
still trying to save him.

804
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:10,100
His crimes and sentence
will keep on increasing.

805
01:38:10,925 --> 01:38:13,103
Hand him over to the police
if you wish his welfare.

806
01:38:13,928 --> 01:38:15,605
That is best for you too.

807
01:38:18,932 --> 01:38:22,612
Don't forget that Shyam is
a thief, Vagabond and cheat.

808
01:38:25,473 --> 01:38:27,117
Thief, Vagabond and cheat.

809
01:38:33,981 --> 01:38:35,492
You are very lucky.

810
01:38:36,984 --> 01:38:38,904
You've found yourself
a man like inspector Sunil.

811
01:38:40,988 --> 01:38:44,668
He comes from a decent, noble family.

812
01:38:45,326 --> 01:38:46,670
Nothing is lost even now.

813
01:38:57,004 --> 01:38:59,182
This was my lost son's locket.

814
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,986
I well remember it
was in Madan's hand.

815
01:39:03,977 --> 01:39:07,624
This very locket.
You had bought it.

816
01:39:08,482 --> 01:39:11,661
22 years ago from
the Ambani garden.

817
01:39:12,987 --> 01:39:14,664
Try to recall.
Look at it carefully.

818
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:27,344
- How is it?
- Very good, Papa!

819
01:39:28,001 --> 01:39:30,680
- But what is it called?
- It's called a locket.

820
01:39:31,505 --> 01:39:35,051
- What did you buy?
- I bought a locket!

821
01:39:36,043 --> 01:39:39,556
- I too want a locket!
- We'll buy you one too.

822
01:39:40,047 --> 01:39:43,193
Since I bought one for you, I'll
have to buy one fro Sunil too.

823
01:39:44,051 --> 01:39:45,228
Come on.

824
01:39:50,558 --> 01:39:53,403
Why don't you speak?
Do you remember?

825
01:39:54,061 --> 01:39:57,240
The eyes of a father can be deceived.

826
01:39:58,065 --> 01:39:59,743
Not a mother's love.

827
01:40:01,068 --> 01:40:03,246
Did you hear, Sunil?
Shyam is our son!

828
01:40:04,071 --> 01:40:07,751
- A thief, Vagabond...
- Whatever, he's our son!

829
01:40:08,609 --> 01:40:09,753
Go and get him.

830
01:40:12,112 --> 01:40:15,759
Go! Please tell Sunil.

831
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,797
What are you thinking of?

832
01:40:22,623 --> 01:40:24,301
What Will I think?

833
01:40:28,129 --> 01:40:32,809
The thief, Vagabond and cheat
turned out to be my own son.

834
01:40:34,135 --> 01:40:40,817
Go, Sunil. Somehow catch him.

835
01:40:42,176 --> 01:40:45,689
Good day. I wish to
meet Miss Sangita.

836
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:48,825
- But you...
- I'm called Gurbachan Singh!

837
01:40:49,517 --> 01:40:52,362
- I've come from Simla.
- You may come from Himalaya...

838
01:40:53,187 --> 01:40:56,700
- What do you want from her?
- I've come to see her.

839
01:40:57,191 --> 01:40:59,869
This is not a gurudwara.
You are mistaken.

840
01:41:00,461 --> 01:41:02,306
I'm not mistaken!
You are trying to waylay me!

841
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:04,810
- You're very naughty!
- Talk respectfully.

842
01:41:06,133 --> 01:41:08,812
- Sangita is not home.
- You've gotten angry.

843
01:41:11,138 --> 01:41:12,649
Read this. What's written?

844
01:41:15,176 --> 01:41:17,821
Why didn't you say
you own Simla Stage?

845
01:41:19,179 --> 01:41:22,525
- Please come in.
- I say, good day!

846
01:41:24,184 --> 01:41:26,530
He owns the Simla Stage Company.

847
01:41:27,187 --> 01:41:29,866
He's come to meet you.
Please sit down.

848
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:34,537
- Please sit down.
- Of course I will!

849
01:41:35,196 --> 01:41:37,374
I swear, Gurbachan Singh
you are very lucky!

850
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:42,545
You are treated so well.
Isn't it daughter? Am I lying?

851
01:41:43,204 --> 01:41:45,883
- Sir!
- Swear, my name is Gurbachan Singh!

852
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:49,219
From Simla! Recognize me?

853
01:41:51,245 --> 01:41:53,256
Oh yes! I met you in Simla hotel.

854
01:41:54,248 --> 01:41:57,594
- Am I lying?
- Not at all sir!

855
01:41:58,252 --> 01:42:00,197
- He's one of Simla's...
- Enough!

856
01:42:00,688 --> 01:42:03,367
- Too much praise is bad.
- What can I do for you?

857
01:42:04,191 --> 01:42:07,204
Swear by God, I'm
here to serve you!

858
01:42:08,195 --> 01:42:10,540
If I can help you,
my life is fulfilled!

859
01:42:11,032 --> 01:42:13,543
- What do you want to say?
- What's there to say?

860
01:42:14,201 --> 01:42:16,546
My company is not short of funds.

861
01:42:17,204 --> 01:42:22,252
We only need a heroine. If you
join us, our problems will be solved.

862
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:24,990
You give your acceptance
and our hurdles are crossed!

863
01:42:25,245 --> 01:42:26,890
- Am I lying, dear?
- No sir.

864
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,261
- Yes?
- I'm not worth the stage.

865
01:42:32,253 --> 01:42:34,764
Don't you worry.
We'll solve everything.

866
01:42:35,256 --> 01:42:38,602
I'll make your leg stage worthy
Yes, dear. Did I lie?

867
01:42:38,992 --> 01:42:40,152
- No.
- Why should you bother?

868
01:42:40,595 --> 01:42:42,673
I don't understand this.
I just want to help you.

869
01:42:43,263 --> 01:42:46,443
I've come to earth to help people.
Dear, am I lying?

870
01:42:47,268 --> 01:42:50,447
Not at all sir.
But why do you object?

871
01:42:51,272 --> 01:42:53,283
- Why do you want to ruin matters?
- Ask her.

872
01:42:53,974 --> 01:42:56,486
No, Sushma. I'm scared.
If my leg doesn't get better?

873
01:42:56,977 --> 01:42:58,988
It's my job to see that.
I swear by God!

874
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:02,425
You just get yourself treated.
My name is Gurbachan Singh.

875
01:43:03,084 --> 01:43:05,262
- Just sign this.
- I won't sign anything

876
01:43:05,753 --> 01:43:07,873
- I won't keep you in the dark.
- There's no darkness.

877
01:43:08,255 --> 01:43:10,600
My name is Gurbachan!

878
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:13,937
I'll get you treated too.
Dear girl, tell her.

879
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:16,440
- Sign it. - But...
- Your leg will get better.

880
01:43:17,265 --> 01:43:20,443
It will. Take the Lord's name
and put your signature here.

881
01:43:24,271 --> 01:43:27,951
Great! Swear you are fortunate!

882
01:43:28,809 --> 01:43:31,321
Wherever you go, you're treated well.

883
01:43:32,312 --> 01:43:33,957
Now my honor is in your hands.

884
01:43:35,315 --> 01:43:38,495
Take these 5000 rupees from me
and begin your treatment.

885
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,997
I'll meet you in the hospital.

886
01:43:47,828 --> 01:43:49,673
What a noble man you are!

887
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:53,009
I'm not noble!
It's the Lord's mercy.

888
01:43:54,335 --> 01:43:56,012
- Am I lying, dear?
- No sir.

889
01:43:56,837 --> 01:43:58,515
I'll take leave. Goodbye.

890
01:43:59,707 --> 01:44:02,285
Good bye. Praise be the Lord.

891
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:06,323
Open your eyes, son.
You hit me hard.

892
01:44:08,315 --> 01:44:09,659
Hello, Sangita.

893
01:44:10,317 --> 01:44:13,329
- Who was he?
- The owner of a theater.

894
01:44:14,321 --> 01:44:15,801
He has signed a
contract with Sangita.

895
01:44:16,323 --> 01:44:17,734
But how will you work?

896
01:44:18,326 --> 01:44:21,504
That's what's worth noting.
Your father too is an owner...

897
01:44:22,329 --> 01:44:24,507
And this is another who is
treating Sangita's leg!

898
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:29,012
Congratulations, Sangita.
He really is a good man.

899
01:45:08,876 --> 01:45:11,387
Sangita is fine!
Her leg is normal!

900
01:45:11,879 --> 01:45:13,023
I'm very happy!

901
01:45:15,382 --> 01:45:16,894
Congratulations, your leg is fine.

902
01:45:17,384 --> 01:45:20,063
- Sir...
- Gurbachan..

903
01:45:21,388 --> 01:45:23,400
- I've come...
- From Simla.

904
01:45:24,391 --> 01:45:27,571
- Thank you very much.
- Sir is here.

905
01:45:28,061 --> 01:45:29,906
- Good day.
- Take a seat.

906
01:45:30,397 --> 01:45:31,408
Congratulations.

907
01:45:32,066 --> 01:45:34,077
- My leg is normal now.
- I had already told you.

908
01:45:34,902 --> 01:45:37,581
If I had wished anything
else, it would have come true.

909
01:45:38,139 --> 01:45:40,083
- Do I lie?
- Not at all.

910
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:42,752
I can never forget your favour.

911
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:45,789
There's no obligation.

912
01:45:46,447 --> 01:45:48,458
This is all thanks to God!

913
01:45:49,116 --> 01:45:50,127
Sit down, sir.

914
01:45:50,951 --> 01:45:55,132
- You are an angel.
- Angel...! I'm no angel.

915
01:45:55,956 --> 01:45:58,468
You are being too kind.
I'm a sinner.

916
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,071
- Am I lying, dear?
- No sir. Not at all.

917
01:46:01,895 --> 01:46:05,409
Now I want you to get well soon.

918
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:10,814
Let's hurry to Simla for such a
quick drama that Simla will be agog!

919
01:46:11,405 --> 01:46:13,917
Who is the hero of your stage?

920
01:46:15,442 --> 01:46:19,589
We'll find one. Yes.
Or I'll quickly become one!

921
01:46:20,448 --> 01:46:22,593
What do you think?

922
01:46:24,451 --> 01:46:28,798
- You...?
- You own the company. You can play all the roles.

923
01:46:29,457 --> 01:46:32,135
You're my only clever child.

924
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,139
- I too am your...
- What are you saying?

925
01:46:37,465 --> 01:46:41,812
I have just one daughter,
bright future...

926
01:46:42,469 --> 01:46:44,481
I'm your slave.

927
01:46:45,472 --> 01:46:48,151
- Pardon?
- I'll sign on a blank paper if you don't trust me.

928
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:52,155
You can write whatever you
want in it. Am I lying...?

929
01:46:54,014 --> 01:46:56,159
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

930
01:46:57,518 --> 01:46:59,529
I've sold my life here.

931
01:47:00,454 --> 01:47:02,632
I'll meet you in Simla.

932
01:47:03,457 --> 01:47:05,635
The door is here.
Where are you going?

933
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:10,140
How does it matter if the window
or door is here or there. Let me go!

934
01:47:10,964 --> 01:47:13,143
What does your father lose?

935
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:15,645
- It's very high.
- I am very tall! Let go!

936
01:47:24,512 --> 01:47:26,523
- Stop!
- Inspector...

937
01:47:27,014 --> 01:47:28,358
- Who was it?
- Shyam! Who else?

938
01:48:03,517 --> 01:48:05,195
Stop or I'll shoot!

939
01:48:11,525 --> 01:48:12,702
I say, stop!

940
01:48:15,529 --> 01:48:17,207
Stop or I'll shoot!

941
01:48:58,105 --> 01:49:00,465
- Sir, we didn't find him.
- Let's go back. Driver, come on.

942
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:18,768
I'll close down your
shop permanently.

943
01:49:19,593 --> 01:49:20,604
Understood?

944
01:49:28,602 --> 01:49:29,779
Understood!

945
01:49:35,643 --> 01:49:37,287
- Good day.
- Good day.

946
01:49:42,649 --> 01:49:43,794
Good day.

947
01:50:01,669 --> 01:50:03,347
Lord! Good Lord!

948
01:50:15,716 --> 01:50:17,394
Good day.

949
01:50:59,794 --> 01:51:01,905
Welcome. Sit down.

950
01:55:29,997 --> 01:55:31,675
Mister Shyam...

951
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,345
I am your boy...

952
01:55:36,003 --> 01:55:40,017
- You're not with the police?
No, I work for Sewakram.

953
01:55:41,041 --> 01:55:46,690
- Then why are you following me?
- My master has asked you to see him.

954
01:55:48,049 --> 01:55:51,728
- Why?
- Because you want 5000 bucks.

955
01:55:52,553 --> 01:55:54,731
He said the cash is ready.

956
01:55:56,056 --> 01:55:59,236
- Come and get it.
- Go and tell Sevakram.

957
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:03,173
I don't need his money.
Shyam is dead.

958
01:56:03,997 --> 01:56:07,678
I've given up bad deeds.
Go and tell him that!

959
01:56:10,003 --> 01:56:12,515
- He will beat me up...
- If you don't go, I will!

960
01:56:20,047 --> 01:56:23,393
First drink some milk.
I've been waiting for long.

961
01:56:28,055 --> 01:56:29,399
What happened?

962
01:56:30,057 --> 01:56:31,734
Nothing father.

963
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,572
- Shyam escaped once again.
- Got away again?

964
01:56:36,063 --> 01:56:37,241
Now what happens?

965
01:56:38,065 --> 01:56:40,077
Mother, we haven't given up.

966
01:56:41,068 --> 01:56:43,747
But he can be arrested sooner
if father so desires.

967
01:56:44,405 --> 01:56:46,750
That's what I want!
Tell me what I can do.

968
01:56:47,608 --> 01:56:49,586
You will have to go
to Sangita once.

969
01:56:51,111 --> 01:56:54,124
- To Sangita?
- Yes.

970
01:56:55,116 --> 01:56:56,556
You will have to bring her to stage.

971
01:56:57,117 --> 01:56:59,796
Bring her to stage?

972
01:57:05,058 --> 01:57:06,403
But why...?

973
01:57:07,061 --> 01:57:10,740
- To arrest Shyam.
- To arrest Shyam?

974
01:57:13,067 --> 01:57:15,078
But what has Shyam's arrest
got to do with her?

975
01:57:15,736 --> 01:57:18,748
It is related. Sangita
means the world to Shyam.

976
01:57:20,074 --> 01:57:21,954
Whatever he has done so
far is only for Sangita.

977
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:26,623
He stole the necklace for her.
Sold his house to save her house.

978
01:57:27,114 --> 01:57:30,127
He committed theft in our
house to treat her leg.

979
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:33,797
So that Sangita can return
to the world of theater.

980
01:57:35,122 --> 01:57:37,801
If Sangita performs on stage,
Shyam will surely come to see her.

981
01:57:40,127 --> 01:57:42,539
Shyam will come to see her.

982
01:57:45,132 --> 01:57:47,811
Yes father. You will get
your son, I'll get my culprit.

983
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:55,819
Yes, you'll get your culprit.

984
01:57:57,177 --> 01:57:58,822
He was right.

985
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:02,759
Life has many twists.

986
01:58:04,118 --> 01:58:07,798
Someday life will take such
a turn that you will be shocked.

987
01:58:09,122 --> 01:58:10,567
Your face will turn pale.

988
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:15,305
That day you'll go back to Sangita
who is helpless today because of you!

989
01:58:16,463 --> 01:58:20,810
That day you will think of
this handsome, 6 foot man.

990
01:58:22,136 --> 01:58:23,814
You will go back to Sangita.

991
01:58:25,639 --> 01:58:32,823
That day you will think of
this handsome, 6 foot man.

992
01:58:40,688 --> 01:58:42,866
Who...? sir!

993
01:58:44,191 --> 01:58:46,870
- Good day. - Thakur...
- Please come in.

994
01:58:48,195 --> 01:58:52,876
Congratulations. I'm very
glad to see you normal.

995
01:58:54,201 --> 01:58:56,880
Who else would be happy.
Please take a seat.

996
01:59:01,175 --> 01:59:02,819
Thakur has come to our house.

997
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:04,521
- Good day.
- Good day.

998
01:59:05,179 --> 01:59:07,657
Now you don't have any
trouble with your foot?

999
01:59:09,183 --> 01:59:11,862
Is your theater sad without my sister?

1000
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:16,366
Now forget about that.
I've come for some work.

1001
01:59:17,191 --> 01:59:20,870
Why did you come? You
could have sent the manager?

1002
01:59:22,196 --> 01:59:24,196
We'll vacate this house
as soon as we find another.

1003
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:27,710
- This is not regarding the house.
- Then what is it about?

1004
01:59:28,202 --> 01:59:29,879
What other relation do we share?

1005
01:59:31,205 --> 01:59:35,885
He has come home and we don't
treat guests in this manner.

1006
01:59:38,245 --> 01:59:39,756
But he taught us this behavior!

1007
01:59:40,247 --> 01:59:41,891
But we won't do it.

1008
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:45,210
Or what will be the difference
between him and us?

1009
01:59:45,753 --> 01:59:47,764
Forget about that.

1010
01:59:48,255 --> 01:59:52,936
I am very embarrassed. It's now
that I realize how small the world is

1011
01:59:54,261 --> 01:59:57,941
Money does not always help.
Man does need another man.

1012
01:59:59,767 --> 02:00:01,778
I need your help.

1013
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:05,448
My help? What am I worthy of?

1014
02:00:07,308 --> 02:00:09,953
How do I say it? You'll have
to perform on stage once more.

1015
02:00:11,311 --> 02:00:14,758
- On stage?
- No, My sister won't dance in your theater!

1016
02:00:15,816 --> 02:00:19,663
Miss Sangita, you can
bring my hopes to life again.

1017
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,999
My family would be highly obliged.

1018
02:00:23,824 --> 02:00:26,002
This is need not business.

1019
02:00:27,328 --> 02:00:31,841
Forgive me but I can't help you.

1020
02:00:32,333 --> 02:00:33,510
Don't say that!

1021
02:00:34,334 --> 02:00:38,015
Your acquiescence can
bring back something...

1022
02:00:38,839 --> 02:00:41,018
that I lost 22 years ago.

1023
02:00:42,376 --> 02:00:45,522
Forget that I'm Thakur!
Forget that I'm a businessman!

1024
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:48,024
It's a question of just one show!

1025
02:00:50,384 --> 02:00:54,064
This is the receipt of the debt
your father owed me. Nothing due.

1026
02:00:54,888 --> 02:00:57,067
Now this house is yours.
Everything is yours.

1027
02:00:57,725 --> 02:00:59,403
I want just one show.

1028
02:01:00,328 --> 02:01:04,841
We don't want anything.
Keep this paper with you!

1029
02:01:05,332 --> 02:01:07,677
- We will leave this house.
- No, Sushma.

1030
02:01:08,335 --> 02:01:10,847
I will dance for one show.

1031
02:01:12,339 --> 02:01:14,852
If father's debt can be
cleared with just one show...

1032
02:01:15,375 --> 02:01:19,022
the house father built will be
ours, then I'll dance for a show!

1033
02:01:19,713 --> 02:01:21,057
Begin preparations for the show.

1034
02:01:21,882 --> 02:01:24,027
I'll be eternally grateful!

1035
02:02:26,447 --> 02:02:28,091
Shyam will come. He surely will!

1036
02:02:28,482 --> 02:02:32,963
He hasn't come as yet and
I don't think he will come.

1037
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:41,972
Hurry up! The first bell has rung.

1038
02:02:42,462 --> 02:02:45,475
- Congratulations! It's a house full!
- House Full!

1039
02:02:46,467 --> 02:02:48,478
Thakur! Sir!

1040
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:52,482
How did you slip down the stairs?
You should have been careful.

1041
02:02:59,514 --> 02:03:01,959
Telephone the doctor
and ask him to come soon.

1042
02:03:04,952 --> 02:03:07,130
How terrible! Now what will happen?

1043
02:03:09,456 --> 02:03:10,968
The house is full!

1044
02:03:11,459 --> 02:03:14,638
- What's wrong with Sangita?
- Fell off the stairs and has a sprain!

1045
02:03:15,129 --> 02:03:16,473
Sprain? Now what happens?

1046
02:03:17,465 --> 02:03:19,443
- Who will dance on stage?
- That's what I'm thinking!

1047
02:03:19,467 --> 02:03:22,146
It's past nine! I've
rung the first bell!

1048
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:25,648
You sit with Sangita.
I'll arrange something.

1049
02:03:32,513 --> 02:03:35,025
- What is it?
- My honour is in your hands.

1050
02:03:35,516 --> 02:03:37,661
- What are you saying?
- Sangita has a sprain.

1051
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,866
I had warned you that
she shouldn't dance now.

1052
02:03:43,524 --> 02:03:45,535
You insisted and she agreed.

1053
02:03:46,027 --> 02:03:53,210
But if you dance instead of
Sangita, I'll be grateful!

1054
02:03:54,535 --> 02:03:55,545
I can't do this.

1055
02:03:56,537 --> 02:03:59,216
- Find another girl.
- Who could be better than you?

1056
02:04:00,474 --> 02:04:02,986
Right now my honour is
in your hands, save it.

1057
02:04:03,511 --> 02:04:05,989
Else people will break the chairs
and set the curtains on fire!

1058
02:04:06,013 --> 02:04:09,526
I just want today's show!

1059
02:04:10,017 --> 02:04:13,196
No, I won't appear on stage.

1060
02:04:14,522 --> 02:04:19,202
Sangita agreed to appear on stage
once to pay her father's debt.

1061
02:04:20,528 --> 02:04:24,875
Think of me as your father and
give me one show as charity.

1062
02:10:21,923 --> 02:10:25,435
I am sorry you could
not see Sangita on stage.

1063
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:28,438
That's my misfortune.

1064
02:10:33,935 --> 02:10:35,445
Shyam has been arrested!

1065
02:10:35,936 --> 02:10:38,115
I knew you'd arrest me someday.

1066
02:10:38,939 --> 02:10:41,618
Do you mean to say,
you are innocent?

1067
02:10:42,976 --> 02:10:45,488
- As if you'd believe me?
- No doubt about that.

1068
02:10:46,314 --> 02:10:49,325
If you were innocent, why did
you run away from Sangita's house?

1069
02:10:50,985 --> 02:10:53,330
I had to run for
somebody's helpless life.

1070
02:10:54,989 --> 02:10:58,334
If I hadn't run away that day,
the necklace for which you...

1071
02:10:58,993 --> 02:11:00,793
arrest me today,
you would have right then.

1072
02:11:01,262 --> 02:11:02,662
Do you know what would happen then?

1073
02:11:03,931 --> 02:11:05,608
Sangita would be a
cripple all her life.

1074
02:11:07,935 --> 02:11:13,283
It's my misfortune that I could
neither please the law nor my love.

1075
02:11:13,941 --> 02:11:16,119
Do your duty.

1076
02:11:25,987 --> 02:11:28,665
My son! My child!

1077
02:11:30,991 --> 02:11:35,339
Where had you gone, my baby?
I waited for you for years!

1078
02:11:37,999 --> 02:11:41,678
I went to every temple for you!

1079
02:11:42,503 --> 02:11:45,182
Does anyone leave like this?

1080
02:11:46,007 --> 02:11:47,684
Now I won't leave you for a minute!

1081
02:11:50,043 --> 02:11:54,191
Meet your son. See,
he's grown so tall!

1082
02:11:59,053 --> 02:12:05,168
You are mistaken. My name...
my name is not Madan.

1083
02:12:05,993 --> 02:12:07,671
It's Shyam.

1084
02:12:09,997 --> 02:12:11,675
You are not my son.

1085
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,678
Aren't you related to me?

1086
02:12:17,004 --> 02:12:18,348
No.

1087
02:12:24,045 --> 02:12:28,058
Then... that locket?

1088
02:12:29,049 --> 02:12:31,061
Where is that locket?

1089
02:12:32,052 --> 02:12:33,563
Show him that locket.

1090
02:12:38,058 --> 02:12:43,073
Isn't this yours? Your father
bought it for you in your childhood.

1091
02:12:44,065 --> 02:12:46,243
Try to recall, my child!

1092
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:49,746
He bought it for you.

1093
02:12:52,072 --> 02:12:57,120
You were very small then. I'd
taken you and Sunil to the market.

1094
02:12:58,112 --> 02:13:01,692
I bought it and slipped
it on your wrist myself.

1095
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:05,062
Do you remember?

1096
02:13:07,054 --> 02:13:09,065
You're making a mistake
in recognizing me.

1097
02:13:10,057 --> 02:13:11,735
I'm not your son, Madan.

1098
02:13:17,064 --> 02:13:19,743
Where did you find this locket?

1099
02:13:21,068 --> 02:13:22,579
I stole it from somebody.

1100
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:26,416
Can you tell us from whom?

1101
02:13:28,109 --> 02:13:29,252
Who was he?

1102
02:13:31,112 --> 02:13:35,458
You know inspector, nobody asks
for names before picking pockets.

1103
02:13:41,121 --> 02:13:42,799
Let's go, inspector.

1104
02:14:09,116 --> 02:14:10,761
My child!

1105
02:14:15,122 --> 02:14:16,800
My son, Madan!

1106
02:14:25,132 --> 02:14:26,810
My child!

1107
02:14:30,138 --> 02:14:31,315
Sun!

1108
02:14:39,179 --> 02:14:40,824
Mother!

1109
02:14:43,184 --> 02:14:44,828
My baby!

1110
02:15:00,167 --> 02:15:01,811
- My son...
- Father!

1111
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:07,817
Brother...

1112
02:16:25,753 --> 02:16:28,432
I had stolen 5000 bucks
from Thakur's house.

1113
02:16:28,922 --> 02:16:30,602
- Not Mister Shyam.
- I stole the necklace.

1114
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:35,606
May your tribe increase. I sold
the stolen necklace to Shyam.

1115
02:16:36,263 --> 02:16:37,774
I accept my crime.

1116
02:16:39,266 --> 02:16:42,612
I flicked the necklace when Shyam
came to return it to inspector.

1117
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:45,949
- Lock them all up!
- Come on.

1118
02:16:47,274 --> 02:16:48,452
Go!

1119
02:16:50,310 --> 02:16:51,788
Silly girl! Why do you cry?

1120
02:16:52,313 --> 02:16:56,659
Why must you cry? We'll
get married soon as I'm free.

1121
02:16:57,651 --> 02:17:02,766
We'll have our own world.
A world with our own house.

1122
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:05,268
And our children. Little ones...

1123
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:09,773
Dark ones, fair ones. Some
like you, some like me...

1124
02:17:11,265 --> 02:17:13,276
- What?
- Yes.

1125
02:17:14,268 --> 02:17:15,946
- Make me a promise.
- What?

1126
02:17:19,773 --> 02:17:23,286
You won't make the
kids like yourself

1127
02:17:27,315 --> 02:17:28,959
Never.

1128
02:17:30,318 --> 02:17:31,661
Happy?
