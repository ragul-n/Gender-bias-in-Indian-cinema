As long as you live, live happily

14
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,960
Live happily

15
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,700

A robber mingled with others

21
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,320
A good man

22
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,270
A good man seems bad to you

23
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,100
And a bad man seems good

24
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,340
Good and bad are
mere tricks of the eyes

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,730

Joy arrives. Sorrow arrives

One station departs

31
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,640
Joy and sorrow are

Chugs.

36
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,990
Wow! Wow, Roopa!

37
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,110
You have a beautiful voice.

38
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,570
You dance so well. Amazing!

39
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,060
Now you have started
dancing on your toes.

40
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,470
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Professor.

41
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,670
I'm not capable of dancing on my toes.

42
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,840
I have taught many great people.

43
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,660
You just need
someone to make you dance.

44
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,460
And the world dances.

45
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,830
You are great, Mr. Professor.

46
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,710
- You found out now?
- Yes.

47
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,390
Ma'am has a problem.

48
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,920
Master.

49
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,640
- Now our company won't go bankrupt.
- Here.

50
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,000
Thanks.

51
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,050
Master, here. Have
some tobacco from Banaras.

52
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,360
Wow!

53
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,930
Those who consume it die.
Those who don't also die.

54
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,020
The creator has created
such an amazing thing.

55
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,940
Whom are you praising?

56
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,760
Nothing. I am praising this tobacco.

57
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,430
It's bitter and yet gives you a high.

58
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,670
Its smell is so strong
that your mouth reeks.

59
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,450
This tobacco.

60
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,190
Is that so?

61
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,890
Ma'am has a problem.

62
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,710
That's not something to
play with. Give it to me.

63
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,310
Talk from a distance, Mr. Professor.

64
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,060
I don't like scuffles.

65
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,790
Look, uncle. What a
beautiful necklace!

66
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,770
Shall I buy it for Rs.5?

67
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,130
Yes, dear.

68
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,900
Why didn't you say five pennies?

69
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,220
Give me my necklace. You
want to buy a pearl necklace.

70
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,110
Fine. Take Rs.10. Right, uncle?

71
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,220
Rs.10. As if you are
buying vegetables.

72
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,290
You silly girl. Each pearl
is worth not less than Rs.500.

73
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,650
- Rs.500.
- Yes.

74
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,850
So why didn't you say Rs.5000?

75
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,026
Ask him from where
he got so much money?

76
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,350
You stole it?

77
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,110
If you committed theft,
you've slandered yourself.

78
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,540
Take your necklace.

79
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,120
Why do you get angry, Roopa?

80
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,950
I have kept it for you. You
can take it whenever you want.

81
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,180
I don't want your necklace.

82
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,969
You tell me, uncle. Have I
ever taken anything for free?

83
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,580
Free, my foot.

84
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,330
People splurge such
necklaces on you adoringly.

85
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,820
I am telling you. You can
take it whenever you want.

86
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,550
I don't want it.

87
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,910
Keep your precious necklace with you.

88
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,800
- See that it's not stolen.
- What?

89
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,620
Uncle, come this side.

90
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,440
Tea.

91
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,150
Here. Sweet balls for you.

92
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,040
- Quiet. Someone will hear.
- So what if someone hears?

93
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,710
Eat it for my sake.

94
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,130
Uncle.

95
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,780
Shall be back on Thursday.

96
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,730
Cold drink.

97
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,510
Today's newspaper.

98
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,570
Did you see, uncle?

99
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,570
Clean body. Clean heart.

100
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,890
He seems so neat and clean.

101
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,740
Yes, dear. Seems to
belong to a decent family.

102
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,100
- Decent family?
- Yes.

103
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,750
That's why he didn't
look up even once.

104
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,320
Talk about yourself.

105
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,860
You were staring at him
as if you will devour him.

106
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,110
Why are you feeling envious?

107
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,130
Uncle, I liked him. So
I was looking at him.

108
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,990
Master, tell Roopa. One can't
judge what's good and what's bad...

109
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,730
by staring.

110
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,890
- But by assessing.
- Look.

111
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,870
Why is the train halting?

112
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,650
Why are the police coming here?

113
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,480
- They must be searching for a thief.
- Thief?

114
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,690
Ram Singh!

115
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,460
- Get me water.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,110
Thanks.

117
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,490
After so many days,
I got to drink cold water.

118
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,050
Have some more.

119
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,120
What do I tell you, sir?

120
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,010
I've been investigating
a case for so long.

121
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,670
These thieves and robbers
have harassed me tremendously.

122
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,440
There are thefts every other day.

123
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,280
And we have 'to wander
through villages and trains.

124
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,420
Sir, we have just received news
that a pearl necklace is missing.

125
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,800
And the amazing thing is that
it has been stolen so cleverly...

126
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,370
that you're flabbergasted.

127
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,240
But sir, theft can't be hidden.
No matter how hard one tries.

128
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,070
You are right.

129
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,650
Yes. But the thief only
thinks about the present.

130
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,680
Future holds misfortunes for him.

131
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,460
Did you burn your fingers?

132
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,810
Fingers? Right now
my heart is anxious.

133
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,550
You see, inspector. These
days I remain preoccupied.

134
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,920
Yes, sir. Your world is strange.

135
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,640
If I ever get a chance,
I will come to see your show.

136
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,930
Do come.

137
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,160
He is our master. Expert drum player.

138
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,670
And she is Ms. Roopa.

139
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,630
A living example of beauty and talent.

140
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,960
Inspector.

141
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,360
- May I ask you something?
- Yes. You can.

142
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,350
If the necklace thief is caught,
what punishment will he get?

143
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,960
Punishment?

144
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,700
He will rot in prison for seven years.

145
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,100
- Rot?
- Yes.

146
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,190
- Won't he be whipped?
- Yes. He will be whipped too.

147
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,070
He will come to his senses.

148
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,230
Once we nab him.

149
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,630
Yes. Listen.

150
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,500
Thanks.

151
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,130
Where are you going?

152
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,490
Santosh Nagar.

153
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,610
What a place, sir!

154
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,310
Small hills.

155
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,360
Gushing, flowing, charming river.

156
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,970
It's a strange place.

157
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,556
Maybe you are going
there for a vacation.

158
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,560
No. I am going there for work.

159
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,910
I am an engineer.

160
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,580
And my company wants to build...

161
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,770
a new town near Santosh Nagar.

162
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,000
There will be schools, hospitals...

163
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,100
parks for children.

164
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,520
- All things in the world...
- What a beautiful dream!

165
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,740
Yes. That's true.

166
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,230
- In your dream town...
- Can I get a place, engineer?

167
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,290
What did I say, uncle?
Did I make a mistake?

168
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,320
What mistake?

169
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,730
Look, engineer. We should
also get a place in your town.

170
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,310
Yes. Surely.
Look, I will give you a form.

171
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,890
- Yes.
- Fill it and then submit it.

172
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,940
- Here.
- Thanks.

173
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
- Listen.
- Yes.

174
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,630
- The form.
- Yes.

175
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,010
- Okay, sir. Pleased to meet you.
- Yes.

176
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,690
Porter.

177
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,200
If you ever need me, do come.

178
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,640
- I'll be pleased to meet you.
- What? Yes. Certainly.

179
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,406
Come to the police
station whenever you want.

180
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,020
- Police station.
- That's home for me.

181
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,060
Okay.

182
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,140
Thanks.

183
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,640
Do come.

184
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,720
Okay.

185
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,609
Porter, come here.

186
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,840
Sir, I am pleased to meet you.

187
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,090
I don't feel like leaving you.

188
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,690
We ate together, sat together,
traveled together in the train.

189
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
And yet I didn't ask you your name.

190
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,810
- My name is Ratan.
- Ratan.

191
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,080
You are truly a gem.

192
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,570
- Pardon me. My name is Biharilal Professor.
- Okay.

193
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,670
And I am the owner
of this small company.

194
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,330
- This musical company?
- Yes. - Okay.

195
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,160
I am the owner,
producer, director. Everything.

196
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,440
Okay, tell me. Where are you staying?

197
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,060
- Dilkhush Hotel.
- Dilkhush Hotel.

198
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,170
Great! Town is Santosh Nagar.

199
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,470
- Hotel is Dilkhush. And your name is...
- Ratan.

200
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,660
- So do you know her?
- I..

201
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,360
This lady.

202
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,960
My name is Roopa.

203
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,290
- Okay. I will leave now.
- Wait, sir.

204
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,400
You still didn't hear
my company's praises.

205
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,380
As such, it's a small company.

206
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,460
But I swear. In whichever city we go,
we receive tremendous applause.

207
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,580
- I will leave now.
- Listen to me.

208
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,640
Look, it is 1 o'clock.
I am in a hurry.

209
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,470
Okay. So you are really leaving.

210
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,510
Roopa.

211
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,150
He took the necklace. And
you are just standing here.

212
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,860
Tell me. How can I help you?

213
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,600
If you say, shall I
call the inspector?

214
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,830
What will you call him?
I will call him myself.

215
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,240
Didn't you hear? He will be
sentenced for seven years.

216
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,330
He will have to rot there.
He will be whipped.

217
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,760
Why should he rot?

218
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,156
Is he a thief? Or you are a thief?

219
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,720
You will know right away.

220
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,210
- Inspector.
- No.

221
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,610
Wait. I have some work with you.

222
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,260
Tell me, Mr. Professor?
What work do you have?

223
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,910
I will just come.

224
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,810
- Are you going or not?
- Yes. I am going.

225
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,170
Ma'am has a problem.

226
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,280
Thief!

227
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,340
After all, where do you want to go?

228
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,120
Wish you could know
where I want to go.

229
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,910
Look, I don't understand riddles.
Tell me clearly.

230
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,690
The driver will drop you
wherever you want to go.

231
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,680
Hey! Listen!

232
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,870
- I don't want to hear anything.
- But listen to me.

233
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,290
Engineer.

234
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,080
Listen to me, engineer.

235
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,890
Helplessness makes a person go crazy.

236
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,790
When I came, I had fever.
And now I am feeling cold.

237
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,240
- You have fever?
- No. I feel cold.

238
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,040
Listen. Give me your coat.

239
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,920
Oh! Coat.

240
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,330
- Here. Sweater.
- This?

241
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,890
I won't feel warm if I wear this.

242
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,250
- I want your coat.
- This will protect you from cold.

243
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,430
No. Only a coat can
protect me from cold.

244
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,740
You see, this is another kind of cold.

245
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,910
Where are you going,
leaving me in trouble?

246
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,940
Engineer, you can
leave me wherever you want.

247
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,850
But this jungle...

248
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,180
Thanks.

249
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,080
- Driver, let's go.
- And you?

250
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,220
- I am fine.
- Driver, stop the car.

251
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,620
- Let's go.
- I said stop the car.

252
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,280
If you don't like to sit
with me, I will get down.

253
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,900
- Take your precious sweater.
- Let's go.

254
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,520
Listen.

255
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,740
- The station is far.
- So what can I do?

256
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,560
You only said not to
leave you in trouble.

257
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,580
If you want, I can
drop you to the station.

258
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,250
- Yes. But on one condition.
- Yes?

259
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,600
- You will sit with me in the car.
- Fine.

260
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,220
Let's go.

261
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,900
- Come.
- Let's go.

262
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,640
Driver, let's go.

263
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,980
Love is shining in your eyes.

264
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,170
Love is shining in my eyes?

265
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,280
This is the same love in the
quest of which people wander around.

266
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,060
They go crazy.

267
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,880
Roopa.

268
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,750
Your face reveals you
don't like this man.

269
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,770
And you can't even ignore him.

270
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,490
- What about the necklace?
- What else?

271
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,610
For your necklace, I played
a charade, I swore and lied...

272
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,590
Ma'am has a problem.

273
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,040
You played a charade.
You moved heaven and earth.

274
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,340
You toiled hard. But
give me my necklace.

275
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,090
- But I didn't get your necklace.
- You didn't?

276
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,080
Ma'am has a problem.

277
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,900
What joke is this? How did you
return without the necklace?

278
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,970
Give me my necklace.

279
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,286
He is not a thief that I would have...

280
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,650
snatched the necklace from him.

281
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,690
You will know. He will rot in prison.

282
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,080
If I don't teach him a lesson,
my name is not Bihari.

283
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,320
I will go to the inspector.

284
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,280
Don't get angry. Anger is bad.

285
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,310
- You?
- People call me Mr. Diwan.

286
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,300
I am a small landlord here.

287
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,560
You are in trouble.

288
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes. I am in trouble.

289
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,220
If I could get a place to
stay and some space to perform...

290
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,310
my problem will be solved.

291
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,800
I will solve your problem.

292
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,190
Come with me.

293
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,700
A good deed needs no permission.
Let's go.

294
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
Bhola.

295
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,520
You are silent since 16 years.

296
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,080
Won't you speak at all?

297
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,630
Why do you rub salt on my wounds?

298
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,870
Puff away your sorrow.

299
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,550
Nanhi used to play with it.

300
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,750
It's been 16 years
since we lost Nanhi.

301
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,550
Look.

302
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,930
Roopa.

303
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,490
Sorry. I came here by mistake.

304
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,930
Roopa, you have come to ask something.

305
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,740
How do you do?

306
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,200
How are you?

307
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,460
From where is this sound coming?

308
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,690
How are you?

309
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,740
- It speaks.
- It chatters too.

310
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,490
You are insulting me.

311
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,580
Yes. How are you?

312
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,420
I am fine.

313
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,820
Did you see these shoes?

314
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,540
Seems to be of a kid.

315
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,610
She used to wear it 16 years ago.

316
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,100
- It belongs to Nanhi?
- Yes.

317
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,400
Keep quiet.

318
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,110
Yes. What did you want to ask?

319
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,400
How far is Dilkhush hotel from here?

320
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,590
It's about 2-3 miles from here.

321
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,700
Your eyes reveal you want to
reach there as soon as possible.

322
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,420
- Yes.
- You are craving to meet someone.

323
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,660
Professor.

324
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,560
Hello, Mr. Diwan.

325
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,170
Do you have any problem in my house?

326
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,520
What problem can
I have when you are there?

327
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,420
- I'm just preparing for the show.
- Hello.

328
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,780
- Hello, inspector.
- Hello, Chandu. Hello.

329
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,450
How are you?

330
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,700
Look, inspector. Don't tickle me.

331
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,170
He is my special guest, Mr. Professor.

332
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,540
- And he is...
- I've already met him.

333
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,220
And we know each other well.

334
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,120
Sir, I am eager to see your show.

335
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,910
I don't know when my
wish will be fulfilled.

336
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:34,780
Even I am eager to see the show.

337
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,710
- Look, Chandu is also eager to see your show.
- Yes.

338
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,410
Sir, in a few days all will be alright

339
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,690
The rehearsals have begun.

340
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,130
Announcement has been made in town.

341
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,570
Professor
Biharilal's troupe is in town.

342
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,550
The bird flies away.

343
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,130
My heart is empty.

344
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,840
Come, dwell in it.

345
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,680
O beautiful bird, come dwell in it.

346
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,110
Come, dwell in it.

347
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,280
You will have to pay a
huge price, my beloved.

348
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,880
My beloved.

349
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,320
You will have to pay a
huge price, my beloved.

350
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,390
This bird feeds on love.

351
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,360
The bird flies away.

352
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,970
I will lay a trap with my eyes.

353
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,560
I will trap you quietly.

354
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,540
I will capture you in my heart.

355
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,700
I will lay a trap with my eyes.

356
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,750
I will trap you quietly.

357
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,530
I will capture you in my heart.

358
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,130
I don't need anything else.
I will be your queen.

359
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,270
I sing your glories all the time.

360
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,170
The bird flies away.

361
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,710
Wow! Wow!

362
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,960
Amazing!

363
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,220
You also dance so well.

364
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,370
These captivating charms,
this charming style.

365
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,660
It's your greatness,
sir. Or else I am nothing.

366
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,110
I enjoyed it a lot. What a dance!

367
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,030
You have only seen Lachchi's dance.

368
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,440
- You didn't hear her sing.
- Is that so? She even sings?

369
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,470
Sir, if Lachchi is
such a charming dancer...

370
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,230
and then her voice
is very melodious too..

371
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,040
I see. Her name is Lachchi?

372
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,650
Her name is Lachchi. And I am Chaila.

373
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,330
Lachchi. Chaila.

374
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,860
Chaila. Lachchi.

375
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,510
A match made in heaven!

376
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,370
- I think both of you...
- Are one, sir.

377
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,050
We can't live without each other.

378
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,220
Can a person part with his shadow?

379
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,200
You tell me, sir.

380
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,270
Can you separate fish from water?

381
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,520
Not at all.

382
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,840
Along with the dancer,
I will have to buy the fool too.

383
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,370
What do you mean?

384
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,480
I mean, I wanted
Lachchi to join our troupe.

385
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,500
- And me?
- Yes, you too.

386
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,880
Great! Sir, you are great!

387
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,560
Say it once more.

388
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,450
Lachchi.

389
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,770
Lachchu, bring water for him.

390
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,710
Listen. He is a very nice man.
Bring refreshing sherbet for him.

391
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,610
And listen, he is an admirer.

392
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,260
Bring special sherbet for him.

393
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,110
And listen, he is amazing.

394
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,880
Mix both of them and bring it for him.

395
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,560
Wow! Wow!

396
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,110
I was waiting for you for so long.

397
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,570
You have a problem.

398
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,740
Can I have a problem
when you are there?

399
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,880
Sir, I feel like kissing your feet.

400
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,800
I feel like laying my eyes
on the ground you walk on.

401
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,150
- As if your eyes are marble flooring.
- Come.

402
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,390
If only I had been lucky
to be Laila's necklace.

403
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,990
I would have been the necklace...

404
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,790
that would have
bothered the whole world.

405
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,110
Who is it? Who is in the room?

406
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,580
Laila.

407
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,790
But from where are you talking?

408
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,560
420 meter away.

409
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,570
I am in the bathroom.

410
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,080
- Roopa.
- Yes.

411
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,930
Give me my dressing
grown from the stand.

412
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,160
And the next command?

413
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,300
I will give it personally.

414
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,160
- Give me the gown quickly.
- Yes.

415
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,740
Why are you taking so long?

416
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,800
- I am asking, why are you taking so long?
- Nothing.

417
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,490
- Give me.
- Here. - The gown. - Here.

418
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,470
- Necklace.
- I will come just now.

419
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,460
Where are you?

420
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,240
I am taking a bath.

421
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,770
Who told you?

422
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,530
I thought I might also
feel hot on seeing you.

423
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,740
She is not a woman but trouble!

424
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,820
Come out.

425
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,200
Listen.

426
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,700
Yes?

427
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,590
Now I will also need your gown.

428
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,900
What nonsense!

429
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,430
Hello!

430
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,540
Give me the gown.

431
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,880
- Hello!
- Hello!

432
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,040
- Take the gown.
- Give it to me.

433
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,680
I am not so lucky.

434
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,860
We have only one car. And the
driver has gone to get married.

435
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,580
- You misunderstand me.
- No. In fact...

436
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,900
I understood you correctly.

437
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,120
- You want a car, don't you?
- Yes. - One moment.

438
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,700
Here is the key. And there...

439
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,900
Listen. I don't like this.

440
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,070
You are sitting there.
I am sitting here.

441
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,810
You look like a driver.

442
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,220
I can't remain quiet.

443
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,160
You shouldn't talk in a moving car.

444
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,770
What will happen if I speak?

445
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,890
Tell me.

446
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,360
Look. Look ahead.

447
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,850
You drive so well.

448
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,860
Did you get hurt?

449
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,230
Great! Your way of asking
from a distance is also good.

450
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,280
Yes. I am fine.

451
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,660
I can get up and dance as well.

452
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,240
Lachcho, our admirer says
he wants to see your dance.

453
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,760
Lachcho, today dance in such a way...

454
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,860
that the audience is mesmerized.

455
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,910
And all he says is, Wow!

456
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,490
Lachcho.

457
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,510
Fall in love with someone.

458
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
This life is short

459
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,900
Short.

460
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,760
Fall in love with someone.

461
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,120
Fall in love.

462
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,590
This life is short.

463
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,670
Short.

464
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,230
If you want to live, laugh and live.

465
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,140
Love for a while.

466
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,550
If you want to live, laugh and live.

467
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,670
Love for a while.

468
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,270
Surrender yourself to someone.

469
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,400
And make someone yours.

470
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,790
This life is short.

471
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,320
Short.

472
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,970
Be someone's lover.

473
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,140
Even if the world calls you crazy.

474
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,470
Be someone's lover.

475
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,700
Even if the world calls you crazy.

476
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,230
Smoldering in love is called living.

477
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,480
Smolder yourself.

478
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,280
This life is short.

479
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
Short.

480
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,350
Love is the immaturity of the eyes.

481
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,450
It's but a lovely immaturity.

482
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,830
Love is the immaturity of the eyes.

483
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,010
It's but a lovely immaturity.

484
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,510
Play this game of eyes.

485
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,910
Let eyes lock.

486
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,650
Play this game of eyes.

487
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,020
Let eyes lock.

488
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,320
This life is short.

489
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,920
Short.

490
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,860
Fall in love with someone.

491
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,970
Fall in love.

492
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,550
This life is short.

493
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,280
Short.

494
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,360
Come.

495
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,400
Tell me. Did you like my dance?

496
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,250
You are quiet. Say something.

497
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,860
It was okay. But it got over soon.

498
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,710
It means you loved my dance.

499
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,640
Uncle, listen. He loved my dance.

500
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,250
- Shall we do it once more?
- Fine. - Okay.

501
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,890
Listen, I will deck up and come.

502
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,820
Wow!

503
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,050
When you dance, time
comes to a standstill.

504
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,600
The entire universe watches.

505
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,990
Wow!

506
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,500
Lachcho.

507
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,290
She is my Lachcho.
Her name is Lachchi.

508
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,420
Listen, Lachchi. He liked our dance.

509
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,470
Shall we dance once more?
Fine. Come on.

510
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,940
Wow!

511
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,540
She dances so well.

512
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,610
The entire universe watches.
Time comes to a standstill.

513
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,840
Her dance is mind-blowing.

514
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,720
Look.

515
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,670
My beloved took
away my innocent heart.

516
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,700
Look.

517
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,240
My beloved took
away my innocent heart.

518
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,860
Look.

519
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,290
He didn't heed me.

520
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,390
He didn't listen to me.

521
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,710
I had no say in front of the tyrant.

522
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,850
I was left wondering.
What did you do?

523
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,670
My beloved took
away my innocent heart.

524
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:23,740
Look.

525
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,320
My beloved took
away my innocent heart.

526
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,090
Look.

527
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,880
I didn't know my
beloved is a thief too.

528
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,480
He is not only a thief,
but something else too.

529
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,360
He stole my heart
as well as my solace.

530
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,300
Look.

531
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,180
My beloved took
away my innocent heart.

532
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,890
Look.

533
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,780
- Did you like the performance?
- Yes.

534
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,880
But now permit me to leave.
It's quite late.

535
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,380
Look, do come tomorrow.

536
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,000
- If you say, I will come.
- Okay.

537
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,340
Oh no! I will come.

538
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,600
- Look, don't forget. Or else I'll be dejected.
- Okay.

539
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,170
- What?
- Yes.

540
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,430
Yes?

541
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,390
Listen.

542
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,140
Bye.

543
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,830
I said look here too.

544
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,380
Move. You are bad.

545
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:08,300
How charmingly you said move!

546
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,940
As if I am nobody.

547
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,560
Yes. Damsels are not trustworthy.

548
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,450
In a moment a dear
one becomes a stranger.

549
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,260
Ma'am has a problem.

550
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,080
- Give me my necklace.
- Necklace?

551
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,820
There is a limit of patience, Roopa.

552
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,690
You don't know how
restless I am to see the necklace.

553
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,950
Uncle, tell him. To return
the necklace to its real owner.

554
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,560
I am the real owner.

555
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,850
- It's not your necklace.
- So whose is it?

556
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,390
Roopa is right. You won't
benefit from such a possession.

557
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,990
You should have taken my side.

558
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,260
You are supporting her.

559
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,520
If the company suffers
a loss, I compensate.

560
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,920
If an artist goes missing,
I search for him here and there.

561
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,570
I bought the necklace
with great difficulty.

562
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,030
And somebody else should get it.

563
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,120
Roopa... return the necklace.

564
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,950
- Give me my necklace.
- Take your precious necklace.

565
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,140
Wait. I'll be right there. Wait.

566
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,360
I dupe wise men.

567
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,380
And she dupes me.

568
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,270
Ma'am has a problem.

569
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,030
No problem, Roopa. Keep it with you.

570
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,020
Maybe under this
pretext you will think of me.

571
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,530
I don't know who took it.
It was here just now.

572
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,920
Nobody must have taken it.
You must have given it to someone.

573
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,350
This is called brazen theft.

574
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,800
Look, you are accusing me.
I didn't give the necklace to anyone.

575
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,830
Believe me, Mr. Professor.
The necklace is missing.

576
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,570
I know your excuses very well.

577
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,460
You have the necklace.
Did you understand?

578
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,070
Uncle, the necklace is lost.

579
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,590
Lie. Deceit. Fraud.

580
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,110
Are you teaching me?

581
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,380
Uncle, tell her clearly.

582
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,026
If I don't get my
necklace by tomorrow...

583
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,540
there will be no one worse than me.

584
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,820
Did you understand?

585
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:42,160
You performed many
tricks to console your heart.

586
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,740
But to no avail.

587
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,230
You are again missing Nanhi today.

588
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,820
Tell me, Nanhi. How are you?

589
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,470
Chandu, her name is Roopa. Not Nanhi.

590
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,970
I will call her Nanhi.
What problem do you have?

591
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,260
When her name is Roopa,
why will you call her Nanhi?

592
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,030
You can call me Nanhi.

593
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,110
Did you see,
Mr. Diwan? I convinced her.

594
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,780
She is a kin.

595
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,060
Chandu is right.

596
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,076
I have come to you
considering you as my family.

597
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,560
Nanhi, have dinner.

598
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,080
Come.

599
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,780
Chandu, shall I ask you something?

600
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,730
Yes. Who has stopped you?

601
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,440
It's such a big house.
You live here alone?

602
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,480
- It's entirely his fault.
- Quiet.

603
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,610
He is used to living alone.

604
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,210
Don't you feel anxious?

605
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,070
He has learnt countless
tricks to console his heart.

606
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,070
- Chandu, will you eat?
- I don't eat.

607
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,750
- Why don't you eat?
- I don't feel hungry.

608
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,850
- Why don't you feel hungry?
- I don't get ration.

609
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:06,400
- Why don't you get ration?
- I don't have money.

610
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,630
Bhola, take him.

611
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,520
Nanhi, see Nanhi's
clothes before you go home.

612
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,630
This night, the rains
and this loneliness.

613
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,300
Come in.

614
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:32,180
This night, the rains
and this loneliness.

615
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,490
What if someone comes suddenly?

616
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,150
Hello.

617
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,990
Mr. Professor, tell me.
What brings you here?

618
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
- I told Roopa.
- Yes.

619
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,290
- To go to the engineer.
- Yes.

620
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,520
Oh, no!

621
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,900
But she said,
No, Mr. Professor. You only go.

622
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,530
And tell him.

623
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,630
I explained to her a lot.
But she didn't listen to me.

624
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,470
- Yes, engineer. Roopa wants the necklace.
- Necklace?

625
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,810
Yes. Tomorrow we are going
to perform 'Hamlet of Heart'.

626
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,000
You have also come to
establish a settlement.

627
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,790
- Do come.
- Yes. Certainly. - Necklace.

628
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:21,440
Yes. Have a seat. I
will bring the necklace.

629
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,210
Sir has a problem.

630
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:39,320
Engineer, it's locked.
If you bring the key...

631
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,360
Key?

632
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,130
I will get it.

633
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,550
Oh, no! Mr. Professor.

634
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,080
Yes. What happened?

635
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,270
I have kept the necklace in the bank.

636
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,800
- What?
- Yes.

637
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,660
- In the bank?
- This is a hotel.

638
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,790
Things can be misplaced here.

639
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,690
I might keep it somewhere and
then forget about it. That's why.

640
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,380
Let it be. I will bring it tomorrow.

641
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,170
- Fine. Tomorrow. Without fail.
- Without fail.

642
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,420
- Sure?
- Yes. Absolutely sure.

643
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,100
- Okay. So remember tomorrow.
- Yes.

644
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,840
- Boy.
- Yes, sir.

645
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,110
- Lemon please.
- Yes, sir.

646
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,220
- I found the necklace.
- Who had it?

647
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,840
Ask who has it?

648
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,490
Your engineer will bring
the necklace tomorrow.

649
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,320
How did it reach to him? Why
did you go there? Who told you?

650
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,000
Your name can be used everywhere.

651
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,780
So I used your name and went there.

652
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,670
You tricked an expert player like me.

653
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,390
- Say yes, Lachcho.
- No.

654
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,850
- Say yes.
- No.

655
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:24,640
Say yes, Lachcho. You
said no so gracefully.

656
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,310
Wow!

657
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,160
Lachcho.

658
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,560
- You're afraid of me. Should you fear a dear one?
- Lachcho.

659
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,090
Hello.

660
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,700
Did you see Lachcho anywhere?

661
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,680
You think I am Lachcho's bodyguard?

662
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,350
Your Lachcho is there. Go.

663
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,120
Thanks.

664
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,810
I forgot to say thanks.

665
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,360
Silly man. He says
thanks all the time.

666
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,220
And listen.

667
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,010
I asked him whether he
will surely bring it tomorrow.

668
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,170
He said absolutely sure.

669
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,690
Stay away from him. He might ruin you.

670
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,160
- Understood?
- Okay. - Okay.

671
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,750
My Lachcho.

672
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:27,990
There is consent as well as
refusal in these mesmerizing eyes.

673
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,730
Lachcho.

674
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:41,390
- At least talk to me.
- No.

675
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,940
No. Listen to me, my darling.

676
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,400
Lachcho.

677
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,970
They have turned the house into a zoo.

678
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,460
Lachcho.

679
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,640
Did you see my Lachcho?

680
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:03,280
- You think I'm an inquiry officer?
- Thanks.

681
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,690
Lachchi.

682
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,750
Lachchi, get up. We
have to go to the hotel.

683
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,180
Why?

684
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,410
We have to go and tell him that
I didn't ask for any necklace.

685
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,630
Why don't you go alone?

686
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,130
Look, my heart is weak.

687
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,930
Listen, he is in room number 27.

688
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,280
Get up.

689
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:44,910
And look, don't talk too
much with him. He is mentally../

690
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,530
Go. Go. Good girl. Go.

691
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,860
Yes. Come in.

692
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,460
She said...

693
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,050
Wait.

694
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,750
Bring another cup of tea.

695
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,070
Have tea.

696
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,120
- She is outside.
- Who?

697
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,590
That person.

698
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,920
- Not here. There.
- Where?

699
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,660
Downstairs.

700
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,820
Thank you.

701
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,890
I didn't ask for any necklace.

702
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,030
Why do you take the trouble?

703
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,570
- I speak the truth.
- What truth?

704
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,030
- Necklace.
- I don't need your necklace.

705
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,460
I also don't need your necklace.

706
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,820
Wait. I will get the key.

707
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,220
- What? Listen. Key?
- Yes. Key.

708
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,320
In that chest. I mean, that drawer.

709
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,340
- What?
- Necklace.

710
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,540
Oh no! No!

711
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:03,820
I mean key.

712
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,030
Here is the key.

713
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,580
Key? What key? Which key?
What do you want?

714
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,320
It's the key of that drawer
where your necklace is kept.

715
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,010
- I don't want the necklace.
- Come.

716
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,920
- I told you.
- Come. Come.

717
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,410
- Here's your necklace.
- Yes.

718
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,870
It's yours?

719
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,760
I found it in the car yesterday.

720
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,130
Car? How come it was in the car?

721
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,600
Under the seat.

722
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,560
When yesterday
because of you the car...

723
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,790
And you got...

724
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:47,620
I am so sorry.

725
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,570
It must have fallen then.

726
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,940
Here. You keep it.

727
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,960
No, no, I don't want it.

728
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,560
- Here.
- No.

729
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:58,230
- I want you to keep it.
- No.

730
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,290
I don't want it.

731
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,550
You take it.

732
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:10,200
Take it, and give it to her.

733
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,430
What's this?

734
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:14,660
You won't take it.

735
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,610
Take it.

736
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:30,010
What's she doing?

737
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,630
Laxmi's saying she
won't take this necklace.

738
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,580
- You can keep it.
- No.

739
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,440
Not once, twice, or a hundred times.

740
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,550
Take it.

741
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,460
- Open it.
- No, no, no.

742
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,030
Let go.

743
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,720
No need to fight.

744
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,360
Look, this necklace
belongs to someone.

745
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:58,880
Keep it somewhere safe.

746
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,150
Then, I'll keep it at the bank.

747
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,920
Listen.

748
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,900
If anyone asks about the necklace,
just deny having it.

749
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,880
- Okay.
- Yes.

750
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,960
Wait.

751
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,190
Tea's waiting,

752
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,930
Come.

753
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,560
Oh, look what I did.

754
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:40,140
- It's okay, the cup's over brimmed.
- No.

755
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,540
I'm brimming with joy.

756
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,290
- I want to sing today,
- Sing.

757
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,700
And you'll say No, no, no.

758
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:54,760
No. I'll certainly
hear you sing today.

759
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,450
Come on.

760
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,860
One.

761
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,090
Two.

762
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,030
Tick-tock...

763
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,240
- Hey!
- What?

764
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
Not this song.

765
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,460
Lachcho!

766
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,500
Hello.

767
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,480
Have you seen my Lachcho?

768
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,780
Who do you think I am?

769
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,620
Always looking for Lachcho.

770
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,270
You're such a grownup man.

771
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,920
But you can't take
care of a little woman.

772
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,570
She ran away with someone.

773
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,280
Who did she run away with?

774
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,700
What should I do if she did?

775
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,750
Get out.

776
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,700
- I forgot to say thank you.
- Get lost.

777
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:44,080
I am harassed.

778
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,450
Where's Roopa?

779
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,160
- Did she run away with someone?
- Yes.

780
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,850
She must have gone to see
that engineer at the hotel.

781
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,800
Get that.

782
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,260
I'm being fooled.

783
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,480
Your love has spoilt her.

784
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,620
I've been waiting
for her since morning.

785
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,890
- Get that.
- I see.

786
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:10,910
Lachcho.

787
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,530
Don't talk about separating.

788
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,120
- I've a delicate heart.
- I see.

789
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,760
No, just say yes.

790
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:24,280
My beautiful darling. Just say yes.

791
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,020
Lachchi. Where's Roopa?

792
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,400
What are you doing?

793
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,960
Where's Roopa?

794
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,680
You dwell in my heart.

795
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,150
Come in my dreams.

796
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:00,950
I miss you every day

797
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:12,140
Just like the flute echoes
by the side of the river

798
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,340
You're always in my thoughts.

799
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,920
You steal my heart.

800
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:36,170
You cause an upheaval in my heart.

801
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,820
You dwell in my heart.

802
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,430
Come in my dreams.

803
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:15,570
You're the only one I am living for

804
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:30,140
Just like the moon in the sky

805
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:40,459
You dwell in my eyes.

806
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:43,040
Steal my senses.

807
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:45,749
You dwell in my eyes.

808
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:48,219
Steal my senses.

809
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:56,080
You cause an upheaval in my heart.

810
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,760
You dwell in my heart.

811
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,340
Come in my dreams.

812
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:09,410
You cause an upheaval in my heart.

813
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,630
Grandpa, I'm really happy today.

814
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,100
He'll be coming tonight.

815
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,210
I will sing for him.

816
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,210
I will dance for him.

817
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:25,000
I'll go crazy for him, grandpa.

818
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:27,839
Dear, my happiness lies with yours.

819
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,500
My dear grandpa, you are so good.

820
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,280
I saw a beautiful dream today.

821
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:36,160
I heard my beloved's
voice resonate in my ears.

822
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,590
Bless me.

823
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,750
So that I can make him mine.

824
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,830
- Who'll take her?
- You're asking that.

825
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:50,049
- Go, Lachchi's in that room.
- Thank you.

826
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,090
What are you doing?

827
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,870
What did you do, Lachchi?

828
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,140
You shattered my dream.

829
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,560
You don't know, the
world I had created.

830
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:26,610
It was just him in it.

831
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,570
- We were talking about love.
- Then?

832
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:33,950
He touched my soul.

833
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,630
My heart was filled with desires...

834
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,580
and I could hear the tune of love.

835
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:41,650
He came forward to
take me in his arms..

836
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,080
And you woke me up.

837
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:44,390
It's too late.

838
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,310
- Get some sleep.
- No.

839
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,890
If I sleep he will go away.

840
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,150
I will keep my eyes open.

841
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,930
He'll hide, and I'll find him.

842
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,380
I'll call out Beloved,
where are you.

843
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,220
Where are you beloved?

844
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:06,240
And he'll say, Here I am.

845
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,420
Then, he'll come out of hiding.

846
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,240
And I will take him in my arms.

847
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,390
And say...

848
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:12,960
Don't torment me.

849
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,410
O beloved, don't leave now.

850
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,520
Don't leave me.

851
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,880
Don't torment me.

852
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,910
O beloved, don't leave now.

853
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,990
Don't leave me.

854
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,800
For the sake of this heart.

855
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,410
Don't leave after
torturing my heart.

856
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,160
O beloved, don't leave now.

857
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:02,120
You've given my heart a sweet pain.

858
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,030
My heart's at your feet.

859
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,820
Don't forsake it and leave.

860
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:13,250
O beloved, don't leave now.

861
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:15,960
Don't torment me.

862
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,640
O beloved, don't leave now.

863
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,350
For the sake of this heart.

864
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:24,130
Don't leave after
torturing my heart.

865
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,190
O beloved, don't leave now.

866
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:56,400
Your style was a treat to my eyes.

867
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:02,130
Now they say, don't
leave after tormenting them.

868
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,460
O beloved, don't leave now.

869
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,240
Don't torment me.

870
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,850
O beloved, don't leave now.

871
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,670
For the sake of this heart.

872
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,330
Don't leave after
torturing my heart.

873
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:25,130
O beloved, don't leave now.

874
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:40,730
Limbo.

875
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,160
Zimbo.

876
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,580
Abracadabra, hocus-pocus.

877
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,060
Limbo.

878
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:00,560
Zimbo.

879
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,110
Move aside, we're the
enchanting beauties.

880
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:09,380
We steal hearts with our eyes.

881
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:29,050
My gait creates an
uproar in the city.

882
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,230
Men stare at me like wildcats.

883
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,700
Like wildcats.

884
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,786
Lachcho.

885
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:42,100
I'm completely ruined,
and have become useless.

886
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:50,540
Beware, you've locked horns with us.

887
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:59,290
Lachcho. I'll treat
you to hot snacks.

888
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:14,550
We steal hearts with our eyes.

889
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:18,900
Move aside, we're the
enchanting beauties.

890
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:23,360
We steal hearts with our eyes.

891
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:41,270
The world's at my feet.

892
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,850
Some say, my eyes
pierce their heart.

893
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,650
Some say, I can count the
stars all night waiting for you.

894
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,380
Mister, you seem in trouble.

895
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:08,580
But my beloved doesn't talk to me.

896
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,350
Even the moon's crazy for us.

897
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:25,810
We steal hearts with your eyes.

898
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,990
Move aside, we're the
enchanting beauties.

899
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:35,070
We steal hearts with your eyes.

900
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:47,480
This is the place we want to beautify.

901
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,470
Across this river.

902
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,840
Between the green trees...

903
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:56,010
we will build a beautiful township.

904
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,400
And, it'll be covered by a
beautiful mountain range.

905
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,570
That's all you people ever think of.

906
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:07,520
Mr. Engineer.

907
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,820
- We'll have boats here as well.
- Yes, Roopa.

908
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,680
And, lovers riding these boats...

909
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:16,440
will float away far and wide,
lost in their world.

910
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,760
To the place, from
where they can't return.

911
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,180
Look, Roopa.

912
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,460
The clouds here.

913
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:26,900
It'll rain soon.

914
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,480
Let's go.

915
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,730
The car's stuck.

916
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:55,610
You'll get drenched.

917
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,460
You're drenched too.

918
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,410
You look take such great care of me.

919
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:01,170
I'll help you.

920
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:08,210
This car won't budge.

921
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,290
Look. There's a hut.

922
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:12,620
- Let's go there.
- Let's go.

923
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,240
Come in, mister.

924
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,930
You're completely drenched.

925
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,090
- It's raining so heavily.
- Right.

926
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,260
And my car's stuck too.

927
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:44,180
Take a seat, I'll get
some clothes for you.

928
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,920
No, I'll manage everything.

929
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,690
No need to take the trouble.

930
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,740
Roopa hasn't returned yet.

931
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,940
You don't stop her either.

932
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,700
Why would you?

933
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:13,050
Because you've raised
her with great love...

934
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:15,110
She's being spoilt.

935
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,160
What are you saying, professor.

936
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:19,900
Don't you know Roopa's my daughter?

937
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,720
If she was your daughter...

938
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,590
she wouldn't be roaming so freely.

939
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,930
If you can't stop her, then I will.

940
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,700
I will go talk to that engineer.

941
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:29,960
Lachcho.

942
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,710
If you say Lachcho again, I'll...

943
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,690
Hello.

944
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,530
- Have you see Lachcho?
- Again.

945
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:38,720
I'll slap you silly.

946
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:39,990
Get out you big mug.

947
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:41,370
Get out.

948
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,130
I am in love with someone.

949
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,130
You're in love?

950
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,520
These clothes look nice.

951
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:15,060
- You're looking nice.
- You mean me.

952
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,660
- Listen.
- Yes.

953
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,320
- I'm hungry.
- Hungry.

954
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,530
I am hungry too.

955
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:24,100
So?

956
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,640
- So?
- Cook some food.

957
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,740
Cook? Me?

958
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,890
Okay. I will for you.

959
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,050
- One more.
- Here.

960
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:53,350
Wow. The food's tasty.

961
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,750
I didn't know you could cook so well.

962
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:02,320
Daughter-in-law's
cooked such tasty food.

963
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:03,960
Daughter-in-law?

964
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:07,260
God's blessed you with
such a talented wife.

965
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:09,480
- Wife?
- Yes.

966
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,370
Though she's educated...

967
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,690
she's so good with
the household chores.

968
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:19,020
Why are you staring at me?

969
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,390
Why, can't I look?

970
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,780
- Here.
- I ate too much.

971
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:24,940
You haven't eaten anything.

972
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,826
The radish is uneaten, so are
the tomatoes, and the lentils.

973
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,060
Eat it.

974
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:30,050
Fine, I'll eat some more.

975
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:47,340
Roopa. I didn't know
you were so talented.

976
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:51,690
Till now, I thought
you're only an artist.

977
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:57,670
But now, I realize
you're very talented.

978
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:02,090
- I will never forget this day.
- Yes, Roopa.

979
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,460
I will remember this day too.

980
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,020
- Uncle.
- Yes, daughter-in-law.

981
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,160
What's the cradle doing here?

982
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:27,350
I had a young daughter.

983
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,170
Now, all I have are her memories.

984
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:34,140
- What happened to your daughter?
- Don't ask.

985
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,080
This is her shoe.

986
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:44,130
I hope she stays happy.

987
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:52,470
Roopa. It's stopped raining.

988
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,070
We should leave.

989
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,090
- Get ready.
- Okay.

990
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:32,300
We've sworn on love.

991
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,600
We'll never separate.

992
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,780
We've sworn on love.

993
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:05,390
We will keep our promises.

994
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,300
We'll make our own world.

995
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,080
We'll sing the song of love.

996
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:22,990
We'll sing...

997
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:27,180
We'll sing the song of love.

998
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:30,660
Our love will keep growing.

999
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:43,080
We'll never separate.

1000
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:51,660
We've sworn on love.

1001
01:30:52,610 --> 01:31:00,610
The world might trouble us.

1002
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:08,880
They might try to instigate.

1003
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:16,960
But, we'll live together always.

1004
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:24,850
We'll always be holding hands.

1005
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:28,930
We'll sing the song of love.

1006
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,910
We'll sing...

1007
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,980
We'll sing the song of love.

1008
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:42,910
Our love will keep growing.

1009
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:50,600
We'll never separate.

1010
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:59,580
We've sworn on love.

1011
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:14,960
He said yes.

1012
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,490
My life's changed.

1013
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:18,090
It was raining heavily.

1014
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,480
We took shelter in a hut.

1015
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:20,870
I cooked food for him.

1016
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,480
I fed him.

1017
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,000
He's coming tomorrow.

1018
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:30,480
Oh, yes.

1019
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,830
There was a cradle there.

1020
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,920
And it had this shoe. Take a look.

1021
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,660
This shoe belongs to my Nanhi.

1022
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,980
Where did you find it?

1023
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,650
Who lives there?

1024
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,450
Mr. Engineer.

1025
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,970
- Mr. Engineer.
- Yes.

1026
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:54,160
Telegram for you.

1027
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:58,230
I was awake to give this to you.

1028
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:02,410
Is everything fine?

1029
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:04,910
I've to leave for
the station right now.

1030
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:06,580
What time does the train leave?

1031
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:09,850
- Train for Delhi 45:12.
- You mean 12:45.

1032
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,950
And the train for Mumbai, 15...

1033
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:14,000
- Minutes. And hours?
- 12.

1034
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:16,680
And right now, it's 5:12.

1035
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:18,436
- That means, just 10 minutes for the train to leave.
- Yes.

1036
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,020
- Then, I am leaving.
- When will you return? - As soon as I can.

1037
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:24,120
- But, where are you going?
- Mumbai.

1038
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:25,720
Mumbai.

1039
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:32,190
Yes.

1040
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:36,440
- Do you see the professor there?
- Yes.

1041
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,700
I think he's here to see you.

1042
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:43,710
- If he asks you for anything, don't say no.
- Yes.

1043
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,180
- Manager.
- Yes.

1044
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:03,370
- Yes.
- Where's the Engineer?

1045
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,226
- He just went to the station.
- Station? - Yes.

1046
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:06,570
Which room do you want?

1047
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,330
- Single or double?
- I want a taxi.

1048
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:10,330
I can't get you a taxi now.

1049
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:13,600
If you can't get me a taxi, who can?

1050
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,160
Fine, come on.

1051
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:33,010
Lachchi. He's coming tomorrow,

1052
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:37,110
- Who?
- Him. The one that dwells in my heartbeats.

1053
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:39,540
The one I used to
play hide and seek with.

1054
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:42,430
The one that filled my life
with love. He's coming tomorrow.

1055
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:44,110
He's not coming.

1056
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:46,790
He betrayed us all.

1057
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,860
He was bound to leave, but
he took my necklace too.

1058
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,330
If the train hadn't left...

1059
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:56,800
I would've taught him a good lesson.

1060
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,200
Are you listening?

1061
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:02,900
The one you loved has left.

1062
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,700
No, no. That's not it.

1063
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:08,670
He cannot deceive anyone.

1064
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:11,110
You can sit and chant his name.

1065
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,200
- He ran away.
- Why will he?

1066
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,470
He's no thief.

1067
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:18,060
That's what I am here to ask.

1068
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,350
Why did the engineer
leave so suddenly?

1069
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,560
Did he leave me?

1070
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:26,650
But he said he's coming tomorrow.

1071
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:30,240
- So, why did he leave?
- Even I want to know.

1072
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:31,770
Why did the engineer leave?

1073
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,070
And, why did the
professor wanted to see him?

1074
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:36,330
I don't know.

1075
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:38,490
I've lost everything.

1076
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,500
Professor.

1077
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,180
Where?

1078
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:52,750
What happened then?

1079
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:55,850
One day she left Nanhi and left?

1080
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,990
While dying she said...

1081
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:04,930
that he misunderstood me,
that he misjudged me.

1082
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:11,120
Wonder what grief was
eating her from inside.

1083
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:16,690
She held herself responsible
for all the sins and died.

1084
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,500
And Nanhi, what about her?

1085
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:23,540
Nanhi. She fell prey
to my helplessness.

1086
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:27,930
Poverty is a big sin.

1087
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:33,120
I handed him over to a
man who could raise her.

1088
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,510
Can you recognize that man?

1089
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:37,390
Of course I will.

1090
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:41,040
My eyes are waiting
to see her as well.

1091
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,410
She must be a grown up now.

1092
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:51,000
- Roopa.
- Call her back.

1093
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,890
All I asked him was my love.

1094
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:57,050
Why was my world ruined
before I could get happiness?

1095
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,550
Go, call him.

1096
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:03,030
And tell him I
cannot live without him.

1097
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:11,770
He can go away from me,
but not my heart.

1098
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:29,990
In life, we get happiness and sorrows.

1099
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,880
Those who help you in happiness...

1100
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,250
desert you in your sorrows.

1101
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:38,000
Get up, dear. Get up.

1102
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:41,090
And forget your
sorrows with your music.

1103
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,990
How can I grandpa?

1104
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,830
I don't feel like singing now.

1105
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,290
That's a lie.

1106
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:13,140
You ask me, beloved, how I am.

1107
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:17,490
And, you called this
restless soul your relief.

1108
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:21,560
He's sent you a telegram.

1109
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:27,930
He says, I can't
come because I am busy.

1110
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:32,030
You're in great pain.

1111
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:40,450
He's trying to fool us.

1112
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:44,200
He's trying to deceive
us by sending telegrams.

1113
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:47,410
He says, I apologize.

1114
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:49,520
That's the limit to betrayal.

1115
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:52,380
Master. Prepare to leave.

1116
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:54,720
His engineer won't come.

1117
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,800
The company's falling apart.

1118
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:59,820
Who asked her to
fall in love with him?

1119
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,290
Now do you see the consequences?

1120
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:12,660
- So, dear?
- I can't sing.

1121
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,960
I can't dance.

1122
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,750
I am heart broken.

1123
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:23,410
Dear, music is our life.

1124
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:27,590
And it cannot be
separated from us. Dear.

1125
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:40,850
I stopped thinking about my beloved.

1126
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:49,860
But, I couldn't hide my pain.

1127
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:56,920
You forgot me.

1128
01:39:57,070 --> 01:40:03,090
But I couldn't forget his memories.

1129
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:10,450
My heart was shattered,
it was destiny.

1130
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:18,350
Why curse my fate.

1131
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:44,750
I wasn't destined to any relief.

1132
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:52,550
Why curse my fate.

1133
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:08,870
If it's difficult to see my beloved.

1134
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:23,760
Why would I desire you?

1135
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:34,030
If I wasn't worthy of love.

1136
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:41,640
Why would I claim of being in love?

1137
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:47,000
My heart was shattered,
it was destiny.

1138
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:57,900
The heart's stop being restless.

1139
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:12,230
The eyes have stopped crying.

1140
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,250
I've become a laughing stock.

1141
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:29,790
So, how could I display my love.

1142
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:35,390
My heart was shattered,
it was destiny.

1143
01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:44,890
It couldn't get a moment of peace.

1144
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:49,870
And, couldn't convey its love.

1145
01:42:54,990 --> 01:43:00,110
And couldn't dwell in my eyes.

1146
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:07,720
What would I do with
this ocean of love?

1147
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:12,720
My heart was shattered,
it was destiny.

1148
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:20,450
Why curse my fate.

1149
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:25,910
My heart was shattered,
it was destiny.

1150
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:35,440
Nanhi's mother would suffer similarly.

1151
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:41,810
16 years ago, she
would call out similarly.

1152
01:43:42,410 --> 01:43:46,270
Call him back.

1153
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,960
But... but, you didn't go anywhere,
to come back.

1154
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:57,820
You were drunk.

1155
01:43:58,520 --> 01:43:59,910
Quiet!

1156
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:05,960
Those who immerse
their life in alcohol...

1157
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:08,050
never get out of it.

1158
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:15,290
She would cry seeing you.

1159
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,480
She tried stopping you.

1160
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,060
But you didn't listen.

1161
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:26,560
And, your habit won.

1162
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:31,500
Your wife's leaving the house...

1163
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,320
with your daughter.

1164
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,580
Stop her.

1165
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,000
Lachcho. Come here.

1166
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,780
Telegram for you.

1167
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:54,500
Can you read it?

1168
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:56,590
Do you want me to read it?

1169
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,640
Sit down.

1170
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:09,380
Don't you want to hear?

1171
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:14,050
He writes. I love you.

1172
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:19,400
I've surrendered everything to you.

1173
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,750
What are you looking at?

1174
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:26,850
- From where?
- Don't try to pretend.

1175
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,240
Your one and only, Ratan.

1176
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:33,110
He wants to meet you.

1177
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,720
Do you know where?

1178
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:38,540
Far away from the city, alone.

1179
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:42,160
But listen, don't tell Roopa about it.

1180
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,430
Otherwise, she will eat you alive.

1181
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:48,700
How fortunate you are?

1182
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:55,970
She's the one in grief,
and you're having fun.

1183
01:45:58,270 --> 01:45:59,560
Listen.

1184
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:03,210
Don't let your husband know.

1185
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:06,550
Or else he'll create a scene.

1186
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,950
Why did he call me?

1187
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:33,060
Was his love for Roopa fake.

1188
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,930
I can't see Roopa in pain.

1189
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,610
Bhola.

1190
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:49,300
He has called.

1191
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:50,700
Me.

1192
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:53,410
Dear.

1193
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,540
Roopa.

1194
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:59,360
Won't you talk to your grandpa?

1195
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:02,660
You look lost.

1196
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:08,050
You've forgotten to smile as well.

1197
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,940
He's the one.

1198
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:20,450
I had handed over
Nanhi to him 16 years ago.

1199
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:23,370
Is Roopa my Nanhi?

1200
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:27,600
- Yes, sir.
- My Nanhi.

1201
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:43,830
Lachcho.

1202
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:48,210
You know, Roopa's Nanhi.

1203
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,320
But, Roopa's no longer herself.

1204
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:55,130
Love has made her sad.

1205
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:59,030
If she asks about her mother,
what will you say?

1206
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:01,470
I will call Babu.

1207
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,630
Here's a telegram for you.

1208
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,900
Lachcho!

1209
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:17,850
Have you seen Lachcho?

1210
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:19,830
- You mean Lachchi.
- Yes, Lachchi.

1211
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:21,440
Wonder where she is.

1212
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:23,460
I looked everywhere. Even her room.

1213
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:25,370
- I wonder where she is.
- Your Lachchi...

1214
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,590
Yes, Lachchi. Where is she?

1215
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:29,120
Tell me.

1216
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:31,800
Lachcho.

1217
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:33,750
- Grandpa.
- Yes.

1218
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:37,650
- There's a telegram.
- Telegram?

1219
01:48:37,730 --> 01:48:40,820
The engineer's sent it for Lachchi.

1220
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:43,040
Roopa.

1221
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,820
There's a telegram.

1222
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,480
No need to read it.

1223
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:53,090
I know what's written.

1224
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:57,450
The telegram's for Lachchi, not you.

1225
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:02,220
Engineer's called Lachchi to meet him.

1226
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:03,640
Lachchi?

1227
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,380
Yes, Roopa.

1228
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,800
My dear.

1229
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:24,090
There's another telegram.

1230
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:29,290
He says, I am stuck with some
important work and can't come.

1231
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:33,860
And, tell Lachcho not to
leave until I don't come.

1232
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:35,080
Goodbye.

1233
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:38,780
If you leave he'll get angry.

1234
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:43,200
I actually came here to say...

1235
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:45,810
that I cannot see
Roopa crying any more.

1236
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:49,910
Now that you're here,
then do meet him.

1237
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:51,480
Lachcho.

1238
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,970
What are you staring at?

1239
01:49:57,050 --> 01:50:00,720
I'm right behind you,
like your shadow.

1240
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:14,610
Leave me.

1241
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:21,640
- Leave me.
- I'll make you the heroine.

1242
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,800
Leave me.

1243
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:04,600
- Scoundrel
- Lachcho.

1244
01:51:07,290 --> 01:51:08,840
Lachcho.

1245
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,240
Roopa!

1246
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,890
Bhola. Bhola.

1247
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:18,980
Move aside. Get lost.

1248
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,270
- Where is he?
- He's...

1249
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:22,450
How dare you?

1250
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:24,190
You betray your own benefactor.

1251
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:28,340
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Good Nanhi...

1252
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,680
You are a good Nanhi.

1253
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:35,820
You misunderstand her.

1254
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:38,250
You can speak.

1255
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,230
Yes.

1256
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:46,960
16 years ago, I lost my voice.

1257
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:51,780
Nanhi, I can speak today.

1258
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:58,150
Lachcho had come here to say...

1259
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:01,500
that she cannot
bear to see your tears.

1260
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:08,320
Inspector, the necklace
you're looking for is with Ratan.

1261
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:10,330
- Where's Ratan?
- In Mumbai.

1262
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,060
I know where he lives.

1263
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:15,860
Remember, he's
instigated my troupe against me.

1264
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:18,780
If they accuse me of anything,
don't believe it.

1265
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:22,010
- Come with me. Come.
- I'll come along.

1266
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:44,670
- Is this the place, professor?
- Yes, this is it.

1267
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:46,470
Look, there's she's going up.

1268
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,690
And yes, look there.

1269
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:50,400
Grandpa and the
Diwan's sitting in the car.

1270
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,470
They're trying to trap me.

1271
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:58,000
But, I want you to handcuff Ratan.

1272
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:01,060
Keep watching, what happens next.

1273
01:53:01,450 --> 01:53:02,870
He'll be handcuffed...

1274
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:05,580
but he'll also
have to rot in jail.

1275
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,440
Come. Sit.

1276
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,430
Please sit.

1277
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:00,000
- Shall I call my mom?
- Mom? No.

1278
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:03,120
- Are you her daughter?
- Yes.

1279
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:05,770
My name's Sulekha.

1280
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:15,170
- Where's Ratan?
- He's gone to the office.

1281
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:17,070
I'll be right back.

1282
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:49,220
Now I know what stopped
him from coming to me.

1283
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:57,410
Mother asked you to sit.

1284
01:54:57,580 --> 01:55:00,700
No, I cannot wait any longer.

1285
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:02,580
I am heart broken.

1286
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:04,990
Let me go.

1287
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:07,590
You don't know, Sulekha.

1288
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:10,200
My heart's broken.

1289
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:19,280
- Sulekha.
- Coming, mother.

1290
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:29,140
Roopa. What are you doing here?

1291
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:31,040
I was about to write to you.

1292
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,470
I received all your letters.

1293
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:34,420
With the same excuse, same story.

1294
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:35,630
What are you saying, Roopa?

1295
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:37,480
Why did you deceive me?

1296
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,620
You could've said
that you can't marry me.

1297
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:42,520
Why did you play with my feelings?

1298
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:46,040
Why did you say I'll go
talk to grandpa tomorrow?

1299
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:50,120
But, that tomorrow never came.

1300
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:51,580
What are you saying Roopa?

1301
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:54,150
- I...
- Your love was fake.

1302
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:55,880
It was deceit.

1303
01:55:57,010 --> 01:55:59,710
Roopa. What are you saying?

1304
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:02,330
I think you're misunderstood.

1305
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:04,510
I saw everything myself.

1306
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:08,100
If I wasn't concerned about Sulekha,
I would've shown you.

1307
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:11,710
But I cannot hurt that little girl.

1308
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:16,310
I cannot tell her that
you are such a deceiver...

1309
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:18,500
that you can ruin someone's life.

1310
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:20,720
You... you...

1311
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,960
Sulekha, don't get me wrong.

1312
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:34,250
He didn't deceive anyone.

1313
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,970
He's very nice.

1314
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:38,160
He's very nice, Sulekha.

1315
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,850
Listen, Roopa.

1316
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:52,670
Take your safekeeping.

1317
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:54,620
Mine?

1318
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:57,050
I've already lost that.

1319
01:56:57,550 --> 01:56:59,980
I will try to forget you.

1320
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:04,180
And, I'll try not to dream about you.

1321
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:06,310
I've your necklace.

1322
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:09,750
I didn't come here for the necklace.

1323
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:11,620
That's stolen.

1324
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:14,140
That's not my necklace, it was stolen.

1325
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:15,870
- Stolen?
- Honestly.

1326
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:17,440
This necklace was stolen.

1327
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:18,760
- Stolen?
- Yes.

1328
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,290
Did you hear, lnspector?

1329
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,250
That necklace was stolen.
It is with the engineer.

1330
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:25,680
Okay, I'll take your
leave now. Goodbye.

1331
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:28,470
Professor, wait.

1332
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:30,410
Yes, here's the necklace.

1333
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:32,990
Inspector, there's your culprit.

1334
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:35,770
You deal with him. I am going.

1335
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:39,290
Where are you going?
We need you, professor.

1336
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:43,470
Govind. Arrest the engineer.

1337
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:45,480
You are under arrest.

1338
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:48,360
No, inspector. The
engineer is not a thief.

1339
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:49,830
He didn't steal the necklace.

1340
01:57:49,900 --> 01:57:51,780
- The professor is the thief.
- Roopa!

1341
01:57:51,850 --> 01:57:54,320
I am telling the truth.
He's the thief.

1342
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,980
- That's a lie.
- It's true.

1343
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:58,080
It's a lie.

1344
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:00,890
Yes, it's a lie.

1345
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:04,650
Sheila.

1346
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:06,970
That necklace
belongs to me, inspector.

1347
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:09,110
It belongs to me.

1348
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,910
And, he took it.

1349
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:18,770
And, I reported the theft to find him.

1350
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,950
He wasted all our wealth and jewelry...

1351
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:25,980
in gambling and his drama company.

1352
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:33,010
Sheila.

1353
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:35,540
Let him go, inspector.

1354
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:38,850
I cannot see him getting arrested.

1355
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:42,390
I cannot leave him on your request.

1356
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:46,640
He's committed a theft
and now he's a culprit.

1357
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:51,620
Theft. What theft? Stole what?

1358
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:55,180
The necklace belongs to him.

1359
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:58,470
He's my husband.

1360
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,610
Sheila.

1361
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,710
Ratan brother.

1362
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:09,610
He's the one I
married against your will.

1363
01:59:09,990 --> 01:59:13,110
And, the one you refused to accept.

1364
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:16,140
And then, we never met.

1365
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:20,810
Professor, she
could've sent you behind bars.

1366
01:59:21,510 --> 01:59:27,590
But, her honor stops
her from doing that.

1367
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:33,340
And, because of this woman,
I'll have to let you go.

1368
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:35,980
Sheila.

1369
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:39,560
I am embarrassed.

1370
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:43,420
I cannot hold the burden
of my crimes any longer.

1371
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:46,410
I tormented you.

1372
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,790
But, now I have realized.

1373
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:57,550
A woman has the strength to
tackle the biggest problems...

1374
01:59:58,530 --> 02:00:01,300
and bring happiness to her family.

1375
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:04,470
I promise...

1376
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:09,520
I will try to be a honest man.

1377
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:12,260
Mom.

1378
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:13,620
Yes.

1379
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:17,210
Our daughter.

1380
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:18,700
Sulekha,

1381
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:21,000
My daughter.

1382
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:23,020
- My child.
- Professor...

1383
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:24,830
How old are you?

1384
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,530
- Seven years old.
- Seven years?

1385
02:00:26,610 --> 02:00:29,910
My child's seven years old.

1386
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,860
I'll make you the
queen of my theater...

1387
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,110
Forget the theater.

1388
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:36,300
I will make you the queen of the city.

1389
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:43,990
Listen. I misunderstood you.

1390
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,950
- Sister...
- My name's Roopa.

1391
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:51,720
- Brother.
- Sheila, she's Roopa.

1392
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:54,040
I used to talk about her every day.

1393
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,530
You. So you're Roopa.

1394
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:59,330
He used to tell me about you everyday.

1395
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:03,900
Brother used to say Let me go,
Roopa must be waiting.

1396
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:06,330
But I couldn't let brother go.

1397
02:01:06,410 --> 02:01:09,360
My brother couldn't
reach you only because of me.

1398
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:12,350
Now he is yours,
Roopa, and you are his.

1399
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,680
Now, you're my sister-in-law.

1400
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,250
Loving sister-in-law.

1401
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:18,370
Smile now.

1402
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:25,880
Are you still angry?

1403
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:30,240
Bhola. Grandpa.

1404
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:31,900
She's my Nanhi.

1405
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:35,040
Now, she's found her Ratan as well.

1406
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:39,630
Dear, ask your mother to forgive me.

1407
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:45,650
Tell your father
never to leave us again.

1408
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:52,020
Sulekha, tell your mother I
will never leave her again.

1409
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:55,730
I've finally found
light in this dark life.

1410
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:58,410
I will never leave her again.

1411
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:03,460
- Promise.
- I promise in Sulekha's presence.

1412
02:02:03,570 --> 02:02:05,160
Lachcho!

1413
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,790
Hello. Hello.

1414
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:12,470
You must have understood.
That is Lachcho...

1415
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:16,580
Your Lachcho's selling
sweetmeats at the confectioner's shop.

1416
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:19,090
Get it. Don't trouble me again.

1417
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:20,820
Go on. Get going.

1418
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:25,450
Forgive me, I forgot to thank you.

1419
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,710
- Thank you.
- You're too adamant.

1420
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:30,380
- Get going.
- Okay.

1421
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:39,090
- Yes.
- What?

1422
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,910
Yes, I...

1423
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:44,070
Yes, I abused you a lot.

1424
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:45,800
- You are angry.
- Angry?

1425
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:48,240
I mean to say, are you angry?

1426
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:49,840
Not at all.

1427
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:51,440
- Then?
- Not at all. - So...

1428
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,760
Engineer.

1429
02:02:52,870 --> 02:02:54,710
Congratulations.

1430
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:57,360
When are you two getting married?

1431
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:58,990
Don't forget to invite me.

1432
02:02:59,070 --> 02:03:00,280
- Yes.
- Of course.

1433
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:02,260
The inspector's asking something.

1434
02:03:02,370 --> 02:03:04,520
- Yes.
- What yes? Say something.

1435
02:03:04,630 --> 02:03:06,710
- I am ready.
- Today?

1436
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:08,030
- Now.
- Now?

1437
02:03:08,150 --> 02:03:10,850
- Right now.
- Right now. Get lost.

1438
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,030
We'll sing the song of love.

1439
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:16,910
We'll sing...

1440
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:21,050
We'll sing the song of love.

1441
02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:28,730
Our love will keep growing.

1442
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:36,730
We'll never separate.

1443
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:44,840
We've sworn on love.
