1
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,548
Now, you sing. You sing.

2
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,700
Come to me buddy.
Soon your face will be bloody.

3
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:30,040
I am gonna rip you apart
and stitch you back!

4
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,129
What?

5
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,514
Are you Indian?

6
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,722
Tamizhachi!

7
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:00,318
I like white guys.

8
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:02,183
I like Indian girls too.

9
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,532
But I have a doubt.

10
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,088
Why are Indian girls so dark?

11
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:09,038
I'll tell you that in your room.

12
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,380
Ok.

13
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:22,980
What?!

14
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:31,609
I sent her to woo you but instead
you woo me? You gay doofus!

15
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,318
Ruby, what's the status?

16
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,311
Target locked.

17
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:37,378
Agent Ruby.

18
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,235
You got the gun mafia terrorist.

19
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,605
We are very proud of you.

20
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,195
One minute.

21
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,501
So what did you ask me?

22
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,032
Why Tamizh girls are dark?

23
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:50,937
When you whites ruled us, we never
opened the doors when you knocked it.

24
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:52,999
That is why we are dark.

25
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:54,668
What?!

26
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:55,911
Son of David!

27
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:58,996
Hello?

28
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,290
Man in the custody about to die.

29
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:00,915
What?!

30
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,592
Situation is getting very worst!

31
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,136
We need you now.

32
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:05,271
I'll be there.

33
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,675
One guy in your custody and
you cannot keep him alive?

34
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:17,583
He is halfway
through testimony.

35
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:19,696
There is so much pressure
from the head office.

36
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,970
- Sorry.
- What do you mean?!

37
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:21,759
Play the video.

38
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:32,475
I am going to talk about a
secret that I had kept for long.

39
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:34,563
Everything happens for a reason.

40
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,263
Until this body lasts...

41
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,804
take away whatever you can.

42
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,154
My dad said the first time he saw him.

43
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,329
He said that he could
see a spark in Michael.

44
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,899
It all started from Madurai.

45
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,438
Michael.

46
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,962
Micheal is my best friend!

47
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,517
Michael is an orphan.

48
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,828
We grew up together.

49
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,475
We worked for Senthamarai.

50
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:06,106
Michael became
'Madurai' Michael.

51
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:07,423
Right now...

52
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:08,983
he is in prison.

53
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,255
Reason? Senthamarai!

54
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:16,908
In order to bring out Madurai, each and
every prisoner's family was paid well.

55
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:20,407
Usually people bribe the police
to bring out someone from prison.

56
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:26,616
But this time around, each and
every prisoner's got the money.

57
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:29,522
Because...

58
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,907
he and Selvi must
lead a life together.

59
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,413
That day!

60
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,782
The whole Madurai
city jail rumbled.

61
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:39,386
We accepted the money.

62
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,914
You didn't do anything for us...

63
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:43,303
at least do this because
our Madurai must come out!

64
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,312
Madurai must- somehow
come out of jail

65
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,207
Every prisoner's
family has been paid.

66
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,904
He must live his
life to the fullest.

67
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,607
We want our Madurai back.

68
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,051
And we trust you a lot.

69
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,388
Why are you getting emotional?

70
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,560
My sons, all 3 of
them are inside.

71
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,251
They will take care
of everything.

72
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,635
Madurai will be out tomorrow.

73
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,156
Isn't your brother
an officer here?

74
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,422
Ask him to help.

75
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:05,851
My brother, 'Motta'
Rajendran...

76
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,078
aka constable Mani...

77
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:08,198
is present here.

78
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:09,558
He will take care of everything.

79
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:17,776
Please have sir.

80
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:18,863
Thank you.

81
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,645
- Sir.
- Welcome.

82
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,170
Happy birthday sir.

83
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:23,669
Thank you.

84
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,813
Though you are my junior yet do you
know why I addressed you as 'Sir?'

85
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,300
You are honest and
incorruptible.

86
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:31,119
You are the most honest police
officer in the whole of Madurai.

87
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:31,843
Sir...

88
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,954
please don't praise
me like this.

89
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,909
How do you manage to stay
honest for such a long time?

90
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,636
The whole Tamizh Nadu
department must learn from you.

91
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,590
- Happy birthday Mani sir.
- Thanks sir.

92
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,299
- Have it. Have some more.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,198
Not for prisoners. Only
for police officers.

94
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:48,776
Please have it.

95
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:50,793
Is there regular supply of cigarettes?

96
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:51,296
Sir!

97
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:52,589
Greetings.

98
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,780
Please have it.

99
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,619
Mani, happy birthday.

100
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,413
Thank you.

101
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:01,040
What sweet did you give?
I feel dizzy.

102
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:02,688
It is a sweet called 'Halwa'

103
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,187
Madurai is on his way!

104
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,696
What's happening here? Look all
the prisoners are escaping!

105
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:21,667
What are you doing?

106
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,958
Sir, I don't know
anything about it.

107
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,774
We all were given this to eat.
Even I feel dizzy.

108
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:37,749
Madurai.

109
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,041
Madurai!

110
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,793
Is he still asleep?

111
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,387
How do I wake him up?

112
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,101
Let me sing a song.

113
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:49,857
I am little star. He
is the super star.

114
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,281
I appear to be a innocent boy but
in reality I am a mischievous boy!

115
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:55,404
Super boy! Super boy!

116
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,666
Madurai is awake!

117
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:59,607
Here, wear this and come out.

118
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:00,674
Come on.

119
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,087
Bring in the bricks!

120
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,394
Don't you worry Madurai.

121
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,300
All the prisoners are
under our control.

122
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:26,824
Next we shall abduct Selvi...

123
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:33,697
Prisoners!

124
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:36,719
Are you ready to work for
the received ransom?

125
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:38,691
It's time to raise hell!
Hell yeah!

126
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,302
This is awesome!

127
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:47,796
Madurai!

128
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,150
Superb!

129
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,455
Come on!

130
00:11:07,787 --> 00:11:10,913
Title: ANBANAVAN - ASARADHAVAN
- ADANGADHAVAN ( The Lovable

131
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,091
one - The uninfluenced one
- The Uncontrollable one)

132
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:28,019
Preceding the Muthumariamman
temple festival,

133
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,963
on behalf of Madurai
Tamizh Sangam...

134
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,337
whoever reaches the top
and gets the flag...

135
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,956
will be awarded 5000 bucks cash.

136
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:37,079
The competition has begun!

137
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:39,297
Get the flag! Climb!

138
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,673
The festival is underway...

139
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:43,592
and Michael isn't here yet.

140
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,952
Has he ever arrived on time?!

141
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,058
Look over there!

142
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:15,081
I am no one without
all your love.

143
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:18,911
You like the sky that
the earth needs.

144
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:21,434
I am no one without
all your love.

145
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,114
You like the sky that
the earth needs.

146
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:26,184
So my heart felt
thanks to you all.

147
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,313
I am no one without
all your love.

148
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,185
You are just like the
roots to a flower.

149
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,284
So I bow down to you all
and convey my thanks.

150
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,038
Quiet! Silence!

151
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,699
Why is Madurai here.

152
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,339
He is here to slay someone.

153
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:40,807
Wonder what's gonna happen?!

154
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,764
Until blood circulates in me;

155
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,680
you will run in my blood.

156
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,226
Until blood circulates in me;
you will run in my blood.

157
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,859
Our voice will be heard far
away, beyond the skies.

158
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:58,344
Until blood circulates in me;
you will run in my blood.

159
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:01,977
My whole life is not enough to
thank you all for the love shown.

160
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:05,269
My whole life is not enough.

161
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:48,395
Pain teaches us lessons;
it's good to endure it.

162
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,736
It makes you understand what
the world is all about.

163
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:55,649
And when danger struck,
you stood by me...

164
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:58,811
chasing away all my enemies.

165
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,317
No, thank you for the
posts and tags offered.

166
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,639
I am happy with the motivation
and applauds you give me.

167
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,453
All I need is your
mercy and support.

168
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:12,788
After all, you all
are my brothers.

169
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,188
You strength is my recognition.

170
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:19,904
You are the king to this king.

171
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:26,923
You are the friend who stood beside me
in happiness and sorrow. Yes you are!

172
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:30,691
Until blood circulates in me;
you will run in my blood.

173
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:34,528
Our voice will be heard far
away, beyond the skies.

174
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:37,956
Until blood circulates in me;
you will run in my blood.

175
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:41,560
My whole life is not enough to
thank you all for the love shown.

176
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,834
I am no one without
all your love.

177
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,713
You like the sky that
the earth needs.

178
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:51,823
So my heart felt
thanks to you all.

179
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,888
I am no one without
all your love.

180
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,854
You are just like the
roots to a flower.

181
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:58,951
So I bow down to you all
and convey my thanks.

182
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:01,043
When I fell down...

183
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:02,835
and lied low on the floor,

184
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:06,305
thanks to the millions of
hand that lend me a support.

185
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,176
I toppled upside down,

186
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:09,960
and I stood all by myself,

187
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,470
thank you for the support you
showed to this true Tamizhan.

188
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,464
This time the
festival is rocking.

189
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:21,617
Come on now.

190
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,006
Does it look like it's rocking?

191
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:23,975
Why? Is Madurai here?

192
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,458
The one who came first is
Madurai's best friend.

193
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:27,896
He is everything to him.

194
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,664
It was his family that
raised Madurai too.

195
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,185
Sabi, an islamic.

196
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,465
Next, is an elder fellow.

197
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:46,612
Whatever he does,
it makes you go...

198
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:48,717
I can't even say it out.

199
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:50,255
He is Kathiri Somu.

200
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:01,052
There are 3 types of people,

201
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,868
The loveable one -
who shows love.

202
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,212
The uninfluenced one.

203
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,643
And the uncontrollable one.

204
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:08,066
Have you ever see one person
with all these 3 qualities?

205
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,562
And that’s our Madurai

206
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,369
Dear Selvi.

207
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,675
Hey, here hold this weapon.

208
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:48,147
Bless me, oh my dear deity!

209
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:49,845
Oh dear deity!

210
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:52,902
You must safe guard
me, oh my deity.

211
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,018
Keep everyone happy,
oh dear deity.

212
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,977
Where is the fish?

213
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,472
Madurai is on his way.
We must finish him off!

214
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:12,120
Is he here?

215
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:13,264
Come on everybody!

216
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:17,969
It's time we moved on from these lints
and sickles. All you need is a gun.

217
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,176
Looks like that
will never happen.

218
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,814
I must go abroad to
experience that.

219
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:23,063
Welcome, how many pints?

220
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:24,795
Look how courageous he is!

221
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:26,806
One murder contract and
a large everyday...

222
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,990
what else do we need Somu?

223
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,342
He murdered a person
from our village and...

224
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,337
drink at our bar! Look
how daring is he!

225
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:34,506
We must finish him off!

226
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,333
Madurai!

227
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,574
You come to our village
every time, slay some and leave.

228
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,574
It's quite insulting for us!

229
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,899
We won't spare you this around.

230
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:42,700
Brother, the issue is between
you and Senthamarai.

231
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:44,559
I am just a worker who
works under him.

232
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:46,861
Let me know if you
don't like it...

233
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:47,820
and I shall leave.

234
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,658
Answer us before leaving.

235
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:50,731
Can't you see he
wants an answer.

236
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,433
Answer him.

237
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:54,188
Hey, that is what we are
here to research about.

238
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:56,676
If we spare you even
after you slayed our

239
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:59,079
village head, then no
one will respect us!

240
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:00,551
We shall explain
it to Senthamarai.

241
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:02,016
Senthamarai will agree with us.

242
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:02,634
Brother...

243
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,504
for whatever we did
we slit his throat.

244
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,845
You guys won't be slitting our
throats but something else.

245
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,921
Look Madurai, we belong to
the same caste and race.

246
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:11,044
Fortunately we are brothers.

247
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,526
Fine, no worries. You may go but
leave that silly fellow next to you.

248
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:15,630
We shall take care of
what happens further.

249
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,312
Brother,

250
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,803
this sounds very wrong.

251
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,770
If you don't like,
we shall leave.

252
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,071
Hey! Take out the weapon!

253
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,150
Take it out!

254
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:25,802
You got the tool?

255
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:27,683
I don't have it. It's with you.

256
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:28,885
Ok brother.

257
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,424
You want me to leave him right?

258
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:31,658
Tell me where do you
want me to leave him?

259
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:32,821
Leave him in that car.

260
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:33,499
Ok.

261
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,824
Go and sit in that car.

262
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:36,489
What?

263
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,511
Just go. Listen to me. Just go.

264
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:39,687
Just go!

265
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,459
He won't harm you.
I'll take care of it.

266
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,234
Hey buddies! Why are
you leaving me alone?

267
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:48,879
We'll manage. Just go!

268
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,327
Hey Madasamy....

269
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:52,711
last month a Bai
murdered our Kalimuthu.

270
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:54,656
Another Bai is trapped now.

271
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:56,273
It's a walk in the park for you.

272
00:20:56,415 --> 00:20:57,460
Go finish him off. Quick.

273
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:03,748
Madasamy...

274
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:14,956
Who is it inside the car?

275
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,331
The lord of death!

276
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:35,700
Didn't I ask you to leave?!

277
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:36,881
I said I was leaving...

278
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:38,346
because I didn't have the weapon.

279
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:39,076
And now?

280
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,616
Here is the weapon!

281
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,495
Where?

282
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,157
Awesome Madurai!

283
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,531
Everyone ran away.

284
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:02,776
I'll shall even give up my love,

285
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,298
but my best friend?

286
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,035
I will never ever give him up!

287
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:10,022
Superb!

288
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,309
Come on!

289
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:32,203
You wear this inner tops the whole day!
Doesn't it make you uncomfortable?

290
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:35,788
Back during our days,

291
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:38,302
we didn't even have
jackets to wear.

292
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:39,616
Now, give it to me.

293
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,612
Please remove and give it to me.

294
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:43,261
Grandma, I shall
take care of it.

295
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:45,993
Why are you always
bothered about this?

296
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:47,696
- I said give!
- Now, leave granny!

297
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,053
Just go!

298
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,590
Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu.
I know everything.

299
00:24:58,615 --> 00:25:00,809
But Madurai slang alone
is a bit difficult.

300
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:04,133
He is just carrying
a small bench.

301
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:08,263
I am made to carry
all the heavy chair!

302
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:22,729
Madurai...

303
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,191
what are you peeking at?

304
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:26,504
A dove that you would have
never seen in your life.

305
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,354
What? A dove?

306
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:30,508
Fair one or dark one?

307
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,497
No! This is green like a parrot.

308
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,148
Good to fry or make gravy?

309
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:43,332
I am so unlucky, I never
get such experience.

310
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:45,723
He always gets all
the lovey doveys.

311
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:46,434
Don't leave!

312
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:47,619
No one is responsible here!

313
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,020
The water is leaking over there.

314
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:49,956
Who will switch off the motor?

315
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:51,752
You and electricity
are incompatible.

316
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,089
Then who will switch
off the motor?

317
00:25:53,181 --> 00:25:54,635
What? Electricity?

318
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:55,722
Let me give it a shot.

319
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:57,608
- Don't go.
- The motor keeps running.

320
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,259
Why don't you obey me?!

321
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:02,442
Daddy!

322
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,145
Madurai! What was
that noise inside?

323
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,502
Not again dad!

324
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:09,381
Why do you repeat this?!

325
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:11,360
Why are you dancing here?

326
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:13,626
Oh! Are you electrocuted?

327
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:15,155
You!

328
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:16,551
Why did you hit my father?

329
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:19,085
If I didn't then your dad
would have passed away.

330
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:19,683
You!

331
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:20,427
Grandma!

332
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:22,642
He has been electrocuted and
that doesn't bother her.

333
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:27,149
Oh god! Save him! Why
can't you just obey me?

334
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,335
Can't you just stay put?

335
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,398
Oh! He is used to this?

336
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:31,249
Hello doctor,

337
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:32,309
Hello.

338
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:35,398
As usual, dad got electrocuted.

339
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:39,405
So as usual, did Mr. 'Shock'
Murugan play with the electricity?

340
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:40,192
Aren't you his daughter?

341
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:40,791
Yes doctor.

342
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:42,044
Hand the phone to your mother.

343
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,598
Mom is not here.

344
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:44,647
Only my grandma is here.

345
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:46,589
Not her. Poor lady.

346
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,434
Any gentleman nearby?

347
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:49,375
Yes doctor.

348
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:51,223
Michael, please speak
to the doctor.

349
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:52,408
Give it to me.

350
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:55,282
Tell me doctor! What should I do?
I am ready to help!

351
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,618
I can even sacrifice myself for Selvi.
Tell me doctor. What should I do?

352
00:26:57,643 --> 00:26:58,906
You don't have to
go to that extent.

353
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:00,165
Just give your mouth.

354
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:01,236
Mouth to mouth breathing.

355
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,282
Mouth to mouth?

356
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,883
Do the mouth to mouth
first aid and suck the

357
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:06,973
blockage out from the
respiratory pipe.

358
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,938
Doctor that will block
my respiration!

359
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,621
Do you own a pet dog?

360
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,494
Why do you ask?

361
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:14,245
I am even ready to do the mouth to
mouth first aid with that dog...

362
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,343
but I can't do it to
this stinky fellow!

363
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,433
Time is running out Madurai.
He might pass away.

364
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:21,181
Start the operation right away!
Start!

365
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:22,953
Michael...

366
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,042
- Please do what the doctor said.
- I would've, if it was for you.

367
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:29,307
Please save my dad.

368
00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:30,820
If I do as per
doctor's advice...

369
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,920
I'll be no more.

370
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:34,343
Now, watch me.

371
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,503
Why should I help you?

372
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:39,142
Right from childhood, you
have insulted me many times.

373
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:41,366
- Please don't mind it.
- Why would I mind it?

374
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:44,486
Save my dad and I shall
do anything you want.

375
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:45,894
Anything I want?

376
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:47,616
This is working out.

377
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:48,892
Will you love me?

378
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:49,819
Love you?

379
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,500
Promise me. Promise me!

380
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:52,659
What should I promise?

381
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,082
I am a virgin boy.

382
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:56,208
I'll kiss only a
virgin girl first!

383
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:57,666
Look at his mouth.

384
00:27:57,898 --> 00:27:59,493
Tell me if it's worthy
to be called so?

385
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,473
Make it fast!

386
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:01,989
He is digging his own grave.

387
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,885
But if he becomes my father
in law, then I don't mind.

388
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,529
I can't do it to
him as a stranger.

389
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:06,479
Promise me! Fast!

390
00:28:07,597 --> 00:28:08,285
Did you just promise?

391
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,529
I'll do anything you want.

392
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:10,922
Now, I'm caught!

393
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,769
Oh god! Please save him Michael!

394
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:14,802
Look at his mouth!

395
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:17,659
The current seems to be reverting
back through his mouth.

396
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,699
Oh my god!

397
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:28,474
Mom!

398
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:31,192
Mom, look at dad.

399
00:28:32,063 --> 00:28:35,267
I thought, if he had an affair,
it would've been with a woman.

400
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,283
He is having an affair with a man!
Crap!

401
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:38,294
You!

402
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,072
Thanks for saving me.

403
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:41,119
What happened?

404
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:42,153
Did you kiss me?

405
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,918
Damn you pervert!

406
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,069
- What happened?
- Madurai!

407
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:45,948
Oh! Oh! Madurai!

408
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,861
What happened?

409
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:47,860
Electrocuted!

410
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:49,350
He got electrocuted?

411
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,536
Madurai has fainted
from the shock...

412
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,639
and you guys are standing
there as a mute spectator?

413
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,758
Let me give him the mouth
to mouth first aid!

414
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,580
Stay away you mongrel!

415
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:00,556
What are you doing?

416
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,375
I was trying to save you.

417
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:06,185
If you had done it,
I would've died!

418
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,581
Is he your friend?

419
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:08,880
Like it matters a lot!

420
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:10,826
Selvi!

421
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:12,688
I hope you remember.

422
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,705
- I hope you remember the promise.
- I do.

423
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:16,527
Superb!

424
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:17,941
Come on!

425
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:24,927
With the blessings of
deity Mahamaye....

426
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,394
I've settled 1000s of disputes in 100s
of panchayat under similar banyan tree.

427
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,029
But...

428
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:34,318
I've never come across such
a worst and cheap issue.

429
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:37,119
Oh deity, what's my fault?

430
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,877
Why are you testing me?

431
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:40,235
Enough. Stop it.

432
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:44,066
For a month now, I thought it was my
husband who was stealing women's jacket.

433
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:46,116
He has stolen all the
women's jackets.

434
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:48,014
This yellow one is mine!

435
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:48,976
Here is your wife's jacket!

436
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,350
That green jacket is mine.

437
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,359
Until we get justice,
we women have decided

438
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,504
not to wear jacket
anymore in our village.

439
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,652
What? Come on guys, what?

440
00:29:56,786 --> 00:30:01,486
All over thieves steal money,
jewellery and other costly stuffs.

441
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,045
Why would you wanna
steal women's jackets?

442
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,510
My wife wished for
women's jacket.

443
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:09,167
But before I could buy
her, she expired.

444
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:13,224
If my wife cannot wear it then I
will allow no women to wear it.

445
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,524
Who is this doofus? Keeps
on chewing food like

446
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,636
cow even when there are
lot of issues here.

447
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:18,536
Shut up!

448
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,150
This is a tricky issue that
has come up in the Panchayat.

449
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,754
This must be dealt
with utmost care.

450
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,013
Can you postpone the final
judgment for 2 months?

451
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,446
That's very wrong Somu.

452
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:29,516
Indeed chief.

453
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:31,203
Let's each one of
us take a stone...

454
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:32,938
and pelt it on his head
and finish him off.

455
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:33,889
That's wrong!

456
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:35,608
Not with stone.

457
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:35,973
Then?

458
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,141
But with bricks!

459
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:38,282
Bricks!

460
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,205
Hit him!

461
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:41,587
Smother his face!

462
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,198
How dare you throw bricks at me.

463
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:45,535
I curse you all ! You all will
meet your end with bricks.

464
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:49,314
Don't throw at me! Oh my god!

465
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,648
Excuse me.

466
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,146
Soda.

467
00:30:58,632 --> 00:30:59,603
I didn't ask for it.

468
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:00,797
But he ordered it for you.

469
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:01,522
Who?

470
00:31:01,547 --> 00:31:02,248
Your fiance.

471
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:02,942
Fiance?

472
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:03,767
Indeed!

473
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:15,327
Leave!

474
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,178
You half bottle!

475
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:19,418
Did you start any new business?

476
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:20,259
Nope.

477
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:21,642
Who are you to send me drinks?

478
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:24,094
Selvi, you don't seem to
be living up to your word!

479
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,031
You don't seem to be in love.

480
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:27,011
Love?

481
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,823
Are you drunk so early?

482
00:31:29,956 --> 00:31:33,272
Yes, I'm high on love. Didn't you promise
to love me if I saved your dad's life?

483
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:34,525
You promised!

484
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,518
When my dad got
electrocuted at the farm,

485
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:37,789
Muthiah rescued my father.

486
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:41,797
Then when my dad got electrocuted
in the toilet, Armugam saved him.

487
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:45,017
When he got electrocuted at his
work place, Mr. Mixture saved him.

488
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:50,057
Do you think I can fall in love with
all those who save my father's life?

489
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,331
I thought I was the only one...

490
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:53,190
but looks like many
have kissed your dad!

491
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:56,139
Look here. First, change
yourself and have some humanity.

492
00:31:56,357 --> 00:31:58,036
You would’ve killed
many so far...

493
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:01,111
but have you ever saved a life?

494
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:05,646
I'm leaving.

495
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:09,955
So, go save someone's
life and then come to me.

496
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:12,432
Didn't I save you dad's life?

497
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:13,620
Come to my home...

498
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,276
and I shall ask my
dad to kiss you.

499
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:19,541
Virgin boys' curse will
follow you forever!

500
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:28,087
Of late, Madurai has been
crossing his limits.

501
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:29,734
Keep a check on him Senthamarai.

502
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:31,932
Whenever Madurai
is under control,

503
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:34,355
that means it is the
silence before the storm.

504
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:35,706
Do you want to witness it?

505
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,077
Did Madurai come this way?

506
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:42,913
Senior...

507
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:43,632
Aunties...

508
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:44,858
did you happen to see Madurai?

509
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:46,850
What about you?

510
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:48,076
No?

511
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:50,813
Madurai!

512
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:52,680
Why are you standing here?

513
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:54,510
- Why? - What do you mean?

514
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,827
Didn't we steal 4 sacks of rice from
this government provision store?

515
00:32:59,296 --> 00:33:01,403
And you are waiting in a queue
in front of the same shop!

516
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:04,178
Yesterday, 4 sacks of rice
went missing from here.

517
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,617
It appears to me like he is
complaining about us to the police.

518
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:11,258
Look at my love, Selvi!

519
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,055
She has been ogling
at me since morning.

520
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:14,412
- And now this! - Look at her...

521
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:17,247
- she is looking at me without blinking.
- It doesn't look so Madurai.

522
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:20,053
You won't realize.
I'll show you.

523
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:22,608
Look at me.

524
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:29,698
(Gibberish)

525
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:30,792
You saw right?

526
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,799
Even you yawned when
you looked at me.

527
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:34,837
This is contagious.

528
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:38,893
She will also yawn when
she will look at me.

529
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:41,883
Wait and watch.

530
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,814
Love.

531
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,054
That old lady yawned.

532
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:02,851
That's because she
looked at you.

533
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,212
Second try.

534
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,751
It won't miss.

535
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:09,710
Love.

536
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:12,789
Everyone yawned except her.

537
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:15,822
Do you see him, Somu?

538
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,900
I doubt him.

539
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,946
The police are looking at us.

540
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:23,018
Let's go. Come on.

541
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,232
Please, come on. Let's go.

542
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:27,504
Your voice ain't worthy of
speaking multiple languages.

543
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:17,543
mine is a special kind of hair.

544
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:19,458
So please use a
hygienic scissors.

545
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:20,700
You mean scissors.

546
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:23,531
I had bought a
scissor from Burma.

547
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:27,008
I shall be using it for the 2nd
time and this time on your hair

548
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:28,299
2nd time?

549
00:35:28,438 --> 00:35:30,857
So, whose hair did you
cut with it first?

550
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:33,908
I cut the tail of
a wild elephant.

551
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:36,833
What happened to
that elephant then?

552
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:39,473
As soon as it lost
its tail, it died.

553
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,847
I'll come back some other day.

554
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:43,385
That happened to the elephant.

555
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,035
It won't happen to
a fool like you.

556
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:47,418
- Hope nothing will happen.
- Don't worry. I'm here.

557
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:48,934
You know what,

558
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,592
I've witnessed all your plays.

559
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:56,622
Now when I step out, please do not touch
any of the switch to turn on the lights.

560
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:59,233
Why would I do that?
I've had enough.

561
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,557
- I won't. - Sharp fellow.

562
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:06,698
There is enough brightness here. I won't
touch the switch to turn on the lights.

563
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:08,822
But it's quite stuffy in here.

564
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:10,793
Switching on the fan
would be a nice idea.

565
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,048
Fan switch won't hurt.

566
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,580
After all it's a small switch.

567
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,946
Only the light's
switch is a heavy one.

568
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:20,964
I am not supposed to touch the
switch that turn on the lights.

569
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:27,847
How many times should I warn
you to keep you fingers quiet?

570
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,639
First, let me take my fee.

571
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:32,709
This is for me, for the medical expenses.
Let me try the mouth on mouth aid.

572
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,846
Looks like an electric transformer
has burst inside him!

573
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,595
Tell me something, doesn't you
wife provide the earthing?

574
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,455
What a life?

575
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:50,699
It is stuck in between my hands and
mouth, nothing else in between.

576
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,448
Wherever I going...

577
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:54,178
I always hand keeping.

578
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:57,090
Everyone present there keeps
their mouth on me. What a life?

579
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,380
You! Get out!

580
00:36:58,503 --> 00:37:00,503
Never seen a beggar like him!

581
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:04,534
Madurai Michael speaking.

582
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,471
It's me, Selvi.

583
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:06,598
Go ahead.

584
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:08,276
Need to get married! Right away!

585
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:10,176
Come to the registrar office.

586
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:12,089
Selvi? What are you talking?

587
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:13,419
There is no time to waste.

588
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,397
The more it gets delayed, more
complications will arise.

589
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:16,377
Madurai!

590
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,830
Madurai on his way!

591
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:37,257
Where is my bride?

592
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:38,830
- There, over there.
- Where is the garland?

593
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:39,635
- Welcome. - Let's get married.

594
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,682
In 2mins the auspicious
time will get over. Quick.

595
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:42,454
Get married quickly.

596
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:42,947
Hold on.

597
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:43,822
Come here.

598
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:46,457
- She is my friend, Revathy.
- Greetings brother.

599
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,720
Both of them belong
to different caste.

600
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:50,546
Madurai, they have eloped
from their houses.

601
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:51,725
Must get them married.

602
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:53,451
Their folks,

603
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,294
are chasing them ferociously.

604
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:56,914
They will be here any minute.

605
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,482
- That is why I called you
for protection. - Brother...

606
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:01,670
you are our savior!

607
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:03,297
Who are you?!

608
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:05,822
How many more lives
should I save for her?

609
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,288
I rushed down believing
we are getting married.

610
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:09,173
What?

611
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:10,139
What do you mean by what?

612
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,466
You thought we are
getting married?

613
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,334
If that happens...

614
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,303
that will be the
end of this world.

615
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,093
You!

616
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:23,954
I got dressed up for nothing!

617
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:24,759
Madurai!

618
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:27,495
Virgin boys' curse will
follow you forever!

619
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:29,918
I guess I'll stay
virgin forever!

620
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:33,506
Already she has blown off everything!
You stop it!

621
00:38:35,715 --> 00:38:37,715
Hell has been unleashed here....

622
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:41,381
and I don't know who he is but he keeps
eating the mixture snack all the time!

623
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:43,676
One day I am gonna beak his jaw!

624
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,494
Looks like Somu's friend.

625
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:49,657
Who are they?

626
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,759
Dude, the whole village
seems to be here.

627
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:53,853
Yep! When I saw the car I
didn't expect this much crowd!

628
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,878
Your dad and the
villagers are here.

629
00:38:56,493 --> 00:38:58,043
Isn't this the
registrar's office?

630
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,169
Yes, indeed. Please go inside.
Please.

631
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:01,669
Daddy!

632
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,818
How dare you bring shame
to us and our family?!

633
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,869
Do you think you can get married to a
guy from another caste and elope away?

634
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:08,619
I will chop you down both!

635
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:11,383
- Daddy! We are not the ones
getting married. - Then?

636
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:12,977
It's Selvi.

637
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:14,318
Are you getting married?

638
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:15,419
What the heck?

639
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:17,069
He will finish us off
if I say the truth!

640
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:19,516
Are you getting married?

641
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:21,398
Tell them!

642
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:22,635
Speak!

643
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:25,957
Yes.

644
00:39:25,982 --> 00:39:27,009
Who is the groom?

645
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,062
Our Madurai!

646
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:48,041
Put it on her.

647
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,705
As you order.

648
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:51,961
There you go dear.

649
00:39:51,986 --> 00:39:52,962
Now, your turn.

650
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:53,938
I won't

651
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:56,697
Come on now, do the honors.

652
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:59,417
That's it. I've seen many marriages
happening in Madurai city,

653
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:02,147
but today Madurai is getting married.
Here tie the knot!

654
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,291
As you order.

655
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:08,409
You were so stubborn.
Now look what happened?

656
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,473
Let our deity bless you.

657
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,587
The marriage went really well.

658
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:14,041
Thanks a lot to everybody here.

659
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,321
If you could do the necessary arrangements
for our 1st night as couple...

660
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:18,854
Come on Madurai. Is that a big deal?
You can take care of it.

661
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,111
There they go! Looks like I've
to take care of it myself.

662
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:23,136
I know you don't approve
of this marriage.

663
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:24,925
But as far as I am
concerned we are married.

664
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,289
Superb!

665
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:51,236
Cheers!

666
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,314
You have prepared it too raw!

667
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:58,577
It's very bitter yet do
you know why we drink?

668
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:01,086
- Why?
- For getting high and feeling good.

669
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:04,125
Similarly, do you know why do we fall
in love though it's very painful?

670
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,150
Only then our life
will be wonderful.

671
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:09,541
Buddy, you are the first to
get married in our group.

672
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:12,232
I am very happy!

673
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:15,746
Somu! We must celebrate this,
in an even more bigger way.

674
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,934
Shut up! You call
this a marriage?

675
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,961
The 1st night between
the couple is the

676
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:22,238
assurance that this
marriage is consummated.

677
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:23,751
Did that happen?

678
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:24,723
No.

679
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,386
Then the marriage is void.

680
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:27,966
Listen, Kathiri Somu!

681
00:41:28,495 --> 00:41:30,539
I don't like her very much...

682
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,367
but I wonder how will I
lead a life with her?

683
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,437
But if I ever lead
a family life...

684
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:36,980
then it's definitely with her.

685
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:39,100
Do you think she is
better than Sumathi?

686
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:40,652
Or better than Rani?

687
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:41,773
No way!

688
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:43,326
She is my Selvi!

689
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:47,262
Selvi, whom Michael
tied the knot with.

690
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,332
Whether the marriage
was real or not...

691
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:51,070
but I did it!

692
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:52,093
- When? - When?

693
00:41:52,394 --> 00:41:53,472
I mean I tied the knot!
I did it!

694
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:54,128
Drat!

695
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:55,523
But then...

696
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:57,605
we are yet to consummate
the marriage.

697
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,529
And that is why I say that
this marriage is void!

698
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:01,826
Madurai, your wife
is waiting inside.

699
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:03,058
- She is here already? - Move!

700
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,715
3 minute wife.

701
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,849
What does that mean?

702
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,629
3rd minute after the
marriage, she left the spot!

703
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:14,065
This doesn't seem to work out.

704
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,761
Why does Selvi look so old?

705
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:20,198
- That's a old woman.
- Your wife is here.

706
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:23,880
- Something like marriage happened
between us. - Greetings chief.

707
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:26,287
- Greetings. - Greetings.

708
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:27,448
Look here.

709
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:28,755
I can't take it.

710
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:30,826
- What?
- I said, I can't take it anymore.

711
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:33,382
The baby shower is for her but
the spotlight isn't on her.

712
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:36,444
They haven't switched on the bulbs
on this side of the stage. Fools!

713
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:37,725
I shall go switch it on.

714
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:38,703
- No! - Dad no!

715
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:41,023
Why? What's wrong in
switching on those bulbs?

716
00:42:41,048 --> 00:42:43,140
When you and electricity
are incompatible then why?

717
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:44,782
Same is the case with us
but don't I touch you?

718
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:47,111
He is old yet shameless!

719
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:49,127
- Don't worry.
- Selvi, explain him!

720
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:50,884
Somebody, please
make him understand!

721
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,904
It won't affect him;
finally it'll affect us!

722
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:54,806
- Listen dad, no! - Don't do it!

723
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:56,831
Just sit down! I'll handle it.

724
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:58,372
Tell him!

725
00:42:58,398 --> 00:42:59,849
Watch me switch it on.

726
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,693
Just a press that's all!

727
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:02,921
Listen to me!

728
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:04,996
Nothing will happen to me!

729
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:07,552
There he goes again!

730
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:09,732
Leave him! Let him go.

731
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:13,385
Oh my god! Why doesn't he
pay heed to me at all?

732
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,932
Dude, give him the
mouth to mouth aid.

733
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:16,637
- Your his wife. Save him.
- In front of everyone?

734
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:17,701
Not to me. Do it to him.

735
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:20,554
Your husband's life
is on the edge.

736
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,511
Place your mouth on his mouth and
give him the necessary earthing!

737
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,155
Oh! Oh! She also fainted!

738
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:27,783
I know about his mouth!

739
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:30,542
- This ain't a mouth! - Is there
nobody else here to rescue them?

740
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,537
- No matter what, I wont' ask your help!
- Please don't!

741
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:35,574
Lord of death is
welcoming your dad!

742
00:43:35,692 --> 00:43:37,692
He forcefully married me!

743
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:41,123
- He is slowly fading away.
- Let him!

744
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:42,104
He is fading away!

745
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:44,651
I must sacrifice my life for
you and my mouth for your dad?

746
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:47,057
Please save my dad Michael!

747
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:50,744
And in return I'll agree to
anything that you ask me for.

748
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:55,125
I am indeed dangerous
but not cheap!

749
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:56,342
And a little bad.

750
00:43:56,788 --> 00:43:59,546
Madurai do something.
We are losing time.

751
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:02,540
I guess this is my fate. Oh god!

752
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,218
Make it fast!

753
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:06,243
Please save me god!

754
00:44:06,649 --> 00:44:07,733
Here you go!

755
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:10,835
He is back!

756
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,741
Come let's not
wait here anymore.

757
00:44:15,782 --> 00:44:16,232
Same feel.

758
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:17,200
Was it you again?

759
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:19,225
Michael! Madurai!

760
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:22,380
- Madurai Michael! You sweet little
fellow. - Better not to talk to her.

761
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:23,858
Stop! Michael!

762
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:24,794
What is it?

763
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:26,154
I don't like you.

764
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:27,521
I know it.

765
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:31,054
I don't know how am I going to
lead a family life with you.

766
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:34,187
But if I ever lead
a family life...

767
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:35,652
then it's with you!

768
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:37,317
Do you think you are
awesome that Azhagar?

769
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:39,124
Or better that Paraman?

770
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:41,163
You are Michael!

771
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:44,748
Micheal, who tied the
knot with Selvi!

772
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,533
I don't know if the
marriage was real or not.

773
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:50,728
You did it.

774
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:52,550
I mean you tied the knot.
You did it!

775
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:56,163
So, you were eavesdropping?

776
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:57,748
What's the use?

777
00:44:58,818 --> 00:45:00,503
We haven't consummated
our marriage yet.

778
00:45:00,528 --> 00:45:01,981
Shall we consummate?

779
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:04,997
Really?

780
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,387
Why is she playing my part?

781
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:15,803
Finally, you have lost your
virginity Madurai Michael!

782
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:22,002
- Let's start.
- Sir!

783
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:23,853
- Sir, please get down.
- Why?

784
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,923
You accepted the bribe
paid by chief, yet you

785
00:45:25,948 --> 00:45:28,105
are making your own calls.
What's up with that?

786
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,088
I am the judge!

787
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:30,267
Go tell Senthamarai.

788
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:31,838
This car won't obey him!

789
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,821
Chief, what you are
doing isn't right.

790
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:35,428
He is a kid!

791
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:37,895
He is only worthy of abducting
women and slaying men.

792
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:40,113
He isn't worthy of
slaying the judge.

793
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:41,448
I am here.

794
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:42,799
Give me a chance.

795
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,511
He doesn't go in search
of opportunities.

796
00:45:44,715 --> 00:45:46,045
He creates his own opportunities.

797
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:47,631
You believe him a bit too much!

798
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,947
He is humble to those
who stay modest.

799
00:45:52,564 --> 00:45:54,649
He is a volcano to
those who oppose him!

800
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:09,801
The earth rumbles
when he steps down.

801
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:14,012
By now the judge will be trembling!

802
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:58,469
Please don't harm me Michael!

803
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:00,279
No Michael! Please.

804
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,388
Time to slay him, slay him,

805
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:03,295
slay him!

806
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,068
Please listen to me Michael.
No! Please!

807
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:06,655
Michael!

808
00:47:34,149 --> 00:47:35,860
My hero!

809
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:41,954
Always keeping gobbling
up the mixture snack!

810
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:47,491
What a dialogue?!

811
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,383
What an action?!

812
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,506
What a style?!

813
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:58,109
Do you know what I
like about him?

814
00:47:58,484 --> 00:47:59,871
It's his beard!

815
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,121
I too have similar beard.

816
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:02,644
He will have a son.

817
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:04,637
Mark my words, his
son will go places.

818
00:48:05,222 --> 00:48:06,629
How do you know it?

819
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:09,882
Watch the movie!

820
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:15,842
Madurai...

821
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:18,897
in such a pitch dark
place,

822
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:21,480
have you ever slayed anyone?

823
00:48:21,505 --> 00:48:23,287
Slaying is something that is
mostly done during the dark hours.

824
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:25,095
What if you slay the
wrong person instead?

825
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,139
It happens often.

826
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:28,874
But none of them died.

827
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,991
Even if we get the wrong person,
we'll save that person.

828
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:33,031
What if you kill me similarly?

829
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:34,352
Crazy!

830
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,565
I might even get confused if
you appear in front of me...

831
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,033
but I'll definitely figure
you out from your shadow.

832
00:48:40,778 --> 00:48:42,778
I'm love with the shape of you.

833
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:45,210
We don't need this Madurai.

834
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:47,802
Quit this for good.

835
00:48:51,404 --> 00:48:52,490
You want me to quit?

836
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:56,021
They are the hands that fed
me when I was starving.

837
00:48:57,786 --> 00:48:59,059
They are my top most priority.

838
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:00,801
You came in later. Right?

839
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:05,636
If you think this is your life...

840
00:49:07,105 --> 00:49:08,589
then change that thought Madurai.

841
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:10,948
Someday, if someone lose
the fear on you and...

842
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:12,869
if they go ahead and...

843
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:14,550
become a witness against you...

844
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:16,368
then forever...

845
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,960
you will be behind the bars.
Then, with your memories...

846
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:22,888
I'll lead a struggling life.

847
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,264
Do you think anyone has the guts to
witness against me, Madurai Michael?

848
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:28,878
Madurai...

849
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,471
for you...

850
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:31,839
I shall give up everything.

851
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:33,758
Come.

852
00:49:34,191 --> 00:49:35,589
Let's leave this place for good.

853
00:49:35,966 --> 00:49:37,653
Leave this place? To where?

854
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,795
Dubai.

855
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,083
Let's go there and
make a living somehow.

856
00:49:46,144 --> 00:49:47,326
You must change.

857
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,684
Our life must change.

858
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:51,965
Promise me.

859
00:49:52,899 --> 00:49:54,389
You must quit everything.

860
00:49:55,069 --> 00:49:55,779
Promise me.

861
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:57,976
I need a man who leads
a life with me.

862
00:49:58,101 --> 00:49:59,710
I want Michael to lead
a life with Selvi.

863
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:01,226
I don't want this Madurai.

864
00:50:01,804 --> 00:50:03,204
When you look at few people...

865
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:05,299
you have felt pity for
them, you told me this.

866
00:50:05,324 --> 00:50:06,589
Look at me.

867
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:09,288
Don't you feel pity for me?

868
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:12,468
Promise me Madurai!

869
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:22,186
I shall quit everything
and come with you.

870
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:23,922
Just for you, my Selvi!

871
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,561
Somu, where have you hid Madurai?
Tell us!

872
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:44,962
Madurai quit this
profession for good.

873
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:47,345
And you call out to Madurai now?

874
00:50:48,517 --> 00:50:51,447
You too have been missing since
the day he went missing.

875
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,055
What's this get up?

876
00:50:53,162 --> 00:50:54,935
You better tell me!

877
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,960
This is my family business.

878
00:50:57,085 --> 00:50:58,927
During the morning I do the snip!
Snip!

879
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:00,955
And by night I stab! Stab!

880
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:03,720
Answer me or I'll
slit your throat!

881
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:07,477
I shall do anything for money.

882
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:10,853
But never will I
betray a friend!

883
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:11,970
Because...

884
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:15,814
I really don't know!

885
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:19,318
I am too clueless like you!
You crazy!

886
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:20,913
Go look out for Madurai!

887
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:24,010
If you come across him
then intimate me too.

888
00:51:24,276 --> 00:51:25,739
Move! Move! Quick!

889
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,653
Leave you son of a satan!

890
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:28,705
Madurai...

891
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,730
you just left with that woman.

892
00:51:30,947 --> 00:51:34,986
I guess these fellows will finish me
of before I find a woman for myself!

893
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:35,781
Madurai.

894
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:36,522
Madurai.

895
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,408
I'm sure, you aren't doing this for her.

896
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,701
There is something else.
Tell me the truth.

897
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:42,966
Yes, it's not for her...

898
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:44,943
it's for my life.

899
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:46,170
I don't believe this.

900
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:49,245
What's this?

901
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:50,956
Hope you know who tied this?

902
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,737
-  Senthamarai gave it to you.
- It's bigger than this.

903
00:51:53,815 --> 00:51:55,738
- Try to understand.
- Who is making you do this?

904
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:58,222
No one can make me do things.

905
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:00,948
And I haven't disobeyed him.

906
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:03,130
He will take care of everything.

907
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:03,883
Now leave.

908
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,698
Just leave. Go!

909
00:52:08,846 --> 00:52:10,650
Madurai is not longer
with Senthamarai.

910
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:12,050
This is the right time.

911
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,305
All the other police
officers are charged up!

912
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:15,903
We must do something now.

913
00:52:39,261 --> 00:52:41,204
Madurai has been
missing for long now.

914
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:42,883
This doesn't feel right.

915
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:43,821
Chief...

916
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:46,479
He must have joined hands
with someone else by now.

917
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,618
You satan!

918
00:52:47,712 --> 00:52:50,200
He is not the one who keeps jumping
from one group to another.

919
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:51,636
He makes his own group!

920
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,972
This has been his profession
since his childhood.

921
00:52:56,558 --> 00:52:59,539
You won't know it.
You are new to this.

922
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,171
Buddy, come on! Let's leave.

923
00:53:01,257 --> 00:53:02,931
I shall bring him; no
matter where he is.

924
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:03,563
Come on Somu.

925
00:53:03,704 --> 00:53:05,303
Don't you mess with us!

926
00:53:06,945 --> 00:53:08,676
He is a nothing chief!

927
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,457
I am here for you.

928
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,392
Madurai Michael my foot!

929
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:15,035
Madurai is pretty much
here but where is Michael?

930
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:16,658
Take that out!

931
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,229
It's windy.

932
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,167
Windy?

933
00:53:27,557 --> 00:53:28,901
Here comes the Tornado!

934
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:50,099
I know that you must be furious. Hence, I
am here to talk to you for once and all.

935
00:53:50,365 --> 00:53:51,119
For once and all?

936
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:53,150
I don't get it Madurai!

937
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:54,188
I want to move to Dubai.

938
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,016
I want to quit
everything for Selvi.

939
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,226
I've decide to turn a
new leaf in my life.

940
00:53:58,438 --> 00:53:59,478
But not matter what...

941
00:54:00,216 --> 00:54:01,753
I can't stay without you.

942
00:54:01,936 --> 00:54:03,152
But I don't see a way out.

943
00:54:03,435 --> 00:54:05,651
You came to me as Michael.

944
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:06,301
Now...

945
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,511
you've grown big and have
become 'Madurai' Michael!

946
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:12,067
You have the full rights
to decide your life.

947
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,340
For your love, Selvi...

948
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,222
you are ready to
quit everything...

949
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,019
but slay one more enemy for me.

950
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,247
No. I don't want to do it.

951
00:54:21,272 --> 00:54:22,558
Please let me go.

952
00:54:22,901 --> 00:54:24,375
I'm...I'm leaving.

953
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:25,258
I shall let you go Michael.

954
00:54:25,283 --> 00:54:27,993
I shall arrange everything
for you to reach Dubai.

955
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,093
I shall see you and Selvi off.

956
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:31,524
How much money do you want?

957
00:54:31,629 --> 00:54:33,708
I shall give. Leave for good.

958
00:54:33,865 --> 00:54:36,036
But just once for my sake
and the sake of my caste...

959
00:54:36,393 --> 00:54:38,246
just do this final task.

960
00:54:39,894 --> 00:54:41,602
Castes never made humans.

961
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:43,345
Humans made the castes.

962
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:44,822
You are a good human being.

963
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:46,307
I shall do it for you.

964
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:47,518
Now, tie it up!

965
00:54:56,823 --> 00:55:00,299
You may wish for anything but it shouldn't
be something that belongs to others.

966
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,869
Superb!

967
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:05,885
Come on!

968
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:19,999
It's not that easy to
slay someone in the club.

969
00:55:21,937 --> 00:55:23,937
The scan each and
everybody for weapons.

970
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,947
If they find anyone
carrying weapon...

971
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:30,392
they will finish them off on the
same spot with that very weapon!

972
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:04,916
Madurai! Madurai!

973
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:06,518
Do you have to weapon or not?

974
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:07,996
I'm really nervous.

975
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:09,177
Do you have the weapon or not?

976
00:56:09,202 --> 00:56:10,339
I have the weapon.

977
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:11,956
- Where did you hide it?
- Exactly!

978
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:13,371
The weapon is inside me.

979
00:56:21,338 --> 00:56:23,432
Why have you covered
it up so much?

980
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:26,265
It's pointy, it might pierce in.

981
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:27,477
You are correct.

982
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:29,671
Even the whites won't
get such ideas.

983
00:56:29,696 --> 00:56:31,266
Correct Somu!

984
00:57:35,106 --> 00:57:35,754
Ok.

985
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:07,181
Who turned off the power?

986
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:11,007
I've finished him. Let's leave.

987
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:12,746
- There he is. Go finish him.
- I did it already.

988
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:13,638
What do you mean?

989
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:15,754
Whom did you stab?

990
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:23,393
There goes the power!

991
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,417
Sundaram, how goes
the card game?

992
00:58:25,456 --> 00:58:26,729
Why are you so late?

993
00:58:28,643 --> 00:58:30,643
Muruga! Muruga?!

994
00:58:30,703 --> 00:58:32,571
Oh my god! Someone
has stabbed Murugan!

995
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,680
- Selvi's dad?!
- Please help.

996
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,141
Make it fast.

997
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:38,674
- Someone please take him to the hospital.
- No. Listen.

998
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,032
Make it fast!

999
00:58:40,055 --> 00:58:41,813
Please stop wondering!

1000
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:44,780
- You leave.
- Muruga! Muruga!

1001
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,850
Oh my god!

1002
00:58:46,952 --> 00:58:48,966
- We shall take care of him.
- Somebody please help.

1003
00:58:48,967 --> 00:58:50,607
Don't let him die. Save him!

1004
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:52,677
There goes the target!
The target!

1005
00:58:54,373 --> 00:58:57,347
Muruga! Lift him. Let's
take him to a hospital now!

1006
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,870
Lift him.

1007
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,109
Michael!

1008
00:59:16,336 --> 00:59:17,413
Selvi...

1009
00:59:18,412 --> 00:59:20,874
I stabbed your
father by mistake.

1010
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,324
Forgive me.

1011
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:24,454
- I committed a blunder.
- I know that Michael.

1012
00:59:25,383 --> 00:59:27,554
But the whole town
saw you stab him.

1013
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:30,026
Now, if anyone
becomes a witness...

1014
00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:32,290
your life is over.

1015
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,470
No one will become a witness.

1016
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,860
What I regret is,
stabbing your dad.

1017
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:40,091
Why are you crying?

1018
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:42,747
It's not like my dad died!

1019
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:44,380
He survived right?

1020
00:59:46,827 --> 00:59:48,036
Let's not stay here.

1021
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:49,934
Before someone sees us...

1022
00:59:50,536 --> 00:59:51,433
let's elope to Dubai.

1023
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:54,535
How can you leave your
dad at this hour?

1024
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:55,838
Look here,

1025
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:58,518
my mom is here to
take care of my dad.

1026
01:00:00,006 --> 01:00:02,006
Only I am here to
take care of you.

1027
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:06,637
Won't you take care of
me like my father did?

1028
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:08,311
Don't say that.

1029
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:09,419
Let's leave immediately.

1030
01:00:09,779 --> 01:00:11,708
We don't have time. Come on.

1031
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:40,611
Madurai, you are trapped!

1032
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,464
What's all this?

1033
01:00:41,633 --> 01:00:42,587
Are you kidding?

1034
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:45,579
Today we make you pay for all
the murders you committed.

1035
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:48,775
Does Senthamarai know
this is happening?

1036
01:00:48,776 --> 01:00:50,463
Do you have any evidences?
Any witnesses?

1037
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:51,651
There is a witness!

1038
01:00:51,933 --> 01:00:53,036
Who is the witness?

1039
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:53,958
Come out!

1040
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,392
The murder at the club.

1041
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:02,636
The murder of the judge.

1042
01:01:02,797 --> 01:01:04,093
In total, 18 murders.

1043
01:01:04,196 --> 01:01:06,047
You'll be hanged
to death for sure.

1044
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:09,129
Arrest him.

1045
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,331
Michael!

1046
01:01:17,893 --> 01:01:18,799
Just a minute...

1047
01:01:19,925 --> 01:01:21,120
Let me talk to her.

1048
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,192
I won't let you go.

1049
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:20,587
I'll be back.

1050
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:28,118
Selvi!

1051
01:02:29,023 --> 01:02:30,445
Hope you remember?

1052
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,696
I'll be back for sure!

1053
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:41,394
Superb!

1054
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:01,437
As planned.

1055
01:03:02,156 --> 01:03:04,598
We helped Madurai to break
out from the prison.

1056
01:03:05,418 --> 01:03:06,253
For what?

1057
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,699
Selvi was about to get
married that day.

1058
01:03:09,262 --> 01:03:11,769
Selvi was waiting for Michael.

1059
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,900
It's fine now. I am doing better.

1060
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,196
Phew!

1061
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:26,454
Both of you get down.

1062
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:28,806
- Go get Selvi before she ties the knot.
- Come on.

1063
01:03:29,188 --> 01:03:30,125
Come on Madurai.

1064
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:31,671
Somu keep everything ready.

1065
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,484
Madurai, what are you up to?
It's getting late.

1066
01:03:34,633 --> 01:03:36,984
She is about to tie the know.
Go get her.

1067
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,209
What's wrong with you?

1068
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:45,553
What is she going to do with me?

1069
01:03:47,922 --> 01:03:49,922
I broke the promise I made her.

1070
01:03:50,255 --> 01:03:52,255
Our lives won't change forever.

1071
01:03:52,764 --> 01:03:54,320
At least let her life
change for good.

1072
01:03:54,537 --> 01:03:57,289
It is said that, one who chooses the
path of violence fails in life.

1073
01:03:57,496 --> 01:04:00,602
But it was never said that one who
chooses violence fails in love too.

1074
01:04:02,027 --> 01:04:04,199
Is this why we brought
you out of prison?

1075
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:06,777
We did it so that you and
Selvi can lead a happy life.

1076
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:09,261
Love is not about
marrying the lover.

1077
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:11,997
All that matters is the happiness
of the person we love.

1078
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:13,424
Now, that is true love.

1079
01:04:14,523 --> 01:04:15,921
Let her be happy.

1080
01:04:16,492 --> 01:04:17,836
She has asked me many times...

1081
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:20,394
that if I've changed
anyone's life for good?

1082
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:22,464
Now, let me change
her life for good.

1083
01:04:22,565 --> 01:04:23,609
Let her be happy forever.

1084
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:25,738
Let her lead a happy
and peaceful life.

1085
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:29,503
Everyone has a wrong opinion about
you when it comes to love and woman.

1086
01:04:29,593 --> 01:04:32,539
But no one realizes how pure your heart is.

1087
01:04:32,704 --> 01:04:34,704
So be it. Superb! Now leave!

1088
01:04:34,852 --> 01:04:36,086
Listen Madurai! No!

1089
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,244
His ego stays in tact,
no matter what!

1090
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:38,510
- Leave me.
- Listen!

1091
01:04:41,102 --> 01:04:43,638
Why did he leave Selvi?

1092
01:04:44,016 --> 01:04:46,016
He asks me to drive
to Pondicherry.

1093
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:49,177
Top of that he says that we are
moving to Dubai from there.

1094
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,649
Looks like won't rest until he
makes me clean the camel stable!

1095
01:04:52,759 --> 01:04:55,462
Well over all it looks
like this is my fate!

1096
01:04:55,903 --> 01:04:56,629
Madurai...

1097
01:04:57,243 --> 01:04:58,297
it's hard to digest.

1098
01:04:59,477 --> 01:05:00,273
Tell me the truth.

1099
01:05:00,899 --> 01:05:02,547
Why did you leave Selvi.

1100
01:05:05,711 --> 01:05:06,476
Because...

1101
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:08,957
I feel pity for her.

1102
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:16,089
I have murdered many
of them so far.

1103
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:19,023
But it was only for her
I sacrificed myself.

1104
01:05:21,891 --> 01:05:22,781
It's ok.

1105
01:05:24,048 --> 01:05:25,022
She must be happy.

1106
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:26,896
She will be happy.

1107
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,141
Henceforth...

1108
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,507
I am not Madurai
Michael anymore.

1109
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:42,044
The moment I have stepped
out of Madurai...

1110
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,051
Hereafter I am just Michael!

1111
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:46,238
Only Michael!

1112
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:55,580
Madurai.

1113
01:05:56,951 --> 01:05:57,401
Michael!

1114
01:05:57,951 --> 01:05:58,920
Shall we go?

1115
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:00,233
We left Madurai...

1116
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:02,326
and went to Pondicherry port.

1117
01:06:02,912 --> 01:06:04,100
From there myself,

1118
01:06:04,404 --> 01:06:05,229
Somu...

1119
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:06,222
and Michael...

1120
01:06:06,472 --> 01:06:07,597
all 3 of us...

1121
01:06:08,074 --> 01:06:08,987
left to Dubai.

1122
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:10,526
We escaped to Dubai!

1123
01:06:11,876 --> 01:06:13,141
What happened?

1124
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:15,259
Please! Bring some water.

1125
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:17,233
We shook the whole Dubai!

1126
01:06:17,462 --> 01:06:19,212
We rocked Dubai!

1127
01:06:19,256 --> 01:06:19,706
Relax!

1128
01:06:20,967 --> 01:06:22,561
Are you ok?

1129
01:06:22,795 --> 01:06:26,979
Every gangster  and mafia in Dubai;

1130
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,697
we gave a run for their money!

1131
01:06:29,926 --> 01:06:31,806
The story isn't over yet!

1132
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,380
It isn't over yet!

1133
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,313
Not yet!

1134
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,813
Madurai Michael.

1135
01:06:35,923 --> 01:06:38,125
A big don in Dubai?
How is it possible?

1136
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,899
World wide wanted mafia head.

1137
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:44,355
A gangster that rocked Dubai!

1138
01:06:45,444 --> 01:06:46,317
No trace.

1139
01:06:47,355 --> 01:06:48,651
Not even a single picture.

1140
01:06:52,869 --> 01:06:53,865
Michael.

1141
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:56,160
Madurai Michael!

1142
01:06:56,691 --> 01:06:58,082
Age: 30.

1143
01:06:59,012 --> 01:07:01,012
So, now he will be 55.

1144
01:07:01,854 --> 01:07:03,854
He will be an oldie for sure.

1145
01:07:03,974 --> 01:07:04,827
Old man!

1146
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:08,611
What's the story that
took place in between?

1147
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:12,876
Don!

1148
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:17,383
An oldie who rocked Dubai...

1149
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,353
where will he be now?

1150
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,928
What would he be doing now?

1151
01:07:20,195 --> 01:07:21,879
He must be afraid to
come out in the light.

1152
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,103
He must be afraid
of getting caught.

1153
01:07:24,261 --> 01:07:27,270
He must be hiding and being cautious
out there somewhere in the forest.

1154
01:07:27,353 --> 01:07:29,525
Just like a caged dove...

1155
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:31,807
the old man must be
struggling for his freedom!

1156
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:07,826
Sister, 3 old men stay
in such a big house.

1157
01:08:07,935 --> 01:08:08,725
Who are they?

1158
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,940
This is actress Sri Devi's house.

1159
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,013
4 years ago, Ashwin
sir bought it.

1160
01:08:15,038 --> 01:08:17,084
This guy,  'Nighty' Somu..

1161
01:08:17,533 --> 01:08:23,082
he will make lives of any fair woman,
who comes here for work, a living hell.

1162
01:08:26,872 --> 01:08:28,145
What about that baldie?

1163
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:29,525
That baldie?

1164
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:32,461
Seems like he was an
police officer in Madurai.

1165
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:36,050
Dunno what happened but he has been the
security guard here for 10 years now.

1166
01:08:36,143 --> 01:08:40,352
When Ashwin sir bought this
house, he tagged along with him.

1167
01:08:40,804 --> 01:08:43,718
Only later I found out that
all 3 are old friends.

1168
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:48,704
At night, in the name of taking a selfie,
the baldie will roam around in his briefs.

1169
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:51,048
Ashwin sir is pure at heart.

1170
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,255
If anyone comes here
in need of help...

1171
01:08:53,427 --> 01:08:54,678
he won't refuse;
just like the god.

1172
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:55,976
What is it Sivakumar?

1173
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:58,312
Didn't you collect the
college fee last month?

1174
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,013
Any other problem?

1175
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,450
Sir, she couldn't attend college for a
week as she came down with dengue fever.

1176
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:05,870
She was ordered to
meet the college dean.

1177
01:09:06,088 --> 01:09:07,481
She went to meet the dean...

1178
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:09,996
in his room, with
the leave letter.

1179
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:12,697
He gave her some juice to drink.

1180
01:09:13,596 --> 01:09:14,549
She drank it and...

1181
01:09:15,674 --> 01:09:17,411
fell asleep.

1182
01:09:17,906 --> 01:09:19,579
And when she was
asleep, she was...

1183
01:09:20,662 --> 01:09:22,357
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1184
01:09:22,669 --> 01:09:24,498
They earn in millions!

1185
01:09:25,223 --> 01:09:27,507
Can't he afford women who
does anything for money?

1186
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,395
She is a young girl.

1187
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:31,532
To top it off, that
son of a gun...

1188
01:09:31,778 --> 01:09:33,590
is given the tag of
"Father of education"

1189
01:09:34,597 --> 01:09:35,943
Political power, money...

1190
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:39,716
with these things they wreck havoc
in the lives of poor people like us.

1191
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:43,443
Michael!

1192
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:46,017
Michael!

1193
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:48,138
Did you read the
newspaper today?

1194
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,029
- I did.
- That Madurai Kapoor...

1195
01:09:50,054 --> 01:09:51,929
had moved to Chennai 4 years ago.

1196
01:09:52,294 --> 01:09:53,873
He never came in front of us.

1197
01:09:54,255 --> 01:09:56,570
- So what?
- What do you mean?

1198
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:59,719
He is the reason for you
being single until now.

1199
01:09:59,942 --> 01:10:01,481
If not, you and Selvi...

1200
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:04,020
would have had a family
with children right now.

1201
01:10:04,552 --> 01:10:07,418
Even at this age you have to
jump from Madurai to Dubai,

1202
01:10:07,443 --> 01:10:08,810
Dubai to Chennai...

1203
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:12,516
change your identity and name!
What a sick life!?

1204
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,361
Michael, you must kill him!

1205
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:17,386
He is a traitor.
You must kill him!

1206
01:10:17,668 --> 01:10:18,815
What after killing him?

1207
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,276
If he dies...

1208
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:22,754
will I get back what I lost?

1209
01:10:23,142 --> 01:10:25,267
Lints, guns, sound
of the bullet...

1210
01:10:25,536 --> 01:10:27,434
I am keeping myself
away from it.

1211
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:28,104
Michael...

1212
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:30,363
if not for you...

1213
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:32,386
- then do it at least for her.
- Ashwin sir please.

1214
01:10:32,387 --> 01:10:34,316
He has shot nude
videos of my daughter.

1215
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,921
If she doesn't oblige to him...

1216
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:38,403
he threatens to make it
viral on the internet.

1217
01:10:38,598 --> 01:10:41,536
Grandpa, I even tried complaining
against him to the police.

1218
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:43,786
No one is ready to take action.

1219
01:10:44,285 --> 01:10:47,356
Many girls in my college
are his victims.

1220
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,041
Please grandpa. You must save us.

1221
01:10:58,113 --> 01:10:58,861
Sir.

1222
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:01,666
Evil fellow!

1223
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:04,302
Wonder which girl's life
is he gonna spoil today.

1224
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:06,070
Not bad.

1225
01:11:06,282 --> 01:11:07,313
You agreed immediately.

1226
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:09,671
What else can I do when you
black mail me with my videos.

1227
01:11:09,742 --> 01:11:11,528
Don't worry darling.

1228
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:13,807
You don't have to take any exams.
This is your exam.

1229
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:15,510
If you pass this...

1230
01:11:16,362 --> 01:11:17,783
then I shall award you the degree.

1231
01:11:19,138 --> 01:11:21,003
Why are you praying?

1232
01:11:21,619 --> 01:11:25,213
My mom tells me to pray
before going for the exams.

1233
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,191
Who is that god that's
gonna help you?

1234
01:11:28,286 --> 01:11:30,226
This god shall appear for real!

1235
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:19,462
Madurai!

1236
01:12:19,806 --> 01:12:23,140
Do you know what is the most
cruel punishment in this world?

1237
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:24,013
Forgiveness.

1238
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,149
Even if I forgive you...

1239
01:12:26,526 --> 01:12:27,942
will he forgive you?

1240
01:12:28,107 --> 01:12:30,107
Will he forget?

1241
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:35,870
No Madurai!

1242
01:12:35,997 --> 01:12:37,674
Madurai no! Please no!

1243
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:39,136
Madurai no! No!

1244
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,768
Ok. What's his id?

1245
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:00,885
Search.

1246
01:13:01,612 --> 01:13:03,924
Mam, we have prepared a
sketch based on your inputs.

1247
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,330
Perfect!

1248
01:13:07,138 --> 01:13:09,353
Mail it to all the central
agencies of every country.

1249
01:13:09,796 --> 01:13:11,036
Mainly India, Chennai.

1250
01:13:11,231 --> 01:13:11,840
Why Chennai?

1251
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,874
Chennai is the safest
city in India.

1252
01:13:14,355 --> 01:13:16,183
He could be safely hiding there!

1253
01:13:20,065 --> 01:13:22,676
It's been long since I
had such a hearty laugh.

1254
01:13:23,879 --> 01:13:26,019
I am here to tell you
something important.

1255
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:26,958
Just go ahead.

1256
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:29,324
Look here.

1257
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:31,668
An invitation.

1258
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,992
- Your daughter's marriage?
- Daughter?

1259
01:13:36,026 --> 01:13:37,587
It's my wedding invitation.

1260
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:38,550
What?

1261
01:13:38,897 --> 01:13:40,370
You are getting married?

1262
01:13:40,395 --> 01:13:41,871
After my wife's demise...

1263
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:44,895
I felt I was missing
something in my life.

1264
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,239
Instead of spending on women...

1265
01:13:47,582 --> 01:13:49,582
I thought having a
woman by me....

1266
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:52,547
and it would be good to
give her all my money.

1267
01:13:53,354 --> 01:13:55,203
I put up an ad in the newspaper.

1268
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:57,786
An ad with my name,
address and my status.

1269
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,598
You won't believe it but 150
woman waited for me in a queue.

1270
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:05,762
I interviewed them and finally
selected her, Kavya darling.

1271
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,181
Doesn't the age
difference matter?

1272
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,787
Even the youths are finding it
difficult to get a girl these days.

1273
01:14:11,812 --> 01:14:13,335
We are too old.

1274
01:14:13,363 --> 01:14:14,548
Bro! Listen!

1275
01:14:14,815 --> 01:14:16,843
Haven't you come across
boys who like elder women?

1276
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:20,058
Similarly, some women also
are interested in elder men.

1277
01:14:20,453 --> 01:14:21,586
But once we like them...

1278
01:14:21,784 --> 01:14:24,249
and if someone calls him a grandpa,
I'll ask them to get lost!

1279
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:26,375
I get it. Very nice.

1280
01:14:26,745 --> 01:14:28,639
So, make sure you
attend the wedding.

1281
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:30,611
Ok. Just a moment. Nothing.

1282
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:34,529
All this sounds fine.

1283
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:36,725
How about the spare parts?
Works fine?

1284
01:14:38,018 --> 01:14:41,065
And that is why the god
created the drumsticks!

1285
01:14:43,322 --> 01:14:44,766
You too consume it.

1286
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,020
- So do attend the wedding.
- Ok.

1287
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,178
Come darling.

1288
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,894
Michael, guys just informed me.

1289
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:07,723
Looks like they are here
like a swarm of bees.

1290
01:15:07,874 --> 01:15:09,145
Open the gate!

1291
01:15:09,203 --> 01:15:10,809
Yeah!

1292
01:15:27,749 --> 01:15:30,939
Shankar, I am here right
now for an alliance.

1293
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:33,414
- Look at her mouth
- I'll break your mouth!

1294
01:15:34,634 --> 01:15:36,634
All these women are suitable for you.

1295
01:15:36,726 --> 01:15:39,811
Michael, the beauty doesn't
lie in a woman's face...

1296
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:41,367
Don't you talk about
face and beauty.

1297
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:42,888
Raju!

1298
01:15:43,553 --> 01:15:44,608
Get ready. Come on.

1299
01:15:44,813 --> 01:15:45,757
Hi.

1300
01:15:46,112 --> 01:15:47,230
I'm Mala.

1301
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,050
I'm a divorcee.

1302
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:50,003
Raju no!

1303
01:15:50,389 --> 01:15:51,645
So what if she is a divorcee?

1304
01:15:51,796 --> 01:15:52,840
Who knows what's the issue was?

1305
01:15:52,942 --> 01:15:53,818
Poor lady. Wait.

1306
01:15:54,023 --> 01:15:56,442
So tell me, after
your divorce...

1307
01:15:56,521 --> 01:15:57,982
are you now looking
for an expert?

1308
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:00,281
After I divorced my first husband...

1309
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:02,585
then I divorced Salem Ravi...

1310
01:16:02,857 --> 01:16:04,787
then I divorced Thuthukudi Ravi...

1311
01:16:04,952 --> 01:16:05,891
She is an all rounder!

1312
01:16:05,892 --> 01:16:08,538
I've made a complete round
in all Tamizh Nadu district.

1313
01:16:08,593 --> 01:16:09,499
So you have tasted
all the district!

1314
01:16:09,577 --> 01:16:10,027
Now...

1315
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:11,713
you are next.

1316
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,148
So am I selected?

1317
01:16:13,342 --> 01:16:14,354
How can she even ask that?!

1318
01:16:14,355 --> 01:16:15,695
Ask her to get out first!

1319
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:16,278
Get out.

1320
01:16:16,578 --> 01:16:17,028
Next.

1321
01:16:17,295 --> 01:16:19,070
I had a boyfriend in school.

1322
01:16:19,398 --> 01:16:20,390
Then we broke up.

1323
01:16:20,555 --> 01:16:22,062
Then I had a boyfriend
in the 12th grade.

1324
01:16:22,088 --> 01:16:22,772
Then we broke up.

1325
01:16:22,773 --> 01:16:25,734
Now, in college, I'm involved
with a guy for the past 3 years.

1326
01:16:25,735 --> 01:16:27,367
He doesn't trust me and
keeps doubting me.

1327
01:16:27,491 --> 01:16:31,112
He keeps me from going to pubs and smoking.
Hence I've decided to break up with him.

1328
01:16:31,306 --> 01:16:33,993
Now, I wish to marry this old man
and live my life on my own terms.

1329
01:16:34,018 --> 01:16:34,815
No please.

1330
01:16:35,147 --> 01:16:35,746
Get out!

1331
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:36,776
I am very strict!

1332
01:16:37,588 --> 01:16:38,516
I can see that.

1333
01:16:38,596 --> 01:16:41,430
No whiskey or brandy
for my husband.

1334
01:16:42,126 --> 01:16:43,601
No beer or rum.

1335
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:44,673
That's it.

1336
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:45,829
Only vodka!

1337
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,001
Why only vodka?

1338
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:48,220
That's my favorite.

1339
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:49,222
Get out!

1340
01:16:49,711 --> 01:16:50,161
Next!

1341
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,461
What's his name?

1342
01:16:53,578 --> 01:16:54,164
Ashwin.

1343
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:54,755
Age?

1344
01:16:54,803 --> 01:16:56,227
58.

1345
01:16:56,334 --> 01:16:57,139
Wont' work out.

1346
01:16:57,165 --> 01:16:57,889
Why?

1347
01:16:58,109 --> 01:16:59,380
I wonder if he can or cannot!

1348
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,354
How dare you talk
about him like that?!

1349
01:17:02,379 --> 01:17:04,379
Our man, he is the king!

1350
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:06,024
I feel like abusing!

1351
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:07,927
No chicken, no mutton, no fish.

1352
01:17:08,036 --> 01:17:08,918
Are you a vegetarian?

1353
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:10,567
- I'm Rita!
- Shut up!

1354
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:12,303
We stand for Jallikattu!

1355
01:17:12,481 --> 01:17:14,153
We are Tamizhan! Get lost!

1356
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:15,028
Raju!

1357
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,122
Stop the nonsense!

1358
01:17:20,433 --> 01:17:21,817
Here comes a last entrant.

1359
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:24,193
Hey, looks like there is a last entrant.

1360
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:25,496
Lets check it out.

1361
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,577
I’ve had enough!

1362
01:17:28,026 --> 01:17:29,893
Istanbul!

1363
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:32,382
Hi!

1364
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:33,891
You must see her.

1365
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:35,031
Something like...

1366
01:17:35,066 --> 01:17:36,251
Bahubali!

1367
01:17:36,307 --> 01:17:38,307
Look, she is very shiny!

1368
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:43,295
I am coming.

1369
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:44,918
Wait!

1370
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:46,347
Oh! Oh!

1371
01:17:46,723 --> 01:17:47,605
Please.

1372
01:17:51,321 --> 01:17:51,962
Hi.

1373
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:53,245
Wow! Wow! Wow!

1374
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:57,228
Listen, I finally
watched Bahubali!

1375
01:17:57,645 --> 01:17:58,544
Did you watch it?

1376
01:17:58,569 --> 01:17:59,941
I am watching it right now!

1377
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,127
Select her!

1378
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,596
Ok.

1379
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:05,227
Shall we start?

1380
01:18:05,252 --> 01:18:06,275
I am Ramya.

1381
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:07,704
I saw the ad in the paper.

1382
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,453
She is awesome.

1383
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,624
Ok!

1384
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:11,459
Ok dear.

1385
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,601
How old are you?

1386
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,730
Age? Legal enough
to get married

1387
01:18:16,645 --> 01:18:18,428
Look at her laugh

1388
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,362
So tell me...

1389
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,435
is it ok to be with an old man?
Hope you have no problems.

1390
01:18:22,704 --> 01:18:24,845
It's not such a vast
difference if you see.

1391
01:18:25,064 --> 01:18:26,439
Such things happen a lot abroad.

1392
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:27,907
Last question.

1393
01:18:29,056 --> 01:18:32,838
Are you doing this to inherit his wealth?
Just a small doubt.

1394
01:18:33,078 --> 01:18:35,078
We have enough wealth.

1395
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,150
He just has to come dressed up.

1396
01:18:37,332 --> 01:18:38,368
With or without shirt?

1397
01:18:38,543 --> 01:18:40,502
Raju, don't let her go.

1398
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:42,650
Select her.

1399
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:43,516
Forget it.

1400
01:18:43,664 --> 01:18:44,874
If you have such doubts...

1401
01:18:45,413 --> 01:18:46,022
I'm leaving.

1402
01:18:46,117 --> 01:18:47,366
Sorry dear. Sorry dear.

1403
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:49,516
Come on let's fix the
marriage right away!

1404
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:52,510
Are you sure?

1405
01:18:52,636 --> 01:18:54,898
- Hope you won't have any doubts further.
- No at all.

1406
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:56,223
Thank you god.

1407
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:57,615
Fix it!

1408
01:18:58,122 --> 01:18:59,090
I hope you won't
change your decision.

1409
01:18:59,115 --> 01:19:00,629
Promise. We won't!

1410
01:19:00,879 --> 01:19:02,246
No exchange the love!

1411
01:19:03,303 --> 01:19:05,303
Sarala madam, you may come in.

1412
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:19,383
Who is this Manorama?

1413
01:19:19,409 --> 01:19:21,086
She is my hottie, Sarala.

1414
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:23,888
Actually, she is
also a bit shy type.

1415
01:19:23,913 --> 01:19:25,563
Which is why I spoke
on behalf of her.

1416
01:19:25,589 --> 01:19:26,399
So everything is fine?

1417
01:19:27,253 --> 01:19:28,899
Wait. Wait . Wait Ramya.

1418
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,964
I haven't seen the groom yet.

1419
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:32,149
I wanna see him.

1420
01:19:32,204 --> 01:19:34,207
It must be love at first sight.

1421
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:35,786
- For that you must be alive.
- What?

1422
01:19:35,848 --> 01:19:36,720
No! No! No!

1423
01:19:36,863 --> 01:19:38,853
Tell them that the groom
is out of station.

1424
01:19:39,095 --> 01:19:41,259
Groom will return next week.
He is out of station.

1425
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:42,509
You may leave now.

1426
01:19:42,534 --> 01:19:45,125
No! No! No! Why?

1427
01:19:45,497 --> 01:19:47,945
Why would you cheat
young girls like us?

1428
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,838
The curse of virgin girls'
will follow you forever!

1429
01:19:52,033 --> 01:19:54,033
First, chase away
that old woman!

1430
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,119
Ramya!

1431
01:19:55,315 --> 01:19:55,885
Come on.

1432
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:58,144
- Come on Sarala, we shall find you another groom.
- No!

1433
01:19:59,812 --> 01:20:00,710
Damn it.

1434
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,995
Her name is Ramya.

1435
01:20:15,294 --> 01:20:16,859
Age: 26.

1436
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:19,094
So far, she had a
boyfriend in school.

1437
01:20:19,289 --> 01:20:20,249
Then one in college.

1438
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:21,778
The point to be noted here is...

1439
01:20:22,145 --> 01:20:24,161
When in school, she fell in
love with a college boy.

1440
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:26,821
When in college, she fell in
love with a boy who was working.

1441
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,268
What do you observe from this?

1442
01:20:28,269 --> 01:20:31,402
She likes boys who are elder than her.

1443
01:20:31,519 --> 01:20:33,715
So definitely I have a chance.

1444
01:20:34,011 --> 01:20:36,011
Then, her favorite movie...

1445
01:20:36,137 --> 01:20:37,359
Vinnaithandi  Varuvaya.

1446
01:20:37,384 --> 01:20:38,452
The movie she hates...

1447
01:20:38,803 --> 01:20:40,991
Trisha illena Nayanthara.

1448
01:20:41,561 --> 01:20:43,016
Then she is a good girl.

1449
01:20:43,165 --> 01:20:45,165
She respects the old people.

1450
01:20:45,356 --> 01:20:46,359
When she was a child...

1451
01:20:46,516 --> 01:20:48,109
she lost her grand parents.

1452
01:20:48,657 --> 01:20:49,107
But...

1453
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:51,515
she takes care of an old age home.

1454
01:20:52,952 --> 01:20:56,158
When these modern women wander
around in pubs and clubs...

1455
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:59,784
there are a few like
her still out there.

1456
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:01,980
Yes. Along with the old age members...

1457
01:21:02,186 --> 01:21:03,890
Ramya will be coming here today.

1458
01:21:04,215 --> 01:21:05,207
So...

1459
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,881
how did you collect all these
information within a night?

1460
01:21:09,918 --> 01:21:12,483
Her house maid, Kamini...

1461
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:15,073
good company.

1462
01:21:15,098 --> 01:21:17,388
I'll throw this on your face!

1463
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:21,046
Michael!

1464
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:23,361
She is here along with
the old age home members.

1465
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:29,334
There is my girl!

1466
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,169
Got the tickets. Come on!
Let's go.

1467
01:22:06,194 --> 01:22:08,194
What are you doing over there.
Come on.

1468
01:22:28,085 --> 01:22:29,199
You be careful!

1469
01:22:29,387 --> 01:22:31,605
Let me go with Ramya.

1470
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:33,680
Move! Move!

1471
01:22:33,972 --> 01:22:36,204
Catch her!

1472
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:38,706
Catch her! Now that you
have caught her, leave her!

1473
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,005
Sarala are you alright?

1474
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:43,401
Why is she laughing?

1475
01:22:43,678 --> 01:22:45,678
- Sir? Hello?
- O +ve??

1476
01:22:45,703 --> 01:22:46,672
Ok. Ok, I'll be there.

1477
01:22:46,697 --> 01:22:49,111
- You look familiar.
- You look strange!

1478
01:22:50,586 --> 01:22:53,360
Sarala, I need to go to the
blood bank immediately.

1479
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,385
You guys watch the movie.
Screen 3. Yeah.

1480
01:22:55,788 --> 01:22:58,140
Ok. Sorry dear. Ok, bye.

1481
01:22:58,476 --> 01:23:00,978
Bye, see you. Bye.

1482
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:05,892
Looks like some emergency.

1483
01:23:21,051 --> 01:23:21,879
Bye.

1484
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:24,059
Tata.

1485
01:23:25,387 --> 01:23:27,387
- You! Damn it!
- Wait!

1486
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:28,183
Who are you?

1487
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,504
What's your name?

1488
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,096
- My name is Ashwin.
- Ashwin?

1489
01:23:32,135 --> 01:23:34,672
Ashwin? That groom who conducted
interview, that Ashwin?

1490
01:23:34,698 --> 01:23:36,244
- Yeah!
- You look so handsome!

1491
01:23:36,365 --> 01:23:38,795
- Whoa.
- What do you do Ashwin?

1492
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,362
- Now? Nothing.
- No...

1493
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:42,126
I mean your profession.

1494
01:23:43,188 --> 01:23:44,385
Teacher. Teacher.

1495
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:47,313
Teacher? Which subject?
Maths, Physics, Chemistry?

1496
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:49,399
What teacher are you?

1497
01:23:49,805 --> 01:23:52,787
Yo...Yo...Yoga teacher.

1498
01:23:52,812 --> 01:23:54,411
- Wow!
- Look, he just mimicked you.

1499
01:23:54,412 --> 01:23:56,552
That is why you appear so young.

1500
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,567
Your arms are really good.

1501
01:23:58,669 --> 01:24:00,240
Control your emotions Sarala!

1502
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:02,368
How did you become a part
of our old age group?

1503
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:03,783
What a silly question?

1504
01:24:03,892 --> 01:24:07,744
His son would have go married and kicked him
out because of his daughter-in-law said so.

1505
01:24:07,853 --> 01:24:10,477
- Am I correct?
- Wonderful!

1506
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:12,055
We are missing something.

1507
01:24:12,109 --> 01:24:15,060
Nothing is missing anywhere.
Only I am missing him already.

1508
01:24:15,085 --> 01:24:17,428
Come, let's watch
the movie together.

1509
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:18,053
Come on.

1510
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:19,990
First she held him and
now she is holding him.

1511
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:21,663
He attracts everyone of them!

1512
01:24:21,952 --> 01:24:23,733
- Hello.
- Hello buddy, Neeru here.

1513
01:24:24,055 --> 01:24:25,906
Buddy we have a small plan.

1514
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:26,812
Tell me buddy.

1515
01:24:27,007 --> 01:24:28,187
At midnight around 12:30

1516
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,031
We are going to Ramya's home.

1517
01:24:30,117 --> 01:24:30,859
To Ramya's home?

1518
01:24:31,054 --> 01:24:31,843
What's the matter?

1519
01:24:32,062 --> 01:24:32,937
Kamini!

1520
01:24:34,404 --> 01:24:35,235
What are you up to?

1521
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,096
I'm chatting.

1522
01:24:36,339 --> 01:24:38,056
You fool. Where is your dress?

1523
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:39,626
Post 10 p.m this is how I chat.

1524
01:24:39,919 --> 01:24:41,846
- Close the door and leave!
- Go sleep!

1525
01:24:43,434 --> 01:24:45,796
I just saw something strange.
So tell me, why?

1526
01:24:45,817 --> 01:24:48,382
It's her birthday.

1527
01:24:49,012 --> 01:24:49,793
Birthday?

1528
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:51,631
We shall give her a surprise...

1529
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:53,216
and cut a cake for her.

1530
01:24:53,536 --> 01:24:56,192
Ok. Share me the location.

1531
01:24:56,317 --> 01:24:57,091
I'll be there.

1532
01:24:57,091 --> 01:24:58,669
I shall share the location...

1533
01:24:59,075 --> 01:24:59,872
and you...

1534
01:25:00,356 --> 01:25:03,215
please share me that
Sunny Leone video.

1535
01:25:03,452 --> 01:25:04,731
Look at that now!

1536
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:06,206
I shall.

1537
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:08,910
What are you going to do
watching those videos?

1538
01:25:16,353 --> 01:25:17,611
Now I get it...

1539
01:25:18,275 --> 01:25:22,176
why girls fall for him
even though he is so old.

1540
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:25,503
When he does Yoga or
recites slokas...

1541
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:26,967
what a style!

1542
01:25:26,992 --> 01:25:27,442
Sarala!

1543
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:28,668
No!

1544
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:31,394
Swami! I want him!

1545
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:32,919
He is famous for biting lips.

1546
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:35,907
I am famous for making
my wishes come true.

1547
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:37,990
He is Simbhu's fan.

1548
01:25:38,015 --> 01:25:40,108
I am Nayanthara's fan!

1549
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,883
You just won't let it go!

1550
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:44,970
If I let it go now then when will I
ever have it? It'll be my end then.

1551
01:25:45,382 --> 01:25:47,241
Hope that end comes soon.

1552
01:26:04,121 --> 01:26:05,493
Neeru grandpa!

1553
01:26:05,564 --> 01:26:07,509
I am here and you are
searching there?

1554
01:26:07,548 --> 01:26:08,517
Swami sir.

1555
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,105
I am here.

1556
01:26:11,407 --> 01:26:12,557
Don't touch.

1557
01:26:12,604 --> 01:26:13,838
Manohar bro?

1558
01:26:13,909 --> 01:26:15,589
I am here.

1559
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,760
And now I am there.

1560
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,963
Then who is it?

1561
01:26:22,834 --> 01:26:23,774
Grandpa...

1562
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:25,892
I don't remember your name.

1563
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:29,014
How will you? If a girl must
remember a person's name...

1564
01:26:29,193 --> 01:26:32,391
then he must have done something special.
He didn't do anything like that.

1565
01:26:32,461 --> 01:26:33,930
- Shut up!
- Heavy feeling.

1566
01:26:34,024 --> 01:26:35,477
Grandpa actually....

1567
01:26:35,502 --> 01:26:36,832
Wait, let me come over here.

1568
01:26:36,978 --> 01:26:38,070
You come here.

1569
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:39,132
You come here.

1570
01:26:39,132 --> 01:26:40,343
At least you come!

1571
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:43,837
- Please cut the cake.
- Yes, please do it.

1572
01:26:44,476 --> 01:26:46,946
Happy birthday to you.

1573
01:26:46,946 --> 01:26:50,190
Happy birthday to you.

1574
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,305
Grandpa, here.

1575
01:26:53,306 --> 01:26:54,836
- Sarala mam.
- No, I’m on diet.

1576
01:26:54,862 --> 01:26:55,416
Grandpa...

1577
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,830
wait, I'll give him.

1578
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,250
- Hi, hello, open.
- Supni sir.

1579
01:27:04,265 --> 01:27:05,499
Open your mouth.

1580
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:07,420
Are you gonna feed me?

1581
01:27:07,445 --> 01:27:08,945
Look at that! Eww!

1582
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:10,183
- Please have it.
- Super dear.

1583
01:27:10,406 --> 01:27:13,432
Buddy Ashwin, didn't you
stay up all night...

1584
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:15,698
- and make something?
- What did he make?

1585
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:16,815
I mean the gift!

1586
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:18,557
- Take that.
- Here.

1587
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:19,296
For me?

1588
01:27:19,695 --> 01:27:24,109
Ashwin, you got a gift
for her but not for me?

1589
01:27:24,211 --> 01:27:26,539
Whose birthday is it?
Her birthday right?

1590
01:27:26,656 --> 01:27:28,493
- yes you are right.
- Shall I open it.

1591
01:27:28,696 --> 01:27:29,750
Please.

1592
01:27:40,582 --> 01:27:41,308
Wow!

1593
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:54,773
You accepted all of them at the old age home as your
grand parents because you miss your grand parents.

1594
01:27:56,343 --> 01:28:01,033
So I thought it would be great if you can be
with them in a photo.

1595
01:28:01,211 --> 01:28:02,908
Hence the art work.

1596
01:28:03,272 --> 01:28:04,692
He knows very well how to woo.

1597
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:07,154
I am artist myself yet...

1598
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:12,648
I felt bad for not having their photo
but this idea never occurred to me.

1599
01:28:13,648 --> 01:28:15,627
Awesome grandpa!

1600
01:28:19,134 --> 01:28:20,048
Ashwin grandpa.

1601
01:28:20,748 --> 01:28:24,187
I will never ever forget
you or your name!

1602
01:28:24,212 --> 01:28:25,416
Thank you.

1603
01:28:26,517 --> 01:28:27,757
Superb!

1604
01:28:27,968 --> 01:28:29,541
Did you hear that doofus?

1605
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:30,856
- See you.
- Bye.

1606
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,824
Jealous?

1607
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:35,552
He is a raging fire.

1608
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:36,833
You are lost.

1609
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,732
So nice!

1610
01:28:43,784 --> 01:28:47,105
I want Ashwin grandpa's
phone number.

1611
01:29:42,732 --> 01:29:46,422
You seem to be liking
old actors more.

1612
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:48,747
What about the latest heroes
like Siva Karthikeyan,

1613
01:29:49,013 --> 01:29:50,187
G V Prakash,

1614
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:51,287
Nivin Pauly,

1615
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,990
don't you like them?

1616
01:29:53,974 --> 01:29:55,810
- Come on dad! Let it go.
- Let it go where?

1617
01:30:09,717 --> 01:30:12,546
Ramya, please come and meet
the boy at least once.

1618
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:15,987
We both are of same age.

1619
01:30:16,731 --> 01:30:18,872
Hence, it won't workout.

1620
01:30:20,518 --> 01:30:21,442
Why?

1621
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:22,367
You...

1622
01:30:22,633 --> 01:30:24,664
- don't have wrinkles.
- No wrinkles?

1623
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,858
Your hair isn't grey.

1624
01:30:27,959 --> 01:30:29,613
At this age?

1625
01:30:29,684 --> 01:30:31,890
- You have a baby face.
- Baby face?

1626
01:30:33,943 --> 01:30:35,164
Tamannah! Tamannah!

1627
01:30:36,212 --> 01:30:36,662
Sir...

1628
01:30:37,089 --> 01:30:39,482
search a groom for your
daughter at an old age home!

1629
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:05,227
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1630
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:07,424
Sir, please explain us
your journey so far.

1631
01:31:08,205 --> 01:31:10,088
I struggled a lot
during my childhood.

1632
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:12,714
I had starved for days.

1633
01:31:12,854 --> 01:31:14,689
Finally, I approached a
beauty parlor for a job.

1634
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:18,112
The owner lady made it clear
that she won't hire male staffs.

1635
01:31:18,315 --> 01:31:20,175
She sad 'Only ladies'
and chased me away.

1636
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:21,271
I gave it a thought.

1637
01:31:21,296 --> 01:31:25,623
I turned myself into a beautiful woman and
applied for a job in the same beauty parlor.

1638
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:27,027
She too me in immediately.

1639
01:31:27,183 --> 01:31:31,670
Avvai Shanmugi, Dasaavatharam,
Chandramukhi....infact the great Bahubali,

1640
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:32,646
I worked as the make up
man in all these movie.

1641
01:31:32,671 --> 01:31:33,121
Really?

1642
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:36,449
My aim is to use my talent
in make up skills and...

1643
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:38,778
turn a small boy in to a very old man.

1644
01:31:39,355 --> 01:31:41,199
And turn an old man
into a small boy.

1645
01:31:41,568 --> 01:31:45,692
What's with him? He says he can convert
a man to woman and woman to man!

1646
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:47,444
Its impossible to believe.

1647
01:31:47,469 --> 01:31:51,598
Let him turn anything
into anything!

1648
01:31:51,623 --> 01:31:53,984
We must just go watch the
show and enjoy if it's good.

1649
01:31:54,054 --> 01:31:54,741
Got it?

1650
01:31:54,898 --> 01:31:56,163
- Watch now.
- Forget it.

1651
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,990
You love Ramya...

1652
01:31:58,632 --> 01:32:01,036
Is it for lust or...

1653
01:32:01,123 --> 01:32:05,268
do you really love her?
Just a small doubt.

1654
01:32:05,832 --> 01:32:10,333
We have done enough of lustful activities,
now we are old and have settled...

1655
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:12,350
This is true love!

1656
01:32:12,418 --> 01:32:13,355
I don't believe it.

1657
01:32:13,587 --> 01:32:14,766
I didn't ask you.

1658
01:32:14,931 --> 01:32:16,408
- Sorry dear.
- Shut up dear

1659
01:32:16,549 --> 01:32:18,642
Lust sparks in the brain.

1660
01:32:19,556 --> 01:32:22,016
Love sparks in heart.

1661
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,614
You don't have a heart,
then how would I explain?

1662
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:25,469
Forget it.

1663
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:28,566
- Let me test it. Shall we try it.
- How do we do it?

1664
01:32:29,662 --> 01:32:30,857
Now, watch me.

1665
01:32:30,882 --> 01:32:32,676
- What are you doing?
- Wait and watch.

1666
01:32:33,537 --> 01:32:34,183
Hey!

1667
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:36,319
I gave her a miss call.

1668
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,160
Now she will call me back!

1669
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:40,792
That is why I gave
her a miss call.

1670
01:32:41,035 --> 01:32:42,651
- You!
- Now, give me that...

1671
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,126
I'll place it here.

1672
01:32:45,194 --> 01:32:46,354
And then I'll place it here.

1673
01:32:46,906 --> 01:32:49,412
I'll alternate between
here and here.

1674
01:32:49,584 --> 01:32:51,404
I'll place my fist on your face!
Why are you doing this?

1675
01:32:51,429 --> 01:32:52,374
Good question.

1676
01:32:53,127 --> 01:32:55,470
If she calls when
I place it here,

1677
01:32:55,665 --> 01:32:57,501
then your love is lustful.

1678
01:32:58,063 --> 01:33:00,704
If she calls when
I place it here,

1679
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:03,689
then that means your
love is divine.

1680
01:33:03,714 --> 01:33:05,480
That's awesome!

1681
01:33:05,923 --> 01:33:07,782
I'll deal with you later.

1682
01:33:08,029 --> 01:33:09,468
- Sorry buddy.
- Now what's your problem?

1683
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:11,396
You want to test my love. Right?

1684
01:33:11,421 --> 01:33:12,762
Yes, exactly. Ok?

1685
01:33:13,703 --> 01:33:14,664
Go ahead. Check.

1686
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:18,519
I'm placing it here,
she hasn't called.

1687
01:33:18,646 --> 01:33:21,253
- And now I'm placing it here.
- What kind of magic is this?

1688
01:33:33,725 --> 01:33:34,397
Hi grandpa.

1689
01:33:34,514 --> 01:33:36,384
- Tell me Ramya.
- Are you free tomorrow?

1690
01:33:36,508 --> 01:33:37,437
I'll make myself free.

1691
01:33:37,462 --> 01:33:40,300
Usually I go to the
market with my father.

1692
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:41,868
But dad is out of station now.

1693
01:33:42,657 --> 01:33:46,655
Don't you know that if I go alone
then the shopkeepers will trick me.

1694
01:33:47,031 --> 01:33:48,415
Yes. They will.

1695
01:33:48,631 --> 01:33:49,913
You are a small innocent girl...

1696
01:33:50,178 --> 01:33:51,952
the shopkeepers will
easily trick you.

1697
01:33:52,186 --> 01:33:54,895
- So...
- So, I shall join you and...

1698
01:33:55,092 --> 01:33:58,535
with great care, I shall
help you to buy groceries.

1699
01:33:59,373 --> 01:34:01,176
- Great.
- Wonderful!

1700
01:34:07,302 --> 01:34:08,457
Did you see the video
I sent on whatsapp

1701
01:34:08,971 --> 01:34:09,794
Have I watched it yet?

1702
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:11,519
Check this video.

1703
01:34:11,799 --> 01:34:13,151
It's top class.

1704
01:34:13,176 --> 01:34:15,025
- Show me.
- It'll change your mood!

1705
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:15,751
Is it?

1706
01:34:16,744 --> 01:34:17,387
What is it?

1707
01:34:17,412 --> 01:34:18,364
I saw a girl on my way.

1708
01:34:18,579 --> 01:34:20,681
- A girl?
- She has an awesome rack.

1709
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:21,881
Wow!

1710
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,929
Whoever touches, will
be a lucky man.

1711
01:34:33,818 --> 01:34:35,521
Buddy, that could be her father.

1712
01:34:36,293 --> 01:34:39,692
He looks very weak and old.
Why are you worried?

1713
01:34:39,973 --> 01:34:41,604
Is she here with her father?

1714
01:34:41,629 --> 01:34:42,754
Looks like her grandpa.

1715
01:34:42,957 --> 01:34:44,616
Buddy, easy peasy target.

1716
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:45,702
Come on.

1717
01:34:45,703 --> 01:34:48,583
- Come on. Get in the car.
- Quick.

1718
01:34:55,292 --> 01:34:56,396
How dare you?

1719
01:34:57,965 --> 01:34:59,137
What? Is she reacting?

1720
01:35:00,011 --> 01:35:01,644
What is it oldie?
Got upset is it?

1721
01:35:01,895 --> 01:35:03,476
Is she your grand child?

1722
01:35:04,984 --> 01:35:05,960
Is she your daughter?

1723
01:35:07,178 --> 01:35:08,561
Or is she your lover?

1724
01:35:09,624 --> 01:35:10,608
Indeed!

1725
01:35:11,633 --> 01:35:13,094
Indeed?

1726
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:14,791
Did she just say indeed?

1727
01:35:14,816 --> 01:35:17,058
Instead of cheap
skates like you...

1728
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:20,279
it is better to fall in love with a
grandpa who defends a helpless girl.

1729
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:23,990
Hey, we better leave.
She is pissed off.

1730
01:35:24,839 --> 01:35:26,100
They must be punished!

1731
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:33,303
Now drive!

1732
01:35:35,473 --> 01:35:36,324
What's happening?

1733
01:35:38,465 --> 01:35:39,290
What's going on?

1734
01:35:41,117 --> 01:35:41,567
You oldie!

1735
01:35:42,023 --> 01:35:43,578
Let go off the car!

1736
01:35:43,617 --> 01:35:45,234
Let go grand pa!

1737
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:49,818
Grandpa please forgive us.
Please forgive us.

1738
01:35:50,088 --> 01:35:51,487
Apologize!

1739
01:35:51,534 --> 01:35:52,776
Sorry grandpa.

1740
01:35:52,801 --> 01:35:54,161
Not to me but to her!

1741
01:35:54,424 --> 01:35:55,776
Sister! Sorry sister.

1742
01:35:55,854 --> 01:35:57,487
Please ask him to let
go off the car sister.

1743
01:35:57,672 --> 01:35:59,128
Superb!

1744
01:36:12,922 --> 01:36:14,480
Youths gotta be responsible...

1745
01:36:14,714 --> 01:36:16,123
and not be cheap skates!

1746
01:36:16,324 --> 01:36:17,596
Youths must be disciplined...

1747
01:36:17,597 --> 01:36:18,839
and shouldn't booze and drive!

1748
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:20,113
Youths must be patient...

1749
01:36:20,182 --> 01:36:22,473
and must not make moves on
girl without her permission.

1750
01:36:22,529 --> 01:36:24,224
Overall, youths must be...

1751
01:36:25,193 --> 01:36:26,693
youthful!

1752
01:36:26,982 --> 01:36:27,774
Got it?

1753
01:36:28,912 --> 01:36:30,303
I'll turn you into ashes!

1754
01:36:43,827 --> 01:36:45,390
What happened Sarala?

1755
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:47,632
He did it. He did it!

1756
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:48,527
He did it?

1757
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:52,184
Come on now! I meant this
baldie here did this to my leg!

1758
01:36:52,209 --> 01:36:55,933
How did both of you meet with
accidents at the same time?

1759
01:36:56,635 --> 01:37:02,549
Even after I repeatedly refused, he didn't
obey me. He took me for a ride on his bike!

1760
01:37:02,798 --> 01:37:05,109
That was the wonderful moment.

1761
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:36,897
I asked him to go away!

1762
01:38:36,958 --> 01:38:41,485
But this fellow kept singing "don't go
away!" and rammed the bike into the truck!

1763
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:42,673
Don't blame me for that.

1764
01:38:43,011 --> 01:38:44,745
It's Gautham Vasudev Menon.

1765
01:38:44,974 --> 01:38:46,614
Forget that Sarala.

1766
01:38:46,729 --> 01:38:49,190
- Where is Ramya?
- How would I know?

1767
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:52,164
Could she be out with
Ashwin, in a coffee shop?

1768
01:38:52,281 --> 01:38:54,033
Feelings of Sarala!

1769
01:38:55,025 --> 01:38:55,475
Priya...

1770
01:38:56,846 --> 01:39:00,092
is been 3 years since
we fell in love.

1771
01:39:00,858 --> 01:39:01,819
We haven't ...

1772
01:39:01,913 --> 01:39:04,053
- our relationship to the next level.
- Sir, coffee.

1773
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,216
Next level?

1774
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,875
You mean that?

1775
01:39:10,047 --> 01:39:11,344
Well, all that after marriage.

1776
01:39:11,594 --> 01:39:12,413
What do you mean?

1777
01:39:12,414 --> 01:39:14,672
After marriage? But you did
do it with you ex Harish?

1778
01:39:14,945 --> 01:39:16,347
Do I look like a fool?

1779
01:39:17,238 --> 01:39:18,784
With him I felt it.

1780
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,646
I haven't felt it yet with you.
That's it.

1781
01:39:21,761 --> 01:39:23,969
You won't feel doing this but
you are ok with drinking?!

1782
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:25,454
So are you!

1783
01:39:26,532 --> 01:39:28,337
Why do you have to compete
with boys always.

1784
01:39:28,454 --> 01:39:29,767
You should not drink here after.

1785
01:39:39,085 --> 01:39:40,585
Stop creating such scene!

1786
01:39:40,782 --> 01:39:42,345
Try something new!

1787
01:39:43,129 --> 01:39:44,082
New?

1788
01:39:45,226 --> 01:39:46,948
- Wait and watch!
- Ok.

1789
01:39:47,486 --> 01:39:48,384
Get lost!

1790
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,290
Hi.

1791
01:39:50,552 --> 01:39:51,002
Hi.

1792
01:39:51,138 --> 01:39:51,588
Hi.

1793
01:39:51,724 --> 01:39:53,981
Sorry but none of the
tables are free here.

1794
01:39:54,153 --> 01:39:55,942
Aren't you alone? Can we sit here?

1795
01:39:57,137 --> 01:39:57,980
I'm not alone here.

1796
01:39:58,129 --> 01:40:00,629
This is the first time I have
brought my boyfriend out.

1797
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:02,239
That's why I am asking.

1798
01:40:02,829 --> 01:40:04,469
I am also here with my boyfriend.

1799
01:40:04,704 --> 01:40:06,165
Where is your boyfriend?

1800
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:07,584
There!

1801
01:40:12,386 --> 01:40:13,354
Grandpa boyfriend?

1802
01:40:13,471 --> 01:40:15,041
- Let's escape!
- Run!

1803
01:40:17,487 --> 01:40:18,768
Sorry, got a bit delayed.

1804
01:40:19,182 --> 01:40:22,679
Just now a couple were indecently
kissing in the neighboring table.

1805
01:40:23,781 --> 01:40:25,667
I wonder how could they
act like that in public.

1806
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:28,820
Come on. Chennai is slowly
turning into London.

1807
01:40:28,845 --> 01:40:29,914
It's a development.

1808
01:40:30,349 --> 01:40:32,146
Kissing in the public,

1809
01:40:32,364 --> 01:40:33,543
then hugging in the public,

1810
01:40:33,568 --> 01:40:34,680
it's so weird.

1811
01:40:34,844 --> 01:40:36,727
Arrgh! I don't like
all this grandpa.

1812
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:38,961
She talks like she
is from stone age!

1813
01:40:40,742 --> 01:40:41,192
Well, no...

1814
01:40:41,429 --> 01:40:43,158
how that works is...

1815
01:40:43,228 --> 01:40:45,532
some couple plan and kiss.

1816
01:40:45,557 --> 01:40:47,268
But for some couple
it happens naturally.

1817
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:49,049
It just happens.

1818
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:50,548
How does it happen naturally?

1819
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,769
Well, how do I explain?

1820
01:40:52,982 --> 01:40:56,612
When lovers look into each
others eyes for 10 seconds...

1821
01:40:56,754 --> 01:40:59,059
- then automatically...
- What does this mean?

1822
01:40:59,574 --> 01:41:02,111
- It means they automatically kiss each other.
- Is it?

1823
01:41:03,338 --> 01:41:03,853
Fine...

1824
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:06,276
- Let's try it.
- Try it?

1825
01:41:06,759 --> 01:41:07,209
With me?

1826
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:09,002
With our eyes.

1827
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:12,295
No way. I was just saying
it just like that.

1828
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:14,507
Come on grandpa, it's not
like I am gonna kiss you.

1829
01:41:14,508 --> 01:41:16,686
- Come let's try.
- I'm being nice.

1830
01:41:17,013 --> 01:41:19,138
Guess, she won't let me be.

1831
01:41:20,438 --> 01:41:21,810
Something is gonna happen.

1832
01:41:22,757 --> 01:41:23,944
1,2 and 3!

1833
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:30,870
Nothing happened.

1834
01:41:32,362 --> 01:41:33,464
Nothing is happening.

1835
01:41:33,862 --> 01:41:35,471
If you keep talking,
nothing will happen.

1836
01:41:35,815 --> 01:41:36,705
Be silent.

1837
01:41:37,088 --> 01:41:37,538
Nothing...

1838
01:41:44,045 --> 01:41:45,403
Who is that kissing
in the public?

1839
01:41:45,405 --> 01:41:46,319
Listen! Don't jump!

1840
01:41:47,657 --> 01:41:48,454
Hey!

1841
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:50,011
I am going to suicide.

1842
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:52,275
Don't shout!

1843
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,589
Let her hear me out.

1844
01:41:54,306 --> 01:41:56,882
You told me try something new!
I am going to jump from here.

1845
01:41:57,351 --> 01:41:59,261
- Get down!
- Only if I die you'll realize!

1846
01:42:00,586 --> 01:42:01,906
Where did grandpa go?

1847
01:42:02,109 --> 01:42:03,117
Hey you suicide boy!

1848
01:42:03,406 --> 01:42:04,477
Are you ready to jump?

1849
01:42:04,966 --> 01:42:07,349
Grandpa, don't near me!
Or else I'll jump!

1850
01:42:07,513 --> 01:42:09,458
I am pretty much
here to do that.

1851
01:42:09,778 --> 01:42:13,352
Look how many of them are waiting. Stop
talking. When are you going to jump?

1852
01:42:14,602 --> 01:42:16,501
Excuse me, isn't that
grandpa with you?

1853
01:42:16,773 --> 01:42:18,851
- Yes.
- He just climbed up the roof using the pipe!

1854
01:42:18,896 --> 01:42:20,435
- Where is he?
- Look there not here!

1855
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,225
There. See that?

1856
01:42:21,225 --> 01:42:22,022
What is your problem?

1857
01:42:22,046 --> 01:42:24,444
Grandpa, I love her sincerely.

1858
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:26,337
But she is cheating me.

1859
01:42:26,662 --> 01:42:27,932
Then death is for sure!

1860
01:42:28,298 --> 01:42:30,845
If death is the solution
when a girl cheats...

1861
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:33,838
then no boy or men would
be alive in Tamizh Nadu!

1862
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,864
- I haven't even touched her.
- Whoa!

1863
01:42:37,255 --> 01:42:39,169
Being born as virgin
isn't our mistake.

1864
01:42:39,365 --> 01:42:41,692
But to die a virgin
is out mistake!

1865
01:42:41,976 --> 01:42:47,091
If you die without having any pleasures of this world, the
you soul will never rest in peace. Enjoy before you go!

1866
01:42:47,178 --> 01:42:48,551
Know this...

1867
01:42:48,778 --> 01:42:51,075
If you advice a girl not to drink,

1868
01:42:51,276 --> 01:42:53,198
then she will drink
more than you.

1869
01:42:53,281 --> 01:42:56,025
If you advice her not to wear a dress
then she'll opt for an even worse dress.

1870
01:42:56,112 --> 01:42:58,884
Stop her from talking to a guy,
she will go talk to 10 others.

1871
01:42:58,986 --> 01:43:01,181
But if you stay
calm and quiet...

1872
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,535
she will obey you and
keep coming around.

1873
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:07,479
Days are gone when girls
used to follow boys.

1874
01:43:07,652 --> 01:43:10,386
Making them follow by being
silent is today's trend.

1875
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:12,760
She can commit suicide to have
failed to realize your love...

1876
01:43:12,762 --> 01:43:15,338
but you shouldn't commit suicide
because she doesn't love you.

1877
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:18,374
Don't force me to abuse you!

1878
01:43:19,312 --> 01:43:20,577
I missed a kiss because of you!

1879
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,403
I told you! I knew he would
convince him and bring him back.

1880
01:43:25,429 --> 01:43:26,598
At least you change
for good now.

1881
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:28,091
The way he rushed...

1882
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:30,063
I thought he would jump for sure!

1883
01:43:30,088 --> 01:43:31,518
How did you convince him?

1884
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:33,783
Well when it comes to girls...

1885
01:43:34,048 --> 01:43:37,913
if 100 boys look at them they would want
99 of them to fall in love with them.

1886
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:40,164
They would want to enjoy
with that 1 boy alone.

1887
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:44,057
But for boys, they would
want to enjoy with 99 girls...

1888
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:46,565
and they would want to
fall in love with only 1.

1889
01:43:46,837 --> 01:43:49,376
I made him understand
this and he understood.

1890
01:43:49,401 --> 01:43:52,250
There are many here to
separate the lovers....

1891
01:43:52,467 --> 01:43:55,147
but there are only very few like
you, who unites the lovers.

1892
01:43:55,172 --> 01:43:57,266
- Because he is watching from there.
- You are right.

1893
01:43:57,266 --> 01:43:59,297
I'm sorry Madhan. I
won't drink hereafter.

1894
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,414
Why didn't you wait
until he jumped?

1895
01:44:01,578 --> 01:44:04,718
It would have been better. Now look she
is coming around. Now go, take her.

1896
01:44:05,187 --> 01:44:07,094
Priya, there is no one at my home.
Shall we go?

1897
01:44:07,172 --> 01:44:09,822
Ok move. All of you go
mind your business.

1898
01:44:11,276 --> 01:44:15,262
A crowd that is waiting to record and put
the suicide video in FB and twitter!

1899
01:44:17,023 --> 01:44:18,117
What are you up to?

1900
01:44:18,797 --> 01:44:19,961
At this age...

1901
01:44:20,508 --> 01:44:22,954
how do you carry so
much of love emotions?

1902
01:44:25,141 --> 01:44:27,130
So sweet!

1903
01:44:40,887 --> 01:44:43,127
Looks like this is
slowly gonna workout!

1904
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:44,751
Yes!

1905
01:44:45,877 --> 01:44:46,884
Hello! Hello!

1906
01:44:47,884 --> 01:44:51,917
One of the old age member's son is on his way
with henchman to beat up his dad for wealth.

1907
01:44:52,066 --> 01:44:54,714
Ashwin you must be
here at this hour.

1908
01:44:54,922 --> 01:44:56,361
Ask him to being few
henchmen along with him.

1909
01:44:56,562 --> 01:44:58,576
Why does he need to bring men?
He can manage it himself!

1910
01:44:58,669 --> 01:45:01,150
- This is too much Sarala! What happened?
- Hello! Hello!

1911
01:45:01,631 --> 01:45:03,821
- The line got disconnected.
- We are in trouble!

1912
01:45:06,342 --> 01:45:08,420
- Are you ready.
- Yes chief!

1913
01:45:11,062 --> 01:45:12,131
Just now reached baby.

1914
01:45:12,365 --> 01:45:14,490
I am tired of giving you time.

1915
01:45:15,162 --> 01:45:16,436
It's all waste.

1916
01:45:16,898 --> 01:45:19,560
Using the men I've sent along with you,
if you don't make him sign the document...

1917
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:22,169
then you be ready to
sign the divorce papers.

1918
01:45:22,843 --> 01:45:23,736
Is it your wife?

1919
01:45:24,505 --> 01:45:27,234
Sunil! Shall we go inside?

1920
01:45:32,295 --> 01:45:32,745
Daddy.

1921
01:45:33,633 --> 01:45:34,465
Daddy!

1922
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:40,082
How are you able
to sleep in peace?

1923
01:45:41,192 --> 01:45:41,801
In peace?

1924
01:45:42,289 --> 01:45:43,062
I wonder what it means.

1925
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:46,558
Please register your 50 million
worth hardcore property on my name.

1926
01:45:46,687 --> 01:45:48,062
Why are you so stubborn?

1927
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,398
The Apollo guys wants it.

1928
01:45:49,601 --> 01:45:50,561
The Pizza company wants it.

1929
01:45:50,562 --> 01:45:51,944
The Reliance guy wants to buy it.

1930
01:45:51,969 --> 01:45:53,541
After your death it's
going to mine anyway.

1931
01:45:53,566 --> 01:45:55,035
Why don't you give it to me now!

1932
01:45:55,036 --> 01:45:56,325
If you had taken care of me,

1933
01:45:56,857 --> 01:45:57,879
I would have done it.

1934
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:00,044
Now that you send me to the
old age home, I won't.

1935
01:46:00,137 --> 01:46:03,621
For sure! Even after my death the
property will go to the old age home.

1936
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,162
Do whatever you can!

1937
01:46:05,687 --> 01:46:06,645
He doesn't seem to obey.

1938
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:07,738
Hit him!

1939
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:08,360
Chief...

1940
01:46:08,831 --> 01:46:09,722
we are indeed thugs...

1941
01:46:10,019 --> 01:46:11,654
but we don't raise
hands on the elders.

1942
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:13,636
You wife asked us to
just threaten him.

1943
01:46:13,769 --> 01:46:14,977
Sunil!

1944
01:46:15,094 --> 01:46:15,544
Ashwin!

1945
01:46:15,868 --> 01:46:16,478
Hey Ashwin!

1946
01:46:17,025 --> 01:46:17,923
Who is Ashwin?

1947
01:46:18,043 --> 01:46:18,689
My friend!

1948
01:46:21,158 --> 01:46:22,345
Looks like another old man.

1949
01:46:23,556 --> 01:46:24,415
Lock the door.

1950
01:46:29,331 --> 01:46:31,128
- So you won't hit him?
- None of us will.

1951
01:46:34,236 --> 01:46:35,939
Then fine, I'll man handle my own father.

1952
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:44,178
Look at him breaking the door.

1953
01:46:44,406 --> 01:46:45,664
Pull him inside and thrash him!

1954
01:46:49,452 --> 01:46:50,053
Hey!

1955
01:46:50,366 --> 01:46:52,064
Don't you scare me!

1956
01:46:52,135 --> 01:46:53,432
Have you seen Ashwin fight?

1957
01:47:25,859 --> 01:47:27,018
Awesome! Awesome!

1958
01:47:27,236 --> 01:47:28,174
Awesome!

1959
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:32,259
Ashwin!

1960
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:37,987
Let's go down. Ashwin
will take care of them.

1961
01:48:25,326 --> 01:48:26,982
Hey! Wait!

1962
01:48:27,045 --> 01:48:28,256
- Where are you headed?
- Inside.

1963
01:48:28,458 --> 01:48:29,891
- Don't go.
- Why?

1964
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,541
There is an action
packed fight going on.

1965
01:48:31,611 --> 01:48:32,061
A fight?

1966
01:48:32,845 --> 01:48:33,295
Who?

1967
01:48:33,603 --> 01:48:35,423
Ashwin is busting up the thugs!

1968
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:36,986
- Ashwin?
- Indeed.

1969
01:48:41,937 --> 01:48:44,070
- What happened?
- Don't go inside.

1970
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:46,507
Ashwin has unleashed
hell in there.

1971
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,280
Look! Look over there!

1972
01:48:51,242 --> 01:48:52,835
Watch out I might get hurt!

1973
01:48:54,608 --> 01:48:55,058
Move!

1974
01:49:11,068 --> 01:49:12,573
Damn it! Leave!

1975
01:49:12,598 --> 01:49:15,021
Look at him! Doofus!

1976
01:49:16,333 --> 01:49:17,598
Oh my god!

1977
01:49:17,716 --> 01:49:21,138
You broke the whole house.
Who will pay for the losses?

1978
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:23,771
Shut up or he will bust you up!

1979
01:49:24,036 --> 01:49:26,122
You carry on. We are on your side.

1980
01:49:26,147 --> 01:49:28,081
Even though you are old, you still
have the power of an youngster.

1981
01:49:28,106 --> 01:49:30,356
What is it? Oh! I got it!
Come on, lets all go inside.

1982
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:32,734
Move. Everybody move inside.

1983
01:49:32,937 --> 01:49:35,000
Aren't you going inside? Fine I'll go.

1984
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:37,435
- Hey naughty!
- It was a pleasure watching.

1985
01:49:37,685 --> 01:49:38,679
Sarala there is enough way here.

1986
01:49:38,718 --> 01:49:39,679
Come on.

1987
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,601
Live long and prosper!

1988
01:49:42,325 --> 01:49:44,007
I won't address you
as grandpa anymore.

1989
01:49:44,032 --> 01:49:44,482
Why?

1990
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:46,477
Which grandpa fights like this?

1991
01:49:47,478 --> 01:49:49,439
Grandpa means an old
man who can hardly walk,

1992
01:49:49,763 --> 01:49:52,283
who can hardly see and hear.

1993
01:49:52,744 --> 01:49:54,174
But if grandpas such
as you exists...

1994
01:49:54,544 --> 01:49:55,713
then any girls would...

1995
01:49:55,918 --> 01:49:56,878
fall in love with you.

1996
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:00,057
Other day at the market...

1997
01:50:00,337 --> 01:50:02,212
I saw a Rajnikanth in you.

1998
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,689
At the coffee shop I saw
a Kamal Hassan in you.

1999
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,087
Today, I saw a full fledged
Silambarasan in you.

2000
01:50:09,419 --> 01:50:11,184
When any issue comes
up in life...

2001
01:50:11,376 --> 01:50:13,325
you are handling it very well.

2002
01:50:14,734 --> 01:50:15,584
What are you doing?

2003
01:50:16,184 --> 01:50:17,849
I love you Ashwin!

2004
01:50:23,421 --> 01:50:24,210
Strange...

2005
01:50:25,195 --> 01:50:27,882
It feels like a new beginning.

2006
01:50:29,757 --> 01:50:31,895
Something is happening inside me.

2007
01:50:32,716 --> 01:50:33,787
What is it?

2008
01:50:35,154 --> 01:50:36,756
What's happening?

2009
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:43,645
How do I explain what's
going inside me.

2010
01:50:47,144 --> 01:50:49,848
Is this love?

2011
01:50:50,248 --> 01:50:53,248
Is this what
everyone calls love?

2012
01:50:54,381 --> 01:50:55,506
So, this is love?

2013
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:58,511
Or is it something similar?

2014
01:50:58,742 --> 01:50:59,653
I don't know.

2015
01:51:01,305 --> 01:51:02,586
Oh! Oh!

2016
01:51:03,681 --> 01:51:05,189
Oh my god!

2017
01:51:05,977 --> 01:51:12,276
I feel like singing....

2018
01:51:12,995 --> 01:51:16,247
but I am unable to sing. I
have no idea.

2019
01:51:16,272 --> 01:51:18,639
I can't write lyrics or
make music or put a tune!

2020
01:51:18,713 --> 01:51:20,338
I am unable to do anything!

2021
01:51:20,502 --> 01:51:22,033
Something is happening to me.

2022
01:51:22,058 --> 01:51:23,407
Its attacking me!

2023
01:51:23,472 --> 01:51:25,209
It's slamming me upside down!

2024
01:51:25,209 --> 01:51:28,097
Something is happening. Oh yes!
This is love, right?

2025
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:30,168
This is love! This is indeed love!

2026
01:51:31,058 --> 01:51:37,193
This is love!

2027
01:51:37,341 --> 01:51:39,443
Girl I am in love with you.

2028
01:51:40,317 --> 01:51:44,946
But you know what, I don't care. I don't
know if you will be with me life long.

2029
01:51:45,295 --> 01:51:46,791
Or just today.

2030
01:51:46,817 --> 01:51:48,143
No just tonight...

2031
01:51:48,529 --> 01:51:49,354
I need your love...

2032
01:51:49,591 --> 01:51:50,622
That's all I need.

2033
01:51:51,636 --> 01:51:52,086
Tonight...

2034
01:51:53,518 --> 01:51:53,968
Tonight...

2035
01:51:55,362 --> 01:51:56,800
Tonight...

2036
01:51:57,174 --> 01:51:58,220
Tonight...

2037
01:51:59,159 --> 01:52:01,122
Tonight...

2038
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:04,247
All I need is your love;
just for tonight!

2039
01:52:04,872 --> 01:52:05,653

All I need is your love;
just for tonight!

2043
01:52:18,198 --> 01:52:21,410
All I need is you to be my
girlfriend; just for tonight!

2044
01:52:22,058 --> 01:52:25,365
All I need is you to be my
girlfriend; just for tonight!

2045
01:52:25,777 --> 01:52:27,464
Just for tonight!

2046
01:52:27,745 --> 01:52:29,808
Just for tonight!

2047
01:52:29,808 --> 01:52:34,059
All I need is you to be my
girlfriend; just for tonight!

2048
01:52:34,285 --> 01:52:35,707
That's all I need.

2049
01:52:36,426 --> 01:52:37,856
That's all I need.

2050
01:53:24,289 --> 01:53:25,732
Hey Ashwin grandpa!

2051
01:53:26,177 --> 01:53:27,740
You're a super sweetheart.

2052
01:53:28,084 --> 01:53:29,569
So cute with the salt
and pepper look.

2053
01:53:29,967 --> 01:53:32,666
You hot paunch! And when you are around,
it's party time!

2054
01:53:32,817 --> 01:53:34,780
We wanna party with you grandpa.

2055
01:53:34,805 --> 01:53:36,547
Dating, chatting and
very naughty...

2056
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:38,450
Ashwin grandpa mania!

2057
01:54:24,587 --> 01:54:26,626
Bell bottoms turned slim fits.

2058
01:54:26,626 --> 01:54:28,212
Love letter turned whatsapp.

2059
01:54:28,397 --> 01:54:30,266
Pancakes turned pizza.

2060
01:54:30,297 --> 01:54:32,168
Toddy turned scotch!

2061
01:54:32,334 --> 01:54:34,200
Cassette turned CD

2062
01:54:34,225 --> 01:54:35,932
Cart turned Benz.

2063
01:54:36,128 --> 01:54:37,902
Film roll turned digital.

2064
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:39,699
Grinder turned into Mixer.

2065
01:54:39,964 --> 01:54:43,897
Back then MGR rocked the
show; now it's me STR!

2066
01:54:43,922 --> 01:54:47,342
I am a little star; soon
I'll be the super star.

2067
01:54:47,444 --> 01:54:49,369
That's the power of
the mischievous lord!

2068
01:54:49,369 --> 01:54:51,257
That's the power of fans!

2069
01:54:51,257 --> 01:54:55,298
The only thing I need is the
blessing of the lord himself!

2070
01:54:56,417 --> 01:54:59,105
All I need is your love;
just for tonight!

2071
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:15,480
You change the DP and it
gets millions of likes.

2072
01:55:15,670 --> 01:55:17,426
You go live and the views
are top of the chart.

2073
01:55:17,426 --> 01:55:19,585
Your tweets are a sensation.

2074
01:55:19,585 --> 01:55:21,316
You bring about a new
revolution in love!

2075

Girl go "Oh my god" at the sight of you.

2076
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:24,895
They fall for your looks.

2077
01:55:25,201 --> 01:55:27,080
You are the current
top trending topic.

2078
01:55:27,106 --> 01:55:29,306
Ashiwn grandpa Mania!

2079
01:55:29,517 --> 01:55:31,338
Lover boy games...

2080
01:55:31,455 --> 01:55:33,000
Lover boy games...

2081
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:35,292
Lover boy games...

2082
01:55:35,292 --> 01:55:37,126
No one's an expert like
you in lover boy games.

2083
01:55:37,126 --> 01:55:40,752
No one's an expert like
you in lover boy games.

2084
01:55:40,752 --> 01:55:44,135
No one's an expert like
you in lover boy games.

2085
01:55:44,484 --> 01:55:47,874
No one's an expert like
you in lover boy games.

2086
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:50,523
All I need is you to be my
girlfriend; just for tonight!

2087
01:55:51,663 --> 01:55:54,749

Just for tonight.

2090
01:55:59,474 --> 01:56:02,935
All I need is you to be my
girlfriend; just for tonight!

2091
01:56:07,312 --> 01:56:09,312
Don photo has been
emailed from Dubai.

2092
01:56:09,718 --> 01:56:10,788
I'll nab him soon..

2093
01:56:11,054 --> 01:56:12,019
and get promoted!

2094
01:56:12,988 --> 01:56:13,691
Who are you man?

2095
01:56:14,379 --> 01:56:17,348
You low lever officer! You disturbed
the important conference.

2096
01:56:17,451 --> 01:56:19,919
Sorry sir. I was here
to just pass this file.

2097
01:56:22,613 --> 01:56:23,293
Who is he?

2098
01:56:23,332 --> 01:56:25,199
He is the Don wrecking
havoc in Dubai.

2099
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:26,027
We are looking for him.

2100
01:56:26,027 --> 01:56:27,277
I've seen this old man!

2101
01:56:27,277 --> 01:56:28,811
- You have seen him?
- Have you?

2102
01:56:29,674 --> 01:56:30,580
Ok.Ok.

2103
01:56:31,067 --> 01:56:32,986
Very smart looking.

2104
01:56:33,321 --> 01:56:34,712
- Thank you.
- Dust.

2105
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:37,088
The paunch is too evident.

2106
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,170
Listen...

2107
01:56:38,487 --> 01:56:40,470
this paunch makes you
look even more smarter.

2108
01:56:40,743 --> 01:56:42,892
- Isn't it?
- You got it right. I like you.

2109
01:56:44,058 --> 01:56:46,285
All these days the body
worked hard for the women.

2110
01:56:46,598 --> 01:56:48,887
After a long time, for a girl...

2111
01:56:49,957 --> 01:56:50,934
the heart is working.

2112
01:56:52,597 --> 01:56:53,746
Thanks. Enough.

2113
01:56:55,804 --> 01:56:58,663
But I wonder why am I
unable to propose my love?

2114
01:56:59,209 --> 01:57:03,810
If a lover boy like you claim to
be confused about proposing...

2115
01:57:04,057 --> 01:57:06,299
the whole Tamil Nadu won't
be able to bear it.

2116
01:57:06,324 --> 01:57:08,933
Look, I'll tell you and
follow that exactly.

2117
01:57:10,397 --> 01:57:10,847
Sakthi...

2118
01:57:11,788 --> 01:57:12,634
I don't like you.

2119
01:57:13,391 --> 01:57:14,667
I don't wish to make you mine.

2120
01:57:15,072 --> 01:57:16,408
I don't think you are beautiful.

2121
01:57:16,845 --> 01:57:17,619
But...

2122
01:57:17,947 --> 01:57:19,976
I am worried that all
these might just happen.

2123
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:22,776
Please stop it. It is very bad.

2124
01:57:23,417 --> 01:57:24,565
Try this one.

2125
01:57:24,989 --> 01:57:26,549
What does you heart say?

2126
01:57:27,314 --> 01:57:29,393
Does it keep saying
'Ramya, Ramya'?

2127
01:57:31,455 --> 01:57:32,767
Won't you ever stop
saying this dialogue?

2128
01:57:32,767 --> 01:57:34,083
Even the reaction remains same.

2129
01:57:34,494 --> 01:57:35,619
Listen...

2130
01:57:36,439 --> 01:57:37,579
Love is...

2131
01:57:39,909 --> 01:57:41,339
a true feeling.

2132
01:57:41,893 --> 01:57:42,955
I'll tell you how.

2133
01:57:43,815 --> 01:57:45,393
When you see a few girls...

2134
01:57:46,096 --> 01:57:49,299
you would wanna switch off the
lights and take her to the bed.

2135
01:57:50,214 --> 01:57:51,690
But there are few girls...

2136
01:57:52,088 --> 01:57:55,502
whom you would wanna bring
home and turn on the lights.

2137
01:57:55,589 --> 01:57:57,017
How is it?

2138
01:57:58,141 --> 01:57:59,290
It's awesome!

2139
01:58:00,603 --> 01:58:01,938
Someone's calling.

2140
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:06,174
It's her. It's her!

2141
01:58:08,931 --> 01:58:09,619
Hello.

2142
01:58:09,753 --> 01:58:10,345
Ashwin.

2143
01:58:10,563 --> 01:58:11,276
Where are you?

2144
01:58:11,846 --> 01:58:12,580
At home.

2145
01:58:12,768 --> 01:58:15,821
Today is dad's
retirement function.

2146
01:58:16,129 --> 01:58:18,333
I am going to reveal
something important.

2147
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:21,286
I too wanna say something
important to you.

2148
01:58:21,491 --> 01:58:22,630
But you go ahead first.

2149
01:58:23,427 --> 01:58:24,169
Today...

2150
01:58:24,404 --> 01:58:26,716
I've decided to
disclose the love.

2151
01:58:28,629 --> 01:58:29,504
But...

2152
01:58:30,153 --> 01:58:31,153
the age difference.

2153
01:58:31,341 --> 01:58:33,014
Age is not a big deal.

2154
01:58:33,201 --> 01:58:34,193
Be confident.

2155
01:58:34,442 --> 01:58:37,403
No matter what, I'll be there
for you forever, Ramya!

2156
01:58:37,537 --> 01:58:40,373
Ashwin grandpa, on the way.

2157
01:58:50,622 --> 01:58:51,633
Hi Ramya.

2158
01:58:52,782 --> 01:58:53,493
How do I look?

2159
01:58:53,854 --> 01:58:54,843
Ashwin!

2160
01:58:55,169 --> 01:58:57,069
You look top class smart today.

2161
01:58:57,137 --> 01:58:57,797
Thank you.

2162
01:58:57,926 --> 01:58:59,401
Just like a groom.

2163
01:58:59,401 --> 01:59:02,909
- Super. - Are you gonna say
it in front of everyone?

2164
01:59:03,518 --> 01:59:04,721
I just felt I must do it.

2165
01:59:05,028 --> 01:59:07,339
I thought I'll open up everything
in this retirement function.

2166
01:59:07,987 --> 01:59:09,559
It is going to be a
big shock for dad.

2167
01:59:09,692 --> 01:59:10,263
Because...

2168
01:59:10,699 --> 01:59:13,316
he would want me to marry
the boy of his choice.

2169
01:59:13,958 --> 01:59:14,916
Do you know...

2170
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:17,059
my dad is fine with
love marriage.

2171
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,855
But this is a bit offbeat love.

2172
01:59:20,402 --> 01:59:22,097
People will talk about
age difference.

2173
01:59:22,581 --> 01:59:24,182
People will give strange looks.

2174
01:59:24,317 --> 01:59:25,424
He will question you too!

2175
01:59:25,424 --> 01:59:25,874
Oh yeah!

2176
01:59:25,899 --> 01:59:27,969
That you were with me all this
time and you hit it from him.

2177
01:59:28,173 --> 01:59:28,917
I'll tell him...

2178
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:31,853
that I haven't told you
directly about my love.

2179
01:59:32,747 --> 01:59:33,835
Yes, you hadn't did that yet.

2180
01:59:33,836 --> 01:59:35,265
This is my decision.

2181
01:59:35,818 --> 01:59:37,896
Until I feel this is correct...

2182
01:59:38,249 --> 01:59:39,429
I won't share it with anyone.

2183
01:59:39,748 --> 01:59:40,198
Ramya...

2184
01:59:41,124 --> 01:59:42,663
you are a very matured girl.

2185
01:59:43,319 --> 01:59:45,163
A bold decision at
such an age;

2186
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:47,207
no girl will ever
dare to do the same.

2187
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:48,537
But you have made that decision.

2188
01:59:48,694 --> 01:59:49,772
That sounds fine...

2189
01:59:50,241 --> 01:59:50,691
but...

2190
01:59:51,209 --> 01:59:52,568
such a huge age gap....

2191
01:59:52,655 --> 01:59:55,402
It's not like this is something that
has never happened in this world.

2192
01:59:55,633 --> 01:59:57,676
There are lot of things
happening in this world.

2193
01:59:57,936 --> 02:00:00,195
People will call it as a
negative vibe on our culture.

2194
02:00:00,848 --> 02:00:03,094
Back during old days
love was blind.

2195
02:00:03,171 --> 02:00:05,632
Love doesn't have age and
that is the latest trend.

2196
02:00:05,999 --> 02:00:08,046
For the first time in the
history of Tamil cinema..

2197
02:00:08,071 --> 02:00:09,406
a unique love story.

2198
02:00:09,835 --> 02:00:11,632
It will obviously
sound shocking.

2199
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:16,070
But aren't you strong?

2200
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:17,905
That is more than enough.

2201
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:19,188
If without any issues...

2202
02:00:19,465 --> 02:00:20,858
everyone accepts
this relationship...

2203
02:00:20,935 --> 02:00:23,836
then I am planning to have the
engagement in this get together itself.

2204
02:00:25,164 --> 02:00:28,014
How can I handle myself if you
keep giving me surprises.

2205
02:00:28,990 --> 02:00:30,092
I haven't....

2206
02:00:30,834 --> 02:00:32,147
bought the ring yet.

2207
02:00:32,936 --> 02:00:34,118
Darling...

2208
02:00:34,178 --> 02:00:35,814
why does it always
have to be you?

2209
02:00:36,147 --> 02:00:37,347
I've bought it.

2210
02:00:38,085 --> 02:00:39,139
Naughty!

2211
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:39,870
One minute.

2212
02:00:40,669 --> 02:00:41,579
Give me your coat.

2213
02:00:41,763 --> 02:00:42,213
My coat?

2214
02:00:42,818 --> 02:00:43,268
Why?

2215
02:00:43,497 --> 02:00:44,953
Surprise!

2216
02:00:44,978 --> 02:00:45,915
Well another one?

2217
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:47,141
Wait and watch.

2218
02:00:47,688 --> 02:00:48,727
I hope its a good one.

2219
02:00:49,502 --> 02:00:51,992
- I'll be back in 5 minutes.
- Take your time.

2220
02:00:52,017 --> 02:00:52,467
Boss!

2221
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:54,790
There you are!

2222
02:00:54,899 --> 02:00:59,196
It was you who prevented me from suicide
and taught me that love is all about lust.

2223
02:00:59,369 --> 02:01:01,475
You aren't a ordinary grandpa.
You are a divine grandpa!

2224
02:01:01,584 --> 02:01:02,545
Get  lo...

2225
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,920
Get going.

2226
02:01:04,366 --> 02:01:04,967
Leave.

2227
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:06,545
Other day at the terrace...

2228
02:01:07,358 --> 02:01:09,288
I should have pushed you down!

2229
02:01:09,577 --> 02:01:10,027
My bad.

2230
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:12,655
Buddy, why are you always late?

2231
02:01:12,888 --> 02:01:13,943
Can't you be punctual?

2232
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:15,728
I won't come at the said time...

2233
02:01:15,811 --> 02:01:17,439
I arrive at my will.

2234
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:18,017
Sir drinks.

2235
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:23,150
It is because of this, my
body has taken a toll!

2236
02:01:23,815 --> 02:01:27,018
I've just made a decision to take
a new step in my life and...

2237
02:01:27,082 --> 02:01:28,605
that's when you bring this?

2238
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:29,538
Come here.

2239
02:01:30,971 --> 02:01:33,831
Liquor drinking is
injurious to health!

2240
02:01:34,421 --> 02:01:35,406
Get out!

2241
02:01:36,516 --> 02:01:40,207
Glad to see all the relatives and friends
here at my dad's retirement function.

2242
02:01:41,878 --> 02:01:43,566
In this get together,
I would like to...

2243
02:01:44,112 --> 02:01:45,682
open up a personal matter.

2244
02:01:49,123 --> 02:01:50,709
Even my dad doesn't know about it.

2245
02:01:51,873 --> 02:01:54,381
This will definitely be a
surprise to all of you.

2246
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:55,763
But...

2247
02:01:56,693 --> 02:01:58,295
it'll be a shocking
news for my dad.

2248
02:01:59,418 --> 02:02:02,395
I was avoiding all the proposals
that you brought for me.

2249
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:03,701
That's because...

2250
02:02:04,652 --> 02:02:05,652
I'm in love dad.

2251
02:02:07,317 --> 02:02:08,372
I could have told you...

2252
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:10,849
but there is an age issue to it.

2253
02:02:12,076 --> 02:02:13,279
He is present here.

2254
02:02:15,008 --> 02:02:15,800
So...

2255
02:02:16,270 --> 02:02:17,053
sorry dad.

2256
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:19,832
Why are you embarrassing
me in front of everyone?

2257
02:02:20,322 --> 02:02:21,900
I felt this is the right time.

2258
02:02:22,235 --> 02:02:23,728
You will like him for sure.

2259
02:02:24,189 --> 02:02:25,947
He will take good care of me.

2260
02:02:25,972 --> 02:02:27,701
It's just few days
since we fell in love.

2261
02:02:28,072 --> 02:02:29,369
But he is a true gentleman.

2262
02:02:31,002 --> 02:02:31,776
Just one problem.

2263
02:02:33,486 --> 02:02:34,486
Age difference.

2264
02:02:36,346 --> 02:02:38,556
That doesn't seem to
be a problem for me.

2265
02:02:38,799 --> 02:02:41,315
I don't know how you
are going to take it.

2266
02:02:43,115 --> 02:02:43,565
Now...

2267
02:02:45,893 --> 02:02:47,193
I'll call him on stage.

2268
02:02:48,987 --> 02:02:50,237
Please come Shiva.

2269
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:14,029
He is Shiva!

2270
02:03:15,404 --> 02:03:16,161
My love.

2271
02:03:21,162 --> 02:03:22,967
I haven't told
Ashwin grandpa yet.

2272
02:03:23,967 --> 02:03:26,272
So grandpa, how's my selection?

2273
02:03:32,021 --> 02:03:34,544
I thought you were about introduce
this grandpa as your lover!

2274
02:03:34,747 --> 02:03:35,854
I was afraid of that!

2275
02:03:40,175 --> 02:03:41,870
Stop kidding dad!

2276
02:03:42,394 --> 02:03:43,913
Me and grandpa?

2277
02:03:46,303 --> 02:03:48,131
The ISD bill amount is too high.

2278
02:03:48,619 --> 02:03:50,294
You are not the falling in
love type of girl Ramya?

2279
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:51,939
It's a long distance
relationship.

2280
02:03:52,215 --> 02:03:53,520
Don't worry dad.

2281
02:03:53,872 --> 02:03:56,106
You won't understand.
He is in the U.S.

2282
02:03:56,575 --> 02:03:57,559
You will have to wait.

2283
02:03:57,910 --> 02:03:59,847
I'll myself tell you
once it is confirmed.

2284
02:03:59,957 --> 02:04:01,036
Until then just forget it.

2285
02:04:01,205 --> 02:04:02,472
Did you check out the
photo I sent you?

2286
02:04:02,472 --> 02:04:04,308
I di...did see...

2287
02:04:04,464 --> 02:04:06,660
- He really looks like m...me...
- Told you!

2288
02:04:06,962 --> 02:04:07,412
See?

2289
02:04:07,665 --> 02:04:08,899
You guys look the exact same.

2290
02:04:09,282 --> 02:04:12,024
This is what I was
trying to explain you.

2291
02:04:13,209 --> 02:04:14,686
Did you notice something?

2292
02:04:15,194 --> 02:04:17,389
When you grow old, you
will look like him.

2293
02:04:18,061 --> 02:04:18,741
Oh yeah. Right.

2294
02:04:20,408 --> 02:04:23,066
Did you tell about our
lo...love to Ashwin grandpa?

2295
02:04:23,192 --> 02:04:24,333
Not yet.

2296
02:04:26,466 --> 02:04:28,685
What's the age difference
between you and Shiva?

2297
02:04:32,095 --> 02:04:33,587
Shiv is ...

2298
02:04:33,736 --> 02:04:34,541
2 years...

2299
02:04:35,439 --> 02:04:36,275
younger to me.

2300
02:04:36,775 --> 02:04:37,225
Come on!

2301
02:04:37,658 --> 02:04:39,049
This ain't a big deal dear.

2302
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,773
I was worried thinking that
it was something else.

2303
02:04:44,553 --> 02:04:45,758
Nice dad.

2304
02:05:21,944 --> 02:05:24,311
Hi. Go..Good evening everyone.

2305
02:05:24,717 --> 02:05:25,811
Oh sorry.

2306
02:05:28,262 --> 02:05:29,864
Gre..greetings to one and all.

2307
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:31,960
I am Sh...Shi..Shiva.

2308
02:05:32,406 --> 02:05:33,148
I...

2309
02:05:33,367 --> 02:05:34,718
sta..stammer a bit.

2310
02:05:34,803 --> 02:05:37,928
So everyone calls me
Stamm..stammering Shiva.

2311
02:05:38,874 --> 02:05:40,110
Sor...Sorry.

2312
02:05:40,696 --> 02:05:41,610
Thank you.

2313
02:05:42,706 --> 02:05:44,212
Fine?

2314
02:06:01,370 --> 02:06:01,820
Sir...

2315
02:06:03,339 --> 02:06:06,625
didn't you say that drinking
is injurious to health?

2316
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:09,163
I did say it.

2317
02:06:09,463 --> 02:06:10,218
But...

2318
02:06:10,312 --> 02:06:13,291
- do you know what is even more injurious to health?
- What is it sir?

2319
02:06:14,781 --> 02:06:16,089
Love!

2320
02:06:17,366 --> 02:06:19,415
- Have you ever fallen in love?
- No sir.

2321
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:21,339
I married the girl
my mom showed me.

2322
02:06:22,776 --> 02:06:24,661
God saved you.

2323
02:06:25,193 --> 02:06:25,958
You are lucky.

2324
02:06:26,637 --> 02:06:27,387
Leave. Leave.

2325
02:06:27,536 --> 02:06:28,631
Serve drinks to everyone.

2326
02:06:30,068 --> 02:06:32,302
- Leave. Leave.
- Ok sir.

2327
02:06:53,038 --> 02:06:53,679
Whom?

2328
02:06:54,827 --> 02:06:55,624
I'll kidnap!

2329
02:06:56,592 --> 02:06:57,042
Hello.

2330
02:06:58,327 --> 02:06:59,210
The make up man?

2331
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:23,393
Crazy girl, hey crazy girl.

2332
02:07:23,666 --> 02:07:27,868
This crazy grandpa
was crazy about you.

2333
02:07:28,820 --> 02:07:33,328
I fell in love with you;
It kept growing inside me.

2334
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:38,249
This grandpa fell deep
in love with you!

2335
02:07:43,273 --> 02:07:46,349
Do you have idea how hard it is
for an old man to fall in love?

2336
02:07:47,575 --> 02:07:49,200
With grey hairs,

2337
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:51,068
with wrinkles in face...

2338
02:07:51,817 --> 02:07:53,920
and with life hanging on the wall.

2339
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:58,796
Every time when the old man looked at
the mirror and thought life was over;

2340
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:01,601
just like a blessing in
disguise from the god...

2341
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:04,077
a girl stepped into my life.

2342
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:09,563
I was friend to her and made sure that she
never found out about my love for her.

2343
02:08:10,531 --> 02:08:14,415
Just like the classic "Oru thalai
raagam" it was a one sided love.

2344
02:08:16,252 --> 02:08:17,595
In today's world...

2345
02:08:18,391 --> 02:08:21,675
it is very difficult for the boys
to make a girl fall for them.

2346
02:08:22,863 --> 02:08:29,805
Imagine how hard it would to make a
girl fall, who calls me grandpa?

2347
02:08:31,469 --> 02:08:33,016
I successfully did that...

2348
02:08:33,999 --> 02:08:36,311
and reached to a level
where she kissed me.

2349
02:08:36,859 --> 02:08:41,615
And just when I thought about
turning over a new leaf...

2350
02:08:42,498 --> 02:08:44,834
and when this life was
riding in a smooth road..

2351
02:08:45,186 --> 02:08:50,963
out of the blue comes a lover
doofus who looks just like me!

2352
02:08:51,066 --> 02:08:53,183
And how dare you pose
a threat to my love?

2353
02:08:54,855 --> 02:08:58,614
Since you are old, she will
obviously call you grandpa.

2354
02:08:59,043 --> 02:09:01,230
Top of that, she is a very young girl...

2355
02:09:01,371 --> 02:09:03,879
She will obviously fall in love
with a guy in her age range.

2356
02:09:04,863 --> 02:09:08,277
I tried explaining it to you
but you never pay heed.

2357
02:09:08,302 --> 02:09:09,584
Indeed I didn't pay heed!

2358
02:09:11,075 --> 02:09:12,804
My heart didn't pay heed to me.

2359
02:09:13,414 --> 02:09:14,185
Baldie!

2360
02:09:14,701 --> 02:09:15,866
- Yes boss.
- Baldie!

2361
02:09:18,002 --> 02:09:18,779
Hit him!

2362
02:09:20,583 --> 02:09:21,893
I said hit him!

2363
02:09:24,229 --> 02:09:26,346
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!

2364
02:09:26,525 --> 02:09:27,541
I said stop it!

2365
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:28,424
- Stop it.
- Why?

2366
02:09:28,627 --> 02:09:30,162
If I gotta set a mole on him then
I should do the same to you.

2367
02:09:30,187 --> 02:09:31,921
If I apply Bindi on him then
I should apply on you too.

2368
02:09:31,922 --> 02:09:33,648
If he bleeds then you
should also bleed.

2369
02:09:34,828 --> 02:09:36,015
This ain't ordinary make up!

2370
02:09:36,016 --> 02:09:36,953
It's Ra stasis make up!

2371
02:09:36,953 --> 02:09:38,451
Why are you wasting your energy?

2372
02:09:38,567 --> 02:09:41,599
One bullet and his brain will pop out.
Why all this hassle?

2373
02:09:43,529 --> 02:09:45,318
- He must not die.
- Why?

2374
02:09:46,816 --> 02:09:47,691
If he dies...

2375
02:09:48,752 --> 02:09:49,847
then the story ends.

2376
02:09:50,878 --> 02:09:51,948
If he dies...

2377
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:53,713
she'll have pity on him.

2378
02:09:54,018 --> 02:09:55,351
So what's your plan?

2379
02:09:55,651 --> 02:09:56,927
I'm going to cut him open!

2380
02:09:57,075 --> 02:09:57,611
Fine...

2381
02:09:57,799 --> 02:09:58,924
you will cut him open..

2382
02:09:59,018 --> 02:10:01,101
will do the same to everyone
who comes in between?

2383
02:10:01,351 --> 02:10:02,601
Is that what you do?

2384
02:10:03,132 --> 02:10:04,163
Not him...

2385
02:10:04,523 --> 02:10:06,802
even if it's Vembu, Dinesh or Kushal...

2386
02:10:06,828 --> 02:10:09,258
or if it's Simbhu, Dhanush or Vishal...

2387
02:10:09,526 --> 02:10:12,244
whoever it is, I'll
cut them open!

2388
02:10:12,269 --> 02:10:13,800
You aren't such
kind of a person.

2389
02:10:14,644 --> 02:10:15,652
You are very lovable...

2390
02:10:16,104 --> 02:10:17,589
You are very very genuine person.

2391
02:10:21,649 --> 02:10:23,460
Correct. Correct.

2392
02:10:23,843 --> 02:10:24,906
Well,

2393
02:10:25,624 --> 02:10:26,861
in Tamizh cinema....

2394
02:10:27,353 --> 02:10:30,383
there is an actor who, in his movies,
won't even lay a finger on heroines.

2395
02:10:30,462 --> 02:10:33,072
Do you think I am like actor TR?

2396
02:10:33,822 --> 02:10:35,398
In the same Tamizh Cinema...

2397
02:10:35,725 --> 02:10:39,329
there is an actor who, in his movies,
touches and bites the lip off the heroines.

2398
02:10:39,727 --> 02:10:41,297
I am like actor STR! Now move!

2399
02:10:43,656 --> 02:10:44,515
Henceforth...

2400
02:10:45,101 --> 02:10:48,234
grandpa, grandpa won't be
anymore Ashwin grandpa.

2401
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:49,404
I am...

2402
02:10:49,429 --> 02:10:52,555
sta...stam...stamm...stammering
Shiva!

2403
02:11:35,175 --> 02:11:37,631
Who played this song again
here in Tamizh Nadu?

2404
02:11:38,963 --> 02:11:39,505
Grandpa?

2405
02:11:41,771 --> 02:11:43,880
Love is like a rose.

2406
02:11:44,130 --> 02:11:48,226
We were used to it's thorns
pricking us and making us bleed.

2407
02:11:49,304 --> 02:11:52,812
But now, we have now moved on saying
if not Trisha then Nayanthara.

2408
02:11:53,445 --> 02:11:55,381
Why do you wanna fall
in love at this age?

2409
02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,599
I'm coming.

2410
02:11:57,509 --> 02:11:59,173
What is it grandpa? Love failure?

2411
02:11:59,964 --> 02:12:02,337
I am talking to you and why
aren't you responding?

2412
02:12:03,761 --> 02:12:04,707
Tell me grandpa.

2413
02:12:06,136 --> 02:12:06,925
Why are you crying?

2414
02:12:07,123 --> 02:12:08,106
Yes!

2415
02:12:09,731 --> 02:12:11,020
Indeed it's a love failure.

2416
02:12:12,457 --> 02:12:13,440
What's wrong?

2417
02:12:14,473 --> 02:12:17,161
Is love entitled only for
youngsters like you?

2418
02:12:18,558 --> 02:12:20,566
Isn't an old man like me
allowed to fall in love?

2419
02:12:21,465 --> 02:12:23,317
Aren't we allowed to go
through heart breaks?

2420
02:12:26,862 --> 02:12:28,026
It's like you said...

2421
02:12:28,689 --> 02:12:32,104
Love is like a rose and the thorns
prick us and make us bleed.

2422
02:12:36,333 --> 02:12:37,841
She betrayed me.

2423
02:12:38,559 --> 02:12:39,199
Oh I see.

2424
02:12:40,006 --> 02:12:42,308
When youngsters like
us are betrayed...

2425
02:12:42,486 --> 02:12:44,878
then obviously an old man like you
won't be spared either. Isn't it?

2426
02:12:44,903 --> 02:12:45,888
Correct.

2427
02:12:47,517 --> 02:12:48,737
Old man...

2428
02:12:49,548 --> 02:12:50,994
well the body know I am old...

2429
02:12:51,884 --> 02:12:53,564
but the heart doesn't realize.

2430
02:12:55,119 --> 02:12:56,450
A youngster is advising!

2431
02:12:57,435 --> 02:12:58,325
Do you hear?

2432
02:12:59,443 --> 02:13:00,193
Fool!

2433
02:13:00,786 --> 02:13:02,036
It doesn't obey!

2434
02:13:04,568 --> 02:13:05,742
It's pains.

2435
02:13:06,952 --> 02:13:09,148
Forget it grandpa. Don't cry.

2436
02:13:09,327 --> 02:13:10,828
Only men cry.

2437
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:12,633
Ladies always cheating.

2438
02:13:12,744 --> 02:13:14,504
Don't cry. Don't cry grandpa.

2439
02:13:17,052 --> 02:13:18,302
What is it grandpa?

2440
02:13:20,763 --> 02:13:21,474
So tell me...

2441
02:13:23,174 --> 02:13:24,588
why am I crying?

2442
02:13:26,807 --> 02:13:28,611
She is the one who betrayed me.

2443
02:13:30,204 --> 02:13:32,101
I will make her cry!

2444
02:13:34,352 --> 02:13:35,954
Why should I struggle?

2445
02:13:37,968 --> 02:13:39,827
I will make her struggle!

2446
02:13:41,258 --> 02:13:42,531
Why am I desperate?

2447
02:13:43,549 --> 02:13:46,011
I'll make her desperate!

2448
02:13:46,574 --> 02:13:47,988
Why am I lamenting?

2449
02:13:48,777 --> 02:13:50,613
I'll make her to lament!

2450
02:13:50,832 --> 02:13:53,566
She should become
desperate, cry and lament!

2451
02:13:53,839 --> 02:13:56,342
She must go through what
I am going through.

2452
02:13:58,017 --> 02:13:59,014
Grandpa!

2453
02:13:59,694 --> 02:14:00,913
I thought you would regret...

2454
02:14:01,124 --> 02:14:02,756
but looks like you
will make me regret!

2455
02:14:02,848 --> 02:14:04,075
Today's world...

2456
02:14:05,496 --> 02:14:07,926
isn't for the genuine
and honest ones.

2457
02:14:08,395 --> 02:14:09,503
Do you know why?

2458
02:14:10,447 --> 02:14:12,129
Because it is the
Kaliyugam (Doomsday)

2459
02:14:12,307 --> 02:14:14,689
The evil is out and the
dooms day is nearing.

2460
02:14:16,409 --> 02:14:17,143
Well...

2461
02:14:17,588 --> 02:14:19,340
this evil guy. Heard
of the evil guy?

2462
02:14:19,786 --> 02:14:21,958
I had set him aside.

2463
02:14:22,708 --> 02:14:24,911
It's time to bring him in!

2464
02:14:25,349 --> 02:14:25,880
Because...

2465
02:14:26,435 --> 02:14:31,018
even they say that they
want the evil guy.

2466
02:14:31,237 --> 02:14:32,596
Awesome grandpa!

2467
02:14:33,542 --> 02:14:35,542
Because if you be a genuine lover...

2468
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:37,291
they tag him as retard!

2469
02:14:37,479 --> 02:14:40,361
All those who fall
in love are retards!

2470
02:14:40,533 --> 02:14:44,619
I am not saying this. It was said long,
long ago. Do you what was said back then?

2471
02:14:44,916 --> 02:14:47,057
You may even trust
the worst poison.

2472
02:14:47,244 --> 02:14:49,276
You may even trust the
dangerous tornado.

2473
02:14:49,682 --> 02:14:51,815
You many even trust
the musth elephant.

2474
02:14:51,932 --> 02:14:54,185
You may even trust
the ferocious tiger.

2475
02:14:54,404 --> 02:14:56,497
You may even trust your
enemies messenger.

2476
02:14:56,747 --> 02:14:59,271
You may trust the thief, the
robber and the one in disguise.

2477
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:02,686
But if you trust the dressed
up beauty called woman...

2478
02:15:02,957 --> 02:15:05,777
you will find yourself on the
streets, lost and depressed!

2479
02:15:09,981 --> 02:15:12,910
All those who fall
in love are retards!

2480
02:15:13,301 --> 02:15:14,200
I am not saying this.

2481
02:15:14,324 --> 02:15:16,912
Like I said, it was already
said by someone long, long ago!

2482
02:15:17,015 --> 02:15:18,812
Can anyone press charges
against him now?

2483
02:15:18,812 --> 02:15:19,850
- No way!
- No way right?

2484
02:15:19,851 --> 02:15:20,932
- Give a hi-fi!
- Yay!

2485
02:15:24,616 --> 02:15:26,053
In this life...

2486
02:15:26,921 --> 02:15:29,460
there is always the first
half and the second half.

2487
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:34,123
Similarly, even in a movie there
is a first half and second half.

2488
02:15:35,389 --> 02:15:36,506
So far...

2489
02:15:37,241 --> 02:15:40,053
they just witnessed
one dimension.

2490
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:42,749
They are yet to watch
the other dimension.

2491
02:15:43,712 --> 02:15:46,008
When the first part is
raising such a hell!

2492
02:15:46,033 --> 02:15:48,541
So what have you planned
for the second part?
