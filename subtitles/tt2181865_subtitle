1
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:23,181
Kuala Lumpur
Many, many years ago...

2
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,401
Sorry

3
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,476
There are special instructions
from lntelligence

4
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,809
...that everybody should undergo
a security screening

5
00:01:54,914 --> 00:02:00,181
Please, this is an emergency
She is Dr. Susan's patient

6
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,947
Alright

7
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,183
- Mr. Alphonse
- Yes?

8
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,555
Come

9
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,327
Congratulations!
Twin babies, boys

10
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,624
Thank you!

11
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,359
Ah! Congrats!

12
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,258
l'll go and buy some sweets

13
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,103
Sorry
l'm sorry

14
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,936
- What's happening?
- l don't know

15
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,337
Doctor

16
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,993
You go downstairs quickly, go
l will come with Mary

17
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,727
Go

18
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,688
Come here for a minute

19
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,387
What is it?
What?

20
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,361
l think one of the babies
has been exchanged

21
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,030
Alphonse!

22
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:46,244
COBRA

23
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:55,089
Today

24
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,905
Aiyo!
Hey, there goes my dhoti

25
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,434
Who is that vagabond?

26
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,376
Sh! Quiet! Don't you
recognize that speed?

27
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,005
That's cobra's vehicle

28
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,211
Cobra?
Who is he?

29
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,880
Not he, them
There are 2 of them

30
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,422
Kottayam Brothers, 'Ko-br'

31
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,650
What! Come again?

32
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,192
The 'Ko' from Kottayam
and 'Br' from brothers

33
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,022
...they became 'co-bra'

34
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,688
But how can brothers have a bra
That's for sisters, isn't it?

35
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,231
This is not that 'bra'

36
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,894
The loop under 'b' to
pronounce 'br' in malayalam

37
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,437
Oh! That bra
We call it the loin cloth!!

38
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,600
Rascals! Going around without
dhoti and loin cloth!

39
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,438
Look, Lawrence 'chetta'
The ferry is coming in

40
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,474
'Chetta' give me tea

41
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,417
Diwakara, whose is that
swanky car in the ferry?

42
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,078
- Belongs to the cobras
- Who?

43
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,419
The cobras
That's what l was told

44
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,717
They are from Kottayam

45
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,852
They've not yet
decided where to go

46
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,658
Either to Coimbatore
or to Kozhikode

47
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,933
They stay only in those places
which begin with 'Ko'

48
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,335
- Why?
- To match their name cobra

49
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,841
Hmmm...look at them
speeding towards a 'Ko'

50
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,648
Come to me, buddy
l too have a 'Ko' with me

51
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,190
Oh God! l think
they heard you

52
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,824
What? From so far away?

53
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,226
Being snakes, their sense
of hearing is powerful

54
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,281
Are these the cobras
you mentioned?

55
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,820
They look more like
worthless paper snakes

56
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,832
- ls coffee available?
- Yes

57
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,335
- Then serve us strong tea
- Okay

58
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,700
- Curry?
- Yes

59
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,933
Then first you scrape
away the curry(soot)

60
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,238
Wash well and
then get us tea

61
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,550
By the way, l hope you
have recognized us

62
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,987
-Are you the cobra...?
- lt's not cobra, Gobra

63
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,891
Our names begin
with 'Go' and 'Bra'

64
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,361
This is Gopalan
and l am Bralan

65
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,365
Bralan? What sort
of a name is that?

66
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,493
The actual name is Balan
Just for a change, Bralan

67
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,865
Remember? The song,
'vethyasthanam Balan'...?

68
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,738
We are the original cobras
Securities and P.R.O

69
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,510
These cobras do not like
to blow their own trumpets

70
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,444
So they pay us a salary

71
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,277
And get us to talk
about their deeds

72
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,181
Oh just like Panan the poet
sang ballads about the valor of

73
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,516
...legendary warriors
of Puthuran veedu

74
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,680
Panan used to walk
around and sing

75
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,656
We fly around in the alc car and sing

76
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,956
That is why they've given us
this car worth nearly a million rupees

77
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,156
Paid up road tax
and insurance also

78
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,731
lf you guys have a car like this
what would the cobras have?

79
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,532
No chance!
They never travel in alc cars

80
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,765
They throw up

81
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,866
No! Humility!
Ultimate humility

82
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,877
That is 'cobras'

83
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,206
ls this some poetic story narration
for you to beat the cymbal?

84
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,646
Oh! lt wasjust
a sudden enthusiasm

85
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,014
Ah! There's no need for
such enthusiasm, okay?

86
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,379
Friends!

87
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,512
Oh goodness! My throat too
seems to be afflicted

88
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,181
Don't bother about that

89
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,259
We are enjoying
the narration, isn't it?

90
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,487
- Gobran, continue with your story
- Come on, tell

91
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,655
Go on...
lt's very interesting

92
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,660
True, l have always known...

93
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,532
...there was an actor
sleeping within me

94
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,400
Why do you say that?

95
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,997
Many times there's a snore
from within my abdomen

96
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,667
- That's only flatulence!
- Bralan!

97
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,244
Your comments
are crossing limits

98
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,142
Sir, please continue

99
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,239
Okay
Now look there

100
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,148
Hello! Here
This is where you must look

101
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,155
ln poetic story narrations, look there
actually means to look here

102
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:21,226
This is the most
beautiful city of Delhi

103
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,452
This is where we see
the faces of our cobra

104
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,122
...forthe very 1st time

105
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,427
But cobras stay only in places
beginning with 'Ko'

106
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,024
Where is 'ko' in Delhi?

107
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,503
Who says there is no 'ko' in Delhi?
Delhi has its own 'ko'

108
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,972
That's the one
in the heart of the city

109
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,670
Cradled in natural beauty,
'Connate place'

110
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,646
lt is Connaught place

111
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:49,043
Hey Buji! lt's just a matter
of lengthening a vowel, isn't it?

112
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,589
Excuse that mistake
Go on, you continue

113
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,158
Yes, Connaught place

114
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,854
And l am taking you to
this Connaught place

115
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,421
Come, let's go on a tour

116
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,400
Aiyo! l am not coming
l must go to school

117
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,527
- Go away, kid
- You get lost

118
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,729
You continue, dude

119
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,034
Connaught Place

120
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,871
Those days they were
the Connaught Brothers

121
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,970
The ones who knew the secret
tricks and trade of the city

122
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,309
Cobra

123
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,318
This is King Cobra
(Rajavembala)

124
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,514
We can call him Raja

125
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,393
This is the Black cobra
(Karimoorkan)

126
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:49,531
We can call this
dark fellow Kari

127
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,355
- Brother...blood!
- What?

128
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,760
Blood!

129
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,932
Stop! Stop!

130
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,103
Hey! He's the winner
Winner!

131
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,657
Blood in turn for
my brother's blood

132
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,835
Murder for murder!

133
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,813
Death-frenzy!

134
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,836
Thank you

135
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,463
Oh! l'm so tired

136
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,565
Hey! Get me
a soda with fizz

137
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,204
Are these cobras
really brothers?

138
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,214
That's what they claim, twins

139
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,841
But since we are all blessed
with some normal intelligence

140
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,977
...we know it is highly unlikely

141
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,490
Would a milk chocolate and dark chocolate
be made in the same mould?

142
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,395
- What the hell?!
- Soda

143
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,427
- Give it here
- Scat!

144
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,555
Are these cobras married?

145
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:10,863
lt was one of their most
intense desires to get married

146
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,303
- Once upon a time...
- Hey, don't start the story yet

147
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,304
- Hey soda?
- Yes?

148
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,806
Do you know
how to use a cymbal?

149
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,500
Of course!

150
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:23,411
These cobras did not have any conditions
about how their future brides should be

151
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,043
They never insisted on not
being gifted a heavy dowry

152
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,485
They never insisted the girl
shouldn't be very beautiful

153
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,120
They weren't particular the girls
should have buck teeth

154
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,921
But they insisted
only on 1 condition

155
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,121
- Only 1 condition!
- What was that?

156
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,098
The girls should be siblings

157
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,768
Why did they want that?

158
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,669
To give more power,
weight and punch

159
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,103
...to the name cobra

160
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,105
What?

161
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,608
- You didn't understand, right?
- No

162
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,774
lf they married siblings
what would their relationship be?

163
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,506
What will it be?

164
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,048
- Cobres
- Chey!

165
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,948
Not cobres
Co-brothers!

166
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,715
- Darn good cymbal!
- Thank you

167
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,416
Yes, now cobra
has a deeper meaning

168
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:11,394
That was how much
they loved that name

169
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,294
See! lt's the truth
Did you hearthe lizard twitter?

170
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,127
That was me

171
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,461
Oh it was a dog
that twittered

172
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,625
Dirty fellow!

173
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,169
Did these cobras finally
get their sibling brides?

174
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,671
They did!
ln fact, many times

175
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,207
As the proposals reached
to almost being finalized...

176
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,673
...we all know, what these
Malayalis around them do

177
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,041
They spread rumors
about the cobras

178
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,808
That they were trouble makers,
wrestlers, good-for-nothing etc., etc...

179
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,008
So all alliances broke off

180
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,709
Finally one came through

181
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,844
Well matched and with
all conditions fulfilled

182
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,353
2 sisters

183
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,052
A week before they tied
the knot in the church...

184
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,790
...to avoid any kind of hitches
they even registered their marriages

185
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,496
The day finally arrived
safe with all precautions

186
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,198
The day cobras wedded

187
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,606
The day cobras
became co-brothers

188
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,575
That beautiful day dawned

189
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,147
They became
Kothamangalam brothers

190
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,683
Kothamangalam
St Nicholas Church

191
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:17,124
Bro, we don't have any relations
from our side of the family

192
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,093
Bro, why do we need relatives?

193
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,132
You are my relative
and l am yours

194
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,701
- Poison is never needed in large measures
- So you think just 2 of us suffice?

195
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,702
You can start walking, sir
Come

196
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,707
Bro, do we have only
this flower shower?

197
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,741
Shouldn't we have arranged
for Punjabi melam?

198
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,506
- Band with drums, etc
- Oh! You mean Panjara melam?

199
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,378
Ah yes! Only then
will it look good on T.V

200
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,644
Okay, we'll see
what can be done

201
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,446
Hey you! Come here

202
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,152
Did you coverthis
in slow motion?

203
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,984
- No
- Oh! What a pity

204
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,717
- Do you really want all that, sir?
- Of course we do, dude

205
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,918
Only then will it be
like college life

206
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,257
You do what l say
Record it once again

207
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,261
Come

208
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,858
Now take it and see
that it's in slow motion

209
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,732
And look, in slow motion
it should be slow like this...

210
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,862
...then speed up
like this alternately

211
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,099
That's the fashion these days

212
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,198
l'll create all those later on
You just walk now

213
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,776
Okay, now take

214
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,448
Look they've arrived

215
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,579
Brother, your Rosy looks good
All dressed and decked up

216
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,817
But where ls your girl?
Where is your bride, Gracie?

217
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,887
Hey!

218
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,532
- Where is my brother's bride, Gracie?
- That's what l've come to tell you about

219
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,431
The 2 brides started out
from their homes together

220
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,527
- Who?
- The brides

221
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:37,575
This bride with her parents in one car
The other, in a 2nd car with herfriends

222
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,578
And nothing, except that only
1 car has reached here

223
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,807
We have no clue
where the other bride went

224
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,042
Bralan has gone in search

225
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,812
- What the heck is this?
- Bro, don't get upset

226
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,251
Sister probably went
for some tuition

227
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,948
Why, is she facing a math exam
to go for tuition?

228
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,548
- Just wait she'll be here soon
- What's there to wait?

229
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,788
l have waited so long
Bro, we are getting older

230
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,796
Yes, time has gone away!

231
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,636
- Sir?
- What is it?

232
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,637
- lt's a matter of urgency
- What is it, dude?

233
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,866
Please come with me
lt's pretty urgent

234
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,076
What?
Tell us what happened?

235
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,806
That girl was in love
with someone it seems

236
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,975
- You vagabond, nonsense!
- Wait, let me ask

237
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,814
What's all this, dude?

238
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,684
She's not in love with me
So why did you hit me?

239
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,815
There must be someone else
They have eloped

240
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,483
Who told you this news?

241
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,256
No one told me
l simply assumed it could be so

242
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,322
You assume nonsense
like this, is it? You dog!

243
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,362
Calm down

244
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,027
There's something
in what he says

245
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,604
l too felt this

246
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,367
l kept quiet to avoid
the blows, that's all

247
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:47,002
Now that the beating session is over
this is obviously what has happened

248
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,509
Brother!

249
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,083
Sir?
What is this?

250
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,625
- Hey brother, don't be like this
- Everything is gone

251
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,027
- Where the heck are you going?
- l am going to sit right here

252
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,656
Now where will l sit?

253
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,102
lt's nothing brother

254
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,036
- We'll get another girl
- When and where?

255
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,938
We will get
We will

256
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,944
- When in heavens will it happen!?
- When...if you ask me...?

257
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,105
We'll definitely get 1
Don't be upset

258
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,715
Bro, our age is increasing

259
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,218
Even if it does,
how much can it increase?

260
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,083
That's true

261
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,316
Sir! Please smile a bit

262
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,392
What kind of a smile is this?

263
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,691
- Sir, why don't you smile a bit?
- Get lost! You pig

264
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,994
What the heck is this?

265
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,093
You just go away
l'll explain everything

266
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,899
Brother?
Eh?

267
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,065
Please say something and...

268
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,244
Look, there is no use
expecting that girl any more

269
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,372
Everybody says at least
let 1 of the weddings be conducted

270
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,074
We have to be quick
Father has to leave for a funeral

271
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,085
- Not necessary
- Then the corpse will decay

272
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,120
l did not mean that, you corpse!

273
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,487
Listen, there's an announcement

274
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,129
This wedding is cancelled

275
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,098
There is no need to
perform 1 wedding alone

276
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,898
We had decided
we'd get married together

277
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,602
Now that 1 is broken off
we don't want the other also

278
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:31,079
Sir, this is going to affect
the future of that young girl

279
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,619
No, the future and past of anyone
is not my concern

280
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,616
My brother is most important to me
Everything else comes after that

281
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,688
Please don't jump and
take such a decision

282
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,318
Whether we jump or notjump
you be quiet

283
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,919
lf this wedding is called off
it means it is cancelled!

284
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,124
This is my brother's decision
That's all

285
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,732
What do you say, bro?

286
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:56,931
Bro? Don't we mean 'that's all'?
Then come, lets go

287
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,821
Ah! Look the other
bride has come!

288
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,648
Where were you?

289
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,716
Please forgive us

290
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,727
She went to see an old teacher
to get her blessings

291
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:22,391
Teacher suddenly turned seriously ill
We admitted her in a hospital and came

292
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,799
- So sweet!
- She scared us all!

293
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,361
- Now let's not waste time
- Father has to leave for the funeral

294
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,667
l should have waited
for awhile at least

295
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,265
You mean, the corpse?
Of course it can wait

296
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,606
No, l made to face so many
accusations and decisions

297
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,340
Oh, that's okay
Anybody else would say the same

298
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,075
- Yes
- You come now

299
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,684
Hello

300
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,496
Did the teacher die?

301
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,492
Oh l see she didn't, sorry!

302
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,431
Teachers died
when l was young, too

303
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,511
Today you, tomorrow you...

304
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,849
- Father, son and the holy ghost...
- Come my dear, lets go

305
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,717
l don't want this
wedding to take place

306
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,214
Will this turn into a fiasco?

307
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,291
What are you saying, my dear?.

308
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,829
l said l don't want to

309
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,726
l don't agree
to this marriage

310
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,734
He says his brother
is everything to him

311
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,137
He said my future
didn't matter to him

312
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,909
l don't want a blasted life
with such a man

313
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,189
Sorry, you don't worry
Let me talk to her

314
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,453
Thoma'cha
No

315
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,388
She has a valid point

316
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,265
What he said
was a little too much

317
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,467
Brother, friends...are all good enough

318
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,604
But the relationship
between a husband and wife

319
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,733
...is so precious and strong

320
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,769
Since so much has happened
let us stall this wedding

321
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,179
Talk to the girl
Get her acceptance

322
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,773
Afterthat we'll go ahead with it

323
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,448
Forthe time being
let this wedding take place

324
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,717
What's this, bro?

325
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,660
Well...since Father says
to go ahead with this...

326
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:32,559
No

327
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:36,828
We are not conducting
1 wedding alone

328
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,360
- What do you say?
- But...

329
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,632
There are no buts

330
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,970
Father, the weddings
stand cancelled

331
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,406
You go take care
of the funeral

332
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,240
Otherwise this will also
start stinking like this

333
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,339
Come, bro

334
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:57,081
- Brother!
- Br...br...brothere

335
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,588
My age...?

336
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,656
COBRA VlHARAC

337
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,389
Alsatian Dogs
Beware!

338
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,664
Bro, come let's eat

339
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,672
Go and try

340
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,843
Look here, Kari sir

341
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,577
What's the point
in being upset like this?

342
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,312
This is not the last girl
on earth, is she?

343
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,318
lt may be a fact

344
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,912
...that you are more than a little dark
slightly in poor shape with all that booze

345
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,856
That doesn't mean, you'll never
find some girl who's willing

346
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,258
l'll kill you!
You pig!

347
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,262
l may say, l have
no color and glamour

348
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:43,027
But if someone else says it
l'll stab and take his intestines out

349
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,258
Vagabond!

350
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,633
Oh, now l am satisfied

351
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,273
- Mmm?
- l decided to stop

352
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,211
- Kari sir
- Eh?

353
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,209
Raja sir
You come and eat

354
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,875
lt's of no use brooding

355
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,477
Kari sir has neither
looks nor brains

356
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:08,025
You dare talk rubbish
about my brother?.!

357
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,658
l'll kick and
mash you to pulp!

358
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,892
Get up and
get lost, you...!

359
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,901
- What happened?
- l too stopped

360
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,597
- Both of you can leave
- Come, lets go

361
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,267
Bro, come and eat

362
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,575
l am not hungry

363
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,436
But l am hungry

364
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,978
Then you go eat

365
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,983
No one need wait for me
Let me be alone

366
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,585
Yes, its true

367
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,517
lt was wrong
but it happened

368
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,385
l had a dream that we'll get
married on the same day

369
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,755
And walk into this house
with our brides together

370
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,318
lf that dream was a mistake
you'll just have to forgive me, bro

371
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,957
- Look here?
- lt's not that

372
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,869
l will go talk to them
They will agree

373
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,941
lf not l will force them to agree

374
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,067
And if they still don't
l'll fall at their feet

375
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:03,273
Hey! What are you saying?

376
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,678
l will conduct it for sure

377
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,617
Even if l have to fall
at any donkey's feet

378
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,951
Otherwise what is the use of
calling myself your brother?.

379
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,016
Look, l have called only you 'bro'
Don't make me swear at you

380
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,722
What the hell are you saying?
Falling at someone's feet?

381
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,196
Beg forgiveness?
For what?

382
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,197
Ask them to get lost

383
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,427
My brother is most
important to me

384
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:28,630
Just because l blabber...

385
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,735
But don't you want to marry?

386
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,367
For what?

387
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,376
One at least?

388
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,969
l've got better work to do

389
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,378
Aren't you hungry?

390
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,682
- We are also hungry
- Then go lay the table

391
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:42,751
Come

392
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,394
Even though they were cobras

393
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,227
...at times they had the mentality
of harmless water-snakes

394
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,699
lf a water snake bites
we have to miss dinner (proverb)

395
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,793
Why do say such
unrelated things here?

396
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,804
lt was just a connecting
train of thought

397
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,874
Now where are those children?

398
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:04,771
What children?

399
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,503
Children come only
when a couple gets married

400
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,442
He's not meaning cobras' kids

401
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,207
He's enquiring about
the cobras themselves

402
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,339
Oh them!

403
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,145
After that incident
they just nipped it away

404
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,482
l meant the thought of marriage!

405
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:20,854
Not only that, after that disgrace
they ended their stay in that town

406
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,291
Hereafter, it's Coimbatore
Coimbatore brothers

407
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,760
We have to find a new house there
and a new business to set up

408
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,332
The 1st step towards that is
this journey we are undertaking

409
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,367
Ask them not to worry

410
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:35,804
Tell them they will get
2 girls, beautiful and gorgeous

411
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:45,049
Ah! This is an omen that the girls
will be truly stunning like lightning

412
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,913
lf there's lightning,
you can bet

413
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,919
...there'll be wind and
turbulence right behind!

414
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,722
John Samuel and his children

415
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,772
Judge grandpa, if you
have an opinion, say it

416
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:13,674
You've been drooling for quite some time
over the photos of those girls

417
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:18,438
l am not drooling, lsaac
Spinning...l'm spinning a web

418
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,450
What do you guys want now?

419
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:24,955
As the executor of Samuel hospital,
which has come up for auction...

420
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:30,426
...inviting bid for lease, l should
make sure you guys get it

421
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,358
For this, you want to know

422
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:35,899
...who your opponents
who've registered are, isn't it?

423
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,728
Yes

424
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,770
l will tell you
But only if l get this...

425
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,582
There isn't anyone
who's a threat opposing you

426
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,922
Only 1 person has registered
John Samuel

427
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,959
Who?
Him?

428
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,791
But, he's totally broke
and down in the dumps

429
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,524
Shouldn't he have money
to bid for the auction?

430
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,860
That's why l said

431
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,561
Superficially, there are
no contenders

432
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,899
But don't take it lightly

433
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,100
They can arrange for the money
seconds before the auction

434
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,676
There's plenty of time

435
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,670
What does he have
with him to sell?

436
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,838
Only that house
No one will buy that place

437
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,506
ln case someone comes
they won't buy it

438
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,051
We have manipulated such
that no one will buy it

439
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:32,849
But the planets are aligned
completely in favor of John Samuel

440
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,549
Grandpa, you need not
prophesy astrologically

441
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,889
Just let us know
the legal aspects

442
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:42,690
Who am l to talk legal matters?
These are just out of routine habit

443
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,894
Why am l a small
unimportant lawyer...

444
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,633
...called judge grandpa
by all, including you?

445
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,639
John Samuel will get money

446
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,176
That too his girls
will be the reason

447
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,552
Money is coming in
from the North...loads!

448
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,949
Be careful

449
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,824
Jesus
Take care of us

450
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,034
What happened to those people
intending to buy the house?

451
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,366
There is some
game going on, sir

452
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,497
They just say they are coming...

453
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,502
Go and see who it is

454
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,881
Oh...it's you?

455
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,453
Please sit

456
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,423
lt's true that we had
a slight altercation

457
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,225
...regarding the hospital auction

458
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,600
We made some
unnecessary comments

459
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,397
Please forget all that

460
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,169
We don't know if you are
taking part in this auction

461
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:01,234
lf so why compete?
Why don't we join hands in this?

462
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,038
How is it possible, dude?

463
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,479
Can a fox and a monkey
share a business deal?

464
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,217
Sorry

465
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,686
l meant myself
when l said monkey

466
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,759
l am a little stubborn
Pig headed, that's me

467
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,421
Okay let's not share
the business or deal

468
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,259
Why not life?

469
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:27,634
We've come to tell you that too
We would like to marry your girls

470
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,010
This alliance is a big strength
Both for you as well as for us

471
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,410
No, l am not for it
You can do as you please

472
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,947
But leave me alone
And my girls too

473
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,982
Sir...

474
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,144
Please
Goodnight

475
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,925
Sir, are you taking
part in the auction?

476
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,933
How can l?
Not that l don't want to

477
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,367
But it won't work out
Don't we need money for that?

478
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,663
lt will come
Money will come

479
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,438
Brother, stop please

480
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,638
Oh, where is the break?

481
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:11,949
What is it, bro?

482
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,483
Why not some tea?

483
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,687
2 strong tea
One, a bit light

484
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,793
Don't make that too light
Just a little less strong

485
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,054
Yeah, yeah

486
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,732
1 strong tea that's light
And 1 light tea that's strong

487
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,607
How far is it to
Coimbatore from here?

488
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,267
By car or by bus?

489
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,009
By jeep

490
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,273
lf it's by jeep about 50 km

491
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,384
Oh!
And by car?.

492
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,749
lt'll be more
Around 60 km

493
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,478
Oh good! We came
by jeep, right, bro?

494
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,721
Right!

495
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,817
Don't go
Please wait

496
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,338
Hey! Don't go
Stop the bus

497
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,599
Bro, where are you going?

498
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,504
Hey stop!

499
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,372
Hey! Stop the vehicle

500
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,507
Stop, l say

501
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,445
Stop the vehicle, l say

502
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,386
What is it?

503
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,116
Get out of my way, vagabond

504
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,619
Yes dude, that's it

505
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:29,920
What?

506
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,992
What's it, buddy?

507
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,393
No...no...
Wrong person

508
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,932
l am not who
you thought l was

509
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,159
ls he nuts?

510
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,504
Chey!

511
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,595
Sorry!

512
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,341
Making fools of us
Get going, right!

513
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,136
What was the issue, bro?

514
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,913
l mistook him for someone else

515
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,110
Haven't you given up
even after so many years?

516
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,083
Don't you have
anything better to do?

517
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:56,983
Oh be quiet, bro!

518
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,817
- How much?
- Rs 10

519
00:35:59,023 --> 00:35:59,990
Where are you going now?

520
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,358
- To pay for the tea
- No, l'll pay for it

521
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,392
No, it is alright, l'll pay

522
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,485
l insisted on drinking tea
So l'll pay for it

523
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,655
Well...l ordered the tea
So l'll pay for it

524
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,528
- Hey don't make this an issue
- You don't make this an issue

525
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,658
lt's a question of my insult

526
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:14,329
l'm sure you
meant self-respect?

527
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,996
Who are you to say that?

528
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,444
You don't have to interfere in
issues between us brothers, okay?

529
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,974
What's it, bro?
You want to pay, right?

530
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,074
You are so stubborn
Go ahead and pay

531
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,813
Are you upset?

532
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,947
No

533
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,596
Take

534
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,991
- Only Rs 10?
- That's what you said

535
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,227
That was forthe tea

536
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,304
Who's going to pay
for wrecking this shop?

537
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,303
How much will that cost?

538
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,737
That will be 10...
l mean Rs 3500

539
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,829
That brother will pay

540
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,906
What?
Why Me?

541
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,001
- Well! You started the issue
- But you blew it up

542
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:55,737
l won't pay

543
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:56,778
- Won't you?
- No

544
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,813
- Won't you?
- No, l won't

545
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,314
No?

546
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,577
Okay, okay

547
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,175
But forthe next problem
you'll have to pay

548
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,151
- Sure?
- Sure!

549
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,983
Oh well! All these
are ego hassles

550
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,152
- Wasn't what l said correct?
- Undoubtedly! lt's the absolute truth!

551
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,724
One, two, three, four

552
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,309
Quite good
Splendid agricultural work

553
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,472
- What does that mean?
- Vaastuhaara

554
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,810
- What?
- Carpentry, my dear bro

555
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,288
We can blindly give
4 crore, isn't it bro?

556
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,862
lf we give blindly, we'll go
wrong in calculations, bro

557
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,363
That's not what l meant, bro
Can we give 4 crore for this?

558
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,934
- lt's a loss even if we pay 5 crore
- What? A Loss?

559
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,229
...to the owner

560
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,102
Bro, how would it look
in a bright red coat of paint?

561
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,603
- lt will be too simple
- ls it?

562
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,008
Suppose we paint
the windows a bright yellow?

563
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,876
That's a good idea

564
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,471
They have aristocratic lineage

565
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,743
Oh, that doesn't matter

566
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,250
They are giving it off
out of desperation

567
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,320
Desperation and difficulties
should be a must in the world

568
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,513
When we landed up
with riches and cars

569
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,680
...every other vagabond
too has prized possessions

570
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,691
- That is not fair, bro
- Yes, global recession

571
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,384
What?

572
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,359
Samathalathanduldhavastha!
(global recession)

573
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,124
John sir, they have come

574
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,134
Ah! Come in

575
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,298
Who is that?

576
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,564
That is John Samuel, sir
House ownership

577
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,331
Meaning?

578
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,566
The captain of
this sinking ship

579
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,041
Oh! Sinking ship

580
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,704
What's the difference between
a ship and a sinking ship?

581
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,306
They first build a ship
Then they float it in water

582
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,079
lf it goes under
it is a sinking ship

583
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,949
lf it floats
it is a floating ship

584
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,281
Correct

585
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,356
l asked to know
if you knew

586
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,119
- Oh God!
- You are so well informed

587
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,657
l was asked to conduct a show
Ashwamedham for Kairali TV

588
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,457
l did not go
l have better things to do

589
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,929
- Really?
- Really!

590
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,964
For example think
of your name!

591
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,860
- ls it an lndian name?
- Yes

592
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,631
- Male
- Yes

593
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,367
-Alive
- Yes

594
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,934
The movie which brought Kerala
to international levels

595
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,343
lf you dive into the history
of Malayalam cinema...

596
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,006
The first talkie

597
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,483
lf anyone asks us
we will say your name

598
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,520
Yes
That is Balan

599
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,816
Correct!
Truly, you are a genius

600
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,150
Dining

601
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,353
Bro, how is it?

602
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,819
Very much...not bad

603
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,422
This is the room
where for the 1st time

604
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,763
...Sir had breakfast with his wife

605
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,302
Oh l see, it is used

606
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,134
Dude, show them
the other rooms

607
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,578
This is the guest bedroom
This is the room where...

608
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,374
Stop! Stop!

609
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,813
Didn't this sir's wife do anything finally
instead of all first times?

610
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,645
Yes, she did
Look at that fan

611
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,744
That is where she hung
and died for the last time

612
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,016
Oh dead end!

613
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,715
Where is the toilet?

614
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,127
Sherin committed suicide

615
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,391
She had mental
hallucinations

616
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,691
- Oh, l see
- Meaning?

617
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,929
A kind of madness in the mind

618
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,504
Many stories went around

619
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,664
That l'd killed her
and hung her there

620
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,900
That there were ghosts here

621
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,307
l am not hiding anything
Please think over it carefully

622
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,471
- These ghosts...?
- No

623
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,480
Okay, it's quite good

624
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:22,243
The house even
if its old is good

625
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:22,910
...the land is also okay

626
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,988
The house, land, ghosts
and everything else

627
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,386
Tell me honestly,
what should l pay?

628
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,651
About the price...
what shall l say?

629
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,420
Okay, we will fix it

630
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,322
Totally we'll fix it for 2

631
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,831
2 crores, Kaun Banega
crorepathi (TV show)

632
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,128
- l won't say price is less
- Didn't l tell you?

633
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:41,432
But my need is 3 crores

634
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,632
Also 6 months for my children
to complete their course

635
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,676
- For that period...
- Then you needn't stop with that

636
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,870
Till they complete their course,
arthritic problem you might face

637
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,038
...the medical expenses it might incur
and the expenses of...

638
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,241
...the entire work force of this place
we shall bear, what about it?

639
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,544
This is just like
bro's earlier comment

640
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:55,949
- What was that word?
- Recession!

641
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,145
Yes, that is it!

642
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,855
Wait!
Let's do something

643
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,188
- Let's fix it for 2.5
- Why, bro?

644
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,457
Let it be, poor guy
Think it over and decide

645
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,155
Let uncle decide

646
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,108
Are you packing?

647
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,837
l told you to call us
only if it was a favorable deal

648
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,003
Wasted efforts!

649
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,136
His ridiculous price

650
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,407
And to top it,
a basketful of liabilities

651
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,313
Leave it sir, he's educating
his 2 children to become doctors

652
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,854
Let him, we have no objection
But why should we suffer for it?

653
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,423
Suppose we are
afflicted by piles...

654
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,821
...will these moron doctors
treat us free of cost?

655
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,017
Hmmm...assistant?

656
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:39,687
They may not but
those girls definitely will

657
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,059
Girls? Who are they?

658
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,429
l did not mean
some vague girls

659
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,595
l meant seeing them
your eyes will pop out

660
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,435
See, your eyes
popped out

661
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,175
- Who are they?
- Yes, who indeed?

662
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,801
- Who are they, dude?
- Who is it?

663
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:55,936
You idiot!
Tell me who they are

664
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,206
Annie and Shirley

665
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,374
- Who are they?
- Who are they?

666
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,111
- Who are they, dude?
- Yes, who are they?

667
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,447
Tell us

668
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,350
Annie and Shirley

669
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,581
Who are they...is
what we are asking

670
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,782
Mr John Samuel's girls

671
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,724
They are ladies!

672
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,661
Studying medicine in Bangalore
They are Mr John Samuel's daughters

673
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,287
What do you think?
Valuable assets, aren't they?

674
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,195
But he's not selling them
lt's only the house that's on sale

675
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,032
Of course the deal is on the house
But it is to educate these poor girls

676
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,039
That poor man is selling
that poor looking house

677
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,473
Since it's only after
that poor man sells

678
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,306
...that poor house, he can
educate those poor girls

679
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,903
And finally get them married off

680
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,108
Then why can't you
buy the poor man's house?

681
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,778
So that he educates those poor girls
And then get those poor girls

682
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,152
...to marry you poorfellows?

683
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,922
Come again?

684
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,224
Look, they are 2 of them
grown up together

685
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,699
With similar education
and resemblance too

686
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,301
lt is God who has guided you
to this place for your marriage

687
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,342
...on the same day
at the same venue

688
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,744
'That will end the cows itch
and appease the crows hunger'

689
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:05,712
What do you say?

690
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,374
But for that...

691
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,678
Which one?

692
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,583
You can choose
whomever you want

693
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,282
No arguments
Both are good, aren't they?

694
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,187
But shouldn't MrJohn agree?

695
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,825
He will agree

696
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,055
ln a sense
they are also like you

697
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:21,995
You mean they drink?

698
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,066
No, not that

699
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,294
They are also finding it difficult
to get good marriage proposals

700
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,565
Mother was insane and she hung herself
This's the reason fortheir single status

701
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,664
Poor girls
Grieving father

702
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,770
Not only, he's quite
fed up with 2 rowdies

703
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,608
...harassing him to get
the girls married to them

704
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,742
Forget the father
Shouldn't the girls like us?

705
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,012
How can they not like you

706
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,815
Sir, your case does not
have any problem

707
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,514
But this sir...

708
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,285
What is lacking in me,
you vagabond?

709
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,290
Nothing lacking

710
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,486
Just a black moustache,
black hair, black...

711
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,220
Let me see it

712
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,460
What is wrong with you?

713
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,926
Bro, what do say?

714
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,759
Nothing doing!
He's trying to sell his house

715
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,668
He won't have any money with him

716
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,365
Why should he have money?

717
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,534
We have more
than enough, don't we?

718
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:07,639
lt's not that

719
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,042
Are they too short?

720
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,638
Why do they need to be tall?
Both of us have enough height

721
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,343
But l feel they are
a bit too young

722
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:16,043
Oh! That's not a problem

723
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,383
They may be just about
10 years younger

724
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,480
After 5 years it will reduce
to 5 years, isn't it?

725
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,491
- That's not a problem
- That's true

726
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,493
After 10 years
we will be same age

727
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,290
- Yes
- Then, it's okay

728
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:30,993
So after 20 years will these kids
be 10 years older than them?

729
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,092
Oh! To hell with it!

730
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:38,004
Bro, then shall we fix it?
Yes, let's fix it right?

731
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,782
Agreed
Accepted

732
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,284
Here's the cheque
No condition

733
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,049
- Your price and
-All your conditions

734
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,791
But, my children...?

735
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,622
Sure, the price
includes them also

736
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:58,626
What?

737
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,457
lt's okay with us

738
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,060
You can ask your
children and decide

739
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,498
But don't delay it
Fix the price

740
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,295
lt's not that

741
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,633
l have not told them
that l am selling this house

742
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,798
Why? ls the house
in their names?

743
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,967
No, the house and
land is in my name

744
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,569
But if they come to know
that l am selling it fortheir sake

745
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,612
...they will be very upset

746
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,182
They might even
discontinue their course

747
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:20,113
...and come back here

748
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,482
They have another 6 months to
complete their course

749
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,778
Bro, do you understand
what this implies?

750
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,221
Registration will take place
only after 6 months

751
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,087
lsn't that correct?

752
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,286
We will proceed as decided...

753
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:34,159
...but let it be kept
a secret for 6 months

754
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,288
And bear the inconvenience

755
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,333
Oh! To bear with them...
Understood

756
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,129
After paying you the money
the house registration is done...

757
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,295
...and once the house
is in their names

758
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,806
...they have to live with you
for 6 months, right?

759
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,509
But how will they do that?

760
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,011
And if they cannot
l definitely cannot

761
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,138
lf you are in their place
will you be able to?

762
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,977
lf you are able to
then say so

763
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,946
We understand the hurt
you are going through mentally

764
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,281
We also have
the medicine to heal that

765
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,354
Continue, sir

766
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:01,288
You want a particular sum of money
for which you are selling the house

767
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,791
But the children should not know it
lsn't that correct?

768
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,193
We will give you the money

769
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,287
Registration cannot be
kept a secret

770
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,296
The news may
somehow leak out

771
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,526
lf your children come to know
they will be upset

772
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,035
And if they are upset
we will be upset

773
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,204
We have trust in you

774
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,137
So we won't register now

775
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,273
But how...

776
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,278
lt's nothing

777
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,110
No one need know
about anything!

778
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,776
But till then we will
live here with you

779
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,419
What?

780
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,352
On rent

781
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,354
Eh?

782
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,685
The top floor of the house
is vacant, isn't it?

783
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,293
You are all alone

784
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,827
We'll keep you company
in your old age

785
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,296
And you'll get Rs 2000 as rent
You can tell this to everyone

786
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,457
What do you say?

787
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,931
- But won't it be inconvenient to you?
- No, of course not

788
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,664
We have played many roles in life
This is just another one

789
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:53,573
lt's all for a good cause
lsn't this what we call college life?

790
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,113
Thank you

791
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,043
l don't know how
to show my gratitude

792
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:01,947
No thanks

793
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,043
God has brought you
to my doorstep

794
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,416
- l love you
- l too

795
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,683
Bro, if you are done, come out
ls this some kind of a love scene?

796
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,687
Bro, how can you sulk like this?

797
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,059
My dear bro, is it possible to decide
everything with everyone, every time?

798
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,156
Bro, don't say a word

799
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,668
You have played
a dirty game here

800
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,338
With what surety did you
give him everything?

801
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,668
lt was a thought that
God threw at me in that minute

802
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:26,606
Didn't it work successfully?

803
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,905
Of course it did
Bro, your smartness worked

804
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,675
Now he thinks you are God
He says God brought you to him

805
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,343
When he says you
it means both of us

806
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,784
But he hugged only you

807
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,685
Hey don't say such things

808
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,883
lf he hugged me
it's as good as hugging you, right?

809
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:42,481
- ls that so?
- Yes, of course

810
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,458
But why didn't l see it
when we drank last night?

811
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,998
When he was pouring out drinks
you said equal to only the 2 of you

812
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,431
- ls this like drinking?
- Don't tell me anything more

813
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,299
Everything will turn out beautifully
l am convinced

814
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,599
Look, if you are still doubtful
l will go get it back

815
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,304
Shall l?
Shall l go get it?

816
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,942
No

817
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,750
Not if you are surely convinced
But are you really sure?

818
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,877
Yes, surely, in 2 more days
when our things come

819
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:14,287
...we can shift
to that house

820
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,652
We tell Mr John
frankly what we think

821
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,355
He will jump with joy

822
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,295
Run and hug
his children and say...

823
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,391
...here are the two who
helped him in a crisis in life

824
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,402
And lots of things
about our generous hearts

825
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,098
About us 2 handsomest of men

826
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,272
What?

827
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,434
Handsomest men?
Didn't you like it?

828
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:36,677
Okay

829
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,112
They are minds full of love
becomes beautiful

830
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,773
They will accept

831
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,853
Then Mr John totally surprised
will come to meet us

832
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,748
- Will he come?
- He will

833
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,094
- Surely?
- Very sure

834
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,855
Coming soon

835
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,526
There should have been
a song here, bro

836
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,927
Bro, let's stop
this booze habit

837
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,440
Will we not become bad natured?

838
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,271
- Then shall we lessen it?
- Okay

839
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,406
We have to stop
many of our bad habits

840
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:15,577
lndiscriminate beating, punching...
And then we should start farming

841
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:16,849
What farming?

842
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,316
What aboutjaathi (caste)?
A big estate full ofjaathi (nut-meg)

843
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,986
But they say jaathi (caste}
should be only one

844
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,425
Then something else
What do you say?

845
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:30,932
TRUE

846
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,662
We have to go in for
1 or 2 good farming (husbandry)

847
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:42,242
- Bro, will that John sir cheat us?
- Of course not

848
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:47,616
- Will those girls end up not liking us?
- Noooo...

849
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,084
- Are you sure?
- Sure

850
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,923
Okay then, good night
Jesus!

851
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:02,693
God! Now l am sleepless
With unnecessary doubts and questions

852
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,897
Bro, seeing you've lost sleep
l am at peace and feeling very sleepy

853
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,801
Look you've to get up
early for exercise

854
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,463
Try to get some sleep

855
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,156
ls it morning already?

856
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,060
Bro, 1st church bell rang
Come let's go and exercise

857
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:38,633
- Bro, you do my share also
- Then tomorrow you have to do mine

858
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,366
Jesus
Make my muscles bulge, please

859
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,603
This is for me
This is for bro

860
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,481
Which vagabond has come
so early in the morning?

861
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:08,859
Haven't you slept yet?
Must be celebrating your victory right?

862
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,499
l don't understand

863
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,229
Aren't you John Samuel's sponsors?

864
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,033
Okay, so who are you now?

865
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,903
l am lsaac and he is Albert
We are known as rowdies

866
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:21,875
Oh l see

867
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,605
Then rowdies just go away
l need to sleep

868
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,645
You can sleep here

869
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,774
But don't try to sleep there
in John's house

870
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,283
Well we heard about it

871
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:33,755
2 girls reside there
They may be ours, one day

872
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,786
Just get out
Are you threatening me?

873
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,359
Who is it, bro?

874
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,486
lt's them, bro

875
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,463
Those guys out to get
Mr John's daughters

876
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:43,658
Remember what
that guy told us?

877
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,699
Those terrible rowdies!

878
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,669
lf you say nonsense...

879
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,302
What's all this?

880
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,672
They claim they'll reshape us

881
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:59,309
Get out...you!
Let him go

882
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,980
- Get lost
- Go sleep

883
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,393
What's it?

884
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,301
Wait stop

885
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,060
What happened?

886
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:22,735
Did your eyes
pop out seeing bro?

887
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,797
Or did you think l was alone?
l can very well deal with you alone

888
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,738
Come, buddy...

889
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:30,276
Sorry...that is...
What's your name?

890
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,948
Brother's name?

891
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,515
Rajinikanth!
Didn't you notice his style?

892
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:37,747
Get going, dude!
Drunk and blind also

893
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,415
Come, bro

894
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,926
What is it, brother?
What's the issue?

895
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,588
No, it's nothing

896
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,802
What happened, sir?
ls it under repair?

897
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,240
No, the vehicle is
in fine condition

898
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,709
Only 1 problem
lt is not starting

899
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,041
What's all this
in the vehicle?

900
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,581
Just a few dresses
and basic necessities

901
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,650
lt looks quite a big load

902
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,048
We had 4 times this

903
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,517
We just gave it
away to the poor

904
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,450
Donation

905
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:12,749
Come, come in

906
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,393
Why are you
standing there?

907
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,189
Come here

908
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,026
Hereafter l shouldn't
be inviting you in

909
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,099
You should be
doing it to me

910
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,732
l have finished the formalities
of registration of the house

911
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,767
Here

912
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,629
Why did you do this, sir?

913
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,501
We told you
it could be done later

914
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,404
Things should
never be postponed

915
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:37,674
ln the last 10 years,
l am happiest today

916
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,644
My dad and grandfather
used to run the hospital

917
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,015
Samuel's hospital

918
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,145
When it faced problems

919
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,190
...the Govt undertook
its administration

920
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:52,159
Now every 5 years
the executor auctions its lease

921
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,230
l had great ambitions
to take it on lease

922
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,026
And run it in a good way

923
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,726
But l have not been
able to till today

924
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:03,272
Every time Albert and lsaac
out bid me and took lease

925
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,102
Will you have a small?

926
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,438
- Just a small
- No

927
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,442
No, no!

928
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,311
That hospital is just a facade
for their nefarious activities

929
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,882
A secure cover

930
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,248
Today it's in my hands

931
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,514
And you guys are
responsible for it

932
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,382
l got it back with
the money you gave

933
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,321
Thank you

934
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,722
What are you saying, sir?

935
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,694
We are not strangers
for you to thank us

936
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,054
lt's been so long
since l drank like this

937
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,794
My daughters have advised me
not to overdo it

938
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,030
Doctors will say such things
lsn't this part of college life?

939
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,299
lsn't that correct, bro?

940
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,405
No! Papa you have
to consider your health

941
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,742
Papa! lt's good
being called that way

942
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,975
But l am not that old

943
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,143
Especially metabolic age, just 35

944
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:57,159
Look l used to be a gymnast
And also a free style boxer

945
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,423
These are the trophies
l got during my heydays

946
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:02,955
Really?

947
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,398
Why the snigger?
lt's nothing to be ashamed of

948
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,129
lt's a big art, dude

949
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,296
That's not the issue, papa
We also belong to that line

950
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,307
What? Boxing?

951
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,342
Really?

952
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,173
Sir, haven't you
heard of cobra?

953
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,076
ln Delhi the word
cobra sends shivers

954
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,240
- Not cobra, cobras!
- Sorry, cobras

955
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,648
They have
accumulated trophies

956
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,549
...for boxing as well as
hot punches

957
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,713
Punches?
Be quiet, l say

958
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,250
Getting punched
is not bad actually

959
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,827
Only on receiving 2
you get pleasure in giving 2

960
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,259
Oh so come to think of it

961
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,422
...you've become father-in-law
and sons-in-law

962
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,533
So cheers

963
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:49,038
This is our hospital
Samuel's hospital

964
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,113
Wonderful!
Eh?

965
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,111
Very frightening
to see it

966
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,204
Yeah, yeah

967
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,475
A doctor and 2 nurses
who come and go

968
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,486
...just for name sake

969
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,249
That's how it used to be
Just to fool people

970
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,016
Plenty of dust here

971
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,092
Then why did they run it?

972
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,184
Come, l'll explain

973
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,697
This used to be our
physical training centre

974
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,302
My dad was the main instructor

975
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,433
l too trained here

976
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,337
Later after lsaac
and group took over

977
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,540
...this became a hive
for immoral activities

978
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,517
Booze, women,
gambling, betting

979
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,086
And many other dirty activities

980
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,666
l feel terribly sad

981
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,204
My desire is to
repair the harm done

982
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,534
Come

983
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,876
Go on, ask him

984
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:34,215
Papa, can l ask you something?

985
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,909
Go ahead

986
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,716
- Shall we run that training centre?
- What?

987
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:43,254
Stop the car
Come on!

988
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,921
What did you say?

989
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,055
We came here
with the intention

990
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,599
...of starting some business

991
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,760
This is something
we are well versed

992
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,470
We'll do it in a good way
We are capable too

993
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:04,479
Shall we have a small each?

994
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,272
Oh my goodness!
l'm so excited!

995
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,817
When l am happy
l have to down a drink

996
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,683
Only then it is
a celebration!

997
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,154
Cheers

998
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,790
This is the 5th
No more cheers

999
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,794
You may not able
to sustain anymore

1000
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,330
Get lost, buddy
lt is with happiness

1001
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,868
Do you know l have
gained 2 children now?

1002
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,994
Children who know my mind

1003
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,562
You are my good fortune
You are my luck

1004
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:35,505
You are my dear most, dearest...
What's the word?

1005
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,276
Dirty fellow!
That's a swear word

1006
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:40,406
What is the word?

1007
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,508
- Sons-in-law
- Correct

1008
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:43,984
No!
Beyond that

1009
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,952
Far beyond all that

1010
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,888
Sweetie, please pour out
1 more peg for me

1011
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,619
Papa, please consider
your health also, okay?

1012
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,560
What health and what life!

1013
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,427
Didn't l educate
my children to this level?

1014
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,800
Now, l have to hand them over
to 2 good bride-grooms

1015
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:02,837
That's all l now desire

1016
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,500
Papa, what do you mean
by good bridegrooms?

1017
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,971
- They should be healthy
- Okay

1018
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,140
- Good hearted
- Okay

1019
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,480
Handsome

1020
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,519
Oh no!

1021
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,748
2 fantastic boys

1022
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,791
Oh God that's impossible!

1023
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,620
Hey dude!

1024
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,524
- Sir, beauty is not a disease
- lt's a curse

1025
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,119
Get lost

1026
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:28,925
Go, go

1027
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,930
We are going, okay?

1028
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:40,871
Papa, what is
your opinion about us?

1029
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:04,394
Very good drunkards, right?

1030
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,738
Papa, don't view us
as perpetual drunks

1031
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:18,578
That's alright, dude
Drinking is not wrong

1032
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,582
Especially when good people
like us get together

1033
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:28,613
l have a very serious
issue to tell you

1034
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,124
Very serious

1035
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,459
lf you don't like what l said
you should say so frankly

1036
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:40,763
What is it, papa?

1037
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,495
lt concerns my children

1038
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,907
How can l tell you this?

1039
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,504
- Tell us somehow
- Yes

1040
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:57,478
You guys are very good
and bachelors too

1041
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,847
- And anyway you...
-Anyway...what?

1042
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,823
Oh forget it
l will tell you later

1043
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:06,917
Papa, please tell

1044
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,620

01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:13,596
Please

01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,837
Please, papa...please

Oh no, not now
l will tell you later

1048
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:25,971
Here this should help you
get over your bashfulness

1049
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,745
- Now tell
- What about my health?

1050
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,510
You are healthy, more than
what's necessary

1051
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,622
Now drink it and tell

1052
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,484
What l was about to say was
the two of you...

1053
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:45,693
- No, l am not saying it now
- Now gulp this down and tell

1054
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,230
Jesus!

1055
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,371
Brother?

1056
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,172
Oh help me please!

1057
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,305
- Papa
- Papa

1058
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,745
Are you okay?

1059
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,844
ls there some problem?
You are okay, aren't you?

1060
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:05,579
Papa?

1061
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,256
What were you about to
tell us a short while ago?

1062
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,487
- Suppose l go lie down?
- No, before that

1063
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,155
Why don't l go lie down?

1064
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,959
Who will lie down
at this time of the day?

1065
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,934
- Before you lie down
- Oh! Before that l have to pee

1066
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:21,901
Not that papa

1067
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,062
You were about to
tell us something

1068
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:23,934
What was that?

1069
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,506
Do you also want to pee?
Go ahead and pee

1070
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,233
- Oh please tell Papa
- Who?

1071
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,674
- Tell us, Papa
- Where?

1072
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,075
- Tell, Papa
- Come on tell Papa, dude

1073
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,114
What?
Papa, dude?

1074
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:06,710
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast

1075
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:11,380
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings

1076
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:15,184
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing

1077
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,721
Two young men
to wed them are here

1078
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,722
What does he mean?

1079
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,088
We can't get him

1080
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,598
Can't you get him?
Poor P.R.O.s

1081
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,861
Brother!

1082
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:33,532
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast

1083
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:38,406
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings

1084
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:41,981
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing

1085
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,814
Two young men
to wed them are here

1086
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,615
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!

1087
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,397
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!

1088
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,894
Up there in heaven

1089
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,896
Yonder up there in heaven

1090
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,696
The Grand old man up there
has a little book

1091
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:39,036
ln that little book
is the past and future

1092
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:43,742
ln one of its pages
is divine tidings

1093
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:48,707
Now l have an inner call
to share its contents

1094
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,148
The names our Lord
declared for each other

1095
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,587
Now lies at the tip
of my tongue

1096
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:00,386
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!

1097
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:04,723
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!

1098
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:12,132
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast

1099
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:17,008
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings

1100
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:20,549
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing

1101
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:26,746
Two young men
to wed them are here

1102
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,581
Sir...wake up

1103
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:03,949
Not counting the many men
who exist here

1104
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:08,996
...truthfully how many
among them are suited best

1105
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,758
l hesitate to answer

1106
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:18,233
There are two in this world
who are meant to be

1107
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:22,402
With hearts beating a tattoo,
agreeing to the union they stand

1108
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,412
Just within the arc of my sight

1109
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:30,209
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!

1110
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:34,547
Wonderwho they are...
Tell us...Oh papa!

1111
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:41,886
There's a little nest
nestling within my breast

1112
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:46,728
ln that little nest
are two little nestlings

1113
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:50,269
Those nestlings now hear
wedding bells ringing

1114
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:59,505
Two young men
to wed them are here

1115
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,080
Oh! What fun!

1116
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,379
- What's happened to him?
- Papa?

1117
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,385
Get lost, you pork

1118
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,018
Bro, did you hear
what papa said now

1119
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,390
- Get lost, you pork!
- Keep quiet, you pig!

1120
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,057
Papa mentioned about
our marriage, didn't he?

1121
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,596
May be, but it was
not clear enough

1122
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,028
Papa

1123
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:24,396
Why don't you go sleep?

1124
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,440
Tomorrow when he wakes up
and is out of his stupor

1125
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:27,404
...we can find out
what he wanted to say

1126
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,408
- Get lost, you dog!
- Corpse!

1127
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,239
Sleep?

1128
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,245
How can he sleep like this
when we are burning with anxiety?

1129
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,372
Papa

1130
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,880
- l have a great idea
- What is that?

1131
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,550
There is a panacea to wake
people sleeping fully drunk

1132
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,550
What is that?

1133
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:43,919
Take a glass, pour a peg into it
Then pour 1 more peg of brandy

1134
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:45,618
Just give it to him
lmmediately his head will clear

1135
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:46,853
lnstead can we not
just give him 2 pegs?

1136
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,896
Then it will be a dry drink

1137
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,890
Sorry, you are correct
Shall we give it to him, sir?

1138
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,094
l don't care what you do
l have to know the news today

1139
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,170
We shall definitely know
if it's a yes or a no

1140
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,371
Take the tools, Bala

1141
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,461
- Tools?
- Bring the brandy

1142
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,335
Oh okay brandy, l will
be right back

1143
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:02,343
Papa

1144
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:19,087
Papa, open your mouth

1145
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,420
Careful!

1146
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,895
l wish we had a tube
lt'd have been so useful

1147
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:29,801
- Where to go for a tube now?
- Hey old man! Open your mouth

1148
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,564
Don't spill
even a drop

1149
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:36,739
Brother

1150
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,713
l'll give you
a good spanking, okay?

1151
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,087
Open his mouth

1152
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,060
All of you move aside

1153
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,396
Annie and Shirley, isn't it?

1154
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,903
Who are you?
Who the heck are you guys?

1155
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,399
l said who are you?

1156
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:13,408
Look, we are...
Brother

1157
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:19,881
When we were passing
by this way, we saw papa...

1158
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,886
- l mean we are his friends
- Friends?

1159
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,051
What were you
doing to him?

1160
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:29,357
When he over-ate during dinner
we thought we'd give him some juice

1161
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,123
- Papa?
- Juice?

1162
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,430
Yes, applejuice
Look at its color

1163
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,562
You thought it was brandy, right?
Fooled you!

1164
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,041
Shirley, papa is drunk

1165
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,946
- ls this juice?
-Apple juice

1166
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,648
Get out

1167
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,116
Get out, l say
Out, l said!

1168
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,726
Or should l call the police?

1169
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,356
Wait
Let me explain things

1170
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,456
We are tenants here

1171
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,000
What?
Tenants here?

1172
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:07,931
Yes, here on the 1st floor

1173
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,367
And each of us
pay a rent of Rs 1000

1174
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,107
When Mr John said his
daughters were in Bangalore

1175
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,468
...and all alone here,
we felt very sad

1176
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,238
Considering he's an old man
we shifted in here

1177
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:17,606
...to keep him company

1178
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:19,272
Agreed

1179
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:21,847
But is this what
tenants usually do?

1180
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:22,847
When a person
is already unconscious

1181
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,418
...do you give him more
and try to kill him?

1182
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,316
Was he unconscious?

1183
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,252
We never knew that at all!
lsn't that so, bro?

1184
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,718
Sorry

1185
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:32,319
Get out

1186
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:33,523
Get out

1187
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,688
What's this?
l am going

1188
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,861
Don't beat me

1189
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,058
Shirley, what are you doing?

1190
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:41,566
We are tenants

1191
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,938
When l say get out
it means out!

1192
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,371
Shirley, don't

1193
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,570
Don't close the door

1194
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,679
They shut the door also

1195
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:31,016
Bro, all the wood has arrived
Shall we start work today?

1196
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,120
Wait, don't start

1197
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,881
We ourselves are
quite worked up here

1198
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,388
Let things get
resolved here

1199
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:39,188
Mason, go and drink a strong
cup of tea and come

1200
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:46,792
There's no use
lying like this

1201
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:49,096
Now decide
what should be done

1202
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,269
Get lost

1203
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,143
Yesterday was a blunder

1204
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,112
Hereafter there won't
be any problems

1205
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,274
- Why? Did you go there?
- No, not that

1206
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,243
l was just thinking it over

1207
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,910
Yesterday there was some mistake

1208
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,622
lts only now that l remembered
there won't be a problem again

1209
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,554
Tell us, what it is,
you idiot!

1210
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:14,490
Remember we poured brandy into brandy
and gave it to him?

1211
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,564
l have to curse my memory
lt's actually not like that

1212
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,097
We must pour
curd into brandy

1213
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,258
lt struck me only now

1214
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:20,662
We'll never have
a problem again

1215
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:25,430
Aiyo!
l'll kill you today

1216
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,598
Aiyo!

1217
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:31,577
Hey wait! Wait!

1218
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:32,942
Tell me, what is the problem?

1219
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,240
There's nothing new

1220
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,443
Yesterday's problems are
continuing, that's all

1221
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:38,451
Sir!

1222
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,251
Don't go, wait

1223
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,916
l realized the girls had come
only when l woke up this morning

1224
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,788
So l came here
before they woke up

1225
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,486
l figured there
was a problem

1226
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,894
Actually what
happened last night?

1227
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,364
Without doubt
a complete mess!

1228
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,470
When you blabbered after
drinking yourself senseless...

1229
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:59,563
...Cobras thought you were planning
to get them married to your girls

1230
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:00,607
But by the time you
got around telling

1231
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,438
...you just conked off

1232
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,236
To get you to say it clearly
we tried some panacea...

1233
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:05,972
What?

1234
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,982
l mean, we fed
you a little brandy

1235
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,483
And your daughters walked in
That became a major issue

1236
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,552
Frankly, do you
remember...

1237
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:16,283
...even a word of what you
said last night? Any clue?

1238
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:20,856
True! l did say all that in
a state of unconsciousness

1239
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:26,162
Actually l wanted to tell them
all that when l was sober

1240
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:33,474
Look, l approve of you completely
But that's not enough

1241
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,042
They should like you

1242
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:38,272
For that you should be able
to try to get into their hearts

1243
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,348
And that's where
your smartness lies!

1244
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:41,646
What a marvelous dad!

1245
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,445
Where in heaven will you get
a father-in-law like this, guys?

1246
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,350
Forget how they'll
get to their hearts

1247
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,514
1st decide how you will
get into that house

1248
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,616
Hmmm...it is a problem
But no, actually it is not

1249
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,352
For the incident that
happened last night

1250
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,020
...l have to create
a counter story

1251
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,357
And get them to believe me

1252
01:13:56,465 --> 01:14:00,299
Do you know, l am not only ex-boxer
l am ex-writer, too

1253
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,629
l used to write stories and send
to Bala-lokam magazine

1254
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,500
l have even got
consolation prizes

1255
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,508
Now, l will create a story
to tell my girls

1256
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,373
...which will convince them
and l am very sure of this

1257
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,709
You just wait and
see my dear chaps!

1258
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,680
- Will he make it worse now?
- Of course

1259
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,786
No Papa! You don't have to
cook up some new tales

1260
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,050
After all we know
you very well, papa

1261
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:26,616
True Papa, when we came in
you were already unconscious...

1262
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,855
...and they were forcing you
to drink more booze

1263
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:33,464
Yes, but why?

1264
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,831
Have you bothered
to find out why?

1265
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,937
Did you?

1266
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:37,568
You haven't

1267
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,732
lf l am alive today
it's all due to them

1268
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,141
Do you realize that?
Do you know?

1269
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,440
What is it, papa
What happened?

1270
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:51,419
l'll tell you

1271
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:55,421
Yesterday, my college
classmate had come here

1272
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:56,455
College?

1273
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,455
When did you go
to college, Papa?

1274
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,193
l meant the friend
who'd studied in a college

1275
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,230
- What about it?
- What is his name?

1276
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:06,160
Plachimoottil Sashi
What about that?

1277
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:07,769
Continue, Papa

1278
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,095
And then...

1279
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,904
He is a compulsive
traveler, this Sashi

1280
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:20,581
During one of his travels
when he gave tobacco to a tribal

1281
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,674
...he got a gift in return

1282
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,047
- Papa?
- Yes?

1283
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,914
This katumootil Shashi

1284
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,185
lt is neither katumootil or aatukootil
lt is Plachimoottil Sashi

1285
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,056
Oh well, if you say
Plachi then so be it

1286
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,056
ls he also a tribal man?

1287
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,063
Okay enough
l'm not saying anything

1288
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:40,462
Shirley, be quiet
Papa, you continue

1289
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:41,967
l've lost the mood

1290
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:43,966
Okay, l'm not talking any more

1291
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,936
Do you know what the gift was?
A whole bottle of distilled liquor

1292
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:53,444
When he came here
he gave it to me and went back

1293
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,449
- Was it, back to the forest?
- Oh...

1294
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,512
Okay, okay...go on

1295
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,285
Last evening lost in
thoughts about you

1296
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:09,964
...as l was looking at this photo
somehow l felt the need to drink

1297
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:14,960
There on the table
was the bottle of alcohol...

1298
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,005
...Plachimootil Shashi had given
beckoning to me

1299
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:23,510
Being a gift from a friend
and being lonely without you

1300
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:27,676
...l drank just one mouthful
And after that...

1301
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,909
...l felt darkness
creeping into my eyes

1302
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,988
Electric waves in my head

1303
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,851
l fell down

1304
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:43,530
My children Annie, Shirley
Forgive me, l am dead

1305
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:49,002
They camejust on time
like angels sent by God

1306
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,661
Sir

1307
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,438
Oh God!
l wonder if its blood cancer

1308
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:55,601
Good Lord of Kottayam!
lt's the phone ringing

1309
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,271
- Hello! ls it the doctor?
- No

1310
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,242
- No?
- l am Plachimootil Sashi

1311
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,847
The drink which l gave
Mr John contains poison

1312
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:04,952
l came to know of it only now
Ask him not to drink it

1313
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,952
- Will you do the needful?
-Aiyo!

1314
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,382
Oh God! Please don't let
anything happen to our Mr John

1315
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:10,287
Who was it?

1316
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:12,723
Bro, that Plachimootil
Shashi called

1317
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,328
He says the liquor
he gave was poisonous

1318
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,657
Oh my God!

1319
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,095
Now who will look after
Shirley and Annie?

1320
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,064
- There's a way
- What way?

1321
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,133
Do you have cash with you?

1322
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,362
Yes, about 3 to 4 crores
But all in the bank

1323
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:24,404
And we cannot withdraw today
Today is a holiday

1324
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:25,803
- Oh it is today, isn't it?
- Yes it is

1325
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:26,999
Okay, there's another way out

1326
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,400
Look after him
Nothing should happen to him

1327
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,001
Give him last-aid
(first-aid) properly

1328
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,512
Oh, artificial air

1329
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,446
Oh God! This looks
like it's death by a bullet

1330
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,452
That too, to a vital organ
lt's a natural death

1331
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:42,890
- Look, give him this
- Here's the glass

1332
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,959
- What ls this?
- Don't you see? Brandy

1333
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:45,754
Now pour it out

1334
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,056
Oh so he's sick,
deprived of booze is it?

1335
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,323
Just feed him this

1336
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,967
lf you drink poisoned liquor
the best antidote is brandy

1337
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,760
l read this in the papers
while on my way back from Vypin

1338
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,202
Should it be given
before food or after food?

1339
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:02,833
lt was when they were struggling
to save my life that you came in

1340
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,002
Who are you guys?

1341
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,477
This is what actually
happened last night

1342
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,110
Best story!

1343
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,448
Why? You don't
believe me, do you?

1344
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,315
Shirley, be quiet

1345
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,386
Do you feel
any discomfort now?

1346
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,290
- Yes...
- Oh my!

1347
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,797
My dear foolish sister,
did you believe this stupid story?

1348
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,232
- Don't say anything anymore
- Yes, my dear

1349
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:31,066
lf l cut open and show my heart
she'll only say it's a red shoe-flower

1350
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,834
l am totally upset
l want to lie down

1351
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:37,467
Papa, please don't over act
And bring illnesses which don't exist

1352
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:39,842
l believe you, enough?

1353
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,116
But l am sure
of one more thing

1354
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:48,151
l think these cobras
are not so poisonous

1355
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,520
Otherwise your imagination

1356
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,322
...wouldn't run wild
like this to save them

1357
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,498
- lsn't it?
- Oh go away!

1358
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,225
- So were you lying?
-A little bit

1359
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:01,926
No, don't!

1360
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,335
Oh! Don't sulk
You are my sweetie pie

1361
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:13,205
So, my dear...shall l ask them
to come back here?

1362
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:18,518
- Please?
- Thank you

1363
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,011
Sir, you haven't
given me a reply

1364
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,123
What reply?

1365
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,152
We are not
going anywhere

1366
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,122
We are not their play things
to throw us out and call us in

1367
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:26,592
...as when it pleases them

1368
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,520
- lsn't it so brother?
- Of course

1369
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,557
Bro, concentrate

1370
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:34,065
Look, this is a sort of
sneaky punch, okay?

1371
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:35,530
Forget all that

1372
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:37,605
Be quiet, you dog
My tooth just came off

1373
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:38,365
l didn't mean that

1374
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,634
l was talking about
what those girls said

1375
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,174
Husbands and wives
will naturally behave like this

1376
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,644
Husbands and wives?
When did that happen?

1377
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:49,683
Not yet, but when it does
things like this might happen

1378
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:50,717
Yes, correct

1379
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,377
Just think
this was a rehearsal

1380
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:55,990
Since they cried
and begged forgiveness

1381
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,183
Forgiveness?
Who did?

1382
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,986
Not exactly, but it will happen

1383
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,562
Otherwise will MrJohn send us
to bring you there so confidently?

1384
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,862
Well, why don't we go, bro?

1385
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:09,731
- No, we should not rush like that
- We'll lose our weight, right?

1386
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,806
Let's have 2 pegs and then go
What do you say?

1387
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,405
But didn't we decide
to stop booze, bro?

1388
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,635
Why?
For whom?

1389
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:24,849
Ah, why are you
standing there?

1390
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,183
- Come in
- Bro?

1391
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,018
Don't move
Be like a statue

1392
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,249
Let them beg
forgiveness at our feet

1393
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,520
Hey! Come in

1394
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,026
Where are they?

1395
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,562
Don't make noise
They've slept

1396
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,861
You guys, come in

1397
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,026
Will it turn unpleasant?

1398
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:45,038
Just don't make noise
Come

1399
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,269
- Did you eat anything?
- No

1400
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,138
lt's alright
There's water in the room

1401
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:54,147
Drink and go to sleep

1402
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:59,617
- Don't make a sound
- Stop there!

1403
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:02,623
Bro

1404
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:08,027
- Jesus!
-Are you drunk?

1405
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:10,287
Are we?

1406
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,263
- No
- No

1407
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:14,666
lt's quite obvious

1408
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,735
You resort to
hooliganism, right?

1409
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,906
Don't step in here again
afterfights and brawls

1410
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:25,240
lf l hear of any such thing, at once
l'll chuck you out, l warn you

1411
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:27,206
Go

1412
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,627
What is this?
Ajail?

1413
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:44,296
No drinks, no smoke
l am becoming mad

1414
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:48,195
lt will all be okay
Here drink this

1415
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:51,237
When the 2 of you get married
sister will calm down all by herself

1416
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,601
What?
Marriage?

1417
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:53,968
Go climb a wall!

1418
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,939
l don't want her,
Bhadrakali (fiery goddess)

1419
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,807
She matches you perfectly
Go and marry her

1420
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,904
What the hell
are you saying?

1421
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:02,846
That girl is for you
l already consider her my sister

1422
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,476
You will drink water (be in trouble)
Bro, l mean, go ahead drink water

1423
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,917
Not only that, she is
the best girl for you to wed

1424
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,188
To scold you, to control you
she is the best person

1425
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:15,262
Oh is she? Let her come to me
with all that

1426
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:16,887
She does not know
my real nature

1427
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,897
l will throw her out
like a door mat

1428
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,303
What is it?

1429
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,569
Nothing, has Papa
gone to sleep?

1430
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:31,042
What was all that about
throwing someone out?

1431
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,706
- Was it me?
- No

1432
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,648
l was just saying we should
have a doormat outside

1433
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,981
- The dust is full of room you see
- What?

1434
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:45,048
- Bro, it's room full of...
- What? Shut up

1435
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,728
The room is full of dust

1436
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:52,288
Okay have it your way!
Have you guys had anything?

1437
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,271
- Yes just a small one
- Not that

1438
01:22:57,372 --> 01:23:00,830
- l asked if you've had dinner?
- Yes, a small one

1439
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,704
Tell me the truth,
yes or no?

1440
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,745
- Chinese food...
- No

1441
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:06,641
Hey bro!

1442
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,750
lt's okay
Come downstairs

1443
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:14,448
What did you do now?
Shameful

1444
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:17,116
What's there to be shameful
l'm so hungry l'm going blind

1445
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,783
-Aren't you coming?
- Not me

1446
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,121
- Don't you want to eat?
- No

1447
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:24,130
l am going
Bro, l can smell chicken

1448
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,270
The curry is yummy

1449
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,809
The rice is very good

1450
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,310
But you haven't eaten yet

1451
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:40,711
Looks can tell, isn't it?

1452
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:41,577
Yes, of course

1453
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,651
lt's quite obvious
what you mean

1454
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:44,776
Enough, dude!

1455
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,114
lf so, then you can
leave the table, sir

1456
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:47,381
Hey, go away

1457
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,513
He thinks
he's being funny

1458
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,649
Are you twins?

1459
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,387
No, we are Christians

1460
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:57,522
Truly

1461
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:58,530
No, my dear chap

1462
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:01,067
She asked if you were
born at the same time

1463
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:02,464
Yes, of course

1464
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,800
Then why is one
of you so dark?

1465
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:13,339
- No, it's nothing...
- Mom delivered me on time

1466
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,177
But he was in
the womb for longer

1467
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:19,583
And browned a bit
more lying there

1468
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,581
That's a good joke

1469
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:25,850
Oh you are a great
joker, aren't you?

1470
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,393
When you know
me better you'll see

1471
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,929
...whoever talks to me
dies of laughter

1472
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:33,262
Many who wanted to die
have come to meet him

1473
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,603
- That was superb!
- You deserve it

1474
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:42,400
Never speak about another's
short comings and be smart

1475
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,875
But who said anything
about short comings

1476
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:47,141
We said he was just
darkerthan normal, right?

1477
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,817
Look this is just ajoke, okay?

1478
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,716
The 2 of you don't look
like brothers at all

1479
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:54,482
Especially twins

1480
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,824
Like we belong
to 2 fathers, right?

1481
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,794
No, l did not mean that

1482
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:15,804
Bro, aren't you finishing?

1483
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,002
No, l am full

1484
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,114
Are you also stopping?

1485
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:32,393
Yes, enough

1486
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,196
Doesn't matter,
you continue

1487
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,406
Oh you are lying here, is it?

1488
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:52,340
Where is he?

1489
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:53,874
He's gone to sleep

1490
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,810
He's very upset, isn't he?

1491
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,418
No, that's alright

1492
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,579
He's used to
hearing such things

1493
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,917
We were born in a hospital
in Kuala Lumpur

1494
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:09,654
Mom and dad died in an attack
and blast in the hospital

1495
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,191
Later uncle and
aunt brought us

1496
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,529
...to our native home, Kottayam

1497
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:19,335
Aunt and uncle felt one of us
was exchanged in that incident

1498
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,877
Many people said twins
need not be identical

1499
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,104
But they found it
difficult to accept it

1500
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:29,777
Bro went through many
rejections and insults

1501
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:32,218
He was looked upon
like a burden

1502
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,947
...and alienated
from everyone

1503
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,795
Put your hand
on their shoulders

1504
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:56,139
Bro, come

1505
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,547
Take one of us together

1506
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,282
That one is
already approved

1507
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:16,358
Hey! Leave us
Let go my hand

1508
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:19,926
Sir, you wanted twins
forthe play

1509
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,262
Look, they are twins

1510
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:30,671
Teacher! Look at them
They claim they are twins

1511
01:27:31,646 --> 01:27:35,514
Oh what identical looks!
They are perfect twins!

1512
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,118
Boys, were you really born
to the same father?

1513
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,752
Leave me alone

1514
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:50,695
Oh! What a greatjoke!

1515
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:06,469
He could nevertolerate anyone
insulting or hurting me

1516
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:11,342
He has always believed that
he isn't really my biological brother

1517
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:14,277
He believed he was
a responsibility thrust on me

1518
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:26,022
Bro, where are you going
leaving me alone?

1519
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,431
l am going

1520
01:28:30,538 --> 01:28:33,564
l will go find your real brother
and bring him to you

1521
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:36,472
No, you are my brother
Only you

1522
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:37,874
Come, let's go back

1523
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:41,410
- No, l'm not going back there
- Then l am coming with you

1524
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:44,280
l will be with you, bro
wherever you go

1525
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,883
His decision was very firm

1526
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:51,091
He says if ever
he finds my real twin

1527
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:55,026
...he will leave me forever
without being a burden anymore

1528
01:28:55,730 --> 01:29:00,633
But l cannot live without him
Not even for a minute

1529
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:20,010
Sorry

1530
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:24,424
What for?
l was just unnecessarily...

1531
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,550
She's finding it
difficult to face you

1532
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,288
That's why she sent me

1533
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,296
She did not say
all that to hurt you

1534
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:32,366
Now when brother explained...

1535
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,702
lt's alright

1536
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,899
l am destined to
hear such things

1537
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:38,562
l am an orphan

1538
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:46,476
But there are many to love him
Relatives and other dear ones

1539
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,015
He left all that
to come with me

1540
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:53,015
l am very sure
that he has a brother

1541
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,421
l will find him
God will show him

1542
01:29:57,191 --> 01:30:02,094
Bro has to suffer so many
shameful situations everywhere

1543
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:06,764
Aren't you lucky to get
such a loving brother?

1544
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:11,237
Why don't you think
everything has happened forthe best?

1545
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:21,843
The pain of being
separated at birth

1546
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:23,211
lt's a pain all by itself

1547
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:25,342
Well, that's why it's said
separated at birth

1548
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:26,283
TRUE

1549
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:28,617
Do you know
when l delivered...

1550
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:30,088
What
You delivered?

1551
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:34,685
No, l meant my mother
When l was born

1552
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,559
Blood could be seen

1553
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:38,097
Why? Did you have
ulcers on yourface?

1554
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:43,694
No, l was so fair,
chubby and beautiful

1555
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:48,238
The nurse who cleaned me up
accepted a bribe

1556
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,572
...and gave me away
to a rich man

1557
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:53,511
ln return his blackened
and scrawny baby

1558
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:54,979
...was given back to my mother

1559
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:58,313
That black, thin fellow
is me, a vagabond!

1560
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:01,286
The real me, am somewhere

1561
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:06,759
...in a rich man's house
all fair and chubby

1562
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,762
l don't understand anything
So you sitting here?

1563
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:13,425
This me who's sitting here
is not actually me

1564
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,502
l am somewhere
in an unknown place

1565
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:19,039
Handsome and
rich, living happily

1566
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,901
Don't drink like this, buddy
Your liver will wilt away

1567
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,240
Let it wilt,
what does it matter to me?

1568
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:26,643
lt's not my liver after all

1569
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:28,977
lt's that thin reedy
black fellow's liver

1570
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:32,575
Let him die
Let that cheater die

1571
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,053
l am living in some
millionaire's house

1572
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:38,683
All fair and handsome
With a beautiful wife

1573
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:42,024
Probably drinking
milk and Bournvita

1574
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:43,221
Don't cry, buddy

1575
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:59,911
Hello, Kari sir
What's your intention?

1576
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:01,874
No use!

1577
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:04,910
Hello, Raja sir
Please say something

1578
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,216
You've been
cycling so long

1579
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,786
Where are you off to
in such a tearing hurry?

1580
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:11,248
Stop for a minute

1581
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:12,758
Stop it!

1582
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,494
What do you want?

1583
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:18,062
Nothing
lt was fun saying that!

1584
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:20,498
ln a temper
Very hot

1585
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:21,499
l will go

1586
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:27,705
Sir, what is the issue now?
Hasn't it all been resolved?

1587
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:30,843
Let's go to the house
And explain everything

1588
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:34,775
What will you explain?
No! That will not work out

1589
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:38,451
We've become jokers
Among all of them

1590
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,214
Enough
Let's put an end to it

1591
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:42,622
So are we not
going there?

1592
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:45,458
Why? To meet whom?

1593
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:52,229
Bro, all this is not meant for us
Family, children and such things

1594
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,767
Not only that
We aren't suitably matched also

1595
01:32:56,070 --> 01:33:00,200
They are well educated
Enough, let's give it up

1596
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:02,908
And go away from here
Here...

1597
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,382
Where are you off to?
School or college?

1598
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:16,817
What?

1599
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:21,256
l asked because l heard
you say you lacked education

1600
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,230
Okay, let's leave that aside
That's your problem

1601
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:33,133
But when tenants vacate
there are some formalities

1602
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:38,643
At least the rent for the period
you stayed has to be paid

1603
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:43,040
We've come to collect that rent

1604
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,248
But that...

1605
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,250
Each of you have
to pay it separately

1606
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:51,590
Why?
No money, is it?

1607
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,590
No...Yes...there is

1608
01:33:57,665 --> 01:33:59,394
Come, let's go
take it

1609
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:09,735
Stop! Stop!

1610
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:14,139
When the house owner
is alive here

1611
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,842
...what rights do you have
to demand and accept rent?

1612
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:22,551
Well, now that you've taken it
give this back to this owner

1613
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:25,121
And you give it back
to this owner

1614
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:27,924
What are you gaping for?

1615
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:30,529
House owners
Come on, accept it

1616
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:33,393
l confessed
everything to them

1617
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:37,464
The fact that you bought the house
the secret desires in your heart

1618
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:43,877
They too are totally happy with it

1619
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,725
Sing, sing...

1620
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,797
Together, together...

1621
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,733
Sing, sing...
sing a song

1622
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,803
Together, together...
together they unite

1623
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:13,806
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree

1624
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:18,072
Oh nomadic breeze

1625
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:20,704
Oh don't you see
the blushing cheeks

1626
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:23,978
...of the little dragon fly

1627
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:30,115
Oh don't you hear
a heart beating like drums

1628
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:34,058
Beneath the canopy of raindrops
for these 2 beautiful little women

1629
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:39,189
...filled with desires appeared
duo-partners from out of the blue

1630
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:47,332
2 different bodies
sharing one mind

1631
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:57,840
Two pairs of eyes
now double fold

1632
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,852
Sing, sing...
sing a song

1633
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,785
Together, together...
together they unite

1634
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:05,848
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree

1635
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:10,056
Oh nomadic breeze

1636
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:32,118
Don't worry at all
You can pay my bill also

1637
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:36,382
Glances have clashed...
Lo! Glances have collided

1638
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:40,187
There's a smattering of honeyed
tunes humming on their lips

1639
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:44,526
Oh look! Laughter has blossomed

1640
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,795
They have exchanged
thoughts without words

1641
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:52,202
On the veranda of dreams...
as they met...they twittered

1642
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:56,208
...like birds reveling in
mischievous whispers

1643
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,278
Sing, sing...
sing a song

1644
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,347
Together, together...
together they unite

1645
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:04,281
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree

1646
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:08,412
Oh nomadic breeze

1647
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:20,529
Oh! There shines...a golden light

1648
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:24,331
As the day comes nearer
for them to share their desire

1649
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:28,602
As time told a story...oh! Hear
as this time told a story...

1650
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:31,872
All the rooms in this house
echoed in happiness

1651
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:36,348
When tomorrow a new dawn
blushes in the skies

1652
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:40,352
May their platter of dreams
be filled with flowers

1653
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:42,354
Sing, sing...
sing a song

1654
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:44,287
Together, together...
together they unite

1655
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:48,327
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree

1656
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:52,331
Oh nomadic breeze

1657
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:54,401
Sing, sing...
sing a song

1658
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:56,332
Together, together...
together they unite

1659
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:58,405
Swing that swings
on the country mango tree

1660
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:02,464
Oh nomadic breeze

1661
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:19,925
Are you still standing here?
Go look at the fire works

1662
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:21,085
Now?

1663
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:23,857
Dude, l am talking
about the crackers

1664
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:26,159
Oh God!
The Minister is here

1665
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:36,937
Attached to this hospital
a physical fitness centre

1666
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:40,240
...will start functioning
from next Sunday

1667
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:44,345
l wish to inform you
this happy news, today

1668
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:49,079
The persons who have undertaken
to conduct it are doing so...

1669
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:52,191
...with good intentions
and with respectability

1670
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:56,228
l wish to introduce those
respectable individuals to you

1671
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,522
Please

1672
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,239
On this auspicious day
l wish to share...

1673
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:09,832
...a purely personal
news with all of you

1674
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:13,636
They are also
my future sons-in-law

1675
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:24,758
l invite High courtjudge
Honorable Mr Paneerselvam

1676
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:27,426
...to speak a few words
seeking his best wishes

1677
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:28,756
Please, wait a second

1678
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:32,158
You can wait
a while forthe speech

1679
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:33,891
What's it?

1680
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,663
This physical centre
functioned earlier also

1681
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:41,230
But everyone knows
what exactly was going on here

1682
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:43,741
But in future such things
won't happen if MrJohn runs it

1683
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:45,402
We don't know from where
these 2 guys have come

1684
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:48,241
We have to enquire
about them very well

1685
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:52,852
My friend, l have made all enquiries
l am sure they will run it beautifully

1686
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,545
What's the surety?

1687
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,454
What did you enquire?

1688
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,196
You have announced that you were getting
your daughters married to them too

1689
01:40:03,297 --> 01:40:04,764
What do you know about them?

1690
01:40:05,132 --> 01:40:07,600
Yes, dude
l enquired about them

1691
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:11,660
Okay, do you know
this is their 2nd wedding?

1692
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:16,636
Beware, you don't
make derogatory comments

1693
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,402
Yes, it is derogatory indeed

1694
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,510
To marry in one land,
collect all you can from there

1695
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:23,205
...and go to a new place
and repeat the holy act

1696
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:24,443
This is surely derogatory

1697
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:27,449
lf you talk nonsense
about our boss...

1698
01:40:27,554 --> 01:40:29,112
Get lost! You!!

1699
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:34,590
Look these are certificates from
Kothamangalam sub registrar office

1700
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:37,459
Proof of their
register marriage

1701
01:40:37,564 --> 01:40:38,997
On November 2nd

1702
01:40:44,605 --> 01:40:45,902
Now tell me, my dear sir

1703
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:48,474
...how good was
your enquiry about them?

1704
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,302
My dear children,
what is all this?

1705
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:56,908
This is a trap
A trap

1706
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:58,579
Yes, it's a trap

1707
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,812
One that should
get you life imprisonment

1708
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:02,785
Judge and police are all here
Let them decide

1709
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,790
No!! l will not believe this

1710
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:07,791
These are things
which anyone can fabricate

1711
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:10,829
He is capable not only of this
but things worse than this

1712
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:14,593
Okay, all this is false
So leave it

1713
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:17,863
Dude, bring them here

1714
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:43,186
Hello, now tell me
ls this also another fraud?

1715
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:48,800
What happened, cobras?
Cat got yourtongue?

1716
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:52,033
Sir, put them behind bars

1717
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:56,509
Do you have anything to say?

1718
01:41:59,012 --> 01:42:02,243
Nothing
What can they say?

1719
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:09,682
We'd like to explain, sir

1720
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:16,228
lt's true we married them
in the registrar office

1721
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:22,202
When later that wedding
was called off at the church

1722
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,634
...shame facedly
we ended everything

1723
01:42:24,738 --> 01:42:26,205
...and came here

1724
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:32,977
But we did not know
it had not ended

1725
01:42:34,047 --> 01:42:36,845
...that they were
still waiting for us

1726
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:42,316
lt was a mistake
due to our ignorance

1727
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:45,657
We have hurt many people

1728
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:50,453
You have to forgive us
and bear with us

1729
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:54,089
Hey, don't try
to slink away like that

1730
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:56,225
Tell us what to do
regarding them?

1731
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:00,001
What else?
They have to marry them

1732
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:03,075
They should marry them
here in public

1733
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:14,645
Brother

1734
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:21,787
Ask them

1735
01:43:23,764 --> 01:43:27,063
Now whatever we do
will be wrong

1736
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:33,037
You are intelligent and educated
Tell us what should we do?

1737
01:43:33,307 --> 01:43:35,002
Who should we accept?

1738
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:45,149
Whoever you accept
it will be right

1739
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:50,418
But accepting them
will be a bigger 'right'

1740
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:54,059
You should accept them

1741
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:28,688
Hey! Enough of all this

1742
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,497
Enough of all this drama

1743
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,895
That long haired fellow
promised us lots of money...

1744
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:39,632
...to just come and
stand here, so we came

1745
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:43,041
He has not told us
about this garland sequence

1746
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:44,337
Neither will all that happen

1747
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:48,611
To tell you the truth
they are our wives

1748
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:56,079
We do not want to be a part
of breaking up a relationship

1749
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:57,348
Come

1750
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:09,665
Have you any shame?
You creeps!

1751
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:14,162
Stabbing from behind
and betraying, you are 2 corpses!

1752
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:16,667
Real men stand
face to face and fight

1753
01:45:16,843 --> 01:45:19,403
They don't do
wretched things like you

1754
01:45:19,946 --> 01:45:22,346
Go and die somewhere

1755
01:45:23,884 --> 01:45:25,215
Pigs!

1756
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:30,681
Stop it

1757
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:35,158
Stop it, l say!

1758
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:38,623
We'll fight face to face
Come we'll fight face to face

1759
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:44,330
lf you are truly spunky, come
Let's face each other

1760
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:47,439
What happened? Have your
so-called men got scared?

1761
01:45:47,808 --> 01:45:50,800
We are ready
Ask them also to come

1762
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:52,501
We'll show you
who are real men

1763
01:45:54,915 --> 01:45:57,349
-Are you prepared?
- Of course, we are

1764
01:45:58,452 --> 01:45:59,419
But if you are beaten...

1765
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:01,612
...we should never see you
on this land again

1766
01:46:01,722 --> 01:46:03,485
You should go away
Far away from this place

1767
01:46:03,657 --> 01:46:04,521
Agreed?

1768
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,489
Agreed
And if we win?

1769
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:08,359
Don't grin

1770
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:10,828
lf we win you'll have to
give up this hospital...

1771
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:12,259
...and assets to us
which you have leased

1772
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,596
We'll give it up
not for leased amount

1773
01:46:14,735 --> 01:46:16,566
Forfree
Free

1774
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:19,571
Then tell us where and when
we meet this challenge

1775
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:23,000
- Papa
- Keep quiet, my son

1776
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:26,644
Sunday at the new
Physical Centre

1777
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:28,748
l am saying this
for all of you to know

1778
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:31,283
This shall be the inaugural function
of the Physical Centre

1779
01:46:31,418 --> 01:46:33,352
Exactly at 5:00 P.M

1780
01:46:34,187 --> 01:46:35,677
- Okay?
- Okay

1781
01:46:35,856 --> 01:46:36,823
Okay, dude

1782
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:39,687
Good! Very good!
Excellent!

1783
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:42,021
What did he excel in?
Who did he think he was?

1784
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:44,029
To challenge like knights of old
l am not for all this

1785
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:46,324
To bear blows and
die in front of people

1786
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:48,965
This challenge
shouldn't take place

1787
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:50,001
We should end it

1788
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:51,934
We should finish
both of them before that

1789
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,199
Judge grandpa has to tell us
how to do it

1790
01:46:54,341 --> 01:46:55,638
Whatever you try

1791
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:58,936
lt's equal to the hangman's noose
around your own necks

1792
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:03,538
Both this secret war
and secret arms, is now dangerous

1793
01:47:05,051 --> 01:47:09,613
l told you long back
Go back into their pasts

1794
01:47:10,123 --> 01:47:12,284
You'll get your
weapon from there

1795
01:47:12,392 --> 01:47:16,260
We did that
and found those two girls

1796
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:17,489
What happened after that?

1797
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:21,163
You wentjust
4 months backward

1798
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:24,167
But l will go back
in decades

1799
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:26,305
From the time
they were born

1800
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:28,374
...to the place they were born

1801
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:34,641
What l got was a weapon
which will tear them at their roots

1802
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:37,146
You mentioned the other day

1803
01:47:37,417 --> 01:47:43,083
...that 1 of them looked very much
like Naidu of Kuala Lumpur

1804
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:47,693
You left that trail
l started from where you left off

1805
01:47:55,068 --> 01:47:59,903
A weapon to divide into 2
those who are 1

1806
01:48:01,775 --> 01:48:03,402
An invincible weapon

1807
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:08,539
1 who does not hesitate
to do anything for money

1808
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:11,043
Shivadas Naidu

1809
01:48:45,652 --> 01:48:46,482
- Mr Jayavardan
- Yes?

1810
01:48:46,586 --> 01:48:48,053
l am a great fan of yours

1811
01:48:48,255 --> 01:48:50,382
lf you don't mind
can l have a picture with you?

1812
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:51,922
Sure, why not?

1813
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:53,786
Just a second

1814
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:57,856
Great
Thank you so much

1815
01:48:57,964 --> 01:48:59,625
l have a funny idea

1816
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:01,996
Can l measure
my palm against yours?

1817
01:49:02,636 --> 01:49:05,332
Just once
Please?

1818
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:10,968
Mine is a bit bigger

1819
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:15,471
Best of luck for the final

1820
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:26,552
- Come on, beat him up
- Papa!

1821
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:29,920
- Be quiet
- He's cheating

1822
01:49:30,497 --> 01:49:32,556
Hello
Who is it?

1823
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,589
1 minute

1824
01:49:35,135 --> 01:49:37,296
- Here, phone for you
- For me?

1825
01:49:37,437 --> 01:49:38,301
Who is it?

1826
01:49:40,273 --> 01:49:42,707
Hello, who is it?
Who?

1827
01:49:43,977 --> 01:49:45,740
- Who's it, bro?
- l don't know

1828
01:49:47,514 --> 01:49:49,004
- Hello
- Hello

1829
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:50,807
- Who is it?
- Hello, Mr Raja?

1830
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:53,181
- Yes
- l am Shivadas Naidu

1831
01:49:53,386 --> 01:49:56,719
- Who?
- Shivadas Naidu

1832
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:58,721
Who? l don't place you

1833
01:49:58,858 --> 01:50:04,125
Very far away
but a very near relation

1834
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:11,030
Relation, meaning brother
Your twin brother, Shivadas Naidu

1835
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:15,764
What are you saying?
Where are you speaking from?

1836
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:18,400
Forthe time being
Coimbatore

1837
01:50:18,845 --> 01:50:21,541
l want to meet you
Where should l come?

1838
01:50:21,848 --> 01:50:26,148
No, don't come here
l will come and see you

1839
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:29,722
Hotel Blue Diamond
Room number 207

1840
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:59,008
- Where's room number 207?
- Upstairs, right and last room

1841
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:05,891
Brother, do you have
a match stick with you?

1842
01:51:05,992 --> 01:51:07,482
Are you deaf?

1843
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:26,669
Welcome Mr Raja

1844
01:51:27,647 --> 01:51:28,705
Come in

1845
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:34,677
Don't hesitate
We've not tricked you

1846
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:43,525
We didn't call you?
lt was Shivadas himself

1847
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:45,621
But not from here
From Kuala Lumpur

1848
01:51:45,832 --> 01:51:48,198
Look at the number
in your phone

1849
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:50,666
How can you believe
in your enemies, isn't it?

1850
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:53,967
Look he's online
Talk to him

1851
01:51:54,441 --> 01:51:55,874
Cheers, brother!

1852
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:59,703
No! Tell me
why l was asked to come

1853
01:52:00,413 --> 01:52:01,971
l'll be right back

1854
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,374
This is great!

1855
01:52:04,484 --> 01:52:07,851
When you finally find
your long lost brother

1856
01:52:07,954 --> 01:52:11,822
...now you don't want him
Why is it like that, lsaac?

1857
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:17,594
ls it because you may have to
share your inherited assets?

1858
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:19,663
No, that could not be
a possibility

1859
01:52:19,766 --> 01:52:20,790
You'd already denounced
wealth and relatives

1860
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:26,839
...with some stranger
who you claim is your brother

1861
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:29,766
lf your real brother turned up...

1862
01:52:29,876 --> 01:52:33,334
...are you scared
that you'll lose this brother?

1863
01:52:34,614 --> 01:52:37,879
Yes, that's it
That is your fear

1864
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:39,541
But Albert...

1865
01:52:39,652 --> 01:52:42,086
...that Shivadas
doesn't seem to have...

1866
01:52:42,188 --> 01:52:44,486
...any love or sentiments
to this fellow

1867
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:47,822
He is more interested
in this guy's dead father's wealth

1868
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:49,394
What will he do now?

1869
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:51,396
l have long since
given up all that

1870
01:52:51,498 --> 01:52:52,726
l don't want anything

1871
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:54,823
Let him have everything

1872
01:52:55,034 --> 01:52:57,366
Good
Good deed, indeed!

1873
01:52:57,737 --> 01:53:00,262
But still there's a problem

1874
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:03,870
These 2 brothers have to
undergo DNA test...

1875
01:53:03,977 --> 01:53:06,275
...and prove that
they are brothers

1876
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:07,846
We shall do it somehow

1877
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:09,710
- lsn't it?
- Yes

1878
01:53:11,184 --> 01:53:13,846
lf that brother who's with you
comes to know

1879
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:15,978
...will he have a problem?

1880
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:20,717
Come on
Say something

1881
01:53:21,394 --> 01:53:25,262
l figure this is a threat
What do you want?

1882
01:53:25,698 --> 01:53:28,724
You are quite smart
lntelligent

1883
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:32,637
Forget it
What do we want, eh?

1884
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:33,967
Nothing

1885
01:53:34,073 --> 01:53:36,507
They want the hospital building

1886
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:46,918
Forthat either you withdraw
from this contest...

1887
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:52,481
...or be defeated voluntarily

1888
01:53:56,996 --> 01:53:58,725
lf both are not acceptable?

1889
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:04,503
He will come
Shivadas Naidu

1890
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:09,201
Then you and
your supposed brother...

1891
01:54:09,309 --> 01:54:13,507
...can decide what you want

1892
01:54:16,249 --> 01:54:21,277
lf you accept defeat
he won't come out in the open

1893
01:54:21,387 --> 01:54:24,151
He'll return
without anyone knowing

1894
01:54:25,258 --> 01:54:29,490
We will settle his accounts
whatever his demands are

1895
01:54:31,297 --> 01:54:35,131
Now decide whether
you want to beat them and live on

1896
01:54:35,235 --> 01:54:41,504
Or not lose the brother
who's been with you all along

1897
01:54:46,246 --> 01:54:47,178
You can go

1898
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,834
Brother
Why here?

1899
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:16,166
Don't you always say
l might have another brother?.

1900
01:55:19,379 --> 01:55:23,611
Do you really believe
there's one?

1901
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:27,410
No
But l am always scared

1902
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:30,852
Whenever l say that
you insist there couldn't be one

1903
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:33,385
When l hear that
there is peace for me

1904
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:37,395
l keep repeating it only to
hear you console me

1905
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:40,330
Sorry, bro
l won't ever say it again

1906
01:55:40,433 --> 01:55:41,730
Promise

1907
01:55:42,168 --> 01:55:45,160
Well, it appears
there is someone like this

1908
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:53,877
Yes bro, l talked to him

1909
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,880
He was the one
who phoned me

1910
01:55:55,982 --> 01:55:59,850
No, someone is pulling
a fast one on you

1911
01:56:00,086 --> 01:56:03,112
No bro, it's the truth

1912
01:56:03,389 --> 01:56:04,856
l went to meet him
the other day

1913
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:10,021
But he's being used to bait us
by lsaac and others

1914
01:56:12,832 --> 01:56:16,495
Bro, so l am a nobody?

1915
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:20,368
You are my only brother
l have only you

1916
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:23,533
No, l am nobody

1917
01:56:23,943 --> 01:56:26,207
l am no one to you

1918
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:28,610
- No one
- Brother!

1919
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:32,877
No one
No one, l don't want to live

1920
01:56:33,619 --> 01:56:40,320
Bro, stop
Listen to me

1921
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:50,769
Bro...th...er!

1922
01:56:56,943 --> 01:56:58,535
Brother!

1923
01:57:05,151 --> 01:57:06,709
What has happened
to this fellow?

1924
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:08,548
He didn't sleep well last night

1925
01:57:08,654 --> 01:57:10,781
He was tossing and turning
the whole night

1926
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,050
Withdrawal symptoms
after stopping booze

1927
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:14,922
- So you are still continuing, eh?
- Just a small

1928
01:57:16,896 --> 01:57:20,457
Hey
As a coach l forbid you

1929
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:21,498
- Papa?
- Eh?

1930
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:23,899
How strong are
lsaac and Albert?

1931
01:57:24,003 --> 01:57:27,439
- Nothing to be scared of
- No?

1932
01:57:27,707 --> 01:57:29,231
But...
But what Papa?

1933
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:30,775
Hello!

1934
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:32,878
Why is this cobra shivering?

1935
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:33,707
What?

1936
01:57:33,813 --> 01:57:34,871
Don't give the slip, okay?

1937
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:39,441
Have you heard of Jatlas
who scared the whole of Jalandhar

1938
01:57:39,552 --> 01:57:42,043
They were this size, both of them
Bro, flattened both of them

1939
01:57:42,155 --> 01:57:42,985
Do you know that?

1940
01:57:43,089 --> 01:57:45,387
- Oh, only brother
- Me too

1941
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:49,120
For these fellows
l need only my left hand

1942
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:50,661
My left hand
is already tingling

1943
01:57:50,763 --> 01:57:52,287
But why is
your left hand tingling?

1944
01:57:52,398 --> 01:57:53,558
What?

1945
01:57:56,903 --> 01:57:58,700
Papa we are leaving

1946
01:57:58,805 --> 01:57:59,999
What was there
to laugh about?

1947
01:58:00,106 --> 01:58:02,404
Papa, all of you together
bamboozled me

1948
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:05,237
Why did you give your left hand
so much importance?

1949
01:58:05,344 --> 01:58:06,777
That's because the left hand...

1950
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:07,777
Oh here he is!

1951
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:09,905
Dude, you should have
punctuality and practice

1952
01:58:10,016 --> 01:58:13,679
Will you squander away
my hospital and money invested?

1953
01:58:14,454 --> 01:58:16,786
- Lets avoid this match Papa
- What?

1954
01:58:17,156 --> 01:58:19,556
Neither should we win
the hospital in that manner

1955
01:58:19,625 --> 01:58:22,617
Have you lost your mind?
What the heck are you saying?

1956
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:26,323
Yes bro, lets avoid
this contest and triumph

1957
01:58:26,466 --> 01:58:27,990
We had stopped it all, right?

1958
01:58:29,168 --> 01:58:31,728
What about the challenge
they threw at us

1959
01:58:31,838 --> 01:58:33,135
The competition too was fixed?

1960
01:58:33,473 --> 01:58:36,567
That was neither me nor you

1961
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:38,900
Papa just said it
in an emotional moment

1962
01:58:39,011 --> 01:58:39,773
We'll forget it

1963
01:58:39,879 --> 01:58:42,245
Forget it?
What are you saying?

1964
01:58:42,348 --> 01:58:46,045
l have put into it
all my earnings of my entire life

1965
01:58:46,352 --> 01:58:47,910
This is to compensate forthat

1966
01:58:50,089 --> 01:58:52,717
The documents of ownership
of this house you made out to us

1967
01:58:52,825 --> 01:58:56,192
We don't want all these
Let it be in your name, papa

1968
01:59:03,402 --> 01:59:04,528
Brother

1969
01:59:05,872 --> 01:59:08,238
Tell me
Why this change of mind?

1970
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:11,208
Didn't l tell you?
l feel this is right now

1971
01:59:11,444 --> 01:59:13,207
You should stand by me

1972
01:59:16,315 --> 01:59:17,748
That will be difficult

1973
01:59:19,018 --> 01:59:22,749
Bro, we were born
and brought up together

1974
01:59:22,955 --> 01:59:26,857
Till today l have listened
only to what you said

1975
01:59:27,126 --> 01:59:31,529
But today forthe 1st time
you have to do as l wish

1976
01:59:33,132 --> 01:59:35,293
For my sake
For our sake

1977
01:59:36,302 --> 01:59:37,428
lt will be difficult

1978
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:44,667
You should not fail
Not in front of anyone

1979
01:59:44,777 --> 01:59:46,108
Not even before me

1980
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:49,681
But here l need to win

1981
01:59:49,782 --> 01:59:51,113
Not to you

1982
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:56,018
But for my girl
whom l love a lot

1983
01:59:56,122 --> 01:59:58,886
l have to compete
in this contest

1984
01:59:58,991 --> 02:00:03,724
Even if l die fighting
l'd be a winner to her like a man

1985
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:17,732
l have been with the 2 of you
Only for a few months

1986
02:00:17,843 --> 02:00:21,745
But l know for sure
you are good hearted

1987
02:00:21,847 --> 02:00:25,613
This decision too has
some hidden good intention

1988
02:00:25,718 --> 02:00:28,551
You have to tell me what it is

1989
02:00:36,462 --> 02:00:37,861
Come on, tell me, my son

1990
02:01:05,758 --> 02:01:09,091
l know for sure
bro will end up doing that

1991
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:11,423
He will not be able to bearthat

1992
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:14,556
Your decision is the right one
And you have no choice

1993
02:01:14,834 --> 02:01:17,302
lf l was in your place
l would do the same

1994
02:01:17,403 --> 02:01:20,998
l respect that decision wholly

1995
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:23,769
But l will not be able
to withdraw from this

1996
02:01:23,876 --> 02:01:25,400
The mistake is on my part

1997
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:29,208
l yelled out
that challenge unthinkingly

1998
02:01:29,815 --> 02:01:33,683
But l have to hang on
to that mistake

1999
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:37,552
You would do the same
if you were in my place

2000
02:01:37,823 --> 02:01:41,759
lf l back out of this
it's as good as dying

2001
02:01:41,861 --> 02:01:43,556
A most disgraceful death

2002
02:01:46,165 --> 02:01:50,568
He will not be alone in the arena
l'll also be with him

2003
02:01:50,703 --> 02:01:55,868
l know we'll never win
But l will fight till l die

2004
02:02:28,407 --> 02:02:33,174
Oh God! Look it's time to start

2005
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:37,711
Son, in a momentary impulse
l announced l'd punch and box

2006
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:39,850
Will he come?

2007
02:02:40,686 --> 02:02:41,778
He will come

2008
02:02:42,221 --> 02:02:43,449
lt's time

2009
02:02:43,556 --> 02:02:45,251
He will come
l am very sure

2010
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:47,849
- Papa, don't be scared
- Who me? Scared?

2011
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:52,988
My hands and feet are shivering
And l am freezing with fear

2012
02:02:55,101 --> 02:02:56,329
There goes the gong!

2013
02:03:04,677 --> 02:03:07,043
Good evening
Ladies and gentlemen

2014
02:03:07,146 --> 02:03:11,845
The main event tonight
features a championship match

2015
02:03:11,951 --> 02:03:14,852
The winner of this match
will be given full control

2016
02:03:14,954 --> 02:03:17,980
...and ownership
of Samuel's hospital

2017
02:03:20,426 --> 02:03:22,519
My son, he has still not come

2018
02:03:22,628 --> 02:03:30,000
lntroducing first the challengers
lsaac brothers

2019
02:04:00,766 --> 02:04:03,326
Look!
He's looking here

2020
02:04:03,502 --> 02:04:05,936
Will he not come after all?

2021
02:04:06,038 --> 02:04:08,529
- Suppose he doesn't come?
- Eh? Get lost

2022
02:04:08,641 --> 02:04:13,977
- Now introducing the champions
- Oh Jesus!

2023
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:17,708
Accompanied by
ourfavorite champion

2024
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:20,384
John Samuel

2025
02:04:20,486 --> 02:04:23,580
They've announced my name
Will he come?

2026
02:04:25,691 --> 02:04:26,783
He will not come now

2027
02:04:28,093 --> 02:04:29,253
Papa, get ready

2028
02:04:29,829 --> 02:04:33,356
This is the garment worn
to go in there

2029
02:04:33,866 --> 02:04:36,835
Will you wear it yourself
or shall we do it for you?

2030
02:04:37,803 --> 02:04:39,498
l need to pee

2031
02:04:39,605 --> 02:04:42,768
The brothers who
dance like feathers

2032
02:04:42,875 --> 02:04:46,106
The Count of Monte Cristo

2033
02:04:46,212 --> 02:04:49,443
The cobras

2034
02:05:04,663 --> 02:05:09,100
Ladies and gentlemen
They are the cobras

2035
02:05:26,485 --> 02:05:28,214
l went to pee

2036
02:05:30,122 --> 02:05:32,750
Ladies and gentlemen
They are here now

2037
02:05:32,858 --> 02:05:35,088
The cobras

2038
02:05:52,945 --> 02:05:57,848
Papa! What is all this?
Where is brother?

2039
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:58,780
He will come

2040
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:00,852
This isjust a starting gimmick

2041
02:06:00,953 --> 02:06:02,921
But they'll finish his ending

2042
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:05,013
Papa, no papa

2043
02:06:05,124 --> 02:06:06,489
Why are you
frightened, my dear?

2044
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:09,720
l am still strong, like before
Come, dude

2045
02:06:14,833 --> 02:06:15,857
Who's the coach?

2046
02:06:18,237 --> 02:06:21,729
- Hey come here!
- What me? As coach?

2047
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:22,864
Go

2048
02:06:23,976 --> 02:06:25,876
Come here
Who's first?

2049
02:06:25,978 --> 02:06:28,469
We want to be first
but it seems not possible

2050
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:31,675
- No...no...who's going in first
- Oh that

2051
02:06:32,651 --> 02:06:34,482
Who's going in first?

2052
02:06:36,922 --> 02:06:38,082
Me

2053
02:06:39,124 --> 02:06:41,786
No papa, l'll go first
My son you...

2054
02:06:41,894 --> 02:06:45,523
After l fall
you can take over

2055
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:47,188
Listen

2056
02:07:10,789 --> 02:07:11,949
First me

2057
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,198
Sorry

2058
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:27,466
l knew
you'll not let me down

2059
02:07:32,444 --> 02:07:37,074
To my right in the red corner
are the cobras

2060
02:07:39,585 --> 02:07:41,416
Come back here
l am the coach now

2061
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,350
But l was the coach

2062
02:07:42,454 --> 02:07:44,547
You are Kochi(run away)now
Just scoot from here

2063
02:07:47,259 --> 02:07:48,624
Show me your hand

2064

Gentlemen
Ready and fight

2073
02:09:16,982 --> 02:09:19,348
Smoking is injurious to health

2074
02:09:30,662 --> 02:09:31,890
Brother!

2075
02:10:04,596 --> 02:10:05,620

02:10:38,997 --> 02:10:39,827
My son

2079
02:10:43,869 --> 02:10:46,030
Get up, brother

Come on...up

2081
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:52,302
Get up

2082
02:10:54,346 --> 02:10:55,506
Come on...up

2083
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:03,080
Don't stand merely staring

2084
02:11:03,188 --> 02:11:05,622
Give him a hand
and you get in

2085
02:11:07,793 --> 02:11:10,353
Brother, l'll get in

2086
02:11:10,596 --> 02:11:12,223
Brother
Give me your hand

2087
02:11:12,331 --> 02:11:15,300
l'll go in
Give me your hand

2088
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:16,958
Brother!

2089
02:11:49,134 --> 02:11:50,499
Punch him

2090
02:11:50,736 --> 02:11:53,296
Punch him now

2091
02:11:54,206 --> 02:11:55,901
Brother, hit him

2092
02:12:01,346 --> 02:12:02,506
Beat him up

2093
02:12:15,394 --> 02:12:19,353
Brother, hit him

2094
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:23,826
My son!

2095
02:12:26,271 --> 02:12:28,296
Don't betray us, my son!

2096
02:12:30,008 --> 02:12:32,738
Papa, what's happened to brother?

2097
02:13:01,073 --> 02:13:02,404
Just stay there, dude

2098
02:13:13,719 --> 02:13:18,486
Brother, please
l will go in

2099
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:21,115
Take him away
Let me go now

2100
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:14,511
Break

2101
02:14:14,946 --> 02:14:19,178
Break it up

2102
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:25,052
l said break

2103
02:14:25,157 --> 02:14:27,455
- Calm down
- Come

2104
02:14:27,559 --> 02:14:28,651
- Calm down
- Come l say

2105
02:16:07,159 --> 02:16:10,526
Do you give up?
Are you sure?

2106
02:16:13,165 --> 02:16:17,397
My son, it's okay
Give it up!

2107
02:16:17,502 --> 02:16:18,526
Accept defeat

2108
02:16:18,637 --> 02:16:20,730
Let these pigs take it
and go hog it all up

2109
02:16:20,839 --> 02:16:23,069
No, l will not
accept defeat

2110
02:16:23,175 --> 02:16:26,008
Even if l die
l will not be defeated

2111
02:16:26,244 --> 02:16:29,441
lf l am defeated it means
my brother is defeated

2112
02:16:30,315 --> 02:16:34,615
l will not allow
my bro to be defeated

2113
02:16:35,754 --> 02:16:42,785
Come!
l say, come fight!

2114
02:16:42,894 --> 02:16:44,327
Come!

2115
02:17:45,357 --> 02:17:48,053
Kick him through
his chest, dude

2116
02:18:10,649 --> 02:18:13,140
Take your phone
and call him

2117
02:18:26,765 --> 02:18:29,563
- He cut the call
- Then call him again

2118
02:18:45,183 --> 02:18:47,879
Go and bring him here

2119
02:18:53,992 --> 02:18:55,016
Go on
hit him

2120
02:19:00,098 --> 02:19:01,258
Shivadas?

2121
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:02,792
Shivadas!

2122
02:19:11,376 --> 02:19:12,536
Shivadas

2123
02:19:17,449 --> 02:19:19,349
Brother!

2124
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:54,340
1 ...2...3...4...5...6...

2125
02:19:58,590 --> 02:19:59,887
Aaaah!

2126
02:20:00,258 --> 02:20:04,285
That's it, over!

2127
02:20:12,404 --> 02:20:17,865
Ladies and gentlemen
The champions!

2128
02:20:40,598 --> 02:20:43,829
Brothers need not necessarily
be only those born to one mother

2129
02:20:44,002 --> 02:20:46,300
You are true brothers

2130
02:20:46,404 --> 02:20:49,305
l do not want
to come between you

2131
02:20:49,441 --> 02:20:53,605
But both of you will always
be there in my heart!

2132
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:31,005
Play around with
these venomous fellows

2133
02:21:31,115 --> 02:21:33,208
Sure you'll soon reach
the burial ground

2134
02:21:33,318 --> 02:21:35,479
Not fake playthings they be, excuse me

2135
02:21:35,587 --> 02:21:38,613
They may be 2 different bodies
But of same minds always

2136
02:21:38,723 --> 02:21:40,782
Cut them into two bits
and the bits would soon unite

2137
02:21:40,892 --> 02:21:42,917
To dig out the bowels
of the one who chopped them

2138
02:21:43,027 --> 02:21:43,994
To bury them alive
along with ample proof

2139
02:21:44,095 --> 02:21:46,063
The cobra that's blackened
in coal, huge and venomous

2140
02:21:46,164 --> 02:21:49,258
To enchant, ensnare and
tame this snake into captivity

2141
02:21:49,367 --> 02:21:53,133
lnto the basket, don't...
oh snake charmer go away

2142
02:21:54,305 --> 02:21:56,102
Strength of family ties
to them are non existent

2143
02:21:56,207 --> 02:21:57,435
Their only strength
is within and between them

2144
02:21:57,542 --> 02:21:58,770
That strength is
of mammoth proportion

2145
02:21:58,877 --> 02:22:01,107
Even a cobra fears another
which is more venomous

2146
02:22:01,212 --> 02:22:03,305
A cobra he is, not to be
taunted by an eagle

2147
02:22:03,414 --> 02:22:06,508
They are here, who shake
the very foundations of a place

2148
02:22:06,618 --> 02:22:08,643
They belong neither to a particular
country, town, place or a home

2149
02:22:08,753 --> 02:22:11,745
They may be rascals but never
will this brave pair smoke a beedi

2150
02:22:11,856 --> 02:22:13,881
lf they love
they'll lick them to death

2151
02:22:13,992 --> 02:22:16,085
lf you hurt them
they'll strike you dead

2152
02:22:16,194 --> 02:22:18,685
Once you are bitten
don't even try to cure

2153
02:22:18,796 --> 02:22:22,493
For it will be a wasted
effort oh medicine man!

2154
02:22:31,109 --> 02:22:33,202
No eagle will hover over a cobra

2155
02:22:33,311 --> 02:22:35,336
Neither can you trap,
not even by a hair's breadth

2156
02:22:35,446 --> 02:22:37,209
lf a water snake can
make you forego dinner

2157
02:22:37,315 --> 02:22:39,146
...the cobra is there to
stop your breath forever

2158
02:22:39,250 --> 02:22:41,810
A cobra has no thoughts
of past nor future

2159
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,480
To retaliate to the stamp
he got on his back

2160
02:22:44,589 --> 02:22:46,113
He needs only
half a minute

2161
02:22:46,224 --> 02:22:50,388
He's never an earthworm
He'll snap and snap again

2162
02:22:50,495 --> 02:22:52,861
He'll draw a line
Oh yes! He'll underline

2163
02:22:52,964 --> 02:22:55,990
He will underline
the life of his prey

2164
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:56,794
with a slight smile

2165
02:22:56,901 --> 02:22:58,926
Please tell a new proverb
about the cobra

2166
02:22:59,037 --> 02:23:01,130
Oh, one who quotes
proverbs in broad day light

2167
02:23:01,239 --> 02:23:02,831
Oh Munshi...
