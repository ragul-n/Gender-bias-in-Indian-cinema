1
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,601
Forget the past.

2
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,343
It's a bygone era.

3
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:50,449
We will together write a
new story in the new era.

4
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,246
We Indians.

5
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,083
We Indians.

6
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,881
Forget the past.

7
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,559
It's a bygone era.

8
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:06,992
We will together write a
new story in the new era.

We Indians.

13
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:34,483
Today we have
broken the old chains.

14
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:39,497
Why to look at the destination
that we have for saken?

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,470
Today the world has
reached the moon.

16
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,872
We have formed a bond
with the new world.

17
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,911
It's a new
generation withnew desires.

18
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,072
Now its newyouth.

19
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,911
We Indians.

We Indians.

22
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,421
We Indians.

23
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,118
We Indians.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,190
Forget the past.

25
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,129

We Indians.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,530
We still have to build
so many other Taj Mahals.

30
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,869
We still have to adorn
so many other Ajantas.

31
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:56,608
We still have to turn the
flow of so many rivers.

32
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:01,813
We have to break so many
mountains from our path.

33
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,914
It's a new
generation with new desires.

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,111
Now its new youth.

35
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,983
We Indians.

36
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,180
We Indians.

37
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,381
We Indians.

38
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,856
We Indians.

39
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,450
We Indians.

40
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,087
We Indians.

We Indians.

46
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:56,863
Let's make work our religion.

47
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:01,838
Let's make our hand our God.

48
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:07,544
Let's make this
land of Ram and Gautam.

49
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:12,807
An lndia that is
lovelier than dreams.

50
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,079
It's a new
generation with new desires.

51
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,384

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,558
We Indians.

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,563
We Indians.

57
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,430
Forget the past.

58
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,268
It's a bygone era.

59
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:40,278
We will together write a
new story in the new era.

60
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,041
We Indians.

61
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,844
We Indians.

62
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:02,193
Each drop is a pearl.
Look up and see.

63
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:07,330
There is gold in the mud.
Touch it and see.

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,107
Ganga is golden, Yamuna is silver.

65
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:18,013
You can grow crops from stones.

66
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,284
It's a new
generation with new desires.

67
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,446
Now its new youth.

68
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,183
We Indians.

69
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,349
We Indians.

70
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,019
We Indians.
- We Indians.

71
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,562
We Indians.

72
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,458
We Indians.

73
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,461
Forget the past.

74
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,130
It's a bygone era.

75
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:45,142
We will together write a
new story in the new era.

76
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,042
We Indians.

77
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,479
We Indians.

78
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,279
We Indians.

79
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,877
We Indians.

80
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,409
It's impossible!

81
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,117
I have never compromised
with lies.

82
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,279
And I will never do
it in the future too!

83
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,356
This case has been going
on since so many days.

84
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,021
What have you got till now? Nothing!

85
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,425
Make a truce with Mr. Chaudhary.

86
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,362
This case will end today itself!

87
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,830
You are forgetting
that this is the country..

88
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,427
..of Ram and Harishchandra.

89
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,362
Never did they
forsake the path of truth!

90
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,267
But Amarnath, times have changed.
People have changed.

91
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,138
Times have changed.
People have changed.

92
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,513
But truth and justice has never
changed and it will never change!

93
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,448
I knew it was futile to
explain to you. You won't change.

94
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,228
But I came here because of
my daughter's well being.

95
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,795
After returning
from abroad she will..

96
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,230
..become your son Sukain's wife.

97
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,998
Sujata, give me some water.

98
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,206
Mother!
- Mother! - Wait!

99
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,338
Let me see how you come down!

100
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,022
Give me the lunch carrier.

101
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,449
Leave it.

102
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,461
What are you looking at?

103
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,023
First serve meal to them.

104
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,024
I am their mother. Where
will they escape from me?

105
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,499
Till the time I am alive,
nobody in this house will starve.

106
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,919
Is the work done?
- Yes.

107
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,220
That's very good.

108
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,365
I like guys who work!

109
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,357
Sir..

110
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,834
Your case hearing is
in the next week. Right?

111
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,336
Yes. On the 20th.

112
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,497
Let's see what happens.

113
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,399
We will win, sir.

114
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,275
What did you say? You people
will win. How do you know that?

115
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,404
Sir.. truth never loses.

116
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,576
Oh! Yes! I also want you
people to win this case.

117
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,147
Your father should win.

118
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,152
Sir, today I have to
leave early. Can I go?

119
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,252
Last week too you took leave thrice.

120
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,891
My dear boy, you should
not neglect your work.

121
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,962
Only today, sir.
- Alright.

122
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:43,926
Thank you, sir.

123
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,606
Hello. Who? Mr.
Satyan? Sir, call for you.

124
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,382
Hello. Kalpana.

125
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,449
What are you still
doing at the office?

126
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,880
I am working.

127
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,556
Do you remember
anything else besides work?

128
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,260
Yes. You.

129
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,258
Do you know what is today?

130
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,127
It's your birthday.
Happy birthday, Kalpana.

131
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,833
Today there is another occasion..

132
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,032
..that is greater than my birthday.

133
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,376
Our engagement anniversary.
Am I right?

134
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,944
And today too we are not together.

135
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,507
Aren't you amazed at your love?

136
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,582
Even I should get some of your time.

137
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,886
After all I am your fiance.
We are going to get married.

138
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,458
You are wasting time by laughing.

139
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,054
Leave your work and
come here within a minute.

140
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,163
Otherwise I will get really upset.

141
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,048
Kalpana!
- Yes, father.

142
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,849
Just see, who it is.
I think it is Satyan.

143
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,495
Don't know why he didn't take a cab.

144
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,497
You very well know that poor
guy is worried these days.

145
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,393
Since that case is going on,
he is facing a lot of problems.

146
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,528
How could he take a cab?

147
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,889
Satyan! The car is here!
- lts there.

148
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,267
Why? Don't want to come in my car?

149
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,426
This is a cheap car.

150
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,133
Today I will give you a
ride in a car worth 2 lakhs.

151
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,139
Car worth 2 lakhs!
Have you won a lottery?

152
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,435
I won a lottery last year..
when I got engaged to you.

153
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,944
Where is your car worth 2 lakhs?

154
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,051
There! Hurry up! It
doesn't wait for anybody!

155
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,848
Bus? Why do you want to travel..

156
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,287
..by bus when we have our own car?

157
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,287
Kalpana, I don't like to
travel in my fiance's car.

158
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,055
And today I have only
5 rupees in my pocket.

159
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,390
It's equal to 5
lakhs for me. Let's go.

160
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,986
The blue clouds.

161
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,462
The moist air.

162
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,556
There is only intoxication.

163
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,995
Let's get lost.

164
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,196
There is only intoxication.

165
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,365
Let's get lost.

166
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,840
The blue clouds.

167
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,138
The moist air.

168
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,271
There is only intoxication.

169
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,406
Let's get lost.

170
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,849
There is only intoxication.

171
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,044
Let's get lost.

172
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,588
The blue clouds.

173
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,007
The weather is crazy.

174
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,338
The world got tempted.

175
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,438
In the merriment of monsoon.

176
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,011
Two hearts are alone.

177
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,550
Your eyes.

178
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,552
My eyes.

179
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:34,292
Both are intoxicated in merriment.

180
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,122
Let's dance.

181
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,458
The blue clouds.

182
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,555
The moist air.

183
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,025
There is only intoxication.

184
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,295
Let's get lost.

185
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,463
There is only intoxication.

186
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,302
Let's get lost.

187
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,036
The blue clouds.

188
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,524
It sprinkles from the eyes.

189
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,066
It drops on the cheeks.

190
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:24,170
The raindrops are capricious.

191
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,141
Understand the gesture.

192
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,439
Support me.

193
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,538
You are mine.

194
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,383
I too am yours.

195
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,315
Let's dance.

196
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,820
The blue clouds.

197
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,014
The moist air.

198
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,183
There is only intoxication.

199
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,454
Let's get lost.

200
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,496
There is only intoxication.

201
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,991
Let's get lost.

202
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,500
The blue clouds.

203
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,793
The veil of waves.

204
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,358
Sways at the shore.

205
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,996
The monsoon also
plays with tresses.

206
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,003
Lose yourself in the waves.

207
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,908
And disappear.

208
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,310
This destination is ours.

209
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,404
My heart says so.

210
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,175
Let's dance.

211
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,816
The blue clouds.

212
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,113
The moist air.

213
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,189
There is only intoxication.

214
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,380
Let's get lost.

215
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,551
There is only intoxication.

216
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,859
Let's get lost.

217
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,454
The blue clouds.

218
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,220
The magic of the season.

219
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,416
Makes the eyes uncontrollable.

220
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,086
It asks you.

221
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,425
What will happen in the future?

222
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,795
Heaven lies here.

223
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,868
I am sure.

224
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,103
When you are with me.

225
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,204
What else the heart wants?

226
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,864
Let's dance.

227
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,235
The blue clouds.

228
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,368
The moist air.

229
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,538
There is only intoxication.

230
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,111
Let's get lost.

231
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,185
There is only intoxication.

232
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,379
Let's get lost.

233
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,217
The blue clouds.

234
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,450
The moist air.

235
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,550
There is only intoxication.

236
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,121
Let's get lost.

237
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,130
There is only intoxication.

238
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,391
Let's get lost.

239
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,435
The blue clouds.

240
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,561
The moist air.

241
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,032
There is only intoxication.

242
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,335
Let's get lost.

243
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,138
There is only intoxication.

244
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,404
Let's get lost.

245
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,880
The blue clouds.

246
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,289
I tell you it's
impossible to keep you here!

247
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,389
I don't know what to do with you!

248
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,596
You are the article
clerk for the past 7 years.

249
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,235
You still don't know
how to draft letters.

250
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,433
Sir.. if you will tell me my
mistake, I will rectify it.

251
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,976
Mistake! You idiot!

252
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,305
Is this attorney's office or a den?

253
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,448
You never concentrate!

254
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,616
I dictate trial and you write trail.

255
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,487
I dictate risk and you write reigns.

256
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,380
And today I told you to
write open-cooperation.

257
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,560
You have written open to close.

258
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,296
You do all kind of gambling!

259
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,232
Gambling! No, sir! Never in life!

260
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,394
Sir!
- Sir!

261
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,572
Call your grandpa, tomorrow.

262
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,506
I will clearly tell him that
I couldn't make you a man.

263
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,936
I am defeated.

264
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,448
But sir, my only
mistake was of spelling.

265
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,107
I will look in the
dictionary and rectify it.

266
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,409
Oh get out!

267
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,949
But I have not forsaken truth.
And I will never forsake it!

268
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,489
You remain
stubborn about your truth!

269
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,163
But I will have to break
Sudha and Sukain's engagement.

270
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,230
I have become poor. So you
are breaking this alliance.

271
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,164
You can't humiliate me like this!

272
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,304
It's not about humiliation!
I am Sudha's father!

273
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,498
And I will have to think about
her future and her happiness!

274
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,504
Diwan! Now nobody can
break this engagement!

275
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,178
I can break it! Tomorrow
Sudha is returning from abroad!

276
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,010
Before she comes, I want
to take this decision.

277
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,116
I have broken this engagement.

278
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,549
Today you are
weighing humans with wealth.

279
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,188
And wealth doesn't
remain with us forever.

280
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,558
Remember. Someday you will
surely regret this humiliation!

281
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,195
And that day I will
not forgive you at all!

282
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,897
Brother!

283
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,310
I agree that you
don't know that girl.

284
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,272
But will you
quietly endure all this?

285
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,906
Why don't you understand?

286
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,952
No father would like his
daughter to marry a poor man.

287
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,893
Father.. how is
your friend Amarnath?

288
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,486
I myself don't know.

289
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,265
Now we don't have any
contact with him. Why?

290
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,835
The man who couldn't
protect his wealth..

291
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,362
..how can he keep his
daughter-in-law happy?

292
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:34,139
I have broken your alliance
with his son Sukain. Let's go.

293
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:21,557
Radha has come covertly.

294
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:27,456
Making no noise.

295
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:32,560
Kanha, come to
the banks of Jamuna.

296
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,939
My heart is swaying.

297
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,883
You played the flute.

298
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:52,119
And I went crazy.

299
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:55,385
You played the flute.

300
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,155
With love in my eyes.

301
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,891
I am searching for you.

302
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,533
Do come.

303
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:08,103
Radha has come covertly.

304
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:14,006
Making no noise.

305
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:19,447
Kanha, come to
the banks of Jamuna.

306
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,948
My heart is swaying.

307
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,129
All decked up.

308
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,402
I have come for your love.

309
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,564
All decked up.

310
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:48,407
Love is blossoming
beneath the moonlight.

311
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,378
Do come.

312
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:55,852
Radha has come covertly.

313
00:25:56,021 --> 00:26:01,516
Making no noise.

314
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:07,231
Kanha, come to
the banks of Jamuna.

315
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,529
My heart is swaying.

316
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,176
Well, Diwan! Your
daughter dances very well.

317
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,279
Thank you, Jackson! Have a drink!

318
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,274
Thank you! Have something to eat!

319
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,541
Please! Please! Come along!

320
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,449
Ma'am.
- Greetings!

321
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,417
Vishal here.
- Nice meeting you.

322
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,386
Hello.
- Hello. - Hello.

323
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,556
Hello.
- Hello. Thank you.

324
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,027
My compliments!
- Thank you!

325
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,227
The dance was charming!

326
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,462
And especially you
were exclusively graceful!

327
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,897
Thank you!

328
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,299
I am Shankar.

329
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,468
Oh! You are Shankar!
The famous Shankar!

330
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,573
I don't know whether
I am famous or not.

331
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,142
But I am surely Shankar!

332
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:58,907
Come! Come!

333
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:04,246
Papa! Papa! Meet him!
He is Mr. Shankar!

334
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,187
Editor of Shankar Weekly.

335
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,781
India's famous cartoonist!

336
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,362
Dear, he is not that Shankar!

337
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,989
He is Mr. Verma's nephew.
- Yes.

338
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,800
Recently he did his diploma in..

339
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,359
..Iabour and industrial
relations from England.

340
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,269
And he has joined your
father's business. - Oh!

341
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,345
Sir! Are you writing a
letter to Mr. Diwan?

342
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,346
No. To his daughter.

343
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,820
Ms. Sudha!
Considering us to be poor..

344
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,822
..your father broke our engagement.

345
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,120
Maybe he has done the right thing.

346
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,319
But I want to ask you one thing.

347
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,829
If after marriage my
financial status had become bad..

348
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,958
..then what would
your father had done?

349
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,359
Sukain!

350
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,038
I will surely write a
reply to this letter.

351
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,139
He has taunted you in the letter.

352
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,072
Now what will you answer him?

353
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,974
You are right. I would like
to see this poor man once.

354
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:07,843
You find out.

355
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,515
Don't I look like a poor girl?

356
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,252
Not really. Still it's fine.

357
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,524
And Sheela, you..
will you recognise him?

358
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,993
I had seen him once. Now let's see.

359
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,400
There is the bookstall.

360
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,538
Here.

361
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,318
Which book do you want?

362
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,822
Such a book after reading which..

363
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,553
..rich people won't ask for dowry.

364
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,095
What? I mean do you
want a book for yourself?

365
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,831
No. I will present
this book to the guy..

366
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,836
..who broke off our engagement..

367
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,966
Why are you hiding your
face in shame? Look at me.

368
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,870
Exactly the same thing
has happened with me.

369
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,172
With you?

370
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,341
Yes. My parents became poor.

371
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,384
And my engagement broke off.

372
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,318
But the only difference is that
I don't hide my face in shame.

373
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,524
Your matter is different.
You are a man.

374
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,155
For a girl it's a shameful thing.

375
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,160
Why are you talking like a coward?

376
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,324
Have faith in yourself.
Someday everything will be fine.

377
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,030
How will it become fine?
For that money is required.

378
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,434
And money..

379
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,100
You will have money too.
- But how?

380
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,536
With courage and determination.

381
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,004
What you see here, I had
begun all this with 4 books.

382
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,115
Your matter is different.
What can I do?

383
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,445
You too can do everything.

384
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,549
And nowadays countless girls
are working better than men.

385
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,022
Take this book. Careers for women.

386
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,057
You can choose any career from this.

387
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,393
And begin your new life.

388
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,332
If your fiance has any shame,
he will value you.

389
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,563
Why will he care?
He can get countless girls.

390
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,370
Explain to him. Write him a letter.
This is what I have done.

391
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,341
Did you get an answer?

392
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,338
I don't care whether
I get an answer or not.

393
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,210
But if the girl is decent then
she will surely wait for me.

394
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,408
What do you think?
- What?

395
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,576
I mean you too are a girl.

396
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,946
If you had been in her place,
what answer would you have given?

397
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,153
I.. I don't know.

398
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,383
'Milgaya Preetam.'
- What?

399
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,361
Do you have 'Milgaya Preetam?'
- No.

400
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,590
'Pyaar Ki Jwala'?

401
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,465
'Pagal Manwa', 'Pyase Naina',
'Shyam ki Jogan.'

402
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,503
'Ho Gaye Darshan?'
- No.

403
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,404
Are you satisfied now?

404
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,167
Actually this is the first
time that I am hearing such names.

405
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,370
Even we can see that
this is the first time.

406
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,071
Come on. Let's find
it somewhere else.

407
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,185
'Milgaya Preetam', 'Pyaar
Ki Jwala' and 'Pyase Naina.'

408
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,517
The young girls in our
country read such kind of books!

409
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,389
If your life is good,
then why not read it?

410
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,325
Somebody can read.
Somebody craves to read.

411
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,463
What's the price of this book?

412
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,930
You don't worry about the price.

413
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,263
Read it and then return it.
- Thanks.

414
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,466
Hey, Tiger!

415
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,939
You didn't pay for the book.
That's why he caught you.

416
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,463
Don't tease me, Kanha.

417
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,592
Go away.

418
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,235
Don't tease me, Kanha.

419
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,965
Go away.

420
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:54,169
I got tired of imploring to you.

421
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,443
I got tired of imploring to you.

422
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,449
Don't tease me, Kanha.

423
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,917
Go away.

424
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,148
Don't tease me, Kanha.

425
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,553
Go away.

426
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,216
Go away, naughty one.

427
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,351
Don't come and trouble
me at the river bank.

428
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,291
Don't pull my veil.
Let me leave quickly.

429
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,454
I am getting late.

430
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,157
The society is cruel.
You are shameless.

431
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,324
You are a betrayer. A betrayer.

432
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,562
My heart is beating fast.

433
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,135
My body is trembling.

434
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,107
Move from my path.

435
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:39,847
The road is lonely.
There is flash of lightening.

436
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:48,995
The road is lonely.
There is flash of lightening.

437
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:53,863
Don't tease me.
My anklet is tinkling.

438
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,873
Don't tease me.
My anklet is tinkling.

439
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,275
Gokul's thief, don't harass me.

440
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,847
Don't tease me, Kanha.

441
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,110
Go away.

442
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,209
Don't tease me, Kanha.

443
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,548
Go away.

444
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,823
I am a fair girl
with mesmerizing eyes.

445
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:15,950
I am a village girl.

446
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,120
I am a beautiful girl.

447
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,288
How many times do
I explain to you?

448
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,559
I am endearing.

449
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,270
What do I do? You hold my hands.

450
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,340
Murali, don't touch my body.

451
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:39,248
Kanhaiya, my veil is sliding.

452
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:48,221
Kanhaiya, my veil is sliding.

453
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:53,158
The bangles clink in my hands.

454
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:57,325
The bangles clink in my hands.

455
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:01,531
Brij's Kishore, don't harass me.

456
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,103
Don't tease me, Kanha.

457
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,267
Go away.

458
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,538
Don't tease me, Kanha.

459
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,906
Go away.

460
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,108
Don't tease me, Kanha.

461
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,310
Don't tease me, Kanha.

462
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,388
Don't tease me, Kanha.

463
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,546
Go away.

464
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,282
Sudha!

465
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,452
Ladies and Gentlemen!

466
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,524
I want to announce some good news!

467
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:07,898
I have fixed my daughter
Sudha's marriage.. with Mr. Shankar.

468
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:16,077
Congratulations!

469
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,551
Sudha! Why did you leave the
guests and come like this?

470
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:32,561
I don't like the man with
whom you want to get me married.

471
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,226
Why didn't you ask me?

472
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,559
I didn't think it was necessary.

473
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,462
Shankar is a decent man.
He is capable. He is handsome.

474
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,331
Besides all this.. he is
handling my business smoothly.

475
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,138
How rich is he?

476
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,972
You don't have the
right to ask this!

477
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,942
Because if a person's wealth
is the criteria for friendship..

478
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,844
..then the marriage
criteria should be reserve bank.

479
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,047
Don't talk rubbish!

480
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,020
Do you think I am a puppet?

481
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,523
That you can make me
dance to your tunes.

482
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,853
Sudha!

483
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,022
If this was the case,
why did you educate me?

484
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,190
Why did you send me abroad?

485
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,994
So that you would understand
what is right and what is wrong.

486
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,997
But you still don't understand this.

487
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,800
Though I had
forbidden you so many times..

488
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,172
..still you didn't
stop meeting Sukain.

489
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,345
So I had to announce
your wedding with Shankar!

490
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,813
If you want to take advantage
of somebody's helplessness..

491
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:29,114
..and make yourself happy..
then you can do so, father.

492
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,812
But.. but if today my
mother had been alive..

493
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,552
..then you wouldn't have done this!

494
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:48,328
Meeting you is more
difficult than meeting God!

495
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,408
I get to meet Him every Tuesday.

496
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,374
Have a seat. Feel comfortable.

497
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,580
Tell me. How are things at home?

498
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,310
When is the case's hearing?
- On the 20th.

499
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:06,988
Mr. Sukain, I have heard that
the opposition party is very rich.

500
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,786
Then how are you
fighting the case against him?

501
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,891
What else? I trust the truth!

502
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,787
If somebody snatches
away everything by fraud..

503
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,834
..then we should at
least fight for justice.

504
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,103
Do fight. Do fight.

505
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:25,005
But Mr. Sukain, this business
can't run just on the basis of truth.

506
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,475
I mean this world is very bad.

507
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,179
Give and take
doesn't happen like this.

508
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,110
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

509
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:37,811
I mean you have
already borrowed 3000 rupees.

510
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,456
And today you are
asking for 1 000 rupees more.

511
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:45,860
After winning the case,
you will return my money.

512
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,826
But God forbid..
if the disputant won..

513
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,299
..then what about my money?

514
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,892
It is a thing to ponder upon.

515
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,029
But you didn't lend the
money just on this basis.

516
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,465
My mother's jewellery
are mortgaged with you.

517
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,775
Yes. For 1000 rupees
that I am asking now..

518
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,315
..I don't have anything to mortgage.

519
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,077
And I can't even give you
the hope of winning the case.

520
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,784
If you trust me that
I will repay your money..

521
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,288
..only then will I take this money.

522
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,824
Listen! Listen!
Mr. Sukain, where are you going?

523
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,292
Will you return empty
handed from my place?

524
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,888
I consider this money as bad debts.

525
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:25,363
I am trusting you and giving
you the money so the interest..

526
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,231
How much interest will you take?
- 1 5 rupees.

527
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,867
Fine!

528
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:38,909
But Mr. Sukain, you will have to
return this money within 3 months.

529
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,375
I will return it.

530
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:45,444
Listen! Write it. I am giving
him the money. Please sign.

531
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,416
Next!

532
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,261
I regret it, Sukain.

533
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,832
If your father was willing to
change with the changing times..

534
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,496
..then he would have
never lost this case.

535
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,035
Okay, lawyer. Greetings.

536
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,091
Don't pick.

537
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:36,338
I've heard a lot. I don't
want anybody's sympathy.

538
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,345
Mother!

539
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,126
Brother, did you hear?
- Yes.

540
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,360
Mother!
- Now what will happen, Satyan?

541
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,562
Mother, now what will happen?

542
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,973
Unnecessarily you are worrying.

543
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:14,042
By worrying we won't
win back the lost case.

544
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:19,345
This is not so, Satyan! I am
thinking about your father.

545
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,846
Since the time he has
heard the news of the defeat..

546
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,148
..he has become quiet.

547
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,588
He doesn't even talk.
Already he is sick.

548
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,089
His body is weak.

549
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,858
If this continues, then God knows..

550
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,298
..how long he will stay with us.

551
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,070
This is the problem with
people of old generation.

552
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,613
I always told father.

553
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,180
To give him half the
share and make a compromise.

554
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,986
Then today this
wouldn't have happened.

555
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,186
Compromise with injustice?
- Yes. - Brother!

556
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,424
Look, Sujata! These
are not the old times.

557
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,923
Forget about justice and injustice.

558
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,891
Wining or losing the case
doesn't depend on truth and lie!

559
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,956
It depends on witness and evidence.

560
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,826
If we had not fought for
truth and had we compromised..

561
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,337
..with injustice, then
it would have been better!

562
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:19,307
Never! No compromise with injustice!

563
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,137
Father might have lost
in his battle for truth!

564
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,039
But always remember!

565
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,309
In front of duty
and God, he has won!

566
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,050
Yes, he has won. But
after losing everything.

567
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,248
You can't convince your lenders..

568
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,587
..on the basis of duty and God!

569
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,451
It's astonishing, Satyan!

570
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,360
You want to assure the lenders..

571
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,590
..taking the name of duty and God!

572
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,859
But such huge debt.. the
expenses of this huge house..

573
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,868
..father's treatment,
Deepu and Meenu's studies..

574
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,164
..Sujata's marriage.

575
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,867
Brother.. if you had
been even a bit practical..

576
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,501
..then today you wouldn't have
praised truth so much! - Keep quiet!

577
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,872
Did you want to take
the support of wealth..

578
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,504
..Iike a rich man's greedy son?

579
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,310
You are a weak man, Satyan!
That's why you talk like this!

580
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,185
Father has raised us!
He educated us!

581
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,420
So that we would find his flaws.

582
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,825
During this difficult time,
when you should be..

583
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,834
..assuring and
encouraging your parents..

584
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,132
..you are breaking their hearts
and creating rift in this family!

585
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,567
Sukain!
- No, mother! You..

586
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,031
Satyan said all this in his sorrow.

587
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,336
Otherwise isn't he sensible?

588
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:27,902
Yes, he is, mother.

589
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,841
But the day he should
have been more sensible..

590
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,575
..that day itself he
became insensible!

591
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,449
This is what I regret.

592
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:44,885
Satyan.. by worrying
you will feel burdened.

593
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,596
Learn to fight with the world.
And remember one thing.

594
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,597
Not all fathers leave
inheritance for their sons.

595
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,168
The happiness that we have
received.. is that any less?

596
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,371
Today we will think.. that
our father never had anything.

597
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,117
Father.
- Yes. Brother is here.

598
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:29,468
Father! I met Mr. Hari on
the way. He is fine now.

599
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,835
After taking a bath in
Dehradun's holy waters..

600
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,569
..his ailment has alleviated.

601
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:35,411
I have written a letter
to my friend there. - Why?

602
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,378
Father, I want you to go
there for your treatment.

603
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,145
What are you saying, Sukain?

604
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,284
After losing the case, all
these things seem like a joke.

605
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:51,357
Son! Now we only have
this ramshackle mansion.

606
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,587
Mother, who says so?

607
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,066
Don't you have two sons?

608
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,861
Surely. But the expense
of such a huge mansion..

609
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,804
..repayment of the debts, Satyan's
fees, your father's treatment..

610
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,807
..how can we meet
all these expenses..

611
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,537
..with your monthly
salary of 250 rupees?

612
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,538
Mother, you
shouldn't think like this.

613
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,551
With our education, can't we
earn more than 250 rupees?

614
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,543
I just need your blessing, mother.

615
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,548
Everything will be fine.

616
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,020
In the next year he too
will become an attorney.

617
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,559
Mother, maybe even you don't
know how much Satyan will earn!

618
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,430
Sujata, why are you quiet?

619
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,459
Tell mother.. that I am
BA pass. I too will work.

620
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,570
Then my mother will only
count money day and night.

621
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,831
Mother won't even
have time to talk to us.

622
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,219
Savitri! Did you see how my son is?

623
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,860
If your child is so
sensible then it is the sign..

624
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,157
..of parents' good deeds.

625
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,094
I have not lost,
Savitri! Now I have no sorrow.

626
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,394
This is the reward that God
has given me for my truth.

627
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,531
What happiness can
be greater than this?

628
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,199
Meenu ran away, brother!

629
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,877
Is that so? Then go and nab her.

630
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,547
Brother, do you know
why Meenu ran away? - No!

631
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,220
Meenu has heard your talks!

632
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,382
Really?
- Yes.

633
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,550
She heard everything?

634
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,261
Now what will happen?
Did you hear it?

635
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:39,995
I.. I didn't want to hear it.
But Meenu dragged me.

636
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,396
You are lying!
Brother, he had dragged me!

637
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,033
Liar! I had dragged you?
- Yes!

638
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,576
I had dragged you?
- Yes!

639
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,579
Deepu, let go of her hair!

640
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,412
Brother, shall I tell
you what Deepu told me?

641
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,145
Meenu, I won't spare you!

642
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,845
Deepu! Now you keep quiet!
Tell me, Meenu.

643
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,091
Deepu was saying that
father has lost the case.

644
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:06,993
So we will have to work.
- Really?

645
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,060
Brother, shall I tell you something?

646
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,964
Meenu has buried one cent
in the ground. - Is that so?

647
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,798
Yes. And she says l
will water it everyday.

648
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,806
When the tree will grow up,
it will give money.

649
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,374
Foolish girl! Does
money grow on trees?

650
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,006
Yes, it does! Am I right, brother?

651
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,206
Yes, you are right!

652
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,479
And by shaking the tree, it
falls on the ground. - Sir!

653
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,481
What is this? Where
are you both going?

654
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,923
We both have been asked to leave.

655
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,557
Who said it?

656
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,426
Mother has told them to leave.
- Mother?

657
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,129
And you all are quiet?

658
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,929
Who will do the
household chores if they left?

659
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:52,837
Why? Mother and I will do it.

660
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,410
Mother will do it? Where is mother?

661
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,946
Mother! Mother! Mother!

662
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,249
Now what are you all doing?

663
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,825
Why? What happened, son?

664
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,518
Why are Bansi and
Laxmi being sacked?

665
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,330
Son, why are you getting angry?

666
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,858
How will I pay their salary
after the month gets over?

667
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,102
But mother, the
month is still not over.

668
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:21,862
It will get over someday.

669
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,000
Now we can't afford
to keep two servants.

670
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,166
Can't afford? What
are you saying, Satyan?

671
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,810
Cleaning this huge house,
cooking for 1 0 people..

672
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,541
..will mother do all this?

673
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,806
And have you thought how tired..

674
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,112
..mother will become
after doing all this?

675
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,311
What to think?

676
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:41,119
We will have to live
according to our income.

677
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,552
Otherwise don't I want
mother to lead a comfortable life?

678
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,893
Sukain, you want mother to
lead a comfortable life.

679
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,222
But you are not strong.

680
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,560
And you have no
confidence in yourself.

681
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:54,197
Mother! These servants won't go!

682
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,840
The day I feel that l
can't bear these expenses..

683
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,137
..then I will think about this.

684
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,512
Besides this Kalpana is your fiance.

685
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,780
If this had happened
after your marriage..

686
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,258
..would you have left your wife?

687
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,425
That would have been
a different matter.

688
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,956
Then we would have to support..

689
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,089
..each other even during bad times.

690
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,797
So why don't you
believe that now too..

691
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,802
..Kalpana
empathize with your sorrow?

692
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:32,267
Alliance is not a weak bond.
It is tied to the heart.

693
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,541
I am just giving Kalpana
another chance to think.

694
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,014
If she wants, she can
marry somebody else.

695
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,550
This is wrong, Satyan.
Girl's heart can't be sold.

696
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,356
You can't buy it and
sell it whenever you want.

697
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:57,826
And also know that I didn't
decide to get my daughter..

698
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,870
..married to you
after seeing your wealth.

699
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,330
I had made the
decision after seeing you.

700
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,276
Don't hurt others because
you are angry at your fate!

701
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,437
Who? Kalpana!

702
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,154
I think it's better if you
tell Kalpana to take the decision.

703
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,424
What were you saying to father?

704
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,992
Look, Kalpana!
Don't misunderstand me.

705
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,238
I am doing all this
for your happiness.

706
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:38,232
What will people say?

707
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,434
That your father has got his
daughter married to a poor man.

708
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,107
And what will people say if
the marriage is cancelled?

709
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,908
That you lost the case.. so
we broke off the engagement.

710
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:52,020
Look, Kalpana!
Don't misunderstand me.

711
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,185
You have been
raised with great care.

712
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,020
How will you live with a poor man?

713
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,252
Poor! Poor! Poor!

714
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,192
Why do you call yourself as poor?

715
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,463
Love, peace, happiness. Are
all these weighed with money?

716
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,299
You have come to assert your love!

717
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,575
Kalpana, will you be able to
live with me in any condition?

718
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:21,349
A woman loves just once.
Just once, Satyan.

719
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,581
On my birthday you had said
you will always be by my side.

720
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,153
And today you yourself..

721
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:33,054
Forgive me, Kalpana!
- Today you have hurt me a lot.

722
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,425
How do I please you?

723
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,160
Come with me. I will tell you.

724
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,963
Remember? On my
birthday you had taken me out.

725
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,400
Today I will take you out. Come.

726
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:07,190
I think Satyan is not
in a good mood. - Yes.

727
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:11,026
For a man whose mood is bad,
sea shore is not a good place.

728
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,567
He will feel like drowning.

729
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:13,927
You don't mean to say that!

730
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,870
Exactly! Satyan wants to drown!

731
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,138
Now what should I do?
- First you drown.

732
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,301
Me?
- Yes.

733
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,935
But I don't know swimming.

734
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,340
That's even better.

735
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,042
Seeing you drowning, he
will come to save you.

736
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:31,586
And saving his beloved
will cheer up his mood.

737
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,913
Think about it.
- Really? - Yes.

738
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,459
Since when I am walking with you.

739
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,505
But not even for a
minute did you look at me.

740
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:52,600
You are just fulfilling
the duty of coming with me.

741
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:57,070
Why is your mood bad?
Why don't you get well?

742
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:02,349
Problem, poverty.. such
circumstances spoil your mood.

743
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,813
If you won't talk to me properly..

744
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,550
..I will plunge into the water!

745
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,829
Fine. You can't smile
with me then maybe..

746
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,457
..you will smile after my death.

747
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,830
Kalpana! Kalpana!

748
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,843
Kalpana! Kalpana!

749
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,472
Kalpana!

750
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,410
Kalpana!

751
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,114
He saved her! He saved her!

752
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,311
Mr. Anand, what about my money?

753
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,821
Oh no!
- Come! Come! Come! - Hey.

754
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,468
The twilight is lovely.

755
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,171
The tresses are strewn.

756
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:15,973
Your each grace is charming.

757
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:21,379
Today the sun won't rise.

758
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:26,183
Today the sun won't rise.

759
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,917
The twilight is lovely.

760
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,423
The tresses are strewn.

761
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:36,158
Your each grace is charming.

762
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:41,394
Today the sun won't rise.

763
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:46,134
Today the sun won't rise.

764
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,575
The twilight is lovely.

765
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:08,429
This ambience has
come to a standstill.

766
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:13,895
After seeing these lovely graces.

767
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:18,531
This ambience has
come to a standstill.

768
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:24,007
After seeing these lovely graces.

769
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:28,483
The heartbeats have gone to sleep.

770
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:36,315
After seeing these
intoxicating eyes.

771
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,122
The twilight is lovely.

772
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,455
The tresses are strewn.

773
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:46,297
Your each grace is charming.

774
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:51,567
Today the sun won't rise.

775
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:56,403
Today the sun won't rise.

776
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,846
The twilight is lovely.

777
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:18,798
The lively mischief.

778
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:24,099
The caravan of spring.

779
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:28,541
The lively mischief.

780
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:34,006
The caravan of spring.

781
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:38,554
We both are walking together.

782
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:46,020
With nobody else.

783
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,563
The twilight is lovely.

784
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,130
The tresses are strewn.

785
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:55,568
Your each grace is charming.

786
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,969
Today the sun won't rise.

787
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:05,877
Today the sun won't rise.

788
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:09,279
The twilight is lovely.

789
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,555
You both have ice-cream.
I will just be back.

790
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,015
Look, come soon.

791
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,232
Leave! Where are you taking me?

792
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,395
Hey! Leave me!

793
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,438
I will do it. Thank you.

794
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,776
Look, wherever you all will
work on behalf of Forward..

795
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:13,782
..Employment.. be it at
Diwan and Koki Cement factory..

796
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,410
..or iron factory or textile mills..

797
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,782
..you should remember
that whatever work you do..

798
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,791
..you should do it
honestly and your employers..

799
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,986
..should not have any
complaints about you.

800
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,990
Have faith in us, Mr. Sukain.

801
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:29,324
We won't give any
chance of complain.

802
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,359
Hey!

803
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,100
Yes! I want to say one more thing.

804
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,795
There are some
people in our country..

805
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,535
..who become our country's
enemy for the sake of money.

806
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:43,173
For profit of 2000 rupees, they
make our country lose 1 0 lakhs.

807
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,406
We should never forgive such people.

808
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,817
So if you all see any such
blunder in your factory or mill..

809
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,546
..then immediately inform me.

810
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,320
We will report to the police.

811
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,185
We will inform the government.
Understood?

812
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,348
Yes!

813
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,187
Fine.
- Now you people can leave!

814
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,851
Greetings!
- Greetings!

815
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,562
Oh! You! So Tiger brought you here!

816
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,565
Yes. But I didn't steal anything.

817
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,036
Okay. Come on,
Tiger! Come on! Come in!

818
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,143
Excuse me!

819
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,311
Forward Employment.

820
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,481
Yes. Yes, yes.

821
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,052
How many labourers do you need?

822
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:35,864
15! Oh! Yes, yes! Yes, yes!

823
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,500
I will do that! Okay! Bye, bye!

824
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,969
So you have expanded your work.

825
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,606
I am trying. Excuse me.

826
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,968
Forward Employment. Yes, yes.

827
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:52,446
6 BA, BD teachers. Yes, yes, yes!

828
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,975
Yes! Oh yes! Within a week's time!

829
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,983
Okay! Bye-bye!

830
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:07,026
If today your fiance had seen all
this, she would have been pleased.

831
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,562
She doesn't have the
time to come here.

832
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,868
Yes! Did you receive any
answer of your letter?

833
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,029
It's still not the right time.
You tell me about yourself.

834
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,038
My condition is worst than before!

835
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,267
I am fed up of searching for work.

836
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,878
Look, don't worry. I
will get a job for you.

837
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:29,145
What job? Teacher in some
old school for 60 rupees.

838
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,148
Some secretary for 1 25 rupees.

839
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,588
Or nurse in charitable
hospital for 1 50 rupees.

840
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,482
Is this the kind of
job you can get for me?

841
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,358
This is man's world.

842
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:42,056
Only men handle
lucrative businesses.

843
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,258
Women are only for serving others.

844
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,233
Yes. You are right.
It's not right also.

845
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:52,166
There are some jobs..
that only women can do.

846
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,402
Is this music notation book yours?

847
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:58,170
Yes. I am organising
a program for a cafe.

848
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,280
Look, I have an idea. Do you dance?

849
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,253
When my family was in better state,
I had learnt everything.

850
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:09,323
Music, dance,
poetry. I know everything.

851
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:10,483
That's great!

852
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:13,887
Shall we try?

853
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:39,280
I am telling you! Fine! I will see!

854
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,858
Mr. Sukain.. if these
ruffians found out..

855
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,860
..that we have informed the police..

856
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,897
..then they will ruin our job.

857
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,229
Fearing this, we
can't harm our country!

858
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,332
When the need arise,
we will fight for you.

859
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,871
And if you help to
nab the ruffians..

860
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,168
..then the
government will reward you.

861
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,538
Custom department! - Please connect
me to the inspector of customs!

862
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,338
What did you say?

863
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,176
Clothes are being stolen
from Mr. Dhanpat's mill?

864
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,010
Corruption department!

865
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,545
Is that inspector Bhosale speaking?

866
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,457
I am calling from
Forward Employment.

867
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,821
The cement that Diwan
and company is delivering..

868
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,023
..to Nagrol dam, it is adulterated.

869
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,359
Please check it immediately.

870
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:28,861
Yes. I have found out.
Thank you. Yes.

871
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,569
Mr. Shankar, Mr. Diwan has not come?

872
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,403
He should be here. I have
told him the meeting time.

873
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,571
Okay.

874
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,274
The police's anti
corruption department has found out.

875
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,580
Now what will happen, Mr. Shankar?
- What will happen?

876
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,250
We will have to shut down
our business for sometime.

877
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,153
Who has informed the police?

878
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,892
The proprietor of
Forward Employment.

879
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,156
His name is Sukain.

880
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:59,595
There are only two
ways to stop this man.

881
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,529
One is to banish all his workers.

882
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:07,102
The other.. to get
rid of Sukain forever.

883
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,111
Are you saying to kill him?

884
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:16,351
Not l.. we all want this.

885
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:20,448
But what do you think?
Will Mr. Diwan approve of this?

886
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:38,302
Hello. Mr. Diwan? Yes,
this is Shankar speaking.

887
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,899
Shankar, I am stuck
in some urgent work.

888
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,571
I won't be able to make it.
You conduct the meeting.

889
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,581
Remember one thing.

890
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,944
Nowadays labourers are
posing a big problem.

891
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,586
Don't take the law
in your own hands.

892
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,957
Yes! Okay! Right.

893
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,356
Yes. I am doing everything
as per your instructions.

894
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,526
You don't worry. I will
do exactly what you want.

895
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,238
So did you all hear that?
Please come.

896
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,312
So the plan is to hire goons
to kill Sukain tomorrow morning.

897
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,247
And to set his shop ablaze.

898
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:25,115
But this will require 2000 rupees.

899
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,456
Labour will be mine.
Finance will be yours.

900
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,283
Is that fine?

901
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,020
Yes!
- Yes!

902
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,960
Tell Mr. Sukain that you
have got a job in a school.

903
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,570
And tomorrow you have to go
for a picnic with the children.

904
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,373
Make the excuse that
the driver is sick.

905
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:50,845
And tell him to become
the driver for a day.

906
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,847
Will he agree?

907
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,577
Why do you worry? Send
the children to the office.

908
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,147
They will surely convince him.

909
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,977
But why don't you tell
him about the goons?

910
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:03,053
He is very stubborn.
He won't listen to me.

911
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,217
And I am afraid my
secret will be exposed.

912
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,531
Be careful. Nobody
should come to know.

913
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,859
Yes, boss!
- Okay!

914
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,329
Aunt was saying that you
drive faster than the driver.

915
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,059
Uncle, please come.

916
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,032
Please, uncle. Come.

917
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,263
Come, uncle!
- Please, uncle!

918
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,830
Come! Come! Come!
Come! Please, uncle!

919
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,569
Come! Come! Come!

920
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,075
Where is Mr. Sukain?

921
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:13,352
So you are that aunt?
- And you are the driver.

922
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,188
What is all this?

923
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,527
The thing is that I have
got a job as a teacher.

924
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,301
I will have to take them
for picnic once a week.

925
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,099
But the driver fell sick.

926
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,536
That's why today l
have become the driver.

927
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,469
You are my last hope.

928
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,009
But today I have some urgent work!

929
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,275
So you only convince the children.
I will not interfere.

930
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,810
Listen! - Come! Please,
uncle! Come! Please, uncle!

931
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,153
Come! Come! Uncle, come!

932
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,355
You are very smart!
- What?

933
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,402
Children have got a good idea!

934
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,300
Uncle too is not bad.

935
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:39,172
When we walk.

936
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:43,349
This world sways.

937
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:47,554
Our desires.

938
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,150
Touch the sky.

939
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:55,190
When we walk.

940
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,898
This world sways.

941
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,799
Our desires.

942
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,806
Touch the sky.

943
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,970
When we walk.

944
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:39,872
We are approaching the new world.

945
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,105
We are the path of the new spring.

946
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,546
When we laugh, each flower laughs.

947
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:52,110
When we walk, life walks.

948
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,850
In all the sceneries, in flowers
and stars, we have cast a spell.

949
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:59,357
When we walk.

950
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,258
This world sways.

951
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,897
Our desires.

952
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,197
Touch the sky.

953
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,838
When we walk.

954
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:37,590
We spread colours and
flowers in the atmosphere.

955
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,959
We are the honour of this land.

956
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,598
We create the rivers.

957
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:49,877
We give freshness all around.

958
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:53,879
In all the sceneries, in flowers
and stars, we have cast a spell.

959
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:57,884
When we walk.

960
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,572
All the problems have alleviated.

961
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:30,041
The destination is so close.

962
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,883
Seeing the courage of youth.

963
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,857
The distances have bridged.

964
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:41,895
In all the sceneries, in flowers
and stars, we have cast a spell.

965
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,397
When we walk.

966
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:49,595
This world sways.

967
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:53,873
Our desires.

968
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,909
Touch the sky.

969
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:02,178
When we walk.

970
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:05,944
Rampyari! Sita! Come here!

971
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:12,310
It's so strange! This
couple have so many children!

972
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,447
I am sure something is
the matter. Ask them.

973
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,184
What rubbish! Go away!

974
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,452
Why are you getting angry, ma'am?

975
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,255
We are not casting an evil eye.

976
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:21,829
May you give birth to
another 1 0 children!

977
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:19,012
Oh my God! Look how
they are holding hands!

978
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,214
And they say they share no relation!

979
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:24,224
Didn't I say? They are lovers.

980
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,020
They are feeling shy.

981
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,855
Oh my God!

982
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,127
They are feeling more shy!

983
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:12,802
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

984
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:17,537
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

985
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:22,408
When friends ask me,
I remain quiet.

986
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:27,012
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

987
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:58,386
I feel shy when I hear your name.

988
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,817
When I hear your name, beloved.

989
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,857
When I hear your name.

990
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:09,830
My tender age will be degraded.

991
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,430
Will be degraded, beloved.

992
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,525
Will be degraded.

993
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:19,337
Oh my God! Oh my God!
What do I do?

994
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:24,105
Oh my God! Oh my God!
What do I do?

995
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,804
What do I do?

996
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:28,445
You are..
- You are..

997
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:32,816
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

998
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:37,857
When friends ask me,
I remain quiet.

999
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,124
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

1000
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:12,856
God knows what your eyes said.

1001
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:15,391
God knows what it said, beloved.

1002
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:17,294
God knows what it said.

1003
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:24,100
Beads of sweat
formed on my forehead.

1004
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:28,540
Beads of sweat. Beads of sweat.

1005
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:33,447
I wipe the sweat unconsciously.

1006
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:37,541
I wipe the sweat unconsciously.

1007
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,810
I wipe the sweat.

1008
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:42,354
You are..
- You are..

1009
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:46,894
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

1010
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:51,191
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

1011
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:56,029
When friends ask me,
I remain quiet.

1012
01:17:56,171 --> 01:18:00,301
How do I say that
you are my beloved?

1013
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:31,188
I don't understand
how it caught fire.

1014
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:32,823
I think its Shankar's doing!

1015
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:33,992
You are right!

1016
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,933
Since morning Shankar's men
were making rounds of the shop.

1017
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:37,799
He has not only burned the shop..

1018
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,433
..he has made us unemployed.

1019
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,169
That's why tomorrow all the
workers are going on a strike.

1020
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,469
Mr. Sukain, can I ask you something?

1021
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,005
Who was the girl who had
come to meet you that day?

1022
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,118
Yesterday I saw her with Shankar.

1023
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,448
What are you saying!
She is very poor!

1024
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:56,115
She lied to you. I
think she is quite rich.

1025
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,126
I had come to meet you yesterday.

1026
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,257
You were lucky. I didn't meet you.

1027
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:10,366
There is still time. If you
want to live, then go away!

1028
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,838
Mr. Shankar, the person who
doesn't even have the guts..

1029
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:14,842
..to ask for his rights..
for him there is..

1030
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,969
..no difference
between life and death!

1031
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,119
Hello. Police emergency.

1032
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:34,055
I am calling from Diwan mills.
There is a strike here.

1033
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:36,922
You!

1034
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,857
So now Rai Bahadur Amarnath's son..

1035
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,130
..has come to take revenge
from me as chief of goons.

1036
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:49,408
I didn't know.. poverty could
make a person stoop to this level!

1037
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,106
We are not goons.

1038
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,510
People who adulterate cement,
they are goons!

1039
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:57,880
Those who make fake medicines!

1040
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:01,347
Those who smuggle liquor,
clothes, food grains and money.

1041
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,914
They are not just goons.. they
are robbers, monsters and traitors!

1042
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,987
For their profit, they
ruin so many families!

1043
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,392
Its all lies! It's false!

1044
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,391
You can't falsely accuse Diwan!

1045
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,366
We had even accused British rulers.

1046
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:17,269
They were our enemy.

1047
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,940
But they were true
to their community!

1048
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,035
I have complains from you!

1049
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:26,306
Being an lndian, you are mugging
your lndia and lndian brothers

1050
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:29,577
Never in my life have
I gone against the law.

1051
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,149
Stop this rubbish!
Go away from here!

1052
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,854
Today these labourers have
come to ask for their rights..

1053
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,584
..not to leave!

1054
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,859
You and Mr. Shankar
will have to explain..

1055
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:42,055
..why these workers
have been banished?

1056
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,495
Because they were not
loyal to their employers!

1057
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,864
Why don't you say that in
spite of being poor and starved..

1058
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,496
..they were not traitors!

1059
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,498
We didn't ask for patriots!

1060
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:54,873
And working doesn't mean
that a person has to sell..

1061
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:57,241
..his religion and his honesty!

1062
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:59,472
I know you people
want to create ruckus!

1063
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,546
Take all of them away!

1064
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,917
Otherwise we will have
to take law in our hands!

1065
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:07,250
Law supports justice, not wealth!

1066
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,860
Run!

1067
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,390
Run!

1068
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,353
Casual ward.
- There.

1069
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,898
Thank you, doctor.

1070
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,107
Rama Devi wants to meet you.

1071
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,272
Rama Devi? Let her in.

1072
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,155
Are you badly hurt?

1073
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,327
Maybe you have come
to dig at my wounds.

1074
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:55,954
No. I have come to see that..

1075
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,588
Whether I am dead or alive!

1076
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,531
What are you saying?
- Look at your face.

1077
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:03,301
You will see deceit in it.
- What?

1078
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:04,804
You took me along with you so that..

1079
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,534
..my shop could be easily burned.

1080
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:10,308
And a poor man could be ruined.

1081
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,808
If this is the punishment
of saving somebody's life..

1082
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,111
..then taunt me as much as you want.

1083
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,111
But there are some things that..

1084
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:21,018
That you don't want to say!
And I don't even want to hear it!

1085
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:23,882
You may go!

1086
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,454
Please leave him alone.
He needs rest.

1087
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:30,489
Nurse please!

1088
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,556
I am sorry! Not now! Please go!

1089
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,278
Yes, inspector. You are right.

1090
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:49,043
I am ready to give
compensation to the workers.

1091
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,049
And I will call
them back on the job!

1092
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,378
You don't worry. They
won't have any complains.

1093
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:55,547
Thank you.

1094
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:02,318
Sir! In other words, we've accepted
defeat in front of the workers.

1095
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:03,855
Am I right, sir?

1096
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,794
Yes! Because without my permission..

1097
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:09,530
..you sacked the workers and
thus were unjust with them!

1098
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:13,939
And as per the police report,
these are your goons.

1099
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,234
But who can prove that?

1100
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:16,469
I can prove that!

1101
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,540
I will give the first testimony!

1102
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,115
And maybe Sukain will
give the second testimony!

1103
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,445
By the way.. is Sukain badly hurt?

1104
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,913
He is brave. He survived.

1105
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,823
Had it been a coward like you..

1106
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:31,552
..even your bones
wouldn't have been found.

1107
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,360
People who want to
kill me, have died, Sudha.

1108
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,561
You are a shameless man!

1109
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,134
You will die but a bit late!

1110
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:44,828
Sudha! I don't understand why
you are interfering in our matters!

1111
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,298
Please go away!

1112
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:48,841
Okay, father. But l
will surely say that..

1113
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:53,279
..he is going to create
problems in your life.

1114
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:56,578
And when you will realise it,
it will be too late.

1115
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,383
Hello! Verma and Company!

1116
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,516
Good afternoon! Yes!

1117
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:08,089
Good morning.
- Good afternoon!

1118
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,528
Good afternoon! Good afternoon?

1119
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:12,090
Hello, Satyan!

1120
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:14,859
Today again you are late.

1121
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,498
You should know that
I leave early too.

1122
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,068
It's a matter of temperament.

1123
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,236
Satyan, I am worried
of only one thing.

1124
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:27,337
If punishment is fixed,
then only task is left!

1125
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:32,809
I will employ all the
Verma Companies in this city..

1126
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,377
..in my company.

1127
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:36,548
How is the idea?
Give me a cigarette.

1128
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,122
I think you get late
because of these plans.

1129
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:40,285
You don't worry.

1130
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,226
I will make you the
general manager in my company.

1131
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,456
Is that so?
- Mr. Anand!

1132
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,197
You too want a job? Okay.

1133
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:47,494
First think about your job!

1134
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,359
Mr. Verma has given
this work for you.

1135
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,528
He will ask about it
as soon as he comes.

1136
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:54,330
Why has he given me work?
I don't know any work!

1137
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:55,932
I always make mistakes!

1138
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,841
Mr. Verma shouts in
front of everybody..

1139
01:26:57,912 --> 01:26:59,846
..that I don't know English!

1140
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,848
I say that old man is stupid.

1141
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,212
Whom are you calling stupid?
- The old man!

1142
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:08,319
Sir, I mean all the youths
in our country are stupid!

1143
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:12,851
Nowadays you have become sensible.
Did you finish the work?

1144
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:15,327
Sir, I will just do it!

1145
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,126
Satyan, come inside.

1146
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,531
What's the matter, Satyan?

1147
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:27,908
Nowadays you seem lost. And
you have also become irregular.

1148
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,842
I am searching for a part time job.

1149
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,342
That's why I get late.

1150
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,006
Part time job? Why?

1151
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,546
You know that I need
money to give exams. So..

1152
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,186
Don't be a child, Satyan!

1153
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:43,117
You just do your work diligently.

1154
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:46,191
I will see to it that
you become an attorney.

1155
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:47,818
And yes.. after
finishing the office work..

1156
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:52,127
..if you do some part time job,
then I don't have any qualm.

1157
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:56,370
I think it will be good for
your family at this stage.

1158
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:58,564
Thank you, sir. It's really,
really very kind of you.

1159
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:03,333
And remember.. I don't
like to see your sad face.

1160
01:28:11,343 --> 01:28:13,538
Bansi! Bansi!

1161
01:28:14,679 --> 01:28:16,738
Its 10 o'clock and Sukain
has still not returned home!

1162
01:28:17,015 --> 01:28:18,073
Bansi!

1163
01:28:19,484 --> 01:28:20,542
Hey, Bansi!

1164
01:28:21,486 --> 01:28:24,011
What's the matter, sir?
- Where is Sukain?

1165
01:28:24,089 --> 01:28:27,149
Sir, he has still not returned.

1166
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:29,293
He has still not returned? Why?

1167
01:28:30,362 --> 01:28:34,025
What is such urgent work!
What urgent work is he doing?

1168
01:28:34,099 --> 01:28:36,363
Why do you get so worried?
What happened?

1169
01:28:36,434 --> 01:28:38,561
Savitri, you don't understand!
It's really bad!

1170
01:28:39,237 --> 01:28:41,034
For our sake, Sukain
gets burdened with debts..

1171
01:28:41,106 --> 01:28:42,698
..I won't let this happen!

1172
01:28:44,242 --> 01:28:45,641
He leaves so early!

1173
01:28:46,044 --> 01:28:48,444
And he comes home so late!
Is this good for his health?

1174
01:28:48,513 --> 01:28:49,571
Is this good?

1175
01:28:49,648 --> 01:28:52,378
Fine! Fine! Today when Sukain
will return home, scold him.

1176
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:55,044
I will surely scold him! What
do you think? I won't scold him!

1177
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,588
Let him come! See how
I teach him a lesson!

1178
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:06,055
I understand everything! I
think he hides things from me.

1179
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,528
Sir, senior sir is calling you.

1180
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:17,331
This doesn't mean that
I let him get spoiled!

1181
01:29:19,611 --> 01:29:21,010
I won't endure this!

1182
01:29:22,214 --> 01:29:23,738
All this won't do at my house! Yes!

1183
01:29:24,349 --> 01:29:26,544
Father! Did you call me?

1184
01:29:29,354 --> 01:29:30,412
No.

1185
01:29:30,488 --> 01:29:32,080
Didn't you call him?

1186
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:34,091
Then why were you
creating commotion?

1187
01:29:34,426 --> 01:29:35,552
Now scold him!

1188
01:29:35,627 --> 01:29:39,028
Yes! Sukain, since many
days I have been observing..

1189
01:29:39,097 --> 01:29:42,089
..that lenders come to meet you.

1190
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:47,229
They meet me too. Have you
borrowed loads of money?

1191
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:51,569
I had borrowed some, father.
But who brought them here?

1192
01:29:54,179 --> 01:29:59,378
Bansi! Mother, nobody in
this house is sensible?

1193
01:30:00,051 --> 01:30:02,576
Father is sick. Why is he
dragged in these problems?

1194
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:03,712
Son..

1195
01:30:03,788 --> 01:30:05,449
No, father. Today I will ask him!

1196
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:08,189
Bansi! Bansi!

1197
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:09,591
No, son! Don't scold anybody!

1198
01:30:10,528 --> 01:30:12,996
It's not his mistake! I
myself had called them.

1199
01:30:13,465 --> 01:30:14,727
Father, you didn't
do the right thing.

1200
01:30:15,467 --> 01:30:16,991
When you know that
you are not well..

1201
01:30:17,068 --> 01:30:19,536
..then why do you do all this?

1202
01:30:20,138 --> 01:30:21,537
No! I am fine!

1203
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:25,070
I know you will
never do anything wrong!

1204
01:30:27,012 --> 01:30:29,071
Go. Freshen up and have your dinner.

1205
01:30:29,347 --> 01:30:31,406
Look at your state!

1206
01:30:35,353 --> 01:30:37,412
Unnecessarily you create ruckus.

1207
01:30:37,622 --> 01:30:40,090
Is that so? Did l
create such commotion?

1208
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:42,217
No! You didn't say anything!

1209
01:30:46,364 --> 01:30:48,628
I forgot to tell you something!
- What?

1210
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:51,225
I have arranged for a part time
job for you in a weekly paper.

1211
01:30:51,503 --> 01:30:53,767
You will have to work for 4
hours at night. Will you do it?

1212
01:30:54,039 --> 01:30:55,097
Yes, brother.

1213
01:30:55,173 --> 01:30:57,437
Good! Today is Saturday. You
will leave early from office.

1214
01:30:57,509 --> 01:31:00,034
I will wait for you at 3
o'clock below your office.

1215
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:02,511
Quickly get ready!
I will just come. - Okay.

1216
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,578
Look, brother!

1217
01:31:10,989 --> 01:31:13,184
Today again you are leaving without
having your breakfast, brother!

1218
01:31:13,258 --> 01:31:15,726
No. I was coming to
meet you only. Give me.

1219
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,529
Look, Sujata! What
I have got for you!

1220
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:30,604
'Hum Hindustani.' I have
already read this book!

1221
01:31:31,076 --> 01:31:32,202
You have read it?

1222
01:31:34,546 --> 01:31:37,413
You don't know, brother?
This book is very famous!

1223
01:31:37,482 --> 01:31:39,211
The writer has written so well!

1224
01:31:39,284 --> 01:31:41,081
All my friends too have read it.

1225
01:31:42,354 --> 01:31:43,412
Drink buttermilk!

1226
01:31:47,158 --> 01:31:49,626
It's so strange! The
writer has not written his name!

1227
01:31:50,028 --> 01:31:51,222
He has just signed on it.

1228
01:31:51,429 --> 01:31:54,227
I think he must have
regretted not writing his name.

1229
01:31:54,299 --> 01:31:55,357
You don't know.

1230
01:31:55,433 --> 01:31:58,231
He wrote this book to
earn money not fame.

1231
01:31:58,303 --> 01:32:00,237
Do you know him, brother?
- Then what!

1232
01:32:00,305 --> 01:32:03,035
Now I understood.. why many
things written in this book..

1233
01:32:03,108 --> 01:32:04,166
..resembles with our family.

1234
01:32:04,242 --> 01:32:05,436
I am sure you must have told him!

1235
01:32:07,178 --> 01:32:09,442
Brother, introduce
my friends to him!

1236
01:32:10,115 --> 01:32:12,174
You got shocked as if you
are the writer of this book!

1237
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,979
Fool! If he has not
even written his name..

1238
01:32:14,052 --> 01:32:16,714
..then will he come to
listen to your friends' praises?

1239
01:32:17,322 --> 01:32:18,380
Take this!

1240
01:32:19,257 --> 01:32:22,192
Brother, where are
you going? Finish this!

1241
01:32:30,402 --> 01:32:31,596
Why are you writing so slowly?

1242
01:32:32,337 --> 01:32:36,205
Have you understood that law point?
- Yes!

1243
01:32:36,274 --> 01:32:37,332
You have not understood anything!

1244
01:32:38,076 --> 01:32:40,203
Unnecessarily you
pretend to be intelligent!

1245
01:32:41,012 --> 01:32:43,412
Open this law book and see!
Then write the draft!

1246
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:49,012
Satyan! I have told you to
wait after office hours..

1247
01:32:49,087 --> 01:32:51,214
..as I have an urgent work.

1248
01:32:51,489 --> 01:32:53,286
I can't trust Anand in this matter.

1249
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:02,361
My client, Shivraj, is coming.
He needs money immediately.

1250
01:33:02,634 --> 01:33:05,501
So instead of cheque, give him cash.

1251
01:33:06,571 --> 01:33:10,098
Do you have the cupboard's key?
- Yes.

1252
01:33:10,975 --> 01:33:12,033
Yes.

1253
01:33:13,311 --> 01:33:14,369
I think he has come!

1254
01:33:18,983 --> 01:33:21,508
My brother has come.
I will just come.

1255
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:25,379
Satyan, since when I was
waiting for you downstairs.

1256
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:28,049
And you are still here. Let's go.

1257
01:33:28,126 --> 01:33:30,390
Mr. Verma has told me to
stay back for some urgent work.

1258
01:33:30,462 --> 01:33:32,191
It will get over soon.
You have a seat.

1259
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,525
7, 8, 9, 1 0. This is 1 0,000 rupees.

1260
01:33:39,003 --> 01:33:40,197
Give it to Shivraj when he comes.

1261
01:33:40,271 --> 01:33:41,738
And don't forget to
take the stamp receipt.

1262
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:43,198
Keep it safely.

1263
01:33:54,152 --> 01:33:55,210
You didn't count the money?

1264
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,078
You have counted it.

1265
01:34:00,225 --> 01:34:04,025
I can't wait any longer.
Finish this work and then go home.

1266
01:34:21,312 --> 01:34:22,370
I think this is Shivraj's car!

1267
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:25,382
Yes, sir! This is Shivraj's car!
It's definitely Shivraj's car!

1268
01:34:27,051 --> 01:34:30,043
Shiv! I should also go!

1269
01:34:54,012 --> 01:34:55,070
Brother! Come inside!

1270
01:35:17,569 --> 01:35:18,627
What's the matter, Satyan?

1271
01:35:18,970 --> 01:35:20,369
Why Mr. Verma ran
out looking so worried?

1272
01:35:21,172 --> 01:35:23,037
We were waiting for our client.

1273
01:35:23,174 --> 01:35:24,573
I think he has met with an accident.

1274
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:26,508
It was a terrible accident!

1275
01:35:27,312 --> 01:35:29,177
Satyan! Mr. Verma
is calling you down!

1276
01:35:29,247 --> 01:35:31,511
He told me to sit here! Go quickly!

1277
01:35:32,383 --> 01:35:33,577
Brother, take care.
I will just come.

1278
01:35:33,985 --> 01:35:40,049
Oh! Sukain is here! I
will just go down and come.

1279
01:35:40,124 --> 01:35:42,524
What a wonderful accident!
I will just come!

1280
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:02,402
Look, Satyan! Shivraj is badly hurt.

1281
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,074
I will take him to the hospital.
You keep the money with you.

1282
01:36:05,149 --> 01:36:07,208
We will look after the
rest on Monday morning. Fine?

1283
01:36:10,288 --> 01:36:11,346
Where are you coming?

1284
01:36:11,422 --> 01:36:13,014
Sir, during such times
I should be with you!

1285
01:36:17,295 --> 01:36:18,489
What happened?
- Let's leave!

1286
01:36:18,563 --> 01:36:21,361
Yes! Hurry up! I have given
them 3 o'clock appointment.

1287
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,358
The key!

1288
01:36:24,302 --> 01:36:25,963
I was going to forget the key here!

1289
01:36:26,304 --> 01:36:28,033
Thank God you were here!

1290
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:32,367
Let's go, brother!

1291
01:36:33,378 --> 01:36:37,246
What will I say in the court?
What answer will I give?

1292
01:36:38,316 --> 01:36:39,374
I don't even know!

1293
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:42,509
In my name there are
3-4 bogus companies too!

1294
01:36:42,587 --> 01:36:45,181
Bogus companies!
This is impossible, sir!

1295
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,582
What do you mean impossible?

1296
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:51,193
Today the police have
seized liquor from my truck.

1297
01:36:51,262 --> 01:36:52,661
What justification
do I have for that?

1298
01:36:54,532 --> 01:36:58,400
I will have to find out
who is responsible for this!

1299
01:36:59,203 --> 01:37:01,728
Sir! Leave that on me!

1300
01:37:03,007 --> 01:37:04,406
I will nab that ruffian!

1301
01:37:06,077 --> 01:37:07,669
Let me see how he escapes from me.

1302
01:37:20,491 --> 01:37:24,154
3 shirts, 2 pants
and a pair of socks.

1303
01:37:24,495 --> 01:37:27,157
And brother Satyan's
dirty handkerchief!

1304
01:37:28,366 --> 01:37:29,958
Wash all the clothes
and hang it on the rope.

1305
01:37:30,034 --> 01:37:31,558
By morning the clothes will dry up.
- Okay.

1306
01:37:32,103 --> 01:37:34,503
Satyan! Greet mother!
- Oh!

1307
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:41,171
Son, are you going somewhere?

1308
01:37:41,312 --> 01:37:44,372
Bless me, mother.
Brother has got a job for me.

1309
01:37:45,316 --> 01:37:47,181
I will have to work
only 4 hours at night.

1310
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:49,515
And I will get 200 rupees.
200 rupees!

1311
01:37:50,388 --> 01:37:52,185
Is that true, Sukain?
- Yes, mother!

1312
01:37:52,523 --> 01:37:56,391
Brother Satyan! Bansi! Now these
clothes will go in the laundry!

1313
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:59,191
Brother has got a job!
- Where are you going?

1314
01:38:00,131 --> 01:38:02,065
Mother, I will go and inform father!

1315
01:38:03,134 --> 01:38:04,726
There is another good news, mother.
- What, son?

1316
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:08,061
Satyan, give this to mother.

1317
01:38:10,341 --> 01:38:11,399
What is this?

1318
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:15,538
This is my necklace
that was mortgaged.

1319
01:38:16,013 --> 01:38:17,071
Yes, mother.

1320
01:38:17,148 --> 01:38:18,615
Not just the necklace, I have
got all the jewelleries back.

1321
01:38:19,016 --> 01:38:20,074
Here.

1322
01:38:21,018 --> 01:38:22,212
My bangles.

1323
01:38:22,286 --> 01:38:24,550
And this!
- My bangles!

1324
01:38:25,423 --> 01:38:27,220
And this!

1325
01:38:30,027 --> 01:38:31,221
My wedding dot.

1326
01:38:33,631 --> 01:38:35,428
You both are my real jewel.

1327
01:38:36,434 --> 01:38:38,026
But there were other
important work to be done..

1328
01:38:38,102 --> 01:38:39,626
..before getting
these jewelleries back.

1329
01:38:39,704 --> 01:38:41,296
I have finished all
those work, mother.

1330
01:38:43,174 --> 01:38:46,109
Here. 1 000 rupees. For
father's change of place.

1331
01:38:46,444 --> 01:38:48,036
But son, Seth
Fakirchand and Amirchand's..

1332
01:38:48,112 --> 01:38:50,444
..debts are still to be repaid.

1333
01:38:51,449 --> 01:38:52,575
Now why to go for an outing?

1334
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:53,776
Mother, you don't worry.

1335
01:38:54,051 --> 01:38:55,575
I have made
arrangement for them too.

1336
01:38:55,653 --> 01:38:58,053
Listen, Satyan,
tomorrow I will make..

1337
01:38:58,122 --> 01:39:00,056
..arrangement to
send father out of town!

1338
01:39:00,124 --> 01:39:03,457
You go and give 3000
rupees to Seth Amirchand.

1339
01:39:05,329 --> 01:39:07,593
Why? You don't know
Seth Amirchand's shop?

1340
01:39:08,065 --> 01:39:10,397
Yes, yes! I know!

1341
01:39:10,468 --> 01:39:12,595
And look, do take
the receipt from him.

1342
01:39:13,271 --> 01:39:15,398
Mother, you make
arrangements to leave next week.

1343
01:39:15,473 --> 01:39:19,204
Next week? I can't
leave till next month, son.

1344
01:39:19,277 --> 01:39:21,404
Why? Does it take so much
time to pack the luggage?

1345
01:39:22,213 --> 01:39:25,273
No. But marriage does take time.

1346
01:39:25,349 --> 01:39:26,748
Marriage? Whose marriage?

1347
01:39:27,084 --> 01:39:28,142
Satyan's marriage. Mr.
Rajni had come.

1348
01:39:28,219 --> 01:39:31,211
Is that so? So Goddess will
arrive in our house on this Diwali.

1349
01:39:31,355 --> 01:39:34,222
But mother.. all this together..

1350
01:39:35,026 --> 01:39:37,221
I mean how can this
marriage take place?

1351
01:39:37,295 --> 01:39:40,025
Why? You have got a job.
We have repaid the debts.

1352
01:39:40,097 --> 01:39:41,155
Now why can't you get married?

1353
01:39:41,632 --> 01:39:43,361
But who are you to interfere?

1354
01:39:43,434 --> 01:39:45,561
I and mother will
worry about your marriage.

1355
01:39:45,636 --> 01:39:47,570
Why are you worried?
Go and do your work.

1356
01:39:50,508 --> 01:39:54,569
Son, I forgot to ask you. From
where did you get so much money?

1357
01:39:55,179 --> 01:39:56,578
Mother, I have robbed!

1358
01:39:57,114 --> 01:39:58,638
If you don't believe me, ask Satyan!

1359
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:00,449
Fool!

1360
01:40:05,056 --> 01:40:07,047
You are a weird man, Mr. Satyan!

1361
01:40:07,124 --> 01:40:10,525
The girl who saved
your life, you hurt her.

1362
01:40:11,062 --> 01:40:13,997
Mr. Sukain, if Sudha
had not been there..

1363
01:40:14,065 --> 01:40:15,123
..then you would have died.

1364
01:40:15,533 --> 01:40:18,730
I swear. She has saved your life.

1365
01:40:19,337 --> 01:40:22,067
I prefer to die! But l
can't tolerate this!

1366
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:23,466
That somebody betrays me!

1367
01:40:24,141 --> 01:40:25,540
She came to meet me as a poor girl.

1368
01:40:27,078 --> 01:40:29,342
And she played with my poverty!

1369
01:40:30,147 --> 01:40:31,671
You are a strange man!

1370
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:35,075
If she had not done all this..

1371
01:40:35,152 --> 01:40:36,744
..then how would
love have blossomed.

1372
01:40:37,421 --> 01:40:40,754
I am sorry. I
thought you are a kind man.

1373
01:40:41,158 --> 01:40:42,625
But you turned out to be heartless!

1374
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:46,027
And maybe you don't
know who that girl is!

1375
01:40:46,097 --> 01:40:47,223
And I don't even want to know!

1376
01:40:47,298 --> 01:40:48,424
And we don't even want to tell you!

1377
01:40:48,499 --> 01:40:50,023
That she is Mr.
Diwan's daughter, Sudha!

1378
01:40:50,101 --> 01:40:51,159
Sudha?

1379
01:40:51,235 --> 01:40:52,293
I told him!
- lts okay!

1380
01:40:52,637 --> 01:40:53,695
Mr. Diwan's daughter!

1381
01:40:54,038 --> 01:40:55,096
She is waiting downstairs.

1382
01:42:27,398 --> 01:42:34,736
My destiny, you can
take me anywhere you want.

1383
01:42:35,006 --> 01:42:38,737
You can take me anywhere you want.

1384
01:42:39,343 --> 01:42:47,273
My destiny, you can
take me anywhere you want.

1385
01:42:47,618 --> 01:42:51,019
You can take me anywhere you want.

1386
01:43:21,185 --> 01:43:28,591
This lovely dawn has
brought the colours of love.

1387
01:43:29,193 --> 01:43:37,066
Now I have come to
know my first defeat.

1388
01:43:37,535 --> 01:43:40,732
My first defeat.

1389
01:43:41,605 --> 01:43:45,200
I can't say it in front of you.

1390
01:43:45,609 --> 01:43:49,204
I am saying it from a distance.

1391
01:43:49,547 --> 01:43:57,420
Now my heart has made me helpless.

1392
01:43:58,089 --> 01:44:05,427
My destiny, you can
take me anywhere you want.

1393
01:44:05,496 --> 01:44:09,091
You can take me anywhere you want.

1394
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:13,368
You can take me anywhere you want.

1395
01:44:14,105 --> 01:44:17,370
You can take me anywhere you want.

1396
01:44:47,271 --> 01:44:50,729
You are the
destination of my heart.

1397
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:54,541
You are my life partner.

1398
01:44:55,279 --> 01:45:03,209
Only you were missing in my life.

1399
01:45:03,554 --> 01:45:07,012
Only you were missing.

1400
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:11,154
I will dwell in your eyes.

1401
01:45:11,495 --> 01:45:15,226
You will dwell in my heart.

1402
01:45:15,499 --> 01:45:23,372
May the boat of love
float like this forever!

1403
01:45:23,707 --> 01:45:31,045
My destiny, you can
take me anywhere you want.

1404
01:45:31,315 --> 01:45:34,580
You can take me anywhere you want.

1405
01:45:35,519 --> 01:45:43,392
My destiny, you can
take me anywhere you want.

1406
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:47,055
You can take me anywhere you want.

1407
01:46:25,102 --> 01:46:27,502
Anand, how come you
are so early today?

1408
01:46:28,105 --> 01:46:29,163
I mean on time!

1409
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,367
Because today you were
going to come early, sir.

1410
01:46:31,442 --> 01:46:32,500
Who told you?

1411
01:46:33,177 --> 01:46:36,044
Sir, you only said on Saturday
while going to the hospital.

1412
01:46:36,113 --> 01:46:37,375
Oh! You are getting smart!

1413
01:46:38,382 --> 01:46:40,976
Look, keep a stamp
receipt of 10,000 rupees ready.

1414
01:46:41,518 --> 01:46:45,511
And.. you have come! Come. Hurry up!

1415
01:46:46,323 --> 01:46:47,381
Come inside.

1416
01:46:48,392 --> 01:46:49,654
How is Mr. Shivraj?

1417
01:46:50,327 --> 01:46:51,988
Doctor said that he
will have to rest..

1418
01:46:52,062 --> 01:46:53,723
..in the hospital
for a few more days.

1419
01:46:53,998 --> 01:46:55,192
He will have to stay in the
hospital for a few more days?

1420
01:46:55,266 --> 01:46:56,324
Yes.

1421
01:46:57,401 --> 01:46:59,392
Oh! It was a terrible accident!

1422
01:47:03,207 --> 01:47:04,731
Thank God! He survived!

1423
01:47:06,477 --> 01:47:09,002
Anand! Have you decided to reform?

1424
01:47:10,347 --> 01:47:12,679
No wonder! Another
Taj might be build.

1425
01:47:13,951 --> 01:47:16,545
My Taj Mahal will be
built after grandpa's death.

1426
01:47:17,554 --> 01:47:19,351
Why are you hell bend after him?

1427
01:47:22,493 --> 01:47:23,960
Has Mr. Verma come?

1428
01:47:24,028 --> 01:47:30,558
Yes. He has come. Partner, today
I will give you smuggled cigarette.

1429
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:33,961
From where did you get
American cigarettes?

1430
01:47:34,305 --> 01:47:36,034
I am a decent man.

1431
01:47:36,307 --> 01:47:38,502
I was ashamed to take
cigarette from you everyday.

1432
01:47:39,043 --> 01:47:41,978
I thought I will
repay the debt today.

1433
01:47:42,046 --> 01:47:43,104
Anand!

1434
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:45,377
If Satyan has come then send him in.

1435
01:47:46,183 --> 01:47:49,175
Go. He needs you and he calls me.

1436
01:47:49,987 --> 01:47:52,581
20 times in a day he checks
whether I am at my table or not.

1437
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:55,517
Will somebody listen to me?

1438
01:47:57,061 --> 01:48:00,258
Jesus Christ! I want to
get rid of this old man!

1439
01:48:01,332 --> 01:48:04,733
There is only one way.
Let my grandpa die.

1440
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:08,061
Mr. Anand, what is this?

1441
01:48:08,138 --> 01:48:09,605
You are praying to Christ?

1442
01:48:09,673 --> 01:48:11,402
Shut up! No joke!

1443
01:48:12,543 --> 01:48:14,738
I have become very
serious about religion.

1444
01:48:15,412 --> 01:48:18,540
I prayed to Ram
and Rahim! No answer.

1445
01:48:19,016 --> 01:48:22,008
If my this prayer leads
to my grandpa's death..

1446
01:48:22,086 --> 01:48:25,021
..then I swear on
my future children..

1447
01:48:25,089 --> 01:48:29,219
..next year my name will be
Albert D'Souza, not Anand.

1448
01:48:30,227 --> 01:48:34,163
All right. Not today.
Yes. Thank you.

1449
01:48:36,233 --> 01:48:37,291
Good morning, sir.

1450
01:48:37,368 --> 01:48:39,359
Good morning,
Satyan. He is Maganlal.

1451
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:41,228
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1452
01:48:41,305 --> 01:48:42,431
Give him 10,000 rupees.

1453
01:48:51,382 --> 01:48:52,440
What are you searching for?

1454
01:48:52,516 --> 01:48:53,574
Sir, I can't find the money!

1455
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:55,311
You can't find the money!
What do you mean?

1456
01:48:56,053 --> 01:48:57,111
Where had you kept it?

1457
01:48:57,187 --> 01:48:59,121
I had kept it here. I
remember it quite well.

1458
01:48:59,189 --> 01:49:00,656
Let me see! Very strange!

1459
01:49:03,594 --> 01:49:05,459
The lock is fine. There
are only two set of keys.

1460
01:49:05,529 --> 01:49:06,996
One is with you,
the other is with me.

1461
01:49:07,064 --> 01:49:08,122
If any outsider had
stolen the money..

1462
01:49:08,198 --> 01:49:09,722
..he would have to break the lock.

1463
01:49:10,401 --> 01:49:13,393
Anand! Nariman! Come inside!

1464
01:49:24,148 --> 01:49:27,083
On Saturday Satyan had kept
10,000 rupees in the cupboard.

1465
01:49:27,551 --> 01:49:30,418
And today it has disappeared.
Where can it go?

1466
01:49:32,423 --> 01:49:34,550
I have called you
both for an answer!

1467
01:49:35,225 --> 01:49:37,216
Sir, Saturday was my off.

1468
01:49:39,029 --> 01:49:40,621
You may leave!
- Okay, sir.

1469
01:49:42,032 --> 01:49:45,229
Anand! How can the money
vanish from the locked cupboard?

1470
01:49:46,437 --> 01:49:49,031
How can the money vanish
from the locked cupboard?

1471
01:49:49,106 --> 01:49:50,630
How can I tell you that, sir?

1472
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:53,434
I mean.. I was not here.

1473
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:55,102
What do you mean? You were present!

1474
01:49:55,446 --> 01:49:59,246
I mean.. I.. I left with you, sir.

1475
01:49:59,583 --> 01:50:02,450
Do you remember? You
gave me a lift in the car.

1476
01:50:05,255 --> 01:50:06,244
Fine! You may leave!

1477
01:50:07,324 --> 01:50:08,382
Thank you.

1478
01:50:13,997 --> 01:50:15,055
Very strange!

1479
01:50:19,536 --> 01:50:22,061
In front of me, you kept
the money and then lock it.

1480
01:50:26,343 --> 01:50:28,402
And you are saying
the money has vanished.

1481
01:50:30,347 --> 01:50:31,609
Where can the money go?

1482
01:50:32,149 --> 01:50:33,548
I don't understand anything,
Mr. Verma!

1483
01:50:35,152 --> 01:50:39,418
When I gave you money on Saturday..
it was past office hours.

1484
01:50:41,358 --> 01:50:45,624
Anand was with me.
I.. I can't doubt him.

1485
01:50:47,097 --> 01:50:51,033
I trust you. Then
who was that person?

1486
01:50:53,504 --> 01:50:55,096
Who can take the money?

1487
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:59,437
Satyan.. had your brother
Sukain come in this room?

1488
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:03,241
Brother! No, Mr. Verma! He
had not come in this room!

1489
01:51:03,647 --> 01:51:05,114
So should I think you
have taken the money?

1490
01:51:05,449 --> 01:51:08,384
Trust me, Mr. Verma.
Don't belittle me!

1491
01:51:08,452 --> 01:51:12,183
I trust you. But
somebody has stolen the money.

1492
01:51:12,990 --> 01:51:14,582
If you doubt anybody then tell me.

1493
01:51:16,994 --> 01:51:18,052
Anand?
- No.

1494
01:51:18,128 --> 01:51:19,595
Then Sukain?

1495
01:51:19,997 --> 01:51:22,397
No, Mr. Verma! I trust my brother!

1496
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,524
Then the police only
will nab the thief!

1497
01:51:25,002 --> 01:51:27,402
Mr. Verma, please listen to me!

1498
01:51:28,071 --> 01:51:31,131
I beg you. Please don't
call the police. - Why?

1499
01:51:31,542 --> 01:51:32,736
You gave me the money.

1500
01:51:33,143 --> 01:51:34,542
So it's my
responsibility to return it to you.

1501
01:51:35,145 --> 01:51:36,407
I will repay the money anyhow!

1502
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,210
What nonsense! It's not your fault!

1503
01:51:40,017 --> 01:51:41,075
You don't understand.

1504
01:51:41,151 --> 01:51:43,415
The problem won't get solved
by getting the money back.

1505
01:51:44,021 --> 01:51:46,421
I want to nab the person who has
committed robbery in my office!

1506
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:49,558
Listen! Please! Don't do this!

1507
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,422
You are behaving so strangely!

1508
01:51:52,095 --> 01:51:55,087
I think you know who the
culprit is! Why don't you tell me?

1509
01:51:55,165 --> 01:51:57,099
I don't know!
Believe me! I don't know!

1510
01:51:57,167 --> 01:51:59,101
Then why don't you let
me inform the police?

1511
01:51:59,169 --> 01:52:02,104
Before informing the police, l
want to investigate the matter.

1512
01:52:02,172 --> 01:52:04,436
Don't talk like a child!
- Please, Mr. Verma!

1513
01:52:04,508 --> 01:52:05,566
Just give me one day.

1514
01:52:05,642 --> 01:52:09,043
All right. But what you
are doing, that is not right.

1515
01:52:31,535 --> 01:52:32,593
Count it!

1516
01:52:33,136 --> 01:52:35,070
I counted it while
you were counting.

1517
01:52:36,006 --> 01:52:37,530
Strange! You are so smart!

1518
01:52:37,608 --> 01:52:42,204
I have to be smart.
Now I will leave. - Okay.

1519
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:43,337
Will meet you again.

1520
01:52:44,348 --> 01:52:46,339
But now how will we meet?
- Why?

1521
01:52:46,416 --> 01:52:49,214
You have stopped all
the ways of meeting.

1522
01:52:49,286 --> 01:52:50,617
You have repaid all the debts!

1523
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:53,615
Now under what
pretext will I meet you?

1524
01:52:54,024 --> 01:52:55,423
Someday call me home for tea.

1525
01:52:55,492 --> 01:52:58,427
No, no. It will be expensive.
We will meet on the route.

1526
01:52:58,495 --> 01:53:01,225
Okay. Bye. Greetings. Greetings.

1527
01:53:08,372 --> 01:53:10,169
These moneylenders are so
accurate in money matters.

1528
01:53:19,316 --> 01:53:22,376
Satyan.. are you fine?
- Yes.

1529
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:25,384
Yes? But you look sick.

1530
01:53:27,457 --> 01:53:28,515
Brother!

1531
01:53:30,127 --> 01:53:32,186
What's the matter?
Why don't you tell me?

1532
01:53:34,064 --> 01:53:35,588
1 0,000 rupees has been
stolen from our office.

1533
01:53:35,999 --> 01:53:39,526
1 0,000 rupees! But
why are you so worried?

1534
01:53:40,003 --> 01:53:41,061
It's none of your business.

1535
01:53:41,138 --> 01:53:43,265
That day only I and
Anand were at the office.

1536
01:53:43,607 --> 01:53:46,075
Oh! So Mr. Verma doubts both of you?

1537
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:49,072
He doesn't doubt Anand.
- He doubts you?

1538
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,208
He thinks my
acquaintance has stolen the money.

1539
01:53:54,284 --> 01:53:56,411
And I have asked for a day
to investigate the matter.

1540
01:53:56,486 --> 01:53:58,078
Do you doubt somebody?

1541
01:54:00,223 --> 01:54:01,281
Why are you quiet?

1542
01:54:02,025 --> 01:54:04,425
Brother, Mr. Verma tried
twice to call the police.

1543
01:54:04,628 --> 01:54:07,563
I stopped him. I didn't
let him inform the police!

1544
01:54:07,964 --> 01:54:09,363
You are an idiot! A fool!

1545
01:54:09,433 --> 01:54:12,425
What have you done!
Why did you stop him?

1546
01:54:12,502 --> 01:54:13,560
Brother, I didn't want..

1547
01:54:14,104 --> 01:54:15,162
I don't understand!

1548
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:17,172
Are you a detective
or a police inspector?

1549
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:18,707
That you yourself want to
investigate this matter!

1550
01:54:18,975 --> 01:54:20,033
I was sure.

1551
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:23,172
I thought seeing my condition the
thief will surely return the money.

1552
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:27,111
Thief will return the money.
Which fool has told you that?

1553
01:54:27,384 --> 01:54:28,976
If he had any sympathy with you..

1554
01:54:29,052 --> 01:54:30,178
..why he would have
committed robbery?

1555
01:54:30,387 --> 01:54:36,189
No matter what. I thought so.
I trusted him. But now..

1556
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:39,051
Where are you going? Wait!

1557
01:54:39,329 --> 01:54:41,058
Leave me! I say leave me!

1558
01:54:41,331 --> 01:54:42,525
I am an idiot, a fool!

1559
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:44,992
But if you don't
want to understand..

1560
01:54:45,068 --> 01:54:47,059
..why I did this,
then what can I do?

1561
01:54:48,071 --> 01:54:51,336
Satyan! Satyan, listen! Satyan!

1562
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:02,414
Thief? Brother is a thief?

1563
01:55:03,553 --> 01:55:05,612
No! I can't even think of this!

1564
01:55:06,022 --> 01:55:07,080
You can't think!

1565
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:10,157
But a person earning 250
rupees repays a loan of 6000 rupees!

1566
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:12,157
He can send father
to a hill station!

1567
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:13,355
He can bring back
mother's jewellery!

1568
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:15,159
He meets the household expenses!

1569
01:55:15,232 --> 01:55:16,290
All this in 250 rupees!

1570
01:55:19,503 --> 01:55:22,165
You don't know what a
person can do for money.

1571
01:55:22,372 --> 01:55:25,034
Brother Satyan, don't
say this to anybody.

1572
01:55:25,108 --> 01:55:26,370
What do you think? I want to say it?

1573
01:55:27,377 --> 01:55:30,039
I don't want to say
anything to anybody.

1574
01:55:30,313 --> 01:55:31,974
But shouldn't I do
something to save myself..

1575
01:55:32,048 --> 01:55:33,379
..from this false accusation?

1576
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:34,974
Will you ruin the
family to save yourself..

1577
01:55:35,051 --> 01:55:37,178
..from this false accusation?

1578
01:55:37,387 --> 01:55:40,185
Just think. Brother has to
carry the burden of this house.

1579
01:55:40,257 --> 01:55:42,054
And what was his
plight because of that!

1580
01:55:42,325 --> 01:55:45,192
He wears torn vest and broken shoes.

1581
01:55:45,996 --> 01:55:47,588
But he doesn't let
us face any problem.

1582
01:55:48,198 --> 01:55:49,995
Can such a man be a thief?

1583
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:54,269
A thief enjoys his life. He
doesn't live like a poor man.

1584
01:55:55,272 --> 01:55:56,330
Then am I a thief?

1585
01:56:00,343 --> 01:56:02,072
I can't even think of that!

1586
01:56:02,412 --> 01:56:05,609
But what you are thinking..
its your mistake.

1587
01:56:06,283 --> 01:56:10,947
And if you accused brother in
front of others or our parents..

1588
01:56:11,021 --> 01:56:16,482
..then remember, the image of
this family will be tarnished.

1589
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:24,358
Brother! Police!

1590
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:34,036
The police have come in our house!

1591
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:35,702
Police? Where?
- Downstairs!

1592
01:56:36,379 --> 01:56:38,973
Listen! Don't make a noise.
Understand?

1593
01:56:47,390 --> 01:56:48,584
Brother, now what?

1594
01:56:49,125 --> 01:56:51,184
Slowly, Sujata. Father
should not come to know.

1595
01:56:55,398 --> 01:56:57,389
Father! Father!
The police have come!

1596
01:56:57,467 --> 01:56:59,196
Police! Where?

1597
01:57:03,406 --> 01:57:05,533
Sukain! Satyan!

1598
01:57:06,276 --> 01:57:09,336
I understand. Father is not well.

1599
01:57:09,946 --> 01:57:11,470
If he will see you,
he will get tense.

1600
01:57:11,948 --> 01:57:14,678
Please wait outside. I
will just call Satyan.

1601
01:57:19,356 --> 01:57:24,020
Satyan! Sujata!

1602
01:57:25,095 --> 01:57:26,153
Where are the police?

1603
01:57:26,363 --> 01:57:27,489
What is this? Where are you going?

1604
01:57:27,564 --> 01:57:30,032
What are the police
doing in my house? - That..

1605
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:32,034
No, no! You don't
understand anything!

1606
01:57:32,102 --> 01:57:33,160
Something has surely happened!

1607
01:57:34,304 --> 01:57:36,169
Where is Sukain? I am
sure something has happened!

1608
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:37,501
Something has surely happened!

1609
01:57:38,041 --> 01:57:39,508
Somebody has surely
done some blunder!

1610
01:57:39,576 --> 01:57:40,702
Otherwise why would the
police come in my house?

1611
01:57:41,378 --> 01:57:43,573
You all are hiding
something from me! I am sure!

1612
01:57:45,515 --> 01:57:50,179
Sukain! Sukain! What's the matter?

1613
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:54,721
Why have the
police come in my house?

1614
01:57:57,527 --> 01:58:00,587
An accident had
occurred near Satyan's office.

1615
01:58:01,197 --> 01:58:03,062
The police have come
to make the inquiries.

1616
01:58:03,333 --> 01:58:05,198
Oh! So this is the matter.

1617
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,998
I was wondering that my
son can't do anything..

1618
01:58:09,072 --> 01:58:11,006
..that will bring
the police to my house.

1619
01:58:23,153 --> 01:58:26,020
Satyan! I tell you this
old man is so cunning!

1620
01:58:26,089 --> 01:58:28,023
For a trivial matter
he called the police..

1621
01:58:28,091 --> 01:58:30,025
..and thus has made
the matter so serious.

1622
01:58:30,093 --> 01:58:33,085
You might have taken
the money for your loan.

1623
01:58:33,163 --> 01:58:34,221
What do you mean by that?

1624
01:58:34,297 --> 01:58:36,629
I am not talking about you.
I am talking about the thief!

1625
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:40,035
Even if somebody
has taken the money..

1626
01:58:40,103 --> 01:58:41,161
..now he can't return it.

1627
01:58:41,237 --> 01:58:42,295
I don't know!

1628
01:58:43,173 --> 01:58:45,107
Satyan, why do you get angry?

1629
01:58:45,175 --> 01:58:47,109
You are my friend. Just see.

1630
01:58:47,177 --> 01:58:49,042
Someday I will teach such
a lesson to this old man..

1631
01:58:49,112 --> 01:58:50,170
..that even you will remember!

1632
01:58:50,447 --> 01:58:53,439
I see! Maybe that's why you
have reported to the police.

1633
01:58:53,516 --> 01:58:56,110
I did that to prove our innocence.

1634
01:58:56,186 --> 01:58:58,051
I thought what the old man
is going to do tomorrow..

1635
01:58:58,121 --> 01:58:59,782
..I will do that today.

1636
01:59:00,056 --> 01:59:01,114
Keep quiet!

1637
01:59:01,191 --> 01:59:02,249
Excuse me.

1638
01:59:03,193 --> 01:59:05,593
I have not asked for justification.
Liar!

1639
01:59:05,795 --> 01:59:08,389
Satyan! Satyan, you
are misunderstanding me!

1640
01:59:08,465 --> 01:59:12,128
Just see. I will harass this
old man in the court! Satyan!

1641
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:21,738
Culprit Satyanath, you
have been accused of robbery.

1642
01:59:22,078 --> 01:59:24,137
Do you accept the crime?

1643
01:59:32,422 --> 01:59:35,084
Your honour, I am innocent.

1644
01:59:36,226 --> 01:59:38,421
I didn't steal the money.
I have never robbed.

1645
01:59:38,495 --> 01:59:42,431
Mr. Nariman, how long
have you known Satyanath?

1646
01:59:43,033 --> 01:59:44,091
Since past 3 years, sir.

1647
01:59:44,367 --> 01:59:46,028
A few days before this robbery..

1648
01:59:46,102 --> 01:59:48,229
..the culprit had given up the
hope of becoming an attorney.

1649
01:59:48,638 --> 01:59:50,230
Do you know the reason for that?

1650
01:59:50,306 --> 01:59:52,035
Yes, sir. After
losing the property..

1651
01:59:52,108 --> 01:59:55,236
..his family's financial
condition was not good.

1652
01:59:56,246 --> 02:00:00,239
Could culprit pay his
fees with the stolen amount?

1653
02:00:01,051 --> 02:00:02,177
Yes, sir.

1654
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,578
Thank you, Mr. Nariman!

1655
02:00:04,654 --> 02:00:06,315
Your honour, no further questions.

1656
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:10,325
Your name?
- Amirchand.

1657
02:00:10,527 --> 02:00:13,121
My father's name was Daulatchand.

1658
02:00:13,196 --> 02:00:16,393
We belong to King
Harishchandra's race.

1659
02:00:17,133 --> 02:00:19,067
Giving alms is our duty.

1660
02:00:19,335 --> 02:00:23,135
And in our family it's a sin to lie.

1661
02:00:23,206 --> 02:00:26,198
You have not been called here
to describe your family history!

1662
02:00:26,409 --> 02:00:32,006
Sir, you get angry very soon.
I consider you as a dear one.

1663
02:00:32,215 --> 02:00:36,083
Otherwise nobody
shares family matters.

1664
02:00:36,152 --> 02:00:39,212
Mr. Amirchand! Just answer
my questions! Understand!

1665
02:00:40,023 --> 02:00:42,082
Did Satyan give you the money?

1666
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:46,686
Sir, if he will scold like this
then I will forget everything.

1667
02:00:48,364 --> 02:00:53,358
The truth is that
Satyan gave me 3000 rupees.

1668
02:00:53,436 --> 02:00:58,237
And sir, I know that
Sukain had sent the money.

1669
02:00:58,308 --> 02:01:01,436
Your honour, please note this point!

1670
02:01:02,245 --> 02:01:06,511
Mr. Amirchand says that Mr.
Sukain had sent the money.

1671
02:01:06,583 --> 02:01:08,050
Mr. Amirchand!
- Yes.

1672
02:01:08,384 --> 02:01:10,181
When did you receive
the money from Satyan?

1673
02:01:10,253 --> 02:01:11,379
Maybe on Sunday.

1674
02:01:11,454 --> 02:01:12,512
Sunday?
- Yes.

1675
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:14,648
Your honour, please note!

1676
02:01:14,991 --> 02:01:18,392
On Sunday the money was
given to Mr. Amirchand!

1677
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:21,726
And the money was stolen one
day prior that is on Saturday.

1678
02:01:22,065 --> 02:01:23,396
That's all! No more question!

1679
02:01:23,666 --> 02:01:26,396
When did you receive
the money from Sukain?

1680
02:01:27,403 --> 02:01:28,665
On monday.

1681
02:01:29,005 --> 02:01:33,408
On monday. Was anybody else
present at Mr. Sukain's office?

1682
02:01:33,476 --> 02:01:36,536
Yes, sir! He was there!

1683
02:01:37,547 --> 02:01:39,606
Your honour, please note this point!

1684
02:01:40,016 --> 02:01:41,608
The culprit was
present at that time.

1685
02:01:42,418 --> 02:01:44,283
What was the culprit's condition?

1686
02:01:44,354 --> 02:01:46,413
I didn't observe closely, sir.

1687
02:01:47,023 --> 02:01:51,016
Because my father always
said that when you are..

1688
02:01:51,094 --> 02:01:54,427
..carrying money, then
keep a watch only on money.

1689
02:01:54,497 --> 02:01:56,556
Don't look here and there.

1690
02:01:57,033 --> 02:01:59,763
You tend to forget everything.
How did you remember this?

1691
02:02:00,036 --> 02:02:02,095
After all it's about money, sir.

1692
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:06,033
No matter what you say, Mr. Verma..

1693
02:02:09,512 --> 02:02:10,979
I don't know what will
be my daughter's plight..

1694
02:02:11,047 --> 02:02:13,242
..after hearing this news.

1695
02:02:13,383 --> 02:02:15,715
Brother Satyan, don't
go in front of father.

1696
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:17,377
How did he find out?

1697
02:02:17,453 --> 02:02:18,511
Kalpana's father had come.

1698
02:02:18,988 --> 02:02:20,387
He has broken off the engagement.

1699
02:02:30,333 --> 02:02:31,391
That's very bad!

1700
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:50,547
Father, don't get disheartened.

1701
02:02:53,489 --> 02:02:59,428
Son, never have l
bowed down my head.

1702
02:03:01,231 --> 02:03:03,290
Satyan has humiliated me.

1703
02:03:05,368 --> 02:03:07,165
Now how will I face anybody?

1704
02:03:08,371 --> 02:03:12,364
Father, why are you sad?
Satyan has not done anything.

1705
02:03:13,509 --> 02:03:16,501
It's a false accusation.

1706
02:03:40,336 --> 02:03:42,531
Mother! Mother!

1707
02:03:47,076 --> 02:03:50,068
Why did you live for this day?
Why didn't you die?

1708
02:03:50,146 --> 02:03:51,204
Mother!

1709
02:03:51,281 --> 02:03:52,407
Don't call me mother!

1710
02:03:53,349 --> 02:03:56,546
I gave birth to you.
I have nurtured you.

1711
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:59,411
But I apologise to God for this.

1712
02:03:59,489 --> 02:04:01,081
Mother, what do I tell you?

1713
02:04:01,157 --> 02:04:02,215
Now what will you say?

1714
02:04:02,558 --> 02:04:05,026
What will you say after
tarnishing the family's image..

1715
02:04:05,094 --> 02:04:06,152
..and mother's honour!

1716
02:04:06,296 --> 02:04:07,354
Mother!

1717
02:04:11,301 --> 02:04:13,360
Your honour.. I very well know.

1718
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:18,031
A honest and sincere man
like Satyan can't do this.

1719
02:04:18,374 --> 02:04:21,707
Your honour, its
impossible for him to steal.

1720
02:04:22,578 --> 02:04:25,308
And if the money has been stolen..

1721
02:04:25,381 --> 02:04:26,643
Your honour, I object!

1722
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:28,176
What rubbish are you talking!

1723
02:04:28,251 --> 02:04:32,187
The money has been stolen..
do you doubt it?

1724
02:04:33,589 --> 02:04:36,057
Yes! This is what I mean to say!

1725
02:04:36,125 --> 02:04:37,990
You mean to say that
attorney Verma's case..

1726
02:04:38,061 --> 02:04:39,528
..of stolen 1 0,000 rupees is false?

1727
02:04:40,129 --> 02:04:43,121
I had written the report, not he.

1728
02:04:43,199 --> 02:04:46,396
You, I mean the police had
prepared the charge sheet.

1729
02:04:46,469 --> 02:04:49,529
Your honour, a
mistake has been committed.

1730
02:04:49,605 --> 02:04:51,596
Have you come here to talk rubbish?

1731
02:04:52,342 --> 02:04:56,142
Your honour, I object!

1732
02:04:56,212 --> 02:04:59,010
He thinks by making
the case complicated..

1733
02:04:59,082 --> 02:05:03,143
..he will prove his
client's innocence.

1734
02:05:03,553 --> 02:05:06,021
If your witness wants to
speak the truth in the court..

1735
02:05:11,294 --> 02:05:15,230
The point is simple
and absolutely relevant.

1736
02:05:15,298 --> 02:05:17,960
No! It's not relevant!
He is a hostile witness!

1737
02:05:18,034 --> 02:05:19,092
Your honour!

1738
02:05:19,502 --> 02:05:20,560
You say what you want to say.

1739
02:05:20,636 --> 02:05:21,694
Thank you, Your honour!

1740
02:05:21,971 --> 02:05:24,963
I was saying, the day
the robbery was committed..

1741
02:05:25,041 --> 02:05:27,976
..I mean when everybody
thinks that the money was stolen..

1742
02:05:28,044 --> 02:05:32,174
..at that time there was a
terrible accident near our office.

1743
02:05:33,116 --> 02:05:39,180
Our office's client Mr. Shivdas was
badly injured in front of Mr. Verma.

1744
02:05:39,389 --> 02:05:42,984
In this panic, Mr. Verma
gave the money to Satyan..

1745
02:05:43,059 --> 02:05:45,994
..or he kept it in his pocket.

1746
02:05:46,062 --> 02:05:50,999
Your honour, its
possible that in that crowd..

1747
02:05:51,067 --> 02:05:54,002
..somebody mugged Mr.
Verma's pocket.

1748
02:05:55,338 --> 02:05:57,067
Your honour, I object!

1749
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:58,198
Let him continue!

1750
02:05:58,408 --> 02:06:02,003
If Satyan took the money,
whether he kept it in the safe..

1751
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:08,017
..or not or whether he kept it
on the table.. he can forget that.

1752
02:06:08,351 --> 02:06:10,945
Your honour, because at that
time we all ran downstairs..

1753
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:13,352
..to save Mr. Shivdas's life.

1754
02:06:13,956 --> 02:06:16,948
Your honour, I request
you to take the decision..

1755
02:06:17,026 --> 02:06:21,360
..after keeping in mind
that day's circumstances.

1756
02:06:22,298 --> 02:06:23,356
Thank you!

1757
02:06:25,968 --> 02:06:30,496
Mr. Verma, the culprit has
worked with you for long.

1758
02:06:30,973 --> 02:06:32,497
You know him well.

1759
02:06:33,309 --> 02:06:36,039
So it's obvious that you
will be kind on the culprit.

1760
02:06:36,579 --> 02:06:38,979
I want to remind you once more..

1761
02:06:39,048 --> 02:06:43,041
..that you have taken the
oath to speak the truth!

1762
02:06:43,386 --> 02:06:48,050
I hope that a person like
you will honour the oath.

1763
02:06:49,992 --> 02:06:51,983
I say it again that my good friend..

1764
02:06:52,061 --> 02:06:55,258
..Shivdas's accident
had disturbed me a lot.

1765
02:06:56,199 --> 02:06:58,531
So at that time I didn't
remember about the money.

1766
02:06:59,202 --> 02:07:00,999
Do you want to say that you easily..

1767
02:07:01,070 --> 02:07:03,061
..forgot such a huge sum of money?

1768
02:07:03,539 --> 02:07:06,007
If you had been in
my place then maybe..

1769
02:07:09,412 --> 02:07:15,351
After taking into consideration
the witnesses and the testimonies..

1770
02:07:16,285 --> 02:07:19,345
..I acquit Satyanath.

1771
02:07:25,361 --> 02:07:29,957
And the police had
accused a decent man..

1772
02:07:30,032 --> 02:07:33,490
..of robbery without
having sufficient evidence.

1773
02:07:34,103 --> 02:07:36,162
I express my disapproval on this.

1774
02:07:40,376 --> 02:07:42,503
Satyan is Mr. Verma's old employee.

1775
02:07:42,578 --> 02:07:44,705
So he took mercy on
him and saved him.

1776
02:07:48,584 --> 02:07:52,315
Satyan! Satyan! I told
you that I am your friend!

1777
02:07:52,388 --> 02:07:55,380
I will be a true friend!
Anand can't be disloyal!

1778
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:59,387
Mr. Verma! Greetings!
- Greetings!

1779
02:08:00,129 --> 02:08:01,596
Satyan.. greet him!

1780
02:08:03,332 --> 02:08:07,530
You saved an innocent man.
For that thanks.

1781
02:08:08,337 --> 02:08:10,066
I don't deserve any thanks.

1782
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:12,739
Satyan, meet me at the office.

1783
02:08:15,211 --> 02:08:18,078
Sujata, go and give
this good news to father.

1784
02:08:18,548 --> 02:08:20,607
I have some work. I will come later.

1785
02:08:27,156 --> 02:08:29,215
Not Satyan, Sukain is the thief.
- Liar!

1786
02:08:29,358 --> 02:08:33,419
On the day of robbery Sukain was
present at Mr. Verma's office.

1787
02:08:34,163 --> 02:08:35,562
And this was not
revealed in the court!

1788
02:08:36,032 --> 02:08:39,092
You are lying! I will just
call Mr. Sukain and find out!

1789
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:40,362
Everything will
become crystal clear!

1790
02:08:40,436 --> 02:08:42,097
The decision has been taken!

1791
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:47,034
I know who used to
smuggle liquor in my trust..

1792
02:08:47,109 --> 02:08:49,043
..who made artificial medicine..

1793
02:08:49,111 --> 02:08:52,444
..and who adulterated cement.

1794
02:08:53,449 --> 02:08:56,043
I want to know that
National cement company..

1795
02:08:56,118 --> 02:09:01,055
..scientific drug company..
Indian import and export company..

1796
02:09:01,591 --> 02:09:04,059
..on these companies the
police have filed a case of fraud.

1797
02:09:04,126 --> 02:09:05,650
When were these companies formed..

1798
02:09:05,728 --> 02:09:08,060
..and when did l
sign on the documents?

1799
02:09:09,332 --> 02:09:11,197
You sign and then forget, Mr. Diwan.

1800
02:09:11,534 --> 02:09:15,197
Cheater! Disloyal!
Get out of my house!

1801
02:09:15,271 --> 02:09:16,329
Just a moment!

1802
02:09:17,406 --> 02:09:20,534
I have all the documents
and all the signed papers.

1803
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:23,545
Now only one option is left for you.

1804
02:09:24,413 --> 02:09:27,211
Get your daughter
married to me immediately!

1805
02:09:29,352 --> 02:09:30,410
I am going now.

1806
02:09:32,221 --> 02:09:38,421
One more thing. If you ever
need my help then do call me.

1807
02:09:39,495 --> 02:09:40,553
Bye!

1808
02:09:47,169 --> 02:09:49,228
Right from the beginning l
have been making a mistake.

1809
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:55,176
Now how will I face Amarnath, dear?

1810
02:09:55,444 --> 02:09:57,571
Father, don't lose hope.

1811
02:10:13,262 --> 02:10:15,059
What happened? What has
the court decided, dear?

1812
02:10:15,398 --> 02:10:17,389
Was Satyan proved innocent?

1813
02:10:17,466 --> 02:10:20,196
The court has
acquitted brother, mother.

1814
02:10:20,403 --> 02:10:24,134
But.. everybody says that Mr.
Verma took pity on our family.

1815
02:10:24,206 --> 02:10:28,404
No, no! It's all rubbish! I
don't want anybody's mercy!

1816
02:10:28,544 --> 02:10:31,411
My family doesn't need
anybody's mercy! No!

1817
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:44,417
Did you call me?

1818
02:10:45,428 --> 02:10:48,625
Satyan, I have got you freed.

1819
02:10:49,365 --> 02:10:52,027
I hope you will atone for your sin.

1820
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:53,762
Do you really think
that I am a thief!

1821
02:10:54,236 --> 02:10:56,568
I have told you
that I don't think so.

1822
02:10:57,239 --> 02:11:00,037
But the person who keeps
quiet to save the thief..

1823
02:11:00,109 --> 02:11:03,567
..his crime is also not any
less than a thief's crime.

1824
02:11:04,046 --> 02:11:05,104
But Mr. Verma, l..

1825
02:11:05,381 --> 02:11:09,374
I trusted you the most. Now l
don't trust you like before.

1826
02:11:09,452 --> 02:11:11,977
I can't let you work in
my office. You may leave!

1827
02:11:22,198 --> 02:11:23,392
Satyan!
- Leave me!

1828
02:11:26,402 --> 02:11:29,530
Mr. Verma! How many times I told
you that Satyan is not a thief!

1829
02:11:29,605 --> 02:11:30,731
But you don't understand!

1830
02:11:31,006 --> 02:11:33,065
I give you a last chance!

1831
02:11:33,142 --> 02:11:35,076
Call him back
otherwise I too will leave!

1832
02:11:35,144 --> 02:11:37,203
All right! Get out!
- Fine!

1833
02:11:54,363 --> 02:11:57,025
Kalpana! Kalpana!

1834
02:12:02,505 --> 02:12:03,563
Greetings.

1835
02:12:05,307 --> 02:12:06,365
Now why have you come here?

1836
02:12:08,043 --> 02:12:10,034
I have come to meet Kalpana!
- You can't meet her!

1837
02:12:11,447 --> 02:12:12,505
Why?

1838
02:12:13,382 --> 02:12:14,974
My daughter has no relation with..

1839
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:18,508
..the man who has
been accused of robbery.

1840
02:12:18,988 --> 02:12:21,047
I have said this to your father too.

1841
02:12:22,391 --> 02:12:25,383
But maybe you don't know
that the court has acquitted me.

1842
02:12:25,461 --> 02:12:27,053
That was because
of Mr. Verma's pity.

1843
02:12:27,129 --> 02:12:29,063
For the society,
you are still guilty.

1844
02:12:29,398 --> 02:12:31,195
If this is the case, then your
daughter too is the culprit!

1845
02:12:31,267 --> 02:12:32,325
No!

1846
02:12:32,401 --> 02:12:33,993
That day when I gave your daughter..

1847
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:36,003
..the chance to think
again you only had said..

1848
02:12:36,071 --> 02:12:38,005
..that a girl's heart can't be sold.

1849
02:12:38,073 --> 02:12:39,404
She loves only once.

1850
02:12:39,475 --> 02:12:40,533
I have changed my mind.

1851
02:12:40,609 --> 02:12:43,203
Where there is no faith,
there can't be any love.

1852
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:44,337
This is what you think!

1853
02:12:44,547 --> 02:12:47,015
But maybe your daughter
still has faith in me.

1854
02:12:47,082 --> 02:12:48,140
Kalpana is my daughter.

1855
02:12:48,217 --> 02:12:50,208
And I know my
daughter better than you.

1856
02:12:50,352 --> 02:12:52,411
She will never
form tie with a thief.

1857
02:12:53,355 --> 02:12:55,220
Your daughter is here. Now ask her!

1858
02:12:55,291 --> 02:12:56,622
Does she respect me or not!

1859
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:00,760
What you want to ask her,
hear that from me!

1860
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:05,366
The Satyan whom Kalpana
loved that Satyan has died.

1861
02:13:05,434 --> 02:13:07,561
My daughter hates a thief like you!

1862
02:13:08,504 --> 02:13:10,165
She hates me?
- Yes!

1863
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:11,297
No, father!

1864
02:13:11,507 --> 02:13:14,169
Kalpana, you tell me. Am I a thief?

1865
02:13:14,376 --> 02:13:17,504
You are a thief. People
consider you as a thief.

1866
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:19,571
People consider me as a thief.
What do you think of me?

1867
02:13:20,115 --> 02:13:21,173
Am I a thief?

1868
02:13:22,318 --> 02:13:25,185
Kalpana, I have not
committed robbery. I am not a thief.

1869
02:13:25,254 --> 02:13:26,312
Satyan!

1870
02:14:16,372 --> 02:14:17,430
Mother!

1871
02:14:17,506 --> 02:14:18,564
Brother Satyan, what's the matter?

1872
02:14:18,641 --> 02:14:20,370
Where is mother?
- She is giving medicine to father.

1873
02:14:22,444 --> 02:14:23,502
Mother!

1874
02:14:26,315 --> 02:14:27,646
Mother! Mother!

1875
02:14:30,986 --> 02:14:32,510
Mother, you tell me! Am I a thief?

1876
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:36,384
Tell me, mother! Am I a thief?

1877
02:14:37,192 --> 02:14:42,391
Tell me, mother! Why are
you quiet? Am I a thief?

1878
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:47,597
May God forgive you, son.
- You too doubt me!

1879
02:14:50,139 --> 02:14:53,404
Then it's futile. It's futile!

1880
02:15:00,482 --> 02:15:03,212
Why? But why?

1881
02:15:03,619 --> 02:15:04,677
I can't take it anymore!

1882
02:15:10,292 --> 02:15:12,021
Why should I take another
person's blame on myself?

1883
02:15:12,094 --> 02:15:14,494
Why can't I speak the truth?

1884
02:15:14,964 --> 02:15:16,488
Brother Satyan!
- I don't care for the family!

1885
02:15:16,966 --> 02:15:18,024
I won't accept the
false accusation..

1886
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,158
..for the sake of
another person's solace!

1887
02:15:19,234 --> 02:15:20,292
Brother Satyan!
- Leave me!

1888
02:15:20,369 --> 02:15:21,427
Mother, listen! I am not a thief!

1889
02:15:21,971 --> 02:15:24,963
Brother is the thief. To save
him I took this blame on myself!

1890
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:26,098
Keep quiet!
- No!

1891
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,034
Keep quiet!

1892
02:15:28,110 --> 02:15:31,375
No! Now I won't keep quiet!
You people don't believe me!

1893
02:15:31,447 --> 02:15:32,971
But in 250 rupees, such a vast
house's expenses can be met..

1894
02:15:33,048 --> 02:15:34,640
..you believed this!

1895
02:15:34,984 --> 02:15:36,042
Satyan!

1896
02:15:36,385 --> 02:15:38,182
250 rupees took care of
treatment worth 1 000 rupees!

1897
02:15:38,253 --> 02:15:39,311
You got your jewellery back!

1898
02:15:39,521 --> 02:15:41,318
Debts of 6000
rupees were also repaid!

1899
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:43,381
Why didn't you doubt brother?

1900
02:15:43,459 --> 02:15:44,517
She didn't doubt me!

1901
02:15:47,997 --> 02:15:50,192
Because nobody is as
foolish as you in this family!

1902
02:15:52,201 --> 02:15:55,068
If you doubted my earnings,
then why didn't you ask me before?

1903
02:15:57,406 --> 02:15:59,601
Mother! Father, listen!

1904
02:16:00,542 --> 02:16:04,000
After toiling the whole day,
I wrote a book in the night.

1905
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:05,740
It became famous
as 'Hum Hindustani.'

1906
02:16:07,016 --> 02:16:09,211
And in three months 50-60
copies of this book has been sold.

1907
02:16:09,485 --> 02:16:10,952
I sold shares, books,
I supplied labours..

1908
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:13,545
..and I even worked on the docks.

1909
02:16:14,089 --> 02:16:18,025
And I even performed on the
stage to entertain people!

1910
02:16:19,561 --> 02:16:21,495
I know they will
believe what I am saying.

1911
02:16:21,964 --> 02:16:24,558
But you.. I will
show you all the papers!

1912
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:27,034
I will give you the evidence!
Come with me!

1913
02:16:42,317 --> 02:16:43,375
Sit!

1914
02:16:53,262 --> 02:16:58,598
Look! Tax and insurance
papers and see this too!

1915
02:17:05,407 --> 02:17:08,137
And this is the book that has
got me an earning of 10,000 rupees!

1916
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:11,145
See it! Why don't you look at it?

1917
02:17:13,082 --> 02:17:14,140
I met the household expense.

1918
02:17:14,349 --> 02:17:16,283
I repaid the debts and got
the money for the treatment!

1919
02:17:17,086 --> 02:17:18,348
And I got mother's jewellery back!

1920
02:17:18,954 --> 02:17:21,013
And you.. you easily
thought that I am a thief!

1921
02:17:21,090 --> 02:17:23,149
Brother, I misunderstood you.

1922
02:17:23,425 --> 02:17:25,290
Every person receives the
punishment of his mistake!

1923
02:17:25,961 --> 02:17:29,692
In your foolishness you had
accused me.. I have proved it wrong.

1924
02:17:30,099 --> 02:17:32,966
But your insensibility
has humiliated the family..

1925
02:17:33,035 --> 02:17:35,970
..and hurt our parents.. the
sin that you have committed..

1926
02:17:36,038 --> 02:17:38,973
..by calling your
elder brother a thief..

1927
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:41,703
..you should be punished
to atone for all this!

1928
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:46,038
Brother!

1929
02:17:46,982 --> 02:17:48,040
Brother!

1930
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:07,061
Brother!

1931
02:18:08,337 --> 02:18:10,202
Leave me! Leave me!

1932
02:18:10,539 --> 02:18:12,734
You don't know! He
has been so unjust!

1933
02:18:13,142 --> 02:18:14,200
Stop!

1934
02:18:43,505 --> 02:18:46,440
Satyan.. I..

1935
02:18:49,444 --> 02:18:52,641
Now I will never beat you. Never!

1936
02:18:53,448 --> 02:18:54,642
You did the right thing, brother.

1937
02:18:55,450 --> 02:18:57,111
I had committed a grave crime!

1938
02:19:16,004 --> 02:19:17,596
Mr. Verma has come!

1939
02:19:34,423 --> 02:19:38,086
Sukain! Where is Satyan? Call him!
The thief has been nabbed!

1940
02:19:38,160 --> 02:19:40,219
Sudha and Anand
have caught the thief!

1941
02:19:40,295 --> 02:19:41,353
Who is the thief?

1942
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:43,091
Shankar! My nephew.

1943
02:19:43,432 --> 02:19:45,024
Sudha and Anand got
hold of Shankar's diary..

1944
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:47,034
..and they found
out from Amirchand..

1945
02:19:47,102 --> 02:19:50,367
..that he had received my
signed notes from Shankar.

1946
02:19:51,173 --> 02:19:52,231
Call Satyan!

1947
02:19:52,307 --> 02:19:55,037
Till the time I don't apologise
to him.. I won't feel at peace.

1948
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:56,568
Call Satyan!

1949
02:19:57,179 --> 02:19:59,044
After humiliating me
in front of others..

1950
02:19:59,114 --> 02:20:01,639
..now you have got the
proof of my innocence.

1951
02:20:01,717 --> 02:20:02,775
Satyan!

1952
02:20:03,585 --> 02:20:04,643
Let me speak, brother!

1953
02:20:05,187 --> 02:20:06,984
The person who disgraced my family..

1954
02:20:07,055 --> 02:20:09,990
..because of whom l
doubted my brother..

1955
02:20:10,058 --> 02:20:12,993
..because of whom my parents
are so immersed in sorrow..

1956
02:20:14,596 --> 02:20:16,063
..that they don't even talk to me.

1957
02:20:17,132 --> 02:20:18,190
Can I ask you, Mr. Verma..

1958
02:20:18,267 --> 02:20:20,201
..what are you going
to do with that man?

1959
02:20:20,469 --> 02:20:22,596
I.. I..

1960
02:20:24,006 --> 02:20:25,064
I know.

1961
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:27,608
Though you doubted me still
you didn't testify against me.

1962
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:30,069
So how can you go
against your nephew?

1963
02:20:31,013 --> 02:20:32,537
But I won't forgive that ruffian!

1964
02:20:33,348 --> 02:20:36,010
After humiliating me and
shattering my dreams..

1965
02:20:36,084 --> 02:20:38,746
..that man can't escape from me!

1966
02:20:39,354 --> 02:20:41,083
I will find him wherever he is!

1967
02:20:41,356 --> 02:20:43,221
I will give him a punishment
that he will never forget!

1968
02:20:43,292 --> 02:20:44,350
Satyan!

1969
02:20:44,426 --> 02:20:46,417
Stop him! Stop!

1970
02:20:46,495 --> 02:20:47,553
Satyan!

1971
02:20:47,629 --> 02:20:49,028
Dear, I have come
to apologise to you!

1972
02:20:50,032 --> 02:20:54,162
Satyan, forgive me! I was unjust!
I considered you a thief.

1973
02:20:54,236 --> 02:20:57,103
The norm of the world is
give and take, Kalpana.

1974
02:20:58,106 --> 02:20:59,368
I thought my brother is a thief.

1975
02:20:59,641 --> 02:21:01,438
God punished me. You
considered me as a thief. - No!

1976
02:21:01,510 --> 02:21:04,570
Hello! Who? Sudha!
Where are you calling from?

1977
02:21:04,646 --> 02:21:07,114
I am calling from the mill office.
Please come quickly!

1978
02:21:07,182 --> 02:21:08,240
What did you say?

1979
02:21:10,118 --> 02:21:11,176
I am in grave trouble!

1980
02:21:12,187 --> 02:21:13,313
Now nobody can save you!

1981
02:21:13,522 --> 02:21:15,183
You humiliated me in
front of everybody!

1982
02:21:15,991 --> 02:21:18,391
You proved me to be a thief!
You will have to pay the price!

1983
02:21:19,461 --> 02:21:20,519
Documents!

1984
02:21:20,996 --> 02:21:22,054
By setting your
father's documents ablaze..

1985
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:23,597
..you have saved him.

1986
02:21:24,132 --> 02:21:25,394
But nobody can save you.

1987
02:21:26,535 --> 02:21:29,595
I thought I will become the
mill's owner after marrying you.

1988
02:21:30,539 --> 02:21:33,064
But you ruined my dreams!

1989
02:21:34,142 --> 02:21:36,076
Now I won't spare you!

1990
02:21:36,345 --> 02:21:37,607
Shankar!
- Brother Satyan!

1991
02:21:38,013 --> 02:21:40,072
Sister-in-law!
- Save me!

1992
02:21:40,148 --> 02:21:41,206
Shankar!

1993
02:21:41,283 --> 02:21:42,545
Move! Otherwise I will shoot!

1994
02:21:42,617 --> 02:21:45,279
Honest people are not
scared of threats, Shankar!

1995
02:21:46,555 --> 02:21:47,613
You are a human!

1996
02:21:48,223 --> 02:21:51,556
I swear on God! Today
even death can't scare me!

1997
02:21:52,027 --> 02:21:53,221
Beware!
- Leave me!

1998
02:21:54,162 --> 02:21:55,220
Leave me!

1999
02:22:17,119 --> 02:22:18,177
Beware! Sister-in-law, leave!

2000
02:25:15,297 --> 02:25:16,355
Brother Satyan!

2001
02:26:08,483 --> 02:26:10,007
Sudha! Sudha!

2002
02:26:10,952 --> 02:26:13,352
Brother Satyan!
- Satyan! Where is Satyan?

2003
02:26:14,356 --> 02:26:16,153
His life is in danger! Save him!

2004
02:26:38,513 --> 02:26:43,041
Satyan!

2005
02:26:46,521 --> 02:26:47,579
Satyan!

2006
02:26:57,065 --> 02:26:58,396
Open your eyes, Satyan!

2007
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,058
Open your eyes, Satyan!

2008
02:27:04,539 --> 02:27:07,133
Brother! Where is sister-in-law,
brother?

2009
02:27:07,475 --> 02:27:10,137
She is fine! Let's leave!

2010
02:27:10,945 --> 02:27:13,470
Brother! Have you
forgiven me, brother?

2011
02:27:14,416 --> 02:27:15,474
Satyan!

2012
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:20,354
Forget the past.

2013
02:27:21,089 --> 02:27:23,353
It's a gone era.

2014
02:27:23,558 --> 02:27:28,359
We will together write a
new story in the new era.

2015
02:27:28,963 --> 02:27:30,487
We Indians.

2016
02:27:31,499 --> 02:27:33,364
We Indians.

2017
02:27:45,513 --> 02:27:51,179
We have erased slavery
by giving up our life.

2018
02:27:51,319 --> 02:27:55,380
We have lit this lamp after
extinguishing so many lamps.

2019
02:27:56,391 --> 02:28:01,385
When we have
achieved lndependence.

2020
02:28:02,063 --> 02:28:06,397
Then we will have to protect
this freedom from all enemies.

2021
02:28:06,468 --> 02:28:10,404
It's a new
generation with new desires.

2022
02:28:10,472 --> 02:28:12,406
Now its new youth.

2023
02:28:13,007 --> 02:28:14,406
We Indians.

2024
02:28:14,476 --> 02:28:16,068
We Indians.

2025
02:28:16,144 --> 02:28:17,202
We Indians.

2026
02:28:17,278 --> 02:28:18,336
We Indians.

2027
02:28:18,413 --> 02:28:20,404
We Indians.

2028
02:28:21,082 --> 02:28:23,209
We Indians.
