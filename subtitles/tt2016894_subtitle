You dont have anything
good in house

47
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:53,713

49
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,154
my work came between

50
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,972

51
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,332
I think i have found your
next mission

52
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:24,806
only india has an anti missile
technology

53
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,707
from which we can stop most of
incoming pakistani missile

54
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,750
one man made this technology

55
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,154
he is one of the famous scientist
of the world

56
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:54,971
since few months we have a doubt
that he is sharing his knowledge with someone

57
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,105
that person is working for pakistan's
defence establishment

58
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,541

59
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,991

60
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,291

61
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,968

01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,785
I was doing my job

185
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,823
you kill someone on your every
assignment

186
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:23,761
we did not want this

187
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,901
police found their agent's
dead body

188
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,333

01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,956
i'm tired from this operation

190
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:31,760
only few people listen to
their heart

191
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:57,226
you are packing your stuff?

192
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:07,062
We caught a message

193
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:11,030

kashmir issue

194
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:21,216
monitor all pakistani sources,
i'm fed up of catching all messages

195
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,514
they are using our actors names

196
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:34,558
we have gulshan grover and amrish puri

197
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:44,862
daily they put 1 messagae.
Zee tv is coming, doordarshan is coming or not?

198
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,229
What are you searching?

199
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:15,003
You wanted a leave.

200
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,666
Why you want to go istanbul?

201
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:35,054
Take out your sweeters.
Lets go to istanbul

202
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:45,795
tell zoya. It was very easy for you
to say i love you with gun in hand

203
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,729
if you had gun in your hand,
i would say same

204
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:59,339
on that place where you killed agent feroz.
He was also there

205
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:11,389
a girl whose duty dont allow her to love,
she says that she love him

206
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,830
to a person whom she does not
know his real name

207
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:26,166
if she said then what will happen?

208
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,468
We cannot live together

209
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:40,146
daily we will request songs for each
other on all india radio

210
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,891
we are enemy.
Our duty will not allow us to live together

211
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,894
our people will not allow us
to live together

212
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,813
what tiger is doing?

213
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,219
All deplomats of the world is
dancing with each other

214
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:47,818
why indian and pakistani?

215
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:25,891
This world will not let us live

216
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,233
then why dont we make
our world

217
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,203
lets run away zoya

218
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:40,444
dont know until when our countries will fight?

219
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:44,218
We cannot wait for them

220
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,420
it will be hard to run in old age

221
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:56,358
you have to decide what will happen
with us its in your hand

222
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:54,487
where are you?
Its time to go airport

223
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:27,385
i think pakistani have kidnapped him

224
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,627
dont leak this news

225
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,058
how much money he has withdraw?

226
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,432
Around 23 lacs

227
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,507
when i will retire from job,
i will withdraw all money

228
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:50,430
tiger has very sensitive information

229
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:58,910
if someone will get this information
then all our agents will be in problem

230
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:05,711
i dont know what tiger is doing

231
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,655
but tiger will not give this information
to anyone

232
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,957
1 pakistani deligate is also missing

233
01:22:56,171 --> 01:23:00,403
this is his friend's hotel

234
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,614
do you know how many countries in the world?

235
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:23,257
201 countries

236
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:29,166
but tiger only found a pakistani girl?

237
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,388
Why you called me here?
Our plan will be ruined like this

238
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:34,958
he is a very dangerous agent.
But you have to wait

239
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,062
its not easy to make him fool

240
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:41,305
we should know what are you doing?

241
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:45,974
He dont have any doubt on me.
I cannot bring him here

242
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,243
there are lots of indians searching him

243
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:56,421
i'm bringing him here.
We will take 10:30 flight to kazakhistan

244
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,693
you take our photo on airport and
send to kazakhistan station

245
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,235
i did not recognize you

246
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:29,371
that person having coffee is an
isi agent

247
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:39,348
the person talking on the phone
is also a isi agent

248
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,221
lets go

249
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:48,460
but there is a 1 hour time
in our flight

250
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,601
we will see.
Lets go

251
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,949
but i had to do this

252
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:52,058
that you created there

253
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:00,133
he made a plan to trap you

254
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:06,702
if you saw me with captain abrar
then why you came with me?

255
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:14,576
First time i did something with heart

256
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:19,614
i wanted to see where it bring me?

257
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:31,965
I'm laughing to think what is
happenning in kazakhistan?

258
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:50,608
He is looking like a pakistani

259
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:06,129
its already 3:45 since flight landing.
Nobody came here

260
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:13,573
kazakhistan information is wrong

261
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:21,907
there were 2 big flights from istanbul

262
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:36,322
they can travel on any nationality
passport

263
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:41,461
find them
we have to find

264
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:48,265
if tiger has decied it then
it will be hard to find him

265
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:59,744
raw was running before him and
still raw exists

266
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:16,201
tiger knows so much things about us,
before this information isi will take

267
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:20,905
we have to find him and
bring him back

268
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,807
and if he dont want to come back

269
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:35,787
then you better know what we
have to do

270
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:44,863
remember 1 thing nobody will
recognize his body

271
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:57,867
lets go from here

272
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:24,559
dont send these type of correspondence

273
01:38:25,332 --> 01:38:28,927
you handle somethings by yourself

274
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:45,070
they are keeping an eye on us

275
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:25,775
they need manager authorization
for big amount

276
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:29,778
they can give half of that amount

277
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:46,999
manager will be here in 20 mins

278
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:51,467
i buy car from this money.
You withdraw all money

279
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:25,803
you ran so much

280
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:39,187
look what i found

281
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:48,063
sorry i remind your father again

282
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:04,747
they all were waiting for you

283
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:36,641
dont do anything here.
They can kill us here too

284
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:49,008
kill him if you need too

285
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:59,317
you will kill me?

286
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,664
Do know how countries in the world?

287
01:50:27,821 --> 01:50:29,755
How can you run with a pakistani girl?

288
01:50:33,526 --> 01:50:35,790
Do you know how much information
zoya can give?

289
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:41,263
She is ready to come to india

290
01:50:49,876 --> 01:50:53,903
i need your men's help

291
01:50:57,584 --> 01:51:01,213
she is with some people.
They will not allow her to come

292
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:15,292
you want us to attack isi in cuba

293
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:28,842
if she is a pakistani then you
call her a girl

294
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:35,016
they are taking her to pakistan by
morning flight

295
01:51:37,424 --> 01:51:39,619
we have to do know

296
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:04,614
you will be here

297
01:52:06,152 --> 01:52:09,315
you will block them from here

298
01:52:09,956 --> 01:52:15,622
to arrest me you bring an army

299
01:52:16,229 --> 01:52:20,290
we come here to arrest our teacher

300
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:42,744
our flight is taking off

301
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:07,805
you indian friend ran away

302
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:57,305
i will reach.
Dont worry about me

303
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,971
we will have only 1 chance to take off

304
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:35,726
bring us to a safe place

305
02:00:12,138 --> 02:00:14,971
you call me from my real name

306
02:00:15,575 --> 02:00:18,066
you have shown me your reality

307
02:00:18,978 --> 02:00:21,845
first time i did what my heart told me

308
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:25,416
you are fogetting your duty

309
02:00:35,294 --> 02:00:38,229
its not easy to live with regret

310
02:00:38,798 --> 02:00:41,858
its cheating to love with enemy

311
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:51,241
when i was felling in love nobody told
me its wrong

312
02:00:56,148 --> 02:00:58,309
until when you will run?

313
02:00:58,951 --> 02:01:05,151
When india and pakistan will not need
isi and raw, we will come back

314
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:38,378
they both are missing in raw and isi files

315
02:01:39,759 --> 02:01:44,492
but still we are getting news to
see them in different countries of the world

316
02:01:45,264 --> 02:01:49,598
but nobody is sure they are
tiger and zoya

317
02:01:51,037 --> 02:01:55,770
raw and isi still searching tiger
and zoya

318
02:01:57,777 --> 02:02:02,077
first time in history raw and isi did
work together

319
02:02:04,717 --> 02:02:10,485
wherever they are, after getting this news
they will be happy
