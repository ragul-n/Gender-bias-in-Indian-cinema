What? Does that mean 
you won’t pay me until you get your salary?

Once they give me my salary, 
I will give you the rent, aunty.

Shouldn’t you have woken me up 
when you woke up in the morning?

Then you should have told me 
to wake you up last night itself.

-Here, this is the delivery list.

What is this appearance? 
You are looking worse by the day.

they will surely think that you are out to rob them.

-No, his mother’s.

Why? 
-For marriage.

-No, his.

62
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,300
Sorry. 
-Anyways, don’t you worry, boss.

76
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,680
It would be great if he gave us our salary first. 
Bonus is asking a bit much.

77

Buddy, can you lends me some money?

78
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,640

Come here, you shabby fellow!

80
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,050
Here. This is your salary.

81
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,550
Why is it only half the salary?

82
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,050
What do you mean half the salary? 
It’s your salary for one whole month.

83
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,180

84
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,180

85
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,800
Yeah.

86
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,640
When I joined here, you told me 
that the salary was 11,000 rupees.

87
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,430
And with all the deductions, I would get 8,000 in hand.

88
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,220
And then there will be tax cuts, right?

89
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,260
What are those deductions?

90
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Last month, when your bike was repaired...

91
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,180
One thousand for that.

92
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,800
If you had got it repaired with mechanic near my house, 
it would have costed only 300 rupees, sir.

93
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,260
In such places since they may steal genuine parts of the bike...

94
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,550
I gave it in the showroom.

95
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,550
What else did you deduct?

96
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,550
One thousand rupees for three late deliveries.

97
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,470
What else?

98
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,800
One thousand for the office fund.

99
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,050
Even with those deductions, 
I should still be getting 5,000 rupees.

100
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Did you forget?

101
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,800
One thousand was deducted last month 
for your surprise birthday party.

102
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,760
Did I ask for it?

103
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,510
Did I want you to celebrate that?

104
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,930
Why would it be a surprise if you asked for it?

105
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,100
How would that cost a thousand, sir?

106
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,930
We bought the cake and candles from Swiss castle.

107
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,930
What? Didn’t you get it from 
Bangalore Iyengar bakery?

108
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,390
Did you see where I got it from?

109
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,850
Except for the piece that I cut, 
You took the rest of it with you, sir.

110
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,140
Don’t talk like a child.

111
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,260
I took it for my children.

112
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,100
What do you want me to do, now?

113
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,010

119

3,500 are not alphabets boss. 
They are numbers.

3,000 rupees?

134
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,720
Rent is only a thousand rupees, right?

135

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,600
One thousand.

138
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,260
What?

139
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,050
One thousand for a fan that doesn’t work 
and a light that doesn’t switch on?

140
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,100
Who knows? 
You might have been using an AC.

141
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,600
Mom, it’s very cold inside.

142
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,680
Why is it cold? 
-If you have no clothes on your body, You are going to feel cold.

143

What did you understood?

145
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,220
The ones who has been using a one-star AC.

146
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,930
Five-star ACs are very costly.

147
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,720
We are the ones who have been 
paying your bills, isn’t it?

148
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,220
I am going to smash your face. Jerk!

149
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,970
Get inside.

150
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
She scolded me only.

151
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,140
What’s the other thousand for?

152
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,220
Maintenance….

153
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,640
For your maintenance?

154
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,100
No, it’s for the apartments.

155
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,350
Tell this useless person to have a bath occasionally at least.

156
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,550
I am coming there. 
-Anyways, what’s with all this?

157
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,890
Would anyone call this an apartment?

158
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,300
I want to practice my dance every morning 
But I am scared that the building would crumble.

159
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,220
If you find it that difficult to live here, 
you can vacate the house and go away.

160
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,760
As if someone is begging them to stay here.

161
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,430
We will build our own house.

162
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,510
Horse faced woman!

163
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,300
Has he been this way since the morning?

164
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,760
Thank goodness!

165
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,680
What are you watching?

166
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,800
Sherlock.

167
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,640
This is Shell lock.

168
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,600
What do we have to eat?

169
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,970
There is mango pickle in the jar.

170
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,600
I will tell my dad this joke. 
Go on watch Sherlock.

171
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,050
Why are you that focused on that currency note since a while?

172
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,470
Did our boss give you a fake one?

173
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,760
What happened? Tell me.

174
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,800
I was wondering how should 
I spend these thousand bucks.

175
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,010
Oh, that…

176
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,550
Like this.

177
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,600
You.. fool!

178
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,890
Instead of going to these liquor parlours, 
We would have set this up at home.

179
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,140
Consider this your home.

180
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,100
Feel free, buddy.

181
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,100
How can I feel comfortable? 
Are the drinks here free?

182
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,640
I am stressed about the bill.

183
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,430
You have been harping on the bill for way too long.

184
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,800
It will reduce if you drink less.

185
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,010
Why do you always stress about everything?

186
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,970
Not just you. Even i got my salary today.

187
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,050
You... 
-First, have your drink.

188
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,350
I can feel myself getting fat.

189
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,430
I am going to hit the gym tomorrow, buddy.

190
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,390
Why does he laugh? 
Did he think I was joking?

191
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,010
And this fellow here…

192
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,350
What happened?

193
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,470
This useless life!

194
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,640
I’ve worked hard for thirty whole days...

195
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,100
three.... and all of it went down the drain in three hours.

196
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,800
Why are you talking about salary 
when we are on the topic of life?

197
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,680
Buddy...

198
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,100
After all that back breaking work, 
He pays me just four thousand bucks.

199
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,470
Just Four thousand bucks.

200
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,890
Yes buddy. It’s four fingers.

201
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,390
What does he think of himself?

202
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,260
Who do you mean?

203
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,680
No, brother. He wasn’t talking about you.

204
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,010
Close your zip.

205
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,800
Such cheap fellow!

206
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,350
Such cheap fellow!

207
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,180
Yes. He is cheap. 
Come this way.

208
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,470
Cheap fellow!

209
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,470
You are drunk and are creating a scene.

210
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,260
I can’t take it anymore. 
I can’t take it anymore.

211
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,800
Just calm down buddy.

212
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,800
No. I won’t calm down.

213
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,220
What else can you do if not shut up? 
Are you going to kill yourself?

214
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,720
Yes!

215
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,930
Yes. Kill myself.

216
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,800
Are you going to kill yourself for real?

217
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,180
I am going to go back to my village.

218
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,260
What are you going to do in the village?

219
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,350
Something or the other.

220
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,850
But I am going to quit this shitty job.

221
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,970
I am going to quit.

222
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,890
I am going to quit.

223
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,510
What’s wrong with him?

224
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,180
I am going to quit.

225
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,510
Will you quit? 
-I will quit.

226
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,430
Will you quit? 
-I will quit.

227
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,050
Shut it!

228
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,260
Is he going to quit alcohol?

229
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,180
Dumb wit!

230
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,050
Just hold him steady.

231
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,550
Excuse me.

232
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,760
Bro, could you give a lift to the slums of Jubilee Hills?

233
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,300
Hello.

234
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,970
What do you mean? 
Is he going to offer the three of us a ride?

235
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,640
Nope. I meant he would at least give me a ride.

236
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,550
Buddy, would you like to have Dosa?

237
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,630
There is the batter. 
Make yourself one.

238
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,710
There is very little water. 
Have a shower immediately.

239
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,550
Yes, mom.

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,630
I am fine.

241
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, I got it.

242
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
I will send it to you.

243
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,300
No, I don’t need it.

244
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,250
I will call you back.

245
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,500
It’s all burnt.

246
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,710
I will make it myself.

247
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,670
Don’t I have to eat?

248
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,800
What? You didn’t eat yet?

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
If you would let me eat then…

250
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,050
Ok. Fine. I’ll make them for you. 
Go and get ready.

251
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,670
I told you I am going to quit from today, right?

252
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,000
I thought you said that in a 
drunken stage yesterday night.

253
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,960
Are you really quitting?

254
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,550
Yes.

255
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,880
What are you going to do after you quit?

256
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you going to watch serials just like him?

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,750
I don’t know. I didn’t think that far.

258
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,000
Anyways, who was that on the phone? 
Mom?

259
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,380
What did she want?

260
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,630
I have to send her money.

261
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,460
How are you going to do that?

262
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,250
With a money order form.

263
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,630
If you order you will get Dosa... 
but not money.

264
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,960
Gosh!

265
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,340
You speak as if I am getting paid in thousands on that job.

266
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,590
I worked like a dog for a month and got paid just 4,000 bucks.

267
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,000
If you don’t work, you wouldn’t even get that money.

268
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,630
I got 4,000 bucks at least.

269
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,880
You were paid 3,000 bucks.

270
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,630
Did you ever hold 5,000 rupees on you, ever?

271
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,420
The waiter in that bar yesterday, 
gets more in tips than my monthly salary.

272
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,210
You think only they get tips? 
Don’t you think we could get them too?

273
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,550
Just looking at your face, 
they don’t even feel like paying you money.

274
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,550
Tips is really a far cry.

275
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,880
Tips are not given because of one’s face. 
It’s because of the service provided.

276
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,630
I wonder what kind of service 
it is that you are providing.

277
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,090
Come with me. I’ll show you.

278
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:07,920
Never mind. 
It doesn’t matter.

279
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,250
Buddy, listen to me.

280
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,630
Just accompany me today.

281
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,340
If you still want to quit then it’s up to you.

282
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,050
Please, buddy. Come with me.

283
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,590
Go on. Accompany him. 
He is eager to show himself off.

284
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,960
Alright, fine.

285
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,250
I’ll show you the life.

286
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,710
Have your Dosas.

287
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,500
Babu.

288
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,590
Wait a second...

289
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,340
What is this?

290
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,960
5,000 rupees.

291
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,050
You told me that I never saw that kind of money, right?

292
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,800
Where did you get this from?

293
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,550
I saved it.

294
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,670
Saving 5,000 rupees from the 3,000 that you earned as salary.

295
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,300
You must be truly outstanding!

296
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,000
Shut it!

297
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,340
And you take it.

298
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:33,920
Why?

299
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,380
Don’t you have to send money to your mother?

300
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,090
No. I don’t want it.

301
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,250
Swear on me, if you don’t take it.

302
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,960
No. I don’t want it.

303
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,300
Swear on you, if you don’t take it. 
Take it.

304
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,750
Anyways, what are you going to show me?

305
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,920
Before I show you something, 
there are a few things I need to tell you.

306
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,590
There are five rules for customer service.

307
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,500
Rule number one:

308
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
Customer is god.

309
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,000
If the customer is god, we are the priests.

310
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,750
Our blessings are equal to the amount of praises 
you heap upon those gods.

311
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,130
Even if the customer doesn't have any sense, 
we must maintain decency.

312
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,590
Buddy, It doesn't matter even if we have ruffled hair...

313
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,090
we must always have a pleasant smile on our face.

314
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,250
Excuse me, sir.

315
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,380
Oh dear!

316
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,460
When the customer opens the door, 
you must greet them with a good morning.

317
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,420
You should always treat them very warmly.

318
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,750
Last but not the least 
Rule number five.

319
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,590
Customer is always right.

320
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,090
Customer is king.

321
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,130
You told me that they are gods a while ago.

322
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,170
Is that really important now?

323
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,920
Why are you focussing on that instead 
of what all has been said?

324
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,630
Hi, ma’am.

325
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,130
A very good morning.

326
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,960
Hope you are having a great day.

327
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
I am Yesu Dasu

328
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,050
And this is my colleague, Babu Mohan. 
We are here to give you the package.

329
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,880
It’s an auspicious day 
Your earrings are amazing, ma’am.

330
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,500
I don't think they are actual gold.

331
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,340
Madam, someone is at the door for you.

332
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,460
Ratna Madam... 
[Watching TV]

333
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,000
What’s wrong with you? 
Please hurry.

334
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,380
Don’t be tensed Ratna.

335
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,170
Nothing will happen to me.

336
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,880
Oh goodness!

337
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,170
What happened...? 
why did you stop?

338
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,300
You forgot to put your seat belt on, Ratna.

339
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
You love me so much my husband.

340
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,630
Who are looking for, young man?

341
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,840
Move aside lady.

342
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey! Who are you people? 
-Sorry, madam.

343
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,710
Hello, madam.

344
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,630
My name is Yesu Dasu.

345
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,670
We are here to deliver the package your ordered online.

346
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,210
This day is your day.

347
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,550
We didn’t order anything.

348
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,960
Is this Ramesh Raju’s house?

349
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,460
No, it isn’t.

350
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,590
It’s Rameez Raja’s house.

351
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,670
This is apartment 403, right?

352
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,210
Yes.

353
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,710
Then, Ramesh Raju’s house must be in. 
Go in and call him.

354
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,340
Have you gone insane?!

355
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,550
Don’t you think I would know who lives in my house?

356
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,920
Won’t Ramesh Raja stay here? 
-Who the hell are you?

357
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,670
Who the hell let you in?

358
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,170
This watchman doesn't have any work. 
It's Okay, Madam... Sorry Madam.

359
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,920
He let’s in every Tom, Dick and Harry. 
It’s turning into a bloody market!

360
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,920
Ramesh Raja’s house is apartment 503.

361
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,800
Hi, sir... A very good morning.

362
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,300
Hope you are having a great day. 
I am Yesu Dasu.

363
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,960
Enough!

364
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,550
Who wants to hear such nonsense?! 
First, give me the package.

365
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,250
Sorry sir.

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,840
I was told that it would be delivered 
the day before yesterday.

367
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
What’s the reason for delay?

368
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,550
You have provided the wrong apartment number. 
That is why, it was delayed.

369
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,340
Did it really take you two days to 
deliver it from one floor to another?

370
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
It took us two days to figure out your apartment, sir.

371
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,960
Never mind. 
How much?

372
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,920
It’s 7,500 Rupees.

373
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,960
It’s 7,500 rupees only.

374
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,500
Isn’t there a discount?

375
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,590
You bought the item when it was already on discount. 
I like your smile.

376
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,670
Ok, I will get the money.

377
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,670
Old crook!

378
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,710
Customer is god. 
-Not him.

379
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,340
Bloody old bugger.

380
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,170
Thank you, sir.

381
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,550
Sir…

382
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,750
There is shortage of 500 rupees.

383
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,500
Is that so?

384
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,130
Yes sir. 
If you want, you can count it.

385
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,300
That’s right.

386
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,800
Sir seems to be weak in mathematics.

387
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,250
Thank you, sir. 
-Hey!

388
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,340
Let’s go.

389
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,920
Why are you laughing?

390
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,670
You gave me so many big tips 
on customer service, right?

391
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,710
I was just recollecting them.

392
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:46,800
What is this?

393
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,130
It’s a 500 rupee note.

394
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:48,960
It’s the tip.

395
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,130
When did he give it?

396
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,380
I took it.

397
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,170
How?

398
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,710
So, you mean to say that 
it isn’t the customers who are giving you tips?

399
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,460
Why would I wait for them to give? 
I am taking it myself.

400
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,550
That isn’t called a tip. 
That is a crime.

401
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,750
Drinking and driving is also a crime. 
But, does that stop us?

402
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,500
If we are caught drinking and driving, 
We can pay the fine and get out.

403
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,920
If we are caught stealing…

404
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,170
We can get out on bail.

405
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,550
Does that mean you will steal?

406
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,880
The 500 rupees that I took is not called stealing.

407
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,590
What does it mean?

408
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,630
It’s called pocketing.

409
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,630
What is the difference?

410
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,460
Stealing involves intimidation and robbing people.

411
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,460
Pocketing is just smartly slipping things into your pocket.

412
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,670
Don’t play with words and cover a crime.

413
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,050
Buddy, don’t go overboard.

414
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,500
Anyways, these people bought those items on discount.

415
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,840
Now think that they bought it when there was no discount.

416
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,210
What if you get caught?

417
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,000
There is no way I would get caught.

418
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,630
How?

419
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,090
Look dude.

420
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,710
There are two kinds of payment.

421
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,840
One, card 
Two, cash.

422
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,710
Card payment doesn't help us at all.

423
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,920
We need cash on delivery.

424
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,090
And we should pick those deliveries where 
the net value is above 5,000 rupees.

425
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,800
The net value is inversely proportional to risk.

426
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,460
Generally, the customers who place the 
order leave the house in the mornings on work.

427
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,920
The parents or grandparents are the ones 
who take the delivery.

428
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,880
They are our main targets.

429
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,960
When we deliver the product, 
they give us the money.

430
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,500
That could start from 1,000…

431
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,000
..to Rs.50 even.

432
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,960
we should only take one note out of the bundle.

433
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,670
If you get too greedy and take a couple or more 
we will surely get caught.

434
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,210
If we take only one single note, they would doubt themselves 
and give us an extra note to compensate.

435
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,300
Sometimes if they don’t, 
You have to use their age to our advantage.

436
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,710
You will have to make them believe, 
confuse them...

437
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,880
and take it from them.

438
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,090
Take a look.

439
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,000
If you are this clear about your strategy, 
Since how long you have been at this?

440
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,880
Six months.

441
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,170
Six months? 
-Yeah.

442
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,880
Didn’t you get caught at least once in those six months?

443
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,380
No.

444
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,840
How much are you stealing per day? 
-Why do you use the term stealing again?

445
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,590
Alright, fine. How much are you pocketing?

446
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,710
Three to four 
-Hundred?

447
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,630
No. Thousand.

448
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,710
That means its over a lakh a month. 
-Approximately.

449
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,340
Anyways, if you want to survive in a city like this, 
We need to have that much at least, right?

450
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,960
Apart from that, 
half of it goes to charity.

451
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,210
Since we are born as human beings, 
We need to do at least some charity, buddy.

452
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,380
Is that why when boss gives you 3000 bucks 
you just take it, without any questions asked?

453
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,210
Of course.

454
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,840
I give him a tip of 500 rupees from it.

455
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,960
And at times, I even lend him money.

456
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,300
If it was all about doing this, why do you spew silly philosophies 
that ‘the customer is the king’, and as such?

457
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,340
Disgusting!

458
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,880
Let’s go.

459
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,050
In life, just remember that...

460
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,590
if you are about to embark upon a wrong path 
and someone gives you the lecture on ethics,

461
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,340
at that point, your mind automatically 
turns onto the wrong path.

462
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,590
It’s human nature.

463
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,090
Didn’t you get it?

464
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,000
Didn’t you see,

465
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,090
they want a discount on the things 
they have already ordered on discount?

466
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,000
How will these ‘cheap kings’ afford 
to give us any tips at all?

467
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,750
So, just listen to me.. just as you follow celebrities on twitter, 
follow me in the same manner.

468
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,840
I don’t want this kind of stolen money.

469
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,460
Really?

470
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,920
What kind of money do you think 
I gave you in the morning?

471
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,460
Does that mean?

472
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,670
It’s surely not the money I saved. 
It’s pocketed money.

473
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,920
Damn!

474
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,050
Why do you keep calling it robbery?

475
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,710
Here…. This is the note that we took from him 
and this is the note that he gave us.

476
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,710
Brother, we are blind.

477
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,710
Could you please tell us if this note is valid or not?

478
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,300
Ok.

479
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,130
Yes. It is valid.

480
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,420
What about this?

481
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,380
Oh no!

482
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,170
How dare you steal the note that I stole first?

483
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,130
Where is the note? 
-Sorry, brother.

484
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:07,550
Get lost.

485
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,380
Do you think he payed attention 
to how we earned the money?

486
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,250
He was concerned only with whether it is valid or not.

487
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,300
Everyone pays attention only to that.

488
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,840
Nowadays, if we see a rupee coin 
on the road, People pocket it.

489
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,840
People themselves are not ethical.

490
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,630
How can the money we earn be 
subject to criteria of ethics?

491
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,630
You talk as if with this one note their lives will get destroyed.

492
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
They are very well off.

493
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,380
This single note makes no difference to them.

494
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,920
But for us, 
this is our need.

495
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,840
I thought that if I shared this with you, 
you would salute my wisdom.

496
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,050
Instead, you are making me feel bad.

497
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,210
I showed you everything that was necessary

498
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,300
And told you every trick that was important

499
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,880
Buddy, despite all this, if you want to go back 
to your village or stay here,

500
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,380
is your choice.

501
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,960
Alright... let's go. 
We have a lot more deliveries to make.

502
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,170
You go on ahead.

503
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,500
What about you? How will you return?

504
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,750
Alright, fine. 
Let’s meet up in the evening.

505
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,210
Give it a thought once more.

506
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,920
Give it a thought once more.

507
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,380
Buddy, are you watching it?

508
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,710
Alright, Tell me the story in the evening.

509
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,130
He may pee again.

510
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,300
Delivery, huh?

511
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:05,960
Yes.

512
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,960
How many?

513
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,710
Three.

514
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,630
Name.

515
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,380
Babu.

516
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,210
Which village?

517
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,420
Why my village name?

518
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,750
I was just kidding.

519
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,460
Isn’t the construction over yet?

520
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,340
Why? Are you interested in buying?

521
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,590
Where is the parking?

522
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,550
It’s all vacant. 
You can park anywhere.

523
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,710
What are you looking at?

524
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,880
I am so sorry.

525
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
Nothing happened to you, right? 
-First, turn off the vehicle.

526
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,710
Okay.

527
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,420
You aren’t hurt anywhere, right?

528
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,130
First, park your bike, madam. 
-Okay.

529
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,090
I am so sorry, sir.

530
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,170
I have been telling my mechanic repeatedly 
to set the gear wire.

531
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,550
That is gear less bike madam... right?

532
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,250
I mean the brake wire.

533
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,420
Can I help you with the bag?

534
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,170
Damn!

535
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,380
I am extremely sorry.

536
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,670
Madam, it’s alright. Just go on.

537
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,460
I can actually help you with the bag.

538
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,800
No… No… 
-Just…

539
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,380
I didn’t think that the bag was open.

540
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,460
Sorry.

541
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,130
I beg you, madam. 
Please leave... I will take care of it.

542
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,550
Are you sure? 
I can help you.

543
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,420
Thank you, madam.

544
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,590
I will take care of it.

545
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,300
Okay.

546
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,590
Tejaswi...

547
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,130
Madam!

548
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,130
Your envelope.

549
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,340
[Mobile Ringing]

550
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,420
I just came here for passport verification.

551
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,000
You mean Thomas? 
He is useless!

552
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,130
He is a good for nothing fellow. 
…someone called Tejaswi….

553
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,340
I will be there in an hour.

554
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,710
No. No. I just got here.

555
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,130
You tell me.

556
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,090
This?

557
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,670
They call it Mansion heights.

558
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,670
It’s quite tall.

559
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,630
It’s not Mansion house. 
It’s Mansion heights.

560
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,550
All you can think of is alcohol.

561
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,550
It’s been a week since I ordered it.

562
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,550
Ravi, apartment 501. 
When will it come?

563
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,210
How would I know sir?

564
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,380
What do you mean you don’t know? 
Aren’t you the one delivering it?

565
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,130
I am just a delivery boy, sir.

566
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,750
Please call the customer care and figure it out.

567
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,710
Okay, Just tell me the number.

568
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,210
The website that you ordered from 
would have the number.

569
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,920
Why are you getting irritated?

570
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,050
Don’t ever forget that customer is god. 
and god is great.

571
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
Are you blind? 
-Sorry uncle.

572
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,500
How dare you call me uncle? 
Rascal!

573
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,550
Sorry Rascal.

574
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,840
God is great, huh? 
Useless fellow.

575
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,420
Hi, sir... My name is Babu.

576
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,420
Hello.

577
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,090
Good morning, sir.

578
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,210
My name is Babu Mohan.

579
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,130
Good morning, sir.

580
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:01,880
Morning.

581
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
My name is Babu Mohan.

582
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,170
I am the delivery boy.

583
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,630
This is the product that you ordered online. 
I am here to deliver the product.

584
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,340
Cancel.

585
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,670
Sir?

586
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,460
If you say cancel now, 
then what will happen to me, sir.

587
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,800
Cancel.

588
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,590
Sir… 
-Cancel…

589
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,670
Sir… Sir… Sir…

590
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,750
Why are you laughing like that?

591
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,580
Isn’t there anyone else at home?

592
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,080
Oh! So.. that you can beat me up 
and rob the entire place, is it?

593
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
You Idiot!

594
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,830
Oh no! Madam, I am a delivery boy.

595
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,750
What bhai (brother)?

596
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,040
Not bhai… boy. Boy.

597
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,500
Oh… Bye. 
Bye…

598
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,870
Who are you looking for?

599
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,830
Lady, I am the delivery… 
I am here to give this to you.

600
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,870
We don’t want it. Absolutely not.

601
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,080
Lady, I am not selling it. 
This is yours.

602
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,620
Huh? Ours?

603
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,450
Yes. You ordered it online. 
I am here to deliver it to you.

604
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,870
What should we do with this?

605
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,120
You do whatever you want. 
But pay me what you owe.

606
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,370
What? Money?

607
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,080
How shamelessly you ask for money!

608
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,580
During our time, even when we wanted 
to give money, people never took it.

609
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,620
I am a poor old woman.

610
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,790
You are asking me without even understanding 
how this old woman can have any money?

611
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,080
Here, take it.

612
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,000
What is this?

613
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,620
Didn’t you ask for money?

614
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,910
Ten rupees?

615
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,330
I didn’t have any change 
that is why I gave you ten rupees.

616
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,540
If not, your face deserves only five rupees.

617
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,080
Madam, I gave you the package, right? 
You have to pay money for that.

618
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,540
What? What? 
Money for the package?

619
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,000
What is this nonsense?

620
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,450
I don’t mean that package.

621
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,660
I meant the items packed inside the package. 
You have to pay for those.

622
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,370
8,000 rupees.

623
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,370
Oh…8,000 rupees.

624
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,160
You could have told that earlier?

625
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,290
My son told me that something would be delivered here 
and asked me to pay 8,000 rupees.

626
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,330
Wait here. 
I will get it.

627
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,290
What?

628
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,080
I gave you ten rupees earlier, right? 
Give it back.

629
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,080
Wait here. I will be back.

630
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,040
Madam, I gave you Rs.50 by mistake…

631
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,120
Old hag!

632
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,910
I am a bit thirsty. 
Could you give me some water?

633
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,080
I will cook a meal for you and serve you as well. 
Why don’t you come in and eat?

634
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,040
Why do you talk like that? 
I just asked for a glass of water.

635
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,410
Yes, it’s my house.

636
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,080
Otherwise, are you thinking it’s your house, Idiot.

637
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,120
Here, drink it.

638
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,580
Madam, It is short by Rs. 500.

639
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,120
It is short by Rs. 500.

640
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,160
How is that possible?

641
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,870
My son counted it out and gave it.

642
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,500
It’s true. 
You really are short by 500 rupees.

643
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,450
You mean to say I am lying?

644
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,910
Oh no! I didn’t mean it that way.

645
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,160
If you wish, 
You could count it yourself.

646
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,290
So, you mean to say that I can’t count?

647
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,200
8,000 means there should be 16 notes here. 
But there are only 15 notes here.

648
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,500
When I went to get you some water, 
you must have nabbed a note from the pile.

649
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,040
Look at that face. 
It’s like a thief.

650
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,040
What do you mean? 
Why would I steal?

651
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,830
Why would I need to do that?

652
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,290
How would I know what your needs are?

653
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,500
Leave all that. 
Hand over another 500 rupees.

654
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,580
You steal the money 
and bulldoze me.

655
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,370
You Idiot! 
You are going to die of worms.

656
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,700
Madam, mind your words.

657
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,000
What? Mind my words? 
Why should I?

658
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,410
You rob me of money and trying to fool me. 
-Madam, what is this? Let go off my collar.

659
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,120
Why should I? 
Thief!

660
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,160
Oh goodness!

661
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,200
You purposefully sent me inside 
and are playing your tricks on me.

662
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,160
Let me go...I don’t want the money. 
You keep it.

663
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,580
Just because I am old 
you think I am vulnerable.

664
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,950
What is this? You are going overboard. 
-You!

665
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,080
Grandma…

666
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,120
Grandma…

667
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,790
Thank God! 
I was tensed that you might have got caught.

668
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,870
But you put the money down and 
got the package back.

669
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,620
That was excellent move, buddy.

670
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,830
Even then, he would be caught. 
-Hey. Who is that?

671
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,370
I dare you to come and talk in front of me.

672
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,660
Tell him to think hard. 
-Who is that?

673
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,200
Hey, Abhi.

674
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,910
Hi. 
-Hey, go away.

675
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,620
You got the package. 
That’s all well and good.

676
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,540
But your skin is under her nails. 
What about that?

677
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,500
That’s a valid point.

678
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,660
When the police come, 
they will find her sprawled on the floor,

679
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,160
And then, the forensics would come in.

680
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,790
They are going to conduct post mortem 
and remove the skin from her nails.

681
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,580
And they will check that 
and then catch you.

682
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,870
My foot! 
We are not worth that much effort.

683
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,450
But the crime still exists upstairs.

684
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,040
Come on!

685
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,410
Come on!

686
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,870
Come on!

687
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,950
What should we do?

688
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,370
We need four plastic covers.

689
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:34,950
Oh! Coat?

690
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,500
Is it to cut that old lady into pieces 
and pack her in them?

691
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:36,950
Nope.

692
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,370
So that his finger prints are not found by the forensics.

693
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,160
Wow!

694
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,370
Now, her fingernails have to be cut.

695
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,370
To do that an axe would be needed.

696
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,080
A nail cutter would do.

697
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,830
You should have said that first, donkey.

698
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,660
Today is Tuesday, 
Is it alright to cut nails today?

699
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,750
Shut up! 
Just cut it!

700
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,660
Looks like he might even paint her nails.

701
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,910
Hey, Make it fast.

702
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,830
There is no enough time. 
If someone comes, it will become a huge problem.

703
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,160
Oh lord! 
Everything is over.

704
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,540
It must be her son.

705
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,660
Until she opens the door, 
he is going to keep banging on the door.

706
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,120
And after the door opens, 
He is going to hit him.

707
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,910
Please do something.

708
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,750
Don’t fret. 
Check who that is from that peephole.

709
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,000
Who is it?

710
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,830
Is it Chiranjeevi or Balakrishna to recognise 
And tell immediately?

711
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,790
Who is it?

712
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,950
Sir, paper bill.

713
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,540
Oh! 
It’s just the paper boy.

714
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,870
He is just going to bang on the door a 
few more times and go away.

715
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,910
If he stays any longer, 
there are two things that are likely to happen.

716
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,870
One, the neighbours could get suspicious.

717
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,790
Two, he might go to the neighbours and ask them.

718
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,540
Third, the neighbours might be on vacation.

719
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,540
First, open the door.

720
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,080
No, don’t do it.

721
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,410
If he sees you, It’s going to be a huge problem.

722
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,700
It’s only going to be a problem if he sees his face. 
Not if it’s his hand.

723
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,040
If he gets caught, his photo will 
be printed in the very same newspaper.

724
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,160
Because it's a murder.

725
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,120
How much is it?

726
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,200
Why do we care?

727
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,660
Just pay him from the pile of money 
that old woman had.

728
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:15,910
No.

729
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,040
If even a single note goes missing. 
It’s going to be a problem.

730
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,700
Just pay it with the cash you have.

731
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,410
That’s another dent in his pocket.

732
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,620
Thank goodness! 
At last we have crossed one hurdle.

733
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,830
What’s the delay? 
Let’s head out.

734
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,290
Stop.

735
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,000
If the body is here, 
Someone or the other will get suspicious.

736
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:50,910
So?

737
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,660
Do you want us to bury it in the burial ground?

738
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,080
No.

739
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,870
Take her to the bedroom 
and lay her like she is asleep.

740
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,700
Oh lord!

741
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,950
How would we know which room is hers?

742
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,750
Looking at her, I get the impression that she is eccentric.

743
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,540
Even though she is in such a well-maintained house, 
She must have come with her old rickety stuff.

744
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,160
It must be this room for sure.

745
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,950
I need an energy drink.

746
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,290
[Song humming]

747
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,750
Where is the charger?

748
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,450
What’s that sound?

749
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,250
You man! the door must have shut because of the wind.

750
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,750
How can a door that is closed be shut due to the wind?

751
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,540
(Humming a tune)

752
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,120
Sir Sherlock Holmes? 
-Yes?

753
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,120
Not you. 
First, lay that body on the bed.

754
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,950
[Watching TV] Why this coconut water now? 
Let’s go to the hospital now.

755
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,870
You know it’s very sunny outside, right?

756
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,370
I can’t take it if you get a sun stroke Ratna.

757
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,160
Drink Ratna.

758
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,620
Stop Ratna.

759
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,700
Did we ever throw away a coconut 
without having the tender coconut pulp inside?

760
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,660
What’s that expression? 
like a player winning a gold medal at the Olympics.

761
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,540
It appears that he has lost his stamina. 
-That’s why I constantly advice him to hit the gym.

762
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,410
Ratna….

763
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,500
Oh no! They always end the episode with suspense.

764
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,950
Why don’t you give her a facial as well?

765
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,750
How did the TV get switched on?

766
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,660
Because the electricity must have come back.

767
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,750
When did the power cut happen?

768
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,580
When he came by.

769
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,500
What do you mean?

770
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,000
When he came and rang the bell, 
the bell worked, right?

771
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,830
But when the paperboy rang the bell 
it didn’t work, right?

772
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,000
But he banged on the door.

773
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,830
One knocks on the door only 
when there is a power cut...right?

774
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Oh my god! 
Blood!

775
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,080
Blood is red in colour.

776
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,580
The colour of ghost’s blood is red.

777
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,830
Ghosts don’t have a body.

778
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,290
How can they have blood? 
Bloody fool.

779
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:06,160
If the saree that the ghost wears is white, 
why can’t their blood be white? Buffalo!

780
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,750
What is this? 
Why do I smell toothpaste?

781
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,040
My grandma told me that if a dead body 
is not cremated within half-an-hour, it will turn into a ghost.

782
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,660
Did she tell you this after she was dead or before?

783
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,200
Hey stop!

784
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,160
I think that old lady turned into a ghost.

785
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,080
Why is the ghost laughing 
with the clarity like in Dolby Atmos?

786
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,540
This woman looks like a ghost herself

787
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,000
Why wouldn’t she turn into a ghost after she died?

788
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,580
What do you say Mr. Sherlock?

789
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,120
Hey! we finished what we set out to do.

790
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,040
Let’s go.

791
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,200
I appreciate it.

792
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,410
Hi, baby... I just woke up.

793
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,660
Have you had your breakfast? 
What did you eat?

794
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,790
Why is it Upma all the time, baby?

795
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,500
You know what?

796
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,000
I am thinking of having steamed rice cakes 
dipped in lentil vegetable stew.

797
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,450
Yes... Sambar- Idli.

798
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,370
It means, you did all of this while 
there was another person in the house?

799
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,000
Yes.

800
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,620
Do you think she saw him?

801
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,290
If she saw, she would be really shocked. 
She wouldn’t be talking on the phone calmly.

802
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,250
Yeah.

803
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,790
Come home as soon as the flight lands. 
I will be waitin…

804
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,870
Madam, did you call me?

805
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,120
I will call you back.

806
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,370
Instead of calling you, 
I should fire you.

807
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,160
Funny girl.

808
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,790
Why are you laughing?

809
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,830
What I mean is….

810
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,700
The shower in the bathroom isn’t working again.

811
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,500
Is it?

812
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,120
I will take a look.

813
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,410
At me?

814
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,330
No, madam. 
At the shower.

815
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,200
Don’t just look at it. 
Learn to repair it.

816
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,000
Yes, madam. 
I will do it.

817
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,620
Hey! what are you doing?

818
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,040
I am removing my shoes.

819
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,120
Don’t... Your socks stink.

820
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,200
Come.

821
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,870
[Song humming]

822
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,410
Don’t be tensed.

823
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,330
There is no chance he would come into the bathroom.

824
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,830
Fine, he won’t come in. 
What if she enters?

825
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,870
Then, we will think of a way to deal with it.

826
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,660
Deal with what? Her?

827
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:28,330
Cheap fellow!

828
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,500
Isn’t grandma around?

829
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,750
Why do you care?

830
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,370
I was just making conversation.

831
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,950
Just look into your job.

832
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,450
This is the one, right?

833
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,250
Why are you acting like it’s your first time here?

834
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,290
Correct, madam.

835
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,080
He is coming into the bathroom.

836
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,450
There are so many rooms in the house. 
Why should he come to the bathroom only?

837
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,700
By the time he reaches the bathroom door, 
Just lock the bathroom from inside.

838
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,540
Go. Go.

839
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,080
Hello…

840
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,080
He looks to be the jack of all trades.

841
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,000
He put it here, alright. 
How is he going to take it?

842
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,910
He looks quite harmless 
but is quite cunning.

843
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,540
Then that means 
When he got in,

844
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,040
the camera must have recorded that, right?

845
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,950
Yes.

846
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,830
Is it done?

847
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,290
Yes, it’s done.

848
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,160
Is it working?

849
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,200
Yes. It’s working very well.

850
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,290
He means the camera.

851
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,790
That is what you say but within two days, 
the shower doesn’t work again.

852
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,450
If it doesn’t work. 
I will come back here again madam.

853
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,790
Yes, to change the SD card.

854
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,500
Alright.. Go.

855
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:24,750
Ok, madam.

856
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,250
Bloody pervert!

857
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,370
Yes.

858
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,660
You are saved because the card 
accidentally fell into the toilet.

859
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,870
(Singing a nursery rhyme) 
What are you guys doing?

860
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,540
We are thinking about him 
and he in turn is thinking about the girl.

861
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,750
He is very great.

862
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,410
(Singing a nursery rhyme)

863
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,290
Yes.

864
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,830
I just got out of the shower.

865
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:07,790
Oh no!

866
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,160
You know that I have to bathe two times a day.

867
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,040
Just like us.

868
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,200
Ok, baby.

869
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,040
Got to go.

870
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,120
Bye. Love you.

871
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,200
I wonder what that old lady is up to.

872
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,830
Grandma…

873
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,160
Grandma…

874
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,830
Are you a sleep?

875
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,950
That means I can go out.

876
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,700
January… February… March… April…

877
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,080
Oh good... You are back. 
Looks like that girl left.

878
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,290
Just take your bag, hurry up and leave.

879
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,160
Did you take the covers?

880
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,950
Buddy, don’t touch anything with your fingers.

881
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,750
Pull… Pull…

882
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,790
…do something 
Hurry up and pull…

883
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:12,830
Oh my god! 
You pathetic person!

884
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:14,200
That’s it. 
Over... Everything’s over...

885
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,540
You cannot ever get out of here.

886
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,160
What's your situation now?

887
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,660
This shitty life. 
-Hey..silence.

888
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,160
Give either of us a call.

889
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,410
Yes... Call… call…call.

890
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,000
Hello… 
-Hello… I am Babu.

891
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,200
I thought my father. 
Tell me.

892
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Where are you? 
-I can’t hear you well.

893
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,080
Where are you?!

894
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,580
I am driving.

895
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,790
Come to Jubilee Hills immediately.

896
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:47,080
Banjara Hills? 
All my deliveries are in Jubilee Hills.

897
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,700
Listen to me properly.

898
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,330
Hello…

899
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,700
If you want me to listen carefully 
I must be able to hear it properly.

900
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,620
Stop the vehicle and listen to me.

901
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,290
Not necessary. 
They stopped me.

902
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:55,580
Hi, sir.

903
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,790
Call me immediately.

904
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,370
Hey...

905
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,910
Put a message in our WhatsApp group.

906
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,700
Some one or the other will come.

907
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,620
Thunder guys! Thunder guys!

908
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,000
Damn! connect... connect..

909
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:45,200
(Message) [I am stuck in flat no.401, Mansion heights, 
Jubilee Hills with one old dead lady]

910
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,330
[One of you come fast and open the door.]

911
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,450
Come. Come…

912
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:57,250
Let’s go.

913
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,950
Can you give me a glass of water?

914
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,370
The kitchen is that way.

915
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,200
Khichdi is there as well. 
Do you want to have some?

916
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,370
Give me some water. 
-Okay.

917
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,080
They look like they are going to get 
really crazy in the bedroom.

918
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,910
You go to the grandma’s room.

919
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,040
Is this the room?

920
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,160
Hey… take it off you…take it off you. 
-I will... Don’t crumple it.

921
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,370
Disgusting!

922
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,120
Do we have to watch their romance?

923
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,120
Then close your eyes.

924
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Then, shut your mouth.

925
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,540
After all this, he opened a packet of curry powder.

926
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:42,870
It’s not curry powder.

927
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,040
It’s 'Veedaku' packet.

928
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,200
It’s his packet of leaves. 
I never said it was my packet of leaves.

929
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:47,750
'Veedaku' means Marijuana.

930
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,620
Marijuana?

931
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,830
Does that mean they are going to enjoy themselves?

932
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,160
What is this? Do we have to mix it in 
water like saffron stalks and drink it?

933
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,250
Saffron stalks are mixed in milk and consumed.

934
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,910
Oh dear! We don’t have milk at home.

935
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,750
Shh...

936
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:57,750
You...

937
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,580
What is this? Why are you crushing them?

938
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,330
Do we have to put them under teeth like tobacco? 
-Put in under your body!

939
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,950
Hurry up and put it somewhere or the other.

940
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,870
Tissue paper?

941
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,950
She wants to know everything.

942
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:15,950
Control yourself please.

943
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,160
Do I have to inhale it or blow on it?

944
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,330
You have to swallow it.

945
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,120
Hey. Take a drag and exhale.

946
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,580
Do you have a lighter?

947
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,330
Do I have to get everything?

948
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,500
Not so loud. 
Grandma might wake up.

949
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,450
She won’t get up.

950
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:38,830
Why?

951
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,000
I mixed the powder you gave me in 
a bottle of water and gave it to her.

952
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,580
She is completely knocked.

953
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,830
Have you gone mad? 
What if she accidentally dies?

954
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,290
She is already dead.

955
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,870
If she dies. She dies.

956
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:51,540
Damn!

957
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:52,790
What happened?

958
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,080
He drank from the same bottle, 
the grandmother drank from.

959
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,910
It must be because of the drugs in the water...

960
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,410
Reaction started in his mind 
and that’s why he is thinking we appeared here.

961
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,540
Oh, is that why he’s become so sharp-minded?

962
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,200
I am getting high.

963
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,870
You are not the one getting high. 
He is the one who is getting high.

964
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,410
It’s really nice. 
-My fate.

965
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,160
Buddy, don’t fall asleep.

966
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,160
You sleep like a log anyways.

967
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,200
But now, if you sleep because of these drugs, 
you will surely never wake up.

968
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,120
Please don’t sleep.

969
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,700
Babu…

970
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,120
Where have you been? 
-I have been trying to reach you.

971
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,830
Where are you?

972
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I am outside the apartment.

973
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,200
Stay right there. 
-I am right there.

974
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,160
You...

975
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,540
What happened? 
You were joking with me, right?

976
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:02,040
Hey, Babu! 
Babu…

977
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:15,660
Little Bheem… Little Bheem

978
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,330
Babu, what happened?

979
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,450
I am talking to you.

980
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,200
What happened? 
Why are you behaving this way?

981
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,660
Why is he packing?

982
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,950
Oh my tumbler!

983
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,700
Did the boss say something?

984
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,870
If he did say something, tell me. 
-I will take care of it.

985
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:25,500
Shut it!

986
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,370
Tell me what happened?

987
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,700
Babu… tell me what happened? 
-It’s all your fault.

988
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,410
You, dumb!

989
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,830
Bag… Bag… 
Where is the bag?

990
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,950
Bag…? 
Where is the bag?

991
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:02,950
Here…

992
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,750
I asked you to pocket only a single note of money 
Why did you get so many bundles of them?

993
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,700
Where did you get so much money from?

994
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,160
Babu….

995
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,250
I know that you are at home. 
Come out.

996
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,040
Come out.

997
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,620
You can’t escape.

998
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,830
Come out.

999
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,250
Babu, you cannot escape.

1000
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,120
Who is it?

1001
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,500
Babu..

1002
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,370
Police.

1003
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,950
Where is Babu?

1004
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,870
I think I’ve heard this voice somewhere.

1005
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,750
Hey, Yesu. 
You are at home as well?

1006
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,500
Sheshu? 
What’s up man?

1007
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,790
What’s with this look? 
What movie is this from?

1008
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,040
Take a guess.

1009
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,450
Gauthami Putra Shatakarni?

1010
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,160
That is a periodic movie.

1011
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,500
Oh? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. 
Give me another chance.

1012
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,500
Head constable Venkata Ramaiah?

1013
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,410
Khaidi No. 150?

1014
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,620
Yes. Boss is back.

1015
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:37,620
Wow.

1016
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:38,910
Is it a big role?

1017
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:39,870
Yes.

1018
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:41,160
I play a 60-year-old man.

1019
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,500
So, what do you do?

1020
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,910
Hmm… So, I stand like this. 
Put it here and ….

1021
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,410
Sheshu… Sheshu… 
-This is the role.

1022
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,290
How much longer will you take up these kinds of roles? 
When will you become a hero?

1023
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,950
Me? A hero? 
You are going overboard.

1024
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:59,200
I asked you to reprimand them. 
Why are you indulging in a conversation?

1025
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,410
Babu, If this repeats, 
I am going to (Cheeresta) thrash you.

1026
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,700
We will dress accordingly by wearing pants.

1027
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,620
Wear a saree… wear a pant.

1028
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,290
Wear a saree… wear a pant.

1029
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,620
You are brilliant, Yesu. 
Brilliant.

1030
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,910
Husband. 
-I am coming.

1031
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,250
Yesu, just thrash lightly.

1032
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,120
The boy is all swollen up. 
And my wife is making a mess.

1033
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:18,870
Alright. Alright.

1034
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:19,660
Alright, fine. 
-Go away.

1035
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,870
It’s time for my shoot. 
I will meet you tomorrow.

1036
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,500
Ok

1037
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:24,290
Alright. Go away.

1038
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,750
Twisted fellow! 
-Be careful!

1039
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,160
Don’t blame me later.

1040
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,950
What exactly happened?

1041
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,870
How come you resorted to robbing?

1042
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,750
Two people are dead there 
and how come you are asking this kind of question.

1043
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,290
Anyways, it’s not called robbery. 
It’s called pocketing.

1044
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:45,290
Bloody Idiot! 
Shut up!

1045
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:45,910
Okay.

1046
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,200
How did you come from the bedroom into the hall?

1047
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,080
I don’t know.

1048
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,700
Whose is the second dead body?

1049
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,450
I don’t know.

1050
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,290
When I woke up, it was next to me.

1051
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,950
How could you sleep with all that stress?

1052
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:56,750
You idiot!

1053
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,830
How many times do I have to tell you?

1054
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,000
Something was mixed in the water. 
So, I was drugged.

1055
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,870
So, what should we do now?

1056
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,620
What else?

1057
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,870
Take these 50 lakhs and run away.

1058
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:04,910
Have you gone mad?

1059
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,910
It’s 50 lakhs buddy. 
We could all settle down comfortably.

1060
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,000
It’s 50 lakhs here. Not 50 crores. 
How long can you survive on 50 lakhs?

1061
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,580
Even if we spend a lakh a month, 
we could live happily for three years.

1062
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,200
And after that? 
What will you do after that?

1063
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,120
I have no clarity over what to do now 
and you ask me questions regarding three years later.

1064
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,790
Babu, this is what he will keep on telling you. 
Listen to me once this time.

1065
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,700
It’s because I listened to you. 
All of this happened.

1066
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,410
So, what will you do now?

1067
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,120
You have three problems right now.

1068
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,040
One is camera.

1069
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,790
Second is the bag,

1070
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:30,500
Third is the bike.

1071
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,660
Oh my! I forgot about the bike.

1072
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,660
That’s not at all a big problem. 
If you have the key, you can bring it.

1073
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,080
The main thing that we require 
is that camera footage, and delivery packages.

1074
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,830
If either of them gets into the hands of the police 
you will surely be caught.

1075
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,620
If there is a camera in front of that house, 
everything would be recorded in it.

1076
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,370
So, the first thing we need to do is 
get that footage.

1077
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,080
If this bag is here,

1078
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,080
your delivery packages must be somewhere there.

1079
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,660
You must get your packages from there.

1080
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,790
And once you do that, there will be no evidence 
that you were ever at the crime scene.

1081
01:04:58,790 --> 01:04:59,750
No one will doubt you.

1082
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:00,870
We can get out of this mess.

1083
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:01,500
Is it?

1084
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:04,330
Do you think it’s that easy? 
This is not some English serial that you watch.

1085
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,410
You must first give your details to the security guy there, 
sign the register and then you are allowed into the apartments.

1086
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,580
Even if you manage to spew some nonsense to that security guy, 
do you think you can ring the apartment’s bell...

1087
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,620
pick up your packages and the camera footage?

1088
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,370
There are already two dead bodies there.

1089
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,870
And as far I can tell, that place must be crawling 
with both police and the people.

1090
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,620
If we go into the apartments, 
we will surely be caught.

1091
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,080
If he follows my plan, he will just be a suspect. 
If he follows your plan, he will be a convict.

1092
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,200
If he proceeds with your plan, he will be caught right away. 
And if he follows my plan, he can escape happily.

1093
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,580
Is running away the solution to everything?

1094
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,040
Is getting caught the solution for everything?

1095
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,620
Why do you keep insisting that he would get caught?

1096
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,410
If he gets his packages and the footage, 
how will he get caught?

1097
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,660
This isn’t as easy as getting curries from a curry point.

1098
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,950
Don’t make illogical arguments.

1099
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,620
Do you want me to come up with 
twisted solutions like yours.

1100
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,830
Babu, listen to me.

1101
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:41,950
He will never listen to you.

1102
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:43,500
It’s because he listened to you, 
there are two people dead.

1103
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,540
You! If you talk too much, 
you will die too.

1104
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:46,500
Remove your hand.

1105
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,700
I won’t. 
What will you do?

1106
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,910
I will break your spine. 
I will break your...

1107
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,200
I will go to the police station.

1108
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,290
What will you say at the police station?

1109
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,700
I am going to tell them everything that has happened.

1110
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,120
What do you think they would do 
when you tell them all that?

1111
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,200
What will they do?

1112
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,750
Speak out...come on speak out.. 
-I don’t know anything.

1113
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,830
Sir… I am innocent.

1114
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,580
Why would they hit me if he is the culprit?

1115
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,660
You are the one who gave him the idea, right?

1116
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,250
Babu, please don’t do that. 
I beg you.

1117
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,120
What do you want me to do?

1118
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,080
We can’t do what he suggests 
and I can’t do what you suggest either.

1119
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,080
You said the same thing yesterday 
and did it today anyway.

1120
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,750
This is the same thing.

1121
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,950
You! 
-Hey! Stop it!

1122
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,500
[Mobile Ringing]

1123
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,370
What’s wrong now?

1124
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:07,080
The second dead body belongs to 
the police officer who came for verification.

1125
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,200
What are you talking?

1126
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,040
How did he go there?

1127
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,700
Even if he did go there, 
how did he die?

1128
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,450
Buddy… 
We don’t have a lot of time.

1129
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,700
Before they begin the search for the constable, 
we should do something.

1130
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,790
So, listen to me. 
Let’s take this money and run away somewhere.

1131
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:24,620
Even if you run away,

1132
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,160
Where are you going to go and how are you going to live?

1133
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,290
That is why I suggested we run away with the money.

1134
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,620
You are right.

1135
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,950
Thank god. 
Finally, you understood.

1136
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,370
Let’s go and get those packages and the footage.

1137
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,950
Listen to me guys.

1138
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:38,700
If we go now, we will get caught.

1139
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,450
We are going. 
Will you come with us or not?

1140
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,330
I get the feeling that we are on a final journey.

1141
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,750
I wonder if there is any petrol or not.

1142
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,620
That’s not necessary. 
Let’s go in a car.

1143
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,120
Car? Where did you get a car from?

1144
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:53,790
It’s a friend’s car.

1145
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,160
You mean you have friends who own a car?

1146
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,580
Not everyone is like you. 
Let’s go.

1147
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,000
Where is the money? 
-Why do you need the money?

1148
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,120
I don’t need that kind of money.

1149
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:00,950
I want that money.

1150
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,330
Come lick an armpit! 
-If I did, will you give me the money?

1151
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,200
Just go and get the money!

1152
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,700
Okay.

1153
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,040
Man must trust.

1154
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,200
Who called you a man?

1155
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:12,620
Let’s go.

1156
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:13,950
Didn’t you hear him? Let’s go.

1157
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,700
How are we going to get in?

1158
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,870
Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I am talking to you.

1159
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,790
Go and sit in the back. 
-No, I won’t.

1160
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,410
Does that expression mean that 
I should be scared and get in the back seat?

1161
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:36,790
I will sit in the back.

1162
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,540
Make sure you hide yourself well.

1163
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,370
Why?

1164
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:44,120
It’s better if people think there is only a single 
person in the car rather than three people.

1165
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,950
Why?

1166
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
To make sure even if you get caught, 
we can escape unscathed.

1167
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,000
How can you go in without signing in? 
I am talking to you.

1168
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,580
What are you doing? 
-Are you trying to hit the wall?

1169
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:19,580
Oh mom!

1170
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,750
How did you get in without signing?

1171
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,330
They would ask the visitors to sign 
not the residents.

1172
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,500
I didn't get it.

1173
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,700
It’s human psychology.

1174
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,410
Only the people who don’t live in this apartment, 
slow down at the gate.

1175
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:31,540
So, the security stops them.

1176
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,290
If it’s a resident, 
they just honk and speed up to get in.

1177
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,700
Security doesn’t stop them.

1178
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,370
If they did stop you and asked you to sign?

1179
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,500
I would have spewed some nonsense 
and signed and rushed off.

1180
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:42,370
Let’s go.

1181
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,410
What about me?

1182
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,910
Is that the flat? 
-Yes.

1183
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,700
How come there is no commotion around it?

1184
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,580
I was wondering the same thing.

1185
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,410
That means nobody knows that 
there are dead bodies inside.

1186
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,160
Shall we go?

1187
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,580
Hey... 
-What man?

1188
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,500
Where is the camera?

1189
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,950
Buddy, tell me the truth.

1190
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,660
You didn’t dream this up, right?

1191
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,540
I saw the camera.

1192
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,870
Yeah and I am asking you if you saw it in a dream?

1193
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:35,660
Dream?

1194
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,080
Would they ever listen to us if we told them?[Phone Talk]

1195
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,500
It’s up to them.

1196
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,120
Goodness! This generation people 
do not listen to persons like us.

1197
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,080
Who is she?

1198
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,200
How is she talking on the phone 
when there are two dead bodies inside?

1199
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,040
Hey! 
What happened?

1200
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,790
What?

1201
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,330
That is the grandmother. 
-You said that the grandmother was dead.

1202
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,370
How is the dead person come alive?

1203
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:04,290
I am asking you.

1204
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,000
What do I know? 
-So, what do you know?!

1205
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:08,450
How did you know that the grandmother was dead?

1206
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,330
Did you check her pulse?

1207
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:10,750
No.

1208
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,620
I placed two fingers beneath her nostrils. 
-You should have put it inside her nostrils!

1209
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,160
Where is the constable’s body?

1210
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,450
It’s in the hall.

1211
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,290
Why would she move around this freely 
with a dead body in the hall?

1212
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,450
To figure that out, we need to go in.

1213
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,160
Goodness, inside? 
No, I won’t go in.

1214
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,370
Do you think they would listen to us 
just because we tell them? [Phone Talk]

1215
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,250
They are educated, right?

1216
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,830
What’s the worst that could happen if they 
listened a bit to elder’s advice?

1217
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,540
We only advise them so that they would 
improve their lives.

1218
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,040
Why did you kick that flower vessel?[On Tv]

1219
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:57,200
Just calm down grandma. 
They say such things. [Phone Talk]

1220
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,870
But they never ever think to pay attention to 
what the elders say because of their experience.

1221
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:02,870
What happened?

1222
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,040
What happened?

1223
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,660
There is no dead body in the hall.

1224
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,910
Babu, just close your eyes 
and recollect everything that happened.

1225
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:31,790
What are you looking at?

1226
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,450
I kicked a flower vase.

1227
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,290
What?

1228
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:35,910
I kicked a flower vase.

1229
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,830
Babu, Mahesh Babu kicked it.

1230
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:42,000
After I spoke to you and put the phone down, 
I accidentally knocked off the flower vase.

1231
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,040
If so, where is the flower vase?

1232
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,250
Well, quite simply, as usual it will not be there.

1233
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:49,700
Babu, just admit the truth at least now. 
You must have dreamt all of this.

1234
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:52,160
If I did dream of it, 
how could that bag of money be real?

1235
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,370
Oh Damn! Damn! 
Holy crap!

1236
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,830
Damn! Yes!

1237
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:00,540
Babu…

1238
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,200
That is what I don’t understand.[Phone Talk]

1239
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:07,000
How...?

1240
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,500
I came from this flat.

1241
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,000
If you slept in the flat below, 
How could you come out of this flat?

1242
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,870
I don’t know. 
I am sure that I came out of this flat.

1243
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:31,830
Let’s go, then.

1244
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,410
How can we go in if it’s locked?

1245
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:34,830
Like this

1246
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,620
What is it?

1247
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,660
This is called an all-purpose knife. 
If we don’t have an opener to open the beer bottle…

1248
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,750
Just open the door.

1249
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:40,870
Okay.

1250
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,080
Hurry. Hurry.

1251
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,200
Do you think this is an all-purpose key?

1252
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,540
all-purpose key knife

1253
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,540
Get up. Move aside.

1254
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,500
Not here... Just go and stand there 
and watch if anyone is coming.

1255
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,700
Careful with the knife.

1256
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,250
Is it done?

1257
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,870
Looks like someone’s heading this way.

1258
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,500
Hurry up and open it. Hurry... 
Someone’s coming.

1259
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,540
They are coming... They are coming.

1260
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,250
Come in. 
-Oh, it’s done?

1261
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:19,950
Did I not tell you?

1262
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,250
Didn’t I?

1263
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,200
Here. There is the dead body.

1264
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,200
Yes.

1265
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:24,700
Yes.

1266
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:27,620
You are the only person that I have seen 
who is happy looking at a dead body.

1267
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,410
Is he constable Banerjee?

1268
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,290
He looks like Brahmaji from behind.

1269
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:36,790
Don’t touch anything unnecessarily 
We would leave our finger prints.

1270
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,660
Two hands?

1271
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,910
How is it ok if only you wear them? 
What about us?

1272
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:49,910
Don’t you have another pair?

1273
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,120
Do I look like a salesman?

1274
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,000
So, who should wear it now?

1275
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,250
Both of you wear one each.

1276
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,040
What I mean is…

1277
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,250
Whose house is this?

1278
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,290
What business does this constable have here?

1279
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:06,370
In the morning, I heard the constable saying he needs 
to go to Tejaswi’s house for passport verification.

1280
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,620
This must be the house.

1281
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,830
How do you think he died?

1282
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:11,700
That is not important. 
The pertinent question is how did he get here.

1283
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:14,160
If we take a look at the camera footage, 
we could find out.

1284
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:17,080
Just remember we are here to get your stuff.

1285
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:17,580
Hey...

1286
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,330
Just look around that side 
I will take this side.

1287
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,080
What should I see? 
-Look at his face.

1288
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,700
Oh my!

1289
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,330
Mirror.

1290
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:47,870
My Image in the mirror.

1291
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:57,950
What room is this?

1292
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:03,450
Disgusting... It's a bathroom.

1293
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,290
What happened?

1294
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,700
Why do you put a face like a scare crow? 
What happened?

1295
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:42,000
There is something here.

1296
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,910
Dumb fellow!

1297
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,160
I told you not to touch anything, right? 
What is all this?

1298
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,250
I didn’t knock any of this down? 
The shelf did it.

1299
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,200
What do you mean the shelf did it? 
-I am telling you the truth.

1300
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,830
If you don’t believe me, take a look.

1301
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,450
Who are you?

1302
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,250
I am getting scared.

1303
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,620
I have been hearing those sounds 
for quite some time now.

1304
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,330
This is a door?

1305
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:15,290
Buddy, let’s get out of here.

1306
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,250
Why would you go in when I am suggesting that we get out?

1307
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,120
Stop, buddy.

1308
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,700
There must be a spirit trapped inside. 
Let’s get out of here.

1309
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,410
Shut it!

1310
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,830
There will always be someone like you 
in every movie.

1311
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:33,870
Open it.

1312
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:18,870
What is this?

1313
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,910
He looks like a nature lover.

1314
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,410
He is growing plants in his house.

1315
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,250
Is this rice or not?

1316
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,000
Don’t meddle.

1317
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:51,450
What plant is this? 
Holy Basil?

1318
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:52,450
No. It’s Marijuana.

1319
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,330
What?

1320
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,080
Someone has put up a big set up here.

1321
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:00,120
My packages.

1322
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:00,750
Really?

1323
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,200
What happened?

1324
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:04,580
Rat.

1325
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,000
Rat.

1326
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,290
I was scared for nothing... Rat.

1327
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,620
Our father in heaven.

1328
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,500
I am in 501. 
Who followed the heart by the name.

1329
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,660
Save me superman.

1330
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,410
Save me.

1331
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:19,330
I know Jackie chan.

1332
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,500
Madam… Madam…. 
-Who is she?

1333
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:31,580
She is Tejaswi.

1334
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,950
Did the constable come for her?

1335
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,910
Madam… Madam… 
-Is she alive or not?

1336
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,250
Just move.

1337
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,370
What are you doing?

1338
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,200
If we do this, she will cough and regain her consciousness.

1339
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:51,870
I saw it yesterday in Ftv.

1340
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,250
Just check her pulse.

1341
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:54,540
Ok.

1342
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:03,660
What happened?

1343
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:05,540
I can’t seem to figure out. 
-Just move.

1344
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:09,950
Is she alive or dead? 
Is she dead or alive?

1345
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,040
Is she dead? 
-Shhh...!

1346
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,200
She is alive.

1347
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,080
This seems to be a very big racket.

1348
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,620
Slowly, we are getting stuck into this mess.

1349
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:20,910
Listen to me please.

1350
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,750
Let’s just go away from here.

1351
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,410
You mean we should leave her here?

1352
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,000
The constable there is dead

1353
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,500
and this girl here looks to be on the way to join him. 
Do we need to be in this mess?

1354
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,290
Let’s just get out of here. 
-Let’s go.

1355
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:33,080
That constable who died came for passport verification.

1356
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,660
And, she is here.

1357
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:44,870
Tejaswi’s flat number is 503.

1358
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,250
This is 501.

1359
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:47,540
That means this flat isn’t hers.

1360
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,700
So, who does this flat belong to?

1361
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:53,080
I ordered it a week ago. 
Ravi, apartment number 501.

1362
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,160
When will it arrive?

1363
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,080
This is Ravi’s flat.

1364
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,200
Everything he only has done.

1365
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,200
When I saw his face, 
I suspected him right away.

1366
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,160
Who is Ravi?

1367
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,750
He is the one who smoked marijuana with 
that girl Bujji.

1368
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:08,370
If so, why is she here?

1369
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,700
She must have seen Ravi killing the constable.

1370
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,120
So, why did he trap you in this mess?

1371
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,870
When he was smoking up with Bujji, 
he must have seen him.

1372
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,790
Ravi must have got him here, to make it look like 
Babu killed the constable.

1373
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,000
Ravi thought that he could escape.

1374
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,540
So, why didn’t he kill her then?

1375
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:21,830
He didn’t.

1376
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:25,700
As soon as I escaped from here, 
he must have planned something else.

1377
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:27,790
He will definitely return.

1378
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,790
So, let’s get out of here before he returns.

1379
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:32,830
What happened?

1380
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,700
Water

1381
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,290
What happened?

1382
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,660
Who is this?

1383
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:51,120
Ravi.

1384
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,620
Ravi?

1385
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,000
We thought he would be the one to come here.

1386
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,200
Before someone else comes here, 
Let’s get out of here.

1387
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:01,660
I am talking to you.

1388
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,540
Did you find the camera footage?

1389
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,200
There isn’t a single computer here.

1390
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,910
To my knowledge, the camera must not have been working.

1391
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,790
Camera footage isn’t here.

1392
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:10,500
And we found our packages. 
Let’s just get out of here.

1393
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,950
How can we leave without knowing what went on here? 
-What will you do even if you figure it out?

1394
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,200
Buddy, the situation is getting very complicated.

1395
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,410
We are looking for ways to solve and unwillingly 
getting ourselves involved further into this mess.

1396
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:20,540
This entire set up looks like there is a big gang behind it.

1397
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,830
Kill two and put the blame on the both of you….

1398
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:23,450
You stay here.

1399
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,370
If that girl regains her consciousness, 
find out what happened.

1400
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,370
You come with me.

1401
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,450
Where are you guys going?

1402
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:28,250
Just stay here.

1403
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:29,410
Stay here.

1404
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,090
Where are you going?

1405
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:39,420
To the watchman. 
-Why?

1406
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:41,170
To see the footage. 
-What footage?

1407
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,750
When I hid in the bathroom, he fixed a camera in there.

1408
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,710
Security camera?

1409
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:46,920
Who fixes a security camera in the bathroom?

1410
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:47,500
It’s a spy camera.

1411
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,840
Spy camera? For what?

1412
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:49,840
To watch that girl Bujji.

1413
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:51,630
What would you do looking at the girl?

1414
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,050
I took the spy camera from the bathroom 
and put it in my pocket.

1415
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:55,300
So, take it out.

1416
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,500
When I was high, I mistook the spy camera 
for the phone and took it out.

1417
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,550
Then, let’s go to the watchman’s room.

1418
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,340
Show me the footage of the camera that 
you fixed in Bujji’s bathroom?

1419
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:08,500
What camera?

1420
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,750
What footage? 
Who is this girl Bujji?

1421
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,090
What are you doing here since morning?

1422
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,000
Have you been giving the three deliveries till now?

1423
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,550
Who is he?

1424
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:19,090
He looks like a devil’s child.

1425
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:20,090
What are you looking at?

1426
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,050
And what have you two been 
doing here since morning?

1427
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:27,130
If the camera is there, 
How can I show the footage here, sir?

1428
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,300
Isn't that a live video?

1429
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,420
No, sir. It only works with a memory card, sir.

1430
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,500
And the memory card needs 
to be changed every two days.

1431
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,710
If we need to see the footage, 
How can we?

1432
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,340
I will change the memory card the day after tomorrow.

1433
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,590
You can take it then.

1434
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,840
Is there no other way?

1435
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,210
To the outside? 
You can go from here.

1436
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,800
Shall I tell her that the plumber is here 
and then get the memory card?

1437
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,920
Cute boy.

1438
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,170
Let’s go.

1439
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,960
That old lady might recognise you.

1440
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,090
Why did you come at this time?

1441
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:58,340
The shower? 
-You checked it this morning, right?

1442
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:01,750
I got the plumber. 
Just in case there is a problem.

1443
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,300
Why is the plumber here at this time?

1444
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,590
You could have gotten him tomorrow morning, right?

1445
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:06,090
Well, he was free so….

1446
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:07,130
Shouldn’t we be free?

1447
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,090
Dumb girl!

1448
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:08,880
What is he saying?

1449
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,210
We won’t take too long, madam.

1450
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,130
Alright, fine. Get in. 
-Ok.

1451
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:14,000
Let’s go.

1452
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,840
Grandma, have you eaten?

1453
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,340
No dear. 
I was waiting for you.

1454
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,050
Ah Grandma, 
You joke way too much!

1455
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:23,460
Really. It’s true.

1456
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:28,050
Listen, there are vegetables on the dining table 
could you please chop them up?

1457
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,460
Go away.

1458
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,000
Who are these people?

1459
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,130
They are plumbers. 
They are here to repair the shower.

1460
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:35,380
Oh..!

1461
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,170
Where is the room?

1462
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,170
You? Come here.

1463
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:38,960
Me, Grandma?

1464
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,500
Not you fool! 
Tell him to come here.

1465
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,090
She asking you.

1466
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,380
Just manage is somehow.

1467
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,460
Come here. 
-Hello…

1468
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,710
You…

1469
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,090
You… You…

1470
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,210
Oh my god! We’ve been caught.

1471
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:56,250
Ah yes! You played the character of the 
son in the TV serial ‘Oh my son!’ Didn’t you?

1472
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,420
Thank god!

1473
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:00,840
Yes. You are. You are.

1474
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:05,050
Why do you keep torturing your wife like that?

1475
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,130
You Idiot.

1476
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:08,550
Ok.

1477
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,000
It’s done grandma.

1478
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:17,130
This is in the shower 
that is why it wasn’t working.

1479
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,130
This was in the flower pot 
that’s why he has been coming.

1480
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:21,130
Woman is not a property in the shop.

1481
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,050
Why should this video ? 
Just forward it.

1482
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:54,090
He put you in the delivery bag 
and took you upstairs.

1483
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,210
It’s not a new application. 
I have already applied.

1484
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,710
Number? 
One second

1485
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,300
Wait a second. 
I’ll tell you.

1486
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,460
I tried tracking it online. 
-Let's go.

1487
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:13,880
Just wait.

1488
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,460
But the server might be down. 
It’s not coming up.

1489
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,170
Name?

1490
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,840
Tejaswi Thota

1491
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:27,460
T - E - J - A - S - W - I

1492
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,800
Tejaswi Thota.

1493
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:34,550
Flat number 503 
Mansion Heights, Jubilee Hills.

1494
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,920
The police verification has been carried out this morning.

1495
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:43,460
Sir, I need this passport immediately. 
When will I get it?

1496
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,920
Please make sure it’s done immediately.

1497
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,130
Please take a look.

1498
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:47,880
Thank you.

1499
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,590
If he is Tejaswi, who is that girl?

1500
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,630
Who are you guys?

1501
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,300
Who are you?

1502
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,800
Why are you trying to kill me?

1503
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,250
Why are you trying to kill him?

1504
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,920
Please don’t hurt him. Let him go.

1505
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,210
Where is Ravi?

1506
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,170
Here.

1507
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,340
Why did you kill him?

1508
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,500
You killed him and then trying to blame us?

1509
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,050
What do you mean I killed him?

1510
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,460
Who are you guys?

1511
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,880
Why did you tie me up?

1512
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:36,380
Speak.

1513
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,130
I am talking to you.

1514
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:40,960
Who are you?

1515
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:43,250
Can’t you hear me? 
I am talking to you!

1516
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,630
If only I had gone to my village…

1517
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,170
You freaking faggot!

1518
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,420
What are you looking at?

1519
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:49,300
You filthy scum bag.

1520
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,920
You bloody...

1521
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,460
Shut up!

1522
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,960
I don’t have the patience to persuade you.

1523
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:01,840
I am already very irritated.

1524
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:05,800
Shut up and only answer my questions.

1525
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,250
Who killed Ravi and the constable?

1526
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:11,750
Who tried to set me up?

1527
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,380
Who are you?

1528
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,050
Hey, you! 
-Buddy

1529
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:37,630
Don’t you understand what I am trying to explain?

1530
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:43,210
Tell me. 
Who are you?

1531
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:44,210
Tell me…

1532
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,300
I will tell you…

1533
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,130
You pathetic fool! 
-Why do you want to be beaten up?

1534
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:48,800
Speak.

1535
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:50,880
I will tell you… I will tell you…

1536
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:53,050
My name is Myra.

1537
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,000
And I deal with Meth.

1538
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,920
I am a drug dealer.

1539
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,840
A few months ago, 
I got acquainted with Ravi.

1540
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:04,840
He told me that he cooked drugs 
and that he was looking for a dealer.

1541
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,380
He gave me a sample.

1542
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,630
I liked his quality and gave him a small deal.

1543
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:15,460
My clients liked his quality too 
and so I started giving him bigger deals.

1544
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,090
In the beginning, he was on time with delivery.

1545
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,460
Later on he began to delay the deliveries.

1546
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:23,630
Last month, I finalised a very big deal.

1547
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,710
He took an advance and assured me that 
he would deliver the product in fifteen days.

1548
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:28,710
But even after a month, he didn’t deliver.

1549
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,920
And so, I came to meet him this morning.

1550
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,590
That is when I met you.

1551
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,630
Hey Myra.

1552
01:29:56,710 --> 01:29:57,920
How many times do I have to call you?

1553
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,340
when ever the package is ready 
I only would have given it to you.

1554
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:00,420
It’s not done yet?

1555
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,000
Just chill man. 
It’s almost done.

1556
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,420
Almost? Almost?

1557
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,590
When did you say that you would deliver? 
It’s already been delayed by over fifteen days.

1558
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:06,750
Just fifteen days, right?

1559
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,170
Of course, that won’t matter to you. 
I am your only client.

1560
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,460
But for me, there are a lot of clients.

1561
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:11,590
Don’t start again.

1562
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:12,750
Do you want a joint?

1563
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,880
I want my package.

1564
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,050
The last batch is being cooked. 
When it’s done, I’ll only give it to you.

1565
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,550
I’ll wait.

1566
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,550
Myra.

1567
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,170
I told you I will bring it to you.

1568
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:32,130
I lost all my faith in you. 
I will only leave after picking up my package.

1569
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,750
Just because it got delayed once, 
do you have to react like this?

1570
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,250
In the beginning, you always gave on time.

1571
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,340
What happened to you now? 
Are you thinking no end of yourself.

1572
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:40,920
That’s not the case Myra.

1573
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,170
I was trying a new drug. 
That’s the reason why it’s been delayed.

1574
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:43,840
Cool.

1575
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:48,670
I gave you 80 lakhs and 
you considering me to be a fool... Is it?

1576
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:50,880
When did you give me 80 lakhs? 
You gave me 30 lakhs only.

1577
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:53,800
50 lakhs, huh? 
You want your 50 lakhs?

1578
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:55,590
I will give you.

1579
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,460
Wow.

1580
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:02,590
Take it.

1581
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,250
It looks you came here fully prepared.

1582
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,460
You know what? 
I am done with you.

1583
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:11,920
This is our last deal.

1584
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,750
Hey! Please. 
I am sorry, okay?

1585
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,880
I can’t take another chance with you. 
I am done.

1586
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,960
Give me my packages soon and 
I will leave immediately.

1587
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,380
I said it’s cooking right? 
-How long will that take?

1588
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:19,170
Ten.

1589
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:21,210
Ten hours.

1590
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:23,710
Ten hours?

1591
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,550
Of course, ten hours. 
Do you think its as easy as cooking rice?

1592
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:28,130
Like put it on the stove and 
take it off in 15 minutes.

1593
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,460
It’s meth. Do the math.

1594
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,420
Why would you want try the same old thing?

1595
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,000
This is my new drug.

1596
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:43,340
Wanna give it a go?

1597
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,750
Up to you.

1598
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,550
One second.

1599
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:06,550
You?

1600
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,630
What’s your name? 
-What’s yours?

1601
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,840
Do you live in this flat? 
-No. I pitched a tent outside and live there.

1602
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,250
How long have you been staying here?

1603
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,170
Why do you want?

1604
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,340
Have you gone mad?

1605
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,250
Not really.

1606
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:21,710
Do you know who I am?

1607
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,050
You already told me that you are not an uncle. 
You are a rascal.

1608
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,670
You are thinking no end of yourself.

1609
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:26,420
Kind of.

1610
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,550
Police.

1611
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:28,960
Oh, it’s an ID.

1612
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:31,630
S. Banerjee. 
Police cons...

1613
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,420
constable?

1614
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,630
So, why did you stop only with the word police? 
You should also mention that you are a constable.

1615
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:38,300
Can I come in?

1616
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,590
Do you have a warrant?

1617
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,840
For what? 
-To come inside.

1618
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:45,050
I came to the neighbouring flat for passport verification.

1619
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,250
If you sign as a witness, 
I will leave immediately.

1620
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:47,800
Okay?

1621
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:48,670
Give it here. I will sign it.

1622
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,090
You are going to sign it without 
knowing any details, is it?

1623
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:53,170
You told me just now that 
you are police constable Banerjee.

1624
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,800
Not about me. 
About this file.

1625
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,420
You told me just now it’s about my neighbours.

1626
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:57,750
Alright, fine. 
Let’s go inside.

1627
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,460
Let’s go in and talk. 
-I will sign it here.

1628
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,090
Move aside.

1629
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,420
Thank goodness.

1630
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:07,170
Sir?

1631
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:13,170
Name.

1632
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:13,960
Ravi

1633
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,210
Your full name? 
-Ravi Teja

1634
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,750
How long have been living here? 
-Ever since I bought the flat.

1635
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,380
From 6 months.

1636
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,630
What do you do?

1637
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
What will I do? 
If you leave, I will have my lunch.

1638
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,170
I am hungry.

1639
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,630
Do you know Tejaswi?

1640
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:31,590
I know, Sir.

1641
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:32,750
How do you know that person?

1642
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,590
Ever since that person moved into the flat beside mine.

1643
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:35,880
What else do you know about that person?

1644
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:40,840
She is a good person. 
Whenever we meet she greets me.

1645
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,130
When I get close, she hugs me.

1646
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,250
For every festival, she sends me sweet. 
That is all.

1647
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:45,670
Really?

1648
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:47,250
What else?

1649
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:51,210
If I say anything else, I will be called 
a pervert, perhaps even a stalker.

1650
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:59,170
If you knew that much about that person, 
didn’t you know that Tejaswi is a boy.

1651
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:02,210
Didn’t you say Tejaswi?

1652
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,130
Yes. Tejaswi Thota.

1653
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:05,670
Thota. 
Male.

1654
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,960
A guy.

1655
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,880
Without knowing who Tejaswi is.. 
Why did you lie that you knew Tejaswi?

1656
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,170
Well, I just thought it was one harmless signature 
and told you casually.

1657
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,960
You seem very twisted.

1658
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,300
No, sir. I am straight.

1659
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:19,880
No other flat here has a camera but your flat has one. 
Why?

1660
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,460
I put it up. 
-Why?

1661
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:23,420
Security. 
-Do you need that much security?

1662
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:27,170
Well, I like horror movies. 
That’s why I am cautious.

1663
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:27,880
That's why.

1664
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,960
Why are you rubbing your nose continuously?

1665
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:30,750
Do you have a cold?

1666
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:32,090
Dust allergy.

1667
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,050
Pollination.

1668
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:33,920
Pollution.

1669
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,000
Let me take a look.

1670
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,880
Why do you want to look into my nose? 
Disgusting!

1671
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:39,500
What’s that powder?

1672
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:42,750
I applied powder to the face. 
It must have gone into my nose.

1673
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:46,380
Do you think that I don’t know the difference between 
a face powder and the powder you sniff?

1674
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,090
May be.

1675
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,880
Is that what you think? 
-Why do you hit me?

1676
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:50,500
Sir!

1677
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:51,630
Why is this cocaine here?

1678
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,050
What does cocaine mean?

1679
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,630
Don't you know what cocaine means? 
-It’s a deodorant powder.

1680
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:57,340
So why are you putting it in your nose?

1681
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:00,750
What is this?

1682
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,250
Injection, sir.

1683
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:03,000
For what?

1684
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,460
I suffer from Insulin 
that is why I inject sugar.

1685
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,340
Do you take me for a fool? 
-No, sir.

1686
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,750
How much cocaine do you have?

1687
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,380
Do you just use it or do you supply it?

1688
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:16,050
Sir, what do you mean supply? 
When I am tensed I just use it sometimes…

1689
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,710
Take it out… Take it out.

1690
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,380
Sir, take this and please let me go. 
-Take it out.

1691
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,130
What? A hundred? 
-I only have that much on me.

1692
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:23,840
Do you think this is a traffic violation?

1693
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,840
Take it out... Take the cocaine out.

1694
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,170
Sir…Please… 
-Take it out.

1695
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:29,500
I only have this much sir.

1696
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:31,050
Oh goodness!

1697
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:33,880
Who is the supplier? 
That John fellow.

1698
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,210
Let’s not discuss all that sir. 
Let’s get down to business.

1699
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,460
Take this thousand and leave me alone, please.

1700
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,090
What will I get with a thousand?

1701
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:41,250
Ten beers at least.

1702
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:43,590
Do you know how serious this matter is...?

1703
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:47,630
What’s that sound?

1704
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:50,500
It’s from next door. 
-Not next door. Next room.

1705
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,090
Sir… Sir…

1706
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:52,380
Are you trying to tell me stories?

1707
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,800
Sir… Sir… 
-Someone’s there.

1708
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:54,800
Please stop, sir. Please.

1709
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,500
You are spinning stories. 
-Take this ten thousand, sir.

1710
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,840
Sir…Sir…

1711
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:00,300
What is this? 
-I am a book writer.

1712
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,050
Did you write all this?

1713
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,500
Sir… 
-Why is this out?

1714
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,210
Hey take off your hand 
-Plywood sir. Plywood.

1715
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:09,000
Sir… 
-What is this door?

1716
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,550
Sir, just… storage sir. 
Old stuff and all that.

1717
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:11,960
Is it!

1718
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,210
Let’s go and clean that. 
-Sir… it’s a bathroom. Water…

1719
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:16,170
Oh my god!

1720
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,710
What is this? 
-It’s a vegetable...

1721
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,710
Let’s talk while cutting them.

1722
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:23,300
Sir… it’s vegetables, right? So…

1723
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:25,170
Please, Sir.. sir...

1724
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:26,710
This is urea, sir 
And that is the soil there.

1725
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:28,590
If you plant the seeds in the soil, 
there you have the sprouts.

1726
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:30,550
It’s morning breakfast… gives protein.

1727
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:32,090
That's all, Sir.

1728
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:35,670
You have such a big drug set up here 
and you offer me 100 rupees.

1729
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:37,960
Sir. I said a hundred first. 
Right after that, I said ten thousand.

1730
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,050
This isn’t something that 
can be solved with thousands.

1731
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:41,630
Oh my goodness!

1732
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,090
You want to do business without informing us.

1733
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,710
Is this a legal business to inform you and do, Sir.

1734
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:48,000
Please tell me how much do you want? 
Let’s sit down and have a chat.

1735
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:49,500
Sir!

1736
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:52,250
As soon as I saw you, I had my doubts.

1737
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:54,960
You and your attire.

1738
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:56,750
How dare you?

1739
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,960
You dare call me uncle?

1740
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:01,550
Sir… I was high. 
And I didn’t know what I was saying.

1741
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:02,250
I am sorry, sir.

1742
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:04,880
Who is your dealer? 
-Some Tom, dick and Harry.

1743
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,880
Who is it?

1744
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:14,550
"Every night in my dreams 
I see you; I feel you."

1745
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:15,170
Who is this?

1746
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:17,420
"I feel you…"

1747
01:37:18,210 --> 01:37:26,050
"Every night in my dreams 
I see you; I feel you."

1748
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:28,210
Who is this? 
You told me that there was no one here.

1749
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:29,170
Is this a side business?

1750
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:31,420
Sir… No, sir. 
She is my friend.

1751
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,710
You and me are not friends.

1752
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:33,250
Shhh..!

1753
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,000
Friend?

1754
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:36,460
Did she come here to give you company? 
Or did she come from some company?

1755
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,170
Company? Yes… Infosys. 
-Tell him to shut up.

1756
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,960
Being a woman, don’t you have any shame 
resorting to this sort of work?

1757
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,920
Sir… Please understand....

1758
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:42,710
No.

1759
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:45,000
Myra. Just keep quiet. 
I am dealing with it, right?

1760
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,590
Please... I beg you.

1761
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:47,800
What did you say?

1762
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,460
Ten lakhs... Final sir.

1763
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,000
What ten lakhs? 
I gave fifty.

1764
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,210
Myra, just keep quiet.

1765
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,460
So, is she Myra?

1766
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,130
Yes. That’s me.

1767
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:55,130
Sir. Ten lakh fifty thousand rupees.

1768
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:56,000
10,50,000 rupees.

1769
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:57,130
Oh my!

1770
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:01,300
I wonder whose face I saw this morning. 
How is it that I am getting so lucky today?

1771
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,750
For catching you, I get money.

1772
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:05,880
And for catching her, I get a promotion.

1773
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,050
Sir, just give it a thought once again.

1774
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,880
Why all this fuss? 
Give me 30 lakhs.

1775
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,340
I will let you go. 
And she will be imprisoned.

1776
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,460
Hey! What is he talking? 
-Sir. Please think again.

1777
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,340
No. Nothing doing. 
-Please sir.

1778
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,920
Do you want to take her place instead in the prison?

1779
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:21,800
Yeah. Go ahead. Go on. 
-Sir, please let her go as well.

1780
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,130
I cannot let her go.

1781
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:24,840
Do you know how long we’ve been searching for her? 
-Please sir...Sir...

1782
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,920
Freaking girl...

1783
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,210
How dare you call me like that?

1784
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:28,420
[Cursing..]

1785
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,550
How dare you use cuss words on me?

1786
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:32,300
Please sir…

1787
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,170
Sir… Please sir… Sir…Sir…

1788
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:35,300
I am going to kill you.

1789
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:41,460
How dare you? 
How dare you use cuss words on me?

1790
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,500
You knew that I was a policeman and 
yet you stabbed me, right?

1791
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:55,300
I will see your end.

1792
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,380
I will show you the power of the police.

1793
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,210
I will get the entire force with me.

1794
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:07,380
How come you stabbed him like that?

1795
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,840
What else should I do?

1796
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,050
I was talking to him, right?

1797
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:11,250
Did you not hear what he was saying?

1798
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,670
I was talking to him…

1799
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,170
How dare he call me names?

1800
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,250
I was talking to him…

1801
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,340
How dare he hit me up?

1802
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:16,840
I was talking to him…

1803
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,130
What is that you were talking?

1804
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,500
What if he goes and tells the entire police department?

1805
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,170
He is already on his way.

1806
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:25,300
Oh, Damn!

1807
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,550
Sir… Sir…

1808
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:28,380
Sir…

1809
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:33,800
Sir…

1810
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:46,300
What are you doing?

1811
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:47,590
Can’t you see?

1812
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:48,960
What about him?

1813
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,960
Why would you ask me that? 
-What do you mean?

1814
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:54,710
You are the one who lives here.

1815
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,880
The one who cooks the drugs here, is you.

1816
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:00,090
If the police come here, 
You will be the one who will be caught.

1817
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:03,170
How can you laugh like that?

1818
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:05,500
Please say something, Myra.

1819
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,960
That is not my problem.

1820
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,550
If my package is ready.

1821
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,420
I will take it and leave.

1822
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:15,590
You deal with it. 
It’s none of my concern.

1823
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:25,960
You?

1824
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,420
What are you doing?

1825
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:28,420
Tell me, what do you want?

1826
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,550
You told me that we could smoke some weed.

1827
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,170
It’s difficult now. 
Come back later.

1828
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,630
You say the same thing every time.

1829
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,000
We have to do it today.

1830
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:37,670
I told you we will do it later. 
-Let’s smoke the weed.

1831
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:39,420
Let’s smoke... Let’s smoke... Let’s smoke.

1832
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:40,840
Don't you understand when 
I say it is not possible now.

1833
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,090
Why can’t we do it now? 
You already took money.

1834
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:44,170
We have to smoke today.

1835
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,920
Alright fine. 
I will give you the weed.

1836
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,750
You smoke it up.

1837
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,960
I don’t know how to smoke it. 
Please…

1838
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,960
If we can’t do it at your place, 
we will do it in my place.

1839
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,250
Grandma is asleep.

1840
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,670
Mad girl. 
Please go.

1841
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Will you come with me, or should I come inside?

1842
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:01,170
I will come. Wait.

1843
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:07,230
Hey Myra… 
Get up. Get up.

1844
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:08,230
Get up.

1845
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,230
My bad time!

1846
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,770
I want my package. 
-Yeah.. yeah...I will give it.

1847
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:14,150
You have been repeatedly harassing me over that package.

1848
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,520
Sit here. Stay.

1849
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,190
At this point of time I started getting into a trance...

1850
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,060
At that time someone...

1851
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,560
Who?

1852
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:35,560
If I knew who it was. 
I would have told you, right?

1853
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,730
What happened next?

1854
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:41,060
After that you guys came.

1855
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,190
Then, who killed Ravi?

1856
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:43,980
I don’t know.

1857
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:45,270
She must be the one who killed him. 
And now, she is playing games.

1858
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:46,810
Why will I kill Ravi?

1859
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:48,900
Ravi is the only person 
who witnessed you killing the constable.

1860
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,810
So, if she kills Ravi as well. 
She won’t be a suspect anymore.

1861
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:52,810
There would be absolutely no proof that 
she was ever here.

1862
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:56,980
Even if I did kill that guy, 
why would I need to stay here?

1863
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:57,690
I would have been long gone.

1864
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:58,650
You are here for your drugs.

1865
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:02,270
Then, why is this room door locked from the outside?

1866
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,520
You must have locked it from the outside 
and must have hid inside.

1867
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:06,850
Seriously? 
-Yes! Of course!

1868
01:42:06,850 --> 01:42:08,310
We cannot believe her.

1869
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,230
Please believe me.

1870
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:12,770
I really don’t know who killed Ravi.

1871
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:14,440
What’s the proof that you are telling us the truth?

1872
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,270
If you don’t believe, get lost.

1873
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:16,980
Look at her. Look. 
Look at her frustration.

1874
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:17,730
I am going to kill her.

1875
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:18,730
Hey… Call the police.

1876
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:20,520
Call the police.

1877
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:23,900
Please.. I told you exactly what happened.

1878
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:27,690
I don’t have any problem with you guys. 
If you let me go, I will take my package and leave.

1879
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:29,350
The police will then imprison us instead.

1880
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:32,600
Hey! If we can somehow set it up in a way that 
the constable and Ravi killed each other,

1881
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,850
we can all escape from this mess.

1882
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:35,270
Why are you including us?

1883
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:36,810
What is our connection to this crime?

1884
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:40,850
If that’s the case, you guys leave, 
I will take care of the rest.

1885
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:43,650
Really? So that you can take the drugs and escape?

1886
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,560
What the hell is your problem?

1887
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:48,520
You don't have a problem for any solution. 
What do you want me to do?

1888
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,940
Just confess that you killed both of them 
and hand yourself over to the police.

1889
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,100
What do you need? Money?

1890
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,400
Tell me the amount. 
I will give it.

1891
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,850
No matter how much the amount will you give it?

1892
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:03,100
In this situation, nothing is more important 
than my life.

1893
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,520
Even that?

1894
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:09,850
Babu… please. No.

1895
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,230
Don’t do anything to it.

1896
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:12,900
I told you I will give you how much ever you want.

1897
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,940
Babu… What are you doing?

1898
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:18,940
Babu…

1899
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,400
I am talking to you. 
Listen to me and call the police.

1900
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,480
Listen to me. 
-They will take care of her.

1901
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,230
Babu… don’t take any hasty decisions.

1902
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:25,560
Listen to me. 
Tell me how much do you want.

1903
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:27,850
You tell me.

1904
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,400
30 lakhs?

1905
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:35,230
No….

1906
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:59,020
Have you gone mad? 
Why are you hitting him?

1907
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:00,730
He is the one responsible for everything.

1908
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:06,190
Take a look.

1909
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,150
Abhi, what is this?

1910
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:21,900
What did you think? 
You never thought that there would be a camera there, right?

1911
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:27,900
If we didn’t take the camera out of the bathroom, 
we would have listened to him and would have been cheated.

1912
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,400
Abhi… 
what are you doing here?

1913
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,730
Not like this...

1914
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,600
Why did you do it?

1915
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:47,600
Tell me.

1916
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,190
Tell me.

1917
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,350
Babu… 
-Tell me.

1918
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:51,600
Tell me.

1919
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,150
Why did you set me up?

1920
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:56,400
I will tell you… 
I didn’t do it on purpose.

1921
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:58,810
Because of the situation I had to do like that.

1922
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,940
What is your connection with Ravi?

1923
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,100
I'll tell.

1924
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:02,440
I'll tell.

1925
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:09,020
Six months ago, Ravi and I started this business.

1926
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:12,480
To ensure that people don’t get suspicious, 
we took a flat in this housing colony.

1927
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:15,480
Cooking drugs was my job.

1928
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,020
Selling them was Ravi’s.

1929
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,400
I don’t know anything about the dealer.

1930
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:25,100
That’s why I don’t know about Myra 
and neither does she know about me.

1931
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,730
Just like every other day, I came to this flat….

1932
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,150
I saw Myra.

1933
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:55,060
And then, I called Ravi.

1934
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:57,600
What’s happening?

1935
01:45:57,850 --> 01:45:58,600
Where did you go?

1936
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,270
I went to the flat downstairs.

1937
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:00,730
Why?

1938
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:03,230
To smoke weed.

1939
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:04,980
How could you with a dead body here?

1940
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:06,020
Who is he?

1941
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,230
Ravi told me everything that happened.

1942
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:13,650
So, that’s our dealer Myra?

1943
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,060
Yes... What did you do to her?

1944
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:20,810
I didn’t know who she was 
so, I hit her hard on the head.

1945
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,600
Oh.. Damn!

1946
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:23,270
She is not dead.

1947
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,480
I told you to give her package last week itself, right?

1948
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:28,810
The thing is…. 
-What happened?

1949
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:31,350
There was another party that wanted it. 
So, I gave it to them.

1950
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:32,650
Are you mad?

1951
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:34,480
When you gave deadline to her, 
why did you sell it to someone else?

1952
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:36,560
They offered to pay twice the amount. 
That’s why.

1953
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,100
That is the reason why I ask you to get involved 
with the dealing side of the business.

1954
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,400
You won't... what could I do?

1955
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:44,690
We set all of it up really well.

1956
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:46,350
Now we have to start from scratch.

1957
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:48,350
What shall we do now?

1958
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:49,650
The one who is dead is a constable.

1959
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:51,480
That too someone who came here for verification.

1960
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:53,270
They will definitely come here searching for him.

1961
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,190
What do we do now?

1962
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,310
What if we dispose of the body?

1963
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:14,190
What flat did you come from?

1964
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,060
401.

1965
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,770
Did you find anyone there? 
-There…

1966
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:20,150
there was someone sleeping in the bedroom.

1967
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,060
Is it him?

1968
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:24,730
Yeah. He looks a little like him.

1969
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:30,650
Alright, let’s go. 
-Where?

1970
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:22,850
What are you doing?

1971
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,560
I am trying to set it up in such a way 
that it looks like this guy murdered him.

1972
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,310
What for?

1973
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:28,190
An old lady died because of him.

1974
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:30,770
If we can set it up in a way that looks 
like he killed the constable...

1975
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:34,270
the police would conclude that he came for a delivery, 
tried to rob the place and killed the constable.

1976
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,400
What are you doing?

1977
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,980
Destroying the CCTV footage.

1978
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:52,850
Why?

1979
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:57,270
Because Myra killed the constable, 
she cannot deal with us.

1980
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,900
She also gave us the 50 lakhs.

1981
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:02,020
Let’s take it and get out.

1982
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:08,400
Let’s also take the drugs that we cooked for her.

1983
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,520
What will we do with them?

1984
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,480
If we sell them outside, 
we could get 2 crores.

1985
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,560
We can then set up things again somewhere else.

1986
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,650
What should we do with this set up?

1987
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:15,730
We should clean it up. 
-Do you think it’s that easy?

1988
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,770
However much we clean this, 
it’s not hard to figure out that it was for cooking drugs.

1989
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,850
If that’s the case, 
it would be better if we run away from here.

1990
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,020
We don’t have a lot of time.

1991
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:25,600
We have a maximum of a day. 
The police are sure to come searching for the constable here.

1992
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:29,440
It looks like a decent idea 
but everyone knows that I live in this flat.

1993
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:32,270
If there is a delivery boy or a constable in here 
it would mean that I opened the door.

1994
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,230
Even if we escape anywhere, 
they will track me.

1995
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:36,230
We will then have murder 
as well as drug charges on us.

1996
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:37,520
What now?

1997
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:43,020
Do you need some water?

1998
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,440
One second.

1999
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:52,020
Hey… Hey…

2000
01:49:58,230 --> 01:50:01,060
No one but us knows that 
we are working alongside each other.

2001
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:04,600
So, if you die, the drug charge will be on you as well.

2002
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:13,600
As to the charge of the murder of the policeman here, 
they will conclude as per their imagination.

2003
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:16,850
That gap is enough... 
I will escape in that confusion.

2004
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,730
I wanted to leave with the drugs and the money.

2005
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:30,440
But when you escaped, my plan got disturbed.

2006
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:32,940
I thought you would be at home 
and so, I came home.

2007
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:35,690
I found out that you have the money.

2008
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,980
But I didn’t want to share that money with you guys.

2009
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,480
That’s why I wanted to bring it back to the flat.

2010
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,400
You said that you would go to the police.

2011
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:45,810
But I got lucky when the mobile 
I placed in the bag rang.

2012
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:47,190
And when you got to know that dead 
person is the constable...

2013
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:49,650
You suggested that we go to the flat, 
Then my job became easier.

2014
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:52,600
Because I had Ravi’s car with me, 
it was easy at the entrance...

2015
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,480
The watchman did not stop us.

2016
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,770
When we reached 401,

2017
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,150
I knew for sure that you would have figured out that 
you didn’t come out of that flat.

2018
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:01,230
That is exactly what happened.

2019
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:05,020
But I never expected the old woman to be alive.

2020
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,940
And then, you figured out this flat.

2021
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:09,400
With the key I had, I opened this door.

2022
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:15,190
I thought you would leave after you found your packages.

2023
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:16,900
(My packages)

2024
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:18,850
But you got busy solving the murder.

2025
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:20,350
(How will we leave if we don’t know what happened here?)

2026
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:22,190
At that time, I tried really hard to divert you.

2027
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:23,100
(Let’s go.)

2028
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:27,100
(It looks like there is a big gang behind this set up) 
-Let's leave from here.

2029
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:28,560
But you didn't listen.

2030
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,400
And then you found her 
and immediately you found him.

2031
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,400
Because Myra didn’t know who I was. 
I wanted to frame her…

2032
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,810
[Cursing]

2033
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,270
I thought I could escape.

2034
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,900
But… that video…

2035
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:46,730
Buddy, nothing was pre planned.

2036
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:48,810
I went with the flow.

2037
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:51,520
I got swept away in the situation.

2038
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:53,770
We lived together, roamed together...

2039
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:57,270
How could you think of cheating us?

2040
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,850
Just because we ate and spent time together 
would you follow me to the prison.

2041
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:00,480
No, right?

2042
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,600
I didn’t do all this to cheat anyone.

2043
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:03,900
I did this to protect myself.

2044
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:05,440
If you were in my place, 
you would have done the same.

2045
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,690
How dare you compare us with you?

2046
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:08,230
Shut up! 
You thief!

2047
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:10,440
How dare you call me a thief? 
-What else would you call a person who robs?

2048
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,770
How many times do I have to tell you? 
That’s not robbery. That’s called pocketing money.

2049
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:13,310
Shut up!

2050
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:16,440
You are just reasoning it all up 
to make yourself feel better.

2051
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:18,770
If what you did was not wrong, 
neither what I did was wrong.

2052
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,230
How can you talk like that? 
After having done all this?

2053
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:22,020
Don’t you feel ashamed?

2054
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:23,650
When you are not ashamed, 
why would I be?

2055
01:52:23,810 --> 01:52:26,190
You tried to escape when you were under 
the assumption that that old woman died.

2056
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:27,020
I did the same thing.

2057
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:28,310
That was an accident.

2058
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,650
This is deliberate.

2059
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:32,650
Even then, I wanted to go to the police station 
when I realised my mistake.

2060
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:33,230
But did you go?

2061
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:34,810
You were scared and so you dismissed that idea.

2062
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,400
I did the same thing because I was scared.

2063
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:39,060
You mean to say that you would do anything 
to save yourself?

2064
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:40,400
Even frame us?

2065
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:43,020
He doesn’t know the value of friendship.

2066
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:45,310
Oh really? Such great friends, huh?

2067
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:49,020
I just lived with you guys in that dingy place 
just to save some money.

2068
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:50,520
Do you think people become friends 
because they stay in the same house?

2069
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:51,850
They become friends only when 
they get to know each other.

2070
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:54,150
I knew about your problems only today.

2071
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:56,310
We knew about your drugs today as well.

2072
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:58,230
Otherwise, you mean to say 
we should pocket money like you?

2073
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,810
This is all a product of my wisdom and hard work.

2074
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:04,190
For whom? Huh? 
Who will benefit from this?

2075
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:06,060
Who benefits from a cigarette?

2076
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:07,150
But they still manufacture it.

2077
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:08,770
And people still smoke it. 
This is the same thing.

2078
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:12,440
So, are you suggesting that every one 
takes drugs and get high?

2079
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,770
I am not forcing anybody to take it. 
And I am not selling it door to door.

2080
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:16,850
It’s because there is a demand, 
I supply it.

2081
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:19,190
Why are you still talking to him? 
Just call the police.

2082
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:20,770
And then?

2083
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:22,650
Get me arrested, is it?

2084
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,810
Do you think you will safe after they arrest me?

2085
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,850
Do you think the police will believe you 
if you say you knew nothing about it?

2086
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:37,400
Then, I will tell them that the three of us are 
in this together and I will make them believe it.

2087
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:40,770
You...

2088
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:42,100
You will burn in hell.

2089
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:47,020
You have no other choice but to 
do as I tell you.

2090
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:48,850
Let bygones be bygones.

2091
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,560
Listen to me at least now...

2092
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:56,100
Let’s take the drugs and money, frame her 
and we can all get out of this mess.

2093
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:01,020
I made one mistake because I listened to him.

2094
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:04,980
I will not make another mistake listening to you.

2095
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,980
This is the reason why you did all this, right?

2096
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:09,560
What will you do if this doesn’t exist?

2097
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:19,060
Babu, have you gone mad?

2098
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,020
Damn!

2099
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:22,770
Damn!

2100
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:23,650
I'll kill you.

2101
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:26,310
Hey, leave me.

2102
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,060
Move a side.

2103
01:54:28,150 --> 01:54:30,100
Babu.. my neck...no.

2104
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:30,980
Leave me.

2105
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:35,940
Tie him up.

2106
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:38,150
Leave me.

2107
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:39,440
Tie him up.

2108
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,310
Babu, listen to me.

2109
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:47,480
I'll kill you.

2110
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,690
[Chaos]

2111
01:54:49,690 --> 01:54:51,480
Hey... I thought the white powder 
In our kitchen was salt all these days.

2112
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:52,190
I got it now that is a drug.

2113
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:53,600
Hey, that is not the drug 
That is salt.

2114
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:55,650
Hey, Dasu you go away.

2115
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:13,310
Where will you run away?

2116
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:42,310
Leave me.

2117
02:00:23,070 --> 02:00:28,700
Please answer my questions with a Yes or a No only.

2118
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:30,610
What is your name?

2119
02:00:30,650 --> 02:00:31,240
Yes…

2120
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,320
Su... Yesu.

2121
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:34,990
Babu.

2122
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:39,490
Do you know Abhi?

2123
02:00:39,530 --> 02:00:40,530
No. 
-Yes.

2124
02:00:43,030 --> 02:00:46,200
Do you know that Abhi makes drugs?

2125
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:46,950
Yes. 
-No.

2126
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:53,570
Sir, it’s a bit confusing to answer your questions this way.

2127
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:55,360
We will tell you everything in detail.

2128
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:59,280
That is what happened.

2129
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:08,950
What is this?

2130
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:12,700
There is a camera fixed in every room of that house.

2131
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:13,740
Did you fix it?

2132
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,110
Ravi did.

2133
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:16,490
Abhi didn’t know that?

2134
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:17,530
I don’t know about that.

2135
02:01:17,650 --> 02:01:19,360
Why? Didn’t you interrogate him yet?

2136
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:20,740
We cannot.

2137
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:21,570
Why?

2138
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:23,530
Because of drug overdose.

2139
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:27,700
Recovery….

2140
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:31,030
What about Myra…

2141
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:34,150
Recovery…

2142
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:35,610
Damn!

2143
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,070
Does that mean only the both of us recovered?

2144
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:40,110
How?

2145
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:41,450
It’s a medical miracle.

2146
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:46,150
To know that we recovered so quickly. 
Wow... what a great body mine is.

2147
02:01:46,570 --> 02:01:49,030
How long ago do you think your incident happened?

2148
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:50,780
Four days?

2149
02:01:51,150 --> 02:01:52,320
Four weeks.

2150
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,110
This is 2016, right?

2151
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:59,070
When you already know everything that has happened, 
Then, why are you interrogating us, sir?

2152
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:01,490
Just testing to see if you are telling the truth or not.

2153
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:03,530
Sir, we did tell you, didn’t we? 
Can we leave?

2154
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:05,240
No.... There is another question for you.

2155
02:02:07,650 --> 02:02:08,320
Tell me...

2156
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:09,950
where is the money?

2157
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:10,820
What Money?

2158
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,240
That day we put the money in the bag and bring it.

2159
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:15,820
Just check it, sir.

2160
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,950
The bag is still there. 
But there are only 5 lakhs in it.

2161
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:20,860
What do you mean? 
I opened the bag and saw the money myself.

2162
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:24,070
There is money on the top 
but it’s all newspapers underneath.

2163
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:25,900
What did you do?

2164
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:27,740
I told you to get all the money that day.

2165
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:28,570
Hey...

2166
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:30,740
You have two options.

2167
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:31,900
The first one...

2168
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:36,240
keep the money with you 
and go to the jail as criminals.

2169
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:37,240
Two...

2170
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:41,320
give the money to me 
and walk away from this freely.

2171
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,490
Choice is yours.

2172
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:46,740
How can you imprison us with 
so much evidence in against the others?

2173
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:50,740
Do you know that there is an option called delete in it.

2174
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:52,950
I put only 5 lakhs in the bag that day.

2175
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,320
Take the twenty-five lakhs and let us go, sir.

2176
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,780
What do you mean? 
If there are only 5 lakhs in the bag...

2177
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,280
there must be a total of 45 lakhs.

2178
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,150
How would you come up with a figure of 25 lakhs?

2179
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:07,780
I remember now sir.

2180
02:03:07,950 --> 02:03:09,280
I forgot it because I was high.

2181
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:11,950
It is in the attic in my house.

2182
02:03:11,950 --> 02:03:13,070
That’s good.

2183
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:14,070
We found the bag, Sir.

2184
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:15,860
There is money in this bag... 
what about my share?

2185
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:16,490
Ok... ok.

2186
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,740
What will you do with us now?

2187
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:26,360
All of you are aware of the incident 
that occurred at Mansion Heights.

2188
02:03:26,530 --> 02:03:29,070
The interrogation for the case is finished today.

2189
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:36,360
Based on the information provided by two of 
our informers who have just recovered...

2190
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:42,400
we have concluded that Abhi and Myra are the culprits...

2191
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:44,150
and we will be submitting the report for the same.

2192
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:47,780
We have found the diary of the primary suspect Myra.

2193
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:53,280
The diary contains the names of business tycoons, 
Film celebrities and even politicians.

2194
02:03:53,610 --> 02:04:00,740
I promise that I will ensure each and everyone named in 
this diary will be brought to face the law.

2195
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:03,950
If he took so much money from us, 
I wonder how much he would take from them.

2196
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:05,490
Let it go, buddy.

2197
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,900
At least, because of us the drug racket got exposed.

2198
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:12,360
I never thought Abhi would do this.

2199
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:15,240
I never thought you robbed people either.

2200
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:18,610
I never thought even you would listen 
to me and rob people.

2201
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:20,360
Anyways, it’s called pocketing the money.

2202
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:23,360
What did you understand from this?

2203
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:26,320
Leave English serials 
Telugu serials are the way forward.

2204
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:28,280
Let’s watch it.

2205
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:32,450
Please sir. Nothing will happen to her. 
Let me give you the first aid. [On TV]

2206
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:33,320
No… I don’t want it. [On TV]

2207
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:35,150
Ratna…Ratna…

2208
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:40,610
Doctor… please tell me that nothing happened 
to my Ratna…

2209
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:42,240
What happened to Ratna?

2210
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:43,360
How will I know?

2211
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:46,900
Due to severe injuries, her cerebellum was damaged.

2212
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:50,200
She got a hole in heart also.

2213
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:53,070
I am sorry.

2214
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:54,900
These doctors are always like this.

2215
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:57,610
Why are you so sad?

2216
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:00,070
It isn’t a big deal.

2217
02:05:02,990 --> 02:05:07,780
I am going to die in your arms as a married woman. 
What could be greater than that?

2218
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,610
Please don’t say that Ratna.

2219
02:05:16,450 --> 02:05:17,320
Ratna….

2220
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,110
No.

2221
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,650
Ratna Madam...

2222
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:27,450
From today onwards Rs 500 and 
Rs.1000 notes are not valid.

2223
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:31,320
Ok.. Start Music...
