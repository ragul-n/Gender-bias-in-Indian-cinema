1
00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:05,097
Smoking is injurious to health.
It causes cancer.

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,430
Smoking is injurious to health.
It causes cancer.

3
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:30,392
Yes.

4
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:31,078
Are you listening?

5
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,405
Yes, I can hear you.

6
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,213
Is it better now?

7
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,853
What about the new maid?

8
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:44,905
She is still on leaves?

9
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:50,407
No. It's been 4 days.

10
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:52,803
Yes.

11
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:56,153
Mr Sen, it's ready.
- Wait a minute.

12
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,763
Listen. I have to go. Take care.

13
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:04,188
I am going to climb up.
The network might not be there.

14
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,203
I will try to call you.

15
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,768
Okay, bye.

16
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,130
Sir, your company has forcefully
taken this plot.

17
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:19,562
Honestly speaking, it's not
possible to work on this plot.

18
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,443
The land we saw on the way is good.

19
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,240
Why are we climbing up
unnecessarily?

20
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:26,512
It's exotic.

21
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,132
Haven't you seen the word in the
advertisements for hotel and tourism?

22
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,133
That's our goal.

23
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:37,175
Sir, this place is developing.
There will be a traffic jam here.

24
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,128
You wouldn't care about the exotic
place any more.

25
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:40,858
What's stopping you?

26
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,190
Why are you fixated on this plot?

27
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:45,210
You get a lot of brokerages.

28
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:48,782
Hotel on such a huge plot?

29
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,410
Sir, have you seen anything else
apart from homestays here?

30
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,588
Would the localites create
a problem? - Please stop.

31
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,423
I am talking to him.

32
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,083
Look,

33
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,083
we are creating employment
opportunities.

34
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,730
There will be local employment when

35
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,042
the construction
of the hotel begins.

36
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,285
What do you think?

37
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,980
That no one tried to work
on this plot?

38
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:16,005
I know it.

39
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,197
I have heard about it but

40
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:20,040
I have never fooled local people.

41
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:24,390
I will be under a lot of pressure.

42
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:27,813
Okay.

43
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,507
You may go ahead with it.

44
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,170
Thank you.

45
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,528
But I will show you another plot
day after tomorrow.

46
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:36,533
I will see it for my knowledge
if you insist.

47
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,565
We will proceed with the work
considering this plot.

48
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,340
Okay. I will take your leave.

49
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,848
Bye.

50
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,343
Bye.

51
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,515
What?

52
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,918
Do you want to smoke?

53
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:07,810
No.

54
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,553
You are smoking at this altitude.

55
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,538
There are no houses or people here.

56
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:31,402
And I should build a hotel here.

57
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,510
There is no network here.

58
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:42,425
Yes, that's right.
There's no network here.

59
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,948
Shit.

60
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:02,902
Hey.
- Sir.

61
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,403
Two bottles of mineral water.

62
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,623
And a little hot water.

63
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,710
Okay.

64
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:08,103
Get me two glasses.
- Anything else?

65
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,845
Mr Sen.

66
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,047
Don't you want some food?

67
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,218
Are chips available?
- Yes.

68
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,785
Get me some.
- Okay.

69
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,823
What's for dinner?

70
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:22,302
There is vegetarian food tonight.
Pulses, bread and vegetables.

71
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:25,340
Ben, get the luggage sent here.

72
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,613
Okay.

73
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,895
Ben.
- Sir.

74
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:30,565
Is egg available?

75
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:32,655
Yes.

76
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,645
Get two omelettes for dinner.

77
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,178
Okay? Two?
- Yes.

78
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,533
Anything else?

79
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,890
(Local language)

80
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,235
Now? I will have to check.

81
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:42,885
I will go and check.

82
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:44,547
Send what's asked for.

83
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,422
Let's go.

84
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,098
The leftover from yesterday is not
finished yet.

85
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:51,978
Why did you ask for more?

86
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:36,403
(Local language)

87
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,215
I restarted it many times.

88
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,438
There is no network here.

89
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,468
Didn't you know that there is no
network here?

90
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,553
I knew it.

91
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,390
That's why I changed the sim card.

92
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:07,205
I was using the cook's mobile
for so long.

93
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,232
There is nothing here.

94
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,830
Yes.

95
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,258
So many facilities.

96
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,332
Why didn't you check earlier?

97
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,383
Would you blame me now?

98
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:24,828
It's good you came.

99
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:28,493
You don't do anything. You are just
sitting and doing all that.

100
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,250
What?

101
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,388
The same. Love and all.

102
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:39,163
Okay.

103
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,445
What problem do you have with me?

104
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,540
I have been noticing.

105
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,723
I haven't worked with you earlier.

106
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,725
Why do you assume that I am a
wasteful resource?

107
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,413
You spoke to your family
this morning.

108
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,630
It became a problem when I want
to do the same.

109
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:02,783
Do you want to drink?

110
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,238
No.

111
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,700
Why do you ask me the same
thing every day?

112
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:30,880
(Local language)

113
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,348
(Local language)

114
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,067
(Local language)

115
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,492
(Local language)

116
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,560
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

117
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,892
Can I have a cup of tea?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:44,372
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

119
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:46,228
Aren't you ready yet? Don't you
want to go to the site?

120
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,883
No, there is nothing to see.

121
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,692
The plots here are useless.

122
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:53,070
Have a seat.
- Yes.

123
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,665
I am in a vacation mood today.

124
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,322
Okay. Seems like you had
a party last night.

125
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:01,598
Party? With him?

126
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,615
Where is Mr Bhaskar?
Is he sleeping?

127
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,798
No, he went for a walk in the
morning.

128
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,240
It's quite late.
- Okay.

129
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:16,188
Is Michael your real name?

130
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:20,345
Lal Babu Pandit.

131
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:23,443
Are you not Christian?
- No, sir.

132
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:25,262
I am from Bihar.

133
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,102
Most people here are Buddhist.

134
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,973
We don't stay here.
We live down the hill.

135
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:31,972
I thought so.

136
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,995
Sir, my grandfather came here
many years back.

137
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,732
He worked at a garment shop.

138
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:38,432
Later, my father came here.

139
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,163
He bought the shop.

140
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:42,810
But I didn't like the work.

141
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:46,537
I like driving. So, I bought a car.

142
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:52,055
The syndicate's drivers used to
call me Micheal.

143
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,020
From Michael Schumacher.

144
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,042
Oh, like that.

145
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:00,133
Michael, is there a market around?
- Yes.

146
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,530
I want to shop.

147
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,630
There is one but it's away
from here.

148
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,317
If you are ready, then let's go.

149
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:19,155
Did you go to the market?

150
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:21,607
No, there is no market here.

151
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,595
I got it from here.

152
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Where are you going?

153
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,750
I am going to get some wood.

154
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:45,487
Are you kidding with me?

155
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:48,245
You shouldn't go around like that.

156
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,423
Are you on holiday?
- Okay, sir.

157
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:52,417
(Local language)

158
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:54,268
What is this?
- Okay.

159
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,730
You have vegetables, right?
Do you have a lemon?

160
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,438
Yes.
- Okay.

161
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:00,442
What was in the packet?

162
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:02,923
A pig. Didn't you hear it?

163
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,072
I know what pork is.

164
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,065
With whose permission
did you get it?

165
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:10,483
That's strange, Mr Sen. Do I need
permission for that?

166
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,032
Are we on a school tour?

167
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,210
No. We are on an office tour.

168
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,033
And you work under me.

169
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:19,920
You can't bring pork here
just because I don't say anything.

170
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,392
Do you even know if it's allowed
in their house?

171
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:24,003
Let me say something.

172
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,482
We should have a
mutual understanding

173
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,443
if we have to work
and stay together.

174
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,480
Understood? Get that straight
into your head.

175
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,965
It's neither fish nor egg.

176
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,353
Even you drink at night.

177
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:41,490
Did you ever ask me if I am
comfortable with it?

178
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,480
Why did you have a fight because
of meat?

179
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:48,898
What can I say?

180
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,532
I am going to have it, not him.
- Are you saying something?

181
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:57,118
Yes.

182
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,093
We are at a higher altitude.

183
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:03,180
Yes, we have come down as we
don't have as much work today.

184
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,123
It's really cold here.

185
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,785
I have a peculiar boy with me.

186
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,438
He is driving me crazy as there is
no network.

187
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,967
Yes.

188
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:18,550
Okay. Listen. Did she get up?

189
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,677
Huh?

190
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,510
Wake her up after some time.

191
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,023
Otherwise, she won't eat.

192
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:26,197
Okay.

193
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:29,318
Oh God. I haven't paid the maid.

194
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,678
Don't pay her. I would return
and pay her.

195
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,528
I will call you back.

196
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,103
Bye.

197
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,730
How much?
- Rs 20.

198
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,623
Don't you have to make a call?

199
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,023
Go ahead.

200
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,518
No.

201
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:48,458
I have network.

202
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,295
I forgot to get my mobile.

203
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,045
Gopal had called.

204
00:15:55,058 --> 00:15:56,108
What did he say?

205
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:57,643
We can't have that plot.

206
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,548
He won't take any responsibility
for the plot.

207
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,522
What does he mean?

208
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:04,257
Ask him to come. We have
to talk to him.

209
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,000
That's not possible.

210
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:08,182
He has gone to the town for
some urgent work.

211
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:09,408
He would return the
day after tomorrow.

212
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,455
Bloody hell. Let's go.

213
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,498
Would you like to have some momos?

214
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,383
Not now. Let's go.

215
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,908
Sir.

216
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,588
(Local language)

217
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:25,452
That's a great gift.

218
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,725
Thank you.

219
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:28,063
Oh.

220
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:30,188
You know the local tongue.

221
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,288
Somewhat.

222
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,790
I can't speak but I can understand.

223
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,073
Still.

224
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,708
Sir, shall I leave?

225
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,363
Come at 8 in the morning tomorrow.

226
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,500
Okay. Did you have dinner?

227
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:44,802
I will in some time.

228
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,627
My friends are here. We will
chat for a while.

229
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,865
Is there a bar nearby?

230
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,115
Yes.

231
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,918
Can I go there and buy it?

232
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,943
You can even drink there.

233
00:18:54,153 --> 00:18:55,947
No.

234
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
No.

235
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:00,510
Don't act. Do you want to come?

236
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,213
Yes.

237
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:19,195
No. I have network now.

238
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,543
Yes.

239
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,853
Who is it?
- Carry on. I will follow you.

240
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,570
Hello.

241
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,213
Yes.

242
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:29,658
Okay. Listen to me. Honestly...

243
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:30,863
Hello.

244
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,603
(Local language)

245
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:40,678
Do you want another one?

246
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:44,583
A small one.

247
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,935
Sir, tell me when to stop.

248
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,108
That's enough.

249
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,307
You too have some.
- Thank you.

250
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,070
Thank you.

251
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:12,388
Mr Bhaskar is here.

252
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:15,293
Please come and have a seat.

253
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,910
Sir.

254
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,527
Are you leaving?
- Yes.

255
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,935
Okay, good night.
- Good night.

256
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,095
Good night, sir.

257
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,978
Excuse me.

258
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:38,205
Yes.

259
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,298
Yes, sir.

260
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:44,307
Do you have pork momos?
- Yes.

261
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,065
Get me one plate of chicken and
pork momos each.

262
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,478
Okay.

263
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:05,578
What happened?

264
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,163
Cheers.

265
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,428
Cheers.

266
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,463
You get stressed a lot.

267
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:31,933
You get tense.

268
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,407
Don't do that.

269
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:34,970
Did I say anything to you?

270
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,880
What would you say?

271
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,377
I know you had a fight with her.

272
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,573
Say something else, please.

273
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,993
Break-up.

274
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,163
Why are you trying
to be a detective?

275
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,158
Have your drink.
- What can I do?

276
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:53,107
I hail from a lawyer's family.
That's my habit.

277
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:57,793
Why did you fight?

278
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,117
I can't tell you.

279
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:19,578
I didn't do anything.

280
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,395
This is the first time I came
so far on a tour.

281
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,945
That's why it's creating troubles.

282
00:22:34,782 --> 00:22:35,797
That happens.

283
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,363
That's why.
- That's obvious.

284
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,290
Why would it happen though?

285
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:46,332
Give it some time.

286
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,358
You are still young.

287
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,890
What would you do at my age?

288
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,642
Which one is the pork momo?
- This one.

289
00:22:58,348 --> 00:22:59,840
Here you go.

290
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:09,155
I won't drink more.

291
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,205
It creates a little problem in
the beginning.

292
00:23:18,442 --> 00:23:20,493
Then you will get used to it.

293
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,498
Get married and everything
will be fine.

294
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,848
This is not your personal problem.

295
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:30,807
Your generation is suffering
from this.

296
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:32,955
Communication.

297
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,533
Exactly.

298
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,310
Everything is fine till I am
physical present there.

299
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:39,907
There are no fights.

300
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,218
If I am away, it's a problem.

301
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:44,708
Rascal.

302
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,335
All of you stay in touch.

303
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,653
But communication is the problem.

304
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,640
All of you are always connected.

305
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:06,435
Via mobile, messages, Facebook on
the internet.

306
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:10,948
You don't understand the pain
of not being able to be in touch.

307
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:12,718
That's why
you all don't respect it.

308
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:18,370
Don't take it the technology
for granted and respect it.

309
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,405
You had a fight with
your girlfriend

310
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,678
and drinking with a man
of your dad's age.

311
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:31,325
You should talk to her nicely

312
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,473
being able to talk to her at a
place where there is no network.

313
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:37,473
You should talk to her lovingly.

314
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,345
But you fought with her instead.

315
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:44,398
You know that you would just
apologise in some time. That's it.

316
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,995
It could have not been so simple.

317
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,473
What if it wasn't?

318
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,523
It's raining in the city.

319
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:23,918
Would you let me make a call?

320
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,748

328
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:00,527
Is it ringing?

329
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,108
The person you are trying to call
is not answering.

330
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:10,172
Please try after some time.

331
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:39,598

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,993
Do you know this song?

339
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,730
It's in the local language.

340
00:27:46,003 --> 00:27:47,732

(Local language)

344
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:58,265
No, sir. I was just joking.

345
00:27:58,465 --> 00:27:59,500
I don't know it so well.

346
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,462
I only know the song. It's by
Bipul Chettri, right?

347
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:03,795
Yes.
- I know the lyrics.

348
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,868
Like that.

349
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,897
I thought something else.

350
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:09,913
That you must be hiding something.

351
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,172
You almost impressed me.

352
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:19,880

(Local song)

355
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:37,290
Mr Bhaskar.

356
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:39,418
Who do you have in your family?

357
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,470
Father, mother.

358
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,350
Okay. No. You have it.

359
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:48,513
I have a son and a wife.

360
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:49,978
And a daughter.

361
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:52,363
Okay.

362
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,415
Sir, my daughter is an air hostess.

363
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,910
She doesn't stay with us. She is
settled in the city.

364
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:00,663
Is she married?

365
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:02,270
Not yet.

366
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,660
We are looking for an educated and
nice suitor from a decent family.

367
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:16,602
What do you call it? My daughter is
self-made.

368
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:21,375
We could never imagine someone
from our family do so well.

369
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,163
Especially a girl.

370
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:25,243
That's it.

371
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,897
Have tea. I will be right back.

372
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,905
What do you understand?
- You are thinking too much.

373
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,303
Air hostess.

374
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,990
Should I talk about you?

375
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:42,195
Pack your bags after reaching

376
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:45,778
the hotel. We will leave
tomorrow morning.

377
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,215
Where to?

378
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:57,902
Home.

379
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:00,713
We are going to a new place today.

380
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,063
What about the rest of the plots
to be shown by Gopal?

381
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,510
Leave it.

382
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,160
Enough of looking for a plot in a
remote place.

383
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,727
Let's go home.

384
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:24,902
Sir, you won't have any
problem, right?

385
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:27,500
There are rooms available
in the hotel.

386
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:30,905
If you don't have a problem,
then I don't either.

387
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,645
I would drink and go to sleep.

388
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,115
Sir, do you want to use the
bathroom right now?

389
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:38,402
No.
- Then I would.

390
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:40,597
I have indigestion.

391
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:41,993
Go ahead.

392
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:09,033
Oh my God. So many medicines.

393
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,068
No.

394
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:12,898
My health is not great.

395
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:14,715
That's why I keep it.

396
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,718
If I go out with you again, I will
have to carry medicines.

397
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,145
Why are you on the phone again?
Take the medicine.

398
00:32:27,848 --> 00:32:30,738
No. I was checking if the network
is here.

399
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,857
I am feeling how I felt on the
first day.

400
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,970
There should be network today.

401
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,053
Damn it.

402
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,835
Why are you panicking?

403
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,513
It's just one night. Why do you
get upset?

404
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,585
I am not upset. I just said it.

405
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,008
What is your problem?

406
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,268
Not a problem.

407
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,688
I am feeling weird.

408
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:07,548
How are you feeling physically?

409
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,255
I don't know.

410
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:13,002
My heart feels weird.

411
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,458
It will be fine.
- Have a drink with me.

412
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:16,983
You will be fine.

413
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:35,640
Mr Sen, you drink every day.

414
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:38,078
It's not good for your health.

415
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,743
What do you mean?

416
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:42,400
If you ask me.

417
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:44,405
I don't drink with everybody
every day.

418
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
I am drinking today.

419
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,028
You don't drink with me.

420
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:50,385
But you drink a lot.

421
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,533
Who told you that?
- I can't say that.

422
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,665
Cheers.
- Cheers.

423
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:18,352
I left her alone.

424
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:23,395
She is really worried.

425
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:26,908
She has anxiety.

426
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:32,100
You get anxious, not her.

427
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,550
That's not the case, sir.

428
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,898
Get married.

429
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:45,743
Stay with her.
Everything will be fine.

430
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:48,865
I did.

431
00:34:56,865 --> 00:35:01,170
I decided we can't stay apart
two years back.

432
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,852
I brought her to Kolkata.

433
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:08,088
I married her
at Dakshineshwar temple.

434
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,265
My family members aren't bad people.

435
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:16,973
They are pretty good.

436
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:19,227
But

437
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,622
Typical North Kolkata family.

438
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,733
We have a press at home.

439
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,467
The neighbours call it a press.

440
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:35,933
The same that happens.
Too many people.

441
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,057
The more the people,
the more the gossip.

442
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:42,337
You know what?

443
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,703
She doesn't know the city.

444
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:49,225
She is not from Kolkata.

445
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,887
My family won't help her.

446
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,143
She is very lonely.

447
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,890
When my job gets permanent...

448
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:06,700
No. I won't wait that long.

449
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:09,562
I would take her home when
I return from here.

450
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,948
She won't stay there but my family
should know.

451
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:16,230
What?

452
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:18,675
They are elders
but they don't realise

453
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,032
that it's not good for anybody.

454
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:23,027
No one is happy.

455
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,288
We are all struggling every day.

456
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:29,178
I am the only son.

457
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:32,173
Still.

458
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:39,012
Actually,

459
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:43,050
I am under a lot of stress
these days.

460
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,580
I will tell you.

461
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:52,342
Come in.

462
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,570
Dinner served.

463
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:58,663
Thank you.
- Okay.

464
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,103
Keep it there.

465
00:37:05,545 --> 00:37:06,805
Do you want to eat?

466
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:08,983
No.

467
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:11,093
I don't feel like.

468
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:12,855
I won't eat tonight.

469
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:16,490
You were saying something.

470
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,343
Forget about me. I keep talking.

471
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:21,918
You became silent.

472
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,573
Tell me

473
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:25,565
about your family.

474
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:29,330
I don't know about your wife
or children.

475
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,453
There is my wife,

476
00:37:45,673 --> 00:37:47,202
our maid who has been

477
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,730
with us for a long time

478
00:37:51,377 --> 00:37:53,085
and me in our family.

479
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:56,982
Child?

480
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:01,505
We don't have a child.

481
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,473
Sorry.

482
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:12,048
These days, couples decide

483
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,497
not to have a child but

484
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,393
We really wanted a child.

485
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:23,450
I joined a job after my graduation.

486
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:27,247
Then I got married.

487
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,620
Her name is Jonaki. She is a lot
younger to me.

488
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:37,825
After our marriage,

489
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,110
she conceived.

490
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,603
But

491
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:46,402
she had a miscarriage.

492
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,345
We were shocked.

493
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,068
Then after

494
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:59,838
two years, we did the planning
and tried again.

495
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:03,550
But we failed.

496
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:06,127
She could conceive but couldn't
bear it.

497
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:09,865
I kept struggling.

498
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,710
I consulted many doctors.

499
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,812
The doctor asked us
not to try any more.

500
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,262
I kept trying to keep her happy.

501
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,003
The psychologist said

502
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,388
everything will be fine if we

503
00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:32,637
both of you can stay together
happily but make sure

504
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,218
that she doesn't get
pregnant again.

505
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,435
We accepted it and started living
happily.

506
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:46,990
After a few years,

507
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,365
we made a mistake.

508
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,327
She conceived again.

509
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:53,168
I understood that was a mistake.

510
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:55,458
I asked her to abort it.

511
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,990
But she didn't listen to me.

512
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,487
She wanted to try it for the
last time.

513
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:04,720
It didn't work out.

514
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:08,158
We lost.

515
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:15,747
She is now a patient of acute
depression

516
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,308
for so many years.

517
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,792
Sorry, sir.

518
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:38,907
I didn't want you to express
all this.

519
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:46,698
You didn't make me do it.

520
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,468
I did it.

521
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:04,042
You know, what feels bad?

522
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,383
I became

523
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,663
very lonely.

524
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:16,322
There wasn't a thing that I didn't
share with Jonaki.

525
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,000
There are so many things I want
to say for so many years.

526
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:25,473
I sometimes feel

527
00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:28,770
that I have been
carrying it around.

528
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:35,662
But I never cheated on her.

529
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,933
Jonaki, our home,

530
00:41:41,315 --> 00:41:42,785
and work.

531
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:46,353
That's all my life is about.

532
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:49,520
I won't ever express these things

533
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:52,027
in my life.

534
00:41:52,822 --> 00:41:54,798
That's become a problem.

535
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,372
I used to be so angry before.

536
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,970
Then I kept my pain aside

537
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:04,660
and started working.

538
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:06,143
That's what I did.

539
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:11,038
She used to sing so well.

540
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,962
She stopped singing.

541
00:42:14,503 --> 00:42:16,290
She didn't do anything.

542
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:19,720
If she had,

543
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:22,593
then she would have been better.

544
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,657
I am always there for her.

545
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:29,925
But for me,

546
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:34,848
nobody is there.

547
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,688
I sometimes feel

548
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,095
that I should renounce everything.

549
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:44,567
There is a huge problem at home
as I am not there.

550
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:47,298
Once I return,

551
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:50,593
everything will

552
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,775
be fine.

553
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:56,315
You know what the

554
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,658
secret is.

555
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:04,093
I would always be there for her.

556
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:07,003
But even I need support.

557
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,795
That's why I need the job
and come on tours like this.

558
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:15,625
I know.

559
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:18,335
I know I could give more time

560
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:20,935
to her at home if I quit the job.

561
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:28,187
We could live with the savings
I have.

562
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:31,475
But it would have ruined me.

563
00:43:34,937 --> 00:43:36,432
When I am at home,

564
00:43:37,735 --> 00:43:39,025
I accept everything.

565
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:44,670
I get away for some time
after a while for my salvation.

566
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,538
I am sorry.

567
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:54,113
I am really sorry.

568
00:43:56,323 --> 00:43:58,023
I go home because of her.

569
00:43:59,525 --> 00:44:01,398
But I also get away because of her.

570
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:15,483
It's quite late.

571
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,568
Did you want to make a call?

572
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,280
There is no network here.

573
00:44:19,435 --> 00:44:21,253
No, I don't want to make a call.

574
00:44:23,543 --> 00:44:25,943
Go to sleep.
- Pour me a last drink.

575
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:28,753
I am asking you to sleep.
- Pour a drink.

576
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,310
That's not right, Mr Sen.

577
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,165
This is the last one.

578
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:04,733
Bhaskar.

579
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:12,350
Bhaskar!

580
00:45:13,118 --> 00:45:14,267
Bhaskar!

581
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:16,928
Bhaskar!

582
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,868
Bhaskar!

583
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,673
Bhaskar!

584
00:45:22,702 --> 00:45:24,698
Bhaskar!

585
00:45:29,182 --> 00:45:30,772
How far is the hospital from here?

586
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,043
It's very far.
It's near Ben's house.

587
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,965
Take hot water in the flask.

588
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:36,367
Let's take the car.

589
00:45:36,622 --> 00:45:38,093
Okay, sir.

590
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:56,067
(Local language)

591
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:58,535
(Local language)
- Hello.

592
00:45:58,718 --> 00:46:01,018
(Local language)
- Can you hear me?

593
00:46:01,187 --> 00:46:03,878
Hello!
- His name is Bhaskar.

594
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:09,780
Bhaskar?

595
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:12,075
Bhaskar?

596
00:46:12,558 --> 00:46:14,098
Bhaskar! Can you hear me?
- Bhaskar.

597
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,188
Bhaskar!

598
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:17,115
(Local language)

599
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:18,858
Let's go out. Micheal.

600
00:46:32,313 --> 00:46:35,030
Ben, is there a toilet here?

601
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,077
Please manage on the streets.

602
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,905
Is there no other hospital here?

603
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,128
No, sir. This is the only one.

604
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:20,845
Sir.

605
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:50,635
Sorry, sir.

606
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:51,443
(Local language)

607
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:52,790
He passed away.

608
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:56,193
What do you mean by passed away?

609
00:47:57,905 --> 00:48:00,070
Did he have fits before?

610
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:02,863
(Local language)

611
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,670
Cardiac arrest.

612
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,777
(Local language)

613
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:19,030
(Local language)

614
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:20,972
(Local language)

615
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,217
We have to make a call
to the office.

616
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:06,083
The doctor would give a death
certificate, right?

617
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:07,680
Yes, sir.

618
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:10,433
Sir.

619
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:13,808
We should let his family know.

620
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:20,378
People at the office would
arrange for it.

621
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:25,935
We should leave soon.

622
00:49:26,515 --> 00:49:28,188
There would be too many formalities
at the airport.

623
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,592
Don't be late.

624
00:49:31,995 --> 00:49:35,480
Sir, it would take some time to
get the certificate.

625
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,893
How would you take him down?

626
00:49:39,388 --> 00:49:40,643
Ambulance.

627
00:49:42,152 --> 00:49:43,645
And then?

628
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,515
(Local language)

629
00:50:50,073 --> 00:50:52,073
(Local language)

630
00:50:51,668 --> 00:50:52,988
(Local language)

631
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,138
(Local language)

632
00:50:55,812 --> 00:50:57,595
(Local language)

633
00:53:05,005 --> 00:53:06,978
Raju, should I open the gate?

634
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:08,957
Would you take the payment today?

635
00:53:09,305 --> 00:53:11,322
I have been asking for a week.
Did you get the time now?

636
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,015
I couldn't get it due to the rain.

637
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:14,435
I will get it later.

638
00:53:32,683 --> 00:53:34,365
You got up so early?

639
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:44,380
How is she? Did she get up?
- She would.

640
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,968
I am making coffee.

641
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:02,545
Sir.

642
00:55:03,308 --> 00:55:05,440
I need leaves for a few days.

643
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,095
It's been a while that you
came back.

644
00:55:08,863 --> 00:55:10,700
Let me go home now.

645
00:55:11,445 --> 00:55:12,562
Let me think.

646
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:16,915
Get me the coffee. I will take it.
And give me tea.

647
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,650
Listen.

648
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:21,527
The way she has been acting after
you returned,

649
00:55:22,097 --> 00:55:24,207
I couldn't have dealt with it
if you had not been here.

650
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:27,270
She didn't take the medicines
last night.

651
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,417
She wakes up in the middle
of the night.

652
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,023
I couldn't sleep last night.

653
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:36,428
I won't go to office today.
Get some sleep in the afternoon.

654
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:42,120
Get some sleep in the afternoon.
One can't sleep at that hour.

655
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,508
What happened? You are
still lying down?

656
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,125
Get up.

657
00:55:55,672 --> 00:55:57,145
Good morning.

658
00:56:00,962 --> 00:56:02,948
What? Good morning.

659
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:05,123
Get up!

660
00:56:13,042 --> 00:56:15,042
Good morning.

661
00:56:28,337 --> 00:56:29,658
Biscuits?

662
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,197
Not those.

663
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:34,180
Get me cookies.

664
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:57,267
You were angry with me
yesterday, right?

665
00:57:00,272 --> 00:57:02,085
I know I just lost it.

666
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:06,065
You didn't take your medicines.

667
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:09,468
They are of no use.

668
00:57:09,945 --> 00:57:12,815
You must take them every day.
You can't skip it.

669
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,608
Don't irritate me in the morning.

670
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:19,448
Manju is just like you.

671
00:57:21,535 --> 00:57:23,695
You have trained her
and you go away.

672
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:26,102
And she irritates me.

673
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:35,425
What will you have in the afternoon?
- Good morning.

674
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:37,068
Good morning.

675
00:57:37,578 --> 00:57:38,763
Are you fine now?

676
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:40,927
Yes, tell me.

677
00:57:41,418 --> 00:57:42,702
What should I say?

678
00:57:43,247 --> 00:57:44,478
You are not saying anything.

679
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:47,853
I can't say it over a call.

680
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,073
I get it.

681
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:52,625
That means you are not going to
the office today as well.

682
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:55,990
No, I will be at home.

683
00:57:57,633 --> 00:57:59,107
Okay, bye. I am coming over.

684
00:58:03,008 --> 00:58:04,532
Have you quit your job?

685
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:08,195
No, I let them know.

686
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,228
I don't think I can join work soon.

687
00:58:19,132 --> 00:58:20,798
Actually,

688
00:58:22,343 --> 00:58:24,398
I can't imagine going there.

689
00:58:25,787 --> 00:58:27,578
Seems to be quite impossible.

690
00:58:28,152 --> 00:58:29,803
Was there any problem at the
airport?

691
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:33,643
No, the client helped us

692
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:36,698
a lot with that.

693
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:39,808
He helped us at the airport.

694
00:58:40,355 --> 00:58:41,602
Is he a localite?

695
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,110
Yes.

696
00:58:44,645 --> 00:58:46,660
Our driver was very helpful.

697
00:58:46,993 --> 00:58:50,333
His daughter is an air hostess.
She informed the airport staff.

698
00:58:50,552 --> 00:58:53,258
They really helped with post mortem.

699
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:55,740
Formalities and everything.

700
00:58:56,323 --> 00:58:58,562
Did you meet his family members?

701
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:10,718
I can't do that.

702
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:17,403
His family members came
to the airport.

703
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,905
I didn't meet them.

704
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:23,405
I left in the office car.

705
00:59:29,615 --> 00:59:30,995
Does Jonaki know?

706
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:38,430
No.

707
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,877
How is she?

708
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,833
Who?
- Jonaki.

709
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:47,753
Is she fine?

710
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:50,775
She is fine.

711
00:59:51,103 --> 00:59:53,008
She is positive I feel.

712
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,393
Why are you smiling?

713
00:59:58,588 --> 01:00:00,017
I am your brother.

714
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,193
Why do you get formal with me?

715
01:00:03,477 --> 01:00:08,172
I understand that you had to face it
and now you are at home.

716
01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:09,893
Speak up.

717
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:12,673
You started it again.

718
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:15,468
You think a lot.

719
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:17,083
That's the problem.

720
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:18,993
Everyone thinks a lot.

721
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:20,688
But you are fine.

722
01:00:20,907 --> 01:00:23,523
Right? You are ignoring it
at this age.

723
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,662
You drink every day.

724
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:28,645
When did you get yourself checked
for sugar the last time?

725
01:00:38,488 --> 01:00:40,970
Is this the rebellion from college?

726
01:00:42,113 --> 01:00:43,693
Or is it your will to die?

727
01:00:46,078 --> 01:00:47,358
She got up.

728
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:58,175
The water is getting hot.

729
01:00:58,265 --> 01:01:00,813
Have a shower. I'll serve the food.

730
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,728
Give me some fruit juice.

731
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:12,650
Fruit juice at this time?
- Good morning.

732
01:01:12,945 --> 01:01:14,925
You said you were hungry.
- What?

733
01:01:16,158 --> 01:01:18,920
When did you come?
- A while back. Did you get up now?

734
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:22,213
Yes, it's been raining
since morning.

735
01:01:22,505 --> 01:01:24,515
I was feeling lazy.

736
01:01:30,725 --> 01:01:32,443
Okay. I am going to leave.

737
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,255
What?
- Won't you have lunch?

738
01:01:34,438 --> 01:01:36,237
No. I said I would be back
before lunch break at office.

739
01:01:36,435 --> 01:01:38,463
I have a meeting after that.
- What is this?

740
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,965
I asked Manju to cook 'khichdi'.

741
01:01:41,227 --> 01:01:42,337
Leave after lunch.

742
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:49,063
Would there be a fry? I need an egg.
- You'd get fish and egg.

743
01:01:50,317 --> 01:01:51,768
Have a seat. I will serve it.

744
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:18,177
Raju, here's the money for
the newspaper.

745
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,700
I am in a hurry.
I will take it later.

746
01:04:04,158 --> 01:04:05,770
I washed the curtains.

747
01:04:06,908 --> 01:04:08,468
Even the table cover.

748
01:04:19,343 --> 01:04:21,503
Do you need a recipe
for cooking this?

749
01:04:22,707 --> 01:04:24,145
Will you please keep quiet?

750
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:27,060
I keep quiet when you are not there.

751
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:30,440
Who can I speak to in this house?

752
01:04:52,438 --> 01:04:53,758
Good morning.

753
01:05:05,577 --> 01:05:07,875
Can I get some tea?
- Yes.

754
01:05:50,908 --> 01:05:53,383
Stop cleaning and take a shower.

755
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,328
Here.

756
01:06:34,045 --> 01:06:36,933
A dish made by the recipe
given to us at our wedding.

757
01:06:39,522 --> 01:06:41,510
Won't you go to work?

758
01:06:46,157 --> 01:06:48,530
Is there a problem that
I am at home?

759
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,733
There is no problem.

760
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,060
What have you done to yourself?

761
01:07:02,253 --> 01:07:04,288
Is something wrong to work?

762
01:07:05,963 --> 01:07:07,963
No.

763
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,710
You don't usually stay at home.

764
01:07:11,993 --> 01:07:13,620
I don't remember the last time

765
01:07:14,265 --> 01:07:16,163
you took leave.

766
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:19,563
But now you are at home
all day long.

767
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Ma'am.

768
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,165
Have lunch as he made it with love.

769
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:25,753
Please stop it.

770
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:27,958
There is so much talk in the house.

771
01:07:28,495 --> 01:07:29,612
So much noise.

772
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,438
I can hear it clearly.

773
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,243
You know that I am not
used to this.

774
01:07:43,255 --> 01:07:45,915
What have I done that
I usually don't?

775
01:07:47,893 --> 01:07:49,708
You saw that I was sleeping.

776
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:53,717
Why did you draw the curtains then?

777
01:07:55,213 --> 01:07:57,385
The light gave me a headache.

778
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:00,767
It was quite late.

779
01:08:02,698 --> 01:08:05,093
You weren't sleeping.
- That doesn't matter.

780
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:06,873
I was lying down.

781
01:08:07,935 --> 01:08:09,578
What is your problem?

782
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:12,097
Do you lie down with me?

783
01:08:14,378 --> 01:08:17,047
Do you remember when we slept
together the last time?

784
01:08:20,235 --> 01:08:22,010
It's a problem for me

785
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:24,658
when you turn on the light
to read a book.

786
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,673
When you get up early
in the morning.

787
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,658
It bothers me.

788
01:08:32,463 --> 01:08:35,268
You have never adjusted
in your life.

789
01:08:38,165 --> 01:08:40,783
That's why you don't have to do
it now.

790
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,813
Calm down and have food.

791
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,543
I don't feel like.

792
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,615
You forced me to eat.

793
01:09:01,197 --> 01:09:02,577
Have lunch.

794
01:09:04,842 --> 01:09:06,137
I would sit by you.

795
01:09:08,928 --> 01:09:10,395
Save some for me.

796
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,713
I would have it.

797
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:49,105
She wants coffee.

798
01:09:49,563 --> 01:09:50,803
I won't make it.

799
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,288
Don't laugh. I won't make it.

800
01:09:55,245 --> 01:09:56,430
Make it.

801
01:09:57,385 --> 01:10:00,070
That would make her stay awake
for long.

802
01:10:00,523 --> 01:10:03,208
She would sleep. Don't mind.

803
01:10:03,545 --> 01:10:05,175
She is asking for coffee

804
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,565
for a reason.

805
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:08,992
It's because you are here.

806
01:10:09,147 --> 01:10:11,368
She is showing you that
she is awake. - Manju.

807
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,967
Don't talk like that. That's your
problem.

808
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:15,518
That's true.

809
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:18,713
She doesn't take the medicines as
prescribed by the doctor.

810
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,760
She takes it when she wants.

811
01:10:21,127 --> 01:10:22,498
The same thing again.

812
01:10:22,948 --> 01:10:24,948
What do you mean?

813
01:10:24,235 --> 01:10:26,602
Yes, that's the problem.

814
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,783
You are always at home. That's why
she can't take the medicines.

815
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,950
You don't get it. That's why
I had to spell it out for you.

816
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,197
Why didn't you stop her?

817
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:35,478
That's strange.

818
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,338
Don't you know her?

819
01:10:55,435 --> 01:10:57,435
What happened?

820
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:01,845
What happened?

821
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,892
All the medicines are there.

822
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:07,073
None has gotten over.

823
01:11:07,788 --> 01:11:09,735
I would get more if they were.

824
01:11:10,258 --> 01:11:12,893
I want to see the prescription.
- What prescription?

825
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,418
What is this?
- You're taking more sleeping pills.

826
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:18,515
There are two strips missing.
- I don't take them.

827
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:20,873
I don't take them.
- Don't lie to me.

828
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,278
You are lying to me every day.

829
01:11:23,465 --> 01:11:26,948
I should stop going to office
and stay back home every day

830
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,085
and look after you.

831
01:11:28,365 --> 01:11:30,405
Who told you all this?
- Nonsense.

832
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,270
That old woman.
- The same thing again.

833
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:35,280
She let you know everything once
you returned.

834
01:11:35,678 --> 01:11:37,102
What happened to her today?

835
01:11:37,587 --> 01:11:39,683
Wait.
- Listen!

836
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:41,685
Hey.

837
01:11:42,077 --> 01:11:43,195
Jonaki.

838
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:46,268
Jonaki. - You still have a habit
of telling my husband about me.

839
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:47,792
Jonaki, what's happening?

840
01:11:47,882 --> 01:11:49,770
You came here when my
mother-in-law was there. - Come.

841
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,860
Then you stayed back.

842
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:53,090
I asked you to mind your business.

843
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,788
Don't take yourself to be the
owner of the house.

844
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,145
What is happening? Go inside.

845
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:00,868
You want to see
the medicines, right?

846
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:02,148
You want a count.

847
01:12:09,062 --> 01:12:10,265
You want to see
the medicines, right?

848
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:11,858
Here you go.

849
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:16,782
Here.

850
01:12:21,228 --> 01:12:22,680
So many medicines.

851
01:12:24,398 --> 01:12:25,680
All over.

852
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,758
I told you that they are all over.

853
01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:31,008
I can't do it any more.

854
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,890
I have a terrible headache.

855
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:39,560
I couldn't sleep for two nights.

856
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:45,088
I can't bear it any more.

857
01:12:47,465 --> 01:12:49,915
My head is aching a lot.

858
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:55,503
I can't bear it any more.

859
01:13:32,977 --> 01:13:36,117
Here you go. The medicines and
the bill.

860
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:42,383
She is still sleeping.

861
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:47,723
Do you want something?

862
01:13:48,952 --> 01:13:50,910
You wanted to go home, right?
You may.

863
01:13:51,185 --> 01:13:53,412
I would go later.
- No, you may go.

864
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:55,750
Would you be able to manage alone?

865
01:14:15,138 --> 01:14:20,300
"It's raining."

866
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:28,900
"It's pouring heavily."

867
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:36,658
"It's raining."

868
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:45,113
"It's thundering."

869
01:14:45,378 --> 01:14:47,167
"It's raining."

870
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,288
You didn't tell me a story
after returning this time.

871
01:14:52,553 --> 01:14:54,793
There is no story to be told.

872
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:02,605
I understand when you
hide something.

873
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:04,705
You know that.

874
01:15:07,627 --> 01:15:10,378
I felt that I haven't taken leaves
in a long time.

875
01:15:12,135 --> 01:15:16,232
That's why I informed them that
I won't come to work for a week.

876
01:15:17,133 --> 01:15:18,898
You took a leave for that.

877
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:20,997
"It's raining."

878
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,803
Yes.
- You are lying again.

879
01:15:25,193 --> 01:15:27,323
"It's raining."

880
01:15:27,413 --> 01:15:28,910
Here.

881
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,990
Why did you play

882
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,145
this song all of a sudden?

883
01:15:34,288 --> 01:15:35,943
When you went away this time,

884
01:15:37,102 --> 01:15:39,510
it was raining all day long.

885
01:15:40,365 --> 01:15:43,133
I have been missing this song
since then.

886
01:15:45,853 --> 01:15:47,688
You used to sing this song.

887
01:15:48,823 --> 01:15:50,977
Picnic, get together,

888
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:52,788
on all occasions.

889
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:56,948
Have it.

890
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:01,697
I asked you to have it yourself.

891
01:16:02,235 --> 01:16:05,245
You act so childishly at times
as if you are sick.

892
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,123
I am not sick. I am disturbed.

893
01:16:09,082 --> 01:16:10,120
You are crazy.

894
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,265
That's what I said.

895
01:16:21,145 --> 01:16:22,535
Listen.

896
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,458
You didn't tell me the story.

897
01:16:29,268 --> 01:16:31,373
You used to tell me
everything earlier.

898
01:16:33,597 --> 01:16:35,035
Who do you tell it to now?

899
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:43,617
I haven't in a long time.

900
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,923
Nobody is there to hear it.

901
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,545
"It's raining."

902
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:57,098
"The monsoon is on its way."

903
01:16:57,328 --> 01:17:00,665
"The monsoon is on its way."

904
01:17:00,755 --> 01:17:03,798
"It makes me happy."

905
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:08,778
"The monsoon is on its way."

906
01:17:09,728 --> 01:17:18,258
"The monsoon is on its way."

907
01:17:18,452 --> 01:17:23,372
"The monsoon is on its way."

908
01:17:23,565 --> 01:17:27,988
"The monsoon is on its way."

909
01:17:40,617 --> 01:17:42,830
Why didn't you tell me about it?

910
01:17:43,303 --> 01:17:45,080
Why didn't you tell me?

911
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:48,005
The strangers are your own.
- "It makes me happy."

912
01:17:48,688 --> 01:17:50,483
Am I no one to you?

913
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:54,180
You called me.
- "The monsoon is on its way."

914
01:17:54,858 --> 01:17:57,605
"It makes me happy."

915
01:17:57,695 --> 01:18:04,388
"My friends are singing out of
happiness."

916
01:18:04,478 --> 01:18:11,892
"My friends are singing out of
happiness."

917
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,050
Hello.

918
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,990
Sanjit.
- Biplab.

919
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:43,295
When did you come?
- A while back.

920
01:18:44,488 --> 01:18:46,345
How are you now?
- I am fine.

921
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:50,932
Listen. Ask Kajal to take the bills
of the tour from me.

922
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,373
Okay. That can be done later.

923
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:55,778
Okay?
- No, take it.

924
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,607
Bye.
- Okay.

925
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:38,245
I had called.

926
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:41,868
Arup said he is in trouble.
Just leave him alone.

927
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,145
That's why I didn't.

928
01:19:46,427 --> 01:19:48,730
I do understand what you are
going through.

929
01:19:51,472 --> 01:19:52,910
Just take it easy.

930
01:19:55,393 --> 01:19:58,565
If you need more leaves,

931
01:19:59,672 --> 01:20:00,878
don't hesitate.

932
01:20:08,545 --> 01:20:11,288
I still can't process it.

933
01:20:11,695 --> 01:20:13,890
It's just so unfor...
- What will happen to the project?

934
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:17,687
I haven't blocked any site.

935
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,040
What do you think?

936
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,555
Am I worried about the project?

937
01:20:23,538 --> 01:20:25,698
We have a goodwill in the market.

938
01:20:26,575 --> 01:20:28,393
Trust me. I can handle this.

939
01:20:29,843 --> 01:20:31,738
I just want you to be okay.

940
01:20:36,693 --> 01:20:38,470
I went there.

941
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:41,503
It was just unbearable.

942
01:20:46,243 --> 01:20:48,243
Where?

943
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,305
Bhaskar's home.

944
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,318
What happened?

945
01:20:59,613 --> 01:21:01,063
I am hungry.

946
01:21:01,713 --> 01:21:03,380
Will you have lunch with me?

947
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,077
No.

948
01:21:06,692 --> 01:21:08,368
I need some crowd.

949
01:21:15,263 --> 01:21:17,205
Mr Pandey, did you get the food?

950
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,900
Keep it in the pantry.

951
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,370
At Mr Sen's table.

952
01:21:21,803 --> 01:21:23,237
You too have lunch.

953
01:21:52,872 --> 01:21:54,872
For how will you be here?

954
01:21:54,307 --> 01:21:56,580
I will be here. Why? Do you
want to go out?

955
01:21:57,055 --> 01:21:59,735
No, Shyamal wanted some help.

956
01:21:59,825 --> 01:22:01,463
I would leave after that.

957
01:22:05,975 --> 01:22:07,017
Let's go.

958
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,380
Did all of you go?

959
01:22:50,335 --> 01:22:52,025
I went once.

960
01:22:52,383 --> 01:22:53,802
On the day of the cremation.

961
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,363
Mohur is going there frequently.

962
01:22:56,735 --> 01:22:57,783
Good.

963
01:22:58,533 --> 01:22:59,992
That's good.

964
01:23:01,363 --> 01:23:03,583
I haven't met his wife yet.

965
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:05,607
She wasn't there that day.

966
01:23:06,673 --> 01:23:08,745
I think I am going to see her
one of these days.

967
01:23:09,665 --> 01:23:11,475
I am feeling like seeing her.

968
01:23:14,348 --> 01:23:17,395
Mohur said the child is sweet.

969
01:23:19,145 --> 01:23:20,583
Child?

970
01:23:23,982 --> 01:23:26,390
Whose?
- Don't you know?

971
01:23:28,088 --> 01:23:31,545
The day you returned. He had a
daughter the day after.

972
01:23:33,598 --> 01:23:35,267
I think you should go and see her.

973
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:39,745
She was asking about you.

974
01:23:41,278 --> 01:23:42,780
Why did he go in such a situation?

975
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,450
One second.

976
01:23:48,145 --> 01:23:49,362
Yes, Mr Anoop. Tell me.

977
01:23:51,908 --> 01:23:54,028
What's the problem? I mailed you.

978
01:23:54,803 --> 01:23:57,518
Please check your old records.

979
01:23:58,483 --> 01:23:59,855
We have been associated...

980
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:20,882
Yes, tell me.

981
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,382
Has Manju left?

982
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:25,622
Yes, she left a while back.

983
01:26:25,938 --> 01:26:27,453
Why? Do you need anything?

984
01:26:28,123 --> 01:26:30,063
No. That's fine.

985
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:31,815
I would come home late.

986
01:26:33,682 --> 01:26:34,968
Is everything fine?

987
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,720
Yes.

988
01:26:37,563 --> 01:26:39,563
Bye.

989
01:26:47,753 --> 01:26:49,820
Where is Mitra press?

990
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:53,380
Take a left from that lane.
- Thank you.

991
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:15,853
The girl is so sweet, right?
- Yes.

992
01:28:16,095 --> 01:28:17,435
What happened?

993
01:28:17,843 --> 01:28:19,315
Nothing.

994
01:28:20,343 --> 01:28:21,938
Wait.

995
01:28:27,323 --> 01:28:28,493
Wait.

996
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:30,260
Don't do this.

997
01:28:40,893 --> 01:28:42,313
Are you from Bhaskar's office?

998
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,037
Biplab, right?

999
01:28:49,493 --> 01:28:51,430
I am his uncle. Nitai.

1000
01:28:52,418 --> 01:28:54,190
Greetings.

1001
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:56,528
Ruma.

1002
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,217
Yes.

1003
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:01,263
Tell me.
- Biplab.

1004
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,100
From Shonai's office.

1005
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:05,547
Hey.
- Come.

1006
01:29:22,995 --> 01:29:25,700
I asked everyone about you.

1007
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:28,878
Why didn't you come?

1008
01:29:32,523 --> 01:29:35,867
I heard that you have become
weak after returning.

1009
01:29:37,457 --> 01:29:38,992
Obviously.

1010
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,932
It must have affected you a lot.

1011
01:29:47,338 --> 01:29:48,740
Thank you for coming.

1012
01:29:50,773 --> 01:29:52,150
For everything.

1013
01:29:58,862 --> 01:30:01,660
You brought him with much care.

1014
01:30:03,128 --> 01:30:04,657
I couldn't see him.

1015
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:06,713
I was in the hospital.

1016
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,503
I heard it from everyone.

1017
01:30:15,463 --> 01:30:17,503
You are the last person he met.

1018
01:30:22,678 --> 01:30:25,425
You know how long I have been
waiting to see you?

1019
01:30:27,182 --> 01:30:30,272
He gave me your phone number

1020
01:30:30,575 --> 01:30:32,578
before he went on the tour.

1021
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:39,323
I thought about it to call you to
come and see me.

1022
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:41,755
But I didn't.

1023
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,262
I knew that you would come.

1024
01:30:46,645 --> 01:30:48,450
For our daughter at least.

1025
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:04,038
I didn't know that you had a child.

1026
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:08,075
I got to know about

1027
01:31:09,033 --> 01:31:10,875
it today at the office.

1028
01:31:14,995 --> 01:31:17,283
He told me a lot of things.

1029
01:31:19,883 --> 01:31:22,445
But he didn't tell us

1030
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:27,738
that his wife was expecting.

1031
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:32,737
If we knew...

1032
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:38,855
I know.

1033
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:41,723
He was a little crazy.

1034
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,698
He was not sure of leaving as well.

1035
01:31:47,262 --> 01:31:49,648
He had just joined the company.

1036
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,947
He was going on a big tour
for the first time.

1037
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:58,990
He didn't want to make an excuse
in the beginning.

1038
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,195
Even I had asked him to go.

1039
01:32:05,858 --> 01:32:07,595
What would happen?

1040
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,282
I was given a date for the delivery.

1041
01:32:10,847 --> 01:32:13,248
He was returning two days before.

1042
01:32:14,698 --> 01:32:17,193
I would have been admitted after
he returned.

1043
01:32:17,678 --> 01:32:19,488
And delivery the next day.

1044
01:32:19,973 --> 01:32:21,933
He had decided

1045
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:25,147
to work very hard for one year.

1046
01:32:25,768 --> 01:32:28,248
It was all really really well
planned.

1047
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:43,195
(Local language)

1048
01:32:43,343 --> 01:32:45,367
(Local language)

1049
01:32:45,545 --> 01:32:47,525
(Local language)

1050
01:32:50,822 --> 01:32:53,155
Mom?
- Yes.

1051
01:32:53,993 --> 01:32:56,120
My mom and dad have come down?

1052
01:32:57,070 --> 01:33:00,055
They really wanted me to have
the baby in Siliguri.

1053
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:02,585
But

1054
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:05,775
Bhaskar and I wanted to stay
together here

1055
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:07,820
at the time of the delivery.

1056
01:33:08,013 --> 01:33:09,763
That's why mom and dad
have come here.

1057
01:33:11,228 --> 01:33:14,403
My in-laws are not letting me
go away.

1058
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:16,693
Mother-in-law

1059
01:33:16,837 --> 01:33:18,858
has asked me not to leave
at least for 3 months.

1060
01:33:30,753 --> 01:33:32,403
He had told me.

1061
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:37,723
That he would get you in this house
after he returns.

1062
01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:47,382
I am so happy to have met him.

1063
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:49,982
And spent so much of time with him.

1064
01:33:54,075 --> 01:33:55,732
He was like a kid.

1065
01:34:04,437 --> 01:34:06,112
I was a nobody to him.

1066
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:08,947
He was still bothered about me.

1067
01:34:12,373 --> 01:34:13,768
I told him

1068
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:16,635
everything about me.

1069
01:34:20,933 --> 01:34:22,367
When he got to know that I
don't have a child,

1070
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:28,063
he didn't tell me that he is
going to be a father.

1071
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,652
Have tea.

1072
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:45,593
I must leave.

1073
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:48,135
Wait for a while.

1074
01:35:06,653 --> 01:35:09,495
(Local language)

1075
01:35:12,317 --> 01:35:13,837
(Local language)

1076
01:35:14,162 --> 01:35:16,030
(Local language)
- Mithu.

1077
01:35:16,182 --> 01:35:17,255
(Local language)

1078
01:35:17,665 --> 01:35:18,893
(Local language)

1079
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,268
(Local language)
- Ask him to shut it.

1080
01:35:22,435 --> 01:35:24,248
(Local language)

1081
01:36:09,392 --> 01:36:11,340
He loved rains.

1082
01:36:12,923 --> 01:36:15,227
And music was everything for him.

1083
01:36:16,367 --> 01:36:18,375
He had named her,

1084
01:36:19,763 --> 01:36:21,028
Karjari.

1085
01:37:00,378 --> 01:37:01,530
Won't you eat?

1086
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:05,598
It's late.

1087
01:37:12,263 --> 01:37:13,863
Manju had called.

1088
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,300
She boarded the train.

1089
01:37:27,997 --> 01:37:29,573
Will you sing a song for me?

1090
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:34,625
Song?

1091
01:37:35,043 --> 01:37:36,315
You are crazy.

1092
01:37:38,215 --> 01:37:39,872
Let's have dinner.

1093
01:37:40,795 --> 01:37:42,210
Sing karjari.

1094
01:37:44,028 --> 01:37:45,833
I feel like listening to it.

1095
01:37:47,025 --> 01:37:49,065
What is all this?

1096
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,118
Sit.

1097
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:02,410
Have a seat.

1098
01:38:11,907 --> 01:38:13,575
Please sing to me.

1099
01:38:26,337 --> 01:38:28,337
Hey.

1100
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:44,783
"It's raining."

1101
01:38:46,615 --> 01:38:53,878
"It's pouring heavily."
