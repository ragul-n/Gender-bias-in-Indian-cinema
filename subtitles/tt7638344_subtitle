00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,710
Please

19
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,540
No

20
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,720
Please

21
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,210
Please

22
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,040
Then see it...

23
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,550
you are seeing
my face since childhood

24
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,650
Brother, she came in my dreams

25
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,250
She comes daily anyway

26
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,170
think of the almighty
god someday maybe

27
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,140
this time she was saying,
I will win the competition

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,720
and she will give
me the prize personally

29
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,370
You will win only if you reach

30
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,410
You are late idiot, let's go

31
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,190
What?

32
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,660
c'mon you are late already

33
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,910
You start the bike I'll come

34
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,000
Where are you going?

35
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
PSYLLIUM

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,000
Competition is at its peak!

37
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,720
Manish is stuffing the
spicy-snack and so is Devilal

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,370
And Bheema has blasted his burp...

39
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,830
Bheema's wife Kajri is
expecting in the hospital

40
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,470
but today his stomach
appears as if he is also expecting

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,910
He has stuffed all the spicy-snacks...

42
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,040
And here comes Madhukar Bagla,
alarming everyone alert

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,790
Madhu has arrived,
Devilal is on his last piece of snack

44
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,580
One after another snacks are
making their ways to his stomach

45
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,750
Madhu, eat them all....

46
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,750
long live mother India...

47
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,970
You idiot, what has mother
India got to do with a spicy-snack!

48
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,190
buzz off...

49
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,790
Gulp faster faster!
Bheema, Devilal, Manish

50
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,910
This is war, the food war

51
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,920
The winner will get a Bihar tour,
looser will get a jail tour.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,460
C'mom Madhu...

53
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,750
Bheema is off towards the sweet-snack
stall, so is Devilal behind him

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,120
Well done Bheema! great job Devilal!

55
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,200
Madhu has geared up now and has made
a fierce attack on the pile of rice

56
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,040
Who do you think will win the race?

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,390
Devilal or...

58
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,000
What the hell are you doing?

59
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,450
You wife is in labor in the hospital
and you are stuffing sweets over hear!

60
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,000
- No mom...
- Come

61
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,810
Enough, let's go

62
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,460
Bheema is out of the race now...

63
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,620
a mother is a nation's pride
and Madhukar is now on a food ride

64
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,530
Who will win the race?

65
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,360
Devilal or Madhu?

66
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,920
Who will win the race?

67
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,330
Who will become Udaipur's Rambo?

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,620
Devilal is charging
towards the chillies

69
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,620
Moving ahead through the pit...

70
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,500
but Purshottam has grabbed him

71
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,620
He is still trying to make his way...

72
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,120
and finally he manages
to throw Purshottam off him

73
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,070
Madhu is charging ahead

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,000
Madhu is going towards the chillies...

75
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,750
and Madhu has arrived
at the chillies stall

76
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,840
These are green spicy chillies

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,410
And meanwhile we have the competition's
special guest of honour Mr Ratan Singh...

78
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,740
his son Roop Singh and the entire
royal family is arriving at the venue

79
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,080
He is going ahead... hurry up

80
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,710
Madhu is running like a cheetah

81
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,580
both are moving towards
the last leap together

82
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,150
Moving ahead

83
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,830
[Indistinct chatter]

84
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,850
Madhu has taken the big leap

85
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,700
Devi has done a crash landing

86
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,780
And Madhu has won
the eat and run race!

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,590
First runner up is Devilal Singh

88
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,730
How are you uncle?

89
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,270
Roop, you hand him the prize

90
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,400

91
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,540
Take this, try to win sometime, aren't
you tired of coming second always!

92
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,670
Sorry brother

93
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,870
Now leave

94
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,040
And the winner is Madhukar Bagla

95
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,410
Winner's envelope
has Rs 250...

96
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,620
a gift hamper from Haldiram

97
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,200
And a branded stand fan
and a mixer grinder from Mr Ratan

98
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,460
Parthavi, you give

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,940
You were gobbling all those chillies!
you are ok right?

100
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,560
Yes yes..

101
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,450
You know English?

102
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,940
Yes yes, of course

103
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,650
Congratulations

104
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,790
Thanks

105
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,660
Keep applauding, lets demonstrate
the strength in our hands

106
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,200
As everyone is aware that Mr Ratan Singh
is standing in the election this time

107
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,870
Mr Ratan Singh,
the mic is all yours now

108
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,570
Applause...

109
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,610
Everyone is pointing fingers at me

110
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,180
Opposition says...

111
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,930
that Ratan Singh is new to politics

112
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,080
They are calling
me a political intern

113
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,440
They have forgotten that
ruling people is in my blood

114
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,000
It was only the public love that
gave my ancestors the status of royals

115
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,910
I too can talk foul
about the opposition

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,090
Sulekha Goenka talks about the
development and progress of Udaipur

117
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,710
But in fact Udaipur's progress lies
in it's sacraments

118
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,170
What about that?

119
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,910
Go and ask her...

120
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,550
whom was her daughter
caught with in Mumbai?

121
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,620
I don't want to tarnish
anyone's reputation

122
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:03,110
but I know how to bend
a finger that's pointing towards me

123
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,470
So Mrs Sulekha Goenka...

124
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,160
you have eaten enough so far

125
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,450
now its time to run away

126
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,570
Long live Ratan Singh

127
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,240
Isn't it cool mom?

128
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,200
Very cool, it's giving very cold air

129
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,410
You are an illiterate!
It's a fan, not an air conditioner

130
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,740
How would I know!

131
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,580
have you ever got
me an air conditioner?

132
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,240
Madhu at least got a fan

133
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,540
And that too a branded one,
the costliest

134
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,740
Shall I call your dad and tell him that
you come here to stalk foreigners?

135
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,120
Do not threaten me uncle,
I am not scared

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,040
Wait...

137
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,620
Okay, relax

138
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,240
What? Stop giggling...

139
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,790
go to the kitchen
and start making dough

140
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,540
Leave

141
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,910
Arvind uncle has sent a
new pair of shirt-pant for you

142
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,620
Wear it during Diwali

143
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,490
- It is very good!
- isn't it?

144
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,790
Call your uncle and thank him

145
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,410
It's looking really nice,
I am trying it now only

146
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,790
I have told you don't
accept any gifts from Arvind

147
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,910
He is my brother, I will

148
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
I don't like him and you know that

149
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,830
I also don't like you,
but one has to redeem a relationship

150
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,750
Leave me then

151
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,120
Is it open yet?

152
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:32,990
Yes yes open

153
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,910
Madhu come fast
customers have arrived

154
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,620
Sit sit, please

155
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,700
Parthavi!

156
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,950
Take it Ambika, you also fire a shot

157
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,370
I don't want to fire

158
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,450
Try it once, it's too much fun

159
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,490
Are you enjoying here?

160
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,870
Yes really enjoying!

161
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,540
This time my father is
standing for the election

162
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,710
Oh wow! That's great!

163
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,340
- This is for you
- Thank you

164
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,660
So all good?

165
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,300
Yeah great, thank you

166
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,740
Good Morning

167
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,370
Good Morning

168
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,040
Hello

169
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,860
All well?

170
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,790
Yes, your son is
taking good care of us

171
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,790
Thank You

172
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,040
Roop I want to have
a word with you, come

173
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,490
Okay enjoy

174
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,880
I'm coming back

175
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,890
You are the owner of this mansion,
not a waiter

176
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,570
Greet the guests, smile at them,
serving beer is not our job

177
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,020
Sorry dad

178
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,450
Go check the preparations
in the office

179
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,200
Yes

180
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,080
Hello uncle

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,160
Bless you

182
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,740
Where are you both going?

183
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,580
pond

184
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
It will be cold

185
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,910
Then put a heater in the pond,
it won't be cold then

186
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,120
But I will go for sure

187
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,200
Sure

188
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,990
Bye dad

189
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,120
Hey

190
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,580
Devi

191
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,380
Come out

192
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,540
What happened?

193
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,950
It's my swimming time

194
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,790
But we just came

195
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,330
So what should I do? C'mon leave

196
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,830
This is not right Parthavi

197
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,140
Then go complain to your parents
Leave now

198
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,160
Let's go

199
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,160
Get out

200
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,040
Look at him

201
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,450
Hey, don't cover your head,
protect your back

202
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,200
There is a hole in your underwear

203
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,490
That white palace behind that
is Jagmandir. You know Jennifer Lopez?

204
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,160
Sure I know

205
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,950
You know Jennifer Lopez!

206
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,120
Jennifer Lopez also came
here to sing and dance...

207
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,120
in a very big wedding
of rich Indian man

208
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,990
Madhu

209
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,580
Madhu!

210
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,890
Parthavi has come at the pond

211
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,370
What is he saying?

212
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,540
Don't know. Say loudly!

213
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,870
Parthavi...

214
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,700
At the pond

215
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,620
Parthavi...

216
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,510
At the pond

217
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,500
Who is that?

218
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,330
He is my friend...

219
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,930
You leave him, here, evening
you should come to my restaurant

220
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,580
Parthavi...

221
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,490
At the pond

222
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,780
Indian Romeo...

223
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,520
You see Taj hotel

224
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,490
Get out

225
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,700
You speak english?

226
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,290
Get out

227
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,470
Calm down...

228
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,300
Madhu!

229
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,260
Mom it's burning badly

230
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,510
Doctor I won't limp right?

231
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,470
I am still a bachelor,
what will the bride's family think!

232
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,340
They won't think anything

233
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,220
Stop your drama, it's a scratch

234
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,380
It's hurting

235
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,580
Might have to amputate

236
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,630
Isn't this the same
shirt your uncle gifted?

237
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,050
Weren't you suppose
to wear it during Diwali!

238
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,880
It is indeed a Diwali for him today

239
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,050
What?

240
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,880
Rubbish

241
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,590
I thought of checking the fittings

242
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,050
Fittings?

243
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,420
Fitting looks great

244
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,470
Rest for half an hour,
then you can go home

245
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,550
Make the payment at the counter

246
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,510
Sure

247
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,470
It is just a scratch

248
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,130
Hello

249
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,920
What did the doctor say?

250
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,840
It's a heart attack,
could slip into a coma

251
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,260
Nothing, just a scratch.
Only two days, I am fine

252
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,340
I came to say sorry

253
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,760
Why are you saying sorry?
The mistake was all mine

254
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,670
But the pond was mine

255
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,970
Let's go Parthavi

256
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,630
You will have tea water anything?

257
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,720
At the clinic?

258
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,510
Yes, our restaurant
does home delivery as well

259
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,590
Well, we too are in first year

260
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,840
Since three years

261
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,920
You-all flunked?

262
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,510
No no, we were waiting

263
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,760
And you?
How long you have been in first year?

264
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,880
He is not in college

265
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,470
He flunked the 12th grade thrice
continuously hence was suspended, isn't it?

266
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,630
Take care. Such stunts might hurt you

267
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,510
Yes yes.

268
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,760
You snake, why are you
spewing venom on my love story

269
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,590
You have no shame or what?
Stalking a child!

270
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,550
Is she your child? your child?

271
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,670
And why were you hitting on my head,
what if my hair would have fallen?

272
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,590
Use a shampoo someday then!

273
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,430
I'll kill you

274
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,220
Entire Rajasthan
knows that you are bald

275
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,510
Table number eight's bill

276
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,800
Hey Gokul

277
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,170
Six breads, one portion red meat,
one lentil

278
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,550
for table number four

279
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,170
Listen

280
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,880
She was Ratan Singh's daughter right?

281
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,340
Yeah

282
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,470
Don't be stupid
You aren't that naive to understand

283
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,760
Those are upper-cast people,
stay away from them

284
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,380
Otherwise we will get into trouble

285
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,760
Understood?

286
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,510
Yes

287
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,840
Swear on me,
you'll stay away from her

288
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,220
What are you doing dad?
Customers are waiting, let me go

289
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,640
You swear on me that
you'll stay away from her

290
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,550
I am not sitting in her lap
I am at a distance!

291
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,430
Dear, the moment she smiles
you will jump into her lap

292
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,340
What is this dad?

293
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,800
Swear on me that you
will stay away from her

294
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,840
You swear on me first

295
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,670
What are you doing?

296
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,300
Swear on me that you'll
stay away from her

297
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,420
I swear on you

298
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,800
Look Madhu...

299
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,170
I said, swear on you

300
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,880
You too are in A division. Let's go

301
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Madhu, check my division as well.

302
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,840
You see on your own.

303
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,220
The board is at a distance and the queue
is long, you check and let me know

304
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,630
Make way guys, respect a senior!

305
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,130
Miss Ambika,
you both are also in A division

306
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,260
What happened?

307
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,510
Manik Sisodia

308
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,220
Present sir

309
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,550
Madhukar Bagla

310
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
Present sir

311
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
Nakul Khaitan

312
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,420
Present sir

313
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,670
Parthavi Singh

314
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,340
Parthavi Singh!!

315
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,670
Present sir

316
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,090
Where is your attention?

317
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,970
My attention is all here only,
you continue

318
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,970
- Radhika Zawar
- Present sir

319
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,970
What's your name?

320
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,340
Purshottam,
but I am known as 'the wall' also

321
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,130
You don't belong to this class!

322
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,720
Sir I don't belong
to the college also

323
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,130
I flunked the 12th grade,
but I want another chance sir

324
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,910
Go to the principal if
you want another chance. Get out

325
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,760
Sir why you want to go
to the higher authorities?

326
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,970
Let's settle it out here only

327
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,970
Get out

328
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,760
Sir... sir...

329
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,970
Sir I dance very well

330
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,510
I can keep the entertainment
quotient going

331
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,470
Get out

332
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,550
Get out

333
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,510
Okay!

334
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,170
Bye!

335
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,050
College will have to
give me a second chance

336
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,090
Not second, fourth

337
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,800
Listen, go tell Madhu
my bike isn't starting

338
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,420
It did right now

339
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,130
Do as I say

340
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,680
Madhu... bike isn't starting,
please come and help

341
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,970
Ya ya I am coming

342
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,630
Hey Purshottam...

343
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,840
I won't be able to do it...

344
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,550
You should rather call a mechanic

345
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Just a month away. It is imperative
to win the election this time

346
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,090
You will only win Mr Ratan

347
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,800
Everybody is supporting you
in entire Udaipur

348
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,260
I have delivered a
lakh rupees at your house

349
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,910
There wasn't any need of that sir!

350
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,470
It's Roop's birthday three
days prior to the election

351
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,420
You have to give a
birthday present to me

352
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:59,800
Organise a raid at Sulekha's hotel to seize
fake liquor, drugs or whatever you can

353
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,050
But Mr Ratan she is in power

354
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,470
Power is an interesting thing! Today
it's with her, tomorrow it will mine

355
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,760
I am sure you won't
disappoint our friendship

356
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,170
Why did you take the bike?

357
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,090
The keys was on the bike so I took it

358
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,760
Keys were on bike means!
I will slap you if you touch it again

359
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,380
I will. Stop me if you can

360
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,470
Do not mess with me

361
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,840
I will request Ambika to perform
this dance during our honeymoon

362
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,130
She is dancing horribly

363
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,090
Madhu

364
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,720
Stop

365
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I'll get you rusticated from college

366
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,590
Come here

367
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,380
I don't have the whole day
come quickly

368
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,670
Look at me or I'll slap you

369
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,920
Couldn't you hear while I was calling?

370
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,420
I think some dust went into my ears

371
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,630
What? Don't act smart

372
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,340
What are you upto since yesterday?

373
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,510
- No nothing.
- Why aren't you looking at me?

374
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,510
- I am looking at you.
- Why aren't you looking properly?

375
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,760
Yesterday you had braids in your
hair wearing a multicolour dress...

376
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,920
today you are in a suit with open hair,
how else do you want me to look at you?

377
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,630
I am noticing this since yesterday

378
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,470
Why are you putting your
head down the moment I come across?

379
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,970
Why can't you look into my eyes?

380
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,340
- I am looking.
- Madhu!

381
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,720
My dad asked me to stay away from you

382
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,970
What happened?

383
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,090
No nothing...

384
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,760
You are an idealistic child!

385
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,630
One who agrees whatever his dad says!

386
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,720
He made me swear on him,
what could have I done!

387
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,840
Then why are you following me now?
Don't follow me

388
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,380
You already forgot your dad's advice?

389
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,130
Parthavi I'll convince him,
Parthavi sorry

390
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,380
Sorry?

391
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,970
You know what, make a sorry-boat
and throw it in the lake

392
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,260
Now I don't want to talk to you

393
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,920
She is not responding
to my apology what can I do?

394
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,720
Go like Brad Pitt and tell her...

395
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,470
O love of my life!
your lover is searching for you...

396
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,840
Hey, stop giving rubbish idea
Sit down

397
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,130
He is at least giving me an idea

398
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,340
You, on the other hand,
want to just end my love story

399
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,050
Witch!

400
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,130
Treacherous!

401
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,760
Stupid!

402
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,510
Shut up

403
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,920
I have an idea

404
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,880
Lets send a kid to say sorry,
then she won't be able to ignore

405
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,470
what kid!

406
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,760
Kid!

407
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,130
You want?

408
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,950
You are dressed-up as a kid?

409
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,590
Yes. Since there was
no budget for a real kid!

410
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,550
Okay, tell us why are you here?

411
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,630
Madhu is apologising

412
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,130
Why? what did he do?

413
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,800
Because he insulted you

414
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,050
So what if he insulted me?

415
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,090
Go and ask him, who am I to you?

416
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,800
Who am I to you!

417
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,670
Now what can I answer to this?

418
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,380
The entire universe is trying to tell you
mister, that you are one in a million my sister

419
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,050
Hey...

420
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,380
Are you crazy?

421
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,270
I got an idea. Let's go

422
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,560
Is she liking it?

423
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,800
Did she like it?

424
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,720
She loved it!

425
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,970
She hated it! Let's go

426
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,510
Five...

427
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,130
Six...

428
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,510
Four...

429
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,670
Five...

430
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,050
Six...

431
00:32:59,170 --> 00:32:59,840
Four...

432
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,300
Go tell him

433
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,800
I don't want to go
I'm looking like an idiot

434
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,780
You are an idiot. Go now

435
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,670
Parthavi said your
dance is horrible

436
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,720
Answer her question
in a form of a song

437
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,250
Question is still the
same- who am I to you?

438
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,650
Even in a school frock
she is looking like Beyonce

439
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,670
One, two, one two three four...

440
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,670
How can I tell you why I love you,
I can't even if I try

441
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,920
My eyes express the
feelings of my heart to you...

442
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,850
It was no fun!

443
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,880
You know english right?

444
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,220
Sing an english song then,
in front of the whole college

445
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,720
English song! In front of everyone!

446
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,920
You know what,
my friends think you are a coward

447
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,800
Show some courage

448
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,510
Let's go

449
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,300
English song!

450
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,670
What are you doing Madhu?

451
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,510
We will get bashed
if somebody see you.

452
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,840
Don't worry it's not a big thing

453
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,380
I have enough courage

454
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,510
Only the courage will stay

455
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,760
and your picture will be on
the wall with the garland on it

456
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Call her

457
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,510
Can we go from there

458
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,340
Hello Ambika

459
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,170
Purshottam here

460
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,510
Sorry disturbing you this time

461
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,800
I hope there are no
mosqitoes in your room

462
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,630
Listen you mosqitoe come to the point

463
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,550
Ambika just a request

464
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,590
Can you call Parthavi

465
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,510
What happened?

466
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,590
Parthavi, Madhu is at your
terrace right now

467
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,630
Go fast

468
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,260
What?

469
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,800
Hello!!

470
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,130
Hello...

471
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,550
Wow, you are very strong indeed

472
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,920
Strength is in my blood

473
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,170
I am not scared of anyone

474
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,590
Not scared of Roop also?

475
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,550
Why would one be scared of him?

476
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,380
He doesn't even look
like your family member

477
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,470
Was he adopted?

478
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,340
Shut up...

479
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,840
Don't talk non-sense

480
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Sorry. Joking

481
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,840
Why have you come here?

482
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,050
Our class is going
for a picnic tomorrow

483
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:33,840
So?

484
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,130
So what! So you will
get your answer there.

485
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,720
Means?

486
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,800
Means your english song is ready

487
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,800
You'll sing a Justin Bieber song?

488
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,090
Who Bieber?

489
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,630
Leave it.
What song are you going to sing?

490
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,800
I have made for you. A special one

491
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,130
Special?

492
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,170
Special

493
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,420
Sing a line

494
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,920
Nooo....

495
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,090
The fruit of patience is sweet

496
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,300
I'll see you tomorrow

497
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,380
Bye

498
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,970
Roop...

499
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,970
Good joke

500
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:19,970
Courageous!

501
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,090
Good morning

502
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,720
Presenting a song
for your entertainment...

503
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,260
In english

504
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,340
English or hindi it doesn't matter

505
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,920
A donkey will always remain a donkey

506
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,420
Your own face is like a buffalo

507
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,840
Don't you feel ashamed
by calling others a donkey?

508
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,140
One, two... One two three four

509
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,840
How do I tell you, how much
I love you, I will never be able to...

510
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,430
Heart is not stopping,
wants to do talking

511
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,920
please let it come and tell you...

512
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,590
You don't know... You don't know...

513
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,800
You don't know... you don't know...

514
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,120
How do I tell you, how much I
love you, I will never be able to...

515
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,860
Hello?

516
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,980
Give the phone to Parthavi

517
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,230
For you

518
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,980
Who is it?

519
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,780
Madhu

520
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,570
Hello?

521
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,860
Someone is looking sweet
while siping a soft drink

522
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,440
Why did you call on Ambika's phone?

523
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,280
Give me your phone
number I'll call you

524
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,070
Oh really!
Aren't you getting too excited

525
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,730
Excited? Yes I am

526
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,440
Devi where are you?

527
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,730
Have you gone deaf?

528
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,690

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,320

Yes I am out for some important work

Who? You handle it

540
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,190
I said hang up the phone now

541
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,900
Quiet

542
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,780
I am in college

00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,320
Yeah I am here to
teach someone a lesson

544
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,690

545
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,730
I said, stand up

546
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,070
Don't you know phones
are not allowed in a classroom

547
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,150
What are you looking at me?

548
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,440

551
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
- You know his dad will never agree
- Hey uncle!

552
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,570
See your son will have a long life
Here he is

553
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,980
I have told you right not
to touch my feet. Give me a hug

554
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,980
How are you?

555
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,320
All well

556
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,230
You liked the pant-shirt?

557
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,770
Very much, I wore it also

558
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,530
You stay here tonight.
Dad has gone to Jaipur for some work

559
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,860
If your dad comes to
know that I stayed here

560
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,320
it will be a world war in the house

561
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,320
Why? What is his problem with you?

562
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,440
I would have told
you if there was one!

563
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,030
You leave it. Get ready
and take me lake-side

564
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,900
- Okay?
- Okay fine

565
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,320
Mom tell Gokul that I'll be late

566
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,280
Slapping a teacher was wrong

567
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,900
Shut up and eat your food

568
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,150
Don't teach me what
needs to be done or not

569
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,530
Why did you go to college?

570
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,860
Devi called. It was some boy's matter

571
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,070
There is no such matter

572
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,230
Dad, Devi is lying

573
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,440
There are a lot of boys and girls in
college, so should I give up studies?

574
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,230
Parthavi!

575
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,690
Sir, college principal
has arrived to see you

576
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,320
Make him sit

577
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:17,280
Roop slapped a teacher
in front of an entire classroom

578
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,940
But I don't want to
stretch this issue now

579
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,570
Let Roop apologise and end the issue

580
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,150
What is the teacher's name?

581
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,190
Agnihotri sir

582
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,570
Roop, say sorry to Agnihotri sir

583
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,530
Say sorry

584
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,230
Dad I don't want to say sorry

585
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,650
Election is near

586
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,610
don't stretch the issue pointlessly,
say sorry

587
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,360
Let me win this election once...

588
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,530
then I'll see who dares to come at my
mansion with a complain of my family

589
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,530
Say sorry

590
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,610
Sorry

591
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,110
Didn't you hear that?

592
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,690
Now leave

593
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,900
Your cheeks look
puffier than the dough

594
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,900
Missing her?

595
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,110
All because of your's
and dad's curses... Witch!

596
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,530
Madhu! Our sweethearts
have come outside

597
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,530
Come fast

598
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,480
What?

599
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,070
Listen, don't go

600
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,980
My husband has gone
to Jaipur for some work

601
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,980
hence I am taking
care of the front desk

602
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,760
Otherwise I usually
manage the kitchen

603
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,230
Very well aunty

604
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,440
This is my son, Madhukar

605
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,230
I know aunty. He is in my college

606
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,570
You never told me!

607
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,690
Mom you have met her at the clinic

608
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,280
Anyway, Gokul is waiting
for you in the kitchen

609
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,900
Welcome. Bagla's Exotic View Cafe

610
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,820
You disappeared all of a sudden!

611
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,480
I was giving a city tour to my uncle

612
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,980
Okay tell me,
what is the famous dish over here?

613
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,280
Red meat with lentil, world best

614
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,150
Cold drink. It's cold

615
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,360
We didn't order it!

616
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,610
It's from me, free

617
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,650
I don't want it

618
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,730
You take my order

619
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,480
Tell me

620
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,570
9, 7...

621
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,190
5, 5...

622
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,530
2, 2...

623
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,530
These are just eight digits,
remaining?

624
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,650
I forgot the remaining digits...

625
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,610
Let's go Ambika

626
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,780
Parthavi!

627
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,650
This is my restaurant's visiting card

628
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,690
It has my phone number, personal

629
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,610
All ten digits

630
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,110
Ambika... my card...

631
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,230
Hey... Why did you
offer a free cold drink?

632
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,690
Is it your dad's property?

633
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,780
Dear, one must take care of his lady

634
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,320
That's also true!

635
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,320
Hey, what are you doing?

636
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,940
Let's go inside it's late night

637
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,070
I am going to sit here and chant
and make sure that the call comes

638
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,230
It will come right?

639
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,940
- 200%
- It won't

640
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,030
Witch!

641
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,690
Hey... the call has come!

642
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:46,530
- It did come, it did come!
- Show show show...

643
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,980
What did you say? It won't come right?

644
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,900
See it's ringing

645
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,530
- Show show show...
- No I won't

646
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,360
Okay c'mon give now
- No I won't

647
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,700
Give, let me answer

648
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,540
Oh! Disconnected

649
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,400
Hello?

650
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,980
Why didn't you receive
at the first place?

651
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,360
We were dancing in
delight of your phone call

652
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,900
No need to dance

653
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,400
Why didn't call you last night?

654
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,110
Was sleepy, so I slept!

655
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,820
Okay listen, I have to go the
temple with dad, I'll call you later

656
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,110
What?

657
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,320
Okay I have to go now, bye.

658
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:42,610
Madhu!

659
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,190
I love you

660
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:52,530
You also say

661
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,610
I am feeling shy

662
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,570
Shy! I'll give you a tight slap

663
00:49:58,650 --> 00:49:59,650
I love you...

664
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:01,940
What?

665
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,230
I love you too

666
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,030
Moments ago the police has
raided the Goenka Palace hotel...

667
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,900
...and seized a huge amount of
fake currency, fake liquor and drugs

668
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,150
This hotel belongs to the
ruling party MLA Sulekha Goenka

669
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,280
But Sulekha's supporters
are accusing...

670
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,230
Ratan Singh of a political
conspiracy in this matter

671
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,150
You have done a great job

672
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,230
Hang on I am giving the phone to dad

673
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,730
Dad, Inspector

674
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,190
Mr Shekhawat, you nailed it

675
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,860
It calls for a treat Mr Ratan

676
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,730
C'mon guys hurry up

677
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,320
After this whole incident
ahead of the assembly elections

678
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,250
it is quite clear that
Mr Ratan's side is heavier then ever

679
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,920
One day I will build
a big mansion for you

680
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,380
Bigger then yours

681
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,720
I don't want a mansion

682
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,670
I am in a big mansion since childhood

683
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,920
But that wasn't mine ever!

684
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,050
It is a hotel

685
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,760
I want a home

686
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,720
Our home

687
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,800
Where food will be
cooked for only both of us

688
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,260
not for the world

689
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:44,360
So... you take your big mansion
and throw it in the lake

690
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,800
I don't need it

691
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,560
So who will cook in the new house,
you or me?

692
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,380
You. And make it calorie
free I want to stay slim

693
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,720
Really!

694
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,170
I want a pappi (kiss)...

695
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,880
Puppy? You mean a dog's baby?

696
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,220
Pappi means kiss

697
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,840
Kiss?

698
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,760
You want a kiss?

699
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,220
Take it then

700
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,630
Shall I?

701
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,240
Come to the mansion and take it

702
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,470
Don't crack such jokes

703
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,420
I am not cracking jokes

704
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,130
Tomorrow is Roop's birthday,
come if you have any courage left!

705
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,510
What do you mean courage left?
I have come there before

706
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,800
Everyone was sleeping then

707
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,380
If I come then you'll
have to give the kiss!

708
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:53,420
You'll come?

709
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,340
I will come for sure

710
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:56,720
Okay you come first

711
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,590
Parthavi I will come

712
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:01,970
Parthavi

713
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:03,840
Bye

714
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:05,510
Bye

715
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,420
Have you forgotten your status?

716
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,510
How dare you love my sister?

717
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,630
Roop...

718
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,220
Stop it!

719
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,010
Two days

720
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,130
Just wait for two days

721
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:42,480
It's two days for the election
then I'll personally thrash them

722
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,630
What happened?

723
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,260
What did you do?

724
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,720
I told you to stay away from her

725
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,170
I told you

726
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,800
Those are upper-caste people

727
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,170
I told you to stay away

728
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,260
Please listen...

729
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,590
Why don't you ever listen to me!

730
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:51,760
Long live Ratan Singh!

731
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,170
- Vote for...
- Ratan Singh!

732
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,380
Long live Ratan Singh!

733
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:59,050
- Vote for...
- Ratan Singh!

Long live Ratan Singh!

735
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,260
Eat something

736
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,870
A little bit, please

737
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,260
Don't be like this Parthavi

738
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,920
He is alright

739
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,340
How is she?

740
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,420
They have locked her in a room

741
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,510
She doesn't even have a phone

742
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,840
Not allowing you also?

743
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,170
No

744
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,920
You take care

745
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,600
Come, let's leave...

746
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,550
And with a lead of 2000 votes,
Mr Ratan Singh...

747
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,500
has defeated Sulekha
and won the assembly election

748
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:14,380

749
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,260
[indisctinct chatter]

750
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,920
[indisctinct chatter]

751
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:05,920
[indisctinct chatter]

752
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:26,720
[indisctinct chatter]

753
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,170
Whatever you wished,
will be done now

754
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,380
Have some tea

755
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,710
Don't take any tension Mr Ratan, the
job will be done. You go and relax

756
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:23,670
Start the car

757
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,800
Madhu!

758
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,670
Leave him...

759
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,170

760
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,720

761
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,970
Dad please leave him please

762
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,050
Take her away

763
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,950
What are you doing here?

764
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,210
You listen to me child

765
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:50,190
Please release them...they will never

766
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:51,550
Ya, we'll leave them

01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:54,720
Dad he will leave the city for ever

768
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,140
Don't worry, I'll take care of them

769
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,970
We won't do anything, okay?

770
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,340
Parthavi I'll kill you

771
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,340
I'll kill myself dad

772
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,470
- I'll shoot myself.
- No... no... no...

773
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,760
Let them go

774
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,050
Madhu let's go

775
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,510
I've released them, calm down

776
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,470
Stay back

777
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:13,330
No one will move a step
Come in front and stay there

778
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:15,730
Stay right there

779
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,160
Madhu....
Gokul look where is he going?

780
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,740
You come here

781
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,150
Stop... stop...

782
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,720
Did you see them anywhere?

783
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,130
Where the hell are they?

784
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,800
You check there

785
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,550
Devi, you go that side

786
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,840
Let's go

787
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,670
Drive straight...

788
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,430
Over there

789
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,050
Parthavi stop

790
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,970
Madhu stop, Parthavi stop.

791
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,220
Parthavi

792
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,800
Stop the train

793
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,630
Stop them

794
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,010
Stop the train

795
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,630
Check where is the train going

796
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,340
Quickly

797
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,110
Parthavi

798
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,840
20 Rupees

799
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,800
I don't have money

800
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:36,840
Get lost

801
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,550
Hello?

802
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:50,630
Uncle

803
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,170
Madhu where are you?

804
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,840
In Mumbai

805
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,380
Listen, your mom called

806
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,170
She was very tensed

807
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:00,590
What are you doing Madhu?

808
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,170
I don't know uncle

809
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,920
I am very scared

810
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,420
Firstly stop crying

811
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:09,880
do you have some money?

812
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,220
do you have some money?

813
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:13,760
Ya I have some

814
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,300
Ok then, buy a ticket
for a Nagpur bus and come here

815
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:20,010
And listen, do not call anyone at all

816
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:21,840
Ok uncle

817
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,420
Note down my address

818
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,220
Yes uncle

819
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,670
Any information on Madhu's friends?

820
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,420
Cops are looking for them everywhere,
we'll know something sooner

821
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:14,050
Then why are you faffing here,
go search for them

822
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:14,800
Roop brother...

823
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:20,800
Go inside

824
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:24,800
Can't you hear?

825
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,220
Go inside!

826
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,010
Mr Ratan

827
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,670
Many congratulations

828
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,420
Your lifelong desire is fulfilled

829
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:48,760
It will be a pleasure
to sit in your opposition

830
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:53,970
You are a real image
of an ideal Udaipur family

831
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,380
Your daughter is nowhere to be seen!

832
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,550
She ran away

833
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,670
So the rumour is true

834
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,630
But you don't worry

835
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,970
I won't tell anything to anyone

836
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:14,420
I am just like you

837
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,050
I also don't like spoiling
the opposition's reputation

838
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:24,840
You are not like me Mrs Sulekha

839
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,170
I will kill my daughter
the day I find her

840
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,610
So get habitual of
sitting in the opposition

841
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:22,800
Come

842
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,130
Take a shower first

843
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,130
Are you even aware what
would be the situation there?

844
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:39,030
Her family will make
everyone's life hell

845
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,510
And your dad is no lesser

846
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,170
You don't know him yet!

847
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:47,180
I was like a son to him

848
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,510
But just because I did
an inter-caste marriage...

849
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,430
he put an end to all our relations

850
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:58,630
Neither did he come to my wedding...

851
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,920
nor has he spoken to me ever since

852
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,010
And both of you are not that naive!

853
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,300
I do understand love, but what
you guys have done is foolishness

854
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,010
Understood?

855
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,130
Where are they going to stay now?

856
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:17,170
Don't dump them on my head,
I am telling you clearly!

857
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,050
Come, have dinner

858
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,800
Come

859
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:26,840
They will look for you everywhere now.

860
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,840
They might come here too

861
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,800
No one is safe now

862
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,470
Neither you

863
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,170
nor us

864
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:05,220
I have a friend in Kolkata,
his name is Sachin Bhowmick

865
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:09,590
I have spoken to him,
he will do some arrangements

866
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:12,510
Uncle, Kolkata?

867
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,170
Don't be scared Madhu

868
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,210
He is a very good friend of mine...

869
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:20,310
and he owns a hostel

870
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,510
He will arrange a room for you in it

871
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:26,350
I anyway visit there once in a year,
I'll meet you then

872
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,700
Can't we stay here with you?

873
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:35,340
Madhu try to understand,
you guys are safe there

874
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,880
No one will get to know about you

875
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:42,810
and anyway your aunt is
due to deliver a baby next month

876
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,460
I don't want to give her any tension

877
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,220
Are you getting me?

878
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,340
Can't we think of something else?

879
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,920
I don't want to go to Kolkata,
I don't want to go alone

880
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,670
Please

881
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:57,920
please uncle

882
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:01,380
Uncle, will we ever be
able to go back to Udaipur?

883
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:04,260
Can't say when, but...

884
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,840
it will take some time for sure

885
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:02,250
Yes there is a room available,
but would be slightly messy

886
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:05,390
- I didn't get time to get it cleaned
- I am taking the taxi sir

887
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:08,770
Hey, get the petrol
bill and drive properly

888
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:13,260
Arvind told me that he
will send two month's rent

889
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,460
But after that you'll have to pay

890
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,770
Hey Promila, tenants have arrived,
show them the room

891
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,480
And no ruckus...

892
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,000
if I get a complaint
then you'll have to vacate

893
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,330
Can't you show them the room?

894
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,050
Are you stuck to the chair?

895
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,940
I am getting late for work,
you show them

896
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,680
Useless person

897
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:39,970
My wife!

898
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,020
she is late for work, that's why

899
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:45,510
Come, I'll only show you the room

900
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:50,140
See, this is the common toilet

901
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,130
Hey your last three
month's rent is pending

902
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,880
Yes sir, I'll pay next week

903
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:55,970
Ok fine

904
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,800
Whoever stays on this floor,
uses this toilet-bathroom

905
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,550
Hello sir

906
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,510
Hello

907
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:01,550
Let's go

908
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,010
Let's go Parthavi

909
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,380
Come...

910
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:27,670
This is your room

911
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,760
Whatever stuff you don't need,
keep it outside

912
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,660
I will later get
it moved to the godown

913
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:41,340
Broom and mop are here,

914
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,310
Parthavi...

915
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:11,290
You clean the dust, rest I'll manage

916
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:10,220
I have written down the hotel manager's
phone number & address on this...

917
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,590
you go and meet him once

918
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,970
I have spoken to him,
he will arrange some job for you

919
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,800
Thank you Sir...

920
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,640
Again sir! Call me brother

921
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:21,430
Thank you brother

922
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,680
- What happened?
- Lizard!

923
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,850
Shoo her away Madhu

924
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:32,050
Why are you screaming!

925
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,260
Lizard!

926
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:34,420
Where is she?

927
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:35,800
Behind the cupboard

928
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:43,590
Madhu check properly

929
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,090
She got scared of you and ran away

930
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,300
What do you mean?

931
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,170
Madhu check properly

932
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,920
- There is no lizard, come
- No

933
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:51,630
- I am here, come
- No I don't want to come

934
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,210
- I am with you, come
- No

935
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,880
Why are you scared? Come

936
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,220
Lizard!

937
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,110
Where are you going?

938
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,360
To look for work

939
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,820
Don't go

940
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,610
- Parthavi why are you scared?
- Please don't leave me and go

941
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:25,650
I'll be back soon

942
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,150
I'll also come with you then

943
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,940
I'll be back in no time

944
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,110
I am anyway getting late

945
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,400
You wash clothes by then

946
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,470
Otherwise we'll have
to roam around naked

947
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,650
Okay?

948
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,490
I'll be right back

949
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,040
You don't have an ID card

950
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:58,090
you can't speak Bengali

951
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,500
how can I give you a job?

952
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:03,920
I will learn Bengali
sir and I can cook good food

953
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,900
I had a restaurant in Udaipur

954
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,860
I can cook all types
of Rajasthani dishes

955
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,120
I don't need a cook,
there is no vacancy for a cook

956
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,040
Sir you can give me any job then

957
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:19,380
mopping, sweeping, washing utensils,
waiter, I can do anything

958
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:20,790
Please

959
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:29,460
Ok I'll think about
it and will let Sachin know

960
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,130
You can go now

961
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:33,250
I'll let you know. Okay?

962
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,250
Fine

963
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:36,880
Thank you sir

964
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You have learned!

965
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:14,080
Parthavi

966
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:16,790
I have spoiled everything

967
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:18,800
Not at all!

968
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:22,550
These are small stains,
they will go in one more wash

969
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,170
They won't go

970
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,370
They will have to!
I will make them go, don't worry

971
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,670
You want to see Kolkata?

972
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,910
- No?
- I don't want to go

973
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,040
Get ready, lets go see the city

974
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,000
Ok, I'll go alone then

975
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:52,830
No!

976
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,940
Milk!

977
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,990
You seriously don't drink any alcohol?

978
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,920
No brother

979
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:52,130
Nice, milk is also nice

980
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:56,760
I used to drink rum earlier

981
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:05,470
Then Promila said wine
is the world's best drink

982
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:10,430
hence I started drinking wine

983
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,790
But I miss rum

984
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:22,840
Did you meet that manager?

985
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,210
- Yes
- What did he say?

986
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:25,630
I met him today

987
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,490
He said he'll let me know later

988
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:31,670
He will do something I am sure

989
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,130
Don't worry I'll talk to him again

990
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,370
Hey listen...

991
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:35,630
Ya

992
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,650
let him go to his girl

993
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,000
don't make him a drunkard like you

994
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,210
And we have to go to
church tomorrow morning

995
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:42,960
Enough for tonight

996
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:44,910
See...

997
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:47,750
I have just started
and she is saying enough!

998
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,230
See this

999
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,920
Sweet curd

1000
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,240
Sachin brother has sent for you

1001
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,240
Have it

1002
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:22,950
I don't want to

1003
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,000
- Have some at least
- No

1004
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,170
One spoon

1005
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,420
Not good?

1006
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,040
It is good

1007
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,420
Liar

1008
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:02,920
And him who comes to
me I will not caste out

1009
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,990
I am the bread of life

1010
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,960
this is the bread which
comes down from heaven

1011
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:10,130
and the bread which I shall give

1012
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,670
for the life of the world is my flesh

1013
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:14,960
Amen

1014
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,390
We usually buy grocery
from this store

1015
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:22,130
Brother,
please open an account for her too

1016
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,260
Keep this too

1017
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:27,290
I've got your account open here,
if you need anything, call me

1018
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:28,790
You'll go home alone, right?

1019
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,080
Ok then, I am getting late. See you

1020
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:40,630
Let me wash the utensils at least
He will do any job

1021
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:43,000
He is a nice guy,
I am taking his guarantee personally

1022
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,280
It's not possible here

1023
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,630
Try in one of the sports club,
it will be better for him

1024
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:53,540
Brother you know how tough
it is to get into a sports club!

1025
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,000
You please keep him
for a job at your hotel

1026
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,290
And if he messes around
anything then fire him

1027
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:01,220
Did you hear that? No mistakes
otherwise he will fire you

1028
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,200
Yes brother

1029
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:04,790
Kick him out

1030
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,170
Done

1031
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:12,320
You'll get Rs. 5000 per month

1032
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:15,260
It's ok for now,
you will get an increment gradually

1033
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:17,460
You can speak English right?

1034
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,340
Yes brother

1035
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:20,060
Good

1036
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:24,380
now quickly learn Bengali too,
then see you'll become a local hero!

1037
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:59,540
You attend them
I'll just see you, excuse me

1038
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:05,330
Hello?

1039
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:07,920
Hello?

1040
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,790
Hello?

1041
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:02,390
You are a hidden talent!

1042
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:12,540
I don't want to stay here Madhu,
I don't want to stay here!

1043
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:15,170
I want to go back to Udaipur

1044
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:16,930
I miss my home

1045
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:22,420
I am missing mom alot

1046
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:26,580
Madhu please take me back...

1047
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,210
Everything will be fine Parthavi

1048
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,970
Nothing will be fine

1049
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:32,500
I am telling you,
everything will be fine

1050
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,750
When?

1051
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:35,000
How do I know?

1052
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,890
Everything will be fine

1053
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:17,630
Parthavi,
I think you should also get a job

1054
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:18,950
I don't want to

1055
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,680
- You will feel good...
- There is no need of feeling any good

1056
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:28,930
We'll get some more money also

1057
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:47,530
Could you please take off my clothes
also from the rope once they are dry

1058
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:52,170
Could you please take off my clothes
also from the rope once they are dry

1059
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:16,060
You know english,
that is an advantage

1060
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,580
Once you'll get this job,
it will be good for you

1061
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:23,120
Otherwise you'll get depressed
all day sitting at home alone

1062
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,350
I have already spoken
to Vishwajeet sir

1063
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:31,880
Come Promila

1064
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,460

1066
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,190
Sir, I am summoned daily

01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,350
My restaurant is about to shut

1068
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:53,580
Please forgive me

1069
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,960
What should I do if your
restaurant is shutting down?

1070
01:36:58,820 --> 01:36:59,730
Where is Madhu?

1071
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,620
I don't know where is he,
I have told you thousand times

1072
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:05,210
Don't misbehave in front of sir

01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,060
Don't raise your voice

1074
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,500
Bring him again tomorrow

1075
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:14,040
Understood? Don't even
try to raise your voice again

01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:44,080
You have learned to speak Bengali!

1088
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:45,800
Yes sir

1089
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,550
A little

1090
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:50,710
I still need
more practice though

1091
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:52,670
Yes, keep practicing

1092
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,130
Sir, can I have Rs.3000 in advance?

1093
01:37:58,550 --> 01:38:00,690
You are very smart

1094
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,890
Very smart!

1095
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,880
You convince me for
everything by saying sir sir...

1096
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,540
No sir, actually I need it

1097
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:10,600
Ok you'll get it, go work now

1098

Dad

1117
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,020
Are you alright?

1118
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:28,150
Don't call ever again

1119
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,680
Listen, withdraw some money tomorrow

1120
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,490
Have to pay the rent

1121
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,140
Madhu

1122
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:17,910
Madhu

1123
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,020
What happened?

1124
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:30,050
Anything happened at the restaurant?

1125
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:33,580
What happened?

1126
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:39,990
Say something

1127
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:41,920
Why are you asking me?

1128
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,690
Go ask the person you
were having snacks with!

1129
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,230
You came to office today?

1130
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:52,510
Yes

1131
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,890
And got this new phone for you

1132
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,460
Then why didn't you meet me?

1133
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,020
You were busy with your boss

1134
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,850
Madhu don't talk rubbish

1135
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,880
I am talking rubbish?

1136
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,810
Weren't you having
snacks with your boss?

1137
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:19,290
Ya, but was I the only one having it?
Everyone was there

1138
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:21,290
- But he was glued to you only
- Madhu

1139
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:22,620
- Why are you talking like this?
- What?

1140
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:23,930
How am I talking?

1141
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,390
Tell me!

1142
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,630
Why are you getting angry?

1143
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:29,690
Why shouldn't I get angry?

1144
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,880
Why do you want to fight Madhu?

1145
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:34,210
- Let's talk
- Madhu

1146
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:36,170
Hey Madhu

1147
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,800
Parthavi, Madhu

1148
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,080
Hey Madhu

1149
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:45,070
Hey Madhu

1150
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,890
Hey I am also here

1151
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:52,210
Leave him

1152
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:55,760
My brother

1153
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,920
How are you Madhu?

1154
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,710
How are you Purshottom?

1155
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:03,850
Fine

1156
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:07,330
How are you?

1157
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,370
Your hair style has changed!

1158
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:10,030
I missed you a lot

1159
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:16,330
- Sachin brother
- Yes

1160
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:20,460
These are my friends. Best friends

1161
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:22,330
He looks like your child

1162
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,190
- Hello
- Let's go upstairs

1163
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:29,560
I spoke to Arvind uncle,
he told us that you guys are here

1164
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:31,120
so we came directly

1165
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,080
Have some fresh sweets quickly

1166
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:36,040
Take

1167
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:38,460
It's been three days since we left
from Banaras, are they still fresh?

1168
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,750
So! They are from my shop,
obviously I know the quality!

1169
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:42,080
You are the owner of the shop?

1170
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:43,500
Ya... owner!

1171
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,520
What?

1172
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:46,790
His job is to shoo
flies from the sweets

1173
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:48,790
This is the truth

1174
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,170
It is the most important job

1175
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:50,670
How?

1176
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,450
- A single fly can cause malaria
- That's true

1177
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:58,030
Hey, malaria happens
due to mosquito idiot

1178
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,190
Rest everything is fine bro

1179
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:09,430
We both work on the same shop,
we have a small place to stay

1180
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,300
Everything is perfect

1181
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:13,830
Got a chance to visit Udaipur?

1182
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,450
No

1183
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,870
There is no chance of going back now

1184
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:24,360
Mr Ratan is in power and
anyway there is so much tension

1185
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,060
Sorry

1186
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,150
Why are you saying sorry?

1187
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,430
Let her say

1188
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,400
Because of them we all are here today

1189
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:39,810
Why shouldn't she apologise?

1190
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,790
I'll keep the sweets upstairs and come

1191
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:29,320
Sachin brother,
can I get a glass of wine?

1192
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:32,040
You are my real darling

1193
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:35,290
Good, you are at least
giving me a company

1194
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:39,520
otherwise in few months I would
have started drinking milk like this

1195
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,230
Wait I'll get you a glass

1196
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:44,040
Hey Promila...

1197
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,250
No... I'll get it

1198
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:49,540
Carefully

1199
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:54,520
Hey

1200
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:57,460
since when have
you started drinking?

1201
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:03,480
I drink some times while
thinking about Ambika

1202
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:53,190
- You want more?
- No thanks

1203
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,070
- Brother?
- Yes

1204
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,750
Can I ask
you a personal question?

1205
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:02,180
Yes, ask

1206
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,370
You don't have kids?

1207
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,470
Hey... medical problem

1208
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:08,580
No no

1209
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,430
There is no medical problem

1210
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:17,990
In fact our society is
no more a good place to live

1211
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,110
It's tough to even breathe
peacefully in today's time

1212
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,970
Take your example...

1213
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:36,730
You both are innocent but still...

1214
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,960
running away
from your families

1215
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:44,000
away from your home, your city

1216
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:50,530
Then why should we bring a child
in this world to make him suffer

1217
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:05,510
Parthavi

1218
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,150
I want to talk to you

1219
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:22,900
Then you should have,
I was here the whole evening

1220
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,910
Sleep now,
I have to go to office tomorrow

1221
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:39,570
Jesus said, I am the bread of life

1222
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:42,560
he who comes to me, shall not hunger

1223
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:45,170
- and he who believes in me
- Bro, have you converted your religion?

1224
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,620
shall never thirst

1225
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:50,250
but i said to you,
that you have seen me

1226
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:52,760
and yet do not believe

1227
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:56,170
all that the father
gives me, will come to me...

1228
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:58,230
- Today I'll show you a Bengali film
- What?

1229
01:48:58,540 --> 01:49:00,390
A bengali film

1230
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:10,130
Parthavi

1231
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:12,650
Parthavi!

1232
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:16,350
Can't you hear I am calling you?

1233
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:18,090
I have to go to office Madhu

1234
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:19,400
Office on a Sunday?

1235
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,000
To meet your boss right?

1236
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:23,580
I am going for work

1237
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,440
You wanted me to take up a job,
so I am doing it

1238
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:27,500
Then talk to me for a minute, wait

1239
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:30,590
Leave my hand
I don't want to talk to you

1240
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,370
What?

1241
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:34,100
Stay away from me

1242
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,570
- Parthavi
- I don't want to listen anything

1243
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:39,600
I know what do you want to say

1244
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:42,640
It's all my fault, sorry

1245
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:48,080
- Parthavi listen to me
- Leave my hand

1246
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:50,580
- Listen to me
- Madhu it's hurting, leave my hand

1247
01:49:50,670 --> 01:49:52,250
Parthavi

1248
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:53,420
Stay away from me

1249
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,360
- Don't push me Parthavi
- Stay away from me

1250
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,540
Stop it, don't push me

1251
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:59,650
- Parthavi stop it
- Leave my hand

1252
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:01,830
Stop it, don't push me

1253
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:02,460
leave my hand

1254
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:03,290
Don't push me Parthavi

1255
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,420
leave my hand

1256
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:20,620
Parthavi

1257
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,580
Wait

1258
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:26,410
I made a mistake by coming with you,
huge mistake

1259
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:30,850
You made a mistake
and I am very happy here?

1260
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:35,990
Because of you we had to elope,
you brought me here

1261
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:39,480
We eloped to save your life

1262
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,460
You didn't do any
favour by saving my life

1263
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:43,040
We were in lock-up because of you

1264
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:46,740
Ya it was all because of me, I agree

1265
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:55,520
Then why did you love me?

1266
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,210
why did you love me?

1267
01:50:58,730 --> 01:50:59,540
Tell me

1268
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:03,650
Why did you love me, why?

1269
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:13,710
Parthavi...

1270
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:15,330
Parthavi

1271
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:18,910
Stay away from me Madhu

1272
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:20,540
Stay away

1273
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:25,900
Parthavi...

1274
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:34,120
Parthavi!

1275
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,710
- You drive
- Parthavi wait, come out.. come here

1276
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:39,800
Parthavi...

1277
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:00,660
Did Parthavi come here?

1278
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:02,290
Parthavi?

1279
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:05,290
No. But what happened?
Wasn't she with you?

1280
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:06,420
What happened?

1281
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,460
What happened exaclty?

1282
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:11,870
Say Madhu

1283
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,330
Hey Madhu

1284
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,120
Hey Madhu

1285
01:52:18,210 --> 01:52:19,210
Hey Madhu

1286
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:55,060
Promila sister...

1287
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:57,390
I can't find Parthavi anywhere

1288
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:01,650
We are at the Howrah bridge
but we can't find Parthavi anywhere

1289
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:30,670
Sir I have just messaged and
e-mailed you the details for Flurrys

1290
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:34,530
Would you like me to send you any
other details of similar restaurants?

1291
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:37,620
Thanks for calling Justdial sir

1292
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:28,070
One day I will make
a huge mansion for you

1293
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:50,150
I don't want a mansion

1294
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:55,540
I want a home

1295
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:01,430
our home Madhu

1296
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:07,880
Where food will be
cooked for only both of us

1297
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:10,870
not for the world

1298
01:55:13,150 --> 01:55:19,130
So you take your big mansion
and throw it in the river

1299
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:24,750
I want a pappi (kiss)

1300
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:28,900
Puppy?

1301
01:55:32,130 --> 01:55:34,280
You mean dog's baby?

1302
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:59,240
Sorry

1303
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:46,540
The people of Udaipur have made me
victorious once again and hence proved that...

1304
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:49,520
Udaipur is in safe hands

1305
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,290
I don't want to defame the opposition

1306
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:57,900
But Mr Ratan,
you better take care of your house

1307
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:03,090
your daughter and
your hotel and rule them

1308
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:05,210
That's your real position

1309
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:09,140
Leave the governance on me

1310
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:10,810
I will take care of it

1311
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:14,830
Due to a positive wave of Mrs Sulekha,
Mr Ratan lost heavily

1312
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:19,450
Mrs Sulekha has created history
by winning with a huge margin

1313
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:25,430
Mom that old flat I told you about

1314
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,590
we bought it at low price

1315
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,170
Ya, we have renovated it a little

1316
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,160
Tomorrow is the
house-warming ceremony

1317
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:36,600
you please come

1318
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:39,210
No child, I can't come

1319
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:41,260
But my blessings are with you

1320
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:49,440
Mom, I am missing dad a lot today

1321
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,470
Is he still angry with me?

1322
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:58,760
C'mon give the phone to Adi

1323
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:03,800
Talk to grandma, say hello grandma

1324
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:04,900
Say Adi

1325
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:06,620
Hello

1326
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:11,920
Adi

1327
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:14,530
Talk to her

1328
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:21,970
Mom, I am giving the priest
an envelope of Rs. 1000 and a vesti.

1329
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:23,640
It is enough right?

1330
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:25,990
Mom?

1331
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:29,810
Dad

1332
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:36,550
What is the name of your son?

1333
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:40,090
Aaditya

1334
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:42,770
Aaditya

1335
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:48,150
Nice name

1336
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,040
Dad!

1337
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:55,680
May you live longer

1338
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:13,930
Hello

1339
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:17,170
Ya, I am coming home in 2 minutes

1340
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:20,710
I know you can speak Bengali,
no need of flaunting it too much

1341
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,000
Come fast Madhu,
the priest will come in an hour

1342
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:27,050
And don't forget to buy sweets

1343
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:27,820
Yes I'll get it. Ya ok

1344
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,170
Give some more tea to the guest

1345
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:31,350
Yes yes

1346
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:33,050
I will get it

1347
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:36,090
Okay bye

1348
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:37,180
Where is Madhu?

1349
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:38,830
Still in sports club

1350
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:42,820
He has also become
useless like Sachin

1351
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:44,850
I am taking him to the park,
you go home and do the preparations

1352
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:46,980
Say bye

1353
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:49,250
Bye bye

1354
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:50,860
Let's go

1355
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,780
Say bye to mom

1356
02:03:14,230 --> 02:03:15,090
How are you?

1357
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:17,510
Fine

1358
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,400
How are you?

1359
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:24,550
Very fine

1360
02:03:29,950 --> 02:03:34,100
Mom-dad has sent
all these for you guys

1361
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:38,170
How are you Devi?

1362
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:38,880
I am good

1363
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:40,080
Keep it there

1364
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:42,110
- Keep it here
- Hello

1365
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:43,410
Hello

1366
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:46,280
You have grown a moustache

1367
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:47,440
Hmm

1368
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:49,570
Please sit

1369
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:01,810
Nice house

1370
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:06,000
Ya. It's an old one,
but it's right next to the park

1371
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:09,690
and there are couple
of schools also nearby, for Adi

1372
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:14,010
Where is Madhu?

1373
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:15,520
He should be here anytime

1374
02:04:17,570 --> 02:04:19,170
Please make yourself comfortable

1375
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:39,650
How are you Madhu?

1376
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:42,170
Fine

1377
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:45,920
Parthavi...

1378
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:02,920
When did they come?

1379
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,830
See this

1380
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:06,780
Dad has sent all this for us

1381
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:11,100
A new shirt for you. See!

1382
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,840
- When did they come?
- Just now

1383
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,500
You should have called me at least

1384
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:19,350
I tried, but you didn't receive

1385
02:06:20,420 --> 02:06:23,260
Go serve them tea

1386
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,500
Parthavi, where is Adi?

1387
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,930
He is at the Park with Promila

1388
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:30,260
You go serve them tea

1389
02:06:32,970 --> 02:06:33,860
What happened?

1390
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,120
I don't want to go

1391
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:38,420
Why?

1392
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,720
They are your brother-in-laws!

1393
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:43,690
Parthavi you go, I don't want to go

1394
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:48,050
Hey Madhukar Bagla,
I'll give you a tight slap

1395
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,640
Go fast

1396
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:10,090
We will go home now

1397
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:11,660
Then what are we going to do?

1398
02:07:11,940 --> 02:07:13,570
You want a lolly pop?

1399
02:07:13,870 --> 02:07:15,230
We'll get lolly pop

1400
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:17,420
Then what do you want?

1401
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:20,460
Don't cry don't cry

1402
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:23,880
Oh god! where is my wallet

1403
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:49,600
Hey Adi!

1404
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:55,770
Look who has come Adi

1405
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:57,520
Uncle

1406
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:59,010
Come come...

1407
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:02,270
I think he is little scared.
He is your uncle!

1408
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,070
Where is his ball?

1409
02:08:05,150 --> 02:08:07,040
You are so scared of uncle!

1410
02:08:08,050 --> 02:08:09,630
I'll get it

1411
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:11,460
Say hi to uncle

1412
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:13,980
Come to me

1413
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:15,050
Come come...

1414
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:18,710
Very good child

1415
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:21,340
What is this?

1416
02:08:21,420 --> 02:08:22,640
A black thread?

1417
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:26,170
Look what is that Adi?

1418
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:28,090
Madhu where are the sweets?

1419
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:29,870
Okay come to me

1420
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:32,580
Madhu, where are the sweets!

1421
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:35,320
Oh! I forgot

1422
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,560
There was only one job to do Madhu!

1423
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:46,340
Brother I will be back in a while

1424
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:47,460
Where are you going?

1425
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,300
I am going downstairs to buy sweets

1426
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:50,050
You be with brother

1427
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:52,510
I will get it delivered here

1428
02:08:52,590 --> 02:08:54,090
He is crying

1429
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:56,010
Oh my baby!

1430
02:08:56,090 --> 02:08:57,820
I'll be back in two minutes

1431
02:08:58,530 --> 02:08:59,220
Come fast

1432
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:07,820
Come lets play with the ball

1433
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:34,870
Can I have ten pieces of sweet

1434
02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:35,860
Sure

1435
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:44,720
Please hurry up

1436
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:45,880
Yes yes
