2
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,800
This is the place. Our tribe's holy ground.

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
It's the god's resting place.

4
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,100
Let's go!

5
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,900
That's it!

6
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Hurry!

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,500
Open it!

8
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,400
Oh no. It escaped?

9
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,100
After the typhoon had passed...

10
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,900
the sky was as clear as if nothing had happened.

11
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,100
A clear sky...

12
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,500
How's that? How's that?

13
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,300
Oh my.

14
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Oh? What is that?

15
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,700
It must have been a soccer ball that was blown here from yesterday's typhoon.

16
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,100
All right!

17
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,700
Let's go!

18
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,890
Go!

19
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Go!

20
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,000
It's not a soccer ball?

21
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,390
My remote control car!

22
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Wh-what is this?

23
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
All right!

24
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Come here, come here.

25
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,500
Got you!

26
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,390
You will be my pet.

27
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I wonder where Suneo-chan went?

28
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Mama.

29
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
Oh my, where did you go?

30
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,300
What are you doing?!

31
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,300
Wait!

32
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,100
Wait!

33
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,300
Wait!

34
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
This looks so good.

35
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,600
Thank you very much.

36
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,800
It's so cold and sweet, so good!

37
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,500
My...

38
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,800
Wait!

39
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,400
No-Nobita!

40
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
My... my ice cream!

41
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
My...!

42
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,200
My ice cream?

43
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,500
Nobita-kun.

44
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,900
You threw this on my head. What are you going to do now?

45
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Isn't wearing an ice cream hat pretty cool?

46
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,200
You fool!

47
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
Are you looking for a beating!?

48
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,300
Wait up!

49
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,300
Now's my chance...

50
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,700
It's not my fault!

51
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
Wait!

52
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
It's useless to run.

53
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
Nobita, prepare for a beating.

54
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
What!?

55
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
Oh no...

56
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Better run!

57
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,000
Gi-Gian!

58
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,200
Are you all right?

59
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
That thing is so strong.

60
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,400
I'm really happy that you saved me, but I...

61
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,300
What are you doing?

62
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,300
Just what are you?

63
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
You must be something that Doraemon brought out.

64
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
My ice cream...

65
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,900
Along with Gian were all your doing, right?

66
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,700
Proving yourself, eh?

67
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Stop following me!

68
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,900
I said, stop following me!

69
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,500
No...

70
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
What are you doing?

71
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,400
What... are... you... doing?

72
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Doraemon!

73
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
I didn't bring anything out.

74
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,200
But...

75
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,790
If you picked up some pet again,

76
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,600
you'll be scolded by Mama.

77
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,290
It followed me on its own.

78
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What is this?

79
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
I've never seen it before.

80
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,790
Let me analyze it.

81
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,100
My books...

82
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,990
I can't believe it.

83
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,800
His power is like a mini typhoon.

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A typhoon's child?

85
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
Stop it!

86
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I said, "Stop it!"

87
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,000
Fuuko!

88
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Fuuko? Is it a girl?

89
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,000
Because it's a typhoon's child,

90
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
So let's call her Fuuko.

91
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,200
{\an8}(Literally, "Child of the Wind")

92
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,290
If it's a girl, then this will be troublesome.

93
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,000
I get it. Let's assume that it's a girl.

94
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,290
But if Mama finds out, you'll be scolded for sure.

95
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
I can't just ignore her like that.

96
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,900
Fuuko!

97
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,100
I see... looks like it can hide in other things.

98
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,800
Fuuko is so smart.

99
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,100
Nobi-chan!

100
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Did you take the water pot?

101
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,600
Yes.

102
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,900
Don't just take it like that.

103
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Okay.

104
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Nobita-kun, Mama took it.

105
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,100
What should I do, Doraemon?

106
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Don't let her escape!

107
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,400
Mama! That's...

108
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,500
Is something wrong?

109
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,600
Do-Doraemon!

110
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,700
Nobita!

111
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,500
Don't bring any pets home!

112
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
I wonder where it ran off to...

113
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,800
What should we do? Doraemon.

114
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,000
What should we do?

115
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,700
I guess we need to put her into something...

116
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,400
Oh yeah, I have that.

117
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,000
Free-Size Toy Camera.

118
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,700
With this, we can give Fuuko-chan a body.

119
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,400
What should we give her?

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,700
Hmmm...

121
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,400
How about this? It looks pretty cute.

122
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,000
I really like this manga.

123
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,600
No problem.

124
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
I only have to take a picture with this camera,

125
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
then a toy of the image will come out.

126
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,300
It's done!

127
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
Now, Fuuko-chan.

128
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Try getting in there.

129
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,700
It'll fit her no matter what size she is.

130
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
You're upside down.

131
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Fuuko, how is it?

132
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,900
Looks like she's happy.

133
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Now we don't have to worry about being found out by Mama.

134
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,400
I should introduce Fuuko to Shizuka-chan.

135
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Even if I said no, you'll still bring her, right?

136
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,500
But before we go, I think we should clean up...

137
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,000
That's right...

138
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
Fuuko wants to clean up?

139
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
Is it all right?

140
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,200
That's amazing!

141
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,500
So amazing!

142
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
Well then, let's go to Shizuka-chan's house.

143
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
Here, use this Take Copter.

144
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Let's go together, Fuuko.

145
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
This is called a Take Copter. A 22nd Century invention.

146
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,200
It's a bit hard telling her this, since she can't understand it anyways.

147
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,100
I must find it.

148
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh yeah, Fuuko, you must be good.

149
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,200
When you're at Shizuka-chan's house, don't go flying around wildly.

150
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,300
Be good.

151
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Understand?

152
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,400
All right. Let's go.

153
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
She's like Nobita-kun's little sister.

154
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
She's called Fuuko, eh?

155
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,500
Because she's like a typhoon's child.

156
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,700
Typhoon's child?

157
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,700
I did a lot of analysis on her,

158
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,100
but science doesn't say anything.

159
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,900
Who cares? Fuuko is Fuuko.

160
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
She's pretty smart, too.

161
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,900
Amazing.

162
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh yeah, she can be friends with my dolls.

163
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Of course. Right? Fuuko.

164
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Mama gave this to me.

165
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
It's Koala-chan.

166
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,300
"Hello."

167
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,900
How cute. Let me see.

168
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,400
It's really well made.

169
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,700
Soft and fluffy.

170
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,300
Right?

171
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,900
Fuuko!

172
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,200
What are you doing!?

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,700
Didn't I tell you already?

174
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm not going to forgive you!

175
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Geez, so naughty.

176
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Sorry, Shizuka-chan.

177
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,900
That surprised me.
Ah, Fuuko-chan left.

178
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,400
That's fine.

179
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
She can go wherever she wants.

180
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,200
We don't know where she's going, Nobita-kun.

181
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,300
She'll probably go back home. That's right.

182
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,000
Where's her home?

183
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,000
How would I know that?

184
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Nobita-san.

185
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Fuuko!

186
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,200
Fuuko!

187
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,080
I didn't tell you to run away!

188
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,800
Fuuko!

189
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,900
Fuuko!

190
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,580
Fuuko!

191
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,400
Mama!

192
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,300
Do you know where Fuuko is?

193
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Fuuko? Don't tell me it was that thing from before...

194
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,900
No... That's not it. It's only a doll's name.

195
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Doll?

196
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,700
Where did she go?

197
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,400
Fuuko.

198
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,080
Where did she go? Fuuko...

199
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,800
Nobita.

200
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,000
What's he doing?

201
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,080
Fuuko...

202
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,800
What the...

203
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,700
It was only the wind.

204
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,900
Fuuko!

205
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,800
Where did you go? Letting me worry like that...

206
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,080
Don't run away anymore.

207
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,400
Well then, let's go back.

208
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,000
The doll!

209
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Fuuko, you look a little smaller.

210
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I see, you must be hungry.

211
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,700
Me too.

212
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,700
That's my wind pet!

213
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,300
Nobita!

214
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,080
Someone's calling me.

215
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,900
Did I hear wrong? Oh well, let's go back.

216
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,200
That wind thing... I found it first.

217
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,580
I must get it back.

218
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,500
Shizuka-chan! I found Fuuko.

219
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
Sorry for letting you worry.

220
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,000
Now I'm going to find her something to eat. See you tomorrow!

221
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,080
Nobi-chan, Dora-chan.

222
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
It's time to eat!

223
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,700
Did you get it?

224
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,300
It's inside the encyclopedia of the universe.

225
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,900
The food of typhoons is warm air.

226
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Warm air...

227
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,700
If it's that, I have something good.

228
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,200
A Regular Hair Dryer.

229
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,080
A regular hair dryer!

230
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,300
Why is it something like that...

231
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,500
What's wrong with that?

232
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,580
Was that good?

233
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,000
Looks like she's full.

234
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,700
Nobi-chan, Dora-chan!

235
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
What should we do?

236
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
Act like a real doll.

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What are you guys doing?

238
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
So this is the Fuuko-chan you guys were looking for.

239
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,100
Y-yes.

240
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,200
This is pretty cute.

241
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,300
It looks like it's alive.

242
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,400
It's made pretty well.

243
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
What's wrong with you guys?

244
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,580
Hurry up and come eat dinner.

245
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Yes, yes.

246
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,900
That's great.

247
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Fuuko, you're great,

248
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,080
thank goodness!

249
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,580
What are you guys talking about?

250
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,300
I think it just winked at me.

251
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
No, it didn't.

252
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,580
It was an illusion.

253
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
Well then, please wait here.

254
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Doraemon, a typhoon's child has to sleep, right?

255
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,600
She seems so peaceful right now.

256
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh yeah, we can bring her to play at the empty field tomorrow.

257
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,500
That's right, but it'll be better if there's a desert or some large grassy plains.

258
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,400
That'd be great.

259
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go with Shizuka-chan.

260
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I understand.

261
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,700
Good night, Nobita-kun.

262
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,500
Good night.

263
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,400
Good night, Fuuko.

264
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,800
Oh yeah, I should ask Gian for help.

265
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,200
Anywhere Door!

266
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,100
Well, let's go.

267
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,100
Anywhere will be fine.

268
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,200
Somewhere open, with lots of space.

269
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,200
Is that true?

270
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,700
So what hit me was the fool that hid in Nobita's doll.

271
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,100
That's right.

272
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,700
All right. I'll beat it up for sure.

273
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,800
Don't beat it, we have to capture it.

274
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,900
What happens after we capture it?

275
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,200
Let him be a pet, since it's so strong.

276
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,600
Suneo. I'm against violence, you know.

277
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
How's that possible...

278
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,100
It's really open.

279
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
Fuuko.

280
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm so glad for Fuuko-chan.

281
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, let's go together.

282
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,700
Obaa-san, sorry for the bother.

283
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,900
Is Nobita-kun here?

284
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,700
Yeah, along with Shizuka-chan.

285
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Excuse us.

286
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,500
Excuse us.

287
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm going to drown! I'm drowning! Drowning!

288
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,400
Thank you.

289
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,500
Doraemon!

290
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,900
We're saved.

291
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,800
Where's Shizuka-chan?

292
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,700
It's a racoon!

293
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,900
Shizuka-chan, I'm a cat, you know!

294
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
There's a raccoon there.

295
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Really?

296
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
There are a lot of them.

297
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,900
You're right, how cute!

298
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,700
Fuuko.

299
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,900
They're like balloons!

300
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,500
Yeah.

301
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,700
Don't run too far!

302
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,000
Look! It's a windmill!

303
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,700
There are houses on the cliffs.

304
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Look, it's the sheep-shaped cloud from before.

305
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,900
They're actually real sheeps.

306
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,900
Racoons that are like balloons, along with sheeps in the sky.

307
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,900
Oh, that's the wind hole's entrance.

308
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Just where is this place?

309
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
They're probably out, Doraemon and the others.

310
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,600
Let's go too.

311
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,500
Suneo, we have to tread carefully.

312
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,700
<i>Help...!</i>

313
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,000
Watch out!

314
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,100
It's not this, no, no, no!

315
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,800
Upwards Airflow Mat!

316
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Thank goodness.

317
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Are you all right?

318
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Damn.

319
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,700
<i> Who are you?</i>

320
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,900
What are you saying?

321
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,700
How did it become like this?

322
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,800
Gian!

323
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,900
Suneo-san!

324
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Ah, where is this place?

325
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
I don't know.

326
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,600
<i>Sun!</i>

327
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,800
<i>Are you all right?</i>

328
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,500
<i>They ran away, eh?</i>

329
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,300
<i>Sun!</i>

330
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,700
<i>Temjin!</i>

331
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,100
At a time like this we should use:

332
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,600
Translation Konjac!

333
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,300
I see.

334
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,400
I am Doraemon.

335
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
Thank you very much for saving my little sister Sun.

336
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,500
Those guys are real barbarians.

337
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm Temjin.

338
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
This is Domjin, Yamjin, and Kunjin.

339
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,000
Nice to meet you.

340
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm Nobita.

341
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm Shizuka, nice to meet you.

342
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm Suneo.

343
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,500
I'm Goda Takeshi, but you can call me Gian.

344
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,800
It seems like you guys were blown out here from that wind hole.

345
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Temjin, where is this place?

346
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
This is the Wind Village.

347
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,800
The people who live here, since the very beginning,

348
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,300
have learned how to control

349
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,900
And use the wind's power as a way of life.

350
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,700
Mama!

351
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,800
Welcome home.

352
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,600
Mama.

353
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,400
Hello.

354
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
It's so warm.

355
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,500
Amazing!

356
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,900
We borrow the wind's power to live.

357
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,200
Bringing the water up,

358
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,700
using it to irrigate the plants,

359
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,500
along with fishing to feed us.

360
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,500
All of this is done due to the power of the wind.

361
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,100
This huge windmill is called "The Old One".

362
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,300
Wow, such a big snail.

363
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,600
That's a giant snail.

364
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,900
How pretty...

365
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
There're a lot of interesting animals here.

366
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
These are pretty cute.

367
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,000
Really.

368
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,600
That's a strange snake.

369
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,600
There are normal turtles too.

370
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,200
It flew away!

371
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,200
Those are floating rabbits and bears.

372
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,100
Ouch.

373
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,100
I've never seen any of these animals before.

374
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,800
These could have evolved with the village.

375
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,000
So Earth still had places that we don't understand.

376
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,000
But it's amazing that they can use the wind to provide for them this well.

377
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
That's amazing!

378
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, Temjin.

379
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,800
Who were those people who chased Sun?

380
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
Are they also people from the village?

381
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
They're from the Storm Village.

382
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,100
They're different from us.

383
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,900
Temjin.

384
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,300
Let's go play with the wind targets!

385
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Let's play, everyone.

386
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
What is it?

387
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,500
Even though I don't know what it is,

388
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
but it sounds like fun.

389
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,800
Gian, did you forget what we came here for?

390
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,300
I forgot.

391
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,900
Gian!

392
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
On this cliff there are targets.

393
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,600
You blow wind into it.

394
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,900
Here, look at me first.

395
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm going!

396
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,300
That's amazing!

397
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,600
Let me try too!

398
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Nobita you can't do it. It's useless.

399
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm actually pretty good at these things, you know!

400
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,200
This game is pretty hard even for us.

401
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,500
If you hit a target, I'd say you have passed.

402
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,900
Nobita, why don't you give it a try?

403
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,800
Go, Nobita-san!

404
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,900
I'm going!

405
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,600
All right!

406
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,700
Shoot it!

407
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Now!

408
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,800
Close!

409
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,500
Amazing!

410
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,100
How's that possible?

411
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,100
You're actually pretty good!

412
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,700
No wonder you're Nobita-san.

413
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,900
Is this really your first time playing?

414
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,800
This is all thanks to Temjin.

415
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,700
Nah, it was Nobita who was quite good.

416
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,100
This wind top, I'll give it to you.

417
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,700
Thank you.

418
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,800
Well then, it's my turn next.

419
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Let me go first!

420
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,800
So, Fuuko was blown here when she was still in an egg, right?

421
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,500
I found her first.

422
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
Just where did she come from?

423
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,900
Dora Big Kite!

424
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
The view is great!

425
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,500
Doraemon really has so many amazing gadgets.

426
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,400
Fuuko! Here.

427
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
Fuuko-chan.

428
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
That toy...

429
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,000
G-gian! Gian!

430
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
That toy is...

431
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,200
Looks like I still can't do it.

432
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,200
Fuuko-chan, compared to Nobita,

433
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,800
My house has more desserts and manga.

434
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,000
So, come to my house.

435
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,600
Come visit us again.

436
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,400
Of course.

437
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Good-bye.

438
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,300
Bye-bye.

439
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,900
Good-bye.

440
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,700
Fuuko, we're going back now.

441
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,900
Looks like she hasn't played enough.

442
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,300
But if you're left here I'll get worried.

443
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,600
Nobita-san is like Fuuko-chan's papa.

444
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Convenience Purse!

445
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,700
With this we can get the Anywhere Door.

446
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,800
If we keep this door here then it'll be okay.

447
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,200
I see...

448
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Fuuko, if something happens,

449
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,200
come home quickly, okay?

450
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,900
I'm staying here.

451
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
If Fuuko's staying here, I'm staying also.

452
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,500
You're still saying those things? Time to go back.

453
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,190
That was pretty interesting.

454
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
See you tomorrow.

455
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,500
See you tomorrow.

456
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,100
What is this?

457
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,400
What was that?

458
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
I knew I shouldn't have called Gian.

459
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm so mad!

460
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,500
Next time I must make it my pet.

461
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,300
What's that sound?

462
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Don't tell me that it's waiting for me?

463
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,190
Fuuko.

464
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,100
Fuuko-chan.

465
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh, it's just a wolf.

466
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,500
What!? A wolf?

467
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,400
You'll do.

468
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,190
For what?

469
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,190
Your body.

470
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,300
I see... so she's called Fuuko, one of the things that flew away into the air.

471
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,600
I must bring it back.

472
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,600
Oh man, telling me to make deliveries again.

473
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:20,900
Mama keeps changing people, how annoying!

474
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Watch out!

475
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Aren't you Suneo?

476
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,100
Wait.

477
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,800
Why do you have that expression on you?

478
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,500
Wait up!

479
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Let go of me, you stupid gorilla.

480
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,300
What?

481
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,300
I said, "Let go, you stupid gorilla."

482
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,190
Suneo!

483
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,190
Even though I said I despise violence earlier today...

484
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,100
What's going on?

485
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,600
Who can it be?

486
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,500
Dora-chan, can you go see who it is?

487
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,600
Okay.

488
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,400
Sorry, sorry.

489
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
I think I left something here from before.

490
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,300
Eh? That must have been toublesome.

491
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,800
Sorry, but can you go get it yourself?

492
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,600
Sure.

493
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,190
Well then.

494
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,500
Who was it?

495
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,100
Suneo-kun. He said he forgot something.

496
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,190
Let's eat!

497
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,690
We of the Storm village...

498
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,300
have waited for this day for so long.

499
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,100
Please wear this pendant.

500
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,800
Everyone!

501
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,400
The great Uranda-sama has finally awakened!

502
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,900
The Storm Village will now start a new era.

503
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,600
What? Suneo-kun didn't go home?

504
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,300
Yesterday, Suneo seemed a little weird.

505
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,190
Now he's gone.

506
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,300
It was all because of me.

507
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,500
Didn't he say he forgot something?

508
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
I didn't make sure that he had gone home.

509
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,190
Dora-chan, let's go quickly.

510
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,100
Yeah.

511
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay, let's go!

512
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,190
Fuuko.

513
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,600
Fuuko, did you see Suneo?

514
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,300
Really? He should have come here...

515
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,100
That's...

516
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,090
The Storm villagers!

517
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,000
We brothers, along with Uranda-sama.

518
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,800
That

519
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,400
was...

520
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,100
Suneo-

521
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
san!

522
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Nobita, hurry up and hand Fuuko over.

523
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,800
He said Fuuko!?

524
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,800
You're still talking about that!?

525
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,300
Shut up, you stupid gorilla.

526
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,800
Suneo... you idiot!

527
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Go! Bring Fuuko back!

528
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,900
There has to be something, something...!

529
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,900
Such a violent fellow.

530
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,100
How should we dispose of him?

531
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,600
Don't mind him.

532
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Stop right there, Suneo!

533
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,800
Uranda-sama!

534
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Suneo, wake up!

535
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm really awake.

536
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,800
Typhoon Straw!

537
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Here, Nobita-kun.

538
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,000
Okay.

539
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
Oh no.

540
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,300
Wind God's Fan!

541
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,600
I fan... fan...

542
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,300
Eh? Did I get it wrong? This is a Festival Fan. Oh well.

543
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,700
What the hell are those fools doing?

544
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,800
How troublesome!

545
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,700
Ol' Dragon! Hear my call!

546
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,100


547
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
What is this?

548
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
I don't know.

549
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,500
I can't see anything.

550
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
What's going on?

551
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Nobita-kun! Shizuka-chan!

552
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,600
Nobita-san! Where are you?

553
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,800
Fuuko! Fuuko!

554
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,690
Fuuko.

555
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,500
I finally caught you.

556
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,800
Is everyone all right?

557
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,800
Rats! No! I hate them!

558
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
This pathetic cat.

559
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,100
Once I take away your pocket you won't be able to do anything.

560
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,600
Doraemon!

561
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,190
The mist is gone...

562
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,690
Fuuko!

563
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,800
Nobita-san!

564
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,690
Shizuka-chan!

565
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,500
Dora-chan... he...

566
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,690
Doraemon, are you all right?

567
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,900
Rats! Rats!

568
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,500
Doraemon!

569
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,190
Eh? Where's your pocket?

570
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,600
It got stolen!

571
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,800
What should I do?

572
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,400
If I don't have my pocket I'm only a second hand robot!

573
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,100
Calm down.

574
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,600
As long as we can go back home,

575
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,100
can't we get your backup pocket?

576
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

577
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,900
The Anywhere Door...

578
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,300
Now how are we going to go back?

579
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,190
Looks like someone destroyed it.

580
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,690
Oh yeah, Fuuko, Fuuko!

581
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,100
Nobita!

582
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,600
What happened?

583
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Fuuko is missing.

584
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,900
Now that you mention it, where's Takeshi-san?

585
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
Both of them got taken away by the Storm villagers.

586
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
By the Storm Village?

587
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,700
Temjin, do you know where their village is?

588
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,600
It's on the other side of the valley.

589
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
I'll take you there.

590
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:58,900
Let's go.!

591
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,900
Wait.

592
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,900
If you go now you'll get caught.

593
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,800
And you can't go dressed like that.

594
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,000
Anyway, wait until after the sun has gone down.

595
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,300
Fuuko!

596
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,800
Takeshi-san!

597
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,400
Suneo-kun!

598
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,900
Uranda-sama, everything is ready.

599
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,200
The only thing left is to get the Wind Jewel.

600
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,700
Then we can use the spell to revive the Mafuuga.

601
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,600
Soon the Storm Village will be the strongest.

602
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,800
Storm, it looks like it'll get interesting soon.

603
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,000
We'll go tomorrow.

604
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,600
All right.

605
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,800
The Dora Big Kite is still here, thank goodness.

606
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,200
But isn't it too noticeable charging in with this?

607
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,300
We got in safely.

608
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
Where are Gian and Fuuko?

609
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,900
Perhaps she's trapped in the caves.

610
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,000
Because Uranda-sama is here,

611
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
the day when the Storm Village rules the world is almost here.

612
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,900
Isn't that amazing?

613
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,300
Who is it?

614
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,200
Oh no.

615
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,900
Let's run!

616
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,700
If I still had my pocket...

617
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,300
Shizuka, are you all right?

618
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,400
Nobita-san!

619
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,100
Nobita-kun! Nobita-kun!

620
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,600
Someone fell into the trap!

621
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,500
Oh no. Hurry!

622
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,400
Nobita-san!

623
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,200
Not right now. Let's hurry!

624
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,600
It's me.

625
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Gian!

626
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,700
Takeshi-san!

627
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,700
I don't know what's going on with Suneo.

628
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
He's with the Storm villagers.

629
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,300
Found them!

630
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,900
Everyone, the exit's that way. Hurry!

631
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,500
What about Nobita-san?

632
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,400
Leave him to me.

633
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,700
Let's meet up at "The Old One" windmill, okay?

634
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,100
Okay.

635
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,200
Be careful!

636
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,200
Did anyone come by here?

637
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,200
I think they went that way.

638
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,000
Okay. Let's go!

639
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Ouch.

640
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Fuuko!

641
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,500
Fuuko!

642
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,300
Fuuko!

643
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,800
Fuuko! Are you all right?

644
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,500
Ah, I have this wind top.

645
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,600
Perhaps I can open his cage with this.

646
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,500
All right...

647
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,000
Fuuko!

648
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,700
Fuuko! I was so worried...

649
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:20,700
Someone's coming!

650
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
For Uranda-sama! Cheers!

651
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Fuuko. Bring his key here.

652
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,200
Good work.

653
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,200
That was great.

654
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,300
Let's go.

655
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,300
Let's drink! Let's sing!

656
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,200
Gian!

657
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,300
The exit's over there.

658
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,200
Doraemon along with the others are at "The Old One" windmill.

659
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,400
Be careful.

660
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,700
How about you, Gian?

661
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
After I see Suneo I'll go immediately.

662
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,800
Immediately?

663
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,800
Hurry!

664
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,700
Go!

665
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,400
Which way is it?

666
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,400
What's going on?

667
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:54,900
A waterfall!

668
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,100
We can get out.

669
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,300
Let's go see.

670
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,400
An underground waterfall, eh?

671
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,100
I think we're lost.

672
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,300
Thank you, Fuuko.

673
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,100
It feels like it's getting colder.

674
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,300
Wind! There's wind!

675
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,000
Perhaps the exit is over there.

676
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,000
Fuuko.

677
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,200
Fuuko!

678
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,500
What's wrong?

679
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,900
Oh yeah, Fuuko's really afraid of the cold.

680
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,800
In any case, let's hurry.

681
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,200
We finally made it out, but...

682
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,400
Fuuko!

683
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,100
Fuuko! Stay strong!

684
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,100
Which way should I go...

685
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,000
Doraemon!

686
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
I must go on.

687
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:31,700
We made it out.

688
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,000
We're saved.

689
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,100
We made it out safely.

690
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,600
But is everyone all right?

691
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,400
I don't know why Suneo-kun is with the Storm Village.

692
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,100
What happened?

693
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,700
What should I do?

694
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,500
Sorry... I already tried my best.

695
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,000
Fuuko! Be strong!

696
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,500
You can't fall asleep.

697
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,300
Nobita-kun! You can't sleep here!

698
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,500
Doraemon!

699
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,600
Why didn't you come and save me?

700
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,900
Because... My pocket got stolen.

701
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,900
That's all right. I'll find a way out myself.

702
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,800
That's amazing.

703
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
You really are a dependable friend.

704
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,600
But, at least do something about Fuuko.

705
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,700
That's why Mama hated raising pets.

706
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,300
It's so tiring having to keep taking care of them.

707
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,200
I know!

708
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,900
Young one, I'm going to tell you something right now.

709
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:07,000
A few thousand years ago, the Wind Village and the Storm Village became enemies.

710
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,400
The Storm Village's shaman, Uranda, used a forbidden spell,

711
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:18,600
And called forth the Mafuuga with immense power.

712
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:26,100
Mafuuga used his powers to do many evil things.

713
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,700
In the end, the Wind Village's leader, Moajin, declared war on the Storm Village.

714
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,800
He used his Sealing Sword and sealed the Mafuuga into three jewels.

715
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,500
The village buried two of the jewels along with Uranda in a coffin.

716
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,500
The last jewel was sealed along with the sword, letting them rest eternally.

717
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,200
But the Storm Village was discontent with that result,

718
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,900
and awoke two of the jewels.

719
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,300
Then don't tell me one of them was... Fuuko...

720
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,400
Fuuko!

721
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,600
We're saved! Thank goodness!

722
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,500
You guys saved us, right? Thank you.

723
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,800
But that dream from before...

724
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
I said that.

725
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,100
Don't be scared.

726
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,400
I'm a Yak.

727
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,700
I can communicate with you spiritually.

728
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,100
So what happened to the last jewel? Where is it now?

729
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,300
It's already in the Storm Village's hands.

730
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,500
Then what will happen to Fuuko?

731
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,400
It's fine for now.

732
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
That's great...

733
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:44,600
But,

734
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:50,900
You cannot let her get close to the jewel inside the Sealing Sword.

735
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,300
Young one, you're the only one who can protect Fuuko.

736
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,800
Y-Yes.

737
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,500
You cannot let her get close to that jewel, all right?

738
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,700
Yes.

739
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,200
You should rest here tonight.

740
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,100
Yes.

741
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,200
Thank you very much! Take care!

742
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,400
Say good-bye to Yak-san for me, okay?

743
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,400
Fuuko, let's go.

744
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,500
Everyone's waiting for us.

745
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,200
What an arrogant child.

746
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,500
Go and capture Fuuko for me.

747
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,500
Fuuko!

748
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,300
Fuuko!

749
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,200
Good work.

750
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,100
Well then, let's go to the southern island.

751
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,000
Suneo! Return Fuuko to me!

752
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,800
Doraemon!

753
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,200
Isn't that the story of Noah's flood?

754
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,500
Isn't that just a biblical story...

755
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,200
But there was evidence of a huge flood.

756
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,900
We have to think of something.

757
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,800
If we don't do anything,

758
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:53,000
then Noah's flood will happen when Mafuuga's jewel is revived.

759
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,500
Doraemon!

760
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,300
Let's go get Fuuko back!

761
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,400
Along with Suneo!

762
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,700
We're also worried about Takeshi-san...

763
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,800
Even if you say that,

764
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,000
we don't even know where the southern island is.

765
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,600
Three cheers for Uranda-sama!

766
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,600
Is it the Dragon Head Island?

767
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,900
You know about it, leader?

768
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,900
Over there lies the jewel and the Sealing Sword.

769
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Fuuko is there also!

770
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Temjin, gather everyone.

771
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,200
Kanjin, get the Wind ship ready.

772
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Hurry!

773
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,200
In order to prevent the revival of Mafuuga,

774
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,300
it is time to bring back the Wind ship!

775
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,800
What does the Wind ship look like?

776
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,600
It's big!

777
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,800
So this is the Wind ship...

778
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,500
Take off!

779
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,800
It's an island!

780
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,500
Ah, the wind...!

781
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,700
What's going on?

782
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,700
I can't believe it, we can't control the wind here.

783
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh yeah, did we enter a doldrums area?

784
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:44,000
{\an8}Note: Doldroms is the ocean belt near the equator, characterized by none or light variable winds.

785
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,100
Look, that's the Dragon Poem Island.

786
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,900
The time we have waited for Mafuuga's resurrection has gone on for too long!

787
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,200
Listen up, don't let Fuuko escape.

788
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,500
I'll go follow Suneo-kun.

789
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,700
You guys think of a plan to save Fuuko.

790
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,500
I understand.

791
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,200
Even though I don't have any gadgets,

792
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,200
Earth's fate still lies in our hands.

793
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,100
Be careful!

794
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,000
Be careful, Doraemon.

795
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,900
Gian!

796
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,900
Thank you.

797
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,800
Fuuko, wait for me.

798
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,600
That hat!

799
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,800
Isn't that Doraemon's 4-D pocket?

800
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,000
Really?

801
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,100
Temjin, can you think of a plan to get that hat back?

802
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,700
That's easy.

803
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,500
But what should we do after that?

804
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,600
It's the sealed jewel!

805
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,200
It'll be bad if he pulls that sword out.

806
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:39,900
Sword?

807
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,900
The day of Mafuuga's resurrection is finally here.

808
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,700
Stop it! Suneo!

809
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,400
What are you doing?

810
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,500
Return to your old self, Suneo!

811
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,000
Return to your old self!

812
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,300
That's impossible, you stupid gorilla.

813
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,500
Mind your own business.

814
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:05,900
Suneo!

815
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,300
Suneo! Stop!

816
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,400
That's not Suneo-kun!

817
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,200
Suneo, hear me sing!

818
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,600
Return to your old self!

819
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,400
<i>I am Gian!</i>

820
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,400
It's so bad...

821
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,000
<i>I'm the king among kids!</i>

822
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
<i>I'm the invincible man!</i>

823
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,800
Suneo!

824
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,400
Suneo!

825
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,700
Hat!

826
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,700
Hey, wait! My hat!

827
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:18,800
Really...

828
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,700
It's time.

829
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,000
Flashbangs!

830
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,300
Fuuko!

831
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,500
Fuuko!

832
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,100
Wait!

833
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,100
That was only a feint!

834
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
Wait!

835
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,400
There has to be something, something!

836
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,400
Wait!

837
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,300
I found it! What is this?

838
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Run!

839
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,700
What is this?

840
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,700
It's the monster box.

841
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,300
Such cowardly fools.

842
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,200
Be quiet!

843
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,100
I have received Mafuuga's jewel.

844
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,300
Now's the time for Mafuuga's resurrection!

845
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:23,100
(Spells)

846
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,900
Awaken, Mafuuga!

847
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,500
Fuuko!!!

848
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,800
Breaking news.

849
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,700
The weather satellite has suddenly discovered a huge typhoon.

850
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,900
How scary.

851
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,200
This typhoon is a very strong one.

852
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,300
It's very likely that this typhoon will cause massive damage.

853
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,600
Suneo!

854
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,300
Wake up! Suneo!

855
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,700
Suneo-kun!

856
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,700
Suneo, you back to normal?

857
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,000
Thank goodness.

858
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,900
What are you two doing?

859
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,700
What is this place?

860
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,800
We'll explain it to you later.

861
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,300
Suneo-kun, bring me that sword.

862
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,300
What do you want with the sword?

863
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,200
Cut the rope! Hurry!

864
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,200
What? Are you commanding me?

865
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,100
You should say, "Please cut the rope."

866
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,900
If you keep stalling the Storm Village will destroy us all!

867
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,100
Storm Village?

868
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,700
I don't really understand... It was probably a dream or something.

869
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,000
Suneo! Please... cut the rope.

870
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,200
I understand.

871
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,400
Everyone,

872
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,500
from now on the Storm Village will be undefeatable!

873
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,000
Thank you, Uranda.

874
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,900
But, your role ends here.

875
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,300
What?

876
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,600
That's a Spirit Cage!

877
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,800
And that UFO is a time machine!

878
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,300
So you came, you blue racoon.

879
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,100
No! I'm a cat robot!

880
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,700
Who are you?

881
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,400
Let me tell you.

882
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,400
My name is Doctor Storm!

883
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,100
A 22nd century archaeologist.

884
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,500
Why did you come here from the 22nd century?

885
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,300
I discovered this pendant.

886
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:16,600
"Mafuuga will be resurrected on this day," says the pendant.

887
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,000
If you came from the 22nd century,

888
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,600
how could there be such a prophecy?

889
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,600
That's correct. The prophecy hasn't been fulfilled yet.

890
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:29,000
That's why I'll be the one to fulfill it today!

891
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,000
What did you say?

892
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,100
The Earth will be thrown in chaos!

893
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,500
I'll give this dirty and inhospitable world a real cleansing!

894
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,200
And then I'll create a brand new century!

895
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,300
Mafuuga! You can go on your rampage now.

896
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,600
So this is Mafuuga.

897
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,390
Run!

898
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,000
A giant wave's coming!

899
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:31,200
Kunjin! Tell everyone to bring this boat up!

900
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,200
Uranda-sama! Save us!

901
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,890
You guys are useless now.

902
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:09,300
Doraemon!

903
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,700
Is everyone all right?

904
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,890
Just who did this?

905
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,700
Wasn't it you?

906
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,700
Doraemon! Fuuko is...

907
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,890
I understand. I'll think of something.

908
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,700
Doraemon, your pocket.

909
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,890
You finally found it? Thank you.

910
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:36,200
All right, now I'm not a second hand robot anymore.

911
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,600
Doraemon, think of something!

912
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,000
I understand. Leave it to me.

913
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,700
This, this... and this...

914
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,000
The giant wave is coming again!

915
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:50,000
Everyone, go help them!

916
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Air Cannon!

917
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,100
Will that really work?

918
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,500
Leave it to me.

919
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,000
Big Light!

920
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,390
Nobita-kun, turn me big with this.

921
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:13,800
Hurry!

922
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,200
Hurry!

923
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,100
Here I go!

924
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,500
Mafuuga, I'll be your opponent!

925
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,700
Come here!

926
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,390
Fire!

927
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,200
Got him!

928
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,500
A success!

929
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,890
Amazing, that's my Doraemon.

930
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,700
How's that? Pretty smooth, eh?

931
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,500
Doraemon!

932
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,200
It's useless no matter what you do!

933
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:27,890
Gian!

934
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,390
Yamjin used the Sealing Sword and sealed Mafuuga into three jewels.

935
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,500
Oh yeah, that sword!

936
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,300
Shizuka-chan, hold on to this.

937
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,100
Temjin, bring me to where Mafuuga is.

938
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,500
Hurry up and bring me to him!

939
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,800
Okay. I understand.

940
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:57,700
Nobita!

941
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,890
Nobita-san!

942
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,800
Be careful!

943
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,200
Nobita, he's coming!

944
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,700
Now!

945
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,000
Fuuko!

946
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,000
Come back!

947
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,300
We did it, Nobita!

948
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,900
They did it!

949
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,090
Nobita-san!

950
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,300
Fuuko-chan!

951
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,300
Amazing, Nobita!

952
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,400
Nobita!

953
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,690
Nobita-san!

954
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,500
There's no hope!

955
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,390
Fuuko-chan!

956
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,000
Fuuko!

957
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,100
Where's Fuuko?

958
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,500
Over there!

959
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,500
Fuuko!

960
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,400
Idiot, how could someone like you defeat Mafuuga?

961
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,800
Doraemon, are you all right?

962
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:43,900
Fuuko-chan wants to dispel Mafuuga by going in its opposite direction.

963
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,400
What do you mean?

964
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:50,800
Uh... what I mean... um...

965
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,300
Don't tell me...

966
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,190
Don't tell me... Fuuko will...

967
01:14:58,890 --> 01:14:59,800
Stop...

968
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,300
Stop it! Fuuko!

969
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,800
Fuuko...

970
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,600
Go! Fuuko!

971
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,200
Suneo.

972
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,600
Don't lose to Mafuuga!

973
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,700
Fuuko-chan! Go!

974
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,390
Go!

975
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,500
Go!

976
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,300
Let's all assist Fuuko with our power!

977
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,300
Combine all of our winds' power!

978
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,600
Fuuko! You're doing great!

979
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,500
Go!

980
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,690
Impossible... I can't believe it!

981
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,700
Fuuko!

982
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,600
Go!

983
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,100
Fuuko!

984
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,500
What are you doing?

985
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:17,980
Fuuko!

986
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,890
There's a waterfall! We can get out!

987
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:24,700
Fuuko.

988
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,300
Nobita.

989
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:00,900
Gian.

990
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,700
Let him be alone for now.

991
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.

992
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:06,500
Nobita-kun.

993
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,100
Nobita-san.

994
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,200
Damn, how can this happen?

995
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,890
Storm is...

996
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,390
Doraemon, lend me the Air Cannon.

997
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,390
Give him a good lesson.

998
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,100
Temjin, help me.

999
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:20,890
Okay.

1000
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,300
Storm... Taste this!

1001
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,390
Amazing, Gian!

1002
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,100
Piece of cake!

1003
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,200
Breaking news update.

1004
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:43,900
The typhoon from before suddenly disappeared.

1005
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,590
The weather service is still researching this case.

1006
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,000
Goda-san.

1007
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:51,100
Welcome.

1008
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,390
You came, eh? Come on in.

1009
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:14,300
Storm is a 22nd century criminal.

1010
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,800
Good work, everyone.

1011
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,800
Wind ship, lift off!

1012
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm not Uranda.

1013
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,800
My name is Suneo.

1014
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:45,500
Uranda is a good name, isn't it?

1015
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,500
Come back soon!

1016
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:50,890
Take care.

1017
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:52,800
Thank you.

1018
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:59,300
Fuuko disappeared.

1019
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,800
But I'm not sad.

1020
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:05,890
Because Fuuko will always be by my side.

1021
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,890
Hey, everyone!

1022
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,890
Nobita, you're slow.

1023
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,700
I just saw Fuuko.

1024
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,200
Are you sure you weren't daydreaming again?

1025
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,600
It's always like this.

1026
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,000
This time it's real!

1027
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,000
But it might have been a dream.

1028
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,700
I said it wasn't a dream!

1029
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:28,800
Nobita-kun drools when he naps!
