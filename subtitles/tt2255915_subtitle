1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,332
I'm a writer. I'll
write something for sure.

2
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,364
There's an ocean
of emotion inside me.

3
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:00,497
I'll surely express
some if not more.

4
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:30,532
There's so much in this world.

5
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:33,801
Yet Alexandra left empty-handed.

6
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,511
There's so much in this world.

7
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,309
Yet Alexandra left empty-handed.

8
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,780
The one who
conquered the world...

9
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,945
Lost his last battle.

10
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,312
Only He knows...

11
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:52,783
Only He knows...

12
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:57,129
Only He knows what He does.

13
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:03,399
We don't know...

14
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:09,498
We don't know what pleases Him.

15
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:13,545
We don't know what pleases Him.

16
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:34,291
Some have sons. Some
don't even have daughters.

17
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:39,498
Some have palaces. Some
don't even own a hut.

18
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:46,004
Some have sons. Some
don't even have daughters.

19
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:50,038
Some have palaces. Some
don't even own a hut.

20
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,941
Some know their destination.

21
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,543
Some don't even
know which path to take.

22
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:59,024
Which path to take.

23
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:04,956
Many a time, the boat sinks...

24
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:10,435
Many a time, the
boat sinks near the shore.

25
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:12,568
Only He knows...

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,567
Only He knows...

27
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:19,867
Only He knows what He does.

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,684
We don't know...

29
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:29,021
We don't know what pleases Him.

30
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,956
We don't know what pleases Him.

31
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:36,758
We don't know what pleases Him.

32
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,474
Your applause indicates that these
lyrics have touched your heart.

33
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,037
Some have sons.

34
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:53,643
While some don't even
have daughters.

35
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,906
Some have palaces.

36
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,471
Some don't even own a hut.

37
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,078
Some know their destination.

38
00:03:58,318 --> 00:03:59,683
Some don't even
know which path to take.

39
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:02,650
Many a time, the
boat sinks near the shore.

40
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,687
Only He knows what He does.

41
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,783
We don't know what pleases Him.

42
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,654
God has many facets.

43
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:12,994
Whether we like it or not,
we have to do what He wants.

44
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,995
We have to follow the path
He has chosen for us.

45
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:18,437
Happiness is also a part of it.

46
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,800
It spreads from one
face to a million.

47
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:25,772
Happiness also
means a Punjabi girl.

48
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,730
With a move...

49
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,356
With a move...

50
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:51,065
With a move I can
shake the world.

51
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,369
With a move I can
shake the world.

52
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,911
I can make the world
dance to my tunes.

53
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,744
I can make the world
dance to my tunes.

54
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:03,976
I can make everyone dance.

55
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:05,512
I can bring a party to life.

56
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,951
I am a girl from Punjab.

57
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,420
I am a girl from Punjab.

58
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,351
I am a girl from Punjab.

59
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,893
I am a girl from Punjab.

60
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:17,723
No one can catch me.

61
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,762
No one can catch me.

62
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,993
I can make the world
dance to my tunes.

63
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,432
I can make everyone dance.

64
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,993
I am a girl from Punjab.

65
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,665
I am a girl from Punjab.

66
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:30,266
I am a girl from Punjab.

67
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,743
I am a girl from Punjab.

68
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,690
Every young man asks for my name.

69
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,885
He asks everyone where I stay.

70
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,660
Every young man asks for my name.

71
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,099
He asks everyone where I stay.

72
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,771
Every young man asks for my name.

73
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:02,272
He asks everyone where I stay.

74
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,708
I spread love wherever I go.

75
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,837
I spread love wherever I go.

76
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:08,244
I can make everyone dance.

77
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:09,474
I can bring a party to life.

78
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,049
I am a girl from Punjab.

79
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,582
I am a girl from Punjab.

80
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:17,415
I am a girl from Punjab.

81
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,482
I am a girl from Punjab.

82
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:24,421
With a move I can
shake the world.

83
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:40,368
Everyone wants a
place in my heart.

84
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,810
Everyone wants to
play with my hair.

85
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,347
Everyone wants a
place in my heart.

86
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,785
Everyone wants to
play with my hair.

87
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,515
Everyone wants a
place in my heart.

88
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,890
Everyone wants to
play with my hair.

89
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,591
I don't let anyone hold my hand.

90
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:00,565
I don't let anyone hold my hand.

91
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,227
I can make the world
dance to my tunes.

92
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:08,306
I am a girl from Punjab.

93
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:12,443
I am a girl from Punjab.

94
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:21,243
I am a girl from Punjab.

95
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,796
She is a girl from Punjab.

96
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,763
She is a young bud.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,663
Harman Singh, Simran is great.

98
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,005
She rocked the
stage with her dance.

99
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,031
Everywhere you looked you
could only see Simran.

100
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,903
Let me tell you, Simran
is the best of the best.

101
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,676
I wonder who will be the lucky one.

102
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:49,906
You?

103
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,314
I'll tell you.

104
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,509
Harman, who else.

105
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:55,850
You know, she is the daughter
of the richest businessman...

106
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,446
...of our city, Mr. Mahinder Singh.

107
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:00,057
She must be receiving
best proposals from world over.

108
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,024
Harman, one should also take
into consideration his status.

109
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,490
We are ordinary
kids of ordinary parents.

110
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,831
I am Sikander.

111
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:11,931
All lover boys bow before me.

112
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,035
No ordinary people.

113
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,604
We are special and rare.

114
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:20,504
Let me tell you, love
is the greatest power.

115
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,443
Nothing can stand before
love. Neither wealth nor money.

116
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:29,552
If Harman's love is true, Simran
will one day come to him.

117
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,987
I... have never been able
to forget that day.

118
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,858
The day when I saw Simran
for the first time.

119
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:43,998
I was in the library and
she was just entering it.

120
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,717
Wherever I look...

121
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:07,215
...I see you.

122
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:13,693
I always think about you.

123
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:22,506
You dwell in my breath.

124
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,310
Not even for a moment...

125
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:30,382
...I can stay away from you.

126
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:37,854
You are my dawn.

127
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:47,028
You are my dusk.

128
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:54,597
All my life...

129
00:09:56,643 --> 00:10:03,776
My life is dedicated to you.

130
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:09,045
Beautiful...

131
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,326
Damsel...

132
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,323
Beautiful...

133
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,792
Damsel...

134
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,736
I just kept staring at her.

135
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:28,369
Damsel...

136
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:31,677
Hello. Where to?

137
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:32,938
What are you thinking about?

138
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:35,808
Nothing.
- Something for sure.

139
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,318
Here you go, Sikander.

140
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,649
Let's park the bike
here. I will walk you home.

141
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:46,685
My home, brother?

142
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,087
It's just a small hut.

143
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:50,459
The real home has been
built by the NRI.

144
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,998
What marble!

145
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:55,960
If you slip, you will
get right inside.

146
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,537
I stealthily went inside
and had a look.

147
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,572
Their washrooms are better
than our bedrooms.

148
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,642
I wonder from where
he made all that money.

149
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,899
Hey.

150
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,277
I have built these bedrooms
and bathrooms for myself.

151
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:09,872
For you, I have built this.

152
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,677
They don't belong anywhere.

153
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,878
They are neither players nor
jugglers nor wanderers.

154
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:17,445
They stop here and start
their act. Before my palace.

155
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:18,888
Not your fault, brother.

156
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,522
Rich always find the
poor man's intent bad.

157
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,460
And...
- Stop it.

158
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:26,096
Hello. We look at you as well.

159
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,799
If our intentions are that bad...

160
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,866
...then you would have
gone bust long bad.

161
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:30,958
You don't know me.

162
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,369
I am Sikander. All lover
boys bow before me.

163
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,770
What you say doesn't make me laugh.

164
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,740
I don't laugh at Russell Peter
and Jim Carey either.

165
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:41,439
Take your wreck and move.

166
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:42,674
Come on, get going.

167
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,817
Move this wreck?

168
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:46,451
This is my buddy's bike.

169
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,850
Get go!
- What do you think of yourself?

170
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,751
I'll buy your bungalow someday.

171
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,014
Forget it, Sikander.

172
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,890
Why are you talking to such a man?

173
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,559
Let his bungalow go to hell.

174
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,987
And don't forget where we stand.

175
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:59,592
We are talking about bungalows...

176
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,391
...whereas we cannot even
take care of our small homes.

177
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,729
Karam Singh, you are
not keeping well these days.

178
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:13,643
We don't like coming to your
house everyday for money.

179
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,807
But what can we do? A loan
is a loan, after all.

180
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,614
And as they say the one
who owes can go to sleep...

181
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,281
...but the interest never sleeps.

182
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:29,325
Hence we think we should
do something...

183
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,391
...which gives us our money back...

184
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:33,657
...and you too get some money.

185
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,395
Right. - What are you
talking about, Mr. Lala?

186
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:38,965
Come, son. Come in.

187
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,000
How's your education going on?

188
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,106
You shouldn't pay much attention
to my education.

189
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,476
Tell me what were
you talking about.

190
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:51,549
Look, son, you study in a college.

191
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,743
You will study and
become an officer.

192
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,355
What do you have to do
with farms and farming?

193
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,084
Heed my advice and sell your land.

194
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,456
Are you done?

195
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:07,023
Thank you very much
for your advice.

196
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,827
But we don't want to
sell our land. Goodbye.

197
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,897
Son, you shouldn't take such
decisions in a hurry.

198
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:16,841
Take your time and think over it.

199
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,307
Calm down and think.

200
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,304
You will benefit by
selling this land.

201
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,378
And we will benefit
a little as well.

202
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,784
I told you, we don't
want to sell our land.

203
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,852
And I mean it. Please leave.

204
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:31,512
Fine.

205
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:32,980
Goodbye.

206
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:34,723
Come on, let's go.

207
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:39,690
Goodbye.

208
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:51,468
Son, you should think
about working now.

209
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,539
We have no income.

210
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:56,038
And your father
too isn't keeping well.

211
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:58,513
What's wrong with me?

212
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,419
A few herbs and
I'll be fit as a fiddle.

213
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,749
Son, you should concentrate
on your studies.

214
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,690
I will take care of my land.

215
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,488
Nothing's wrong with me.

216
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:11,028
Son, you...
- Mother, why do you worry?

217
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,288
Your son is here.

218
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,763
I agree times are tough.

219
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,366
But soon we will find a way.

220
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,605
Then see, your son
will achieve great heights.

221
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,500
I will give you and father all
the happiness in the world.

222
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:26,870
Now give me a smile.

223
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:30,074
Give me a smile.
- Bless you, son. Bless you.

224
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,813
Brother-in-law, you are doing
wonders in business...

225
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,615
...and your daughter
is doing wonders in dance.

226
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,350
We are the talk of
the town these days.

227
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,784
It's all God's grace.

228
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,563
May He always be this generous.

229
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:48,730
We consider ourselves
very fortunate.

230
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,733
As we got Simran as our daughter.

231
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,701
No, dad. I am lucky.

232
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,672
That I got such good parents.

233
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,567
They love me so much.

234
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,941
And they can do anything
to fulfil my wish.

235
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:04,314
You know, mom, my friends say...

236
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,779
...Simran, you are the luckiest
girl in the world.

237
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,952
Simran, you mean the world to us.

238
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,054
Our happiness lies in yours.

239
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,288
And my happiness lies in yours.

240
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,938
How is he feeling now?
- Better.

241
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:30,867
Harman.
- Yes?

242
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:32,566
Listen...

243
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,440
Go to the city and meet
Gurnam. Immediately.

244
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,919
I have told him everything.
Go and get money from him.

245
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,445
From uncle?
- Yes.

246
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:47,652
Why? I have already spoken to him.

247
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:52,522
You know how much your
uncle respects me.

248
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,331
He never refuses me.

249
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:56,694
Go, son.

250
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,928
Go.
- Okay.

251
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:00,472
As you say.

252
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:08,646
Dear, you know how
much he respects me.

253
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:10,781
He doesn't consider
me to be his brother.

254
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,442
He considers me to be his father.

255
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:14,243
He calls me father, right?

256
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,401
Daljit.
- Yes?

257
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,437
If those beggars
come, make them go away.

258
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:34,831
Which beggars?

259
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,708
I am talking about Harman.
- Okay.

260
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:40,277
I tried to make
excuses a number of times but...

261
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,973
...these shameless
people don't spare me.

262
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,583
Father had called.
- What did he say?

263
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,844
He wants money.

264
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,077
I will send Harman,
give him some money.

265
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,547
Father orders
without giving it a thought.

266
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,726
He said, send some
money. Does money grow on trees?

267
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,826
I agree he brought me up.

268
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,998
But that doesn't
mean that I am now...

269
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,966
...responsible of fulfilling
all their needs.

270
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,397
We too have needs. We need
to fulfil them as well.

271
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:10,539
If he comes, you
don't need to entertain him.

272
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,769
Make him leave from outside
itself. I'll get going.

273
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:16,804
Listen, do get my golden
necklace on your way back.

274
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,449
Really?
- Yes.

275
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:31,552
Harman.

276
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,659
When did you come?

277
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:43,873
I think he heard everything.

278
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:45,833
Good for us.

279
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:48,343
This ends our trouble
once and for all.

280
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,879
'Lf those beggars
come, make them go away.'

281
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,076
'Does money grow on trees? '

282
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,947
'But that doesn't mean
that I am now... '

283
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,581
'... responsible of fulfilling
all their needs.'

284
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:11,525
You are back, son?

285
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:16,264
You are back, son?

286
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:19,533
Tell me.

287
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:23,276
Are your uncle and aunt fine?

288
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:24,938
Yes.

289
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,844
Uncle and aunt are fine.

290
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,814
They have sent money for you.

291
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,316
Thank God.

292
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,761
Here you go, dear.

293
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:42,367
Didn't I tell you, Gurnam
never refuses me.

294
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:44,468
He respects me a lot.
- Yes.

295
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,938
Even if the world leaves
you, your kin always supports you.

296
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,632
A brother always stays a brother.

297
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,342
I am always because of his courage.

298
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,977
I pray. May God bless you.

299
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:03,477
Oh, God.

300
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,550
Where have the relationships gone?

301
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,723
Where have they gone?

302
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:13,729
You should tell your father...

303
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,959
...what his brother
thinks about him.

304
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:20,834
The one who he considers
as God is a demon.

305
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:22,738
How can I tell him?

306
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,842
At the moment if my father is proud
and happy about something...

307
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:31,578
...then it is of the
fact that his brother...

308
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,749
...is with him in
his difficult times.

309
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,982
If I take this happiness
away from my father then...

310
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,326
...he won't be able to
survive. He will shatter.

311
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:45,329
And I won't let my father shatter
as long as I am alive.

312
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,659
But there is no solution to this.

313
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,834
I have found a solution.

314
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,737
I have given money at home.
- How?

315
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,041
I sold my bike.

316
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:03,675
What?

317
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,914
What else could I have done?

318
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:08,009
I had no other option.

319
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,287
Bless you, son.

320
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,080
Bless you.

321
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,996
God will bless you for
what you have done.

322
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,892
He will show you
new paths of life.

323
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,601
Today I'll check whether
my feelings reach her or not.

324
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:32,900
What do you mean?

325
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,401
I'll tell you.

326
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,470
Simran.

327
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:42,711
Is she looking here?
- Yes.

328
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,585
Really?
- Yes.

329
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,415
Simran, what happened?

330
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,718
I felt as if someone
called my name.

331
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:52,820
I didn't hear anything. I wonder
why you keep hearing things.

332
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,422
Simran. Simran. Simran.

333
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,593
I haven't seen you around
since a few days.

334
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,796
You know my sister
is getting married.

335
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,495
I've to do all the shopping.

336
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,970
Let me tell you, you have already
received the invites.

337
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,943
Yes. - Both of you have
to come on the 25th.

338
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,539
Of course. Don't
worry. Both of us will come.

339
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:10,445
We will surely come. It's
like a family function.

340
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,484
And honestly, I am very
excited for the wedding.

341
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:13,674
I can't wait.
- Me too. Me too.

342
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:15,913
Excuse me. Harman.

343
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,856
Harman. Sikander. How are you?

344
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:21,619
Very well. How's life?

345
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,624
Forget it. First listen to me.

346
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:27,289
Both of you remember my
sister is getting married?

347
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:28,764
And both of you have to come.

348
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,436
Great. With your
brother-in-law? - Yes.

349
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,765
It's all in the family.
- Yes. Right.

350
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:36,874
Let me tell you. The groom's
family should also know...

351
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,411
...that I too have smart friends.

352
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:41,708
We will be smart to the core.

353
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,974
He will dress up so well that
you should inform the girls.

354
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,746
We'll finish it off there itself.
We'll get them married there itself.

355
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,549
Yes. Yes. Perfect. Fine.

356
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:50,815
Okay, I'll make a move
now. Just a minute.

357
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,547
Excuse me. Hi.

358
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,824
So, you want to go attend it?

359
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,617
You don't need to ask.

360
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,754
I'll get another chance
to get close to Simran.

361
00:21:58,831 --> 00:21:59,820
Yes.

362
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,459
We will go in style then.

363
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:04,331
But from where will
we get stylish clothes?

364
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:06,862
We'll come up with something.

365
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,277
Look on the stage. Simran.

366
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,041
We will go with an
excuse to give the gift.

367
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:22,548
We will click a photo with Simran.

368
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:23,677
Okay. Come.

369
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,989
My daughter is looking prettier.

370
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:26,752
Hold on.

371
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:27,917
Let's go now.
- No. Just a minute.

372
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,426
First a photograph, please.
- Okay.

373
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,056
Me too.
- Yes.

374
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,496
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

375
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,837
Congratulations!

376
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:42,462
Let's sit.

377
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,437
Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello.

378
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,337
What is this? Where's your husband?

379
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:48,446
He is always busy.

380
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,047
It's enough that we are here?

381
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,448
When are you getting
your daughter married?

382
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,782
My marriage? No, uncle.

383
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,583
Don't even think about my marriage.

384
00:22:57,956 --> 00:22:59,890
I still have a lot to do. Right?

385
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,754
Yes. - I am not interested
in getting married.

386
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,055
Fine. If you don't want to.

387
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,828
But the whole city is
looking at you. - Yes.

388
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,764
How grand will Mahinder
Singh's daughter's wedding be?

389
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:12,461
Brother, Simran is
our only daughter.

390
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:15,037
Her wedding will be a grand affair.

391
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,504
And then we have brought
up Simran like a princess.

392
00:23:20,813 --> 00:23:22,713
She will marry a prince.

393
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:23,770
Mom. It's okay.

394
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:28,444
Buddy, I love Simran
more than my life.

395
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:33,720
But there is a lot of
difference in our status.

396
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,496
I wonder when will I be
able to tell her how I feel.

397
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:40,687
Yes?

398
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,467
Why are you looking at my niece?

399
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:45,996
Hello.
- I seek your blessing.

400
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:48,667
The thing is, son...

401
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:52,774
...there are hundreds
like you over here.

402
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:55,404
Stay within your limits.

403
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:58,783
You don't forget where you stand.

404
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:01,542
Your land is yielding gold?

405
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:04,050
You don't have anything.

406
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,421
Your father is on deathbed.

407
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,953
Who knows when...

408
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:13,295
You cannot even afford
to buy medicines for him.

409
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,401
And there might be
a time when you...

410
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:18,661
...won't be able to
afford a square meal.

411
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:22,365
The thing is...

412
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,772
Great clothes.

413
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,940
You must have borrowed them.

414
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:30,904
The thing is...

415
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:36,782
Now that you are at the
wedding, you should enjoy it.

416
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:39,787
Look there. There are
a lot of food stalls.

417
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:41,416
Indian, Chinese.

418
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:46,056
Grab a plate and start eating.

419
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:50,696
And... remove the thought...

420
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:54,404
...of my niece from
your mind permanently.

421
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:55,462
Got it?

422
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:58,042
Scram. Got it?

423
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,404
Because beating knows no friends.

424
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,442
Get lost from here.

425
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:27,428
Stays in a hut and
dreams of a palace.

426
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:30,038
Cat caught your tongue now?

427
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,068
Why are you so quiet? What is it?

428
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:36,005
This is a limit, Karam Singh.

429
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:37,571
Now this is a limit.

430
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,048
How many times more will
we have to come here?

431
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:46,051
I swear I feel embarrassed
to come to your house now.

432
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,782
Karam Singh, don't
you feel ashamed?

433
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,062
What are you made up of?

434
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:54,559
Tell us, when will
you return our money.

435
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:59,928
Otherwise we will have
to... look for alternatives.

436
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:02,029
You can use all the
alternatives you want.

437
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:03,567
He won't feel ashamed.

438
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:06,968
You haven't paid us interest
since so many months.

439
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,940
How will you return
the principle amount?

440
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,473
Why are you being stupid?

441
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,444
Sell your land and
get over with it.

442
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:16,951
If this continues,

443
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:19,889
your land will be able to
cover only the interest amount.

444
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,826
Hence be smart. Be smart.

445
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:25,260
Lala.
- Who is?

446
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,670
I very well know what you mean.

447
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,669
We aren't running
away. We will repay the loan.

448
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,543
Will repay it?

449
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,541
Who? You?

450
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,349
How much land do you own?

451
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:54,017
About an acre.

452
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:55,415
One.

453
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,391
That too is mortgaged to us.

454
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,554
You don't work.

455
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:02,560
- How will you repay our loan?
- Forget it.

456
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:03,996
Let's talk to his father.

457
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:05,836
I wonder how much longer
he will stay alive.

458
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,838
Lala! Mind your manners.

459
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,901
If I forget my manners then you'll
have to pay a heavy price for it.

460
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:12,671
Harman. Calm down.

461
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,880
Mr. Lala, please don't
mind what he said.

462
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,041
Try to understand our problem.

463
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,778
We will repay all
the money we owe you.

464
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:24,978
Fine.

465
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:27,347
Fine.

466
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,627
But talk to your prince.

467
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:32,929
Right now only the mice
in the house are starving.

468
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,630
Soon, you too will be starving.

469
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,798
We want our money back. That's it.

470
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:40,428
Another thing.

471
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:44,406
If we don't get our money
on time along with interest...

472
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:46,437
...then you will have to
face the consequences.

473
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:47,842
Did you look at his attitude.

474
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:50,074
They act differently
when they ask for it...

475
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:51,441
...and differently when
they have to return it.

476
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:53,008
Useless.

477
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:55,513
Who did you call useless?
- Stop it.

478
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:59,023
Stop it, son. Stop it.

479
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:04,389
Sir, I beg of you.
Have some mercy on me.

480
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:07,722
We go a long way back.

481
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:11,425
Do me a favor. Give me some time.

482
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,934
I'll return the
money with interest.

483
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:16,496
Fine.

484
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,834
Fine, Karam Singh.

485
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:27,010
We will leave because
of our relationship.

486
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:35,622
But remember, you will
have to pay the money back.

487
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:37,317
Okay?

488
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:38,818
Yes.

489
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:46,865
And if we don't get our money
back, we won't spare you.

490
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,049
Father. What happened, father?

491
00:28:58,283 --> 00:28:59,272
God!

492
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:02,976
Either make my life bearable...

493
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:07,287
or end my life.

494
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,348
Stop it.

495
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:09,992
What are you saying?

496
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:12,421
God.

497
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:14,892
Have mercy.

498
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:18,497
Relieve us from this pain.

499
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:21,831
We cannot take it anymore.

500
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:24,700
God.

501
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,404
Please help us.

502
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:31,906
Show us a way, God.

503
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:35,650
A million desires shattered.

504
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:42,059
Life squirms.

505
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,059
It's getting difficult to live.

506
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:55,500
Ending life seems easier.

507
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:03,744
No one hears what
lies in my heart.

508
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:10,010
No one hears what
lies in my heart.

509
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:14,082
The pain is now unbearable.

510
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:19,821
My soul is crying.

511
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:23,824
The pain is now unbearable.

512
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:29,704
It is intolerable.

513
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:35,512
The pain is now unbearable.

514
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:05,303
My desires didn't come true.

515
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:09,278
I couldn't complete my education.

516
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:15,545
All I got is insult.

517
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:22,690
World laughs at our
misstep and misfortune.

518
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:29,058
Dear and near ones have
started this tradition.

519
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:34,461
No one supports the
one who is losing.

520
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,744
No one supports the
one who is losing.

521
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:44,540
The pain is now unbearable.

522
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:50,645
My soul is crying.

523
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:55,950
The pain is now unbearable.

524
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:06,902
What happened, son?

525
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:08,461
That's enough.

526
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:11,567
I cannot take it anymore.

527
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:15,740
I wonder for what
is God punishing me.

528
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:20,951
I work hard all day long to
improve our financial condition.

529
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:22,781
But it doesn't help.

530
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:25,556
I want to give my parents all
the happiness in the world.

531
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:30,494
I don't want... them to beg anymore.

532
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,595
But I cannot find a way to do it.

533
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,994
I feel as if sorrows don't
like anything other than me.

534
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:46,870
There are always ups
and downs in life.

535
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,941
If you keep faith in God he
will make everything alright.

536
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:53,944
I too used to be
patient thinking that.

537
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:56,085
That God will certainly help me.

538
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:58,517
That He will certainly
help me one day.

539
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:04,557
But priest, I cannot tolerate it
when someone insults my parents.

540
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,395
I feel like doing
something to that person.

541
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,588
No, son.

542
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,934
At that moment,
I feel so helpless that...

543
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:13,931
I have realized one thing.

544
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,807
Success is the biggest
thing in this world.

545
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,536
You tell me, had
I been successful...

546
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,703
If I had money, I could've
improved the condition of my family.

547
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:27,077
I could've told Simran how I feel.

548
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:29,879
But neither could I improve
the condition of my family...

549
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:31,755
...nor could I get the one I love.

550
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,322
I have realized it.

551
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,727
There is just one solution
to all my problems.

552
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:37,762
Success.

553
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:42,061
God should just show me
a way somehow. That's it.

554
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:46,592
Look at this.

555
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,329
What is this, priest?

556
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,106
Harman, what did you think?

557
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:57,007
I won't know when
you are in trouble?

558
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,383
You are my son.

559
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:05,616
You mean the world to me.

560
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,827
Now I, too, have realized...

561
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,587
that you won't attain
success over here.

562
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,828
The condition of your
family, Simran's love...

563
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,532
...will overpower you.

564
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,601
Son, you will get
surrounded with more trouble.

565
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,575
Hence I have given you my
friend Gurvinder's card.

566
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:34,679
He stays in Bangkok.

567
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,546
He owns a big hotel. And
he is a very nice person.

568
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,279
Bangkok.

569
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:41,858
I have spoken to him about you.

570
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,023
You should go and meet him.

571
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:48,332
Work hard and find a
solution to your problems.

572
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,800
Priest, you have
given me a new life.

573
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,096
I will really work very hard.

574
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:57,063
Harman...

575
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,739
Prepare to leave for Bangkok.

576
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,003
I've made arrangements for
your travel and tickets.

577
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,844
Don't worry about your parents.

578
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,585
I'll take care of them.

579
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,388
Don't worry about them.

580
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,316
Go and work hard. God
will give you success.

581
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:23,890
Son...

582
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:28,068
Why are you crying?

583
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:32,673
He is not going there to have fun.

584
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:34,575
He is going there to work.

585
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,978
You should smile and bless him.

586
00:35:37,048 --> 00:35:38,310
Don't feel low.

587
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,577
Let me at least have
a good look at my son.

588
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,050
I wonder when he will
meet his mother again.

589
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:48,324
I cannot live a
single day without you.

590
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,427
And he is going abroad.

591
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:52,460
I wonder for how long.

592
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,964
Mother, what are you saying?

593
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,799
I am not going
there to settle down.

594
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,062
I am going there to work.

595
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,463
I will come back soon.

596
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:02,571
And then, I have to come back
and eat food cooked by you.

597
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:03,933
I have to, don't I?

598
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:05,771
Come on, it's time for me to leave.

599
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,539
Both of you send
me off with a smile.

600
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:48,672
Hello.
- Hello, sir.

601
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,348
I am Harman Singh
from Punjab. India.

602
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,316
I have come to meet
Mr. Gurvinder Singh. - Ok.

603
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:55,374
He knows me.

604
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,611
Okay. Please wait there.

605
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:00,280
He is in a meeting.
I'll just inform him. - Okay.

606
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:01,923
Tell him to wait. I am coming.

607
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:02,891
Okay, sir.

608
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:05,862
I am thinking of something,
Mr. Gurdeep Singh.

609
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,824
From Omni Hotel we should change...

610
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,367
...the name to No Money Hotel.

611
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,966
We have invested so much in it
but we haven't gained anything.

612
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:15,906
You are unnecessarily getting
impatient, Mr. Tal Singh.

613
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,737
We have five hotels.

614
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,038
One in Bangkok, one in Pattaya.

615
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:21,903
Two in Chiang Mai. One in Phuket.

616
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,311
They are all useless.

617
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:24,939
I say we should sell them.

618
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:26,807
Even if they make
them potato stores...

619
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:28,579
...they will earn something from it.

620
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,909
Mr. Tal Singh...

621
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,650
Papa, we have built this
hotel with a lot of love.

622
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:36,015
How can we sell it?

623
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,828
We have built it with a lot
of love, but people hate it.

624
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:41,465
Have you seen anyone come in?

625
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,794
But, uncle... - Keep quiet.
You don't know anything.

626
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,563
Don't talk about business.

627
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:47,998
Mr. Tal Singh, be a little patient.

628
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,903
There is a saying in Punjab.

629
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,476
You suffer loss in the first year.
You breakeven in the second year.

630
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:53,635
And you make profit
in the third year.

631
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:55,905
The third year passed
three years ago.

632
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,875
Nothing is going to work in here.

633
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,315
If things continue in this
manner we will lose everything.

634
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:03,912
Then both of us will wash
utensils in a restaurant in Punjab.

635
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:06,588
You have to clean the big
bowl by getting inside it.

636
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,917
It is difficult for me.

637
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,653
My decision is
final. Sell the hotel.

638
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:10,751
The rest depends on you.

639
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:12,227
Uncle.
- Mr. Tal Singh.

640
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:17,323
Dad!

641
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:23,267
Sit down. Sit down. Don't stand.

642
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,366
Such a small thing
won't make a difference.

643
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,235
NRI? Over here?

644
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:31,604
Mr. NRI?

645
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,707
Who is NRI?

646
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:35,876
You.
- Me?

647
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,309
Yes.
- NRI?

648
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:39,046
I am not NRI.

649
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,552
I am permanent Thai.

650
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,352
I was born in the hospital
adjoining this hotel.

651
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,356
Here's the school
in which I studied.

652
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:47,461
There's the house where I lived.

653
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,793
This is the hotel
I entered to ruin myself.

654
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:52,668
I got it. You didn't recognize me.

655
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:55,262
I am Harman Singh. From your
village where you have a bungalow.

656
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:56,931
Which village? Which bungalow?

657
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,367
Who are you talking about?

658
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:00,411
You are Harpreet Singh.
You have a bungalow.

659
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:02,946
Don't take Harpreet
Singh's name, I tell you.

660
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:05,072
Don't take that inauspicious
person's name in my hotel. - Why?

661
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:07,648
He is darned. I called him
here for its inauguration.

662
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:10,447
Once he came here no
customer ever came here.

663
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,380
Don't take his name here.

664
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,683
I have another one in Shimla, who
is a profession with a fake degree.

665
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:18,592
Don't take his name
either, I tell you.

666
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,631
They are your
brothers-in-law?

667
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:23,030
No. They are my brothers.

668
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,700
Listen, you are stupid.

669
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,737
How can anyone look like
their brothers-in-law?

670
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,296
Sir.

671
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,372
Don't take their names.

672
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,736
- Mr. Harman?
- Yes.

673
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:35,937
Gurvinder here.

674
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:36,877
Hello.

675
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:37,937
God bless you.

676
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:39,709
Meet my daughter, Preet.

677
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:41,581
Hi.
- Hello.

678
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,785
And he is...
- I have met him.

679
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:45,680
I have met him. I have met him.

680
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,388
Priest had called me.

681
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:48,787
He spoke about you.

682
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:51,061
Let's go home and talk.

683
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:52,824
Come on.

684
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:05,908
What I told you is the truth.

685
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:09,043
Sir, I cannot believe it.

686
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,549
Your hotel is at the right
place. At the prime location.

687
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,308
And you are saying that
it is not doing well.

688
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:15,647
It should be doing very well.

689
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:21,551
It should, son. But the truth
is, it is not working well.

690
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,555
We are suffering loss every year.

691
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:27,454
I didn't tell the priest that.

692
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,033
And you shouldn't either.

693
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:32,926
He might feel bad.

694
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,334
No. I won't, sir. Don't worry.

695
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:38,567
Finally, I have accepted
defeat and decided...

696
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,970
...that I will sell this hotel.
- What are you saying, sir?

697
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,572
Don't take such a big
decision in such haste.

698
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:46,405
Look...

699
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:48,010
Think over it.

700
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:49,977
God will show you a way.

701
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:52,344
Leave it, Harman.

702
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:54,981
It's no use telling that to father.

703
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:59,755
I feel after mother passed away...

704
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:02,989
...father has lost
the courage to fight.

705
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,364
Preet.
- Sir.

706
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:06,827
I am sorry for interrupting.

707
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,262
Look, I am speaking out of turn.

708
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:12,800
I know nothing about
running a hotel.

709
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:17,441
But I am confident about
my courage and my thinking.

710
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:20,544
And on the basis
of this confidence...

711
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:22,677
...I am telling you that
I will try to run your hotel.

712
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:23,946
Give me just one chance.

713
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,683
I praise your thought
and confidence, son.

714
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:29,852
But there is a lot of difference
in thinking something...

715
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:31,087
and doing something.

716
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:33,593
This isn't so easy.

717
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:35,524
How will you do it?

718
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,325
Papa, why is it not possible?

719
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,767
Perhaps God has
sent him to help us.

720
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:48,801
Okay.

721
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:54,750
If you say, we will
try this out as well.

722
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:59,755
I wonder what God desires.

723
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:03,059
Oh, papa. I love you.

724
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:05,751
Great.

725
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,463
What a great idea.

726
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:11,767
So you have decided that
we shouldn't sell the hotel.

727
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,567
And try for another 4-5 months.

728
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:16,664
And this boy, what
is his name? Harman.

729
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:19,402
He should be given a
chance. He will run this hotel.

730
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,875
What you are saying is beyond me.

731
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,416
Sir, this is what
Harman thinks as well.

732
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:30,511
He too thinks that if we try
our hotel might make a profit.

733
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:35,757
No.

734
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,589
He thinks he can run this hotel.

735
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:40,456
You too think that
he can run this hotel?

736
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,795
I say he is from a
small village in Punjab.

737
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:46,996
He doesn't have a hotel management
degree from London or Paris.

738
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,799
You don't, right?

739
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:50,841
The thing is that the hotel
that didn't do well in 2005...

740
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:54,478
2007, 2009, how will he make
it run successful in 2011?

741
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:56,939
Son, what different will
you do in the hotel...

742
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:59,505
...that the hotel will run
well in the fourth gear?

743
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,680
Son, don't make it go very fast.

744
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:03,782
It might land up in the sea.

745
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,614
No. This is a hotel,
not a firecracker...

746
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:10,286
...which you can burn and the
hotel will start doing well.

747
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:13,557
Mr. Tal Singh, you are
getting worried for no reason.

748
00:44:14,532 --> 00:44:17,865
I think we should try it
for another 3-4 months.

749
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,027
Perhaps God might get generous.

750
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,703
God will be generous when He wills.

751
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,638
For the time being with His grace
we are getting such huge bills.

752
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,474
The burden of which we
are bearing. You are great.

753
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:31,473
This game that you are
playing is your decision.

754
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,413
I am not a part of
this game. That's it.

755
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:38,781
Papa, it's okay. Have courage.

756
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,685
I feel everything will be alright.

757
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:43,851
Fine, Mr. Tal Singh.

758
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:46,594
Now I will bear the burden alone.

759
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:50,630
But I don't know
why I trust this boy.

760
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:53,428
No, you can. I have no problem.

761
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:56,102
Just remember what I said
about restaurants in Punjab.

762
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,774
Big bowls. You have to sit
inside them and clean them.

763
00:44:58,976 --> 00:44:59,965
Fine.

764
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:03,838
I will get inside the bowl, you can
get inside the wok and clean it.

765
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,843
Girl, you won't be able
to clean even a small bowl.

766
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:10,277
But your ideas will clean us.

767
00:45:11,355 --> 00:45:12,344
Move aside, son.

768
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:20,319
Harman, I will bear
this burden alone now.

769
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:23,592
Take God's name and start
the work from tomorrow.

770
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:25,460
I am with you.

771
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:26,959
Me too.

772
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:28,894
Thank you.

773
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:38,678
God Almighty, these
people trust me a lot.

774
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:42,685
I want to make a
small prayer to you.

775
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,318
Please help me
succeed in this work.

776
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,824
Answer my prayer, God.

777
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:51,787
I... I will never ask for
anything else in life.

778
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,727
Answer my prayer, God.

779
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:18,950
'I came to try my luck
in this foreign country'

780
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,728
'God knows, how will be
I success in this country.'

781
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:27,955
Send me all file, I can over look.
- Yeah.

782
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:29,897
Okay, Hello.
- Yes, I'll see too.

783
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:31,933
Hello, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

784
00:46:32,002 --> 00:46:34,470
I'll talk to you later.
- What's happening, son?

785
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:39,968
There is neither any smile on your
face nor any customers in the hotel.

786
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:42,439
You have been here
since two months.

787
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:43,946
You haven't rented even two rooms.

788
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:46,744
The rooms will get
rented, Mr. Talli.

789
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:48,609
Work progresses slowly.

790
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:51,651
And as they say patience pays.

791
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,452
No, that's true. But sometimes
being too patient kills you.

792
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,553
You might think that patience pays.

793
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:01,864
But we are getting
electricity, telephone bills.

794
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:06,961
Salary, insurance, taxes. We
have to spend a lot of money.

795
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,567
Do whatever you want to quickly.

796
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:12,876
Either speed up or catch a flight.

797
00:47:15,312 --> 00:47:17,473
I am not here to catch
a flight, Mr. Talli.

798
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:19,949
I am here to succeed.

799
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,976
I will make your hotel run well.

800
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,498
He makes you think.

801
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,696
He makes you work as well.

802
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:46,903
He places a pauper
where a king sits.

803
00:47:47,444 --> 00:47:52,643
Whoever follows His path...

804
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:58,050
...is shown the path
of success by Him.

805
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:04,023
He is never far away from you.

806
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:06,994
He is always with His people.

807
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:10,428
Only He knows what He does.

808
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:16,838
We don't know what pleases Him.

809
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:19,876
We don't know what pleases Him.

810
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:23,243
We don't know what pleases Him.

811
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:29,476
Thank you.

812
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:34,053
- Hello.
- Just a second.

813
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:34,780
Hello!

814
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:35,882
Give them 409.

815
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:36,754
Thank you.

816
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,260
It's 409.
- 409.

817
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:39,728
Enjoy your stay. Thank you.

818
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:42,828
Mr. Harman.
- Yes.

819
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:45,729
I couldn't find a
solution to this problem.

820
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,703
You have created quite a buzz.

821
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:50,701
Sir, I told you patience pays.

822
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:54,937
Let us be a little more patient
then we will reap profits.

823
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,972
Sir, be patient.
That will come true.

824
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:02,351
Then we will share the profits.

825
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:05,478
You are hard working and naughty.

826
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:10,418
Are you alright, Harman?

827
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:13,561
I am fine, father.
Tell me, how are you?

828
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:16,458
You don't worry about me.

829
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:20,034
Listen, I got your first salary.

830
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:22,899
Now I won't eat any medicines.
I will stop eating all of them.

831
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:26,733
Okay, son? Bless you.
Here, talk to your mother.

832
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:31,344
- Harman.
- Hello, mother.

833
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:34,508
Bless you, son. Be
happy. Live long.

834
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:37,382
How are you, son? Are you alright?

835
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:38,648
Yes, mother. Everything's fine.

836
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:40,553
I am fine and work
is also going fine.

837
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:42,858
You just take care of
yourself and father.

838
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:45,929
Son, I miss you a lot.

839
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,062
Your father too misses you a lot.

840
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,963
This house feels
deserted without you.

841
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:57,670
My innocent mother,
don't say such things.

842
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,874
It's just a matter of a few
days. Then I will come back.

843
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:03,776
You just take care of
yourself and father until then.

844
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,306
Okay, son. Bless you.

845
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:07,372
Goodbye.

846
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,686
Look, he has started sending money.

847
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:14,323
Your condition is improving.

848
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,755
Are you happy now?

849
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:17,651
I am happy, priest.

850
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:21,028
But now I cannot
stay away from my son.

851
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:24,358
I am more sad that my son is away...

852
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:29,804
...than I am happy that
he has started earning.

853
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:58,324
Harman, there was a time
when our hotel was dead.

854
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:00,493
Now look, buses full of
tourists are coming here.

855
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:05,432
We told you to create a buzz, but
you have brought in quite a crowd.

856
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:11,875
I say, Mr. Tal, it's now time
to reap profits. Together.

857
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:14,916
Go and attend to those ladies.
Ome on. - Yes.

858
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:17,444
Arrange for wheel
chairs. They are old.

859
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:19,521
Yes.

860
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,921
Harman. Harman.

861
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,080
This is great.

862
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,952
What happened, sir?

863
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:27,588
You know, SOTC, Thomas
Cook and Seeta Travels...

864
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:30,360
...have sent an offer to
tie-up with our hotel.

865
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:31,765
Really?
- Oh yes.

866
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:34,594
I can't believe this.

867
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:37,631
You have done it, my boy.

868
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:38,964
You have done it.

869
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:42,675
You had come from India to
do something for yourself...

870
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,980
...but you also did
a great deal for us.

871
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:49,015
Thank you very much, my son.

872
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,519
What are you saying, sir?

873
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:53,448
Okay. Now I am going
to the Sikh temple.

874
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:55,119
To thank God.

875
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,115
Okay.

876
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,958
Thank you very much, God.

877
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:10,670
I will give my parents all
the happiness in the world.

878
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:13,498
And...

879
00:52:28,459 --> 00:52:29,824
Even after I came so far...

880
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:32,427
...you were never
away from me, Simran.

881
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:37,430
You always walked with me.

882
00:52:39,403 --> 00:52:44,102
With every breath I take,
I find you closer to me.

883
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:46,769
Shall I tell you something, Simran?

884
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:51,373
I feel that soon
I will be capable enough...

885
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,806
...to tell you how I feel about you.

886
00:52:54,818 --> 00:52:55,807
Can...

887
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,814
Can I say something?

888
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:04,550
No matter how far
away you are, Simran...

889
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:11,664
...I know that till
I don't tell you how I feel...

890
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:14,300
...you won't agree to marry anyone.

891
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:15,927
Right?

892
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:21,908
I am sure about that.

893
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:23,937
Marriage. Marriage. Marriage.

894
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:26,005
Uncle, the era of selecting boys...

895
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,051
...through photographs is long gone.

896
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:31,449
I mean nowadays you meet...

897
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:34,916
understand and then form a relationship.

898
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,589
Saw? My daughter is so smart.

899
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:40,359
She understands
relationships so well.

900
00:53:40,597 --> 00:53:44,055
She will act sensible while
selecting her life partner as well.

901
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:47,799
Simran, we are proud of you.

902
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:49,602
And we are always with you.

903
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:52,068
We know, whatever
decision you take...

904
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:53,776
...it will be for the
betterment of your family.

905
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:56,608
Thanks, dad. I love
you. You are the best.

906
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,669
My daughter.

907
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:14,887
Thank you very much.

908
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:17,830
With your coopration, I'll take
my hotel to no.1 postion.

909
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:18,890
No.1!

910
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,300
Cheers.

911
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:22,568
There is quite a
buzz. Quite a buzz.

912
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:24,697
I have never seen such
a crowd even in MB Mall...

913
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:26,537
...as much as I am
seeing in our hotel.

914
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:30,546
I am very happy. I am
shedding tears of joy.

915
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:31,603
Tears?

916
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:33,741
First time since
the last six years...

917
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,013
...I told a customer over the
phone, Sorry, no rooms available.

918
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:42,658
This is all thanks to Harman.
- Yes, of course.

919
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,318
I am proud of you, son.

920
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:47,554
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much. - Me too.

921
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:50,456
Uncle Talli, now we won't
have to go to Punjab...

922
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:52,593
...and clean the utensils, right?

923
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:56,770
Now we are flourishing
and reaping profits.

924
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:59,034
Now we don't need to get
into the utensil and clean it.

925
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:01,900
Harman...

926
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:05,739
Whatever you did is
no less than a miracle.

927
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,883
Really great.
- Thank you, Preet.

928
00:55:08,385 --> 00:55:09,443
Thank you very much.

929
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,879
Sir, I was thinking that after
putting the other hotels...

930
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:17,283
...of our chain on the track of
success I should go to Punjab.

931
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:18,758
Yes. Sure. Why not, son?

932
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:20,694
If you want to, go to Punjab.

933
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:24,729
Anyway, you have put our
hotel on the fifth gear.

934
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:26,928
We just need to keep our
foot on the accelerator.

935
00:55:27,938 --> 00:55:29,030
We have had enough to drink.

936
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:31,536
We might get a fall. We
should sit down. - Yes. Come on.

937
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:33,869
Harman, I'll...

938
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:36,835
I mean we will miss you.

939
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:40,873
I too will miss you a lot.

940
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:44,976
Honestly speaking, the
love I got in this house...

941
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:50,557
...away from my house, I will
never be able to forget it.

942
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:57,593
Actually, we won't be able to
handle such a big business alone.

943
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:02,371
We hope... you come back soon.
- Sure.

944
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:05,503
As soon as possible.

945
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:23,887
Hello, Sikander. My life.

946
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,892
What? What happened?

947
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,565
What happened?

948
00:56:35,706 --> 00:56:37,003
Is everything alright?

949
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:52,648
Priest, what happened?

950
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:55,083
Be courageous, son.
- Courageous? - Yes.

951
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:57,619
Why... why should I?

952
00:56:57,861 --> 00:56:59,351
Where is father and mother?

953
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:00,760
Mother. Father.
- Son. They...

954
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:02,627
Mother. Father.
- Listen.

955
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:04,360
Listen!

956
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:05,899
Father.
- They are no more.

957
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:10,964
What?
- They are no more.

958
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:16,242
Priest.
- They... Yes.

959
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:18,571
They are no more.

960
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:19,871
They...

961
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:24,914
Brace yourself.

962
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:27,950
You have to accept it, son.

963
00:57:29,993 --> 00:57:31,824
You have to accept whatever
He does, son.

964
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,521
We cannot do anything
against God's will.

965
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:37,956
Priest...

966
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:42,667
Father used to keep unwell.

967
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:45,063
But mother?

968
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,010
How can she all of a sudden...

969
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:52,008
What happened to her?

970
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:09,398
Your father's
illness, separation from you...

971
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:13,767
She couldn't endure this pain.

972
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:19,998
She kept waiting for you.

973
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:27,043
She wouldn't share
her feeling with anyone.

974
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:30,583
She would suffer inside.

975
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,479
Then all of a sudden one day...

976
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,352
Why do you look so lost?

977
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:39,617
Tell me.

978
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:42,058
Girdhar Singh.

979
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,632
She has left us.

980
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:50,636
Karam Singh, drink water.

981
00:58:54,544 --> 00:58:55,841
Karam Singh. Karam Singh.

982
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:57,539
Why did this happen?

983
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:02,513
Why did this happen?

984
00:59:06,323 --> 00:59:07,881
What did I gain by earning so much?

985
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,959
I have lost everything.

986
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:15,887
My parents.

987
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,829
Priest, why did...

988
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,407
You shouldn't be so
attached to anything.

989
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:30,468
Immerse them.

990
01:00:28,038 --> 01:00:30,632
Mother and father's soul must
be at peace today, Harman.

991
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:36,877
Buddy, we have finished
the deal of the land.

992
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:40,445
Now should we get rid of the itch
that NRI's bungalow gave us?

993
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:42,851
NRI's bungalow? I didn't get you.

994
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,617
I will tell you.

995
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:45,620
Listen to me. Listen.

996
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:46,781
What should I listen to? You cheat.

997
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:48,323
You fraud.
- Listen to me.

998
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,359
How dare you pretend
to be my bungalow's owner?

999
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:52,722
Listen to me.
- Get out.

1000
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:55,526
I didn't want to... - I said
get out of here. - Going...

1001
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:02,696
- How are you, Mr. NRI?
- I am not a NRI.

1002
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:04,740
No, no, no. You are a NRI.

1003
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:06,968
A Non Reliable Indian.

1004
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:08,576
Who are you?

1005
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:10,806
- I am the owner of this bungalow.
- He is the owner.

1006
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:12,672
And he?

1007
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:15,610
I kept him to look
after the bungalow.

1008
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:17,411
At Rs. 4500 per month.

1009
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:21,920
You mean he pretended to
be the owner of the house.

1010
01:01:21,992 --> 01:01:24,552
He is already
angry. Don't instigate him.

1011
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:27,356
He used to take my clothes from
my cupboard and wear them.

1012
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:28,757
Very bad.

1013
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:32,495
You mean he used your perfume,
deodorant, shampoo, soap.

1014
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:35,094
Rings, bracelets, earrings.
Your jewelry as well.

1015
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:38,368
Sir, he is a fraud. You should
inform the police immediately.

1016
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:40,807
Yes. My phone is inside.

1017
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:43,607
The phone is inside.
I will go get it. - Yes. Get it.

1018
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,341
Hey. Hey, catch him.

1019
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:48,975
He was a fraud?

1020
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,679
He was just an in
charge of the house.

1021
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:55,514
Now the real owner has
put the house on sale.

1022
01:01:58,428 --> 01:02:00,055
Something is fishy.

1023
01:02:00,597 --> 01:02:02,394
Harman brought a car
as soon as he came.

1024
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:04,032
Then also bought
the NRI's bungalow.

1025
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,966
Everyone works hard.

1026
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:07,298
Many go abroad.

1027
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:09,428
But one cannot make
so much money so soon.

1028
01:02:09,672 --> 01:02:10,934
You don't need to ask that.

1029
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,509
He must have made
money through smuggling.

1030
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:15,544
I think he has made this
wealth through stealing.

1031
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:16,909
Harnek Singh.

1032
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,409
He has made a lot of progress.

1033
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,813
Had Karam Singh been alive...

1034
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:24,376
...he would have been very
happy seeing Harman's success.

1035
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:27,287
Stop it. We are not kids.

1036
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:30,525
And then my hair hasn't
turned grey because of the sun.

1037
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,292
Tell me, what kind of
a person who attains...

1038
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:35,957
...such great success in
so little time will be?

1039
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,824
They all do illicit businesses.

1040
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:40,461
They are cheats.

1041
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:41,799
What are you saying?

1042
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,335
The world wants to progress.

1043
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:47,542
But to progress at such a pace
is not a decent man's doing.

1044
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:49,967
Hello.

1045
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,743
Hello.
- Hello, Harman.

1046
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,318
- What brings you here?
- My son Prince is getting married.

1047
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,478
You are the first
person we are inviting.

1048
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:01,523
Thank you. Have a seat.

1049
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:06,785
Harman, ever since we
have seen you progress...

1050
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,331
...I can't stop my tears of joy.

1051
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:15,032
Actually, I have told all
the boys in the village...

1052
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:18,705
...that if you want to learn anything
in life then learn it from Harman.

1053
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:20,366
Look at him.

1054
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:24,011
Be hard working like him.

1055
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,445
Harman made millions in a few days.

1056
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:32,914
He paid off all the loans
and also bought a bungalow.

1057
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,718
Now he has loads of money.

1058
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:36,882
And if we take a
bucket from his ocean...

1059
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,985
...then it won't make
a difference to him.

1060
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:40,862
You are right, Lucky.

1061
01:03:40,997 --> 01:03:42,760
It won't make a
difference to Harman.

1062
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:44,857
And our life will be made.

1063
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:48,535
Why are you talking in
riddles? Tell me what happened.

1064
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:51,673
You know we are from poor families.

1065
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:53,637
We don't make much either.

1066
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:55,936
All my land is mortgaged.

1067
01:03:56,613 --> 01:04:00,071
And he also has taken a lot of
loan. Creditors are troubling us.

1068
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:04,350
We are feeling embarrassed,
but how do we say it?

1069
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:06,346
We have been blessed by God.

1070
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:08,390
Hence we have come to you for help.

1071
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,325
What are you saying?

1072
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,855
How can I rest while
you owe something?

1073
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:15,656
Do one thing. Tell me who do
you have to pay and how much.

1074
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:16,892
I will repay your loans right away.

1075
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:17,898
Tell me.
- No, buddy.

1076
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:20,595
If you don't mind,
give us the money.

1077
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,997
We will repay them.

1078
01:04:24,474 --> 01:04:26,465
It will keep some
of our honor intact.

1079
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:29,504
You are right.

1080
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:36,343
Here you go. That was fun.

1081
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:39,085
Now we will enjoy life.

1082
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:41,318
You are right.

1083
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:44,654
Now even liquor is
giving double high.

1084
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:48,088
We fooled Harman.
- Yes.

1085
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:52,700
That poor fellow doesn't
even know what we did to him.

1086
01:04:53,736 --> 01:05:00,801
What did I gain
by gaining success?

1087
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:06,304
What did I gain
by gaining success?

1088
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:11,015
All my friends became my enemies.

1089
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:18,655
The people who
helped me grow up...

1090
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:23,393
...have now started exploiting me.

1091
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:30,304
What did I gain
by gaining success?

1092
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:36,006
'We fooled Harman.'

1093
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:41,443
'That poor fellow doesn't
even know what we did to him.'

1094
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:49,517
For his friends Harman
has become a rich guy.

1095
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,525
They removed him
from their heart...

1096
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:57,827
...and started thinking
about his money.

1097
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:08,777
Today, after creating an ocean
now he yearns for precious drops.

1098
01:06:12,048 --> 01:06:21,013
Today, after creating an ocean
now he yearns for precious drops.

1099
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:27,796
What did I gain
by gaining success?

1100
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:29,820
What is it?

1101
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,292
You took it to your heart?

1102
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,401
There are many like
Lucky and Kakka.

1103
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:36,899
You will take what
they said to your heart?

1104
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:37,962
Forget it.

1105
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,499
Hello, Headman.

1106
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,545
Hello, Harman Singh. Hello.

1107
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:44,602
Have a seat.

1108
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:47,438
Meet him.

1109
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,811
He is Mr. Mahinder
Singh. He is my friend.

1110
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:50,750
Hello.

1111
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,549
I was going to the city with him.

1112
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:54,089
You called me and I came here.

1113
01:06:54,624 --> 01:06:56,319
What is it? You called
me early in the morning.

1114
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:57,721
You do have some
important work with me?

1115
01:06:57,794 --> 01:06:58,783
Yes, Headman.

1116
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:01,722
I wanted to talk to
you about my land.

1117
01:07:02,465 --> 01:07:06,299
I... have repaid the loan and
released my father's mortgaged land.

1118
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:11,633
And now I want to donate my
land to the village committee.

1119
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:15,735
Please prepare all the
paperwork required for this.

1120
01:07:15,912 --> 01:07:17,607
That is a very nice thing, son.

1121
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:21,479
A donation for a noble cause
is a very good donation.

1122
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:26,454
Headman, I want to build a
high-tech hospital on the land.

1123
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,452
Where the poor are
treated for free.

1124
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:30,825
Well done, son. Well done.

1125
01:07:31,594 --> 01:07:33,357
Your thoughts are very noble.

1126
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:36,726
I will prepare all the
papers tomorrow itself.

1127
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:40,627
Salakna, did you give
the offerings to everyone?

1128
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:42,637
Yes, brother. I did.
- Good.

1129
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,071
Salakna.
- Yes?

1130
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,480
You go ahead. I'll just come.
- Okay.

1131
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:03,656
What happened? Why
are you laughing?

1132
01:08:03,726 --> 01:08:05,250
Did you see uncle on the way?

1133
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:06,920
The uncle who used to threat us...

1134
01:08:06,996 --> 01:08:08,987
...was made to inhale
dust because of our car.

1135
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:12,595
He is coming this way. Today
I will teach him a lesson.

1136
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:16,229
Great. Hello, Harman.

1137
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:17,430
Hello.

1138
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:19,397
What brings you here, today?

1139
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,236
Son, I wanted to talk to you.

1140
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:23,601
Come in.

1141
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:30,281
Nowadays everyone
is talking about you.

1142
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,745
Everyone is talking about Harman.

1143
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,587
Harman this. Harman that.

1144
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:38,592
The great Mr. Hardeep Singh.

1145
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:40,725
Stop the sweet talk
and come to the point.

1146
01:08:40,797 --> 01:08:42,697
Tell us what brings you here.

1147
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,800
Son, I was just passing by.

1148
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:48,032
I thought I should
pay Harman a visit.

1149
01:08:48,438 --> 01:08:50,303
And I should enquire
about his wellbeing.

1150
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:51,973
And I also had a thought in mind.

1151
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,370
I shall say it if you permit to.

1152
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:56,704
Permission granted.

1153
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:57,768
Sikander.

1154
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:02,578
Harman, you know I have
a niece called Simran.

1155
01:09:05,221 --> 01:09:06,984
She is very smart and talented.

1156
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:10,892
Nowadays, she is studying
in a university in Shimla...

1157
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,894
...after completing
her college education.

1158
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:20,265
A thought struck me.

1159
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:24,729
Both Simran and you
are very talented.

1160
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:29,906
And I also know
that you like Simran.

1161
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:33,441
Why don't I get you married to her?

1162
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:37,547
I will convince my
sister and brother-in-law.

1163
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:42,348
And I also know that Simran
won't go against her parents.

1164
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:44,521
What do you think?

1165
01:09:45,428 --> 01:09:47,328
Say yes.

1166
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,901
I need some time to think.

1167
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:58,700
Okay, son. I told
you what I thought.

1168
01:09:59,342 --> 01:10:01,936
Now you think it
over and let me know.

1169
01:10:02,378 --> 01:10:04,403
Bye.
- Bye.

1170
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:06,642
Bless you.

1171
01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:10,074
Hello.

1172
01:10:10,353 --> 01:10:11,513
What do you want to think.

1173
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:12,986
You know who was he talking about?

1174
01:10:13,055 --> 01:10:15,649
Simran. The one you
always think about.

1175
01:10:15,725 --> 01:10:17,454
Your dream is coming true.

1176
01:10:17,527 --> 01:10:20,394
Your prayers are being answered.
Why did you need time to think?

1177
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:22,397
You should have just gone
for it and said 'I do'.

1178
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:25,660
I know he was talking about Simran.

1179
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:31,070
But I also know that Simran...

1180
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:34,474
...is not a girl who
will marry someone...

1181
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:36,842
...without knowing or
understanding anyone...

1182
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,845
...just because he is successful.

1183
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:46,480
No. Simran will give her heart
to a person whom she loves.

1184
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:51,089
Simran doesn't know that a
person called Harman even exits.

1185
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:53,727
Who loves her more than his life.

1186
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:56,387
No.

1187
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,061
I will first make Simran
fall in love with me.

1188
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:06,538
Brother, for that you will have to
seek admission in Shimla University.

1189
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:09,875
Brother, what else
are you here for?

1190
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,413
Get me admitted in
Shimla University.

1191
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:15,310
I am Sikander.

1192
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:17,045
Men like uncle bow down to me.

1193
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,311
I will do something about it.

1194
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,022
Simran, here I come.

1195
01:11:53,528 --> 01:11:55,120
Our job is done, man.

1196
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,060
That's great.

1197
01:11:56,098 --> 01:11:58,293
Harman Singh, in the village
we would just sprinkle water...

1198
01:11:58,367 --> 01:11:59,356
...and say this is Shimla.

1199
01:11:59,434 --> 01:12:01,197
That is not Shimla.

1200
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:04,462
This is great. Shimla, the
land of Gods and Goddesses.

1201
01:12:04,539 --> 01:12:07,064
Himachal. Mountains
and more mountains.

1202
01:12:07,242 --> 01:12:08,504
Gods and Goddesses.

1203
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,511
Oh mountains. Oh God.

1204
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:12,179
I have a request to make.

1205
01:12:12,247 --> 01:12:13,737
My introduction goes like this.

1206
01:12:13,815 --> 01:12:15,146
My name is Sikander.

1207
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,480
All lover boys bow before me.

1208
01:12:17,686 --> 01:12:20,086
But today, I bow before You, God.

1209
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:22,189
Don't make me clear the
exams even by mistake.

1210
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:24,759
Let me stay here for
another 10-12 years.

1211
01:12:25,494 --> 01:12:28,122
Stop it. Stop it. You
are making God crazy now.

1212
01:12:28,563 --> 01:12:29,552
Look over there.

1213
01:12:30,132 --> 01:12:37,197
But no one knows where
my destination lies.

1214
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:38,261
Is this a song?

1215
01:12:39,474 --> 01:12:42,034
You are singing songs
with this fake Aamir Khan.

1216
01:12:42,444 --> 01:12:45,311
He is crazy. He always
imitates someone.

1217
01:12:46,048 --> 01:12:48,073
You know you should
think about yourself.

1218
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,447
You have gotten yourself
into big trouble.

1219
01:12:49,518 --> 01:12:50,780
What happened?
- Come here.

1220
01:12:55,223 --> 01:12:58,124
You know you drank liquor
that night in the college?

1221
01:12:58,493 --> 01:13:00,051
Warden came to know about it.

1222
01:13:00,095 --> 01:13:01,119
But I didn't.

1223
01:13:01,263 --> 01:13:03,663
The ex-students of
this college drank.

1224
01:13:03,732 --> 01:13:04,630
That's great.

1225
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,100
You didn't get the
guests registered.

1226
01:13:07,336 --> 01:13:08,826
And you drink in the college.

1227
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:10,635
You will bring a lot
of fame to our college.

1228
01:13:10,706 --> 01:13:11,798
What now, brother?

1229
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:13,165
What will happen?

1230
01:13:13,475 --> 01:13:15,409
My name is Shaku Rana.

1231
01:13:15,677 --> 01:13:18,111
I am friends with a professor.

1232
01:13:18,547 --> 01:13:21,072
He was asking for Rs. 5000.
I have brought it down to Rs. 2000.

1233
01:13:21,116 --> 01:13:24,108
And your paper will
disappear from the file.

1234
01:13:24,186 --> 01:13:25,278
Really?
- Yes.

1235
01:13:26,621 --> 01:13:28,612
A black and white
film is going on here.

1236
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,555
Look, the black is
cheating the white.

1237
01:13:30,759 --> 01:13:31,748
Hurry up.

1238
01:13:32,194 --> 01:13:33,126
That's all?

1239
01:13:33,228 --> 01:13:34,490
Of what good will this be?

1240
01:13:34,763 --> 01:13:36,230
You can take this card as well.

1241
01:13:37,332 --> 01:13:39,459
What is the pin for it?
- 0000.

1242
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:41,658
Then I will remove money from it.

1243
01:13:42,604 --> 01:13:43,400
See you.

1244
01:13:43,472 --> 01:13:44,439
Yes, do that.

1245
01:13:44,506 --> 01:13:46,133
That's all the money it contains.

1246
01:13:46,508 --> 01:13:48,806
I had Rs. 2000 for my
fees. He took that as well.

1247
01:13:49,077 --> 01:13:50,135
He conned him.

1248
01:13:50,445 --> 01:13:52,106
There are all types
of people in college.

1249
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,579
But when will my job be done?

1250
01:13:57,152 --> 01:13:58,380
There are cheats as well.

1251
01:13:58,653 --> 01:14:00,348
Look, the NRI fraud
from our village.

1252
01:14:00,422 --> 01:14:02,219
I will go teach him a lesson.
- No, no, no.

1253
01:14:02,491 --> 01:14:03,549
I recognized him.

1254
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,684
Actually, there are three
brothers with the same face.

1255
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:07,661
I met one of them in Bangkok.

1256
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:10,527
This means they are cheating
at three different places.

1257
01:14:10,832 --> 01:14:12,629
Good morning. Soni ma'am.

1258
01:14:14,302 --> 01:14:15,769
It's good afternoon.

1259
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:17,432
I am here since morning.

1260
01:14:17,506 --> 01:14:19,599
Anyway, my day begins
after I see you.

1261
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:21,767
Even if you meet me at 8:15pm
I will say good morning.

1262
01:14:21,843 --> 01:14:22,832
Soni ma'am.

1263
01:14:23,245 --> 01:14:27,272
Mr. Singh, how many times have
I told you not to call me that.

1264
01:14:27,816 --> 01:14:30,114
My name is Kiran Soni.

1265
01:14:30,452 --> 01:14:32,079
And you call me Soni (Beautiful).

1266
01:14:33,188 --> 01:14:39,320
I would like if you call me by my
first name, that is Kiran ma'am.

1267
01:14:39,728 --> 01:14:40,717
I don't mind.

1268
01:14:41,096 --> 01:14:42,723
You too call me by my second name.

1269
01:14:42,798 --> 01:14:45,164
Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh.
What does that mean?

1270
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:47,258
You too should start
calling me by my first name.

1271
01:14:47,335 --> 01:14:49,667
Call me Pritam.

1272
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:51,763
I will call you Kiran.

1273
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:54,371
You have kept your
name Pritam on purpose.

1274
01:14:55,043 --> 01:14:56,305
So that girls call you...

1275
01:14:57,446 --> 01:14:59,141
You are kidding, ma'am.

1276
01:14:59,414 --> 01:15:00,745
I was 11 days old.

1277
01:15:00,816 --> 01:15:02,681
I used to change my
nappy 25 times in a day...

1278
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:04,548
...when my family
named me Pritam Singh.

1279
01:15:04,619 --> 01:15:07,417
And you think I kept this
name on purpose, intentionally.

1280
01:15:07,489 --> 01:15:10,083
So that 28-30 years later
some Ms. Kiran Soni...

1281
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:12,218
...will come and accuse
me of such a thing.

1282
01:15:12,294 --> 01:15:13,522
This is not fair, ma'am.

1283
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:17,722
Sir.
- Yes.

1284
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:19,327
You are a gone case.

1285
01:15:20,702 --> 01:15:22,567
There comes your genuine case.

1286
01:15:22,804 --> 01:15:24,772
Here comes your
favorite student. Crumb.

1287
01:15:25,407 --> 01:15:26,203
Hi, Mark.

1288
01:15:26,274 --> 01:15:27,263
Hello.

1289
01:15:27,776 --> 01:15:29,801
How are you, dear?
- Very bad, ma'am.

1290
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:31,179
Why?

1291
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:32,736
What happened? Why
do you look so sad?

1292
01:15:32,814 --> 01:15:35,078
I had Rs. 2000 with me. I lost it.

1293
01:15:38,153 --> 01:15:39,450
Why are you looking at me?

1294
01:15:40,088 --> 01:15:41,385
Why are you staring at me?

1295
01:15:41,456 --> 01:15:43,356
As if I have destroyed your garden.

1296
01:15:43,492 --> 01:15:46,086
Mr. Singh, you are very
strict with this boy.

1297
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:47,584
I wonder why.

1298
01:15:47,729 --> 01:15:50,391
Madam, professors should
be strict with students.

1299
01:15:50,465 --> 01:15:52,057
I would suggest you do the same.

1300
01:15:52,133 --> 01:15:53,794
You shouldn't be so
soft with students.

1301
01:15:54,069 --> 01:15:55,400
Specially with such students.

1302
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:58,705
Because of you he
will ruin his future.

1303
01:15:58,773 --> 01:16:01,606
Sir, don't upset him.
- Yes, I am upset.

1304
01:16:03,478 --> 01:16:07,380
Don't worry. Come, I will
treat you a nice cup of coffee.

1305
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:09,417
Yes. Coffee will
give me some relief.

1306
01:16:10,619 --> 01:16:12,246
Great. Great, Mark.

1307
01:16:13,788 --> 01:16:16,621
They are neither players
nor jugglers nor wanderers.

1308
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:19,453
He is having coffee
with Soni madam.

1309
01:16:20,061 --> 01:16:21,756
I never even got to
eat a sweet with her.

1310
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,234
Beautiful...

1311
01:16:28,236 --> 01:16:31,672
Damsel...

1312
01:16:32,107 --> 01:16:34,701
Beautiful...

1313
01:16:36,077 --> 01:16:39,308
Damsel...

1314
01:16:41,683 --> 01:16:44,311
I feel that...

1315
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:49,019
...I should keep looking at you.

1316
01:16:49,324 --> 01:16:55,456
I should fulfill
all your desires.

1317
01:16:56,631 --> 01:17:03,537
Not Majnu, not Ranjha.

1318
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:10,605
I will top the list.

1319
01:17:11,813 --> 01:17:13,576
You are...

1320
01:17:14,783 --> 01:17:18,719
...my dream girl.

1321
01:17:19,588 --> 01:17:23,046
You are...

1322
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:26,451
...my life.

1323
01:17:28,096 --> 01:17:34,399
Without you my life...

1324
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:42,234
...is meaningless.

1325
01:17:43,545 --> 01:17:45,137
To tell you the truth, Sikander...

1326
01:17:46,748 --> 01:17:48,579
...today when I saw
Simran I felt as if...

1327
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,547
...she has become
even more beautiful.

1328
01:17:50,619 --> 01:17:52,484
Beautiful...

1329
01:17:54,055 --> 01:17:54,749
Damsel...

1330
01:17:55,023 --> 01:17:58,186
Brother, Simran is as
beautiful as she was earlier.

1331
01:17:58,326 --> 01:18:03,127
Actually, the thing is, your
feelings for her have increased.

1332
01:18:03,698 --> 01:18:07,099
If you will forgive
me can I say something?

1333
01:18:07,469 --> 01:18:09,801
Now I request you
with folded hands...

1334
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:14,474
...not to waste time and move
ahead step by step at the earliest.

1335
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,204
Work hard and get
the degree of love...

1336
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:20,472
...and make Simran
my sister-in-law.

1337
01:18:21,483 --> 01:18:23,542
Beautiful...

1338
01:18:24,519 --> 01:18:27,545
Damsel...

1339
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:28,520
Love.

1340
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:31,252
Love has a lot of
forms and aspects.

1341
01:18:31,726 --> 01:18:33,557
But love is very complicated.

1342
01:18:34,396 --> 01:18:36,990
Come on, guys. Let's
discuss about love.

1343
01:18:37,532 --> 01:18:39,159
Everyone express your views.

1344
01:18:39,234 --> 01:18:40,667
Come on, Preeto.
- First ask her.

1345
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:43,432
- You speak.
- Love.

1346
01:18:43,505 --> 01:18:45,405
Only time pass. You?

1347
01:18:46,107 --> 01:18:47,574
Love and affection.

1348
01:18:47,642 --> 01:18:51,442
I know nothing about
it. It is all nonsense.

1349
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,071
You will keep telling
only your views?

1350
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:56,174
Or you will listen to me as well?

1351
01:18:56,251 --> 01:18:58,310
So, what do you want
to say, Mr. Rana?

1352
01:18:58,586 --> 01:19:00,383
There is no such thing as love.

1353
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:02,556
These relations are just
for selfish purposes.

1354
01:19:02,624 --> 01:19:05,092
I have learnt only
one thing in life.

1355
01:19:05,326 --> 01:19:07,487
Just give and take.

1356
01:19:08,196 --> 01:19:10,289
Love is just a deal.

1357
01:19:10,365 --> 01:19:11,423
No, no, no.

1358
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:14,558
Jesus has said that one
should love everyone.

1359
01:19:15,136 --> 01:19:16,728
Forgive even the
ones who cheat you.

1360
01:19:17,205 --> 01:19:18,502
Love everyone.

1361
01:19:19,107 --> 01:19:22,076
Yes. Love is love,

1362
01:19:22,143 --> 01:19:23,167
What do I know?

1363
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:25,672
No one has ever loved me.

1364
01:19:26,381 --> 01:19:29,145
There was a movie called
'Pyar' (love), right?

1365
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:31,048
Keep quiet. There was a
movie called 'Pyar' (love).

1366
01:19:31,086 --> 01:19:32,314
Not one, there were many.

1367
01:19:32,454 --> 01:19:34,319
Like 'Maine Pyar Kiya',
'Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya.'

1368
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:36,220
'Lshq Vishq Pyar Vyar.'
'Pyar Ishq aur Mohabbat.'

1369
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,759
'Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya.'
'Pyar To Hona Hi Tha.' - Stop.

1370
01:19:39,427 --> 01:19:41,725
Come on, guys. Don't
make fun of love.

1371
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:43,757
We are having a serious
discussion on love.

1372
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:45,588
Love.

1373
01:19:47,035 --> 01:19:48,559
Love is a beautiful feeling.

1374
01:19:50,004 --> 01:19:52,666
Love is a union of two souls.

1375
01:19:53,074 --> 01:19:55,372
Harman. Sikander. You are here?

1376
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,009
What a pleasant surprise.

1377
01:19:57,479 --> 01:20:00,448
You are here? You
came here following me?

1378
01:20:01,382 --> 01:20:03,111
You came here following me.

1379
01:20:03,184 --> 01:20:05,084
Are you Heer's cousin
that we will follow you?

1380
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:08,155
I knew you are here to insult me.

1381
01:20:08,223 --> 01:20:11,192
Forget him. You come with me. Let
me introduce you to my friends.

1382
01:20:11,659 --> 01:20:13,149
That's Rana.
- Hello. - Hi.

1383
01:20:13,228 --> 01:20:14,092
Mac.
- Hi.

1384
01:20:14,162 --> 01:20:15,288
Mahi.
- Hello.

1385
01:20:15,497 --> 01:20:17,124
And he's Amit.
- Hi. - Hi.

1386
01:20:17,265 --> 01:20:20,564
And you know her. Simran.
- Hello.

1387
01:20:21,035 --> 01:20:22,297
Come, have a seat. Sit.

1388
01:20:22,804 --> 01:20:25,238
You sit here.

1389
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:28,304
So, you have come
at the right time.

1390
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,743
We are having a good discussion.

1391
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,604
You were saying something,
right? About love.

1392
01:20:34,449 --> 01:20:35,438
Yes.

1393
01:20:36,117 --> 01:20:40,247
I was saying that love
is a beautiful feeling.

1394
01:20:41,489 --> 01:20:45,255
Love... is a union of two souls.

1395
01:20:46,995 --> 01:20:48,326
Love is like worshiping God.

1396
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:50,558
Love is heaven.

1397
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:54,998
Love has no boundaries or shape.

1398
01:20:56,337 --> 01:20:57,668
Love is just love.

1399
01:20:58,506 --> 01:20:59,495
Wow!

1400
01:21:00,441 --> 01:21:03,342
I think you love someone a lot.

1401
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:07,637
Yes.

1402
01:21:09,184 --> 01:21:11,118
Something like that.

1403
01:21:11,286 --> 01:21:16,019
Well, won't you introduce
her to me? - Beautiful...

1404
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:18,157
I surely will.

1405
01:21:19,327 --> 01:21:24,492
'One day I will introduce
you to yourself.'

1406
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:30,259
Solve it.

1407
01:21:31,472 --> 01:21:36,603
You are looking around as if I have
asked you Czechoslovakia's spelling.

1408
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,071
Sir, I have been noticing
since quite a few days...

1409
01:21:41,282 --> 01:21:43,750
...that you purposely ask
me difficult questions.

1410
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:46,547
Why? Is he my enemy?

1411
01:21:47,188 --> 01:21:49,088
Do I have to share
some land with you?

1412
01:21:49,257 --> 01:21:51,248
Why share it? Ask your heart.

1413
01:21:51,392 --> 01:21:52,552
What does your heart say?

1414
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:55,529
My heart says that I should
give you a tight slap.

1415
01:21:55,597 --> 01:21:56,825
I should make you deaf.

1416
01:21:59,167 --> 01:22:01,067
I know why you are doing all this.

1417
01:22:01,636 --> 01:22:02,796
Why? Why?

1418
01:22:03,404 --> 01:22:04,769
Because Soni madam...

1419
01:22:04,839 --> 01:22:07,637
What Soni madam? What Soni madam?

1420
01:22:07,775 --> 01:22:09,640
Look at him.

1421
01:22:09,844 --> 01:22:13,211
Soni madam is a PhD. She
is not your cup of tea.

1422
01:22:14,716 --> 01:22:17,241
Soni madam is conducting
extra classes for me.

1423
01:22:17,385 --> 01:22:19,376
This time I will come
first and show you.

1424
01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:20,810
Get out.

1425
01:22:21,222 --> 01:22:22,211
Get out!

1426
01:22:22,523 --> 01:22:23,512
Go!

1427
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:26,420
She is taking extra class?

1428
01:22:27,629 --> 01:22:29,290
Don't worry, students.

1429
01:22:29,731 --> 01:22:31,665
This question won't
come in the exam.

1430
01:22:31,733 --> 01:22:33,132
It is out of syllabus.

1431
01:22:37,372 --> 01:22:40,705
So, students, this
time we have organized...

1432
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:42,333
...an education tour cum picnic.

1433
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:46,470
Right now Mr. Singh is very right.

1434
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:49,115
They will give us money
for an educational tour.

1435
01:22:49,183 --> 01:22:51,083
But we will have a picnic there.

1436
01:22:52,353 --> 01:22:53,615
It is clear.

1437
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:55,689
The ones who don't
study in classes...

1438
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,058
...what will they study
in an educational tour?

1439
01:22:58,726 --> 01:23:01,422
By the way, I like
your spirit, Soni madam.

1440
01:23:01,696 --> 01:23:04,164
Stop this nonsense and go
back to the topic of picnic.

1441
01:23:04,299 --> 01:23:05,766
Madam, you are the most beautiful...

1442
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,323
...and intelligent person here.

1443
01:23:07,735 --> 01:23:09,396
You decide where we should go.

1444
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:12,071
Mark we will go wherever you say.

1445
01:23:12,106 --> 01:23:14,404
Then we will go to Bhangra dam.

1446
01:23:14,475 --> 01:23:16,443
We will push this
foreigner from there.

1447
01:23:17,312 --> 01:23:19,371
We went there in fifth grade.

1448
01:23:19,614 --> 01:23:20,273
Really?

1449
01:23:20,348 --> 01:23:22,373
If someone would have
pushed you at that time...

1450
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:24,543
...then we wouldn't have
to plan the second time.

1451
01:23:26,387 --> 01:23:28,287
Let's go to Chail Palace.

1452
01:23:28,556 --> 01:23:30,114
There is a very good museum there.

1453
01:23:30,191 --> 01:23:32,159
We will see new things and our
general knowledge will improve.

1454
01:23:32,226 --> 01:23:33,818
And we will have a
great outing as well.

1455
01:23:34,095 --> 01:23:36,529
I see what she
says. She is right, sir.

1456
01:23:37,165 --> 01:23:40,498
I mean, sir, we will have
two benefits if we go there.

1457
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:43,033
Education and picnic.

1458
01:23:43,338 --> 01:23:44,737
Sir, we will have
fun playing there.

1459
01:23:44,806 --> 01:23:46,706
It has the highest cricket
ground in the world.

1460
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:48,574
Sir, it is such a
beautiful place that...

1461
01:23:48,643 --> 01:23:50,474
...it can awake romance
in anyone's heart.

1462
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:54,446
Place doesn't mean a lot
where romance is concerned.

1463
01:23:54,515 --> 01:23:57,109
Because romance lies in the heart.

1464
01:23:57,185 --> 01:23:59,745
Forget romance.
Let's go to Chhatbir.

1465
01:24:00,321 --> 01:24:02,255
It has been quite some
time since I met lions.

1466
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:04,115
Forget Chhatbir, son.

1467
01:24:04,192 --> 01:24:06,626
Because last year animals
in Chhatbir got angry.

1468
01:24:06,794 --> 01:24:09,319
They said Why are you keeping
us caged when he is roaming free?

1469
01:24:10,531 --> 01:24:12,431
Enough. This argument
will never end.

1470
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,559
Enough. Chail Palace. Fixed.

1471
01:24:14,702 --> 01:24:16,636
It is fixed. Chail
Palace. It is fixed.

1472
01:24:16,704 --> 01:24:19,070
Anyway, Harman has
recommended that...

1473
01:24:19,107 --> 01:24:20,734
...it is a very suitable
place for romance.

1474
01:24:20,842 --> 01:24:22,104
Wow.

1475
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:37,480
Wow.

1476
01:24:38,026 --> 01:24:39,516
What a beautiful scenery.
- Yeah!

1477
01:24:39,594 --> 01:24:41,084
What a beautiful sight.

1478
01:24:41,396 --> 01:24:45,423
It feels as if nature is welcoming
us with open arms. - So right.

1479
01:24:45,633 --> 01:24:49,160
And only fortunate ones
get such a view of nature.

1480
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:51,399
You are right.

1481
01:24:51,739 --> 01:24:53,468
But I am more fortunate.

1482
01:24:53,808 --> 01:24:56,368
Because along with this
beautiful sight of nature...

1483
01:24:56,444 --> 01:24:58,207
...I have beautiful company as well.

1484
01:24:58,579 --> 01:24:59,568
Come on.

1485
01:25:00,615 --> 01:25:04,073
Okay, Harman. Imagine, if
the girl whom you love a lot...

1486
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:08,111
...was here instead of me, then
you would have had better company.

1487
01:25:08,423 --> 01:25:10,550
Right?
- You are right.

1488
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,420
Indeed, if the girl whom
I love more than my life...

1489
01:25:16,564 --> 01:25:18,259
...would have been
with me right now...

1490
01:25:19,367 --> 01:25:21,562
...then it would indeed
be a beautiful sight.

1491
01:25:22,403 --> 01:25:23,631
Love is such a thing.

1492
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,069
Love is the best thing
God has given humans.

1493
01:25:30,311 --> 01:25:33,747
Actually, to love is
like worshiping God.

1494
01:25:34,782 --> 01:25:37,683
And it is surprising that
the person who loves...

1495
01:25:38,152 --> 01:25:43,055
...doesn't realize that he
has reached a divine zone.

1496
01:25:43,658 --> 01:25:47,389
To tell you the truth, Simran,
life is rough without love.

1497
01:25:48,196 --> 01:25:50,289
Because love is the
basic element of life.

1498
01:25:51,065 --> 01:25:54,694
Love is the beginning,
centre and end of life.

1499
01:25:56,337 --> 01:25:59,238
Wow. How romantic, Harman.

1500
01:26:01,075 --> 01:26:04,135
You know you should
write a book on love.

1501
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:06,470
I would buy all your books.

1502
01:26:07,815 --> 01:26:10,147
Now, I think we should
move a little fast.

1503
01:26:10,284 --> 01:26:11,478
The destination is quite far away.

1504
01:26:11,552 --> 01:26:12,541
Come on.

1505
01:26:14,822 --> 01:26:16,517
You are my destination, Simran.

1506
01:26:17,558 --> 01:26:19,287
And I am happy that
I got a little...

1507
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:22,393
...closer to my destination today.

1508
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:27,760
Hearts beat together.

1509
01:26:27,835 --> 01:26:30,360
Eyes met.

1510
01:26:30,805 --> 01:26:35,435
I felt shy while filling
water from the well.

1511
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:38,035
I felt shy, my friend.

1512
01:26:38,112 --> 01:26:40,706
I felt shy, my friend.

1513
01:26:41,115 --> 01:26:43,549
I felt shy, my friend.

1514
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:46,645
I felt shy, my friend.

1515
01:26:47,054 --> 01:26:49,716
I felt shy.

1516
01:26:50,658 --> 01:26:53,388
I felt shy.

1517
01:26:53,461 --> 01:26:54,450
Great.

1518
01:26:55,196 --> 01:26:58,097
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.

1519
01:26:58,232 --> 01:27:02,259
Son, you shouldn't be so excited.
It can have an adverse effect.

1520
01:27:03,137 --> 01:27:05,731
By the way, madam, I too wrote a
song today. Early in the morning.

1521
01:27:05,806 --> 01:27:07,103
Really?
- Yes.

1522
01:27:07,275 --> 01:27:10,438
Look, young man, men are dancing.

1523
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:14,542
Look, young man, men are dancing.

1524
01:27:15,082 --> 01:27:17,380
It's a different case that
they teach less and yak a lot.

1525
01:27:20,454 --> 01:27:23,150
He started writing the
song but I completed it.

1526
01:27:23,257 --> 01:27:24,246
Go on, please.

1527
01:27:24,358 --> 01:27:27,054
You shouldn't slip away
like a torn shoe, son.

1528
01:27:27,395 --> 01:27:29,226
Sometimes, men slap as well.

1529
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,598
Come listen to what I have to say.
- Yes.

1530
01:27:33,668 --> 01:27:36,466
My love is different.
He is never frank.

1531
01:27:37,004 --> 01:27:40,167
I wish he would propose to me
forgetting his anger and ego.

1532
01:27:40,241 --> 01:27:41,230
Wow.

1533
01:27:43,144 --> 01:27:46,375
I cannot be a lover boy
and squirm for my girl.

1534
01:27:47,014 --> 01:27:50,450
I will take her away
but never propose to her.

1535
01:27:50,618 --> 01:27:51,710
Understand?

1536
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:56,690
Everyone here is reciting poetry.

1537
01:27:56,791 --> 01:27:59,419
But I have a better one.

1538
01:28:00,161 --> 01:28:01,150
Here I go.

1539
01:28:01,229 --> 01:28:03,129
I am a computer-age girl.

1540
01:28:03,197 --> 01:28:05,222
I am a computer-age girl.

1541
01:28:05,366 --> 01:28:06,594
I have high approach.

1542
01:28:07,068 --> 01:28:11,095
I stay busy on the net
and I think like Google.

1543
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,100
Sikander has searched this
Google. Please pay attention.

1544
01:28:16,177 --> 01:28:17,075
Go ahead.

1545
01:28:17,111 --> 01:28:20,171
Lovers nowadays show off a lot.

1546
01:28:20,414 --> 01:28:23,679
Girls chat and boys
get stuck on Facebook.

1547
01:28:24,585 --> 01:28:27,748
One girl isn't enough.
Boys have many girlfriends.

1548
01:28:28,055 --> 01:28:30,717
Girls have ruined everything
by messing up the love stories.

1549
01:28:31,659 --> 01:28:34,822
They chat while in the class.
They don't do anything properly.

1550
01:28:35,129 --> 01:28:36,494
They chat till late in the night.

1551
01:28:36,564 --> 01:28:38,088
They never sleep on time.

1552
01:28:38,532 --> 01:28:41,763
Rash driving and
drugs is what boys do.

1553
01:28:42,203 --> 01:28:45,229
She wears such
clothes. She has lost her mind.

1554
01:28:46,374 --> 01:28:48,001
Now it's your turn.

1555
01:28:50,111 --> 01:28:52,011
Why can't I sleep?

1556
01:28:53,447 --> 01:28:55,415
Why does my heart make stories?

1557
01:28:56,617 --> 01:29:01,714
Why does romance fill in the air?

1558
01:29:03,057 --> 01:29:04,786
Why does she smile and shy away?

1559
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,091
Why does the mirror talk?

1560
01:29:10,197 --> 01:29:14,463
Someone guess whose
name is on my lips.

1561
01:29:14,535 --> 01:29:15,229
Great.

1562
01:29:15,303 --> 01:29:17,066
Great.
- Great.

1563
01:29:17,238 --> 01:29:18,262
What a poetry.

1564
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:19,463
Well said.

1565
01:29:20,274 --> 01:29:22,071
When you say yes.

1566
01:29:22,343 --> 01:29:24,402
When you get shade
in scorching heat.

1567
01:29:24,578 --> 01:29:27,706
You hear only one name when
you give your heart to someone.

1568
01:29:27,782 --> 01:29:30,080
Wow. Wow. Wow. That's great.

1569
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,311
Her name is like
that of God's to me.

1570
01:29:35,323 --> 01:29:37,291
The one I love a lot.

1571
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:40,427
She is like a breath to me.

1572
01:29:41,495 --> 01:29:44,396
I fear to say this.

1573
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:45,624
Wow.
- Wow.

1574
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,292
You are great.

1575
01:29:47,768 --> 01:29:49,497
He is the one I desire.

1576
01:29:50,037 --> 01:29:51,368
He is my dream.

1577
01:29:52,273 --> 01:29:55,765
God, make me meet my love soon.

1578
01:29:56,043 --> 01:29:57,374
Great.

1579
01:29:58,512 --> 01:30:03,643
Beautiful...

1580
01:30:04,018 --> 01:30:07,010
Damsel...

1581
01:30:07,188 --> 01:30:11,056
Damsel...

1582
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:13,593
Beautiful...

1583
01:30:14,695 --> 01:30:17,493
Damsel...

1584
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:43,154
You are my desire.

1585
01:30:43,224 --> 01:30:47,593
You are my dream.

1586
01:30:48,062 --> 01:30:57,095
Without you my life
is an incomplete song.

1587
01:30:57,638 --> 01:31:07,013
Without you my life
is an incomplete song.

1588
01:31:07,348 --> 01:31:09,179
Beautiful...

1589
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:11,618
Damsel...

1590
01:31:12,286 --> 01:31:14,220
Damsel...

1591
01:31:14,522 --> 01:31:16,581
Beautiful...

1592
01:31:17,191 --> 01:31:19,022
Beautiful...

1593
01:31:19,493 --> 01:31:21,688
Damsel...

1594
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:24,257
Damsel...

1595
01:31:24,465 --> 01:31:26,126
Beautiful...

1596
01:31:35,309 --> 01:31:41,248
I pray to God...

1597
01:31:41,415 --> 01:31:45,579
That we should
belong to each other.

1598
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:50,784
No one should come or go.

1599
01:31:51,192 --> 01:31:55,424
I will build a Taj for you.

1600
01:31:56,063 --> 01:32:00,500
You are my heartbeat.

1601
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:05,434
You are my tune.

1602
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:14,843
Without you my life is a
garden without any fragrance.

1603
01:32:15,282 --> 01:32:17,079
Beautiful...

1604
01:32:17,618 --> 01:32:19,643
Damsel...

1605
01:32:20,187 --> 01:32:22,451
Damsel...

1606
01:32:22,623 --> 01:32:24,488
Beautiful...

1607
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:27,127
Beautiful...

1608
01:32:27,361 --> 01:32:29,659
Damsel...

1609
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:31,730
Damsel...

1610
01:32:32,233 --> 01:32:34,133
Beautiful...

1611
01:32:36,637 --> 01:32:40,630
Beautiful...

1612
01:32:41,475 --> 01:32:46,037
Damsel...

1613
01:32:47,114 --> 01:32:50,743
Damsel...

1614
01:32:51,519 --> 01:32:54,420
Beautiful...

1615
01:32:55,456 --> 01:33:06,094
I wish it so happens that
even God shies away from us.

1616
01:33:06,267 --> 01:33:11,136
No twig, no wind.

1617
01:33:11,205 --> 01:33:15,608
Nothing should come between us.

1618
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:20,410
You are my dawn.

1619
01:33:20,748 --> 01:33:25,185
You are my dusk.

1620
01:33:25,586 --> 01:33:30,114
All my life...

1621
01:33:30,524 --> 01:33:35,154
My life is dedicated to you.

1622
01:33:35,462 --> 01:33:37,327
Beautiful...

1623
01:33:37,631 --> 01:33:39,656
Damsel...

1624
01:33:40,267 --> 01:33:42,394
Damsel...

1625
01:33:42,636 --> 01:33:43,568
Beautiful...

1626
01:33:43,637 --> 01:33:45,161
Beautiful

1627
01:33:45,272 --> 01:33:47,206
Beautiful

1628
01:33:47,408 --> 01:33:49,569
Damsel...

1629
01:33:50,044 --> 01:33:52,239
Damsel...

1630
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:54,439
Beautiful...

1631
01:33:54,648 --> 01:33:56,707
Beautiful...

1632
01:33:57,251 --> 01:33:59,776
Beautiful...

1633
01:34:00,554 --> 01:34:03,682
God, I love her so much.

1634
01:34:05,092 --> 01:34:08,528
What are you thinking about?

1635
01:34:08,729 --> 01:34:11,391
I think you are
thinking about someone.

1636
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:13,226
By the way, can I
say something, Simran?

1637
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,167
Looking at you I feel
as if you are in love.

1638
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:18,099
And you will have to agree to it.

1639
01:34:18,205 --> 01:34:20,105
That you are in love.

1640
01:34:20,174 --> 01:34:22,267
No. It is not so.

1641
01:34:22,376 --> 01:34:23,434
You are mistaken.

1642
01:34:24,478 --> 01:34:25,638
Mistaken?

1643
01:34:25,813 --> 01:34:27,371
That is not possible.

1644
01:34:27,448 --> 01:34:29,575
Don't tell me if you
don't want to. Your wish.

1645
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,208
Oh God. Keep quiet, stupid.

1646
01:34:31,418 --> 01:34:33,079
Don't think of stupid things.

1647
01:34:33,354 --> 01:34:34,343
Okay.

1648
01:34:47,034 --> 01:34:48,729
Come. Most welcome.

1649
01:34:48,802 --> 01:34:50,793
Soni ma'am, welcome back.

1650
01:34:53,607 --> 01:34:55,768
No problem. I will
welcome you like Air India.

1651
01:34:56,043 --> 01:34:57,032
Come.

1652
01:34:58,345 --> 01:34:59,334
Thank you, sir.

1653
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,742
Stay in your limits.

1654
01:35:01,115 --> 01:35:03,709
People who travel in rickshaw are
enjoying the luxuries of Air India.

1655
01:35:03,784 --> 01:35:04,773
Go.

1656
01:35:05,085 --> 01:35:06,814
This way. You go
this way. Be a man.

1657
01:35:07,054 --> 01:35:08,214
I will go that way.

1658
01:35:12,092 --> 01:35:14,754
You are right, Sikander.

1659
01:35:16,163 --> 01:35:18,324
Nothing can beat one's own village.

1660
01:35:21,235 --> 01:35:22,600
I have been all over the world.

1661
01:35:23,103 --> 01:35:28,336
But the happiness I get when
I come back home is priceless.

1662
01:35:28,742 --> 01:35:30,676
Well said, my friend.

1663
01:35:34,682 --> 01:35:36,479
Harman Singh.
- Yes.

1664
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:41,283
Coming back to the village feels
like coming into your mother's arms.

1665
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:45,380
You are right.

1666
01:35:47,594 --> 01:35:50,495
Sometimes I feel how
fortunate are those people...

1667
01:35:52,566 --> 01:35:54,761
...whose parents are alive.

1668
01:35:56,103 --> 01:35:59,368
And they get a
chance to serve them.

1669
01:36:03,477 --> 01:36:06,742
Buddy, I have been very
unfortunate in this case.

1670
01:36:08,649 --> 01:36:13,586
You know, when my
parents were alive...

1671
01:36:14,388 --> 01:36:16,379
...I was not capable of
doing anything for them.

1672
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:23,790
Today I am capable enough
to do everything for them.

1673
01:36:25,365 --> 01:36:27,390
But I don't have anything
except their memories.

1674
01:36:32,339 --> 01:36:33,670
I just wish for one thing.

1675
01:36:35,409 --> 01:36:40,142
No child should lose his parents.

1676
01:36:44,418 --> 01:36:45,510
Again the same things.

1677
01:36:46,253 --> 01:36:47,550
You will make me cry as well.

1678
01:36:47,654 --> 01:36:49,144
You are fortunate.

1679
01:36:49,656 --> 01:36:51,146
You got your parents love.

1680
01:36:51,692 --> 01:36:52,681
Look at me.

1681
01:36:54,661 --> 01:36:56,458
I didn't even see their face.

1682
01:36:58,532 --> 01:37:00,693
Your parents will be
happy to see you cry?

1683
01:37:03,137 --> 01:37:05,662
Buddy, only He knows
what He desires.

1684
01:37:07,374 --> 01:37:09,365
I wonder what pleases God.

1685
01:37:11,345 --> 01:37:12,334
Let's go.

1686
01:37:13,413 --> 01:37:14,402
Let's go.

1687
01:37:23,757 --> 01:37:30,287
No one stays awake
for someone at night.

1688
01:37:31,265 --> 01:37:35,201
Nor does anyone shelter
from taunts of the world.

1689
01:37:38,438 --> 01:37:45,037
God sent a mother.

1690
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:49,614
Who would endure
everything for her son.

1691
01:37:52,553 --> 01:37:57,217
Harman, look, I have brought
this dress for your wife.

1692
01:37:57,658 --> 01:38:02,357
Son, now my only wish is
that you settle down quickly.

1693
01:38:02,663 --> 01:38:05,632
And I fulfill all my desires
through my daughter-in-law.

1694
01:38:08,535 --> 01:38:15,407
She used to say she
will get me married.

1695
01:38:15,809 --> 01:38:22,612
I will bring your wife home.

1696
01:38:23,116 --> 01:38:26,085
I will bring her home.

1697
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:29,212
I am not sad that
my heart was broken.

1698
01:38:29,323 --> 01:38:33,157
I am sad for her desires
remained unfulfilled.

1699
01:38:34,161 --> 01:38:40,566
Not my land but her sky.

1700
01:38:41,268 --> 01:38:44,396
Fool, her sorrows...

1701
01:38:45,105 --> 01:38:51,044
Her sorrows swallowed her.

1702
01:38:51,111 --> 01:38:52,408
My mother.

1703
01:38:52,779 --> 01:38:58,274
My mother I lost you.

1704
01:38:58,352 --> 01:38:59,717
My mother.

1705
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:05,658
My mother I lost you.

1706
01:39:05,759 --> 01:39:07,158
My mother.

1707
01:39:07,494 --> 01:39:09,291
My mother.

1708
01:39:09,529 --> 01:39:12,327
My mother.

1709
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:17,365
My mother. - Harman Singh,
priest has cleared the blueprint...

1710
01:39:17,504 --> 01:39:18,801
...of your dream hospital.

1711
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:21,031
Work on it will start soon.

1712
01:39:21,275 --> 01:39:22,207
But, son,

1713
01:39:22,276 --> 01:39:24,608
I want you to keep visiting
so that you know the progress.

1714
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:26,472
What are you saying, Headman?

1715
01:39:26,713 --> 01:39:29,079
I have complete faith
in you and the priest.

1716
01:39:29,449 --> 01:39:31,417
Still, I will keep visiting.

1717
01:39:32,052 --> 01:39:34,384
Oh yes, did you find
out about your uncle?

1718
01:39:34,655 --> 01:39:35,781
What happened to uncle?

1719
01:39:36,523 --> 01:39:39,617
Son, he got into a deal
of a disputed property.

1720
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:44,226
He got so involved in it that
his house too is mortgaged.

1721
01:39:44,598 --> 01:39:46,293
He can become homeless anytime now.

1722
01:39:47,267 --> 01:39:50,236
Anyway, bad deeds give bad results.

1723
01:39:50,737 --> 01:39:53,433
What you sow is what you reap.

1724
01:39:56,009 --> 01:39:57,476
I will make a move, sir. Bye.

1725
01:39:57,611 --> 01:39:58,600
Okay. Bye.

1726
01:40:07,087 --> 01:40:08,452
Yes. Welcome.
- Hello.

1727
01:40:08,522 --> 01:40:10,319
How are you? Hello.
- Fine.

1728
01:40:10,457 --> 01:40:12,357
Where's uncle?
- He is inside. Come.

1729
01:40:14,027 --> 01:40:15,221
Hello, uncle.

1730
01:40:15,495 --> 01:40:16,484
Hello, Harman.

1731
01:40:18,031 --> 01:40:19,794
Bless you, son. Sit.

1732
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:22,529
So, tell me, how are you?

1733
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:24,398
Fine, with God's grace.

1734
01:40:25,639 --> 01:40:31,236
Son, I feel proud when
I hear about your success.

1735
01:40:32,546 --> 01:40:34,446
If your parents were alive today...

1736
01:40:34,648 --> 01:40:36,309
...they would have been very happy.

1737
01:40:37,351 --> 01:40:39,512
Tell me, son, what brings you here?

1738
01:40:41,655 --> 01:40:47,287
Uncle, whenever... I miss father...

1739
01:40:48,228 --> 01:40:49,422
...I think about you.

1740
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:54,366
You know... before
father passed away...

1741
01:40:55,569 --> 01:40:57,594
...he was happy
about only one thing.

1742
01:40:59,039 --> 01:41:00,028
His brother.

1743
01:41:03,076 --> 01:41:07,172
Father used to say, no matter what
difficult times we have to face...

1744
01:41:08,015 --> 01:41:09,744
Even if the world
shies away from us...

1745
01:41:10,217 --> 01:41:12,151
...but a brother is
a always a brother.

1746
01:41:12,452 --> 01:41:15,046
A kin will never shy away.

1747
01:41:16,023 --> 01:41:17,490
Only one thing gave him courage.

1748
01:41:18,058 --> 01:41:20,720
That no matter how
difficult times get...

1749
01:41:21,461 --> 01:41:26,091
...his younger brother Harnek
will always be there for him.

1750
01:41:29,202 --> 01:41:31,534
Even if my father's
courage was fake...

1751
01:41:36,076 --> 01:41:43,380
...but it gave my father some
happiness in his deathbed.

1752
01:41:45,752 --> 01:41:47,549
For the sake of that happiness...

1753
01:41:48,388 --> 01:41:50,356
...I am here to keep
my father's words.

1754
01:41:50,757 --> 01:41:54,056
Nobody will harm you
in the presence of him.

1755
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,491
Here are your property's papers.

1756
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:01,060
The one which was
getting auctioned.

1757
01:42:04,504 --> 01:42:05,493
Harman...

1758
01:42:06,673 --> 01:42:08,538
You are so nice.

1759
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:10,508
Whereas we...

1760
01:42:11,611 --> 01:42:16,310
Harman, we couldn't help
you when you were in need.

1761
01:42:17,684 --> 01:42:19,549
And now when you are rich...

1762
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,248
...you have come to help
us get out of trouble.

1763
01:42:24,858 --> 01:42:27,725
I am sorry for what I have done.

1764
01:42:29,863 --> 01:42:30,852
Look...

1765
01:42:32,499 --> 01:42:35,627
Your uncle is folding
his hands before you.

1766
01:42:37,604 --> 01:42:39,731
Please forgive me
if you can, Harman.

1767
01:42:40,173 --> 01:42:41,663
Don't apologize to me, uncle.

1768
01:42:42,175 --> 01:42:43,369
Don't apologize to me

1769
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:46,574
Apologize to those souls which...

1770
01:42:47,347 --> 01:42:49,679
...prayed for you till
they breathed their last.

1771
01:42:54,688 --> 01:42:56,178
Tell me something, uncle.

1772
01:42:56,590 --> 01:43:00,048
Why does this happen that one
brother calls another a beggar?

1773
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,152
They are born to the same mother.

1774
01:43:02,329 --> 01:43:03,523
They ate together.

1775
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:05,559
They slept on the
same bed and grew up.

1776
01:43:06,066 --> 01:43:07,499
But after they grew
up one brother...

1777
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:09,501
...started looking
down upon the other.

1778
01:43:09,636 --> 01:43:10,625
Why?

1779
01:43:12,405 --> 01:43:14,305
One brother refuses to
acknowledge the other...

1780
01:43:14,374 --> 01:43:15,705
...as his brother in the society.

1781
01:43:16,076 --> 01:43:17,771
Just because the other
brother is now poor.

1782
01:43:19,646 --> 01:43:22,410
Why doesn't a strong brother
hold his poor brother's arm...

1783
01:43:22,549 --> 01:43:24,414
...and take him up along with him?

1784
01:43:25,552 --> 01:43:27,850
Why doesn't a rich
brother not keep...

1785
01:43:28,622 --> 01:43:30,556
...even a single room
for his poor brother...

1786
01:43:30,624 --> 01:43:32,592
...when he makes a big
bungalow for himself?

1787
01:43:35,762 --> 01:43:38,458
Why doesn't a brother think
of making his brother...

1788
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,667
...sit in the seat next to
his when he buys a new car?

1789
01:43:42,602 --> 01:43:43,296
Yes?

1790
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:45,065
Is money more important now...

1791
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:49,200
...compared to all the
relationships in the world?

1792
01:43:51,444 --> 01:43:54,607
Has... has money turned
our blood into water?

1793
01:44:01,188 --> 01:44:02,177
Goodbye.

1794
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:14,428
What should I do about him?

1795
01:44:15,235 --> 01:44:16,224
Mark.

1796
01:44:16,469 --> 01:44:17,561
Fake foreigner.

1797
01:44:18,471 --> 01:44:20,063
Is something wrong with me?

1798
01:44:20,373 --> 01:44:21,772
I have a permanent job.

1799
01:44:22,108 --> 01:44:24,133
I have a good
personality. I am handsome.

1800
01:44:24,511 --> 01:44:27,412
Some get divorced on the
marital fast day because of me.

1801
01:44:28,715 --> 01:44:30,444
But Kiran Soni doesn't like me.

1802
01:44:33,086 --> 01:44:36,681
I might be able to do
something about Kiran Soni.

1803
01:44:37,624 --> 01:44:40,218
But first I need to get
rid of that tail of hers.

1804
01:44:46,733 --> 01:44:48,701
Done with your prayers, son?
- Yes.

1805
01:44:49,502 --> 01:44:52,665
You get a lot of insight
from prayers. - Yes.

1806
01:44:52,739 --> 01:44:53,728
Right?

1807
01:44:54,274 --> 01:44:56,037
I have heard you get
knowledge from trees as well.

1808
01:44:56,076 --> 01:44:57,100
You should take that as well.

1809
01:44:57,577 --> 01:45:00,239
And you should take it if you
are getting it from a professor.

1810
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,813
Right? Give it.
- Come.

1811
01:45:02,682 --> 01:45:07,312
So, how is your
friendship with Soni madam?

1812
01:45:07,454 --> 01:45:08,648
It is going just fine.

1813
01:45:08,722 --> 01:45:10,314
Madam takes good care of me.

1814
01:45:10,423 --> 01:45:12,084
We are so attached to each other.

1815
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:15,356
Hit the brakes. You are
speeding away. Let me tell you.

1816
01:45:16,496 --> 01:45:19,226
Look, son, I love you.

1817
01:45:20,367 --> 01:45:21,834
Have I ever loved you less?

1818
01:45:22,202 --> 01:45:23,533
I love you a lot.

1819
01:45:24,504 --> 01:45:26,802
You should listen to
your professor, son.

1820
01:45:27,407 --> 01:45:29,671
Look, son, even in
scriptures it is written...

1821
01:45:29,809 --> 01:45:34,109
...that a woman older
than you is like a mother.

1822
01:45:34,314 --> 01:45:37,306
And you should respect a mother.

1823
01:45:38,351 --> 01:45:40,012
Soni madam is very nice.

1824
01:45:40,153 --> 01:45:42,212
He is not getting it.

1825
01:45:42,389 --> 01:45:44,414
Look, you are a student.

1826
01:45:44,691 --> 01:45:47,524
Being a student, son,
you don't look good...

1827
01:45:47,594 --> 01:45:49,494
...calling her Soni madam.

1828
01:45:49,562 --> 01:45:51,086
You should call her madam.

1829
01:45:51,164 --> 01:45:52,631
Whenever you feel like
calling her Soni (Beautiful)...

1830
01:45:52,699 --> 01:45:54,064
There are a lot of
other girls in college.

1831
01:45:54,134 --> 01:45:57,297
But you should call her madam.

1832
01:45:57,437 --> 01:45:59,701
Okay, sir. - If this
is what you want. - Yes.

1833
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:04,807
Then I swear, henceforth,
I will address Soni madam as madam.

1834
01:46:05,045 --> 01:46:06,273
Yes. Thank you.

1835
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,042
Monkey.

1836
01:46:10,784 --> 01:46:13,446
Madam, I wanted to
ask you something. - Tell me.

1837
01:46:14,354 --> 01:46:16,720
How younger was your
father than your mother?

1838
01:46:17,057 --> 01:46:17,682
What do you mean?

1839
01:46:17,757 --> 01:46:19,088
I mean to say

1840
01:46:19,159 --> 01:46:21,593
your father must definitely
be older than your mother.

1841
01:46:22,095 --> 01:46:23,426
Uncle must be older than your aunt.

1842
01:46:23,496 --> 01:46:25,464
As goes for your maternal
uncle and aunt as well.

1843
01:46:25,699 --> 01:46:27,257
Mr. Singh, can you
come to the point.

1844
01:46:27,334 --> 01:46:28,323
I would like that.

1845
01:46:28,401 --> 01:46:31,063
This has been going on
from centuries, madam.

1846
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:34,197
It is better if the husband is
a little older than his wife.

1847
01:46:34,474 --> 01:46:35,600
It is not necessary.

1848
01:46:36,343 --> 01:46:38,436
Love has nothing to do with age.

1849
01:46:38,778 --> 01:46:40,609
Look at that. Hear that.

1850
01:46:41,214 --> 01:46:43,648
These professors have to
set an example for students.

1851
01:46:44,117 --> 01:46:45,345
You are a limit, madam.

1852
01:46:45,518 --> 01:46:48,282
Look, even in our Vedas and
scriptures it is written...

1853
01:46:49,055 --> 01:46:52,218
...that a boy younger
than you is like a son.

1854
01:46:52,492 --> 01:46:54,585
Right? So, be practical.

1855
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:55,719
What do you mean?

1856
01:46:56,062 --> 01:46:59,190
I mean if a woman walks
with a man younger than her...

1857
01:46:59,265 --> 01:47:01,790
...it doesn't look
like they are married.

1858
01:47:02,068 --> 01:47:04,036
It looks like as if she
has adopted a husband.

1859
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,073
What I mean to say is
that you should mingle...

1860
01:47:09,442 --> 01:47:11,808
...with people of your same age.

1861
01:47:12,112 --> 01:47:15,240
Like...
- Like you and me?

1862
01:47:15,615 --> 01:47:17,674
Exactly. Exactly.

1863
01:47:18,551 --> 01:47:20,348
Nobody will talk with him.

1864
01:47:21,254 --> 01:47:22,380
Hi, everybody.

1865
01:47:22,822 --> 01:47:24,084
Hello.

1866
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:25,551
Hello, everyone.

1867
01:47:26,493 --> 01:47:28,586
Why is everyone so quiet?

1868
01:47:29,396 --> 01:47:30,385
What is it?

1869
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:32,320
Why doesn't anyone say anything?

1870
01:47:32,465 --> 01:47:33,659
Is everything alright?

1871
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:36,097
Preet too is quiet today.

1872
01:47:36,236 --> 01:47:37,362
What happened? Have
you gone 'off air'?

1873
01:47:37,437 --> 01:47:39,200
Keep quiet. We don't
want to talk to you.

1874
01:47:39,406 --> 01:47:41,738
We are angry with you.
- A lot.

1875
01:47:42,342 --> 01:47:44,606
Why? Did we make a mistake?

1876
01:47:46,312 --> 01:47:48,542
Not just a mistake, a big mistake.
- Yes.

1877
01:47:49,382 --> 01:47:51,316
Where did you go
without informing us?

1878
01:47:52,185 --> 01:47:54,119
Harman, all of us are your friends.

1879
01:47:55,054 --> 01:47:56,612
You never considered
us your friend.

1880
01:47:57,457 --> 01:47:59,584
It was your duty to
inform us and leave.

1881
01:48:00,727 --> 01:48:02,354
You know how much we missed you?

1882
01:48:03,163 --> 01:48:05,028
Looks like things
are back on track.

1883
01:48:05,064 --> 01:48:06,463
I think things will
work out for you.

1884
01:48:06,533 --> 01:48:07,522
She misses you a lot.

1885
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,589
Quiet.

1886
01:48:09,068 --> 01:48:11,468
I am sorry that you felt bad.

1887
01:48:12,071 --> 01:48:14,301
But I had some important
work to do in my village.

1888
01:48:14,641 --> 01:48:16,199
Hence I had to go there.

1889
01:48:16,643 --> 01:48:18,270
But henceforth,
I won't go anywhere...

1890
01:48:18,344 --> 01:48:20,574
...without telling you and
seeking your permission.

1891
01:48:21,448 --> 01:48:22,779
Forgive me one last time.

1892
01:48:25,084 --> 01:48:27,348
Shall we forgive him? Forget
it. We should forgive him.

1893
01:48:27,487 --> 01:48:28,715
He is our friend after all.

1894
01:48:28,788 --> 01:48:29,777
Okay.

1895
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:31,582
We forgive you.

1896
01:48:31,758 --> 01:48:34,124
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1897
01:48:34,327 --> 01:48:35,294
Thank you.

1898
01:48:35,361 --> 01:48:37,488
Can we sit now?
- No. You can't.

1899
01:48:37,564 --> 01:48:38,531
It's 4 o'clock.

1900
01:48:38,598 --> 01:48:40,259
We have to go and attend
the youth club meeting. - Yes.

1901
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:42,096
There's a function. We have
very little time in hand.

1902
01:48:42,168 --> 01:48:44,159
We have made no preparations. We
haven't even decided upon a singer.

1903
01:48:44,237 --> 01:48:45,499
We have no idea what will happen.

1904
01:48:45,572 --> 01:48:48,132
Yes. - No problem. We will
decide upon a singer together.

1905
01:48:48,241 --> 01:48:50,368
Let's go. - Let's
go. - Let's go.

1906
01:48:52,445 --> 01:48:53,639
Madam. Sir.

1907
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,774
This time the function
should be better than before.

1908
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:58,142
Right, Mark?
- Of course.

1909
01:48:58,284 --> 01:49:00,514
Sir, I say, we should invite
a comedy artist like you.

1910
01:49:00,587 --> 01:49:02,020
We will have a great laugh.

1911
01:49:03,289 --> 01:49:04,779
What do you mean by comedy artist?

1912
01:49:05,325 --> 01:49:06,690
Do I look like a comedian to you?

1913
01:49:06,759 --> 01:49:08,056
He is unmannered.

1914
01:49:08,127 --> 01:49:09,287
Forget it, sir.

1915
01:49:09,562 --> 01:49:12,053
He likes your look.

1916
01:49:12,365 --> 01:49:15,357
You remind them of Gurpreet Guggi.

1917
01:49:15,768 --> 01:49:17,463
Soon they will ask you to fly.

1918
01:49:18,037 --> 01:49:19,436
Right, Mark?
- Yes, ma'am.

1919
01:49:19,639 --> 01:49:22,301
By the way, I won't even
move my wings at his behest.

1920
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:25,075
But if you say I will
soar to the sky with you.

1921
01:49:25,745 --> 01:49:28,043
It is better if we stay grounded.

1922
01:49:28,248 --> 01:49:29,408
Tell us about a singer
that belongs to earth.

1923
01:49:29,482 --> 01:49:31,507
Madam, can I say something?

1924
01:49:31,718 --> 01:49:34,551
I can sing well. If you say...

1925
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:40,216
I mean to say we should
call a nice singer.

1926
01:49:40,293 --> 01:49:42,227
What's nice according to you?

1927
01:49:42,428 --> 01:49:47,991
I mean we should call a singer
whose voice touches our hearts.

1928
01:49:48,234 --> 01:49:50,225
I mean he should be melodious.

1929
01:49:51,004 --> 01:49:53,370
Like Gurdas Mann, Sardool Sikander.

1930
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:54,667
Or Hans Raj Hans.

1931
01:49:54,741 --> 01:49:56,675
I say call Babu Mann.

1932
01:49:57,043 --> 01:49:59,671
We love ammunition.

1933
01:49:59,746 --> 01:50:01,543
Look, I am Sukhbir's fan.

1934
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:04,549
If Sukhbir comes then... Oh my God.

1935
01:50:04,684 --> 01:50:06,413
You all are suggesting big names.

1936
01:50:06,486 --> 01:50:08,181
Do you know what our budget is?

1937
01:50:08,621 --> 01:50:10,179
Did you ask their rates?

1938
01:50:10,523 --> 01:50:11,512
Not a problem.

1939
01:50:11,591 --> 01:50:13,388
You can get some money
from your provident fund.

1940
01:50:13,459 --> 01:50:15,154
Really?

1941
01:50:16,195 --> 01:50:17,184
Really?

1942
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:19,662
You don't have any kids bringing
down the courtyard either.

1943
01:50:21,067 --> 01:50:22,534
You too are single like me.

1944
01:50:22,602 --> 01:50:24,593
You don't have a husband
tucked by your side.

1945
01:50:25,171 --> 01:50:27,264
Sir, you can have your
family talks at home.

1946
01:50:27,407 --> 01:50:29,238
I think we are
straying from our topic.

1947
01:50:29,442 --> 01:50:31,808
Madam, you are
talking about Sukhbir?

1948
01:50:32,245 --> 01:50:34,179
Don't worry. Harman
knows him very well.

1949
01:50:34,514 --> 01:50:36,539
They are childhood friends.

1950
01:50:36,683 --> 01:50:37,980
Why are you staring at me?

1951
01:50:38,084 --> 01:50:40,484
You don't know. They used to play
together when they were small.

1952
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:43,987
Whenever he goes to Dubai, he
comes to receive him at the airport.

1953
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:48,326
If he goes without
informing him, he scolds him.

1954
01:50:48,394 --> 01:50:49,292
He starts crying.

1955
01:50:49,362 --> 01:50:51,125
You came without
informing me. What is it?

1956
01:50:51,197 --> 01:50:53,165
Son, why didn't you meet me before?

1957
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,589
That's great.

1958
01:50:55,001 --> 01:50:56,525
Harman, please, get your relative.

1959
01:50:56,603 --> 01:50:58,195
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1960
01:50:58,271 --> 01:51:01,172
Harman, now it is your
responsibility to bring Sukhbir here.

1961
01:51:02,108 --> 01:51:06,044
But tell him that he will be
paid in thousands and not lakhs.

1962
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:08,647
But applaud without millions.

1963
01:51:08,715 --> 01:51:10,580
Love hurts.

1964
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:12,208
Wait, I will tell you how it hurts.

1965
01:51:12,352 --> 01:51:14,320
Sukhbir is our uncle's son?
How will I get Sukhbir here?

1966
01:51:14,387 --> 01:51:16,218
Was the mountain Farhad's uncle?

1967
01:51:16,556 --> 01:51:17,386
What do you mean?

1968
01:51:17,457 --> 01:51:19,618
I mean Shirin told Farhad
to cut through the mountain...

1969
01:51:19,692 --> 01:51:21,489
...and make a river flow through it.

1970
01:51:21,561 --> 01:51:22,550
And he did that.

1971
01:51:22,729 --> 01:51:24,594
So what should I do?
I should drag Sukhbir here?

1972
01:51:24,664 --> 01:51:28,156
No, no, my brother.
My naive brother.

1973
01:51:28,234 --> 01:51:29,565
What is she asking for?

1974
01:51:30,136 --> 01:51:31,330
Just Sukhbir.

1975
01:51:32,071 --> 01:51:36,531
Saw how Simran reacted when
she heard Sukhbir's name?

1976
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:38,541
She was so happy.

1977
01:51:38,711 --> 01:51:43,239
Think, if you get Sukhbir
and make him stand before her.

1978
01:51:43,316 --> 01:51:45,284
Sukhbir will come here and perform.

1979
01:51:45,485 --> 01:51:46,782
You will be praised.

1980
01:51:47,153 --> 01:51:49,280
She will respect you.

1981
01:51:49,455 --> 01:51:53,357
She will think, A boy who
can get Sukhbir for me...

1982
01:51:53,526 --> 01:51:55,585
...what not can he
do for me in life?

1983
01:51:55,762 --> 01:51:57,354
Spend some money for her.

1984
01:51:57,497 --> 01:52:00,091
You are in love and
I am making plans for you.

1985
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:01,689
Yes.

1986
01:52:02,368 --> 01:52:03,699
You are right.

1987
01:52:05,571 --> 01:52:06,697
But what will we do?

1988
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,667
You just keep loving her my friend.

1989
01:52:09,809 --> 01:52:11,743
I am here to make plans.

1990
01:52:12,145 --> 01:52:14,136
I am Sikander.

1991
01:52:14,213 --> 01:52:17,580
And lover boys bow before you.

1992
01:52:19,485 --> 01:52:21,453
You got me there, my friend.

1993
01:52:21,621 --> 01:52:23,680
By the way, as far as ability
to afford it is concerned...

1994
01:52:23,823 --> 01:52:26,451
We need not have
one but 10-12 shows.

1995
01:52:26,693 --> 01:52:28,593
Because we have a lot of money.

1996
01:52:28,661 --> 01:52:31,357
Okay. Okay. You are lucky.

1997
01:52:32,498 --> 01:52:34,557
Sukhbir is in India.

1998
01:52:34,701 --> 01:52:36,635
You can meet him.
- Where?

1999
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:40,333
Himachal Pradesh, near Dharampur.

2000
01:52:40,406 --> 01:52:43,375
He is staying in Hotel
Victoria Continental.

2001
01:52:48,548 --> 01:52:51,312
We used to lie a lot in college.

2002
01:52:52,218 --> 01:52:53,617
Now I pray that
things work out here.

2003
01:52:53,753 --> 01:52:55,618
Don't worry. I am here.

2004
01:52:55,688 --> 01:52:58,452
I am Sikander.
- Beware. Don't show off.

2005
01:52:59,525 --> 01:53:00,719
Stay within your limits.

2006
01:53:10,203 --> 01:53:11,397
He is here. He is here.

2007
01:53:18,578 --> 01:53:20,705
Hi. How are you?
- Hello, brother.

2008
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:22,748
Hello. How are you?
- Mr. Harman.

2009
01:53:23,082 --> 01:53:25,243
Okay.
- And I am Sikander.

2010
01:53:25,318 --> 01:53:27,479
We bow before you.
- No. No. No. Don't.

2011
01:53:28,121 --> 01:53:29,349
Manager called me.

2012
01:53:29,422 --> 01:53:31,788
Show and the money is
confirmed. Anything else?

2013
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:35,286
Yes. Brother, I wanted to talk
about something else as well.

2014
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:36,328
It's a little private.

2015
01:53:36,395 --> 01:53:38,454
Oh. Okay. Come.

2016
01:53:38,531 --> 01:53:40,089
Come. Let's sit.

2017
01:53:40,233 --> 01:53:41,666
Thank you.
- You sit over here.

2018
01:53:42,635 --> 01:53:47,402
Brother, forgive me, this
is our first live telecast.

2019
01:53:48,307 --> 01:53:51,299
But I have said a lot
of things about you two.

2020
01:53:51,644 --> 01:53:53,612
That you and Harman know
each other since childhood.

2021
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:54,771
You are best friends.
- Yes.

2022
01:53:55,047 --> 01:53:57,311
You cannot do
without him. Etcetera.

2023
01:53:57,383 --> 01:53:59,112
Please keep my word,
brother. I mean...

2024
01:53:59,185 --> 01:54:01,085
I... I will tell you
in short, brother.

2025
01:54:02,054 --> 01:54:05,319
The thing is the university
cannot afford you.

2026
01:54:06,058 --> 01:54:08,083
So... But you shouldn't
suffer a loss as well.

2027
01:54:08,227 --> 01:54:10,218
Hence I will pay the
rest of the money.

2028
01:54:10,363 --> 01:54:12,456
We have just a small request.

2029
01:54:12,632 --> 01:54:15,658
No one in the university should
know that I am paying you.

2030
01:54:15,768 --> 01:54:16,530
That's fine.

2031
01:54:16,602 --> 01:54:17,796
But what I don't
understand is, Harman...

2032
01:54:18,070 --> 01:54:20,732
...why are you spending so
much of your own money on me?

2033
01:54:21,307 --> 01:54:24,071
Because, brother, he loves a girl.

2034
01:54:24,277 --> 01:54:26,745
Yes. And she is a big fan of yours.

2035
01:54:27,113 --> 01:54:29,308
She wants you to
perform in the show.

2036
01:54:29,482 --> 01:54:33,282
And I am doing all this
only for her. - Oh.

2037
01:54:33,786 --> 01:54:37,313
It's for love. Then why
didn't you bring her along?

2038
01:54:37,657 --> 01:54:39,454
She drowned because
she couldn't breathe.

2039
01:54:39,559 --> 01:54:42,790
It is a one-sided match. He
is batting and bowling. - Yes.

2040
01:54:43,029 --> 01:54:46,294
Brother, I haven't told
her that I love her.

2041
01:54:46,632 --> 01:54:50,193
And... my feelings
are still in my heart.

2042
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:53,266
Great, man. You are a true lover.

2043
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,702
The girl doesn't even know and
you are doing so much for her.

2044
01:54:57,343 --> 01:54:59,470
Very less people are
made like you by God.

2045
01:55:00,313 --> 01:55:01,541
Don't worry, my friend.

2046
01:55:02,081 --> 01:55:04,049
Sukhbir is always here for love.

2047
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:07,116
I will perform
absolutely free for you.

2048
01:55:07,186 --> 01:55:09,086
No, no, brother.
Money is not a problem.

2049
01:55:09,155 --> 01:55:12,147
No arguments. Free
means absolutely free.

2050
01:55:12,291 --> 01:55:14,316
Brother, I have one
more request to make.

2051
01:55:14,827 --> 01:55:16,818
I am doing the show
for free now. Now what?

2052
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:20,724
Brother, if you bring them
on the stage together...

2053
01:55:21,167 --> 01:55:23,294
- Then see how love spreads.
- Yes.

2054
01:55:24,103 --> 01:55:26,435
Don't worry about
that. I'll do it for you.

2055
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:35,647
So, what about Sukhbir?

2056
01:55:37,783 --> 01:55:39,011
It didn't work out.

2057
01:55:39,418 --> 01:55:41,010
Sukhbir didn't agree.

2058
01:55:42,088 --> 01:55:44,113
I knew it. It won't work out.

2059
01:55:45,057 --> 01:55:46,354
You were lying.

2060
01:55:47,159 --> 01:55:48,717
Sukhbir is a very
good friend of mine.

2061
01:55:48,794 --> 01:55:51,285
He's my personal friend. He
cannot breathe without me.

2062
01:55:51,397 --> 01:55:53,024
He is my best friend. You know.

2063
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:55,226
It is a very simple task for me.

2064
01:55:56,202 --> 01:55:57,533
You were just showing off.

2065
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,228
What is this?

2066
01:56:02,074 --> 01:56:03,200
This is my left hand.

2067
01:56:03,509 --> 01:56:04,703
What should I do with it?

2068
01:56:05,411 --> 01:56:07,675
Thank it. It is bringing Sukhbir.

2069
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,547
Sukhbir agreed.

2070
01:56:10,116 --> 01:56:12,175
Really?
- He is a Punjabi.

2071
01:56:12,251 --> 01:56:14,481
A good friend. He
does what he says.

2072
01:56:14,553 --> 01:56:17,147
Yes, he is coming.
- Love you.

2073
01:56:18,057 --> 01:56:20,719
Oh, my God. Guys, guess
what! Sukhbir is coming.

2074
01:56:20,793 --> 01:56:23,091
Sukhbir is coming.
- Oh wow.

2075
01:56:24,664 --> 01:56:28,794
Look, you got a hug. She
said love you as well.

2076
01:56:29,468 --> 01:56:30,457
Job done.

2077
01:56:32,371 --> 01:56:33,360
No, my friend.

2078
01:56:35,074 --> 01:56:37,099
This hug was for Sukhbir.

2079
01:56:37,743 --> 01:56:39,040
But don't you worry.

2080
01:56:40,279 --> 01:56:42,110
I will get one for myself, soon.

2081
01:56:45,117 --> 01:56:47,585
Oh yes. This is me.
Sukhbir in the house.

2082
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:53,556
Everybody, on your feet. Let
me see you do the Bhangra.

2083
01:57:16,415 --> 01:57:19,407
I forget the world
when I see you walk.

2084
01:57:19,752 --> 01:57:22,482
I forget the world
when I see you walk.

2085
01:57:22,621 --> 01:57:25,590
This is the effect
you have on me.

2086
01:57:26,092 --> 01:57:28,253
This is the effect
you have on me.

2087
01:57:28,427 --> 01:57:31,487
Don't follow fashion.

2088
01:57:31,797 --> 01:57:34,527
Don't follow fashion.

2089
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:37,125
You will ruin someone.

2090
01:57:37,703 --> 01:57:40,638
You will ruin someone.

2091
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,765
You will ruin someone.

2092
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:48,207
You will ruin someone.

2093
01:58:08,768 --> 01:58:12,204
How can I compare
you with anyone?

2094
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:15,672
You are more
beautiful than angels.

2095
01:58:15,741 --> 01:58:19,108
You are more
beautiful than angels.

2096
01:58:19,178 --> 01:58:22,477
You are more
beautiful than angels.

2097
01:58:22,548 --> 01:58:25,676
You smell like roses.

2098
01:58:25,751 --> 01:58:29,278
There can be no one like you.

2099
01:58:29,355 --> 01:58:32,518
There can be no one like you.

2100
01:58:32,591 --> 01:58:36,049
There can be no one like you.

2101
01:58:36,128 --> 01:58:39,097
A lock of hair on your face...

2102
01:58:39,165 --> 01:58:42,157
A lock of hair on your face...

2103
01:58:42,234 --> 01:58:45,169
...makes my heart keep a beat.

2104
01:58:45,404 --> 01:58:48,134
...makes my heart keep a beat.

2105
01:58:48,207 --> 01:58:51,005
Don't follow fashion.

2106
01:58:51,377 --> 01:58:54,005
Don't follow fashion.

2107
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:56,740
You will ruin someone.

2108
01:58:57,349 --> 01:59:00,375
You will ruin someone.

2109
01:59:00,786 --> 01:59:04,051
You will ruin someone.

2110
01:59:04,223 --> 01:59:07,556
You will ruin someone.

2111
01:59:08,661 --> 01:59:10,652
Hey you. What's your name?

2112
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:13,530
Simran?
- Come on, Simran.

2113
01:59:14,033 --> 01:59:16,194
Come and dance with me.
Let me see you rocking.

2114
01:59:16,435 --> 01:59:17,459
Right now.

2115
01:59:30,182 --> 01:59:37,054
The kohl in your eyes,
the shade of your lips...

2116
01:59:37,123 --> 01:59:40,354
The shade of your lips...

2117
01:59:40,426 --> 01:59:43,623
The shade of your lips...

2118
01:59:43,762 --> 01:59:50,361
Your earrings make
me lose my heart.

2119
01:59:50,569 --> 01:59:53,663
Your earrings...

2120
01:59:53,772 --> 01:59:57,299
Your earrings...

2121
01:59:57,409 --> 02:00:00,435
When you walk in style...

2122
02:00:00,679 --> 02:00:03,443
When you walk in style...

2123
02:00:03,549 --> 02:00:06,541
Your each move is worth millions.

2124
02:00:07,019 --> 02:00:09,283
Your each move is worth millions.

2125
02:00:09,421 --> 02:00:12,322
Don't follow fashion.

2126
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:15,526
Don't follow fashion.

2127
02:00:15,594 --> 02:00:18,062
You will ruin someone.

2128
02:00:18,664 --> 02:00:21,633
You will ruin someone.

2129
02:00:22,134 --> 02:00:24,728
You will ruin someone.

2130
02:00:25,371 --> 02:00:28,272
You will ruin someone.

2131
02:00:30,509 --> 02:00:32,500
Hey, brother Harman,
how're you doing?

2132
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:33,769
Come and dance with us.

2133
02:00:34,046 --> 02:00:35,172
Right now.

2134
02:00:49,695 --> 02:00:53,131
What should I say
about your beauty?

2135
02:00:53,265 --> 02:00:56,598
You have mesmerized
the whole world.

2136
02:00:57,269 --> 02:01:00,170
You have mesmerized
the whole world.

2137
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:03,199
You have mesmerized
the whole world.

2138
02:01:03,442 --> 02:01:06,536
All young men want your heart.

2139
02:01:06,679 --> 02:01:10,137
You have stolen everyone's heart.

2140
02:01:10,249 --> 02:01:13,412
You have stolen everyone's heart.

2141
02:01:13,485 --> 02:01:16,750
You have stolen everyone's heart.

2142
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:20,082
Lover boys wait at your doorstep.

2143
02:01:20,326 --> 02:01:23,090
Lover boys wait at your doorstep.

2144
02:01:23,162 --> 02:01:26,063
What will you do about the queue?

2145
02:01:26,498 --> 02:01:29,092
What will you do about the queue?

2146
02:01:29,168 --> 02:01:32,035
Don't follow fashion.

2147
02:01:32,371 --> 02:01:35,204
Don't follow fashion.

2148
02:01:35,274 --> 02:01:37,640
You will ruin someone.

2149
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:41,402
You will ruin someone.

2150
02:01:41,714 --> 02:01:44,706
You will ruin someone.

2151
02:01:45,084 --> 02:01:48,349
You will ruin someone.

2152
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,795
Hey, Harman, I formed
your pair on the stage.

2153
02:02:04,603 --> 02:02:06,503
Now it is your job to
get together for real.

2154
02:02:07,172 --> 02:02:08,070
Thanks, brother.

2155
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:09,801
I can never forget
what you did for me.

2156
02:02:10,075 --> 02:02:11,474
Don't forget to invite
me to your wedding.

2157
02:02:11,543 --> 02:02:12,737
Because I am your best friend.

2158
02:02:12,811 --> 02:02:15,473
Yes. You are also my best
man. God bless you, sir.

2159
02:02:15,547 --> 02:02:16,775
You are my best friend.

2160
02:02:31,630 --> 02:02:33,723
Mother. Mom.

2161
02:02:34,466 --> 02:02:36,491
Mom, dad where are you?

2162
02:02:36,568 --> 02:02:39,059
I think Simran is back.
- Yes.

2163
02:02:40,673 --> 02:02:42,368
Hello, dear.
- Hi, mom.

2164
02:02:42,608 --> 02:02:44,235
Come, my dear. Come.

2165
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:46,205
God bless you.
- How are you?

2166
02:02:47,112 --> 02:02:48,340
I'm fine. You tell me.

2167
02:02:48,414 --> 02:02:51,247
- You look very happy.
- Yes, I am very happy.

2168
02:02:51,517 --> 02:02:55,510
What is it? We should also know
why our daughter is so happy.

2169
02:02:55,587 --> 02:02:57,054
Oh, dad, don't ask.

2170
02:02:57,389 --> 02:02:59,687
Sukhbir's song... He was great.

2171
02:03:00,092 --> 02:03:01,684
And you know he called me on stage.

2172
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,786
And he danced with me. Imagine,
me dancing with Sukhbir.

2173
02:03:05,297 --> 02:03:08,596
Then he called
Harman. Then we had a blast.

2174
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:12,102
You will ruin someone.

2175
02:03:12,271 --> 02:03:13,295
You will...

2176
02:03:13,372 --> 02:03:15,602
Enough. Enough. You sing well.

2177
02:03:16,241 --> 02:03:17,367
Listen.
- Yes?

2178
02:03:17,443 --> 02:03:19,536
You were talking
about someone. Harman.

2179
02:03:19,678 --> 02:03:20,667
Who is Harman?

2180
02:03:20,779 --> 02:03:23,145
My college friend,
papa. He's a good boy.

2181
02:03:23,215 --> 02:03:24,113
I see.

2182
02:03:24,183 --> 02:03:27,414
And you know the star
Sukhbir who charges millions...

2183
02:03:27,586 --> 02:03:30,350
...did a free show
at Harman's request.

2184
02:03:30,622 --> 02:03:32,715
I mean it was only
possible because of Harman.

2185
02:03:32,791 --> 02:03:34,520
He's so... He's amazing.

2186
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:36,389
Completely amazing.
- Really? - Yes.

2187
02:03:36,695 --> 02:03:38,185
You are praising Harman a lot.

2188
02:03:38,764 --> 02:03:40,493
You should introduce him to me.

2189
02:03:41,066 --> 02:03:43,227
Harman did this. Harman did that.

2190
02:03:43,469 --> 02:03:45,562
Even I should know what
is so special about him...

2191
02:03:46,038 --> 02:03:48,199
...that my daughter his
praising him so much.

2192
02:03:48,273 --> 02:03:49,570
Okay. I will introduce him to you.

2193
02:03:49,641 --> 02:03:50,733
Next time when I come from Shimla...

2194
02:03:50,809 --> 02:03:52,401
...I will bring him along with me.

2195
02:03:52,478 --> 02:03:55,038
And I am sure you will
be happy to meet him.

2196
02:03:55,381 --> 02:03:58,077
Okay, dear.
- Okay. Okay. Enough of talking.

2197
02:03:58,150 --> 02:04:00,141
Go and freshen up. I'll get
something for you to eat.

2198
02:04:00,219 --> 02:04:01,208
Okay. Fine.

2199
02:04:03,355 --> 02:04:04,379
You saw?

2200
02:04:04,823 --> 02:04:07,121
Simran took a boy's
name for the first time.

2201
02:04:07,493 --> 02:04:08,482
Yes, dear.

2202
02:04:09,495 --> 02:04:11,725
I too think there is
something is her heart.

2203
02:04:13,098 --> 02:04:14,463
Try talking to her.

2204
02:04:14,767 --> 02:04:16,667
Okay. I will try.

2205
02:04:19,738 --> 02:04:20,727
Simran.
- Hmm!

2206
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:24,232
I know you will choose your
own life partner one day.

2207
02:04:24,843 --> 02:04:29,303
But I don't know why I feel
that you have selected one.

2208
02:04:29,581 --> 02:04:30,809
What are you saying, mom?

2209
02:04:31,116 --> 02:04:34,085
And why would I hide
anything from you?

2210
02:04:34,153 --> 02:04:36,553
I don't understand
how do I tell you.

2211
02:04:37,055 --> 02:04:38,784
I saw it in your eyes.
- What?

2212
02:04:39,391 --> 02:04:40,722
What did you see in my eyes?

2213
02:04:41,427 --> 02:04:43,622
Who is he?
- Who?

2214
02:04:43,695 --> 02:04:44,684
Who?

2215
02:04:44,763 --> 02:04:46,754
The one you are thinking
about and not telling me.

2216
02:04:47,032 --> 02:04:48,522
God. Okay.

2217
02:04:49,435 --> 02:04:52,131
Let's make a deal.
I'll tell you next time.

2218
02:04:52,504 --> 02:04:54,301
Promise.
- Double promise.

2219
02:04:59,545 --> 02:05:01,172
I just return this, and I'll go.

2220
02:05:01,246 --> 02:05:02,235
Okay!

2221
02:05:04,683 --> 02:05:05,547
Hey, Preeti.

2222
02:05:05,617 --> 02:05:06,606
Hi.

2223
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:09,778
Wow! Hot.

2224
02:05:16,495 --> 02:05:18,087
Sorry, baby.

2225
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:19,619
Just chill.

2226
02:05:20,098 --> 02:05:21,087
She's hot, man.

2227
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:22,289
Wow.

2228
02:05:25,771 --> 02:05:28,103
How dare he?

2229
02:05:29,074 --> 02:05:30,769
Misbehave with my Simran.

2230
02:05:32,344 --> 02:05:34,369
Wait you man.

2231
02:05:34,813 --> 02:05:37,577
I'll fix you infront of colleage.

2232
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:40,541
You'll understood.

2233
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:46,557
Why are you letting him beat you?

2234
02:05:46,725 --> 02:05:48,420
Be brave. Be brave. Go for it.

2235
02:06:14,186 --> 02:06:16,711
Come on, Harman. Come on, Harman.

2236
02:06:19,057 --> 02:06:21,082
Soni madam. What do you think?

2237
02:06:21,126 --> 02:06:23,356
Will Harman be able to do
it? Or will I have to interfere?

2238
02:06:23,695 --> 02:06:25,686
Go for it. Go for it.

2239
02:06:29,668 --> 02:06:31,226
Come on, Harman. Come on.

2240
02:06:32,137 --> 02:06:33,502
Teach him a lesson.

2241
02:06:47,686 --> 02:06:49,051
Come on, Harman.

2242
02:06:56,061 --> 02:06:57,392
Buck up, Harman. You can do it.

2243
02:06:57,462 --> 02:06:59,225
I'll kill you. Don't mess with me.

2244
02:06:59,298 --> 02:07:00,492
Come on, Harman.
- You can do it.

2245
02:07:00,566 --> 02:07:01,555
Go.

2246
02:07:02,467 --> 02:07:04,196
Harman. Harman. Harman.

2247
02:07:04,803 --> 02:07:06,065
Well done, Harman.

2248
02:07:09,508 --> 02:07:10,805
Ver good Herman, go.

2249
02:07:26,191 --> 02:07:27,180
Yes!

2250
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:30,392
Here you go. Harman
taught him a lesson.

2251
02:07:30,629 --> 02:07:32,153
Now I will play the drums.

2252
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,324
You pushed her.

2253
02:07:36,635 --> 02:07:39,195
Look, now you
are down-and-out.

2254
02:07:47,245 --> 02:07:49,042
Doesn't matter.

2255
02:08:10,736 --> 02:08:12,203
How are you, Mark?

2256
02:08:12,804 --> 02:08:14,669
You have loads of
flowers in your hand.

2257
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:16,502
Do you want to give
them to someone?

2258
02:08:16,575 --> 02:08:19,339
Of course. I am not
going to cook them.

2259
02:08:19,411 --> 02:08:21,276
Today is Valentine's day.

2260
02:08:21,446 --> 02:08:23,437
Okay. You want to give
them to Soni madam?

2261
02:08:23,682 --> 02:08:25,081
Something like that.

2262
02:08:25,183 --> 02:08:26,616
Come on, you too wear your goggles.

2263
02:08:27,085 --> 02:08:28,143
Here you go.

2264
02:08:28,487 --> 02:08:29,681
Now remove them.

2265
02:08:37,095 --> 02:08:38,392
Sharp eleven.

2266
02:08:39,264 --> 02:08:40,458
Happy Valentine's day.

2267
02:08:41,066 --> 02:08:43,159
Happy Valentine's day to you too.

2268
02:08:43,235 --> 02:08:44,634
Just a minute. I can't see.

2269
02:08:45,437 --> 02:08:48,235
I told you the rest last
night over the phone.

2270
02:08:49,341 --> 02:08:50,330
I am with you.

2271
02:08:50,575 --> 02:08:52,338
Like lifetime incoming?

2272
02:08:54,279 --> 02:08:56,270
Yes. Shall we go for lunch?

2273
02:08:56,348 --> 02:08:58,248
First let us seek Soni
madam's blessings, shall we?

2274
02:08:58,316 --> 02:09:01,285
And pocket money for lunch.
- Okay.

2275
02:09:05,791 --> 02:09:07,486
You have made me happy, son.

2276
02:09:08,026 --> 02:09:09,493
You are crying over pocket money?

2277
02:09:09,661 --> 02:09:12,061
I will fix an ATM
inside your pocket.

2278
02:09:18,136 --> 02:09:19,160
Hello, ma'am.

2279
02:09:19,805 --> 02:09:20,635
Hi, Mark.

2280
02:09:20,706 --> 02:09:23,140
Happy Valentine's day, ma'am.
- Happy Valentine's day.

2281
02:09:23,341 --> 02:09:25,206
What is it? You are
looking very happy today.

2282
02:09:25,277 --> 02:09:26,710
Madam, I proposed to her.

2283
02:09:26,812 --> 02:09:28,609
We will grow up and get married.

2284
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:30,441
Oh. That's good news.

2285
02:09:31,149 --> 02:09:32,514
God bless you, my son.

2286
02:09:32,584 --> 02:09:34,575
May God always keep
both of you happy.

2287
02:09:36,455 --> 02:09:38,355
Here you go. A treat from me.

2288
02:09:38,423 --> 02:09:41,051
Madam, we don't need this. No.
We will accept it as a gift.

2289
02:09:41,159 --> 02:09:43,423
Who knows whether madam will be
able to attend our wedding or not.

2290
02:09:43,695 --> 02:09:45,686
By the way, we don't
think alike. Let's go.

2291
02:09:49,201 --> 02:09:50,190
Hello.

2292
02:09:51,703 --> 02:09:55,332
This is my first Valentine's day.
I don't know how to celebrate it.

2293
02:09:55,474 --> 02:10:00,002
I have never celebrated it. Happy
Valentine's day, Kiran ma'am.

2294
02:10:00,045 --> 02:10:01,672
Mr. Pritam. What is it?

2295
02:10:02,013 --> 02:10:03,640
You didn't address me
as Soni madam today.

2296
02:10:05,183 --> 02:10:06,707
You look very relaxed.

2297
02:10:07,219 --> 02:10:10,586
Yes. I had a burden on
my mind since a long time.

2298
02:10:11,623 --> 02:10:13,022
I got rid of it today.

2299
02:10:13,492 --> 02:10:14,481
Okay. Okay.

2300
02:10:15,026 --> 02:10:18,792
As they say good
that we got estranged.

2301
02:10:19,431 --> 02:10:21,456
Now I don't have to
worry about accepting you.

2302
02:10:22,267 --> 02:10:25,668
You came to know that
my marriage is fixed?

2303
02:10:28,774 --> 02:10:30,105
What is it, Mr. Pritam?

2304
02:10:30,408 --> 02:10:33,377
Why do you look so sad after
hearing the news of my marriage?

2305
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,545
The news is such.

2306
02:10:36,214 --> 02:10:38,978
What did you think?
I would start dancing?

2307
02:10:40,218 --> 02:10:42,379
Anyway, congrats.

2308
02:10:44,156 --> 02:10:45,145
Mr. Pritam...

2309
02:10:47,559 --> 02:10:50,289
I was just testing
you. All these days.

2310
02:10:50,729 --> 02:10:52,219
I'm not a fool.

2311
02:10:52,697 --> 02:10:54,494
I won't leave such
a handsome beloved...

2312
02:10:54,566 --> 02:10:56,090
...and go after someone else.

2313
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:02,097
What's back there?

2314
02:11:03,041 --> 02:11:04,030
Thank you.

2315
02:11:05,310 --> 02:11:07,073
Thank you very much, Soni ma'am.

2316
02:11:07,179 --> 02:11:08,544
You made my day.

2317
02:11:08,613 --> 02:11:10,171
You made my life.

2318
02:11:11,116 --> 02:11:12,743
Today... today is Valentine's day.

2319
02:11:13,051 --> 02:11:14,541
Okay. It's not written anywhere...

2320
02:11:14,619 --> 02:11:17,144
...that people can't
get married on this day.

2321
02:11:17,289 --> 02:11:18,756
Before there is any other delay...

2322
02:11:19,024 --> 02:11:20,548
...let's go and get
married right away.

2323
02:11:21,526 --> 02:11:25,018
- Ma'am, she left me.
- What happened, Mark?

2324
02:11:25,063 --> 02:11:26,621
I had said that we
don't think alike.

2325
02:11:27,032 --> 02:11:29,262
When we went outside she said
that our heights don't match.

2326
02:11:29,401 --> 02:11:31,392
I said so what if I am
short? I have a big heart.

2327
02:11:31,469 --> 02:11:33,699
She said what will she
do with my big heart.

2328
02:11:34,739 --> 02:11:36,707
Here, take her share of money back.

2329
02:11:37,042 --> 02:11:39,237
Girls nowadays don't
have any sense, ma'am.

2330
02:11:39,377 --> 02:11:41,811
You treat me so well.

2331
02:11:44,549 --> 02:11:46,380
Don't worry, Mark. Don't lose hope.

2332
02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:49,150
We will go home and
find a solution to this.

2333
02:11:50,055 --> 02:11:52,421
Mr. Pritam. He is emotional.

2334
02:11:53,291 --> 02:11:55,657
I'll go home. See you later.

2335
02:11:56,528 --> 02:11:59,292
I'll go and treat him. He needs me.

2336
02:11:59,364 --> 02:12:01,229
Happy Valentine's day, sir.

2337
02:12:01,399 --> 02:12:03,264
Happy Valentine's day.

2338
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:08,198
I will have to find a
permanent treatment for him.

2339
02:12:08,473 --> 02:12:10,737
He might come with her as a
package after we get married.

2340
02:12:17,816 --> 02:12:19,078
God, please help me.

2341
02:12:27,792 --> 02:12:28,781
Simran.

2342
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:29,792
Hi.

2343
02:12:29,861 --> 02:12:31,294
Could you please...

2344
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:33,755
I want to talk to you.
- Yes. Sure.

2345
02:12:34,099 --> 02:12:35,589
Go ahead. I'll just come. Okay?
- Okay.

2346
02:12:35,667 --> 02:12:36,599
All the best.

2347
02:12:38,136 --> 02:12:39,330
Hi, Harman.
- Hi.

2348
02:12:39,704 --> 02:12:41,296
How are you?
- I'm good.

2349
02:12:42,173 --> 02:12:43,162
Today...

2350
02:12:43,575 --> 02:12:47,102
The atmosphere of the university
is so romantic today. - Yes.

2351
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:49,372
Everyone is finding love.

2352
02:12:50,248 --> 02:12:54,548
They are eager to express their
feelings to the ones they love.

2353
02:12:54,686 --> 02:12:56,654
Yes. Why shouldn't they?

2354
02:12:57,289 --> 02:12:59,086
This day is dedicated to lovers.

2355
02:12:59,324 --> 02:13:03,488
All lovers eagerly wait
for Valentine's day.

2356
02:13:03,728 --> 02:13:05,696
So that they can express
their love. Right?

2357
02:13:06,064 --> 02:13:07,088
You are right.

2358
02:13:07,565 --> 02:13:11,797
Actually, Valentine's day
is one of the best in life...

2359
02:13:12,237 --> 02:13:13,670
...for anyone who is in love.

2360
02:13:14,339 --> 02:13:17,399
This is the day when
people openly express...

2361
02:13:18,343 --> 02:13:20,573
...their feelings to
the one they love.

2362
02:13:21,613 --> 02:13:25,481
And I too... I too don't
want to miss the opportunity.

2363
02:13:26,685 --> 02:13:31,622
Today I will express my
feelings to the one I love.

2364
02:13:32,557 --> 02:13:34,354
Yes, Harman. You should.

2365
02:13:34,693 --> 02:13:36,092
That is so romantic.

2366
02:13:36,695 --> 02:13:40,222
I remember you had told me
that you love someone a lot.

2367
02:13:40,632 --> 02:13:43,123
And you had promised me that
you will introduce her to me.

2368
02:13:43,234 --> 02:13:44,223
Remember?

2369
02:13:46,204 --> 02:13:48,798
Yes. I surely will, Simran.

2370
02:13:49,341 --> 02:13:50,774
Today. Right away.

2371
02:13:52,177 --> 02:13:53,644
- Just a second.
- Okay.

2372
02:14:04,155 --> 02:14:06,817
Okay. But where's she?

2373
02:14:08,193 --> 02:14:09,353
My love...

2374
02:14:10,829 --> 02:14:13,229
The one I hid in
my heart for years...

2375
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:16,389
That person...

2376
02:14:18,436 --> 02:14:19,425
Is you, Simran.

2377
02:14:20,538 --> 02:14:21,527
What?

2378
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,205
Happy Valentine's day.

2379
02:14:25,210 --> 02:14:27,371
You are joking, right?

2380
02:14:28,713 --> 02:14:30,704
I have dedicated my
life to you, Simran.

2381
02:14:32,083 --> 02:14:33,607
How can I joke with you?

2382
02:14:35,453 --> 02:14:36,750
I am telling the truth, Simran.

2383
02:14:38,056 --> 02:14:40,490
I can never forget the day
I saw you for the first time.

2384
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:46,060
From the time I have seen you...

2385
02:14:46,765 --> 02:14:52,032
...my love for you
has never diminished.

2386
02:14:53,638 --> 02:14:55,663
I really love you, Simran.
- No, Harman.

2387
02:14:57,208 --> 02:14:58,402
This is not possible.

2388
02:14:59,511 --> 02:15:01,206
Stop. Please.

2389
02:15:02,347 --> 02:15:03,439
But why, Simran?

2390
02:15:04,482 --> 02:15:05,471
I... l...

2391
02:15:07,285 --> 02:15:09,776
Did I say something wrong, Simran?

2392
02:15:10,688 --> 02:15:13,088
Look, please, please
don't misunderstand me.

2393
02:15:13,258 --> 02:15:14,520
Please don't misunderstand me.

2394
02:15:14,626 --> 02:15:16,287
Simran, I really love you a lot.

2395
02:15:18,830 --> 02:15:19,819
Is there...

2396
02:15:20,231 --> 02:15:21,391
Is something wrong with me?

2397
02:15:21,466 --> 02:15:22,455
Tell me.

2398
02:15:23,435 --> 02:15:24,800
There is nothing wrong with you.

2399
02:15:25,804 --> 02:15:28,364
Harman, you are a
good friend of mine.

2400
02:15:29,407 --> 02:15:30,635
A very good human being.

2401
02:15:32,143 --> 02:15:35,408
Harman, you can be
any girl's dream.

2402
02:15:36,648 --> 02:15:39,549
Any girl will be lucky
to have you in her life.

2403
02:15:44,055 --> 02:15:45,386
But I am not that lucky girl.

2404
02:15:47,425 --> 02:15:52,124
My love, my life is Aman.

2405
02:15:53,331 --> 02:15:55,265
I love him a lot.

2406
02:16:00,038 --> 02:16:01,096
Forgive me.

2407
02:16:02,607 --> 02:16:04,666
I am... l'm really very sorry.

2408
02:16:12,717 --> 02:16:14,685
No. No. No.

2409
02:16:15,086 --> 02:16:17,350
Simran, you don't know, I...

2410
02:16:18,756 --> 02:16:21,748
I have sacrificed
a lot for this love.

2411
02:16:22,527 --> 02:16:24,051
Sacrifice?
- Yes, Simran.

2412
02:16:24,262 --> 02:16:28,631
To keep away from the one you
love so much for two years.

2413
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:30,258
What is it if not a sacrifice?

2414
02:16:30,535 --> 02:16:32,435
And I kept away from
you for two years...

2415
02:16:32,504 --> 02:16:34,802
...only so that I become
capable enough for you.

2416
02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:37,265
So that I can give you all
the happiness in the world.

2417
02:16:37,442 --> 02:16:40,172
But in spite of staying
away from you for two years...

2418
02:16:40,645 --> 02:16:44,046
...I never stopped
loving you, Simran.

2419
02:16:45,183 --> 02:16:49,415
I... I got admitted to
this university... for you.

2420
02:16:52,157 --> 02:16:53,749
Simran, from the
time I have seen you...

2421
02:16:54,492 --> 02:16:58,053
...each breath I took,
each beat of my heart...

2422
02:16:58,563 --> 02:17:03,125
...each dream I had was
incomplete without your name.

2423
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:10,131
You are the first and the
last desire of my life, Simran.

2424
02:17:11,309 --> 02:17:12,333
I love you a lot.

2425
02:17:13,478 --> 02:17:15,070
And I love Aman a lot.

2426
02:17:15,747 --> 02:17:17,510
He is my first and only love.

2427
02:17:19,083 --> 02:17:20,107
Forgive me, Harman.

2428
02:17:21,119 --> 02:17:22,450
Don't say that, Simran.

2429
02:17:23,521 --> 02:17:24,613
I'll die without you.

2430
02:17:25,690 --> 02:17:27,624
And I will die without Aman.

2431
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:34,589
Now what will I do in
life without you, Simran?

2432
02:17:36,234 --> 02:17:38,361
You are my life.

2433
02:17:39,637 --> 02:17:41,605
And Aman is my life.

2434
02:17:42,273 --> 02:17:44,764
He is my life and my love.

2435
02:17:47,779 --> 02:17:53,217
If unknowingly I have broken
your heart then forgive me.

2436
02:17:54,686 --> 02:18:02,684
There should never be a moment...

2437
02:18:04,195 --> 02:18:11,431
...when you are away from me.

2438
02:18:14,172 --> 02:18:21,442
Neither my heart, nor my breath...

2439
02:18:22,380 --> 02:18:29,650
Support me at that moment.

2440
02:18:31,823 --> 02:18:38,490
You dwell in my breath.

2441
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:48,134
You are my life.

2442
02:18:50,708 --> 02:18:57,011
Without you my life...

2443
02:18:58,683 --> 02:19:06,146
My life is meaningless.

2444
02:19:09,327 --> 02:19:13,354
Beautiful...

2445
02:19:15,099 --> 02:19:18,762
Damsel...

2446
02:19:21,072 --> 02:19:24,530
Beautiful...

2447
02:19:25,643 --> 02:19:29,101
Damsel...

2448
02:19:30,815 --> 02:19:33,340
Damsel...

2449
02:20:02,547 --> 02:20:03,536
Harman.

2450
02:20:05,183 --> 02:20:06,275
What happened, son?

2451
02:20:10,321 --> 02:20:15,384
Your God... cannot
see me happy, priest.

2452
02:20:19,364 --> 02:20:21,332
Today, He snatched my
love as well from me.

2453
02:20:24,435 --> 02:20:25,732
What happened to Simran?

2454
02:20:35,446 --> 02:20:36,378
Priest...

2455
02:20:39,016 --> 02:20:42,577
Simran... loves someone else.

2456
02:20:45,723 --> 02:20:47,281
Tell me something.

2457
02:20:48,393 --> 02:20:49,724
Where did I go wrong?

2458
02:20:50,495 --> 02:20:53,487
Why is your God my enemy?

2459
02:20:54,532 --> 02:20:58,662
Whenever I tried to seek
happiness in something...

2460
02:20:59,203 --> 02:21:00,693
...He takes it away from me.

2461
02:21:02,106 --> 02:21:07,203
I worked hard so that I can
make my poor parents happy.

2462
02:21:08,613 --> 02:21:12,777
He... took my parents
away from me before time.

2463
02:21:14,118 --> 02:21:16,678
Simran, the one I love
more than my life...

2464
02:21:19,357 --> 02:21:20,756
She loves someone else.

2465
02:21:21,592 --> 02:21:24,584
He should tell me what
have I done wrong...

2466
02:21:24,662 --> 02:21:26,721
...for which He is so angry with me.

2467
02:21:28,299 --> 02:21:29,288
Harman...

2468
02:21:31,402 --> 02:21:33,597
God is never angry with anyone.

2469
02:21:35,206 --> 02:21:36,503
Have faith in Him.

2470
02:21:37,308 --> 02:21:38,639
Everything will be fine.

2471
02:21:41,078 --> 02:21:42,636
He looks after everyone.

2472
02:21:43,714 --> 02:21:45,306
He gives everyone.

2473
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:48,041
Only He knows His will.

2474
02:21:49,353 --> 02:21:51,253
Just trust in Him.

2475
02:21:51,422 --> 02:21:54,186
No, priest. I have
lost faith in your God.

2476
02:21:55,359 --> 02:22:00,058
If He has decided that He will
never let me be happy in this world...

2477
02:22:01,299 --> 02:22:03,267
...then I too won't
let that come true.

2478
02:22:04,202 --> 02:22:05,669
I don't want to stay in this world.

2479
02:22:07,605 --> 02:22:09,129
I will leave this world.

2480
02:22:10,074 --> 02:22:13,134
I never got anything other
than sadness and rejection here.

2481
02:22:14,111 --> 02:22:15,237
I want to die, priest.

2482
02:22:15,513 --> 02:22:16,741
I want to die.

2483
02:22:17,248 --> 02:22:18,442
You are right, Harman.

2484
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:22,378
You have no right to live.

2485
02:22:26,157 --> 02:22:29,149
A person who cannot
accept God's will...

2486
02:22:32,263 --> 02:22:33,855
...has no right to live.

2487
02:22:34,699 --> 02:22:36,564
He has no right to live.

2488
02:22:38,703 --> 02:22:40,034
What do you think?

2489
02:22:40,505 --> 02:22:42,439
Are you the only one sad?

2490
02:22:43,708 --> 02:22:45,676
You are the only one who
lost everything in life?

2491
02:22:47,345 --> 02:22:48,334
Look at me.

2492
02:22:50,314 --> 02:22:53,215
I have carried my son's bier.

2493
02:22:54,752 --> 02:22:59,155
I have seen my wife
dying in that sorrow.

2494
02:23:01,225 --> 02:23:02,817
I have carried her bier as well.

2495
02:23:04,562 --> 02:23:07,360
And now... now I am a heart patient.

2496
02:23:08,799 --> 02:23:10,426
I don' know how long I will live.

2497
02:23:10,601 --> 02:23:12,694
Have I ever shared
my sorrows with you?

2498
02:23:13,638 --> 02:23:14,832
No, right?

2499
02:23:16,707 --> 02:23:19,767
I have accepted God's will.

2500
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:24,177
Your actions seem so sweet to me.

2501
02:23:25,082 --> 02:23:27,277
Nanak begs for the treasure
of the Name of the Lord.

2502
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:29,411
Our Guru has said...

2503
02:23:30,087 --> 02:23:33,818
While laughing, playing, dressing
and eating, he is liberated.

2504
02:23:34,825 --> 02:23:40,127
One should spend his
life in a positive manner.

2505
02:23:41,465 --> 02:23:45,299
No matter what happens,
life never stops, son.

2506
02:23:46,537 --> 02:23:48,266
Life keeps on going.

2507
02:23:51,075 --> 02:23:54,374
There is work to be
done till you are alive.

2508
02:23:55,513 --> 02:23:57,606
And one should live
till he has work.

2509
02:23:59,517 --> 02:24:01,280
You should start afresh in life.

2510
02:24:03,087 --> 02:24:04,520
You will find a new ray of hope.

2511
02:24:05,389 --> 02:24:06,720
A new dawn.

2512
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:11,628
It will give your
life a new meaning.

2513
02:24:12,730 --> 02:24:14,755
And it will fill your
life with happiness.

2514
02:24:15,733 --> 02:24:16,722
Yes.

2515
02:24:20,571 --> 02:24:21,560
Come.

2516
02:24:24,275 --> 02:24:26,334
'No darkness is end of life.'

2517
02:24:27,078 --> 02:24:28,477
'Lt is a sign of a new dawn.'

2518
02:24:29,113 --> 02:24:31,104
'Learn to accept His will.'

2519
02:24:31,282 --> 02:24:32,772
'Where do you stand before him? '

2520
02:24:35,353 --> 02:24:37,048
'Only He knows what He does.'

2521
02:24:37,321 --> 02:24:39,482
'We don't know what pleases Him.'
