1
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,409
Where are you taking the bulls?

2
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,545
Tie them back.

3
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,259
Now you won't get these bulls back.

4
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,258
Forget about the principle amount.

5
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,493
For the past two months, you
haven't even paid the interest.

6
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,095
Have mercy on me, Lala!

7
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,029
If you take away my bulls.

8
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,930
Then how will I plough my fields?

9
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,608
I am ready to help you.

10
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,876
But you don't listen to me.

11
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:05,549
If you say yes, I will
cover you in gold.

12
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:06,943
Lala!

13
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,151
What are you looking at?

14
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,883
Take the bulls away.
- Wait Lala.

15
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,189
What is the amount with the
principle and interest?

16
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:19,230
Why? Do you want to
be her sympathiser?

17
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,461
Your mind is so corrupt, Lala.

18
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,565
But I feel pity for you.

19
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,835
Because you are an impious man!

20
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,068
Open the accounts book,
and tell me the total.

21
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:42,019
2000 is the principle, and the
interest is separate. - 2000!

22
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,922
Fine, cut is off in
your accounts book.

23
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,455
And ask your men to
tie the bulls back.

24
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,254
It is 1.23 karats. And the price
of the stone is separate.

25
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,524
No, no!

26
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,462
No sir, I will never
let you give this.

27
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,802
Gopal, you shouldn't be so loyal.

28
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,472
That you don't feel pity on
your helpless sister too.

29
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,869
Give Lala the ring.

30
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,113
Give it, listen to your elders.

31
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,140
Give it.

32
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,884
Tie the bulls back.

33
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:23,891
Sir, you..
- Don't say anything, Tulsi.

34
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,228
There are very few people
that can help others.

35
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,436
He has blessed me with his grace.

36
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,106
All the women of the
village adore you.

37
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,106
I have done this favour to myself.

38
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,503
Sir.
- Yes.

39
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,453
Daddy!

40
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,323
Daddy, look.

41
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,197
Only my kite is flying
in the entire village.

42
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,805
All the other children that were
flying their kite, I told them..

43
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,865
..if you dare cut my kite,
I will kill you.

44
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,303
The fools took their kites back.

45
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,077
Everyone is so afraid
of us in this village!

46
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,882
But son, there is a man in this
village who is not afraid of us.

47
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,879
You are talking about
that Thakur, isn't it?

48
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,024
Yes, I am talking about him.

49
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,560
Why do you worry so much?

50
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,831
Remember, last year when he
repaid Hari Ram's loan..

51
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,231
..and prevented us from
snatching his field.

52
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,359
What you had said?

53
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,562
What had I said?

54
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:44,474
You had said, don't worry son
everyone meets his match.

55
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:49,575
But God knows when he
will meet his match.

56
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,242
Mother.

57
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,247
Mother.
- What happened, Gopal?

58
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,380
Father gave his ring to Lala
to repay Tulsi's loan

59
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,427
So what, Tulsi is your sister!

60
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,859
So what if she is my sister?

61
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,090
That doesn't mean father will
give away everything.

62
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,856
The entire world thinks
about themselves!

63
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,867
But he thinks about others.

64
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,533
I feel like teaching father
such a lesson one day.

65
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,533
That he forgets giving donations.

66
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,507
Gopal, what are you saying?

67
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,173
Nothing, he was praising you.

68
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:22,112
The Lord has given you so much,
that it seems endless.

69
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,814
Lie! Absolute lie!

70
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,282
I was not praising you!

71
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,875
I was criticizing you.

72
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,547
If you don't care about yourselves,
that's fine.

73
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,550
But think about brother Jeevan.

74
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,088
Whatever is left, leave
it for your son.

75
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,823
Gopal, elders have said
there is no need..

76
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,263
..to leave anything for your son.

77
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,324
If he is competent, he
will attain everything.

78
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,099
And if he is incompetent, then
he will ruin everything.

79
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,466
And then, your brother Jeevan
is such a competent son.

80
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,967
If he is born in the enemies house.

81
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,511
There won't be any enmity
left in the world.

82
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,546
He is good, that's why you
don't care about him.

83
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,107
But let him return.

84
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,080
As soon as he returns
as a police officer.

85
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,519
I will have you both arrested
for donations.

86
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,249
Leave me!

87
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,384
I say, leave me!

88
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,957
Congratulations my boy,
congratulations!

89
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,083
Thank you, sir.

90
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,328
Where do you live, son?
- Rajpura, sir.

91
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,832
Wow! I should have understood..

92
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,301
..only someone from Rajpura
can perform such a feat.

93
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,428
Very good.

94
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,562
Sir, are you from Rajpura too.

95
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,506
That was quite clever, young man.

96
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,502
This is my daughter, Ninu!
- Nalini!

97
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,140
Sorry, Nalini!
- Hello.

98
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,246
Did you tell him he is having
dinner with us tomorrow?

99
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,213
Sir.. that..

100
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,117
I will be very happy ifyou
will have dinner with us!

101
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,912
Yes sir, thank you.

102
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,285
Okay bye, all the best.

103
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,230
Come in sir. Our sir
is about to arrive.

104
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,789
He just called.

105
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,925
What will you have?

106
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,127
Something hot or cold.

107
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,064
Nothing, thank you.

108
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,230
How is that possible?

109
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,365
You have come in our house
for the first time.

110
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,874
You will have to take something.

111
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,503
I will bring cold water for you.
- Okay.

112
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,554
Sir, what are you doing up there?

113
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,887
I will tell you, first get
that dog out of here.

114
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,464
No sir, he is a dog.

115
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,530
This is a foreign dog.

116
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,566
Whatever it is, get him out of here.

117
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,905
I will take him along.

118
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,571
Yes, I remembered.

119
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,142
Nalini madam has called
you upstairs.

120
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,476
In her room.

121
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,448
Come on mister.

122
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,252
Ms. Nalini, you..
- Jeevan come here.

123
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:08,050
Tell me, in which of these dresses
will I look beautiful.

124
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,486
I look beautiful anyway.

125
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,362
But we should know each
other's choices.

126
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,900
Because we have to spend
all our life together.

127
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,226
What?

128
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,895
There is no need to be surprised.

129
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,565
I have decided that
I will marry you.

130
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,838
Actually the thing is,
my daddy is educated..

131
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,571
..but he is a bit orthodox.

132
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,311
Papa wanted me to marry the
son of his village friend.

133
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,576
But I explained him.

134
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,250
Daddy, all this seems good in
films, but not in real life.

135
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:39,481
Somehow I appeased him, but then
he kept another condition.

136
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,224
Dear, you will have to marry
a police inspector.

137
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,126
Or else you won't
get married at all.

138
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,592
Forgive me, I cannot remain
unmarried all my life.

139
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,460
Then I saw you.

140
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,596
I thought good girls should
listen to their daddy.

141
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,143
So I thought I will spend my life
with Jeevan, I mean with you.

142
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,244
Yes, so which dress should I wear?

143
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,472
Don't wear any of these dresses.

144
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,878
Actually.. the one you are wearing,
take that off too.

145
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,948
You rascal!

146
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,358
Sorry, I am late.

147
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,560
Actually, there was an urgent file.
Come.

148
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,428
Come on boy.

149
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,567
So Jeevan, when did you arrive?

150
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,839
About a 1/2-1 hour ago.

151
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:32,969
Hi dad.
- Hi darling.

152
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,103
Hi Jeevan.

153
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,841
It has been so long since
Jeevan arrived..

154
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,382
..and you haven't served
him anything.

155
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,385
She took care of me so well, that..

156
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,590
Jeevan sir, what were you saying?

157
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,918
That, how could you have
taken care of me.

158
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,021
You didn't even know I have arrived.

159
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,260
Excuse me sir.
- Excuse me.

160
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:57,994
Yes, what is it?

161
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,867
I have brought the enlargement
you asked for.

162
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,997
Thank you.

163
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,071
Daddy whose photograph is this?

164
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,403
Dacoit Jagir Singh!

165
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,809
He is the only dacoit remaining..

166
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,943
..that hasn't been apprehended
by the police.

167
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,498
Dacoit Jagir Singh!

168
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,913
Give me the keys to the safe.

169
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,191
Durjan!

170
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,528
Take everything from the safe.

171
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,866
Jagir Singh doesn't want a stranger
man touching your wife!

172
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,977
Ask your wife to handover all
her jewellery to Lakhan.

173
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,039
But, leave the Mangalsutra!

174
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,353
That too.

175
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,262
No, no don't take that.

176
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,164
It's for the long life of the child.

177
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,229
I don't care whether the child
lives or dies. - No! - Lakhan!

178
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,966
Leave the talisman!

179
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,905
But chief..
- I said, leave the talisman!

180
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,312
Jagir Singh, you have
been surrounded!

181
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,184
Surrender yourself!

182
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,015
Chief!
- I am fine, you hold them off!

183
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,285
But chief!
- Hold them off!

184
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,178
Who are you?

185
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,081
Jagir Singh!
- Dacoit Jagir Singh.

186
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,916
Why have you come here?

187
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,919
I have come in your shelter.

188
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,989
The police are after me.

189
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:17,131
Please hide me today, I will
forever be indebted to you!

190
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,328
Go away from here!

191
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,005
There is no place for
dacoits in my house!

192
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,536
I am a dacoit, but I am
not such a bad person.

193
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,008
On humanitarian grounds, please
give me shelter today.

194
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,875
Only for today.

195
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,948
Listen!

196
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,018
Till today you haven't
sent anyone back.

197
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,219
Please agree.

198
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,388
Maybe it is the Lord's will.

199
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,270
Greetings.
- Greetings.

200
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,103
Thakur sir, dacoit Jagir Singh
has come somewhere here.

201
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,010
Really. - And I am sure, he
should be around. - Here.

202
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,844
If you allow me, then can
I take a look around?

203
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,344
Yes surely, come.

204
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,941
Thank you! Thank you very much.

205
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,136
Inspector sir, you.

206
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,271
Why have you come here?

207
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,315
Madam, I am sorry!

208
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,254
Thakur sir, I am sorry for
the trouble I caused.

209
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,450
It was no trouble.

210
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,883
Good bye.

211
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,963
Thakur sir, both of
you saved my life.

212
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,173
I will forever remain
indebted to you.

213
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,774
I will pray to the Lord..

214
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,976
..that he gives me a chance
to repay this debt.

215
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,847
If you ever need me, then there
is a Kali temple on the mountain.

216
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,326
Come there and ring the bell
thrice, and I will come.

217
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,210
Hi!

218
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,418
Hello, where are you going
handsome? - To hell.

219
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,559
That's a very nice place, sit.
I will take you there.

220
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,397
Thank you, I a, used to running.

221
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,375
You argue a lot.

222
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,844
When I am asking you to sit,
then why don't you sit!

223
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,470
What if I don't sit?

224
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,239
That's no possible!

225
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,407
Then let's place a bet.

226
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,541
For how much?

227
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,319
Condition is that you will
never try to meet me again.

228
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,255
That's for you, and what
if I win the bet?

229
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,088
Then I will never argue
with you again.

230
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,921
I am a girl from a respected family.

231
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:36,133
In the middle of the road
I ask you to take a seat.

232
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,601
And you are insulting me!

233
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,198
What is the matter girl?

234
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,136
This boy is flirting with me.

235
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,509
You scoundrel, you dare
flirt with the girl!

236
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,205
Aren't you ashamed of
flirting with the girl?

237
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,214
You scoundrel, don't
you have any shame?

238
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,948
Are you drunk early in the morning?

239
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,484
Aren't you ashamed?

240
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,053
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

241
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,184
Beat him up!

242
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,092
Brothers, why are you hitting
me, that girl was joking.

243
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,961
Come on!

244
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,912
Okay fine, you win I lose.

245
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:38,987
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

246
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:45,261
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

247
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,396
After one child, not so soon.

248
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,940
After the second on, not at all.

249
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,600
After one child, not so soon.

250
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,877
After the second on, not at all.

251
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:59,081
Let us take an oath.

252
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,947
Sing!

253
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:11,087
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

254
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,892
After one child, not so soon.

255
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,296
After the second on, not at all.

256
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,232
After one child, not so soon.

257
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,429
After the second on, not at all.

258
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,907
Let us take an oath.

259
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:29,572
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

260
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:36,844
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

261
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,880
I am here right now.

262
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,810
God knows where I might be next.

263
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:11,447
I don't dwell in one place.

264
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,553
I am here right now.

265
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,954
God knows where I might be next.

266
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,126
I don't dwell in one place.

267
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:27,228
Wherever you are, you always
dwell in my heart.

268
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,342
The rest is just your excuse.

269
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,346
The kin are there so is the
beloved, let's get married.

270
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,472
Come on!

271
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:41,850
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

272
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:48,922
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

273
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:14,278
I will do as you will tell me to.

274
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,879
I am destined to slavery.

275
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:27,063
I will do as you will tell me to.

276
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:31,359
I am destined to slavery.

277
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,896
As you sow, you will reap merits.

278
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,977
You are destined for this.

279
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,909
The dice is there so is the
priest, let's get married.

280
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,040
Come on!

281
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:50,452
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

282
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:56,518
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

283
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,862
After one child, not so soon.

284
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,989
After the second on, not at all.

285
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,000
After one child, not so soon.

286
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,263
After the second on, not at all.

287
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,865
Let us take an oath.

288
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:15,971
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

289
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:22,543
Today, let us take the
oath of the night.

290
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,036
What? The workers refused to work!

291
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,371
We will not work in your fields!

292
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:53,042
What's wrong with our fields
that you don't want to work!

293
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,448
Not the fields, you are wrong.

294
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,851
You scoundrel!

295
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,287
Wait son, wait.

296
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,847
There is enough time to flog them!

297
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,989
But first let me ask
them the real matter.

298
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,863
Okay I agree I am a wrong person.

299
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,797
But there must be a reason,
because of which..

300
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,533
..you realised this today.

301
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:16,865
There is a reason.

302
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,066
Our payment.

303
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,805
The government has made a rule..

304
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,813
..that we should get atleast
6 rupees everyday.

305
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,075
And you give only 2 rupees.

306
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,815
If you don't increase our salary..

307
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,375
..then we won't work in your fields.

308
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,511
We won't!

309
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,894
So, is this your decision too?

310
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,967
Why don't you?

311
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,011
What has happened to all of you?

312
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,310
Nothing is wrong with them.

313
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,407
But something is surely
wrong with you.

314
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,450
Slowly son, slowly.

315
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,123
You will really skin him alive.

316
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:15,531
First ask who provoked has him!

317
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,534
You scoundrel, what is daddy asking!

318
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,799
Who provoked you?

319
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,432
Tell me!

320
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,472
Thakur Ganga Prasad had
said this to his workers.

321
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,179
Daddy, I will go and deal
with that scoundrel.

322
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:38,880
He is giving us a bad name to
create a good image for him!

323
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,083
Go son, go.

324
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,956
Go and defame him as
much as you want!

325
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,495
I will deal with him later.

326
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,224
I will say, he is just a child,
he made a mistake.

327
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,891
What are you looking at?

328
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,836
Go and work in the fields, go on!

329
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,901
Except for Ramlakhan.

330
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,007
Such a pious name and
such impious act.

331
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,166
Come on!

332
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,773
Look Thakur sir, I have come
to clearly tell you that..

333
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:11,117
..if you don't think you are
a rich man, then so be it.

334
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,790
But atleast don't provoke
these poor people so much..

335
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,849
..that they forget their position.

336
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,794
When did I provoke you so much..

337
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,262
..that you have forgotten
your position.

338
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,389
Meaning!

339
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,801
I mean, if you don't have
manners to talk..

340
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,531
..to your elders, Rajesh
then you shouldn't talk!

341
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,931
Do hell with manners!

342
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,804
Because of you, these
down trodden people..

343
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,870
..have started talking
in front of us.

344
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,810
I am speaking in front of
you, that's because..

345
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,320
..if you didn't change your ways.

346
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,248
Then I will have to
change my behaviour.

347
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,261
Look Rajesh, you are
of my son's age.

348
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,824
If my son would have behaved
like this with someone.

349
00:28:53,898 --> 00:29:00,497
Then I would beat him up!

350
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,166
Now before I forget the difference
that you are not my son.

351
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,169
Get out of here.

352
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,503
I am going!

353
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,976
But remember, the consequences
won't be good!

354
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,183
Really!

355
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,317
'The girl is very beautiful mother.'

356
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,519
More than you?

357
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,092
'Mother, if you see her
you will be astonished.'

358
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,191
'And I am sure, you will
surely like here.'

359
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:33,531
Can your mother ever
refuse your choice?

360
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,005
'And you will commemorate
my choice.'

361
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,473
'Mother, the girl is
from our village.'

362
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,868
'Do you know who?'

363
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,002
Who?

364
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,877
'The one you had fixed my marriage
with in my childhood.'

365
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,977
'Mother, just smiling won't do!'

366
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,220
'Quickly pick up a pen and paper,
and tell me your decision.'

367
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,484
'So that I can tell your
decision to my Nalini.'

368
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,224
Whose letter is it?

369
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,420
Whose letter is it?

370
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,895
Jeevan's
- Okay.

371
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,195
He has selected a girl in the city.
- What?

372
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,164
There is no need to be afraid.

373
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,034
She is same girl we had chosen
for him in his childhood.

374
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,898
Oh wow, that's great.
- It is.

375
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,409
Here. Show me.

376
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,246
But I had written everything to
mother. - What had you written?

377
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:23,411
That the girl has two eyes, two
ears, dense black tresses.

378
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,382
Two hands and a heart that
loves me very much.

379
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,594
Now neither can I leave
her nor can she leave me.

380
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,594
Then why did mother refuse?

381
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,258
It's her will.

382
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,933
Maybe she didn't like you.

383
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,870
It is my fault.

384
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,071
Unnecessarily I wrote
about your height too.

385
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,938
Did she find my height inadequate?

386
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,345
I can take care of that by making
you wear a 6 inch sandal!

387
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,615
I am ready to adjust you in
any way, but my mother.

388
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,410
Mother won't.

389
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,350
When I told mother my choice.

390
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,084
Mother sent me the photo of
the girl she has chosen.

391
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,556
Now there is you and
this photograph.

392
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,027
Atleast see mother's choice.

393
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,167
The photograph is
beautiful like you.

394
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:25,907
Did you like her?

395
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:42,996
Everyday in my eyes..

396
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:48,304
Everyday in my eyes..

397
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:06,988
Everyday in my eyes, there
is only one dream.

398
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:12,420
The kohl in the eyes gets smeared.

399
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:19,129
Because of the restless dream.

400
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:31,048
Everyday in my eyes, there
is only one dream.

401
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:36,015
The kohl in the eyes gets smeared.

402
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:43,053
Because of the restless dream.

403
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,866
Everyday in my eyes..

404
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:25,299
Since I have taken your
sweet name from my lips.

405
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:36,074
The sorrows are sweet and
so is the loneliness.

406
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:52,089
Since I have taken your
sweet name from my lips.

407
00:33:53,197 --> 00:34:02,868
The sorrows are sweet and
so is the loneliness.

408
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:13,409
Everyday in my eyes, there
is only one dream.

409
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,887
The kohl in the eyes gets smeared.

410
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:26,023
Because of the restless dream.

411
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:37,201
Everyday in my eyes, there
is only one dream.

412
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,573
The kohl in the eyes gets smeared.

413
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:50,013
Because of the restless dream.

414
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:56,092
Everyday in my eyes..

415
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:38,131
The way you dropped your
tresses on the eyes.

416
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:48,039
The poor thing has lost its sleep.

417
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:59,049
The way you dropped your
tresses on the eyes.

418
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:09,323
The poor thing has lost its sleep.

419
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:20,276
Everyday in my eyes, there
is only one dream.

420
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:25,281
The kohl in the eyes gets smeared.

421
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:32,350
Because of the restless dream.

422
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:44,165
Everyday in my eyes, there
is only one dream.

423
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,566
The kohl in the eyes gets smeared.

424
00:36:50,308 --> 00:37:00,513
Because of the restless dream.

425
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,162
Gopal, you!

426
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,071
How did you remember
your sister today?

427
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,401
What happened?

428
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,876
Why don't you say something?

429
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,409
I was thinking about brother-in-law?

430
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,944
Today is the day when
he left all of us.

431
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,351
The memory of this day overshadows
all the other memories.

432
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:50,356
Sister. Sometimes I don't
understand this justice of God.

433
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,893
He could have killed me.

434
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,897
Atleast, you wouldn't
have to live like this.

435
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,467
What is this new way
that you have found?

436
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,509
By expressing your love, you
want your sister to cry?

437
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,280
Remember, when you were
small and I used to cry.

438
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,981
You used to keep a utensil
below my eyes.

439
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:15,349
And used to say, cry
as much as you want.

440
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,527
Your tears taste very sweet sister.

441
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:24,161
And then, I would stop crying
and come to hit you.

442
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,304
What do you want now?

443
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,032
I should beat you. Go.

444
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,437
There is magic in your hands, Tulsi.

445
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,006
In just one dose is enough..

446
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,548
..to treat fever and cough
of the children is treated.

447
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,817
That's why all the women
of the village..

448
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,011
..don't go to any physician.

449
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,280
They come directly come to Tulsi.

450
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,184
It is the magic of
the margosa plant.

451
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,019
I say, it is the valour
of the name Tulsi.

452
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,159
Here son, offering.

453
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,221
Tulsi!

454
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,906
Tulsi!

455
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,181
Tulsi!

456
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,403
Wait Gopal!

457
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,375
Tulsi's last rite will not
be performed right now.

458
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,811
First the police will perform
the post mortem of the corpse.

459
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,553
So that the culprit's
crime can be proven.

460
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:15,494
Father. What harm had my
sister done to anyone?

461
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,998
She was a pious soul.

462
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,232
Then why did this happen with her?

463
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,843
Mother, this unfortunate soul
has been tolerating sorrows..

464
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,180
..since her childhood!

465
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,979
She was my elder sister, but..

466
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,981
I always considered her my daughter.

467
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,524
Always took care of her.

468
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,325
Gave her a lot of love.

469
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,391
A lot.

470
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:56,429
I adorned the nuptial dress.

471
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,937
I brought her the widow's garb.

472
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:11,116
And today, I covered her
with the death shroud.

473
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:17,192
Why did it happen father,
why did it happen?

474
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,489
Gopal!

475
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,224
Gopal!

476
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,565
Don't cry Gopal, calm down.

477
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,164
Calm down!

478
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,833
Don't worry Gopal!

479
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:38,848
I will have that Lala's
son punished.

480
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,914
What are you saying inspector sir?

481
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,146
Are you in your senses?

482
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,188
I am saying what you heard.

483
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,859
If you want to save your son..

484
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,088
..then stop Thakur from testifying
against Rajesh.

485
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:56,258
Because he is the only person
that can aggravate this matter.

486
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,965
I will kill that Thakur!

487
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,527
What are you saying, sit down!

488
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,539
In anger, a person usually forgets
the time and person.

489
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,966
Don't worry son.

490
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,874
Lala will not let anything
happen to his son.

491
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:16,080
The day has arrived when
he has to meet his match.

492
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,313
You are threatening me.

493
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,884
You don't have any stature Lala.

494
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,824
Nothing in the world can stop me..

495
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,486
..from testifying against your son!

496
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:30,293
Whether anyone can stop you or not!

497
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:34,269
But I will not let you succeed
in your motives!

498
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:39,303
I will not let anything
happen to my son!

499
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:43,312
No matter what I have to do for it!

500
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,440
I have always respected
other people, Lala.

501
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,978
But if you wait another
minute at my threshold!

502
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:55,551
Then for the first time in my
life I will insult someone!

503
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,524
I am leaving Thakur.

504
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,531
But remember one thing Thakur.

505
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:07,263
This time you have locked
horns with Lala.

506
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,396
Be ready to face the consequences.

507
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,942
Listen! Listen!

508
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:26,881
What happened?

509
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,015
Why don't you say something?

510
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,287
You won't believe it if you hear it!

511
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,021
Why? Has something
terrible happened?

512
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,892
Did that Lala commit atrocities
on our workers?

513
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,298
These days that's all
you think about.

514
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,269
Three days later our son
Jeevan is coming home.

515
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,563
Really?
- Yes.

516
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,109
Why are you looking like that?

517
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,848
I am seeing, if there
is love in your heart..

518
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,016
..then you can see the entire
world in the eyes.

519
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,389
Then why are you leaving me.

520
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,855
I am not leaving you.

521
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:13,968
I am only going for 3 days to spend
Diwali with mother and father.

522
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,806
You can see the entire
world in my eyes..

523
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,364
..can't you see mother
and father in them.

524
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,867
Good that I don't see them.

525
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,137
Otherwise we will get divorced
after the honeymoon.

526
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,272
Why?

527
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,814
If I see mother and
father in your eyes..

528
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:35,188
..then how can I do that with you?
- Bad boy.

529
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,565
Rocky, do you know he is
leaving me for 3 days.

530
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,200
Rocky, I am going for 3
days to meet my parents.

531
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,964
Can't she wait for me for 3 days?

532
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,204
I cannot tolerate separation.

533
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:57,373
Otherwise I can wait
forever for you.

534
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,942
How nice, my darling.

535
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,514
On that note, happy 'Diwali'.

536
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,900
Listen.
- You haven't slept too.

537
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:57,965
You cannot fall asleep..

538
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,099
..because of the happiness
of the son's arrival.

539
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,004
It's not just that,
I can smell kerosene.

540
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,172
No!

541
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,842
Sleep. Your son will
arrive before dawn.

542
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,780
Until he stays here, neither
will he sleep..

543
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,287
..nor will he let us sleep.

544
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,914
He will create a chaos.

545
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,454
Was Shravan Kumar better
than our son?

546
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,023
Quietly sleep.

547
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,526
An evil of parents casts on
their sons very soon.

548
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,143
Get up! Get up!

549
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,494
Mother!

550
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,834
Father!

551
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,316
Father!

552
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,066
Brother Jeevan.
- Jeevan!

553
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,336
Brother Jeevan,
the fire is very dangerous.

554
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,002
Brother Jeevan, don't go!
- Jeevan!

555
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,137
Leave me!

556
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,451
Mother!

557
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,219
Father!

558
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,396
Mother! Mother!

559
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,208
Father!

560
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,218
Mother! Mother!

561
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,121
Father, how did it catch fire?

562
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,923
How did it catch fire?

563
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,200
Brother Jeevan, Lala has
started this fire.

564
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,443
Lala!

565
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,145
No!

566
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,447
Don't take any wrong step in haste.

567
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,154
Quickly bring the inspector,
I want to give my testimony.

568
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,425
No father, nothing
will happen to you.

569
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:12,366
Don't argue, I have
very less time left.

570
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,531
Go! Go! Go quickly!

571
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,835
Take mother and father
to the hospital..

572
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,844
..I will go and bring the inspector.

573
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,214
Inspector sir, eat some more.

574
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,292
If you don't eat, how
will you survive?

575
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,364
'Don't take any wrong
step in haste.'

576
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,094
'Quickly bring the inspector.'

577
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,204
Inspector sir, come along
with me quickly.

578
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,273
My father's condition
is very serious.

579
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,238
He wants to give his statement.

580
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,006
What can I do if he wants
to give his statement?

581
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,139
I am not on duty right now.

582
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,013
Do one thing come to the police
station tomorrow morning.

583
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,142
We will see then.

584
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:03,877
Inspector sir, please.

585
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,311
It is very important to
take his statement.

586
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,085
I told you, come to the police
station tomorrow morning.

587
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,528
You will have to come
with me right now.

588
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,409
You purposely delayed
in writing the report.

589
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,277
So that Lala can be saved from
the clutches of the law.

590
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,575
First let me deal
with you inspector.

591
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,577
Then I will take care of Lala.

592
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,846
I.. I will shoot you!

593
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:10,871
Are you sure?

594
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,209
I am asking because l
know Jeevan personally.

595
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,076
I don't believe this.

596
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,012
Quickly prepare the complete
report of this case..

597
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,316
..and send it to me.

598
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,516
Yes, I will investigate
this case myself.

599
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,350
Okay.

600
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,954
What happened to Jeevan?

601
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:30,263
Jeevan's parents died in a fire.

602
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:37,003
And Jeevan murdered
a police inspector.

603
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:38,899
What?

604
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,144
Brother!

605
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:57,410
I have brought mother and
father's ashes for you.

606
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:06,424
I am so unfortunate, Gopal.

607
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,531
Forget about taking
care of my parents.

608
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,433
I couldn't even perform
their last rites.

609
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,064
I couldn't do it!

610
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,446
So Mr. Jeevan.

611
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,824
How did you come to the conclusion..

612
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,417
..that Lala Lalchand was behind
the fire in your house?

613
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,561
All the villagers know.

614
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,888
You can ask anyone.

615
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,567
Look, there are many villagers
present in the court.

616
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,072
You can ask anyone you
want me to ask first.

617
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:02,508
Him.. Motichand sitting right there.

618
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,110
You can ask him.

619
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,323
'Remember one thing.'

620
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:14,797
'lf anyone of you testifies
against me or my son.'

621
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:19,795
'Then know that, you have seen..

622
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:25,068
..your family for the last time.'

623
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,539
Why are you quiet?

624
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,541
Why don't you answer?

625
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,445
What can I say sir?

626
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,482
Moti, you had said yourself.

627
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,017
That Lala used his men to
set the manor on fire.

628
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,320
When did I say?

629
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,890
I didn't say anything.

630
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,396
Let me go, sir.

631
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,026
I am a family man!

632
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,531
Let me go.

633
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,565
I don't know anything!

634
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,300
I don't know anything!

635
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,568
I don't know anything!

636
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:12,149
In the light of the evidence,
it has been proven.

637
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,792
That Jeevan Thakur deliberately
killed..

638
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,023
..inspector Murali, and
it was no coincidence.

639
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,961
The accused was going to
become a police officer.

640
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:26,798
Still he murdered a
responsible officer..

641
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,806
..not only committed a crime,
but also gave a very bad..

642
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:35,208
..example to the society.

643
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:39,815
So the court states him a criminal..

644
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:45,344
..under lPC 302, sentences
him to death.

645
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,554
'lf you ever need me, then there is
a Kali temple on the mountain.'

646
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:59,095
'Come there and ring the bell
thrice, and I will come.'

647
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:41,242
Rajesh sir! Please don't
stop me today Rajesh sir!

648
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,005
I plead to you!

649
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,148
Don't stop me sir!

650
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,379
Please let me go!

651
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:56,825
Instead of aiding your one
night brother-in-law..

652
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:00,954
..you are helping that
scoundrel, Jeevan.

653
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:02,828
Rascal!

654
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,373
Brother!

655
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,508
Call your brother!

656
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:27,981
Come on!

657
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,877
My brother will die!

658
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,940
My brother will die!

659
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,484
Is someone there?

660
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,813
Is someone there?

661
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:46,461
Inspector I want to meet Jeevan.

662
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,997
But sir, Jeevan has been taken
to the Central Jail.

663
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,862
When? About 4 hours ago.

664
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,398
They must have reached there by now.

665
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,342
Stop the car!

666
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:18,471
Chief, you wanted him to free him
from the clutches of the police.

667
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,878
We have brought him.

668
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,208
But he will not live with us.

669
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:23,876
Why?

670
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:25,284
Because till yesterday he
was a police officer.

671
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:29,085
And they have always posed
as a danger for us.

672
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,950
Who knows, he might
not have changed.

673
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:36,431
Yes chief!
- Yes chief, he cannot stay with us.

674
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:40,959
Whether you keep me along
with you or not.

675
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,837
I would like to say one thing.

676
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,432
I don't have any connection
with the police now.

677
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,843
Consider me one of your own.

678
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,450
Fine.

679
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:09,454
But to join us, you will
have to take an oath!

680
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,258
I accept!

681
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,065
I swear on your Mother Kali!

682
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,469
I swear on your Mother Kali!

683
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,408
No weak or poor people..

684
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,467
No weak or poor people..

685
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,137
Will not be exploited!

686
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,874
Will not be exploited!

687
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,006
And the people.

688
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,141
And the people.

689
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,275
That commit atrocity.

690
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,478
That commit atrocity.

691
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,350
I will severely punish them!

692
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,412
I will severely punish them!

693
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,096
The man called Jeevan wanted
to spend his life..

694
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,364
..as the protector of the law.

695
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,166
But the law misguided him.

696
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,500
That's why, change my name chief!

697
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,845
From today, your name is Jeeva!

698
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,454
Brother Jeeva.
- Hail!

699
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:17,990
Gopal!

700
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,867
Where are the scoundrels,
Lala and his son?

701
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,869
They have gone to select a girl.

702
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,461
For Rajesh's marriage.

703
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,332
Let him know.

704
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,932
That Jagir Singh's group had come.

705
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,468
And will come again on the
day of the engagement!

706
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,210
Let us plunder the place.

707
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:44,146
No chief, we have come to
kill Lala and his son.

708
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,879
We will plunder this place
right in front of them.

709
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,482
Till today we haven't
returned empty handed.

710
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,356
And we won't return empty
handed today too.

711
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:56,824
3 miles away from here, the
Chaudhary if Plassey..

712
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,300
..is celebrating his victory
in the elections.

713
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,097
We will go there.

714
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,366
I suddenly felt shy.

715
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:13,439
I dance so much that
my anklets broke.

716
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,783
I suddenly felt shy.

717
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:25,055
I dance so much that
my anklets broke.

718
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:29,056
The anklets broke.

719
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:35,131
The anklets broke.

720
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,862
The anklets broke.

721
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,215
The dacoits have come!

722
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,486
The dacoits have come! Run! Run!

723
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,835
No, no don't shoot me.

724
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,250
Don't kill me!

725
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,519
What is my fault?

726
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:51,070
No, no!

727
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,073
Open the safe!

728
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,277
Open the safe!

729
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:59,412
I am opening it. I am opening it.

730
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:08,954
Jeeva.

731
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,839
Why did you stop Jeeva?

732
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,849
He has accumulated all this wealth..

733
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,857
..by committing atrocity
on poor people!

734
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,119
We have come to take what
belongs to the poor.

735
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:52,535
No!

736
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:55,867
Leave me! Leave me!

737
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,881
Come with me! Come on!

738
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,008
Leave me!

739
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,143
Lakhan!

740
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,481
Why did you forcefully abduct her?

741
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,288
My wish! I will do as I please.

742
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,887
Who are you to question me?

743
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:17,957
Jeeva!

744
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,961
Come Champa, I will take you back.

745
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,833
You cannot take her back.

746
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,374
I will see who stops me.

747
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:27,967
Lakhan!

748
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,038
What's going on?

749
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:34,378
Chief explain him, he
is crossing his limits.

750
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,850
I am not crossing my limits, chief.

751
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:40,847
It is the oath I had taken
in front of Mother Kali.

752
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:45,189
Abducting Champa-bai against
her will is wrong.

753
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,987
And I will never let that happen.

754
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,991
Even if I have to revolt against
all of you for it.

755
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,001
Did you see chief?

756
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,405
I knew it, that this officer
will show his true colours.

757
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:01,466
He is ready to go against
all of use for a dancer.

758
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,479
Why, don't they have a heart?

759
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,080
Doesn't she shed tears?

760
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,411
Jeeva will take you back girl.

761
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,308
What did you say?

762
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,909
They cannot pay my interest.

763
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:48,115
Whip them!

764
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,185
Snatch the jewellery of the women,
the toys of children..

765
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,523
..the grains in the fields.

766
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,188
Bulls, cows everything!

767
01:13:56,465 --> 01:14:00,993
You can survive the snake's bite.

768
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:06,063
But not Lala's principle
and interest!

769
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,199
Understood!

770
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,804
Don't beat me!

771
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,879
Old woman, get up.

772
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,079
What are you doing?

773
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,213
Don't do this.

774
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,815
We will repay your debt!

775
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,952
Don't beat him!

776
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,495
Don't beat my son.
- Take him away.

777
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,299
He doesn't pay the interest
of loan taken from Lala!

778
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,496
I will pay the interest!

779
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,385
Brother Jeeva!

780
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:06,858
Son! Son, are you fine?

781
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,994
They beat my son up!

782
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,286
My son, are you hurt?

783
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,228
You have come to recover
Lala's interest.

784
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,831
And I have come to
recover the blood..

785
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,427
..that you shed of these people.

786
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,835
My son, get up!

787
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,504
Lala Lalchand
- Down with him!

788
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,172
Lala Lalchand
- Down with him!

789
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,977
Lala Lalchand
- Down with him!

790
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,517
Lala Lalchand
- Down with him!

791
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,177
Lala Lalchand
- Down with him!

792
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:06,852
Son, this old woman will always
be indebted to you.

793
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:09,056
May you live long!

794
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,257
May you live long!

795
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,802
Jeeva has badly thrashed up my men!

796
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:22,139
And you say that there
is no need to panic.

797
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:25,139
Inspector sir, it is not just
the question of my men..

798
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:28,478
..but also my son's engagement.

799
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,814
Tomorrow is my son's engagement..

800
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,820
..and that dacoit Jagir
Singh has threatened me.

801
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,083
That he will surely come on
the day of the engagement.

802
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,489
If he comes, then he won't go back.

803
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,493
Lala, he is Mr. Dushyant.

804
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,085
The new in-charge of this district.

805
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:44,360
He has taken transfer here
specially to apprehend Jagir Singh.

806
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,097
Yes sir tomorrow is
my son's engagement.

807
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,501
And that dacoit Jagir..
- I know.

808
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,302
I have read the complaint
your had lodged.

809
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,432
You read it.
- Yes.

810
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,501
Make arrangements for
your son's engagement.

811
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,511
The police will take
care of everything.

812
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:59,907
Will you come too?
- Yes.

813
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,440
Will you surely come?
- I will come, Lala.

814
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,779
Thank you.

815
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,859
Gopal, is this news true?

816
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:13,986
It is absolutely true, sir.

817
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:17,787
The inspector was happily
telling the villagers..

818
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:21,063
..that Lala's son's marriage is
like the bait in the mouse trap.

819
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,396
If Jagir Singh comes..
- Chief!

820
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,197
We shouldn't go there.

821
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,469
It is not sensible to risk
our life deliberately.

822
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:34,003
Dacoits use their courage
and not there sense.

823
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,016
Right now both of you are right.

824
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:44,815
But to win over this situation.

825
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,086
We will need sense and courage.

826
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,174
Greetings, greetings, greetings.
- Greetings. Greetings.

827
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:09,176
Who amongst you is Lala's
son's future father-in-law?

828
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,445
Me, why?

829
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,781
Greetings.

830
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,788
Dacoit Jagir Singh has threatened..

831
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,790
..to come at Lala's house.
- What?

832
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,918
That's why Lala has sent
us to bring you safely.

833
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,987
Dacoit Jagir Singh is going
to come at Lala's house.

834
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:24,464
Surely!

835
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,468
Then we won't go there.
- Yes we won't go there

836
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,065
Everyone has alighted.

837
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,936
What will I do by going there alone?

838
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:37,274
You cannot go out.
- Why?

839
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,272
Because it is important for
you to be present there..

840
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:40,473
..for the auspicious ceremony.

841
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,484
What if dacoit Jagir
Singh caught me?

842
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:47,488
Consider that dacoit Jagir
Singh has caught you.

843
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:51,823
Wow!

844
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:57,221
If you say anything, then
I will shoot you.

845
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,028
Do as I say.

846
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,237
Wait for the right chance.

847
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:15,176
Look behind him.

848
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:19,912
Understood.

849
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,118
Come on.

850
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,250
Come, you made me wait quite a lot.

851
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,125
Who is he?

852
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:30,926
How can I praise myself?

853
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:36,801
Praise the Lord that has made
you me, and your relative.

854
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:40,337
By the way, I am his
distant relative.

855
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:41,466
Okay! Okay!

856
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:46,139
That means, you are my
son's future uncle.

857
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,205
No I am the elder uncle.

858
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,477
That's one and the same.

859
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:54,079
But I cannot see my son-in-law,
where is he?

860
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,953
You mean Rajesh!

861
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,289
He is getting ready in his room.

862
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:00,953
Gopi!

863
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,831
Gopi, show him the auspicious ring.

864
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,307
Lala, tell me one thing.

865
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,106
In your son's engagement, is
the police going to dance..

866
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:20,376
..or have you arranged for
some entertainment.

867
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:22,382
Something flashy! I didn't
understand that!

868
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:26,511
I mean something really great.

869
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:29,523
There is an arrangement
for the night.

870
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,252
In the night.

871
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:21,242
Life depends on my glance.

872
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:27,309
Life depends on my glance.

873
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:31,109
It will pierce your heart

874
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:36,988
It will pierce your heart
if I look at you.

875
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:42,462
Life depends on my glance.

876
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:48,934
Life depends on my glance.

877
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:56,532
I offer my life and wealth to you.

878
01:22:56,604 --> 01:23:02,804
You have time until
I remain in my veil.

879
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:12,080
I offer my life and wealth to you.

880
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:18,023
You have time until
I remain in my veil.

881
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,891
It will pierce your heart

882
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:30,095
It will pierce your heart
if I look at you.

883
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,036
Just one glance.

884
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:34,833
Just one glance.

885
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:42,175
Life depends on my glance.

886
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:41,434
The culprit of the
heart is present.

887
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:44,501
Bring forth the murderer
of my heart.

888
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,514
Put your life at stake.

889
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,441
Show the magic of your hands.

890
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:56,855
The culprit of the
heart is present.

891
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,860
Bring forth the murderer
of my heart.

892
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,795
Show the magic of your hands.

893
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,802
It will..

894
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:17,937
It will pierce your heart
if I look at you.

895
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,479
Just one glance.

896
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:26,819
Life depends on my glance.

897
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:37,422
Rajesh!

898
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,294
Rajesh!

899
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:43,971
Rajesh, my son.

900
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:46,302
What.. has happened to you?

901
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,366
No one can separate you from me.

902
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:52,971
I will take you America, Japan
but I will not let you die.

903
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:54,307
My son!

904
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:57,374
As long as Lala is there,
no one can harm you.

905
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,919
No one can harm you.

906
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,264
Jeevan, you.

907
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:22,809
Not Jeevan, Jeeva!

908
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:25,810
Dacoit Jeeva!

909
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:30,346
How did you become the
enemy of the police?

910
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:35,412
Ask that scoundrel Lala,
whom you are protecting.

911
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,419
He burnt my parents alive.

912
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:44,829
On the basis of his wealth, he
turned justice into injustice.

913
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:48,030
I can understand your
feelings, Jeevan.

914
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,430
But there is still time.

915
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,438
Handover yourself to the police!

916
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,032
I will surrender myself
to the police.

917
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,846
But before that, handover
Lala to me.

918
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,109
You know that's impossible.

919
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:05,311
It might be impossible for you!

920
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,785
How long will you protect Lala?

921
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:14,854
Someday I will kill him.

922
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:17,055
Wait!

923
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,325
You cannot leave from here!

924
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:27,465
S.P sir, take a look around
once before firing.

925
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:48,953
Jagir Singh!

926
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:54,826
S.P sir, if you shoot, then not
only the protectors of the law..

927
01:27:54,902 --> 01:28:00,841
..but a lot of innocent
people will die too.

928
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:02,767
Think about that.

929
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:04,778
And let us leave from here.

930
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:19,911
Chief!

931
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,788
Stop the police!

932
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:46,006
Scoundrel! Why did you
fire on the police?

933
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,810
Because, till today
wherever we went..

934
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:50,874
..we never returned empty handed.

935
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,817
Atleast I killed a police personnel!

936
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:59,292
Scoundrel, do you know what your
action has done to chief.

937
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,157
Brother Jeeva! Brother Jeeva!

938
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,821
Chief is very critical!

939
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:03,955
Come quickly.

940
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,089
Come on!

941
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:13,835
Jeeva!

942
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:20,172
I don't know why, seeing
you I don't hate life!

943
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:25,916
In my life, I have committed
a lot of crime.

944
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,513
But I never committed any sin.

945
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:36,124
That's why I want you to
perform my last rites.

946
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,191
Tell me son.

947
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:44,002
Will you fulfil my wish, son?

948
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:47,873
Why are you quiet son?

949
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:52,335
Don't you want to perform
the last rites of a dacoit?

950
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:55,210
That's not it chief!

951
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:59,544
I am very unfortunate.

952
01:31:01,355 --> 01:31:03,414
I couldn't perform the last
rites of my parents.

953
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:13,296
You consider me as your son,
how can I refuse!

954
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:20,897
Thank you very much Lord.

955
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,504
You gave me a life of a dacoit.

956
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,372
But you granted me a
death of a father.

957
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:35,922
Only you know your justice!

958
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,858
That's fine, but atleast
tell everyone..

959
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:42,122
..that now I am the chief!

960
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,523
Why are you quiet? Why don't
you say something?

961
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,112
You are a man, why are you
crying like a woman..

962
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:08,247
..on chief's death!

963
01:32:08,858 --> 01:32:11,725
Take an oath, you will
avenge chief's death!

964
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:15,128
I will never forgive that
scoundrel Dushyant Singh..

965
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:17,256
..whose bullet killed chief.

966
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:22,670
I will tarnish his image, so that
the rest of his life is miserable.

967
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,131
Do you want to know how?

968
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,143
He has a young and
beautiful daughter.

969
01:32:31,614 --> 01:32:32,672
Scoundrel!

970
01:32:33,482 --> 01:32:35,143
You talk about being a man..

971
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:36,479
..and talk about such
cowardice acts!

972
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:39,152
If you want to avenge chief death..

973
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:40,688
..then take it from Dushyant Singh!

974
01:32:41,357 --> 01:32:43,348
What is the fault of
that innocent girl?

975
01:32:43,426 --> 01:32:44,825
You scoundrel!

976
01:32:45,361 --> 01:32:46,828
The hell with that girl and..

977
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:52,625
Who are you to take objection
on my decision?

978
01:32:53,436 --> 01:32:57,304
Your decision can't be against
the chief's ideals.

979
01:32:57,373 --> 01:32:59,500
Chief ideals are gone
along with chief!

980
01:32:59,575 --> 01:33:01,099
Now I am the chief here!

981
01:33:01,177 --> 01:33:03,111
You will have to do what I tell you.

982
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:04,237
Not at all!

983
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,374
If you don't follow
the ideals of chief.

984
01:33:08,184 --> 01:33:10,118
Then you can't be our chief!

985
01:33:10,519 --> 01:33:12,783
Then will you become our chief?

986
01:33:12,855 --> 01:33:17,121
To stop atrocities, I am
ready to do that too.

987
01:33:17,193 --> 01:33:19,252
Say clearly that you want
to become the chief.

988
01:33:19,328 --> 01:33:22,263
If that's so, then come
in the battlefield.

989
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:33,802
What has happened
to the both of you?

990
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,142
Chief's pier is still ablaze..

991
01:33:37,213 --> 01:33:39,545
..and you are shedding each other's
blood to become the chief.

992
01:33:40,616 --> 01:33:42,675
Look, it is very clear.

993
01:33:43,753 --> 01:33:46,415
Those who respect chief's ideals.

994
01:33:47,156 --> 01:33:48,555
They will be with brother Jeeva.

995
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:50,682
The rest will be with you.

996
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,159
That's right Lakhan!

997
01:33:54,497 --> 01:33:57,091
This is not the time to shed blood.

998
01:33:57,366 --> 01:33:59,357
Lakhan, you are our old companion!

999
01:33:59,435 --> 01:34:01,562
That's why you are our chief.

1000
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:22,453
Chief Lakhan!
- Hail!

1001
01:34:22,525 --> 01:34:24,322
Chief Lakhan!
- Hail!

1002
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:26,122
Chief Lakhan!
- Hail!

1003
01:34:26,195 --> 01:34:27,594
Chief Lakhan!
- Hail!

1004
01:34:35,404 --> 01:34:37,338
Papa! What happened papa?

1005
01:34:38,207 --> 01:34:39,265
Nothing?

1006
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,399
There is something papa?
Tell me please.

1007
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:42,741
I had met Jeevan yesterday.

1008
01:34:42,812 --> 01:34:44,609
Jeevan! How is he?

1009
01:34:45,414 --> 01:34:46,472
How is he, papa tell me!

1010
01:34:47,683 --> 01:34:51,084
The circumstances under
which I met him.

1011
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:54,145
It would have been better
if I had not met him.

1012
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:58,490
Jeevan is not dacoit Jeeva!

1013
01:34:59,762 --> 01:35:01,286
Please don't joke with me papa.

1014
01:35:02,298 --> 01:35:03,629
I am not joking Ninu.

1015
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,558
I am telling the truth!

1016
01:35:06,569 --> 01:35:08,434
You will have to forget
Jeevan forever!

1017
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:10,102
I cannot forget him papa.

1018
01:35:10,506 --> 01:35:12,098
Save him anyhow.

1019
01:35:12,174 --> 01:35:13,300
Please save him, papa.

1020
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:16,236
Remember one thing Ninu.

1021
01:35:17,179 --> 01:35:21,115
I cannot forget my
duty for your love.

1022
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:25,250
Your marriage was just
fixed with Jeevan.

1023
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:28,447
Even if you would have
been married to him.

1024
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:34,128
This helpless father would
have killed your husband..

1025
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:37,723
..for his duty.

1026
01:35:41,604 --> 01:35:43,128
I am happy to know father.

1027
01:35:43,806 --> 01:35:47,537
That your duty holds more importance
for you than your daughter.

1028
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:40,723
Jeevan!

1029
01:36:45,401 --> 01:36:46,595
Jeevan!

1030
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:23,096
People usually plunge their
enemies in darkness.

1031
01:37:24,306 --> 01:37:26,103
But I have lighted
this light for you.

1032
01:37:27,176 --> 01:37:29,371
And if this light douses..

1033
01:38:14,156 --> 01:38:19,355
The heart calls out!

1034
01:38:20,295 --> 01:38:24,493
The heart calls out!

1035
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,091
Come Jeeva!

1036
01:38:27,169 --> 01:38:31,367
I am calling out
for you everywhere..

1037
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,431
I am leaving behind
a trail of my voice.

1038
01:38:33,509 --> 01:38:38,310
Come following
the trail of my voice.

1039
01:38:39,114 --> 01:38:43,244
The heart calls out!

1040
01:38:43,318 --> 01:38:46,310
Come Jeeva!

1041
01:38:47,723 --> 01:38:50,191
I am calling out
for you everywhere..

1042
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:52,318
I am leaving behind
a trail of my voice.

1043
01:38:52,394 --> 01:38:57,263
Come following the
trail of my voice.

1044
01:38:58,267 --> 01:39:02,727
The heart calls out!

1045
01:39:36,772 --> 01:39:41,368
Unfamiliar courtyard,
unfamiliar people.

1046
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:46,107
If you don't come, I might die.

1047
01:39:49,384 --> 01:39:53,718
Unfamiliar courtyard,
unfamiliar people.

1048
01:39:53,789 --> 01:39:58,055
If you don't come,
I might die.

1049
01:39:58,127 --> 01:40:00,254
Unfamiliar courtyard,
unfamiliar people.

1050
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:02,320
If you don't come, I might die.

1051
01:40:02,397 --> 01:40:07,664
Save yourself from the
darkness and come.

1052
01:40:08,137 --> 01:40:12,130
The heart calls out!

1053
01:40:12,207 --> 01:40:14,300
Come Jeeva!

1054
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:20,273
I am leaving behind
a trail of my voice.

1055
01:40:20,349 --> 01:40:26,083
Come following the
trail of my voice.

1056
01:40:27,289 --> 01:40:31,555
The heart calls out!

1057
01:41:02,124 --> 01:41:06,254
I will have to keep myself alive.

1058
01:41:06,328 --> 01:41:10,458
I have to keep awake until
you don't arrive.

1059
01:41:10,532 --> 01:41:12,523
I don't have anymore strength.

1060
01:41:12,601 --> 01:41:14,660
The light might douse.

1061
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:19,400
Come before I die.

1062
01:41:20,609 --> 01:41:24,602
The heart calls out!

1063
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:27,547
Come Jeeva!

1064
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:31,081
I am calling out
for you everywhere..

1065
01:41:31,153 --> 01:41:33,621
I am leaving behind
a trail of my voice.

1066
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:38,626
Come following the
trail of my voice.

1067
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:44,098
The heart calls out!

1068
01:41:44,166 --> 01:41:47,567
The heart calls out!

1069
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:53,233
The heart calls out!

1070
01:41:59,248 --> 01:42:00,306
Girl!

1071
01:42:03,185 --> 01:42:04,243
It's still burning.

1072
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,318
It's doused!

1073
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:29,261
Jeeva!

1074
01:43:29,338 --> 01:43:32,273
Take a look here
before killing the chief!

1075
01:43:41,283 --> 01:43:44,684
If you value Gopal's life,
then leave chief.

1076
01:43:47,356 --> 01:43:48,414
Fine!

1077
01:43:49,491 --> 01:43:50,685
First release Gopal.

1078
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,089
Then I will release Lakhan!

1079
01:44:10,712 --> 01:44:11,770
No!

1080
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:25,316
Lakhan!

1081
01:44:31,133 --> 01:44:32,395
What did you do my friend?

1082
01:44:34,202 --> 01:44:38,332
I will never be able
to repay your favour!

1083
01:44:39,207 --> 01:44:42,267
No! No brother Jeeva!

1084
01:44:43,345 --> 01:44:46,473
Big people do favours.

1085
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:50,084
I am a very small man.

1086
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:53,754
I am a selfish man, brother Jeeva.

1087
01:44:55,157 --> 01:45:00,356
You know, Rakhi is approaching.

1088
01:45:01,163 --> 01:45:04,496
I have to go to my sister.

1089
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:08,360
My sister must be waiting for me.

1090
01:45:12,374 --> 01:45:13,432
Okay brother Jeeva.

1091
01:45:14,509 --> 01:45:15,567
Okay.

1092
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:21,440
No, I will not let you die.

1093
01:45:22,784 --> 01:45:24,376
I will not let you die, Gopal.

1094
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,618
Uncle!

1095
01:46:07,629 --> 01:46:08,687
Uncle!

1096
01:46:11,366 --> 01:46:12,492
Save my brother, uncle!

1097
01:46:12,701 --> 01:46:14,100
Save my brother!

1098
01:46:48,336 --> 01:46:50,065
You cannot leave me!

1099
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:52,138
You cannot leave me!

1100
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:25,231
Since you have come in life,
I have faced death and defeat.

1101
01:47:27,175 --> 01:47:30,167
Your love has snatched all
happiness of my life.

1102
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:33,641
First you snatched my parents.

1103
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:37,508
All I had was a friend.

1104
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,714
Today I lost him too.

1105
01:47:42,324 --> 01:47:45,589
You love is not love, but a curse.

1106
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:50,063
Go away from my life.

1107
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:53,657
Get lost! Get lost!

1108
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:14,610
Madhav, prepare the pier!

1109
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:30,626
Jeeva, handover yourself
to the police!

1110
01:48:32,574 --> 01:48:34,303
I am telling you for the
last time, come out.

1111
01:48:42,384 --> 01:48:44,375
Jeevan! Jeevan, run away from here.

1112
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,186
I will sit here and fire the gun!

1113
01:48:46,254 --> 01:48:48,051
The police will not suspect
that you have left.

1114
01:48:48,123 --> 01:48:49,385
I am a dacoit not a coward.

1115
01:48:49,457 --> 01:48:50,583
Don't argue!

1116
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:55,061
You are under the oath of the
love you have for your parents.

1117
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:58,657
For your friend! And
a girl named Ninu!

1118
01:49:00,135 --> 01:49:03,730
If you delay anymore, then
I will shoot myself.

1119
01:49:04,339 --> 01:49:05,397
Go Jeeva!

1120
01:49:19,354 --> 01:49:20,412
Spread around!

1121
01:49:49,117 --> 01:49:50,175
What did you do?

1122
01:49:50,452 --> 01:49:52,511
What I should do as a daughter.

1123
01:49:53,388 --> 01:49:57,518
If you can kill my husband
being my father.

1124
01:49:58,126 --> 01:50:00,526
Then can't I prevent that murder.

1125
01:50:02,464 --> 01:50:04,056
I am following your ideal!

1126
01:50:30,158 --> 01:50:33,093
Brother Jeeva, you didn't
do the right thing..

1127
01:50:33,161 --> 01:50:36,688
..by insulting that police
officers daughter.

1128
01:50:40,168 --> 01:50:41,567
Even I didn't like it Madhav!

1129
01:50:43,505 --> 01:50:47,305
But there was no other way to
separate her from my life.

1130
01:50:47,575 --> 01:50:49,304
Then, did you deliberately..

1131
01:50:49,644 --> 01:50:57,107
Yes Madhav, everything I told
Nalini indirectly hurt me!

1132
01:50:58,586 --> 01:50:59,644
But what else can I do.

1133
01:51:01,122 --> 01:51:06,059
Love brings helplessness
and sorrows along.

1134
01:51:08,129 --> 01:51:12,122
I don't want her to
be a dacoit's widow.

1135
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:14,392
She is a very nice girl.

1136
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:18,068
The truth is, we were
saved because of her.

1137
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:21,404
Otherwise, her father would
have surely arrested us.

1138
01:51:23,144 --> 01:51:24,202
Yes.

1139
01:51:25,613 --> 01:51:28,081
Dushyant Singh is a very
clever inspector.

1140
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:30,742
It is very difficult to evade him.

1141
01:51:32,554 --> 01:51:34,351
And before he finds us.

1142
01:51:37,759 --> 01:51:42,696
I will kill my enemy, Lala.

1143
01:51:42,764 --> 01:51:45,232
Lala is completely
aware of this fact.

1144
01:51:45,767 --> 01:51:48,361
That's why he is always
under police protection.

1145
01:51:48,436 --> 01:51:49,562
I know.

1146
01:51:50,772 --> 01:51:53,502
That's why I don't want you
both to risk your lives.

1147
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:56,176
I will do this alone.

1148
01:51:56,244 --> 01:51:58,303
We didn't leave Lakhan.

1149
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:01,375
So that, we leave you too one day.

1150
01:52:01,449 --> 01:52:03,110
Madhav is right, Jeeva.

1151
01:52:05,253 --> 01:52:06,584
Then let's do one thing.

1152
01:52:08,523 --> 01:52:12,459
Chaggan, go to your Nandpur
along with Madhav.

1153
01:52:13,328 --> 01:52:14,659
And create a stir there.

1154
01:52:15,663 --> 01:52:17,130
The police will receive
a false information..

1155
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:19,132
..that there has been a
loot in Nandpur village.

1156
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:21,200
The police will reach there.

1157
01:52:23,204 --> 01:52:26,401
And I will go to Lala and kill him.

1158
01:52:29,277 --> 01:52:34,271
This way, the task will be
complete, without much effort.

1159
01:52:34,549 --> 01:52:37,143
Bravo Chaggan, bravo.

1160
01:52:38,186 --> 01:52:43,214
When Jeeva will pass through
the jungle to reach Lala.

1161
01:52:48,763 --> 01:52:50,094
Chief, my reward!

1162
01:52:56,638 --> 01:52:57,696
What did you chief?

1163
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:01,374
When this scoundrel
can betray Jeeva..

1164
01:53:01,442 --> 01:53:04,639
..then how can he be faithful to us.

1165
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:08,707
Understood!

1166
01:53:41,816 --> 01:53:43,147
Jeeva!

1167
01:53:43,818 --> 01:53:48,414
I and all my companions
are restless to kill you!

1168
01:53:51,426 --> 01:53:58,093
Jeeva! Today I will give
you a suffering death!

1169
01:54:06,174 --> 01:54:07,232
Kill him!

1170
01:56:29,584 --> 01:56:30,642
Jeeva!

1171
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:44,122
Jeeva, there is a gorge behind you..

1172
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:46,462
..and my gun in front of you!

1173
01:56:47,468 --> 01:56:50,062
That means, there is
death for certain!

1174
01:57:27,241 --> 01:57:32,110
Lala, Jeeva who was a
threat to your life..

1175
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:36,446
..he has died such a terrible
death by my hands.

1176
01:57:37,185 --> 01:57:40,382
That the Gods will think twice
before bringing alive again.

1177
01:57:41,322 --> 01:57:46,783
That's why Lala is rewarding
you 50000 rupees.

1178
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:49,329
For covering Jeeva with
the death shroud!

1179
01:57:49,397 --> 01:57:50,455
Here.

1180
01:58:00,675 --> 01:58:05,738
Lala! Dead people are covered
with the shroud.

1181
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,606
Not those who are alive.

1182
01:58:09,483 --> 01:58:11,610
Jeeva is another name of life.

1183
01:58:37,712 --> 01:58:41,307
Don't come forward, I will
call the police! No!

1184
01:58:41,382 --> 01:58:42,508
Kill the scoundrel!

1185
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:43,641
Kill the scoundrel!

1186
02:00:37,431 --> 02:00:38,693
Take a look Lala.

1187
02:00:39,767 --> 02:00:42,565
The atrocities and cruelty
that you committed.

1188
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:47,503
Today they are restless to kill you!

1189
02:00:49,643 --> 02:00:55,707
They have come to return you what
you gave them all their life.

1190
02:00:57,451 --> 02:00:59,715
The blood that you shed
of their siblings.

1191
02:01:02,189 --> 02:01:04,384
The death of my parents.

1192
02:01:06,127 --> 02:01:09,528
The ones you burned alive.

1193
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:15,057
I have come to settle
the score with, Lala!

1194
02:01:16,137 --> 02:01:18,071
You will have to deal with me.

1195
02:01:20,207 --> 02:01:21,265
No!

1196
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:23,066
No Jeeva!

1197
02:01:23,344 --> 02:01:28,475
No Jeeva, don't come ahead!

1198
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:31,074
I plead to you Jeeva,
please forgive me!

1199
02:01:50,504 --> 02:01:51,766
No!

1200
02:01:51,839 --> 02:01:54,364
That's enough, please stop now!

1201
02:02:16,464 --> 02:02:17,590
Brother Jeeva!
- Hail!

1202
02:02:17,665 --> 02:02:19,257
Brother Jeeva!
- Hail!

1203
02:02:19,667 --> 02:02:21,396
Brother Jeeva!
- Hail!

1204
02:02:21,469 --> 02:02:23,130
Brother Jeeva!
- Hail!

1205
02:02:23,204 --> 02:02:24,262
Jeevan!

1206
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,087
In the court of law,
Jeevan is a criminal.

1207
02:02:51,298 --> 02:02:55,098
But in the court humanity,
behind every crime..

1208
02:02:55,169 --> 02:02:58,161
..there is the atrocity
committed by the cruel.

1209
02:02:58,706 --> 02:03:04,645
Every protector of the law,
is a human first.

1210
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:09,115
And that's why, on humanitarian
grounds..

1211
02:03:09,183 --> 02:03:12,641
..keeping the circumstances in mind.

1212
02:03:13,587 --> 02:03:18,183
Sentences Jeeva.. Jeevan Thakur
for 5 years of jail.

1213
02:03:21,462 --> 02:03:22,520
'And after 5 years.'

1214
02:03:24,265 --> 02:03:28,531
Everyday in my eyes..

1215
02:03:29,737 --> 02:03:34,401
Everyday in my eyes..

1216
02:03:43,217 --> 02:03:47,153
Everyday in my eyes..
