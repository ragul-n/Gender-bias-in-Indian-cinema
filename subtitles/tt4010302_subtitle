1
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,167
Ayyanar?

2
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,833
The whole town is off to see the holy man. Aren't you coming?

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,125
I was told the owners of the palace

4
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:57,083
are visiting for a few days.

5
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,708
They said they'd sell it to me.

6
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,250
It has been shut for 5 years, right?

7
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,042
That's why I'm going to clean up the place.

8
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,000
What about the girl who ran away? - They've traced her.

9
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,792
They said they'd be here within 2-3 days.

10
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,333
Take the blessings of the holy man on my behalf as well. - Okay.

11
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:10,708
Start the car.

12
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,500
Which palace? What is the deal?

13
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,500
You're new to the town so you don't know.

14
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,208
At the far end of our town, there is a palace that belongs to the old landlord.

15
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,333
Acres and acres of land.. Worth millions.

16
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,000
Ayyanar is the caretaker for now.

17
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,667
He has been a caretaker for so many years.

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,500
He intends buying it now.

19
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:32,875
But the problem is, the landlord has 3 heirs.

20
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,708
Two sons and a daughter.

21
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,375
The daughter eloped with a servant.

22
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,292
Only if she signs the contract, the palace can be sold.

23
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,292
They were searching for her all these years.

24
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,333
They must have finally found her.

25
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,000
See how smart Ayyanar is!

26
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,917
Even before buying the palace

27
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,208
he struck a deal with a foreign company.

28
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,375
He'll make a fortune soon.

29
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,167
Wait here. I'll go and take a look.

30
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,958
Go that side. - Hurry up.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,375
Are the preparations going fine for the festival of our goddess?

32
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:34,542
Yes, very well.

33
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,083
Our goddess is going to be taken on a procession this Friday.

34
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,250
You are travelling through our town

35
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,583
and we feel sad that you are not stopping by.

36
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,708
You know how important project Mukkoodal is!

37
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:47,792
No, Sage, it's just..

38
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,542
I'll definitely come when the time is right.

39
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,667
Sir!

40
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,125
What is it?

41
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:09,917
It's a termite hill, right in the center of the house.

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe because it was locked up for 5 years.

43
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,375
Maybe this place is.. Don't let your imagination run wild!

44
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,167
Go and do your work.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,542
Sage, a request.

46
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,833
You're not stopping by

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,625
but do bless our land with your holy tread, please!

48
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,875
What is this?

49
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,833
He must have struck the snake inside the hill.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,417
That blood must have spurted out.

51
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,458
Boss, I need a hand. - Let's go help.

52
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:03,125
I will be coming to your town very soon.

53
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,750
Sage?

54
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,833
Until then, you must all be careful.

55
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,167
Chef, check your list.

56
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,042
Driver, are you kidding?

57
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,375
My aunt isn't feeling well. She might pass away any day.

58
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,833
I want to visit my hometown.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,208
Just another 2 or 3 days.

60
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,458
Then the owners of the palace will be here. - I know.

61
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,750
You'll say so and go on leave for 10 days.

62
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,208
She raised me.

63
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,833
If I'm not by her side, when she breathes her last

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,333
what will my family think of me?

65
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,792
I'll just run away without informing you.

66
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,083
Then you just have to find another cook.

67
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,250
Keep grumbling like this.

68
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,042
It's time to drink. Make 2 omelets for me.

69
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,625
What a drunkard! I wonder why he was hired!

70
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,500
<i>I thought I saw someone standing over there.</i>

71
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,208
<i>Why a power failure at this hour?</i>

72
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,458
Who is it?

73
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:56,958
Who is it?

74
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,208
Who is there?

75
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,875
Tell me, who's there?

76
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,917
Who's there?

77
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,750
Why are you crying?

78
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,500
W-Who?

79
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,958
Oh no! Ghost!

80
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,000
Who is closing the door?

81
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,333
Open it. Open the door.

82
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,083
Oh God! Save me!

83
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,500
Someone, please save me.

84
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,333
You drunkard!

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,042
Come and save me.

86
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,875
Come here and open the door.

87
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,250
What are you doing?

88
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,375
Look behind you!

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,417
Ghost!

90
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,333
Easwari?

91
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,042
Easwari!

92
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,958
Eas.. Move.

93
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:15,042
Brother, I'm here. - Easwari, come.

94
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,333
Good day. How do you do?

95
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,333
This is my son. - Greetings.

96
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,208
What happened to your loin cloth?

97
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,583
It slipped off in the crowd.

98
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,708
Give that to me.

99
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,083
My husband's loin cloth is inside, find it and wear it.

100
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,125
He's blissfully unaware that he has lost his loin cloth!

101
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,375
How did you live with him for all these years?

102
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,250
Look here, I'm not your servant that you'd talk to me like this.

103
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,292
I'm the son-in-law of this palace.

104
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,542
Treat me with respect or I'll leave right now. - No.

105
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,667
Don't get angry. I'm so glad you came.

106
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,958
Really? - Oh yes!

107
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,250
That's my brother-in-law!

108
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,083
'No matter where you go, I'll hunt you down and kill you.'

109
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,000
'Hey! Don't come looking for me'

110
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,000
'If I ever see you I'll kill you.'

111
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,958
Welcome!

112
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,125
My sister's engagement is going to be held this Sunday.

113
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,625
You must attend it without fail.

114
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,208
We will, for sure.

115
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,250
Who is this 'kulfi' ice cream?

116
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,708
What are you looking at? She's my daughter.

117
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,167
She has just come back after finishing her studies.

118
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,042
Don't embarrass us here. Shut up. - Be quiet.

119
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,625
My son is finally doing something worthwhile.

120
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,958
If he somehow charms her

121
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,125
my brother's share will completely be ours.

122
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,917
He has only one daughter.

123
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,750
Don't worry, I'll get her.

124
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,458
Hasn't the older heir's son arrived from Mumbai?

125
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,708
He's newly married.

126
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,792
He's taking his sweet time showing his wife all the places on the way.

127
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,375
Romance on the road!

128
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,042
"Knife-edged glance! Your eyes are as sharp as a needle."

129
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,500
"Don't pierce my heart!"

130
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:20,042
"Back to your home town, love."

131
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:24,042
"Don't pinch or tease me now."

132
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,792
"Oh yeah, whatever you say is right!"

133
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,958
"Thank you.. Thank you, my love!"

134
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,250
"Thank you.. Thank you, my love!"

135
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,333
"My girl!"

136
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:35,333
"As far as the eyes can see blissful with a capital B.."

137
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:43,083
"As far as the eyes can see blissful with a capital B.."

138
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:47,250
"River with anklets adorned ripples its way singing a song."

139
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,375
"Even without the air conditioner the margosa tree's breeze is cool."

140
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:59,583
"Even if no pizza or burger steamed 'puttu' is a tasty appetizer."

141
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:07,042
"Our minds can fly fancy-free beyond barriers beautifully."

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,667
"Oh yeah, whatever you say is right!"

143
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,167
"Thank you.. Thank you, my love!"

144
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,708
"Thank you.. Thank you, my love!"

145
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,958
"When wind huffing and puffing blows floral fragrance faithfully follows."

146
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,000
"Yellow myna on seeing me nods its head from the hedge gaily."

147
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,250
"Grandparents' bedtime stories are stored in our hearts as memories."

148
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,125
"Even if we leave our native land our soul belongs to this sand."

149
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,333
"Let 100 years pass by."

150
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:25,958
"Visiting our place of birth where there is, 24x7 Heaven on Earth."

151
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,250
"Oh yeah, whatever you say is right!"

152
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:35,042
"Thank you.. Thank you, my love!"

153
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,542
"Thank you.. Thank you, my love!"

154
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:54,875
Wow! - How do you like the palace? - Fantastic!

155
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,625
Didn't I tell you that you'd be amazed?

156
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,917
You haven't met my relatives as yet.

157
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,292
Wait and watch!

158
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,167
Welcome, dear.

159
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,667
Welcome. - How are you, uncle? - Are you done with your sight-seeing?

160
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,833
Come, Murali. - Come.

161
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,708
Welcome! Do you remember me?

162
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,333
Aunt Easwari! - The one who eloped when she was young!

163
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
We've come back now. Why bring it up?

164
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,042
Come inside. - Step in.

165
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,250
Thanks a lot, Murali.

166
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,083
You came as soon as I called to solve my financial crisis.

167
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,250
Your father would have never let us sell this place.

168
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:25,042
This place has been locked up and not used by anyone, uncle.

169
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,083
At least it would come handy in solving your problems.

170
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,167
Why didn't you come yesterday?

171
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,583
Did you eat?

172
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,125
Shall I get you something to eat?

173
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,625
Okay, I'll listen to all that you say.

174
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:42,750
My mother will scold me.

175
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,500
Who are you talking to, baby?

176
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,375
Going now? - She's my daughter. She's slightly retarded.

177
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,208
Will you come back at night?

178
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,500
Bring me something.

179
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,375
Hey, Maya! - Hi!

180
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,458
Did you look around our town?

181
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,625
How is it? - It's superb!

182
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,833
And this palace is extraordinary.

183
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,083
Grandma suffers from breathing trouble.

184
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,917
Why don't you dial 108 for an ambulance?

185
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,083
When I do, they tell me not to call a million times and harass them.

186
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,792
They say, they feel like they are making school trips.

187
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,500
Only the ambulance's tires are wearing out.

188
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,292
Grandma isn't dying.

189
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,958
Just dump her under a tree near the hospital premises.

190
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,583
When she's about to die, she can go straight to the mortuary.

191
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,917
Grandma!

192
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,250
Hello, Paalsamy!

193
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,750
You're already here!

194
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:14,125
I thought I'd send for you once she becomes a corpse.

195
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,083
But you've come ahead of time.

196
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,292
Who cares if your grandma is alive or dead?

197
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,167
We need interest.

198
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,292
If we don't pay up

199
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,250
you'll even take our briefs away.

200
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,000
You've taken up loans from the entire town, Paalsamy.

201
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,750
I feel so bad, seeing you humiliated.

202
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,083
What else do I do? I have no choice

203
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,583
as I was born into a family of beggars.

204
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,292
You belong to a landlord's family, Paalsamy.

205
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,125
Here is the proof.

206
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:44,625
The man standing next to me in the photo is your grandpa.

207
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,333
He wasn't an ordinary man.

208
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,583
Was he the grandpa like actor Kamal in 'Indian'?

209
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,792
No, he's the landlord of Poovapatti

210
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,917
What? Landlord? - Yes.

211
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,958
Even a counselor's wife walks around, decked in jewelry.

212
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,458
You claim to be a landlord's wife!

213
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,917
And you don't even possess a good blanket.

214
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,125
I wasn't his wife. - Then?

215
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,833
I was his mistress.

216
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,292
This photo isn't your only secret.

217
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,292
You've hidden the landlord himself.

218
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,583
Why are you telling me about your affair now?

219
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,125
He liked me when I was young and secretly got married to me.

220
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,125
That is when we clicked this picture.

221
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:21,042
The other copy is in his palace.

222
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,583
Why are you sharing these flashbacks now?

223
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,250
I kept quiet because I didn't want to ruin his reputation.

224
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,958
But now they're planning to sell the palace, my boy.

225
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,750
If you show them this photo and prove you're also an heir

226
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,833
then you'll get a share of the profit as a grandson.

227
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,875
It's worth millions.

228
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,208
Millions? What are you saying?

229
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,458
Is this really the landlord of Poovapatti?

230
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,792
He looks as dark as night. Let me see him in the light.

231
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:53,292
Landlord grandpa!

232
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,000
Grandpa

233
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,750
Oh no! Grandpa's gone.

234
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,917
Grandma is dead too.

235
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,958
Grandma!

236
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,167
Unfortunately, I destroyed the proof you gave me.

237
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,042
How will I prove I'm the heir, grandma?

238
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,917
All your hard work has gone to waste!

239
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,250
Don't worry, Paalsamy.

240
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:24,333
Your grandma said there was another copy at the palace.

241
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,667
Prove your lineage with that.

242
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,125
Only then will your grandma's soul rest in peace.

243
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:32,875
You're egging me on to get your loan repaid!

244
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,458
Even if not for you

245
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,875
I'll ask for justice for my grandma.

246
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,375
Grandma, before the 16th day of the funeral

247
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,292
if I don't get my share, then I'm not all I claim to be!

248
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,042
Is that possible?

249
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,333
This Paalsamy is a bad boy, sir.

250
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,125
It's 11:00 p.m. and this imbecile is missing.

251
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,583
Let him come, I shall give him a piece of my mind.

252
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,375
Oh, God!

253
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,750
Madhavi?

254
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:06,750
Madhavi? - Yes.

255
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:07,958
It's 11:00 p.m.

256
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,417
Aren't you going to bed?

257
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,875
One minute, I'll send this mail and come.

258
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,417
Okay. Come fast.

259
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,958
Shameless man!

260
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,125
Roams around town all night and then comes late to bed.

261
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,417
Why do you look so strange, Easwari?

262
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,958
When did you go to the bathroom?

263
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,083
My stomach has been somersaulting real bad.

264
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,417
For the last half hour I've been in the bathroom.

265
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,500
Half an hour?

266
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,625
Then?

267
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,458
What..

268
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,167
What happened?

269
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,708
I felt as if someone was lying down next to me.

270
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,292
Who else will dare to do that other than me?

271
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,958
You froze out of fear!

272
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,583
Go to bed.

273
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,042
Hurry up.

274
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,333
Who are you?

275
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,417
What do you want?

276
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:58,667
Even if you get a 10% share you'll be a millionaire, boss.

277
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,000
Why are you suddenly calling me 'boss'? - Of course.

278
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,833
If you want you can lend us money!

279
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,708
Boss! - 'Boss' sounds nice.

280
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,125
There's something mumbo jumbo about this place.

281
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,333
What?

282
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
They always throw away things that are obsolete.

283
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:21,333
My grandma was obsolete but wasn't useless.

284
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,792
She wasn't an ordinary lady.

285
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,750
She was the mistress, boss.

286
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,792
Why do you look like an owl with a heart attack?

287
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,000
Look there, boss.

288
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,583
Oh my!

289
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,708
She looks like a boiled egg peeled, shining bright and white.

290
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,875
Who is she?

291
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:51,792
Who cares who she is? Poor thing, she's sweating!

292
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,292
With my loin cloth, shall I offer to wipe her beads of sweat?

293
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,417
You think, she'd die of a heart attack because of the odor?

294
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:04,417
Boss, she has a tiny mole on her hip.

295
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,500
If I ask you to teach the kids at home

296
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:12,125
you cook up excuses of short-sightedness.

297
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:16,750
We are 500 feet away and you spot the tiniest mole accurately.

298
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:22,250
Who is he? He's springing up like a mushroom.

299
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:23,917
Must be a thief, boss.

300
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,708
He has probably come to steal.

301
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,667
What the heck? How dare he?!

302
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,417
It's my grandma's labor of love!

303
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,333
I will get him and.. - He's picking up a stone, boss!

304
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,708
Who is it?

305
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,750
He seems to be faster than me. - Boss..

306
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,208
He's playing with pebbles.

307
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,375
Is she a pond to throw pebbles at?

308
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,125
Give me a stick. I'll hit that mushroom head.

309
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,125
Follow me.

310
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,458
Where did he go?

311
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,625
He must be right under. - Hey!

312
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:06,375
Come out! Look for him.

313
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:08,792
Hey! Stop! Who are you?

314
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,500
We came to click pictures.

315
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,750
Photo? You creeps!

316
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,042
Wait till I catch you! - Run!

317
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,708
Run! - Rascals, wait!

318
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
This is the dead end.

319
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,292
Boiled egg! - Listen to me.

320
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,750
You.. - Let me jump over this side.

321
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,708
Wait for me. I'm coming.

322
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,625
Thief!

323
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,458
Thief!

324
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:33,167
Thief!

325
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,958
Thief! - If you hold someone like this

326
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,000
he won't try to escape even if he's really a thief.

327
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,958
Come! - Thief, yes! I'm a thief.

328
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,250
I won't let you go. You're trapped.

329
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,750
Don't let me go. Please don't.

330
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:49,125
Excuse me, we are the main thieves.

331
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,625
We'll be the witness. - No! I'm the boss.

332
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:54,000
Hold me tight. - So, you're the main culprits!

333
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,375
You're dead meat.

334
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,375
Thief! -Don't let me go.

335
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,667
Hold me real tight. Like you held him.

336
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,417
'Their shoulders are sagging like pillow covers.'

337
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,083
'And they're falling all over her.'

338
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,583
There you go. - What happened?

339
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,500
Who are they?

340
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,375
They came to steal and got caught.

341
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,458
Do we look like thieves?

342
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:15,833
I wanted to know if I could be a cook here, master.

343
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,667
Master? - Yes. - That's me.

344
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:22,208
Shut up! - Only you should have come for the job.

345
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,292
Why bring these two accompaniments along?

346
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:26,458
I make the gravy.

347
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,458
They add the onions and garlic into it.

348
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,958
How will they assist? By flinging stones at me! - No.

349
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,125
That wasn't us.

350
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,792
There was a head like a mushroom here.

351
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,125
You've got the job. Why rake up all that?

352
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,292
Who are these people?

353
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,167
They are the new cooks I have recruited.

354
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,958
We'll be here for only a few days.

355
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,417
As soon as we register the property in Ayyanar's name

356
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,000
we'll go our ways.

357
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,458
Why do we need a new cook?

358
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,958
My brother-in-law has hired you.

359
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,375
Start your work in the kitchen.

360
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,667
Okay, the man in safari suit.

361
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:22,250
I need to test your culinary skills. Cook something for me.

362
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,458
What do you want?

363
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:27,333
Chicken curry, fish fry minced mutton, minced egg.

364
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,250
Crab soup, turkey roast and prawn masala.

365
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,583
This is the menu for lunch now.

366
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:34,042
I'll think about what you have to cook tonight.

367
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,542
Let's go in, dear.

368
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,792
Now do you realize, why they are selling the palace?

369
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,375
Before they finish eating

370
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,875
let us find the picture and rake in our share.

371
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:44,750
Wait, sister!

372
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,417
I won't let you go.

373
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,750
Who are you chasing? - My elder sister.

374
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:52,958
Poor kiddo!

375
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,250
Why don't you get her treated?

376
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,417
We've tried everything, sir.

377
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,000
Nothing has worked. How much can I spend?

378
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:03,292
Come, try to catch me. You can't.

379
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,292
Run!

380
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,708
Is he hurt badly? How is he now?

381
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,333
Doctor is attending to him now.

382
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,000
Why are you scrutinizing me like the fuel gauge in a gas station?

383
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,792
You smart ass! What are you doing here?

384
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,667
The old cook left all of a sudden.

385
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,125
He came asking for a job as a cook.

386
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,875
We decided to employ him, as it's for a few days.

387
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:53,333
He's reformed now.

388
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:03,792
Ms. Easwari.. Why are you standing all around me?

389
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,625
Master, what happened to me?

390
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,167
That's what we want to know.

391
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,167
You're addressing me as if you work for me.

392
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,667
What happened to you?

393
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:16,208
Ms. Easwari, I'm seeing you in a sari for the very first time.

394
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,417
You look as beautiful as Goddess Mahalakshmi!

395
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:23,375
He calls her beautiful when she looks like a frizzy haired Chinese film villain.

396
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,625
He has forgotten recent events because of the hard knock. - No.

397
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,667
Looks like he has a total memory loss.

398
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,417
He has gone 25 years behind.

399
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,708
He'll get better eventually.

400
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,375
You don't need to spend on medication.

401
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,875
He'll recover on his own slowly.

402
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:41,583
Ms. Easwari! I'm completely alright.

403
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,292
Go and take rest. I'll get back to work.

404
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,417
I'm your wife. We are married.

405
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:51,833
You may like me but don't raise your voice like this.

406
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,958
If your brother hears this, our love affair will leak, right?

407
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:57,000
He has just now fallen in love, boss.

408
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,958
Looks like he'll become a father in 2040.

409
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:04,000
People usually forget the past if they bang their heads.

410
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,458
This man has forgotten the present too!

411
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,667
They say drumstick is an aphrodisiac.

412
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,667
Here, the drumstick itself is in a romantic mood!

413
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:18,542
We can get the registration done tomorrow. I'll pay you soon.

414
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,042
Don't we know about you?

415
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:23,167
If you give me the parent document I can do all the ground work.

416
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,167
Maya, give me the documents.

417
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,125
Oh, God!

418
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,750
Why is Maya screaming?

419
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,000
Maya, what happened? Why did you scream?

420
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,292
What just happened? - How did this happen?

421
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,458
I don't know.

422
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,125
The wardrobe was filled with water.

423
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:05,208
The pipeline is broken on top. That's how it must have leaked.

424
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,208
Oh no! The papers are now wet and ruined.

425
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,375
What do we do now?

426
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,250
It might take a few weeks to organize the new set of documents.

427
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,583
If you want, you can go home.

428
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,833
We'll get it ready by then.

429
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,667
We can't keep travelling back and forth.

430
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,625
Son, I know a lot of people in the registrar's office.

431
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,833
If I go there in person, I can get it done in 2 days.

432
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,917
It makes sense to finish the work and go.

433
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,833
That's right. Let's go.

434
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:32,750
Do you have to go?

435
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,958
Yes, if we finish it quickly, we can go home soon.

436
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,292
Why?

437
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,292
I'm a little terrified by the things happening here.

438
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,708
Are you scared? - Please stay with me.

439
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:45,125
There are so many people here. I'll be back in just 2 days.

440
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:47,333
Until then, don't confuse yourself by letting your imagination run.

441
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,042
Relax! Okay?

442
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,750
I had to go to Tirunelveli, urgently.

443
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:51,958
So, I wasn't able to invite everyone.

444
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,042
But you must attend my sister's engagement.

445
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,958
We'll come for sure with the whole family. - Thanks.

446
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,792
You attend to the paperwork. - Shall we leave?

447
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,333
Let's go.

448
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,250
Come, onion and garlic.

449
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,958
Did you check out all the stuff in every nook and corner here?

450
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,250
Boss, Maya lives in the second room on the left of the first floor.

451
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,458
Madhavi in the first room

452
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,292
and Easwari is in the room towards the right.

453
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,167
What about the maid? - She sleeps in the courtyard.

454
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,167
I asked for the picture and you come up with

455
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,417
the locations where women sleep!

456
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,708
My future life lies in my grandma's history.

457
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:50,167
It's the only proof of my lineage.

458
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,042
We must find it somehow.

459
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,500
Why are you jabbering continuously? Go to bed.

460
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:55,917
Looks like your face has lost a few kilos.

461
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,125
I've trimmed my moustache, no?

462
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,208
So why are you lying outside here with us?

463
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,833
Moron! I'm not your employer.

464
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,042
I'm just another employee like you. - Hey!

465
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,583
After his head injury, you know he's half a lunatic.

466
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,042
Is that why he trimmed his moustache to look young?

467
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,958
You call him young? You junk head..

468
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,000
Hey! Go to sleep.

469
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:18,167
"Here is milk and fruits.. Oh, my beloved.."

470
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,667
Easwari, I am back.

471
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,042
Usually people go bonkers after they fall in love.

472
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,000
His case seems topsy-turvy!

473
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:27,292
Let's get to work. - Okay, boss.

474
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,250
Easwari? Easu..

475
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,417
Easu.. - What is it?

476
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:33,333
I have got you flavored milk, your favorite drink.

477
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:36,125
This is called 'midnight masala'.

478
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,167
One who suffers from jaundice sees the world yellow.

479
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,333
To a lunatic, everything seems like a loony bin!

480
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:42,917
I don't want any milk. Go back to bed.

481
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,750
Easwari! - What is it?

482
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,375
If you don't drink this milk, I'll slit my own throat.

483
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,542
I'll drink that darn milk.

484
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:52,958
Drink it up fast.

485
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,042
Baby corn soup is also waiting!

486
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,708
What happened? - It has no sugar.

487
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:00,250
Give it to me. It seems sweet enough.

488
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:03,042
Idiot! My lips touched it, right?

489
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,250
That's why it tastes sweet to you.

490
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:07,583
Add some sugar to it. I'll drink it.

491
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,292
If I get caught up with this nutcase I'll have a sleepless tonight!

492
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,292
Escape! - Here!

493
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,250
Boss?

494
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:24,417
Master! Forgive us.

495
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,542
I'm not a thief anymore.

496
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,375
I've reformed, master.

497
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,375
Master?

498
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:33,000
The landlord must have gone astray.

499
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:36,625
I'm also a product of his labor of love!

500
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,458
I swear, master. This is the whole truth.

501
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,833
Trust me.

502
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,167
Why are you punishing yourself for my grandpa's evil deeds?

503
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,875
Even employees own side businesses.

504
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:50,667
What is wrong about it if my grandma was his mistress?

505
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,250
Boss, one minute.

506
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,917
He's turning him around like a remote controlled car.

507
00:35:56,583 --> 00:36:00,083
He seems to be sleepwalking, boss.

508
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,000
How sad?

509
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,083
This is a lucky disease.

510
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,708
Sleepwalkers won't get diabetes at all, boss.

511
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,292
Really? - Yes.

512
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,583
Those who walk for 2 kilometers never suffer from high blood sugar.

513
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,583
How will someone who walks all night ever suffer from diabetes?

514
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:16,417
If I punch you, your nose will bleed.

515
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,542
Go, look for the picture.

516
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:23,583
At this hour, whom are you playing 'hide and seek' with?

517
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,583
With my husband of course.

518
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,958
He's all lovey-dovey at odd times.

519
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,625
I can't even go to the bathroom.

520
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:36,042
He drew my face with a chalk on the bathroom wall

521
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,917
wrote 'I love you' and ran away.

522
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:42,667
That ugly face like a slit open watermelon was yours, isn't it?

523
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,750
Dad?

524
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,833
Dad! - How come you are awake at this hour?

525
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,292
I was searching for my dad. - We have so much in common.

526
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,917
You're searching for your dad. I'm searching for my mom.

527
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:56,292
My son is wooing her with such classical poetry.

528
00:36:56,458 --> 00:37:00,250
For the first time, I'm seeing a mother gloating over her son's flirting skills.

529
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,542
Dad? - Maya, one minute.

530
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,292
Instead of looking for our parents

531
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,083
shall we talk about when we should become parents? - Idiot!

532
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:12,833
That slap will make your son get epileptic fits!

533
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,375
And you're laughing like a maniac here.

534
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:18,042
He takes after his dad in getting slapped. - Be careful!

535
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:22,042
Uncle, warn him. He's behaving badly.

536
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,542
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

537
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,375
Who are you, my boy? Are you related to the landlord?

538
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,583
Get lost!

539
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,875
He's asking his own son if he's related to him.

540
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,250
Your husband has lost it.

541
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Easu?

542
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,333
He's hounding me like a sniffer dog now.

543
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,417
Let me scoot. - Why push me?

544
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:44,625
This sapped Sapota must have been the landlord's stooge.

545
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:48,000
If I tap him on the right spot I'll get all the details on the dot.

546
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,250
You seem to be drooling all over Easwari of late.

547
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,375
Between Easwari and me..

548
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:54,750
Is there a canal flowing?

549
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:56,250
No love..

550
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,250
What if master gets to know? - No.

551
00:37:58,417 --> 00:37:59,625
He'll kill me if he gets to know.

552
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,417
Shall I tell him? - Please don't!

553
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,375
If you don't want this affair to be leaked

554
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:06,042
you must open up about what I want to know. - What?

555
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,708
Where did the old landlord keep his most important stuff?

556
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,500
In a box under the neck of the wild buffalo upstairs.

557
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,958
That buffalo has given custody of his secrets to his own breed!

558
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll go right now. - Wait!

559
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,833
What? - Suggest me

560
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
an idea, as to how to make Easwari my mine.

561
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,292
Rape her and they will get her married to you!

562
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,583
Will that work? - You may find it difficult.

563
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,208
I don't mean rape, I mean the wedding.

564
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,833
If this can work, all that will automatically follow.

565
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,750
There are so many photos here as if it's a studio.

566
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:41,333
He has kept so many items in this box just like your grandma.

567
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,667
Does that give you the right to call my grandma a tart?

568
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,292
Buffalo! Shut up and search.

569
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,042
Boss, I found it.

570
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,542
Let me see.

571
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:52,667
This doesn't look like my grandmother.

572
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,542
She is my grandma, not yours.

573
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,250
Was your grandma a mistress too?

574
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:58,667
That's how it seems.

575
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,833
So do we both share the same grandpa?

576
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,250
Get lost, you moron.

577
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,667
Grandpa it seems!

578
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,000
He's collected quite a harem.

579
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,500
If we dig too deep, the whole town will stake a claim.

580
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,667
Then if we split the palace we won't even get a brick!

581
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,042
Will all our labor go to waste, boss?

582
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:17,125
It was our grandmothers' labor of love, squared!

583
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,875
Forgive me, Easwari.

584
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:31,000
Only if I rape you, will I be able to wipe out your brother's arrogance.

585
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,333
'What is he looking at? That doll is turning him on.'

586
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,042
I rolled a four. It's your turn now.

587
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,250
Dear..

588
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:52,167
Who are you playing with? - My sister of course.

589
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,583
Sister?

590
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:54,958
I can't see anyone.

591
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,708
You mad fellow! She's right in front of me.

592
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,042
You're mad, and you calling me mad!

593
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,417
Ask your invisible sister to roll a dice now.

594
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,417
Sister, please play!

595
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,792
Why is he running like he has been operated with a rusted blade?

596
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,042
What happened?

597
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,417
What was that scream? - Sir..

598
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,708
Master, it's our boy.

599
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,833
He'll be petrified even by a small hole.

600
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,333
He saw this palace and got scared out of his wits.

601
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:56,208
Why are you standing around in your underwear?

602
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,542
How do I..

603
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,375
Easwari.. What happened?

604
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,875
How do I explain this?

605
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,042
Forgive me, master. - Yes.

606
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:08,167
I desire to get married to your sister. Therefore, I tried to rape her

607
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,500
so that nothing can stop us. Nothing happened.

608
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:15,167
Hey! - He's my husband now. - He's not your husband.

609
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,875
He's a servant in this house.

610
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:20,833
Now I know how he lured you.

611
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,375
I didn't get a chance to do this, 25 years ago.

612
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,625
Now I've got it.

613
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,000
Rukku? - What?

614
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,958
All kinds of strange incidents are happening in this house. - So?

615
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,583
Don't sleep alone.

616
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,042
I'll keep your company.

617
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,042
Find someone else, you drunkard! - Go.

618
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,292
I'll get you someday.

619
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,208
Oh, you! What?

620
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,792
Sister has called for you.

621
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,375
Sister? Or mother?

622
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:51,042
Sister. - Mad girl!

623
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,958
She has got her mother and sister mixed up.

624
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,167
As long as my job gets done, it's fine!

625
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,167
Rukku?

626
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:03,750
Rukku!

627
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:08,292
Where did she go after calling me over?

628
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,500
She's faster than me.

629
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,583
You took a shower and got ready!

630
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,625
Rukku, do you think I can't find you if you hide?

631
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,250
I'll come and get you.

632
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,125
Who is it? Who is there?

633
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:48,167
Swamy?

634
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,042
Swamy! Where are you?

635
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,458
Raj, where's the driver?

636
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,792
I'm also looking for him. He's nowhere to be seen.

637
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,458
I told Ayyanar not to hire drunkards.

638
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:01,375
Who knows where he has passed out?

639
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,958
The procession will start by the time he comes.

640
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,000
You all leave. - Aren't you coming?

641
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,833
No, dear, I got some work in town.

642
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'll finish it and then join you.

643
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,792
I've informed the temple trustee.

644
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:12,250
He will take good care of you.

645
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,917
What is so special today, sir? - This..

646
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,833
Friday, on the new moon day

647
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,250
the solar eclipse starts early in the morning.

648
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,500
It's a very bad omen.

649
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:25,000
Even if it's 150 years old the malefic effects will

650
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:27,875
affect even our goddess!

651
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:31,000
So, to negate the bad effect all the villages join

652
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,833
to take a procession of the 8 goddesses

653
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:37,500
on the day of solar eclipse and cleanse all the idols in the river.

654
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:40,458
As a result, the malefic effect is erased. It is a traditional belief.

655
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,667
Today our village goddess shall go.

656
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,292
<i>Salutations to You! O Narayani..</i>

657
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:49,417
<i>Who is complete with all auspicious attributes..</i>

658
00:44:56,333 --> 00:45:03,000
<i>Giver of refuge with 3 eyes and a shining face, salutations!</i>

659
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,417
Hi!

660
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,250
Aunt? - What is it?

661
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:37,875
A chap over there is throwing flowers at me.

662
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,750
Who? Is it the sixth palanquin bearer?

663
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:44,000
How did you guess so correctly?

664
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,542
He targeted me even before you. - What?

665
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,833
Threw a flower at you!

666
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,542
Why? What do I lack?

667
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:53,292
Maybe you're just a few inches taller.

668
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,625
Aunt, he has picked up another flower.

669
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,250
Look at my man's skill!

670
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:10,000
You should attend the festival, carry the palanquin

671
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,417
and leave without making any trouble.

672
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:16,083
You shouldn't throw flowers on girls and play with them.

673
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,292
Who are you to tell me?

674
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,917
Shall we leave? - Yes, let's go.

675
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:21,458
Her boyfriend. - Does the girl know that?

676
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,583
I have just started flirting with her.

677
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,792
It'll take some time to fall into bed.

678
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:33,125
Brother said he'd bring the jeep here, I can't find him.

679
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,125
This chap? - Where is he?

680
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,375
Aunt, look behind.

681
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,708
Just some extra flab of cholesterol! - Aunt!

682
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,333
Look behind!

683
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,458
Why does he keep hounding us?

684
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,333
Let's get out of here fast.

685
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:51,000
If a fair and adorable woman, who looks like a bunny rabbit walks

686
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,083
men are bound to get smitten.

687
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,750
That's not his fault.

688
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,750
It's my fault. I was born beautiful.

689
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,625
Don't you think this is slightly over the top? - What?

690
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:00,750
I don't understand a word. - What can

691
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:04,000
I really say? Look behind.

692
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,333
He's following only me.

693
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:08,208
Come fast.

694
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,083
He's taking a picture on his cell phone.

695
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,542
He seems to be getting turned on, looking at our backs.

696
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,792
Cover yourselves up.

697
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,917
He's following us whichever alley we go to!

698
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:23,417
Look there! My Lord!

699
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:25,625
My sweetheart!

700
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,750
Eas.. - How could you throw flowers at us?

701
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:32,833
Now look! I'll throw flowers back at you.

702
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,125
He's staring. If you're really brave, fling it

703
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:37,333
back at me now. - Easu..

704
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,292
Stop calling me 'Easu'.

705
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:42,667
Throw your stick in such a way that his ribs

706
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,292
fall apart. - You're rattling without realizing that

707
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:47,292
I'm not holding this stick to fight.

708
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,417
But to support myself.

709
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:54,792
I was this brave lion and he made me lean like this.

710
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:03,333
He'll aim a single flower at the hip, like bull's eye!

711
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,625
Imagine what he'll do with a string of them now!

712
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,958
Aunt, we're in a safe place.

713
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,750
Even if my spouse is weak co-travelers are in no way meek.

714
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:19,750
Our time is good.

715
00:48:19,917 --> 00:48:22,375
Mister, slap him real hard.

716
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,583
Come on, attack!

717
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,000
Take off your jewelry and give them to me.

718
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,167
Be brave, aunt.

719
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,000
Nothing will happen to us. Not only our jewelry

720
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:34,458
they can't even touch the tip of our nails! - Do you know

721
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,500
martial arts? - Just wait and watch!

722
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,875
What happened just now? - What were you looking at?

723
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:47,542
When there's a fight, you must pay attention.

724
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:50,583
Focus on every single movement of the body.

725
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,667
Give her the stick - And then?

726
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,250
First, give it to her. - Yes.

727
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:57,667
One punch on his face.

728
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:01,042
Twist his hand.

729
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:05,167
You should have seen how he grabbed his neck

730
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:11,708
and spun him around in circles and threw him in mid-air.

731
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,833
Instead of thinking how how to attack others

732
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,417
we must now plan how to defend ourselves.

733
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,667
Let's rush from here.

734
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,833
What happened?

735
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,458
You already got into a fight, son-in-law!

736
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:28,667
No, it's not that.. - Is he your son-in-law?

737
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:30,625
He's Madhavi's brother.

738
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:31,833
Brother?

739
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,625
Yes, he's a lawyer at the High Court.

740
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:37,750
You don't know him because you didn't attend my wedding.

741
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,458
I'd have told you earlier.

742
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,500
But I thought this would be more fun.

743
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:45,375
I'll urinate, and that's fun to you! - Oh no!

744
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,708
Grandma!

745
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,542
All your hard work has gone waste.

746
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:56,792
I thought I'd get settled for a life with my legacy.

747
00:50:56,958 --> 00:51:00,042
But like a mongrel let loose, my landlord-grandpa

748
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,208
has had multiple flings to last him a lifetime.

749
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,042
I better stick to loans and spend my days without dreams. - Boss!

750
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,250
Boss! Chicken curry is ready!

751
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,333
If we make the soup we're all set for lunch.

752
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,833
He is really living the role of a cook instead of faking it.

753
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:18,875
Why are you dull, boss? - I need to powder my face.

754
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,458
You camphor nosed fella!

755
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:25,625
No picture, no share, the chap who came with me is missing.

756
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,042
Are you bothered about any of this?

757
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,208
So what if you don't find a proof?

758
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,167
You'll definitely get a share in the property.

759
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,333
But you must listen to all that I say.

760
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,667
Only today, I have heard wise words

761
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,875
from your dented mouth.

762
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:46,083
Boss, you know that the head turning, heart breaking, glam doll Maya?

763
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,792
If you woo her and trap her, you'll get a share for sure.

764
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:55,500
Why do you confuse conjugal rights with the 64 poses in 'Kamasutra'?

765
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:56,667
Take your leg off me!

766
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,625
Sorry, boss. I went a little overboard.

767
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:00,292
How's my idea?

768
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,167
Sounds like a good plan.

769
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,292
But I'm like some leftover rice. She's a burger.

770
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,458
Can the two mix?

771
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,250
An elephant will never knows its own strength, boss.

772
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,417
Does a cat know it then?

773
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,417
Not that. Look at her complexion, height and personality.

774
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:16,542
You are the only perfect match for her.

775
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,042
It will work out, boss.

776
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,583
Take care. - Thank you.

777
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,667
A match made in heaven.

778
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,583
I am the right match for her complexion, height

779
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,500
weight and personality.

780
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:29,708
I didn't mean you.

781
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,167
Look there.

782
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:35,042
Who is he?

783
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:37,000
Looks like Undertaker's brother.

784
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,417
Paalsamy, I'm tired. Get me some coffee.

785
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:40,583
Come in.

786
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,500
Are you the cook? Is there anything to eat?

787
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,625
There's 'Khushboo Idly', soft and spongy, want some?

788
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:48,458
Who are you? A relative?

789
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,708
No exclusive!

790
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,250
Why are you standing here? Come inside, son-in-law.

791
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:54,625
Sir, is he your son-in-law?

792
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:57,458
We know the boy well.

793
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:00,042
He's Madhavi's brother.

794
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,833
I thought he was engaged to Maya.

795
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,583
That's a good thought.

796
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:08,500
If their chemistry works out, maybe we can fix them up.

797
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:12,958
Paalsamy, you and your wretched tongue!

798
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:15,625
You're egging on my reticent brother.

799
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:19,250
Why are you talking so loudly like a bike with a faulty silencer?

800
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:23,833
I wanted to get my son married to my brother's daughter.

801
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,917
You poured acid on my aspirations!

802
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,500
How will I fulfill my dream?

803
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,833
He'll dish up tomato rice and you can fulfill your wish-list. Go.

804
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,125
Boss, competition is heating up now.

805
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,375
One is a six footer and the other one is a short guy.

806
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,542
What will you do?

807
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:40,250
No matter who's here to get her, that chick is mine.

808
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,458
Paalsamy is a bad boy!

809
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:48,667
Ravi, you've come all the way from Chennai, for the case in Madurai.

810
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,917
Is that case so important?

811
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:53,458
It's an important client's case and they adjourned it for next month.

812
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,375
Meanwhile, you called and here I am.

813
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,625
Massive palace! Looks magnificent.

814
00:53:58,792 --> 00:53:59,833
Scary too!

815
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,333
I have no clue what's wrong here.

816
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:07,292
Do you believe in spirits?

817
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,042
As in liquor!

818
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,250
I knew you would ridicule me!

819
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,250
I meant ghost.

820
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,583
Maya has also felt its presence.

821
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:21,417
She's used to living in a small space with 100 flats bunched together.

822
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,333
This is one sprawling palace that measure's up to 100 acres.

823
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,083
That too, it's so quiet.

824
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,125
The smallest sound will be terrifying.

825
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,833
Madhavi, what's wrong?

826
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,958
I don't mind if anything happens to me.

827
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:39,708
But I don't want my husband to get hurt.

828
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:42,167
Don't trouble yourself with such negative thoughts.

829
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,625
Ravi, do you remember the two wheeler accident

830
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,833
during my engagement? - Yes.

831
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:50,625
I never told you this.

832
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:54,042
All the doctors we consulted told I could never conceive.

833
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:58,625
He knew it and still married me.

834
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:04,000
I've consulted all the best doctors to conceive a baby for him.

835
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:08,417
Even before coming here I went through some tests.

836
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:11,417
I'm tense as I want the results to be positive.

837
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:14,333
But the ambience here is scary.

838
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:18,458
The worse thing is, as the registration has got delayed, and we can't leave.

839
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:20,958
He thinks my fears are baseless.

840
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,458
How can an educated girl like you be so silly?

841
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:27,708
Till you leave, I'll be here with you and prove your fears are false.

842
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:30,583
I'm here for you. Stop worrying.

843
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,208
What, dear?

844
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,417
Behind you..

845
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,042
I can't see anything.

846
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,167
I saw it.

847
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,750
You're really upset. Go and take rest.

848
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:54,375
Listen to me, dear.

849
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,458
Cops?!

850
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:30,000
Did a man come here claiming to be a lawyer?

851
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,542
Yes, why do you ask?

852
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:32,875
He's not a lawyer. He's an accused.

853
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,458
He hit 5-6 men and they've been hospitalized.

854
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,500
The tall guy is now out of the game.

855
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:38,750
Then what about the short guy?

856
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:41,167
I don't even consider him my competition.

857
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:43,000
He isn't that kind of a man.

858
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:44,167
That's for us to decide.

859
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,792
Call him. We must take him to the station to interrogate.

860
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:48,500
Station! He's not at home.

861
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:49,792
Inspector..

862
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:51,625
One minute.

863
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:55,042
Instead of coming with a team to nab a professional accused

864
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,833
you've come alone, as if you are taking

865
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,583
your due from a street vendor. But don't worry.

866
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,083
The man you want is inside. I'll help you. Come on.

867
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,625
Mr. Lawyer.. Mr. Lawyer?

868
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:07,667
Ms. Maya sprained her back. She wants to see you immediately.

869
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,000
Look how he's on his toes to massage her hip!

870
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,208
Come, sir.

871
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,333
Please come.

872
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,750
Did you get caught?

873
00:57:15,917 --> 00:57:19,625
Inspector, whether you hang him upside down and dunk him into water

874
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,583
or thrash him on the floor.

875
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,458
Do show me a demo first, sir.

876
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:27,208
Why does he hate you so much? - What?

877
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,958
Now he's giving a bear-hug!

878
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:31,625
He's my friend.

879
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,125
Is this how you joke?

880
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:34,625
I was so scared.

881
00:57:35,292 --> 00:57:36,667
What brings you here?

882
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:37,917
It's been 2 months since I got transferred.

883
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,542
You were getting into the jeep at the temple festival.

884
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,042
What are you standing here for?

885
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,333
Go and bring some tea.

886
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,167
Keep an eye on your cook.

887
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:48,458
He's bent on sending you to inferno!

888
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,500
Shift the other eye on that girl.

889
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,583
She defends you to the ends of the earth.

890
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,000
What's up? - Stop building castles!

891
00:57:55,458 --> 00:58:01,458
Paalsamy, I wonder what you have against me.

892
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:05,042
If someone bills the shirt I wanted to buy, how will I feel?

893
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:08,083
I didn't quite get you. - I'm not the cook here as you think.

894
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,417
In a way, this palace belongs to me.

895
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:18,833
Only if I woo Maya I can repay my loans.

896
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Why don't you do it?

897
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:21,458
How can you say it so easily?

898
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:24,208
If she's a local model, I can lure her with Indian sweets.

899
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,542
She's ultra-modern.

900
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,167
I don't even know how to inch my way up to her.

901
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:30,333
Every girl in this world has a weaker side.

902
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,625
Find that out and you can charm her!

903
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:33,708
You're a lawyer. You know it all.

904
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,292
I'm not you, right?

905
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:37,833
Tip me off with a point.

906
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:40,458
That's all? Come with me.

907
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,958
That's weak.

908
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,167
As per the proven formula, all women are frightened of cockroaches.

909
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,458
Maya is in the shower.

910
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,792
Throw it in and she will come out screaming.

911
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:52,250
You'll be standing out.

912
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:55,458
She'll bump into you and it will automatically work.

913
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:59,625
Super idea! But you won't gloat to anyone that it was your idea, right?

914
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:00,875
Of course not.

915
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,125
What are you doing?

916
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:05,000
Taking safety measures before we are in each other's arms and rolling.

917
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,292
I'm adjusting the cot.

918
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:07,458
She'll come out anytime.

919
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:09,250
Go and throw it fast. - Go.

920
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,625
Is the 'fall and roll' trick for you?

921
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:17,250
No. - Why are you so over enthusiastic?

922
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:20,167
Hey, wait!

923
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,750
It has gone under the cot.

924
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:25,458
I thought she'd come out wrapped in a towel.

925
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,792
This roach trapped itself there.

926
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,125
Let's catch it.

927
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,000
She has come out. - Let's hide.

928
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:40,083
Wow! She's like a 'tandoori chicken'

929
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,958
wrapped up in a silver foil.

930
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,708
If only I get her, I'll build a temple for you.

931
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,042
Hunt for the cockroach, I'll keep an eye on her.

932
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:51,833
You'll eye her! - Don't I have to tell you where exactly to put it?

933
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,667
That's right. - So hunt for it.

934
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:08,208
Oh no! Just missed.

935
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,708
She wrapped herself again.

936
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:11,708
Didn't you see that?

937
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,250
Did you?

938
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,500
After using a swab for the ears I should have trashed it.

939
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:19,500
I was so dumb to have kept it inside the ear.

940
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:22,292
After you gave me the idea I should have got rid of you.

941
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:24,208
Go away. - But will you be alone?

942
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,917
Am I planting a bomb in Kashmir to need company?

943
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:28,542
I can handle a cockroach.

944
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,792
If you need help.. Okay. - Go, please go.

945
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,250
What are you doing here?

946
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:44,375
Get down.

947
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:45,958
You're the one on top of me.

948
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:47,125
What's happening?

949
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,583
Oh no! Really heavy!

950
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:54,958
Give that to me

951
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,333
Sorry.

952
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,667
Take it. - Hey!

953
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,750
Hey, stupid!

954
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:15,292
Will you just barge in to serve tea at any odd time?

955
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:20,583
You won't tell what you saw here, right?

956
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,958
He's guilty and I should zip my lips, is it so?

957
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,708
I'm an eye witness to this disgraceful event.

958
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,833
I won't tell. - Do you swear?

959
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
If you don't trust me

960
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:31,333
throw your towel down and I'll swear on it. - Hey!

961
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,917
Is the visual proper?

962
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,333
But why all this?

963
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,417
My sister is scared of something here.

964
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,667
To prove her wrong

965
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,292
I'm fixing cameras around the house.

966
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,000
Madhavi isn't imagining it.

967
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:48,708
I've also sensed someone following me quite a few times.

968
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:53,667
Look properly. It could be your octopus eyed cousin or the cook Paalsamy.

969
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,042
The camera has shifted towards the wall.

970
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,375
Turn a little to the right.

971
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:58,625
Check now.

972
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:06,833
What happened?

973
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:09,250
I thought I saw a figure standing here.

974
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,667
No one is here.

975
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,000
I saw it in the monitor.

976
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,083
You'd have seen one of the dolls here.

977
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,917
I don't know why all of you react so strangely to this place!

978
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:09,167
What are you doing here? - Sister called you.

979
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,875
Who is that? - Ms. Selvi.

980
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:12,667
Shut up and go. Nutcase!

981
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,625
Why are you still standing here?

982
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:40,250
She's not letting me sleep!

983
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:43,250
If you still bother me, I'll kill you.

984
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:46,083
Loony face! Where are you looking?

985
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,375
Baby?

986
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,083
What are you doing here, dear?

987
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,167
She's always here like a half crazed whacko.

988
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,417
Why are you here at this time of the night, sir? - No..

989
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:56,667
I had a splitting headache.

990
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,500
Can you make a cup of coffee for me? - Okay.

991
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,250
Go and lie down next to your mother.

992
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,875
She's a whacko in her head. Ignore her, sir.

993
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,708
Baby, whom were you talking to last night?

994
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,083
To my sister.

995
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:20,333
Madhavi?

996
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:21,792
Maya?

997
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,167
No. - Then?

998
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,917
This is Ms. Selvi.

999
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,458
Where does she stay?

1000
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,708
Right next to you.

1001
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,250
I can't see anyone.

1002
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,667
She's looking right at you.

1003
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,375
Don't you see her?

1004
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,917
How does she look?

1005
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:47,042
Like this.

1006
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,250
Hello. - Welcome.

1007
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,083
Welcome, Ayyanar. He is late for his own sister's engagement.

1008
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,542
I got stuck with work.

1009
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,000
Let's go in.

1010
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:13,167
Where's my husband?

1011
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,292
He said he'd go home, freshen up and come.

1012
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,083
Let us not miss the auspicious time.

1013
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,583
Come soon.

1014
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,708
Move.

1015
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:24,333
We shouldn't be late in serving the food.

1016
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,208
Instead of stringing along Maya, you're stirring the gravy.

1017
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:33,083
Maya wants a groom who is a city boy with a 6 pack.

1018
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,583
He must also possess a loaded bank account.

1019
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:36,208
With many followers on the Facebook..

1020
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,667
He should be superb and must be a singer too.

1021
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,542
How can I fulfill these requirements?

1022
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,875
You should change into Mohammed of Ghazni.

1023
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:45,333
Maya is a Hindu. Why should I convert?

1024
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,708
You should keep trying till you succeed, I meant.

1025
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,333
If you try, even trains can play on tar roads.

1026
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:56,208
I hereby announce, Valarmathi, sister of Ayyanar of Koviloor

1027
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:00,167
will marry Chinnayan, son of Nagaraj of Melur

1028
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,083
on the 6th day of Karthigai

1029
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,125
as decided by the elders who have gathered here today.

1030
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:07,250
Exchange the plates with your offering. - Yes.

1031
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:43,667
"Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?"

1032
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:50,708
"Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?"

1033
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:58,667
"Kindling you, I was floored. My feelings went overboard."

1034
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:03,375
"Love rang on your mobile as a missed call meanwhile."

1035
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:07,750
"Shall I open my heart to you? Gather dreams of love true."

1036
01:07:07,917 --> 01:07:11,833
"I'll caress, express always. I lost myself, don't you see?"

1037
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,667
"Can't you express your love in a single word?"

1038
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:25,833
"Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?"

1039
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:01,583
"My white 'puri'.. Sweet pretzel.."

1040
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,917
"I want to canoodle with every inch of yours."

1041
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:12,750
"Tonight I'd like you to be my wife for eternity."

1042
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:20,750
"Your glamour and my humor combined will work out fine, my baby."

1043
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:26,125
"From the size of your shoe to your diet plan."

1044
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:29,583
"I'll note it all. As it's my hobby."

1045
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:33,583
"I've bracketed you, dear. You're my target."

1046
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,333
"Like a rocket, don't fly high into the sky.."

1047
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:15,417
"Take U-turn and depart in high speed, towards my heart."

1048
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:23,167
"I think of you, and like an angel you appear at once."

1049
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:28,500
"I bagged your love-seat with a handkerchief."

1050
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:32,292
"Don't make it a no ball, please."

1051
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:39,500
"Ask your Doberman about me. Your puppy is my pet-buddy."

1052
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:44,083
"I just need your pretty head to nod. Why does it take so long?"

1053
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:48,083
"Just one look will do to share your love true."

1054
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:05,333
"Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?"

1055
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:13,458
"Do you want paraffin lamp light? Won't a torch light do, my beauty?"

1056
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:38,250
Why are you still awake?

1057
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:39,458
I'm not getting sleep.

1058
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,708
Thanks for the coffee. - Okay, sir.

1059
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:47,958
Jakkamma predicts good time for all of you.

1060
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,000
Maiden of this house will be married soon.

1061
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:52,167
Oracle of Jakkamma!

1062
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,958
The hero of her heart will come in search of her.

1063
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:58,458
Good times ahead.

1064
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,833
A wedding is just round the corner.

1065
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,125
Festive air around this house shortly.

1066
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:08,292
Lady of the house will have her wishes fulfilled.

1067
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,542
Happy events will take place.

1068
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,750
Jakkamma's words..

1069
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:25,333
Oh no!

1070
01:13:10,292 --> 01:13:11,292
Hello?

1071
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,083
Ravi?

1072
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,500
Murali, what happened?

1073
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:24,333
I've been hunting for you everywhere. Come down.

1074
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,000
Tell me. - Come down. I'll tell you.

1075
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,250
Listen to me.

1076
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,292
Move aside.

1077
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:47,167
Son, look at this tragic occurrence.

1078
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:50,750
They were always willing to give their lives for the palace.

1079
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:52,792
I never treated them like servants at all.

1080
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,250
They were more like my own brothers.

1081
01:13:55,792 --> 01:13:59,750
I won't spare the killer.

1082
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:03,792
They've been killed elsewhere and dumped into this river.

1083
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:31,417
Old man? Who came to the palace last night to foretell?

1084
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:34,083
I think it was Sangili.

1085
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:35,708
Hey, Sangili!

1086
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:38,292
Someone has come in search of you from the palace.

1087
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,542
From the palace?

1088
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,417
Why are you running like this?

1089
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,000
I don't know anything. Let me go, sir.

1090
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,583
Tell me the truth. What did you see at the palace?

1091
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,042
Why did you run away? - Sir.

1092
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,708
Don't let anyone stay there. Leave that place at once.

1093
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:12,375
Your lives are in danger. - What are you saying?

1094
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,625
One of the inmates of the palace has been possessed by a spirit, sir.

1095
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:18,833
I swear on Jakkamma. I saw it myself.

1096
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:23,333
When I came to the palace last night..

1097
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,333
<i>Maiden of this house will be married soon.</i>

1098
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,833
<i>Save me.. - Jakka..</i>

1099
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:43,583
I saw it killing a man in the most gruesome manner.

1100
01:15:48,792 --> 01:15:50,583
Can you identify the person?

1101
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,667
That's difficult, sir.

1102
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,750
But the spirit has possessed a girl, sir.

1103
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:02,125
It's not an ordinary harmless spirit.

1104
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:03,458
It was very ferocious.

1105
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,292
Its fury has not subsided at all.

1106
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:06,500
Take it, sir.

1107
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:11,958
This is an egg, sanctified for 41 days in the cemetery.

1108
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:13,333
You take it home.

1109
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,375
This egg will identify the person the spirit has possessed, sir.

1110
01:16:18,458 --> 01:16:19,875
I don't..

1111
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,542
Don't hesitate, sir.

1112
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:23,458
We don't know who else it will kill.

1113
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,625
We already have 3 victims. - Go soon, sir.

1114
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,500
<i>There is something there.</i>

1115
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,792
<i>I thought I saw someone standing here.</i>

1116
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,750
<i>Right next to you.</i>

1117
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:42,125
Take it, sir.

1118
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:44,583
In this world, there are many powers beyond our perception.

1119
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:45,833
Have faith, sir.

1120
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:01,917
The cook left without giving us any notice.

1121
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:04,167
We thought the drunkard driver had passed out somewhere.

1122
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,000
We saw the servant even last night.

1123
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,875
All this is shocking even for us, Inspector.

1124
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:09,250
Call everyone to assemble here.

1125
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,792
We must question all of them separately. - Do you suspect us?

1126
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,083
The lawyer is here. Clarify with him.

1127
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,542
This is a common police procedure.

1128
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,083
We'll have to cooperate.

1129
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:55,958
What?

1130
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:50,042
Hey, pal.. Wait for me.

1131
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,583
Are you taking your dirty clothes to wash them in the river?

1132
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,542
What? Someone killed 3 servants who worked in this house.

1133
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,917
And threw them into the river.

1134
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,250
Do you expect the corpse to be thrown in front of your house?

1135
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:02,208
The three dead men worked in this place.

1136
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:03,875
We are the last employees alive.

1137
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:06,583
They were original. We are duplicates.

1138
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:07,792
We know that.

1139
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,250
But the killer doesn't, right?

1140
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:13,167
Inspector has told us not to step out till this case is solved.

1141
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,667
That's why the whole family is staying indoors.

1142
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,167
If we go out, we'll become the prime suspects.

1143
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,333
Get back inside.

1144
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:24,792
Do you believe firmly that the spirit is called Selvi?

1145
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:28,958
Our servant's little girl always talks of a Ms. Selvi.

1146
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,167
Let's try our luck.

1147
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:31,458
'Mortuary'

1148
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,792
Wait.. Wait. Don't let them go in.

1149
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,750
The entire town has gathered here.

1150
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:39,417
How long will it take, sir? - Sir..

1151
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:42,708
3 corpses, sir. We can't cater to your impatience.

1152
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:43,833
Please wait.

1153
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,208
You wanted information on a girl called Selvi, right?

1154
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,000
I thoroughly checked the police records.

1155
01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:52,083
5 years ago, a girl called Selvi ran away with the temple jewels.

1156
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:53,708
She is nowhere to be found.

1157
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,667
This is her profile. - That girl was..

1158
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:59,167
Why do you want to know about her?

1159
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,875
Already 3 murders have taken place in the village..

1160
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:03,750
I thought it has got to do.. - With that priest's daughter Selvi?

1161
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:06,708
She disgraced our entire town. Why discuss her now?

1162
01:22:06,875 --> 01:22:08,542
Move aside. Watch your step.

1163
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:09,792
Let them bring the body out.

1164
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,417
You left me behind.

1165
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:13,375
Selvi was a good girl, sir.

1166
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:16,708
Don't believe what they say.

1167
01:22:17,417 --> 01:22:18,500
You are..

1168
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:24,708
I'm the priest's daughter.

1169
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,875
Selvi grew up in our house.

1170
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,167
Though we both weren't blood sisters

1171
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,833
we grew up like siblings.

1172
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:03,125
Hello? - Will you surely chase away the suitor who is coming?

1173
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,667
Why this silly doubt?

1174
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:08,542
So far, I've packed away 11 prospective grooms.

1175
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:09,833
How can this one alone escape?

1176
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:13,000
He's very affluent. He is coming in a car.

1177
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:15,833
Last week, the suitor who came on a moped

1178
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,167
was sent packing, sans his bike by me.

1179
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,875
Is the suitor driving down this time?

1180
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:21,625
Careful, Selvi. Don't get into trouble.

1181
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:23,375
Hang up now. I can see a car. - Selvi..

1182
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:39,833
Bull's eye!

1183
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:46,833
How do we go to the priest's house?

1184
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,333
Go straight and turn right.

1185
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,875
Thank you very much.

1186
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:55,375
Why do you want to go there?

1187
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:57,542
To see his daughter as a prospective bride.

1188
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,917
Daughter? - Let's go. - Then who's he?

1189
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,375
If you don't know to drive

1190
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:18,583
why didn't you bring a driver along?

1191
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,375
I was driving properly.

1192
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:22,042
Some idiot hit me with a stone.

1193
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,667
Car is stuck in a ditch now.

1194
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:26,042
Can you lend me a hand to push the car out? - Sure.

1195
01:24:28,792 --> 01:24:29,792
Push some more.

1196
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,375
That's right.

1197
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:37,583
You want to take the car out, right? - Yes.

1198
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,667
Keep the keys in the car and come with me.

1199
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:41,917
The car will follow us automatically.

1200
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:43,125
What do you mean?

1201
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,042
Trust me.

1202
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:47,833
Are you into this voodoo or black magic and stuff like that?

1203
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,292
None of that nonsense.

1204
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,917
Just hide yourself here. The car will come here.

1205
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:54,375
If I hide, will the car come here?

1206
01:24:54,542 --> 01:24:55,542
How?

1207
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,583
Are you new to this town?

1208
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:58,958
This is my hometown.

1209
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:01,375
I'm coming back here after a very long time.

1210
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:05,167
What are you doing?

1211
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,667
This is the stone I was hit by.

1212
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,500
I'll preserve it, complain to the police.

1213
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:10,292
I'll set sniffer dogs on to the culprit.

1214
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:12,833
And pack him off to jail. Just wait and watch what I do.

1215
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:16,042
Why are you making a big issue out of nothing?

1216
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:18,042
It's not a small incident. It's an attempt to murder.

1217
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,417
I won't let him off the hook.

1218
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:21,750
If he had missed a little I'd be a dead body!

1219
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,542
You must be well connected.

1220
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:26,875
My car has come just as you said.

1221
01:25:27,042 --> 01:25:30,750
Go and stop the car without buttering me up. - You're correct!

1222
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,125
Hello! Hold on.

1223
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:36,875
Thanks.

1224
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:38,875
Is he the owner of the car? - Thanks.

1225
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,042
Sorry, sir. Sorry. I didn't know.

1226
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,667
I'm thanking you but you're apologizing to me.

1227
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,458
I'm apologizing and you're thanking me!

1228
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,125
Sorry. - What's wrong with him?

1229
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:50,583
Did you think he came to help you? - Then.

1230
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,417
He came to steal your car.

1231
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,708
Watch out! This village is filled with thieves.

1232
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,250
You can't even leave a toy cycle unguarded!

1233
01:25:57,417 --> 01:26:00,542
And you left the key on the ignition.

1234
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:03,417
What planning! Great! Okay, I'll take leave.

1235
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:06,042
Your car is okay, no!

1236
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:09,542
Someone by mistake threw a stone at you.

1237
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,833
Why preserve it?

1238
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:13,792
You might as well throw it away.

1239
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:15,542
I won't let the culprit go scot-free.

1240
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,625
I'll ensure he or she goes to jail for at least 5 years.

1241
01:26:47,667 --> 01:26:49,708
Where has this chap disappeared?

1242
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,625
Hello, where are you?

1243
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:54,000
Look up, right above you.

1244
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,208
This side.

1245
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,958
It's been half an hour since I came here.

1246
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,792
As a thief, do you have any sense of responsibility?

1247
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:03,333
Okay, fine. Why don't you do your job in a jiffy?

1248
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:04,667
What were you waiting for?

1249
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:06,000
I need to bargain with you.

1250
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:08,833
I'll pay you the 300 bucks that we agreed upon.

1251
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Not enough.

1252
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:11,875
It's a small stone after all that you'll be stealing.

1253
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:14,792
The object is small. But the subject is huge!

1254
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,000
Isn't there a difference in pick-pocketing 50 bucks

1255
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,958
and stealing the same from a bank locker? - Okay.

1256
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:21,208
Agreed! I'll give you extra 50 bucks.

1257
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:24,125
Get the pebble. - Done!

1258
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,833
How much I had to talk to get an extra 50 bucks!

1259
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:40,083
What's he doing for so long?

1260
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:46,083
Somehow this year, we must find a good girl for Murali.

1261
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:48,667
That's why you should perform a ritual in our temple.

1262
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:51,000
So I asked you to come here all the way from Mumbai.

1263
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:52,708
Make arrangements for it immediately.

1264
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:55,833
We are coming here after so many years.

1265
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:59,083
We need to consult the priest and fix an auspicious day.

1266
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,625
Stone is missing.

1267
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:30,875
Found it?

1268
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:32,292
I got so many items.

1269
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:35,000
Not just a pebble or a stone, I can buy even a quarry!

1270
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,250
I'll kill you.

1271
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:38,667
I only asked you to find the stone I hit him with.

1272
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,000
Is it a priceless diamond? It's just a pebble, right?

1273
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:43,792
If I come to such a fancy place and steal just a pebble

1274
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:45,667
it's a disgrace to my family.

1275
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:47,375
Can a leopard change its spots!

1276
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:50,417
If you bathe a mongrel and bring it to the hall

1277
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:53,333
it will only go lick all kinds of rotten stuff.

1278
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,208
Instead of licking, can a dog go to a restaurant and eat?

1279
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:58,792
You're talking too much. Go help yourself, okay?

1280
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:01,333
Bungling burglar! - Oh no.

1281
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:06,417
What's that noise about? - Thieves.

1282
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,208
They have broken in.

1283
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:12,625
How audacious to have broken into the palace to steal!

1284
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:14,875
If we nab them, they are dead meat!

1285
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:19,417
Search every nook and corner. - Look there.

1286
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:20,708
I swear I'm not a thief.

1287
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,208
Then what are you doing here at this hour?

1288
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,583
I came to take back that pebble. - Why?

1289
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,833
If you complain to the police, they'd bring the dogs.

1290
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,958
Why should that affect you?

1291
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:36,542
I was the one to hit you with it.

1292
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:39,833
Forgive me. I'm leaving.

1293
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,458
Don't go that way. You'll get caught.

1294
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:43,667
Come with me.

1295
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:46,000
Is he hiding somewhere in the dark?

1296
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:52,167
Come soon. This way.

1297
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:55,833
Look properly, man.

1298
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,458
Who the heck are you? What are you doing here?

1299
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:04,417
Ask the girl standing right beside you.

1300
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:06,500
Shut up, you ass. You are to be blamed.

1301
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,000
I came only to steal the stuff inside the house.

1302
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:09,708
You stole the owner himself!

1303
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:10,958
I came to save her skin.

1304
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,333
What kind of landlord are you?

1305
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,708
Looks like you will hand over the keys to her on a platter!

1306
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:17,583
One must never steal in a house without a grill or any thrill!

1307
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,750
See you?

1308
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:22,500
If I get caught alone they'll call me a thief.

1309
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:26,375
My reputation will be in tatters if I'm caught along with you!

1310
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,792
He should not escape.

1311
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,750
Where could he be?

1312
01:30:35,458 --> 01:30:37,542
Oh no!

1313
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,250
What?

1314
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:40,708
I'm caught.

1315
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,625
What do I do now?

1316
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,542
Remove your half-sari!

1317
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:48,250
You have a one track mind.

1318
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:49,792
It is only to save you.

1319
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:51,167
If I cover my face and run

1320
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,833
they'll chase me thinking that I'm the thief.

1321
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,333
You can escape through the other way.

1322
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,542
What say?

1323
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,042
Okay.

1324
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,875
Close your eyes.

1325
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,375
Close your eyes tight.

1326
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,833
Didn't you come for this?

1327
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:25,708
I'll run this way and you can escape.

1328
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:27,667
I heard a sound but I can't see anyone.

1329
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,292
Ask them to check the terrace.

1330
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:32,417
Hey! Who are you?

1331
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:34,417
Catch hold of him.

1332
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:36,833
If you're a real man, show us your face and don't run.

1333
01:31:43,167 --> 01:31:45,583
Ask Ramya to get ready soon.

1334
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,667
I've asked the groom's family to meet me at the temple.

1335
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,958
I'll go and fetch them. - Is the suitor's family on the way?

1336
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:51,792
Father, this is so unexpected.

1337
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:53,208
If I tell you in advance

1338
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,750
some problem or the other crops up.

1339
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:57,000
They come into our town but don't visit us here.

1340
01:31:57,167 --> 01:31:58,750
So I arranged this without telling anyone.

1341
01:31:58,917 --> 01:31:59,958
Get ready.. - Selvi..

1342
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:02,083
I'll bring them.. - What do we do now?

1343
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:03,958
Get married. - I'll kill you.

1344
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:06,417
I want to study.

1345
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,042
I don't want to get married.

1346
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:10,583
If he's coming to town I can catapult him away.

1347
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,375
Now they are coming to our door step!

1348
01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:14,542
The groom's family is here.

1349
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,958
Come quickly. Is the priest here?

1350
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:18,417
He's expected anytime now.

1351
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:19,833
Please sit down.

1352
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:22,625
Careful, son.

1353
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,208
Hello? Tell me, Ayyanar.

1354
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,625
Where are you? At the priest's house.

1355
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,958
What?

1356
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:41,125
You come here. We'll wait for you.

1357
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:50,125
No problem. Will you come here?

1358
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,333
Thanks, dear.

1359
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:58,875
Thank you.

1360
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,417
I like this groom a lot.

1361
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:08,167
You said you didn't want to get married at all.

1362
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,542
That was before I saw his face.

1363
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:13,000
He's too tall for you!

1364
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:15,292
If I can get him, won't I find a pair of slippers?

1365
01:33:15,458 --> 01:33:16,958
I'll wear heels.

1366
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:19,417
Why are you both whispering secrets?

1367
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:21,292
We all like the groom.

1368
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:23,167
He seems too tall. - Groom?

1369
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:24,417
Yes, groom.

1370
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:25,625
Mani, tell her.

1371
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:27,667
It you think he's too tall

1372
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,667
we can make the girl stand next to him.

1373
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:31,208
How can we allow that?

1374
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:33,750
The bride and her friend are of the same height. Ask her to come.

1375
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:35,667
That's a fact as well. - Go and stand, dear.

1376
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:37,833
Stand on your toes and make them agree somehow.

1377
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,708
Don't feel shy. Come and stand.

1378
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:56,208
Mr. Ayyanar is here.

1379
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,500
Why did you take the trouble?

1380
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:04,167
I told you I'd ask the priest and let you know.

1381
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:05,375
I was feeling restless.

1382
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:08,000
So I thought I'd come in person and find out.

1383
01:34:08,167 --> 01:34:10,833
Since we are performing the ritual of redemption after a long time

1384
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,625
the priest feels we should get divine ordinance.

1385
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:14,458
Aren't they the groom's family?

1386
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,667
You silly old lady! They are from the palace.

1387
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:18,083
The groom and his family aren't coming today.

1388
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:20,750
Tomorrow is Friday. If you go there

1389
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:21,958
when our goddess foretells you can find it out.

1390
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,833
I'll take your leave. - Okay.

1391
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:26,542
Priest, please make all other arrangements.

1392
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:28,917
I'll go with madam to the temple tomorrow.

1393
01:34:43,833 --> 01:34:45,625
Mr. Chairman, they are from the palace.

1394
01:34:45,792 --> 01:34:48,042
Our goddess will foretell only good news for you.

1395
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:51,500
In this era, how can you believe in such silly superstitions?

1396
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:52,833
Just keep quiet.

1397
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:58,750
Our goddess is here.

1398
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:05,958
Praise be to Shakti!

1399
01:35:11,417 --> 01:35:13,542
Didn't we see this girl at the priest's place yesterday?

1400
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,792
Same girl. - Her family came from North India 20 years ago, to restore the temple.

1401
01:35:17,958 --> 01:35:21,333
Both her parents died in an accident when the walls of the temple collapsed.

1402
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,333
The entire town accepted this orphan.

1403
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,167
And she's being raised by the priest now.

1404
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,667
No one anticipated this.

1405
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:29,083
On a full moon day when she was just 5 years old

1406
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,417
she was possessed by the goddess and she started foretelling.

1407
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:34,083
We believe that maybe having orphaned her

1408
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,583
the goddess decided to use her body for prophesy.

1409
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:38,750
Due to the divine presence, whatever the girl speaks

1410
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:40,792
comes true is what we believe.

1411
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:17,750
Whoever wants to ask about any problem, please do so.

1412
01:36:17,917 --> 01:36:19,750
Let's go and find out whatever is troubling you.

1413
01:36:19,917 --> 01:36:21,875
It's my daughter's wedding next week.

1414
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,792
And my eldest son is suffering from chicken pox.

1415
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:25,542
How can You do this to us, Goddess?

1416
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:27,792
He'll be fine within 2 days. - You clear your doubt.

1417
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,417
I've never left anything undone in any of my vows.

1418
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,667
And even if I did, please forgive me.

1419
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:36,667
We've been trying to find a suitable bride for my son

1420
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,917
but not a single alliance is suitable.

1421
01:36:39,083 --> 01:36:42,917
You should only show me the kind of girl he likes.

1422
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:04,792
Praise be to Shakti!

1423
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:06,167
Offer the lit camphor.

1424
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:11,833
Praise be to Shakti!

1425
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,833
What happened?

1426
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:25,500
Nothing. - Hi!

1427
01:37:27,417 --> 01:37:30,375
Why didn't you answer my mother's question?

1428
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:33,083
Let's go. - One minute.

1429
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:35,667
I don't know to talk in a roundabout way.

1430
01:37:35,833 --> 01:37:38,667
I liked you very much the moment I met you.

1431
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,583
I want to marry you.

1432
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:43,042
What say? Tell me, Selvi.

1433
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:45,875
I'm not the kind of girl you think I am.

1434
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:48,833
My lifestyle is totally different from yours.

1435
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:51,167
We won't be compatible.

1436
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:54,042
If you had said, you don't like me, I'd have left at once.

1437
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:56,125
Don't give me silly excuses.

1438
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:57,958
My train leaves at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

1439
01:37:58,167 --> 01:37:59,875
I'll be waiting for you till 3:30.

1440
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:05,375
I'll be most happy if you say 'yes' by then.

1441
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:09,542
If you don't come, I will assume that you don't like me.

1442
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,542
And after that I won't trouble you.

1443
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,208
Think and let me know.

1444
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:25,042
"You were the one to propose.. I became yours.. Really close.."

1445
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:30,625
"All that I have thought, will happen, isn't it true?"

1446
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:36,375
"Even if I change into breeze, I'll be a part of your breath with ease."

1447
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:41,292
"Even if I am as sublime as a dream I'll hold myself together for you."

1448
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:49,542
"What happened to me and you? We found love in each other."

1449
01:39:50,875 --> 01:39:56,167
"You were the one to propose.. I became yours.. Really close.."

1450
01:39:56,417 --> 01:40:02,208
"All that I have thought, will happen, isn't it true?"

1451
01:40:37,042 --> 01:40:42,667
"When I sit on the swing under the banyan tree you'll caress me."

1452
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:47,583
"Pinch me and hide."

1453
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:53,792
"In the moss laden lily pond when I take bath"

1454
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:59,333
"you'll stoke fire in me soulfully."

1455
01:40:59,542 --> 01:41:05,000
"When Sun is sleeping goats go a-bleating.."

1456
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:10,708
"I sleep in a cocoon of your love and you dwell in my heart."

1457
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:16,208
"Even our family deity's sari shines like you, enchantingly."

1458
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:18,958
"I have a million desires."

1459
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:23,833
"I dream of the day we'll unite."

1460
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:30,875
"I was a design on the temple stone, you gave me a home to own."

1461
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:36,000
"I was a light to the town but you accepted me as yours."

1462
01:42:36,167 --> 01:42:41,833
"Your memories within me will stay in my soul till eternity."

1463
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,292
"You're the only boon I need. For nothing else would I plead."

1464
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:55,375
"What happened to me and you? We found love in each other."

1465
01:42:56,583 --> 01:43:01,917
"You were the one to propose.. I became yours.. Really close.."

1466
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:07,833
"All that I have thought, will happen, isn't it true?"

1467
01:43:08,125 --> 01:43:13,333
"Even if I change into breeze, I'll be a part of your breath with ease."

1468
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:18,833
"Even if I am as sublime as a dream I'll hold myself together for you."

1469
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:25,167
See you.

1470
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,875
That's the last time I saw her.

1471
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:41,875
Then they blamed her unfairly for stealing the temple jewelry.

1472
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:44,750
She isn't a thief, sir.

1473
01:43:45,083 --> 01:43:48,500
Only she can tell us what happened.

1474
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:52,833
After she left

1475
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,625
I lost my happiness and dreams of studying.

1476
01:43:55,792 --> 01:43:58,667
Then my father got me married to a textile shop owner.

1477
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:09,458
Maya, why are you standing here, all by yourself?

1478
01:44:09,667 --> 01:44:10,667
I'm so bored.

1479
01:44:10,833 --> 01:44:12,875
They said the store room contains old albums.

1480
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:14,375
I thought I'd see them.

1481
01:44:14,542 --> 01:44:17,792
But I'm scared to step in. - Why?

1482
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,667
What if there's any spirit inside?

1483
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:22,875
How can a ghost appear when I am around?

1484
01:44:23,042 --> 01:44:24,750
What nonsense!

1485
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:28,375
Aren't you scared of ghosts at all?

1486
01:44:28,542 --> 01:44:30,417
Ask any ghost to come in front of me.

1487
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:31,708
I'll give a tight one.

1488
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:34,042
I've also been eager to see a ghost for a long time.

1489
01:44:34,208 --> 01:44:36,000
But the ghost is too scared of me.

1490
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:38,958
I take spirits to watch films. I am a brave man!

1491
01:44:39,125 --> 01:44:40,167
Come inside.

1492
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:41,833
Come.

1493
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,458
I never thought you'd be so brave.

1494
01:44:44,625 --> 01:44:48,333
When I was young, I used to brush my teeth with ash from the cemetery.

1495
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:50,083
And scrape my tongue with a chest bone.

1496
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:51,500
Only the coward looks at it as a skeleton.

1497
01:44:51,667 --> 01:44:54,500
For one who scares others, it's merely a sparrow's nest.

1498
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:56,667
But I'm petrified of ghosts.

1499
01:44:56,833 --> 01:45:00,917
Cowards who can't profess their love and have a premature death

1500
01:45:01,083 --> 01:45:02,333
end up as spirits.

1501
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,375
Brave souls like me who can express their love freely, shouldn't fear ghosts.

1502
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:09,542
So have you expressed your love?

1503
01:45:12,917 --> 01:45:14,917
I intend to.

1504
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:17,667
You'll witness it.

1505
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:21,042
It's time that I express.

1506
01:45:21,208 --> 01:45:23,167
Paalsamy, I found the album.

1507
01:45:23,333 --> 01:45:25,167
You can lock the door and come.

1508
01:45:25,667 --> 01:45:26,833
Then who is this?

1509
01:45:34,417 --> 01:45:36,875
If you see a ghost, you'll give it a tight slap, right?

1510
01:45:37,042 --> 01:45:40,667
How will I have the guts to slap a spirit?

1511
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:43,417
You said, you scraped your tongue with a chest bone.

1512
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:46,125
I didn't realize I said all that. Forgive me.

1513
01:45:58,333 --> 01:46:00,333
You wished to see a ghost, right?

1514
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,500
I actually didn't mean it.

1515
01:46:01,667 --> 01:46:04,042
Should you take my words as that from the Gospel?

1516
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:10,375
Boss, why are you in such a pitiful state?

1517
01:46:10,542 --> 01:46:14,167
When you and Ms. Maya went into a room alone, I was worried.

1518
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:16,000
I knew something like this would happen.

1519
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:17,250
Like what?

1520
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:20,000
What happens when cotton and fire are placed near each other?

1521
01:46:20,167 --> 01:46:21,500
There ought to be fire.

1522
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:23,542
Was her response real wild?

1523
01:46:27,167 --> 01:46:31,792
You're way too fast, boss. You've played a wild game.

1524
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:33,292
Who? Me?

1525
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:35,375
You don't know what you're talking about.

1526
01:46:35,542 --> 01:46:38,333
Wait, boss. Let me pacify your lady love.

1527
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,750
Any man will feel this way if he sees a beautiful girl.

1528
01:46:41,917 --> 01:46:44,958
Just say 'yes' and marry him, instead of regretting your deed.

1529
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:46,167
There's no other choice.

1530
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:49,500
You've lost your chastity and only he can wipe off the stain.

1531
01:46:56,375 --> 01:47:00,375
Your turn now. - Oh no.

1532
01:47:00,833 --> 01:47:01,917
Oh no..

1533
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,542
Men can make mistakes and get away with it, isn't it?

1534
01:47:08,708 --> 01:47:10,708
We won't.

1535
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,208
Boss, save me.

1536
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:15,000
You'd have heard of Thai massages.

1537
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:16,875
This is spiritual massage. Enjoy!

1538
01:47:20,042 --> 01:47:21,042
Don't hit me.

1539
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:23,583
Do I have to agree to marry him?

1540
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:25,333
No, don't.

1541
01:47:27,667 --> 01:47:29,125
'You interviewed a ghost.'

1542
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:31,125
'You're so dead.'

1543
01:47:37,375 --> 01:47:39,333
Why didn't you tell this before?

1544
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,375
Did you even let me open my mouth?

1545
01:47:41,542 --> 01:47:43,333
Let's scoot from here.

1546
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:48,750
Sister, isn't it over? A little rest..

1547
01:47:48,917 --> 01:47:52,417
What? - For you, I mean.

1548
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:58,708
My shirt is torn.

1549
01:47:59,167 --> 01:48:00,333
What happened just now?

1550
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,792
Boss, when did I come into the storeroom?

1551
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:05,458
They must have thought of you as an antique piece!

1552
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:09,250
We've come to Level 1 of this house only now.

1553
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:11,542
Let's escape before we reach Level 2.

1554
01:48:11,708 --> 01:48:12,917
Get up. Go.

1555
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:16,500
Madhavi, come here.

1556
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,583
Your brother has bought you saris.

1557
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:23,708
Come and choose one for yourself.

1558
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:34,167
Take whichever design you like, ma'am.

1559
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:38,792
Why are you standing still?

1560
01:48:38,958 --> 01:48:40,417
Pick one.

1561
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:43,542
Look at this. This color will suit you.

1562
01:48:46,958 --> 01:48:49,208
Ramya, hold on.

1563
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:55,000
Keep this money. - No, thank you.

1564
01:48:55,167 --> 01:48:57,208
Your brother paid. - It's okay, take it.

1565
01:48:57,375 --> 01:48:58,917
Tell me if you need anything else.

1566
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:00,542
No.

1567
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,792
I'm not used to all this.

1568
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:04,500
I have never taken money from anyone in this manner.

1569
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:06,833
Won't you take it from your Selvi?

1570
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,333
Selvi?

1571
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:22,167
<i>It was not my fault at all.</i>

1572
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:25,375
<i>It was unfair of them to beat me up to death.</i>

1573
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:33,708
<i>That day I went to meet Murali so eagerly, remember?</i>

1574
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:34,917
Selvi!

1575
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:38,875
<i>Mr. Chairman called me to the temple saying it was some urgent business.</i>

1576
01:49:39,042 --> 01:49:40,792
I'm on the way to meet someone.

1577
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:42,708
This is an emergency. Get into the car.

1578
01:49:42,875 --> 01:49:46,042
<i>He forced me to come even though I refused.</i>

1579
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,542
<i>Only when I reached the temple I found out</i>

1580
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:53,667
<i>that someone had stolen the jewels of our goddess.</i>

1581
01:49:53,833 --> 01:49:56,333
<i>And replaced them with fake ones.</i>

1582
01:49:57,042 --> 01:50:01,000
<i>The elders of the village were discussing it.</i>

1583
01:50:01,167 --> 01:50:03,458
We are the only few trustees.

1584
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:06,042
If we go to the police, it will be humiliating.

1585
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:10,833
I knew who the thief was when I touched the fake jewelry.

1586
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:29,500
We'll collect money from the villagers

1587
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:31,083
and get new jewelry. - Don't worry.

1588
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:33,375
The jewelry will be returned tomorrow.

1589
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:36,708
I stopped Ayyanar on the way and asked him about the jewelry.

1590
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:39,167
Why are you talking to me here, instead of talking at the temple?

1591
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:42,292
<i>After initially denying it, he ended up accepting it.</i>

1592
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:43,500
<i>Not only that.</i>

1593
01:50:43,667 --> 01:50:46,292
How long will you survive being a foreteller?

1594
01:50:46,458 --> 01:50:49,708
Take 10 lakhs from me and find a decent way to live.

1595
01:50:49,875 --> 01:50:51,750
This is all the respect you deserve from me.

1596
01:50:51,917 --> 01:50:55,583
Before the sun rises tomorrow, return..

1597
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:02,333
I gave you a chance to survive because you're a young girl.

1598
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,833
Did you listen?

1599
01:51:04,083 --> 01:51:06,333
Why couldn't you take up my generous offer?

1600
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,458
You're making me kill somebody you once prayed to!

1601
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:10,167
When it's between money or God

1602
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:12,500
I'd choose money anytime.

1603
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:15,417
Ayyanar, why are you standing here?

1604
01:51:15,583 --> 01:51:17,375
If your car has conked off, travel by my car instead.

1605
01:51:17,542 --> 01:51:19,458
Nothing of that sort. Needed to relieve ourselves.

1606
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:21,833
That's all? - Then I'll leave.

1607
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:27,917
Go, find her.

1608
01:51:28,333 --> 01:51:31,042
She fell here. - She's not here.

1609
01:51:31,208 --> 01:51:32,917
Where's she? - Where is she? She's missing.

1610
01:51:33,083 --> 01:51:34,708
Don't let her get away.

1611
01:51:34,875 --> 01:51:38,167
This is good news. Selvi is a lucky girl.

1612
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:40,500
Give this good news to your mother.

1613
01:51:40,667 --> 01:51:42,083
She'll gladly prepare for the wedding.

1614
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:43,250
Wait, man.

1615
01:51:43,417 --> 01:51:44,875
I've just expressed my love for her.

1616
01:51:45,042 --> 01:51:46,667
Don't I need to know what she thinks?

1617
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:48,833
Let's see if she comes. Then I'll tell my mother.

1618
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,542
Why would she ever say no to you?

1619
01:51:51,708 --> 01:51:53,125
She'll definitely come.

1620
01:51:55,833 --> 01:51:57,375
Hello?

1621
01:51:57,583 --> 01:51:59,458
Murali! - Yes. - Let's start.

1622
01:51:59,833 --> 01:52:01,833
Mom, I'm not ready. You go first.

1623
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,458
It's time for the train. Let's leave now.

1624
01:52:04,625 --> 01:52:07,125
He's found a reason to stay behind now.

1625
01:52:07,333 --> 01:52:09,000
You go. I'll bring him.

1626
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:10,417
You are acting so irresponsible these days.

1627
01:52:10,583 --> 01:52:12,292
You bring him on time to catch the train.

1628
01:52:12,458 --> 01:52:13,458
I'll take care of it.

1629
01:52:13,625 --> 01:52:14,750
We'll leave. Start the car.

1630
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:17,667
I take responsibility to bring him to the station.

1631
01:52:19,167 --> 01:52:20,667
Drive carefully.

1632
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:22,583
Come, Selvi.

1633
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:25,625
Murali told me everything. I'm very happy now.

1634
01:52:25,792 --> 01:52:27,667
You've found a good family to get married into.

1635
01:52:27,833 --> 01:52:29,708
You seem to be hurt. - I fell on my way.

1636
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:31,375
Sit down. I'll get you coffee.

1637
01:52:31,542 --> 01:52:33,417
No, I don't want all that. I need to see him.

1638
01:52:33,583 --> 01:52:34,583
Such a hurry to see him!

1639
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:36,833
He's in the shower. He'll come out anytime.

1640
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,625
I'll go and get coffee. You sit down.

1641
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:57,917
Sir.. - What are you doing here?

1642
01:52:59,167 --> 01:53:02,250
Ayyanar is coming. He shouldn't know I'm here.

1643
01:53:02,417 --> 01:53:03,500
Why?

1644
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:07,333
They want to kill me. They are thieves.

1645
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:10,417
They stole jewelry from the temple and..

1646
01:53:15,167 --> 01:53:19,833
Why, sir? - What else to do?

1647
01:53:20,833 --> 01:53:23,625
Luckily, she came here. No one knows, right?

1648
01:53:23,792 --> 01:53:25,667
That's why I stabbed her before anyone saw her.

1649
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:26,833
Samy?

1650
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,542
Samy?

1651
01:53:29,167 --> 01:53:31,583
What is it? - What are you doing here?

1652
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,750
Are you ready?

1653
01:53:32,917 --> 01:53:34,708
Ayyanar, I thought you were busy.

1654
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:36,667
You said you'd come directly to the station. - No.

1655
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:39,708
Samy called me here saying he had some important work.

1656
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:41,333
Important work? - Yes.

1657
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,417
You're entrusting this palace to him.

1658
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:44,917
He must come and send you off, right?

1659
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:46,083
Why this formality?

1660
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,667
Your mother has called up so many times.

1661
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:50,917
You'll miss your train. Leave right now.

1662
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:53,500
Sir, come here. - What?

1663
01:53:53,667 --> 01:53:56,208
You know everything and you're packing me off.

1664
01:53:56,375 --> 01:53:57,917
How can I go without seeing Selvi?

1665
01:53:58,083 --> 01:54:00,708
If that girl loves you as much as she claims

1666
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:02,583
she'd have come and met you by now.

1667
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:05,708
Isn't it evident from this, that she isn't keen?

1668
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:10,042
No, I know she loves me. She will definitely come.

1669
01:54:10,375 --> 01:54:11,500
It's not that.

1670
01:54:11,667 --> 01:54:13,417
What I want to say is..

1671
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:17,750
As a child, she grew up the hard way as an orphan.

1672
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:22,833
I want her to enjoy all the comforts and happiness from now on.

1673
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,667
I will marry Selvi and keep her happy forever.

1674
01:54:26,958 --> 01:54:30,125
I know she'll come looking for me.

1675
01:54:31,167 --> 01:54:34,208
If I wait for a few minutes, I feel my life will change.

1676
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:38,375
Just wait and watch. She'll come for me.

1677
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I can't forget her.

1678
01:54:40,167 --> 01:54:43,417
Girls here are shy. They won't talk so openly.

1679
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:44,583
No, sir.

1680
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:47,167
Your mother has been waiting at the station for a long time.

1681
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:49,292
Please leave. Leave now.

1682
01:54:49,458 --> 01:54:53,042
You leave, I will meet her and tell her.

1683
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:55,542
Have faith. I'm there for you.

1684
01:54:56,167 --> 01:54:57,542
Come.

1685
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:03,958
Ask the driver to bring the car to the porch.

1686
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:11,792
Listen to me!

1687
01:55:14,833 --> 01:55:16,250
Listen?

1688
01:55:45,583 --> 01:55:47,333
You're like my brothers.

1689
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,208
I beg of you.

1690
01:55:50,208 --> 01:55:52,708
I wish to live.

1691
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:55,333
I'll be well settled.

1692
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:00,125
I'll move out of the city with him and never tell a soul about this.

1693
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:03,125
I won't come near this town ever again.

1694
01:56:04,333 --> 01:56:08,625
I swear, I'll never come in front of you.

1695
01:56:08,792 --> 01:56:11,917
I'll go and live somewhere else.

1696
01:56:12,542 --> 01:56:14,708
Think of me as your sister and let me live, sir.

1697
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:17,500
Spare me, brother. I want to live.

1698
01:56:45,917 --> 01:56:48,167
Ayyanar, why bury her inside this palace?

1699
01:56:48,417 --> 01:56:52,583
It will stay locked. No one will ever find her.

1700
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,208
Cover it up with mud.

1701
01:57:00,375 --> 01:57:01,917
Look over there.

1702
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:09,083
I wish to lead a happy life with husband and kids.

1703
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,667
Leave me. I beg of you.

1704
01:57:12,833 --> 01:57:15,500
She's not dying though we hit her so hard.

1705
01:57:15,667 --> 01:57:17,458
Stop showing off your bravery!

1706
01:57:17,625 --> 01:57:18,750
Just cover up and bury her.

1707
01:57:18,917 --> 01:57:20,167
Let her be buried alive.

1708
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:22,333
Leave me, brother.

1709
01:57:22,542 --> 01:57:23,833
I want to live.

1710
01:57:24,417 --> 01:57:26,083
I'm begging you.

1711
01:57:39,583 --> 01:57:41,792
Do you know how much I begged all of them?

1712
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:46,958
One by one, I killed those who tortured me to death, mercilessly.

1713
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:48,708
I'll kill Ayyanar as well.

1714
01:57:48,875 --> 01:57:50,833
And not just that

1715
01:57:51,208 --> 01:57:55,042
I'll live in this body as Murali's wife, forever.

1716
01:57:58,667 --> 01:58:01,833
Think it over, dear. Isn't it wrong?

1717
01:58:02,125 --> 01:58:03,292
What is wrong?

1718
01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:07,042
Madhavi is living the life I wanted.

1719
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:11,333
You know how happily I left home that day.

1720
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:15,625
If I had gone 2 minutes earlier

1721
01:58:15,833 --> 01:58:18,458
the chairman might not have seen me on the way.

1722
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:19,833
I'd have met Murali

1723
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,667
in this very house. I'd have lived as Selvi.

1724
01:58:23,042 --> 01:58:26,125
So tell me. What's wrong with what I'm doing?

1725
01:58:27,333 --> 01:58:30,333
I didn't have the chance to unite with Murali till now.

1726
01:58:31,042 --> 01:58:33,000
Solar eclipse starts at dawn.

1727
01:58:33,167 --> 01:58:35,458
If I unite with him before that

1728
01:58:35,625 --> 01:58:36,875
I'll stay in her body forever.

1729
01:58:37,042 --> 01:58:40,083
Then no one can take me away from this body.

1730
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:24,125
Murali, what happened?

1731
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:28,542
Murali, you're bleeding. Let's go to the hospital.

1732
01:59:28,708 --> 01:59:30,417
Don't make a fuss. It's such a small cut.

1733
01:59:30,583 --> 01:59:32,292
Even if a tiny piece of glass remains inside

1734
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:34,250
it will get infected. Come with me.

1735
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,042
Why weren't you careful?

1736
01:59:38,208 --> 01:59:39,833
Master's son is bleeding.

1737
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,167
I'll get the bullock cart. - Where to?

1738
01:59:41,375 --> 01:59:43,583
We should lock you up in the house first. - Why?

1739
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:46,292
Don't we need a doctor? - They'll take care of all that.

1740
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:48,542
Just shut up. - Why are you joining us?

1741
01:59:48,708 --> 01:59:49,833
How can I not come?

1742
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Start the car.

1743
01:59:53,958 --> 01:59:55,333
There's been a lot of blood loss.

1744
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,500
Put him on drips. - Okay.

1745
01:59:56,667 --> 01:59:57,875
May I leave after this, doctor? - Leave?

1746
01:59:58,042 --> 01:59:59,958
You have to stay here for 2 days. - Why?

1747
02:00:00,125 --> 02:00:02,542
Why stay here for 2 days for such a small cut, Doctor?

1748
02:00:02,708 --> 02:00:04,958
Glass has cut a vein. Bleeding hasn't stopped.

1749
02:00:05,125 --> 02:00:07,667
He has to be under observation for 24 hours.

1750
02:00:11,625 --> 02:00:13,958
He's been admitted, Ravi. - Thank you so much, Doctor.

1751
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:16,042
I lied only because you really insisted.

1752
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:17,917
As a doctor I shouldn't be doing this at all.

1753
02:00:18,083 --> 02:00:20,167
Even now you have saved a life.

1754
02:00:20,417 --> 02:00:22,250
Here is the admission form.

1755
02:00:23,458 --> 02:00:26,708
Doctor, did you see my sister? - She left long ago.

1756
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:28,625
Left?

1757
02:00:28,792 --> 02:00:29,875
Madhavi?

1758
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:32,917
Madhavi?

1759
02:00:39,625 --> 02:00:40,750
Chicken biryani?

1760
02:00:40,917 --> 02:00:41,917
They've killed 3 people who were with me.

1761
02:00:42,125 --> 02:00:44,500
I'm really tense and you're talking about food!

1762
02:00:44,667 --> 02:00:46,792
<i>The number's busy.</i>

1763
02:00:49,667 --> 02:00:51,042
How will I know who killed them?

1764
02:00:51,208 --> 02:00:54,250
The police officer is hounding me bad enough! Dumb female!

1765
02:00:54,458 --> 02:00:55,958
You're adding to my stress level.

1766
02:00:56,125 --> 02:00:59,625
<i>The number's busy.</i>

1767
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:07,792
I can't tell when I'll get back home.

1768
02:01:07,958 --> 02:01:09,708
I'm on the way to see the minister. Hang up now.

1769
02:01:26,125 --> 02:01:29,292
Why are you standing here? - My husband hurt his hand.

1770
02:01:29,458 --> 02:01:31,458
Really? - I need to go to the hospital.

1771
02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:32,667
My car broke down.

1772
02:01:32,833 --> 02:01:34,500
Get inside. I'll drop you.

1773
02:01:34,667 --> 02:01:35,750
Okay.

1774
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,542
Ayyanar, pick up the phone.

1775
02:01:43,292 --> 02:01:45,792
I've been going from hospital to the police station the whole day.

1776
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:47,750
They've killed 3 people who were with me.

1777
02:01:47,917 --> 02:01:49,333
I won't let go of the murderer.

1778
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:50,750
Let me get my hands on him..

1779
02:01:50,917 --> 02:01:54,250
Who's calling at this hour? - Hello! - Hello.

1780
02:01:54,458 --> 02:01:55,833
Who is this? - Ayyanar, it's Ravi.

1781
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,542
Tell me. - Is my sister with you?

1782
02:01:57,708 --> 02:01:59,375
Yes. Do you want to talk to her?

1783
02:01:59,542 --> 02:02:00,958
Don't let her know I'm talking to you.

1784
02:02:01,125 --> 02:02:03,125
Escape immediately - What are you saying?

1785
02:02:03,292 --> 02:02:04,500
That's not my sister.

1786
02:02:04,708 --> 02:02:05,917
She is Selvi, the girl you killed.

1787
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:07,750
She has come to take revenge as a spirit.

1788
02:02:07,917 --> 02:02:10,375
I don't understand what you just said.

1789
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:12,417
Ayyanar?

1790
02:02:19,042 --> 02:02:20,708
Ayyanar?

1791
02:02:49,375 --> 02:02:51,500
Do you recognize me?

1792
02:03:17,292 --> 02:03:19,125
Can you recognize me now?

1793
02:03:37,708 --> 02:03:39,542
Let me go. - Don't do anything to me.

1794
02:03:40,708 --> 02:03:43,042
This is exactly how I begged you that day.

1795
02:04:18,708 --> 02:04:20,750
Why are you standing in there, you coward?

1796
02:04:20,917 --> 02:04:21,917
Come out.

1797
02:04:22,083 --> 02:04:23,208
Who is scared?

1798
02:04:24,917 --> 02:04:26,375
Wasn't getting killed once enough?

1799
02:04:26,917 --> 02:04:29,167
Have you come to die again?

1800
02:04:29,333 --> 02:04:31,083
I'll take care of you in the morning.

1801
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:34,167
Only if I let you live until then!

1802
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:36,375
I won't.

1803
02:04:37,792 --> 02:04:39,958
Do you know what dreams I had for myself?

1804
02:04:40,125 --> 02:04:41,667
Did you let me?

1805
02:04:41,833 --> 02:04:43,542
You killed me.

1806
02:04:43,708 --> 02:04:47,042
You stole the temple jewelry, then why should I be punished?

1807
02:04:47,208 --> 02:04:48,875
I won't let you live.

1808
02:04:49,042 --> 02:04:50,917
You have to come out.

1809
02:04:55,375 --> 02:04:58,083
We can't exorcise strong spirits like this, sir.

1810
02:04:58,250 --> 02:05:00,167
She was born with divine powers.

1811
02:05:00,375 --> 02:05:02,833
Because she was buried alive without fulfilling her dreams

1812
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
she's so fierce.

1813
02:05:04,167 --> 02:05:08,042
Only a holy man, with divine powers of body and mind

1814
02:05:08,208 --> 02:05:09,833
can control this spirit.

1815
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,875
One such good man is doing penance in Mukkoodal.

1816
02:05:20,542 --> 02:05:23,083
If you ask him, he'll help you exorcise the spirit of Selvi.

1817
02:05:24,917 --> 02:05:25,917
Hello?

1818
02:05:29,667 --> 02:05:30,708
What, sir?

1819
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,667
Selvi is smarter than us. - What do you mean?

1820
02:05:34,833 --> 02:05:36,958
She has got Murali discharged from the hospital.

1821
02:05:37,125 --> 02:05:39,417
It'll take you 2 hours to go and meet the holy man.

1822
02:05:39,583 --> 02:05:41,583
They shouldn't unite until then, sir. - I have a solution to that.

1823
02:05:41,917 --> 02:05:43,458
Wait, sir.

1824
02:05:43,667 --> 02:05:45,208
Priest?

1825
02:05:54,542 --> 02:05:55,750
Why are you saying so about your own sister?

1826
02:05:55,917 --> 02:05:59,792
Ravi, how can you believe in ghosts in this day and age?

1827
02:06:02,833 --> 02:06:07,167
If you don't believe me, hold this in your hand and look at her.

1828
02:06:07,333 --> 02:06:08,333
What is all this?

1829
02:06:08,542 --> 02:06:09,625
Just look.

1830
02:06:25,667 --> 02:06:26,667
Did you listen to me?

1831
02:06:26,833 --> 02:06:28,292
Your brother is glaring daggers at me.

1832
02:06:28,458 --> 02:06:29,542
I didn't want to come away.

1833
02:06:29,708 --> 02:06:32,167
Your sister was so stubborn, she forced me to get discharged.

1834
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:34,167
Why did you go to the hospital at this hour of the night?

1835
02:06:34,375 --> 02:06:36,833
Will the hospital take care of him better than I will?

1836
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,750
Murali is important to you. My sister is my priority!

1837
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,042
What is this? I saw some other girl.

1838
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:57,208
That is the girl called Selvi I told you about.

1839
02:06:57,375 --> 02:07:00,917
A girl can defeat even a ghost, but the ghost is a girl in this case.

1840
02:07:01,083 --> 02:07:03,333
Why? - She has come for Murali.

1841
02:07:03,542 --> 02:07:05,708
If they unite tonight

1842
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:08,000
she'll stay forever in Madhavi's body.

1843
02:07:08,167 --> 02:07:09,167
That shouldn't happen.

1844
02:07:09,333 --> 02:07:11,458
If you tell Murali about this like you told us

1845
02:07:11,625 --> 02:07:13,458
the danger can be averted, right? - Right.

1846
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:15,042
That will prove as a threat to his life.

1847
02:07:15,208 --> 02:07:20,292
And if she knows that we know, all of us are dead as well.

1848
02:07:20,458 --> 02:07:23,625
I'll go and ask the holy man how to deal with Selvi's spirit.

1849
02:07:23,792 --> 02:07:26,125
Make sure that they don't sleep together until then.

1850
02:07:26,292 --> 02:07:27,542
Why meet this good man?

1851
02:07:27,708 --> 02:07:30,167
Be here with us and we'll deal with it together

1852
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:32,333
and make sure that they don't unite.

1853
02:07:32,583 --> 02:07:35,250
It's a problem even if they don't.

1854
02:07:36,417 --> 02:07:40,167
<i>If I unite with him before the eclipse</i>

1855
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:41,875
<i>then I will be with him forever.</i>

1856
02:07:42,042 --> 02:07:46,417
<i>If we don't, I'll kill Murali before dawn.</i>

1857
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:48,542
<i>We'll experience the life we couldn't</i>

1858
02:07:48,708 --> 02:07:50,417
<i>experience in this world, in the netherworld.</i>

1859
02:07:53,708 --> 02:07:57,458
If what she intends happens, we'll never get back Madhavi.

1860
02:07:57,625 --> 02:08:00,417
My sister's future and Murali's life.

1861
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:01,750
Both are in your hands.

1862
02:08:05,125 --> 02:08:07,542
Boss, shall we roll out the spirit?

1863
02:08:07,708 --> 02:08:09,958
You make it sound like the ghost is a mattress.

1864
02:08:10,125 --> 02:08:12,167
If you poke your nose in a couple's love affair

1865
02:08:12,375 --> 02:08:13,792
couples act devilish.

1866
02:08:13,958 --> 02:08:15,792
Imagine how a spirit would react!

1867
02:08:15,958 --> 02:08:18,333
I wonder how many of us will get a ghastly bruise!

1868
02:08:26,708 --> 02:08:28,667
Tell me. - Sir, I've searched everywhere.

1869
02:08:28,833 --> 02:08:30,708
We've just found this car. There's no one inside.

1870
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:32,958
We've found only a broken cell phone.

1871
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:35,750
You search. I'll come there now.

1872
02:08:35,917 --> 02:08:36,917
What, boss?

1873
02:08:37,083 --> 02:08:39,792
To keep them apart, why are you mixing laxatives to the milk?

1874
02:08:39,958 --> 02:08:43,167
Then should I mix Ponds talcum powder?

1875
02:08:43,375 --> 02:08:47,750
If they drink this, they can spend time only in the bathroom.

1876
02:08:47,958 --> 02:08:50,542
Superb! But I have a doubt. - What?

1877
02:08:50,708 --> 02:08:52,167
Can ghosts get diarrhea? - Good one.

1878
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:54,125
Give this to the ghost and we'll know.

1879
02:08:54,292 --> 02:08:55,458
So many of you are here.

1880
02:08:55,625 --> 02:08:57,042
Why should I be the chosen one?

1881
02:08:57,208 --> 02:08:58,792
Birds of the same feather flock together!

1882
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
So it won't harm you. That's why I chose you.

1883
02:09:00,333 --> 02:09:02,833
I can't go alone. Let's all go together.

1884
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,125
If you don't, I'll give this to your husband.

1885
02:09:06,292 --> 02:09:07,917
He'll bug you by giving this to you as flavored milk.

1886
02:09:08,125 --> 02:09:09,542
What do you say? - No.

1887
02:09:09,708 --> 02:09:11,625
I prefer the ghost. - All the best, aunt.

1888
02:09:12,708 --> 02:09:14,375
Go and give it carefully.

1889
02:09:14,542 --> 02:09:17,625
If she finds out, just run into the garden.

1890
02:09:17,792 --> 02:09:19,708
Good idea. Go with her.

1891
02:09:19,875 --> 02:09:21,708
Grab the spirit's head and have a brawl.

1892
02:09:53,292 --> 02:09:55,917
I've never served milk even to a cat, in my life.

1893
02:09:56,083 --> 02:09:59,208
Now they've chosen me to serve it to a ghost.

1894
02:09:59,708 --> 02:10:01,667
Come, aunt.

1895
02:10:03,292 --> 02:10:05,417
You seem to be really romantic.

1896
02:10:05,583 --> 02:10:08,083
I've been waiting for this day.

1897
02:10:09,458 --> 02:10:11,792
Murali?

1898
02:10:15,708 --> 02:10:19,333
What, aunt? - Drink a glass of milk before you sleep.

1899
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,083
Uncle just gave us milk.

1900
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:23,500
That's plain milk. This is special milk.

1901
02:10:23,667 --> 02:10:24,917
How much milk can we drink?

1902
02:10:25,083 --> 02:10:27,042
Drink it for your aunt's sake.

1903
02:10:27,708 --> 02:10:29,625
Please drink it. - It's okay, no need, aunt.

1904
02:10:29,792 --> 02:10:32,083
Didn't you hear him say 'no need'?

1905
02:10:35,667 --> 02:10:37,375
What happened, aunt?

1906
02:10:37,542 --> 02:10:41,958
Aunt's been behaving strangely ever since uncle hurt his head.

1907
02:10:42,458 --> 02:10:45,292
Sorry. - Come, aunt.

1908
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,542
Milk is been spilt all over your sari, go and change.

1909
02:10:48,708 --> 02:10:50,667
What happened to aunt?

1910
02:11:06,125 --> 02:11:07,917
What happened? Did they drink the milk?

1911
02:11:08,083 --> 02:11:09,333
Is the ghost in the bathroom?

1912
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:10,583
You and your stupid ideas.

1913
02:11:10,750 --> 02:11:13,292
She dropped the glass of milk.

1914
02:11:13,458 --> 02:11:16,208
Such a small task and she messed it up big time!

1915
02:11:17,333 --> 02:11:18,375
What are you looking at?

1916
02:11:18,542 --> 02:11:22,000
You look like a Burma doll with a drained battery!

1917
02:11:44,625 --> 02:11:46,750
God! My chest is paining.

1918
02:11:46,917 --> 02:11:49,333
Is that my aunt? - Murali! Come fast.

1919
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:50,500
Your chest is paining? - Not me.

1920
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:52,625
It's you. Lie down there.

1921
02:11:52,792 --> 02:11:56,875
He's dying of chest pain. - What are you blabbering?

1922
02:11:57,042 --> 02:11:58,708
Is Easu having a heart attack? - Not Easu.

1923
02:11:58,875 --> 02:12:00,292
Our boss! - Boss?

1924
02:12:01,208 --> 02:12:02,792
Don't spoil it. Be quiet.

1925
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:04,542
Shut up. He's dying here.

1926
02:12:04,708 --> 02:12:06,292
And you want me to watch him die?

1927
02:12:06,458 --> 02:12:09,208
Only a chef knows the value of another chef.

1928
02:12:10,458 --> 02:12:14,083
What are you doing? - Mouth to mouth resuscitation.

1929
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:15,542
Even if you gave a flying kiss

1930
02:12:15,708 --> 02:12:18,167
I'd have to clean my face with a disinfectant. A lip to lip!

1931
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:21,500
How did the Burma doll manage to make a baby with you?!

1932
02:12:21,667 --> 02:12:22,750
What happened, aunt?

1933
02:12:22,917 --> 02:12:24,042
Murali, he's suffering from chest pain.

1934
02:12:24,208 --> 02:12:25,917
Lift him, let us take him to the doctor.

1935
02:12:26,083 --> 02:12:27,917
Quick.

1936
02:12:28,167 --> 02:12:32,625
Get him an ECG scan, X-ray, Xerox.. Everything!

1937
02:12:32,792 --> 02:12:36,125
We'll follow you. - We'll take you at once.

1938
02:12:40,292 --> 02:12:42,333
I can't handle this.

1939
02:12:43,708 --> 02:12:47,667
I won't go. I won't come. - Come on.

1940
02:12:47,875 --> 02:12:50,083
Don't spill the beans. Just play it cool.

1941
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:52,167
I won't go. I won't go. - Go.

1942
02:12:55,375 --> 02:12:58,625
I thought it was a chest pain, but it's acidity.

1943
02:12:58,792 --> 02:13:00,542
Let me go and sleep.

1944
02:13:00,708 --> 02:13:02,792
Come inside. Let's go sleep.

1945
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:25,792
After a good deal of introspection

1946
02:13:25,958 --> 02:13:29,000
I let her be with your family under your supervision.

1947
02:13:29,167 --> 02:13:31,250
Because it's the family she has been married into

1948
02:13:31,458 --> 02:13:34,458
she'll never show her true self to them.

1949
02:13:34,625 --> 02:13:38,792
But she won't be patient for too long either.

1950
02:13:40,042 --> 02:13:42,583
This solar eclipse, after 150 years

1951
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:44,250
coincides with 'Mahashivratri'

1952
02:13:44,458 --> 02:13:48,375
the holy night when Lord Shiva married Goddess Parvati.

1953
02:13:48,625 --> 02:13:51,833
At the same time, it's happening during sun rise as well.

1954
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:59,250
At this time, evil forces have greater power than the divine ones.

1955
02:14:02,125 --> 02:14:08,917
No power can separate them if they unite during this time.

1956
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:12,167
That's why she has chosen this day.

1957
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:15,375
How do we stop her, Sage? - There are only 2 ways.

1958
02:14:15,542 --> 02:14:21,875
One, your sister's soul should fight Selvi's spirit and come out.

1959
02:14:22,167 --> 02:14:24,833
That's impossible. - What's the other option?

1960
02:14:25,042 --> 02:14:27,542
To remove the malefic effect, when the 8 goddesses

1961
02:14:27,708 --> 02:14:32,167
are immersed in the waters of Mukkoodal

1962
02:14:32,375 --> 02:14:34,875
you must bring Murali to that spot.

1963
02:14:35,125 --> 02:14:36,875
I'll bring him right now. - Wait!

1964
02:14:37,833 --> 02:14:39,458
It's not that easy.

1965
02:14:39,875 --> 02:14:47,875
The second the solar eclipse starts, her power will just keep multiplying.

1966
02:14:48,917 --> 02:14:50,708
You can't do this alone.

1967
02:14:53,542 --> 02:14:55,375
I will also accompany you.

1968
02:14:55,542 --> 02:14:57,875
Oh God! They've gone into the room again.

1969
02:14:58,208 --> 02:15:00,167
You missed a good chance.

1970
02:15:00,333 --> 02:15:03,375
Was it a chance to eat 'dosa' with cricketer Dhoni?

1971
02:15:03,542 --> 02:15:05,083
The driver of the jeep is a ghost, not Madhavi.

1972
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:06,250
She'd have easily killed me on the way.

1973
02:15:06,417 --> 02:15:09,333
Why are we wasting time? Think of an idea quickly.

1974
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:11,708
That lets you off the hook from thinking, right?

1975
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:23,750
The makeup, jasmine flowers..

1976
02:15:23,917 --> 02:15:26,875
You've turned into a village girl.

1977
02:15:28,375 --> 02:15:30,333
Because you like me this way.

1978
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,708
My nephew will have to live with a ghost forever.

1979
02:15:32,875 --> 02:15:34,875
Do something, Paalsamy.

1980
02:15:35,292 --> 02:15:37,958
Paalsamy is a bad boy.

1981
02:15:38,125 --> 02:15:40,500
Just keep saying this and sit idle.

1982
02:15:40,667 --> 02:15:41,833
I'm going straight into Murali's room.

1983
02:15:42,125 --> 02:15:43,917
Whoever wants to, can come with me.

1984
02:15:44,083 --> 02:15:46,000
I'm not so helpless to send you in alone.

1985
02:15:46,167 --> 02:15:48,667
Let's all go together and attack the ghost.

1986
02:15:48,833 --> 02:15:50,500
But we have to attack carefully.

1987
02:15:50,667 --> 02:15:53,750
Let's collect all the stuff ghosts are scared of.

1988
02:15:53,917 --> 02:15:55,917
Slippers! - Isn't it a good idea?

1989
02:15:56,083 --> 02:15:57,750
I meant it will be scared of slippers. - Very good.

1990
02:15:57,917 --> 02:15:59,000
Next? - God's picture.

1991
02:15:59,167 --> 02:16:00,833
Broomstick. - Vermillion and lemon. - Sacred ash.

1992
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,583
Why wait? Take all the weapons.

1993
02:16:04,792 --> 02:16:06,625
Sir, look there!

1994
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:12,208
Ayyanar?

1995
02:16:14,042 --> 02:16:16,583
Hereafter, no one can separate us.

1996
02:16:22,333 --> 02:16:23,958
Pick him up.

1997
02:16:39,708 --> 02:16:41,208
Aunt?

1998
02:16:41,708 --> 02:16:45,750
Always pick on me to cut the ribbon.

1999
02:17:05,208 --> 02:17:06,792
Stop the car.

2000
02:17:06,958 --> 02:17:08,542
Ayyanar, don't fight us.

2001
02:17:08,708 --> 02:17:10,125
We need to go to the hospital.

2002
02:17:10,292 --> 02:17:12,583
No, I don't need a hospital. Get me to a temple first.

2003
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:14,583
Listen to me. My life is in danger.

2004
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:16,250
Stop the car.

2005
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:25,875
Is Ayyanar out of his mind?

2006
02:17:27,042 --> 02:17:30,500
Where is he?

2007
02:17:35,042 --> 02:17:38,167
Your sister stormed out just like a demented soul.

2008
02:17:38,333 --> 02:17:40,375
Murali has passed away in the bedroom.

2009
02:17:40,542 --> 02:17:42,625
We can't wake him up no matter what we do.

2010
02:17:42,833 --> 02:17:46,500
Ask all of them to leave the house.

2011
02:17:46,708 --> 02:17:48,000
Shall we take Murali as well?

2012
02:17:48,167 --> 02:17:49,625
They can't do that.

2013
02:17:49,792 --> 02:17:51,583
Ask them to leave.

2014
02:17:58,917 --> 02:18:00,625
The solar eclipse has begun.

2015
02:18:01,167 --> 02:18:03,667
We don't have much time.

2016
02:18:03,833 --> 02:18:05,125
We must hurry up.

2017
02:18:47,208 --> 02:18:50,083
No, don't hurt me. Don't do anything to me.

2018
02:18:55,833 --> 02:18:57,500
No don't.

2019
02:19:21,583 --> 02:19:23,875
Come fast. Come.

2020
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,125
She has cast a spell on this boy.

2021
02:19:31,833 --> 02:19:33,542
We must break that spell.

2022
02:19:59,125 --> 02:20:01,125
Sage? - Go!

2023
02:20:09,625 --> 02:20:10,875
What happened, Sage?

2024
02:20:13,875 --> 02:20:15,500
She's coming back here.

2025
02:21:05,875 --> 02:21:07,458
She is here now.

2026
02:22:07,125 --> 02:22:09,375
You asked me to meet you if I loved you, and I did so.

2027
02:22:09,583 --> 02:22:11,958
But you kept me waiting for too long.

2028
02:22:14,458 --> 02:22:16,042
Madhavi!

2029
02:22:29,292 --> 02:22:30,958
Murali, run.

2030
02:22:42,042 --> 02:22:43,500
Sage..

2031
02:22:43,667 --> 02:22:45,792
They won't let us live in peace.

2032
02:22:45,958 --> 02:22:47,583
Let's go.

2033
02:22:47,917 --> 02:22:50,667
<i>The spirit that hounds the palace chambers.</i>

2034
02:22:50,833 --> 02:22:53,417
<i>In a woman like Rama's consort Sita, virtues personified.</i>

2035
02:22:53,583 --> 02:22:56,583
<i>Flesh devourer who possesses to destroy an innocent soul.</i>

2036
02:22:56,750 --> 02:23:00,042
<i>Pray to Shiva, the guardian of the cemetery with devout purity.</i>

2037
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:03,458
<i>To overcome with His might, drive far away the effacers of life.</i>

2038
02:23:03,625 --> 02:23:06,208
<i>Let there be peace, peace and only peace.</i>

2039
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,958
Do you think you can save your sister?

2040
02:23:13,083 --> 02:23:15,417
Ask him to let go of Murali.

2041
02:23:16,625 --> 02:23:18,083
You won't!

2042
02:23:23,917 --> 02:23:24,917
Don't, Madhavi.

2043
02:23:29,625 --> 02:23:33,417
Only if your sister remains alive can she keep him with her.

2044
02:23:34,167 --> 02:23:35,792
Madhavi, what are you doing?

2045
02:23:35,958 --> 02:23:37,500
Madhavi, don't do.

2046
02:23:37,667 --> 02:23:39,583
Don't.. Listen to me.

2047
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:41,042
Madhavi!

2048
02:23:53,833 --> 02:23:56,083
Listen to me! Madhavi, don't!

2049
02:24:15,083 --> 02:24:17,833
We have only 15 minutes left.

2050
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,917
Leave for Mukkoodal with him right now.

2051
02:24:22,292 --> 02:24:24,583
In this state.. - Don't worry.

2052
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:26,250
Nothing will happen to your sister.

2053
02:24:26,417 --> 02:24:29,833
I can help her only till this fire keeps burning.

2054
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,833
Go fast. - Murali, come.

2055
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,042
What about Madhavi?

2056
02:24:33,208 --> 02:24:36,167
Sage will take care of her. We have to go to Mukkoodal.

2057
02:24:45,250 --> 02:24:48,833
"Here comes Periyachi the goddess of fury."

2058
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,833
"Enforcer of the universe shows her picturesque form."

2059
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,583
"Bedecked up with pearls, corals, gems and her sparkling smile."

2060
02:24:56,750 --> 02:25:00,417
"One who feeds on bones.. Destroyer of demons."

2061
02:25:04,542 --> 02:25:08,792
"Goddess covered with vermillion.."

2062
02:25:09,125 --> 02:25:12,958
"Goddess of might, power and omniscience."

2063
02:25:13,167 --> 02:25:14,875
Can you prevent me?

2064
02:25:15,208 --> 02:25:18,792
"Goddess covered with vermillion.."

2065
02:25:18,958 --> 02:25:23,542
"Goddess of might, power and omniscience."

2066
02:25:23,875 --> 02:25:32,042
"Epitome of beauty, strength and destruction."

2067
02:25:34,375 --> 02:25:38,708
"Time for Goddess Shakti to grace us with Her mercy."

2068
02:25:42,833 --> 02:25:47,792
"Ruler who holds a symbol. Rides on a chariot resplendent."

2069
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:55,750
"Anklet tinkling, haunting cemetery. Chamundi.. Goddess of gallantry!"

2070
02:25:55,917 --> 02:26:00,333
"Demolishing enmity and deceit with her weapon.."

2071
02:26:20,250 --> 02:26:24,750
"Empyrean skies is Your sphere.. Earth is Your empathy empire.."

2072
02:26:24,917 --> 02:26:29,000
"Who can oppose this deity? Her eyes are like fish, Meenakshi.."

2073
02:26:29,167 --> 02:26:33,333
"Bathe the sinners in blood.. Slay the sinners of this world.."

2074
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:38,042
"Your hymn will always win.. Releaser of pain and suffering."

2075
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,917
"One who fulfills all vows in light, darkness and shadows."

2076
02:27:05,083 --> 02:27:07,792
"Goddess Kali makes what is sown, grow and blossom."

2077
02:27:07,958 --> 02:27:10,667
"She turns dreams into reality.. Mariamma, goddess of fertility."

2078
02:27:10,833 --> 02:27:13,542
"She makes what is sown, grow and blossom"

2079
02:27:13,708 --> 02:27:16,042
"While chasing the culprit, Goddess Neeliamma rises to the hilt."

2080
02:27:16,167 --> 02:27:18,917
"Alleviating adversity, Goddess Sooliamma offers security."

2081
02:27:19,542 --> 02:27:21,750
"Another avatar of Shakti helps you unravel a mystery."

2082
02:27:21,917 --> 02:27:25,458
"Her devotees, She shelters.. She showers love on them.."

2083
02:27:33,958 --> 02:27:36,083
What will you do now?

2084
02:27:43,667 --> 02:27:45,042
<i>Mukkoodal, 9 kilometers.</i>

2085
02:28:10,417 --> 02:28:13,750
Ravi.. Ravi.. What are you doing?

2086
02:28:36,042 --> 02:28:37,167
Murali, my leg has got stuck.

2087
02:28:48,625 --> 02:28:49,667
Don't do this.

2088
02:28:53,208 --> 02:28:55,333
Madhavi, let him go.

2089
02:28:58,583 --> 02:29:01,333
<i>I still want to give him a child..</i>

2090
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:05,667
<i>Your sister's soul has to fight Selvi's spirit and come out.</i>

2091
02:29:05,833 --> 02:29:07,500
<i>She is expecting a baby.</i>

2092
02:29:07,708 --> 02:29:08,708
<i>Happy?</i>

2093
02:29:09,708 --> 02:29:10,917
Madhavi, come out.

2094
02:29:11,083 --> 02:29:13,750
Otherwise, the child in your womb will become an orphan.

2095
02:29:21,417 --> 02:29:22,583
Yes, Madhavi.

2096
02:29:22,750 --> 02:29:24,792
Doctor had called up and told me so.

2097
02:29:24,958 --> 02:29:27,792
Before I could tell you, you were possessed.

2098
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:09,250
Murali, run!

2099
02:30:10,417 --> 02:30:16,208
"Snakes coiled around her chest. Kathyayini, the warrior goddess.."

2100
02:30:16,375 --> 02:30:19,000
"Sword is the weapon for Goddess Angalamman."

2101
02:30:19,208 --> 02:30:21,917
"Polymorphous Goddess Durga, ferocious in her avatars."

2102
02:30:22,125 --> 02:30:24,833
"Shiva's wife, Goddess Shakti"

2103
02:30:25,125 --> 02:30:27,667
"appears in various avatars to help humanity."

2104
02:30:28,083 --> 02:30:30,833
"Goddess of love and might."

2105
02:30:31,083 --> 02:30:33,875
"Goddess of weapon and snakes."

2106
02:30:34,083 --> 02:30:36,667
"Goddess of flowers and power."

2107
02:30:36,875 --> 02:30:39,500
"Princess of might and elegance."

2108
02:30:39,708 --> 02:30:42,417
"Omnipotent and omniscient."

2109
02:30:42,708 --> 02:30:45,083
"Queen of the universe and beyond."

2110
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:48,167
"Shiva's other half"

2111
02:30:48,333 --> 02:30:51,375
"Goddess Shakti"

2112
02:30:51,583 --> 02:30:55,667
"in various avatars"

2113
02:30:55,875 --> 02:30:59,792
"to help humanity.."

2114
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,250
"As Padmini, Malini, Bhairavi, Nandini, Vaishnavi.."

2115
02:31:04,417 --> 02:31:09,292
"Ragini, Trangini, Eswari, Parameswari.."

2116
02:31:57,625 --> 02:31:59,000
Madhavi!

2117
02:32:54,083 --> 02:32:57,333
This area will turn into gold shortly.

2118
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:59,625
There will be an airport half a kilometer from here.

2119
02:32:59,792 --> 02:33:01,792
One kilometer away, there'll be a harbor.

2120
02:33:01,958 --> 02:33:03,750
Won't the planes clash with the ships?

2121
02:33:03,917 --> 02:33:06,750
There is no sea nearby. You're lying about a harbor.

2122
02:33:06,917 --> 02:33:08,667
As if an airport will be constructed here.

2123
02:33:08,833 --> 02:33:12,250
I have sold illegal land with false documents to many idiots as such.

2124
02:33:12,417 --> 02:33:13,958
Do you want to sell this place?

2125
02:33:14,125 --> 02:33:17,625
I do. Have you ever seen a buyer buy after your sales talks?

2126
02:33:17,792 --> 02:33:20,417
No. - Don't see. Continue.

2127
02:33:20,625 --> 02:33:22,208
If you dig up the soil here

2128
02:33:22,375 --> 02:33:24,042
you will find water just 2 feet deep.

2129
02:33:24,208 --> 02:33:25,333
2 feet?

2130
02:33:25,542 --> 02:33:27,750
Then how can a house be built? - Hey..

2131
02:33:27,917 --> 02:33:30,375
Don't interrupt, man. You're killing my flow.

2132
02:33:30,542 --> 02:33:32,292
What's your problem? - Okay. - Idiot.

2133
02:33:32,458 --> 02:33:33,458
Not just that

2134
02:33:33,583 --> 02:33:36,125
around this area, many schools colleges, hospitals, flyovers..

2135
02:33:36,292 --> 02:33:37,917
They've been struggling for a bus to ply

2136
02:33:38,083 --> 02:33:39,875
for the past 10 years on the roads to the nearest town.

2137
02:33:40,042 --> 02:33:41,083
And this fat light bulb is lying through her teeth.

2138
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:42,250
Don't kill it, Paalsamy.

2139
02:33:42,458 --> 02:33:45,042
Then we won't even get the commission.

2140
02:33:45,208 --> 02:33:48,208
Hey ditcher! How dare you call me by name, without respect!

2141
02:33:48,375 --> 02:33:49,708
I'm not getting any share anyway.

2142
02:33:49,875 --> 02:33:51,250
How does it matter how I call you? - Hey!

2143
02:33:51,417 --> 02:33:52,792
Shall I talk or not?

2144
02:33:52,958 --> 02:33:56,125
Adjust her makeup. - Okay. - You're sweating.

2145
02:33:56,292 --> 02:33:58,792
Look, Paalsamy. - What is it, master?

2146
02:33:58,958 --> 02:34:00,292
I'll give you one week's time.

2147
02:34:00,458 --> 02:34:03,083
If you don't sell it by then, there's a buyer in Mumbai.

2148
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:04,708
Don't be in a rush.

2149
02:34:04,917 --> 02:34:07,667
With the commission I am about to make, I must pay back their loans.

2150
02:34:07,833 --> 02:34:08,917
Get it organized fast.

2151
02:34:09,083 --> 02:34:11,750
Instead of me becoming a millionaire by revealing my grandma's secret

2152
02:34:11,917 --> 02:34:14,542
I've been made to chase my money like an agent.

2153
02:34:14,708 --> 02:34:17,417
Don't worry, Paalsamy. I'll give you my share.

2154
02:34:17,583 --> 02:34:18,917
How do you get a share?

2155
02:34:19,083 --> 02:34:20,375
If I hook up with someone who owns the property

2156
02:34:20,583 --> 02:34:22,583
I get to co-own it.

2157
02:34:22,750 --> 02:34:24,667
He's showing off rubbing salt on to my wounds.

2158
02:34:24,833 --> 02:34:27,750
You've not just saved my sister, but you've helped me

2159
02:34:27,917 --> 02:34:28,917
get Maya as well.

2160
02:34:29,083 --> 02:34:30,458
Me? - Yes.

2161
02:34:30,625 --> 02:34:33,000
I was helping you out with your problems on love, and I found my life partner.

2162
02:34:33,167 --> 02:34:34,167
That's why.

2163
02:34:34,333 --> 02:34:35,917
My share will be yours.

2164
02:34:36,083 --> 02:34:37,583
Do you want some juice, boss?

2165
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:39,750
How low can you stoop?

2166
02:34:40,292 --> 02:34:41,917
I won! I won!

2167
02:34:42,417 --> 02:34:44,375
Why is he playing?

2168
02:34:44,542 --> 02:34:46,292
I won. - What's the matter?

2169
02:34:46,458 --> 02:34:48,708
He saw me packing my bags and everything.

2170
02:34:48,875 --> 02:34:51,250
He thought I was going to stay in a hostel and study.

2171
02:34:51,417 --> 02:34:54,667
And he tied the nuptial thread again In haste.

2172
02:34:55,292 --> 02:34:56,667
Don't be too hasty, master.

2173
02:34:56,833 --> 02:34:58,458
Your sister is now an adult.

2174
02:34:58,625 --> 02:35:00,000
Now you can't do anything to me.

2175
02:35:00,208 --> 02:35:02,333
Easu, boil some milk for me.

2176
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:05,833
Why would you boil milk in a broken down bungalow? - Go.
