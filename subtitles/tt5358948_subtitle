1
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:58,684
It's said that human body cells
change in every seven years.

2
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:02,101
That means he changes completely.

3
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:06,392
But sometimes a person needs
only few days to change.

4
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:08,434
Or maybe just one night.

5
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,559
Like the way I changed.

6
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,392
How? Why?

7
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,976
I didn't get a chance to ask that.

8
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:29,982
I am on my way. - So what are your
plans after the Fashion-Week?

9
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:31,062
I am so excited.

10
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:32,600
I am feeling awesome right now.

11
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,062
Hi. - Hey gorgeous.

12
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:35,446
Yeah, one sec.. - She's too good,
she's fantastic.

13
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:36,892
Get back to you.

14
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:38,518
Sir, you ready?

15
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:40,308
Okay, okay, coming.
- Please come.

16
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:50,517
"One night on a.."

17
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,892
"One night on a.." - Urvil.

18
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:53,767
Urvil.

19
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:57,395
Let's go. - Huh?

20
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,437
Where are you lost?
- Nothing, let's go.

21
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,517
We've much to do.
Let's get to work. Okay.

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
I'll go check the settings.

23
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,296
Dilip, check the
lights at the reception.

24
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:05,517
Sir. - Yeah

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,850
Models are ready,
they are in position.

26
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,475
Okay, perfect.
Just give me two minutes. - Okay.

27
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:11,683
Okay, cameras 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6..all set?

28
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,642
Okay, come on guys, this is
the moment we've been waiting for.

29
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,017
Let's give Rosy a show
she will never forget.

30
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,208
Okay, Jib 2..pan to the left.
Zoom in a bit.

31
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,017
Camera 4. Camera 4.
- Yes Sir.

32
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,350
The girl in the red scarf.
- Yes Sir.

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,642
Zoom in. Zoom in.

34
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:37,979
Any other angle. - No sir.

35
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,975
Let it be.

36
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:41,392
Let's focus on the show.

37
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:49,142
Camera 1..Camera 1..hold it.
Right there. Nice.

38
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,225
Slow. Nice and proper.

39
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:55,475
That's it.

40
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:58,142
Okay, now camera 3.

41
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,350
Zoom in a bit.

42
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,100
You missed her again.

43
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:13,350
Okay, guys. This is the important
shot. Close of the event.

44
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:17,475
Let's put our hands together
for the talented Rosy..

45
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,183
I don't want any surprises.

46
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,225
Very nice.
Now pull out slowly.

47
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,850
A big round of applause.

48
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,558
Okay, guys. That was a good show.
Let's keep it up.

49
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:37,683
And this would not have
been possible without you'll.

50
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,308
Where did she go?

51
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,282
The party last night was awesome.

52
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:24,209
Of course. It was fun.

53
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,714
Urvil was with that model.

54
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:27,668
That's nothing new.

55
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:29,141
She gave me the wrong number.

56
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:31,697
This is enough for him.

57
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:33,092
Where's Urvil?

58
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,538
He must be busy.

59
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,262
Morning, guys.
- There he is.

60
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:37,911
What's up?

61
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,786
Hey, Urvil.
- How's everyone doing?

62
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:40,786
So early.

63
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:42,705
It's only 4pm.

64
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,035
What were you doing so late?

65
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:46,921
What do you think?
What do you think?

66
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,459
Waiter, one beer please.

67
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,032
I get so tired, and you..
- Boy, you need this.

68
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,277
Really?

69
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,620
You can thank me later.

70
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:59,963
Okay, guys..time for a toast.

71
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:00,838
Dilip..

72
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:01,713
Azad..

73
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:02,588
And to Sid.

74
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,104
And to Urvil.
- Thank you.

75
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:05,629
Cheers.
- The machine.

76
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,004
Cheers.
- And the boss.

77
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,629
Perfect cure for a hangover.

78
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:15,046
Sid..

79
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,213
Boy..

80
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:17,754
Sid.. - Yeah.

81
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:18,769
Stop staring.

82
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:20,825
She wants to be alone, let her be.

83
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,754
But, I..

84
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:24,046
Really? - Yeah.

85
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,669
As if you never hit on
a girl that's drinking alone.

86
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:31,171
Look..I never impose on anyone.

87
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:32,004
Okay.

88
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,921
Look, you can tell from
a girl's body language..

89
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,213
..what she wants.

90
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:39,421
So..what does she want?

91
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:42,178
Well..she's here
with her boyfriend..

92
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,379
..but if I give her my number, she'll
call as soon as she gets home.

93
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:48,629
Really?
- Really.

94
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:54,754
Urvil. Let see you hit on her.

95
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,092
I don't want to.
- How about for 1000 rupees.

96
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,713
You know what, 5000.
- Done.

97
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:09,796
Done?
- Done.

98
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,705
Keep the money ready.
- Relax, I got this.

99
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:13,879
Okay. All the best.

100
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:46,963
Hi.

101
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,454
Okay, I am going to
get straight to the point.

102
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,822
My friend's interested in you.
- Oh, really.

103
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:53,088
He would like to buy you a drink.

104
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:54,921
So I am sending him here.

105
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,713
Which friend?
- The one in blue shirt.

106
00:07:58,004 --> 00:07:58,713
Specs.

107
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,213
There goes my 5000.

108
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,213
He's a bit shy.

109
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,879
How sweet. I am not interested.

110
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,463
Okay, how about this?
How about you leave him a message..

111
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:12,421
..so that at least
he doesn't feel bad.

112
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:14,796
Okay.

113
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:19,254
Tell him that he's very sweet.

114
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:23,273
But his choice..is very bad.

115
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,879
Oh come on, you're not that bad.

116
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,588
Thanks,
I wasn't referring to myself..

117
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,296
..I meant his friend.

118
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:34,254
Poor guy..

119
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:38,416
Does he even know his friend's using
his name to pick up a girl?

120
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,338
Nope. But even if he did..

121
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,504
..I don't think he would mind.

122
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,546
By the way, how much is the bet for?

123
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:49,338
5000!

124
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:52,046
5000!

125
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:55,088
But I guess I should've bet more.

126
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:58,046
So you've a habit of gambling.

127
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,629
No! of winning.

128
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:02,421
No chance.

129
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:06,629
Look, I know you don't
want to waste your time..

130
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,171
..but, can you take a
little longer to reject me?

131
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,046
What are they talking about?

132
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,838
Must be trying to convince her.
What else?

133
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:15,588
Awesome.

134
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,171
Urvil, by the way.

135
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:21,796
If I shake hands,
your friends will think you won.

136
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:23,671
They didn't shake hands.
They didn't shake hands.

137
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:27,421
Smart.

138
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:30,879
And if you tell me your name,
I will think I won.

139
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,213
Will you split the bet money with me?

140
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:34,921
You know what?

141
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:37,171
You've just become
my most favorite person.

142
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,546
In the whole wide world.

143
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:39,713
Done!

144
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:44,824
Don't worry,
we've all lost bets to him.

145
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,393
You didn't tell me your name.

146
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,046
What's in the name?

147
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,091
Aadhaar card. Ration card.
License. Passport, visa.

148
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:52,129
Everything.

149
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,299
You see,
if you don't tell me your name..

150
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,921
..I can't get a tattoo
with your name.

151
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:59,463
It's Celina.
- Celina.

152
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:01,796
Well, it's an honor
to meet you Celina.

153
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:07,088
What does Urvil mean?
- Sea.

154
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,796
Sea..
- And Celina means the sky.

155
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,054
They never meet.

156
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,181
Look out there.

157
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:18,088
What do you see?

158
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:19,796
Away from our sights..

159
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:22,088
.. the sea and the sky meet.

160
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,463
Like us.

161
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:27,338
Where they meet..

162
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,213
..the world ends.

163
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:35,546
Are you always this romantic?
- Always!

164
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:49,874
"The fingers..touched
an unknown dream."

165
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:59,351
"Why did my desires..wake up today?"

166
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:04,046
"This is a new restlessness."

167
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:08,980
"A new obsession."

168
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:18,760
"Where's my..heart taking me?"

169
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:27,629
"Where's my..heart taking me?"

170
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:32,254
I don't remember the
last time I drank so much.

171
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,838
My dear,
when in Phuket, just f***it.

172
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:36,671
What's there? Come on, drink up.

173
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:38,004
Come on, Drink. Drink.

174
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,171
Cheers.

175
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:44,004
I completely forgot.

176
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:46,171
The bet money.

177
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,164
For saving my honor
in front of my friends.

178
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:52,058
You haven't won yet.

179
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:57,713
Well played.

180
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,713
You know, you look so
beautiful when you laugh.

181
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,754
Another line.
- Absolutely true.

182
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:17,444
I would never lie to a
beautiful girl and insult her.

183
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,171
You think you know everything
about women, don't you?

184
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,296
Celina, your hair.

185
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,379
Urvil, please.

186
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:31,588
Give a break to your one-liners.

187
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:33,171
Okay, no problem.

188
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:36,456
But your hair's drinking wine.

189
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,930
Ohhh..

190
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:10,439
"We just met..and
walked a few steps."

191
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:19,463
"How did we..come this close?"

192
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:29,938
"We just met..and
walked a few steps."

193
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:38,522
"How did we..come this close?"

194
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:43,568
"Is this true..or my imagination."

195
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:48,370
"I have no clue."

196
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:57,770
"Where's my..heart taking me?"

197
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:05,504
"Where's my..heart taking me?"

198
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:14,963
"Where's my..heart taking me?"

199
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:23,796
"Where's my..heart taking me?"

200
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,838
Urvil.

201
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:35,004
Are you ready yet?

202
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:38,266
Open the door. - Urvil.
- We'll miss the flight.

203
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,197
Hello.

204
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,316
Urvil.

205
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,504
Coming.

206
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,421
See, I told you.
- You're not ready yet.

207
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,921
Sorry, I just overslept.

208
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:48,713
Urvil. - What's this?

209
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:51,254
The bet money.
- No, no, keep it.

210
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:52,713
But..
- No, keep it.

211
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:54,796
You guys go check-out,
I'll go change.

212
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,629
Please hurry up.

213
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:56,838
Wait, wait, wait..
- What?

214
00:14:57,084 --> 00:15:00,088
Is she still..
- Just go, take him away.

215
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,549
I'm here.

216
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:20,629
Celina.

217
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,736
She left without telling me.

218
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,610
Hey, Sid. How was it the first time?

219
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,848
Just keep up the good work in
future too. - Thank you.

220
00:15:58,928 --> 00:15:59,886
Urvil, do you remember.

221
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,355
After the party that night,
his dance.

222
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,353
Alright. Just a second.

223
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,771
Hello
- Yeah, babe.

224
00:16:05,855 --> 00:16:07,480
Where are you.
- Just two minute, coming out.

225
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:09,146
Okay.
- Bye.

226
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:10,650
What were you saying?

227
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,438
Let's take a prepaid taxi.

228
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,814
Everyone's making a nice buck,
and you want to take a prepaid taxi.

229
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,105
Then drop us home.
- You're saying that.

230
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,221
We're tired.
- How can you be like Urvil?

231
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:21,730
Okay, duty calls.
One second.

232
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,063
How are you? Sorry.
Flight was delayed.

233
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:24,712
Welcome back.

234
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,353
Simran's here too. I didn't know.

235
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,526
Hi, Simran. How are you?
- I am good.

236
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,063
Hello. - Hi.

237
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:32,771
Is this all the
hospitality we'll get..

238
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,028
..or are you ever
going to invite us home?

239
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:34,813
Sure.

240
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,938
Fix it up with Urvil.
- We will.

241
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,458
By the way, Sim. Meet Sid.

242
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,313
He joined Event Craft last week.

243
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,824
Hi.
- Sid, this is Simran. My wife.

244
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,516
Okay, guys. It's getting late.
- See you.

245
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,058
Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

246
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,433
What can be done? What's there is there.
- We have to do it.

247
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:51,716
Urvil's married.

248
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,728
It's been 5 years.

249
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:56,308
Just because he's taken,
doesn't mean he can't binge.

250
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,391
Let's go.
- Come on.

251
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,833
What happened?
- What?

252
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,708
Look at your face?

253
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,958
Didn't you get some sleep?

254
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,583
You ask too many questions.

255
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,625
I am okay.

256
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:10,021
Hey..

257
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,064
Sorry. Just a bit tired.

258
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,666
You understand, don't you?

259
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:14,666
I know.

260
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,416
So..what should we do?

261
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,041
Cancel the party?

262
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:22,750
S*** I completely forgot.

263
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:24,875
Sorry, you had to do everything,
didn't you?

264
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,449
Like you help me a lot.

265
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,672
True. - Anyway, David's coming.

266
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:30,788
Oh, David's coming. Great.
- Yeah.

267
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,561
Awesome, tonight's going to be fun.

268
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,774
Urvil, how about that one.

269
00:17:39,854 --> 00:17:40,791
The one at the
office..with the parrot.

270
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,229
Are you crazy, my wife's here?
- What's he saying?

271
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,080
Once there was a parrot..
- Hello, guys.

272
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hi.
- Hello.

273
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:51,012
Who invited her?
- Don't know.

274
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:56,632
Everyone in the office..had
their eyes on Urvil.

275
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,998
I am sorry.
- But you..snatched him.

276
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:07,458
I'll serve dinner.
- Yes.

277
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,628
Wait, I'll help you.

278
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:10,625
Urvil.

279
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,875
Sim..I am so sorry.
- For what.

280
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:15,625
That Tanya.

281
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:18,083
Her marriage's going
through lot of problems.

282
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,666
I thought if she joins us..

283
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,104
..she'll feel a little distracted.

284
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,958
But.. - It's okay, Jo.
I understand.

285
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,125
I just feel a little bad for her.

286
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:28,583
Yeah.

287
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:29,416
Anyway.

288
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:31,832
Come down, guys,
food's been served.

289
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,771
Stop it.

290
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:37,875
Amazing, Simran.

291
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,208
Simply amazing.

292
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:40,873
Yeah, Simran.

293
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,128
You cook so well..that
we face problems later.

294
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,954
Enough, stop praising me.

295
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,837
So Simran..you don't work anymore.

296
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:54,272
I still work..it's
not a job anymore.

297
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:58,079
After shifting to Pune,
I quit my job.

298
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:00,954
Nowadays I take small
cooking orders from home.

299
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,176
Wow!

300
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:07,287
That means you've devoted
your entire life to Urvil.

301
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:12,640
But I am happy..with
my typical housewife life.

302
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:15,579
Look, you're not
typical..nor is your life.

303
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,412
You're the most special,
beautiful woman I know.

304
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,079
Yeah.

305
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,204
So sweet.

306
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,041
Here's to the youngest
Head of Operations..

307
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,412
..Event Craft Media.
- Thank you.

308
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,662
Absolutely.. - Urvil Raisingh
and his gorgeous first lady..

309
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:29,579
Simran.

310
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,287
Cheers!

311
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,041
To all of you.

312
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,079
Intense romance, huh!
- Stop it.

313
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,329
Couldn't take your
eyes off and all, huh!

314
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,912
Mushy-mushy.

315
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,121
When did it all change, Urvil?

316
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:44,204
What do you mean?

317
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:48,690
David, I love Simran.

318
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,746
I always did..and I still do.

319
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:52,912
That's not the question..
- But my answer is still the same.

320
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:55,204
I only love Simran.

321
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:59,412
Did I ever leave
any dearth in her life?

322
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,079
I mean you met her tonight.

323
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:02,496
You saw how happy she was.

324
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:03,954
What else does she want?

325
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,371
You don't get it, Urvil.

326
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,162
Come on.

327
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,537
Have you ever thought..

328
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,454
..what will happen
to her when she finds out?

329
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,209
David, she won't find out.

330
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,371
Because I won't let it happen, okay.

331
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:17,621
Look, whatever I
do outside the house..

332
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,287
..I don't let it in this house.

333
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,041
These things don't
seek permission..

334
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,802
..before entering your home.

335
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:29,982
You really think that you
understand women really well.

336
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:34,233
'I will never lie to a
beautiful woman and insult her.'

337
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:37,829
'You think you know everything
about women, don't you?'

338
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,801
Urvil. Urvil.

339
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,401
Urvil. - Yeah.

340
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,662
Where are you lost?

341
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:46,287
Just had a long day.

342
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,329
David.

343
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,079
Shall we go? - Let's go.

344
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:51,688
I'll have to eat
once I get home as well.

345
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:52,329
What?

346
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:05,079
For you.
- Thank you.

347
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:07,162
At least take a look.

348
00:21:07,496 --> 00:21:08,787
Even I want to see, come on.

349
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,579
Wow!

350
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:16,041
So? Like it?
- It's lovely.

351
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:16,954
Yeah.

352
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,996
But why do you get me these gifts?
- What do you mean?

353
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,871
I don't want these gifts.
- Then what do you want?

354
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:25,666
I want you.

355
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,079
I am always yours.

356
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,815
'You won the bet..not my shirt.'

357
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,326
'Come on, take it off.'

358
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,929
'You know, I love the sea.'

359
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,079
'Is that why you liked me.'

360
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:57,736
'Hang on..you liked me.'

361
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,066
'Look..there's no way to prove..'

362
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,358
'..whether the sky saw the
sea first, or was it the sea.'

363
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,525
'You know,
even you're like the ocean.'

364
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,750
'Calm..beautiful.'

365
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:14,233
'But hiding many storms inside.'

366
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,983
'Not a storm..I'm like the waves.'

367
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:19,108
'Someday I'll flow away.'

368
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:20,838
'I won't let you.'

369
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,775
'How can you stop water?'

370
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,191
'Then I'll flow away with you.'

371
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:30,733
'Who knows, maybe I'll
feel at peace when I drown.'

372
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,316
Shut up.

373
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,816
Good morning.
- Good morning.

374
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,566
Coffee?

375
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:09,566
Hey sleepyhead.

376
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,608
Wake up.

377
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:15,983
I've heard that coffee
speeds up your metabolism.

378
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:17,150
So?

379
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,915
So why don't we take advantage
of this speed up metabolism.

380
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:24,566
I see..

381
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:29,233
I was wondering..why coffee's
being served on bed today.

382
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,398
You thinking about
starting a family huh?

383
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:34,608
So let's practice.

384
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:36,066
So selfless.

385
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:38,358
You know what, coffee can wait..

386
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:39,681
I can't.

387
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,233
Simran, where are my keys?

388
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,961
Sim..

389
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:49,733
Keys? Keys?

390
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:51,066
Give me.

391
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,903
Thank you so much,
you have a good day.

392
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:54,918
Okay. Bye.

393
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:55,983
Bye.

394
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,316
I want some yummy food at night.
- Yeah.

395
00:23:58,525 --> 00:23:59,316
See you.

396
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:05,526
Good morning, Santosh.
- Good morning, sir.

397
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,971
Good morning, Sid. How are you?
- Hi, Good morning.

398
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:09,017
Good morning.
- Good morning sir.

399
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:11,650
Good morning, Deepa.
- Good morning.

400
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:12,903
How are you?
- I am well.

401
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,858
I heard that your event went really well.
- Yes, it did.

402
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:17,733
Well, tell Sid to send
the presentation to me. - Okay.

403
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:19,316
I want to see it before Walia's
meeting. - I'll be on that.

404
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,900
Don't forget.
- Right away.

405
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,608
Urvil, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes, of course. Come in.

406
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:34,483
Thanks.

407
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:38,051
Urvil, since you've
been promoted now..

408
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:42,108
..so how about my
salary increment..

409
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,701
How about that corner office too?

410
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,691
If you insist.

411
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,094
I'll talk to HR.
- Okay.

412
00:24:48,174 --> 00:24:48,983
Okay.
- Thanks.

413
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:49,816
Welcome.

414
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:56,013
Yeah?

415
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,278
Good morning, Urvil.
- Good morning, sir.

416
00:24:58,358 --> 00:25:00,150
How are you?
- I am very well.

417
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,486
You back at work?
- Yes, sir.

418
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,108
I think you need a break.
- Not really, sir.

419
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:05,858
Sit down, sit down.
- No, no, I am fine, thank you.

420
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,733
Well, actually I wanted
to congratulate you.

421
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:10,587
I've got some excellent feedback
from Rosy about our event.

422
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,233
Keep it up.
- I plan to sir.

423
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:13,236
Take that break, okay.

424
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:14,025
Have a good day.

425
00:25:53,983 --> 00:26:03,208
"Just like the waves..life
just flowed away."

426
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:08,186
"I was lost somewhere."

427
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,153
"Only you remained constant."

428
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:16,983
"Is this..the journey.."

429
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:21,694
"..from the body to the soul?"

430
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:26,775
Deepa. - Yes, Urvil.

431
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,038
I want all the photos
from Rosy's event.

432
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:29,766
I'll get them for you.

433
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:30,781
Thank you.
- Bye.

434
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:36,483
Yeah, come in.

435
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:38,904
Yes, Sid. What can I do for you?

436
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:41,415
You asked for the presentation.
- Yeah, just leave that over here.

437
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:42,733
I'll check it out, thanks.

438
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:45,662
So..did you see the
photographs on Facebook?

439
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,233
Actually..I didn't get
a chance to see it.

440
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,387
I'll check it out soon.

441
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:55,190
Urvil, can I ask you something?
- Yes, tell me.

442
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,524
You're.. You know..
- What?

443
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:59,857
Why didn't you appoint
some hot secretary?

444
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,710
Sid, you want to move ahead,
right? - Yeah.

445
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:05,440
Then take my advice.

446
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:08,107
Sexy secretary
meaning temptation.

447
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:11,732
Temptation meaning
complication.

448
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:14,224
Trust me..highly avoidable.

449
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,690
Okay, now let's do some work.
- Yes.

450
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:18,024
Sit down.
Let's go through this together.

451
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:19,774
Give me this file.
- Yes.

452
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,107
This is slide no. 2.

453
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,440
'Why do you always
stay behind the camera?'

454
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,857
'What do you mean?'
- 'I mean look at you..'

455
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:00,274
'..you should be in front of it.'

456
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:03,607
'No really, I mean it.'

457
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,107
'Come, let's take a picture.'

458
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:09,899
'What?'

459
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,607
'I hate selfies.'

460
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:12,620
'But why?'

461
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:14,732
'I mean there are very
few moments in life..'

462
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:16,274
'..that are worth capturing.'

463
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:19,440
'Can you capture this?'

464
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:26,524
'Will you remember..or
will you forget?'

465
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,232
'Never.'

466
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:34,440
I still can't forget.

467
00:28:35,524 --> 00:28:38,524
"I am still alive.."

468
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:42,472
"I'm obsessed with making you mine.."

469
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,024
Change your clothes,
I'll serve dinner. - Okay.

470
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:33,440
Urvil. Urvil.

471
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,274
You haven't changed yet.

472
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:38,107
Food's ready. Come on.

473
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,515
You know, Tanya's moved in
with Jyoti for a while.

474
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,247
Tanya and her husband
had a big fight.

475
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:03,565
And apparently..her
husband's having an affair.

476
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:05,815
When Tanya confronted him..

477
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,232
..he yelled at her instead.

478
00:30:07,312 --> 00:30:08,659
And also assaulted her.

479
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,815
What an ass*** he is.

480
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:15,024
Sounds like some daily soap's recap.

481
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,474
Why are you so worried?

482
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,770
Its Tanya's problem,
she'll handle it, right?

483
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:23,815
How can you say that?

484
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:25,357
We're friends.

485
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,107
And..what if you find
out that I am cheating on you?

486
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,982
What?

487
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:31,899
Are you crazy?

488
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,653
Blabbering nonsense.
- I was just..

489
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,232
This is a stupid conversation.

490
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:38,397
Why would you have
an affair with someone?

491
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:40,749
Someone else is having a crisis..

492
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,003
..and you're using
our life as an example.

493
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,374
And suddenly Tanya's
become your best friend.

494
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:45,278
You always ruin my
mood before sleeping.

495
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:47,416
Okay, I am sorry..

496
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:48,458
I was just..

497
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:54,041
You're still possessive about me..
- Simran, it's not funny, okay.

498
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,374
Don't get angry.

499
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,166
I love you.

500
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,583
I love you too.

501
00:31:08,614 --> 00:31:09,624
Hi handsome.

502
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:14,124
Hi Urvil.
- Hey, Paras.

503
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,458
Aren't you getting late now?
- I've to get to work.

504
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,229
Yeah. I will see you later.
- Alright.

505
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:25,272
Bye.

506
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:42,666
Celina?

507
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,921
Celina!

508
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,583
Celina.

509
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,391
Come on..get going.
- Fine, I am going.

510
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,419
Celina. In Pune.

511
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:02,634
Can't be..

512
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:08,668
What if it was her?

513
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:14,211
Urvil.
- What?

514
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,003
Sid says he wants to discuss..

515
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:20,253
..the jewelry event with you.

516
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,211
So should I send him in?
- Not now.

517
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:22,920
Not now.

518
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:27,670
Ohhh.. and yes!

519
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:29,961
Simran's asked me
to remind you..

520
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:32,711
..that her charity
bake sale event is today.

521
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:33,920
Are you done reminding me?

522
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:35,795
Thank you?
Now go.

523
00:32:39,878 --> 00:32:40,836
Deepa, listen.
- Yes.

524
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,878
Deepa..I'm just having
an off day, sorry.

525
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:52,211
I just love this white
and pink combination.

526
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,067
Just like you and Urvil.
Huh?

527
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:58,725
By the way, when is Urvil coming?
- I don't know.

528
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,503
I've messaged him.

529
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,045
And also asked Deepa
to remind him.

530
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:05,420
Well guys, this jewelry
launch means a lot to us.

531
00:33:05,628 --> 00:33:06,628
All the VIPS in the
city will be attending..

532
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:07,465
See you guys, bye.

533
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:09,465
Hey, Urvil..what are
you still doing here?

534
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:10,503
Working.

535
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:12,586
Simran's bake sale? - Ohhh..

536
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,128
Why do you make her wait?

537
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:15,378
You go, I'll wrap
this up and join you.

538
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,354
Please, hurry up.
- Okay, I'll see you guys soon.

539
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:17,290
Bye, guys.

540
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,878
As I was saying, you handle F&B.
- Yeah.

541
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:22,878
Lucky a** he is, seriously.

542
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,423
He just got promoted..

543
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,086
..and got such a undemanding wife.

544
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,086
What else does he want?

545
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:30,420
He must be happy?
- Yes, he is happy.

546
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:32,753
Simran.

547
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,464
Urvil was being so
romantic the other day.

548
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:38,586
I'm sure he didn't let you sleep.
- Shut up.

549
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:40,567
You were just saying
there's so much work.

550
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:41,586
Come on, work.

551
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,545
So this is important.

552
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,711
Tell me.

553
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,503
Okay.

554
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:49,086
Look at this.
He gave me this.

555
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,003
Wow!

556
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:53,634
Pretty, right?
- This is very beautiful.

557
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:55,836
But this wasn't my question.

558
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,961
Don't try to dodge my question.

559
00:33:57,211 --> 00:34:01,132
Diya! - Fine. Don't tell me.

560
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:17,253
'Where are you from?'

561
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,119
'Asking the sky for an address?'

562
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:22,086
'What do you do?'

563
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:23,226
'Let me guess..'

564
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:24,628
'Are you a photographer?'

565
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,253
'You ask too many questions.'

566
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,465
'It's because you
don't answer them.'

567
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,187
'What will you do with the answers?'

568
00:34:59,378 --> 00:35:00,628
Here you go.
- Thank you.

569
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:01,836
And.. - Here.

570
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,170
Yeah..bag.

571
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:05,253
Those macaroons also look nice.

572
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,336
Will you pack those too, please.
- Sure.

573
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,003
Those are for Urvil.

574
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:09,545
Sorry, sold out.

575
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,253
It's okay.
- Come again.

576
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:12,545
I kept those for Urvil.

577
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,711
She kept those for Urvil.

578
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,295
Oh God, it's too late.

579
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:16,170
Is he coming?

580
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:18,336
Must be stuck in some important work.
He'll be here soon.

581
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:21,211
No need to worry.

582
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:22,586
Just call him and ask where he is.

583
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,961
Call up. - Okay.

584
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:28,462
Listen, please let me eat one.
Please.

585
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,525
David.

586
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,114
He's not picking up.

587
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:33,295
I told you.

588
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,253
Okay..can I just have one?
- No.

589
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,670
Let's pack now.
- Let me eat one.

590
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:41,211
You have to drop me home.
Help me.

591
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:42,747
Okay, let's pack.

592
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:44,420
I'll eat one.

593
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:45,670
Stop.

594
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,586
Sim..sorry.

595
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:58,670
You know you're very clever.

596
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,476
Because whenever you're angry..

597
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,378
..you never show it or assert it.

598
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,128
This doubles my guilt.

599
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,211
First for making a mistake..

600
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,836
..and the other for your silence.

601
00:36:19,503 --> 00:36:20,378
Hey..

602
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:23,878
Okay.

603
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:30,211
I've taken the day off tomorrow.

604
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:32,711
Let's spend the day together.

605
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:34,586
Shopping.

606
00:36:35,753 --> 00:36:37,295
Trying to cajole
me because your guilty.

607
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:40,211
No.. Celebrating our anniversary.

608
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,253
You remembered.

609
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:43,336
How about we start day afters
celebrations from tomorrow?

610
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:44,753
But you should've come.

611
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,798
I know.
- I made your favorite macaroons.

612
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,503
Hey..I am sorry.

613
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:50,711
Next time, okay.

614
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,878
I missed those.
- As if I would let you.

615
00:36:55,003 --> 00:36:55,711
What do you mean?

616
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:00,711
Oh my..God! Are you serious?

617
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:06,795
You know what..

618
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,961
Thank God I didn't
turn up today. - Why?

619
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:11,045
Otherwise I couldn't
have eaten macaroons like this.

620
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:12,586
One more bite.

621
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:13,855
Me too.

622
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:23,253
I don't like people..

623
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,253
..who aren't excited
about their anniversary.

624
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,128
I think it's a big deal.

625
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,420
Anniversary!

626
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:30,003
Our special day.

627
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:30,753
I know.

628
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,503
So, what do you want?

629
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:36,503
That you wear this
on our anniversary.

630
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:38,711
Don't change the topic.

631
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,336
We're talking about your gift.

632
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:42,545
Well, that's you, na!
- I see.

633
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:43,836
Come on, now go change.

634
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:45,211
Come on, come on, go quickly.

635
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,128
Wow, nice choice.

636
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:06,182
My husband and you
have the same choice.

637
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:07,920
It's our fifth anniversary..

638
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:09,340
..so he chose this for me.
- Congrats.

639
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,665
But last piece.

640
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:15,378
In that case, you take this one.

641
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,465
I think it will fit you better.
- No!

642
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,753
It's looking really nice on you.

643
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:19,961
It's perfect fit.

644
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,336
You know, it's not necessary..

645
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,235
..that you buy every
dress that fits you.

646
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:28,795
I saw it..tried it..but that's it.

647
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:31,253
You should buy it.
- Are you sure?

648
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:33,878
Yes. Happy Anniversary.

649
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:35,628
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

650
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:45,711
Urvil.

651
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:48,295
Wow!

652
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:49,632
You're looking amazing.

653
00:38:49,712 --> 00:38:50,940
Come on, we're taking it.
- Sure?

654
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:52,503
Done.
- Okay.

655
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,503
You know..there was this girl,
and she was wearing the same dress.

656
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,014
Really?

657
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:01,586
And when my dress didn't fit,
she gave me hers.

658
00:39:02,502 --> 00:39:04,378
I guess the dress was
destined for me.

659
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:05,795
How sweet of her.

660
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:06,711
Thank you so much.

661
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,503
How much? - 15,000.

662
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:10,586
15,000! - You sure?

663
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:12,211
It's okay. Come on.

664
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,567
Are you happy shopping?
Do you want to shop some more?

665
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,378
No.

666
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:20,836
I really loved it.

667
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,237
Are you sure? Happy?
- I really enjoyed.

668
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:23,586
Good.

669
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,086
Listen, that's the
girl who gave me her dress.

670
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:29,253
Hi.

671
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:32,628
Shall we go for dinner?

672
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,170
David and Diya will be there soon.

673
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:35,503
Let's go.

674
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:39,482
Due to Urvil's guilt,
we're celebrating two days this time.

675
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,086
That's food..and that's drink.

676
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,429
There you go.

677
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:45,638
So Tanya has shifted in with Jyoti.

678
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,128
But Tanya is right, Diya.

679
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:52,136
Urvil, are you okay.

680
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:53,586
Urvil.

681
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:56,295
And now when she's
asking for divorce..

682
00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:57,961
..he's refusing alimony.
- What?

683
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,228
If I was in her place..I would've..

684
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,603
Simran, why would
you be in her shoes?

685
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,353
What have I told you?

686
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,145
Don't interfere. Right?

687
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,693
Let her husband have
as many affairs as he wants.

688
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,270
What do you care?

689
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:15,353
Urvil..
- No, I am serious.

690
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:16,603
It's okay.

691
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:19,686
How many times do I have
to explain you such a simple thing.

692
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,311
I am sorry, Urvil.
- Sorry.

693
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,436
I am sorry.

694
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,361
You know what, Simran.

695
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,728
When you don't mean it,
don't say sorry.

696
00:40:27,202 --> 00:40:28,686
Urvil, relax. We're just..
- Diya!

697
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,978
Sorry.

698
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,243
What do you want to prove?

699
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:37,936
Whenever we've an argument..

700
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:39,061
"Urvil, I am sorry."

701
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,186
Without thinking, "I am sorry".

702
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,353
Without thinking, "I am sorry".

703
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:44,231
You make me look like the
villain in front of my friends.

704
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,061
That's what you want!

705
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:46,565
Urvil..there are people around.

706
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,936
I don't care if there are people.

707
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,520
Enough if you don't, don't speak
to her like that. - Are you happy?

708
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:52,895
Happy?

709
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:54,145
You've proven it.

710
00:40:54,603 --> 00:40:56,478
In everyone's view,
Simran the great..

711
00:40:56,558 --> 00:40:57,270
..and Urvil the ass****.

712
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,686
What?
- What the heck.

713
00:41:00,436 --> 00:41:01,770
What do you want?

714
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:03,478
What should I do?

715
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:04,811
Don't do anything.

716
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,595
Just keep me trapped in that guilt.

717
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:09,243
Keep you trapped?

718
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:11,436
Where is this coming from?

719
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:12,853
Yeah, I wonder where
it's coming from.

720
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:17,815
I am sorry, guys.
I have to leave.

721
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:18,853
Yeah, please go.

722
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,270
Simran.. - Simran.

723
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,311
Listen to me.

724
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:25,011
What's this?
What are you doing?

725
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:28,353
What's your problem?
- Seriously.

726
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:32,513
Why are you still here?
You go. - Fine.

727
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,686
Sit here alone.

728
00:41:42,006 --> 00:41:42,686
Hi, Urvil.

729
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,603
Celina.

730
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:00,395
Hello.

731
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:02,853
Hello, yeah hi. Is this Pullman's Resort.
- Yes sir.

732
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:04,877
Yeah..I am calling on
behalf of Event Craft Media.

733
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:05,978
Oh, from the show.

734
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:08,626
Right, that was us last week.
- How may I help you, sir?

735
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:11,603
I need the contact information
of one of your guest..

736
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,603
..who had attended the fashion show.

737
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:14,638
May I have the name?

738
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:17,038
Yeah..her name is Celina.

739
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,811
Okay. And the last name.

740
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:22,145
That's all I have.
I don't have a last name.

741
00:42:22,422 --> 00:42:24,228
No Celina on the list, sir.

742
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:25,565
No one by that name.

743
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:26,770
No, sir.

744
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:29,145
Okay.
- Is there anything else?

745
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:30,076
Thank you so much.

746
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,478
Welcome.

747
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,728
Urvil.

748
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,478
Actually, I wanted to thank you.
- For?

749
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:42,603
You spoke to the HR..

750
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:46,077
..and they approved my raise.
- Oh, yeah.

751
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:48,186
It's more than I expected, Urvil.

752
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,061
So thank you.

753
00:42:50,423 --> 00:42:51,311
You deserve it.

754
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:55,404
The team's waiting for you,
so come soon.

755
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,603
Yeah, I'll be there.

756
00:42:56,728 --> 00:42:57,895
Two minutes. - Sure.

757
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,565
Did you do the 12 foot diameter
platform? - Yes, done that.

758
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:03,186
We need 24 screens for video
display. - I'll get that done.

759
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,395
Well stocked bar.

760
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,565
And the final projections,
just go through it.

761
00:43:06,645 --> 00:43:08,353
And we'll do a dry run.
- Okay.

762
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:10,270
No last minute surprises.

763
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:11,478
Rahul, come in.
- Yes, Sid.

764
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:13,148
Yes, the F&B manager..

765
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:14,895
..needs confirmation
for tomorrow's menu.

766
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:18,478
Okay..just run the figures by David.

767
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:20,103
No, it's already done.
It's approved.

768
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:21,061
Well done. - Yeah.

769
00:43:21,228 --> 00:43:22,353
Keep up the good work.
- Thanks.

770
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:23,686
Azad.

771
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,603
Azad. - Yeah.

772
00:43:26,528 --> 00:43:28,145
Have the press-kits arrived?
- Yes.

773
00:43:28,978 --> 00:43:30,436
These are few options
for press-kits. - Fine.

774
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,645
We'll use the red ones.

775
00:43:31,811 --> 00:43:33,603
And put up a Rules
Diamonds Logo as well.

776
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,270
Okay.

777
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:36,228
On your way.

778
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:36,728
Anil..

779
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:37,603
Urvil.

780
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:41,770
Not now, I'm busy.
We'll meet later.

781
00:43:42,311 --> 00:43:43,228
That can wait.

782
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,270
Please!

783
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,395
I'll be up.

784
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:51,520
Look, Urvil.

785
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,228
I am really proud of you that
you're so efficient..

786
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:56,412
You called me here to say this?
Seriously?

787
00:43:58,477 --> 00:44:00,270
Can I talk?
- Speak.

788
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:04,061
Everything that's been happening
in your and Simran's life..

789
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,175
..does it have anything
to do with your recent trip?

790
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:16,936
You know,
David..it's just the usual.

791
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,674
No, it's not the usual.
It's something different.

792
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:20,811
Okay.

793
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:25,686
She's from Pune.
- Okay.

794
00:44:25,891 --> 00:44:28,186
And she saw me yesterday,
at the mall with Simran.

795
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:33,357
You should've seen that
look on the face of hers.

796
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:35,386
So?
- So?

797
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,478
You don't understand.

798
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:40,874
I didn't tell Celina
that I am married.

799
00:44:40,954 --> 00:44:42,270
Look, what's done is done.

800
00:44:43,061 --> 00:44:43,728
All I want to say is..

801
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:47,231
..it's wrong that you misbehave
with Simran because of her.

802
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,395
Yeah, I know.

803
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:49,520
I know that.

804
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:51,811
You know..

805
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:54,978
I think I should
tell Celina everything.

806
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:58,020
Tell her everything,
get that load off my chest.

807
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,811
Load off my chest?

808
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:04,395
According to me, Urvil..you're
unnecessarily complicating your life.

809
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:08,867
Give as much attention
as it deserves.

810
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:12,609
Your wife, your career..yeah.
- Yeah?

811
00:45:12,817 --> 00:45:14,692
If you concentrate on these things..

812
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:17,734
..then your sudden
guilt will disappear.

813
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:19,734
That's all I wanted to say.

814
00:45:20,442 --> 00:45:21,317
Oh yes..

815
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:23,942
Happy Anniversary, Urvil.

816
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:38,877
"How do I say.."

817
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:41,336
"How do I say.."

818
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:46,419
"I want to dwell in you till dawn."

819
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:48,947
"It's the season to.."

820
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:56,711
"..drink that sultry
smile from your lips."

821
00:45:59,419 --> 00:46:04,461
"Can I say something.."

822
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:09,502
"..I am addicted to your love."

823
00:46:09,586 --> 00:46:14,544
"Can I say something.."

824
00:46:14,627 --> 00:46:27,086
"..I am addicted to your love."

825
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:38,919
"..I am addicted to your love."

826
00:47:02,627 --> 00:47:12,419
"Our feelings are uniting like one."

827
00:47:12,544 --> 00:47:17,711
"I am craving for you.."

828
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:22,627
"..and its making
me lose my senses."

829
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:34,184
"It feels like heaven in your arms."

830
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:42,877
"Can I say something.."

831
00:47:43,044 --> 00:47:52,184
"..I am addicted to your love."

832
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:57,291
"..I am addicted to your love."

833
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:01,990
Okay announce a queue in the AV.

834
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,244

the brand, Mr. Adhiraj Kapoor.

840

David, you carry on.
I'll join you. - Come soon.

00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,298
Mr. Kapoor.

855
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:01,590
Mr. Urvil.
- Urvil Raisingh, Mr. Kapoor.

856
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:04,298
Mr. Raisingh,
it was a wonderful show.

857
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:04,840
Pleasure, sir.

858
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:07,067
And such a great show
in such a small time.

859
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,256
I am impressed.

860
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,131
We try our best, sir.

861
00:49:09,548 --> 00:49:10,881
You should meet my wife.

00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:12,131
Ambar.

863
00:49:12,548 --> 00:49:13,337
Mr. Raisingh.

864
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,016
Waiter, one more.

865
00:50:35,724 --> 00:50:36,724
Hello, ma'am.

866
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:44,266
Urvil..hey..

867
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:48,932
Hey.
- Hey.

868
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:54,891
Celina.
- What are you doing here?

869
00:50:55,016 --> 00:50:55,932
What are you doing with him?

870
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:56,766
What's all this?

871
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:58,724
You're married.
- You're in the Ladies room.

872
00:50:58,891 --> 00:50:59,724
I don't give a s***

873
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,644
Why did you lie to me?
- Someone might drop in.

874
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:03,849
I didn't lie to you?
- But you didn't tell me the truth either.

875
00:51:03,932 --> 00:51:05,182
What did you say your name was?
Celina?

876
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:06,724
Celina? Really?

877
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:08,516
Just leave me.
- No!

878
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:11,432
I won't let you out of here..

879
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:12,599
..until you don't
answer my questions.

880
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:13,599
Answer my damn questions.

881
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:15,516
Listen, you're drunk.
- I am not drunk.

882
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,349
Relax.

883
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:19,099
Don't create a scene.

884
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:21,224
I am creating a scene!

885
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:22,807
Here!
- What is this?

886
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,182
Number.

887
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,391
Wait. Wait.

888
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:28,932
I said wait.

889
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:31,724
Wait. I don't trust you.

890
00:51:31,974 --> 00:51:33,307
It might be a fake number.

891
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:35,266
Leave me.

892
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:36,391
Yeah, go back to him.

893
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:47,182
Damnit!

894
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:53,641
It was beautiful, right.
- Yeah, it was..

895
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:56,141
Who is he?
- I don't know.

896
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:00,432
All yours, ladies.

897
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,099
Forget it.

898
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:05,432
Do you get it?
- This is not my fault.

899
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:07,141
I've to also talk to my superiors.

900
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,016
It's not in my control.

901
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,681
If there's a last minute expense..
- Urvil.

902
00:52:10,932 --> 00:52:11,599
Will you ask?

903
00:52:11,724 --> 00:52:13,391
Show me the bill..
- Look at this.

904
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:14,557
I don't know what
to make of it.

905
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:15,599
Ask..

906
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:16,974
Are you drunk?

907
00:52:18,432 --> 00:52:21,053
Urvil. Wasn't that her?
The girl we bet on.

908
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:22,599
Tell me..

909
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:25,724
Mrs. Adhiraj Kapoor!
Impossible.

910
00:52:26,057 --> 00:52:28,932
Impossible?
It's the 21st Century.

911
00:52:29,016 --> 00:52:29,686
Exactly.

912
00:52:29,766 --> 00:52:32,182
What are you guys talking about?
- Urvil will tell you.

913
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,641
Since he's seen her so closely.

914
00:52:34,724 --> 00:52:35,182
Right, Urvil.

915
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:36,849
Don't you feel ashamed
talking like this?

916
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:40,599
And don't you guys
have work to do.

917
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:42,099
Get back to work.

918
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:44,232
Wants to make it big like me.

919
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:45,804
Take care of them.

920
00:52:47,994 --> 00:52:49,597
He didn't feel ashamed doing it..

921
00:52:49,908 --> 00:52:51,221
..and I should feel
ashamed saying it.

922
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:17,432
Hello. - Hello.

923
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:22,932
Celina..sorry I overreacted.

924
00:53:23,516 --> 00:53:24,432
Celina!

925
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:27,504
Who was that?

926
00:53:28,425 --> 00:53:29,301
Wrong number.

927
00:53:36,724 --> 00:53:38,849
Shyam, is Jahan asleep.
- Jahan is long asleep.

928
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:39,599
Good.

929
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:44,519
You two are back?
- Yes, father, we're bit late.

930
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,474
How was the event?

931
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:50,724
Father, you're still awake.

932
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:53,656
Did you eat?
- I ate..but only a little.

933
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:55,849
Because my medicines
fill up half my appetite.

934
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:58,139
So tell me how was the event?

935
00:53:58,516 --> 00:53:59,724
It was really great, father.

936
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:02,057
And the event managers
did a wonderful job.

937
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,599
I am so happy.

938
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:07,432
Did Jahan trouble you much?
- Not at all.

939
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:09,566
He heard few stories
and fell asleep.

940
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:11,391
Mom.

941
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:12,849
Unbelievable.

942
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:16,218
He was pretending
like he's fast asleep.

943
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:17,807
He's such an artist.

944
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:19,724
Make him an actor.

945
00:54:20,085 --> 00:54:21,766
He must have heard
our car coming.

946
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:23,226
I'll tuck him in.

947
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:25,807
I'll be right back.
- Sure.

948
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:26,849
Goodnight, dear.

949
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:29,307
Why didn't you sleep
like a good boy?

950
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,432
Mom, if I sleep..I'll
get nightmares.

951
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:37,391
Jahan, what did mom
say about nightmares?

952
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,974
That they are not true.

953
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:40,141
If they were true..

954
00:54:40,224 --> 00:54:43,599
..then someone would've
taken me away from you.

955
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:47,016
No one can take
me away from my Jahan.

956
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,974
Do you know why?

957
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:52,766
Because I am my
superhero's super-mom.

958
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:54,307
Pinky-promise.

959
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:55,599
Pinky promise.

960
00:54:55,789 --> 00:54:56,807
Come on, now sleep.

961
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,266
What happened?

962
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:02,974
I want to sleep with mom.
- I see..

963
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:06,182
Even mom wants to
hug Jahan and sleep.

964
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:07,391
Come on.

965
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,224
Third time this week..

966
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,308
He can't sleep without you.

967
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:32,040
I don't blame him.

968
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:35,099
I forgot to tell you.

969
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:38,391
Father's appointment
with doctor..

970
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:39,999
..has been confirmed
for day after tomorrow.

971
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:42,182
Oh, Good. We'll go together.

972
00:55:42,347 --> 00:55:44,724
Ambar, you just
recently joined work.

973
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:47,557
And..if you keep
cancelling meetings..

974
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:49,788
..they'll think you're
not serious about your work.

975
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:54,807
My family is my priority, Adi.

976
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:58,057
They should know that now.

977
00:55:58,578 --> 00:56:01,516
Everything else..comes later.

978
00:56:19,226 --> 00:56:20,935
"Life's sometimes up.."

979
00:56:21,018 --> 00:56:22,726
"..sometimes it down,
down, down."

980
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,310
"Sometimes it's smooth.."

981
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:26,685
"..Sometimes like an
abuse..round and round."

982
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:28,560
"Don't stress out."

983
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:30,101
"Forget your depression."

984
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:33,351
"Squeeze a lemon in your
drink..and forget it all."

985
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:34,893
"Take a peg.."

986
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:36,855
"Take a peg..and forget it."

987
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,393
"Take a peg..and forget it."

988
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:44,101
"Take a peg..and forget it."

989
00:56:44,181 --> 00:56:47,646
"Take a peg..and forget it."

990
00:56:47,726 --> 00:56:51,438
"Take a peg..and forget it."

991
00:56:51,518 --> 00:56:54,518
"Take a peg.."

992
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:58,358
"..let the booze wash down."

993
00:56:58,601 --> 00:56:59,855
"Take a peg.."

994
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:02,018
"..let the booze wash down."

995
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:03,435
"Take a peg.."

996
00:57:03,518 --> 00:57:05,946
"..let the booze wash down."

997
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:27,226
"Stop listening to
sad songs on the radio."

998
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,518
"Tune your life to the happy mode."

999
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:34,018
"Happy..happy..
happy mode.."

1000
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:37,935
"Stop listening to
sad songs on the radio."

1001
00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:41,143
"Tune your life to
the happy mode."

1002
00:57:41,518 --> 00:57:43,146
"It's the season
to get drunk."

1003
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,726
"A reason to live."

1004
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:48,226
"Stop being
stubborn..and forget it."

1005
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,143
"Take a peg.."

1006
00:57:50,226 --> 00:57:51,476
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1007
00:57:51,643 --> 00:57:55,101
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1008
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:58,810
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1009
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:02,185
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1010
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:05,560
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1011
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,855
"Just chill and
forget your worries."

1012
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:09,143
"Forget it.."

1013
00:58:09,226 --> 00:58:13,268
"Booze rules the world."

1014
00:58:13,351 --> 00:58:20,143
"Chill out..chill out.."

1015
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:24,060
"When the love's
bio-data corrupt."

1016
00:58:24,143 --> 00:58:27,656
"You lost big in
the business of love."

1017
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:34,393
"When the love's
bio-data corrupt."

1018
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:38,060
"You lost big in
the business of love."

1019
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,101
"Don't lose your temper."

1020
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:41,685
"Use an ice-cube."

1021
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,351
"Don't leave any bottle empty,"

1022
00:58:43,435 --> 00:58:45,435
"Just forget everything."

1023
00:58:45,518 --> 00:58:46,935
"Take a peg.."

1024
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:48,480
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1025
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,060
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1026
00:58:52,143 --> 00:58:55,643
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1027
00:58:55,726 --> 00:58:59,143
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1028
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:02,435
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1029
00:59:02,518 --> 00:59:04,726
"Just chill and
forget your worries."

1030
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,101
"Forget it.."

1031
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:09,685
"Booze rules the world."

1032
00:59:09,768 --> 00:59:11,855
"Just chill and
forget your worries."

1033
00:59:11,935 --> 00:59:13,143
"Forget it.."

1034
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:17,146
"Booze rules the world."

1035
00:59:17,226 --> 00:59:21,533
"Chill out.."

1036
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:24,268
"Take a peg..and forget it."

1037
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:42,268
Come, Jahan. Let's go.

1038
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:57,614
Thank you.

1039
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:04,375
Mom, will you pick me
up after school? - Of course.

1040
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:05,996
Remember, pinky-promise.

1041
01:00:06,076 --> 01:00:07,352
Jahan, let's go in the classroom.

1042
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:10,174
I love you.
- Bye, I love you.

1043
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,310
Is it a big order?

1044
01:00:19,925 --> 01:00:20,935
Then?

1045
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:23,768
Planning to end the
famine in the world?

1046
01:00:29,513 --> 01:00:30,707
Depressed?

1047
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:40,060
Simran? What happened?

1048
01:00:43,795 --> 01:00:44,893
What happened?

1049
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:54,268
Ambar.

1050
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:10,412
I'll see you soon, bye.
- Bye.

1051
01:01:10,688 --> 01:01:12,739
Looking at our
company's last quarter..

1052
01:01:13,591 --> 01:01:15,518
..I think we'll have to better that.

1053
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,893
For which the goals have
to be revised. - Yes, sir.

1054
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:20,394
Everyone will have
to take extra efforts.

1055
01:01:20,702 --> 01:01:21,893
We're..

1056
01:01:24,878 --> 01:01:29,480
We're..wanting to expand
our business space..overseas.

1057
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,370
And for that performance..

1058
01:01:35,165 --> 01:01:37,118
..is important..and necessary.

1059
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,935
As you all know we're coming
up with a fund-raiser event.

1060
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:45,018
The details of which will be discussed
tomorrow, when we meet.

1061
01:01:45,393 --> 01:01:46,474
Okay, sir.
- Sure.

1062
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,569
Thank you, sir.

1063
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,620
Thank you, sir.

1064
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,646
When Urvil and I
used to work together..

1065
01:01:59,046 --> 01:02:00,608
..he would often leave early.

1066
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,592
And I would work late nights.

1067
01:02:06,353 --> 01:02:07,884
But whenever I would step out..

1068
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,560
..he would be standing there.

1069
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:17,644
Then we would have
dinner together..

1070
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:19,958
..and spend lots of
time together.

1071
01:02:22,457 --> 01:02:23,582
But you know..

1072
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,082
..what was the most
special of it all.

1073
01:02:27,332 --> 01:02:28,219
What?

1074
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,416
Every time he looked at me..

1075
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,082
..felt like some kid's
watching magic.

1076
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,041
Everything's still the same.

1077
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:43,624
Then what's the problem.

1078
01:02:43,832 --> 01:02:44,749
I don't know.

1079
01:02:48,582 --> 01:02:49,957
I can't see it anymore..

1080
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:52,832
That thing in his eyes.

1081
01:02:56,249 --> 01:02:57,332
I can't understand..

1082
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:00,832
Have I changed..

1083
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:04,457
..or has he?

1084
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:10,443
Simran..it must be
stress at the office..

1085
01:03:10,523 --> 01:03:12,499
..maybe that's why he's
a bit tensed. That's it.

1086
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:14,332
Don't think too hard.

1087
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:34,999
Father, food's ready.

1088
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:35,749
Come.

1089
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:37,541
Coming, dear.

1090
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:50,332
These telemarketers.

1091
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:53,124
I wonder where do
they get my number from.

1092
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,457
I spoke with them
politely once.

1093
01:03:56,426 --> 01:03:57,582
And now they've
been harassing me.

1094
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,041
They are asking me to invest.

1095
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:03,041
I don't want to invest!

1096
01:04:05,123 --> 01:04:05,916
Cool down.

1097
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:09,499
That's it. Thank you.
Thank you.

1098
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,166
'Don't you think we
were destined to meet..'

1099
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,874
'Like some special connection.'

1100
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:47,583
'And how many girls have
you said this to before?'

1101
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,532
'Well..'
'You're no. 121.'

1102
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:54,335
'Really?'

1103
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,967
'Is this how you
look at every girl?'

1104
01:05:09,402 --> 01:05:09,958
'How?'

1105
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:12,874
'Like you don't believe
your eyes.'

1106
01:05:14,317 --> 01:05:16,249
'Like you're watching
some magic.'

1107
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:18,243
'You are kind of magic,
Celina.'

1108
01:05:19,731 --> 01:05:20,881
'You're magic.'

1109
01:05:22,378 --> 01:05:24,608
'You can drive anyone crazy.'

1110
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:31,174
Hi, who am I speaking with?
- Meghna.

1111
01:05:31,254 --> 01:05:33,682
Meghna! Hi,
this is Urvil Raisingh speaking.

1112
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:35,458
From Event Craft Media.
- Yes, Mr. Raisingh.

1113
01:05:35,756 --> 01:05:37,131
Meghna, I need your help.

1114
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:37,839
Tell me.

1115
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:41,075
Can you give me Mr. Kapoor's
residence number and address?

1116
01:05:41,155 --> 01:05:42,006
Residence?

1117
01:05:42,173 --> 01:05:43,256
We need to send over some gifts.

1118
01:05:43,336 --> 01:05:44,381
Oh, okay.

1119
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:45,923
Just a second. - Sure.

1120
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:48,381
Yes, Meghna, Shoot.

1121
01:05:48,674 --> 01:05:52,091
9 Willows Garden,
Koregoan Park,..

1122
01:05:53,131 --> 01:05:54,173
Koregoan Park.

1123
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:55,803
And number.

1124
01:05:55,883 --> 01:05:58,756
25637621.
- 621..

1125
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:02,839
Thank you, Meghna.
- You're welcome.

1126
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:05,048
You've no idea how much
help you've been to me.

1127
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:06,423
Bye. - Bye.

1128
01:06:15,923 --> 01:06:18,964
Jahan..come on,
open your mouth, baby.

1129
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,006
Hello.

1130
01:06:22,117 --> 01:06:23,166
No, Adi isn't at home.

1131
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:24,589
This is his dad.

1132
01:06:24,669 --> 01:06:25,673
Any message? - Yes.

1133
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:28,964
Ambar.
Wait a minute.

1134
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:30,696
Jahan.
- Yes.

1135
01:06:30,776 --> 01:06:31,881
Take the phone.

1136
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:33,548
Ambar, call for you.

1137
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:37,173
Come on.

1138
01:06:38,423 --> 01:06:39,120
Great.

1139
01:06:39,276 --> 01:06:40,464
Thank you.

1140
01:06:42,554 --> 01:06:43,842
Thank you.

1141
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,214
Hello.

1142
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:46,881
Celina I need to meet you.

1143
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,381
What do you call him?

1144
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:53,381
How dare you call
at my residence?

1145
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,089
You forced me to.

1146
01:06:55,756 --> 01:06:57,464
First you give me your number
and you don't answer my calls.

1147
01:06:57,773 --> 01:06:59,548
I am married, Urvil.

1148
01:06:59,631 --> 01:07:02,964
I can't talk to
you whenever you want.

1149
01:07:03,044 --> 01:07:05,173
You should know that.

1150
01:07:05,253 --> 01:07:07,298
Then return my calls.

1151
01:07:07,746 --> 01:07:09,798
And don't even think
about disconnecting.

1152
01:07:11,024 --> 01:07:12,355
I'll keep calling you.

1153
01:07:12,588 --> 01:07:15,298
Just stop it, Urvil.
- Then meet me, Celina.

1154
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,381
My name isn't Celina.

1155
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:19,756
Just forget what happened.

1156
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:23,381
And please..let me forget too.
- No!

1157
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:24,384
What?

1158
01:07:24,464 --> 01:07:27,381
I'll keep calling you
until you don't meet me.

1159
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,173
Are you blackmailing me?

1160
01:07:30,057 --> 01:07:31,006
Maybe.

1161
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:32,589
What will you do?

1162
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:34,464
Tell Adiraj.

1163
01:07:34,737 --> 01:07:37,006
Okay. Be my guest.

1164
01:07:38,256 --> 01:07:39,714
What do you want from me?

1165
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:42,381
You know what I want.

1166
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,089
Facing East, Camp.

1167
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:46,589
9am.

1168
01:07:48,381 --> 01:07:49,381
Be there, Celina.

1169
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:09,896
Urvil.
- Celina.

1170
01:08:11,979 --> 01:08:15,104
God, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

1171
01:08:15,896 --> 01:08:16,937
But I can't..

1172
01:08:18,168 --> 01:08:19,646
Isn't this what you desire?

1173
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:23,229
Desires are one thing..

1174
01:08:25,513 --> 01:08:26,979
..but I can't do this.
- Celina.

1175
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:29,937
I am here.

1176
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:33,187
Speak up, I don't have much time.

1177
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:36,271
Celina..how are you?

1178
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,187
What?
- What are you doing?

1179
01:08:40,604 --> 01:08:42,687
Sorry, couldn't control myself.

1180
01:08:43,396 --> 01:08:44,146
Please sit.

1181
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,521
Then learn to control yourself.

1182
01:08:46,884 --> 01:08:48,896
It's over, don't you get it?

1183
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:56,146
No, Celina. I thought the same.

1184
01:08:57,858 --> 01:08:59,242
But it's not true.

1185
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,199
What? What's not true, Urvil?

1186
01:09:03,151 --> 01:09:05,354
It was just a one night stand, Urvil.

1187
01:09:05,866 --> 01:09:07,484
Nothing more, nothing less.

1188
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:09,559
There was something
special between us.

1189
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,781
It was just a physical attraction.

1190
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:12,937
That's it.

1191
01:09:13,986 --> 01:09:17,822
You're looking for answers..to
illogical questions.

1192
01:09:23,152 --> 01:09:24,233
We met again..

1193
01:09:26,006 --> 01:09:28,187
There must be a reason behind it,
Celina. Come on.

1194
01:09:28,482 --> 01:09:29,771
For heck sake.

1195
01:09:30,363 --> 01:09:31,937
My name is Ambar.

1196
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:36,522
Celina doesn't exist.
You got that?

1197
01:09:37,482 --> 01:09:39,646
Better get that straight.

1198
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:43,646
And stop stalking me.

1199
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:46,996
What did you say?
- You heard me, Urvil.

1200
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:49,980
Stop stalking you?
- Yes!

1201
01:09:51,513 --> 01:09:55,682
You're calling me a bloody stalker?
- What else will you call this?

1202
01:09:57,854 --> 01:10:00,214
Do you know what
a stalker means?

1203
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:01,917
What is it?

1204
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:02,937
Stalker!

1205
01:10:03,915 --> 01:10:04,685
What?

1206
01:10:05,446 --> 01:10:06,700
Is Jahan okay?

1207
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:11,104
No, no..I'll be right there.

1208
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,562
I need to go.
- I am not finished yet.

1209
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:16,516
Sit down.

1210
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:19,403
Urvil, my son is hurt.

1211
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:20,729
I need to go.

1212
01:10:21,707 --> 01:10:22,479
Sit!

1213
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,271
Son! You've a son!

1214
01:10:26,164 --> 01:10:26,873
Wow!

1215
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:29,831
You know, this just keeps
getting better and better.

1216
01:10:31,914 --> 01:10:33,206
What other skeletons
do you have in your closet?

1217
01:10:33,286 --> 01:10:34,748
A husband..son..

1218
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:36,623
Do you have a few more like me?
- How dare..

1219
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:52,414
Mama..I am fine,
but there was blood.

1220
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:54,164
But I didn't cry.

1221
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:55,623
I am batman.

1222
01:10:57,206 --> 01:10:58,498
My superhero.

1223
01:10:58,998 --> 01:11:00,164
Are you sure you want
to go back to class?

1224
01:11:00,248 --> 01:11:02,081
Let's go home.
- No, class.

1225
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:03,873
Nothing to worry about.

1226
01:11:03,956 --> 01:11:06,706
But those are the rules,
so we called.

1227
01:11:06,831 --> 01:11:08,414
Sorry.
- No problem,.

1228
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:10,998
No, no, Ms.
Pai. Thank you for calling me.

1229
01:11:14,998 --> 01:11:15,748
Stalker!

1230
01:11:18,456 --> 01:11:19,998
She called me a stalker.
- Who?

1231
01:11:20,331 --> 01:11:22,039
Do I look like a
bloody stalker to you?

1232
01:11:24,706 --> 01:11:26,831
Ohh.. Mrs. Kapoor.

1233
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:28,039
Celina!

1234
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:31,331
You know she even has a kid.

1235
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:33,248
She has a bloody child.

1236
01:11:34,664 --> 01:11:35,748
Playing tease.

1237
01:11:35,998 --> 01:11:37,373
Stop abusing her.

1238
01:11:38,414 --> 01:11:40,081
You're behaving like a child.
- I am behaving like a child?

1239
01:11:40,164 --> 01:11:40,581
Yes. - Me?

1240
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:42,331
Yes, you are behaving like a child.

1241
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:45,248
You two didn't tell
anything about each other.

1242
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,081
This should've ended right there.

1243
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:51,331
I mean, dude, this is some serious
sh** you're getting yourself into.

1244
01:11:53,081 --> 01:11:54,873
Please stop before it's too late.

1245
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:56,623
David.

1246
01:11:58,039 --> 01:11:58,706
What?

1247
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:05,331
I can't get her out of my head.

1248
01:12:05,831 --> 01:12:06,914
I tried really hard.

1249
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:13,123
David, I can't get
Celina out of my head.

1250
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:15,873
What do I do?

1251
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,123
She isn't Celina.

1252
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,956
She's Mrs. Ambar Adiraj Kapoor.

1253
01:12:21,956 --> 01:12:25,164
And the sooner you understand,
the better..

1254
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:27,331
For you..and everyone else.

1255
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:30,539
Please get a hold
on yourself, Urvil.

1256
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:43,956
It was a small scratch.

1257
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:46,831
He's okay, nothing
to worry about.

1258
01:12:46,956 --> 01:12:48,326
Great. - Thank God.

1259
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:54,248
Ambar, I read your travel
blog's latest update. - Yes.

1260
01:12:54,498 --> 01:12:56,123
But the last segment's missing.

1261
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,664
Your special experience
about every trip.

1262
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:01,331
That was missing this time.
Why?

1263
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:05,248
I don't know..but,
don't you have an appointment?

1264
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:09,081
Oh my..I thought she forgot.

1265
01:13:09,373 --> 01:13:13,414
Father..you really think
Ambar can forget? - No.

1266
01:13:13,873 --> 01:13:15,914
She never forgets anything.

1267
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:21,248
What's wrong, Ambar?

1268
01:13:21,873 --> 01:13:23,331
What?
- Everything okay?

1269
01:13:24,748 --> 01:13:27,373
Yes..when Jahan gets hurt..

1270
01:13:27,914 --> 01:13:29,914
..it makes me a little restless.

1271
01:13:31,623 --> 01:13:33,873
It's part of growing up, Ambar.
Get used to it.

1272
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:35,706
Yeah, that's right.

1273
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,831
Father, we're getting late.

1274
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:43,293
Do we have to?
- Of course we do.

1275
01:13:43,373 --> 01:13:45,206
Okay, let's go.

1276
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,331
As we were discussing yesterday..

1277
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:51,164
..the fund-raiser
event is coming up.

1278
01:13:51,623 --> 01:13:52,831
The invites have come in.

1279
01:13:52,914 --> 01:13:55,873
I want this year's turn-over a lot-lot
more than last year. - Yes, sir.

1280
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,539
Everyone knows the plan of action.

1281
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:00,373
You have any suggestions, Urvil.

1282
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:07,206
Urvil, I asked you a question.

1283
01:14:07,331 --> 01:14:08,604
Urvil?
- Do you have any suggestion?

1284
01:14:10,581 --> 01:14:13,164
I am sorry, sir.
You were saying something?

1285
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:17,831
Where's your attention?

1286
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,789
Stay back after the meeting,
I want to see you.

1287
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:23,331
Yes sir.
- That's it

1288
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:32,956
Please consider this
as your last warning.

1289
01:14:33,956 --> 01:14:34,706
Yes, sir.

1290
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:36,581
You're the blue-eyed
boy of this company.

1291
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,331
The reason why you made it this far.

1292
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:42,664
Don't make me regret that decision.

1293
01:14:43,664 --> 01:14:45,850
Pull up your socks,
and sort out your life.

1294
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:54,331
Sir, I would like to
invite Adiraj and all of you..

1295
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:55,781
For our event.

1296
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,251
Yes, of course. - Yes.

1297
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,039
Where is it?
- Pune, Camp area.

1298
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,664
It's day after tomorrow.
And you all have to come.

1299
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,331
Yes. We'll definitely come.

1300
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,791
Thank you, sir.
- Come, dear.

1301
01:15:04,547 --> 01:15:05,293
Father, time for your medicines.

1302
01:15:05,373 --> 01:15:06,331
Let me introduce you.

1303
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,293
He's here to invite us
to his company's fund-raiser.

1304
01:15:09,373 --> 01:15:10,185
Urvil.

1305
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:13,164
We've met before, Mr.
Kapoor. - Call me Raghav.

1306
01:15:13,394 --> 01:15:14,164
Okay.

1307
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,031
Mrs. Kapoor.

1308
01:15:17,882 --> 01:15:19,706
Oh..I finally get to meet you,
young man.

1309
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:21,498
Introduce yourself, young man.

1310
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:22,706
Wait, wait, let me guess.

1311
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,206
Ranbir Kapoor.

1312
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:25,479
No?

1313
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:26,831
Arjun Kapoor?

1314
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:29,873
No, silly.
I am Jahan Adiraj Kapoor.

1315
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:32,998
Nice to meet you
Jahan Adiraj Kapoor.

1316
01:15:33,331 --> 01:15:34,706
I am Urvil Shekhar Raisingh.

1317
01:15:34,789 --> 01:15:35,491
Hi. - Hi.

1318
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,998
Jahan, let's go inside.

1319
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:39,581
It's quite sunny outside.

1320
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:42,998
Will you play cricket with me?
- Of course.

1321
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,664
But I am busy today.

1322
01:15:45,414 --> 01:15:46,690
I'll come back some other day.

1323
01:15:49,498 --> 01:15:50,373
I promise.

1324
01:15:50,456 --> 01:15:53,081
Okay, busy man. See you soon.
- Sir, I'll take your leave.

1325
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:55,331
And I hope to see you at the event.
- Absolutely.

1326
01:15:55,539 --> 01:15:56,331
Mrs. Kapoor.

1327
01:15:57,998 --> 01:15:59,333
Bye, Jahan.
- Bye.

1328
01:16:15,373 --> 01:16:17,873
Thank God father's
reports are normal.

1329
01:16:18,706 --> 01:16:20,831
I'll have to be more
careful about his diet.

1330
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:21,956
But I'll do it.

1331
01:16:22,831 --> 01:16:25,206
I'll put Jahan on duty.

1332
01:16:28,228 --> 01:16:29,831
It's not fair.
- Huh!

1333
01:16:30,123 --> 01:16:31,206
This isn't right.

1334
01:16:31,456 --> 01:16:32,164
What?

1335
01:16:32,244 --> 01:16:34,248
You never give a
reason to complain.

1336
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:38,954
You're so perfect.

1337
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:46,331
I am not even close
to perfection, Adi.

1338
01:16:47,827 --> 01:16:50,956
Hey..mind your language.

1339
01:16:51,261 --> 01:16:53,206
You're talking about my wife.

1340
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,067
What's the matter, Urvil?

1341
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,195
Nothing.

1342
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,373
Just a little stress at the office.

1343
01:17:41,853 --> 01:17:44,831
Urvil, after all these years I know..

1344
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:47,748
..whenever you're stressed at work,
you talk more.

1345
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:50,248
Instead of keeping quiet.

1346
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:55,164
We used to share everything, Urvil.

1347
01:17:56,632 --> 01:18:00,914
But now I feel..you're divided.

1348
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:05,081
What do you mean to say?

1349
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:10,206
Why do I feel..

1350
01:18:11,456 --> 01:18:12,998
..that something's come between us?

1351
01:18:16,686 --> 01:18:19,789
Look, it's not what you think.

1352
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:21,831
Trust me.

1353
01:18:31,215 --> 01:18:32,956
I am trying to do that.

1354
01:18:47,664 --> 01:18:49,039
Hello. Here you go.

1355
01:18:49,123 --> 01:18:50,039
Take the keys too.

1356
01:18:50,248 --> 01:18:50,873
Come on, son.

1357
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:51,707
I'll dry you.

1358
01:18:51,787 --> 01:18:52,818
Okay, grandpa.
- Jahan.

1359
01:18:53,232 --> 01:18:54,498
My child.

1360
01:18:54,578 --> 01:18:56,293
He's completely drenched.
-Are you okay?

1361
01:18:56,373 --> 01:18:57,293
What happened?
- Look, mom's here.

1362
01:18:57,373 --> 01:19:00,956
Jahan fell in the water,
and Urvil jumped after him.

1363
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,448
Urvil didn't know
that Jahan can swim.

1364
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,859
Are you okay.
- He got drenched for no reason.

1365
01:19:07,939 --> 01:19:08,789
It's okay.

1366
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:10,414
How can he just fall in the water?

1367
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:12,831
If you're playing with the kid..

1368
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,581
..then you must be responsible.

1369
01:19:15,414 --> 01:19:17,914
Did you have to play here?

1370
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:20,888
The tiles were wet and he slipped.

1371
01:19:20,968 --> 01:19:21,707
Yes, mom.

1372
01:19:21,787 --> 01:19:24,706
I'm sorry, I was standing
there..so you know, I jumped in.

1373
01:19:25,947 --> 01:19:28,664
Maybe he wouldn't have
slipped if you weren't here.

1374
01:19:30,004 --> 01:19:31,331
Forget it, dear.

1375
01:19:31,998 --> 01:19:33,998
Come, I'll take care of him.

1376
01:19:34,346 --> 01:19:35,539
Urvil's completely drenched..

1377
01:19:35,623 --> 01:19:37,373
..give him Adi's clothes.
- Yes.

1378
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,811
Come, son. Let's go.
- Yes, grandpa.

1379
01:19:39,993 --> 01:19:40,914
Alright.

1380
01:20:00,312 --> 01:20:01,520
Don't you dare?

1381
01:20:01,728 --> 01:20:03,062
Aren't you ashamed?

1382
01:20:03,187 --> 01:20:05,895
In my room, my bedroom.

1383
01:20:06,978 --> 01:20:07,770
Exactly.

1384
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:09,728
Don't you see the beauty of it?

1385
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:11,853
What did you say?

1386
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,437
"Stop stalking me."

1387
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:18,645
In one day..one day..
like you said.

1388
01:20:18,978 --> 01:20:22,645
I am in your home,
your bedroom..

1389
01:20:23,728 --> 01:20:27,103
..in your husband's clothes.

1390
01:20:28,353 --> 01:20:30,562
That is stalking.

1391
01:20:31,728 --> 01:20:32,645
Great.

1392
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:34,978
You've proven that you a stalker.

1393
01:20:35,187 --> 01:20:36,312
What now?

1394
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,645
You know, Celina.

1395
01:20:39,645 --> 01:20:41,437
You always humiliated me.

1396
01:20:43,062 --> 01:20:45,145
I only wanted answers.
That's it.

1397
01:20:46,228 --> 01:20:48,770
What answers?
- Nice bed.

1398
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:52,148
There's no place
for anyone in my life..

1399
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:54,437
..except for Adi and Jahan.

1400
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,395
Why don't you get that?

1401
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:57,395
This Jahan.

1402
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,145
What a cute kid.

1403
01:21:00,228 --> 01:21:01,937
Why did I do it?
- Sorry.

1404
01:21:03,187 --> 01:21:03,812
I don't know.

1405
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:07,312
I thought I could handle it.

1406
01:21:08,478 --> 01:21:09,520
But I couldn't.

1407
01:21:10,728 --> 01:21:12,978
We all get weak sometime.

1408
01:21:13,312 --> 01:21:15,228
And while asking me for answers..

1409
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:18,687
..you completely forgot
that you're married.

1410
01:21:19,895 --> 01:21:23,645
You've a wife..who's probably
looking for answers too.

1411
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:27,353
That's between me and her, okay.

1412
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:31,478
And the roof you're standing under,
this my private matter.

1413
01:21:31,562 --> 01:21:33,395
My home..my family.

1414
01:21:34,187 --> 01:21:35,853
Look at yourself, Urvil.

1415
01:21:37,145 --> 01:21:39,270
What kind of woman
would like to be with you?

1416
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:43,645
I feel pity for your wife.

1417
01:21:44,187 --> 01:21:47,978
Her husband is like a mutt..
- Watch what you're saying.

1418
01:21:48,062 --> 01:21:50,645
He could never stick to one girl.

1419
01:21:50,895 --> 01:21:51,898
Get out of here!

1420
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:03,187
Who does she think she is?

1421
01:22:04,895 --> 01:22:05,728
Get lost.

1422
01:22:07,266 --> 01:22:10,520
How dare she..
She insulted me again.

1423
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:11,395
Urvil..

1424
01:22:11,773 --> 01:22:13,645
What's wrong, Urvil?
Are you okay? - What?

1425
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,103
Leave me alone.

1426
01:22:15,395 --> 01:22:16,895
What's wrong?
And whose clothes are you wearing?

1427
01:22:16,978 --> 01:22:17,853
What?

1428
01:22:18,895 --> 01:22:21,353
You're drunk again.
- So what?

1429
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,187
You always loved the smell of whiskey.
So what now?

1430
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,478
You would always be in your senses.
What's wrong with you?

1431
01:22:27,062 --> 01:22:30,228
You're just disgusting, Urvil.
- I am disgusting.

1432
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:33,395
Say it once again.
You find me disgusting.

1433
01:22:33,645 --> 01:22:35,187
Urvil, you're hurting me.
- I'll show you disgusting.

1434
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,228
Urvil, stop it.

1435
01:22:36,312 --> 01:22:37,562
You think I am disgusting, right?

1436
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:39,728
I'm disgusting.
- It's paining.

1437
01:22:40,062 --> 01:22:42,020
Yeah..this is what you like, huh?

1438
01:22:42,437 --> 01:22:43,770
Leave me.
- Isn't this what you want?

1439
01:22:44,978 --> 01:22:46,506
This is what you want?
- Leave me.

1440
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:47,838
Are you having fun?

1441
01:22:47,918 --> 01:22:49,437
Get off me!

1442
01:22:49,812 --> 01:22:50,728
Are you having fun?

1443
01:22:51,187 --> 01:22:52,245
Get off me!

1444
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:54,645
You're hurting me.
Let me go.

1445
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,145
I know what you like.

1446
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,728
Enjoy.

1447
01:22:59,645 --> 01:23:00,687
I'll show you.

1448
01:23:04,848 --> 01:23:05,728
Shut up!

1449
01:23:06,978 --> 01:23:09,853
You know what,
this is all your fault.

1450
01:23:10,772 --> 01:23:11,562
F*** you.

1451
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:12,645
F*** you!

1452
01:23:13,645 --> 01:23:15,478
You dare insult me.

1453
01:23:16,437 --> 01:23:18,853
This is all your fault.
Okay.

1454
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:20,520
All because of you.

1455
01:23:24,176 --> 01:23:26,228
You like insulting me, don't you?

1456
01:23:26,853 --> 01:23:28,561
Are you having fun?

1457
01:23:28,641 --> 01:23:30,964
Urvil. Its painting, Urvil.
- Disgusting, right?

1458
01:23:31,044 --> 01:23:34,482
Yeah. You like this?
- No.

1459
01:23:34,562 --> 01:23:36,103
Please stop it.
-I am nothing, right?

1460
01:23:36,895 --> 01:23:38,524
I am nothing.

1461
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,228
Why do you hate me so much?

1462
01:23:49,437 --> 01:23:51,812
Why do you hate me..Celina?

1463
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:03,017
Celina?

1464
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:12,645
I'll drop you.

1465
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:13,728
I am going to the office.

1466
01:24:13,808 --> 01:24:15,728
I know..I'll drop you.

1467
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:25,687
You know, Urvil.

1468
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,645
Last night you were taking
some Celina's name in your sleep.

1469
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:35,437
Stop talking nonsense
in the morning.

1470
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:41,353
You know, Urvil..

1471
01:24:42,103 --> 01:24:43,978
..I am not used to such love..

1472
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:46,103
Which I am getting
because of Celina?

1473
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:49,312
Who is she?

1474
01:24:49,604 --> 01:24:50,770
What the heck is wrong with you?

1475
01:24:52,395 --> 01:24:54,103
This is seriously messed up.

1476
01:24:55,054 --> 01:24:57,062
So messed up, isn't it?

1477
01:24:57,587 --> 01:24:58,988
Who is Celina?

1478
01:25:01,687 --> 01:25:03,853
What are you doing?
Drive properly.

1479
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:05,764
Every time you lie,
I'm going to speed up.

1480
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,562
What childishness is this?
Just drive properly, Simran.

1481
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:12,687
I've always given priority
to your happiness.

1482
01:25:14,978 --> 01:25:16,478
Simran, what are you doing?

1483
01:25:16,562 --> 01:25:17,853
I never asked you anything.

1484
01:25:19,187 --> 01:25:20,228
There's a car coming.

1485
01:25:20,437 --> 01:25:21,395
What are you doing?

1486
01:25:22,112 --> 01:25:24,023
Who is Celina?
- Just listen to me..okay.

1487
01:25:27,103 --> 01:25:30,395
Are you having an affair?
- No, I am not having an affair.

1488
01:25:30,645 --> 01:25:32,581
Then what is it?
- Simran, stop it. Seriously.

1489
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:33,687
Tell me who's Celina.

1490
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:35,145
Simran, stop the car!
We're going to crash!

1491
01:25:35,228 --> 01:25:37,895
Can't you see we've
already crashed, Urvil?

1492
01:25:37,978 --> 01:25:38,922
Simran, there's a truck
coming towards us.

1493
01:25:39,002 --> 01:25:41,437
Answer my questions. Answer me.
- We'll meet with an accident.

1494
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,145
Okay. I had a one
night stand with her.

1495
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,029
Sim stop! Sim!

1496
01:25:50,978 --> 01:25:54,951
Look..it just started
with a stupid bet..

1497
01:25:55,645 --> 01:25:57,075
..but this time things
were different.

1498
01:25:57,937 --> 01:25:58,812
Simran!

1499
01:26:01,228 --> 01:26:02,228
I am sorry.

1500
01:26:04,062 --> 01:26:06,020
Do you why it was
different this time?

1501
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,062
Because this is the one.

1502
01:26:08,312 --> 01:26:09,395
I am leaving you for.

1503
01:26:09,687 --> 01:26:11,270
Simran, are you crazy?

1504
01:26:11,353 --> 01:26:13,187
Please step out of the car.
- Simran, listen to me.

1505
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:14,520
Let's talk this out, please.

1506
01:26:14,687 --> 01:26:15,645
Step out of the car.

1507
01:26:17,978 --> 01:26:19,103
Simran..
- Step out now!

1508
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:22,920
OUT.

1509
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:31,512
And don't come back.

1510
01:26:38,538 --> 01:26:45,933
"After shattering my dreams.."

1511
01:26:47,783 --> 01:26:55,228
"..why did you set
out on a different path?"

1512
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:00,228
"I miss you."

1513
01:27:01,053 --> 01:27:04,026
"What do I say.."

1514
01:27:04,106 --> 01:27:13,188
"..only thing that's
left are your memories."

1515
01:27:14,567 --> 01:27:16,893
"What do I do?"

1516
01:27:16,973 --> 01:27:19,237
"What do I do?"

1517
01:27:19,393 --> 01:27:24,106
"My tears prick me."

1518
01:27:24,186 --> 01:27:26,390
"What do I do?"

1519
01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:28,924
"What do I do?"

1520
01:27:29,004 --> 01:27:32,815
"My fate's ruined."

1521
01:27:32,895 --> 01:27:36,770
"What do I do?"

1522
01:27:37,754 --> 01:27:43,270
"What do I do?"

1523
01:27:46,737 --> 01:27:47,645
Sim, I am sorry.

1524
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,645
Simran..
- Sim, please talk to me. Listen to me.

1525
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,395
What are you doing here?
- Diya, please let me talk to her..

1526
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:54,812
Urvil.. - Simran doesn't
want to talk to you.

1527
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:56,448
This is what I had warned you off.

1528
01:27:56,645 --> 01:27:57,645
You knew!

1529
01:28:02,547 --> 01:28:06,812
"Only your shadow's left with me."

1530
01:28:06,892 --> 01:28:11,230
"All you left for me is loneliness."

1531
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:19,937
"There's nothing..I
desired except for you."

1532
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:25,062
"Where do I go.."

1533
01:28:25,142 --> 01:28:29,645
"..I see no destination."

1534
01:28:29,853 --> 01:28:33,837
"You don't ask my condition."

1535
01:28:34,653 --> 01:28:37,599
"I think about you."

1536
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:47,387
"I can't forget the past moments,
listen to me."

1537
01:28:48,241 --> 01:28:50,559
"What do I do?"

1538
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,937
"What do I do?"

1539
01:28:53,017 --> 01:28:57,687
"My tears prick me."

1540
01:28:57,767 --> 01:29:00,179
"What do I do?"

1541
01:29:00,259 --> 01:29:02,507
"What do I do?"

1542
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:06,381
"My fate's ruined."

1543
01:29:06,461 --> 01:29:10,344
"What do I do?"

1544
01:29:11,306 --> 01:29:15,750
"What do I do?"

1545
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:42,645
I want to meet you.

1546
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:44,687
Okay.

1547
01:29:55,228 --> 01:29:56,187
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

1548
01:29:56,353 --> 01:29:57,228
So your wife left you?

1549
01:29:57,455 --> 01:29:59,437
Celina, please..not today.

1550
01:29:59,682 --> 01:30:03,687
For the last time, I am Ambar.
Not Celina.

1551
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:05,687
Then why did you lie that night?

1552
01:30:06,853 --> 01:30:09,103
You didn't tell the truth either.

1553
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:12,562
Yes, but..
- What?

1554
01:30:13,185 --> 01:30:15,145
Just because you're a man..

1555
01:30:15,228 --> 01:30:17,270
..you've a right to do this.

1556
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:19,687
You ruined my life.

1557
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,770
Not me. You did it yourself.

1558
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,395
You were responsible too.

1559
01:30:24,693 --> 01:30:26,353
What's your problem, Urvil?

1560
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:30,728
Is it that I did it,
or because I got away with it?

1561
01:30:33,939 --> 01:30:35,643
What are you so arrogant about?

1562
01:30:36,214 --> 01:30:37,895
The husband you're so proud of..

1563
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:41,645
..I would love to see his
face when I tell him everything.

1564
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,187
Blackmail..

1565
01:30:44,228 --> 01:30:46,645
Is that all you have?

1566
01:30:47,103 --> 01:30:48,935
What will happen
when you tell him?

1567
01:30:49,395 --> 01:30:51,645
He'll throw me out..

1568
01:30:51,728 --> 01:30:55,770
..and I'll come begging
and pleading to you.

1569
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:57,520
Isn't that what you thought?

1570
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:00,895
Because I am a woman.

1571
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:04,353
I cannot survive without a man.

1572
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:07,645
Women like you can't
live without a man.

1573
01:31:08,187 --> 01:31:09,645
Oh sorry, in your case..

1574
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,520
Without men.

1575
01:31:11,895 --> 01:31:15,726
What's wrong, Urvil?
Why this hatred?

1576
01:31:17,395 --> 01:31:20,395
Is it because your wife left you?

1577
01:31:20,728 --> 01:31:23,353
Or because I hurt your ego?

1578
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:28,312
By the way..what gives
you the right to judge me?

1579
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,228
Is this why you called me here?

1580
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,520
No!

1581
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:36,687
To tell you..that
I will tell Adi myself.

1582
01:31:36,937 --> 01:31:39,228
You do not get that satisfaction!

1583
01:31:39,978 --> 01:31:42,645
Even if he throws me out..

1584
01:31:43,478 --> 01:31:48,353
Remember..I will never come to you.

1585
01:31:48,728 --> 01:31:50,020
Do you understand?

1586
01:31:52,645 --> 01:31:54,103
We both made a mistake.

1587
01:31:57,145 --> 01:31:59,395
Then why should
I pay the price alone?

1588
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:07,395
Because I won't..ruin my entire life
over a single mistake like you.

1589
01:32:07,853 --> 01:32:11,129
And Urvil, a man that can..

1590
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:16,886
..put his 5 year old relation
at stake for a one night stand..

1591
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:19,092
..can never be loyal to me.

1592
01:32:39,951 --> 01:32:40,945
Hello.

1593
01:32:41,767 --> 01:32:45,053
Adi..there's something
I want to tell you.

1594
01:32:56,682 --> 01:33:01,849
'And this way, my life
..came to a standstill.'

1595
01:33:03,342 --> 01:33:05,057
'That's the problem with life.'

1596
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,891
'You make mistakes
in a single moment.'

1597
01:33:09,474 --> 01:33:13,099
'But the punishment
..lasts for a long time.'

1598
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:16,432
'I had two choices.'

1599
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,682
'Either I consider this my end..'

1600
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:22,224
'..or make a new beginning.'

1601
01:33:24,043 --> 01:33:28,821
'From where I was standing..
both the paths seemed faded.'

1602
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,632
'I used to think..
I allowed myself to stagger.'

1603
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,325
'Let's try to compose
myself this time.'

1604
01:33:38,783 --> 01:33:41,200
'And turn this 'the end' into
a new beginning.'
