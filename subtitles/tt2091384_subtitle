1
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,799
Ingratitude to the man who
has helped is sin,

2
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:15,103
the man who helped you
expecting gratitude is also sin.

3
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:21,008
It's not great to be
part of history, Kulkarni,

4
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,240
having a history to
ourselves is great!

5
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,385
Entire state is under
Bhagawan's control,

6
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,989
that's why all of us are under his shadow,
so he gets all the business,

7
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,980
what if Bhagawan dies?

8
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,157
What if we kill him?

9
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,291
You're wrong.

10
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,968
Brother, please listen to him.

11
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,471
Bhagawan's son Munna is coming
back to India after 8 years,

12
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,673
Bhagawan will go personally
to receive him,

13
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:04,355
we're getting 300 grams of
gelatin sticks for Rs.16 only,

14
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,683
if we blow, even rocks would
be blown to smithereens,

15
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:11,487
there's a culvert on the way
back to Bhagawan's home,

16
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:14,165
5 gelatin sticks under it.

17
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,876
You're committing a big mistake.

18
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,042
You're new to this business.

19
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,048
I'd been with Bhagawan for 10 years.

20
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,152
I know about every member of his gang.

21
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:37,919
Bhagawan isn't just one man!

22
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,723
My boys will take care of Guru.

23
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,290
Yes, I'm Guruvaiah here.

24
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,159
No... no I'll be there.

25
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,199
Make it fast!

26
00:04:55,275 --> 00:05:00,076
I'm not saying about Guru,
I said about Bhagawan's shadow.

27
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,447
I meant about Bhagawan's strength.

28
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,587
About Jai!

29
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,761
He'll die first!

30
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,921
Car stopped!
What could be the reason?

31
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,098
How would I know? Let's check!

32
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,377
Can I make a phone call?

33
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,313
Listen to me,
escape while still alive.

34
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,954
You're still alive because of Veeru.

35
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,556
If not I would've killed you long back.

36
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:32,131
There's much difference between
killing me and you getting killed.

37
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,357
Do you know what it is? Jai!

38
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,238
He's here!
This is your last chance.

39
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:01,259
Don't leave him.
- I'll not. I'll kill him.

40
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:11,335
Hey, jump over the wall and escape.
I'll not tell anyone.

41
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,268
I told you to shut up, right? Shut up!

42
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,448
Hey, escape I say!

43
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,622
Come... come...

44
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,129
Shut up!

45
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:19,169
You've come after 8 years,
I'm very happy sir.

46
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:22,570
I feel like seeing your father
in his youth.

47
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:24,573
But I'm really sad, uncle.

48
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,304
28 years have passed,
I thought you'd be dead,

49
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,845
you're still alive!

50
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:45,649
Your razor sharp eyes are
pouncing paws...

51
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,150
Fire spitting breath is your paw...

52
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,482
Hot blood flowing in nerves is paw...

53
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,851
Energy is every cell is paw...

54
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,324
Unstoppable speed is paw...

55
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,690
Devil-may-care attitude is paw...

56
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,025
Silence on lips is paw...

57
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,964
Lightning decisions is paw...

58
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:08,103
Like a simmering fire hidden underneath
like darkness hiding in night...

59
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:13,041
If it's unavoidable war,
won't see tomorrow's dawn...

60
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:17,478
Sky is your paw...

61
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,553
Win over it with courage...

62
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:27,091
Ferociousness is your paw...

63
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,823
March forward as vitality
to end the evil...

64
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,977
Check it, dad. It has everything.

65
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,414
Like them!

66
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:31,090
Like him!

67
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,916
Aren't you ajoker?

68
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:43,293
Politicians, Industrialists, IAS, IPS,
all these people have power.

69
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:46,303
But the control is in my hands.

70
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:51,774
That's why people like us are
called as power managers.

71
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:57,177
And today, power is the most
powerful amongst everything,

72
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,942
including lives!

73
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,953
Why didn't you come to
airport to receive me?

74
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,381
Had I come there,
we wouldn't be meeting here?

75
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,992
Munna, you appear to have grown thin.

76
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:09,560
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come?

77
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:10,491
Why didn't I come?

78
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,654
Few minutes late,
you would've come to see me.

79
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,595
Don't talk rubbish!

80
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:20,064
Is there anything I should know?

81
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:28,142
If there's anything I need to tell you,
you don't have to ask me, dada.

82
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:33,808
Do you know how the bomb reached
Veeru's car from culvert?

83
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:36,649
You didn't expect me here, right?

84
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,657
I told him you're committing
a big mistake.

85
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,994
For how many years I know you?

86
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,630
What's your problem?

87
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:53,498
According to the natural law ofjustice,
big fish eats the small fish in lake.

88
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,975
What's this lake? Tell me who is
big fish and who is small fish?

89
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:05,850
This business is the lake.
Big lake!

90
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:08,348
Bhagawan is the big fish.

91
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,348
I'm a small fish.

92
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,787
You know you're a small fish, right?
Tell me further.

93
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,190
For any job in this state,
people come to you.

94
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,659
Everyone come to you.
- So what?

95
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,992
If everyone go to you,
how am I to run my business?

96
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,658
That's your problem,
what do you want me to do?

97
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:24,825
Close your eyes.

98
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,995
I know very well what you would
do if I close my eyes.

99
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:29,073
You don't know how much
is my offer, right?

100
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:30,537
How much?

101
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:38,383
Kulkarni, don't try to become
Bhagawan of this city.

102
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:46,181
Either you or if anyone else tries,
I'll kill you first. Mind it!

103
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:49,351
When I broke away from
Bhagawan 4 years ago,

104
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,655
you promised not to kill me.

105
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,628
Your word has value, Jai.

106
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,394
What the hell he gives a word, brother?
What if we kill him?

107
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,136
Don't kill him.

108
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:02,868
I promised not to kill Kulkarni not you.

109
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:11,416
What's this?
Why are you so loyal to Bhagawan?

110
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,244
You may not understand
even if I tell you.

111
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:15,653
Tell me, I'll try to understand.

112
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,080
It's known as loyalty! Loyalty!

113
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,190
I said you'll not understand it.

114
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:27,196
Why do you ask things
which you can't understand?

115
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,731
Guruvaiah, come.

116
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:15,638
Caress me sensuously
with your hands...

117
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,806
Waiting for sensitive touch...

118
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:22,420
Come like hot embrace and
light fire of passion in me...

119
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:26,786
Take out life from me
and instill a new life in me...

120
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,123
Squeeze me like pillow and
douse the raging fire of desire...

121
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:35,893
You've got me like treasure
never even dreamed about...

122
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:59,848
What do you apply to those legs?
They's shining!

123
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:04,187
8 years ago you weren't
so voluminous.

124
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,660
2You've changed a lot.

125
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,533
You haven't changed at all.

126
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,002
Still don't know how to talk.

127
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,742
When I'm here, where are you going?

128
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,539
There many who go mad
on seeing me,

129
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:25,710
there are many more who would
die if they don't see me.

130
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:52,133
I'm a beautiful female cheetah...
always pouncing hungrily...

131
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:56,408
I love playing with the hunter's spear...

132
00:18:56,582 --> 00:19:00,780
I'll come to you willingly
on my own free will...

133
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:05,219
I'll haul and maul you
with my passions...

134
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:09,293
Caress like gentle breeze and
hound me like thunder...

135
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:14,229
Make me squeal with the pain of
pleasure with your youthful force...

136
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:02,807
Hey look! For me only!

137
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:06,007
You're dead man!
Leave me boys!

138
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,085
Why did you beat me now?

139
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:12,315
How dare you see Jahnavi?
I'll kill you. - Come on!

140
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:14,482
Come on shoot me if you've guts.

141
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,521
Leave me, I'll kill him.
How dare you want Jahnavi!

142
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:19,789
Gurubhai, please come immediately,
Munna is creating terrible here.

143
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:22,798
I'll kill him...
he'll die in my hands today.

144
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,300
Gaurav, leave him,
Munna is Bhagawan's son.

145
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,998
Let him be Bhagawan's son or
anyone else, I don't care!

146
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:30,301
I'll kill him, tell him to say sorry.

147
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,876
Gaurav, give me the gun first.

148
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,307
Look at him Jai! What has he done?

149
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:35,343
I'm seeing, give me your gun first.

150
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:38,608
No, he's dead today,
will he kill for seeing Jahnavi?

151
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,012
I'll kill if you see her.

152
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,517
I'll talk to him, give me the gun.

153
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:43,552
What's this Munna?

154
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,350
You've to shut down the club if you
don't want anyone to see Jahnavi.

155
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,857
Silly creep! Bloody crap!

156
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,490
Where did you get this gun?

157
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,465
Do you've license?

158
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,860
Does your father know this?

159
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:58,162
You're going to London for MC,
why are you carrying a gun?

160
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,897
Do you know the future of
man holding a gun? Do you know?

161
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,807
Do you know?

162
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:04,502
Go... go...

163
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,896
Did you see? Did you see him?

164
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,494
Go!

165
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,072
It seems you wanted to see me, Dada.

166
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,512
Who am I to you, Jai?

167
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,949
Please don't take the club
incident seriously.

168
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:54,416
No, please tell me Jai.
Who am I to you?

169
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,096
You're everything to me, dada.
You too know it very well.

170
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,565
If you do anything for profit,
it's business,

171
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,762
if you do anything for good deeds
it's piousness,

172
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,100
if you do anything without
any expectation it's service.

173
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,770
The help and courage you gave in the
matter of my sister and mother,

174
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,780
I can never forget in my life.

175
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,617
I'm not here because
you'll support me,

176
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:22,617
I'm here to be as your shadow.

177
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,180
Will you be Munna's shadow too?

178
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:28,986
Don't think too much,
why are you asking me anyway?

179
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,097
Just told me who am I to you,

180
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:38,096
I know how much you value my word,

181
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:43,141
Jai, please take care of Munna.

182
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:48,471
How you looked after me, you must
look after Munna too just like that.

183
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:52,643
You will, I trust you will.

184
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:00,017
Everyone wants something in life,

185
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:04,819
money, position, status,
pleasure or something,

186
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:09,293
but I want the happiness I've lost.

187
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,626
I want love.

188
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,127
I've been searching for 20 long years.

189
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,634
This nursery is manifestation
of my memories.

190
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,175
Everything is fine but
something is not fine, Chotu.

191
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:30,515
Everything is fine but
something is not fine.

192
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:35,689
Why are you repeating it?
- I'm feeling, not repeating.

193
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:44,528
Good, there are plants, pots,
appears to be beautiful,

194
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:45,897
but something is missing.

195
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:51,031
Good, there are plants, pots,
appears to be beautiful,

196
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,871
but something is missing.

197
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:56,279
What else can I do?
I watered the plants,

198
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,541
used slices of onions, egg shells,

199
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,582
tied threads for creepers,
and built protective cover.

200
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:01,549
What else can I do?

201
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:03,548
I've given a paper ad.

202
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:11,222
If you give an ad in paper,
would plants grow here?

203
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,897
Is this your nursery?

204
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:24,239
Is this your nursery?

205
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,237
Come in from that side.

206
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:38,154
Whose owns this nursery?
- I own it.

207
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,922
I've not seen any place here
more beautiful than this.

208
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:48,565
But who is the caretaker
who maintains it so clumsily?

209
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:53,296
Tell me.

210
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,997
Growing plants is science.

211
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:58,200
He's the caretaker, he reads the books.

212
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:02,837
It's not in books,
we need food for strength,

213
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:05,006
plants need mud,
- Mud?

214
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,311
They need water for thirst,
- Water?

215
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:09,681
If it's sunny, it needs shade,
- Shade?

216
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:13,552
If it's dusty, it needs bath,
and a way to grow,

217
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:18,128
Is there so much?
- Plants too need love just like us.

218
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,423
Love?

219
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:24,200
Didn't I tell you plants too need love?
Did you listen to me?

220
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,167
Didn't I tell you plants too need love?

221
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,331
Did you listen to me?
When did you tell me?

222
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:32,136
I told you but failed to
understand it, you dullard.

223
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,973
By the way, who are you?

224
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:41,650
That's him, the man with beard.

225
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:43,979
He'll plant something!

226
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:51,285
Do you've to study so much
to grow plants?

227
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:53,294
Chotu, please...

228
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,000
How will you make this beautiful
nursery more beautiful?

229
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:03,733
Small correction.

230
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:08,011
How will you beautify this bad
and ugly nursery?

231
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,340
What if I make it?

232
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:04,397
Every moment is filled with
freshness of greenery...

233
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:11,338
It's true you're my life forever...

234
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:25,117
May I share your grief...
may I enhance your happiness...

235
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:31,991
This world smiles along
with our smile...

236
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:39,399
O friend, I'm coming...
I'll give my life for you...

237
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,927
Is it good?
- Very good.

238
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,931
She has grown the plants with songs.

239
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,475
Shall I also try?
- No please.

240
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,414
Sandhya, take whatever you want.
- Take it.

241
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,143
Get the cheque book.

242
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,154
Don't stare like an owl,
get the cheque book. Go!

243
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,918
He'll give cheques to women.

244
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:35,753
Ask whatever you want for
the job well done, Sandhya?

245
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,327
How much will you pay me?

246
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:41,131
It's priceless!
Whatever you may ask!

247
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:43,634
Take it.

248
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:49,136
Please bend down.
- Why?

249
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:50,797
Shut up and bend.

250
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:51,806
Come near.

251
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:57,475
Tell me Sandhya,
I've the cheque book and pen.

252
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,844
How much? - Rs.1 or 2 lakhs?

253
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:05,346
Rs.70 lakhs!

254
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:07,954
A row house in gated community!

255
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,020
Rs.2 crores!

256
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,565
What else?
Give her this nursery too!

257
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:18,498
We both can work for her then.

258
00:29:18,837 --> 00:29:21,362
I didn't do this for money, Jai.

259
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:27,311
Many people are cutting down trees
to make roads for selfish ends,

260
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,572
bringing down mountains
to build homes,

261
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:31,613
filling up lakes to build colonies,

262
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:34,718
very few people are growing plants,

263
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:36,820
I love people who do it.

264
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,216
That's why I did it.

265
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,021
How come the door is open?

266
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,031
The door is open, you fool.
- How would I know?

267
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,499
I told you many times not to give
the duplicate keys to her.

268
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,166
No, I didn't give.
She took it from me.

269
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,869
If I refuse she threatened to get me
beaten up by hired goons.

270
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:05,082
If I kill you, it'll end my problems.

271
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,578
Check what she's up to!

272
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:14,421
Come out! Enough of taking bath,
come out Janu.

273
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:18,523
Is tap dry in your flat?

274
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,722
No, but water isn't so good there.

275
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,890
I've warned you many times
not to come here.

276
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,859
As many times as you
may warn, I'll come.

277
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:29,370
I feel very safe here, Jai.

278
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:33,908
Are you scared?
- Scared? Munna!

279
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:38,615
I feel like scorpions and snakes
running all over me on seeing him.

280
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:46,656
Don't know why he makes phone calls
and when he would barge into my flat?

281
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:52,457
I switch off lights in my flat and
make him believe I'm not there.

282
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,108
I'm out somewhere.

283
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:14,312
He's the right man for you,
settle down with him.

284
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:21,483
I've been asking you so many times,
why don't you marry me?

285
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:28,796
It isn't that Janu, for marriage,
you must feel like getting married.

286
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,628
I don't have it.
- Why don't you have it?

287
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:31,799
Why don't I've it?

288
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,533
How am I to explain? But I've to.

289
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:39,337
Jahnavi, we both grew up together
with Dada from childhood,

290
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:43,842
when I see you I feel like a family...

291
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:50,078
Please don't say feel like sister,
I'll jump out from here to death.

292
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:53,190
No, please don't die.
Don't die.

293
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,695
Take bath here everyday, be happy.

294
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:08,230
I'll give 35 acres of my land
for your new project, Jai.

295
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:12,240
But I've to get few approvals
from Govt. Will you get it?

296
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,868
Talk about business with Bhagawan.
Tell me if you face any problems.

297
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:18,379
Aren't the paying salaries properly,
they're shouting slogans.

298
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,713
Not for salaries but for killing trees
because of my factory in Midnapore.

299
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:24,752
Trees?

300
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:28,825
There's no one to care if humans die,
are there people to worry about trees too?

301
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:33,195
If you take care of it...
- If told Narsing will take care.

302
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:34,024
Come.

303
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:43,205
There's some trouble before Omega office,
come with your boys and clear it.

304
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:48,210
Shut down the factory!

305
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:54,917
What happened?

306
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:56,884
Just now remembered
something I need to do.

307
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:59,421
Come, I'll also join you.
- You carry on, I'll join you.

308
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:00,250
Okay.

309
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:06,086
Shut down the Omega factory!

310
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:12,600
Shut down the Omega factory!

311
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:19,239
Me?

312
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:21,605
Shut down...

313
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,882
Do you know there are no rains?

314
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,450
It's summer, right?

315
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,789
No, monsoon is not coming in time.

316
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:42,892
We'll not budge till that
bandicoot shuts it down.

317
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,866
Save trees!

318
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,372
Just a minute, I'll come back.

319
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:53,807
Where are you going?
Hold the placard high!

320
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:55,306
Okay... keep doing it.

321
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,641
Shut down the factory!

322
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,148
People are protesting outside, right?

323
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:08,417
Can't you find out their demands
and clear them out?

324
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:11,084
That is...
- This is unwanted nuisance.

325
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:14,394
You told me look after
the proposals, right?

326
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:16,557
I'll talk to Bhagawan personally.

327
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:19,135
I'll talk to him personally.
Okay?

328
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,775
It's lunch time,
all of you go home.

329
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,849
Is he sending goons?

330
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,984
You don't have a drop of blood in
body yet make so much noise.

331
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,919
What man? Will you beat me?

332
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,753
All of you would get beaten up,
clear out immediately.

333
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:48,490
If you beat us,
trees will take revenge on you.

334
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,827
How can trees take revenge?

335
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:53,129
Hey you... get the sticks boys!

336
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:56,796
Shut it down! Don't get scared!

337
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:58,976
Will you beat us?

338
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,338
Why did you stop?

339
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,210
Are you scared?

340
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,042
Come...

341
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:08,879
Come on beat me!
- Back off boys... go.

342
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:13,987
He got scared! Shut down the factory!

343
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:19,054
Save the green cover!

344
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:25,191
One minute! All of you please stop!

345
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:28,238
You called on phone just now, right sir?

346
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,032
I told you, right?
- Sir sent me.

347
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,506
He promised to discuss with
them tomorrow morning. - Okay.

348
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:33,575
Tell them!

349
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:36,009
Listen, sir has promised to talk
to you tomorrow morning.

350
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:37,079
You?

351
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:45,750
Get down here!

352
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,425
No problem.

353
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,859
Do you know Karan?

354
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:55,898
My gang mate... batch mate.

355
00:35:57,268 --> 00:36:01,534
I didn't know he's your batch mate
and called him buffalo.

356
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:02,400
No problem.

357
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,400
I called him a bandicoot also.

358
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:07,770
He looks like one, right? No problem.

359
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:19,116
Can I tell you something, Sandhya?

360
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,379
What's it?

361
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:23,789
You look more beautiful while laughing,
why did you stop it anyway?

362
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,267
What do you do?

363
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:46,942
There are few little gaps between public,
private sectors and govt. Servants.

364
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:48,983
We fill those gaps.

365
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,121
You wanted to say something.

366
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:02,790
Me?

367
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,465
You said, right?
- Did I?

368
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:07,065
You did.

369
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,001
Where?

370
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:13,836
That is... l'll tell after coming back.

371
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,304
I'll be back in a sec.

372
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:24,785
What are you doing man?

373
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,121
What sir?

374
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,685
I'm not talking to you sir,
you please carry on.

375
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:34,029
You fix a deadline for anything
and complete it within that time.

376
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:36,098
Fix a deadline for this too
and complete it.

377
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,701
How can you fix a deadline
for this too sir?

378
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,570
I'm not talking to you sir,
you please carry on.

379
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,172
Over sir.
- Get lost!

380
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,703
No need. Go away!

381
00:37:53,751 --> 00:38:00,987
Jai, if you like Sandhya,
tell her directly you like her.

382
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:05,188
How am I to tell her?
Say it with your mouth, you fool.

383
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:07,058
Asking me how am I to tell?

384
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:11,634
Don't ask such silly questions,
if you can't tell her,

385
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:14,203
then tell her I'm busy and
can't roam like this.

386
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:20,741
That's all but you...

387
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,383
Why did you take so much time?

388
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:34,321
Sandhya, now...
where shall we go now?

389
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,261
How am I to tell her?

390
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:56,771
How am I to show the love in me?

391
00:38:56,948 --> 00:39:03,854
How am I to stop the flow of Godavari
in dusty desert of my life?

392
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:10,791
How am I to believe this myth?

393
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:17,828
How am I to express my love?

394
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:24,966
I've got back my life again
with your friendship...

395
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:43,316
I don't remember even a second
from past at this moment...

396
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:50,485
Life is celebrating the
festivities of present...

397
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:57,123
This friendship is boon and
this realisation is true...

398
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:04,537
Run out of words to express this...

399
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:11,771
Sweetness in my language...
Greenery in my path...

400
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:15,316
A smile as innocent as a child...

401
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:22,585
You've induced my life
to join your life...

402
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,820
And be companion for
the journey of this life...

403
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:31,731
I'm ecstatic with those feelings...

404
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:58,949
Did you say something now?

405
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:01,021
No.

406
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,790
I felt like you said something.

407
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:06,785
Did you hear it?

408
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:10,327
Did you say anything?
- No... no...

409
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:12,664
How could she hear it?

410
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:25,141
Ashok brother!

411
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:27,075
When did you come?
- Just now dear.

412
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,809
Couldn't you've taken the keys
from Chatterjee uncle's house?

413
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:30,715
No problem, anyway you'll be back, right?

414
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:32,879
Give me the bag.
- No, give it.

415
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,992
What's the news?

416
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,357
Nothing, Sambasiva's case adjournment.

417
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,623
It seems someone is helping
from Govt. Side.

418
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,632
How are you doing?
Is Chatterjee looking after you well?

419
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:46,698
I'm fine brother.

420
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:49,873
I want to meet grandma.
I feel like going back to home.

421
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:52,099
You can come dear, don't rush.

422
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,710
Grandma gave this pickle for you.

423
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:04,250
Pack my bag, I've to go out.

424
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:25,975
Did you buy these yourself?

425
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:29,010
Won't it look odd if others
buy it for us?

426
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,618
Did you buy it for yourself?
- For myself only!

427
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:39,884
Since how long you've been
wearing these clothes?

428
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:42,924
For an year now.
Don't you know it?

429
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:47,021
For a year? I've never seen this earlier.

430
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:48,859
Keep it out, I've to go out.

431
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:52,297
You've changed completely, Jai.
- Just do what I say.

432
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:53,130
Okay.

433
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:01,104
What's this?

434
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:03,974
You told me to take it out,
I've kept it ready.

435
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:06,339
Are these worn by men?

436
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:08,815
You said you'll wear it,
so I kept it ready.

437
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,510
These are not mine, you fool!

438
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:11,712
Whose are these?

439
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,315
In the shopping mall, she...

440
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,152
You mean... friend...

441
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:21,423
She wanted to shop so...
- Wanted to shop...

442
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,793
Don't repeat it.

443
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:25,631
Jahnavi too knows her.

444
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:28,770
Janu too knows her?

445
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:32,500
Jahnavi and Chandini are close friends.

446
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:37,945
So, you're saying about Chandini, right?

447
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:40,015
Who are you talking about then?

448
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:46,184
Chotu, man mustn't have so many doubts.
If he does, he'll die.

449
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:50,516
But you say Chandini,
are you serious about her?

450
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,527
Waved green flag.

451
00:45:59,437 --> 00:46:03,601
What are you thinking?
- Nothing, my job is over here.

452
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:06,538
I've to find another nursery to work.

453
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:10,539
You said there's no nursery
like this in Kolkata, right?

454
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,681
Have you forgotten it?

455
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,406
Why not?

456
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:17,315
On Ras Behari road, it you take left,
you can find just one like this.

457
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:19,221
What's it dear?
- I think you've forgotten it.

458
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,890
This is Ras Behari road,
if you take a left turn...

459
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:24,220
You'll find a similar nursery, right?
- Is it?

460
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:26,897
But there isn't another one
like this, right?

461
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:29,156
Like you repeat everything,
why not this too?

462
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,531
No, it's closed, he gave it to
the girl who worked there.

463
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,534
She's running a club and
dances there.

464
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:39,337
There's a small branch is
bent outside, repair it.

465
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,876
You mean on the left side, right? Okay.

466
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,905
I said there's no other nursery like this.

467
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,914
Then, I'll go back to home.

468
00:46:51,188 --> 00:46:53,452
I've to come to your place
to meet you, right?

469
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:57,092
Why would you feel like meeting me?

470
00:46:58,095 --> 00:46:59,585
Why?

471
00:47:10,274 --> 00:47:13,903
Can I ask you a thing?
Go ahead, ask.

472
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,938
Do you've girl friends?

473
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:20,213
Why did you ask that?

474
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:23,444
You're handsome, stylish,

475
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:31,792
There are not many reasons
for not liking you.

476
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:33,756
But I couldn't understand one thing.

477
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:36,261
Why do you always keep
an eye on watch?

478
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,768
Your legs never stand in one place.

479
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:41,802
As if your feet are having springs.

480
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:44,406
Those hands never come
out of the pockets.

481
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:45,473
Why?

482
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:52,648
I don't know if she's praising me
or accusing me?

483
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:00,420
How could she ask me like that?
- What sir?

484
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:04,316
I'm talking to myself,
you carry on.

485
00:48:05,162 --> 00:48:07,926
How could she ask me
if I've girl friends or not?

486
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:09,622
Couldn't you've said it's you?

487
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,968
She says girls don't have many
reasons for disliking you.

488
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:16,330
So, she likes you or not?

489
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:18,665
Clear it yourself.

490
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:20,902
You must have 100% clarity on it.

491
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:28,515
Stand steady.

492
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:32,519
Remove your hands from the pockets.

493
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:36,855
Go and tell Sandhya that you
don't have any girl friends.

494
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:39,457
I don't have any girl friends.

495
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:42,660
Were you thinking about this inside?

496
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:47,898
Where do I've time to meet girl friends?
I'm busy always.

497
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:49,004
You?

498
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:55,877
Either you're in nursery or with me.
When are you busy anyway?

499
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:58,875
I don't have any girl friends.

500
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:18,697
She is... she is... forgot her name...

501
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,130
Janu... I remember now.

502
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:23,799
What are you doing here?

503
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:28,210
We were walking down,
came here for a good cup of coffee.

504
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:30,045
How come you're here?

505
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,241
I was going down here,
came in for a coffee.

506
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:39,089
We need to talk.

507
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,016
Definitely.

508
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:44,760
We need to talk!

509
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:10,451
Traffic, so...

510
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:30,096
Turned it to silent mode.
Didn't cut it, right?

511
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:32,799
What did you say?
- Please listen to me, Janu.

512
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:38,414
Excuse me... she's Jahnavi, right?
- Nothing like that...

513
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:43,919
We can discuss this.
Please listen to me.

514
00:50:44,088 --> 00:50:46,249
Why should I discuss with you?

515
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:49,815
We can discuss.

516
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:50,652
How dare!
- Please listen to me.

517
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:55,957
What?
- Come here.

518
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:56,792
I've urgent work.

519
00:50:57,634 --> 00:50:59,124
Don't you know my name?

520
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:02,796
Stop... who is she?
- Please listen to me.

521
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,907
Tell me who she is?

522
00:51:04,074 --> 00:51:09,137
Will you tell me or not?
- Please listen to me.

523
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:19,519
Take a deep breathe.

524
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:26,691
Stop... why are you beating again?

525
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:37,531
Is she more beautiful than me?

526
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:43,535
Nothing... nothing...

527
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:51,215
Tell me one thing, you're refusing to marry
me because I'm a club dancer.

528
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:53,546
Shut up, I don't have such idea.

529
00:51:53,724 --> 00:52:01,130
I like you Janu but for marriage...
I told you already.

530
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:09,362
It's all over, right?
I can't come in as I wish here.

531
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:16,209
Can't take bath here,
can't stay with you here.

532
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:19,581
No, nothing will change.

533
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,913
Got it? You'll have the same
freedom as you enjoy now.

534
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:26,245
Don't think too much and
pound your brain.

535
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,399
What's this sir?

536
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:40,933
I feel like stealing on seeing
so much money.

537
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:42,594
Tell me how much you've stolen?

538
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,070
Keep quiet sir.

539
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:48,170
I'm asking ignorantly,
where have you hidden the money?

540
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:50,779
Are you having any concubine?

541
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,047
No... no sir.

542
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,550
Am I eloping with you wife?
- Mind your language sir.

543
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:03,659
That's my money,
what bothers you if I take it?

544
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:08,855
You're just a dog under my feet.
Be like a dog.

545
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:15,328
Indeed I'm a dog, I'm loyal
so your father gave me this job.

546
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,439
But please don't touch money.

547
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,002
No sir, please don't take money.
Please go away.

548
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,808
Please go away from here sir.
Please go sir.

549
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:38,159
What's this sir?
- What man?

550
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:51,999
Just a kid, leave it.

551
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:57,372
Sir, please talk to Munna,
he may change his attitude.

552
00:53:57,581 --> 00:54:02,177
You should be taking care of him
but what's this?

553
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:07,682
You know I don't like anything
against my son Munna.

554
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:11,521
No Bhagawan,
please talk Munna once...

555
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:15,993
Go.

556
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:31,607
Why are you here sir?

557
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:35,081
What's your problem man?
- What happened sir?

558
00:54:35,252 --> 00:54:37,379
How dare you complain
to my father about me?

559
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:41,388
What are you doing?
- Get lost! Stay out!

560
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:44,656
How dare you complain
to my father about me?

561
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:46,159
It's for your good only sir.

562
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,924
For my good? I know what's good for me,
who are you care about me?

563
00:54:49,099 --> 00:54:50,031
Mind your business.

564
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:57,063
People are watching sir.
Leave me sir.

565
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:02,341
How dare you push me!

566
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:05,912
How dare you!

567
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:11,586
My father too never dared to touch me!

568
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,230
That's you... this is you!

569
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:31,772
Go and tell my father now.

570
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:34,766
Tell him Munna pissed on you.
Let me see.

571
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,778
If you tell, I'll kill you.

572
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:05,437
I told you when all the doors close,
a new door will open up for us.

573
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,988
How dare he betrays me
and escapes!

574
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:31,458
And that too goes to Kulkarni
who left me.

575
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:36,004
No use in discussing past,
let's think about the future.

576
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:41,473
Saba knows everything about
what we have and where it is.

577
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:02,396
Killing Saba is the only way.

578
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:06,002
I don't know why are you
discussing for this?

579
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:09,263
If you spare a betrayer,
another will dare to betray us.

580
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:13,034
I know Sabapathy was a cheat, dad.

581
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,208
Kill him!

582
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:18,539
Kill Sabapathy.

583
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:24,210
What are you saying?

584
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:28,057
How can we kill Saba who worked
20 years loyally for us?

585
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:30,656
Do you want to spare him?

586
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:34,456
Will you enter Kulkarni's area?
Can you come back alive from there?

587
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:36,531
Can you come back alive
from Black square area?

588
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:39,193
Tell me who many are going there,
I'll keep graves ready for them.

589
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:41,360
Are you scaring us?

590
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:49,071
I've told you dad, if you keep such jokers,
you and your business are done.

591
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:59,081
Jai, you know very well from which
level we've reached this position.

592
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:01,756
In a dilapidated room,

593
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:05,326
after a night's sleep on waking
up next morning,

594
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:10,558
we spent our lives amongst
bandicoots which ate us alive,

595
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:15,936
I don't like to go back to
those days because of him,

596
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:20,936
kill him!

597
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:22,910
No dada!

598
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:24,273
Will you go or not?

599
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:26,780
Will you go or not?

600
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,778
I'll go but I'll not kill him.

601
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:37,653
I'll bring Saba, ask him
why did he do like this?

602
00:58:37,828 --> 00:58:39,659
If he had done any mistake, kill him.

603
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,527
I'll not stop you.

604
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:51,297
Got a phone call that
my grandma is not well,

605
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,304
so I'm going to Palasa.

606
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:54,535
Why didn't you put on the seat belt?

607
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,035
Seat belt?

608
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:00,269
Leave me, you know who my father is?

609
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:03,207
You know who Kulkarni is.
- I know. Your father is my friend.

610
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:11,482
Who is he?
- Sampath's son.

611
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:13,722
I'm going there to bring Saba.

612
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:15,823
I got it.

613
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:19,820
Keeping him as hostage you'll
enter his area to bring Saba.

614
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:22,026
He's insurance for your life.

615
01:00:22,532 --> 01:00:23,464
That's it, right?

616
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:27,365
Today is his birthday, celebrate it.

617
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:30,806
How old are you?
- Why?

618
01:00:58,201 --> 01:01:00,101
Tell me.
- Jai is coming sir.

619
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,904
Let him come.

620
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:56,485
Come... come Jai.

621
01:01:57,027 --> 01:02:00,258
Only you've the guts to enter my area.

622
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,228
How is Bhagawan?

623
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:06,261
Is he scared or angry?

624
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:11,502
I'm not coming from Bhagawan
but from a small birthday party.

625
01:02:13,176 --> 01:02:15,110
Where is Rahul?

626
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:19,271
Today is his birthday,
he's partying with his friends.

627
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:20,177
Why?

628
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:23,845
What have you done with him?

629
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:26,347
Stop Sampath!

630
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:37,159
Where is Rahul?

631
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:38,663
Where is Sabapathy?

632
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:40,496
Tell me where is Rahul?

633
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:45,202
What have you done with Rahul?
- Rahul is safe.

634
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:47,709
I'll make a call, talk to him.

635
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,979
I don't believe it.
I know how smart you are!

636
01:02:55,218 --> 01:02:58,244
Tell me where he is, I'll send my man.

637
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:02,050
Once Rahul leaves that place,
you can go with Saba.

638
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,889
Will you play strip Poker?
- What's that game?

639
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,766
If you win the game, I'll undress.

640
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:14,563
If I win, you must get undressed.

641
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:17,035
If I win all the games,
I'll undress to skin.

642
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:23,872
Where is Jahnavi?
- She hasn't yet come here.

643
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:28,242
Who is he?
- Munna, Jai has gone for Saba.

644
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:31,078
Who is he?

645
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:35,122
Sampath's son.
Jai left him here.

646
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,849
Sampath's son?

647
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:43,564
Today is his birthday.

648
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:52,000
Why did you do like this, Sabapathy?
What had really happened?

649
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,436
What am I to tell you?

650
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,703
Do you want me to tell Munna
urinated on me.

651
01:03:55,845 --> 01:03:59,440
He threatened to kill me
if I tell anyone about this.

652
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:03,611
Couldn't you've told me?

653
01:04:03,853 --> 01:04:05,718
Munna doesn't care about his father,

654
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:08,790
I don't want to get lynched
between father and son.

655
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,695
Did you think about the problems
that may crop because of this?

656
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:17,321
You don't know Jai,
till now people who respected me,

657
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:20,300
if they know about this,
they'll feel pity on me,

658
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,030
I'm not here seeking revenge,

659
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:27,300
to safeguard my respect
and my life.

660
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:32,137
Listen to me carefully.

661
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:34,740
I'm here to take you with me.

662
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:39,885
When you have done nothing wrong,
you don't need to fear anyone.

663
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:47,995
Where is Jahnavi?
Jahnavi? Who is she?

664
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:49,792
Is she sexier than her?

665
01:04:55,572 --> 01:05:00,339
Why would Jahnavi be here?
If she has time she'll be with Jai...

666
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:05,173
Will Jahnavi be with Jai?

667
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:09,341
She's having an affair with him.
You're nothing to her.

668
01:05:15,592 --> 01:05:17,025
What did you say now, Guru?

669
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:21,491
Not that, something before that.

670
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:23,664
What did you say about Jahnavi?

671
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:27,662
Tell me.

672
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:33,107
Tell me. Tell me what did you say
about Jai and Jahnavi?

673
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:36,540
It's an open secret,
Jai and Jahnavi are very close...

674
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:42,716
Tell me now.

675
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:55,690
Where is Jahnavi?

676
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:59,032
Will you tell me or shall I kill you?

677
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:12,405
Guru! Where is Jahnavi?
- In Jai's flat!

678
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:22,324
By now he should've reached the place.

679
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:23,891
Not answering the call.
Still not lifting the phone.

680
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,584
I suspect something.

681
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,871
I think it's Kulkarni's phone.

682
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:43,443
He's answering the call.

683
01:06:51,287 --> 01:06:53,778
If anything happens to my son,
I'll not leave you.

684
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:17,642
Catch him!

685
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:21,143
Don't leave him.

686
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:22,642
Catch him.

687
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:24,292
What happened?

688
01:10:24,467 --> 01:10:26,901
Munna entered the club suddenly,

689
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:30,664
we couldn't control the situation,
he killed both Rahul and Azad.

690
01:10:32,074 --> 01:10:33,405
Shouldn't you've told me that?

691
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:36,476
We don't know about the
situation there, right?

692
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:38,336
Okay, where's Munna now?

693
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,656
Why did you come here?

694
01:10:56,065 --> 01:10:57,498
Why don't you answer my phone calls?

695
01:10:58,334 --> 01:10:59,801
Why should I?

696
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,698
What makes you so proud!

697
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,168
Is it because you're sexy?

698
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:08,338
Is it because I'm after you?

699
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:12,380
Why are you in Jai's flat?
What are you doing here?

700
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:17,176
You sang that song for him, right?

701
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:22,149
Is it giving you great pleasure?

702
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:24,550
Did you do it here?

703
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:25,921
Here?

704
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:29,189
If not there?
- Get out from here.

705
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:34,892
Will you make love wherever
you find some place?

706
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:38,432
Get out!
You don't know about Jai.

707
01:11:38,641 --> 01:11:40,472
Do you know him well?

708
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:44,071
I don't mind if you sleep with him.

709
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:08,236
I don't like Jahnavi.

710
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:17,207
I don't like you.

711
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:22,776
Do you feel the pain?
Is it giving you pleasure?

712
01:13:05,494 --> 01:13:07,485
Come on man! I'll kill you.

713
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:14,499
What have you done with Jahnavi?

714
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:16,467
How dare she refuses me for you!

715
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:48,726
The offer you made to Jai, is it just
for him or we too can avail it?

716
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:58,101
What's this Jai?
Do you know what have you done?

717
01:15:02,444 --> 01:15:06,938
You killed Munna.
Bhagawan will not leave you.

718
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:10,649
See what has he done,
he bashed Jahnavi to death.

719
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:15,689
No use Jai, Bhagawan will not leave
if he knows you killed Munna.

720
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:16,756
He'll kill you.

721
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:19,724
Will Bhagawan leave me?
I'll go to him myself.

722
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:20,827
He'll kill you.

723
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:23,396
If I run scared, what I've done
will become a mistake.

724
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:25,864
Bhagawan must know
what has happened here.

725
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:28,595
I'm going to meet Bhagawan.
You stay here.

726
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:50,317
Remove your car.

727
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:52,050
It seems you killed Munna.

728
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:53,718
Don't say anything without
knowing the matter, Narsing.

729
01:15:53,896 --> 01:15:55,625
I want to talk to Bhagawan,
remove your car.

730
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:00,131
Bhagawan has ordered
to kill the murderer of Munna.

731
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:19,911
You can't escape Jai,
wherever you may go, you're dead.

732
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:34,152
Like he was my shadow,
I said he'll be your shadow too.

733
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:35,989
I trusted he will be.

734
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,993
But I didn't expect he would kill you.

735
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:53,502
Why are you leaving this place?
Why are Bhagawan's men after you?

736
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:54,666
Kill them.

737
01:18:55,377 --> 01:18:58,437
Leave it.
- Why should I?

738
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:01,674
They've killed Jahnavi,
now they're after your life,

739
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:07,288
before they kill you,
you kill them. Go, kill them Jai.

740
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:09,686
If I go there only one of
we two would be alive,

741
01:19:11,827 --> 01:19:14,193
I'll be there, Bhagawan will die.

742
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,328
I can never do that, Chotu.

743
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:23,264
You don't know Chotu,
there's a war going on in my heart.

744
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:24,997
I'm fighting myself.

745
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,778
I can't stand before Bhagawan.

746
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:34,714
He may have forgotten the help he
gave for my sister and mother.

747
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:36,884
But I've not forgotten it.

748
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:39,546
I must give my life for his help.

749
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:41,881
I mustn't take his life.

750
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:50,531
He knows the value of life.

751
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,235
I know how to seek revenge.

752
01:19:55,404 --> 01:19:56,871
I'll not leave him.

753
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:04,040
I'm not leaving fearing death,
I don't want to kill him, so I'm going.

754
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,572
I owe an explanation to
three people only.

755
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:14,584
One is Jahnavi, next is you,
and Sandhya.

756
01:20:17,392 --> 01:20:18,416
Go.

757
01:20:20,996 --> 01:20:22,224
Where?

758
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:25,557
Go far away from here.

759
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:31,665
Keep this with you.
- No, Jai.

760
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:34,064
Don't send me away.

761
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:37,068
It's not right for you to stay here.

762
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:38,377
Go.

763
01:20:39,581 --> 01:20:43,108
I don't have anyone in this world.

764
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:49,123
I'll live and die for you only, Jai.

765
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:51,286
Don't send me away from you.

766
01:20:58,467 --> 01:21:02,597
You always repeat my words, right?
Say I'm leaving.

767
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:09,108
As you wish. I'll go.

768
01:21:09,311 --> 01:21:09,970
Go.

769
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:18,011
I didn't expect you'll come to me.

770
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:19,646
Why wouldn't I come?

771
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:23,842
You made a blind offer to Jai,
but he refused,

772
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:27,147
I'm not Jai to refuse
such tantalizing offer.

773
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:30,052
I'm Guru.
Shall we sit and discuss?

774
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:40,398
The matter is I've the opportunity,

775
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:42,398
you've a necessity,

776
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:44,869
if we both join,
it's profit all the way.

777
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,739
Your profit depends on the
information you give.

778
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:53,070
I'm sure it'll be more
than your expectation. - Okay.

779
01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:56,414
The soft place where if you hit
Bhagawan's business will fall,

780
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:58,746
and whom you've to hit to
get the business to you,

781
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,219
I know very well when
and whom to strike,

782
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:04,450
but it needs a lot of ground work,

783
01:23:04,626 --> 01:23:06,184
you've to be little patient.

784
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,289
What happened?
- Got the car.

785
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,153
His whereabouts are unknown.

786
01:23:38,327 --> 01:23:42,263
I've our men in every place
he may go to.

787
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:43,762
Where would he go?

788
01:23:56,044 --> 01:23:58,308
Shall I serve sambar?
- No.

789
01:23:58,814 --> 01:24:01,647
Aren't we all here to look
after grandma?

790
01:24:04,019 --> 01:24:05,452
Why did you come here unannounced?

791
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:09,181
It was shown on MAA TV cooking program.
- I said no!

792
01:24:09,558 --> 01:24:12,425
Thick skinned lady!
Can't you hear I'm talking to her?

793
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:14,994
Always talking about TV programs.
- I'll not serve you.

794
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:17,627
Why are you scolding Lakshmi sister
for my sake?

795
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:20,131
Say sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

796
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:22,970
I felt like meeting you all.

797
01:24:23,138 --> 01:24:25,663
No, I called her.
What do you say?

798
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:28,139
Will you keep shut?
Shut up.

799
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:32,511
Dear, situation isn't good here.

800
01:24:33,014 --> 01:24:37,576
We fear when Sambasiva will be out
on bail or break out from jail.

801
01:24:37,753 --> 01:24:40,779
What you say is right, Ashok.

802
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:45,359
Anyway she's here,
she'll stay for a couple of days.

803
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:48,224
Will you keep her away
all life in fear?

804
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,854
How come you're connected
to this? Don't interfere.

805
01:24:51,032 --> 01:24:52,556
It was my mistake for allowing
you to stay here.

806
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:55,568
Who are you to allow me to stay here?
This is my grandma's house.

807
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:58,867
I'm here to help out of sympathy.
Isn't it, grandma?

808
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:01,001
Tell me the truth.

809
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:06,843
He's my aunt's son,
I left home to date him.

810
01:25:07,015 --> 01:25:09,540
I'm scared he may settle down
with some fair skinned lady.

811
01:25:09,718 --> 01:25:11,208
What bothers you if
I go with some woman?

812
01:25:11,386 --> 01:25:14,048
I'm in love with you from 8th class.

813
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:16,156
I won't accept if you go after
any other woman.

814
01:25:16,324 --> 01:25:19,725
Grandma, if you don't control her,
I'll kill her.

815
01:25:20,262 --> 01:25:23,425
Tell him to marry and then kill me,
I'm waiting for 2 years now.

816
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:27,092
Some more years and
I'll feel shy even to tell my age.

817
01:25:35,777 --> 01:25:38,041
I don't want anything,
my stomach is full.

818
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:40,408
Can't you come down
and tell me that?

819
01:25:40,816 --> 01:25:42,044
I'm coming.

820
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:46,851
Why did you call me now?

821
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:48,248
What?

822
01:26:01,903 --> 01:26:03,894
Sandhya, someone is here for you.

823
01:26:08,376 --> 01:26:11,937
Grandma, he's Jai, she's my grandma.

824
01:26:12,347 --> 01:26:13,279
Greetings madam.

825
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:19,615
Brother Ashok. Lakshmi sister.
- Greetings. - Sister-in-law!

826
01:26:22,858 --> 01:26:26,954
I worked in his nursery in Kolkata.
- What did you do?

827
01:26:28,463 --> 01:26:30,761
He helped m a lot there.
- How much?

828
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,634
Why didn't you tell me about him?

829
01:26:35,804 --> 01:26:36,862
Come in Jai.

830
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:40,236
No problem, I'll stay out.
- Stay out? - Yes.

831
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:43,969
Then do one thing, after going out,
turn left, and go straight,

832
01:26:44,145 --> 01:26:44,941
and then if you turn right,

833
01:26:45,113 --> 01:26:47,411
you'll see a Nookalamma temple
on your right side,

834
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:51,643
there's a big 5 star hotel next to it,
you can stay there!

835
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:56,157
Then what grandma? He's our guest
and wants to stay out.

836
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:02,995
It's not respect to allow a guest to
stay out with such a palatial home.

837
01:27:03,164 --> 01:27:04,961
You can stay here happily.

838
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:08,665
Grandma.
- Show him the room.

839
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:11,332
Why another room?
He'll stay with me in my room.

840
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:14,668
When will you tell me that?
- Shut up, I'll kill you.

841
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,134
You come.

842
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:26,348
Come in.

843
01:27:28,023 --> 01:27:29,354
This is my bedroom.

844
01:27:30,759 --> 01:27:31,521
Please sit down.

845
01:27:32,594 --> 01:27:34,858
Sit.
No problem, sit down.

846
01:27:36,898 --> 01:27:38,923
Just now I called you and
it was switched off.

847
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:42,729
Is it? Please sit down.
Drinking water.

848
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:43,769
Glass would be enough.

849
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:49,206
If you feel thirst at night, it may be
difficult to get glasses. That's why.

850
01:27:49,945 --> 01:27:51,708
Sit down, you carry on.

851
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,077
I had kept it somewhere here only...
- What are you searching?

852
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:56,717
That's what I'm searching, right?

853
01:27:56,885 --> 01:27:58,910
Is it here?
- No, not there.

854
01:27:59,087 --> 01:28:02,887
You carry on talking.
I'm not listening. You talk.

855
01:28:04,259 --> 01:28:05,886
Sister-in-law!

856
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:08,092
If you stay here, I'll call you as sister.

857
01:28:08,263 --> 01:28:13,166
Don't do it, all my efforts
would go waste. Talk freely.

858
01:28:14,102 --> 01:28:15,467
Come quickly.

859
01:28:19,374 --> 01:28:21,205
What brings you here suddenly?

860
01:28:22,243 --> 01:28:24,734
I didn't respond to your phone call, right?

861
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:28,842
I came here to tell that
I've lost my phone.

862
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:32,747
If you had lost the phone
how did you know I made a call?

863
01:28:33,088 --> 01:28:34,578
Got caught again.

864
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:40,661
Nice phone, lost it at the right time.

865
01:30:21,563 --> 01:30:29,026
If you run so fast, you'll reach
Kolkata faster than the bus.

866
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:32,603
Why did you run now?

867
01:30:34,242 --> 01:30:35,869
Memories chased me.

868
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:38,373
I didn't get you.

869
01:30:40,348 --> 01:30:44,546
I was seven then, when my mother
and sister called me,

870
01:30:45,186 --> 01:30:47,051
on green grasslands like this,

871
01:30:48,056 --> 01:30:50,047
I used to run and fly kites,

872
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,722
I remembered that.
- Is it?

873
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:56,693
If you see our weekly market,
you'll recollect more memories.

874
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,030
Shall we go?

875
01:31:03,037 --> 01:31:07,531
How is Chotu?
- He's fine.

876
01:31:09,477 --> 01:31:10,910
What would happen in a day?

877
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:14,078
Anything can happen.

878
01:31:14,249 --> 01:31:17,082
Lives change in minutes.
You know that?

879
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:35,627
What man? Are you trying to kill
SI Papa Rao with a tractor?

880
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:37,566
If I had that intention,
I would've done it.

881
01:31:38,339 --> 01:31:40,569
I wouldn't have applied the brakes.

882
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:44,744
I know.

883
01:31:44,946 --> 01:31:48,677
I know you think Ashok is a great man!

884
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:51,080
But you don't know about me.

885
01:31:51,252 --> 01:31:55,882
If I open the bottle and
drink the last peg,

886
01:31:56,057 --> 01:31:58,787
it'll be destruction 2012!

887
01:32:00,228 --> 01:32:01,456
You can't bear it.

888
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:04,095
Let's go to the market,
it's time for collection.

889
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:10,297
Oh you? Are you fine?
- Fine.

890
01:32:10,471 --> 01:32:13,963
Who is he sitting next to you?
Is he troubling you?

891
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:20,313
If he's troubling you, I'll lock
him up and break his bones.

892
01:32:21,316 --> 01:32:23,079
I haven't yet got in.

893
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:26,652
Stop... stop...
- Uncle... uncle... come fast please.

894
01:32:26,821 --> 01:32:29,915
Please help me.
- Please stop the vehicle.

895
01:32:30,091 --> 01:32:33,492
I beg you, please give me your hand.
- Come.

896
01:32:34,495 --> 01:32:35,985
Hop on...

897
01:32:43,004 --> 01:32:45,268
Will you move little please?

898
01:32:46,407 --> 01:32:47,806
Little more please.

899
01:32:55,783 --> 01:33:01,688
You're so thin, but where did you
get so much strength?

900
01:33:01,956 --> 01:33:04,288
He goes forjog.
- Jog?

901
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:08,691
Jogging wont power hands,
leg power will increase.

902
01:33:17,405 --> 01:33:19,669
Did Ashok tell you not to speak?

903
01:33:20,475 --> 01:33:22,534
Basically I'm a good man.

904
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:28,878
Most of them misunderstand me.

905
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,548
I wanted to make the village greynary.

906
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:36,053
It's greenery not greynary.

907
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:38,887
Greenery!

908
01:33:39,193 --> 01:33:40,490
Greynary, it's not greynary!

909
01:33:40,662 --> 01:33:43,529
Greenery!
- Greynary!

910
01:33:43,865 --> 01:33:46,527
Fool! You can't pronounce it.
- Why are you getting irritated?

911
01:33:46,701 --> 01:33:49,864
I just repeated what you said.

912
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:57,576
You're finding mistakes, what do you do?

913
01:34:06,554 --> 01:34:08,078
I've been searching for you only.

914
01:34:08,656 --> 01:34:11,557
Cell phone is switched off,
door is locked,

915
01:34:11,726 --> 01:34:14,923
man has escaped,
I was searching where would he be?

916
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,897
What's that look?

917
01:34:26,074 --> 01:34:28,736
It seems you've killed someone.

918
01:34:30,111 --> 01:34:32,511
It seems they're searching for you.

919
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:37,447
If I file such an FIR and lock you up,
you're finished.

920
01:34:37,919 --> 01:34:39,546
So, listen to me,

921
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:42,952
come to station and
repair the transformer.

922
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:47,956
Sir, if you don't mind, a small matter.
- Tell me.

923
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:51,426
Why sorry?

924
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:52,765
For this.

925
01:34:57,138 --> 01:34:59,936
Where is he?
- Uncle is always like this.

926
01:35:10,985 --> 01:35:15,479
This is our market, this is our
Shoppers Stop, City Centre, and everything.

927
01:35:42,717 --> 01:35:44,446
Look at this, mud bangles.

928
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:47,187
Don't get it often.

929
01:35:48,022 --> 01:35:49,182
Aren't they fine?

930
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:52,019
Will you help me wear it?

931
01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:24,721
Come.

932
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:27,994
I don't like all this.
- No problem.

933
01:36:28,162 --> 01:36:29,060
Stand here.

934
01:36:50,651 --> 01:36:51,618
What's this Sandhya?

935
01:36:51,786 --> 01:36:55,586
Why are you standing just like that?
Give a pose like him.

936
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:57,684
Like him...

937
01:36:59,927 --> 01:37:02,020
Not like that.

938
01:37:03,664 --> 01:37:04,562
Like him!

939
01:37:04,799 --> 01:37:05,993
Stylishly!

940
01:37:24,952 --> 01:37:26,783
What happened? You said fun, right?

941
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:37,093
Break it Shiva...

942
01:37:39,233 --> 01:37:40,029
Come.

943
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:42,760
Jump!

944
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:46,303
Is it Krishnashtami today?
- No, this is our village's casino.

945
01:37:46,841 --> 01:37:49,810
One who breaks will get
the money in it.

946
01:37:52,613 --> 01:37:56,982
Will you make a try?
- No please.

947
01:37:57,151 --> 01:38:00,143
You won't get such games
in your place, try it. - No please.

948
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:03,786
What's this Jai?
Ashok brother is asking you to try.

949
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:06,791
Why don't you try it for fun?
- I can't break it.

950
01:38:06,994 --> 01:38:08,586
Do it for my sake.

951
01:38:08,763 --> 01:38:09,320
Come Jai.

952
01:38:09,697 --> 01:38:11,858
Give it.
- Okay brother.

953
01:38:12,033 --> 01:38:14,092
Take it, make a try.

954
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:16,502
Let me if you can break it,
blindfold him.

955
01:38:16,737 --> 01:38:18,967
Tie it perfectly.
- I'll tie it tightly.

956
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,679
Do you think he'll break it?

957
01:38:27,848 --> 01:38:29,679
Break it Jai!

958
01:38:43,764 --> 01:38:45,823
Don't just watch,
you must break it, Jai.

959
01:39:28,209 --> 01:39:31,667
What are you looking at?
- I've a doubt. Can I ask?

960
01:39:31,846 --> 01:39:32,471
Ask.

961
01:39:32,647 --> 01:39:37,516
You appear innocent like a child but
you've many arts hidden inside you.

962
01:39:38,352 --> 01:39:40,252
That's okay, ask me
what's your doubt?

963
01:39:40,821 --> 01:39:42,721
I didn't expect you'll break it one shot.

964
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:45,484
Anybody can do it,
it's just timing. Even you can do it.

965
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:49,426
Nothing like that,
you've learnt Karate, right? - Little.

966
01:39:50,364 --> 01:39:51,661
I guessed it.

967
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:55,096
Breaking bricks and
running cars over palms,

968
01:39:55,303 --> 01:39:59,034
and breaking stone slabs on body,
will you do all this?

969
01:39:59,206 --> 01:40:00,605
Long time ago.

970
01:40:05,946 --> 01:40:06,708
How are you?

971
01:40:06,881 --> 01:40:09,679
I'm fine, how are you doing?
- I'm fine.

972
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:12,114
Is Jai fine?
- He's fine.

973
01:40:13,087 --> 01:40:16,113
Jai wanted to tell you something,
did he tell you?

974
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:17,956
Is it?

975
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:20,054
Why didn't you come here?

976
01:40:20,227 --> 01:40:21,455
I've returned to my place.

977
01:40:21,629 --> 01:40:24,063
Are you not in Kolkata now?
- No.

978
01:40:24,231 --> 01:40:27,098
Why? Why did you leave the nursery?

979
01:40:27,268 --> 01:40:28,428
I...

980
01:40:28,569 --> 01:40:30,560
What happened suddenly?

981
01:40:31,772 --> 01:40:33,797
I'll talk to him.
- Just a minute Chotu.

982
01:40:37,078 --> 01:40:40,536
Are you fine, Jai?
- Fine, how about you?

983
01:40:40,715 --> 01:40:42,580
Didn't you tell anything with Sandhya?

984
01:40:42,783 --> 01:40:45,149
Not yet.
- Please don't tell.

985
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:47,813
20 years dream is standing before you.

986
01:40:48,322 --> 01:40:51,223
Don't destroy it with one truth, leave it.

987
01:40:51,392 --> 01:40:53,986
Forget the past.
Start life afresh.

988
01:40:55,296 --> 01:40:57,457
Please don't tell anything with Sandhya.

989
01:40:58,265 --> 01:40:58,959
Bye Jai.

990
01:43:36,857 --> 01:43:40,987
I'm offering these lamps since
8th class wishing to marry Ashok.

991
01:44:10,124 --> 01:44:14,527
Never imagined this...
It isn't a dream...

992
01:44:14,695 --> 01:44:19,132
You've come like good times...

993
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:23,737
Just think and appears
before to excite you...

994
01:44:23,904 --> 01:44:27,362
I'm here like a shore coming up...

995
01:44:27,575 --> 01:44:31,978
If two of us merge into one,
it's love...

996
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:37,550
If our eyes see one thing and
breathe as one, then it's we...

997
01:44:58,839 --> 01:45:02,002
Tell me... tell me...

998
01:45:03,477 --> 01:45:06,173
Who appointed you?
- Chotu sir.

999
01:45:06,347 --> 01:45:08,247
I don't know anything sir.

1000
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:10,747
Find out who else used to visit here.

1001
01:45:28,702 --> 01:45:32,229
There's lot about him
which I don't know.

1002
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:40,000
Brother Ashok!

1003
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:42,842
You're dead today.

1004
01:46:55,622 --> 01:46:56,850
Beat him.

1005
01:46:57,591 --> 01:46:59,855
Break open the door and get her out.

1006
01:47:00,728 --> 01:47:03,196
I'll kill you first and then go after her.

1007
01:48:05,926 --> 01:48:08,360
I told you not to come here
from Kolkata.

1008
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:10,827
Have you understood why?

1009
01:48:10,998 --> 01:48:13,228
Please calm down.
- You shut up.

1010
01:48:25,045 --> 01:48:26,273
Who are you?

1011
01:48:29,116 --> 01:48:30,777
How could you beat a man like that?

1012
01:48:32,286 --> 01:48:34,049
You would also beat like that
had you been in my place?

1013
01:48:36,557 --> 01:48:38,787
When someone comes to help,
don't ask for reasons.

1014
01:48:49,603 --> 01:48:52,902
If we've to avoid such attacks again,
we must kill Sambasiva tonight.

1015
01:48:53,073 --> 01:48:56,474
I'm sure SI Paparayudu would
know about Sambasiva.

1016
01:48:56,610 --> 01:48:58,908
If we get him drunk, he'll tell the
whereabouts of Sambasiva.

1017
01:48:59,079 --> 01:48:59,670
Let's ask him sir.

1018
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,041
No need to ask that drunkard,
I'll kill him myself.

1019
01:49:02,216 --> 01:49:05,151
Uncle, take care of the home.
- Okay.

1020
01:49:35,482 --> 01:49:40,681
He used to torture farmers here to
cut trees and smuggle it from forest.

1021
01:49:41,121 --> 01:49:42,019
I couldn't tolerate it.

1022
01:49:44,758 --> 01:49:48,023
I gave them courage and
petitioned against him.

1023
01:49:53,634 --> 01:49:59,038
I met every one of them.

1024
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:13,041
Finally arrest warrant was
issued against him.

1025
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:32,368
He left threatening to kill me.

1026
01:50:33,507 --> 01:50:36,271
My brother Ashok forced
to go to Kolkata.

1027
01:50:36,743 --> 01:50:38,233
You know everything that happened after.

1028
01:50:40,781 --> 01:50:44,080
You're unnecessarily facing
problems because of me.

1029
01:50:44,451 --> 01:50:47,909
Leave this place tomorrow,
don't stay here.

1030
01:50:48,822 --> 01:50:51,916
His tension will be there till I'm alive.

1031
01:50:52,893 --> 01:50:54,087
You go away, Jai.

1032
01:50:57,264 --> 01:50:59,061
The reason I came here isn't that.

1033
01:50:59,866 --> 01:51:01,731
The reason to leave shouldn't be it.

1034
01:51:03,804 --> 01:51:05,101
You go to sleep.

1035
01:51:17,217 --> 01:51:19,549
Tonight you must have the last peg.

1036
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,950
There will be cyclone
if I drink the last peg.

1037
01:51:22,122 --> 01:51:24,317
My foot cyclone, let it come,
I don't care.

1038
01:51:26,126 --> 01:51:28,720
I think you're busy.
You carry on, I'll come later.

1039
01:51:28,895 --> 01:51:30,863
Wait, is it second show to continue?

1040
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:33,261
Wait.
- You wait here.

1041
01:51:34,234 --> 01:51:35,394
What's going on here?
What's the matter?

1042
01:51:35,569 --> 01:51:38,367
That is...
- My foot! What will he say?

1043
01:51:38,538 --> 01:51:41,132
I'll tell you.
- Tell me.

1044
01:51:41,708 --> 01:51:44,233
I didn't know what liquor is
till 6 months ago,

1045
01:51:44,411 --> 01:51:46,379
I never drank before,

1046
01:51:46,546 --> 01:51:51,813
but this fool made me drink last peg
and today I'm a drunkard.

1047
01:51:51,985 --> 01:51:58,652
If I ask why? He says cyclone
2012 will come if he drinks.

1048
01:51:58,825 --> 01:52:04,957
My wife... my wife ditched me.
He's the reason.

1049
01:52:08,101 --> 01:52:13,562
If you don't drink the last peg tonight,
I'll kill you and sit in the lock-up.

1050
01:52:13,774 --> 01:52:15,799
Please tell him.
- Me?

1051
01:52:20,614 --> 01:52:23,014
That's it! Drink it!

1052
01:52:24,217 --> 01:52:26,845
Now show your bloody cyclone!

1053
01:52:27,387 --> 01:52:28,376
Come here.

1054
01:52:28,688 --> 01:52:29,677
Is it okay?

1055
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:37,660
Where is he?

1056
01:52:37,831 --> 01:52:40,857
You had last peg and
slapped him, right?
He ran away.

1057
01:52:41,068 --> 01:52:43,536
Did I have last peg and slapped him?
- Then what?

1058
01:52:43,703 --> 01:52:44,863
Did he ran away?

1059
01:52:45,072 --> 01:52:47,540
This side or that side?
- Straight! - Straight!

1060
01:52:47,874 --> 01:52:49,364
Did he go away straight?

1061
01:52:49,709 --> 01:52:50,869
Do you say I slapped him?

1062
01:52:51,078 --> 01:52:53,376
Without any doubt. I'm the witness.

1063
01:52:54,448 --> 01:52:56,416
Thanks at least you believed me.

1064
01:52:56,583 --> 01:53:00,883
What's the use sir?
I couldn't make Ashok to believe this.

1065
01:53:02,589 --> 01:53:04,887
When I said let's ask Paparayudu
to catch Sambasiva...

1066
01:53:05,058 --> 01:53:05,888
What did he say?

1067
01:53:06,393 --> 01:53:08,588
I can't say it sir.
- Tell me, what did he say?

1068
01:53:08,762 --> 01:53:11,697
He used choicest epithets.
- Epithets? What did he use?

1069
01:53:12,566 --> 01:53:15,228
Hey you sinner!
- Sinner!

1070
01:53:17,137 --> 01:53:19,469
Hey you bloody drunkard!
He said this too, sir.

1071
01:53:19,606 --> 01:53:22,234
Bloody drunkard!

1072
01:53:22,642 --> 01:53:25,839
Not only that sir, he used bad words
for me for supporting you.

1073
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:28,277
Did he abuse you also?
What did he say?

1074
01:53:28,448 --> 01:53:32,248
He said hey you innocent!
- Innocent?

1075
01:53:32,652 --> 01:53:34,176
You can't even bite if finger
is placed in mouth.

1076
01:53:34,354 --> 01:53:35,753
He said this too sir.

1077
01:53:37,357 --> 01:53:41,589
Innocent. You can't even bite
if finger is placed in mouth.

1078
01:53:42,329 --> 01:53:44,092
The first two abuses were correct,

1079
01:53:44,264 --> 01:53:47,358
are you considering the second
two words also as abuses?

1080
01:53:47,534 --> 01:53:51,903
Forget about me, Ashok says he'll
catch Sambasiva before you can.

1081
01:53:53,907 --> 01:53:54,601
Is it?

1082
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:59,972
Samba lives in forest besides
the elephant's waterhole,

1083
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:02,774
amidst the foxes pen...

1084
01:54:10,157 --> 01:54:11,624
Why sorry?

1085
01:54:25,672 --> 01:54:28,163
Who is the new man in her home?
- He came recently.

1086
01:54:28,341 --> 01:54:30,866
We saw him in the market.
We thought he would've gone.

1087
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:32,945
Why didn't you tell me that before?

1088
01:54:42,155 --> 01:54:43,645
Who is it?

1089
01:54:44,558 --> 01:54:46,651
Check boys, go.

1090
01:54:53,867 --> 01:54:55,459
Go that side.

1091
01:54:58,338 --> 01:54:59,965
Go this side.

1092
01:55:01,141 --> 01:55:02,335
Who is it?

1093
01:55:02,876 --> 01:55:04,901
Who is it?

1094
01:55:21,394 --> 01:55:23,021
What's that?

1095
01:55:58,531 --> 01:56:01,694
Though he only drinks...
- Thought he's just a drunkard.

1096
01:56:02,636 --> 01:56:03,864
Greetings sir...

1097
01:56:09,843 --> 01:56:11,037
Greetings sir.

1098
01:56:11,678 --> 01:56:14,579
You're not an ordinary man.
- What happened?

1099
01:56:14,881 --> 01:56:16,906
Why people have gathered here?

1100
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:20,450
What's all this sir?
- What did I do?

1101
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:25,421
Sir, see he did everything and
innocently asking what has happened?

1102
01:56:26,059 --> 01:56:27,686
Did I do anything?

1103
01:56:27,861 --> 01:56:35,063
To keep this place in peace, you drank
the last peg and killed Sambasiva,

1104
01:56:35,235 --> 01:56:38,727
are you asking innocently
what has happened? - Me?

1105
01:56:39,072 --> 01:56:42,769
Sir, you're God!
- Am I God?

1106
01:56:43,009 --> 01:56:43,941
You're God.

1107
01:56:44,077 --> 01:56:46,443
I'll not leave your stomach.

1108
01:56:47,947 --> 01:56:53,943
Sir...
- Did I kill Sambasiva? - Yes sir.

1109
01:56:54,254 --> 01:56:57,280
Last night you said I'll not
sleep till I see his end,

1110
01:56:57,457 --> 01:56:59,948
till now I saved the last peg
for him only,

1111
01:57:00,126 --> 01:57:01,593
tonight I'll kill him,

1112
01:57:01,761 --> 01:57:05,356
and usher in the
cyclone 2012 tonight, you said this.

1113
01:57:05,498 --> 01:57:07,193
Did I?
- Yes sir.

1114
01:57:08,568 --> 01:57:10,763
Do you really say I killed him?

1115
01:57:11,271 --> 01:57:15,640
That's what people think and
if you don't it'll be very bad.

1116
01:57:15,842 --> 01:57:18,106
Now listen to me carefully, sir.

1117
01:57:19,112 --> 01:57:21,910
You didn't kill any ordinary man,

1118
01:57:22,982 --> 01:57:24,472
you killed Sambasiva!

1119
01:57:25,318 --> 01:57:27,115
A cold blooded murderer!

1120
01:57:27,287 --> 01:57:28,652
A beast!

1121
01:57:29,889 --> 01:57:33,484
You're a hero for killing such a devil.

1122
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,984
A great warrior!

1123
01:57:35,962 --> 01:57:39,193
If you don't accept or believe it,

1124
01:57:39,399 --> 01:57:42,300
Ashok will take all the credit,

1125
01:57:44,237 --> 01:57:48,003
now you're a real hero!

1126
01:57:48,174 --> 01:57:50,836
How could he kill Sambasiva?
Have you all gone mad?

1127
01:57:52,379 --> 01:57:53,846
Shut up.

1128
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,016
Good show!

1129
01:58:02,856 --> 01:58:05,347
I killed Sambasiva!

1130
01:58:05,625 --> 01:58:06,523
Me!

1131
01:58:10,096 --> 01:58:12,690
I don't care if people like you
believe it or not.

1132
01:58:12,866 --> 01:58:14,163
My foot!

1133
01:58:16,169 --> 01:58:16,828
Sir.

1134
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:19,535
Call the photographer.
- Come here.

1135
01:58:25,845 --> 01:58:29,645
Sir, please go near the body...
go near the body...

1136
01:58:29,816 --> 01:58:31,215
Near the body?

1137
01:58:31,651 --> 01:58:32,879
Lt'll be fine.

1138
01:58:35,889 --> 01:58:37,880
I'm going.
- Little further.

1139
01:58:44,364 --> 01:58:45,194
I'll not go.

1140
01:58:45,365 --> 01:58:47,697
Sir, little closer to the body.

1141
01:58:48,234 --> 01:58:49,360
Please sir.

1142
01:58:50,236 --> 01:58:52,033
I'll rap your head.

1143
01:58:55,108 --> 01:58:56,575
Little closer.

1144
01:58:58,178 --> 01:59:00,339
It'll be fine, little closer.

1145
01:59:01,514 --> 01:59:02,242
That's all.

1146
01:59:02,682 --> 01:59:03,910
Take a snap.

1147
01:59:07,454 --> 01:59:11,550
Born somewhere...
grew up somewhere else...

1148
01:59:11,724 --> 01:59:16,320
He came to our place...
he has become part of our family...

1149
01:59:16,496 --> 01:59:20,125
He's a moon without dark spots...
a shining sun of goodness...

1150
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:24,327
He plays with elephants, O Paparayudu...

1151
01:59:29,709 --> 01:59:34,806
If every place has a man like him,
there won't be any problems...

1152
01:59:34,981 --> 01:59:37,313
There won't be any darkness anymore...

1153
01:59:37,484 --> 01:59:38,951
You stop it.

1154
01:59:40,653 --> 01:59:42,280
What are you doing there?
- Coming sir.

1155
01:59:43,256 --> 01:59:45,281
Coming sir. I'm here sir.

1156
01:59:45,458 --> 01:59:49,588
Why is he singing about moon,
sun, brightness and darkness?

1157
01:59:49,762 --> 01:59:53,095
He's singing about you, sir.
- I must understand it, right?

1158
01:59:53,266 --> 01:59:55,757
I came here to grey...

1159
01:59:57,337 --> 01:59:58,304
You're right.

1160
01:59:58,505 --> 01:59:59,733
You do one thing.
- Sir.

1161
01:59:59,906 --> 02:00:04,138
Don't use big words like him,
use small words,

1162
02:00:04,277 --> 02:00:07,508
you sing in praise of me.
- Me sir?

1163
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,308
Yes, don't hesitate. Sing.
- No sir.

1164
02:00:10,984 --> 02:00:12,645
My shoulder broke sir.

1165
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,981
Sing.
- Okay sir.

1166
02:00:16,823 --> 02:00:17,983
Sing I say!

1167
02:00:18,157 --> 02:00:19,146
You beat the drums!

1168
02:00:20,326 --> 02:00:23,193
Wastrel of all wastrels...
You foolish ass...

1169
02:00:23,363 --> 02:00:26,127
Drunkard... loafer...

1170
02:00:26,299 --> 02:00:29,791
A goon in the police uniform...

1171
02:00:31,704 --> 02:00:33,672
What's this sir?
Why are you beating me?

1172
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:36,468
Why are you abusing me?
- In the flow... - Stop.

1173
02:00:36,809 --> 02:00:38,674
Though I didn't understand,
his abuses were much better.

1174
02:00:39,145 --> 02:00:40,612
Yours is totally worse.

1175
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:45,149
Do one thing,
don't go too high or too low,

1176
02:00:45,318 --> 02:00:47,013
use medium abuses.

1177
02:00:49,122 --> 02:00:50,350
Watch now sir!

1178
02:00:50,523 --> 02:00:51,512
Beat!

1179
02:00:54,127 --> 02:00:57,028
He's short and a world hero...

1180
02:00:57,196 --> 02:00:58,925
He appears ordinary...

1181
02:00:59,098 --> 02:01:03,000
This warrior has many tricks
under his sleeve...

1182
02:01:03,269 --> 02:01:07,638
He's a great warrior without a
moustache, he's like a superman...

1183
02:01:07,807 --> 02:01:11,743
He looks very simple...

1184
02:01:11,911 --> 02:01:17,645
He's Lord Anjaneya who doesn't
know his own strength...

1185
02:01:17,817 --> 02:01:23,153
He's Ghajini's cousin to forget
every good deed he does...

1186
02:01:23,323 --> 02:01:23,982
Next?

1187
02:01:24,157 --> 02:01:25,886
What next? Beat!

1188
02:01:43,643 --> 02:01:50,071
Don't judge people by the
clothes and looks...

1189
02:01:50,483 --> 02:01:56,752
At the right time one's stamina
comes to the fore...

1190
02:01:57,290 --> 02:02:00,589
Though he doesn't have
a six pack body...

1191
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:04,025
Paparayudu's single hand
can do wonders...

1192
02:02:04,197 --> 02:02:07,257
Though he may look like
a comedian in cut outs...

1193
02:02:07,433 --> 02:02:10,869
This short man's razor sharp
eyes can kill anyone...

1194
02:02:11,004 --> 02:02:13,063
Can knock-out anyone...

1195
02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:16,106
Next?
- What next? Beat!

1196
02:02:16,776 --> 02:02:18,403
Watch now brother!

1197
02:02:22,315 --> 02:02:23,441
How about this brother?

1198
02:02:24,283 --> 02:02:26,444
Change the movement.

1199
02:02:27,086 --> 02:02:30,214
That's fine!

1200
02:02:36,062 --> 02:02:37,461
Ladies too joined him.

1201
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:42,929
Till yesterday people here were
grinding axe on you...

1202
02:02:43,102 --> 02:02:46,094
Now they're ready to offer their
daughters in marriage...

1203
02:02:46,272 --> 02:02:52,006
Till yesterday you were nothing...
today you're a sir...

1204
02:02:52,178 --> 02:02:55,170
People who chided you
are bowing to you in honour...

1205
02:02:55,348 --> 02:03:00,980
You're God and judge to any problem
in the surrounding villages...

1206
02:03:01,154 --> 02:03:06,820
Even if they fall at your feet,
don't ever leave anyone...

1207
02:03:06,993 --> 02:03:12,989
If you're not with us as protector,
who would protect us?

1208
02:03:15,968 --> 02:03:18,630
Sir... sir...
I'm here sir.

1209
02:03:19,472 --> 02:03:22,635
This land is mine,
this village is mine...

1210
02:03:23,242 --> 02:03:25,301
People of this village are my people.

1211
02:03:25,445 --> 02:03:27,936
I'll not leave you.
- That's enough sir.

1212
02:03:28,114 --> 02:03:31,675
Like gum... like adhesive...
I'll stick on to this place.

1213
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:35,218
Sir, you're God!

1214
02:03:35,388 --> 02:03:36,685
Bless him sir.

1215
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,283
Sir...

1216
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:42,851
Its enough of this life.
- Go.

1217
02:03:43,296 --> 02:03:44,593
Enough of it sir.
- Go.

1218
02:03:44,764 --> 02:03:46,925
No sir. - Go I say!
- I'm going sir.

1219
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:48,158
Beat!

1220
02:03:52,171 --> 02:03:54,332
Little slow!

1221
02:03:57,243 --> 02:03:58,676
Still slower!

1222
02:04:02,248 --> 02:04:03,545
Slower than it.

1223
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:07,344
Further slow is nothing.
Nothing can be heard.

1224
02:04:12,759 --> 02:04:15,057
Beat!

1225
02:04:27,473 --> 02:04:31,910
Let's install a golden statue
when he's still alive...

1226
02:04:32,078 --> 02:04:36,037
Let's spread message of Paparayudu's
good deeds around...

1227
02:04:36,215 --> 02:04:40,777
Let's celebrate his birthday
like a festival of Deepavali or Holi...

1228
02:04:40,953 --> 02:04:44,616
And call it as Papavali...

1229
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:50,559
Let's collect donations and
build a marble temple for him...

1230
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:55,724
Let's make Paparayudu's epic tale
a lesson in school text book...

1231
02:04:58,638 --> 02:05:01,266
Next?
- What next? Beat!

1232
02:05:18,958 --> 02:05:24,294
Sir, got excited...
- What's this? Go... go away...

1233
02:05:24,497 --> 02:05:26,431
What did I tell and
what were you doing?

1234
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:38,604
If you don't tell the truth,
all of them would be burnt alive.

1235
02:05:39,278 --> 02:05:41,143
Where is Chotu? Tell me.

1236
02:05:42,415 --> 02:05:43,677
Where is Chotu?

1237
02:05:45,518 --> 02:05:49,648
I really don't know.
He left this place.

1238
02:05:53,793 --> 02:05:55,158
I'll tell you...

1239
02:05:56,629 --> 02:06:01,293
I don't know where he is
but he calls me sometimes.

1240
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:02,990
Call him on phone.

1241
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:06,629
Just a minute. Got a phone call.

1242
02:06:10,376 --> 02:06:13,675
Hello, my life!

1243
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:17,407
Where are you Chotu?
- Are you thinking of me?

1244
02:06:17,583 --> 02:06:20,677
Do you want to meet me?
- Yes, I want to meet you.

1245
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:25,188
I can't come.
You know... small problem.

1246
02:06:26,459 --> 02:06:29,622
If you insist I too feel like meeting you.

1247
02:06:29,795 --> 02:06:30,853
Do one thing.

1248
02:06:31,030 --> 02:06:33,362
There's Dreamland hotel
outside the city.

1249
02:06:33,532 --> 02:06:36,160
Let's meet there coming Thursday.

1250
02:06:36,335 --> 02:06:37,666
Will you bring it or shall I bring it?

1251
02:06:38,271 --> 02:06:43,766
I'll bring it.
Don't tell anyone. Bye.

1252
02:07:03,062 --> 02:07:05,530
One Beer to room number 108.

1253
02:07:12,872 --> 02:07:14,362
6She's very fast.

1254
02:07:27,386 --> 02:07:30,253
Tell me, where is Jai?

1255
02:07:32,124 --> 02:07:33,091
I don't know dada.

1256
02:07:33,292 --> 02:07:36,750
Do you really don't know
or refusing to tell me?

1257
02:07:38,364 --> 02:07:41,390
I refuse to tell though I know.

1258
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:58,444
If you tell me where's Jai,
it'll be easy to catch him,

1259
02:07:58,684 --> 02:08:01,118
if not it'll be little difficult.

1260
02:08:04,757 --> 02:08:06,588
I told you I'll not tell.

1261
02:08:07,626 --> 02:08:08,786
That's it?

1262
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:32,645
Tell me now!

1263
02:08:40,026 --> 02:08:42,824
If you had told me
death would've been easier.

1264
02:08:45,297 --> 02:08:47,128
You know what should be done, right?

1265
02:08:48,167 --> 02:08:49,964
We'll find and kill him.

1266
02:08:50,636 --> 02:08:56,165
I didn't tell you to kill him,
I want Jai alive.

1267
02:09:30,843 --> 02:09:33,710
A small gift for you.
- For me? - See!

1268
02:09:43,556 --> 02:09:46,389
I want to tell you something.

1269
02:09:46,559 --> 02:09:48,720
You don't have to tell me, I know it.

1270
02:09:48,894 --> 02:09:52,762
Sandhya, i want to tell...
- Isn't it that the place you love?

1271
02:09:52,932 --> 02:09:54,024
Your dreamland.

1272
02:09:54,366 --> 02:09:56,994
Actually from that place to
this end belongs to us.

1273
02:09:57,203 --> 02:10:00,036
But my father gave to the villagers.

1274
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:03,738
Sandhya, Paparayudu didn't kill Sambasiva.

1275
02:10:05,344 --> 02:10:06,572
What?

1276
02:10:09,181 --> 02:10:10,239
I killed him.

1277
02:10:13,285 --> 02:10:14,252
For you.

1278
02:10:22,661 --> 02:10:24,424
There's another Jai whom you don't know.

1279
02:10:26,065 --> 02:10:27,396
After my father's death,

1280
02:10:27,666 --> 02:10:30,658
me, my mother and my sister
came to Calcutta for livelihood.

1281
02:10:31,137 --> 02:10:34,265
When people were looking at
my mother and sister with desire,

1282
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:37,602
I was dying in fear
how to protect them.

1283
02:10:39,245 --> 02:10:41,042
I came with dreams of
looking after mother well,

1284
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,443
and marry off my sister
in a good family,

1285
02:10:45,117 --> 02:10:48,609
when people killed them
after molesting them,

1286
02:10:49,655 --> 02:10:53,284
my heart broke, Sandhya,

1287
02:10:57,496 --> 02:10:59,464
console to a man in grief,

1288
02:10:59,632 --> 02:11:01,600
courage to a man in fear,

1289
02:11:01,834 --> 02:11:04,598
help to a helpless man,
people don't get such comforts easily,

1290
02:11:05,204 --> 02:11:07,604
but I got everything
with just one touch,

1291
02:11:07,806 --> 02:11:08,864
Bhagawan!

1292
02:11:25,224 --> 02:11:26,156
Kill!

1293
02:11:37,036 --> 02:11:38,628
Putting value to help,

1294
02:11:39,071 --> 02:11:40,800
marking boundary to gratitude,

1295
02:11:41,207 --> 02:11:42,970
is like killing humans,

1296
02:11:44,076 --> 02:11:46,840
gratitude isn't just thinking of the help,

1297
02:11:47,546 --> 02:11:50,174
it's showing gratitude to
the man who helped us.

1298
02:12:18,244 --> 02:12:19,711
Why are you telling me everything, Jai?

1299
02:12:20,246 --> 02:12:21,713
Why are you telling now?

1300
02:12:22,481 --> 02:12:24,278
Are you asking me not to love you?

1301
02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:26,384
Are you saying you don't love me?

1302
02:12:27,052 --> 02:12:28,212
Why?

1303
02:12:28,487 --> 02:12:31,388
You gave me love which
I had lost years ago.

1304
02:12:31,890 --> 02:12:32,584
That's why.

1305
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:40,189
Though I didn't commit any mistake,
I can't cheat you by hiding truth.

1306
02:12:40,866 --> 02:12:42,026
That's why I'm telling you.

1307
02:12:43,602 --> 02:12:50,201
I like you, I love you from my heart.

1308
02:12:52,878 --> 02:12:55,403
Though the life I dream
is before my eyes,

1309
02:12:57,449 --> 02:12:59,508
to take into my arms...

1310
02:13:16,201 --> 02:13:17,600
Why are you stopping yourself, Jai?

1311
02:13:19,905 --> 02:13:20,894
Why?

1312
02:13:22,808 --> 02:13:25,777
Don't think I'll forget if you refuse me.

1313
02:13:26,478 --> 02:13:31,279
I loved you, I love you,
I'll keep loving you.

1314
02:13:32,217 --> 02:13:34,378
As far as my life is concerned,

1315
02:13:34,553 --> 02:13:39,286
whether it is dream or reality,
it's you Jai.

1316
02:13:53,639 --> 02:13:58,269
I loved you, I love you,
I'll keep loving you.

1317
02:13:58,944 --> 02:14:01,742
As far as my life is concerned,

1318
02:14:01,914 --> 02:14:06,908
whether it is dream or reality,
it's you Jai.

1319
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:26,661
Are you dead or alive?

1320
02:15:02,975 --> 02:15:04,875
You would also do the same
if you were in my place,

1321
02:15:05,144 --> 02:15:06,736
let's discuss about it later.

1322
02:16:23,021 --> 02:16:27,788
My Rahul died because of you, die!

1323
02:16:47,045 --> 02:16:48,979
Give me the phone. - What happened?
- Give me phone.

1324
02:16:57,923 --> 02:16:59,652
Where are you?
- Why?

1325
02:17:13,005 --> 02:17:14,700
What happened to Sandhya?
- Give me car keys.

1326
02:17:14,873 --> 02:17:16,135
What happened to Sandhya?

1327
02:17:16,775 --> 02:17:19,073
You would've understood
what's my background.

1328
02:17:19,244 --> 02:17:20,302
Give me car keys.

1329
02:17:23,615 --> 02:17:24,673
I'll also come with you.

1330
02:17:26,919 --> 02:17:31,515
This is my war, the last war
I'm waging for my sake.

1331
02:21:13,245 --> 02:21:13,904
Come!

1332
02:22:57,916 --> 02:22:59,008
Where is Sandhya?

1333
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:03,348
Where is Sandhya?

1334
02:23:05,724 --> 02:23:07,021
I don't know who Sandhya is!

1335
02:23:07,192 --> 02:23:09,456
If you don't know how could
Sampath trace me out.

1336
02:23:10,362 --> 02:23:13,991
Guru told us.

1337
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:16,328
Guruvaiah?

1338
02:23:20,238 --> 02:23:27,371
You didn't like my offer,
Guru accepted it.

1339
02:23:33,318 --> 02:23:34,876
Guru planned this.

1340
02:23:35,887 --> 02:23:44,386
Guru told us to kill you also.

1341
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,228
Call him on phone.

1342
02:23:54,172 --> 02:23:55,230
Call him on phone!

1343
02:24:05,083 --> 02:24:08,075
Did you kill Jai?

1344
02:25:01,806 --> 02:25:05,708
Stop... I didn't do this.

1345
02:25:12,484 --> 02:25:13,473
I'm Guruvaiah, Jai!

1346
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,818
Where is Sandhya?
- I don't know.

1347
02:25:21,326 --> 02:25:24,659
May be Bhagawan would've taken her.

1348
02:25:26,398 --> 02:25:29,458
Yes, Bhagawan did this.

1349
02:25:30,168 --> 02:25:32,966
To catch you, he killed everyone.

1350
02:25:34,272 --> 02:25:39,608
He killed poor Chotu
by asphyxiating him.

1351
02:25:41,413 --> 02:25:44,610
Kill Bhagawan...

1352
02:25:44,949 --> 02:25:46,177
Leave me, I'm Guru.

1353
02:25:46,718 --> 02:25:52,884
Leave me... leave me...
do I need it at this age?

1354
02:25:53,058 --> 02:25:54,992
I beg you, leave me, I'll go away.

1355
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:58,891
I'll never appear in public again,
take it as I'm dead.

1356
02:26:01,466 --> 02:26:03,627
Leave me Jai... I beg you.

1357
02:26:51,583 --> 02:26:52,572
Throw the gun, Jai.

1358
02:27:22,881 --> 02:27:25,611
Come Jai... come.

1359
02:27:27,785 --> 02:27:32,449
Though you knew I'm searching you,
you didn't come to me.

1360
02:27:32,824 --> 02:27:35,292
You've come searching for a girl.

1361
02:27:35,660 --> 02:27:38,128
Why? Why Jai?

1362
02:27:38,897 --> 02:27:42,264
How could you go away killing
Munna and leaving me?

1363
02:27:42,433 --> 02:27:45,596
First know why I had to kill Munna.

1364
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:49,762
He was torturing and killing
Jahnavi before my eyes,

1365
02:27:51,176 --> 02:27:53,838
I did what any man with
humanity would do.

1366
02:27:53,978 --> 02:27:57,311
Munna is my son.

1367
02:27:58,750 --> 02:28:00,980
I trusted you'd be like his shadow.

1368
02:28:02,487 --> 02:28:09,825
I promised to be shadow of
humans not to sadists.

1369
02:28:13,198 --> 02:28:16,656
I lost my son, my honour.
I lost my power.

1370
02:28:16,834 --> 02:28:20,793
Jai, power is greater than one's life.

1371
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:25,140
I thought you'd be mourning
the death of a son.

1372
02:28:26,377 --> 02:28:28,504
But you're sad about losing power.

1373
02:28:30,181 --> 02:28:32,172
The problem is between you and me,

1374
02:28:32,684 --> 02:28:33,844
leave Sandhya,

1375
02:28:34,552 --> 02:28:37,350
till now I've never killed anyone
without valid reason,

1376
02:28:37,755 --> 02:28:40,019
if I get a reason,
I'll not spare anyone.

1377
02:28:40,358 --> 02:28:44,351
You wanted revenge on me,
you'd no reason to kill Chotu,

1378
02:28:44,996 --> 02:28:46,657
now you've kidnapped Sandhya,

1379
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:51,828
if there's anyone left in my life
as my own, its Sandhya.

1380
02:28:53,438 --> 02:28:54,996
Please leave Sandhya.

1381
02:28:57,108 --> 02:28:59,872
Sandhya, come.

1382
02:29:19,664 --> 02:29:23,691
Raising it on me...
on Bhagawan himself!

1383
02:29:24,168 --> 02:29:27,001
For the sake of a girl,
raising it on me,

1384
02:29:27,171 --> 02:29:29,036
what's there in her?

1385
02:29:30,908 --> 02:29:31,738
Life!

1386
02:29:32,043 --> 02:29:34,910
I gave you this life.

1387
02:29:35,813 --> 02:29:42,616
After losing your mother and sister,
you were left orphaned on streets,

1388
02:29:42,787 --> 02:29:44,414
I gave you the life.

1389
02:29:44,822 --> 02:29:48,758
There's no Jai without Bhagawan.

1390
02:29:50,528 --> 02:29:52,758
What did you give me in return?

1391
02:29:52,997 --> 02:29:54,897
20 years of my life.

1392
02:29:55,833 --> 02:29:59,428
For your help I gave you
20 years of my life.

1393
02:30:00,805 --> 02:30:03,774
Dada, you gave a gun to take lives,

1394
02:30:04,208 --> 02:30:06,438
but I believed its to protect lives,

1395
02:30:07,712 --> 02:30:11,204
till now I never talked to you but today
arguing with you, understand it,

1396
02:30:13,217 --> 02:30:15,447
but still I'm not here to kill you,

1397
02:30:16,154 --> 02:30:18,122
I'm here to take Sandhya with me,

1398
02:30:18,956 --> 02:30:22,790
leave Sandhya,

1399
02:30:23,127 --> 02:30:25,152
Dada, don't force me to kill you.

1400
02:30:26,831 --> 02:30:28,264
Don't force me to kill you.

1401
02:30:28,433 --> 02:30:30,401
You're talking to Bhagawan.

1402
02:30:30,568 --> 02:30:32,502
You're talking to Bhagawan's strength.

1403
02:30:32,637 --> 02:30:35,936
You'll regret this, Jai.
- You'll die, leave her.

1404
02:30:38,276 --> 02:30:39,903
Why should I leave her?

1405
02:30:40,812 --> 02:30:43,144
I gave you gun for my sake,

1406
02:30:43,848 --> 02:30:45,645
I gave you life for my sake,

1407
02:30:46,484 --> 02:30:49,976
I've turned you like armour
for my sake,

1408
02:30:52,256 --> 02:30:56,158
even if you die,
you must die for me only.

1409
02:30:56,828 --> 02:30:57,817
Die for my sake only.

1410
02:30:59,097 --> 02:31:01,964
But she has taken me away from you.
