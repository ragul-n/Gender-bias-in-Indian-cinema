2
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,770
Hey!

3
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,850
Hey!!

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,230
So remind me.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,650
Why do we have these parties?

6
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,600
Networking.

7
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,150
Networking. Right.

8
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,310
That's Hans from Lumiere
International Films.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,100
Oh yeah?

10
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,980
He handles Europe sales. Catch him.

11
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,730
Me?

12
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,400
Who are you kidding?

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,600
Nobody watches my films here.

14
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,190
Who's going to watch them there?

15
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,020
Who's that?

16
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,020
She's coming here.

17
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,560
Isn't that French guy cute?

18
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,190
Who? Him?

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,150
He's not interested in you.

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,310
Sorry?

21
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,850
He's looking at me. He's...

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,040
Aw! Why are all the good guys gay?

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,650
That's not true. I'm not gay.

24
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,910
You're not good either.

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,360
I know you.
You're a scoundrel.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,500
Absolutely.

27
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,690
Hello!

28
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,670
Shireen!

29
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,250
Mrs. Shireen Caria-Papa...

30
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,040
Shireen...

31
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,710
Mum! I can't hear you...

32
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm at the film festival...

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,880
FILM FESTIVAL!

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,460
I'll call you tomorrow.

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,250
Mom?

36
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,670
Yes. As usual.

37
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,000
Come... let's go dance.

38
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't be boring.

39
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,130
You're off the clock.

40
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,290
Why don't you go change?

41
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,710
There's a long line at the bathroom.

42
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,420
Happy Birthday!

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,580
Late again?

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,330
It was raining. Didn't realise.

45
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,500
Why don't you wear
the watch I got you?

46
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,420
Huh? What's this?

47
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,210
Wow! Colour rolls!

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,460
So cool!

49
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,290
Thank you!

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,630
Shall we go? Hey!

51
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,460
Let's go.

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,330
You can come in now.

53
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,210
Wow!

54
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,130
One minute.

55
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,080
Happy Birthday!

56
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,290
It's bitter.

57
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,880
It's my first time.

58
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,330
Ok, gift number 2!

59
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,080
Shireen, this...

60
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,040
First time, eh?

61
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,830
Shireen...

62
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,710
You ok?

63
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,880
The cake was bitter.

64
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,400
I'll get you some water.

65
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,030
Water!

66
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,610
Are you ok now?

67
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,150
Hello!

68
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,780
Shireen...

69
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,030
You didn't have to.

70
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,400
Come on. Now, let's see you wear it.

71
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,280
What do you mean wear?

72
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,400
I'll go home and wear it.

73
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,730
Home? Wear it for me here.

74
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,230
Give me the T-shirt?

75
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,570
Shireen...

76
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,150
Hey... sorry!

77
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,070
I'm sorry!

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,900
It's okay. Just watch.

79
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,610
What?

80
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,980
I mean... Keep watch!

81
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,070
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,280
I'm sorry!

83
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,150
Haven't you seen this ever?

84
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,110
Do you often do this?

85
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,320
I mean... In public?

86
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,690
Yes. I'm used to it.

87
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,070
This is what I do.

88
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,320
Excuse me?

89
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,400
Relax, I'm kidding!

90
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,860
The modest rose puts forth a thorn,

91
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,980
The humble sheep a threatening horn,

92
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,320
The lily white...

93
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,650
Oh Shit!

94
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,030
The green one!

95
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,320
Yes, go green!

96
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,190
No, no, I said the green one.

97
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
The green one, the green one.

98
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,150
No, no...

99
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Done.

100
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,650
Almost had you there for a moment!

101
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,030
Someone's been in there
for a really long time...

102
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,650
I don't know...
Either they are drunk or...

103
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,440
Or probably she's doing it in there.

104
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,820
That's why...

105
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,150
Ok.

106
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,360
Thanks.

107
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,980
And you are?

108
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,780
I'm K!

109
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,360
Just K?

110
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,820
Yeah. Just K.

111
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,530
It's impossible. He's going
back to India in the morning.

112
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,320
Maybe I can meet him
for dinner tonight, please?

113
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
Mr. Patel already
has dinner plans, dear!

114
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,730
I just need ten minutes.

115
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,230
He'll be back in a couple of months.

116
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,780
Ten minutes is all I'm asking for.

117
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,360
Tell him I'm a friend
of Shah Rukh Khan!

118
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Are you?

119
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,780
I'll become one.

120
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,030
Please. Just ask him.

121
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Ok. I'll try.

122
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,150
Well, the film is about
how day to day objects

123
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,780
can become agents
of romantic connection

124
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,110
between two people who never meet!

125
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,570
It's about puritan romance.
Innocent but intense.

126
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,780
Can you turn it into
a romantic comedy?

127
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,980
I'll try my best, Sir.

128
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,400
With lots of sex.

129
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,030
Ok? - Good sex.

130
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,610
Sure sir, we can do sex.

131
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,400
Oops!

132
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,480
What's she doing here?

133
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,650
She chose green after all.

134
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,110
I didn't know we had company.

135
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,070
Oh, he's leaving.

136
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,110
I don't mind.

137
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,360
Does he talk?

138
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,730
He was telling me about his script.

139
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,400
Is it any good?

140
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,070
Well, actually,
I was trying to tell him about how

141
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,650
day to day objects can become

142
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,690
agents of romantic connection...

143
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,610
Huh? I thought it was about sex!

144
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,900
Yes sir, and sex.

145
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,570
Lots of sex too.

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,860
And here are your oysters...

147
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,320
Oysters?

148
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,900
How do you eat these?

149
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,360
The old pervert!

150
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,650
Shit - The bald clown!

151
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,480
I'll be back soon.

152
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,440
Let me try too.

153
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,400
Go on. They don't bite.

154
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,230
I know they don't bite.

155
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,530
Hold it up with the
wide end facing you...

156
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,320
Then work your tongue around it
gently but firmly - Ok?

157
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,530
And then slurp it up.

158
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,650
As if you were eating.

159
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,730
P*ssy.

160
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,150
You know, the trouble
with you Indian men...

161
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,110
You like your food overcooked.

162
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,570
Are you saying we are bad lovers?

163
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,230
I keep an open mind.

164
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,360
Now, watch!

165
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,980
Not bad.

166
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,780
Thank you.

167
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,650
So, you think I chose the right dress?

168
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,530
Did I?

169
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,980
Of course. Yes.

170
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,230
It brings out your eyes.

171
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,190
How long have you been filming me for?

172
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
A while.

173
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,110
Have you seen me naked?

174
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,730
A few times. Yes.

175
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,650
Having sex?

176
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,360
Twice - Have you?

177
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,780
Yes.

178
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,620
Did you enjoy it?

179
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,800
Yes.

180
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm really offended, you know...

181
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,530
You could have shut the curtains.

182
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,320
I can hand you to the police.

183
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,980
You have no evidence.

184
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,780
True.

185
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,150
I'll just tell Patel then.

186
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,150
I would love to see
the look on his face.

187
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,780
What you doing with this ass?

188
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,900
Question.

189
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,530
Why are you with this beast?

190
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,110
Are you judging me?

191
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,820
Are you using him?

192
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,610
Maybe he's using me.

193
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,190
Right.

194
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,980
Look at you. So self-righteous.

195
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,860
We are the same. You and I.

196
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,570
We use people because we can.

197
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,230
Yeah right.

198
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
You know nothing about me.

199
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,980
I lost my mother when I was a kid.

200
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,900
I lost my father
a couple of months ago.

201
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,900
And I'm currently here on his savings.

202
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,030
You won't get it.

203
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,730
Nothing good ever stays with me.

204
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,360
Don't get defensive.

205
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,320
That's how it goes.

206
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,280
You take something.
You give something.

207
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,570
So, will you help me?

208
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,730
What do you have in mind?

209
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,780
I have a feeling that you and I

210
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,570
are going to have some fun together.

211
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,610
So, where were we?

212
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,980
You just agreed to
make this nice man's film.

213
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,940
Did I?

214
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Why would I lie?

215
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,070
Now, we'll get your sex.

216
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,940
I'm done. Finished.

217
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,690
Over.

218
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Why?

219
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,690
Because it's late.
Because I'm done.

220
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,400
And because I'm not
17 anymore, you see.

221
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,570
I am.

222
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,530
What? 17?

223
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,320
You're 17?

224
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,030
Don't worry. I'm 23.

225
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,400
Shireen is your Mom?

226
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,940
Yeah.

227
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,480
I knew a Shireen once.

228
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,860
Ex?

229
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,690
Something like that.

230
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,530
Of course!

231
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,110
Are you guys from Delhi?

232
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,780
Why so interested?

233
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,320
Keep guessing, Uncle.

234
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,570
Or should I say, Daddy?

235
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,730
Not funny. Ok?

236
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,780
Monsieur Francois is checking you out.

237
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,530
No, he's not.

238
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,110
He's married. Was kidding.

239
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,940
You aren't married, right?

240
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,650
I used to be married.
Not anymore.

241
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,980
Are you a dancer?

242
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,980
Thank you.

243
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,690
You'd cook. And I would set the mood.

244
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,980
Right. Convenient deal for you.

245
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Can I tell you something?

246
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,400
Mm-hmm!

247
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,860
Honest. You're looking lovely.

248
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,440
Thank you.

249
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,320
Maybe it's the candle-light
making me look good.

250
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,820
You are really looking lovely.

251
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,190
Taste it now.

252
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,860
Nice?

253
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Oh My God! - What?

254
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,400
What happened?

255
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,070
Spicy?

256
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,820
But it was the usual amount.

257
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,570
You forgot again - What?

258
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,940
I hate chillies.

259
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,150
I haven't put extra chillies in it.

260
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,980
Alright, here you go. Some <i>raita</i>.

261
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,860
Something sweet to compensate.

262
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,690
One minute.

263
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,980
Hello.

264
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,780
Hmm.

265
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,780
Yeah.

266
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,110
Ok, listen I'll... I'll...
call you back, ok?

267
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,940
Yeah. I'll call you back.

268
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,360
So is she beautiful?

269
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,650
Who?

270
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,780
Your heroine.

271
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,150
She is not bad.

272
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,570
She is ok.

273
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,690
But you got what you wanted?

274
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
More or less.

275
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,780
You know, there is still few
days of shooting left. Let's see.

276
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,030
By the way, you stopped
giving me feedback on my scripts.

277
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,360
That's because you've
stopped listening.

278
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,690
That's not true, Rija.

279
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,070
You know that's not true.

280
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,150
So you f*cked her!

281
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,530
You f*cked her?

282
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,680
No. Not yet again!

283
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,360
For God's sake,
this was supposed to be a celebration.

284
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,360
You are such a liar, K!

285
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,730
I know you better
than you know yourself!

286
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,400
You know, every evening I come home

287
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,820
and try and do things for you...

288
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,030
And I tell you I love you.

289
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,690
You have to believe me.

290
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,940
I don't love you, K.

291
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,730
I really don't love you.

292
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,320
Then why are we still together?

293
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,230
If there is no love,
why do we live together?

294
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,480
I got rid of it, K.

295
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,650
This morning.

296
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,900
Got rid of what?

297
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,900
The child.

298
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,070
I got rid of the child this morning.

299
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,400
Are you crazy?

300
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,400
It was our child for God's sake.

301
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,230
My child!

302
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,030
Are you nuts?!

303
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,030
You know what? I've got news for you.
I don't love you either.

304
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,650
It's over. Done. Finished.

305
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,860
And I'm glad we don't have a child...

306
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,730
Because God forbid that child
didn't live up to your expectations...

307
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,150
You would have killed it anyway!

308
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,030
Oy!

309
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920
What? Another flashback.

310
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,570
Let's see.

311
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,610
You are thinking about Shireen.

312
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,360
No, wait.

313
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,730
That's not it.

314
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,030
Ooh! Intense.

315
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,690
Your wife.

316
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,570
Ex-wife.

317
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,570
I'm sorry.

318
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,070
I'm sorry, Rija.

319
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,280
I didn't mean anything, ok?

320
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,110
We will work it out, Rija.

321
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,900
Enough K.

322
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,360
No more lies.

323
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,400
Pass me those cards, please?

324
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,980
Pick a card.

325
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,610
I don't believe in magic.

326
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,780
So if I guess your card right,
would you believe in magic?

327
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,650
Nope.

328
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,320
It would just be a co-incidence.

329
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,610
Or a very clever trick.

330
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,400
Or divine intervention. A miracle.

331
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,570
Oh, you don't believe in God?

332
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,610
What's there to believe?

333
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Well, someone's making
all this happen.

334
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,530
I mean what are the odds of you

335
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,780
meeting someone you know
in this place?

336
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,400
This is a film market.
Everyone here is from showbiz.

337
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm a filmmaker.
I've made like 20 films.

338
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,280
People would have seen one or two.

339
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,070
Or at least heard of me.

340
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Oh yeah!

341
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,530
You are K, right?

342
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,110
The one who wears
dark glasses all the time.

343
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,780
Even at night?

344
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,190
I thought you didn't know who I am.

345
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,940
K is not a name.

346
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,070
It's a mask.

347
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,820
I think it's a character.

348
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,480
At least it has character.

349
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,190
Guess it's just co-incidence.

350
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,690
So how did you make 8 to 8?

351
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,730
Amitabh Bachchan.

352
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,440
His was the first name
that came to my mind

353
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,320
when Orko called me
for a job offer in Kolkata.

354
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,570
At that time, it was Calcutta.

355
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,360
The same Calcutta

356
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,400
where Vijay got his first job.

357
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,530
So how could I say No?

358
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,650
But I had no savings.

359
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,860
And not even a place to stay.

360
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,400
Till I found Mrs. Baker.

361
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,110
The kind and crazy Mrs. Baker.

362
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,650
Oh no! Bombay boy!

363
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,780
That room's gone. You go too.

364
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,280
I work at the recording
studio at night.

365
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,440
Every night?

366
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,110
Every night except Saturdays.

367
00:23:59,170 --> 00:23:59,970
All night?

368
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,900
Ten to six.

369
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,930
I can give you the room from 8 to 8.

370
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,070
You can't come before eight.

371
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,030
You can't stay after eight.

372
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,780
Even on Saturdays.

373
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,980
And I got the room.

374
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,690
Everyday from eight to eight.

375
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,230
The world's most crowded room.

376
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,820
The world's most lonely room.

377
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,030
The room with so many stories.

378
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,400
The room with our story.

379
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,570
<i>The windows are closed.</i>

380
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,940
<i>And the doors locked.</i>

381
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,190
<i>How then do the dreams enter the room?</i>

382
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,820
<i>There's some hole in the sleep</i>

383
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,690
<i>that stays open.</i>

384
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,730
<i>The rooms are the same.</i>

385
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,030
<i>So are the inhabitants.</i>

386
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,230
<i>No one's a stranger
in a new city.</i>

387
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,070
<i>The pains are the same.</i>

388
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,150
<i>So are the relationships.</i>

389
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,900
<i>People get lost all the time.</i>

390
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,530
<i>To meet again and again.</i>

391
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,730
<i>At the crossroads of epic stories.</i>

392
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,780
<i>Does anyone get lost forever?</i>

393
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,650
<i>The moon rises and hangs.</i>

394
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,320
<i>From the sky every night.</i>

395
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,030
<i>And travels in daylight
to the next night.</i>

396
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,570
<i>A distance so short
travelled through lifetimes.</i>

397
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,150
<i>The way she took my name.</i>

398
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,190
<i>As if I've read this
story in some novel.</i>

399
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,900
<i>Some relationships perhaps</i>

400
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,230
<i>are best left inside
the pages of a book.</i>

401
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,030
<i>My days and nights lie scattered.</i>

402
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,400
<i>Like pearls from a broken necklace.</i>

403
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,480
<i>You had kept me together.</i>

404
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,980
<i>Inside the shell of my body.</i>

405
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,530
<i>I've been looking for someone else.</i>

406
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,940
<i>One that is me
and one that shines.</i>

407
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,190
<i>How do two swords survive
in the same sheath?</i>

408
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,820
<i>Your thoughts lit up in me.</i>

409
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,400
<i>Like a candle in the dark.</i>

410
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,030
<i>Now blow it out.</i>

411
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,530
<i>Or it will burn the finger.</i>

412
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,400
Won't you come out for breakfast?

413
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,440
Oh! You aren't even ready yet.

414
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,030
I think I have fever, Mrs. Baker.

415
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,820
You do.

416
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,530
You can't go to work today.

417
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,610
He's going to be here, no?

418
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,570
Is it ok if I see him today?

419
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,440
He's gone.

420
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,480
Some emergency!

421
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,730
I lost my father
a couple of months ago.

422
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,110
I'm currently here on his savings.

423
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,860
He's gone?

424
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,400
But what about his things?

425
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,110
What about his things?

426
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,320
He said he didn't need them.

427
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,230
He said I could do

428
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,690
what I wanted to do with them.

429
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,980
As if I need them.

430
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
I never met her.

431
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,690
Not once.

432
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,360
For the six months
that we were together,

433
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,190
we never met each other.

434
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,320
Not the way a boy meets girl.

435
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,400
No.

436
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,980
Never ever?

437
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,110
No.

438
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,860
But why not?

439
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,690
I think it's more
interesting like that.

440
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,150
Had I met her

441
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,820
I would have never become a filmmaker.

442
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,980
Don't you think our
love story is more poignant

443
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,400
because we never met?

444
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,980
She was more interesting
as a character,

445
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,480
As a muse.

446
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,230
Otherwise, we would have gotten into

447
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,780
the mundane boring reality of life.

448
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,780
That's really boring!

449
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,360
So you'd rather give
up on real life opportunities

450
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,190
to create these epic,
iconic movie moments?

451
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Absolutely!

452
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,280
You know, films are the what-ifs
of everything you never got to

453
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,320
and never will do in your life.

454
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,360
It's your ticket to escape
the misery of life.

455
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,780
That's cinema.

456
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,360
For me.

457
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,230
So, what have you never done in life?

458
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,860
Tough question.

459
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,230
I've done pretty much
everything there is to do.

460
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,400
Have you jumped into
a pool at two in the morning?

461
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,820
That I have not done.

462
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,360
Hey! Ow!

463
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,980
God! You're mad.

464
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,940
Yeah.

465
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,400
Have you ever scored
weed at two in the morning?

466
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,400
Good to go?

467
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,030
Sober enough to drive?

468
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,650
I think so. Why?

469
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,400
Where's the fun in that?

470
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,480
What do you mean?

471
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,480
Hold on.

472
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,070
Huh!

473
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,900
Wait.

474
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,650
Shall we go?

475
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,230
Let's get you out of that mask.

476
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,190
Why am I here?

477
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,860
Why am I here
with the heat and the sun.

478
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,530
And the chaos.

479
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,280
And the strange vibrations?

480
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,280
Why am I here.

481
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,940
F*cked up and failed?

482
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,280
There were so many thoughts,

483
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,690
wicked thoughts I had
sexy shots, thoughts...

484
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,190
F*ck!

485
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,650
Can't write now with that MDMA

486
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,820
running around inside my brain
like a train in China.

487
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,900
No, it came in an envelope.

488
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,650
Snail mail.

489
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,610
All the way from London.

490
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,860
Not China.
Never China.

491
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,030
And now I'm f*cked.

492
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,780
I want to feel I'm f*cked...

493
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,940
But I can't,
I'm SO f*cked!

494
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,360
Am I thinking this
or can you hear all this?

495
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,690
Behind her, the city faded.

496
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,900
Like a beautiful shadow.

497
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,230
She had her back to the camera.

498
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,110
And she was gently swaying
half-naked...

499
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,030
Sweating.

500
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,230
Perhaps she was Chandramukhi,
the mistress.

501
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,320
<i>I keep looking at your
face but I fail to pass out.</i>

502
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,030
<i>There's always a
bit of me in my senses.</i>

503
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,740
<i>- Tell my senses that I don't want sense.</i>
- What happened Sir?

504
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,280
Do you need anything?

505
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,400
No, no.

506
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,570
Why are you taking photos of me?

507
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,360
Not photo. Video.

508
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,230
Why?

509
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Because just like that.

510
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,280
Sorry I didn't ask you.

511
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,360
I'm a filmmaker, right...

512
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,820
So, I keep shooting everything.
It's a habit.

513
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,280
But...

514
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,610
Can I have some water?

515
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,940
Yes, I'll go bring it.

516
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,430
Please.

517
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,190
Some ice?

518
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,320
Yes.

519
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,190
Fill it up.

520
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,690
Another glass?

521
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,900
For you.

522
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,280
Good.

523
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,690
Good.

524
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,400
What's your name?

525
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,860
Basanti.

526
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,190
Basanti.

527
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,980
B for Basanti.

528
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,150
K for K!

529
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,730
Bring the ice-box? Saw it in the room.

530
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,610
Yes. Bringing.

531
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,780
Thank you, Basanti.

532
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,650
There you go, baby.

533
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,110
Drink, water for you.

534
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,070
But...

535
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:05,320
Drink, it's water.
It's not a drink.

536
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
It's ok.

537
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,860
Enough of shooting me, please.

538
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,400
No, it's ok. It's ok. - I'm done.

539
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,400
It's ok, listen.

540
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,440
I have a very good subject.
Will you listen?

541
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,400
Ok.

542
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,090
Is the water good?

543
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,820
It's like this.

544
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,820
I'm trying to write a story.

545
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,730
Can you help me?

546
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm a little stuck.

547
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,230
Help please?

548
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,030
Me?

549
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,690
Yes, why not?

550
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,650
Do you watch movies?

551
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,980
Everybody does.

552
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,070
Yeah, exactly.

553
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,730
But?

554
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,940
No but...
Listen to this. Imagine...

555
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,650
Imagine this is the location.

556
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,530
Imagine there's a girl by the window.

557
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,150
A very beautiful girl, ok?

558
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,000
She's dancing, swaying...

559
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,230
She's Chandramukhi, a mistress.

560
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,230
Listen, did you call anyone?

561
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,860
No.

562
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,350
Did you tell anyone you are here?

563
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,730
Who is it?

564
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,070
Nobody knows I'm here.

565
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,280
Open the door, K - What's this?

566
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,280
I know you are in there.

567
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,280
What the f*ck is going on?

568
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,780
Please don't do this to me.

569
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,070
Open the door.

570
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,280
Oh ff...

571
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,860
Open the door K.

572
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,200
Open the door, you motherf*cker.

573
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,110
Otherwise, I'll create a scene, K.

574
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,190
Do you want that?

575
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,980
Open the door.

576
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,570
I just need to talk to you.

577
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,280
You are such a liar, K.

578
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,480
- Open the door, K.
- What the f*ck is this?

579
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,400
Open the door, you mother*cker.

580
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,320
Who is it?

581
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,480
No, there's no one.

582
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,070
Listen, there's nobody there.

583
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,190
Who is it?
Open the door - No, no, no, no!

584
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,400
No, no.

585
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,150
- Why are you behaving like this?
- Like what?

586
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,440
Let me see what's going on.

587
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,150
No, you can't. You can't.

588
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,480
It's you, isn't it? It's you.

589
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,690
She looks like you.

590
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,730
What do you mean she looks like me?

591
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,030
Who is she?

592
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,190
Do you know her?

593
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,230
And then what happens?

594
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,860
I don't know. I don't know.

595
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,110
What? - I mean I've
written only till this point.

596
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,820
I don't know what happens next.

597
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,940
I have no idea.

598
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,070
Tell me?

599
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,320
The story's yours.

600
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,170
Damn the story!

601
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,670
Ok, does the man open the door?

602
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,830
Don't know.

603
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,920
How is it possible?

604
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,830
I don't know.

605
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,920
The same girl. Inside and outside?

606
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,330
Strange.

607
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,000
If that ever happened,
even I would go crazy.

608
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,540
I am going crazy.

609
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,920
Let her come in.

610
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,750
Who?

611
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,210
The outside one.

612
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,870
Paro, the wife?

613
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,620
Who Paro?

614
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,000
The outside one.

615
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,170
Actually, she's the same one inside.

616
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,250
Let her in.

617
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,670
And the inside one?

618
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,460
What do we do with her?

619
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,830
Let's lock her in.

620
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,790
Why?

621
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,460
Don't humiliate me like this.

622
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,920
What the f*ck - Please!

623
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,670
F*ck!

624
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,330
Who are you?

625
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,290
Who am I?

626
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,670
Yeah, who are you?

627
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,920
Who am I?

628
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,170
You don't even remember me!

629
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,420
Please, please, please.

630
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,290
Why are you f*cking my mind like this?

631
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,340
Because you did the same thing to me.

632
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,040
Oh! Stop crying, please.

633
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,000
You wanted this thing to happen.

634
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,750
What thing?

635
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,500
All your life,

636
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,250
you have been walking
towards your doom.

637
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,290
You f*cked her!

638
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,290
Your f*cking pathetic little life.

639
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,080
Back to replacing people?

640
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,620
You disgust me!

641
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,960
Just calm down.
Can you please calm down?

642
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,420
You need me.

643
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,790
I need you for what?

644
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,290
You can't do it alone.

645
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,190
What do you want?

646
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,330
I'm your saviour.

647
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,500
Oh right. You are my saviour.

648
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,340
Can you just go find your husband

649
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,080
wherever the f*ck he is.

650
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,460
You need me.

651
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,620
I don't need anybody.

652
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,210
You need me.

653
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,540
What the f*ck are you doing?

654
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,170
Please put that down.

655
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,570
Listen, don't do this.

656
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,080
What's happening to me?

657
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,460
I don't know who you are.
Please put that down.

658
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,020
What's happening to me?

659
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,540
You need me.

660
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,710
You need me.

661
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,080
You need me - Wait!

662
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,250
What happened?

663
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,670
You killed me.

664
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,330
Not funny!

665
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,420
So you don't believe in God.

666
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,920
But you believe in ghosts?

667
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,460
I believe in science.

668
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,870
You don't believe.

669
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,670
You believe in signs.

670
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,960
Not science.

671
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,960
God, science, same thing.

672
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,370
I believe in what I see.

673
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,830
Um-hmm!

674
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,390
Do you believe?

675
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,310
Do you believe in God?

676
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,600
In science?

677
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,350
Time travel?

678
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,960
What if I told you...

679
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,080
You've already lived this life before.

680
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,920
And the only reason
you are living it again is

681
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,040
because you wanted
to give it another shot.

682
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,380
Another take.

683
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,750
Endings are predestined.

684
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,290
I always start with an ending.

685
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,630
You see, the whole process of creating

686
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,290
becomes so much more fun...

687
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,380
Otherwise, I feel lost

688
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,880
when I don't know where
my story is heading towards

689
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,210
or ending, you know.

690
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,250
And I always think
I'm in a movie, you know.

691
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,080
Even now, I'm probably in a movie.

692
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,540
Thanks guys. For
watching 8 to 8.

693
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,800
I really enjoyed your talk.

694
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,670
Well, I specialise
in talking nonsense.

695
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,210
No, no it was interesting

696
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,790
to understand how the
stories form in your mind.

697
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,170
So is this your first
time in San Francisco?

698
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,040
Yeah, that's right.

699
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,040
First time.

700
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,000
Did you get a chance to see the city?

701
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,750
Or were you stuck
at the film festival?

702
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,670
No, I really wanted to.

703
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,960
But these film festivals are so nice.

704
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,380
I hardly got time to step out.

705
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,750
That's sad. You should get a chance

706
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,250
to see the city before you leave.

707
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,040
Here...

708
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,420
But who will show me around?

709
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,250
I will.

710
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,540
Let's go.
Deep breath.

711
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,460
Be cool.

712
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,630
Action time.

713
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,170
Hey! Hi!

714
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,790
You look kind of different.

715
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,500
So when do you sleep?

716
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,830
When I feel sleepy.

717
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,970
Or whenever someone
wants to give me company.

718
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,920
Let's listen to some music.

719
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,130
Just think of it
as the background score

720
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,790
of the movie you and
me are acting in right now.

721
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,590
Do you mean it when you say

722
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,130
you actually think we
are in a movie all the time?

723
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,330
Or are you just saying that because

724
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,920
filmmakers are supposed
to sound crazy?

725
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,130
Do you get time to watch movies?

726
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,630
Yeah but frankly
I prefer to curl up with a book.

727
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,580
I like to touch the books,

728
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,500
feel them.

729
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,960
Hmm! Who's like your favourite writer?

730
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,500
I don't know.
Maybe Salman Rushdie.

731
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,290
Huh!

732
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,080
Why are you making a face?

733
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,380
What's wrong with Rushdie?

734
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Well, I have this theory that women

735
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,290
don't like him for what he writes.

736
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,130
They like him because

737
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,960
he's someone they cannot understand.

738
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,830
What makes you think
I don't understand Rushdie.

739
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,250
I said women.

740
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,630
Plural, you know.

741
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,580
Sanjana, can I ask you something?

742
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,080
What do you think will be
the ending of this movie?

743
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,170
Ok, you are the creative guy.

744
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,500
Figure out an ending.

745
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,630
Hmmm!

746
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,000
Ok, track in.

747
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,040
Here's what I think.

748
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,500
We should go back to the car,

749
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,920
get in the backseat...

750
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,210
You take all your clothes off...

751
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,710
I take all my clothes off.

752
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,420
And then, maybe kiss.

753
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,670
I mean...

754
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,250
Or is it too...

755
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,170
You know,
you've got such expressive eyes.

756
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,750
Even your lips are so expressive.

757
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:34,750
Hey!

758
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,670
Anjana!
Ranjana!

759
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,380
Sanjana!
Listen, na!

760
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,670
Look, Mr. Artist.

761
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,750
How about you order
me a glass of wine.

762
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,790
And if it's good...

763
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,920
And I like it...

764
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,830
Then maybe we go back to the car,

765
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,460
I take all this off

766
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,630
and maybe, we do it.

767
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,830
And if I don't like it,

768
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,790
then I drop you back
to where I picked you up from

769
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,960
and I never talk to you

770
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,960
and you never see me ever again.

771
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,710
Right.

772
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,670
Ok, let me see.

773
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,330
Can you please give me a minute?

774
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,130
You want me to order wine?
No big deal.

775
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,210
Just answer a couple
of simple questions

776
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,790
that will help me understand you.

777
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,040
Ok, how do you like to make out?

778
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,170
With or without protection?

779
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,880
Seriously?

780
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,290
Look, you either order
me the wine right now...

781
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,130
Or we end this movie
with me walking out.

782
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,210
Ok, need to make some
sense of this, you know.

783
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,590
If I can make a movie,

784
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,790
I can order wine.

785
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,000
Excuse me.

786
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,250
The lady will have a glass of

787
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,880
number 5 here, what's that?

788
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,130
Cotes Du Rhone?

789
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,420
Hey!

790
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,170
Ok, please don't.

791
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,630
What is wrong with you?

792
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,040
Look, you may or may
not even like the wine...

793
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,290
But whatever happens,
I just want you to know

794
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,590
that I really enjoyed
the last 90 minutes

795
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,920
I've spent with you.

796
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,420
Please... I suggest
we sit here for a while.

797
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,790
And have a conversation, you know.

798
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,130
A filmmaker and a doctor
talking about...

799
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,210
I don't know...

800
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,420
Erogenous zones or
something like that?

801
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,290
Hey, that can be a nice ending
for a movie.

802
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,880
An abstract ending.
Like those French movies.

803
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,460
I work at an ER.

804
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,130
Ok?

805
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,380
Emergency Room.

806
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,580
Right.

807
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,380
I see people's lives coming to an end

808
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,670
every single day.

809
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:21,880
I'm sorry.

810
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,500
So for f*ck's sake,
will you stop talking about endings?

811
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,630
I'm sorry.

812
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,750
It's ok.

813
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,250
I think I have an ending for you.

814
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,460
Aha!

815
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,040
Is it a happy ending?

816
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,920
Ah! Ff... Ow!

817
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,460
I think that was a better end
than me and you talking about

818
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,040
erogenous zones, right?

819
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,000
Ok, ok... I get it.

820
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,210
You slapped me because
you wanted to touch and feel me.

821
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,880
Like you touch your Rushdie books.

822
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,290
I get it.

823
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,670
You filmmakers are shameless.

824
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,460
A little shameless.

825
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,670
For art's sake.

826
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,710
Somebody's got to entertain

827
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,580
stressed out doctors like you.

828
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,670
No?

829
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,920
Ok, well...

830
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,630
If your movie is over...

831
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,210
You can come home with me.

832
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,960
And?

833
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,380
You can come home with me

834
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,210
and you can read
Midnight's Children out loud to me.

835
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,580
I could never get past page 50.

836
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,960
A filmmaker reading out to a doctor.

837
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,630
Frankly, that's sounds
like the beginning of a new movie.

838
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,670
Thank God you know the word Beginning.

839
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,330
Where's my watch?

840
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,540
Is it expensive?

841
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,420
Expensive?
It's bloody priceless.

842
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,880
We have to go back to the car.

843
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,040
We have to go back to the car - Wait.

844
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,500
I can't lose that watch.

845
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,000
Hey!

846
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,290
What?

847
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,500
It's not in the car.

848
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,750
What do you mean it's not in the car?

849
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,170
Where is it? - It's not in the car.

850
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,540
Remember this?

851
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,540
It's at the pool!

852
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,670
Sorry.

853
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,080
Buy you another one?

854
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,920
You think I have been hunting
in the dark for half an hour

855
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,710
because I can't afford one?

856
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,380
Yeah but...

857
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,750
How can I make it up to you?

858
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,210
It was a very special watch.

859
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,750
She gave it to me
on our fourth anniversary.

860
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,580
No, third anniversary.

861
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,630
I didn't wear it because
I had too many watches.

862
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,290
I didn't even realise I had it
till I started missing her.

863
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,210
I've worn it just for a few weeks.

864
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,290
But I've had it for seven years.

865
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,750
You know, it's funny that...

866
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,000
How easily we take things for granted!

867
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,630
One second.

868
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,170
I think I have something for you.

869
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,080
What?

870
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,670
In my jacket?

871
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,040
Wait.

872
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,920
What brand was it?

873
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,170
Patek Philippe.

874
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,790
Your lucky day.

875
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,250
Here you go.

876
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,540
Rolex.

877
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:24,580
Really?

878
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,500
Wow!

879
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:33,670
You like it?

880
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,790
Very nice. This colour I didn't have.

881
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,210
You think I'll make a good actress?

882
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,170
What?

883
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,630
You're an actress?

884
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,790
You think I make a good one?

885
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,540
I don't know.

886
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,500
Wait.

887
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,590
You don't think I did all this

888
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,080
just so that I can
be in one of your films

889
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:26,960
or whatever, right?

890
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,540
I don't know, really.

891
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,830
Don't think so much.

892
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,330
I think we need to get dried up.

893
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,210
Where?

894
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:39,830
Your room.

895
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,630
I don't think it's a good idea.

896
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,210
Don't worry.
I won't sleep with you.

897
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,330
Ok, great.

898
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,250
Thanks.

899
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,500
Where are you going?

900
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,920
Listen.

901
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,580
I read it.

902
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,420
And I loved it.

903
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,210
Ayesha, you shouldn't have read it.

904
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,210
You shouldn't have, really.

905
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,670
But why not?

906
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,750
It was so beautiful.

907
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,330
You and like this!

908
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,210
I had even forgotten
how romantic you were.

909
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,630
Thank you very much.

910
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,590
But listen,
you shouldn't have used my laptop.

911
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,630
So what?

912
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,960
I've told you...

913
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,710
There could be personally stuff in it.

914
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,630
Babe - What?

915
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,330
Why is your Browsing
History is always clear?

916
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,300
My junk is always full.

917
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,880
We don't need this.

918
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,040
What?

919
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,380
You don't want to?

920
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,540
I didn't say that.

921
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,920
No, no. No chances.

922
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,950
No - But...

923
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,080
What if I want?

924
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,630
Ayesha, please.
We have been over this.

925
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,960
Again and again.

926
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's been two years, K.

927
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,170
I don't know what you are scared of.

928
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,960
I'm at the top of my career.

929
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,500
I finally call the
shots in my own life.

930
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,330
I want to experience motherhood.

931
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,790
Listen, I'm not scared of anything.

932
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,080
Then why do we need this?

933
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,670
Aren't we fine the way we are?

934
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,830
Huh?

935
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,290
Aren't we?

936
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,630
I know how you feel about marriage.

937
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,630
Relax.

938
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,040
We are not getting married.

939
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,330
I'm not Rija.

940
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,540
I won't take your shit.
But...

941
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,500
that doesn't mean that

942
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,830
I don't like the idea of a little K

943
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,290
running around the house.

944
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,830
You want to play with
a little version of K?

945
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,630
Stop being a prick.

946
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,830
Ayesha there's still time, ok?

947
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,210
And honestly,
maybe I'm not ready for this.

948
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,580
We are together, there for each other.
Isn't that enough?

949
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,670
As long as we can.

950
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,540
You are the most
important woman in my life.

951
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,790
Right here.
Right now.

952
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,380
You're like the watch.

953
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,420
You don't stop.

954
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,080
You keep moving.

955
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,250
Day or night.

956
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,630
You don't stop for anyone.

957
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,830
24 hours.

958
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,630
24 frames per second.

959
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,880
You live every moment.

960
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,380
And just don't stay in my hand.

961
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,750
Why?

962
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,630
How was it?

963
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,000
Good. I want exactly this.

964
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,670
No changes.

965
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,040
Exactly this.

966
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,830
So, how was it?

967
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,880
Not bad.

968
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,380
But give me some time, no?

969
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,040
How much do you want to think?

970
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,580
I haven't had to audition
for anyone in two years.

971
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:58,290
You are a friend, Heena.

972
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,540
It's always difficult to judge.

973
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,330
You can be honest with friends, right?

974
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,210
Unless you have a crush...

975
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,540
What?

976
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,290
Are you, like, in love with me?

977
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,500
Love?

978
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,080
No chance.

979
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,210
Then lust?

980
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,630
Are you flirting with me?

981
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,420
Are you?

982
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,710
Do you want me to?

983
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,830
Where's the casting couch, now?

984
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,080
I have a boyfriend.

985
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,630
Well, I have a girlfriend.

986
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,170
Let's pair them as well.

987
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,330
It will be like a Woody Allen film.

988
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,170
Interesting, na?

989
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,670
Yeah, very.

990
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,580
You do know that all Woody
Allen films are the same actually.

991
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,710
Love fades?

992
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,080
So...

993
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,630
You auditioned somebody
else for the role

994
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,630
and sent my photo as a reference?

995
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,710
Ayesha, do we have to do this?

996
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:08,830
Please.

997
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,540
Am I not good enough for you?

998
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,710
Am I saying that?

999
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,880
Don't take it personally.

1000
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,580
I just need a fresh face.

1001
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,500
So let me get this straight.

1002
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,750
I'm too old for your film.

1003
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,090
But I'm not old enough
to have a child.

1004
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,040
Ayesha, it's not that.

1005
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
Ayesha!

1006
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,630
Ayesha, please.

1007
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,380
<i>Give me a kiss (ON TV)</i>

1008
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,250
You know that

1009
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,170
I'm not here
with you for the role, right?

1010
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,830
We are friends.

1011
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,080
You don't have to be weird with me.

1012
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,670
So you are saying you
were not flirting with me

1013
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:57,630
not for the role

1014
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,080
but because you like me?

1015
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,960
There's no right answer to that.

1016
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,330
What?

1017
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,540
I'm extremely attracted to you.

1018
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:11,080
But love... I don't know.

1019
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,630
That's good enough for me.

1020
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,130
What's the difference?

1021
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,630
I have a boyfriend.

1022
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,790
F*ck!

1023
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,580
Come here.

1024
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:24,580
What?

1025
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,540
Please don't overreact,
Ayesha. Please.

1026
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,000
This is over-reacting?

1027
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,540
You kiss someone and
this is over-reacting?

1028
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,420
Heena, I mean Ayesha,
I said I was sorry.

1029
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,830
I am sorry.

1030
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,080
You disgust me.

1031
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,500
Give me a minute - Ayesha!

1032
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,080
Do you love me?

1033
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,670
Yes, I love you.

1034
00:55:58,830 --> 00:55:59,920
Are you sure?

1035
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,920
Yes, I'm sure I love you.

1036
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,460
Why this hesitation?

1037
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,130
I love you, baby.

1038
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,830
Then...

1039
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,880
Let's just pretend
this never happened, ok?

1040
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:22,500
Ok.

1041
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,580
But you have to promise me one thing.

1042
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,790
You will never

1043
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,500
meet that desperate woman ever again.

1044
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,920
I promise you.

1045
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,750
I'm so messed up.

1046
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,750
Yes, you are.

1047
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,130
Are you going to tell your boyfriend?

1048
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,710
No.

1049
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,210
I thought you and me...

1050
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,920
But you would never change.

1051
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,380
Never ever.

1052
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,880
I can try.

1053
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,500
It's always a game of time for you.

1054
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,210
Yesterday, it was Rija.

1055
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,210
Today, it's Ayesha.

1056
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,330
And tomorrow...

1057
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
It will be me.

1058
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,080
Listen this can work, ok?

1059
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,460
I haven't started shooting yet.

1060
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,500
And...

1061
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,330
We can be together and you know...

1062
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,290
Back to replacing people?

1063
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,330
Aren't you?

1064
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,460
I can't love you
just so that I can work with you.

1065
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,960
And I certainly can't break his heart

1066
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,630
for someone like you.

1067
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,130
Oh shit!

1068
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,040
Here we are.

1069
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,980
No. Actually, wait.

1070
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,380
You know,
if this was a Hollywood film...

1071
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,000
I wouldn't have let you go further.

1072
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,580
I would have stopped you right here.

1073
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,960
Pinned you against the wall

1074
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,130
and ripped your dress off.

1075
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,830
And kissed you all over
And, and...

1076
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,500
You would have helped
me with my T-shirt

1077
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,130
and you would have taken my belt

1078
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,210
and thrown it somewhere there.

1079
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,420
And then

1080
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,000
I would have taken you like this

1081
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,000
and turned you around...

1082
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,330
And I would have thrown
you on the bed like this

1083
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,710
and made savage love to you

1084
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:35,920
all night.

1085
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,210
That is, if it was a Hollywood film

1086
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,040
which it is not.
So...

1087
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,540
And if it were a Bollywood film?

1088
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,590
If it were a Bollywood film...

1089
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:46,830
We would be sitting here
on either side of the bed

1090
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,170
like well-behaved children

1091
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,880
looking into each other's eyes

1092
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,080
intensely

1093
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,580
as if we are about to kill a baby.

1094
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,000
You are laughing.

1095
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,290
It's not funny.

1096
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:01,630
You're funny.

1097
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,630
Alright, let me go take a shower.

1098
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,580
WHO IS SHE?

1099
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,080
We can't meet after today

1100
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,920
I can't stay with you anymore, K.

1101
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:02,040
Avantika, you aren't serious.

1102
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,880
A part of me dies every time you go.

1103
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,250
A part of me dies
every time I cheat on him.

1104
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,000
And for you

1105
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,670
it's all about the film.

1106
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,330
This one and the next.

1107
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,830
I was getting married.

1108
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,660
And we were having
sex in my honeymoon suite.

1109
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,960
Did you try stopping
me from marrying him?

1110
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,420
Not even once.

1111
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,210
You just had to stop me once.

1112
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:36,660
I would have left everything
to runaway with you.

1113
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,550
Don't go.

1114
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,920
Please don't go.

1115
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,250
Why should I stay?

1116
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:44,630
So that we can finally be together.

1117
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:45,750
Please marry me.

1118
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,750
Yeah, sure.

1119
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm serious.

1120
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,540
Please... leave him and marry me.

1121
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,420
I was a fool.

1122
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,040
But, this time I'm ready.

1123
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:01,790
I'm not.

1124
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,500
I'm not, K.

1125
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,630
K, slow down!

1126
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,210
K, slow down!

1127
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,130
K, please look at the road

1128
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,250
and slow down...

1129
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,670
K, You'll get us killed!

1130
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,380
Shit!

1131
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,210
You killed me!

1132
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,790
What happened?

1133
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,630
Nothing. Just a nightmare.

1134
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,250
I'm pregnant.
And you're the one getting nightmares?

1135
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,500
Even your nightmares come to me first.

1136
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,080
If there was a Best Husband Trophy,
you would win it.

1137
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,750
Go to sleep.

1138
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,130
You go to sleep.

1139
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,170
Yeah.

1140
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,500
Goodnight.

1141
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,330
K, slow down.

1142
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,040
I'm sorry.

1143
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,210
K, slow down.

1144
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:12,130
K, please look at the road
and slow down.

1145
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,750
K, you'll kill us.

1146
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,710
K, you'll kill our BABY!

1147
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,130
Hi!

1148
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,500
Didn't want to wake you.

1149
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,080
Listen, who are you?

1150
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:37,420
What's your name?

1151
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,580
Why?

1152
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,130
Why because this feels a little weird.

1153
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,000
You don't like this?

1154
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,420
I like it but...

1155
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,630
It doesn't feel real.
It feels like a...

1156
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,290
Dream?

1157
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,580
Hey!

1158
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,080
Stop it.

1159
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,170
Who are you?

1160
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:06,670
Huh?

1161
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:08,880
Who am I?

1162
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,750
Who am I?

1163
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,000
Who am I?

1164
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,080
You don't even remember me?

1165
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:16,170
You don't even remember me?

1166
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,880
What do you mean
you don't remember me?

1167
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,710
What does that mean?

1168
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,580
What do you want from me?

1169
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,330
Hey! I had auditioned.

1170
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:24,790
For Ice-Maid.

1171
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,830
Your Devdas.

1172
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,540
You auditioned for me?

1173
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:36,130
Um... You rejected me.

1174
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,710
Oh I did, did I?

1175
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,380
You think I see all the tapes?

1176
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,960
Really?

1177
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,250
And even if I saw them

1178
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,630
you think I would remember everybody
who auditioned for me?

1179
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:47,790
My God!

1180
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,540
Is that why you are messing with me?

1181
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,430
Messing with you?

1182
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,630
I get it.

1183
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,420
You read the book.

1184
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,880
You've read Exploits
of a Puppeteer, right?

1185
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,630
Right?

1186
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,170
Exploits of a Puppeteer?

1187
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,250
Exploits of a Puppeteer.

1188
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,750
I'm the puppeteer.
Me.

1189
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,960
I wrote about all my exes.

1190
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,040
What? You're collecting
stories for your films?

1191
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,170
Listen, nobody knew
it was about real people, ok!

1192
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,880
It did... it felt like fiction.

1193
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,280
That's not the point.

1194
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,240
What's the point?

1195
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,410
You used them.

1196
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,950
Why do you keep moving
from one girl to another?

1197
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,160
Why do you want to know?

1198
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,530
Because I don't want to be tied down.

1199
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,780
It's simple.

1200
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,030
Ok Mr. Puppeteer.

1201
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:35,410
You do realise that

1202
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:38,490
someone up there is
pulling your strings, right?

1203
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,320
I told you I don't believe in God.

1204
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,200
That's like saying
you don't believe in

1205
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,910
the greatest filmmaker ever.

1206
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:45,780
I mean.

1207
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,120
Think of all the
genres our lives have.

1208
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,070
Romance, comedy, drama, tragedy.

1209
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,820
And lousy scripts, right?

1210
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,620
He definitely needs
a better scriptwriter.

1211
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,660
That's for sure.

1212
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:07,280
Even James Bond doesn't
like this knot, you know.

1213
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,780
And why not?

1214
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,620
Well, he thinks it shows

1215
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,160
too much vanity.

1216
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,700
He mistrusts men

1217
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,700
who tie a Windsor Knot.

1218
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,280
I believe... that vanity works.

1219
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,620
Oh?

1220
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,240
On certain men, at least.

1221
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,590
About the weekend of the 25th.

1222
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,170
I'll book the tickets?

1223
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,800
Yeah? I mean...

1224
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:42,090
25th is so far away.
We'll figure it out in a bit?

1225
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,090
Yeah?

1226
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,380
Yeah.

1227
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:49,010
Sure.

1228
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,340
Aah!

1229
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:51,670
Careful.

1230
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,050
Okay?

1231
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,260
No.

1232
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,840
Come here.

1233
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,630
Vina.

1234
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,970
The one who deflowered me.

1235
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,180
Devoured me.

1236
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,390
And now...

1237
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,050
K!

1238
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:07,640
Now, doesn't even let me
do a dramatic voiceover by myself.

1239
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,260
Enough!

1240
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:12,470
I need to make my own bloody mistakes.

1241
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,470
Even if she doesn't feel like I

1242
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,840
"belong in an office"

1243
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,300
I'm ready.

1244
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:19,930
Am I?

1245
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:21,720
Come.

1246
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,590
I'll interview you.

1247
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,010
Good afternoon.

1248
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,180
Ma'am.

1249
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,220
Good afternoon.

1250
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,640
Please... do have a seat.

1251
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,510
Sorry.

1252
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:51,640
So, you're fresh out of college?

1253
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,640
Yes and raring to go.

1254
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,390
And what makes you think advertising

1255
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:58,970
would be the right fit for you?

1256
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,590
Well, anything to
work under you, Ma'am.

1257
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,410
And you think you're ready
for that kind of pressure?

1258
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,840
Several times a day.

1259
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:14,390
I guarantee it.

1260
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,680
Again.

1261
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,970
What makes you think advertising
is the right fit for you?

1262
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,590
Well, you see I'm very flexible.

1263
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,260
Just try me.

1264
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:31,890
Seriously?

1265
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,590
Why advertising, Mr. K?

1266
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,010
Sorry.

1267
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,340
Advertising...

1268
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,680
Advertising because
I think uh... visually.

1269
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:48,550
I've always been fascinated
by graphic design formats.

1270
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,050
So why not work as an artist
or in a design studio?

1271
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,340
What makes you think...

1272
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,640
Actually, what do you think
advertising is all about?

1273
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,430
Well, I just think that my creativity

1274
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,890
will be better utilised
in a high-pressure setup

1275
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,760
like an agency.

1276
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,930
I've always admired agencies that...

1277
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,140
So is advertising
about selling a product

1278
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,840
or is it about winning an award

1279
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,220
for making some kind of a clever joke?

1280
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:14,840
What's more important to you?

1281
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,470
I...

1282
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,340
I think...

1283
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:27,970
And looking through your portfolio,

1284
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:35,550
I think it's full of nostalgia.

1285
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,550
Why are you so fixated with your past?

1286
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,050
Well, the work in there
is extremely personal.

1287
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,510
And what do you think

1288
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,090
it says about you?

1289
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,180
Here.

1290
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,340
Vina...

1291
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,560
All I'm asking is

1292
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,260
what does it mean for a 22-year-old

1293
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,890
to be so fixated with his past?

1294
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,390
These designs, these sketches...

1295
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,840
But these aren't commercials,
are they?

1296
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,590
This is just to show what I can make

1297
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,050
and in a real office scenario

1298
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,390
I would obviously do it differently.

1299
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,680
You sure you can work with a team?

1300
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,220
Aren't you more of a loner?

1301
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,340
Don't you have trouble
getting close to people?

1302
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,340
Hey, that's...

1303
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:28,840
That's?

1304
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,550
I don't know. I could...

1305
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,800
I could probably...

1306
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,760
lead a team.

1307
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,390
Yes, I could lead a team.

1308
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,430
But when you work
in an office scenario

1309
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,840
you don't lead.

1310
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,930
Can you take orders?

1311
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,840
From someone, you know...

1312
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:00,180
From someone who may just know better?

1313
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,970
I don't see why not.

1314
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,340
You won't let your ego get in the way?

1315
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,930
No.

1316
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,510
I mean...

1317
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,890
I am open to constructive criticism.

1318
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,510
But what if you feel that the
feedback is not constructive?

1319
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,180
Can you take orders from a superior

1320
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,260
you don't respect?

1321
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,090
Can you take orders?

1322
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,220
I think...

1323
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,260
I think I can, Ma'am.

1324
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,590
Hmm? - Yeah.

1325
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,800
Okay.

1326
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,430
What about...

1327
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,220
What about deadlines?

1328
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,970
Oh, I can work through the night

1329
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:49,050
and make sure that deadlines are met.

1330
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,590
So you finish everything last minute?

1331
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,840
Isn't that how it's supposed to work?

1332
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,970
That's how it's forced to work,

1333
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,550
not supposed to work.

1334
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,180
Why can't you just do things on time?

1335
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,180
Vina, I try, I really...

1336
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,390
What do you try?!

1337
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,640
Damn it, do you want this job or not?

1338
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,680
What is trying?

1339
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,890
Be confident!

1340
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,550
Do you want this job?

1341
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:17,300
I think... I don't know... I

1342
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,890
I really don't know, Vina.

1343
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,680
Hey. Hey.

1344
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,340
Look at me...

1345
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,260
look at me!

1346
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:28,600
Ok, I'm sorry.

1347
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,510
I'm sorry.

1348
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,470
I didn't mean to be so harsh, baby!

1349
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,840
Of course, I skipped that interview.

1350
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,390
Vina and I stayed
together for another year.

1351
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,430
Until Calcutta called.

1352
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,180
The tickets for the weekend of the

1353
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,930
25th had already been booked, you see.

1354
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,140
I'm going crazy.

1355
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,340
I've to stop taking those pills.

1356
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:58,510
What happened to you, man?

1357
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,550
What do you mean?

1358
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,180
Your version of Devdas kind of sucked.

1359
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:06,680
Oh! Please...

1360
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,200
It went to many festivals
all over the world.

1361
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,380
In my defence,
I just have to say that

1362
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,640
I don't even remember
making that film.

1363
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:17,970
It just...

1364
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:21,220
No, but seriously...

1365
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,720
What happened to you?

1366
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:26,510
Life happened.

1367
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,930
You know
after a point you realise that

1368
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,010
you've run out of stories.

1369
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,590
You've run out of characters.

1370
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,590
That everybody you meet in life is

1371
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,760
actually the same bloody person.

1372
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,510
You know every storyteller has just
one story to tell.

1373
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,470
And you keep recycling it.

1374
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:47,840
Rehashing it.

1375
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,640
And after a point

1376
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,510
you can't even do that anymore.

1377
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,430
I'm through with this shit.

1378
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,090
I'm finished.

1379
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,590
I'm done.

1380
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,890
You know, maybe you just

1381
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,970
see them the same way.

1382
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:12,760
I've been looking
at that laptop screen

1383
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,640
for six months trying to write.

1384
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,550
Blank.

1385
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,550
Not one word has come out.

1386
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,390
Anyway
why am I telling you all this?

1387
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,930
For all I know,
you don't even exist.

1388
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,180
What?

1389
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,260
You don't have a name.

1390
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,220
You don't have an address.

1391
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,510
You don't have a job.
You don't have a home.

1392
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,090
You don't have a family. - I?

1393
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,300
No, no, no.
Wait, wait...

1394
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,550
You have a mother.

1395
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,720
Her name is Shireen, right?

1396
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,090
And that's somebody I used to know

1397
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,220
twenty years back.

1398
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:55,010
I'm talking to a fictitious girl

1399
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:58,260
in my hotel room

1400
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,640
who is dressed up in a shirt

1401
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,890
just like Vina.

1402
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:05,590
Poof!

1403
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:09,260
Nothing has changed.

1404
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,010
I still need a woman
to take care of me...

1405
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,550
Even if she's imaginary.

1406
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,840
I need her.

1407
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,050
I like this.

1408
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,300
So, now I'm imaginary?

1409
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,300
Mmm-hmm.

1410
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,800
Boy meets imaginary girl.

1411
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,640
Well, that's a new story.

1412
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,680
No, it's not a new story.

1413
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,550
You are not a new story.

1414
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,970
I know who you are.

1415
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:42,340
You are the sum total
of all my stories.

1416
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,970
It's not a coincidence that

1417
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,970
your mother's name is Shireen.

1418
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:53,720
That you take out an eight of hearts.

1419
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,840
That I see you changing.

1420
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:59,090
That you are an Odissi dancer.

1421
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,140
You bring out my worst nightmares.

1422
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,260
Who are you?

1423
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,300
I think...

1424
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,840
Maybe you are asking
the wrong question.

1425
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,090
Really?

1426
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:15,590
I don't think it's important who I am.

1427
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,760
The real question is.

1428
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,260
Who are you?

1429
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:22,510
Me?

1430
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,220
I'm an escape artist.

1431
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,890
That's who I am.

1432
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:34,340
A Dad in the army

1433
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,140
is like a passport to adventure.

1434
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,800
The two of us moved all over the map.

1435
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,470
Well, this time we had moved South.

1436
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,760
And if Ma was still around
she would say

1437
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,340
I was the best looking
guy in those parts.

1438
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,300
Bro.

1439
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,550
Tea.

1440
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:06,680
One tea.

1441
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:25,510
Um, water?

1442
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,260
Water, water.

1443
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,970
Huh?

1444
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,550
Huh?

1445
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:05,930
I didn't quite
understand the language.

1446
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:07,010
Medium size.

1447
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,890
She said what she wanted to say.

1448
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,010
I heard what I wanted to hear.

1449
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,590
Oh! Boy.

1450
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:42,890
Oh! Kishen.

1451
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,590
Kishen!

1452
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:28,090
First time, eh?

1453
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,010
Please, please...

1454
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:34,390
Please.

1455
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,970
Help! No!!

1456
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,510
What was her name?

1457
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:16,840
Bad! You didn't even ask her name?

1458
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,890
I did. I asked her.

1459
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,010
She didn't tell me.

1460
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:20,680
Huh?

1461
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,220
What was her name?

1462
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,510
Aastha.

1463
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:27,220
Aastha (FAITH)?

1464
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:29,930
Alright, ok.

1465
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,050
K, wait.

1466
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:47,220
<i>AASTHA: The Basis
of Life (ON TV)</i>

1467
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,010
I just tried calling you.

1468
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:14,760
Yes, I just got here last evening.

1469
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,800
What are you doing here?

1470
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:18,840
Avoiding you.

1471
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,510
Seriously.

1472
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:22,760
I came for my cousin's wedding.

1473
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,840
You look different.

1474
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:30,340
You say that when
you don't like my haircut.

1475
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:31,760
No, it's nice.

1476
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,260
I miss you.

1477
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:38,640
What else is new?

1478
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:41,340
I mean it.

1479
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,720
I'm sorry.

1480
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:45,970
For what?

1481
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:46,840
For everything.

1482
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:49,180
For giving up on us.

1483
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,300
I'm sorry for not having enough faith.

1484
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:57,260
I'm sorry I kept running away.

1485
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:00,550
You call me out of
the blue every few months...

1486
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,470
Drunk!

1487
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:04,680
And then you just
keep moving on.

1488
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,640
Do I look drunk to you, right now?

1489
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,800
What do you want?

1490
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,340
I want you. I want us.

1491
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:13,010
That's all. Enough.

1492
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,970
I want us to be together.

1493
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:16,470
Even if we are fighting.

1494
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,760
We've had this conversation before.

1495
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,090
I'm done moving on.

1496
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,180
I've just been running all my life.

1497
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,590
Enough, no more.

1498
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,390
I'm going home.
And waiting for you.

1499
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,640
Even if you don't come back.

1500
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:38,300
I still love you.

1501
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,180
And I hate it that I still do.

1502
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:45,300
What exactly makes you think

1503
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:47,640
that I'll drop everything
and come back to you?

1504
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,050
I don't know.

1505
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,840
Faith...

1506
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:53,720
Or something like that.

1507
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,050
There's no such thing as
half a leap of faith.

1508
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,010
You either jump...

1509
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,590
Or you don't.

1510
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:03,890
You know why I couldn't move on?

1511
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,140
Because I'll never stop loving you.

1512
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:09,760
But you'll always remain as you are,

1513
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,090
who you are...

1514
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,680
A man with no address.

1515
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,180
You're a nomad. A drifter.

1516
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:20,640
And there are some things
I chose to accept about myself.

1517
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,300
I think you should do the same.

1518
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,140
So?

1519
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:49,640
You ran away.

1520
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:55,010
Sorry, I just freaked out.

1521
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:58,090
So did I, actually.

1522
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:01,090
Angry?

1523
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,640
Me?
No, not at all.

1524
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,340
So call me?

1525
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,680
Frankly...

1526
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,340
No.

1527
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:18,010
Why not?

1528
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,930
Is it because I'm too young?

1529
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,390
Also that.

1530
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,010
No, I just - Is it because I left?

1531
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:29,390
No. Please.

1532
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,800
Can I drop you somewhere?

1533
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:37,680
You just did.

1534
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:41,550
I didn't mean it like that.

1535
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,800
Say Hi to Mom.

1536
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:48,180
That's my Mom.

1537
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,760
She's from Delhi.

1538
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:51,800
Is she your Shireen?

1539
01:32:58,410 --> 01:32:59,590
Keep guessing.

1540
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:03,300
Shall we?

1541
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:10,140
Umm... write something for me?

1542
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:16,180
What shall I write for you?

1543
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,010
I almost forgot.

1544
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:20,890
What?

1545
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,470
I got you this.

1546
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:25,090
Another watch?

1547
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,680
How is it better
than the Rolex you gave me last night?

1548
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,970
This
is a time machine.

1549
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,550
Oh is it? - Mm-hmm!

1550
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:35,970
How does it work?

1551
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,050
You just adjust the year, month, time

1552
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:43,760
and close your eyes

1553
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:46,970
and you think about the person
you really want to meet...

1554
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,300
and Boom!

1555
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,390
You're there.

1556
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:50,970
Wow!

1557
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:52,260
Have you tried it?

1558
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:54,510
Oh yeah!

1559
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:55,510
Does it work?

1560
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,010
If you believe.

1561
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:03,500
Remember me?

1562
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,760
I'm sorry I ran away.

1563
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,220
That day.

1564
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,640
I was young.

1565
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,930
I understand.

1566
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:45,880
English?

1567
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,550
Yes.

1568
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:50,590
Learning.

1569
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:28,680
Dead body.

1570
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:29,430
Help?

1571
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:30,140
Help!

1572
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,140
Dead body.

1573
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:01,050
Do you believe in God?

1574
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:03,220
In science?

1575
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:05,090
Time travel?

1576
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:17,770
What do you do now?

1577
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,650
What did you do with

1578
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:22,370
the body?

1579
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:27,880
Biryani.

1580
01:40:27,904 --> 01:40:43,904
