2
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,611
There is one god.
His name is truth.

3
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,105
He is the Creator.

4
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,649
He fears none, He is without hate.

5
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,812
He never dies. He is beyond
the cycle of births and death.

6
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,386
He is self-illuminated.

7
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,726
He is realized by the
kindness of the True Guru.

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,494
He was True in the beginning.

9
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,465
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

10
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:07,733
He is also True now.

11
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:14,274
"Seek His refuge and find the shore."

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,007
"You won't be taking anything along."

13
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,710
"You won't be taking anything along."

14
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,151
"You will be leaving everything
behind in this world."

15
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:28,751
"Seek His refuge and find the shore."

16
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,562
"You won't be taking anything along."

17
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,394
"You won't be taking anything along."

18
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,663
"You will be leaving everything
behind in this world."

19
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,433
"Forgive my sins, o generous one."

20
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,773
"I plead to you."

21
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:52,043
"My lord is unique and incomparable."

22
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,709
"I am in awe of him."

23
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:59,352
"My lord is unique and incomparable."

24
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,552
"I am in awe of him."

25
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:08,360
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

26
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:14,301
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

27
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,304
"He knows everyone."

28
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,173
"Some are princes
and some are pauper."

29
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:29,011
"He is our creator."

30
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:34,385
"He is the one who does everything."
"He helps us get across."

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,585
"I am in awe of him."

32
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:43,192
"My lord is unique and incomparable."

33
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,032
"I am in awe of him."

34
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:50,470
"My lord is unique and incomparable."

35
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,340
"I am in awe of him."

36
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:58,815
Bani!

37
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,510
Bani..

38
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,118
Where are you going with this bag'?

39
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,381
No one can leave this house with
even soil without your permission.

40
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,157
So what can I take with me?

41
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,222
From where did you
learn to say such things?

42
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,321
Keeping quiet didn't
help me either, mother.

43
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,721
Give me your blessings.

44
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,198
You will get my blessings.

45
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,667
But first,
tell me, where are you going?

46
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,433
I got transferred.

47
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,367
Jainti Majri.

48
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,105
It's close to Chandigarh.

49
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,472
You didn't tell me.

50
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,046
Since a long time,
no one has asked me anything either.

51
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,013
And then..

52
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,653
You don't ask, you just tell.

53
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,118
Bye.

54
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,690
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

55
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:24,597
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

56
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:30,502
"What do I tell you
about His greatness."

57
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:39,309
"He is the one who makes
a pauper flourish."

58
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:45,047
"He helps us get across."

59
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:48,751
"I am in awe of him."

60
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,531
"My lord is unique and incomparable."

61
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,361
"I am in awe of him."

62
00:05:55,555 --> 00:06:00,971
"My lord is unique and incomparable."

63
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,201
"I am in awe of him."

64
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:10,080
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

65
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:15,976
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

66
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,654
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

67
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,457
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

68
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,520
Where's the school?

69
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,998
Straight ahead. - Thank you.

70
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,557
Is he the new teacher?

71
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,629
Now one more person to deliver
letters to in our village.

72
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:43,404
I found it! I found it!

73
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,552
Snake's scooter was found!

74
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,092
If you are joining under
me you should know that no means no.

75
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,355
I don't take leaves.

76
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,989
And I don't let anyone
go without a leave.

77
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,430
Amazing. Very good, sir.

78
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,991
Kids, go back to your class.
- Okay, sir.

79
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,126
I too am just like you.

80
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,433
I am even happy to
be in school on a Sunday.

81
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,003
I will be coming to school on Sundays.

82
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,474
You see if you can make arrangements.

83
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,102
Let's forget about this.

84
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,745
I have arranged for your
stay at Subedar's house.

85
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,413
Including the electricity charges
around 2500.. - Bhullar sir..

86
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,576
How many states are
there in India now?

87
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,210
You are acting funny now, Neetu madam.

88
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,221
You have the Google Auntie with you.
Ask her.

89
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,548
Madam, there are 29 states
and 7 union territories.

90
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,988
Get going now. - Okay.

91
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,025
It was not right for
you to be the Google Uncle.

92
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,064
Sir, when will you be taking
your share of the stock today?

93
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,064
Before the midday meal or after it?

94
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,063
What stocks?

95
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,294
Go and do your job.

96
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,335
Go and cook.

97
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,396
Hello, new sir. - Hello, madam.

98
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,373
Go on. Bye.

99
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,474
Sir, please tell me,
which class will I be teaching today?

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,673
Don't bother, sir.
It's your first day. No classes today.

101
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,146
You will be teaching
the whole year around.

102
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,743
You should go and rest.

103
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,508
Get out of the gate,
go left and ask for Subedar's house.

104
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,350
But before that.

105
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,320
One selfie is a must for the Facebook.

106
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,587
Status: Feeling delightful
with new colleague.

107
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,183
Smile please.

108
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,087
Rs. 50.70, Nathu Bhanoo.

109
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,121
Rs. 5, Charna flower-man.

110
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,260
Rs. 16, Karmi..

111
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,633
Yes, sir. What do you want'?

112
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,399
Just your sweet smile
and half a minute of your time.

113
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,598
Sure, of course.

114
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,172
You are a sweet talker.

115
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,502
Do you work in the sugar mill?

116
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:59,311
Almighty has a sugar
mill planted on my tongue.

117
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,280
How are you, buddy?

118
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,447
Make sure you come
back on time and alive!

119
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,955
"The winds.."

120
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,086
Shambhu Nath, where's Subedar's house?

121
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,524
You want to go to
Subedar's house? - Yes.

122
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,327
I'll tell you.

123
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,167
Master, take a right from here.
On the left, second house is his.

124
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,261
<i>Okay-</i>

125
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,471
Shambhu Nath.. - Yes'?

126
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,266
How do you know that I am a teacher?

127
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,705
The first one also
stayed at Subedar's house.

128
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,546
He too chiseled me.

129
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,344
He still owes me Rs. 27.

130
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,247
It's not a big amount.
It's just a fact.

131
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,347
Add that amount to my account.

132
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,020
He is very generous.

133
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,258
Binder, the teacher is here.

134
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,660
Supply water to him.

135
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,360
Just one glass.

136
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,994
I hate wasting water.
- Okay.

137
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,505
I hope you didn't have
any trouble finding my house.

138
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,101
No. Your own village is like a GPS.

139
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,678
Everyone gives the
right directions. - Yes.

140
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,513
Thank you.

141
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,315
She is my daughter, Binder.

142
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,414
I have a grandson.

143
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,217
His name is Mithu.

144
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,585
He keeps me busy.

145
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,221
He studies in your school.
- Okay.

146
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,100
Climb up the stairs.
This is your upper-porch.

147
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,226
Okay. Thank you, Subedar.

148
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,465
Binder, make tea for him.

149
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:03,430
"Guru Nanak's words
give you happiness."

150
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:09,702
"Guru Nanak's words
give you happiness."

151
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:16,382
"Guru Nanak's words
give you happiness."

152
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,218
Hello.

153
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,720
Good morning, Gurmukh.

154
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,286
Good morning, Bani.
Good morning.

155
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,720
Here's the offerings.

156
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,395
Give it to me.

157
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,201
Cover your head, Gurmukh.

158
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,564
Oh. Sorry.

159
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:39,042
Bani, I am Gurmukh only for namesake.

160
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,312
You are the one who is one
with him in action as well as words.

161
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,809
Oh my-

162
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,210
You have given me such respect.

163
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,746
I don't need to eat anything today.

164
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,411
Your love has sated me.

165
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,190
You now need to eat for two.

166
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,190
I don't want you both mother
and son to lack nutrition.

167
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,699
You too said mother and son..

168
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,165
You too want me to have a son.

169
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,097
You are a fool.

170
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,770
It was just a slip of tongue.

171
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,579
I want our child
to be a girl or a boy.

172
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,152
I don't want you to give
birth to a chick or a calf.

173
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,711
You scared me.

174
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,225
I thought you too
like mother want a son..

175
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,222
She says it every day.

176
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,486
"I want a grandson."

177
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,394
She just says it.
Don't think too much into it.

178
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,127
You know how old hags are.

179
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,770
Actually, my elder brother
also has three daughters.

180
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,767
Hence, she wants to have
a grandson in the family.

181
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,040
<i>Okay-</i>

182
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,643
So, what if she gets
another granddaughter?

183
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,306
Her granddaughter
will be beautiful Jyoti.

184
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,312
If we have a daughter,
we will name her Jyoti.

185
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,285
She too like you will
turn darkness into light.

186
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,284
No.

187
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,318
Yes.

188
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,594
No.
- Master.

189
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,433
What happened? Did you doze off'?

190
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,229
No.

191
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,068
A memory came back to haunt me.

192
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:23,509
Could you speak louder?
I don't like low sound discipline.

193
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,714
What I said was you did a
great thing by breaking tea for me.

194
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,057
It is troublesome for you.
- No. It's okay.

195
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,550
Once you start meaning tea..

196
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:41,555
...l'll stand at your door every
day with an empty glass in my hand.

197
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,567
I am not shy.

198
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,565
By the way,
what is your caste and lineage?

199
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,066
I am a Sikh by caste.

200
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,509
I am a Singh by lineage.

201
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:59,414
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

202
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:04,716
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

203
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,650
"He knows everyone."

204
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,250
"Some are princes
and some are pauper."

205
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,024
'Oh Lord,
please ignore my faults and defects.'

206
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,488
'Help me live in humanity
but with high values.'

207
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,137
'Give me the strength to
support the weak and the helpless.'

208
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,698
'Oh Lord Almighty.'

209
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:31,545
"Chant the name, say almighty lord."

210
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,783
I cannot see a single
person in the village.

211
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,161
Does a curfew take
place in the evenings here?

212
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,389
Where is everyone?

213
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:51,159
Here are the important
people of this country.

214
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,633
Hanger, where are you hanging'?

215
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,237
You guys also seem to
be fed up of your families..

216
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,177
...because I see all
of you here every day.

217
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,580
Go for your schemes, Hanger.

218
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,246
Hello, Master.

219
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,156
Hello.
- I am Lottery.

220
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,385
Personal postman of this village.

221
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,655
And what is your real name?

222
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,587
Why?

223
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,131
I got the duty of counting people
who go to relieve themselves at dawn.

224
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,067
And to meet those who
get drunk in the evening.

225
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,162
Duty'? One duty comes out of another.

226
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,336
One duty says, you should complete me.

227
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,036
The other says,
I will die without you.

228
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,602
The third duty sends
a different friend request.

229
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:37,707
Hanger. - Yes'?

230
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,212
I think he came here drunk.

231
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,253
It's okay. We will get
him a little more drunk here.

232
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,310
What should I get for you'?

233
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:48,085
I neither drink nor
do I offer drinks to anyone.

234
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,124
Then why did you come here?
To light candles?

235
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,322
I actually went to the Gurudwara.

236
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,520
I couldn't find anyone there.

237
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,089
You must be wondering what happened.

238
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,635
I didn't bite anyone.

239
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,069
Not you, Snake.

240
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:06,367
Actually, I cannot kill time
without meeting and talking to people.

241
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,174
So I kept walking.
I saw many people here so I came here.

242
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,315
Villagers go to the
Gurudwara only occasionally.

243
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:20,420
Some watch TV and others
like Lottery come here.

244
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,150
Cheers.

245
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,160
Then give me a cup of tea. - Tea'?

246
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,462
We neither drink
it nor do we serve it.

247
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,532
There is no tea here.
- It's not here.

248
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,567
Yesterday someone stole my scooter.

249
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,103
And look,
today someone stole my cycle.

250
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,364
I got robbed.

251
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:40,308
Go home, Snake.
I'll find it for you.

252
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,539
But it will cost you Rs. 100.

253
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:46,114
Okay. Find it for me, okay'?
- Okay. <i>I'll</i> find it.

254
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:50,311
Let me take my slippers or
someone will steal them as well.

255
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:55,189
Yes, take them with you or
someone might steal them. - Well done.

256
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,690
First, you got his things stolen.

257
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,588
And then you charge
him high fees to find it.

258
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,523
Nice. Very nice.

259
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,399
Okay then bye. - Bye.

260
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,062
Bye.

261
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,102
Lottery, what did he say'?

262
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,672
He says that the 100
rupees fee is not adequate.

263
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,109
You should increase the rate.

264
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,092
Okay. Thank you.

265
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,287
Okay. Thank you.

266
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,294
Enough.

267
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,659
Enough.

268
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,697
He)'-

269
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,055
He)'-

270
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,358
Naughty-

271
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,730
Naughty-

272
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,203
Sir! The vegetable market is on fire.

273
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,572
What happened?
A lot of things got damaged?

274
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,747
Not that fire, the inflation.

275
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,747
Spare me, madam.

276
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,750
What's this noise all about?

277
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,346
Where is your teacher?

278
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,388
Sit down.

279
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,615
Here he is.

280
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,194
How are you, Gurmukh?

281
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,331
You are sitting on the ground'?
Is everything alright?

282
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,167
Bhullar, God said,
the more closer to ground the better.

283
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,262
So, I sometimes listen to Him.

284
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,270
Offer Sir, papa has brought
cheap bottle from Chandigarh.

285
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,604
You can collect it.

286
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:20,738
Shut up.

287
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,146
I'll go and collect
flour from the mill.

288
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,211
In the meanwhile
you can play with them.

289
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,442
I'll be back in a jiffy.

290
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,041
Okay. - Okay? Take care.

291
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,246
Hey, what did you mean by Offer Sir'?

292
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,054
Sir, he always grabs good offers.

293
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,424
Never give nicknames to your teachers.

294
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,463
Okay? - Sir,
they don't have proper names either.

295
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,496
He is Petrol.

296
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,532
He is Troublesome.
And he is Fuse.

297
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:48,599
Madam, if something is wrong
we as teachers should correct it.

298
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,337
If these kids don't
know each others name.

299
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,767
How will they know about
Bhai Jaita-ji, Bhai Taru-ji.

300
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,343
Bhai Matidas, Bhai Satidas,
Bhai Kanhaiya-ji, Banda Bahadur..

301
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,474
Hari Singh Nalua, Maharaja
Ranjeet Singh, Diwan Todar Mal..

302
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,644
And Pir Buddhu Shah.

303
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,982
So ma'am, you need to learn to teach.

304
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,690
True learning induces in the mind,
service to mankind.

305
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,222
What?
What was that?

306
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,726
Kids, these were the
words said by Guru Nanak.

307
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:21,529
Gurbani guides us to the right path.

308
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:27,510
And if you pray from your heart,
your wishes come true.

309
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,978
Really? You get what you wish for'?

310
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,707
If you ask from the bottom
of your heart, you'll get it.

311
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,715
Sir, if I pray that we are
not taught mathematics, will it work'?

312
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,188
Why pray for mathematics
not being taught?

313
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,989
Why not pray for his help
in understanding mathematics?

314
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,761
This is the problem.

315
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,362
We don't know what to ask for.

316
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,662
Kid, why are you so quiet?

317
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,069
You didn't play properly either.

318
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,573
You don't talk much with anyone.

319
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,764
What is your name?

320
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,600
Sir, her name is Fuse.
What will she say'?

321
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,206
You seem to be over powered.
You never shut up.

322
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,473
That's why we call him Petrol.

323
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,053
What is your name?

324
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,148
Jyoti.

325
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,059
'Her granddaughter
will be beautiful Jyoti.'

326
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:21,025
'If we have a daughter,
we will name her Jyoti.'

327
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,063
It's a beautiful name, dear.

328
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,397
Jyoti means light.

329
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,267
Brightness.

330
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,600
You will make the darkness go away,
my child.

331
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,515
Sir, from when can I start praying?

332
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,649
What do you want to pray for'?

333
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,717
It's a secret.

334
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,785
A devotee is not bounded by time.

335
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:55,187
Son, if we wait for a
special time to pray or study..

336
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,597
...then it will never happen.

337
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,329
Tomorrows work do today,
today's work now.

338
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,033
If the moment is lost,
the work be done how.

339
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,737
Basmati Rice, black pepper..

340
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,171
Baithi.
- Yes'?

341
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,712
Measure these and give them to him.
- Okay.

342
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,342
Well done, sir.

343
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,009
This is the first time someone
has given a list in Gurmukhi.

344
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,746
Even those who flunked the
fifth grade give the list in English.

345
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,316
Stop taunting.

346
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,047
You are making fun of me?

347
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,558
Flunked the fifth grade!

348
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,393
Now even people like you
have started making fun of date.

349
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,521
A wrong number.

350
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,499
I wasn't talking about you, Sohi sir.

351
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,263
It's just a fact.

352
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,701
What sir?
Did I ask for pounds from you'?

353
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,068
Do you know whom you
should address as sir?

354
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,302
God makes them in special quota.

355
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,399
Let me talk to him, Shambhu.

356
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,808
You are right, gentleman.

357
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,476
What is right? And who is a gentleman?

358
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,608
Bank employees keep coming
home and ruin our reputation.

359
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,213
He had taken a loan
for his daughter's marriage.

360
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,482
His neighbor said he
will give his daughter a car.

361
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,217
Now if the neighbor
gives a helicopter..

362
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,589
...will you give your
daughter an airplane?

363
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,227
Don't get angry, it's a fact.

364
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,231
Do one thing. Also tell him
that my son's marriage was called off.

365
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,528
If you are still not satisfied,
then beat a drum and say it.

366
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,536
Or go to the Gurudwara
and make an announcement.

367
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,765
Okay?

368
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,302
Yes?

369
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,299
Hello? Speak.

370
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,573
I am pull Bodiram's hair.

371
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,235
After I come home,
I'll pull your hair.

372
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,708
Are you waiting to see
my face to break your fast'?

373
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,082
You don't let me go out of the house.

374
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,641
Oh Goddess, such a big wrong number?

375
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,276
Don't get angry, it's a fact.

376
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,113
What's the case with him'?

377
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,452
It's a bad case.

378
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,717
I already told you about the loan.

379
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,317
His son was engaged to..

380
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,556
...Shamsher Singh Brar's daughter
from the neighboring village.

381
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,787
Earlier he too had
same land as he does.

382
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,724
Later, he dialed the right number.

383
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,361
He sold drugs and earned black money.

384
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,562
He then called off the engagement.

385
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:46,233
Well, you can assume that Mr.
Sohi has always dialed wrong numbers.

386
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,208
Here.

387
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,111
Nanak, the whole world is sad.

388
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,774
How much do I owe you'? - Rs. 235.

389
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,607
You can pay me later.
I'll note it down.

390
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,413
No. You have written on that board,
"Cash today, Credit tomorrow."

391
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,989
No one follows what's
written these days'?

392
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,490
One should follow
what's written.. - Here.

393
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,154
Be it in Bhagavad-Gita or Granth Sahib.
- Yes.

394
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,627
One should follow it.

395
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,000
You owe me Rs. 15 now.

396
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,558
It's okay.
You note it down in your books.

397
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,429
It's okay.
- How about a selfie?

398
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,405
I'll upload it on Facebook.

399
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:27,444
After Snake found his cycle..
with Hanger, excited feeling.

400
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,282
I uploaded it on Facebook.
- I got my cycle back.

401
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,654
Praise to Hanger and Lottery.

402
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,656
What's in that bag'?

403
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,184
Fish for wife.

404
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,723
Fish for sister-in-law.

405
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,100
Fish for sister-in-law.

406
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,801
Very good. Very nice. - Give me a hug.

407
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,401
My very good friend. Snake. - Snake.

408
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,461
Have a seat.

409
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,701
Give him a glass.

410
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,407
"There are just two
things a Jet needs."

411
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,468
Jat wants to hang himself.

412
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,313
Jat wants to peace.

413
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,649
Jat wants a decent death.

414
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:08,721
Now it's either the bank or me. - Yes.

415
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,560
They want to take away my tractor.

416
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,254
I challenge them to touch it. - Yes.

417
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,594
I will make the ministers
in Delhi quiver in fear.

418
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,632
Hanger, get me a cup of tea.
- I'm getting it.

419
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,665
Tea'? Over here?

420
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,099
Sohi, I had given them the things
needed for making tea in the morning.

421
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,610
Sohi.. Go ahead.

422
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,373
Go ahead and add insult to my injury.

423
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,015
God has given me a bad fate.

424
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,346
How can God have time
to write everyone's fate?

425
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:44,616
Our work and our decisions decide
the tragedy and laughter in our life.

426
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,230
Tea. Here. - Thank you.

427
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,027
Cheers. - It's okay.

428
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:50,759
No problem.

429
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,194
Lottery. .

430
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,769
You are wasting your
government salary.

431
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,306
No one write letters these days.

432
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,241
Instead,
there are more letters nowadays.

433
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,271
Electricity bill,
water bill, phone bills.

434
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,547
Insurance letters, bank letters.

435
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,350
Down with the bank!

436
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,515
Burn all the bank letters!

437
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,490
Stop it, uncle.

438
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,290
We are discussing
something personal her.

439
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,360
Come here, Master.

440
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,292
Another letter comes.

441
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:29,064
It's addressed to God.

442
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,632
There is no sender's address.

443
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,040
To God?

444
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,113
Really? What do you
do with that letter?

445
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,049
What can I do'? I stack them on a side.

446
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,249
You never read the letter
to find out what's written in it?

447
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,053
I am a very honest person.

448
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,651
I don't do wrong things.

449
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,196
Someone has done it again.

450
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,300
Someone stole my fish.

451
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:02,202
Look, someone steals from me everyday.

452
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,069
We will find it. - You Scoundrels.

453
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,540
I will not spare you. - Sit down.

454
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,100
I am listening about your
honesty from quite some time.

455
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,105
You and Hanger should
stop cheating Snake.

456
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:13,675
Bye.

457
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,455
What do you mean? Explain..

458
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,991
I don't understand.
- What did the teacher say'?

459
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,687
Tell him.

460
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:28,561
He says increase the fees
you charge Snake to find his things.

461
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,730
Otherwise, Snake won't mend his ways.

462
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,760
Really?
- Yes.

463
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,062
I think he stole it. - Yes.

464
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,003
Yes.

465
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,163
<i>Okay-</i>

466
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,209
Master!

467
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,471
You ate my wife's fish!

468
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,427
Who is causing this Windstorm?

469
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,187
Sir, that was Shamsher Brar.
The drug dealer.

470
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,004
I'll read it, father.

471
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,999
Dheela, what's the
use of reading it anyway?

472
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,268
You don't want to do any work.

473
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,341
All of them are lazy.

474
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,639
Son..

475
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,978
I have been waiting
for you since last night.

476
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,276
Where were you'?

477
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,647
I am Shamsher Brar.

478
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,585
I am not a toddler.

479
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,382
And it is not important
for me to tell you everything.

480
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,990
Pinkie.

481
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,422
Pinkie.

482
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,527
Dad, my name is Pinku.

483
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,300
I am your father.
I can call you anything.

484
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,694
You didn't go to college today.

485
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,573
My friend had kept a party last night.

486
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,770
I had gone there.

487
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,641
When I returned,
grandpa started with his questions..

488
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,508
"Where did you go'? Who were you with?
When did you return?"

489
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,670
"Where is your father?"

490
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,644
This is how all old men are.

491
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,008
What's your program for the day'?

492
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,019
I have to go to college.

493
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,248
College won't be paying you.

494
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:05,224
Get ready.
We need to make a delivery today.

495
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,227
<i>Okay-</i>

496
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:07,691
Where's Mannat?

497
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,559
She has gone to college, dad.

498
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,468
Mannat? Are you awake?

499
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,467
Because of you, I don't
sleep even when I am supposed to.

500
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,140
Oh. What a dialogue!

501
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,308
What is this?
You bring me here every other day.

502
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,016
You idiot, in a romantic movies..

503
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,351
...some locations are repeated.
You don't know about it.

504
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,088
Don't be a hero.

505
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,156
The day my father
or Pinku learns that..

506
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,454
...l bunk college and meet you here..

507
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,286
...they will end our movie here itself.

508
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,499
Have you come here to talk heart
to heart or to give me a heart attack?

509
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,369
I am your father's
personal son-in-law, okay'?

510
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,596
You aren't. You were.

511
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,639
Our engagement was called off.

512
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,043
If you really wish to get married..

513
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,371
Then be something.

514
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,606
You want me to become an airplane?

515
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,111
I am talking to a few companies.

516
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,012
Soon my CD will be released.

517
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,343
Then everyone will
talk about Assi Sohi.

518
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,251
I will have shows every day.
You just wait and watch.

519
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,384
Then you will have a lot of money.

520
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,256
Yes. Then I will pay
back my fathers loans.

521
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,061
Then you can even convince
my father for our marriage.

522
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,565
Yes. - We will send our
children to a school in Kasuli.

523
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,632
Yes. Confirmed.

524
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,630
Okay, you are smiling.
You are making fun of me?

525
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,541
This is not how it is done.

526
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,241
Teach me to copy then.

527
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,973
I give up. Stop it.

528
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,273
Don't blabbering.

529
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,181
When I pass through your house,
you don't get out of your house.

530
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,152
Don't pass through my house.

531
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,546
You can see me as much
as you want here itself.

532
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,555
Okay, so now do one thing.

533
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:43,049
Don't close your eyes.

534
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,449
I'll keep looking
at you for two hours.

535
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,427
"L have always had a royal style."

536
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,198
"I have always decorated
my turban well."

537
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,139
"I have always had a royal style."

538
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,109
"I have always decorated
my turban well."

539
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,142
"You too have always
been crazy about me."

540
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,046
"Beautiful,
this is what your eyes tell me."

541
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,018
"You too have always
been crazy about me."

542
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,748
"Beautiful,
this is what your eyes tell me."

543
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,719
"There are many more boys after me."

544
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,660
"There are many more boys after me."

545
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:24,097
"They don't get tired."

546
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,102
"It was your turban that
stole my heart away, handsome."

547
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,037
"It was your turban that
stole my heart away, handsome."

548
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:34,167
"It was your turban that
stole my heart away, handsome."

549
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,488
"I have fulfilled
all my other desires."

550
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,323
"Now I have just one dream."

551
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,387
"I want you sitting in my courtyard."

552
00:30:55,453 --> 00:31:01,165
"And telling me how your day went."

553
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,139
"I wish to get married soon."

554
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,074
"Get ready to sit in the palanquin."

555
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,737
"You too have always
been crazy about me."

556
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,641
"Beautiful,
this is what your eyes tell me."

557
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,746
"You too have always
been crazy about me."

558
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,544
"Beautiful,
this is what your eyes tell me."

559
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,489
"I feel scared,
oh handsome turbaned man."

560
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,355
"I feel scared."

561
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,519
"I feel scared,
oh handsome turbaned man."

562
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,759
"I think twice before I say anything."

563
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,432
"You should read it in my eyes."

564
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,729
"I won't be saying it in words."

565
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,326
"You should read it in my eyes."

566
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,666
"I won't be saying it in words."

567
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,263
"You should read it in my eyes."

568
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:41,276
"I won't be saying it in words."

569
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,007
Sohi, you shouldn't dial
the wrong number with the officials.

570
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,773
They won't be breaking it apart.

571
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,273
They will just park it in the bank.

572
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,579
Don't get angry. It's a fact.

573
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,612
How can they take my tractor.
These bankers. - Keep quiet.

574
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,746
Stop blabbering.

575
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,291
Sohi's son is here.
Assi. - Thank God he is here.

576
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,795
Come here. - His son is here.

577
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,620
Now he is say something sensible.

578
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,158
What the hell, Scoundrels!

579
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,529
You keep showing up at
the door like a stray dog.

580
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,999
We have only taken
a loan from the bank.

581
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,635
The bank hasn't bought us.

582
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:08,602
Get this straight, Sandhu.

583
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,004
I'll break the bones of the one
who tries to take the tractor away.

584
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,372
Mind your language, son.

585
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,274
Your name is Agyapal.
And you keep barking orders.

586
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,606
Come on, Mr. Gupta, start the tractor.

587
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,411
Subedar, talk to them.

588
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,577
Brother,
you should hear us out as well.

589
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,679
Give them a week's time.

590
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,554
His son is still a child.

591
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,456
I will break his bones.

592
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,653
Assi!
- What makes you think I am a child'?

593
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,696
Subedar! My son is brave.

594
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,463
Who are you saying is a child'?
What do you think of yourself'?

595
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,467
Look, we are government officials.

596
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,037
We just follow orders.

597
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,171
We don't like taking
away anyone's thing either.

598
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,730
Thing! It's not a chocolate!

599
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,642
It's my tractor!

600
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,736
I will die, but I won't
let you take my tractor with you.

601
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,344
Why die, son'? Hit him.

602
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,646
Sohi, this isn't
about any enmity or ego.

603
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,278
You will have to pay the government
its money back. - Yes.

604
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,482
But Master.
- Wait.

605
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:07,226
I request you, either let us
villagers talk or both of you talk.

606
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,996
Look, we can only make a request.

607
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,727
We cannot stop you
from doing your duty.

608
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,164
Master, these are official letters.
There no use of stamping them.

609
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:23,404
I request you, if possible,
then for us villagers' sake. - Yes.

610
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,308
You are right.

611
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,109
But they don't have any
manners to talk to anyone. - Okay.

612
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,610
If they are not talking
in a proper tone..

613
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,247
Then at least you can
do something good for them.

614
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,681
Farida, do good for the bad.

615
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,627
Do not fill your mind with anger.

616
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,063
Our body shall not
suffer from any disease..

617
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,528
...and you shall obtain everything.

618
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,129
Okay. We will do as you say.

619
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,361
But let me tell you,
we are giving them just one week.

620
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:51,703
If they don't pay the installments
we will take the tractor.

621
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:52,798
Let's go, Mr. Sandhu.

622
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,236
Thank you very much.
- Do one thing.

623
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,412
Don't come after a week.
Come after four months. - Sohi..

624
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,572
My stand shall remain the same.
- Sohi..

625
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,616
No matter what your stand is,
the tractor will stand in the bank.

626
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,675
Get angry if you want to.
It's a fact. - Bodi...!

627
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,282
Don't make me hit you.

628
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,594
Binder sister.. - Yes, brother'?

629
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,600
You make amazing tea.

630
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,400
So'?

631
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,730
I am just telling you.

632
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,475
You make amazing tea.

633
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,408
I will make you some tea.

634
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,638
But you should reduce
your intake of tea.

635
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,447
You should drink warm water instead.

636
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,108
I will make you some tea.

637
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,014
But you should reduce
your intake of tea.

638
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,122
You should drink warm water instead.

639
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,256
Stop ordering her around.

640
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,054
She never takes rest.

641
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:50,062
Bani, I have asked you
not to wash any clothes.

642
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,532
You are carrying my grandson.

643
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,671
My grandson.
Come on, dear. Take some rest.

644
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,636
I have already decided
my grandson's name.'

645
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,006
Kultar. He will make his family proud.

646
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
I have made a pledge
at the fakir's place.

647
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,975
And I have also offered
food at the Saint's place.

648
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,686
Any child is a God's blessing.

649
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,354
A child is after all a child.

650
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,287
To hell with that.

651
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,985
You are the one who is
going to give birth, right?

652
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,995
I gave birth to two strong men.

653
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,195
I didn't even think about girls.

654
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,626
I thought about boys
and gave birth to boys.

655
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,225
Why are you standing up there?

656
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,564
Your father died
waiting for a grandson.

657
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,596
But I won't die until
I play with my grandson.

658
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,007
Tell her..

659
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,342
Speak up, Gurmukh.

660
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,337
Gurmukh..

661
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,481
Gurmukh..

662
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,113
A penny for your thoughts.

663
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,449
Should I bring the tea
upstairs or are you coming down?

664
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,687
I am coming down.

665
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,250
You should eat dinner with us today.

666
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,349
Binder has made greens. - Okay.

667
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:55,053
And at time do we get together?

668
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,723
I won't be able to ever forget Bani.

669
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,564
What? What did you say'?

670
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,064
I said, I'll eat it.

671
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,970
Oh Lord Almighty.

672
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,210
To Lord Almighty.

673
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,274
Who writes them?

674
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,480
Who is my enemy'?

675
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,579
Lottery,
this letter is not meant for you.

676
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,419
No.

677
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,984
It is wrong to read anyone's letter.

678
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,527
Father. - Yes'?

679
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,762
Tell me, what should I do'?
- Go to sleep.

680
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,263
What? - Go to sleep.

681
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,134
<i>Okay-</i>

682
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,037
<i>okay-</i>

683
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,100
Good night.

684
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,650
To Lord Almighty.
I wonder who writes these letters.

685
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,784
Lottery, go to sleep or
I will come down and thrash you.

686
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,215
I am sleeping.

687
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,657
Did Gurmukh work in the
transport department earlier?

688
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:58,589
Why'? What happened?

689
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:03,623
Look, he sometimes becomes
a train and a bus sometimes.

690
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,029
What is he, Neetu madam?

691
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,369
Bhullar sir, I think he is mental.

692
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,532
Sir.. we are using
more grains nowadays.

693
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,011
From the time this new sir has come,
more students are attending school.

694
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,207
You should take less stock home now.
- Well done. Train, go ahead.

695
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,477
Can't you keep your voice down?

696
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,210
Take less stock home!

697
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,585
Madam, I'm going to the crossroads.

698
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,385
I'll be right back.

699
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,153
Until them,
you keep giving signals to the train.

700
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,518
Take less stock!

701
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,523
Bye. Now he will
be back only for lunch.

702
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,464
Enough. Enough.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

703
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,204
Kids, I know tomorrow
is a Sunday. Okay.

704
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,535
It's a holiday.

705
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,269
But all of you have to
spare a few hours for the garden.

706
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,307
Will all of you come?

707
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,107
We won't be coming, sir.

708
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,008
Why?

709
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,673
This is a fair tomorrow, sir. - So'?

710
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,144
The whole village attends it, sir.

711
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,342
The whole village attends it?

712
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,647
Yes.

713
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,984
Then why shouldn't you go'?
All of you should also go.

714
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,353
Thank you, sir.

715
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,120
Sir, I will come to school.

716
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,661
Why, son'?
Don't you want to go to the fair?

717
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,591
Who will he go with?

718
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,428
His mother stays quiet.

719
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,195
His father left them.

720
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,566
My father didn't leave us. He didn't.

721
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,266
My mother says that my
father will come for sure.

722
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,604
My father will come for sure.

723
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,613
You too will see, sir.
He will come for sure.

724
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,971
You all can leave, kids.

725
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,003
O Nanak, God blesses
the unworthy with virtue.

726
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,667
And bestows virtue on the virtuous.

727
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,235
O Nanak, God blesses
the unworthy with virtue.

728
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,575
And bestows virtue on the virtuous.

729
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,576
Bani.. - Yes'?

730
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,042
Don't you get tired of
reciting Gurbani the whole day'?

731
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:09,158
Gurmukh, how can anyone
get tired of doing something.

732
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,123
...which gives one peace and happiness?

733
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,027
You just wait and watch..

734
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,298
The day you get the
known from Gurbani..

735
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,560
...you too will get answers
to a lot of your questions.

736
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,468
Really? - Yes.

737
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,699
No.

738
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,302
The questions will be answered
when I will get a grandson.

739
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,378
Both of you will go to the
city today itself and do the test.

740
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,478
I have spoken to the doctor.

741
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,242
You will have to take the test.

742
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,248
You will get it
aborted if it's a girl.

743
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,150
Mother.. - No.

744
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,988
Don't talk. Just listen and follow.

745
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,287
Did you two understand?

746
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,094
Mother!

747
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,429
Mother!

748
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,197
Mother!

749
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,194
Master!

750
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,230
Master!
- Yes! Yes..

751
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,274
What's wrong? Is everything all right?

752
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,136
Yes. Everything is all right.

753
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,310
Come here. Come.

754
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,310
Have a seat.

755
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,785
I apologize, Subedar sahib.

756
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,048
I got lost in my thoughts.

757
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,223
I couldn't hear you.

758
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,326
Master, many incidents,
many sorrows are such that.

759
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,229
...they take away the
control you have on yourself.

760
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,069
My daughter Binder..

761
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,605
She used to talk nonstop.

762
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,284
I used to address her as Radio.

763
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,718
Now look at her.

764
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,816
The circumstances hit
the mute button in such a way..

765
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:52,255
...that my daughter has
turned into a clay doll.

766
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,654
Sukhi, Binder's husband..

767
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,502
He was very happy
when he went to Iraq.

768
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,172
He used to call every third day.

769
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,501
Those were some happy days.

770
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:13,308
He spent many years
saying that he is coming.

771
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,148
But he never came back.

772
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:22,582
It has been 10 months since
we got a call or a letter from him.

773
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:27,791
Some say that he went to America.

774
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:34,067
Some say that the terrorists have..

775
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,499
We don't know.

776
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,472
We don't understand.

777
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,800
Subedar sahib..

778
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,513
...one feels scared one
thinks about bad things.

779
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,220
I am a soldier.

780
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,252
I didn't feel scared while
fighting the war of 1971..

781
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,224
...wherein I could have easily died.

782
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:06,760
But.

783
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,073
I cannot tolerate to see
my daughter suffer like this.

784
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,611
Binder stays quiet in front of me.

785
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,014
But I know..

786
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,150
She is not as quiet as she seems.

787
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,132
I am her father.

788
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,402
I know everything.

789
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:48,334
I know how she hides her tears.

790
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,176
Sukhi..

791
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:05,392
If Sukhi is dead then
I will think it's God will..

792
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:11,064
But I cannot see her sad like this.

793
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,004
She loves Sukhi.

794
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,165
Subedar Sahib..

795
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,106
It doesn't suit you
to behalf like this.

796
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:28,146
O Nanak, don't be anxious;
the Lord will take care of you.

797
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:34,445
He created the creatures in water,
and He gives them their nourishment.

798
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,616
This small..

799
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:43,458
I was this small when my
father found me in the dustbin.

800
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,397
Someone threw me in the bin.

801
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,502
I don't know who my parents are.

802
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:54,372
All I know is that father had gone
to deliver letters and he found me.

803
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,636
His father was an unmarried man.

804
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,646
God gave him a child,
it was like winning a lottery.

805
00:43:58,702 --> 00:43:59,680
Free ticket to salvation.

806
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,010
Hence, he named him Lottery.
- Lottery.

807
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,576
Now tell me how can be
more unfortunate than the one..

808
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:12,083
...who doesn't know what is
his religion, caste and lineage.

809
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,593
Lottery. . - Yes'?

810
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,663
You have the best religion of all.

811
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,361
Which? - Humanity.

812
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:21,430
What? - Because that's the
real religion of Guru Nanak's Sikh.

813
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,535
Recognize all of mankind
as a single caste of humanity.

814
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,106
Lottery. . - Yes'?

815
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,175
Why do you cry over the fact
that someone threw you in a dustbin?

816
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,607
Why don't you instead thank God..

817
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,510
...because someone took
your out from a dustbin?

818
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:38,075
Let me meet God then I shall
ask him what his religion is.

819
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,746
Those bankers are after
my life for no good reason at all.

820
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,158
How can you say that
there is no reason, Mr. Sohi?

821
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,697
Who asked you to go beyond your
capacity at your daughter's wedding?

822
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,499
Why did you take such a huge loan?

823
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,762
There are two kinds of
people who suffer in life.

824
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,668
Ones are those who think
but don't do anything.

825
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,731
And the ones who think
after they do something.

826
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,265
"What have I done!"

827
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,574
Master, don't make me go after you.

828
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:10,247
You wouldn't be lecturing like this
if you too were burdened by loans.

829
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,451
Sohi, first of all,
I wouldn't have taken a loan.

830
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,514
If I had taken a loan then
I wouldn't worry about the tractor..

831
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,991
Not a tractor.

832
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,052
For a Jet tractor
is like a son to him.

833
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,762
Forgive me.

834
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,728
But God has blessed
you with only one son.

835
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,564
And his name is Assi.

836
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:31,598
You should concentrate on
helping him find the right direction.

837
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,006
Before calling the water dirty“

838
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:38,308
...you should first look
how dirty your hands are.

839
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,482
You should seek medicine
for your wounds..

840
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:48,282
You shouldn't seek sympathy from
people by showing them your wounds.

841
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,727
The one who has given you
the mouth will also feed you.

842
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,391
Sitting in a bar and getting drunk..

843
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,969
...and quetching over your
sorrows is not a manly thing to do.

844
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,338
Please forgive me if I
have said anything out of turn.

845
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,466
I won't forgive anyone.

846
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,546
Someone once again messed up.

847
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,672
Someone stole my scooter
along with my shawl..

848
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,043
Who stole it? - It was
parked over here and covered it..

849
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,519
So that no one steals it.
- Who stole it?

850
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,556
Get lost. I'll go.. - In my presence.

851
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,025
Who stole it in your
brother's presence'?

852
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,493
I will find it for you.

853
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,152
Your brother. Your true brother.

854
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,628
Really? - But it
will cost you Rs. 200.

855
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:35,726
I'll give you. Long live Hanger.
- No, no, no.

856
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,332
Don't say long live Hanger.

857
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,500
Say, shame-shame Hanger. - Why'?

858
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:44,473
Because Hanger and
Lottery fool you every day.

859
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:49,149
They first hide your things
and then they charge you to find it.

860
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,685
Your scooter is parked back there.

861
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:51,653
Okay?

862
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,018
Now more long live
Hanger and Lottery..

863
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,490
Shame on you!
- Sorry. Sorry.

864
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:03,521
"You can embroider flowers
on my shawl if you please."

865
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:06,993
He sounds like Sukhi.

866
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,730
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
- Yes, son'?

867
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,110
Gurmukh sir is going to the fair.

868
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,439
Can I go with him'?

869
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,018
Say something.

870
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,453
I live for your happiness.

871
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,983
You can go.
- Really?

872
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,688
Then get my long
shirt and pants ready.

873
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,456
I'm going for a bath.

874
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,330
Come on.
- Sir, you are cheating me into jogging.

875
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,401
Hey, the fair is just two
kilometers away from our village.

876
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,102
We have already
covered half kilometer.

877
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,635
Are you tired already?

878
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:53,106
The issue isn't about getting tired.

879
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,542
It ruins my gait.

880
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,646
And this dust is doing
my makeup for free.

881
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,147
You should understand.
Try to understand.

882
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,615
You can surely talk.

883
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,426
Sir, my father is not coming back.

884
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,189
If I cannot talk then
I will be all alone.

885
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,558
No, son. Your father will come back.

886
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,327
You are talking to God, aren't you'?

887
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,572
Sir, God is still making me pray.

888
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,368
By the way, what does your father do'?

889
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,180
My father has a
permanent job with God.

890
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,248
<i>Okay-</i>

891
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,146
This means your father is yes.

892
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,420
Not yes, death. He died.

893
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,220
Sir, that is a bad word.

894
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,688
I don't use such words.

895
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:44,094
By the way,
did you go to fairs with your father?

896
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,432
I used to go to fairs with my father.

897
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,229
I used to sit on my father's
shoulder and watch the fair.

898
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,631
The fair used to look so
big from my father's shoulder.

899
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:58,672
I used to enjoy the rides,
eat fritters and ice creams..

900
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,612
I used to ask him
to buy this and that.

901
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:01,641
You know my father..

902
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,451
What happened, Mithu?
Why did you stop?

903
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,617
Don't you want to go to the fair?

904
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,724
Sir, I don't want to go to the fair.

905
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,151
Why?

906
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,022
Now I will see the fair
while sitting on the shoulders.

907
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:20,659
Come here, then.

908
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,165
Come on.
Come sit on my shoulders.

909
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,964
Not yours, sir. My father's..

910
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:35,140
Mithu says that with
confidence and not diffidence.

911
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,755
Mithu! Mithu! Mithu!

912
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,686
Mithu!

913
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,346
'Lord, I have a father.'

914
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,109
'I have one, don't I?'

915
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,149
'Then please send him back to me.'

916
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,249
'My mother cries when alone.'

917
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,753
'Make her smile like
other mothers do.'

918
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:28,092
Otherwise,
Mithu will stop talking to you.

919
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,720
Assi, I saw a dream last night.

920
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,762
I was helping you set your turban.

921
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,164
Oh my God. What happened after that?

922
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,722
Then you looked into
my eyes and tied your turban.

923
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,234
Then it must have been
difficult to set the layers.

924
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,599
I mean I must be wondering..

925
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,400
...whether I should set myself
in your eyes or set my turban.

926
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,003
Then you said that you
have to go for the show..

927
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,769
And asked the people
to take your autographs later.

928
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,404
So that means I will
become a star for sure.

929
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,674
Then a lot of people will meet me.

930
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,379
To click my photos.
To books shows with me.

931
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:22,020
And our village will
be known as Assi's village.

932
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,154
You just wait and watch.

933
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,317
Stop daydreaming.

934
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,451
No company has called you back.

935
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,218
One had.

936
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,056
They said that I sing well..

937
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,698
...they will release my
CD if I pay them Rs. 20 Lakhs.

938
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:32,625
So'?

939
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,167
So then, I started lashing out on him.

940
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,164
Lashing out won't get
our vehicle on the track.

941
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,435
We are on the track.

942
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:46,243
Fortuner, Mercedes, BMW..

943
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,045
Brother, when you go for delivery,
you consume half of it.

944
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,545
I cannot open my eyes
without these drugs.

945
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:56,749
"Listen to me very carefully
about the situation."

946
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,391
"All the staff and students
are going overseas."

947
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:05,263
"Left behind are the farmers
who are close to their land."

948
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:06,996
Stop the car.

949
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,196
"Now the Singhs have.."

950
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,665
Pinku? Here'?

951
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,303
Have some shame.
She is elder than you.

952
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,494
Sabi..

953
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,334
Teach him a lesson.

954
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,302
And I'll take care of my sister.

955
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,311
Let's go.

956
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,492
Brother.. please.

957
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,202
Dad, please listen to me.
- Don't utter a word.

958
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,072
Because any word that comes out of
your mouth can turn me into a monster.

959
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:26,105
My daughter cannot
walk the paths of Heer.

960
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:33,377
Because if you do then I'll have
you and him buried in these paths.

961
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,518
One more thing. I won't repeat myself.

962
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,754
No more college.
You've studied enough.

963
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,199
Now you will graduate
only in one thing. Marriage.

964
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,333
<i>Asst .</i>

965
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,309
She is still alive. She didn't die.

966
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,438
I am her father.

967
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,278
No. You are an enemy.

968
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,249
To us and to yourself as well.

969
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:12,319
Your illicit business and
tormenting ways will make you repent.

970
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,151
We have no respect
left in this village.

971
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,130
Only brave people
like me can do such work.

972
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,292
Your village's useless
people can only talk.

973
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,730
And what respect
are you talking about?

974
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,034
You couldn't even invite
the village chief at my wedding.

975
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,711
When you will die, the C.M.
will come, father.

976
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:37,309
When your shadow and
your ego go beyond your size..

977
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,645
Then you should know that
the fall of night is here.

978
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:42,656
Dear. .

979
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:02,501
It's difficult to measure
the depth of a well and love.

980
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,137
It's not easy to be in love either.

981
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,142
It's very difficult.

982
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:12,016
Look, you too have
dents because of love.

983
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,083
He has decorated you well.

984
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,055
People are scared even to look at me.

985
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:19,716
No one can dare touch me.

986
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,660
I would beat them black and blue.

987
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:29,093
He says.. - Look son,
he is a druggie and her brother.

988
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,432
He has beaten you up heartlessly.

989
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,299
Be gratefully that those
lunatics left you alive.

990
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,734
Listen..

991
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,314
You know that your
engagement was called off.

992
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,710
You know that you two
won't be getting married..

993
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,447
Then why do you and
Mannat still see each other?

994
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,780
Mannat and I didn't
even know each other.

995
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,156
Our fathers fixed our marriage
because of their friendship.

996
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:55,421
When we started falling in love,
they called it off.

997
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:56,687
This is a limit.

998
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,092
It is difficult to say no to a stranger
that you meet while traveling.

999
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,701
And here we love each other.
How can we call it off'?

1000
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,231
So you are really in love.

1001
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,636
This is love,
not some song the DJ is playing.

1002
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,077
On which you can dance for
a while and then forget about it.

1003
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,541
So you have full intentions
of being with Mannat.

1004
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,642
I consider her to be my god.

1005
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,150
Fine.

1006
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,246
Then god will do it.

1007
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,423
As its said..

1008
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,086
When He is merciful,
then your desires will be fulfilled.

1009
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,287
When He is merciful,
you will never grieve.

1010
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,394
When He is merciful,
you will know no pain.

1011
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,197
When He is merciful,
you will enjoy the Lord's Love.

1012
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,532
Just stick to the truth.

1013
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,166
See you around.

1014
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,550
We should do everything
from our heart.

1015
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,961
We should do it with hope.

1016
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,619
We should do it with determination.

1017
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,323
We should do it with our heart.

1018
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,662
Because God is much
closer than imaginable.

1019
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,569
Once a person sat with a clay toy.

1020
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:14,499
He started requesting
it to turn it into gold.

1021
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,404
He got fed up in the evening.

1022
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,475
He got tired.

1023
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:22,176
He got sad and said,
if not gold, turn it into copper.

1024
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,474
God was closer.

1025
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,620
Quickly that toy turned into copper.

1026
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:30,513
Then he started regretting
and wondering what have I done!

1027
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,654
He thought, if I would
have kept saying turn into god..

1028
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,127
It would have turned into gold by now.

1029
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,162
So where did he go wrong?

1030
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,333
When his intentions went weak.

1031
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,126
Right?

1032
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:44,998
So kids.. - One shouldn't
let their determination go weak.

1033
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,005
Very good.

1034
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,101
Now we will take the class outside.

1035
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,165
Okay? - Okay, sir.

1036
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,210
Let's go.

1037
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,639
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1038
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,411
How are you, Master?
- Great. How are you'?

1039
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,212
Are you planning to become
a preacher after retirement?

1040
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,418
Please let this remain a school.

1041
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,615
I'll be right back.

1042
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,492
There is a committee meeting.
Please keep an eye on my class.

1043
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,684
They make a lot of noise.

1044
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,325
I'll be right back.

1045
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,163
'Your letters won't go waste, dear.'

1046
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:02,142
Lottery.. Lottery is your pet name.

1047
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,214
What is your given name?
- My given name?

1048
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:07,619
<i>Lottery OWE'-!</i>

1049
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,555
Really?
What is Oyye?

1050
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,427
Oyye is my lineage.

1051
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,296
Hanger.. - Yes'?

1052
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,527
Why are you pacing like that?

1053
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,329
Won't you offer tea to me today?

1054
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:28,408
I will, Master.
The box of sugar has gone missing.

1055
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:32,545
I'll find it for you.
But it will cost you Rs. 100.

1056
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:36,207
Wait, Snake. I'll pay you Rs. 100.

1057
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,342
Wonderful.

1058
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,052
Your past comes back to bite you.

1059
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:43,480
Now you are agitated.

1060
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,614
You are feeling bad
when it happened to you'?

1061
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:47,427
Look, it hurts when you are hit.

1062
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,489
Snake. - Yes'?

1063
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,325
Give him the box back.

1064
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,228
Here's your box.

1065
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,400
Today make two cups of tea.
Okay?

1066
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,661
What do you mean?

1067
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,402
It means Master has
taught us a lesson.

1068
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,201
Don't worry. Our turn shall also come.

1069
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,079
Lottery. . - Yes'?

1070
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,416
Yes'?
- Your turn is coming soon.

1071
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,712
How so?

1072
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,018
The one who used to write
letters to Lord Almighty..

1073
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,189
I found that person..

1074
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,384
No, I didn't find that person.

1075
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:20,721
No, I mean I have found that person.

1076
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,324
Why should I find that person?

1077
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,093
No Lottery, I am telling you that.

1078
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:29,125
...I have found the person
who writes letters to Lord Almighty.

1079
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,226
Who?

1080
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,696
A student from my class.

1081
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:35,498
Jyoti.

1082
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,409
She writes letters to Lord Almighty.

1083
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,674
Her mother passed away.

1084
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,780
She stays in this village
with her maternal grandparents.

1085
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:52,120
She is waiting for a reply for
her letters since the past two years.

1086
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:53,789
She is a fool.

1087
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,427
How will she get
a reply for the letter..

1088
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,330
...which doesn't reach the recipient?

1089
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,536
She will get a reply
from Lord Almighty.

1090
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:05,706
Where is Lord Almighty?

1091
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:07,666
Lord Almighty?

1092
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,574
Look over there.

1093
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,514
That's Bachchan.

1094
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,378
Lord Almighty dwells in him.

1095
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,010
Lord Almighty dwells in me.

1096
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,012
Lord Almighty dwells in Jyoti.

1097
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,191
Lord Almighty dwells in you as well.

1098
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:30,726
Now I don't know whom Lord
Almighty will ask to write the letter.

1099
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,027
This belongs to you.

1100
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:39,768
Now you can either
drink it or spill it.

1101
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,037
Bye.

1102
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,642
Master. .

1103
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,304
I don't know what Master
told you in your ears.

1104
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,516
But a person who usually
speaks openly whispers something..

1105
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,118
...in someone's ears then
it has to be something important.

1106
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:03,594
"He ploughs the fields
early in the morning.."

1107
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:10,035
"You have a beautiful
sight in front of you."

1108
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,710
Yes, sweetheart.

1109
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:18,677
A little far, a little together.

1110
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,281
Why this silence'?

1111
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:30,021
Kill me with your sweet words.

1112
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:31,447
<i>Asst .</i>

1113
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,593
Forget me.

1114
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,256
<i>Okay-</i>

1115
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,225
Should I forget you right away
or after I keep my harmonium away?

1116
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:40,794
Keep smiling like this.

1117
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,093
I am getting engaged tomorrow.

1118
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,638
Please forgive me if you can.

1119
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,632
Hello?

1120
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,309
Hello!

1121
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:52,738
Hello!

1122
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,043
Hello?

1123
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:30,142
Oh Goddess,
I have done no harm to anyone.

1124
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,043
Then why did you do this to me?

1125
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,481
I was working hard
to nurture my children.

1126
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,290
May you get ruined you robber!

1127
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:46,195
"There is darkness all around."

1128
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,563
How can you take my tractor away!

1129
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:51,765
"There is no moon in sight."

1130
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:52,699
Back off!

1131
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,700
Damn you all!

1132
01:03:56,199 --> 01:04:00,648
They are taking my child away.

1133
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:06,244
"There is no happiness in sight."

1134
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:12,516
"I have heard that
you are ever so forgiving."

1135
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:17,460
"Forgive me."

1136
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:22,753
"The person who seeks
your refuge never loses."

1137
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:34,011
"The sorrows of life
are overburdening."

1138
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,608
"I have lost all battles."

1139
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:43,182
"The sorrows of life
are overburdening."

1140
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,088
"I have lost all battles."

1141
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:51,655
"Oh Lord.."

1142
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:56,231
"Have mercy."

1143
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:02,742
"Oh Lord.."

1144
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,705
"Have mercy."

1145
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:37,601
"There are so many
obstacles in my path."

1146
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:43,743
"There are so many
gasps in my breath."

1147
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:55,659
"There are so many
obstacles in my path."

1148
01:05:56,152 --> 01:06:01,659
"There are so many
gasps in my breath."

1149
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:07,699
"I cannot find any shore in sight."

1150
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,440
"I cannot find any shore in sight."

1151
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:15,608
"Oh Lord.."

1152
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,579
"Have mercy."

1153
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:26,551
"Oh Lord.."

1154
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:30,654
"Have mercy."

1155
01:06:31,252 --> 01:06:32,663
How much? - Rs. 60.

1156
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,199
Give me a fifty and a tenner.

1157
01:06:34,756 --> 01:06:35,700
Master?

1158
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:40,501
If you want to get your motorcycle
serviced then let me know.

1159
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:44,538
Someone will pick up the bike,
service it and bring it back.

1160
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,737
If something goes
wrong you can catch me.

1161
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:48,108
It's a fact.

1162
01:06:49,537 --> 01:06:50,743
Lala.. - Yes'?

1163
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,750
If you have forgotten any
job then you can add that as well.

1164
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,445
You have listed almost everything.

1165
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:57,285
Can't help it. I am in need.

1166
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:59,856
Let me know if I can
do anything else also.

1167
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:01,886
Now I cannot go back to the old shop.

1168
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:04,820
Now I need to open a big
general store for Resham Mittal.

1169
01:07:04,886 --> 01:07:06,160
It's a fact.

1170
01:07:06,387 --> 01:07:07,730
Why won't you open for me?

1171
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:10,702
Oh my mistake. Oh my wrong number.

1172
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,799
Your name is Resham Mittal.

1173
01:07:12,894 --> 01:07:14,305
Petrol is your pet name.

1174
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:17,171
If only I wish,
I hadn't named you petrol.

1175
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:18,336
It's a fact.

1176
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,410
Bodi.. - Yes'?

1177
01:07:19,467 --> 01:07:20,741
Two kilos of cauliflower.
- Okay.

1178
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:22,574
And one kilo potatoes.

1179
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:23,682
Okay, okay.

1180
01:07:23,805 --> 01:07:27,309
Mr. Sohi.. What's Bodi?

1181
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:30,215
You are from the same village.
You should respect each other.

1182
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:33,558
Call him Shambhu Nath, call him Lala.
Call him sir.

1183
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:35,250
Stop it, Master.

1184
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:37,362
My fate had already made fun of me.

1185
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:39,090
On top of that,
you have started lecturing me.

1186
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:42,858
Fate is just a four-letter word.

1187
01:07:43,158 --> 01:07:47,163
And weak fools like you
turn into an overbearing mountain.

1188
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:52,644
Look at Shambhu Nath.. he has
started afresh challenging his fate.

1189
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:55,407
Robbers stole everything
from his shop.

1190
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:59,616
He didn't consume poison
or cursed his fate.

1191
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:02,515
You are young. Do something
meaningful with your life.

1192
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,882
Why do you behave like an idler?

1193
01:08:04,345 --> 01:08:04,755
Here you go.

1194
01:08:04,846 --> 01:08:06,325
Sow happiness, young man.

1195
01:08:06,548 --> 01:08:08,118
And smiles will grow.

1196
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:12,424
There are many who blame the fate

1197
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:17,700
And there are those whose
cut across stones to survive.

1198
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:19,861
Tomatoes.

1199
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:22,841
Hello, Master. - Hello.

1200
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:24,402
Bodi..

1201
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:25,671
Yes'?
- How much for the tomatoes?

1202
01:08:25,733 --> 01:08:27,303
Six. - How will you give them'?

1203
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:29,678
I'll sell by weight.
- Okay. Hurry up.

1204
01:08:29,737 --> 01:08:32,843
Not Bodi, Kannu auntie.
Call him Shambhu Nath.

1205
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:36,417
Bye, uncle Shambhu. - Bye.

1206
01:08:36,477 --> 01:08:38,457
See you around. - Bless you.

1207
01:08:41,449 --> 01:08:42,723
Kannu auntie?

1208
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:46,132
He used to address me as Kamli (fool).

1209
01:08:46,654 --> 01:08:47,655
When did he change?

1210
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:49,258
He dialed the right number.

1211
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:51,395
I recently became his uncle Shambhu.

1212
01:08:56,164 --> 01:08:57,575
Master! Master!

1213
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:59,340
You should leave
this place immediately.

1214
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:01,606
What happened?

1215
01:09:02,503 --> 01:09:03,880
Today the liquor
seller himself is drunk.

1216
01:09:04,138 --> 01:09:06,140
You have stopped the
ones who used to drink.

1217
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:09,518
Snake isn't drinking and Lottery
is also not touching any alcohol.

1218
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:13,190
Hanger..
- Don't come forward. (30 back.

1219
01:09:13,248 --> 01:09:16,752
You give lectures, you start
preaching and I am losing my clients.

1220
01:09:16,884 --> 01:09:21,526
It's okay. There are many
alcohol lovers still left in Punjab.

1221
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:24,567
Lottery, have a seat. Let's have tea.

1222
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:28,232
I have stopped selling tea.
Go away.

1223
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:30,641
Lottery, why don't you have a drink?

1224
01:09:30,898 --> 01:09:32,275
Whom do you have other than alcohol?

1225
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:37,075
Lottery.. where is Sohi?

1226
01:09:37,205 --> 01:09:38,445
I haven't seen him since many days.

1227
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,676
I think we will soon hear the news..

1228
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:42,311
Of his suicide.

1229
01:10:57,819 --> 01:10:59,560
If there is no harvest,
there is no future.

1230
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:04,796
There is a lot of loan.
You should die.

1231
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,096
Great.

1232
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,134
This is pride.

1233
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:17,574
Show the product you are hiding.

1234
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:23,419
Things which you need to
hide are either a theft or a sin.

1235
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:26,758
You have neither stolen
anything nor committed a sin.

1236
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,294
Life and death are
in the hands of God.

1237
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:41,268
But human beings are
trying to become God.

1238
01:11:43,131 --> 01:11:45,236
They have taken death
into their own hands.

1239
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:49,303
I have not come here
to stop you from dying.

1240
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:55,416
I thought I should spend some time
with a person who is going to die.

1241
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:02,327
What is your name?

1242
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:05,521
Dilar Singh Sohi.

1243
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:08,792
You are doing a brave thing.

1244
01:12:09,357 --> 01:12:10,768
It is a very brave thing to do.

1245
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:20,473
I don't understand,
what made Guru Gobind Singh..

1246
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:28,778
...sacrifice his family,
his kingship, his four children..

1247
01:12:29,844 --> 01:12:32,757
...and yet with pride say:

1248
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:39,458
For saving these sons,
I have got my own four sons martyred.

1249
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:44,528
So what if four are dead,
when thousands more are alive.

1250
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:52,303
It's a pity to see his heir..

1251
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:55,545
...who lost his tractor
and suffered a loss..

1252
01:12:56,304 --> 01:13:01,447
...and carry a bottle
of poison in his hand.

1253
01:13:05,446 --> 01:13:08,188
It's okay. It's your will.

1254
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:19,467
Let me know if you have any last wish.

1255
01:13:20,828 --> 01:13:26,141
If you have any message
for your wife or Agyapal?

1256
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:32,651
He will take a loan tomorrow
and perform your last rites.

1257
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:39,249
Bye. See you around.

1258
01:13:39,313 --> 01:13:41,657
Oh.. how will we meet again?

1259
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,060
A dead person doesn't come back.

1260
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:47,793
And there is no next life.

1261
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:27,640
I wish there was a next life.

1262
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:32,140
I would have been born as a brave man.

1263
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:40,553
My weakness made me lonely.

1264
01:14:45,746 --> 01:14:49,387
I sought darkness for myself.

1265
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:52,489
Look, it is a business for me.

1266
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,461
If I don't perform the abortion,
someone else will.

1267
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:57,229
Think about it.

1268
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,405
She is in the fifth month.

1269
01:14:59,827 --> 01:15:02,569
Abortion is risky for her life.

1270
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:05,076
Nothing will happen to her.
You do your job.

1271
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:08,604
You look like a gentleman.

1272
01:15:09,136 --> 01:15:10,240
Mother.. - Shut up.

1273
01:15:11,138 --> 01:15:11,809
You have said what you had to say.

1274
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:13,177
We have said what we wanted to say.

1275
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:18,456
Brother, you will have to
come with me and fill a few forms.

1276
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:19,388
Go.

1277
01:15:20,281 --> 01:15:21,191
Go on.

1278
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:23,287
Mother, think over it.

1279
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:26,287
Go.

1280
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:12,810
Doctor. .

1281
01:16:14,468 --> 01:16:15,640
I had warned you.

1282
01:16:16,303 --> 01:16:19,079
Poison has spread all
across her body. - What?

1283
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,685
She has very little time left.

1284
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:03,417
Bani..

1285
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:07,596
Please forgive me.

1286
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,601
Don't say that.

1287
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:15,436
I couldn't give you a son.

1288
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:19,537
I don't want a son.

1289
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:20,835
Look Bani..

1290
01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:24,182
You are my son, you are my family.

1291
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:25,410
You are my life. You are my world.

1292
01:17:25,906 --> 01:17:29,251
I want you, Bani.
I don't want anything else.

1293
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:30,848
Get up. Let's go home.

1294
01:17:36,317 --> 01:17:37,625
Yes, Bani?

1295
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:43,225
You used to say..

1296
01:17:44,825 --> 01:17:48,602
That if we had a daughter.

1297
01:17:51,732 --> 01:17:59,844
We.. would name her Jyoti.

1298
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:03,813
Bani.. you are fine.

1299
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:06,191
Nothing is wrong with you. Okay?

1300
01:18:30,404 --> 01:18:32,179
Bani!

1301
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:48,133
Bani!

1302
01:19:19,854 --> 01:19:23,597
Bani, I promise you.

1303
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:27,272
I will never cry again.

1304
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:28,671
Okay?

1305
01:19:30,631 --> 01:19:34,807
Let me cry to my heart's
content today, Bani.

1306
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:56,195
Where is your father, son'?

1307
01:19:56,657 --> 01:19:59,137
Where can he go'?
I think he is still asleep.

1308
01:19:59,293 --> 01:20:01,500
Have you lost your mind'?
You say he is not awake?

1309
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:03,573
He wakes up at the crack of dawn.

1310
01:20:03,697 --> 01:20:05,506
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him.

1311
01:20:05,532 --> 01:20:06,374
Really?

1312
01:20:07,534 --> 01:20:10,344
Assi, I hope he hasn't
done anything to himself.

1313
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:12,246
We will be ruined.

1314
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:14,509
Father!

1315
01:20:27,821 --> 01:20:29,391
Father!

1316
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:35,636
Assi's father!

1317
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:40,477
Father!

1318
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,268
Father!

1319
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:07,405
Father! Father!

1320
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:14,772
Father!

1321
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:17,376
"Father!" What happened?

1322
01:21:18,806 --> 01:21:20,285
He always wants his father.

1323
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:22,678
Why are you staring at me?

1324
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:25,217
You are staring as
if you have seen a ghost.

1325
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:28,287
I was just stretching a little.

1326
01:21:28,582 --> 01:21:29,720
I have gone stiff.

1327
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:34,088
Ask your mother to warm
some milk with cardamom.

1328
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:35,829
Ask her to add some yellow liquid too.

1329
01:21:36,223 --> 01:21:38,760
Yellow liquid? - Honey.

1330
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:43,307
Mother, add some honey
in the milk for your honey.

1331
01:21:43,597 --> 01:21:45,235
Warm some for him too.

1332
01:21:45,432 --> 01:21:49,312
From today I and my son will
work in the fields like workers.

1333
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:51,372
Workers? - Farmers.

1334
01:21:52,339 --> 01:21:54,148
My son will channel the water.

1335
01:21:55,142 --> 01:21:56,519
He will cut the crops. - Yes.

1336
01:21:56,577 --> 01:21:58,523
He can practice singing there.

1337
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:00,181
And he will also get some exercise.

1338
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:03,118
Hats off to your scheme.

1339
01:22:03,183 --> 01:22:05,356
Now we won't touch alcohol and drugs.

1340
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:08,293
Let's go. - Let's go.

1341
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:12,735
Great.

1342
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:16,131
May God give long
life to these bankers.

1343
01:22:17,364 --> 01:22:19,469
If they wouldn't have
taken the tractor away..

1344
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:22,804
...then my husband won't
have chosen the right path.

1345
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:27,882
I have seen him laughing
after a long time.

1346
01:22:29,877 --> 01:22:31,379
Thank you, God.

1347
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:33,680
Thank you.

1348
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:36,419
Sir..

1349
01:22:38,285 --> 01:22:40,629
My dear children..

1350
01:22:41,722 --> 01:22:42,462
What happened, sir?

1351
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:44,560
I cannot do it, sir. I am feeling shy.

1352
01:22:44,691 --> 01:22:47,763
No, don't feel shy.
Sit down. Today you are the sir.

1353
01:22:48,128 --> 01:22:49,505
I am a student. I am being punished.

1354
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:50,531
I am standing outside.

1355
01:22:51,098 --> 01:22:52,236
My dear children.

1356
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,339
You get knowledge from books.

1357
01:22:54,601 --> 01:22:58,572
But there is some knowledge
that you don't get from books..

1358
01:22:58,839 --> 01:23:01,217
You get it from your day-to-day life.

1359
01:23:01,608 --> 01:23:03,519
By respecting your parents.

1360
01:23:03,644 --> 01:23:05,487
By keeping good company..

1361
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,454
By doing good deeds.

1362
01:23:07,514 --> 01:23:13,556
Come, instead of asking for bungalows,
money and cars..

1363
01:23:13,687 --> 01:23:16,224
Let's ask God for a blessing
of doing good deeds.

1364
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:18,735
O Lord, grant me the boon..

1365
01:23:18,792 --> 01:23:21,102
...that I may never deviate
from doing a good deed.

1366
01:23:21,295 --> 01:23:23,434
That I shall not fear
when I go into combat.

1367
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:25,534
And with determination,
I will be victorious.

1368
01:23:25,599 --> 01:23:27,875
And with determination..
- I will be victorious.

1369
01:23:28,135 --> 01:23:30,741
And with determination..
- I will be victorious.

1370
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:39,247
Thank you, Gurmukh. For guiding me.

1371
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,092
From day,
no going out during school time.

1372
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:45,456
Only teaching.

1373
01:23:45,686 --> 01:23:47,825
And I shall begin from now itself.

1374
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:50,262
Come on Neetu madam,
let's go to our classes. - Great.

1375
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:53,394
A huge round of applause
for your sir, kids. - Thank you.

1376
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:54,698
Let's go, madam.

1377
01:23:55,796 --> 01:23:58,140
Welcome. Welcome, Lottery.

1378
01:23:58,198 --> 01:23:59,404
Most welcome.

1379
01:23:59,633 --> 01:24:00,634
You are late.

1380
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:02,408
I wanted to show
how good these kids are.

1381
01:24:02,636 --> 01:24:03,478
Come.

1382
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:07,342
You have come to see which
one of them is Jyoti, right?

1383
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:10,251
No, Master. I know who Jyoti is.

1384
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:12,782
Actually, today is her birthday.

1385
01:24:15,582 --> 01:24:16,526
Really?

1386
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:20,165
But how did you know?

1387
01:24:22,156 --> 01:24:23,658
I read the letter.

1388
01:24:25,826 --> 01:24:29,399
You read the letter but didn't reply.

1389
01:24:30,097 --> 01:24:32,475
This is a limit of shamelessness,
Lottery.

1390
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:36,346
You could have given
her a letter as a gift.

1391
01:24:38,372 --> 01:24:39,544
I won't be able to write it.

1392
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:46,588
Fine.

1393
01:24:48,682 --> 01:24:51,822
As you wish, my postman brother.

1394
01:24:52,085 --> 01:24:53,291
Sir! Sir! Please listen to me.

1395
01:24:53,353 --> 01:24:55,264
Hold on. Don't say anything.

1396
01:24:55,322 --> 01:24:56,824
Wait. First listen to me.

1397
01:24:58,825 --> 01:25:00,395
Here's 100 rupees.

1398
01:25:00,794 --> 01:25:04,173
Today is Jyoti's birthday.
- Really?

1399
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:09,237
Go and get sweets worth Rs.
100 from the confectioner.

1400
01:25:10,137 --> 01:25:10,672
<i>Okay-</i>

1401
01:25:14,274 --> 01:25:16,220
'To my dearest Lord Almighty.'

1402
01:25:16,476 --> 01:25:18,683
'I am sure you must
have recognized me.'

1403
01:25:19,112 --> 01:25:21,456
'I am Jyoti who writes
letters to you.'

1404
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:25,520
'Give my regards to my mother.'

1405
01:25:25,586 --> 01:25:27,190
Happy Birthday to you.

1406
01:25:27,254 --> 01:25:31,396
'Lord Almighty, today sir celebrated
my birthday in a grand style.'

1407
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:35,637
Happy Birthday dear Jyoti.

Happy Birthday to you.

1409
01:25:43,704 --> 01:25:45,274
Happy Birthday, Jyoti.

1410
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:57,255
'Sir gave me a very
beautiful gift as well.'

1411
01:26:06,793 --> 01:26:09,569
'But I didn't receive
your letter today as well.'

1412
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:13,101
'After you have called
my mother to be with you..'

1413
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:16,509
'..you haven't replied
to any of my letters.'

1414
01:26:17,604 --> 01:26:22,212
'Now if you don't reply
to me then I shall die.'

1415
01:26:24,778 --> 01:26:28,817
'I know that I can meet
my mother after I die.'

1416
01:26:29,316 --> 01:26:31,796
'Please tell me how
my mother is doing.'

1417
01:26:32,152 --> 01:26:34,132
'Bye, Lord Almighty.'

1418
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:36,565
<i>'I'll</i> wait for your letter.'

1419
01:27:00,213 --> 01:27:03,319
'My dear Jyoti.'

1420

'Accept lots of love.'

1421
01:27:08,755 --> 01:27:14,706
'I am your Lord Almighty..'

1422
01:27:15,629 --> 01:27:17,870
'The world kept your Almighty busy.'

1423
01:27:18,565 --> 01:27:20,806
'Hence, I couldn't reply to you.'

1424
01:27:21,702 --> 01:27:25,514
'Now I shall reply to all
your letters, old as well as new.'

1425
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:30,255
'Jyoti, your mother is very happy.'

1426
01:27:30,744 --> 01:27:34,556
'Oh yes,
we too celebrated your birthday.'

1427
01:27:35,148 --> 01:27:36,525
'We had cut a cake.'

1428
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,720
'Angels attended it, they danced.'

1429
01:27:41,154 --> 01:27:47,435
'And everyone together sang,
happy birthday to you.'

1430
01:27:47,561 --> 01:27:53,204
'Happy birthday dear Jyoti.'

1431
01:27:53,433 --> 01:27:55,572
'Your mother was very happy, dear.'

1432
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:20,533
'But all of us and your
mother are upset with you.'

1433
01:28:21,194 --> 01:28:24,266
'You shouldn't stay sad, Jyoti.'

1434
01:28:24,898 --> 01:28:29,210
'Your mother becomes sad
when she sees that you are sad.'

1435
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:31,342
'Then she starts feeling restless.'

1436
01:28:32,472 --> 01:28:37,785
'You should smile, when you
smile your mother also smiles.'

1437
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:42,752
'Your mother watches everything
that you do down there.'

1438
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:45,391
'Don't worry about your mother.'

1439
01:28:46,353 --> 01:28:50,529
'Lots of love from your mother.'

1440
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:55,296
'Yours' Lord Almighty.'

1441
01:28:57,631 --> 01:28:59,338
Love you, Lord Almighty.

1442
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,236
Love you, Mummy.

1443
01:29:09,743 --> 01:29:14,749
Oh Lord, with your grace,
I have opened a new general store.

1444
01:29:15,382 --> 01:29:18,329
With its first income I
shall install fans in the school.

1445
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:20,395
Just help me succeed.

1446
01:29:20,554 --> 01:29:22,363
Oh Lord Almighty.

1447
01:29:24,758 --> 01:29:26,237
Lord Almighty

1448
01:29:33,266 --> 01:29:37,271
Lord Almighty,
I don't even know how to pray.

1449
01:29:38,572 --> 01:29:40,552
I was upset with
you for so many years.

1450
01:29:41,174 --> 01:29:43,211
I have come here to
thank you and to apologize.

1451
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:45,353
Thank you for making me a human being.

1452
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:50,324
And I apologize for writing
letters as Lord Almighty.

1453
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:53,621
But I feel so happy to see her happy.

1454
01:29:54,821 --> 01:29:55,663
Bye.

1455
01:29:56,523 --> 01:29:57,558
Lord Almighty..

1456
01:30:22,482 --> 01:30:25,395
Lord Almighty..

1457
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:27,821
Lord Almighty..

1458
01:30:28,522 --> 01:30:29,432
Hello.

1459
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:31,797
Lottery.. - I seek your blessings.

1460
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:37,169
We have been clicking
photos in front of bars.

1461
01:30:37,531 --> 01:30:38,669
Let's click one in
front of the Gurudwara.

1462
01:30:38,765 --> 01:30:40,176
Yes, sure.

1463
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,701
He is back.

1464
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:44,642
Brother. - Yes'?

1465
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:47,375
Click our photo in
front of the Gurudwara.

1466
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,442
Give it to me. - Here.

1467
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:54,281
What are you doing? Press this button.

1468
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:57,361
I know. I carry a better
phone than yours. Iphone 6.

1469
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:58,395
Pose.

1470
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:01,665
We are standing in front
of a Gurudwara. Fold your hands.

1471
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:03,096
Smile please.

1472
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:05,326
One more.

1473
01:31:06,226 --> 01:31:07,204
Smile.

1474
01:31:08,795 --> 01:31:09,865
Here. - Give it to me.

1475
01:31:10,697 --> 01:31:13,200
Lottery. We will upload
it on Facebook. - Yes.

1476
01:31:13,366 --> 01:31:17,246
Come on, man, it's time for
Snapchat and Instagram, you know.

1477
01:31:18,438 --> 01:31:20,384
Come on, let's go.
- What did he say'?

1478
01:31:21,341 --> 01:31:22,615
He thanked us in English.

1479
01:31:22,842 --> 01:31:23,718
Such a big speech?

1480
01:31:25,779 --> 01:31:26,553
Yes.

1481
01:31:28,415 --> 01:31:30,656
Master, it's not a joke.
- More tea and less sugar.

1482
01:31:30,717 --> 01:31:34,187
I have heard him live. - Amazing.

1483
01:31:34,421 --> 01:31:36,833
The one sang this song,
my heart calls out..

1484
01:31:37,257 --> 01:31:40,670
I eagerly wait for you. - Eagerly.

1485
01:31:40,727 --> 01:31:42,400
Snake sir, your tea.

1486
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:44,236
Behave yourself, Hanger.

1487
01:31:44,297 --> 01:31:45,776
What happened? - Don't curse me.

1488
01:31:46,232 --> 01:31:47,836
You address me as Snake and sir?

1489
01:31:49,069 --> 01:31:51,174
Okay, we are making
one more decision today.

1490
01:31:51,237 --> 01:31:53,148
Henceforth we will
take his given name.

1491
01:31:53,206 --> 01:31:53,684
We won't address him as snake.

1492
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,311
What is your given name? - Naagraj.

1493
01:31:56,843 --> 01:31:57,753
Oh damn.

1494
01:31:58,511 --> 01:32:00,354
Then I think Snake is better.

1495
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:06,297
How are you'? - Fine.

1496
01:32:06,353 --> 01:32:08,333
How are you, Agyapal Singh'?
Is everything all right?

1497
01:32:08,655 --> 01:32:10,100
Yes, with God's grace.

1498
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:11,434
Shall we go'?

1499
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:12,468
Yes, let's go.
- Wait.

1500
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:13,833
Where are you going? You
can take your father with you later.

1501
01:32:14,094 --> 01:32:15,334
Spend some time with us as well.

1502
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:18,470
Today, I want Agyapal to sing for us.

1503
01:32:18,531 --> 01:32:19,669
Yes. - Here'?

1504
01:32:19,733 --> 01:32:22,270
If you sing here then
you will go ahead. - Yes.

1505
01:32:22,402 --> 01:32:25,611
I'll record your song
and upload it on YouTube.

1506
01:32:25,839 --> 01:32:27,113
Then you too will become a star.

1507
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,685
Great. - Go for it, son.

1508
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:31,619
Do one thing,
sing that song which you always hum..

1509
01:32:32,045 --> 01:32:35,151
"The mobile is full of junk."

1510
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:36,353
You are great, father.

1511
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:37,492
Hold this.

1512
01:32:38,184 --> 01:32:39,094
Hold on to it. - Okay.

1513
01:32:39,252 --> 01:32:41,630
Well done. - Go for it.

1514
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:43,429
Be a shinning star! (30 for it!

1515
01:32:43,523 --> 01:32:44,695
Okay, Master. Thank you.

1516
01:32:49,396 --> 01:32:50,272
Hello.

1517
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,741
Wait.

1518
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:54,842
I am your beloved Assi Sohi.

1519
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:57,712
What I am "not" today..

1520
01:32:58,138 --> 01:33:01,608
It's all thanks to my honorable,
respectable father.

1521
01:33:03,309 --> 01:33:04,720
Smile dad, I am just joking.

1522
01:33:08,581 --> 01:33:11,755
"One shouldn't fall
for the enemy's daughter."

1523
01:33:11,818 --> 01:33:14,799
"One shouldn't shelter
a deceiving snake."

1524
01:33:17,524 --> 01:33:20,528
"Why compare with someone
beyond your capacity?"

1525
01:33:20,694 --> 01:33:23,197
"Never endorse for a bad person."

1526
01:33:23,263 --> 01:33:27,769
"Never tolerate anything
against your dear ones."

1527

"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1528
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:34,617
"Never try to divide and
rule in your village, brother."

1529
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:38,121
"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1530
01:33:51,691 --> 01:33:54,729
"Never gossip about a poor man."

1531
01:33:54,794 --> 01:34:00,073
"Never praise the
rich to stroke his ego."

1532
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:03,246
"Never gossip about a poor man."

1533
01:34:03,303 --> 01:34:06,079
"Never praise the
rich to stroke his ego."

1534
01:34:06,139 --> 01:34:08,813
"Never joke about one's helplessness."

1535
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:11,589
"Everyone knows that
anything to anyone anytime."

1536
01:34:11,711 --> 01:34:15,625
"Our best investment
is a good friendship."

1537
01:34:17,617 --> 01:34:19,563
What happened to him'?

1538
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:20,459
"Yes."

1539
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,296
"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1540
01:34:23,523 --> 01:34:25,833

rule in your village, brother."

1541
01:34:26,226 --> 01:34:30,470
"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1542
01:34:32,165 --> 01:34:33,109
Done.

1543
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:40,474
"Never let your friends down."

1544
01:34:40,673 --> 01:34:45,383
"Never befriend a druggie."

1545
01:34:46,246 --> 01:34:49,056
"Never let your friends down."

1546
01:34:49,449 --> 01:34:51,725

"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1551
01:35:06,432 --> 01:35:09,174
"Never try to divide and
rule in your village, brother."

1552
01:35:09,235 --> 01:35:12,307
"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1553
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:15,711
Stop, sir. Stop, stop, stop.

1554
01:35:16,176 --> 01:35:17,246
What happened?

1555
01:35:18,578 --> 01:35:19,488
What happened, son'?

1556
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:21,320
It's time to pray.

1557
01:35:21,548 --> 01:35:22,720
We will get late, son.

1558
01:35:23,082 --> 01:35:25,585
By the time, we reach school
the function will be over.

1559
01:35:25,685 --> 01:35:27,096
You are anyway coming
back in the evening.

1560
01:35:27,187 --> 01:35:29,189
Sir, you forgot what you taught us?

1561
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:31,098
I don't want to lose
my determination.

1562
01:35:31,124 --> 01:35:32,535
...and make all my prayers
go down the drain.

1563
01:35:32,592 --> 01:35:34,196
And then it's you who said..

1564
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,638
...one shouldn't go against
your character on the character day.

1565
01:35:47,473 --> 01:35:49,646
Mummy, smile please.

1566
01:35:51,077 --> 01:35:52,249
Love you.

1567
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:55,415
Soldier..
- Yes'?

1568
01:35:55,481 --> 01:35:56,289
Give me the cap.

1569
01:35:57,383 --> 01:35:57,827
Who is he?

1570
01:35:58,151 --> 01:35:59,255
First give me the cap.

1571
01:36:00,253 --> 01:36:01,493
Who is she'?

1572
01:36:02,288 --> 01:36:04,199
Don't you know? She is a mother.

1573
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:05,334
Mother'?

1574
01:36:06,192 --> 01:36:07,830
God sent you'?

1575
01:36:10,196 --> 01:36:13,075
I had written Him a
letter to send a mother.

1576
01:36:13,766 --> 01:36:15,575
Thank you, God.

1577
01:36:16,636 --> 01:36:18,513
Listen everyone.

1578
01:36:18,638 --> 01:36:21,642
Jyoti's mother is here.

1579
01:36:23,743 --> 01:36:26,587
Well done, Lottery. You are amazing.

1580
01:36:32,652 --> 01:36:34,654
You are the one who is amazing.

1581
01:36:36,155 --> 01:36:39,602
You gave a lottery to this Lottery.

1582
01:36:42,262 --> 01:36:43,172
But.

1583
01:36:45,398 --> 01:36:47,503
Why did a decent man
like you became a prisoner'?

1584
01:36:51,237 --> 01:36:53,581
I too am someone's culprit, Lottery.

1585
01:36:54,507 --> 01:36:57,386
Let's go, kids.
Let's play the next game.

1586
01:36:57,877 --> 01:37:00,585
Come on, everyone. Come here.
Come on, come on.

1587
01:37:07,553 --> 01:37:09,555
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

1588
01:37:09,656 --> 01:37:14,298
So from now on, say no.

1589
01:37:16,129 --> 01:37:18,302
Okay kids,
now for the thought of the day.

1590
01:37:18,364 --> 01:37:20,275
Okay? - Okay, sir.

1591
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:23,507
God's children.. - So many of them.

1592
01:37:23,569 --> 01:37:27,449
To make excuses...
- Is to feel scared and accept defeat.

1593
01:37:27,507 --> 01:37:30,852
What is difficult?
- To make it simple.

1594
01:37:31,144 --> 01:37:34,216
What is simple?
- To make it difficult.

1595
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,523
Baba Nanak has said in Gurbani..

1596
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:39,596
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1597
01:37:39,652 --> 01:37:42,326
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1598
01:37:42,455 --> 01:37:45,095
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1599
01:37:45,158 --> 01:37:47,604
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1600
01:37:47,794 --> 01:37:50,604
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1601
01:37:50,663 --> 01:37:53,234
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1602
01:37:53,299 --> 01:37:55,643
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1603
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:58,342
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1604
01:37:58,438 --> 01:38:01,248
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

1605
01:38:29,869 --> 01:38:31,143
Mummy..

1606
01:38:35,441 --> 01:38:36,579
Mummy?

1607
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:40,352
Mithu, your daddy
won't be coming back.

1608
01:38:40,747 --> 01:38:41,782
He will never come back.

1609
01:38:43,082 --> 01:38:45,187
No, Mummy. He will come back.

1610
01:38:45,551 --> 01:38:47,394
He will come back for sure.

1611
01:38:47,453 --> 01:38:48,523
Don't lose hope.

1612
01:38:48,855 --> 01:38:50,300
Don't lose hope, my dear.

1613
01:38:50,523 --> 01:38:51,627
Be smart.

1614
01:38:53,292 --> 01:38:55,363
I tried being smart
by sending Sukhi away.

1615
01:38:57,797 --> 01:38:59,208
But what did I gain?

1616
01:38:59,265 --> 01:39:02,212
What happened, Subedar Sahib?

1617
01:39:03,536 --> 01:39:06,312
We had gone to DC's office.

1618
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:13,179
The lists that came from Iraq..

1619
01:39:13,413 --> 01:39:15,484
Sukhi's name is not in there.

1620
01:39:15,681 --> 01:39:18,787
Hey, that's good news.

1621
01:39:19,719 --> 01:39:21,289
You shouldn't lose hope.

1622
01:39:23,456 --> 01:39:24,628
Master. .

1623
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:28,636
Today, I met a boy who was with Sukhi.

1624
01:39:30,763 --> 01:39:33,744
He came back yesterday.

1625
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:36,442
He was in a bad state.

1626
01:39:37,737 --> 01:39:41,651
He said he met Sukhi six months ago.

1627
01:39:41,841 --> 01:39:44,082
He wasn't in a good condition.

1628
01:39:44,744 --> 01:39:46,815
That boy said that..

1629
01:39:49,215 --> 01:39:52,128
It's no use having unnecessary hope.

1630
01:39:53,219 --> 01:39:54,789
I won't talk to God.

1631
01:39:55,088 --> 01:39:56,192
Don't say that.

1632
01:39:56,322 --> 01:39:57,801
You shouldn't say such things.

1633
01:39:57,857 --> 01:39:59,097
God will set everything right.

1634
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:02,162
Papa, you will have to come back.

1635
01:40:02,328 --> 01:40:05,832
God, you will have
to send my father back.

1636
01:40:06,199 --> 01:40:07,473
Mithu.. Mithu!

1637
01:40:08,634 --> 01:40:10,545
With whose support should I live?

1638
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:12,741
I don't feel like living anymore.

1639
01:40:20,613 --> 01:40:21,648
Come in, Lala.

1640
01:40:21,714 --> 01:40:22,852
Coming.

1641
01:40:24,117 --> 01:40:25,323
Hello, sir.

1642
01:40:25,384 --> 01:40:27,227
Lala, he is the sir now.

1643
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,421
I am just an old man now.

1644
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:29,727
I think he's in a bad mood.

1645
01:40:29,856 --> 01:40:31,199
Hello, sir.

1646
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:33,566
Come, Lala. Where have you been'?
It's past noon already.

1647
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,332
Your son dialed the wrong number.

1648
01:40:35,528 --> 01:40:37,337
He came an hour late.

1649
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:40,234
After that,
he wasn't ready to leave my store.

1650
01:40:40,533 --> 01:40:43,309
Order me, I have to go
back to my business as well.

1651
01:40:43,503 --> 01:40:44,675
Okay. . - Yes'?

1652
01:40:45,071 --> 01:40:48,075
The musical ceremony on
the 13th will take place here.

1653
01:40:48,141 --> 01:40:48,812
Very well.

1654
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,313
I've given the arrangements
for the wedding to someone else.

1655
01:40:51,377 --> 01:40:52,355
You won't be able to handle it.

1656
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:55,085
To make it spicy all you
need to do is add chilies. - What?

1657
01:40:55,148 --> 01:40:57,185
Don't get angry. It's just a fact.
- Okay.

1658
01:40:57,316 --> 01:41:00,627
Mannat, I cannot see you
with anyone else other than Assi.

1659
01:41:00,753 --> 01:41:02,289
Come, I will give you some money.

1660
01:41:02,355 --> 01:41:05,302
Money? Give me Rs. 1 lakh or so?

1661
01:41:05,358 --> 01:41:07,599
Okay. We are like family.
Give me Rs. 50,000.

1662
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:09,104
Come with me. - Let's go.

1663
01:41:09,662 --> 01:41:10,606
Come in.

1664
01:41:11,864 --> 01:41:12,808
Pinku!

1665
01:41:14,567 --> 01:41:15,307
Pinku!

1666
01:41:16,802 --> 01:41:17,803
Pinku!

1667
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:19,479
Pinku!

1668
01:41:19,539 --> 01:41:20,609
What happened to him'? - Pinku!

1669
01:41:21,207 --> 01:41:22,515
Shall I go and get water? - Yes.

1670
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:24,449
Pinku!

1671
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:25,481
Pinku!

1672
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:26,880
What happened to him'?
- Son?

1673
01:41:27,146 --> 01:41:29,558
Pinku!
- Don't worry, son. I am here.

1674
01:41:29,849 --> 01:41:35,492
"It's seems like no one cares."

1675
01:41:35,721 --> 01:41:38,827
"Oh my heart, let's go away."

1676
01:41:39,091 --> 01:41:42,504
"Our love isn't valued here."

1677
01:41:42,595 --> 01:41:47,101
Assi.. what's wrong?
Why are you singing sad songs today?

1678
01:41:49,135 --> 01:41:50,773
Assi, look over there.

1679
01:41:52,605 --> 01:41:54,209
Our inspiration is walking towards us.

1680
01:41:56,275 --> 01:41:57,618
Lala.. - Yes'?

1681
01:41:58,110 --> 01:41:59,521
How are you'? - Fine.

1682
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:00,850
Where are you coming from'?

1683
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:02,558
From here. - From a wedding?

1684
01:42:02,815 --> 01:42:04,624
I had some work in
the neighboring village.

1685
01:42:04,784 --> 01:42:06,525
I got the pressure
relieve myself on the way.

1686
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:08,494
I thought I should do that as well.

1687
01:42:08,854 --> 01:42:10,856
I think you made a big deal.

1688
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:14,331
Sohi, you are asking
questions like a reporter.

1689
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,133
If you want to ask the
questions then go ahead.

1690
01:42:16,295 --> 01:42:19,105
Shamsher's son Pinku
had fainted today.

1691
01:42:19,398 --> 01:42:21,639
This isn't the first
time this happened.

1692
01:42:21,834 --> 01:42:24,508
He has been to the
hospital a number of times.

1693
01:42:25,104 --> 01:42:28,642
Shamsher's son is a known drug addict.

1694
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:30,548
Shall I share another
news with you'?

1695
01:42:30,676 --> 01:42:31,654
Don't say that I didn't
share it with you.

1696
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:34,155
Shamsher has fixed
his daughter's wedding.

1697
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:36,082
He has booked me as
the cook for the function..

1698
01:42:36,148 --> 01:42:37,718
...that is taking place on thirteenth.

1699
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:39,592
His daughter is getting
married on the fourteenth.

1700
01:42:40,419 --> 01:42:41,363
Move your cart.

1701
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,457
I think your can is stuck in a ditch.

1702
01:42:44,156 --> 01:42:46,158
Don't get angry. It's just a fact.

1703
01:42:51,831 --> 01:42:53,208
What's this for'?

1704
01:42:54,066 --> 01:42:57,479
Today is 14th February,
Valentine's day.

1705
01:42:57,837 --> 01:42:59,407
A day meant for lovers.

1706
01:42:59,572 --> 01:43:00,448
Really?

1707
01:43:01,507 --> 01:43:03,748
I swear on this lover's day.

1708
01:43:04,343 --> 01:43:07,222
I'll bring a wedding procession to
your house on the next 14th February.

1709
01:43:07,446 --> 01:43:15,160
"Oh my beloved, you shouldn't
leave someone like this."

1710
01:43:15,354 --> 01:43:21,737
"Oh my precious, you shouldn't
cheat someone like this."

1711
01:43:30,102 --> 01:43:35,108
"When someone lays
his heart at your feet."

1712
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:40,749
"When someone loves
you more than life."

1713
01:43:42,315 --> 01:43:46,195
"When someone lays
his heart at your feet."

1714
01:43:46,218 --> 01:43:50,394
"When someone loves
you more than life."

1715
01:43:50,823 --> 01:43:56,705
"You shouldn't push him away."

1716
01:43:56,762 --> 01:44:01,302
"You should fear God."

1717
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:07,781
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1718
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:14,257
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1719
01:44:14,313 --> 01:44:20,457
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1720
01:44:33,532 --> 01:44:39,676
"When someone is eagerly
waiting for you."

1721
01:44:39,739 --> 01:44:46,122
"When someone has
big dreams in his eyes."

1722
01:44:46,212 --> 01:44:52,060
"You shouldn't Whopper them."

1723
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:55,258
"You shouldn't lie to them."

1724
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:04,536
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1725
01:45:04,597 --> 01:45:11,139
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1726
01:45:11,203 --> 01:45:17,154
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1727
01:45:17,243 --> 01:45:23,455
"I have tolerated all
kind of pain for you."

1728
01:45:23,549 --> 01:45:29,659
"My eyes are wet,
you can come and see."

1729
01:45:30,089 --> 01:45:36,131
"What is my fault
if we got separated?"

1730
01:45:36,295 --> 01:45:43,213
"Fate has ruined me."

1731
01:45:45,738 --> 01:45:51,654
"When someone dwells
in your heart to survive."

1732
01:45:52,211 --> 01:45:58,253
"When someone is scared
of being separated from you."

1733
01:45:58,717 --> 01:46:01,357
"Being separated from you."

1734
01:46:01,587 --> 01:46:07,663
"When someone dwells
in your heart to survive."

1735
01:46:07,827 --> 01:46:14,176
"When someone is scared
of being separated from you."

1736
01:46:14,233 --> 01:46:20,411
"When someone lives
only to see you smile."

1737
01:46:20,473 --> 01:46:24,478
"You shouldn't fight with him."

1738
01:46:25,277 --> 01:46:31,193
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1739
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:37,828
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1740
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:44,664
"Oh my life, you shouldn't do this."

1741
01:46:47,399 --> 01:46:49,242
They took the tractor
just a few days ago.

1742
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:51,515
I hope they don't take my bike away.

1743
01:46:54,406 --> 01:46:57,717
Oh my.. people from
Speed Records at my place?

1744
01:46:58,177 --> 01:46:59,178
Amazing.

1745
01:47:00,312 --> 01:47:01,256
Hello. - Hello.

1746
01:47:01,447 --> 01:47:02,517
Mr. Dinesh. - Hello.

1747
01:47:02,648 --> 01:47:03,592
Hello - Hello.

1748
01:47:03,849 --> 01:47:05,829
You had come to Jalandhar
to meet us. - Yes.

1749
01:47:05,885 --> 01:47:07,364
Now we have come to meet you.

1750
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,624
Your song is a hit, brother.

1751
01:47:08,721 --> 01:47:09,756
You will become a star.

1752
01:47:10,189 --> 01:47:11,190
Thank you, God.

1753
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:14,503
You are destined to get cars
bungalows and wealth, my brother.

1754
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,435
The world is waiting for you.

1755
01:47:16,595 --> 01:47:18,541
Here are the keys to the car.
As a gift. - Okay.

1756
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:21,771
But you will have to
sign three years' contract.

1757
01:47:22,167 --> 01:47:23,874
Tell me where I need to sign, but..

1758
01:47:24,169 --> 01:47:24,704
What?

1759
01:47:24,904 --> 01:47:26,611
But there is one thing
more important than cars..

1760
01:47:26,872 --> 01:47:28,283
Tell us what you want, sir.

1761
01:47:28,407 --> 01:47:29,681
I will tell you.

1762
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:32,583
First, let me give my first autograph
to the Speed Records. - Okay.

1763
01:47:42,354 --> 01:47:43,628
Wonderful.

1764
01:47:44,356 --> 01:47:46,836
Master! You brought a car!
- Congratulations, Gurmukh.

1765
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:50,101
Auntie, today I have
come to congratulate you.

1766
01:47:50,296 --> 01:47:51,104
I don't understand.

1767
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:52,200
Then let me explain.

1768
01:47:52,364 --> 01:47:57,177
Please welcome Mr.
Dilar Singh Sohi's two sons.

1769
01:47:59,572 --> 01:48:00,380
There you go.

1770
01:48:00,573 --> 01:48:02,382
Congratulations to
Assi's mother and father.

1771
01:48:02,675 --> 01:48:03,551
What do you mean?

1772
01:48:03,809 --> 01:48:06,688
It means this car belongs to you.

1773
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:08,224
And this tractor
already belonged to you.

1774
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:11,651
What happened, auntie?

1775
01:48:12,585 --> 01:48:16,499
Assi, it's time to offer
sweets and auntie wants medicines.

1776
01:48:16,589 --> 01:48:18,660
That's why we don't hit jackpots.

1777
01:48:18,757 --> 01:48:20,259
I'll go and take
the tractor for a spin.

1778
01:48:20,326 --> 01:48:24,274
"Sometimes like this..
Sometimes like that."

1779
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:27,675
"Give me a hug, father.
Extend your hands."

1780
01:48:27,766 --> 01:48:29,643
"Come on, give me a hug."

1781
01:48:30,836 --> 01:48:34,113
People are not honest
while selling milk.

1782
01:48:34,673 --> 01:48:37,449
How do you expect me to
be honest while selling drugs?

1783
01:48:39,244 --> 01:48:42,657
We don't force anyone's
child into taking drugs.

1784
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:47,488
No one will become a martyr
by dying because of drug overdose.

1785
01:48:48,354 --> 01:48:52,734
Listen, Pinku will be there
in half an hour with the delivery.

1786
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:55,331
He just has to deliver them to you.

1787
01:48:56,195 --> 01:48:57,674
After that, it is your responsibility.

1788
01:49:02,134 --> 01:49:02,839
Take care of these things.

1789
01:49:08,607 --> 01:49:10,644
Pinku! Pinku!

1790
01:49:10,709 --> 01:49:12,620
Pinku! Pinku!

1791
01:49:12,645 --> 01:49:14,420
Dad! - What happened?

1792
01:49:14,647 --> 01:49:17,457
Dad, you said that you will save me.

1793
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:19,596
My child.. - I don't want to die, Dad.

1794
01:49:19,652 --> 01:49:21,222
I don't want to die.

1795
01:49:21,387 --> 01:49:23,560
Dad.. Save me, Dad. Please.

1796
01:49:23,889 --> 01:49:24,765
<i>N..</i>

1797
01:49:26,492 --> 01:49:27,493
Save me, Dad.

1798
01:49:27,793 --> 01:49:29,466
L.. - Pinku! Pinku!

1799
01:49:31,730 --> 01:49:32,538
My child.

1800
01:49:32,598 --> 01:49:33,838
Father!

1801
01:49:35,834 --> 01:49:36,710
Pinku...!

1802
01:49:39,171 --> 01:49:39,740
Pinku, my child!

1803
01:49:40,305 --> 01:49:41,147
Son..

1804
01:49:41,507 --> 01:49:42,315
Son..

1805
01:49:43,842 --> 01:49:45,651
Pinku! Pinku!

1806
01:49:46,178 --> 01:49:48,124
Pinku!

1807
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:57,360
'Your illicit business and
tormenting ways will make you repent.'

1808
01:49:57,556 --> 01:49:59,092
'We have no respect
left in this village.'

1809
01:49:59,224 --> 01:50:02,103
'Only brave people
like me can do such work.'

1810
01:50:02,795 --> 01:50:06,265
'Your village's useless
people can only talk.'

1811
01:50:07,733 --> 01:50:09,872
'And what respect
are you talking about?'

1812
01:50:10,469 --> 01:50:12,881
'You couldn't even invite
the village chief at my wedding.'

1813
01:50:13,472 --> 01:50:17,887
'When you will die, the C.M.
will come, father.'

1814
01:51:01,754 --> 01:51:05,600
Shera, brace yourself.

1815
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,262
We cannot go against His wishes.

1816
01:51:21,306 --> 01:51:23,377
I killed him, Dilar.

1817
01:51:23,742 --> 01:51:26,518
I killed my son, Dilar.

1818
01:51:27,346 --> 01:51:29,519
I used to sell drugs to others.

1819
01:51:29,782 --> 01:51:33,753
Those very drugs killed my son.

1820
01:51:33,819 --> 01:51:37,790
My brother.. - Drugs killed my son.

1821
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:45,106
I killed my son.
- We cannot go against His will.

1822
01:52:15,527 --> 01:52:16,403
No.

1823
01:52:20,499 --> 01:52:21,477
Gurmukh..

1824
01:52:39,384 --> 01:52:40,454
No.

1825
01:52:43,388 --> 01:52:44,560
Yes.

1826
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:48,167
Bani..

1827
01:52:49,795 --> 01:52:51,433
I am your culprit.

1828
01:52:52,831 --> 01:52:54,833
I killed both of you.

1829
01:52:56,835 --> 01:52:58,815
You and my daughter.

1830
01:53:02,274 --> 01:53:04,151
I don't want to live
alone anymore, Bani.

1831
01:53:07,145 --> 01:53:09,216
I want to be with the two of you.

1832
01:53:09,848 --> 01:53:11,225
You are great.

1833
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:18,692
You are ending God's gift
of life without fully utilizing it.

1834
01:53:24,529 --> 01:53:26,440
L.. - Gurmukh..

1835
01:53:28,367 --> 01:53:29,846
I have not gone anywhere.

1836
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:33,250
I am alive in you.

1837
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:39,254
Don't kill me by killing yourself.

1838
01:53:41,413 --> 01:53:46,795
What happened with me,
it was God's will.. - Bani.

1839
01:53:49,121 --> 01:53:51,101
Everyone is subject to His Command.

1840
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:53,736
No one is beyond His Command.

1841
01:53:56,328 --> 01:54:01,107
Gurmukh, learn to live
and teach others how to live.

1842
01:54:03,135 --> 01:54:04,637
Let go of your silence.

1843
01:54:06,538 --> 01:54:08,449
Don't hang on to my shadows.

1844
01:54:10,108 --> 01:54:13,646
Instead,
you should recognize Bani's soul.

1845
01:54:14,546 --> 01:54:16,389
You should seek refuge
in the soulful Gurbani.

1846
01:54:19,484 --> 01:54:20,656
You will, won't you'?

1847
01:54:25,157 --> 01:54:26,397
Yes.

1848
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:28,331
Yes. Yes.

1849
01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:39,612
She..

1850
01:54:40,372 --> 01:54:44,184
She is my daughter.

1851
01:54:54,219 --> 01:54:56,221
Your <i>papa-</i>

1852
01:54:56,755 --> 01:54:58,359
My child.

1853
01:55:27,219 --> 01:55:29,563
Follow Baba Nanak's Bani..

1854
01:56:16,334 --> 01:56:19,679
"Oh Omnipotent Fakir, you are great."

1855
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:25,620
"Only you know what's in your mind."

1856
01:56:27,746 --> 01:56:34,391
"You make some pick glasses
and make some pick pearls."

1857
01:56:34,453 --> 01:56:37,832
"Oh Omnipotent Fakir, you are great."

1858
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:40,798
"Only you know what's in your mind."

1859
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:44,436
"Oh Omnipotent Fakir, you are great."

1860
01:56:44,496 --> 01:56:48,410
"Only you know what's in your mind."

1861
01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:12,568
"This person dances in your worship."

1862
01:57:14,826 --> 01:57:21,402
"He is your follower down here."

1863
01:57:24,736 --> 01:57:28,582
"You protect everyone."

1864
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,484
"This person is made of raw glass."

1865
01:57:31,543 --> 01:57:37,789
Shamsher, you won't might like it,
I want to say something.

1866
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:42,423
Dilar, I won't stop you.
You can do as you please.

1867
01:57:43,822 --> 01:57:47,099
"Oh Omnipotent Fakir, you are great."

1868
01:57:47,159 --> 01:57:50,572
"Only you know what's in your mind."

1869
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:19,362
"He makes some follow someone.."

1870
01:58:22,327 --> 01:58:24,466
God, make the barren land flourish.

1871
01:58:24,529 --> 01:58:26,133
Amazing.

1872
01:58:26,898 --> 01:58:27,672
Yes.

1873
01:58:27,866 --> 01:58:31,143
Agyapal Singh is getting
married on 14th February.

1874
01:58:31,536 --> 01:58:32,606
He's invites you for
festivities from today itself.

1875
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:35,151
Well done, my boy.

1876
01:58:36,308 --> 01:58:44,557
"How the stars change their position,
oh Lord!"

1877
01:58:44,616 --> 01:58:47,859
"Oh Omnipotent Fakir, you are great."

1878
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:51,157
"Only you know what's in your mind."

1879
01:58:51,223 --> 01:58:54,534
"Oh Omnipotent Fakir, you are great."

1880
01:58:54,593 --> 01:58:58,336
"Only you know what's in your mind."

1881
01:59:08,106 --> 01:59:10,677
Snake, can you eat all those sweets?

1882
01:59:10,742 --> 01:59:12,722
You are talking about sweets?

1883
01:59:12,844 --> 01:59:15,518
Let him loose and he will
put his head directly inside the wok.

1884
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:16,490
Right. - No, no, no.

1885
01:59:16,548 --> 01:59:19,893
Right. Do it. I will click your photo.

1886
01:59:20,685 --> 01:59:23,825
Hello, if you click the photo you
will have to upload it on Facebook.

1887
01:59:23,888 --> 01:59:25,128
Okay. - For sure.

1888
01:59:25,190 --> 01:59:25,759
We will. - For sure?

1889
01:59:25,824 --> 01:59:28,168
Tell me then, what will be the status?

1890
01:59:28,226 --> 01:59:30,433
Master will decide that today.

1891
01:59:30,528 --> 01:59:31,302
Tell us, Master.

1892
01:59:31,363 --> 01:59:32,205
Yes, tell us. - Yes, tell us.

1893
01:59:32,264 --> 01:59:33,208
Tell us, Master.

1894
01:59:33,331 --> 01:59:36,801
If you put your face inside
the wok and eat the sweets.. - Yes.

1895
01:59:37,068 --> 01:59:38,342
Then there can be only one status.

1896
01:59:38,403 --> 01:59:39,108
What?

1897
01:59:39,371 --> 01:59:40,372
Dogs eating sweets.

1898
01:59:42,274 --> 01:59:43,582
You too, Master?

1899
01:59:43,775 --> 01:59:45,516
Hold on, let's ask Master.

1900
01:59:47,279 --> 01:59:48,383
Master? - Yes.

1901
01:59:48,513 --> 01:59:51,426
We can drink some alcohol
during the wedding can't we?

1902
01:59:53,184 --> 01:59:54,595
Why are you questioning
me since morning'?

1903
01:59:54,653 --> 01:59:56,155
I told you, once you leave it,
you leave it forever.

1904
01:59:56,354 --> 01:59:57,332
We won't drink.

1905
01:59:57,389 --> 01:59:59,562
I can ask about dancing.

1906
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:01,831
We can dance, can't we?
- Ask politely.

1907
02:00:02,494 --> 02:00:04,132
Have you not attended a
wedding where there is no dancing'?

1908
02:00:04,195 --> 02:00:05,265
Behave yourself and
attend the wedding.

1909
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:07,710
I just saw at you for no reason,
Lottery.

1910
02:00:07,832 --> 02:00:09,834
When will you dance
if not at a wedding?

1911
02:00:11,436 --> 02:00:13,677
Let's dance!
- Let's go and dance.

1912
02:00:13,838 --> 02:00:16,614
"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1913
02:00:16,675 --> 02:00:19,451
"Never try to divide and
rule in your village, brother."

1914
02:00:19,511 --> 02:00:23,288
"Never try to divide
and rule in your village."

1915
02:00:30,755 --> 02:00:34,328
"Never let your friends down."

1916
02:00:34,392 --> 02:00:36,804
Hey, what's this noise?

1917
02:00:37,629 --> 02:00:41,543
Don't you know that loud
music disturbs the discipline?

1918
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,136
Idiots.

1919
02:00:44,602 --> 02:00:46,240
Listen to the songs
that they are playing.

1920
02:00:46,738 --> 02:00:49,446
It's an auspicious occasion.
Play that son.

1921
02:00:50,275 --> 02:00:52,448
"Oh DJ, play my song."

1922
02:00:53,812 --> 02:00:58,318
"Hey DJ play my favorite song"

1923
02:00:58,383 --> 02:01:00,385
"Hey DJ play my favorite song"

1924
02:01:00,452 --> 02:01:02,329
"Play my song"

1925
02:01:02,354 --> 02:01:06,700
"Hey DJ play my favorite song"

1926
02:01:06,725 --> 02:01:12,334
"We are about to apply the kohl.."

1927
02:01:12,697 --> 02:01:16,372
Brother-in-law, tell me, how
much will you give to apply the Kohl?

1928
02:01:16,735 --> 02:01:18,214
Yes, yes, yes.

1929
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:19,872
Yes, yes'? What yes'?

1930
02:01:20,271 --> 02:01:21,545
Tell me, how much will you give me?

1931
02:01:21,606 --> 02:01:23,517
Around Rs. 125,000.

1932
02:01:23,708 --> 02:01:26,621
Rs. 125,000?

1933
02:01:26,745 --> 02:01:29,282
Do you want to kill your sister-in-law
with such kind of a joke?

1934
02:01:29,347 --> 02:01:29,882
What did I say'?

1935
02:01:30,148 --> 02:01:31,388
Didn't you say that
you'd give her Rs. 125000?

1936
02:01:31,449 --> 02:01:33,156
I was booking a wedding show.

1937
02:01:33,685 --> 02:01:37,497
Hey Mr. Minister,
first finish your wedding. - Yes.

1938
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:02,223
Snake?

1939
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,786
Why are sitting here.

1940
02:02:05,183 --> 02:02:07,789
This isn't your borrow.
This is my son.

1941
02:02:08,286 --> 02:02:09,094
Sit properly.

1942
02:02:09,154 --> 02:02:10,792
It's okay. I will extract his poison.

1943
02:02:11,089 --> 02:02:12,693
Hey bed of snake, behave. - Mother!

1944
02:02:12,757 --> 02:02:14,430
Mother! - Yes'?

1945
02:02:14,492 --> 02:02:17,234
How much do I pay my sisters-in-law
for cutting the ribbon?

1946
02:02:17,462 --> 02:02:20,306
Your father gave your
aunties only Rs. 100.

1947
02:02:20,465 --> 02:02:21,842
My father flunked in the fifth grade.

1948
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:25,138
I am close to graduation
and a famous singer.

1949
02:02:25,403 --> 02:02:27,747
Then you can give Rs. 151, son.

1950
02:02:27,806 --> 02:02:31,117
I am to give them money to cut
the ribbon and not the toll charges.

1951
02:02:31,176 --> 02:02:32,211
Give them whatever you want.
- Okay. Get inside.

1952
02:02:32,343 --> 02:02:35,187
You should have come on your buffalo.

1953
02:02:35,246 --> 02:02:38,193
Subedar Sahib,
if I had seen your tank.

1954
02:02:38,249 --> 02:02:39,785
...I would have come on a calf instead.

1955
02:02:40,051 --> 02:02:41,689
Amazing.

1956
02:02:42,287 --> 02:02:45,427
I have heard your buffalo
growl a number of times.

1957
02:02:45,723 --> 02:02:48,135
This is the first time
I have heard you talk.

1958
02:02:48,359 --> 02:02:49,633
My name is Ronak Singh.

1959
02:02:50,528 --> 02:02:52,337
She is my granddaughter. Jyoti.

1960
02:02:52,797 --> 02:02:58,076
Her silence had silenced me as well.
- Oh. okay.

1961
02:02:58,470 --> 02:03:01,280
So Jyoti is your granddaughter.

1962
02:03:01,339 --> 02:03:02,818
Yes, she is mine.

1963
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:07,156
Cancer killed her mother, my daughter.

1964
02:03:07,579 --> 02:03:11,618
Her father's family left her
to me when she was just an infant.

1965
02:03:11,683 --> 02:03:15,187
Now it is my duty to look after her.

1966
02:03:15,386 --> 02:03:17,229
No more a single, brother.

1967
02:03:17,288 --> 02:03:20,167
I am getting Lottery
engaged to my sister-in-law.

1968
02:03:20,658 --> 02:03:22,137
It will cost you Rs. 51000.

1969
02:03:22,193 --> 02:03:23,137
But I am your brother.

1970
02:03:23,194 --> 02:03:25,731
One can only feed
free tea to a brother.

1971
02:03:25,797 --> 02:03:27,743
You cannot forgo
a brother-in-law's fees.

1972
02:03:27,765 --> 02:03:29,540
I agree. - Look over there.
They are cracking jokes over there.

1973
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:30,545
Mr. Sohi!

1974
02:03:30,602 --> 02:03:32,081
Let's take the wedding
procession on time.

1975
02:03:32,136 --> 02:03:34,082
Otherwise, all the dry fruits
for the guests will get over.

1976
02:03:34,138 --> 02:03:36,118
You are standing here and blabbering.

1977
02:03:36,174 --> 02:03:39,087
It is your brother's wedding.
Do you knees hurt'? Go and dance.

1978
02:03:39,143 --> 02:03:42,352
Okay, then play the music
which is loved by everyone. Khamcila.

1979
02:03:42,413 --> 02:03:43,414
It's Chamkila.

1980
02:05:06,831 --> 02:05:08,174
Mithu!

1981
02:05:08,499 --> 02:05:09,477
Mithu!

1982
02:05:09,601 --> 02:05:10,705
Where did he go'?

1983
02:07:04,615 --> 02:07:07,596
Shamsher,
now both the house belongs to her.

1984
02:07:08,252 --> 02:07:10,163
You can come over whenever you want.

1985
02:07:11,556 --> 02:07:15,299
Okay then, let's take Lord's
name and get going from here.

1986
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:16,599
Not like this, Master.

1987
02:07:16,661 --> 02:07:18,868
Here. Take a handful of them.

1988
02:07:20,364 --> 02:07:23,538
No, Mr. Sohi, this is your right.

1989
02:07:23,634 --> 02:07:24,476
No, no, no.

1990
02:07:24,502 --> 02:07:25,640
The one who taught what life..

1991
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:27,206
...means comes before
the one who gave him life.

1992
02:07:28,339 --> 02:07:29,909
Go ahead. - As you wish.

1993
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:19,824
You saw I didn't let
my determination go weak.

1994
02:08:20,825 --> 02:08:24,830
Baba Nanak's words
and prayers are great, sir.

1995
02:08:28,132 --> 02:08:30,635
Sukhi, my child.

1996
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:35,546
My son..

1997
02:08:35,606 --> 02:08:37,677
My child, my son, where were you'?

1998
02:08:38,609 --> 02:08:40,680
Where were you'?

1999
02:08:50,788 --> 02:08:51,630
Master?

2000
02:08:54,592 --> 02:09:00,508
Master, I've come back
from a place where even death..

2001
02:09:01,232 --> 02:09:02,768
...must be surprised how I escaped.

2002
02:09:04,101 --> 02:09:05,239
I had lost all hope.

2003
02:09:08,172 --> 02:09:10,243
But your prayers won.

2004
02:09:11,876 --> 02:09:14,516
You are the True Master,
Your Praise is so beautiful.

2005
02:09:15,246 --> 02:09:17,283
One who sings it, is carried across.

2006
02:09:18,316 --> 02:09:20,660
Nanak speaks the stories
of the creator Lord..

2007
02:09:21,385 --> 02:09:23,888
...whatever He is to do, He does.

2008
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:29,661
Are you happy now, sister?

2009
02:09:30,795 --> 02:09:31,603
Yes, brother.

2010
02:09:32,396 --> 02:09:33,739
You are great, Oh Lord.

2011
02:09:34,131 --> 02:09:35,508
We had come here to
take a daughter-in-law.

2012
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:37,373
But Lord Almighty also
sent our son-in-law back.

2013
02:09:39,136 --> 02:09:40,809
Now let me see who doesn't dance!

2014
02:09:41,072 --> 02:09:42,517
Dance!

2015
02:09:51,716 --> 02:09:54,162
Yes, mother.
Hello. I seek your blessings.

2016
02:09:54,352 --> 02:09:55,763
You forgot me, Gurmukh.

2017
02:09:57,421 --> 02:09:58,456
When will you come back'?

2018
02:09:59,457 --> 02:10:01,198
I cannot forget, mother.

2019
02:10:01,859 --> 02:10:05,773
I still haven't forgotten
the ones who left me forever.

2020
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:07,673
Please forgive your mother, son.

2021
02:10:08,299 --> 02:10:10,472
Even mothers forgive their children.

2022
02:10:11,369 --> 02:10:12,814
Are you so upset with me, son'?

2023
02:10:14,205 --> 02:10:16,412
Mother, I have to join a new school.

2024
02:10:17,541 --> 02:10:20,215
I'll get back to you after I join it.
I'll pay you a visit.

2025
02:10:21,112 --> 02:10:23,592
Your nieces miss you, son.

2026
02:10:25,116 --> 02:10:28,563
They are here. I brought them back.

2027
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,121
Really?

2028
02:10:32,123 --> 02:10:33,295
Okay, mother.

2029
02:10:33,724 --> 02:10:35,135
Then start making stuff breads.

2030
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,333
I'll first come and meet you.

2031
02:10:41,732 --> 02:10:43,609
I have a prayer to make.

2032
02:10:44,168 --> 02:10:46,307
Don't leave anything to fate.

2033
02:10:46,837 --> 02:10:48,839
Pray for everyone's happiness.

2034
02:10:49,173 --> 02:10:50,652
Give happiness to those who are sad.

2035
02:10:51,075 --> 02:10:54,386
Save water and nourish
plants like they are your own.

2036
02:10:54,712 --> 02:10:58,592
Seek refuge in Gurbani
to know the meaning of life.

2037
02:10:58,649 --> 02:11:00,526
Never speak ill with a daughter.

2038
02:11:00,818 --> 02:11:02,456
Do your deed and share with everyone.

2039
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:04,864
Yours' truly, Gurmukh Singh.

2040
02:11:06,791 --> 02:11:12,798
Assi, let's click a
selfie with Master's prayer.

2041
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:14,639
Okay. - We will upload it on Facebook.

2042
02:11:14,732 --> 02:11:17,576
Okay. - What will be the status?

2043
02:11:17,868 --> 02:11:22,681
We all will be writing
"Miss you, master!"

2044
02:11:23,808 --> 02:11:26,721
Come on. Come. Sit down.

2045
02:11:28,746 --> 02:11:30,191
Smile!

2046
02:11:44,562 --> 02:11:47,202
These aren't just images.

2047
02:11:47,264 --> 02:11:49,437
They are residents of Punjab.

2048
02:11:49,834 --> 02:11:52,280
Some have endured the 1947 mayhem.

2049
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:55,210
And some have endured 1984.

2050
02:11:55,506 --> 02:11:57,850
Today, they endure suicides.

2051
02:11:58,309 --> 02:12:00,482
They endure politics.

2052
02:12:00,778 --> 02:12:03,554
Those who were once joyful,
playful, carefree..

2053
02:12:03,781 --> 02:12:06,318
Now endure sorrow.

2054
02:12:06,751 --> 02:12:10,358
Isolated streets, scared hearts.

2055
02:12:10,488 --> 02:12:13,469
Someone stop this catastrophe.

2056
02:12:13,724 --> 02:12:16,728
There might come a time you
might yearn for a son or a daughter..

2057
02:12:16,794 --> 02:12:19,274
Oh people of Punjab.

2058
02:12:27,371 --> 02:12:32,371
"A broken glass can be mended."

2059
02:12:43,354 --> 02:12:48,354
"Sorrows can also fade away."

2060
02:12:56,333 --> 02:13:04,548
"But you have to keep the hope alive."

2061
02:13:05,342 --> 02:13:10,342
"Lord Almighty can read your heart."

2062
02:13:17,655 --> 02:13:26,234
"If you pray from the
bottom of your heart."

2063
02:13:26,831 --> 02:13:29,831
"If you pray from the
bottom of your heart."

2064
