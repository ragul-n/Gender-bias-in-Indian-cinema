1
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:37,430
''These moments, these memories,
l'll cherish for years to come''

2
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:45,039
''Should these seasons go away,
l'll complain''

3
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:52,875
''l'll remember these moments
for years to come''

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:01:00,053
''lf these seasons go away,
l'll complain''

5
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,475
Don't they suffer the heat, Daija?

6
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,675
Stop the car.
-Why Daija?

7
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,145
What are you doing?

8
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,853
Come. You also get down.

9
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,830
Get down.

10
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,129
But it's a desert!
- Bow to this land.

11
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,732
Bow? What for?

12
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,136
Because you're here
for the first time.

13
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,370
This is the threshhold
of your house.

14
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,147
Won't just folding my hands do?
The ground must be very hot.

15
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,945
Okay, okay, don't look like that.

16
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,554
l said, bow to it.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,468
Sit down, sit down. There is no escape
from this.

18
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,443
You used to pine for this desert
out there?

19
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,880
This is not just a desert.

20
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,515
Just look around, it's full
of your family's legends

21
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:36,988
Legends don't have to bear the heat.
Else, they'd get a sun-stroke too!

22
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,221
Keep quiet.

23
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:45,190
Just see, they are sitting as though
this desert is air-conditioned!

24
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,666
What stuff are these
people made of?

25
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,935
They are made out of
the local soil.

26
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,603
They're as seasoned as
the tree above them.

27
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,541
Papa migrated before
l was born, else...

28
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,215
When this sun seasons you too
in a couple of days,...

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,479
and when it narrates to you the
unlimited legends of your ancestors...

30
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,487
you too will be happy.

31
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,126
After signing the papers,...

32
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,232
l'll catch the first flight
to London.

33
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,735
As you command.

34
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,499
Don't use that tone with me, please.
l feel as though you're scolding me!

35
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,774
l am scolding you!

36
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:34,903
Okay, l'll do my work,
bow to the land...

37
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,250
seek your permission,
then go away. Happy?

38
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,720
Forget all that for now.

39
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:46,650
Your talk has moved the
mansion itself to hug you!

40
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:06,340
Greetings - Greetings - Greetings
- Greetings - Come, Let's go.

41
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,195
His Lordship has
certainly grown up!

42
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,088
This is the caretaker
of this place. Mr. Tiwari.

43
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,698
What's all this farce?
- Tradition, son.

44
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:40,307
Your father went abroad, but your
parents' portraits hang here.

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,648
Parents don't have feet,
you see...

46
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,485
Can l remove this garland now?

47
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,247
Our neighbour, Mr. Thakur is here. -Okay.

48
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,760
Who is he?

49
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,890
He's not just a neighbour, but
a very good friend of your father.

50
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,895
When the world had deserted him,
this man stood firmly by him.

51
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,202
Don't just greet him casually,
but bow to him,...

52
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,637
and address him respectfully, come.

53
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:36,363
When kids grow, their place is not
at one's feet. lt's in one's heart.

54
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:46,368
l've come here after 18 years today.
Just to embrace you, son.

55
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,552
l don't commit a faux pas, did l?

56
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,991
No. You just reminded him
of your father.

57
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,731
And the proud local men and women
don't let their tears be seen.

58
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,927
Come, l'll show you your room.

59
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:28,477
Y

60
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,791
''O dear clouds...''

61
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,731
''O dear clouds''

62
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,842
''Your heart is definitely yearning,
the way you're showering...''

63
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,739
''whom have you fallen
in love with?''

64
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,029
''O dear cloud...''

65
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:01,413
''My state is
somewhat like yours''

66
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,410
''Your state is
somewhat like theirs''

67
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:24,702
''Drench me in rains, O clouds''

68
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,437
''for someone has
uttered my name''

69
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,461
''O dear clouds...''

70
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,464
''O dear clouds''

71
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,065
''Tell us his name...
- No''

72
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,204
''Where does he live?''

73
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,212
''ls he a prince...?
Tell us''

74
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,652
''Spring has set in;
flowers blossom''

75
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:22,159
''Spring has set in;
flowers blossom''

76
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,511
''My friends say things that
make me blush; lower my gaze...''

77
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:50,511
''O dear clouds''

78
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,564
''Why am l longing?
Why is it raining?''

79
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,735
''Whom am l missing?''

80
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,582
''Why am l yearning...?''

81
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,991
What are you thinking of, son?

82
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,926
Of you.

83
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:11,066
Of me? l'm a thing of the past now.
Think of the days to come.

84
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't avoid the issue.
You brought me to my home.

85
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,735
But surely you have a home too.

86
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,944
You haven't talked about it
till today.

87
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,347
Yes. And that's strange, isn't it?
l had totally forgotten.

88
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:29,619
You have reminded me that l too
had a home once.

89
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:37,159
but so much time has gone by...
that l didn't even think of it.

90
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,033
lt's only your voice
that echoes in my ears.

91
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,229
May you live long, son.

92
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:13,492
''These moments, these memories,
l'll cherish for years to come''

93
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,101
''And if these seasons change,
l'll beg for them''

94
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:28,770
''These moments, these memories,
l'll cherish for years to come''

95
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:36,119
''And if these seasons change,
l'll beg for them''

96
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:48,857
Y

97
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:29,733
''From these glimpses
of my dreams...''

98
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,846
''from the bondage l share
with my memories...''

99
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:47,515
''how will l ever
set my heart free?''

100
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:55,090
''And if these seasons change,
l'll plead for them''

101
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,528
''These moments...''

102
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,272
What's the matter with you?

103
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,668
Nothing.

104
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,308
Do you remember that small boy
who used to tell me everything?

105
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,880
There's nothing to tell.

106
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,609
Then why are you sitting
in the dark like this?

107
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,481
l just thought somebody
would put the light on...

108
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,485
And suppose l hadn't, would you
have gone on sitting? Anyway...

109
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,590
you have to go to a dinner
at Mr. Thakur, remember?

110
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,899
l'm not in the mood.

111
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,565
lt's you who is invited,
not your mood.

112
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,699
You'll have to go. Come on.

113
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,640
Come my son, may you live long.

114
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,078
l can't tell you how happy l am
to see you here.

115
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,608
What happened?

116
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,407
Son is it burning too much?

117
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,749
lt's nothing serious.

118
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:28,949
You're great! lf l was in your shoes,
l'd have screamed this place down.

119
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,291
What's the fun in burning
without making a noise?

120
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,467
You know my name?

121
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,470
See what he's asking?

122
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:47,468
Whether you know us or not,
everybody out here knows you.

123
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,978
You're his Lordship from London.
And who am l?

124
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,985
l'm Pallavi.
- What are you...

125
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,584
And this uncle of yours,
l'm his only daughter.

126
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:03,757
Now don't say you're happy to meet me,
for it's all said and done.

127
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,329
You really made me wait.

128
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,730
Now he'll say,
he had a telephone call.

129
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,001
Sorry, but l got a call.

130
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,173
Just as l was through with that,
l got another call.

131
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,010
Just as l finished,
l got a call from the S.P.

132
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,814
l'm fed up with this telephone.
l think l'll have my line cut.

133
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,757
l'm really fed up with all this.
l'm thinking of having it disconnected.

134
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,828
He's a first class liar!
He's always like this.

135
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,027
And the funniest part is, everyone
knows he has no telephone!

136
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:02,850
''These moments,
l will remember for years''

137
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:10,053
''And when the seasons change,
l will complain''

138
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:17,859
''These moments,
l will cherish for years''

139
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:25,171
''lf the seasons change,
l will beg for them''

140
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,524
''Do not tease me, Lord Krishna''

141
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:54,595
''l'm only a milkmaid...
l'm not Radha''

142
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,837
''Do not tease me, Lord Krishna''

143
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:05,113
''l'm a milkmaid...
l'm not your beloved, Radha''

144
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,711
''Why have you held my hand?''

145
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,886
''l implore you, O Krishna''

146
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:48,159
''Why have you held my hand?''

147
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:53,153
''l implore you, O Krishna''

148
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,558
''You are naughty, O Krishna''

149
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:03,771
''l'm only a milkmaid...
l'm not your beloved Radha''

150
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,503
''Do not tease me, O Krishna''

151
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,865
''lt's Radha you always tease''

152
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,605
''She's the one you love''

153
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,882
''Why have you doused
those colours on me?''

154
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:52,221
''For l am only a milkmaid...
l'm not your Radha''

155
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,624
''Do not tease me, O Krishna''

156
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:02,962
''l'm only a milkmaid...
l'm not your Radha''

157
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,628
''Do not tease me, O Krishna''

158
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,780
Greetings.
- Bless you, son.

159
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,490
Please have this.

160
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,752
ls this the way to
accept a blessing?

161
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,963
Come on, bow to me first.

162
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,064
l know my name, Papa.

163
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,504
Come on, bow to me.
- How can he do that?

164
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,669
Why? Has he hurt his spine?
And l'm elder to him too.

165
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,179
And what are you gawking at?
Come on, bow to me.

166
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,442
Enough, my child.

167
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,852
Okay, cup your hand please.

168
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,180
The right one.

169
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,191
Better you open your mouth!

170
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,522
What are you looking at him for?
Forgot your mouth at home? Open it.

171
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,633
You couldn't have had your breakfast?
- No.

172
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,105
So have it with me.
- Daija won't forgive me, if l do.

173
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,040
She won't mind if it's with me.

174
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,579
He must have had all his
favorite dishes made.

175
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,612
''Spicy Bread''

176
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,055
My mouth's watering, dad...
l'm having my breakfast at his place.

177
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,921
You go ahead and get it all ready.
l'll join you there a little later.

178
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,130
l feel like having breakfast
on the terrace.

179
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,997
Terrace? But it's cloudy today.

180
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:54,342
That's wonderful! You keep it ready.
l'll just join you.

181
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,015
lf it starts raining,
how will you eat?

182
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,213
You'll just get wet
for nothing.

183
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:07,086
A superb breakfast. All these tasty
things and the rain falling...

184
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,362
Daija can really cook well.
- Here, have this...

185
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,763
l can eat by myself now.
l've grown up.

186
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,697
Everybody grows up.
But no one outgrows one's elders.

187
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,108
No dear, he has
really grown up now.

188
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,710
You have grown big, Sir.
lt's my hands that are small.

189
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,951
Your hand is bigger than the sky.

190
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,160
You haven't seen Rajasthan,
have you?

191
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,796
Daija, never showed it to me.
- How could l?

192
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,760
lt's his first visit here.

193
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,399
Then l'll make it
unforgettable for him.

194
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:57,207
l'll show him around and
get him stuck on to it,...

195
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,644
like glue on an envelope!

196
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,243
Anyway, it's a wet day today.
We'll make it tomorrow. Okay?

197
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,781
There's a man from
your house, Madam.

198
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,421
l'll take your leave then.
Be ready tomorrow, Viren.

199
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,087
Let the rain stop, my dear.
- lt's okay.

200
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,085
Be ready, Viren.

201
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,425
ls she the reason why you're so lost
in your thoughts these days?

202
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,835
Yes.

203
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,437
But she's older than you.

204
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,845
So what? l'm also younger to her.
lt's quits.

205
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:41,009
But such things are not
accepted in this country.

206
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,586
Does she love you just as much?

207
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,459
l don't know.

208
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,895
But you must know.

209
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,665
l'll ask her then.

210
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,203
What's this?
- Pallavi has sent it for you.

211
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,876
For me?

212
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,276
A letter too?

213
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,221
With due regards, to
His Lordship of London.

214
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,327
You must have seen such a dress
in the old portraits.

215
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,488
But this is the real attire
of our ancestors.

216
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,490
Play the Rajput just for today,
else you'll look like a tourist.

217
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,297
And Rajasthan will not be
one with you.

218
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,215
l'll look a fool in this!
- Your ancestors didn't!

219
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,247
But l'm not an ancestor.

220
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:54,321
But why tell me all this?
Return it. You can explain it to her.

221
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,158
No. l'll wear it.

222
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,906
l will come downstairs only if
you shut your eyes, Daija.

223
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,878
All right.

224
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:23,549
You must promise not to laugh at me.
- l promise. l will not laugh.

225
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,957
Even if l feel like it.

226
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,907
You promised you wouldn't laugh!

227
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,576
Didn't l say l'd look mad?
l'm not going!

228
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,703
No... you don't look mad at all.
You look handsome.

229
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,445
Hurry up and leave.
They must be awaiting you.

230
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,446
Go on.

231
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,246
Do l look good?
- Very good.

232
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,396
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. May we leave?

233
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,404
Have you brought the car?
- No, sir.

234
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,334
ln that case, l'll take my car.
- No, sir.

235
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,775
No? How will go?

236
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,012
l've brought a camel, sir.
- A camel!

237
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,962
Go on.

238
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,635
Are you okay, sir?

239
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,658
Make it stand.

240
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,662
Steady...

241
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,484
Nothing's going to happen.

242
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,221
When l'm sad, l go to this place
l'm taking you to.

243
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,366
What do you do when you're sad?
- But l'm never sad.

244
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,707
You will be sad
when you're lonely.

245
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:59,153
The song means, ''When the peacock
calls during the night...''

246
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:01,791
''it pierces my heart
like a dagger''

247
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:15,339
''When the pea-hen
calls at midnight,...''

248
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,848
''My bangles...''

249
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:26,414
''My bangles tinkle, O Sir...
they tinkle in my hands''

250
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:32,688
''When the pea-hen calls in
the jungle at midnight''

251
00:30:53,985 --> 00:31:05,795
''l literally die of shame,
when people listen to my love story''

252
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:19,442
''l literally die of shame when
people listen to my love story''

253
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:27,914
''lt was a slip of the tongue,
when l was chatting...''

254
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:35,385
''and then my bangles tinkled, O Sir,
they tinkled in my hands''

255
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:44,924
''As the pea-hen in the jungle
called out in the night''

256
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:17,362
''Whenever l see the moon in the sky,
my eyes overflow with tears''

257
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:33,277
''l don't know when my beloved left.
But l wilted within, over the years''

258
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:47,726
''l don't know when my beloved left.
But l wilted within, over the years''

259
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:55,564
''My thirst was never quenched
even by the rains''

260
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:03,010
''And my bangles tinkled, O Sir,
they tinkled in my hands...''

261
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,009
''as the pea-hen called
in the night''

262
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:38,048
''Nights l have spent
lonely and sleepless''

263
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:43,443
''l have been robbed
of my sleep''

264
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:59,069
''Nights l have spent
lonely and sleepless''

265
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:04,472
''l have been robbed
of my sleep''

266
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:12,072
''My peace of mind
has left with my beloved''

267
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:19,816
''And my bangles tinkled, O Sir.
The bangles tinkled in my hands...''

268
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:24,093
''as the pea-hen
called in the night''

269
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,411
This is Salamat Ali, Sir.
- Yes, go on.

270
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,546
l'm sorry, but we have
lost the case, Sir.

271
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:32,959
What? We lost the case?
But how? You said...

272
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,561
l tried my best, Sir, but...

273
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,893
But your best wasn't enough.

274
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:48,176
You just lost a case,
but l've lost everything.

275
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:56,186
My wealth, this mansion,
everything....

276
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,200
What's happened?
- Nothing, my dear.

277
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,861
l'll call the doctor.
You wait here, Viren, l'll just come.

278
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:22,006
Please sit.
l want to talk to you.

279
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,944
Nobody knows, except me.

280
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:36,716
l had a case against my step-brother,
concerning our property.

281
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,230
Today the court has
ruled against me.

282
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,238
l'm not bothered about myself
- You'll be fine, Sir.

283
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:53,236
Pallavi will just die,
if she gets to hear of it.

284
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,977
Look after her.
Explain it to her.

285
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,246
l can't keep her to
anybody else's care.

286
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,386
Nothing will happen...

287
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,021
l've sent for the doctor.

288
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,854
Come dear;
l want to tell you something.

289
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,664
Whatever l'm telling you...
- Don't talk, Papa...

290
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,273
l've explained it to Viren here.

291
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:32,879
l've entrusted your responsibility
in his hands.

292
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,875
What do you mean?

293
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,849
Trust him, child.

294
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,291
Please rest now.
Don't talk.

295
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:25,734
l'm very worried about her.
She hasn't eaten for the past 2 days.

296
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,898
She's like a stone, she won't talk
neither will she listen.

297
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,344
Please do something.

298
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:13,546
Where had you been?
l was awaiting you for ages!

299
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,196
Cry, dear...
Go ahead and cry.

300
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,945
What's this?

301
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:59,213
l didn't know my eyes
held so many tears.

302
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,484
Your father mustn't be
liking you cry like this.

303
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:08,657
l'm not used to living without him.
What shall l do?

304
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:13,025
Face the facts, and learn
to live without him.

305
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,510
But how did this happen?

306
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,010
l don't know. lt was all so sudden.

307
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:31,048
But whatever he had to tell,
he told Viren.

308
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,524
Who's he?

309
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,027
The son of our neighbour.

310
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,931
The one who was here yesterday?

311
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,535
Will you listen to something
l have to say, Viren?

312
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,267
Why ask? Have l ever refused
to obey you?

313
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:55,277
ln that case, you must return
to London today itself.

314
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,217
You're being unfair, Daija.

315
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,883
You wouldn't let me return,
when l wanted to.

316
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,891
And now that l don't want to leave,
you're asking me to go away.

317
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,059
l have promised her father.

318
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,087
Mr. Siddharth is here
to see his Lordship.

319
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,969
Tell him that l'll be there.

320
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,258
Everything is well
over there, l hope?

321
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,864
Can't really say, your Lordship.

322
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,597
Call me Vir, Mr. Bhatnagar.

323
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,798
That also sounds very formal.
Call me Siddharth.

324
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:07,415
l don't know whether Pallavi
has mentioned me to you before.

325
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,612
No. Nothing.

326
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,919
We love each other...

327
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:25,033
But my family background
is not as colourful as yours.

328
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,637
Does that make any difference?

329
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:32,435
Not to me, and maybe even you.
But her father was very orthodox.

330
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,141
lt was very important to him.

331
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,377
Let alone a background,
l don't even have a family!

332
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,650
But then, your name...

333
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,659
l'm told l was found on a street
and brought up in an orphanage.

334
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,663
When it was time for me
to go to school...

335
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,321
a father's name was essential.

336
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:00,659
The manager liked me a lot,
so he put his own name for me.

337
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:06,074
l was a good student, so l won
scholarships and continued to study.

338
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:12,682
This way, an orphan became an
officer in the Air-Force...

339
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,413
and at an Air-Force function,
l met Pallavi.

340
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,421
l was very scared
of my feelings for her.

341
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:26,486
But she's a special girl -
said it made no difference to her.

342
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,291
And that she'd managed her father.

343
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:36,700
He's no more, so l thought
why get married here?

344
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,208
May l take her with me?
We'll get married there.

345
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:51,312
lf you don't mind, we'd prefer
that she weds here.

346
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:55,054
And the bridal-couple leave
her ancestral home together.

347
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,732
Have you spoken to her
about the wedding?

348
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:07,199
l thought l'd talk to Viren
and then he'd convince her..

349
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:11,733
Don't worry about that
l'll talk to her myself.

350
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,482
This is Salamat Ali speaking.

351
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,754
Yes?

352
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:32,554
l've spoken to them, like you asked.
But they are very adamant.

353
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,090
Bring them to me.
l know how to deal with such lot.

354
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,767
Whose phone was it?

355
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,510
Give me a list of your invitees.
l'll invite them all.

356
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,580
There'll be just two from my side.
Daija and yourself.

357
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,447
l'll go now.

358
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,202
l didn't show him my feelings,
did l?

359
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,466
No, son.

360
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:24,604
This is the mother of the deceased
and they are his...

361
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,816
Step-brothers. My sons.

362
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,813
You know what l want.

363
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:34,486
How will we know what
exactly you want?

364
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,228
l don't want the result of this case
disclosed to the family here.

365
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:45,568
Pallavi will have to be told.
She has to vacate the house.

366
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:51,196
We're sorry that he died
just after hearing the news.

367
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,838
We didn't have the pleasure
of throwing him out physically..

368
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,840
But this bitch...

369
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:05,185
lf you say anything vile against them,
l'll pull your tongue out.

370
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,857
Now listen to me.

371
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,587
Till she leaves the house
with her husband,...

372
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:14,853
you are to stay away from here.

373
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,200
What will you give us for that?
- What's your price?

374
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,531
When will she leave?
- Next week.

375
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,270
That means 6 days from now.

376
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,400
That makes it 600,000.

377
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,881
And one more extra for the slap
you gave me.

378
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,892
Give them a cheque of one million.

379
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,702
Today all my efforts
have been worth it.

380
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,705
Today you've really matured.

381
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,033
Today l feel like addressing you
with your Title.

382
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,916
l have arrived.

383
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,289
How are you?
- Losing some hair...

384
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,432
How come you're here?

385
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,834
Then would there be a wedding
without me?

386
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,375
There's something l wanted
to discuss with you.

387
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,677
One moment...

388
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,288
Greetings!

389
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:49,720
My name is Prem.
l'm Viren's childhood friend.

390
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,028
When l was 7 year's old...

391
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,897
Greetings- Greetings.

392
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,909
The girl's superb. When are you getting
married my dear...

393
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,641
You've just come. Have a wash,
then we'll chat...

394
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:22,349
What a girl, What a choice...

395
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:28,998
l admit she's so lovely.
lt won't be easy to forget her.

396
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,661
But you should have told her
of your feelings, at least once.

397
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,528
What difference would that have made?
She'd have loved her guy anyway.

398
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,107
Well, it's not the end
of the world!

399
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:41,006
Who knows?

400
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,171
But you....

401
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,677
There are no ''ifs''
and ''buts'' in love.

402
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:53,755
And before loving her, l hadn't put
a condition that she loves me too.

403
00:49:55,392 --> 00:50:02,355
She loved Siddharth, she'll be
happy with him. That's all l want.

404
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,367
May God save you
from the evil-eye.

405
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:14,200
You always were beautiful. But never
as beautiful as you look today.

406
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,444
l miss my father very much.

407
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,643
That you will, all your life.

408
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,756
He always said he'd go
as ''dowry'' with you.

409
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,791
Now his memories are your dowry.

410
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,429
No, don't cry.

411
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,066
May God give you
a long happy life.

412
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,271
What's wrong with Viren?
He hasn't met me for days.

413
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:53,413
He's very busy with the preparations.
He's your care-taker now.

414
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,087
Tell him that l won't leave
without meeting him.

415
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,090
lf l see him,
l'll give him your message.

416
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,095
''This kurta that's
made of muslin...''

417
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,135
''come dressed in it''

418
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:22,101
''l await you at the door.
Come dressed in a muslin kurta...''

419
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,117
l was told you were
asking for me...

420
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,862
l don't know whether my father
was happy with my choice.

421
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:53,869
But since l'm in your charge...
tell me, do you approve?

422
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,341
Why not?

423
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:01,448
Questions are not answered
by counter questioning.

424
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:05,221
Are you happy?

425
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:07,985
Yes.

426
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,760
Then l am too.

427
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,765
l've been very bad to you.
l've really harassed you.

428
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,670
What nonsense!

429
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,174
You're very nice,
very decent.

430
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,776
lf l can ever be of help,
write to me.

431
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,181
Can l?

432
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,648
Go on.

433
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:47,757
Can l call you by
your first name?

434
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:55,933
Come, my dear. Everybody is waiting.
You too Viren.

435
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:45,120
''These moments, these memories,
l shall cherish for years to come''

436
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:56,394
''Should the seasons change,
l will beg for them''

437
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:08,143
''These moments, these memories,
l shall cherish for years to come''

438
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:19,646
''Should the seasons change,
l will appeal for them''

439
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:26,424
''l will cherish for years...''

440
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,543
May you live long.

441
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:59,894
Whenever you come, stay here a while.
Nobody should say the house is empty.

442
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,332
No, don't worry about that.

443
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,328
We'll look after the house
for you now.

444
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,737
What are these people doing here?

445
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:16,141
Tell her, Sir. She's asking
what are we doing here?

446
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:22,947
This is ours now. We were quiet,
because of Viren

447
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:26,150
Else we'd have thrown you out
six days ago.

448
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,582
Can't you people be polite?

449
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,156
Who is this guy? ls he trying
to teach us to be polite?

450
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,755
Don't ever think it's only the Rajputs
who are self-respecting

451
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:39,766
Every decent man can kill
and die for his self-respect

452
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,096
lf you say another word,
there'll be a death here.

453
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,976
Whose death?
- Either yours, or mine.

454
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,372
No. This is not the
time to keep quiet.

455
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:56,374
You people had said,
you'd come tomorrow.

456
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:02,189
You've got it wrong. We were paid
a million to keep away till today.

457
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:08,386
What's all this about?
What time limit? Which million?

458
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:13,732
Throw these people
out of our property.

459
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,066
This house, this land,
is all ours now.

460
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,738
Your father had lost the case...

461
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,843
Yes, Viren wanted you to leave happily
before they claimed it all.

462
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:34,081
That's why he had to buy
some time from them.

463
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:43,160
Papa died, the mansion is not mine.
l've become all alone now.

464
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:49,861
God forbid! Why should you feel alone?
You have your husband with you.

465
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:02,878
l cried so much against these walls.
Such insult to those tears.

466
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,255
l'll never forgive Viren for this.

467
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,950
That's your personal opinion,
but he did his duty.

468
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:17,462
We both are indebted to him.
And it's a debt we can never repay.

469
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,471
Just take me away from here.

470
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:30,476
Bless you, dear.
But don't misunderstand Viren.

471
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:37,145
There's no question about that.
Now l know why he didn't wait for you.

472
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:45,083
He didn't want to face this moment.
ln his place, l'd have done the same.

473
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:50,295
No work is done without contacts
these days, especially plane-bookings.

474
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,097
Your seats are confirmed.

475
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,096
Who are those other tickets for?
- For you.

476
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,507
And the former one?
- For me.

477
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:04,178
l know you much better than you think.
You can't cry alone.

478
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:10,014
When your dad died, l was present.
You used a shoulder to cry on.

479
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,682
What will l cry for this time?
- For your love.

480
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:18,516
Till you forget Pallavi,
l'm not leaving your side.

481
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,161
l don't think l'll ever forget her.

482
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,308
''These birds and the clouds
are crazy about lovers...''

483
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,073
''Who are we, O companion?''

484
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,553
''l can't remember,
l've forgotten''

485
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,558
''l can't remember,
l've forgotten''

486
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,558
''These birds and the clouds
are crazy about lovers''

487
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,559
''Who are we?''

488
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,971
''l can't remember...
l have forgotten''

489
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,567
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

490
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:34,058
''We need nothing''

491
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:42,202
''Nothing is more
beautiful than love''

492
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:51,010
''Where will these
waves take us?''

493
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:59,453
''l have no regret,
you are my shore''

494
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:07,330
''Life is but flowing water...
it can't be trusted''

495
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,463
''The birds and the clouds...
they're crazy about lovers''

496
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,636
''Who are we?''

497
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,081
''l can't remember,
l've forgotten''

498
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,085
''l can't remember...
l have forgotten''

499
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,672
''Lost, we are''

500
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,482
''Asleep, we remain''

501
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:06,685
''The world looks for us...
and we are lost''

502
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:15,694
''Asleep in a bed of desire''

503
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:23,110
''Come, let's get closer''

504
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:32,247
''Let's lose each other
in an embrace''

505
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:40,719
''We share dreams together...
there's nobody else''

506
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,732
''These clouds and the birds
are crazy about lovers''

507
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,400
''Who are we?''

508
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,304
''l can't say...
l have forgotten''

509
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:56,078
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

510
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:02,416
''Birds and the clouds
are crazy about lovers''

511
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:05,083
''Who are we?''

512
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,757
''l can't remember.
l have forgotten''

513
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,760
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

514
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:17,099
''l can't remember,
l have forgotten''

515
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,455
How lengthy a letter will you write?
Do you aim to tire him?

516
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,360
l've almost finished.

517
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:57,803
May l ask you something? How long
will you go on writing to him?

518
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,468
Why? Don't you like it?

519
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,976
But he hasn't replied you at all.

520
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:12,984
What difference does that make?
But he must know, he's very special.

521
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,531
Come here... closer.

522
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,238
May l say something?

523
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:35,239
Has Viren ever told how
much he loves you?

524
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,642
What! Did you say he...

525
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,185
l thought as much that you
would have no inkling.

526
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,121
What nonsense you talk.
You're mad..

527
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:58,858
l realized it the day
when you ran to me.

528
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:04,868
But he thought you sought his arms.

529
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,377
But when you fell in my arms,...

530
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:13,882
he realized he had
no place in your heart.

531
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,877
But why didn't l realize it all?

532
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,158
Because you had
your eyes on me then.

533
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,894
Then why didn't you tell me?

534
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:31,895
l don't have a copyright on love.
Any man would fall in love with you.

535
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:36,466
l won't write to him!
- Why not?

536
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:43,309
Give him some time to forget you.
lt's not easy to forget a first love.

537
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,379
Are you my husband
or Viren's lawyer?

538
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:54,389
No advocating, l'm only speaking the
truth. Promise me you'll write to him.

539
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:05,491
l'll pen you so many letters that
you'll get fed up and reply me.

540
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:11,940
l'll never forgive you for going
away without meeting me.

541
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:20,147
Listen, l didn't know that
motherhood meant so much to me.

542
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,110
Haven't you caught on?
l'm pregnant.

543
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,961
Speak loudly please.

544
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:44,499
Very bad news, son.
- You're well, aren't you?

545
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:50,377
Yes, but Siddharth was killed
in a car accident.

546
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,316
She wasn't with him, was she?
- Yes, she was.

547
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,317
Then nothing to fret about,
is there?

548
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,989
Yes there is, you better rush over.

549
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:24,341
l understand, but we'll have to operate.
She has lost a lot of blood.

550
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:29,677
And between the mother and child,
l can save only one.

551
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,747
Then save the mother.

552
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:42,296
Please do me a favour.
Save my baby.

553
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,200
Don't talk so much.

554
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:50,428
l beg you...

555
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:03,708
Trust in God.
lf He wills, both will be safe.

556
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,057
l could save the baby,
but she's very serious.

557
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,558
There's no time.
She wants to see you.

558
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:45,822
Viren was also a baby when you
took over him, isn't it?

559
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,323
Yes.

560
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,103
Viren is here too.

561
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,788
You better go and meet her.

562
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:24,792
Please don't say anything.

563
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:35,667
You had asked me not to
hesitate if l wanted something.

564
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:41,473
Well, l want you to live
and be happy.

565
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,553
l want you...

566
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:26,528
''These moments, these memories,
l will cherish for years to come''

567
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:38,401
''Should the seasons change,
l will beg they be returned''

568
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:43,200
''l will cherish for years''

569
01:09:51,253 --> 01:10:03,927
''When the pea-hen
calls out in the night''

570
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:22,312
''The bangles tinkle in my hands.
See this, O Sir''

571
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:32,091
''The bangles tinkle in my hands''

572
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:44,464
''When the pea-hen
calls out in the nights''

573
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:19,307
Where did you find this beauty?

574
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:23,809
Beauty is found everywhere.
Beauty is beauty after all.

575
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,549
Then is it...
- Yes, Pallavi's daughter.

576
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,550
What's her name?

577
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,321
She has to be brought up
with reverence.

578
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:36,255
So l've named her
''Puja'' (Puja=prayer).

579
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:06,148
Leaving today only, son?
- Yes.

580
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,357
Just one more day...

581
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,091
When l wanted to stay,
you insisted l go.

582
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,529
And now that l wish to go,
you stop me.

583
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:24,361
See Puja, just once at least.
She's one year old today.

584
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,968
l can never forget her birthday.

585
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:34,374
Can you blame her for that?
- No. But l wish her birthday,...

586
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,787
and Pallavi's death anniversary
didn't clash.

587
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,390
When will you come again?

588
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,392
Next year, on the
death anniversary.

589
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:50,390
You've grown up now.
Adults must learn to forget the past.

590
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,567
That's just it.
l just can't forget.

591
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,407
l'll go now.
- Bless you.

592
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:11,147
''My little doll;
My little child...''

593
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,423
''From fairyland one day...''

594
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:25,423
''a prince will come to take
you away to the castles''

595
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:45,442
''My little doll...''

596
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:51,258
''you will one day
cast a magic spell''

597
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:02,461
''You will grow up...''

598
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:07,808
''and l'll be an old woman''

599
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:13,474
''Don't you forget these ties
we share''

600
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:19,285
''My little doll;
my little child...''

601
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:23,883
''From fairyland one day...''

602
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:36,597
''a prince will arrive to take you
away into the castles''

603
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:42,066
''My little child;
my little doll...''

604
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:46,913
''From fairyland one day...''

605
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:58,419
''a prince will arrive to take
you away to the castles''

606
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,767
ls he here?
- Yes.

607
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,314
Don't shout.

608
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:25,676
ls he upstairs? ln that case, l won't
let him go without seeing me this time.

609
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:29,484
He's tired, so let him sleep now.

610
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,894
Can l just peep?
- No! How many times must l tell you?

611
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:36,889
You never let me meet him.
Go! l won't talk to you!

612
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,573
What are you doing here?

613
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,569
Keeping a watch,
so he doesn't slip out.

614
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:54,181
Mad! He's going tomorrow.
- Then l'll sit here, till tomorrow!

615
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,584
Okay. When you feel sleepy,
come upstairs to me.

616
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,902
Enough now!
Don't be silly.

617
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,039
l ran behind the car
but he didn't even look back.

618
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,646
You were behind the car,
so how could he see you?

619
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,241
l even called out to him.

620
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:05,813
There must've been heavy breeze,
he must not have heard.

621
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,985
Meet him next year.

622
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,159
Just let me grow up!
- And what will you do?

623
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:13,394
You won't tell him, will you?

624
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:17,063
l'll just marry him.
Then where will he go?

625
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,065
Every time he comes, he has
just given me a gift.

626
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,829
Where's my gift, by the way?

627
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,265
Here it is.

628
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:19,726
Prem, l found those people
a bit too smart.

629
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:23,724
Not smart, but like
their name, ''crooks''

630
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,726
Shows off his helicopter
to us, my foot.

631
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,897
We know our importance too.

632
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,733
So the deal will be as per our terms.
One thing, don't compromise.

633
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,537
There was a call for you from Anita.

634
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,480
Who can forget that girl?

635
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:54,194
Hadn't l called you actually?
- How could l leave him behind?

636
01:18:56,798 --> 01:19:03,431
Actually we are tolerating each other.
ln fact, all are enduring each other.

637
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:09,770
God shouldn't bless anyone with beauty.

638
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,946
See, she's calling out to me.

639
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,794
Keep laughing like this forever.

640
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,460
You've a special place
in my life.

641
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,802
You have held me together,
else l'd have just died.

642
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,239
Why don't you come out
of those shadows?

643
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:46,542
l know. And whenever l shut my eyes,
she stands before me, alive.

644
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:54,618
Memories aren't something
man can simply expend with.

645
01:19:55,390 --> 01:20:01,625
l must have failed somewhere along,
for you to not forget her as yet.

646
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:06,323
lt's my fault.
Maybe l'm not trying hard enough.

647
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,838
l'm speaking from here only.
Our flight is due soon.

648
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,864
l'm thinking of getting married.
What do you think?

649
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:40,868
Don't talk to me like that.
l'm not one of those.

650
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,627
Please be serious.

651
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,668
Of course. Do you think
it'll be proper?

652
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:14,691
How long can a man chase shadows?
What do you think of Anita?

653
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,307
Do you love her?

654
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:24,471
l have already loved once.
Now l want to marry.

655
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:28,515
l will marry Anita,
after l come back.

656
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:34,684
l'll call Daija too.
And that's that.

657
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,610
Well?

658
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:08,113
We spoke a lot of nonsense.
About importing lndia's seasons.

659
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,754
The lndian government
wouldn't allow it, l said.

660
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:13,961
Tell me about what you couldn't
tell me over the phone.

661
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:17,497
The phone? What an unromantic thing.

662
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:23,371
lmagine a romantic scene between Dilip
Kumar and Madhubala over the phone.

663
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,365
Louder, says Dilip Kumar.
l can't hear a thing!

664
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:34,380
So how will you know about something
that's going to thrill you?

665
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:37,376
Have you decided to
commit suicide? Thank God!

666
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,581
Actually, it's Viren's idea
to commit suicide.

667
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,786
l tried to talk him out of it...
- So?

668
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:49,986
Now when he marries you, he'll have
to commit suicide, sooner or later!

669
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,997
Marry me?

670
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,729
Come to your senses...
this is Prem!

671
01:23:53,762 --> 01:24:00,065
Now why have you gone dumb?
You chewed my brains about meeting him.

672
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:03,761
Now why so quiet as a mouse?
Go ahead with your complaints to him.

673
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:12,069
She had made my life miserable.
He doesn't meet me, or talk to me.

674
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,484
Go on, get up and meet him.

675
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:37,901
You're leaving? l thought you were
to stay for a couple of days more.

676
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,509
Please stay for
just one more day.

677
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:49,514
lf l had no important work on hand,
l'd have stayed back.

678
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:52,616
l'm requesting for just one day.

679
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:59,718
A day's so small. Can't you
honour my small request?

680
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,726
And you hardly stayed.

681
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,300
Don't stop him.

682
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:17,133
He doesn't have time even
for himself, let alone us.

683
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:22,479
He's very busy. Why should he
bother with our feelings, dear?

684
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:24,811
You go, Viren.

685
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:29,018
Nowadays you're very rude.

686
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:33,961
You don't please anybody.
You behave as you wish.

687
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:40,163
Here are the tickets. And when we both
come to London, where will you go?

688
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,188
Let him go.

689
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,708
Turn back.

690
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:31,211
You Sir? They have gone.

691
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,811
This is not a castle, but
a memorial to love...

692
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,024
which is found in every Love Story.

693
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,220
lt was the same in
the love story...

694
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,362
of Rana Puri Narayan Singh
and his beloved.

695
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:44,223
There was a long time feud
between their two families.

696
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:50,760
Durgavati wrote a love letter to him,
and awaited his arrival.

697
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,503
There's an inexpressible joy
in awaiting one's beloved.

698
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:03,248
At times she asked her bangles, or,
even to her reflection in the mirror.

699
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:18,824
Did he get my letter or not?
l don't know his feelings.

700
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:25,833
Please tell me, dear wind,
what does he say?

701
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:29,605
My heart is always open to him.

702
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,279
And l await him.

703
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,775
You're just eating away.
Tell me how did you like my show?

704
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:46,792
l don't know about others, but
it took me into my past.

705
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,530
l'm very happy to know this.

706
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,927
Let's celebrate it...

707
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:56,299
She has herself specially
made it for you.

708
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:05,305
How's your horse Windy?
- How do you know Windy?

709
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:10,108
Look at that!
He's asking how do l know Windy?

710
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:14,644
Had you known by full name,
you'd have never asked me this.

711
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:26,993
Can't believe it, eh?
Get up then, and come on.

712
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:31,327
Better go, else you'll remain here,
and your arms will go with her!

713
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:40,336
Why did you beat your head over me?
Why have you collected all this?

714
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:42,747
To each his own.

715
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:47,918
You never met me, so l joined
all your pieces, and did this.

716
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,358
Try and run now.

717
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:56,363
What's this?
- That's my autobiography.

718
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:02,364
Whatever you sent, your photos,
and even cake-candles.

719
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:08,842
l had also vowed not to accept your
gifts, till you gave them personally.

720
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:11,640
They are all still lying unopened.

721
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:18,545
Then? lt was my birthday and you
used to hand it to Daija!

722
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:24,792
lf you want to give them to me,
then do it properly. Come on.

723
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,523
Not from the top.
From here.

724
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:32,959
Why so?

725
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:36,795
Because l'm 3 years old there.

726
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:48,138
Now what's the matter?

727
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:50,679
Haven't you ever been
to a birthday party?

728
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:54,755
Because a birthday gift is given
by wishing Happy Birthday.

729
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:08,034
Daija says l laugh
just like my mother.

730
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:12,164
You must have heard it.
ls it true?

731
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:17,845
Go to sleep. lt's very late.

732
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:35,455
''My little doll;
My little child...''

733
01:30:36,064 --> 01:30:40,728
''From fairyland one day...''

734
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:51,601
''a prince will come to take
you away to the castles''

735
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:13,828
He's gone, my dear.
- He went without meeting me again?

736
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:22,065
Don't feel so bad. See this.
We too shall be flying to London soon.

737
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:46,032
Where were you?
You've come back, a long time now.

738
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:50,435
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

739
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:53,634
What can happen? l went
as usual and returned.

740
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,442
l was thinking about the deal.

741
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:02,606
Lying is not everybody's forte.
And you don't have it!

742
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:05,080
So why try?

743
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,414
l'm in no hurry...

744
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:08,751
Please come.

745
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:14,061
You really take your time however.

746
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:17,061
We spent 100 Pounds each
on those tickets.

747
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,462
There were some girls
whom l was eying...

748
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:23,397
but you being a wet blanket,
you spoilt it.

749
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:27,140
Now you'll see a movie on video
and l'll...

750
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,339
read books.
- Yes.

751
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:33,009
God didn't create night
to spend it all alone at home.

752
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:37,081
Had you helped me a bit, l too would
have had someone awaiting me...

753
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:41,347
Someone to question,
''why are you late?''

754
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:45,357
But here we're stuck with
bare walls, and windows...

755
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:53,431
l'm elder to you by a month, a day and
a few hours. So, it's my turn first.

756
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:59,498
May you live long.
- lf you say so.

757
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,307
But it is a pain in the neck
to live with this dry-bone.

758
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,545
Neither he marries, nor does he
let me marry.

759
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,611
Greetings...

760
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,235
This is Puja.

761
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:33,231
And you can't be anybody else.
But his best friend Prem.

762
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,643
She has told me so much about you,
that l know everything by heart.

763
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,975
Shall l tell you?

764
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:46,053
You're fond of food so am l.
You like to go out, so do l.

765
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,684
You like to chat,
so do l.

766
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:53,655
The best is,
we both like to laugh!

767
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:58,256
Enough now. Once she starts off,
there's no stopping her.

768
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,282
l just can't believe she
resembles her mother so much!

769
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:18,878
Does she know you loved...

770
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:25,283
And don't tell her either.

771
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:32,088
But how can you? You didn't even
tell Pallavi herself, that you...

772
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:40,630
Why does all this happen to you only?
God's losing his sense of humour too.

773
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,105
He thinks He's played
a practical joke on you.

774
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:47,714
l'd have also kept quiet,
had l been in your shoes.

775
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:55,721
One thing is sure.
As long as she's here....

776
01:34:56,357 --> 01:35:01,795
you won't forget Pallavi,
and Puja is here.

777
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,150
That song you were just singing,
when did you learn it?

778
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,023
l wasn't singing, but humming.

779
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:39,689
Okay, the song you were humming...
From whom did you...

780
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,369
lt's neither taught,
nor learnt.

781
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:45,228
lt just grows into the
hearts of local girls...

782
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:46,735
What!

783
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,378
l said it just grows...
- After that...?

784
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,381
ln the hearts of local girls...
- You dare call me Uncle again!

785
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,379
Don't shout Premji...
- Not Premji either...

786
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:59,382
You don't have to add that ''Ji''
like you call him.

787
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,755
Then Mr. Prem?

788
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,720
Then Prem, Sir?

789
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,052
Then what shall l say?

790
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:13,560
Prem, or if you want to call me
more intimately then, Prem darling...

791
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:22,437
Where are you off to?

792
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:26,008
l overslept a bit...
l should have been in office by now.

793
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:29,349
Whose office?
- Mine, of course.

794
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:32,875
Maybe you don't know it,
it's a Sunday today.

795
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:36,088
And on Sundays, just ours, all
the offices in London are closed.

796
01:36:36,424 --> 01:36:40,360
But one office is open. The Telegraph
Office. You can send us a wire.

797
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:45,024
l just forgot about it.
- So what will you do?

798
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:49,701
You can take her around London.

799
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:52,372
You also come with us.

800
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:56,968
l've to speak to Daija
about something important..

801
01:36:57,211 --> 01:37:02,114
Then you'll have to yell it out
because she's coming with us.

802
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:05,972
What is he up to?

803
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:08,272
Uncle, buy me a lovely dog.

804
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:14,308
Buy it! lt's such a nice dog.
- l want that dog, uncle!

805
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:18,642
Lovely dog!

806
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:23,987
That's enough, Prem!

807
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:35,734
Papa isn't buying me the dog!
- People are watching, Prem!

808
01:39:56,557 --> 01:39:59,117
l'm not going out with them again.

809
01:39:59,894 --> 01:40:02,124
And you were like them, too.

810
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:05,791
l can't face anyone
in London anymore.

811
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,133
Everybody was watching!

812
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:24,810
He was okay. So what went wrong?

813
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:27,881
That's how he is. Don't worry.
Did you enjoy yourself?

814
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:34,149
l thought he was enjoying it too.
- Which is why he was angry.

815
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,929
What are you talking...
- He felt guilty that he was happy.

816
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:41,559
They're guys who'd pass
happiness on to the next guy.

817
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:44,170
ln that case, we'll have to
teach him to be happy.

818
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:45,965
l'm not taking the risk.

819
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:49,573
lf happiness gets to know l'm his
friend, l won't be happy again.

820
01:40:57,217 --> 01:41:00,846
What does he like?
He must be fond of something.

821
01:41:01,288 --> 01:41:03,779
Not many things he's fond of.

822
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:09,585
But he's indeed fond of watching
old Hindi film songs.

823
01:41:11,865 --> 01:41:13,059
Old...?

824
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:48,696
''We have fallen in love...''

825
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:52,833
''and yet, why do we fear
falling in love?''

826
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:04,451
''The path is strewn with pitfalls''

827
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:08,777
''We know not where our goal is''

828
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:13,021
''We have fallen in love''

829
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,921
''And yet, why do we
fear love''

830
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:25,064
''Use your deeds to
make your destiny''

831
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:28,141
''Make your destiny''

832
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:32,809
''Should you trust yourself,
play the game''

833
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,473
''Play the game''

834
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:41,020
''Use your deeds
to make your destiny''

835
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:48,894
''Should you trust yourself,
play the game''

836
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:04,307
''Praise Lord Shiva!''

837
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:08,242
''l drink the opiate in Your name''

838
01:43:08,816 --> 01:43:12,115
''l will fall,
l will die...''

839
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:15,181
''if you don't steady me''

840
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,524
''l swear''

841
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:22,123
''Praise Lord Shiva''

842
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:25,930
''l drink in Your name''

843
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:30,128
''l will fall, l will die...''

844
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:33,131
''if you do not steady me''

845
01:43:33,574 --> 01:43:35,872
''l swear in the name of God''

846
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:39,208
''Should you and l...''

847
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:45,552
''be locked in a room...''

848
01:43:48,589 --> 01:43:51,057
''and the keys were
to be lost''

849
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:57,561
''Should you and l be
locked in a room...''

850
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:01,363
''and the keys were
to be lost''

851
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:08,570
''l'd lose myself in
your eyes, my love''

852
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:15,573
''Should you and l be
locked in a room...''

853
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:19,319
''and the keys
were to be lost''

854
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:26,252
''How are you to be treated?''

855
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:31,587
''Must you be killed?
Or must you be spared?''

856
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:36,594
''Tell us, how do you
want us to treat you?''

857
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:42,302
''Must you be killed?
Or must you be spared?''

858
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:47,076
''Tell us, how do you
want us to treat you?''

859
01:44:48,048 --> 01:44:52,610
''How do you want
us to treat you?''

860
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:57,952
''Must you be offered liquor...?
Or should you be poisoned?''

861
01:44:58,659 --> 01:45:02,857
''Tell us, how do you
want us to treat you?''

862
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:18,233
''Watch your step, mister.
Be cautious in love''

863
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:25,647
''There are deceptions
in this path''

864
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:32,384
''Watch your step, mister.
Be cautious in love''

865
01:45:35,095 --> 01:45:40,055
''There is a lot of deception
in this path''

866
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:42,999
''Watch your step, mister''

867
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:51,370
''O Boatman...''

868
01:45:55,983 --> 01:46:03,389
''My beloved is yonder;
and here l am, crestfallen''

869
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:08,126
''Take me across the river''

870
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:11,727
''My beloved is yonder''

871
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:25,272
''The dot on my forehead shines;
my bangles tinkle''

872
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:30,081
''The dot on my forehead shines;
my bangles tinkle''

873
01:46:31,285 --> 01:46:35,745
''So what if it
drives your sleep away''

874
01:46:36,256 --> 01:46:40,488
''The flowers, l swear,
exude a fragrance...''

875
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:51,034
''So what if you're
going to drive away''

876
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:55,774
''The dot on my forehead shines;
my bangles tinkle''

877
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:08,185
''Let them call me a junglee!''

878
01:47:08,889 --> 01:47:11,357
''lf they must call me that,
so be it''

879
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:17,788
''l'm trapped in a storm of love...
what am l to do?''

880
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:20,792
''Let them call me a junglee''

881
01:47:21,335 --> 01:47:23,803
''So be it''

882
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:30,208
''Caught in love l am...
what am l to do?''

883
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,412
''Let them call me a junglee''

884
01:47:42,589 --> 01:47:48,550
''Even if they call me a junglee...''

885
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,169
''let them do it''

886
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:35,864
''You are the one
l have loved''

887
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:45,445
''You are the one
my eyes have awaited''

888
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:55,388
''You are the love
of my childhood''

889
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:59,888
''My stranger has come home to me''

890
01:49:10,811 --> 01:49:14,440
''A massage...
An oil massage!''

891
01:49:15,615 --> 01:49:17,583
''Should you feel giddy...''

892
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:19,910
''or your heart
begins to sink...''

893
01:49:20,287 --> 01:49:26,715
''Come to me, mister.
Why worry?''

894
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:31,591
''Should you feel giddy or your
heart begins to sink''

895
01:49:32,098 --> 01:49:36,933
''Come to me, mister...
there's no need to worry''

896
01:49:49,883 --> 01:50:00,054
''Lucky were those whose
love was reciprocated''

897
01:50:01,094 --> 01:50:06,259
''All l sought was flowers...''

898
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:11,000
''and l got thorns''

899
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:17,538
''l have freed my sari
from the thorns...''

900
01:50:18,044 --> 01:50:21,013
''l have broken every shackle
to wear these dancing-bells''

901
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:27,446
''Stop not this flight now...''

902
01:50:28,054 --> 01:50:31,023
''there goes my heart''

903
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:36,419
''l feel like living again''

904
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:41,431
''l want to die again''

905
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:46,368
''l feel like living again''

906
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:50,037
''l want to die again''

907
01:50:56,082 --> 01:51:00,041
''Come here, Ramaiyya...''

908
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:08,788
''lt's you l have
given my heart to''

909
01:51:09,596 --> 01:51:13,396
''Come here, Ramaiyya''

910
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:22,335
''lt's you l have
given my heart to''

911
01:51:23,009 --> 01:51:26,069
''Come here, Ramaiyya''

912
01:51:27,113 --> 01:51:30,480
''lt's you l have
given my heart to''

913
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:34,813
''Come here, Ramaiyya''

914
01:51:35,221 --> 01:51:38,418
''lt's you l have
given my heart to''

915
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,094
Sunk! We're sunk!

916
01:51:52,572 --> 01:51:57,202
''Days of joys are gone...
gloom is here now''

917
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:06,742
Daija, she's Anita.
This is my Daija, more than a mother.

918
01:52:08,254 --> 01:52:10,222
Bless you, my dear..

919
01:52:10,857 --> 01:52:12,620
And this is Puja...

920
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:15,784
So you're Puja, are you?

921
01:52:15,962 --> 01:52:18,988
Till now l am. lf you have
any objection, l'll change it.

922
01:52:19,366 --> 01:52:21,334
Not at all. lt's a nice name.

923
01:52:24,938 --> 01:52:26,030
Shall we go?

924
01:52:30,644 --> 01:52:32,669
Naughty!

925
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:39,347
What's the matter?
Why are you so quiet?

926
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:44,581
l was just thinking that you need not
close your eyes to forget Pallavi.

927
01:52:46,292 --> 01:52:48,260
Puja is not Pallavi.

928
01:52:48,461 --> 01:52:53,592
l know that. l know you are you.
And l am Anita.

929
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:59,595
But she's a spitting image of Pallavi.
And she won't let you forget that.

930
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:03,601
After our marriage, it'll be like
sharing you with Pallavi...

931
01:53:04,377 --> 01:53:10,338
You're not sharing me with anybody.
l give you my heart empty of memories.

932
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:24,429
Okay Daija, l'm going.

933
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:26,966
He doesn't bother
to see the time!

934
01:53:27,333 --> 01:53:29,301
The moment he opens
his eyes, he's off.

935
01:53:39,312 --> 01:53:40,438
Are you alright?

936
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:48,921
l wanted to say something
important to you.

937
01:53:49,456 --> 01:53:51,219
And what is so important?

938
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:56,290
lt's just that l'm...
l'm inviting you for dinner tonight.

939
01:53:59,699 --> 01:54:01,428
You'll come, won't you?

940
01:54:38,671 --> 01:54:41,606
A long life to you, my dear,
And a Happy Birthday too.

941
01:54:42,008 --> 01:54:46,206
Birthday? All my best wishes are
with you anyway. So why a birthday?

942
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:51,412
Now l'll have to give a gift
and blessings too.

943
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:57,623
Shall l take a day off?
- No.

944
01:54:57,991 --> 01:54:59,959
That means l attend the office.

945
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,539
Scared you, didn't l?

946
01:55:12,539 --> 01:55:14,507
You'd scare anyone
with a face like that.

947
01:55:14,808 --> 01:55:18,767
What have you applied on your face?
- The secret of my beauty...

948
01:55:19,145 --> 01:55:22,706
''To ruin your good looks,
use this''

949
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,913
Go and wash your face.

950
01:55:26,286 --> 01:55:29,119
You also use it...
- No pooja.

951
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:44,865
When will l have gray hair?
- You'll have to wait years for that.

952
01:55:47,173 --> 01:55:50,700
l'll look good with
gray hair, won't l?

953
01:55:51,578 --> 01:55:53,546
Just like Kunwarji?

954
01:56:01,888 --> 01:56:04,152
What's the matter?
Why the long face?

955
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:10,162
Today l forgot Pallavi's
Death Anniversary.

956
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:15,832
That's great. lt means Puja's birthday
is free from Pallavi's death.

957
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:28,845
Give this to Puja and make
some excuse for my absence.

958
01:56:31,384 --> 01:56:33,352
Then why did you promise her?

959
01:56:33,887 --> 01:56:37,846
She hadn't told me then,
that it was her birthday.

960
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:43,559
And shouldn't l have remembered that
it was Pallavi's death anniversary?

961
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:45,965
Okay, go on living with the dead.

962
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:49,700
Keep the dead happy and break hearts
of those who are alive.

963
01:56:53,239 --> 01:56:58,541
How do l look?
- You always look one in a million.

964
01:56:58,945 --> 01:57:01,209
That's all?
Just one in a million?

965
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:04,206
All right, if not in a million,
then let's say a billion.

966
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:07,653
Enough.
l can't count beyond billions now.

967
01:57:12,258 --> 01:57:14,226
l think he's here.

968
01:57:21,935 --> 01:57:23,903
He's in my pocket.

969
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:31,240
This is from him,
and this is from me.

970
01:57:33,613 --> 01:57:35,581
And where is he now?

971
01:57:38,284 --> 01:57:40,582
ls he with Anita?

972
01:57:41,287 --> 01:57:43,778
No, he's not with her.
- Then where is he?

973
02:00:02,829 --> 02:00:08,199
''My dream has come true''.

974
02:00:15,775 --> 02:00:23,546
''Sometimes l'll say it...
At times, you say it''

975
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:29,583
''That l've given my heart to you''

976
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:36,925
''Sometimes you hear it...
at times, l'll hear it''

977
02:00:39,298 --> 02:00:44,600
''That l've given my heart to you''

978
02:01:40,092 --> 02:01:46,053
''Let's sit together, side by side
like this...''

979
02:01:48,434 --> 02:01:54,669
''And say this to each other...''

980
02:02:12,959 --> 02:02:19,023
''Sometimes l'll say it.
At times you say it''

981
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:26,360
''That l've given my heart to you''

982
02:02:27,873 --> 02:02:34,039
''Sometimes l'll hear it.
At times you'll hear it''

983
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:42,049
''That l've given my heart to you''

984
02:02:43,956 --> 02:02:46,447
''Let's keep walking...''

985
02:02:50,696 --> 02:02:53,062
''Let's keep flying''

986
02:02:56,435 --> 02:02:59,063
''And flowing like this''

987
02:03:12,118 --> 02:03:18,079
''And keep saying this
to each other...''

988
02:03:19,258 --> 02:03:26,164
''Sometimes l'll say...
At times you say''

989
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:32,160
''That l've given my heart to you''

990
02:03:34,206 --> 02:03:40,577
''Sometimes l'll hear it.
At times you'll hear it''

991
02:03:42,548 --> 02:03:47,508
''That l've given my heart to you''

992
02:04:23,589 --> 02:04:29,357
''An ache in the heart,
we silently suffered''

993
02:04:31,831 --> 02:04:37,531
''This is just what we told each other''

994
02:04:40,339 --> 02:04:46,107
''An ache in the heart
we silently suffered''

995
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:54,142
''This is just what we told each other''

996
02:04:55,755 --> 02:05:02,991
''Sometimes l'll say it...
at times, you say it''

997
02:05:04,463 --> 02:05:10,493
''That l've given my heart to you''

998
02:05:10,803 --> 02:05:16,571
''Sometimes, l'll hear it.
At times you listen''

999
02:05:19,211 --> 02:05:24,581
''That l've given my heart to you''

1000
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:37,596
''That l've given my heart to you''

1001
02:05:38,564 --> 02:05:42,591
''That l've given my heart to you''

1002
02:06:28,714 --> 02:06:31,979
''l was in love with you
a hundred years ago...''

1003
02:06:33,018 --> 02:06:38,217
''l still am and shall
forever be''

1004
02:06:40,893 --> 02:06:42,918
No no...

1005
02:06:47,032 --> 02:06:50,661
He's in fact sucking blood
for his breakfast.

1006
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:54,339
l know you feel a bit shy
to talk to me directly.

1007
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:58,007
Anita wishes to speak to you
something about me.

1008
02:07:06,051 --> 02:07:08,019
You can't take him seriously.

1009
02:07:10,122 --> 02:07:17,426
Let's meet for lunch at 1 .30 p.m.
Yes, l'll reserve the table.

1010
02:07:21,534 --> 02:07:24,367
Before fixing that, you should have
asked the weather first.

1011
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:25,595
What to ask?

1012
02:07:25,804 --> 02:07:29,433
Such a sunny day and Anita?
lt's a wrong combination.

1013
02:07:29,842 --> 02:07:31,366
Just look at the weather.

1014
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:34,638
lt's as though the lndian summer
has come here on a holiday.

1015
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:40,484
We hardly see such weather here.
- Let's go out somewhere.

1016
02:07:40,753 --> 02:07:42,721
lf l hadn't any work,
l'd have come.

1017
02:07:43,088 --> 02:07:45,556
Okay. Give me back
the blood you sucked.

1018
02:07:46,325 --> 02:07:49,055
That's called Tit for Tat!
Go on, return it to her.

1019
02:07:49,461 --> 02:07:52,055
You're going to get it from me
one day. l'll see you, Daija.

1020
02:07:53,098 --> 02:07:55,794
What the hell!
He has completely spoilt it.

1021
02:08:21,126 --> 02:08:24,095
Okay, let's have a picnic today.

1022
02:10:39,465 --> 02:10:43,424
l thought you'd be asleep.
What's the matter? You seem worried.

1023
02:10:45,871 --> 02:10:49,432
Maybe you're also seeing
what l'm seeing.

1024
02:10:54,546 --> 02:10:57,845
l don't want to see
either of them unhappy.

1025
02:11:01,019 --> 02:11:08,448
How can l relax? Puja knows
nothing of Viren's feelings.

1026
02:11:09,495 --> 02:11:11,793
Everything will be fine.

1027
02:11:27,513 --> 02:11:29,481
l just slept off.

1028
02:11:29,681 --> 02:11:32,479
lf you feel sleepy,
you should go to your room.

1029
02:11:55,107 --> 02:11:58,304
Where do l sit? The seat next
to you seems to be occupied!

1030
02:11:58,744 --> 02:12:00,268
How can you talk like that?

1031
02:12:00,412 --> 02:12:05,042
What else? l'm not one of them
who throw themselves at others.

1032
02:12:10,556 --> 02:12:14,993
You invited me for lunch, and
you forgot? l'm not blind...

1033
02:12:15,561 --> 02:12:17,529
And this hair is
not mine either.

1034
02:12:19,298 --> 02:12:23,257
l did not wait 5 years
for you, to see this.

1035
02:12:27,573 --> 02:12:30,542
But you are jumping
to the wrong conclusions.

1036
02:12:30,976 --> 02:12:33,342
l'm not jumping to
any conclusions.

1037
02:12:36,215 --> 02:12:39,548
Start living with your eyes open
and stop this pretense.

1038
02:12:40,085 --> 02:12:44,215
The girl who was leaning on you
was not Pallavi.

1039
02:12:44,590 --> 02:12:48,549
Pallavi is dead, and she has
been so for the past 18 years.

1040
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:57,967
That's exactly what l'm trying
to say. She's Puja, not Pallavi.

1041
02:12:58,604 --> 02:13:05,271
l'm not advising or accusing you.
But think of the girl.

1042
02:13:05,844 --> 02:13:07,436
Can't you see that...

1043
02:13:13,151 --> 02:13:15,915
Once again an old woman
is found dead.

1044
02:13:20,626 --> 02:13:23,186
Hurry up with the breakfast, please.
l've to rush.

1045
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:24,929
l'll just give it to you.

1046
02:13:26,298 --> 02:13:28,266
Tell them, l'll come after lunch.

1047
02:13:43,649 --> 02:13:45,617
Here's the breakfast.

1048
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:49,020
l won't have any breakfast.
l've got to rush.

1049
02:13:52,658 --> 02:13:55,286
Why did he go off like that?

1050
02:13:56,662 --> 02:13:58,630
Must have remembered
something important.

1051
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:02,288
He'll never do what he should!
And always do, what he should not!

1052
02:14:08,707 --> 02:14:11,005
l look just like
Jack Nicholson here.

1053
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:16,204
Had you looked at a girl the
way you're looking at that car,...

1054
02:14:16,415 --> 02:14:18,042
you'd have got married!

1055
02:14:21,186 --> 02:14:23,450
Later on.
- Go ahead. They are very nice.

1056
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,928
She's beautiful - no doubt.

1057
02:14:31,563 --> 02:14:34,054
You fix with her and
l'll fix up with her sister!

1058
02:14:40,706 --> 02:14:44,335
How long will you wait for him?
- Till he comes.

1059
02:14:44,710 --> 02:14:49,340
To each his own. lt's boring to wait.
That too, with an empty plate!

1060
02:14:52,718 --> 02:14:55,687
Shall l serve the dinner?
Puja has been waiting for you.

1061
02:14:56,388 --> 02:15:00,449
Tell her not to wait henceforth.
l've already had my dinner.

1062
02:15:05,797 --> 02:15:09,699
Come dear, you have your food.
He's had his.

1063
02:15:10,736 --> 02:15:12,294
l'm not hungry.

1064
02:15:12,537 --> 02:15:15,028
How can you be? You've stuffed
yourself with all that ''waiting''.

1065
02:15:15,474 --> 02:15:17,704
l didn't expect such
stupidity from you.

1066
02:15:18,110 --> 02:15:21,045
Of course, l also didn't like
they way he said it, but...

1067
02:15:21,446 --> 02:15:23,710
What's the matter with him today?

1068
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:26,709
He's had it now!

1069
02:15:30,022 --> 02:15:32,718
You should have taken
her feelings into consideration.

1070
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:36,053
How many people's feelings
do l take into consideration?

1071
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:40,727
Why are you treating her
as your punching bag?

1072
02:15:41,767 --> 02:15:44,327
He's not angry with me, is he?

1073
02:15:45,103 --> 02:15:47,731
No. lt's not like that.
He's not the kind to get angry.

1074
02:15:51,843 --> 02:15:54,744
Does Anita love him very much?

1075
02:15:56,581 --> 02:15:59,345
Yes.
- And what about him?

1076
02:16:06,792 --> 02:16:08,089
About what?

1077
02:16:09,061 --> 02:16:12,428
That he doesn't love Anita?

1078
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,768
He usually keeps his
feelings to himself.

1079
02:16:17,202 --> 02:16:19,762
Nobody knows better
than he himself.

1080
02:16:20,872 --> 02:16:23,363
Then that's a great loss.

1081
02:16:24,876 --> 02:16:30,371
Love has no business acumen, thus,
it never thinks of gains and losses.

1082
02:16:31,817 --> 02:16:35,981
That's why most love stories
end in tragedy.

1083
02:16:37,155 --> 02:16:40,784
l think your love story
ended in a tragedy too.

1084
02:16:42,494 --> 02:16:45,793
My Love story has been written
by some poet in two lines.

1085
02:16:46,832 --> 02:16:50,393
''Let those who can, enjoy
the joys of love, forget me''

1086
02:16:50,836 --> 02:16:53,396
''l've left it to my destiny''

1087
02:16:56,241 --> 02:17:00,803
Does it take years to express
what's deep in your heart?

1088
02:17:01,913 --> 02:17:03,813
Let me give you a sound advise.

1089
02:17:04,282 --> 02:17:10,812
When one falls in love,
one should express it at once.

1090
02:17:11,923 --> 02:17:18,556
At the most, it will be refuted,
but at least it'll be off your mind.

1091
02:17:20,265 --> 02:17:23,234
One should never suppress
one's feelings when in love.

1092
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:26,637
One should come clean.

1093
02:18:09,714 --> 02:18:11,147
Are you also going?

1094
02:18:11,249 --> 02:18:13,217
lf you don't want me to,
l won't. l'll bunk it.

1095
02:18:16,254 --> 02:18:19,223
Just drop me off somewhere.
l'll do some window-shopping.

1096
02:18:19,991 --> 02:18:22,892
On one condition.
You'll have to shop windows for me.

1097
02:18:23,929 --> 02:18:25,419
l'll just come.

1098
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:29,327
lt's alright for her,
What'll happen to you Kaliya...

1099
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:51,983
Are you buying a sweater?
lt'll go very well on Prem.

1100
02:18:52,691 --> 02:18:54,784
l'm buying it for Viren, actually.

1101
02:18:55,093 --> 02:18:59,427
Really? But he never wears
such bright color.

1102
02:19:00,365 --> 02:19:05,928
But l like them and l want to
buy him something of my choice.

1103
02:19:13,979 --> 02:19:15,606
How about some coffee?

1104
02:19:17,315 --> 02:19:19,283
How's Daija?
- Very fine.

1105
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:23,119
You're very attached
to her aren't you?

1106
02:19:23,989 --> 02:19:26,355
Who else do l have
except her in life?

1107
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:31,561
Why are you so emotional?
- Because l'm lndian.

1108
02:19:31,997 --> 02:19:34,966
Had you been not exposed to
the culture here, you'd be too.

1109
02:19:36,001 --> 02:19:38,561
Why do you always seem so
irritated by me?

1110
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:40,168
Not at all.

1111
02:19:40,372 --> 02:19:44,331
Tell me, how do you look at Viren?

1112
02:19:45,076 --> 02:19:47,135
As l should.

1113
02:19:47,512 --> 02:19:49,980
That means you respect
and adore him.

1114
02:19:51,016 --> 02:19:53,712
He's not a God for me
to worship him.

1115
02:19:54,019 --> 02:19:55,987
He has looked after you...

1116
02:19:56,388 --> 02:20:01,382
On the contrary, Daija has reared me.
Yes, l did stay in his mansion.

1117
02:20:01,826 --> 02:20:04,317
But he didn't rear me.

1118
02:20:04,829 --> 02:20:07,992
There's a lot of difference in
taking care of, and just caring.

1119
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:13,503
Anyway there's a difference between,
how we both feel about him.

1120
02:20:16,041 --> 02:20:22,503
Well, that's very hard to say for we
both don't know our feelings for him.

1121
02:20:23,381 --> 02:20:26,009
l've been in love with him
for the last 5 years.

1122
02:20:28,053 --> 02:20:31,420
But l've been loving him,
since l was 5 years old.

1123
02:20:32,390 --> 02:20:38,022
No. You're a liability and a trouble
to him and that's all you'll remain.

1124
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:43,030
lf you say so, at least l'm something
to him. But what are you to him?

1125
02:20:48,073 --> 02:20:49,233
l'll go now.

1126
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:52,209
Wait for a while.

1127
02:20:52,577 --> 02:20:55,546
No, l've to go.
- What's the hurry?

1128
02:20:56,081 --> 02:20:59,050
l've to make him wear this.

1129
02:20:59,551 --> 02:21:03,043
Just try it, and if he refuses,
you'll come to know yourself.

1130
02:21:04,089 --> 02:21:07,058
And suppose l make him wear it,
will you come to know too?

1131
02:21:09,094 --> 02:21:11,062
He doesn't love you.

1132
02:21:12,097 --> 02:21:14,622
And does he love you?

1133
02:21:26,778 --> 02:21:27,472
Who 's it?

1134
02:21:31,549 --> 02:21:32,914
May l come in?

1135
02:21:39,891 --> 02:21:41,586
What's that you have there?

1136
02:21:42,227 --> 02:21:46,129
You've given me so many gifts.
Thought l'd give you one too.

1137
02:21:47,165 --> 02:21:48,723
Why the formality?

1138
02:21:49,567 --> 02:21:53,128
Does that mean all those gifts
to me were out of formality?

1139
02:21:54,305 --> 02:21:56,466
Okay. Tell me what's in that?

1140
02:21:57,342 --> 02:21:59,833
First take your words back
about the formality.

1141
02:22:00,378 --> 02:22:02,175
Okay, l take it back.

1142
02:22:07,185 --> 02:22:09,153
Here take this.

1143
02:22:10,188 --> 02:22:12,554
But what is it?
- Look yourself.

1144
02:22:17,595 --> 02:22:20,758
l can't wear this.

1145
02:22:23,468 --> 02:22:26,164
Don't worry.
l'll have it changed by Anita.

1146
02:22:26,938 --> 02:22:31,170
Even l can change,
but l don't want to.

1147
02:22:32,877 --> 02:22:37,177
She was saying the same thing.
She said you won't like it.

1148
02:22:37,549 --> 02:22:40,677
She knows my choice.
But where did you meet her?

1149
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:43,187
The same shop where l bought this.

1150
02:22:43,621 --> 02:22:45,851
She stopped you from buying,
yet you went ahead?

1151
02:22:46,224 --> 02:22:49,523
Yes, because why should
l buy her choice for you?

1152
02:22:50,495 --> 02:22:53,191
lf you don't want to wear it,
just chuck it.

1153
02:22:57,235 --> 02:23:00,693
lf l wear this,
will you listen to me?

1154
02:23:01,339 --> 02:23:04,206
That l'll do, even if you
don't wear it.

1155
02:23:06,244 --> 02:23:08,212
Come and sit.

1156
02:23:21,693 --> 02:23:23,888
You look in it a new person.

1157
02:23:26,064 --> 02:23:29,556
How l wish Anita was here!
- Nothing.

1158
02:23:30,435 --> 02:23:33,734
Just see this photograph.

1159
02:23:35,673 --> 02:23:36,970
Why?

1160
02:23:37,275 --> 02:23:39,243
See it
- But why?

1161
02:23:42,347 --> 02:23:46,249
Puja, you're grown up now.

1162
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:50,244
And when a girl grows up...
- Then what?

1163
02:23:53,558 --> 02:24:00,020
Daija wishes to find a suitable boy
and get you married.

1164
02:24:00,832 --> 02:24:03,699
And what do you wish?

1165
02:24:05,737 --> 02:24:09,969
l wish to see you married too.
That's why l was showing you the photo.

1166
02:24:10,808 --> 02:24:12,776
His father is in the shipping.

1167
02:24:13,144 --> 02:24:16,113
They are decent.
You'll be happy there.

1168
02:24:16,814 --> 02:24:19,715
Why are you telling me all this?

1169
02:24:22,086 --> 02:24:24,247
There are only
2 ways to get married.

1170
02:24:24,622 --> 02:24:31,721
Either you accept our choice or you
tell us your choice to do the needful.

1171
02:24:34,432 --> 02:24:36,923
Promise?
- Of course.

1172
02:24:39,437 --> 02:24:41,598
ls he in lndia?

1173
02:24:42,073 --> 02:24:44,405
No, from London.

1174
02:24:46,244 --> 02:24:48,212
Since when do you know him?

1175
02:24:49,781 --> 02:24:52,409
Since my childhood.

1176
02:25:04,562 --> 02:25:06,530
Don't be childish.

1177
02:25:07,131 --> 02:25:11,830
But you just said
that l've grown up.

1178
02:25:13,605 --> 02:25:16,165
You are now going back
on your word.

1179
02:25:17,675 --> 02:25:24,843
l can't stop now. When l was 5,
l had told Daija of my choice.

1180
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:27,011
You are crossing your limits now.

1181
02:25:27,218 --> 02:25:30,654
That's just what l mean.
l'm already way ahead.

1182
02:25:32,090 --> 02:25:35,253
lf you wanted me to be quiet,
why did you ask me my choice?

1183
02:25:36,227 --> 02:25:39,458
But since you've asked me,
you'll have to hear.

1184
02:25:39,931 --> 02:25:41,262
Stop right there.

1185
02:25:41,499 --> 02:25:47,199
Don't interrupt me. l'll tell you
the name of the man l love.

1186
02:25:48,172 --> 02:25:50,970
And that boy...
is you

1187
02:25:53,511 --> 02:25:55,138
You....

1188
02:28:42,213 --> 02:28:44,443
l want to marry you.

1189
02:28:45,149 --> 02:28:47,777
Say that again.
- l want to marry you.

1190
02:28:53,558 --> 02:28:55,924
You're not marrying,
you're just running away.

1191
02:28:56,661 --> 02:28:57,923
Who from?
- Puja.

1192
02:28:58,229 --> 02:29:03,166
What nonsense!
- Then why does she feign headaches?

1193
02:29:03,668 --> 02:29:08,162
Why does she avoid us at breakfast
and also at dinners?

1194
02:29:08,773 --> 02:29:11,936
May l know what you've said to her,
for her to stop smiling.

1195
02:29:12,376 --> 02:29:16,608
What can l say to her?
ln fact, she said to me.

1196
02:29:17,148 --> 02:29:20,447
She?
What did she say?

1197
02:29:21,185 --> 02:29:24,621
She said something
which was very embarrassing.

1198
02:29:24,789 --> 02:29:28,281
So, her love for you is embarrassing?

1199
02:29:28,893 --> 02:29:33,956
She said she loved you, so you ran
to Anita and proposed.

1200
02:29:34,365 --> 02:29:36,765
What matured thinking!
Congratulations!

1201
02:29:37,068 --> 02:29:42,233
Are you blind? What's wrong with you?
See the difference in our ages.

1202
02:29:42,506 --> 02:29:45,907
l am and l've also seen the
difference between you and Pallavi.

1203
02:29:46,544 --> 02:29:48,239
Now get lost.

1204
02:29:49,013 --> 02:29:58,649
Another thing, go and tell her of your
engagement to Anita. Or do l do it?

1205
02:29:59,023 --> 02:30:04,393
No. That's my business.
and l'll do it myself.

1206
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,407
l'm marrying Anita.

1207
02:30:40,064 --> 02:30:42,828
l'd only heard of
stone-hearted men.

1208
02:30:44,669 --> 02:30:46,637
l have seen one today.

1209
02:30:53,077 --> 02:30:55,443
Cry, my dear...
Go ahead and cry.

1210
02:30:57,081 --> 02:30:59,447
Take me back.

1211
02:31:04,488 --> 02:31:09,721
Okay, dear.
We'll go back.

1212
02:31:19,770 --> 02:31:22,238
''This is the first time
l'm writing a letter''

1213
02:31:23,107 --> 02:31:25,473
''So l don't know
how to begin''

1214
02:31:26,510 --> 02:31:33,074
''When l fell in love with you,
l didn't even know what it meant''

1215
02:31:34,118 --> 02:31:38,418
''l'd be very hurt when you
went away without meeting me''

1216
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:44,091
''l'd cry for hours and never
even know why l was crying''

1217
02:31:45,496 --> 02:31:49,091
''But now l can understand why
l shed tears then''

1218
02:31:50,534 --> 02:31:56,268
''l want you to be happy.
So l have decided to return to lndia''

1219
02:31:57,475 --> 02:32:01,434
''l feel like signing off
as ''Yours, Puja''

1220
02:32:02,313 --> 02:32:04,838
''But since you have
not accepted me as your own...''

1221
02:32:05,149 --> 02:32:07,117
''l write just my name''

1222
02:33:14,819 --> 02:33:16,446
My portrait!

1223
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:45,546
''The dot on my forehead...''

1224
02:33:48,385 --> 02:33:50,751
''will drive your sleep away''

1225
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:57,149
''The dot on my forehead
will drive your sleep away...''

1226
02:33:57,461 --> 02:34:01,158
''just you wait and see''

1227
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:06,759
''The kohl in my eyes
will drive you crazy''

1228
02:34:07,705 --> 02:34:11,471
''The kohl in my eyes
will drive you crazy''

1229
02:34:11,976 --> 02:34:15,343
''Just you wait and see''

1230
02:34:17,214 --> 02:34:21,173
''The dot on my forehead
will drive your sleep away''

1231
02:34:21,519 --> 02:34:24,920
''Just you wait and see''

1232
02:34:51,582 --> 02:34:56,019
''When those heavy bangles
tinkle on my hands...''

1233
02:34:56,387 --> 02:35:01,017
''they'll send your
heart racing, my love''

1234
02:35:03,861 --> 02:35:07,763
''When those heavy bangles
tinkle on my hands...''

1235
02:35:08,232 --> 02:35:13,033
''they'll send your
heart racing, my love''

1236
02:35:18,509 --> 02:35:20,204
''These ear-rings...''

1237
02:35:20,511 --> 02:35:23,844
''will alienate you
from yourself''

1238
02:35:24,248 --> 02:35:26,443
''Just you wait and see''

1239
02:35:27,952 --> 02:35:31,444
''The dot on my forehead
will drive your sleep away''

1240
02:35:32,089 --> 02:35:36,048
''Just you wait and see''

1241
02:35:57,514 --> 02:36:01,917
''l will dress up
like a bride''

1242
02:36:02,519 --> 02:36:06,478
''l will talk to you''

1243
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:18,725
''l will dress up like a bride
and talk to you''

1244
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:23,265
''The flowers in my hair...''

1245
02:36:24,541 --> 02:36:30,502
''The flowers in my hair
will make you act like a bee''

1246
02:36:30,948 --> 02:36:33,508
''Just you wait and see''

1247
02:36:34,451 --> 02:36:40,083
''The dot on my forehead
will drive away your sleep''

1248
02:36:40,624 --> 02:36:42,922
''Just you wait and see''

1249
02:37:08,786 --> 02:37:12,722
''Whatever you like,
even l do''

1250
02:37:13,624 --> 02:37:18,561
''My life lies
closed in your fist''

1251
02:37:20,731 --> 02:37:25,168
''Whatever you like,
even l do''

1252
02:37:25,669 --> 02:37:30,572
''My life lies
closed in your fist''

1253
02:37:35,579 --> 02:37:42,815
''l will do just as you say...
just you wait and see''

1254
02:37:45,222 --> 02:37:51,593
''The dot on my forehead
will drive your sleep away''

1255
02:37:54,932 --> 02:37:57,025
''My eyes, my bangles...''

1256
02:37:57,434 --> 02:37:59,629
''My veil and my body...''

1257
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:04,637
''my looks and my dot...''

1258
02:38:06,343 --> 02:38:09,801
''will drive your sleep away,
just you wait and see''

1259
02:38:56,660 --> 02:38:58,355
What's all this?

1260
02:38:58,662 --> 02:39:05,761
That's what l mean too. Why do you
say that you don't love me?

1261
02:39:06,570 --> 02:39:08,003
Because it's the truth.

1262
02:39:08,572 --> 02:39:14,909
Had it been so, l'd have accepted it.
But whom are you hiding it from?

1263
02:39:15,546 --> 02:39:19,175
Are you afraid of her memory
who never loved you anyway?

1264
02:39:22,152 --> 02:39:28,250
Or are you conscious about our age?
But love has never bothered with it.

1265
02:39:28,692 --> 02:39:31,160
Someone has to be younger
than the other.

1266
02:39:32,996 --> 02:39:37,057
Please don't be afraid to say
that you love me.

1267
02:39:38,702 --> 02:39:41,671
l don't.
- You don't?

1268
02:39:42,206 --> 02:39:43,230
No, l don't.

1269
02:39:43,574 --> 02:39:46,668
Really?
Then what's this?

1270
02:39:55,786 --> 02:40:02,692
Please don't lie now.
lf this is the truth, then say so.

1271
02:40:03,494 --> 02:40:05,894
There's only one difference
between the portrait and me...

1272
02:40:06,730 --> 02:40:10,097
And it's a pinch of ''Sindhoor''.

1273
02:40:12,102 --> 02:40:12,830
Take it.

1274
02:40:18,075 --> 02:40:22,205
What you thinking about?
Just go ahead about it.

1275
02:40:25,249 --> 02:40:28,446
Difference, eh?
Come, l'll show you.

1276
02:40:52,609 --> 02:40:57,911
ls this pin yours? These ear-rings?
This handkerchief?

1277
02:41:01,451 --> 02:41:03,749
Look at those photos?

1278
02:41:04,454 --> 02:41:09,414
Did you write these letters?
Go on, tell me.

1279
02:41:10,627 --> 02:41:14,586
No. They are not yours.
They are your mother's!

1280
02:41:28,712 --> 02:41:31,613
You loved my mother?

1281
02:41:41,491 --> 02:41:45,655
That means you always saw
my mother in me.

1282
02:41:49,232 --> 02:41:53,464
You used to remember
your past seeing me.

1283
02:41:56,173 --> 02:42:02,134
When l used to laugh,
you used to hear her laugh.

1284
02:42:03,847 --> 02:42:08,807
Now l understand, why you
always avoided meeting me.

1285
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:14,286
My birthday falls on may Mother's
death Anniversary.

1286
02:42:14,858 --> 02:42:19,818
You used to come for that, but my
birthday was just a duty to you.

1287
02:42:20,931 --> 02:42:25,061
l was never a living thing to you,
but just a memory of someone.

1288
02:42:28,939 --> 02:42:34,002
l can take on the whole world for you,
but l can't fight a shadow.

1289
02:42:36,279 --> 02:42:42,843
You may have loved my mother.
But she loved only one man.

1290
02:42:43,954 --> 02:42:49,324
And that was Siddharth Bhatnagar,
who was my father.

1291
02:42:55,599 --> 02:43:00,559
You're very right. There's a lot
of difference between them and me.

1292
02:43:02,506 --> 02:43:10,072
You've spent 20 years of your life,
loving a woman, who never loved you.

1293
02:43:11,982 --> 02:43:16,885
And l'll spend all my life,
loving a man...

1294
02:43:19,122 --> 02:43:21,090
who doesn't love me.

1295
02:44:09,206 --> 02:44:11,174
This is Viren here.

1296
02:44:11,742 --> 02:44:13,437
l'm all right.

1297
02:44:14,878 --> 02:44:17,847
Daija and Puja will arrive in Delhi
by the Air lndia flight today.

1298
02:44:19,082 --> 02:44:21,380
l want you to receive them.

1299
02:44:21,818 --> 02:44:24,116
And do call me the
moment they arrive.

1300
02:44:24,588 --> 02:44:26,556
Yes, tell him.

1301
02:44:42,739 --> 02:44:46,436
Look after Puja, Daija.
- You take care too.

1302
02:44:48,178 --> 02:44:51,443
Let me know when you fix
a date for the wedding.

1303
02:44:52,949 --> 02:44:56,146
You will come, won't you?
- l'll try to make it.

1304
02:44:58,522 --> 02:45:02,481
l can understand, Daija.
But please do come back.

1305
02:45:04,861 --> 02:45:08,558
l feel so very lonely
without you.

1306
02:45:10,967 --> 02:45:17,566
And l'm not myself without you, son.

1307
02:45:19,209 --> 02:45:24,112
l'm the midwife who
forgot she's a midwife.

1308
02:45:25,148 --> 02:45:29,915
l have come to be your mother.
And l see dreams for you...

1309
02:45:30,687 --> 02:45:33,121
something a midwife
must never do.

1310
02:45:35,559 --> 02:45:37,527
Why must you say such things?

1311
02:45:38,728 --> 02:45:44,257
Will you stay back,
if l ask you to?

1312
02:45:45,235 --> 02:45:47,135
Try saying it...

1313
02:45:57,147 --> 02:46:01,914
Let me know of your arrival
the moment you reach there.

1314
02:46:04,387 --> 02:46:06,878
Let's leave. Or we'll
miss the flight.

1315
02:46:22,939 --> 02:46:24,907
Aren't you coming?

1316
02:46:25,942 --> 02:46:28,638
No, you see them off.

1317
02:46:58,975 --> 02:47:01,273
Look after Viren.

1318
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:07,746
Do not bear a grudge against him
for my sake.

1319
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:23,454
You didn't attend office today.
- l wasn't in the mood.

1320
02:48:26,229 --> 02:48:31,189
l've got to talk to you, Prem.
Sit down.

1321
02:48:36,239 --> 02:48:39,766
l've been thinking...
- About what?

1322
02:48:41,778 --> 02:48:45,214
ln general.
- What have you decided then?

1323
02:48:47,250 --> 02:48:51,949
We have been friends for
a very long time, Prem.

1324
02:48:52,689 --> 02:48:57,888
l see. Anita must've told you.
She can't keep anything to herself.

1325
02:48:59,262 --> 02:49:00,889
So?

1326
02:49:02,265 --> 02:49:06,395
l feel as if l've been taking undue
advantage of our relationship.

1327
02:49:07,270 --> 02:49:09,238
Go on. l'm listening.

1328
02:49:09,672 --> 02:49:14,234
You have your folks in Delhi.
And a house too.

1329
02:49:14,811 --> 02:49:18,577
Your parents and your siblings...
your roots are there.

1330
02:49:22,352 --> 02:49:24,912
You have given me
18 years of your life.

1331
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:30,589
Have l nothing to
give you in return?

1332
02:49:31,027 --> 02:49:38,263
Why not? You can thank me
and come to the point.

1333
02:49:39,803 --> 02:49:43,933
l want to hear you say it, Viren.

1334
02:49:47,410 --> 02:49:50,607
l'm not worthy of your
friendship and favours, Prem.

1335
02:49:54,317 --> 02:49:57,286
l'm not worth someone
ruining his life for me.

1336
02:50:02,325 --> 02:50:06,625
Go away, Prem.
Go and make your own life.

1337
02:50:08,331 --> 02:50:10,891
You owe something to
yourself, don't you?

1338
02:50:12,335 --> 02:50:15,702
ln any case, l don't need to
cry on your shoulders.

1339
02:50:16,673 --> 02:50:18,300
l'm doing it in solitude anyway.

1340
02:50:20,210 --> 02:50:23,646
Who do you think you are?
God Almighty?

1341
02:50:24,681 --> 02:50:27,309
D'you think you can change people's
lives at your whims?

1342
02:50:28,351 --> 02:50:32,310
You couldn't tell Pallavi that you
love her... that isn't my fault!

1343
02:50:34,591 --> 02:50:37,116
That Pallavi loved Siddharth,
wasn't Daija's mistake, was it?

1344
02:50:37,427 --> 02:50:41,193
You have withdrawn in a shell
and taken solace in Anita.

1345
02:50:43,366 --> 02:50:45,994
You are afraid of falling in love.
You're a bloody coward!

1346
02:50:46,703 --> 02:50:49,729
Return every moment to me that
we have spent in our friendship!

1347
02:50:50,173 --> 02:50:52,334
You deserve neither my friendship
nor Puja's love!

1348
02:50:52,775 --> 02:50:56,336
You're a smouldering fire...
anyone who touches you will be burnt!

1349
02:50:58,181 --> 02:51:04,017
So what l am to do?
- Try and speak the truth!

1350
02:51:04,654 --> 02:51:09,216
You have lied to me all your life.
But try facing the truth.

1351
02:51:09,659 --> 02:51:13,026
Look within! lt's Puja who has made
a place in your heart, not Pallavi!

1352
02:51:13,429 --> 02:51:16,091
What rubbish! Puja
is Pallavi's daughter!

1353
02:51:16,599 --> 02:51:20,365
Not true! She's also Siddharth
Bhatnagar's daughter!

1354
02:51:21,137 --> 02:51:25,096
How was Pallavi related to you?
She wasn't.

1355
02:51:25,808 --> 02:51:28,106
Your love was one-sided.

1356
02:51:28,678 --> 02:51:30,771
So stop this game
of hide-n-seek.

1357
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:33,048
lt's not a solo sport!

1358
02:51:33,483 --> 02:51:36,043
And if you must,
at least change your style!

1359
02:51:36,553 --> 02:51:41,388
For how will you live in hiding?
Hiding behind Pallavi and Anita...?

1360
02:51:41,858 --> 02:51:44,383
Come out of the cocoon
and search.

1361
02:51:44,928 --> 02:51:47,396
Search for whom?
- The one who's not Pallavi!

1362
02:51:48,431 --> 02:51:51,400
You must understand the difference
between Puja and Pallavi.

1363
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:54,665
Pallavi didn't ever love you.

1364
02:51:55,438 --> 02:51:59,397
And Puja knows nothing
except her love for you.

1365
02:52:00,610 --> 02:52:05,809
You must understand the difference,
Viren Pratap Singh! You must!

1366
02:52:27,303 --> 02:52:29,737
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1367
02:52:30,306 --> 02:52:36,267
We've been here 2 months now.
But you've left your laughter behind.

1368
02:52:36,980 --> 02:52:38,709
No, my dear.

1369
02:52:41,618 --> 02:52:47,250
You go back to London and get back
your cheerfulness from him.

1370
02:52:47,757 --> 02:52:52,057
lf he stops you from returning,
tell him you can't leave me alone.

1371
02:52:52,695 --> 02:52:55,960
She may not be mine,
But l've brought her up.

1372
02:52:56,499 --> 02:52:58,467
You dare such a thing again!

1373
02:52:58,901 --> 02:53:01,995
You're as much a stranger
to me, as Viren is.

1374
02:53:02,672 --> 02:53:05,971
l'm neither your mother, nor his.

1375
02:53:06,576 --> 02:53:09,807
Maybe that's why you both have
a right to hurt me.

1376
02:53:10,513 --> 02:53:16,145
l don't want to do that, Daija.
But see how ironic life is.

1377
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:22,890
l want to see you and him happy,
but l've become a bane to you both.

1378
02:53:25,528 --> 02:53:29,487
ls there a way by which
l can make you both happy?

1379
02:53:30,633 --> 02:53:33,500
Yes, my dear.
- How?

1380
02:53:33,970 --> 02:53:35,460
By getting married.

1381
02:53:40,810 --> 02:53:45,509
As long as you don't marry,
he'll never forgive himself.

1382
02:53:49,619 --> 02:53:55,524
ls that all? Why didn't you say it?
l'll do anything for his happiness.

1383
02:53:56,893 --> 02:53:58,690
Bless you, dear.

1384
02:54:00,997 --> 02:54:03,158
But on one condition...
- What?

1385
02:54:03,766 --> 02:54:07,532
That he marries first.
He is elder to me, after all.

1386
02:54:08,571 --> 02:54:11,131
And he has admitted to me already.

1387
02:54:12,575 --> 02:54:15,544
Okay. l'll phone Viren today.

1388
02:54:32,595 --> 02:54:35,359
How are you?
- How will l be?

1389
02:54:36,999 --> 02:54:38,967
She is ready to get married.

1390
02:54:49,846 --> 02:54:51,006
What's the matter?

1391
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:54,581
ls she really willing
to get married?

1392
02:54:55,017 --> 02:54:59,386
Yes, but on one condition.
That you marry before her.

1393
02:54:59,789 --> 02:55:01,256
My marriage?

1394
02:55:01,624 --> 02:55:05,583
Yes, if you wish to
marry Anita, do so.

1395
02:55:06,028 --> 02:55:08,588
So that l'll be free
of Puja's condition.

1396
02:55:11,033 --> 02:55:15,595
Give my love to Anita and
send us an invitation.

1397
02:55:16,038 --> 02:55:18,199
l'll be happy with that.

1398
02:55:18,674 --> 02:55:23,168
Cards will be sent on your name.
l've nobody else of family anyway.

1399
02:55:24,313 --> 02:55:25,940
Bless you.

1400
02:55:56,679 --> 02:55:59,978
What are you doing?
- l'm trying to convince you.

1401
02:56:02,018 --> 02:56:06,648
l hope you are convinced now
that l belong only to you.

1402
02:56:12,695 --> 02:56:15,061
Shut your eyes.
- What for?

1403
02:56:15,698 --> 02:56:19,395
Didn't you say you saw Pallavi
every time you shut your eyes?

1404
02:56:19,869 --> 02:56:21,837
Close your eyes...

1405
02:56:34,383 --> 02:56:37,682
Was it Pallavi again?
- No.

1406
02:56:51,400 --> 02:56:53,027
Congratulations!

1407
02:56:55,137 --> 02:56:57,105
They must be married by now.

1408
02:57:01,744 --> 02:57:07,705
Anita really loves him, doesn't she?
l'm very happy now.

1409
02:57:18,461 --> 02:57:21,259
l had promised you l'd phone you
after the wedding.

1410
02:57:21,764 --> 02:57:24,130
All went off well, l hope.
- Yes.

1411
02:57:24,767 --> 02:57:29,067
May God keep you both happy.
- You'll come now, won't you?

1412
02:57:29,438 --> 02:57:35,468
Yes, l will, the moment
Puja gets married.

1413
02:57:35,711 --> 02:57:39,238
l'll wait... - o.k
- Aunty, bye.

1414
02:57:42,818 --> 02:57:45,753
Well, he has kept his promise.

1415
02:57:46,589 --> 02:57:49,558
l'll go and fix
with the boy's parents.

1416
02:57:53,195 --> 02:57:55,163
l'll not marry.

1417
02:57:57,867 --> 02:58:02,270
And if l'm in your way
to go to London,...

1418
02:58:02,805 --> 02:58:05,171
l'll commit suicide
to make way for you.

1419
02:58:05,808 --> 02:58:07,776
But l will not marry.

1420
02:58:08,044 --> 02:58:11,275
But you had promised me.

1421
02:58:13,816 --> 02:58:17,513
Can't l do even this much,
for his happiness?

1422
02:58:18,054 --> 02:58:20,022
What will l tell him
if he comes?

1423
02:58:22,525 --> 02:58:27,155
There'll be no need to tell him.
He'll understand it on his own.

1424
02:58:28,030 --> 02:58:31,193
What of your future, dear?

1425
02:58:32,501 --> 02:58:37,803
Till now l was thinking about him.
Now l'll think about myself.

1426
02:58:39,241 --> 02:58:41,801
l've a whole lifetime
to think now.

1427
02:58:44,180 --> 02:58:46,148
l'll go now.

1428
02:58:52,855 --> 02:58:55,824
What are you thinking of?
- Daija.

1429
02:58:57,526 --> 02:59:02,828
Don't know why, but she's avoiding
coming here. Keeps postponing it.

1430
02:59:03,265 --> 02:59:05,631
Maybe she wants you to
get her here personally.

1431
02:59:07,870 --> 02:59:09,565
Will you come?

1432
02:59:09,872 --> 02:59:12,170
l'll come with you.
lt's been ages since l visited lndia.

1433
02:59:12,541 --> 02:59:14,509
l'll phone her.
- No, don't

1434
02:59:14,944 --> 02:59:17,572
lf we surprise her,
it'll be something great.

1435
02:59:17,880 --> 02:59:19,848
That's true.
Now let's get out of here.

1436
02:59:29,525 --> 02:59:31,857
Aunty come.

1437
02:59:32,228 --> 02:59:34,526
You two! How come all of a sudden?

1438
02:59:34,697 --> 02:59:39,862
l don't know about him?
But l missed you. So here l am.

1439
02:59:43,239 --> 02:59:44,672
Be happy.

1440
02:59:44,907 --> 02:59:48,206
No, l won't. Because till
he's happy, l can never be.

1441
02:59:48,577 --> 02:59:50,545
That's my eternal view.

1442
02:59:50,813 --> 02:59:53,873
Enough. Just tell me,
why isn't Anita with you?

1443
02:59:54,316 --> 03:00:00,186
We've planned to kidnap you to London.
So, hurry up and start packing.

1444
03:00:00,322 --> 03:00:02,688
l'm asking why didn't
you bring Anita?

1445
03:00:02,958 --> 03:00:05,358
She also keeps on asking,
why don't you get Daija?

1446
03:00:05,728 --> 03:00:07,696
How can l come?
- That's your problem.

1447
03:00:08,030 --> 03:00:10,498
You can sail or fly.

1448
03:00:10,933 --> 03:00:14,232
We can discuss this later.
We've come to take you from here.

1449
03:00:14,603 --> 03:00:17,902
And what about Puja?
- Why, what's her problem?

1450
03:00:18,674 --> 03:00:20,471
The same as before.

1451
03:00:24,947 --> 03:00:27,313
Why are you looking
at them like that?

1452
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:30,913
lf she refused to marry,
what could l do?

1453
03:00:36,292 --> 03:00:38,920
She didn't marry?

1454
03:00:39,962 --> 03:00:43,261
But you said she had this
one condition.

1455
03:00:46,335 --> 03:00:47,529
Where is she?

1456
03:00:47,770 --> 03:00:50,261
By the time Rana arrived,
it was all over.

1457
03:00:50,973 --> 03:00:55,535
The moon was in the skies;
lonely and sad.

1458
03:00:56,979 --> 03:00:59,607
Rana looked at the sad moon...

1459
03:01:00,116 --> 03:01:04,519
and eventually disappeared
in the lifeless moonlight.

1460
03:01:06,055 --> 03:01:08,956
This is how, perhaps,
every love story must end.

1461
03:01:09,992 --> 03:01:13,359
There are bodies everywhere;
but not the same souls.

1462
03:01:14,063 --> 03:01:20,298
What remains are memories of
the moments spent in love.

1463
03:01:21,704 --> 03:01:25,970
And these are the memories that
take the form of a love story.

1464
03:02:08,717 --> 03:02:10,014
Wait.

1465
03:02:19,061 --> 03:02:24,522
What are you staring for?
lt's me.

1466
03:02:26,535 --> 03:02:28,366
How are you?

1467
03:02:29,405 --> 03:02:30,770
l'm fine.

1468
03:02:31,407 --> 03:02:34,535
Are you happy?
- Yes.

1469
03:02:35,945 --> 03:02:37,708
Very happy?

1470
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:40,310
l don't measure my happiness.

1471
03:02:41,083 --> 03:02:44,712
How is your husband?
- He's nice.

1472
03:02:45,754 --> 03:02:47,722
When you will introduce
him to me?

1473
03:02:48,090 --> 03:02:50,058
One of these days.

1474
03:02:50,492 --> 03:02:53,052
Why be so vague?
Why not today itself?

1475
03:02:54,096 --> 03:02:57,463
Today he's not here.
- Don't lie!

1476
03:02:59,101 --> 03:03:00,864
What have l lied about?

1477
03:03:01,136 --> 03:03:06,597
You lied that you'll introduce us.
How can you, when you're not married?

1478
03:03:07,276 --> 03:03:09,437
Aren't you ashamed?

1479
03:03:12,114 --> 03:03:14,082
Who are you to question me?

1480
03:03:14,483 --> 03:03:20,683
And when l spoke the truth,
you did not believe me.

1481
03:03:21,123 --> 03:03:23,091
And today you're angry
about my lying to you.

1482
03:03:23,425 --> 03:03:26,087
l'm not a shadow to be insensitive.

1483
03:03:26,562 --> 03:03:30,430
You're ever stepping the limits.
- Love and truth know no limits.

1484
03:03:30,866 --> 03:03:33,892
l lied to you because you don't
have the guts to hear the truth.

1485
03:03:34,370 --> 03:03:36,634
And suppose l'd
have believed the lie?

1486
03:03:37,006 --> 03:03:38,701
So what's the big deal?

1487
03:03:38,941 --> 03:03:44,607
Then l'd have probably
married Anita by now.

1488
03:03:49,151 --> 03:03:51,119
Didn't you...?

1489
03:03:52,154 --> 03:03:54,714
l've answered your
question already.

1490
03:03:55,624 --> 03:03:58,115
But that invitation...

1491
03:03:59,094 --> 03:04:02,063
You could lie so blatantly?
- Do you think only you can lie?

1492
03:04:04,667 --> 03:04:06,635
And what of Anita?

1493
03:04:07,036 --> 03:04:10,631
She's a very good friend of mine.
And will always be so.

1494
03:04:11,507 --> 03:04:13,475
But l've never loved her.

1495
03:04:15,177 --> 03:04:18,146
Then whom have you loved?

1496
03:04:21,183 --> 03:04:22,946
You.

1497
03:04:25,187 --> 03:04:26,552
Me?

1498
03:04:28,190 --> 03:04:30,158
Or my face?

1499
03:04:33,195 --> 03:04:37,564
Your face is not somebody else's.
lt's your own.

1500
03:04:39,501 --> 03:04:41,662
Your laughter is your own.

1501
03:04:43,205 --> 03:04:45,298
And so are your eyes.

1502
03:04:46,608 --> 03:04:48,803
And the luster in them
is only yours too..

1503
03:04:50,446 --> 03:04:53,745
Your scent is not mixed
with anybody else's, Puja.

1504
03:04:55,351 --> 03:04:57,376
You're not a portrait
of somebody else.

1505
03:04:57,720 --> 03:04:58,948
You are you.

1506
03:05:00,556 --> 03:05:01,818
And only you.

1507
03:05:04,226 --> 03:05:07,195
You belong to me.

1508
03:05:08,230 --> 03:05:11,199
l'm saying this for the first time
in my life.

1509
03:05:13,068 --> 03:05:14,933
l love you.

1510
03:05:43,032 --> 03:05:50,268
''Sometimes, this thought
comes to my mind''

1511
03:05:51,273 --> 03:05:59,203
''That you were created
specially for me''

1512
03:06:00,282 --> 03:06:07,518
''That you were hiding
somewhere among the stars''

1513
03:06:08,824 --> 03:06:16,230
''And now, you're sent down
on earth for me''

1514
03:06:17,266 --> 03:06:21,225
''Sometimes this thought
comes to my mind''

1515
03:06:21,737 --> 03:06:29,143
''Sometimes l'll say it...
At times, you say it''

1516
03:06:30,446 --> 03:06:36,578
''That l've given my heart to you''

1517
03:06:36,819 --> 03:06:43,782
''Sometimes l hear it...
at times, you'll hear it''

1518
03:06:45,461 --> 03:06:51,297
''That l've given my heart to you''
