Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:20,294
Let everyone know a son
is born in chaudhary family.

28
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,730
There are wealthy
people in Udaipur..

29
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,431
..but all they will give is sweets.

30
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,869
They won't get silver coins.

31
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,602
Naresh Singh.
- Yes.

32
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,074
Distribute it among everyone.

33
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,347
And remember. These are gold coins.

34
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,008
Everyone should get one.

35
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,108
The wealthy people of Udaipur..

36
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,487
..should know that Rathore
family showers gold..

37
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,892
..even on the birth of a daughter.

38
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,390
Mommy.

39
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,395
How are you, son?

40
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,773
My prince.

41
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,470
Take the child in your arms.

42
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,373
Look at how he's staring at you.

43
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,045
I will take him in my arms
and kiss him on the forehead.

44
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,451
But, first let me
give my queen her gift.

45
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,488
She's given me this beautiful gift.

46
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,804
Everyone says he's the torchbearer
of chaudhary family.

47
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,373
I say, he's a hero.

48
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,908
See, sister-in-law.

49
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,382
Another angel born
in the Rathore family.

50
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,042
I can hear the windows
of my enemy clatter.

51
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,728
Give him to me.

52
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,469
Give her to me.

53
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,740
This is a miracle.

54
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,067
God..

55
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,842
Maybe these children..

56
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,847
..will end the enmity
between these two families.

57
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,607
Even if they don't..

58
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,646
..but I wish these children
don't create a catastrophe.

59
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,523
Ya!

60
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,834
Will you be my valentine?

61
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,599
I was talking about her.

62
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,374
Sorry.
- Let's go.

63
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,740

We are waiting for you.

68
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,668
Dear friend happy valentine day.

69
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,870
You're always late.
- Sorry. Last time.

70
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,848
I was having breakfast
when you called.

71
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,724
Yes. The phone was close-by
but I couldn't answer it.

72
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,027
You know what,
my dad gets really angry.

73
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,517
You know what he says.

74
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,597
He says When you eat, only eat..

75
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,993
..when you talk, only talk.

76
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,960
Everyone's crazy
about me in college.

77
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,997
You know I'm flooded
with valentines.

78
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,540
After all, I've to choose.

79
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,577
Let's see who I reject today.

80
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,670
Okay, bye.

81
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,693
Karan.

82
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,036
This toast looks like shukhe's face.

83
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,466
Dekha is ki sakal haina!

84
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,274
Hey, Karan.

87
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,407
Hey, Shakira.

Dekh-Dekh.

89
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,912
Am telling you.

90
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,820
What happened?

91
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,561
Do you have a valentine?

92
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,866
Tell me if you do, I'll step back.

93
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,329
I won't mind either.

94
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,000
We'll still be friends.

95
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,336
come. come. come.

96
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,870
Are you okay?
- Why are you breaking her heart?

97
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,976
couldn't you be her
valentine for a day?

98
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,442
Say yes.

99
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,386
Yes, Krishna is right.

100
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,318
You should agree to pick
her Valentine's Day date.

101
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,888
Look at her face
when Karan said yes.

102
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,488
If I had said yes,
she would've died of shock.

103
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,625
This happens in love.

104
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,592
Go, mind your own business.

105
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,531
And let us live in our own world.

106
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,259
come, Shakira, darling.

107
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,438
Thanks, Karan. You saved me
from being the butt of their joke.

108
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,373
But you should've
seen their faces..

109
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,345
..when you held my hand.

110
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,683
Shakira.

111
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,310
They're still following us.

112
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,610
continue.

113
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,452
Darling. Tell me, where
are you taking me for Valentines?

114
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,990
You say, where do you want to go?

115
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,824
No, place of your choice. You say.

116
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,556

Okay.

Bye.

123
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,112
Hi, Karishma.

00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,789
Sorry, I'm a minute late.

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,754
We're meeting after so long.

My angel.

135
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,086

Hello, there.

00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,901
Who are you?

141
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:05,572
I feel something
for the first time.

142
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,858
You stole my heart.

143
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,926
At first sight.

I've seen beauty around me.

151
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:38,399
But there's no one
as gorgeous as you.

152
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,743
Your praises has knocked
me out of my senses.

153
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:57,049
The earth's slipping
from under my feet.

154
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,752
I've gone crazy too.

155
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,330
It's difficult to control it now.

156
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,632
The eyes have
revealed everything.

157
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,473
Don't say a word more.

158
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:28,511
You stole my heart.

159
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,721

Strange.

00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,020
It's your birthday,
and she's cutting the cake.

184
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,032
Why? - Because, Krishnan,
it must be her birthday too.

185
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,025
'Happy birthday Nimi, Simi, Kimi.'

186
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,064
'Whatever your name is.'

187
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,799
'Thanks, Lucky, Rocky, Jockey.'

188
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,406
'Whatever your name is.'

189
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,942
Many, many happy
returns of the day.

190
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,468
Thank you.

191
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,647
Wow!
- Here's Karan's cake.

192
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,345
Happy birthday to you!

193
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,087
Happy birthday to you!

194
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,923
'Happy birthday Lucky,
Rocky, Jockey.'

195
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,586
'Whatever your name is.'

196
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,996
'Thanks, Nimi, Simi, Kimi.'

197
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:54,996
'Whatever your name is.'

198
00:18:58,704 --> 00:18:59,671
Shall we?
- Let's go.

199
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,442
Hey, man, where are you?

200
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,447
What are you trying to do?

201
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,715
Someone's already with her.

202
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,657
I was only watching her.

203
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,557
Her name is Karishma.

204
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,026
She's doing the summer
semester in our college.

205
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,294
But the boy with him,
I saw him for the first time.

206
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,355
Sorry.

207
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:03,823
It's okay.

208
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,562
But promise me..
- What?

209
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,936
You won't bump into
anyone else like this.

210
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,057
One ice-cream please.

211
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,903
Other language(Zinkoya)

212
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,404
Sorry.

213
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,107
Okay.

214
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,681
But promise me..

215
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:57,921
What?

216
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,617
You won't bump into
anyone else like this.

217
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,064
Karishma.

218
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,133
Yes, aunty.

219
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,041
Here, drink your milk.

220
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,543
Aunty, I am really
sleepy and not in the mood.

221
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,812
What do you mean, not in the mood?

222
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,683
I'm keeping it right here.
Finish it.

223
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,380
Not in the mood.

224
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,436
Hi, sister Sandhya.

225
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,492
How are you?

226
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,467
So, how was Valentine's Day?

227
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,630
Very good.

228
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,774
And him? How was he?

229
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,504
He's...nice.

230
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,470
Slightly crazy.

231
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,081
So, madam,
how many points do you give him?

232
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,619
8 out of 10.

233
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,087
Thank God you liked him.

234
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,320
You will be really
happy with Rajveer.

235
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,383
Rajveer?

236
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,392
Yes, Rajveer!

237
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,763
Strange, you even forgot his name

238
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,836
No, no, no.
But I didn't like his name.

239
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,968
I asked him to change his name.

240
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,431
Lucky, Rocky, Jockey. Anything.

241
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,036
But not Rajveer.

242
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,501
And?

243
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,510
And he agreed.

244
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,570
You're completely insane.

245
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,916
Sister, I'll call you tomorrow.

246
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,543
I'm really sleepy.

247
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,280
Look after yourself.
Goodnight.

248
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,555
Wonder what will happen to him?

249
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,381
Who? Karishma?

250
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,820
No, Rajveer

251
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,318
She didn't like his name
and asked him to change it.

252
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,651
She was right.

253
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:19,786
It isn't a nice name.

254
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:20,991
There're better.

255
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,766
Rahul, Rohit,
Siddharth, Aditya, Karan. Right?

256
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,527
Mother, you too..

257
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,768
This is a big problem
of the parents in lndia.

258
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,631
They find a boy of their choice..

259
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,573
..and get their
daughter married to him.

260
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,841
Without finding
out the girl's choice.

261
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,640
Her likes, dislikes.

262
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,775
Really.
This is a big problem of lndia.,

263
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,819
..and all other problems
look small compared to it.

264
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,644
You agree too, don't you?
- Hundred percent.

265
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,778
Great.

266
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,357
You! Here!

267
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,892
Yes, me. Here.

268
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,122
Speak softly.
Aunt will wake up.

269
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,426
But you're speaking loudly as well.

270
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,555
How did you come here?

271
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,656
I climbed over the gate.

272
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,791
I've taken a lot of risk.

273
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,594
Look, I'm injured too.

274
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,669
call me, crazy, mad, or insane.

275
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,603
Whatever.
- No.

276
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,876
I'll have to think
of something else.

277
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,812
I never came across
a character like you..

278
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,074
..in any love story or novel.

279
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,679
You better leave.

280
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,675
What if aunt wakes
up and finds you?

281
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,279
I cannot do that.

282
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,819
I've taken the
risk of coming here..

283
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,652
..I cannot take the
risk of going back.

284
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:20,756
I don't know all that.

285
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,521
Just get up and leave.

286
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,753
Aunt will wake up.

287
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,627
Think about it once.

288
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,730
These things happening with us.

289
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,732
We've nothing to do with it..

290
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,096
..but they're just happening.

291
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,103
But you don't mind it either.

292
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,005
Do you mind?

293
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:47,907
No.

294
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,317
Then let's sit and talk.

295
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,016
Know about me.

296
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,720
Tell me about yourself.

297
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,553
My name is Karan chaudhary.

298
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,029
And I am from Udaipur.
- Udaipur?

299
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,497
I'm from Udaipur too.

300
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,897
See, we've found one connection.

301
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,368
Karishma, l..
- I didn't tell you my name.

302
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,896
It came out from here. Here.

303
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,737
Oh my god! Is it that honest?

304
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,676
This is the only honest place.

305
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,972
I tell you. Just listen to it.

306
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,350
Don't worry about uncle, aunty.

307
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,648
And understand this night,
the ambience.

308
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,721
Understand me, and yourself.

309
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,388
You're right.

310
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,869
This moment or this
night will never return.

311
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,532
Let's forget about dreams.

312
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,565
Slumber.

313
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,798
The milk.

314
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,846
Why are you laughing?

315
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,451
Actually...

316
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,678
Actually I was thinking..

317
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,782
..had there been
a dog on your gate.

318
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,717
..then either one of us
would've been in the hospital.

319
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,325
Every time I see you.

320
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,826
Every time I come around.

321
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,925
I'm sure I am falling for you.

322
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,300
Frozen in love.

323
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,998
come let me feel you brighter.

324
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,764
Why?

325
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,800
Why?

326
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,868
Why?

327
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,004
Why?

328
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,680
Why?

329
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,412
I don't know why,
but my heart beats for you.

330
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,552
Why does the heart beat?

331
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,959
Why? Why? Why?

332
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,723
Why does one fall in love?

333
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,924
Why? Why? Why?

334
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:21,995
The sweet...pain in my heart.

335
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,300
Why does it torment me?

336
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,675
Why? Why? Why?

337
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,575
Why does the heart beat?

338
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,877
Why? Why? Why?

339
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,677
Why does one fall in love?

340
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,946
Why? Why? Why?

341
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:43,484
The sweet...pain in my heart.

342
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:47,360
Why does it torment me?

343
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,831
Why? Why? Why?

344
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:03,712
You. When I look at you.

345
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,681
There's something I feel.

346
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,850
You're in my thoughts.

347
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,524
My feelings.

348
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,353
You dwell in my heart.

349
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,297
You're always close to me.

350
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,668
You're special for me.

351
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,065
Why does the heart beat?

352
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,673
Why? Why? Why?

353
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,436
Why does one fall in love?

354
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,639
Why? Why? Why?

355
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:43,983
The sweet...pain in my heart.

356
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,950
Why does it torment me?

357
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,550
Why? Why? Why?

358
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,661
Every time I see you.

359
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,993
Every time I come around.

360
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,868
I'm sure I am falling for you.

361
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,405
Frozen in love.

362
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,341
come let me feel you brighter.

363
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,477
come on silly.

364
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,324
What are you doing
here at this late hour?

365
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,688
I was missing you.
- What?

366
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,256
But we spent the evening together.

367
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,835
Yes, but we didn't
have dinner together.

368
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,065
So I thought let's have ice-cream.

369
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,807
Okay, but there's the ice-cream.
- Here it is.

370
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,536
This is an ice-cream?

371
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,940
This is just the cone.

372
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,573
Here's...the ice-cream.

373
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,886
Sorry, it was melting so..
you know l..

374
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,611
Yeah, I know.

375
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,979
Thank you.

376
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,380
Hey. Hey.

377
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,337
Karan, what happened?

378
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:13,833
Karan.

379
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,010
What happened?

380
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,876
Karan. Karan. Are you alright?

381
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,972
What happened?

382
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,406
Karan.

383
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,713
What happened?

384
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,711
What happened?

385
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,353
You!

386
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,361
I'm going to kill you.
- Karishma.

387
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,629
Aunty.
Study. Study.

388
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,725
Go there.
- Karishma.

389
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,062
Karishma.

390
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,410
Here. Finish it completely..

391
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,706
..or I won't make
it next time. Right.

392
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,574
Purshottam Rathore.

393
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,055
Hello.
- Hi, mom.

394
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,393
Karan. How are you, son?

395
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,727
Mom, do we have a problem
with the Rathore family?

396
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,567
I mean, is everything
fine back there?

397
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:19,732
Son.

398
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,979
Why are you asking about him?

399
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,673
Did someone..

400
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,451
Did someone say something?
- No, mom. That's not it.

401
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,979
Actually,
I've a friend in college..

402
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,722
..and he's their distant relative.

403
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,486
Karan. Are you okay?

404
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,620
Like I said, mom. It's nothing.

405
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,529
Mom. I'll call you later.

406
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,359
'Did I have to fall
in love with her?'

407
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,507
Everything fine... There he is.

408
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,380
So you've forgotten
all about your friends.

409
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,788
Where were you yesterday?
We were waiting at Hanna's house.

410
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,449
We tried calling,
but it was switched off.

411
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:49,886
Hey, bro. He's asking something.

412
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,083
Answer him.

413
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,797
There was no cell reception.
- What?

414
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,824
But where were you?

415
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,392
On the moon, for my honeymoon.

416
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,995
Karan. What's wrong with him?

417
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,530
Karan.

418
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,298
Karan!

419
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,610
Did you guys have a fight?

420
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,373
No.

421
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,392
Karan.

422
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,719
Karan.

423
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,256
Karan. Karan.

424
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,493
What's wrong with you?

425
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,736
You passed by me in the college.

426
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,838
I called you but you didn't stop.

427
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,635
Karan. You haven't
called or messaged me..

428
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,033
..for the past two days.

429
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,374
You disconnect all my calls.

430
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,915
Why are you avoiding me?

431
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,817
What's is your problem?

432
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:22,944
What is your problem..

433
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,079
..why are you
creating a scene here?

434
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,056
Look, I've other things to do..

435
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,452
..other then talking
or messaging you.

436
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,888
I was busy preparing for my finals.

437
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,327
So you're so busy..
- Hey, listen.

438
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,630
I don't need anyone's
interference or advice..

439
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,793
..about what I should
or should not do.

440
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,058
So please.

441
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,466
Repeat.

442
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,303
One more please.

443
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,644
One more.

444
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,519
What's wrong, Karishma?
Will you tell me?

445
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,927
Karan. Please tell
us what is the problem..

446
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,590
..between you and Karishma.

447
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,824
One more.

448
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,768
We broke up.
- What?

449
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,637
What nonsense.
- It's true.

450
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,443
When we've no future,
then what's the point?

451
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,576
I sent her photo home,
mother rejected her.

452
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,345
I've decided,
I will do everything as I please..

453
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,485
..but I will get married
by my mother's choice.

454
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,049
Listen, Karan.

455
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,958
Something's wrong between you two..

456
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,428
..and you're hiding it from us.

457
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,628
Karishma is very tensed
and I'm bringing her here.

458
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,502
I don't want to talk to her,
I am leaving.

459
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,301
Karan. Listen..

460
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,754
I knew it was a matter of time.

461
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,960
You entered my heart,
my soul, my life.

462
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,397
Feel like dancing,
dancing forever.

463
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,958
I am dancing for you.

464
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,277
come on. Just come down quietly.

465
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,339
come on.

466
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,285
Behave yourself.
- Leave me.

467
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,985
come on. Just come down.
- Leave me.

468
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,584
Leave me, I said

469
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,757
I want more tequila.

470
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,919
Karan. Karan.

471
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,728
I want to go back.

472
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,856
Leave me.

473
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,358
Who are you?

474
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,823
Who are you?

475
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,463
Why have you brought me here?

476
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,005
Just listen..
- I'm asking you something.

477
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,076
Why are you staring?

478
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,336
Are you drunk?

479
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,374
Yes. I am drunk.

480
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,540
Now, come on.

481
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,947
Leave me. Let me go.

482
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,678
Do you know what you just did?

483
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,844
And what could've happened?

484
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,482
You weren't in your senses,
nor about your clothes.

485
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,357
They were toying with you.

486
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,694
They could've done things..

487
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,525
Then you wouldn't be sitting here.

488
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,994
Your body would've been
lying under some tower.

489
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,302
That can still happen, Karan.

490
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,340
Because if you separate
me from yourself..

491
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,973
..then I don't have
a reason to live.

492
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,377
Karishma.
- And I'll do it

493
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,778
I'll definitely do it, Mr. Karan.

494
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,717
Without having tequila.

495
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,887
Karishma.
Karishma.

496
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,454
I am sorry.

497
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:09,991
I didn't...want to fall in love.

498
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:16,940
But I had...to fall in love.

499
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:23,514
I didn't...want to fall for you.

500
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:30,049
But I had...to fall for you.

501
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,655
I didn't want to lose my heart.

502
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,891
But I had to.

503
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,326
I didn't want to lose my heart.

504
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,565
But I had to.

505
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:53,441
I didn't...want this sweet pain.

506
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:59,443
But I had to.

507
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:17,862
The flowers didn't have to bloom.

508
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,563
But they did.

509
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,040
We shouldn't have met.

510
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,001
But we did everyday.

511
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:34,545
The eyes liked to...stay
awake at nights.

512
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:41,017
I stayed awake with the night.

513
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:47,122
I didn't...want to fall in love.

514
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,968
But I had...to fall in love.

515
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,821
I didn't want to hear it.

516
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,015
But I heard you.

517
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:21,023
I fell...in the trap of love.

518
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,864
This shouldn't have happened.

519
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,734
But it did happen.

520
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,467
This shouldn't have happened.

521
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,443
But it did happen.

522
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:41,718
I didn't...want to fall in love.

523
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:47,948
But I had...to fall in love.

524
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:54,898
I didn't...want to fall for you.

525
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:01,332
But I had...to fall for you.

526
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,907
I didn't want to lose my heart.

527
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,274
But I had to.

528
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,539
I didn't want to lose my heart.

529
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,850
But I had to.

530
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:12,631
Bye.

531
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,399
Bye.

532
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,479
Bye.

533
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,403
Rajveer, when did you arrive?

534
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,575
And what are you doing outside?

535
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:54,749
come inside.

536
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:55,807
No. It's okay.

537
00:45:58,622 --> 00:45:59,554
What is his name?

538
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,782
Karan.

539
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,050
Do you love him?

540
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:07,486
Yes.

541
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,631
But it just happened.

542
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,893
We met and I don't know how..
- No.

543
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,728
I understand.

544
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,938
It happens.

545
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,033
Actually, this is how it happens.

546
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,740
And there's nothing wrong in it.

547
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,916
And it's not a big deal either.

548
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,820
I mean we were supposed
to get engaged.

549
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,784
It hasn't yet. Nothing's wrong yet.

550
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,859
Go to lndia and tell your
papa that you love Karan..

551
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,527
..and you want to marry him.

552
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,990
I'm sure he will support you.

553
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,325
Every parent cares about
their child's happiness.

554
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,732
Okay, okay. I understand.

555
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,097
It'll be a bit difficult for you.

556
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,729
But don't worry.

557
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,473
I am with you.

558
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,800
I will come there
and set things right.

559
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,043
How?
- Simple.

560
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,283
First I will say I don't
agree to this marriage..

561
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,916
..because I love someone else.

562
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,852
After that,
you can talk about Karan..

563
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,878
..at the right moment. Simple.

564
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,813
Rajveer, it's not so simple.

565
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,320
I'm very scared about daddy.

566
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,455
You can stop being scared.

567
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,923
Because even God supports lovers.

568
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,891
We just have to get to Udaipur..

569
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,458
..and stop our
marriage preparations.

570
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,737
Preparations?
- Yes.

571
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:23,862
Preparations

572
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,908
After meeting you I told my mom..

573
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,738
..that I can't find
a better girl than you.

574
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,602
And everyone got busy.

575
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,014
They've begun preparing
for our engagement.

576
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,278
We should go and stop all this.

577
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,851
Otherwise it will create
a problem for both the families.

578
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,752
So...we've to leave
for Udaipur tomorrow.

579
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,080
Tomorrow?

580
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,918
Yes, tomorrow.

581
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:49,454
Okay.

582
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:51,890
Goodnight.

583
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,667
Goodnight.
- Look after yourself.

584
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,005
Suketu.

585
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,075
How is Shakira now?
- She's fine now.

586
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,778
But what happened to her?

587
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,083
The doctor said she took
an overdose of sleeping pills.

588
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,016
Sleeping pills?
- I don't know why.

589
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,081
come on.

590
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,725
Oh no.

591
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,483
I will handle everything, Karishma.

592
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,559
You don't worry.

593
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,688
I will set things right.

594
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,297
Thank you, Rajveer.

595
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,257
No, thank you.

596
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,500
I am doing this for my happiness.

597
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:38,070
And my happiness lies in yours.

598
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,744
Is anyone here to receive
you or shall I give you a lift.

599
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,034
Sister's here.

600
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,677
Okay. Take care.

601
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,271
Bye.

602
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:07,533
Everyone's so excited
about your marriage.

603
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:08,994
Especially father.

604
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,931
We must have this,
we must have that..

605
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,366
He was saying that your
marriage should so grand..

606
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,604
..which Udaipur never forgets.

607
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,944
He's imported 25
elephants from Mysore.

608
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,907
Where are you lost?

609
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:24,945
What is your problem?

610
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,852
I called you so many times.

611
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,615
Where were you?

612
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,125
I took Shakira to the hospital.

613
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,859
Why weren't you answering my call?

614
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,051
I left my phone at home.

615
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,854
Someone rejected her for marriage..

616
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,330
..and she took sleeping pills.

617
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,833
Is she okay now?
- Yea, she's much better now.

618
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,769
Okay. - But you, Udaipur.
So suddenly.

619
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,567
I'll tell you.

620
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,037
But why so suddenly?
- I said I will tell you later.

621
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,968
Okay. Take care. Bye.

622
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,139
Who was it?

623
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,913
Karan.
My college friend.

624
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,457
Why is father importing
horses from Mysore?

625
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:05,984
You are..

626
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,052
I tell you. You're still crazy.

627
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,420
You haven't changed at all.

628
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,428
Mom's been waiting since morning.

629
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,899
Look, she's standing outside.

630
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,566
Mother.
- My Karishma's here.

631
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,898
My child.
- How are you, mom?

632
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,772
You've grown so weak.

633
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,911
You had puffed
cheeks when you left.

634
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,844
Mother, after I have
'Dal-bati' cooked by you..

635
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,942
..they'll puff up again.

636
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,351
Where is daddy?
- Upstairs. With your aunt.

637
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,389
Shall we?
- Go.

638
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,446
chunilal.
- Yes.

639
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,457
call the caterers
of Pooranmal from Jaipur.

640
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,855
The sweets and snacks shouldn't
lack anything. - Very good.

641
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:43,624
You're looking after the
tent and entertainment, aren't you?

642
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,689
Yes, mother.

643
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,832
Everything should
be grand in the wedding.

644
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,835
Yes, of course.
- One more thing.

645
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,736
Take everyone's advices,
but follow only mine.

646
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:54,901
chunilal.
- Yes, your highness.

647
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,640
Do exactly as
sister-in-law says. - Yes.

648
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,317
Aunt.
- My child.

649
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,943
My child. My doll. You have come.

650
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,716
It hasn't been too
long since you left.

651
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,587
Yet I feel we're meeting
after many years.

652
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,453
Sister-in-law, I'm here too.

653
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:15,326
Father. - My child,
even I am happy about your arrival.

654
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:16,992
She's already grown up.

655
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,934
I've smacked after so long.

656
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,004
And I got a chance...to
bite you after so long.

657
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,034
Stop. Stop.

658
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,603
Karishma, stop.
- Try and catch me. - Stop.

659
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,969
The house feels so lively,
isn't it?

660
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,576
What's wrong with you?

661
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,679
Why are you so upset?

662
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,981
Nothing, sister.-in-law.

663
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,457
Just thinking that soon
this house will be lonely again.

664
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,454
What is this?

665
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,132
Did you buy this for me?
- Yes.

666
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,563
If I wear this cloth..

667
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,898
..then everyone in
Udaipur will laugh at me.

668
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,735
Sister, this dress
will look so nice on you.

669
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,572
And brother-in-law will
be so happy to see you.

670
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:04,909
Karishma.
- He'll be so happy.

671
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,040
Finish your breakfast,
we've to go shopping.

672
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,547
Then we've to attend Shreenathji's
veneration in the evening.

673
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,677
You won't get time in the morning.

674
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,948
They'll be here tomorrow morning
by 1 1 o'clock with the blessings.

675
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,618
Why are they coming tomorrow?

676
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,323
Because the priest has said
tomorrow is an auspicious day.

677
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,669
'Why isn't Rajveer
answering his phone?'

678
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,509
Tikaram.
- Yes, your Highness.

679
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,348
Put only fresh flowers.

680
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,486
If I find a single stale one,
you've had it.

681
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,545
Yes, Your Highness. - come on.

682
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,817
Shanti.

683
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,726
Shanti, where's the platter filled
with goods the priest asked for.

684
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,095
It's kept there. I'll get it.

685
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,301
And Ram Singh.
Spread out the new carpets quickly.

686
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,632
It's getting late.
- Yes, Your highness.

687
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,864
And where is Karishma?

688
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,776
What is Rajveer's problem?

689
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,878
Why isn't he answering the call?

690
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,794
Welcome. Welcome.

691
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,454
Kaushaliya.

692
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,098
Why hasn't Karishma arrived yet?

693
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:39,857
She must be coming.

694
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,899
Karishma is here.
- come.

695
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:47,868
'Where is Rajveer?'

696
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,003
Dear, take their blessings.
- Take their blessings.

697
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,979
Bless you, dear.
- Bless you, dear.

698
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:56,774
Sit.

699
00:55:57,053 --> 00:56:00,284
Does anyone have such
a gorgeous daughter-in-law?

700
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,920
From what Rajveer said..

701
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,861
..I know that these
two have gotten along.

702
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,362
Thank goodness we sent
Rajveer to Europe to meet her.

703
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:15,435
It was important to know
and understand each other.

704
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:16,561
Of course.

705
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,774
'What is Rajveer's problem?'

706
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,509
Where is my son-in-law?

707
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,351
He's on his way.
He'll be here soon.

708
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,785
Sorry, I'm slightly late.

709
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,085
Here he is.

710
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,518
Here is Rajveer.

711
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:39,917
Welcome, Rajveer?

712
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,019
Hello.
- Hello.

713
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,362
Bless you, son.
- Bless you, son.

714
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,897
Sit, son. - I got this 'Jodhpuri'
stitched for your engagement.

715
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,634
But you wore it today.

716
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:54,401
Do you want us to get
you two engaged today?

717
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,944
What's wrong?
Do you want to say something?

718
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:08,846
Yes.

719
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,448
Then, go ahead.

720
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,285
I've to go to canada for
15 days on a business trip.

721
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,799
can we get engaged today?

722
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,760
Aunt.

723
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:24,771
What happened, dear?

724
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,365
I want to talk to Rajveer.

725
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,267
Karishma.

726
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,346
Karishma, what are you doing?

727
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,706
What are you doing?

728
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,840
You told me something else.

729
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,052
And now you've changed colours.

730
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,380
I didn't know,
Rajveer, that you will betray me.

731
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,386
I've been betrayed too.

732
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,822
Our parents had already
fixed our marriage..

733
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,020
..and I went to meet
you only after that.

734
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,963
And you knew that.

735
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,067
You were smiling,
laughing, dancing with me.

736
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:58,832
But in your heart..

737
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:00,971
Someone else dwelled in your heart.

738
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:02,978
But, Rajveer, I told you..
- Enough.

739
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,470
There's no point.

740
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,876
I'm ready to forget
everything and marry you.

741
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,820
Because...I cannot see
me and my family being mocked.

742
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:18,723
And this why I endured
the game you played with me.

743
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,987
But if you make any more mistakes..

744
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,290
..then I won't tolerate it.

745
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,627
Forget Karan.

746
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,523
Sister, I love Karan.

747
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,457
And I told Rajveer about it.

748
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,836
And he promised me,
that he'll refuse to this alliance.

749
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,764
Don't worry.

750
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,736
So tell me, who is Karan?

751
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:18,636
Karan chaudhary.

752
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,209
He was studying Hotel
Management in the college.

753
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,177
He's from Udaipur.

754
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:26,477
Karan chaudhary?

755
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,546
Udaipur?

756
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:30,752
Hotel Management?

757
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,722
Is he Mangal chaudhary's son?

758
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,656
Mangal chaudhary?

759
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,789
Yes.

760
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,661
What have you done, Karishma?

761
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,874
Who did you bump into?

762
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,480
How can you forget
Mangal chaudhary?

763
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,916
We've been raised by
hearing tales of their enmity.

764
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,619
We can never forget..

765
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,049
..what the chaudhary
family has snatched from us.

766
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,049
The chaudhary family..

767
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,187
..is responsible
for aunt's sorrows.

768
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:09,754
Yes, Karishma.

769
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,725
Mangal chaudhary's
brother Angad chaudhary..

770
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,834
..is responsible
for our uncle's death.

771
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,175
Years ago,
both families took part..

772
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,145
..in the veneration
at Kalka temple.

773
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,546
They had an argument..

774
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,149
..regarding the
veneration and oblation.

775
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:02,117
'This time we'll perform
the veneration first.'

776
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,610
'Angad chaudhary..

777
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,557
..for ages Rathore family
has been performing..

778
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,614
..the first veneration
on 'Navratri.'

779
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,957
'And today as well.'

780
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:14,826
'No, Rathore. Not anymore.'

781
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,164
'The chaudhary family
will do it now.'

782
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,607
'Leave my hand, Angad.'

783
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,111
'Otherwise..
- Otherwise what?'

784
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,613
'Don't mess with your elders.'

785
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,448
'The consequences can be grave.'

786
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,216
'Narhottam Rathore.'

787
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,623
You might not have heard
about Karan chaudhary before.

788
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,489
You wouldn't have
recognised him either.

789
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,156
That is possible.

790
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,434
But how can you forget
Mangal chaudhary's name?

791
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,729
Listen.

792
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:33,970
Listen to me carefully.

793
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,646
You'll never mention
this to anyone.

794
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:42,046
If anyone hears this name..

795
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,017
..then it will be terrible.

796
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,017
You love him, don't you?

797
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,021
Then for the sake of his life..

798
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:55,855
..you will have to forget him.

799
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,660
I miss you.

800
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,731
I want to have you near me.

801
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:19,566
close to me, baby.

802
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,871
Holding me.

803
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,806
I am alone..

804
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,111
..and I'm longing for your love.

805
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,547
Hear my voice, baby.

806
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:36,750
I want to feel you.

807
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,952
Yeah, I want to feel you.

808
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,856
can you hear me now?

809
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,158
can you hear me?

810
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,932
I want to be in your arms.

811
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,696
I need you.

812
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,505
I am so alone.

813
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,803
I am all alone.

814
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:06,182
Without you...nothing seems fine.

815
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:12,854
I spend my days,
counting every moment.

816
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:20,001
Nothing seems right without you.

817
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,797
come back to me.

818
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,931
You're my movinetioninspiration,
fascination.

819
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,870
come back to me.

820
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,934
You're my movinetioninspiration,
fascination.

821
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:31,878
come back to me.

822
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,777
come back to me.

823
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,070
The dawn of morning.

824
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,480
The onset of night.

825
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:12,487
Without, days are so boring.

826
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,850
The glowing of the moon.

827
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,396
The glittering of the stars.

828
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,961
Without you,
they don't shine anymore.

829
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:34,665
My morning starts with you.

830
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:41,879
You're my moon,
my slumber, my peace.

831
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,712
come back to me.

832
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,812
You're my movinetioninspiration,
fascination.

833
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:48,818
come back to me.

834
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,951
You're my movinetioninspiration,
fascination.

835
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:53,793
come back to me.

836
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,525
come back to me.

837
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:19,420
I don't know how..

838
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:27,888
..I lived...before I met you?

839
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:36,461
No desires, no serenity.

840
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:41,400
Nor does my existence
mean a thing.

841
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:49,812
You made my heart beat again.

842
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:56,853
It craved for your love.

843
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,787
come back to me.

844
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,853
You're my movinetioninspiration,
fascination.

845
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,790
come back to me.

846
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,926
You're my movinetioninspiration,
fascination.

847
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,562
come back to me.

848
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:23,911
There's no point
in troubling yourself.

849
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,585
You should go to Udaipur.

850
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,753
Yes, judging by the
situation she's facing..

851
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,954
..I think she'll need your help.

852
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,887
Again I had to perform the
veneration without the incense sticks.

853
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,746
I think Babu Singh
has lost his mind.

854
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:03,955
Anyway, where is your papa?

855
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,127
He already left. Some people
were going to visit the hotel.

856
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,094
I've been saying since last night..

857
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,790
..that I need to discuss
something urgent.

858
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,123
He said We'll
talk in the morning.

859
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,194
And now he's left. I wonder
what he gets by fooling me?

860
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,459
I'll leave, mother.

861
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,799
Yes, of course.
You are all big shots.

862
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,032
Vikrant, listen..

863
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:22,868
Remember what l..
- Mother.

864
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,809
I've to give Karan's
horoscope to the priest..

865
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,643
..as ask him to come
meet you tomorrow.

866
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,138
I remember.

867
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,444
Let's go.

868
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,519
I wonder what lies
in Karan's destiny.

869
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,492
He's always been out of
the house since his childhood.

870
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,887
This time when he returns,
I won't let go.

871
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,631
I'll tie him down.

872
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,564
This time I will
surely get him married.

873
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:52,838
I know what's best in
these matters. - Of course.

874
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,907
And this time
I won't listen to him.

875
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,873
Don't let him say a word.
- Yes.

876
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,003
Karan.

877
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,910
How are you, mom?
- How are you?

878
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,812
When did you return? - I've
been following you for so long.

879
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:09,720
Someday you'll kill me.

880
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,050
Karan.
- Sister-in-law, how are you?

881
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,220
You're looking so good.
Good to see you

882
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,158
come on. You're looking so good.

883
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,527
We missed you so much.
- Thanks.

884
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,201
It's good to have you again,
right mama.

885
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,800
Absolutely. So handsome.

886
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,108
Babu Singh,
call Karan for breakfast.

887
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,612
He already left.

888
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:32,703
Left?

889
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:34,842
Without eating anything.

890
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,056
Stop the car.
- Yes.

891
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,597
Oh no, brother's car.

892
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,724
Karan.

893
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,059
Brother, you?

894
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,902
When did you arrive?
- This morning.

895
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,441
How are you?
- Fine.

896
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:34,801
You should've informed me.

897
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,706
I would've received you
at the airport.. - Brother, l..

898
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,247
Wait. Krishna, you take this car.

899
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,546
come. You come with me.
- Yes, brother.

900
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:43,742
Thank God you came back.

901
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,443
So, how is everything?

902
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:46,645
How are your studies?

903
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,217
Very nice.

904
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,458
Karan, tell me something.

905
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,493
I came here to see
our advocate Baldev.

906
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,597
But what are you
doing in Dholipura?

907
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:59,198
Me? Brother, l..

908
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,896
I was coming to the office
to see you and father.

909
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,666
Then you should've taken
a left from Hanuman chowk.

910
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,732
How would you have reached
the office on this route?

911
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,569
Yes, yes.

912
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,200
I was slightly confused, brother.

913
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,874
Udaipur's changed, right brother.

914
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:14,513
Which route's leading where.

915
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,617
Karan, always remember one thing.

916
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:20,750
This area belongs to Rathore.

917
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,989
Next time you come here,
bring along a few men.

918
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,421
Understand.
- Yes, brother.

919
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:29,553
come on.

920
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:41,439
Brother, our hotel's completely
changed after the renovation.

921
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,475
You're returning to
Udaipur after so long..

922
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,638
..that's why everything
looks different. - Yes.

923
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,647
You're seeing it after many years,
right? - Yes, brother.

924
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,909
come, Karan.

925
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:56,847
come with me.

926
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,615
We've made a few business plans.

927
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,091
Take a look at them
and give your suggestion.

928
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,653
Brother, I just arrived today.
We can see them tomorrow.

929
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,828
Let me see the hotel today.
- Fine.

930
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,762
Good morning, sir.
- come.

931
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,707
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

932
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,531
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

933
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,804
Karan.
- Hey, dad.

934
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,406
My son. My Dear.

935
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,446
So suddenly? Is everything alright?

936
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,183
I was missing everyone.

937
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,512
I thought of surprising everyone.

938
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,713
Great.

939
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,050
Good to see you.

940
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:33,917
Did you meet your friend?

941
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,653
Isn't he out for training?
- Training.

942
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,796
Raghu. come. come.

943
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:41,765
Tell him about your son
Amitosh's escapades. Tell him.

944
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,971
With great difficulty
I managed to get him a job..

945
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,438
..in a airplane's ground staff.

946
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,100
But he ran away after
15 days of training.

947
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,007
I see. Amitosh is right here.

948
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:51,601
Where is he?

949
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,454
These are Shakeela's bangles.

950
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,115
I've adorn everyone
with them today.

951
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,495
Looking good.
- There you go.

952
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:09,587
I didn't...want to fall in love.

953
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:16,088
But I had...to fall in love.

954
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:21,993
I didn't...want to fall for you.

955
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,126
I'll be right back.

956
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:28,972
But I had...to fall for you.

957
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,404
Oh, God.
- Where are you going?

958
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,547
Leave him.
- catch him.

959
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:38,777
What are you doing?

960
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:42,015
Leave him. What are you doing?

961
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:44,992
Leave him. Leave him.

962
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:49,124
He's a poor man, makes
his living by selling bangles.

963
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,453
Leave him.

964
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,697
Karishma.

965
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:57,927
Karishma.

966
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:02,072
Karishma. I am indebted to you..

967
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,774
..for saving me from them.

968
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,472
Karishma. - I will have
to do something for you.

969
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,640
Hurry up, we've to get
to Hathipur for shopping.

970
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:10,008
Get to Hathipur..

971
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:11,883
..I'll have your gift sent there.

972
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,487
Karishma.
- Move.

973
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:14,919
come on, dear. We're getting late.

974
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,650
come on, dear. come on.

975
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:17,814
come on.

976
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,183
come on.

977
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,639
Nothing's wrong with you?
Don't act.

978
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,030
I'm done for.

979
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,799
This is nice.

980
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,145
Since you came in my life, Karan..

981
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:40,779
..Amitosh Ojha's
been having a bad time.

982
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:41,940
Life's become difficult.

983
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:46,644
Either it's you or someone else
getting beaten up because of you.

984
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,412
I will endure it.
- Amitosh.

985
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,548
No, let it be.
- Amitosh.

986
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,990
I'm hurt.
- Amitosh.

987
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,129
You were going to tell
me something important.

988
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:57,931
Important? What was it?

989
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,557
Let me show you.

990
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,098
Karan. Karan.
- What? What?

991
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,572
Karishma's going to Hathipur
with her mother for shopping.

992
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,534
You can meet her there if you want.

993
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:08,631
Okay, thanks.

994
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:12,969
Water!

995
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,925
Hey, Karan I hope you aren't busy.

996
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,617

you to few people.

997
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,595
Learn the tricks and
trades of business. - Dad..

998
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,756
I know, you've been learning
management techniques..

999
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,456
..in that English school.

1000
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,161
But you know, the truth us..

1001
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,026
..you learn business
skills only when..

1002
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,664

1003
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,432
Yes, dad.
- Right.

1004
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:41,765
Sit. Sit down. Sit down.

1005
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,440
That must be Singh sir.

1006
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:47,646
Yes, Singh sir.
- Dad.

1007
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:48,910
Just a minute.

1008
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,076
I have a plan with my friends.

1009
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,718
Karan, why didn't you tell me?
Go, go, enjoy yourself.

1010
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,779
Okay, thanks.

1011
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:56,846
Yes, Mr. Singh.

1012
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,515
I'm just reaching Hathipur.
- Hathipur!

1013
01:19:58,593 --> 01:19:59,890
Yes, of course. Yes.

1014
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:02,085
What happened?

1015
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:05,156
Actually, even I was heading to
Hathipur with my friends.

1016
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,425
So I'll go with you.

1017
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,960
Why didn't you tell me, Karan?

1018
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,598
And you've returned after so long.

1019
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:15,233
It's a good thing.
We'll have each other's company.

1020
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,100
Yes, dad.

1021
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:01,645
I'll call when the meeting
gets over. We'll go back together.

1022
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,121
Enjoy yourself. Bye.
- Yes, dad.

1023
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,866
The separation..

1024
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:32,679
The separation's
making me wander.

1025
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:38,624
It's making me wander around.

1026
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:44,023
It's making me wander around.

1027
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:52,930
Searching for you..

1028
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:03,578
Searching for you..

1029
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:10,154
Searching for you..

1030
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,853
My eyes have grown tired.

1031
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,858
My eyes have grown tired.

1032
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:22,694
My eyes have grown tired.

1033
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,930
My eyes have grown tired.

1034
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,969
My eyes have grown tired.

1035
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:35,078
My eyes have grown tired.

1036
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:06,143
The moments that made us smile.

1037
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:12,215
Have separated.

1038
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,484
Have separated.

1039
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:31,938
You're apart from me,
and I from you.

1040
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:41,075
The bonds between us have broken.

1041
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,477
You're standing
on the other side.

1042
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,529
You're standing
on the other side.

1043
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,428
And I am standing on this side.

1044
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,398
You're standing
on the other side.

1045
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:06,436
And I am standing on this side.

1046
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,037
My eyes have grown tired.

1047
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:13,973
My eyes have grown tired.

1048
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:14,879
Yes, dad.

1049
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:20,751
My eyes have grown tired.

1050
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,049
Zorawar, take the car back.

1051
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:54,752
I said take the car back.

1052
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,603
Look, we've arrived
at Karishma's house.

1053
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,171
come.
- Yes, aunt.

1054
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,548
Hello, aunt.
- Hello.

1055
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:24,080
Feekaram. You've become so skinny.

1056
01:25:24,519 --> 01:25:25,679
What's wrong?

1057
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,013
Did your wife leave you?

1058
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,817
What to do, aunt, she doesn't go.

1059
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:32,757
He's just..

1060
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:33,816
Very funny.

1061
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,992
Brother. Sister-in-law.

1062
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,030
Where are brother and sister-in-law

1063
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:42,467
Where is everyone?
- Aunt.

1064
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:43,693
Karishma.

1065
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:46,969
Enough. No need
to be so affectionate.

1066
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,633
You said you'll come
back in seven days..

1067
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,610
..and now you're preparing
for your marriage.

1068
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:53,607
Tell me who that is.

1069
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:56,949
Shakira.
- Yes.

1070
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,649
Oh my, God! Look at you.

1071
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,081
You've become so slim.
- And sexy.

1072
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:05,653
And you know what,
now I reject boys.

1073
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:10,125
You did the right
thing by coming here.

1074
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:11,992
Did you come alone?

1075
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:15,695
What are you saying?

1076
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,128
You didn't even
talk to Karishma yet.

1077
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:22,101
Dude, your story is more
complicated than a filmy love-story.

1078
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,672
Your story is too complicated.

1079
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,012
I mean such enmity in this age.

1080
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:34,080
I don't believe it.

1081
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,114
Yes, Shakira.

1082
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,651
Yeah, I am here.
Everything's okay.

1083
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:42,654
Is everything fine there?

1084
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:45,529
I would tell you if I understand.

1085
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,989
One second.

1086
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,092
Here, talk to Suketu.

1087
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:53,097
Suketu. I am very angry with you?

1088
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,234
Why didn't you come here?

1089
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:04,440
Karishma.

1090
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:07,543
Karan.

1091
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:10,413
Karan.

1092
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,719
Karan, I wanted to meet you.

1093
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:14,621
Talk to you.

1094
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:16,855
But my family..

1095
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,624
Karan, what is happening?

1096
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,798
Are you doing something?

1097
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:25,461
Karishma.

1098
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,730
Don't cry.

1099
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:29,870
I said don't cry.

1100
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:31,736
I am here now.

1101
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,605
Everything will be fine now.

1102
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,174
I will set things right now.

1103
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,039
Believe me.

1104
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,152
Put some more chairs here..
- Believe me.

1105
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:40,676
Shakira.

1106
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:41,744
Shakira, look.

1107
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:43,952
That's Jagdish temple.

1108
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:45,992
The people here have
immense faith in it.

1109
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:47,483
Oh, that one.

1110
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:48,818
I see.

1111
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,065
I cannot see anything
from this distance.

1112
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,964
Let's go there for a picnic.

1113
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,570
We'll have loads of fun.

1114
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,906
You, me, Suketu, Karan.

1115
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:03,568
But how?

1116
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:05,839
Don't you worry?

1117
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,642
I am there.
I will certainly find a way.

1118
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:24,053
Look.

1119
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:26,391
Yes, aunt.
- come on.

1120
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:29,198
come on, aunt. Quickly.
- Suketu, hold this.

1121
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,459
Give it.

1122
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,032
Suketu, the view from
there is very nice. - I see.

1123
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,541
Let's go there.
- come on.

1124
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:39,406
I'm tired. - Oh no.
I cannot climb that high.

1125
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,475
You won't be able to do it either,
right aunt. - Yes.

1126
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,944
Why did you choose such
a difficult spot for picnic?

1127
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,888
Oh, God. I'm out of breath.

1128
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,182
correct, aunt. correct.

1129
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,955
So, Suketu, Karishma.
You two go up..

1130
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,858
..and I'll have some
fun with aunt down here.

1131
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,725
Okay.
- Yes. - come on, aunt.

1132
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:57,920
Aunt.

1133
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:59,031
Let's go.

1134
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:00,760
come on, let's go up quickly.
- It's too high.

1135
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,132
Shakira acted so well.

1136
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:04,060
I'm tired.

1137
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:55,049
I didn't...want to fall in love.

1138
01:29:55,957 --> 01:30:01,759
But I had...to fall in love.

1139
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:08,229
I didn't...want to fall for you.

1140
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:14,871
But I had...to fall for you.

1141
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:18,143
I didn't want to lose my heart.

1142
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:21,777
But I had to.

1143
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,980
I didn't want to lose my heart.

1144
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:29,122
But I had to.

1145
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:37,894
I didn't...want this sweet pain.

1146
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:44,102
But I had to.

1147
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,175
Everything will be fine.

1148
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:51,634
Don't worry.

1149
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:57,515
It's been so long,
why haven't they returned?

1150
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,549
I suggest we go to them.
- Aunt.

1151
01:31:00,655 --> 01:31:01,644
Where are you going?

1152
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,850
I'll call them.
- Yes, good idea.

1153
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:09,789
Aunt's calling.
- Yes.

1154
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,799
Karan, aunt's getting anxious.

1155
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,159
come on.

1156
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:19,165
It's late.
- Karishma was bored.

1157
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,172
Aunt.
- Yes.

1158
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:22,038
You had a good time, didn't you?
- Yes.

1159
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,576
I had great time.

1160
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:24,834
come on.

1161
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:53,538
This was your last
meeting with her.

1162
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,903
If this happens again..

1163
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,207
..then you can't imagine
what I'll do with you.

1164
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,645
If you ever come between us..

1165
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,114
Between who? Between who?

1166
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:36,472
Karan chaudhary.

1167
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:38,674
You don't know who I am.

1168
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,714
And what I can do.

1169
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,546
Hello.

1170
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:44,813
Mangal chaudhary.

1171
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,818
My name is..

1172
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:56,998
How dare you?

1173
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,534
Karan, how could you think that..

1174
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:05,575
..a girl from Rathore family
can be our daughter-in-law.

1175
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:07,407
Dad, l..
- Enough.

1176
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:08,974
Don't say a word, Karan.

1177
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:13,084
Anything you say will
be meaningless for me.

1178
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,023
We don't share any
bond with that Rathore.

1179
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:18,081
Only thing common
between us is death.

1180
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,485
The only thing we
understand is guns.

1181
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,797
There's no possibility
for anything else.

1182
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:33,139
And that goes for everyone.

1183
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:46,809
Rathore uncle.

1184
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:48,751
You're highly respected in Marwar.

1185
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:51,147
You've a name and status too.

1186
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:52,648
I admit.

1187
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:56,687
But we've some respect
in Mewar as well.

1188
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,061
And the alliance between us..

1189
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:06,468
The people of Marwar
and Mewar know about it.

1190
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:11,640
And if your daughter
and our daughter-in-law..

1191
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:14,711
..creates a scene
out on the streets..

1192
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:16,845
..then it can't go unnoticed.

1193
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:26,220
Are you in your senses?

1194
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:29,518
Here.

1195
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:31,522
Your daughter at Kumbalgarh,
yesterday.

1196
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:52,574
Karan.

1197
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:56,250
Mangal chaudhary's son.

1198
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:04,197
And this has been going
on since cracko University.

1199
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:08,957
Rathore uncle.

1200
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,969
It's best that you
handle this situation.

1201
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:15,802
Because if I resort
to handling it my way..

1202
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,435
..then it can create a scene.

1203
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:39,527
Listen!

1204
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,160
Kaushaliya! Leave me!

1205
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:44,901
Listen to me!
- Leave me!

1206
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:46,901
I beg you!

1207
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:49,943
Today I will kill
her with my own hands.

1208
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:51,433
Kaushaliya.

1209
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:52,935
Sister-in-law.

1210
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:54,648
Sister-in-law.

1211
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:55,704
Purshottam.

1212
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:18,060
Karishma.

1213
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,635
My child.

1214
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:02,504
Karan.

1215
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,583
You will manage King
Palace Hotel from tomorrow.

1216
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:22,031
You're already quite educated..

1217
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,833
..for what you've to handle here.

1218
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:29,634
Now you will stay before my eyes.

1219
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:31,872
I haven't finished
my education yet.

1220
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,578
I am going back.
- But, Karan..

1221
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:46,050
Fine. If you want to go back,
then you can.

1222
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:49,722
But then look for a future there.

1223
01:37:51,465 --> 01:37:53,695
Because you won't
have anything here.

1224
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:17,379
Sister-in-law.

1225
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:19,481
Bless me.

1226
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,123
Today is a big day.
- What is it, Purshottam?

1227
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:28,400
For years, Mangal chaudhary..

1228
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:32,103
..stayed ahead of us
because of King Palace Hotel.

1229
01:38:32,673 --> 01:38:36,541
But today...after the Mann
Singh Hotel Palace tender..

1230
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:41,605
..we'll reach new heights
in the hotel industry.

1231
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:46,712
Bless me, sister-in-law.

1232
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:58,191
If things get complicated,
please handle Vikrant.

1233
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,358
So? You want me to
bow down before them?

1234
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:27,494
When I've to join the business,
then why wait for tomorrow?

1235
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:21,174
Lock Mangal chaudhary
for 500 crores.

1236
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:28,510
500 crores.

1237
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:52,901
Get lost.

1238
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,847
Look, they've bribed
the contractors here.

1239
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:57,706
Look.

1240
01:40:58,052 --> 01:41:01,021
They want to achieve
the tender through fraud..

1241
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,645
..and bribing people.

1242
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:04,880
Vikrant.

1243
01:41:07,494 --> 01:41:08,483
Vikrant.

1244
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:24,633
Brother..

1245
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,659
No, brother!

1246
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:12,625
What's wrong with you people?

1247
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,890
You start shooting
for every little thing.

1248
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,028
Sometimes it's for the
veneration at the temple..

1249
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:18,796
..or for a insignificant tender.

1250
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:26,196
I want to know...is it necessary
to shed blood for everything?

1251
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:33,011
can any business,
or anything greater than life?

1252
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:41,143
I feel pity on your thinking.

1253
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:46,049
And people like you still
exist make me want to laugh.

1254
01:42:57,838 --> 01:42:59,135
Actually,
I don't feel pity for you either.

1255
01:43:27,067 --> 01:43:28,932
Uncle. Uncle, what happened?
- What happened, your highness?

1256
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:30,058
Uncle, what happened?

1257
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:34,039
I am not talking
about Karishma, daddy.

1258
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:36,968
Nor about my love story.

1259
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:40,104
All I am saying is that..

1260
01:43:40,647 --> 01:43:44,105
..what're we getting
out of whatever's happening.

1261
01:43:45,519 --> 01:43:47,646
We just keep looking
for opportunities..

1262
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:51,156
..and ways to hurt each other.

1263
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:57,485
Why?

1264
01:43:57,798 --> 01:44:01,097
Why can't we end this?
- It won't end, Karan.

1265
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:05,401
This hatred has reach roote.

1266
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:12,605
You don't know the
wound...that's in my heart.

1267
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:15,948
Angad, my younger brother.

1268
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:20,820
I raised him.

1269
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:23,517
One day he was taller than me.

1270
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:27,017
I felt proud when
he walked besides me.

1271
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:34,065
One day he stepped
out of the house..

1272
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:38,495
..and didn't return.

1273
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:44,900
I know very well...that
Rathore had him killed.

1274
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:48,937
And still...

1275
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:55,248
But how can I believe
that he isn't alive?

1276
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:59,626
I would've believed only
if I had cremated his dead body.

1277
01:45:00,994 --> 01:45:02,791
But we didn't find
Angad's body either.

1278
01:45:08,735 --> 01:45:10,703
Although I know you are dead..

1279
01:45:12,172 --> 01:45:14,003
..I can't put a
garland on your photo.

1280
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:20,073
And get one thing
straight all of you.

1281
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:24,540
Everyone will have to
follow my point of view..

1282
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:26,085
..regarding the Rathore family.

1283
01:45:26,853 --> 01:45:28,650
Everyone is, just like you want it.

1284
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:32,420
No one has the courage
to speak up to you.

1285
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:37,620
We can understand your sorrow
of the loss of your brother.

1286
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:42,000
But...what did he take with him,
and what did he leave behind?

1287
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:45,204
By killing Narhottam Rathore..

1288
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,702
..he proved that he's a Rajput.

1289
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,437
But the consequence.

1290
01:45:51,745 --> 01:45:55,545
Did you think about
that woman in that family?

1291
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:57,909
She lost her husband?

1292
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:02,053
And when he was shooting
at Narhottam Rathore..

1293
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:08,089
..he didn't think about that woman,
or about his wife.

1294
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:12,556
She was my sister.

1295
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,065
My own sister, Urmilla.

1296
01:46:18,105 --> 01:46:22,201
And when I saw her severed
body on the railway tracks..

1297
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:27,209
..I thought Why? Why did I get
her married to Angad chaudhary..

1298
01:46:27,447 --> 01:46:28,436
Why?

1299
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:31,881
I beg you.

1300
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,779
He is dead.

1301
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:38,480
He isn't coming back.

1302
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:42,650
But..

1303
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:49,902
But, we can still save
the one that's left.. - Mother!

1304
01:46:50,003 --> 01:46:51,561
Mamta.
- What happened, mother?

1305
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:52,894
Mamta.

1306
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,097
Get her water.

1307
01:46:58,145 --> 01:46:59,737
Give that to me.
- come.

1308
01:47:07,387 --> 01:47:09,082
Forgive me, father.

1309
01:47:11,124 --> 01:47:12,682
Get well soon.

1310
01:47:14,628 --> 01:47:16,653
I will do as you say.

1311
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:22,025
I will never do anything
again to hurt you.

1312
01:47:24,504 --> 01:47:25,493
child.

1313
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,729
Don't cry.

1314
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:03,832
Karishma.

1315
01:48:04,845 --> 01:48:05,834
Karishma.

1316
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:08,570
Karishma.

1317
01:48:09,182 --> 01:48:10,171
Guess what?

1318
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:13,551
Now you'll be marrying Karan.

1319
01:48:16,723 --> 01:48:18,588
The alliance of Tikamgirh
has been called off.

1320
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:21,018
Now they're preparing
to send a proposal to Karan.

1321
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:23,185
Father has changed everything.

1322
01:48:37,811 --> 01:48:38,800
Sister-in-law.

1323
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:01,122
Purshottam.

1324
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:03,358
I..

1325
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:07,764
I made a mistake, sister-in-law.

1326
01:49:10,677 --> 01:49:12,406
It has happened for the first time.

1327
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:17,779
But this isn't my decision..

1328
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,045
..it's just a thought.

1329
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:24,116
And not just a thought..

1330
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:28,919
call it a helplessness of a father.

1331
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,795
You're going to Mangal chaudhary..

1332
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:35,893
..with Karishma's proposal.

1333
01:49:37,637 --> 01:49:39,935
Karishma loves his
younger son Karan.

1334
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:43,072
That's all you know.

1335
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:48,708
But I know she loves her a lot.

1336
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:53,883
And my happiness lies in hers.

1337
01:50:18,578 --> 01:50:19,567
Aunty.

1338
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:29,018
No, dear.

1339
01:50:29,489 --> 01:50:31,514
That isn't your place, this is.

1340
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:33,648
Aunty.

1341
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,661
I am sorry.
- Okay.

1342
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,497
Your father made me emotional.

1343
01:50:42,135 --> 01:50:43,534
Will you make me cry?

1344
01:51:35,588 --> 01:51:37,078
I want to make you my relative.

1345
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:41,218
I've brought my daughter's
marriage proposal for your son.

1346
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:29,835
Karan and Karishma..

1347
01:52:35,048 --> 01:52:42,716
They're here to eradicate
hatred between us.

1348
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:49,656
Their birth on the same day..

1349
01:52:50,864 --> 01:52:53,628
..mean's an good
indication from the Lord.

1350
01:52:58,638 --> 01:52:59,627
Mangal..

1351
01:53:02,075 --> 01:53:05,806
..forsake this hatred.

1352
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:09,036
And..

1353
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:20,991
..Iet's begin this sweet relation.

1354
01:53:53,226 --> 01:53:55,922
Purshottam Rathore
has made a joke out of us.

1355
01:53:57,597 --> 01:53:58,655
I can't believe..

1356
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:01,728
..that a Rajput can stoop so low.

1357
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:05,660
Go.

1358
01:54:05,805 --> 01:54:07,932
Give these bangles
to Purshottam Rathore.

1359
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:12,507
And ask him to perform his
daughter's rituals wearing these.

1360
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:42,505
My veil..

1361
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:46,037
My veil..

1362
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:50,080
Soars away,
because my love's here.

1363
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:53,781
My veil..

1364
01:54:57,991 --> 01:54:59,583
Your smile..

1365
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:03,491
Your style.

1366
01:55:05,498 --> 01:55:06,965
Your smile..

1367
01:55:07,433 --> 01:55:08,923
Your style.

1368
01:55:09,135 --> 01:55:10,796
Your smile..

1369
01:55:11,037 --> 01:55:12,732
Your style.

1370
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:15,431
Has brought us together.

1371
01:55:16,709 --> 01:55:17,767
Today is the day..

1372
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:19,670
Today is the day..

1373
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:23,938
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1374
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:31,516
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1375
01:55:31,658 --> 01:55:35,116
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1376
01:55:35,428 --> 01:55:36,952
My bangles..

1377
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:42,627
My bangles clinkers
at my beloved's threshold.

1378
01:55:42,835 --> 01:55:44,530
My bangles..

1379
01:55:44,604 --> 01:55:46,128
My bangles..

1380
01:56:05,024 --> 01:56:06,855
The band's playing.

1381
01:56:06,926 --> 01:56:08,791
Everyone's doing the Bhangda.

1382
01:56:08,861 --> 01:56:11,421
The guests are going
crazy in this wedding.

1383
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:14,063
So shake your body.

1384
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:15,964
Let's have a few pegs.

1385
01:56:16,035 --> 01:56:19,471
Don't worry about a thing.

1386
01:56:20,073 --> 01:56:21,165
Oh my.

1387
01:56:21,507 --> 01:56:22,997
The heart goes Oh my.

1388
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:26,542
The heart's restless...to
get married.

1389
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,680
Your eyes.

1390
01:56:29,749 --> 01:56:31,216
Your luck.

1391
01:56:31,584 --> 01:56:33,108
Your eyes.

1392
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:35,010
Your luck.

1393
01:56:35,421 --> 01:56:37,981
Has brought us together.

1394
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,516
Today is the day..

1395
01:56:40,893 --> 01:56:42,190
Today is the day..

1396
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:46,526
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1397
01:56:50,236 --> 01:56:53,797
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1398
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:57,635
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1399
01:56:57,844 --> 01:57:01,439
Today is the day of
the big fat lndian wedding.

1400
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:32,033
Zorawar!

1401
01:57:37,183 --> 01:57:38,616
I cannot see this.

1402
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:42,817
His brother shot
my father on the head..

1403
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:48,589
..I cannot see him being
respected in this house.

1404
01:57:55,168 --> 01:57:56,499
I am your mother.

1405
01:57:57,637 --> 01:57:59,468
He was your father.

1406
01:58:00,006 --> 01:58:01,564
But he was first my husband.

1407
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:03,667
And whatever's
happening here today..

1408
01:58:04,444 --> 01:58:06,036
..is with my consent.

1409
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:07,868
Get out of here!

1410
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:14,643
No! I won't go anywhere!

1411
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:17,922
Now I want to sit here now..

1412
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:19,685
..and enjoy this game completely.

1413
01:58:23,396 --> 01:58:24,761
Dad. Dad.

1414
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:25,920
I am fine.

1415
01:58:26,532 --> 01:58:27,521
I am fine.

1416
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:28,756
Dad.

1417
01:58:29,202 --> 01:58:32,831
Brother. Stop.
-Son, stop.

1418
01:58:33,072 --> 01:58:35,734
Don't create a scene.
Vikrant. Stop it.

1419
01:58:36,542 --> 01:58:37,566
Vikrant.

1420
01:58:38,578 --> 01:58:39,545
Vikrant. Stop it.

1421
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:41,580
Vikrant. Stop it.

1422
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:46,518
Brother. Listen to me.

1423
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:47,875
Brother.

1424
01:58:49,222 --> 01:58:50,189
Brother, stop.

1425
01:58:50,423 --> 01:58:52,152
Brother.
- Vikrant.

1426
01:58:52,892 --> 01:58:54,189
Vikrant, stop it.

1427
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:56,121
Vikrant, stop it.

1428
01:58:58,197 --> 01:59:00,131
No.
- Sister-in-law! - Mother!

1429
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,830
Mother.
- Move!

1430
01:59:06,038 --> 01:59:07,027
Mother, are you fine?

1431
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,529
Sister-in-law.

1432
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:18,973
Mangal.

1433
01:59:20,753 --> 01:59:23,779
Get out of here with
your sons as soon as possible.

1434
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:26,989
Otherwise,
my sister-in-law's blood..

1435
01:59:28,127 --> 01:59:29,594
..can make me do anything.

1436
01:59:40,673 --> 01:59:41,662
Karan.

1437
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:45,638
Vikrant, let's go.
- come.

1438
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:47,902
Mother.

1439
01:59:48,548 --> 01:59:49,537
Mother.

1440
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:35,991
There's the airport.

1441
02:00:36,696 --> 02:00:38,095
Go on all of you.

1442
02:00:38,264 --> 02:00:39,458
I'll park the car.

1443
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,874
Thanks, guys. For all your support.

1444
02:00:56,048 --> 02:00:57,174
What now, Karan?

1445
02:00:57,516 --> 02:00:58,540
Two things.

1446
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:02,487
Either I'll marry Karishma,
or I won't.

1447
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:04,678
We'll see.

1448
02:01:05,992 --> 02:01:08,756
Do you want to go or not?
It's time for your flight.

1449
02:01:11,864 --> 02:01:12,956
Thanks, guys.

1450
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,964
Take care.
- Bye. - Bye.

1451
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:16,092
Bye.
- Bye.

1452
02:01:18,738 --> 02:01:20,501
Karan. I suggest that..

1453
02:01:20,573 --> 02:01:22,803
..you should've married
Karishma and then come here.

1454
02:01:23,509 --> 02:01:24,806
Things would've gotten
worse or better.

1455
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,434
Then whatever had to happen,
would've happened.

1456
02:01:26,545 --> 02:01:27,705
Anyways, I'll get the car.

1457
02:01:29,215 --> 02:01:30,648
Hello, Karan.
- Yes, brother.

1458
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:32,074
Where are you?

1459
02:01:32,184 --> 02:01:34,744
I just dropped my friends
at the airport and coming back.

1460
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:39,684
Why did you go
to the airport alone?

1461
02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:43,121
Brother,
I didn't think it was necessary..

1462
02:01:43,195 --> 02:01:44,628
..so I didn't bring anyone along.

1463
02:01:44,797 --> 02:01:46,059
Karan, I told you
no matter where you go..

1464
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:48,666
..there should be a
security guard with you.

1465
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:49,990
Brother, l..

1466
02:01:55,841 --> 02:01:56,830
Karan.

1467
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:01,001
Karan!

1468
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:07,543
Oh, come on, Karan. come on.

1469
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:09,648
For god sake Karan. For god sake.

1470
02:02:10,122 --> 02:02:12,750
You must know whether
it was an accident..

1471
02:02:12,858 --> 02:02:14,723
..or someone tried to kill you?

1472
02:02:15,061 --> 02:02:16,050
Karan.

1473
02:02:16,896 --> 02:02:18,158
It's important for us to know.

1474
02:02:18,898 --> 02:02:20,866
Otherwise the enemy
will think we're scared.

1475
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:22,762
Brother, I've told you..

1476
02:02:22,902 --> 02:02:25,132
..I don't know who they
were and whose car it was.

1477
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:31,908
We could've finished him too.

1478
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:35,569
No.

1479
02:02:38,084 --> 02:02:39,574
This is all I wanted.

1480
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:45,957
I just wanted to ignite a spark.

1481
02:02:46,726 --> 02:02:47,715
Which I did.

1482
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:50,726
Now the flames will come up.

1483
02:02:54,233 --> 02:02:56,133
I am sure they are behind it.

1484
02:03:11,951 --> 02:03:14,181
You didn't do the right thing
by starting this new chapter.

1485
02:03:16,021 --> 02:03:19,582
Now we'll show you..

1486
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,221
..how invaluable Karan's is for me.

1487
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:46,583
Listen, there's information.

1488
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:49,778
The war trumpet's been blown.

1489
02:03:49,989 --> 02:03:52,048
Uncle has challenged Mr. Rathore.

1490
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:53,850
And now. Guns firing.

1491
02:03:53,959 --> 02:03:55,517
A few will die here, few there.

1492
02:03:55,628 --> 02:03:57,220
And soon everything will be fine.
- Amitosh.

1493
02:03:58,030 --> 02:03:59,497
What did dad say to Rathore uncle?

1494
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,695
Now we'll show you..

1495
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:04,167
..how invaluable Karan's is for me.

1496
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:08,632
Karan, you know God
likes to complicate things.

1497
02:04:09,008 --> 02:04:11,909
When there was an enmity
between two families..

1498
02:04:11,977 --> 02:04:13,945
..then why bless one with
a son and another with a daughter.

1499
02:04:14,447 --> 02:04:15,846
And even if He did,
why make them meet?

1500
02:04:16,515 --> 02:04:18,745
And now they've met why
isn't He letting them be together?

1501
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:28,559
Have you lost your mind?

1502
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:29,750
Have you gone crazy?

1503
02:04:29,862 --> 02:04:31,921
You want to die.
- Yes, I want to die.

1504
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:34,065
Because I cannot
live without Karan.

1505
02:04:34,467 --> 02:04:36,025
Everyone's concerned
about them self.

1506
02:04:36,635 --> 02:04:38,967
Everyone's living for
their happiness and ego.

1507
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:44,800
Someone sorrows and
tear means nothing.

1508
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:46,102
That's not true, dear.

1509
02:04:46,779 --> 02:04:48,940
It's not.
- It is, mother.

1510
02:04:49,782 --> 02:04:50,771
It is.

1511
02:04:51,217 --> 02:04:53,481
I don't want to live like this.

1512
02:04:53,986 --> 02:04:55,613
I don't want to either.

1513
02:05:02,761 --> 02:05:03,921
I am here for you.

1514
02:05:04,663 --> 02:05:05,652
come with me.

1515
02:05:14,673 --> 02:05:15,662
But..

1516
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:18,605
But, Karan..
- Nothing will happen.

1517
02:05:20,746 --> 02:05:21,735
What will they do?

1518
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:23,778
Shoot us. Then let them.

1519
02:05:24,183 --> 02:05:25,480
If we can't be one
when we were alive..

1520
02:05:25,551 --> 02:05:26,540
..then we'll be one after we die.

1521
02:05:32,758 --> 02:05:35,056
Go, Karishma.
Live your life.

1522
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:37,856
Go away from this suffocating life.

1523
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:11,685
Hello.

1524
02:06:17,136 --> 02:06:18,160
Drive faster.

1525
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:39,533
Karan!

1526
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:02,689
Rathore!

1527
02:09:08,874 --> 02:09:13,368
Father. You can separate us,
stop our union..

1528
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:15,871
..but you cannot
stop us from dying.

1529
02:09:16,115 --> 02:09:17,446
We'll be one, daddy.

1530
02:09:17,616 --> 02:09:20,141
If not while we're alive,
then after we die.

1531
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,909
Karishma.
- Karan.

1532
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:25,979
Karan.

1533
02:09:26,091 --> 02:09:27,080
Karan.

1534
02:09:28,794 --> 02:09:29,783
Karan.

1535
02:09:43,108 --> 02:09:44,097
Karan.

1536
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:47,977
Karishma.
- Karan.

1537
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,538
Karishma.
- Karan.

1538
02:10:02,728 --> 02:10:03,752
Karishma.

1539
02:10:11,069 --> 02:10:12,969
Seal that area.
- Yes, sir.

1540
02:10:13,105 --> 02:10:14,595
Search every nook and corner.
- Yes, sir.

1541
02:10:27,486 --> 02:10:28,612
Did they find out anything?

1542
02:10:47,906 --> 02:10:50,204
Did they find out anything?

1543
02:11:34,219 --> 02:11:35,447
Look. Look.

1544
02:11:36,154 --> 02:11:37,143
What?

1545
02:11:38,457 --> 02:11:39,446
Look there.

1546
02:11:42,794 --> 02:11:44,591
The villagers saw them
here for the last time.

1547
02:11:44,663 --> 02:11:46,494
What do you mean by here? Did
they saw them jump in the river?

1548
02:11:46,598 --> 02:11:48,088
No one saw them jump in the river.

1549
02:11:48,166 --> 02:11:49,724
But they didn't
any further than this.

1550
02:11:50,502 --> 02:11:52,936
Because we've set up
check-posts everywhere. - Sir.

1551
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,803
Sir, this is all we found.

1552
02:12:00,946 --> 02:12:02,004
Do you recognise this?

1553
02:12:29,808 --> 02:12:30,832
Sister-in-law.

1554
02:12:40,886 --> 02:12:44,151
Look, this medication will
make her sleep for 12 hours.

1555
02:12:44,556 --> 02:12:46,114
And sleep is very
necessary for her. - Yes.

1556
02:12:46,258 --> 02:12:47,589
I will come again tomorrow.

1557
02:12:47,693 --> 02:12:49,126
In the meantime if there's
a problem, then call me.

1558
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:50,252
Thank you, doctor.

1559
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:54,827
Go, bring her dead body.

1560
02:12:56,101 --> 02:12:59,127
You sacrificed her for
the sake of your enmity.

1561
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:01,600
My daughter's been murdered.

1562
02:13:02,074 --> 02:13:03,939
And you murdered her.

1563
02:13:04,009 --> 02:13:05,670
You did. You.

1564
02:13:10,549 --> 02:13:11,538
Kaushaliya.

1565
02:13:11,950 --> 02:13:12,939
Kaushaliya.

1566
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:17,653
Sister-in-law, Karishma.

1567
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:19,955
control yourself.

1568
02:13:21,727 --> 02:13:23,695
Sister-in-law.

1569
02:13:47,252 --> 02:13:51,655
Should I accept the
truth that I've lost Karan?

1570
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:56,522
Is Karan..

1571
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:02,989
Sister-in-law...

1572
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:06,537
what kind of a father I am?

1573
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:13,737
I never understood..

1574
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:19,174
..my daughter.

1575
02:14:22,587 --> 02:14:23,781
I didn't recognize..

1576
02:14:25,924 --> 02:14:26,948
..her happiness..

1577
02:14:30,629 --> 02:14:31,687
..her sorrows.

1578
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,989
And now..

1579
02:14:37,903 --> 02:14:39,768
..when I've realised my mistake.

1580
02:14:48,113 --> 02:14:50,081
She's no longer with us,
sister-in-law.

1581
02:15:45,837 --> 02:15:46,826
Karan.

1582
02:15:48,073 --> 02:15:49,563
Let me first speak.

1583
02:15:52,511 --> 02:15:53,978
After that...

1584
02:15:56,248 --> 02:15:57,715
..you can shoot me if you like.

1585
02:16:00,418 --> 02:16:01,749
I've married Karishma.

1586
02:16:08,493 --> 02:16:09,824
And our decision was final..

1587
02:16:11,029 --> 02:16:14,487
..just like you and
chaudhary uncle were.

1588
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:17,431
Will he never let us be together?

1589
02:16:21,106 --> 02:16:24,940
I don't know what you
were going to achieve..

1590
02:16:25,877 --> 02:16:26,866
..from what you wanted.

1591
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:29,169
But we..

1592
02:16:31,917 --> 02:16:34,715
We had understood that..

1593
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:38,987
..after the marriage we're no
longer welcome in both the families.

1594
02:16:39,991 --> 02:16:43,950
Because you two would've
never understood our decision.

1595
02:16:45,897 --> 02:16:47,762
Then a question
pondered in our minds.

1596
02:16:49,067 --> 02:16:53,834
can we two be happy by
staying away from all of you?

1597
02:16:55,607 --> 02:16:57,074
We couldn't understand anything.

1598
02:16:57,943 --> 02:16:59,171
We didn't know what to do.

1599
02:17:01,446 --> 02:17:03,380
We even planned to leave lndia.

1600
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:07,450
But...that wasn't right either.

1601
02:17:09,087 --> 02:17:10,850
We decided to die.

1602
02:17:12,424 --> 02:17:13,857
But that would've been wrong.

1603
02:17:15,894 --> 02:17:17,885
It would've been
an end to our troubles..

1604
02:17:18,597 --> 02:17:22,124
..but a life-long
sorrow for all of you.

1605
02:17:26,671 --> 02:17:27,660
Another question.

1606
02:17:28,773 --> 02:17:33,642
We share a 22 year
old bond with you.

1607
02:17:35,013 --> 02:17:36,913
Would it be right to
break ties with all of you..

1608
02:17:37,882 --> 02:17:40,407
..for someone I've
known for only six months?

1609
02:17:51,463 --> 02:17:54,762
And we thought this
will be a mistake..

1610
02:17:55,967 --> 02:18:03,464
..that will curse us
for the rest of our lives.

1611
02:18:05,577 --> 02:18:08,740
And we came here.

1612
02:18:48,186 --> 02:18:49,676
